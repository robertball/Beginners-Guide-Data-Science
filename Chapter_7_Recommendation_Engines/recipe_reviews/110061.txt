I made this for the second time.  First time I made it to recipe except for using Olive Oil and it was good.  THIS time, I used Grapeseed Oil (I think it really is better), fire roasted corn, and 2 4oz cans of diced green chilis.  It is dynamite!!!  It has that extra zing but not "hot and spicy" by any means.

Loved this salad! I also used olive oil in place of the grapeseed. Wonderful summertime salad that would work well for a pot-luck. Sylvia thank you for sharing. The average lime yields 2T/1oz juice.

Wow, this salad was SO yummy!!! I eliminated the tomatoes and subbed diced red pepper, and I used balsamic vinegar. Also, I used a teaspoon of brown sugar--it was a hit! I'll probably bring it to our Thanksgiving celebration!

TRUE five-star Winner! Vegetarian cooking at its best. The boring title belies its great taste =) Great mix of colors, flavors, and textures. If the dressing seems too tangy, I would lessen the vinegar, NOT the lime. I used EV olive oil and cut up 3 large regular tomatoes (which I seeded first). I mixed the corn and soybeans with the dressing first, than tasted a spoonful with every subsequent addition...every bite was great--you could leave out something and still have a great salad. Canned corn also works in a pinch with only a slightly less "crunchy" result. I have served this over salad greens alongside hot cornbread, and also with rice. My new favorite recipe!!!! =)

This salad is positively divine! I couldn't find edamame, so I used chickpeas. I also used honey in place of the sugar. I suggest making this the day before serving.

Great taste, easy to make ahead and very good as leftover.  I used olive oil in the dressing and added a little crumbled feta cheese.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it!

Yummy!  I used olive oil instead of grape seed oil and I use chick peas too instead of edamame.  Will make this often.  I also put some shredded chedder in when serving.  I made it in the morning and ate it for supper so the flavors would combine longer.

I've made this several times, and actually crave this salad, with it's bright, clean flavors and protein punch.  Fresh cilantro is a must, although also good is the tube of cilantro that most supermarkets sell now.  TIP: microwave your limes for about 30 seconds; you'll be amazed at how much more juice you'll get.

Made this before a cook-out for some friends.  It was incredibly well received and everyone loved it!  I added Avocados and used red bell pepper instead of tomatoes.  It's flavorful, easy to prepare and REALLY good for you! This is a WIN!  

Oh!  And a good tip is to put the dressing on the edamame and corn when it's HOT.  The beans just drink up the flavor!

The other reviews have said it all... delicious, great texture, addictive!! I make the whole batch, but only put the dressing on half at a time to make it last longer in the fridge.

I just LOVED this salad and so did my husband.  I purchased the Edamame frozen at Trader Joe's.  The dressing is delicious too.  It just tastes so fresh and good for you!  Perfect summer salad/side dish with your fresh garden tomatoes.

I served this salad with some sea bass fillets and my partner turned to me with his mouth full and nodded and pointed to the bowl of salad, so a definite hit in our house as I loved it too! I had to use black eyed beans instead of black beans, but that was the only change I made. Lovely and heart healthy too!

This salad is INCREDIBLE!  Try to let it sit overnight, as that will allow the flavors to blend. Also definitely make sure you buy shelled Edamame because I can tell you from experience, it's not fun trying to shell an entire bag at once.

I have Grapeola oil, a mixture of grapeseed and canola oil, which worked great. Flavorful, colorful, and it is very easy to use a sugar alternative such as agave nectar or a stevia sweetener. Followed it to a tee otherwise, and really enjoyed this. I'd bring it to a party, it is so pretty!

I was so excited about this salad but it ended up being really boring to us.  Not sure why it has all the great reviews.  I might try it again since I have a whole bottle of grapeseed oil that I have no other use for.  I will update my review if our opinion changes...

This was a wonderful healthy salad.  The only change I made was to add some lime zest and I omitted the sugar because I don't mind a tart vinagrette. It tasted even better the next day once the flavours really had a chance to come together. Definitely a keeper! Love it!

Light and refreshing salad, and surprisingly addicting. The longer it sits the better it gets. Had it alongside some blackened tilapia..nice contrast of hot and cool.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out so good!  Some of the ingredients are out of the ordinary for me, so the next time I make it, I'll have most of those ingredients ready to go, and I definately plan to make this again.

Awesome salad! Made it into more of a "meal salad" by adding 1 cup of quinoa to the mix. Adding brown rice would also be a good choice.

Super fresh and yummy, full of nutrition and colourful. I had just made all my cilantro into an cilantro walnut pesto and used that, it turned out great, as i'm not a huge fan of big herby chunks of cilantro. i made it twice in one week:)

Love this!  I've made a few times now - everyone loves it.  It's a great blend of ingredients, flavor, balance of healthy components (protein, beans, veggies, lower carbs, etc.).  This is a keeper for me!

This recipe is quick, easy, and adds perfect balance to a BBQ.  I used virgin olive oil and tubed cilantro (I'm not a fan of cilantro and this is a little more discreet tasting) and it's always gotten high raves.  It's also great the next day w/ some tuna in a pita pocket; it adds just the right tang.

I made this twice and I still like it. Good for when you're feeling too heavy and just wanted something light to eat, it's the way to go! I'll have to experiment other flavors that reviewers tried here.

Healthy and delicious!  My daughter loves it too which is really great since we are trying to get the kids to eat more veggies and she is picky.

Great salad,  east to make.  Flavor is more robust when it is made one day ahead and is refrigerated.

This is a fabulous salad.  I changed it just a little.  I added Jalapeno, roasted the corn and just a little more garlic since we are garlic fans.  Very good and good for you!

This is a versatile recipe.  I don't always have edamame in the freezer so I often substitute garbanzo beans. You can also substitute different vinegars, oils and sweeteners with great success. I find fresh cilantro a must This salad is good on it's own or served over lettuce.

This is my go-to salad for potlucks. There is never any leftovers! I make it as-is, no substitutions because it turns out perfectly every time.

Summer after summer this salad never fails!! Didn't have grapeseed oil (which I actually prefer with this dish) but substituted EVOO and it was still great!! Will continue to make it time and time again...and it last all week for lunches too.

This recipe is a keeper!  I just used it as inspiration as I did not have all the ingredients on hand and wanted something fresh tasting to put into some flour tortillas.  My filler was as follows:  can of black beans, can of corn, 4 green onions, 2 cloves garlic, cut up ripe mango, 3/4 kosher salt, 1 tsp. white sugar, juice of 1/2 lemon, 3 tbs. red wine vinegar, 2 tbs. peanut oil.  Wow, was it ever good.  I just had two tortillas filled with this mix and am ready to make myself one more for lunch.  I would feel like a glutton, but not too bad since this is so much more of a healthy option.  I can't wait to make the whole salad as directed.  This also made plenty of salad for 2-3 days worth of lunch tortillas.

We loved this salad, next time I will add more lime juice (mine may have not been juicy enough) and I think some fresh chilli would be a great addition.

Wow!  This was so good!!  I didn't have the grapeseed oil so I just used some light olive oil.  I only had time to marinate it about 1 hr. but it was still delicious!  Thanks!

I didn't care for this as much as everyone else seemed to.  The amount of dressing was too much for the salad - it just pooled in the bottom of the bowl and didn't look very appetizing.  The taste was just "ok".

Great flavour and you just feel healthier eating this salad. I used olive oil because I didn't have grape seed oil on hand. I want to make it again and try out some different ingredients that people have recommended on here. Yum!

You can't mess this up!  Just made it and don't know if I can wait 2 hours to eat it!  Used white wine vinegar (out of red),  olive oil, garbanzo beans (no edamame in the house), and didn't cook the frozen corn - so NO cooking on this very hot day!  Think the lime juice makes it.  But honestly all kinds of substitutions from vinegar to oil to beans probably will work.  Going to serve it over lettuce with  avocado slices on the side.  Add baguette rounds toasted with olive oil and salt and pepper and dinner is served!

Delicous salad with a beautifully flawless presentation. Both my husband and I loved it and have made it again since.  **just remember to drain the corn and edamame "very well" as stated, otherwise you will have extra liquid in the bottom that takes away from the presentation...but not the taste**

Who knew soybeans could be so delicious?!  The flavor of this salad is out of this world and beautiful to boot!  Like other reviewers, I used olive oil and balsamic vinegar and honey in place of the sugar because that's what I had.  Also, I used 1 less tablespoon oil and 1 extra vinegar to lower the fat content a bit.  I will be making this again and can't wait to take to picnics this summer!

I probably would only give this 4 stars on taste alone, but it gets the 5th one for being both super healthy and super easy to prepare. I think the lime was too dominant though - next time I may reduce it or add a little more sugar. Still, a double batch was gobbled up at a cookout. Thanks for the recipe!

Great salad for summer. I only added one lime and just a sprinkling of salt and sugar. I used Olive Oil instead of grapeseed because it was what I had on hand. Perfect for potluck and BBQ's.

I made this, but didn't like the dressing. I poured out as much as I could, and just added lemon juice. Then I loved it. The mix and texture of ingredients is nice. Next time I would use less corn. I started adding red peppers and cucumbers, but stopped, since I found the texture really didn't go. The edamame makes this, so ideally don't leave them out or substitute, IMO.

This is a great recipe and very refreshing.  Great use of edamame. Below are my changes.

Instead of red wine vinegar, I used seasoned rice vinegar. I added extra cilantro and just mixed it in. Because I used seasoned rice vinegar, I reduced the salt from 3/4 to 1/2 tsp. Instead of frozen corn, I used two cans of whole corn kernels (the crisp and crunchy kind that is labelled that way). Instead of green onions, I used red onions chopped. For the garlic, I used two large garlic cloves

My husband and I really liked this salad.  The edamame makes it a little different from some of the others we routinely make.  I, too, used olive oil instead of grapeseed, and I also used equal amounts of vinegar and oil as another reviewer suggested.  It was really good.  Thanks for posting!

I have made this three times.  The first time exactly per the instructions.  The 2nd and third times dropped back on the amount of corn by half, finely diced 2 stalks of celery and 2 carrots and added a more cilantro.  The carrots and celery add some additional color and crunch.  Served it as a side to sandwiches at lunch or as a side to chicken or pork for dinner.  Keeps very well for a few days in the fridge.

easy and very good - easy to tweak depending on what you have on hand.  Used EVOO instead of grapeseed oil - and ran short of tomatoes so used half a red pepper too.  Vidalia onion instead of green. Great for potlucks.

I was really disappointed in this recipe--it sounded absolutely delicious but it was not that flavorful--I won't be making this again.

I substituted olive oil for the grapeseed oil, and added a can of garbanzo beans (chickpeas), and it was fantastic! Took this to a memorial day cookout and everyone loved it. Even with the additional can of beans, there was plenty of sauce to coat everything. It was even better the next day! I am making this again tomorrow.

We like this recipe so much that it has made its way into our rotation.  This salad feels healthy but filling due to all the protein from the beans and soy.  The dressing is delicious!

I really love this salad! I didn't have grapeseed oil so I used olive oil instead. I stuck to the recipe otherwise and was really pleased with the results.  It's a very filling salad and the dressing is delicious.  I'm looking forward to trying this with grapeseed oil. I only made enough for myself because I was skeptical about how it would turn out...but I'll have to make a lot more next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Followed this recipe pretty closely.  Used twice the edamame and black beans and left out the sugar.  Served over quinoa.

This is a great side dish in the summer months.  It is very fresh tasting and refreshing.  Goes great with chicken or can be eaten as a salsa as well.

Love that you can make this light, fresh tasting salad with frozen and canned winter ingredients.  It gets rave reviews from friends, holds well in the fridge, an is great on top of a green salad with some chicken for a main course salad.  It's been well received as a side with jerk chicken and jasmine rice, and also with enchiladas.  It's also fantastic as a salsa to scoop with tortilla chips.
My changes after making it the first time: add the zest of 1 lime, no garlic, less vinegar and oil, diced roasted jarred red pepper instead of tomato, no scallions, roast the corn first, half the edamame, a tad more sugar.  It was good as is, but stellar with these changes.

I liked it even more before I threw in the edamame (which I didn't expect since I love edamame), but either way it's five full stars. Great recipe.

Really delicious and very easy to make!  The only negative thing I have to say, is that one whole can of black beans seemed a little excessive....it was difficult to taste anything but them.  Next time will add only 1/2 of a can.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have black beans so used pinto beans. It stays fresh in the refrigerator  for up to a week. Will try this again with the black beans.

This salad is the BEST! I have shared this recipe with so many people who have loved it at my house and want to make it in their own. The  flavors just get better with age. Delicious and healthy all in one dish.

Simply delicious...The only small changes I made was used the juice from one lemon since that's what I had on hand and I used the corn from 3 white ears of corn as I need to use these up too.  Thanks Kitties for the fresh and easy salad for dinner tonight...!!

Oh. My. Gawd.  This salad is fantastic.  I made it exactly per the recipe instructions, including using the grapeseed oil (which was a first for me, but will definitely go into more of my vinaigrettes from now on) and it was absolutely wonderful.  I could drink the dressing!  I made it the night before and it was great the next day (although it was great as soon as it was made, too), but next time I might wait until an hour or so before serving to add the tomatoes.  I'm just not a huge fan of tomatoes out of the fridge.  But this is for sure a new staple on my picnic/pot luck/crowd pleasing menu!

The dressing for this recipe is quite bland without some added sugar and vinegar.  I used Splenda, and was able to sweeten it up to my taste without adding calories.  I added quite a bit of vinegar, too, until it tasted right.  The vegetables are great and really are healthy.  It makes a colorful, different salad that is a nice accompaniment to most any meal.

Love this recipe!  I like to make it early in the week so I have lunch for a few days.  I use less cilantro and double the black beans.  Any kind of vinegar will do.  I've used organic apple cider vinegar and it's just as good.

I love the dressing!  I had to use one lemon and one lime, but it was nice and tangy, salty and sweet.  This is the first time I've tried edamame, its ok - the salad is nice and refreshing, healthy and so colorful!  I didnt boil the corn, you can just throw it in the bowl frozen.

Very easy and hearty salad!  It's a perfect meal/snack to bring to school/work where you don't have to worry about refrigeration.

Whenever I make something new, I ask my husband to rate it on a scale from 1-10.  This was bestowed an enthusiastic 10!

I was hesitant to make this salad. It looked to hardy for me (and I am not a huge lime fan) but I thought maybe my husband would love it.  Sure enough, we BOTH loved it!

It IS hardy...it can be a meal on its own!  And the colors are just beautiful!  I actually ended up taking a photo of it to send to my Mom in Florida!

The only change I made to the recipe was adding 2 cups of corn instead of 3 (it was all I had).  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "t".

I think this is a pretty good "all season" recipe.  It would look just as good on a Thanksgiving table (beautiful, actually!) as it would a summer BBQ.

Well...what more can I say?  It is delicious, filling, packed with protein and lovely to look at it!  Go ahead and make it!  You will not be disappointed!

Great recipe!  Substituted grape seed oil with olive oil.  Added small can of chopped green chilis and shreaded monterry jack cheese and served it with nacho chips like a salsa.

Made a double batch for a July 4th cookout and there wasn't much left to take home.  Everyone loved it.  I substituted extra virgin olive oil instead of the grapeseed oil.

I loved this colorful, tangy, delicious bean salad. I especially enjoyed the hint of lime and the cilantro. Very fresh. I think next time I may add a little of the lime zest to boost the lime flavor just a little. I am adding this recipe to my list of favorites!

I love the combination of veggies in this dish, but, for me, the dressing needs some tweaking. I'll try reducing or omitting the lime and replacing it with cider vinegar. Some cumin and a dash of cayenne might work well, too.

Very flavorful! I also added one chopped up avocado and some ground peppercorn, and decided to make this a little more filling by adding in orzo pasta.

I love this recipe!  I think the cilantro and lime juice really adds a freshness to it. It keeps really well in the frig.  I usually use a little less corn and always add some red, orange or yellow pepper.

I have made this twice and I absolutely LOVE it.  Best with black beans but I've made it with chickpeas and it's just as good.  I used olive oil in place of grape seed but it's the red wine vinegar that makes the difference here!  I don't even like tomatoes but wow this recipe is one of my favourites for salad!

While not the best edamame salad recipe I know of, this is still pretty good - the first day.  It's reallly great the second day, though.

I added grapes and upped the amount of the other fruits. I didn't change the amount of pie filling. It was excellent! Make sure you drain all the fruit first.

So good. Used olive oil instead of grapeseed (sorry, I'm cheap). Other than that...stuck to it! My corn was roasted at a fair and cut off, frozen, and gifted to me :) so it was really good. My black beans were not from a can, but a batch I cooked myself with just water and a bay leaf. My cherry tomatoes were really grape tomatoes, I prefer the flavor. The only thing I would say is that I had to salt mine at the table...maybe because there was no salt in my beans? I marinaded for about 4 hours. The edamame was a lovely addition and we enjoyed this with our burger night. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

YUMMY! I did read the negative reviews about this recipe. Most of them state the recipe wasn't full of flavor. But like any recipe you make it your own. For example my husband likes a little more salt flavor so I bumped up the salt. We both like spice so I put in a little more spice. You have to make it your own. However, what a great combination of the Edamame, corn, and black beans. I wouldn't have thought of that combo. You just try it...just make sure you make it your own.

I really liked this salad!  I followed the recipe except for the onions because I don't like raw onions.  Tons of flavor!  I was thinking it would be good on a bed of lettuce as a meal.  Lots of protein with the edamame and black beans!

I have no idea why this is so good. I actually put off making it for a while because I was a little skeptical of the reviews. Afterall, it's just a salad. No -it's not. It's REALLY, REALLY good. The simple dressing is fantastic. My kids wanted more (?!). I followed th recipe, but threw in some brown rice that was left over from the night before, and added some shredded romaine and served it as a meal (rather than a side). Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Such a different, aka nice change of pace, to make while trying to remain health conscious vs. the traditional lettuce based salads.  I made a few additions to the recipe: added pre-packaged shredded carrots, sliced avacado and Compari tomatoes instead of grape.  Also used olive oil instead of grape seed due to budget constraints.  Will make again for sure.

I did not love this salad, but my husband did.  I did not have grapeseed oil, so I did substitute with olive oil.  Everything else we made as directed.  I think that I just do not like frozen edamame. My husband had bowl after bowl.

I make this salad a few times a month.  It's easy and delicious.  I leave out the cilantro and onions and increase the dressing by 50%.  I also increase the sugar slightly.  It's a flexible recipe, but you should never leave out the fresh lime juice - it makes the recipe.

I substituted hemp seed oil for the grapeseed oil, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was fabulous. I made this recipe on Thursday morning, took it on a camping trip, and we didn't eat it until Sunday night - and it held up perfectly. This is really an exceptional recipe.

This is very good! I like to make healthy salads to keep on hand for lunch through the week and am going to add this to my rotation! I am not a cilantro fan and my grapeseed oil had gone bad so I used a basil infused olive oil and fresh parsley. Thanks for a yummy and healthy salad!!

This salad is one of my absolute favorites (as well as my boyfriend's favorite and my co-workers). I brought it to a potluck at work and everyone raved. It was definitely the prettiest thing presented and thankfully tasted just as good as it looked! It also worked very well for preparing the night before. I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough black beans so I ended up adding a can of garbanzo beans as well and still excellent. Definitely something I recommend.

I give two stars for the wonderful combination of vegys. I suggest you make the dressing and taste it before you pour it on your vegys. We found the dressing too oily and too tart. Will not make again.

Bit hit - very easy and healthy!!  Make sure not to add too much Cilantro or it will end up tasting like salsa.  Let sit overnight to meld flavors.

OMG if I could give this 10 stars I would!!! Absolutely delicious. My husband made this and followed it to a tee. I didn't have a chance to try it until lunch the next day and it was OUTSTANDING! I'm not even that big a fan of cilantro (he's a huge fan) but it was still absolutely wonderful. We'll be making this a lot!

This is pretty good. I used white onions (all I had) and veggie oil (again, all I had). This will be a nice side dish in the summer.

I've made this salad so many times now and keep forgetting to review it.  I have followed the recipe exactly but sometimes I just don't have all the ingredients on hand so if I don't have limes then I use lemon juice instead. And I've also had to substitute grapeseed oil with extra virgin olive oil.  Simply Delicious! I've even substituted the beans for other beans...still delicious.  Of course  I prefer the black beans because they just have that perfect texture.  But this is a summer time favorite for my family!

This was delicious and easy to put together. Even my husband who thinks he doesn't like edamame, liked it! This makes more than 8 servings, though, maybe more like 12. Leftovers are still delicious, though. Thanks!

Great Salad! Very fresh and tangy tasting.  I used EVOO instead of grape seed oil and used red bell pepper instead of the tomato.  I used probably twice the cilantro for more flavor.  I sampled after a few hours and it was ok -- the next day it was really flavorful.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent receipe.  I served it at a party and got rave reviews.  I made the following slight changes...used a can of diced tomatoes with chilis (I had this in my pantry), grape tomatoes, 1 tablespoon more vinegar, a pinch of ground black pepper, and used splenda instead of real sugar.  It turned out delicious and easy to prepare the night before the party.

This salad has potential to be good, but when the dressing is added, it really should be eaten immediately.  once it sits overnight in the dressing, it gets somewhat tangy. I would recommend not adding the dressing until serving- and then just add it to what is served.

This is a tasty salad, although I think it could use a bit more zip.  I used olive oil instead of grapeseed oil, but other than that I followed the recipe closely.  My least favorite ingredient was the edamame, and it also contributes a lot of fat to the salad, so I think next time I'll cut back on it and try adding some pasta and additional spices (maybe chili powder).  I did really like the dressing, but it just wasn't strong enough for me.

This recipe was delicious!  I was looking for a healthy alternative to the TV dinner meals I normally take for lunch.  The flavors are outstanding once they are melded together.  I did make a few minor changes though: I substituted olive oil for the grapeseed oil, used grape tomatoes instead of cherry, and I used canned corn in place of the frozen.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I really wanted to love this salad.  On the plus side -- it looked beautiful! I made it as written except for using olive oil instead of grapeseed. Maybe I got bitter soybeans or something but mine turned out acidic, swimming in dressing with too much of a cilantro taste and an overall bitter aftertaste.  My husband took a bite and made a face.  I ate about four bites and decided to order something from delivery.  Maybe the grapeseed oil adds something that olive oil subtracts.  I'm surprised because I love all the ingredients but something was definitely off in the recipe for me.

This was AMAZING and so beautiful! I have a similar recipe which uses avocado instead of edamame but this is more economical and will be a staple in my home! I'm going to make it for a party and think this amount should feed 15 people each a 1/2 cup serving.

I didn't use grapeseed oil but wish I had spent the $8 at the store on it just to see what's so special about it. Still, without the oil, this was delicious and filling. Next time I will double the garlic and add a little extra salt. Those are the only things I would change about this recipe. If you're making this, keep in mind it makes a TON of food. Way more than enough for a family of three!

Excellent! This salad is beyond delicious. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because I don't like raw garlic in my food and skipped the onions. I realized midway through making this that I didn't have any black beans, so I used kidney beans instead. The flavors in this are outstanding and I look forward to making it again. Thanks! :)

This salad was fantastic!  Beautiful colors, sweet and crunchy.  I used Balsamic vinegar and EVO since I didn't have the other and it was great.A great way to get some soy.

Followed the recipe exactly other than adding an extra clove of garlic (because we like garlic a lot). It actually didn't need the extra garlic clove, and I don't really think that it needed any changes at all.  Wonderful recipe and was an absolutely beautiful assortment of colors.

Nice, light, fresh taste! If your family aren't big cilantro fans, you can cut the cilantro in half, as I did - you still get a light lime-cilantro flavour without the herbs being overpowering. I also used olive oil instead of grapeseed, and cut the amount by a third (2 tbsp instead of 3), and it came out great!

One of my favorites! I have made this probably 10 times, using olive oil instead of grapeseed. I brought some to work for lunch and everyone wanted to try it, so I barely got any myself that day!  They all wanted the recipe and have made it for their families, even kids love it.  The book club loved it too.  This is a definite winner; a great vegetarian and gluten-free high protein dish!

I suppose for a vegetarian this would be outstanding as a main dish; it's good, but I'm not blown away by it as the other posters. Nice summer salad. Different and colorful, and healthy as stated. It makes A LOT, next time I would cut recipe in half. Either way, for me it's too much corn. Don't skimp on the fresh limes juice. Better the next day.

Excellent recipe.  I made it for a potluck and didn't have much leftover.  I used peas in place of the edamame beans, as the grocery store doesn't carry this type of soybean.  I am not crazy about black beans, but with this recipe, it was great.. Very colorful salad and looks healthy and taste wonderful... Will make many times in the future and share this recipe with my friends and family.

Fantastic recipe!  There's really no need for that much oil though - to cut calories and fat I only used 1 Tbsp of olive oil and it came out great.  I also added a jalapeno and some cumin for an extra kick.

This salad lived up to the hype. I stayed true to the recipe with two minor changes. I used a can of Pinto beans versus Soybeans. To sweeten the vingarette more, I added 2-3 tablespoons of basslmic glaze. This is now my favorite go to cool, summer salad.

Used a mix of balsamic vinegar, Italian & creamy poppyseed dressings. Can also add pumpkin seeds, cranberries & eat with chopped chicken on the side, or added into the salad.

LOVE this salad! The first time I made it was for a 4th of July picnic, and my family devoured it. I have used fresh sweet corn when in season, but frozen is just as good the rest of the year. I do make a few changes to the recipe. I highly recommend roasting the corn first as it really brings out the sweetness. I spread the corn on a baking sheet, toss with just enough olive oil to coat and roast it in the oven at 400 for 15-20 min (less if using fresh), stirring halfway through and watching carefully so it doesn’t get too charred. My other changes are just based on personal preferences - I use a small red onion instead of the green onions, and I use only half the amount of black beans. The vinaigrette I make as written but salt to taste, which is usually a bit less than called for (at first I tried cutting back the amount of sugar as well, but it definitely needs it!). This is a great recipe that can be easily adapted to individual tastes.

This is SO GOOD!  I decreased the corn to 1-1/2 cups and added 1/2 of an orange pepper and half of a yellow pepper chopped up instead.  I also didn't have grapeseed oil so I just used canola oil.  The dressing is delightful.  Truly a light, healthy, delicious salad!

My husband described this in one word "Awesome".  This was easy to make and easy to pack for lunch or dinner.  The only thing I changed was that I substituted olive oil and added a sweet green bell pepper.  I did use lime juice concentrate in place of fresh lime juice.  Two tablespoons of lime juice concentrate equals the juice of one lime.

So, I made this salad exactly as written and was disappointed.  The tomatoes the next day absorbed the vinegar flavor and tasted like they were overripe and foul.  I just purchased fresh ingredients, so that wasn't the culprit.  Even dismissing the tomato "issue", I found this salad to be lacking in flavor and somewhat boring.  Brought it do a dinner party and no one went back for seconds...all gravitated to a roasted corn based salad.

I made this for a cookout and it was a big hit. I didn't have grape seed oil so I used olive oil. it was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

I made this and substituted 2 C cooked brown rice for the corn. It is delicious! Make ahead, divide into storage containers and have a healthy, quick lunch handy all week.

4 stars because I modified and never made the original.  I did black beans, frozen corn, garbanzo beans, cilantro, cherry tomatoes, red wine vinegar, 1 1/2 lemons, sea salt, pepper,  and garlic infused grapeseed oil.  Came out fabulous, oh and I added a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar.  Yummers!  will make again

I made it and substituted red onion for the green.  I also chopped up the mini sweet peppers and added a cucumber and chopped fresh Zuchinni in place of the edamame, didn't cook the corn, just thawed, drained and threw in.  All other ingredients were the same.  I too used olive oil as that's what I had on hand.  I only marinated for 30 minutes and it was great.  Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. My husband wasn't too fond of it, but he's not big on veggies.  I think you could use any combination of fresh veggies and thoroughly enjoy .  I will make this again.

Made this last night it turned out Great! It's so colorful :) My daughter came over, she tasted it, she wants the recipe, so... I'm sending it to her. We loved it! Ohhh, I did have to sub the grapeseed oil, I used canola oil instead. I do want to try it with the grapeseed oil, I just didn't have any on hand.

I forgot to buy cilanro, so I used some dried parsley. I also used honey instead of sugar, about 2 tsp. I used good quality Spanish olive oil in place of the grapeseed oil. Since this was a Holiday salad, I omitted the corn and used white beans instead of black ones. Overall tasted pretty good, but I added some marjoram flakes as it needed a little more herb flavor (probably wouldn't need this if I had used cilantro). Now it tastes great! This is an easy to adapt basic salad. Have fun with it!

This made a nice side dish to some baked fish.
I used extra virgin olive oil and cider vinegar because that's what I usually use for vinaigrette. This was good as is, but for more nutrition I added some diced avocados.

I thought this was so light and delicous!  I made several changes, I used cranberry pear balsamic vinegar as I did not have the red wine vinegar.  I used roasted red pepper in place of tomatoes because we are fans of peppers.  I used olive oil instead of grape seed.   I used garbanzo instead of black beans ( again personal pref) and red onion instead of green. I used fresh corn on the cob that I blanched.  4 ears made exactly 3 cups.  This will be my go to recipe for taking to friends BBQ's.  I rarely give 5 stars but this deserved it.  It is better if made the night before.

Very good , I like that there is not a lot off sugar like some " healthy" salads. I had to use olive oil, but made no other changes. Will make it again for sure!
It is also good with tortilla chips like a salsa.

Wow!!! This is so good.  Made without substitutions and simply loved it.  My first time using grape seed oil and I really liked it.  Next time, I might add a Serrano or jalapeño for a little heat

Followed ingredients and directions and it came out great!  I serve it with multi-grain tortilla Scoops but it's also really good on it's own.  I made a second batch with petite diced tomatoes and that also turned out pretty good (although it was more liquidy). Thanks for sharing!

This is super! It's amazing how delicious and fresh this salad is. I served it with grilled pork chops and brought to my family Christmas potluck. It was a huge hit. It has become my go-to salad. I made it exactly as the recipe states. It makes a pretty big portion. Plenty left over for lunch them next day.I think the grape seed oil is a must.

OMG is this ever amazing!!  The only change I made was subbing olive oil for the grapeseed as I did not have any, and I reduced it to 2 Tbls. just to save a wee bit on fat. I tried it without waiting for it to chill the 2 hours so if it's this good now, I can't wait to try it later!  And I think it's the prettiest salad ever.  
Thank-you for an awesome recipe!!

Like everyone else I too subbed olive oil for grapeseed oil.  I also subbed quinoa for black beans, and basil for cilantro, so a pretty different salad I guess!  But it was lovely and well-received.

Love this salad!  It takes some time to chop tomatoes, garlic, onion, etc. but was so worth it.  I've never used grapeseed oil with red wine vinegar.  Such a great combo.  It was mild yet with the garlic and cilantro sooo flavorful.  And addictive.  Great source of fiber, too.  One of my favorite recipes.

It was a yummy light but filling salad. I'm one of those people who gets recipes off this site and modifies them to my liking, but I didn't change a thing on this one and wouldn't. It was even better the next day. FYI I found grapeseed oil at Trader Joe's.

Loved this recipe! I was short on time and just threw in the corn and edamame frozen which thawed by the time I ate it and it was great.  I also added frozen petite peas which added a hint of sweetness- great lunch!!

This was a HUGE hit!!  This was absolutely wonderful.  I loved this salad.  I made it exact, but I liked the suggestion of adding red onion.  I will do that next time.  I might add some more veggies too, like zucchini.  But, it was spectacular and I've now added it to my cookbook!!!

This salad is delicious.  I followed the recipe except for the oil.  I subbed olive oil.  Next time I will substitute red bell pepper for the crunch and add some red onion for even more color.

Very good, refreshing salad.  I didn't find grapeseed oil, so used olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Also used red onion as one reviewer suggested, and grape tomotoes b/c they looked fresher in the store.  This will be a regular summer salad for us - thanks!

I had a bag of edamame in my freezer that I wanted to use and so I found this recipe.  It is fabulous! I switched the tomatoes out for chopped red pepper because I figured they would hold up longer.  That's the only change I made - I even went out and found grapeseed oil and I think it made the salad.  Our grocery store sells a version of this for $4.99/pound and this recipe beats it 100%

This is a delicious and very healthy appetizer - perfect with Tostito Scoop Chips!  If there is any left - toss in a salad. It's a great dish!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I can't believe I waited this long to review it!  Made it for the first time in June, and have made it at least 5 times since.  OUTSTANDING flavor combo, and very easily customized.  I have tried several variations, and my favorite version includes a handful (maybe 1/3 c) finely diced green pepper, basalmic instead of red wine vinegar (though color is affected if you're entertaining), 1/2 c cilantro, extra light olive oil instead of grapeseed oil (and only 2 TBSP). Thank you, thank you, thank you - I don't believe I'll ever go a summer without making this!

Wow this salad is great!!  Thanks so much for submitting it.  I am going to make it regularly to have it in my fridge as it is SUCH a healthy snack or side. If you slice the cherry tomatoes it looks really pretty next to the round beans/corn.  Thanks again!!

Awesome!  My teenage boys are getting more health conscious and interested in adding protein to their diet - this refreshing salad is perfect.  I make the recipe just as written, but it's very forgiving if you want to substitute ingredients or adjust the ratios of beans and corn.

Absolute perfection! Made it tonight, and it looks as if I'm not even going to have leftovers! I've tried the black bean salad recipe from this website as well and used it as a staple for over a year, but now this will be my "go to" salad. I would not change a single part of this recipe!!

This is absolutely fabulous!  I've actually made it twice in a week since finding the recipe since my garden is overflowing with cherry tomatoes and cilantro.  First time I added diced red pepper and the second time I added diced avocado.  Loved both versions.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe - it is amazing!!

Wow, this is a great salad!  The texture is terrific as is the taste! It is very colorful, too. I'm fortunate to find it in time for all the summer picnics and barbecues, I will definitely be bringing this one along! I'm especially happy that it is a vegetarian dish without it being the type of dish meat eaters would shy away from. Thanks for a great recipe I plan on making time and time again!

I've made this salad twice, as is.  I've eaten it over greens and by itself.  I've decided that it's at it's best when eaten an hour or so after making, and it gets worse after it sits for a couple days.  The flavors all absorb each other and become bland.  Next time I want to make a smaller batch and add white onion.

We followed the recipe as stated.  I wasnt such a big fan until we marinated it overnight which turned it into an amazing cold salad...for best results ensure you do that.

I'll admit, this salad is growing on me. It took a couple tries over a couple of days but I'm definitely liking how the flavors are blending. If I make this again I will cut down on the lime, but the 2 I had were very large and juicy, so that might be why salad came out a bit too strong on the lime scale. I used a little less oil, parsley instead of cilantro (its all I had) as well as half balsamic vinegar with half white wine vinegar. I love that this recipe uses edamame!

I decreased the amount of vinegar and olive oil by 1 Tbsp each to make it even just a little healthier and it was still FABULOUS. My husband and I could not stop talking about how yummy this salad was. This will be a favorite of ours for many many years. YUM YUM YUM.

I so wanted to like this recipe, but didn't care for the red wine vinegar flavor. It seems to have possibilities, however. I'll try it again with just lime juice, oil, and extra cilantro, perhaps with a smaller amount of white vinegar. It makes a beautiful presentation and is very colorful.

Very good! I couldn't find edamame so I subbed in lima beans and just cooked them a few minutes longer. It worked out quite well.

This salad is really wonderful, and makes a beautiful presentation.  The dressing is very fresh tasting.  I put together the night before, with the exception of the tomatoes which I added an hour before serving.  Just before serving, I topped with warm beer-boiled shrimp from this site.  It was a great hit with my guests.  The next time, I believe I will line the dish with spinach leaves for added color.  I will take this to potlucks, so nice to have a "new" bean salad recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This was fabulous!! I have made it twice now and loved it both times! First time I made exactly the way it stated & it was great, but the second time I substitued chopped red onion instead of green onion (don't really like green) and omitted the garlic. My husband & I both agree it doesn't really need garlic, but then again we are not huge garlic lovers like some people. I made it for a party I was throwing & had several other garlicky recipes. But we loved it both ways honestly!

I just finished making this and it took less than 10 minutes! This is absolutely delicious!! At first, I was hesitant to make it because I didn't have all the ingredients but it still turned out great!! The changes I made: used juice from 1 lemon instead of the limes (thats all i had), subsituted red onion for green onion, used olive oil in place of grapeseed oil, and diced up 3 tomatoes in place of cherry tomatoes. I didn't even let it marinade before trying it and it's soooo good! I can't wait to make the recipe as it is. Yummm!

What a healthy and delicious salad!!!  I made a batch to bring to work for lunch, and I love it!  You can add extra veggies in there, too, and spice it up any way you like.  I had never tried edamame before, and WOW!!!  Yummmmmmm!  Who knew?  Thanks!

This was a delicious and healthy salad!  I substituted the grapeseed oil with olive oil like others suggested and it turned out perfect!  I served it with grilled chicken and everyone loved it!  I think it was even better the next day!  ;)

Great healthy side dish with lots of protein and flavor!  Next time I won't add the sugar (It didn't seem like it needed it) and reduce the oil to 1 tablespoon.

Really fresh & delicious and super easy to prepare.  It is so colourful.  This is going to become a staple on my picnic table this summer!!!
