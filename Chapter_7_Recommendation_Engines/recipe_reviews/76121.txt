This was excellent and so easy. I used Bills Blue cheese dressng recipe from this site instead of bottled. Really nice first class salad!

I loved this salad!  I used "Marie's" bottled Chunky Blue Cheese dressing, and so left out the crumbled blue cheese.  I added extra sliced almonds and chopped up some red onion (little less than 1/4 cup) for a little extra flavor.

This recipe was very simple and made a very satisfying lunch. I added some extra almonds and blue cheese crumbles on top to "pretty it up."

Very nice combination of flavors. The recipe calls for way too much dressing and almonds though. I personally dislike my salad swimming in dressing, so I just drizzled some on, probably only about a tbsp; probably about the same amount of almonds too. I liked this a lot. Thanks!

Wow! This salad definitely is "First Class" and if you love bleu cheese it'll be right up your alley. It calls for so few ingredients it's perfect for a quick and easy lunch. I used "Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing Ever!" from this site - just enough to drizzle over top. I quartered my hard boiled egg and added some red onion and crumbled bacon. Very tasty!

What an interesting salad this turned out to be.  I can't believe the difference in taste before and after toasting the almonds, it's amazing.  I will be making this again.

This was good but it needs something.  If I make it again I would add bacon to it I think.
