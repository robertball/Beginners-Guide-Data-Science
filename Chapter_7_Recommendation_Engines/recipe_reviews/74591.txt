I love this salsa! I have made this 4 times already. I took it to a work potluck this week and got many requests for the recipe. As others mentioned, it can be get a little watery. After I seed the tomatoes and chop them in my food processor, I let them sit in a strainer while I do the rest of the work. This helps make it less watery. Thanks!

Whoa Nelly! As a person who is used to spicy and always orders the hottest number of spice a restaurant offers - I nearly burnt my mouth off with this stuff! I only added one jalapeno pepper (with seeds) so I didn't think it would be that hot. I don't think this recipe needs the extra hot sauce! I also agree with some of the other reviews that it was salty and had too much cilantro. I love cilantro but it made the salsa really green so it was a bit overpowering. I don't think it needs any salt or garlic powder especially if you are using chips with salt already on them. I will give it 3 stars because I was able to tone down the heat with more tomato and lime juice and was good because it was fresh. But I will have to change up the recipe if I was to make it again.

This is one of the best salsa recipes I've tried.  If you follow the recipe as is it's spicy.  If you use one jalapeno and one Tbsp. hot sauce it's medium.  If you omit the jalapeno and hot sauce it's mild.  Delicious!

This is fabulous salsa.  I like a medium consistency salsa so I pureed half the veggies and diced the other half so I had some chunks still in it.  The half of the tomatoes I diced I also drained so it wouldn't be too runny.  Next time I will use a serrano or habanero pepper because even with 3 jalapenos it wasn't spicy enough for my tastes.  This salsa was still fabulous, even though next time I would only salt and pepper to taste as I found what the recipe called for might be a little on the heavy side.

This recipe is amazing.  Some advice: If you have the time, pulse the tomatoes and chop other ingredients by hand.  Also, let the tomatoes sit in fridge for an hour before adding other ingredients and then drain the water off of the top (they're tomatoes...they will get watery), then add remaining ingredients.  If your concerned about heat (the hotter the better for me), add jalapenos and hot sauce until desired spiciness.  I love this recipe as is.  Thanks J-Shep!

I did like this recipe but I made some changes.  I don't like the skin on the tomatoes so I blanched them to remove the skin.  I used 2 very large tomatoes & 1/2 red onion, 1 Tbsp of lime juice, 2 cloves of garlic & 1 tsp of cumin.  We also heated ours after blending it on the stove to bring some more flavor out.

I give this a 5 stars rating. It is exceptionally delicious. I did use chopped garlic instead of powder. The salsa was very juicy, which could have been corrected by draining the tomatoes for a bit. I personally enjoyed it the way it was. My batch made 3 cups. What is great about this is that there are only 210 calories for the entire 3 cups. Thanks for a great recipe.

This should be called Jen's Fresh HOT and Spicy Salsa.  My Husband loved it, but we both love HOT Spicy Salsa.  I do agree with a few of the other reviews, I would drain the tomatoes before mixing in the other ingredients.  I also used a couple of garlic cloves (chopped) instead of powder. Lots of flavor - excellent recipe.

This is pretty tastey!  I used the recipe as a basic guideline, using probably about 10 or so smaller/medium romas, a small white onion, about 1 1 /2 peppers, just a bit of dried cilantro, lemon juice....and I pretty much pureed it in the blender so it's smooth.  It's really good.

This was great salsa!  It tasted even better two days later!  I used fresh garlic, as I did not have garlic powder.  Otherwise, I kept the recipe as is!!

This is my favorite salsa recipe. Light and so good! I used the canned jalapenos along with a good bit of the water they're packed in.

HEAT LEVEL EXPLAINED:  The majority of the heat of a pepper is contained in the seeds and the veins.  To reduce the amount of heat, seed and devein the peppers. Or use the whole pepper for more heat.  Also, each pepper's heat content will be different depending on the variety, the field, soil, fertilizer, rainfall, etc.  Just like tomatoes.  You can buy several jalapenos, (or any kind of pepper) then compare when you get home.  Some may be extremely hot, some mild, some medium.

Added about 2tbs of olive oil, 1tbs vinegar, and considerably cut back on spicy-ness (no black pepper, no jalapenos, only 1/2tsp of hot pepper sauce, because I'm a wimp when it comes to hotness :)). It turned out super delicious (still, pretty hot for me), better than the store bought, and I am planning to use this recipe again and again! Thank you!

Wonderful flavor.  Used only 1 pepper as that is all I had, but thought it perfect.  Added just a squeeze more of lime.

Everyone Loved this! I made exactly as written except for subbing 1 clove of garlic smashed for the garlic powder. I also let this sit in the fridge for about 6 hours before serving it. The longer it sat the spicier it got. I will definately be making this again. I may even make a big batch and can it. Thanks!

This is an excellent Spicy Salsa and it did indeed taste like a favorite restaurant salsa of ours.  I'd been struggling for years to make salsa, and it just wasn't quite right.  I must not have had the proportions right.  But now my salsa worries are over.  Fantastic!

This was really good, but I only used one jalapeno with a few seeds instead of using two jalapenos. I'll make this again, but I'll use more tomatoes as it was a bit too watery for my tastes.

Great base recipe for salsa. The advice that many gave to drain the tomatoes in the fridge before adding the rest of the other ingredients was very helpful. Instead of garlic powder, I used 1 fresh garlic clove. For an extra "zing" I substituted the 2 jalapenos with 1 habanero (I used red savina, but any habanero should do).

This salsa was amazing!  I only added one jalapeno and 1 tbsp. of hot sauce because I'm trying to ease my way into spicy foods.  So fresh and deliciously spicy :)

Awesome salsa!  Prepared as written, except used 4 green onions (they were huge) and used tapatio (mexican hot sauce).  Two TBSP of hot sauce and was quite spicy.  Jalapeno's I used were disappointly mild.  FANTASTIC RECIPE.

I used 1/2 of a large sweet onion and left out the hot sauce. I also used 2 cloves of garlic and it was very good. I was trying to find a great salsa on here and this is very close. I used only one jalapeno and I was sorry I did.....I had to add another to get the heat we are used to. I didn't seed them either.

Very delicious and fresh tasting!  I added one garlic clove instead of the garlic powder. Since I only had one tomato, I also used a half of a drained can of diced tomatoes; for this reason, I only used 1/2 tsp salt.

Very flavorful as written. I used garden grown tomatoes and jalapeno peppers that were allowed to turn red on the plants.   I omitted the lime juice and added 2 more tomatoes.  Equally as good.

This is my first homemade fresh salsa.  We like it medium, so I used 1 jalapeno pepper and 1 Tbs Frank's hot pepper sauce, and it was perfect...better than restaurant quality.  Thank you!

Loved this salsa.  When I first tried it, I could first taste the lime and the cilantro.  Then a few seconds later the heat hits.  It was great!

Yummy! I did actually tweak it a bit though- added about 2 tblsp. apple cider vinegar, 1 serrano pepper, and used one small red onion and one small white onion instead of the green onions.

So hot! The  flavor combination was delicious and fresh, but i only added one seeded jalepeno, and it still had a strong kick. Like others, I did not find any need for the hot sauce. I also used red onion and fresh garlic and blanched and peeled the tomatoes. It was really fresh-tasting and delicious. My 4-star rating is with my level of spice, and not the listed recipe's level. It would just be too hot as listed. I am bringing to a party today, so we will see how it is accepted!

This Salsa was NOT very good!  I followed the recipe to the "T"...mine turn out looking like GREEN MUSH!!! and the flavor was lacking something. I will not make this again, it was a waste of money....

This recipe was quick and easy. I changed a couple of things. First,the tomatoes need to be drained of their liquid,or the Salsa will be watery. Second,unless you like HOT,and I do mean HOT Salsa,you will need to take the seeds out of your jalapeno pepper. Please use plastic gloves,or if no gloves you can use baggies over your hands,before you remove the seeds. You do not want to cut into this pepper without your hands protected as the juice WILL get into your skin and BURN whatever skin it comes into contact with. Also, I used Uncle Franks Hot Sauce. It is the best. Thanks for sharing,Jen.

Made this for a party of 60 people, everyone loved it; lots of compliments.  I kept hearing..."who made that salsa???".  I was surprised there were no white onions in it, but was happy to figure out that the GREEN onions are what make it taste "restaurant style".  This will be my go-to salsa recipe.

I've tried 5 other salsa recipes and so far this one is the best.  Like other reviewers, I cut down the green onions in half and loved it but I'm not a big onion fan.  We've been putting the salsa on everything from eggs to torillas.  Very good!

AWESOME RECIPE!  With a few adjustments pulled from the other reviews...I've made this twice in the last two weeks with FRESH homegrown Roma tomatoes.  Tastes just like the salsa at our local Mexican restaurant.  Will have a hard time eating salsa from the grocery shelf again.

This salsa is fabulous!!  The only thing I changed was that I used 1 clove of fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder.  My fiancee found it to be too spicy, so, for my second batch I used 1 pablano pepper instead of the jalapeno and only 1 teaspoon of the hot sauce and it was just as tasty without all the heat.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Fantastic as is...if you love some kick.  Plus, easy to adjust by changing the peppers and the sauce to tame it down or rock it out with fire.  I used some habanero peppers, along with Tabasco Brand Habanero Sauce...WOW amazingly flavorful and with a heat level that all of us had to comment on.  There are never any leftovers, no matter what heat level.  I am going to make a 10x batch and can using tomatoes & peppers from our garden for salsa all year long.

I used one jalapeno, a few fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic powder and went easy on the salt. I love it when I can make salsa at home, it beats the pants off the prepackaged stuff. The family thought this salsa was great.

Definitely needs ripe tomatoes!  I made this for Superbowl, and tomatoes weren't in season at all. The salsa was still tasty, but just not as "fresh" and flavorful as it could've been with a higher quality tomato.

Very spicy, which I like! I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand so I went with a basic version. The use of extra hot sauce, garlic powder, and cilantro I'm a fan of though.

Take the time to chop your ingredients nicely, and then pulse in your food processor just a few times to make it juicy.  I didn't quite have enough hot pepper sauce but it was plenty spicy with just 1 tablespoon.  The salsa came out great, it's the perfect amount of everything!

DELICIOUS!!! Although, I made it for my BF and I and I thought enough for 16 would be way toomuch, so I cut it in half and figured I'd save some for another day. That did not happen. It barely made like 1/2 cup salsa. Bummer! I will make this again, but I'll make enough for 40 and see how that goes. Other than that it was a great salsa!

I had a craving for chips & salsa. This recipe was fast and very easy. It is alittle watery. I took the advice from previous people and only put 1 jalapeno and 1 tsp hot sauce. Next time I will add more heat not spicy enough yet.

So I used six tomatoes, I just needed to get rid of them. I added a very scant teaspoon- probably more like 3/4- and found this too salty. It was very cilantro-tastic, though, which I LOVE. It's also reeeeally spicy with just the two jalapenos- I omitted the hot pepper sauce and still, Dang. I will make this again and just use less salt.

I make this every weekend for football season, it is so goo I usually double it so it will last me all week. It is easy and a great snack. I chop everything up and put it into a large bowl and mix it with a spoo before I place it in the blender a little at a time to prvent the cilatro from clumping up, worth the effort!

We had a lot of grape tomatoes from our garden that I need to use up, so I decided to try this recipe. I made a few adjustments (only used 1 T. of cilantro and omitted the green pepper) to suit my family's tastes and we all loved it. This is a great recipe that I'll be making again and again.

Quick and easy recipe to make! I used a hand blender to chop up the ingredients, which cut down on the prep time.  I refrigerated this over night to let the flavors mingle and it was excellent! Next time I might slice up some fresh avocado to add in.

Was a big hit at a cookout and everyone asked for the recipe.  I did adjust the quantities of the ingredients, and added 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley and used fresh garlic.  Don't think I can go back to jar salsa!

Fastastic!  Made for a picnic of 50 or so women and they loved it!  Many asked for the recipe!  Used cilantro from my garden and substituted 2 cloves of fresh garlic for the powder!

Wow.  That is definitely spicy.  I wish I could give this a 3.5, because it wasn't my favorite as written, but it could be quite adaptable. I cut back on the green onions as well because I thought it would be too much for us (I only put in 5, and both my husband and I thought the onion flavor was still too overwhelming).   But I do like the flavor of it, so I think next time I'll only put in one green onion and not put it in the food processor (we thought it was too potent chopped in there) along with some sweet onion instead for the texture.  I also only put in one jalopeno, and not as much hot sauce, and less salt and pepper because I knew it would just be too hot for us.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I plan on adjusting it to our tastes and making it often!

I found this to be good, but not great.  I would add lots more spice, regular onions and some other things to make it have more flavor.

this is one of the best salsa recipes i have found.  i can make it quick and have it ready for the party.  i recommend letting it set for an hour in the refrigerator and draining some of the water off the top of it before adding the other ingredients.  i like it because it reminds me of the salsa from my favorite mexican resturant!

I love no-cook salsa, and loved this recipe.  I decided to finely chop everything by hand, and it turned out fabulously.  Likely I and the person who made a "green mess" don't have the proper pulsing feature on our blenders.  Great stuff and I'll make it again!

This is a quick and easy recipe AND is delicious!!  My garden is overflowing with tomatoes and peppers this year.  Has anyone ever tried to cold pack this salsa?  I'd love to preserve it to enjoy in the winter months.

Great salsa recipe.  I use 3 more tomato, fresh garlic ( no powder),  and 1/2 the recommended cilantro, but that's a personal preference. Depending on the jalapeno size, I use 1 or 2 to kick the heat up.  I also add red pepper flake in a pinch.  The texture is great and can be drained a bit if it's too watery for your liking. Easy to toss it all in my processor and pulse it till it's perfect. LOVE LOVE LOVE that there is no strong onion taste with this!

I did tweak this a little, added in 3 cloves of fresh garlic in place of the powder, and some cumin.   I also used a shallot instead of green onions.

The flavor laced throughout this salsa is very good.  I'm still looking for that restaurant style salsa without the blended consistency though.  Other than that, this is a great salsa.

On a recent trip to the States in June this year had some wonderful mexican food and loved all the salsa, I recreated this thru your recipe last night - for some reason my supermarket in Australia didnt have any hot sauce (not even tobasco!) so I put in an extra chilli (left seeds in) and added a bit more cracked pepper. So very very good - we love it hot & love this recipe, its a keeper :)
Thanks!!

Im giving this a 4 cause hubby and kids though it was too spicy and I loved it and only used 1 jalapeno!!! I also used red onion instead of the green. I thought this was great and loved the texture due to using the food processor. It really reminded me of restaurant quality salsa. Very fresh and tasty. Fresh cilantro is a must. Thanks for a yummy and quick salsa.

Great starter salsa recipe.  I basically used the recipe for a foundation salsa and built off of it.  I used 15 green onions instead of 10.  3 Habaneras instead of the jalapenos (I LOVE IT SPICY), a dash of dried cilantro (I don't care for cilantro), no hot pepper sauce because I was already using Habaneras, 1 tsp fresh garlic, 1 tsp garlic salt, and added 1 medium yellow onion.  SO GOOD!!

I made this recipe for a salsa competition at work (there were only 2 other entries and they needed a 3rd to call it a 'contest')  I searched for a super easy 5-star recipe on this site to contribute to the competition, never expecting to win, I just wanted to participate.  I won 1st place.   I tried to not grind it up too fine like the picture, mine was a little more course.  At first it tasted like pice de gallo but after 2 days it did taste more like a very fresh salsa.  I liked it.

I was a little disappointed but everyone else thought it was great!  Added fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt and limited the salt and pepper.  Also omitted the hot pepper sauce.  It was spicy enough without that and the jalapeno seeds!

Want to kick this salsa up a notch?  Forget the jalepeno, hot sauce, and pepper.  Add several chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (found canned in the Mexican aisle) for an awesome chipotle salsa that is just as fresh and even more amazing!  I also used fresh garlic and a half teaspoon of cumin...  You won't be sorry!

Not a huge fan of cilantro so only used 1/2 as much. Used a couple of garlic cloves and tossed that in blender with tomatoes. Let this sit overnight in fridge to serve the next evening and it is to die for. Delish! Will definitely do this again and often. This was the hit of our Super Bowl party. Thanks for sharing a great recipe I've already shared with 3 others!!

I love hot, spicy food and this was very spicy.  My only problem was that the recipes has too much cilantro.  I would put half of the amount in the salsa.

I thought this could have been better.  It was to spicy for me, and a bunch of men.  And I only used one jalepeno.  I think my bigger conflict was that there were too many green onions in it.  Next time I will cut them in half.  And use a little more lime juice.

I made this recipe for a dinner, there were no leftovers.  I didn't use roma tomatoes, but ones from my garden (Jet Stars).  I defiantly needed to drain them.  Loved the cilantro and will use fresh garlic next time.

This was pretty good, but I think next time I'll use fresh garlic instead of the powder.

Not bad.  I was pretty disappointed though.  Think I would have prefered regular onions instead of the green onion-found them overpowering.  Actually was a little bland, seemed like it was missing something.

The ony thing I will change next time it the amount of cilantro. Other than that it was really good; chunky and really SPICY.

Love this one!  I did make a few changes due to the fact when I first made it, it was too hot for my kids.  I usually double the recipe. I used the milder tabasco (green one) and only 1/2 a pepper for the whole thing.  I like to give it a few hours to have the flavors marry and than it is great with a side of guacamole!

My favorite salsa now, even better than restaurants! It's fresh and perfectly balanced in its ingredients. I, too, used about 1 to 2 cloves of chopped fresh garlic instead of powder. I usually use red onion in my salsa, but the green onions gave a much milder oniony flavor, which I now prefer.  I'd say all the proportions in this one are right on target, except for perhaps the amount of jalapeno called for-- but then that's just personal taste.  I only used about half of one jalapeno (minus the seeds).  That made a salsa slightly warmer than mild.  I would imagine using all that was called for would make it HOT.  I used 5 roma tomatoes, and it made a lot of salsa.  I really loved this salsa.

Very good salsa recipe! I don't like jalapeno peppers, so I used a green bell pepper instead. Also, instead of garlic powder, I added a spoonful of minced garlic. Wonderful fresh taste!

I really liked this recipie it was very tasty and semi-easy to make. I found that there seemed to be too many green onions in the recipie so I cut the number of green onions down to four. I would also suggest cutting down the salt and pepper by half. I also only used one jalopeno and it was plenty spicy for me.

This recipe is great.  I took the other reviewer's suggestions and let the tomatoes sit in the refridgerator for an hour then drained the tomato juice off the top before adding the other ingredients.  A drained can of tomatos may work also.

I thought this was a great starter recipe.  But next time, I would let the tomatoes drain in the frigde for a while before adding the other ingredients so that the salsa didn't get so runny.
Also, it was a bit too much cilantro for me and not enough tomatoes.  Next time I would double the tomatoes and half the salsa.

This came out very watery & too hot (even though I only used only one jalapeno).  There are too many onions in this recipe & not enough tomatoes.  If I were to make this again I would hand chop the vegetables to make the salsa more chunky & use only half of a jalapeno.  I used a food processor and this salsa came out a watery green mess.

Definately a good recipe base. We needed it hotter and less juicy. Tripled the pepper and strained the tomatoes after it sat for an hour. Only pureed half so there was chunks. Tastes great on eggs.

I tried this, and was pleasantly surprised. it is a simple recipe but wow what great tastes! I used cherry tomatoes instead since I had a lot growing around the house. I also left out the pepper sauce since my wife doesn't like too much spice, I think it was bang on! next time I will make a slight reduction in the coriander as i thought it did overpower the other tastes a bit  but if you like coriander a lot then stick to the original amount. Overall an outstanding salsa!

Really great, full flavor and the spice level I like.  Just one change I made was skip the salt.  That leaves about 200 mg of sodium for the whole recipe rather tan 2560 using the salt that adds nothing; plenty of flavor without it.

It was really good.  Although I did add a habanero pepper for that extra kick!  I'm going to have to tweak it a bit because there is a little too much of something in it.  But it's really close to perfect.

This salsa is great! It is very spicy, which is great, but if you find store bought salsa to be hot, you might want to tone it down a bit. Next time I'm going to try to use less green onion, just to see if that quantity is actually required. It does tend to make the end result very green.

This salsa had overall good flavor and heat, but  TOO MUCH cilantro. The amount of cilantro was overpowering. I added an extra tomato to try to mitigate it, but next time I will definitely use less. Also, I only used a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and I think that was good.

Just drained a little water off after it set for a while. Just as good if not better than restaurant salsa.

Very tasty,and I was looking for an all fresh ingredient recipe rather than using canned items.  A few minor changes I made: I was a bit chicken so I only used one jalapeño and it came out just right for us.  I also used cherry tomatoes from the garden...red, yellow and orange because we had SO many- beautiful colors! I drained it after processing because it was very watery; and lastly, I subbed parsley for the cilantro because I don't care for it. Very fresh and tasty, I've just discovered another way to use up extra garden tomatoes ??

Next time, will pulse versus puree the veggies.  Came out tasty, but more green than the picture.  Good though, and great with Tostidos Lime chips.

This was really spicy and good. Now that my family has had they turn their noses up at the jarred stuff and insist I make this instead. I don't use a blender though - I used a hand mixer and pulse the chopped veggies so that theres still a bit of chunk in it - nothing else different

Really great receipe. I added half a white onion, fresh garlic (8 cloves), and blanched the tomatoes. 1 jalapeño was just enough heat. 2 would probably be too hot for the average person or if your serving as a party dish. I forgot to drained the tomatoes, so I drained it as much as I could afterwards and it worked out fine.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and have added something new each time.  My husband's biggest complaint was that it tasted to "vegetably" so we have tinkered with the recipe a bit.  Adding a tablespoon of brown sugar seems to have taken care of the only complaint that we had!  It is easy and very good!

Very good salsa recipe.  I think logic would dictate that you use the hot ingredients based on who will be eating it.  I added 3 or 4 small baby peppers I had in the frig so they wouldn't go to waste.  It was a nice addition.

I made this and tweaked it a bit. I used canned jalapeno and no hot sauce and it was great, hot and I loved it. Good way to use ripe roma tomatoes right from the back yard.

I liked this recipe. I peeled and deseeded the tomatoes before using them. I also used fresh garlic instead of powdered. I tripled the recipe because I have a lot of tomatoes. (I'm going to freeze half the salsa.) I left out the black pepper because my 3 year old only likes mild or medium salsa. After I set hers aside, I added black pepper and cayenne to the rest. Yum. Thanks for sharing the recipe

This is a good salsa recipe! I modified it a little. I only used one jalapeno (seeds and all) and it was SPICY! And I'm someone that puts Tobasco sauce on EVERYTHING. So beware. I also skipped adding extra heat with a hot sauce skipped the cilantro (not into the soapy taste). I'm looking forward to playing with the recipe a little bit...maybe add some tomatillos. Happy cooking!

I think that next time I will use canned tomatoes, because they are not in season right now, the taste was good but my husband didn't like the green onions, so we're going to to white next time.  Don't blend it too long, then it gets frothy.

I make this for parties where there are usually 30-40 firefighters and their families I obviously increase everything to have enough but I don't change the ingredients and everyone loves it! It has just the right amount of spice for my taste. It also tastes great mixed in with some melted velveeta to make a really good cheese dip.

If you love a super spicy salsa, you will love this! A great kick to it and goes great with corn ships and vegetable sticks. Very easy to whip up in the food processor and tastes great.

I've never made salsa, so this one was great.  A sister recommended it to me.  But I used not even 1/2 a jalapeno and 1/2 a tablespoon of hot pepper sauce.  I don't like salsa for the heat.  Oh, and I used less cilantro, just because I don't love cilantro.

This tasted great. I only used 1 pepper and a couple of swigs (maybe 1-2 tsp) of Tabasco for kidlet's sake. This will come in handy when the tomatoes start to ripen.

Wow, I will NEVER buy salsa again!  This was EASILY the best salsa I have had in my life!  I did make a few changes to suit my taste, however: I used 4 cloves fresh garlic, omitted the salt, & used 1 whole jalapeno & didnt bother seeding it.  I also used 1/3 of a green & 1/3 of a yellow bell pepper.  Great base & it has sooo many possibilites!

I just made this. It's okay right now, but I made this ahead of time to blend the flavors before I serve it to guests tonight. WARNING - go easy on the hot sauce! I didn't even add the jalapenos and only 1 tablespoon of habanero Tabasco sauce & it's SUPER SPICY. Maybe it's the type of Tabasco that I used, but I LOVE super spicy food, but this was too much for eating with only chips, although it might be okay in a burrito.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe. Others said it was too salty but I found there wasn't enough salt, I had to add extra. I love cooking with cilantro, but there was just way too much in this. End result, it was okay but I have had better. Maybe white onions would have helped, I don't know.

The store was out of green onions, so I used 1 (small) white onion and 1 (small) red onion instead.  I also only used 1.5 jalapenos because my roommate and boyfriend  don't like spicy food as much as I do.  I thought it was really good, but my roommate thought it was too spicy (she blended some sweet tomatoes into hers).  It made a lot of salsa!

We love this salsa, we add a bit more fresh garlic, our own cherry tomatoes to some roma tomatoes.  My husband is not a fan of hot stuff, and the 2 tablespoons hot sauce seems okay for him.

This was good.  I used 3 roma tomatoes and two regular tomatoes.  I did not add the hot pepper sauce, but will use franks red hot sauce next time to make it spicier.  Also, I used over a half cup of cilantro, and it really complimented the tomatoes and hot  pepper nicely.  Instead of garlic powder, I used Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic.

Mmmmm, love salsa and this was a good hot one.  I added two small serrano peppers in addition to the jalapeno's (from the garden of course) and whew it's hot.  You really need to let the ingredients meld before trying, otherwise it will taste like lime/tabasco.  I also used fresh minced garlic.  Great recipe J!!

This did not turn out as I expected. The salsa was very thin and drippy. I was expecting the texture to be chunky. Also, I have never cooked with cilantro and will never again. I put less than the recipe called for and the cilantro was all you could taste.. I will continue to by salsa in the jar.. It's so much easier.. I only made salsa for a contest my sister-in-law was having.. It did get a few votes, so I guess it was not all that bad!! Thanks

This was soooo spicy-if you like salsa that's not really munchable then this is the salsa for you. Personally, I like salsa that you can't get enough of. I ended up using like 9 fresh tomatoes and 1/2 can crushed tomatoes to lessen the spice. (Ran out of fresh tomatoes!) Turned out pretty good after adding all that and some extra onion powder and garlic.

This was very good and easy. My family likes a more mild salsa, so I ommitted the hot sauce.

I liked the taste, but not the consistency - which was my fault, since I had to put it in my blender.  I used to have a food chopper of sorts, which I made fresh salsa in.  I wish I still had that little gadget.  But the overall taste was good.  I did only use 5 green onions, and just tore off a bunch of cilantro, I didn't really measure it.

Wonderful!  i wanted a recipe to make the fresh salsa at the resteraunt and i have found it.  I modified to make it less hot, did not add any jalepeno peppers and substitued the green onion for sweet white onion.  I will be making this all summer and loving every bite of it.  Oh family and friends agreed they love it to!!!!

For us this had way too much salt even after I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours.  The taste is absolutely wonderful once you get past the salty taste.  I will make this again.

This was very good.  I made it to accompany tacos and fahitas.  My only comment is that I found the cilantro a little overpowering.  I would make this again but I would cut the cilatro in half.

I love this recipe, it is easy and it has both the up front heat and the lingering heat that salsa lovers crave! If you follow the instructions and seed the tomatoes it will not seem watery.
