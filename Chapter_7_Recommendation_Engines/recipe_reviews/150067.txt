I think the directions are incorrect.  If you cook bean sprouts 10 min. they will be very overcooked, and no longer crunchy at all.

This recipe is quite good, the only thing I added was a bit of sugar since the soy sauce was too salty but turned out great. Actually in asian cooking, we cook sprouts until it throughly cooked quite a bit, it would be soft but retain some of the crunchiness, the taste of it change but still good. The watercress have such a good aroma to it.

I plugged in Pork and Watercress to see what came up, and your recipe was pretty close to mine, however I also add a little rice wine vinegar, mirin (sweetner) and small amount of sesame oil. I also added round onion, bok choy chinese cabbage along with the watercress and bean sprouts. In all the years I made this, my meat was sometimes a little on the tough side, by simmering in the sauce for 40 minutes per your instructions,before adding all the veggies, OMG!!!, IT WAS SOOO TENDER!!  I now know what I was doing wrong all these years.  Thank you sooooo much Keani. I love these types of recipes because they're inspiring and you can pretty much play with it.  If I had shiitake mushrooms, they would have went in too.  This is great over rice.  Yummmy

This recipe was okay, but too salty from the soy sauce.  I  think next time, I'll add some brown sugar.
