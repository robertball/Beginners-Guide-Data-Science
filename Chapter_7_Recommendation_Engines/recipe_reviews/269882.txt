"Gourmet Hush Puppies" if you don't have muff-tin. Tips: soak cornmeal in the  milk for 10 or 15 min., you may want less sugar, after combine all ingredients listed, add enough flour (about 1/2 cup) just a little at a time until you can roll dough in small little "footballs". 
Fry in hot oil just like any other hush puppy.
Goooood !
