This is by far one of the best recipes on this site.  I'm obsessed with it.  My changes: I use plain yogurt instead of sour cream, I use a whole pita and just fold it over on itself instead of using 2 halves (brush it with olive oil and sprinkle garlic salt), I break up the burger into chunks, and I top the gyro with lots of feta!  YUM.  Just make sure you plan ahead since some stores won't have the ground lamb.  Serve it with couscous and the Easy Roasted Red Pepper Hummus recipe on this site.

Awesome! Both the lamb patties & the sauce are excellent! I did swap out fresh dill for the mint in the cucumber sauce.

These were delicious but extremely messy to eat. The cucumber sauce made this recipe, it was so tasty. I will be making these a lot over the summer as they are very quick and easy.

Wonderful--Tastes like authentic greek food. It's kind of hard to eat a burger in the pita so I usually cook it as loose meat and stuff the pitas with it. Tastes like gyros! Cucumber sauce is great too.

These were a nice change from the regular burgers we always have at BBQs. Great flavors, none were over powering. The cucumber sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the great flavors of the lamb burger's delicious garlic taste. We will make these over and over again!

Great recipe.  I made lamb lollipops with meat mixture and passed them at a party using the cucumber sauce as a dip for the meat lollipops.

Delicious!  Only change I made was I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make cucumber sauce.  My family of 5 loved these.  I served with family recipe of tabbouli and suffed grape leaves.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  I followed the burger recipe exactly, and these came out great!  I especially like the cucumber sauce.  The only thing I did differently was to serve them on toasted hamburger buns instead of pita (since I didn't think they would fit in the pita very well).  If you like gyros, you'll love these.

I've made this recipe twice now and loved it. The sauce is the best part- very authentic. I am a mother of three little ones and need something easy and fast to make. The kids actually liked the lamb and wanted more!

I have been making this recipe for about a year. My whole family loves it. Great change of pace for summer BBQ instead of boring beef burgers. If you're in a hurry you can skip the step of roasting the garlic cloves and substitute minced garlic from a jar. It seems just as tasty. Also, we substitute plain/nonfat yogurt for the sour cream. Put it in a colander over a bowl for at least a half hour to drain out the liquid before use. We've found the flavor of these are even better if done on our Weber charcoal grill instead of the gas grill. Try this recipe, you will love it.

PITA note: There are 2 pita types. The one to use is the thick Greek pita/flat bread which has NO pocket & must be pan-grilled with a bit of olive oil first. The Middle Eastern pita has a pocket, is thin, comes in 2 sizes, needs no further cooking prior to use, can even be made at home, & is commonly available in US grocery stores. Use these only if you can't find the Greek pitas.
Made only the burger & with only lean ground beef. 4.5 stars actually.(I used my authentic Greek tzatziki.) Very good, but will use a more fatty ground beef next time so that they'll be juicy. Reminder to self: let gyros-loving J & R try these! And try a burger with lemon zest added.

The taste is awesome and the burgers were really juicy.  The only problem was that they tended to fall apart because of the feta cheese.  My suggestion would be to put the feta in the middle and form the burger around the cheese.  They may hold together better that way.  Otherwise this was great.  Served the burgers with a little Greek salad and it was an awesome meal.

I added parsley along with the oregano.  I served it on an olive oil toasted pita.  It was great! Thank you.

I cooked this for my family, but had to leave so I was unable to eat with them. Upon my return, my husband raved "that recipe is a keeper". Not a typical response for him, so its really good! I made the greek tzatziki sauce using another allrecipes recipe using greek yogurt as the base. A heathy meal and that they loved - home run!

This was really good! I had already put my garlic thru a press when I found this recipe so it didn't get roasted. I also added a finely minced shallot to the meat. It's snowing and I wasn't about to mess with a grill so I cooked the burgers in a pan with a little olive oil. I also didn't have mint, so I used a little parsley. Also added salt and pepper to the Tzatzike sauce. The only thing I'll do differently when I make these again (and I plan to) would be to run the meat mix thru my food processor to make it finer, more like the schwarma meat found in gyros made in the U.S. I also served with extra feta, lettuce, tomatoes and red onion - because I was in a veggie mood.

These are fantastic! I made some changes: did not roast the garlic (I don't like roasted garlic), substituted plain yogurt for sour cream and dried dill for mint in the sauce; added a pinch each of thyme and marjoram to meat. I fried them in a pan and served over a bed of raw spinach and topped them with sliced onions, cherry tomatoes, sauce, and feta. The result was like a lamb burger salad. I'll definitely make this again, and it would make a special meal for guests. Thanks!

Love the Greek flavours!!  I am making my own ground meat and I'm glad to have such a great recipe.  It's too hard to do the burger/pita thing, so I'm just doing burgers, "Greek Style Potatoes" and "Tzatziki Sauce" -- all with Extra Garlic Cloves!!

This recipe is fantastic!!  My husband wanted something "different" for dinner & suggested lamb.  I whipped these up and they were great.  I didn't have any vinegar so I used a bit of lemon juice!!  Perfect!! Thanks.

These are absolutely delicious! I was busy and couldn't fire up the grill, so I crumbled the meat in a frying pan with the spices.  Served it on a pita.  Really quick this way. SO yummy! Even my picky 13 year old LOVED it!  I've made it 3 times since then.

If you love ordering gyros.... then u will love being able to make these in your home! This is delicious and really tastes like an authentic gyro! One of the best things I have made from the website! I will def be making this frequently! Easy! I did not form patties, I allowed the meat to be loose and it was still great! Sauce was fresh and wonderful.... but alot of it went to waste... I would have been better off to half the sauce recipe.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried on this website.  The sauce is amazing and the burgers are a nice change to the standard beef burger.  I omitted the mint because I do not like it, however I replaced it with chives and that tasted wonderful.

The burger and cucumber sauce tasted just like a gyro. The burger grilled great and the cold sauce with the warm burger was a perfect match. YUM!!! It was also so easy to make. It took no time to whip up the burgers and sauce. It is a quick and easy meal for family or guests on a summer night.

It was good.  No grill so I pan fried them.  I'm sure they would have been better on the grill and will attempt that in the spring.

I made these last night for dinner and my teenage boys and their friends asked for seconds. I changed the recipe a little bit. Instead of the oregono, salt and pepper. I used greek seasoning. I also didn't have mint for the cucumber sauce so I substituted the greek seasoning and it was great. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is the best lamb-burger recipe I have ever tried!  The flavors of the Feta and the lamb are outrageous!  It's great the way it is but I sprinkled a little Pappy's over the burgers before I grilled them for a little extra kick.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The closest I've come to Gyros. I cheated and used a prepared tazzi sauce, but it came out great.

I would recommend shaping the burgers more oblong than round, which will fit the pita better.  Then just fold the pita, without cutting it in two, to hold everything together.

Amazing! I followed the recipe for the lamb patties and I couldn’t believe how great they turned out. I didn’t have propane for the grill so I fried them in garlic flavored olive oil. Using a toasted English muffin as my bun, I topped it with hidden valley ranch dressing, the yogurt with cucumber flavor. It’s saved making the dressing and to me it was outstanding. Can’t wait to make again!

Fantastic! Just follow the recipe and make sure not to overcook so that it is juicy (grill for a bit less time than  regular beef burgers). Will definitely make it again and again and again!

Really, really good!  I made the following changes:  Used 1# ground lamb and 0.5# ground beef.  Added a couple minced shallots along with the minced garlic to the meat and used fresh thyme and mint minced together instead of oregano.  For the sauce, I added a little feta and used cottage cheese to supplement the sour cream because I didn't have quite enough on hand.  Added some garlic salt and minced shallots as well, and pureed 3/4 of the mixture to smooth things out a bit.  Delicious!  Got many compliments on the burgers, and the sauce was perfect!

I've had this recipe in my box for a while, and only recently made it for the first time. I thought it was a good burger, and I'll definitely make it again. However, I must note that I didn't use Lamb meat. I used ground turkey. I'm from a po'dunk town so even having ground turkey here is a treat. The turkey meat still made a yummy burger, and I even added a little oatmeal (don't really know if it was necessary, but I did). The only other thing I might add for next time is salt and pepper (which I didn't in this recipe, for a little more seasoning). Also, for my cucumber sauce I had a Tzatziki recipe that was dill, lemon juice, garlic, and yogurt so that is what I followed.

I have NEVER reviewed a recipe.  This was great!!!! My husband loved it as well.  The only thing we did differently was use 1 lb. instead of 1 1/4 lb.  I used low fat feta and low fat sour cream.  Couldn't tell!  It was so good!

We love making these burgers, along with the Mediterranean Greek Salad, for a "Greek night" at home.  Only changes I make: I use plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, and I break up the burgers after grilling and put in a pita to make a gyro-style sandwich.  This has become one of my family's favorite dinners!

I made these burgers but a little different.  I used half ground turkey and half ground lamb.  Also, instead of pita we found pita bread buns which were delicious.  The sauce was delicious and went well with the burgers.

Wonderful recipe. My burgers were made in a pan vs. a grill. I can't imagine how awesome they would be over an open flame!  I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be great- better than restaurant-quality. My boyfriend ate two and loved them as well. :) The only thing I would suggest would be to use less mint in the cucumber sauce. For my personal taste, it was overpowering.  Highly recommended recipe.

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is that I haven't tried this entire recipe yet.  I needed a good tzatziki (cucumber sauce) recipe, and this one was definitely great.  I would give it 5 stars.  The burgers sound good, so I might make them some other time :)

I was excited while making these, the ingredients just sounded like they'd go together perfectly ... my other half hardly said a word, just mmmm'd and oooooh'd his way through 2 of them ... the sauce is perfection, just like you'd get at a coney island ... these just became a regular in this household!!

I didn't quite get how the pita breads were to be done and I couldn't find any small ones in my market.  Also the recipe calls for 4 large, thin tomato slices - twice!  And neglected to mention the onions which I am sure is what was meant.  Having said all that, they were delicious!!!!!
