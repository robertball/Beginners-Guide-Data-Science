It was great my daughter-in-law loved it cooked it for my son too. I added black olives and served with garlic bread.

This was very good fresh tasting and a good use for all of the Roma tomatoes from my garden last summer. I plan to make it again this summer!

Different but probably won't make again. I think the name just throws me (spaghetti sauce) because I couldn't get pass the idea that spaghetti sauce is cooked in our house. I thought of this as more of a starter for salsa.

This is very good - excellent summer meal. Fast easy and fresh. It is more like a pasta salad and that is OK. A splash of white balsamic a pinch of sugar and a pinch of red pepper flakes would take this over the top. I would also think that a healthy sprinkling of Parmesan would be wonderful.

This is great fresh and simple and make ahead. I added a can of tuna one time for my non-vegetarian friends plus red pepper flakes and olives and that was great as well.
