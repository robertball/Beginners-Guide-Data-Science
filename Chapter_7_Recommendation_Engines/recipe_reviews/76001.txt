A little on the sweet side.  I would reduce the amount of raisins and also chop the figs into very small pieces.  For some reason, my meat turned out a bit too chewy, even though I followed the directions to a T.  Perhaps next time I would shorten the browning time in the pan.  That being said, it's an interesting twist on stew and has lots of great flavor.

I loved the flavors but I don't have nutmeg so I changed nutmeg to fenugreek and it was delicious! I also used radish instead of turnip. What a wonderful smell! Mmmm. Thank you!

A fantastic combination of flavors. Great for those cooler fall nights when stews keep you warm from the inside. This one quickly became a favoritte in our family.

Flavor is a 5, but dish in not too colorful.  I will make it again!  I substituted potato and onion for turnip (no turnips at the local farmstand)

Very good!  I took other member's advise and cut the figs really small.  I am a true believer of flavor so I tripled the spices plus I added another 1/4 cup of turnip (3/4 cup).  It was a really big hit!  I cook for my boyfriend and our employee for LUNCH, everybody LOVED it.  I also changed things around for the crockpot.  I cooked the beef in the chicken stock (plus about 3/4 cup) in the crockpot overnight on the "warm" setting.  Once I arrived at work (7:30am), I added the turnips and lentils and placed the cooker on low.  About an hour before serving, I added the raisins and figs.  Everyone loved it!

Yummy!  I didn't have several of the ingredients, so had to substitute (sweet potato for turnip, assorted dried fruit for figs), but it was still a great recipe for using beef stew meat and lentils.

Like some other reviewers, I made substitutions based on what was on hand.  Acorn squash for the parsnip; cranberries & a few prunes for the fruit.  Also agree that 3 cups of liquid is enough to add for cooking the lentils.  Overall - this is my kind of meal.

I liked it, but found that I want to change the cooking time.  I tend to like beef medium rare, but 45 minutes of simmering takes the beef to medium well or so.  Meanwhile, the cooking time for lentils needed to be longer.  With these changes, I will make it again.

Can't put into words how my whole family reacted to this recipe other then, no one liked it and it was a not pleasant. I'm sorry, won't be making this again.

I only used 1/2 C raisins because it was all I had on hand. Used green lentils. Hubby, 15 month old and I all loved it. Update: I make this regularly now. I often sub 1 C of white or sweet potatoes for the lentils. When I make this change, I also reduce the liquid by 1 C. Its fab this way, too.
