Did not have fresh thyme or cilantro, so used dried (1 tsp ea).  mixed the dressing, waited 10 minutes, then mixed it with the beans, celery and onions.  The rice was not cool yet, and I had to take my son to choir, so it sat for 1 1/2 hrs before adding the rice and then serving.  I did not like it that night.  It was too oily and the red wine vinegar was too strong.  I couldn't taste the black beans at all, which I love.  I put the remains in the fridge and had some for lunch the next day.  It was sooo much better the next day.  The oily taste was gone, the vinegar and thyme had time to mellow.  The fresh basil and parsley looked a little sad, so I'll probably either put the fresh herbs in just before serving or use dried.  And I would definitely add more beans (love black beans). Overall, it was good and so simple (love the idea of a recipe that uses left over rice).

Used the recipe as written and it was wonderful. Very fresh tasting. I think using the fresh herbs as opposed to dried makes all the difference. We absolutely love this salad.

I took a 1/2 day off of work and made this and the Tilapia with Mango Salsa. It is absolutely delcious upon first  tasting it. I did not alter the recipe and think the fresh herbs make this recipe. I can't wait to see what hubby thinks about it at dinner tonight.

This is a very tasty and unique salad, and has a
nice color with the white rice, black beans and the
different colors of green with the celery and herbs.
As another reviewer suggested, it does need to sit
a few hours to allow the flavors to meld. I used the
recipe as written other than subbing Chipotle chile
pepper for the Cayenne, and reducing the black
pepper to 1/4 tsp. I also used Basmati white rice.
Five stars and highly recommended!

What a great, light alternative to a Mexican "heavy" side! Cool and refreshing - lots of herbs and just the right amount of oil and vinegar. Definitely a winner!

Surprisingly spicy and full of flavor.  Good to make the day before.  Great alternative to potato salad at picnics.

recipe was great.  i made one slight change in it,  istead of the heat from the cayenne, i made a fresh tomatillo and jalapeno salso to go along with it.  recipe still is fantastic without it.

Really liked this recipe!! I used a pouch of ready made brown rice and zapped it in the microwave for about a minute to warm it up and take the dressing a bit better. Omitted the cilantro only because I didn't have any and celery because I'm not a big fan. Cut back the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon. Added calamata olives instead of canned black olives and then added about a half a cup of halved cherry tomatoes. Wonderfull!! Perfect lunch salad!! Next time I'm going to reduce the olive oil to 2 tablespoons to reduce the fat conent a bit and add a minced jalepeno for a bit more heat but trust me, a pretty good recipe as is!

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out EXCELLENT! Next time I may make a little more of the seasoning to throw in as I like my food VERY flavorful but everyone else thought I shouldn't change one thing!

This is a tasty salad! I found it to be a little bit too salty, but others enjoyed it the way it was. I used fresh chives instead of the green onions, and kidney beans instead of black. I thought I had a can around, and realized I only had kidney beans after I started making it! I think I will probably try it again with black beans. This is healthy, yummy, and easy; thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. This would make a great potluck dish. I've made this several times now. Each time a little different depending what I have on hand. The best substitutes so far are balsamic vinegar, brown jasmin rice, and garlic cloves instead of garlic powder.

Wonderful.  But agree with other reviewers, fresh herbs are a must.  I don't like red wine vinegar so I used 1/2c of Annie's red wine vinegar & olive oil dressing instead of the vinegar and olive oil.  It's a great brown bag lunch.

i think this was great. i add fresh red bell peppers and leave out the cilantro (can't stand the soapy taste.) make this a day ahead if you can...much better after it has a chance to marinade. btw, 2 cups of water for 1 cup of long,white rice.

Sorry, too much vinegar for my taste, I thought it was too strong when I tasted it before mixing into th rice but hoped the other ingredients would tame it, if I'd 1/2 it I suspect my rating would be 4 star

Very nice side dish for a hot day and a great alternative to the same old pasta salad I had been making previously. I made pretty much exactly as described but just a splash of balsamic vinegar and about 2 1/2 to 3 cups of rice. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

This tastes very similar to a pasta salad that I make which has been a family favorite for years. I used canola oil and 1 tsp. each of dried basil and thyme because I did not have fresh on hand. I added some fresh diced tomatoes, and some shredded cheddar cheese. Wonderful fresh flavor and some punch. I will definately make this again!

I made this with some leftover jasmine rice.  This is very tasty and different.  I am going to use it in some wraps also.  I did not have fresh spices only on the cilantro.  I will make with all fresh next time just to see if there is a difference.  But I love the taste, thanks for something different.

This recipe disappointed me in a way.  I made it because I love absolutely every ingredient, but somehow all together they weren't too spectacular. Oh it's edible and I plan to consume every morsel, but I won't be making it again

I really liked this recipe, except for the olive oil. I'll see what it's like tomorrow, as one reviewer noted. I used basmati rice, minced garlic (didn't have the powder),  white wine vinegar (didn't have red) and omitted the olives (because I don't like them). Didn't have fresh thyme, so used ground. Also added orange peppers for some colour contrast and a hit of sweetness. This recipe seems like it could adapt well to variations -- thinking about diced tomatoes and jalapeños. A nice lunch option! Thank you!

I made this as-written for a side dish, and tried it again for lunch the following day.  The dressing was tasty and we enjoyed the crunch from the celery, but it was heavier than anticipated and didn't translate as "refreshing" to us.  I would try this again with a brown rice and maybe some halved grape tomatoes or a can of drained fire roasted tomatoes.

No changes to the original recipe. Very tasty. I like how the spiciness doesn't come out until the food has been in the mouth for a bit. I will make this again.

Love this salad.  When I make it I leave out the cilantro as we do not care for it and cut back a bit on the cayenne pepper.  I use dried herbs as that is what I have.  I also add diced coloured sweet peppers, diced cucumber and diced tomato.  I have a great red wine dressing so I add that instead of the oil and vinegar.  This salad lasts a few days so it is great to make and then have left overs to take for lunches.

I made this as written except I did not have fresh basil or thyme so used dried, I have since planted a herb garden and will used fresh next time, I'm sure it will be better although I paired this with grilled tilapia with mango salsa

Very tasty.  Cooked the rice the night before and assembled the salad the following day.  Used brown rice. Did not have fresh parsley or fresh cilantro, so used 1/3 the amount, dry.  Good to find healthy Mexican food!

This gets a five because my husband immediately asked me to make it again ... the next day.  I've made it with both a brown rice blend and white rice - both are wonderful.  I did use dried herbs as I have recently been away and the friend who was supposed to water my herbs killed them all.  I reconstituted them with a little oil and water (1/2 tblsp. of each that is supposed to be 1 tblsp.) and went from there.  Almost the whole household dislikes celery (except me!) so I used multi colored sweet peppers (the bagged little ones) instead and they made it colorful and were wonderful in it.  The rice/bean/dressing mix is a great starter for an immense number of combinations of veggies, depending upon what is available at the farmers markets.

My family loved this. I love that had all those fresh herbs in the house and have been trying a number of different recipes with those. I changed two things. 1. I used kidney beans instead of black beans. We just do not care for black beans. 2. I only used 1/8 cup of oil. Oil isn't my favorite, so I cut that down.

Very good and using fresh herbs makes the flavor kick. I did use China Girl brown rice and it was just fine...

I fixed this exactly as stated, except had to use dried thyme -- and it was fantastic!  It was easy, quick, and the result was spicy but just like we like it.  I did use a good olive oil that we hadn't yet opened, and I always think that makes a positive difference.  Also used a good red wine vinegar.  But neither the olive oil or the vinegar was especially rare or expensive.  Very flavorful right off the bat -- didn't have to wait a day for the flavors to fully blend -- even fifteen minutes after fixing it was tangy, tasty, and filling.  This will become a standby for my wife and me!

A nice change from our usual Mexican black bean recipes. 
I cut the oil in half and substituted chopped tomato for the black olives.  I also omitted the cilantro.  
I didn't have celery, it wasn't missed, but will try it next time.  I also made this with dried herbs and let them sit in the oil for an hour prior to blending in.

Reminded me of an old Hopping John salad I used to make in the 70s, with black-eyed peas. And who in the world would think of substituting dried cilantro for fresh? Do they even sell dried cilantro?? Cilantro is one of my favorite herbs because of its distinctive flavor. It makes this recipe. If you don't have fresh cilantro on hand, then don't make this; make something else.

Was delicious! I made it for my non-vegetarian bf and he loved it! To make it personal I might add an extra celery stalk and green onion next time just to add extra flavor! Kudos to whom shared this!!!!

easy to make and pretty tasty.  Next time, I will use 1/2 of the vinegar instead and twice more celery and seasoning.  I used the left over sushi rice which was sticky and took me a while to separate the rice.  I think the standard rice will not have this problem.

AWESOME use of leftover rice! Even with no fresh herbs on hand, and forced to substitute dried, this came out mouth-watering just as it's written. The combination of flavors and textures is superb!

My new favorite dish. I've made it twice following the recipe exactly, and it is sooo good!

Perfect with a salad on a hot summer day.

Okay, this was excellent.  Followed the recipe as written except to omit olives (a few in our group don't care for them)and cut back a bit on the cayenne; everyone loved this salad.  And, it's really good the next day, too - - - just put it in the microwave for about 20 or 30 seconds to warm slightly and take the chill off.  I ate for breakfast as I couldn't wait for lunch!

My husband loved this salad.  It definitely has a kick to it!  I didn't love this at first, but after a few bites it grew on me and I ended up really enjoying it!  It's something different!

This was pretty good and my family liked it a lot.  I thought I was a bit dry but I'll definitely am making it again.  I did the recipe almogrist exactly as written except I used dried thyme instead of fresh because the store didn't have any.  It went really great with the Grilled Talapia with Mango Salsa from this site.  A bit of steamed broccoli finished the meal.  Great for a summer day.

This salad was just OK.  A nice change from your typical macaroni or potato salad that uses mayo as a base.  I changed the recipe slightly, substituting chopped green peppers for the celery and I added 3 T. of diced pimentos- - the salad needed a little more color. I took this to a picnic at the beach, it held up well.  Wasn't all that impressive, I probably won't make this recipe again.

I made this about 10 years ago and lost the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing it! I love this salad!! It does need to set and cool in order for all of the spices to combine perfectly.  I used dried spices except for the cilantro and it came out beautifully.
