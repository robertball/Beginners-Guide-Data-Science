This is in my opinion the perfect blend of flavors...although admittedly, what dish isn't better when you add avocado?  I make this same sandwich often without the grilled chicken.

I made these for lunch today and enjoyed the combination of grilled chicken, avocado and bacon. I used toasted, gluten free bread. I did not use the aioli. Thank you for the recipe.
