It is not necessary to fry- put rumaki in 350 oven and bake until bacon is crisp.  Saves calories and mess

My mom came up with an updated version of this traditional dish that is much more of a crowd pleaser. Even the picky eaters love it, and it's constantly requested. You marinate water chestnuts in the terriyaki-type sauce, then wrap in bacon and skewer with toothpicks to hold. Let the little bundles soak in the sauce for one hour, then bake slowly on a foil-covered broiler pan or cookie rack till the bacon is cooked through (about 45 min at 350). Broil carefully for 5 minutes to caramelize, and serve warm. These are the most requested dish she makes, and please many more people than the traditional version.

I make these frequently, but I've never used these seasonings; I usually just marinate in soy sauce, brown sugar and onion. But this was REALLY good. I don't use livers, just water chestnuts. And a tip for lowering the fat: You can also bake them in a 400 degree oven for about 15-20 minutes. They come out just as good.

The only changes I made was to nuke the bacon 1 minute first, and then I baked at 400 for 20 minutes, turning them once at 10 minutes.  They are great!  Thanks, Dot.

Loved this recipe but used sea scallpts and shrimp instead of chicken livers.  I am just brave enough.  Loved the flavor and will make again and again.

Made this for the big game day at our home. Changed it up a bit, used Turkey liver because it was on sale. No one knew the difference. I also made some with no water chestnuts, just liver and some with no livers just water chestnuts. That way everyone got what they liked. Distinguished them using different colored toothpicks. Made about 75 of them, had only 15 people over, and no leftovers!

A variation of this was taught to me by my godfather and he called it Angels on Horseback.  Same basics - chicken liver and water chestnuts wrapped in bacon.  He marinated them in a 50/50 white wine and low sodium soy sauce for several hours before frying.  Always a hit at our parties.  Only use regular soy if you really really like salty food!

While I took the reviewer's suggestion to bake instead of deep fry, I followed all the rest of the recipe and it turned out fantastic!  Just like I remembered my mom making when I was a kid.  You must have a taste for these but if you do.........YUM!  For the less enthusiastic, made some chestnuts wrapped in bacon without the livers.

I started my collection of savory appetizers with this very recipe.  I had actually forgotten to fix it for several years and see it again here.  Thank you!  Easy and marvelous flavor!  I bake them and the bacon adds the most indescribable flavor.  Enough fat without frying.

My mom made this for every party she had back in the 60's.  I am having a 50's-60's style party for my 50th birthday this year and wanted to find that recipe.  I should have known it would be on Allrecipes.com!  I'm so glad.  Now I can serve it at my Birthday Party!

I make these a lot! Low carb. I use chicken livers (in a container in the meat section of the grocery) cleaned up and cut into small pieces.

Made this for a Christmas appetizer before serving prime rib dinner. Used mini-wieners and water chestnuts so no need to marinade. Baked off rollups (20 min. @ 350) first, then browned them in  a skillet. Removed them and drained remaining bacon grease, then added Teriyaki sauce and spices to skillet to make a sauce. Thickened sauce with cornstarch/water and used to top the rollups. Fabulous!

My guest on the whole liked them.  But it is not what I had remembered......they were not sweet...they  need a sauce and I wish I had not sliced water chestnuts.  Next time I will halve the water chestnuts.  And find a sweeter marinade.  Sorry I was trying to find a recipe from an old memory. This was not it.

I don't marinate at all. I also leave out the water chestnuts since they are brittle and break apart when you try to skewer them with a toothpick and I really don't think they are necessary. I use thin sliced bacon cut in half and the bacon acts as a timer. When the bacon is done then the liver is perfectly cooked. I then lightly salt them and put them into a serving dish and lightly pour a little marinara sauce over top. I find that between the bacon, salt, and marinara sauce that the dish is well seasoned and a tribute to my Italian heritage.
