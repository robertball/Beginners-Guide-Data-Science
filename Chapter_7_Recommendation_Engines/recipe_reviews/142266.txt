I changed this so much, but the basic idea is still there.  Skip the butter and biscuit mix, and instead Get a can of buttermilk biscuit dough and snip it into little pieces.  Roll the pieces in the brown sugar.  I used the same fruit mix but I didn't peel the pears, skipped the rhubarb, and skipped the raisons.  I also added about 1/2 tbl of cin and a splash of vanilla extract.

This was good - I just used fresh fruit I had frozen from the summer - peaches, cherries, blackberries, rhubarb, and blueberries.  Doubled the topping for a 9 x 13 pan as it would have been skimpy for that size pan, especially with tart rhubarb included.  I used it as a side dish for brunch; guests thought it would also be great over vanilla ice cream!

This was really delicious! I added blueberries as well and used veg. shortening instead of margarine/butter. Thank you for sharing.

Just had a serving hot out of the oven.  Delicious with all the fruit flavors.  I made the baking mix from scratch and I decided that next time I may just sprinkle brown sugar although the fruit doesn't need more sweetening.

So easy to make. Low calorie and can be made with or without topping. My daughter is gluten free so I put topping on half and left the rest plain. I think Biscuit has a gluten free variety, so next time I will get that for the topping. I didn't have papaya so I just used a little more of the peaches and pears. I have a lot of peaches and pears left over from our trees and still have rhubarb in the garden so I will freeze a few batches to make around the holidays. Hope it comes out just as good as the fresh fruit. The family loved it.
