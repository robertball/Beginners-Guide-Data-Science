These are great cookies! It is the perfect combination of sweet and salty, chewy and crisp. I've been eyeing this recipe ever since it was published, but with all the fun add-ins, I never really thought I'd have everything around to make them! Then last evening, when my sister and I were trying to come up with something sweet to bring to a church function, we found that we had every single ingredient and could make these exactly as written. They came out perfectly delicious! I would definitely make these cookies again. My sister and I both thought that the addition of raisins would be a good touch, to give them a bit more chewiness. 
For those who thought the dough was very dry: it works best to mix the butter mixture into the flour mixture with your hands. This is a trick I learned in culinary school; your hands are the most effective tool for mixing and combining.
Thanks so much for sharing this recipe; it is a winner and we'll be making them again!

I originally made these and reviewed these when CC had it as a personal recipe in her recipe box.  These are my husband's favorite cookie.  I make them all the time, following the recipe just as written.  I can't imagine anyone claiming that these would be bland with all of the different ingredients that are included.  They are sweet, salty, crunchy, chewy, everything you would want in a cookie.  I will continue to make these frequently and am so glad that this recipe is now "kitchen approved"!

Familiar with cookies of this type, my  suspicion there might be too much flour in this recipe was confirmed when I came across some reviewer reports that the cookies were dry.   To correct and circumvent that potential issue I reduced the flour by a full cup and,  in doing so, I noticed right away the dough  seemed just right.  The resulting cookies were too - full of a variety of flavors and textures,  they were satisfying with every rich, buttery  bite.  (Note: In deference to Hubs' sensitive innards, I omitted the coconut and I think the cookies were better without it anyway)

I was skeptical about using the pretzels so I cooked one batch without them.  Not good.  So, I added the pretzels and while it did help, I still wasn't crazy about these.  They just don't have any distinguishing flavor and are a bit bland.  Sorry.  Also, it seemed like a lot of flour to me and the dough was very dry.  I followed the recipe exactly other than not having quite a full cup of milk chocolate chips so I had to finish the cup with semi sweet.  I don't think that really made much difference...

We loved these at our house.  A substantial cookie that you can easily add your own favourites to.  For my first batch I added raisins and sunflower seeds instead of pecans because of nut allergy.  I used my hands to mix the dough on the advice of a previous review and found the dough easy to work with.  Loved the texture and taste of this cookie...will make again.

These were great! My niece and nephew were over helping me bake and wanted mini m&m's so we used them instead of chocolate chips. They loved these cookies (I think they loved the dough even more!) and they were also popular on my cookie tray.

This isn't a bad recipe, but compared with other wonderful recipes on this website, it just doesn't quite measure up.  When I read the combinations I thought they would be very flavorful!  However the cookies are a little bland.  With the right modifications, I'm sure they could be wonderful.

Lovely flavour in this cookie!  Not a flat cookie.  But lovely textures.  Made as suggested, with the exception of substitution of sunflower seeds for pecans (what I had on hand) YUMMY!

A crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside cookie.  The pretzel and toffee pieces give this cookie some added salty/sweet taste.  I used a small cookie scoop and got 9 dozen cookies.  Perfect amount the function I needed them for.  By making a smaller cookie I baked them for 9 minutes.  A good cookie that I would make again, but next time, my family requested no coconut.

Fantastic!!! The perfect combination of salty and sweet, chewy and crunchy. I didn't have pecans or cereal so I left those out and I also reduced the baking time to 10 minutes for my gas oven. They turned out great!!!

I made this but omitted all the add-ins, except the milk chocolate chips... because I was looking for a cookie with coconut, oats, and rice krispies, and I did not have the other ingredients. This cookie was great! It had just the right texture.

These are wonderful,  Perfect blend of sweet and salty!  Mine came out just a tad crispier than I like,  but I stored them in a Rubbermaid container ovenight and that helped soften them.

Followed the recipe to the letter, but used white chocolate chips in place of milk chocolate.  Ok taste, but VERY dry; even just out of the oven.  I think they'll be like bricks in 24 hours.  Not worthy of a bake sale or even taking to work!  Disappointing!

These cookies are great! I have 2 teenage sons and they won rave reviews with them and my husband. I was looking for something new to try and they hit the spot! The only change I made was to leave out the rice cereal and add an additional cup of oats, terrific!

Probably should not have ground the pretzels and chex mix as fine as I did; made a very dense (hard!) cookie which came out dry....had to knead and form balls as it fell apart when trying to use a spoon.  Hope it will be a good coffee dunker cookie :).  Flavor ok, not a 100% winner, but close.

These are very similar to my husband's favorite cookies from a local bakery.  After reading the reviews and comparing to other oatmeal cookie recipes, I decided to reduce the flour by 1/2 a cup and increase the oats proportionally.  I also added 1 Tbsp of finely ground coffee to make them more similar to the cookies from the bakery.

These are good but a lot going on in this cookie! The texture was as expected for all the add ins. I did use 1/2 cup less flour mostly because I omitted the coconut which I knew would add moisture. It def. was the way to go with the adjustment I made. They looked great, held there shape nicely after baking for exact time stated 12mins. Used a tbs scoop, pressed them down a bit and got 48 cookies!
