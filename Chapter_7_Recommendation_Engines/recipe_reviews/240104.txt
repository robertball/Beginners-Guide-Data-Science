have made this exactly according to recipe a few times, & each 
time came out perfect.  White vinegar is not offensive as it may
sound, but i like to replace it with lemon juice plus a tsp vanilla
(for sweet pies :)    freezes nicely,  very easy recipe

Of course, any gluten free pie crust is going to not be as good as wheat, but that's the price we pay.  For a GF crust, this is way better than any I've tried.  Even my husband was pleasantly surprised, and he's not a GF eater, and usually passes on any baked goods I make GF.  I did not add the sugar, but wish I had. It helps to brown the crust.  That being said, I did something to keep the crust nice and crispy on the bottom, as other crusts I've  made have just been mush after cooking with a fruit filling.  After pressing crust into the pan, I brushed on some egg-white and baked the bottom shell for about 8 minutes in a 400 degree oven.  Immediately after taking out, I put the apples in it and topped with the top crust, which I also brushed with egg white, and sprinkled with sugar.  Nice crust that closely resembled a wheat crust. My husband even said, "MMM, that's good!"   Thank you for the recipe, as I think pie crust is the hardest thing to get right in GF baking.

Worked well. I made this then froze it for two days before thawing and rolling out. I did not add the sugar. The taste is nice, the texture is flaky. Leaving some larger chunks of butter aid in achieving flakiness. I made the whole recipe and it made 2, 8-inch pie crusts. I found the vinegar was a bit strong for my taste. Thank you Sandra LeRose for your recipe.

Pretty good. Based on the ingredients I doubted it would be flaky, as egg invokes cakey, but it is. I cut the recipe in half which was plenty for a single pie bottom crust. You would need to use the full recipe for a bottom and top crust pie.

Used gluten-free flour in place of all the other flours. It was a hit at Thanksgiving. Even people not on a gluten-free diet said it was not any different than regular piecrust.

I have tried at least 15 other recipes. THIS is THE one! This works out beautifully EVERY time! It is my go-to crust and no one has figured out it is gluten-free. I get compliments on it and requests for pies constantly!

Over a year later, still the BEST GF Pie crust!

Made this as the crust for a pumpkin pie.  My gluten-free, dairy-free daughter said it was excellent.

This crust is AMAZING! Next time I think I will do 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter instead of all butter. I did an egg wash for my pie with a sprinkle of sugar.

I make a rhubarb pie with this crust and it was DIVINE. Flaky, golden brown, not dry either.

When I made it I did not have to add any water at all. I recommend using ice water if you need to add water.

Awesome! The first piecrust I've had in 30 years! It's sturdy, flaky,  and delicious. Baked just the shell for 20 minutes or so until lightly browned before finishing with lemon curd and meringue.

I made this for a chicken pot pie and was not impressed. it turned out crumbly. my son-in-law said it had the flavor of a saltine. I had to use more flour because with the eggs and vinegar, it was way to wet. I will try to find another.

We found this tasty yet a bit off. Switched the arrowroot for tapioca flour and it was a way better texture for us.

This is definitely the best free pie crust recipe I've tried - and I've tried a ton over the last decade. This crust turns out light and flaky.

I doubled the recipe and there was too much butter, but otherwise really good!
