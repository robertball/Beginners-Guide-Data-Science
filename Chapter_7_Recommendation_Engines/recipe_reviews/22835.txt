NOt the prettest cookie, but a big hit in my house. My kids can't get enough of these and they don't normally like oatmeal cookies.

I used a subsitute buttermilk suggestion (1tbsp lemon juice and enough milk to make a full cup with both) and used baking powder instead of baking soda.

I also turned the heat down to 350 and cooked a little longer. One last thing... there's no way anyone is going to get 72 cookies out of this! I got a little more then 36 using a teaspoon.

I was looking for a chewy cookie, that is very moist inside.  These are very cake-like and dry.  The batter tastes better than the cooked product.

This recipe makes a very tasty cookie and is easy to double (which you will need to do if you want 72 cookies, I doubled it and almost got 6 dozen).  I made a double batch and left the walnuts out of half and in that half, I added an extra 3/4 cup of raisins.  Very moist and delicious!!

Yummy!  Came on this because I had buttermilk which needed to be used.  These are nice and moist and very tasty.  Makes a smaller amount then indicated but well worth it.

the recipe calls for a 1 tsp salt, but it made the cookies taste salty, I would reduce that measure to 1/4 tsp or omit  the salt altogether.

Absolutely loved these cookies but they are so addictive, I won't make them too often! The cookies are chewy and not dry in the least. I made a half recipe and had to bake twice the amount of time listed, but that is par for the course for my oven. I subbed dates for raisins and pecans and slivered almonds for the walnuts due to what I had on hand. I think I'll also add some shredded coconut next time. Great recipe and very adaptable, thanks for sharing!

Well, I made this recipe with old fashioned steel-cut oats instead of quick cook oats. Quite possibly why the recipe turned out so very dry. I followed everything to a T except that detail.
Honestly, I found the nice cinnamon flavor refreshing, my friends enjoyed the "oatieness" of the cookies, and the dryness can be remedied by dipping bitten cookies into coffee/tea/cognac. So, I think I would try this recipe again, but do them a bit like biscotti and dip them in my morning tea. 

Again, the utter dryness of the cookie was likely due to my substitution of quick cook oats with old fashioned oats.

I did not add nuts. I would not make it again because it was "cake like", then the next day they tasted a bit dry. I stored them in a Tupperware container, with wax paper between layers. This is what I read if wanting the cookies to be crunchy. I'll just keep trying for another oatmeal raisin recipe.

Delicious!  I substituted candied cherries since I was out of raisins.  Really good! I only got 3 1/2 doz out of it though.  I guess I used too big of a spoon

My serving of 72 came down to about 25, i made them a bit larger than expected.  They came out pretty good, i thought a little bland so i added rich and creamy vanilla in the middle of two cookies to make an ice cream sandwhich....delish!

This recipe is a keeper.  I have been searching for a oatmeal raisin cookie that kept its shape.  We love how soft they turned out and the flavor is excellent.  My family does not like nuts in their cookies, so I did omit them.  This is the recipe I will use from now on.

These cookies are great! Very chewy and soft. Raisins work out nicely in them, and the cinnamon is a nice compliment

very tasty and easy to make.  My kids loved them and I made them part of our christmas cookie arrangement.
