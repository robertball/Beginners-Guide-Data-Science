FABULOUS! I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this recipe because there are so few ingredients that go into seasoning the chicken. I expected it to be bland. Was I surprised! I wouldn't change a thing, and I'll definitely be making this again. The salsa is also very flavorful and refreshing. NOTE: There is lime juice listed in the ingredients, but not mentioned in the directions. The juice likely goes in the salsa, but I had omitted it at first since I was following the directions. It wasn't until halfway through my meal that I realized I hadn't used lime juice, then added it to the salsa. I have to say the salsa is good either way. I served the chicken over lime-cilantro rice. Yummy!

Yum, yum!  I love cumin, so the chicken was good, though it would work better to pound the pieces to an even thickness.  But, let me tell you about that salsa!  It was delicious!  I wondered about using cucumbers, I'd never thought about mixing them with avocado.  Something about the crunch, added to the creamy avocado, with a bit of lime juice and salt--this was not just a salsa.  It was a side!  I could easily do this as a salad on lettuce for lunch, even without the chicken.  This will be even better a bit later in the season, when cucumbers are sweeter and tomatoes are at their peak!  Will definitely do again!

This was the single greatest chicken recipe I have ever eaten in my entire life. Followed it exactly. Served the salsa over a rice/quinoa mix. New favorite meal.

Mmmm good! I made 1 1/2 times the avocado salsa and use tenderloins instead of chicken breast since that's what I had in the fridge. We had this for diner with cilantro rice mixed with black beans.

Wow, one of the best recipes I've tried off allrecipes. I can't rave about this dish enough! I served it with cilantro-lime rice (Texmati rice, butter, fresh lime juice, chopped cilantro) and the combination of flavors and textures was out of this world. The avocado salsa MAKES this dish. I seeded both the tomato and the cucumber and it turned out perfectly. This salsa would also be good by itself just eaten with tortilla chips or as a burrito with some black beans and cilantro-lime rice wrapped in a flour tortilla. Just amazing flavors.

This is a nice, light summer recipe.  I just drizzled evoo on thin chicken cutletes and brushed until even, sprinked the seasonings on, and repeated on the other side.  Hubs grilled until crispy.  I prepared the salsa without cuke, just not a fan, and added a drizzle of evoo and squeeze of lime, S & P.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! We used a mixture of chicken thighs and breasts because we have some dark meat lovers in our house. I grilled the chicken on the BBQ instead of frying it in the pan, but used the olive oil lightly brushed on the chicken before rubbing it with the seasonings. I could not find the ground red pepper at my grocery store so I just used red pepper flakes and tried to crush them up as best I could. It was a bit spicy but we love spicy so all was good! I adore avocados so I doubled the avocado in the salsa, and only used a couple of tablespoons of cilantro since I am very sensitive to its strong flavor. Love this dish - the spicy chicken contrasting with the cool and creamy avocados! Delish!

This was a very refreshing dinner for a summer night. Served it with Black Bean and Couscous Salad that I made with pearl barley because I didn't have couscous :)

This was a great lunch. I served this as tacos. I used the lime in both the chicken and added extra to the avocado mixture. Simply yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

Cards on the table: I have to confess that I added a teaspoon of chili powder and a teaspoon of garlic powder to the rub. Also used chicken tenderloins because that is what I had on hand.  This was a wonderful, wonderful dinner!  My roommate doesn't  care for cilantro or onion (I know, crazy, right?) so minus those two things, I mixed everything else together, gave her half and I added the two missing ingredients to mine.  Served with some refried beans and you have a delightful meal.I will be making this again, probably many times in the near and distant future.  I think that this is my favorite recipe I've ever used from allrecipes.com

This dish sounded good, but it turned out to taste great! I can't believe how much flavor the simple rub added. The avocado-based topping was delicious, and just eating that with the rice I cooked up and served under the chicken was tasty, too.

I used some chili powder and a little more seasoning than the recipe calls for, but oh my goodness!  I added a splash of red wine vinegar to the salsa mixture and I cooked the chicken on the grill, but in a foil tray with the olive oil and dripped a little lime juice on it as it cooked. This is a new favorite in my house and I can't wait to make it again. Superb!!

This was outstanding! I made this for my husband and his response was that he didn't deserve a wife that cooked so well - haha! We licked our plates clean, that's for sure. I added some black beans to the salsa because I had some on hand. The recipe is still 5 stars without them. We love eating fresh, healthy and flavorful foods, and this meal goes into our list of favorites. Enjoy!

Can I give this seven stars?   We truly loved this recipe!  I have to admit I was a little unsure if we would like this since the chicken  had so few seasonings, but, it was very flavorful.  I pounded the chicken out to about 3/4" of an inch for even cooking and cooked on medium for about 12 minutes total.   The salsa was the perfect accompaniment.  Don't be hesitant of using the cucumber in the salsa, it really works well with the other flavors.  I served this with cilantro lime rice and black beans.  Fresh and flavorful!

This is so good. I did grill the chicken. We had them fajita style with flour tortilla. Pinto beans on the side. I was inspired by the lovely picture on the front page.

It was a tasty recipe. I made as written but would personally take out the cucumber next time. And I added 2tbsp of lime juice to the salsa which seemed a bit much.  Might add it to the cooking chicken next time. Took quite a bit longer to cook the chicken breast thoroughly. Nice flavorful dish that everyone enjoyed.

This was delicious and so easy to make. Perfect to make on a warm summer night when it's just too hot to turn the oven on. I did leave out the cilantro in the salsa because I just don't like it. I really liked the chicken the most---you'd think that only salt, pepper, and cumin wouldn't amount to much, but it really does! This recipe is proof that food doesn't have to be complicated to be good!

Amazing. I added fresh corn-on-the-cob (well, cut-off-the-cob-and-chilled) and half a can of rinsed black beans and everyone loved it. It's hard, but this recipe has cracked the dinner rotation. Sorry, but it was gone too fast to get a picture!

pounded the chicken out thin, used 1/ 2 of the cayenne- quick and delicious.  A lot of times we'll double the salsa for 4 breasts

Also have made the chicken breasts rubbed with oil and spices, then baked 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then flipped for around 15 minutes until 165

This was amazing. My boyfriend couldn't even taste the cucumber. It is a very balanced salsa. The only change that I made was to double the spices to have enough rub for 4 chicken breasts. Delicious!

The dish is absolutely delicious and I didn't change a thing except the onions. I used sweet onions the first time instead of purple and preferred that flavour. I even make the salsa to eat with chips as a healthy snack!

This was AMAZING!!  I wish I had doubled it for leftovers.  My husband and I fought over the last piece of chicken.  I made lime cilantro rice to go with it and it was devoured.  Super easy with readily available ingredients.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe served as an excellent base recipe (I didn't have all of the ingredients so had to adapt a bit).

One trick I use with cumin is to use cumin seeds and toast them for a minute or two in a pan, then grind. It tastes so much better than ground cumin you buy.

Amazing! Hubby and I devoured this dish.  Served it with cilantro lime rice.  Quick, easy and tastes so fresh and yummy!  Can you tell we loved it :)

Update: Made a double batch of just the salsa to take to a party.  Served it with tortilla chips.  It was a huge hit!  Everyone wanted to know "Who made the salsa!"

Awesome!!  Was easy to prepare. I used what I had on hand. Instead of chicken breast. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I used cumin, paprika and salt for the rub.  For the salsa I omitted the cilantro because my family finds it to strong. I didn't have a lime so I used lemon instead. Was delicious! Will be one of my go to recipes!!

This has become one of my favorite dinners! I usually double the salsa and serve with brown rice.
