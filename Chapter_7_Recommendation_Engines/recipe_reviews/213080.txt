I made a few alterations based upon what I had on hand & to make it a little healthier: Substitute 1 15oz. can chicken broth for wine & 3tps whole wheat flour & milk with 3 tps fat free cream cheese for cream. I added a few veggies like green peppers & mushrooms to the dish. Was really good!

This was just okay.  It was just too bitter even with the sweet sausage.  I added 1/2 tsp basil which helped, but I think doubling the cream would be good.  I didn't have any more so I added 3 TBS sour cream instead.  I think that it's the red wine that pushes it over the top.

Very good but the sauce does need thickening...  I drained my diced tomatoes and added a little tomato paste and cornstarch to thicken a bit. I also added just a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  I opted for penne vs. linguine as that's what I had on hand. I garnished it with a little parsley, served it with garlic bread and a fresh garden salad!

My family, even my picky four-year-old loved it! I used chicken broth instead of wine, and added the parmesan to the sauce to aid in thickening. Definitely a keeper!

I used the tomato basil chicken sausage and we really enjoyed this.  I will make this again as a regular rotation.  It was good even with out the sausage.  Everyone in our house asked for this again so thats 5 stars.

I also used the chicken broth in place of the wine.  The wine would have given it a much richer flavor.   The sauce was way to thin, but you could use cornstarch to thicken it.   Overall, it was good flavors!

Very nice flavors in this recipe. The sauce seemed very thin per the recipe so I cooked it down further than instructed. I think you could also use the Roasted Pepper & Asiago sausage in this one as well.

This is really 3.5 stars:)  We liked it but we didn't love it.  The wine really did give it good flavor.  And we really like the chicken sausage too.

DISCLAIMER- this review is based on the end result from the changes I made based on what I had on hand. This is not a review of the recipe as printed.
My family LOVED this- first of all, we used Al Fresco's chicken sausage with garlic/roasted peppers as it was what was available. Second, instead of making the sauce, I used a jar sauce with the same ingredients as it was convenient. I added the cream as the recipe dictated and it was wonderful. Third, I used penne instead of linguine. The sauce tasted so good I wanted a pasta that would suck up the sauce. Lastly, I did not add wine. I was concerned it would not burn off in time for my kiddos.
I cannot say enough about the Al Fresco chicken sausage. It was so good and there was only one serving left for my husband. I used an entire jar of tomato, garlic and onion spaghetti sauce as the base and with the cream added- it gave off an incredible smell. My kids were licking their plates and looking for more. Please do try this recipe either as posted or with my alterations. Either way.. I don't think you will be disappointed. The parm and the oregano seasoning at the end is truly crucial. Enjoy!

I made this recipe as given and I can only rate it 3 stars because it needs some tweaking.  First of all, 2 minutes to saute 1 cup onions isn't long enough.  Also the sauce is too thin and not enough for four servings.  Plenty of sausage, just not enough sauce.   It doesn't stick to the pasta but sits at the bottom of the bowl.  I did however like the al fresco Italian Chicken Sausage as it has a lot of flavor.

This was really tasty. I did have to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand.  1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce for the diced tomatoes and plain old milk for the cream.  Used chianti for the red wine. Yummy.

This is pretty yummy! The only changes I made was adding a little extra garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes. The sausage was sweet and delicious too! I will be making this again as my family loved it!

YUMMY!  This was absolutely perfect!!!!  I didn't use the suggested sausage, I used one from Whole Foods, with feta and artichokes in it.  I added mushrooms and everything else left the same.  Perfect!!!

We thought this is a fabulous dish! I really didn't change the recipe except to add in a bit more onion and garlic because that's how we roll. Great recipe!

First words out of my hubby's mouth was "what kind of sausage is this.  It's yummy".  Have to say though that the sauce needed a little something so I added a little Cajun seasoning.  Really hit the mark.

My husband and I loved this.  I used chicken stock instead of wine, and used Hillshire Farms hardwood smoked Sausage.  I added diced red and green peppers for extra veggies and color.  I also added cornstarch to thicken up.  Great flavor.

It was wonderful.  My husband and kids raved over it and it was very easy to make.  My husband even wanted me to make it for his mom!  I did use white wine instead of red and it was still yummy!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I made a few modifications. I used chicken broth instead of the wine and fat-free half and half instead of cream. I added 1 oz lowfat cream cheese, mushrooms and a handful of sun-dried tomatoes. Yummy!

I thought this was great. However was skepitcal on a couple of parts where it said table cream & this over all thickness of the dish.. I honestly didn't realize until afterwards, it was just cream and felt like a dork. I used half & half and had to use one of the Al Fresco Sausages in the line I felt closest to the recipe, due to availability in my area. Overall, I felt it was light a not heavy...and the sauce reminded me of pizza. Which all liked. Will make again, however will try 1/2 cup of cream cheese in place of the table cream for thickness. Thanks so much.

I made this recipe as is except used whole milk instead of table cream.  It was simply delicious.  Don't leave out the fresh oregano - it really makes the dish.

I don't like big hunks of sausage with my pasta so after cooking the sausage, I ran it through the food processor to resemble hamburger.  I used home canned plain tomatoes and added dried basil instead of oregano (just a taste preference).  I also didn't use linguine but any pasta will do.  This is a good recipe.  Thanks!

Tried this recipe for the second time and LOVED it.  Let me caveat that I made the tomato cream sauce exactly as the recipe dictated and it was perfect...now where the grilled chicken comes in...I made homemade ravioli stuffed with the chicken sausage pureed with ricotta cheese.  LOVED this!!!

I made a double recipe using three 12-oz. packages of sausage. The sauce was a little thin, but tasted very good. If I make this again, I'll mix the linguine with the sauce and let it sit a while so the linguine soaks up the sauce. I served this with homemade baguettes and a tossed salad. My family enjoyed it.

Made recipe exactly as written with the exception of adding some salt.  I would prefer that the sauce be a little thicker.  The Sweet Italian Chicken Sausage had too much fennel for our taste.  Each guest sprinkled fresh grated Parmesan according to their preference.  Thanks al fresco(R) for the free coupon.

DELIGHTFUL!  We really enjoyed this.  I added a little basil and thickened with a bit of cornstarch.  Otherwise, followed as written.

Made minor alteration based on personal preference. Used fresh basil instead of oregano, plain canned tomatoes instead of seasoned and omitted the red wine . Added 1TB sugar to cut the acidity from the tomatoes. Used whole wheat linguine also. We loved it.

This is a nice dish and very easy to make.  I love that the sauce didnâ€™t overpower the delicious flavor of the sausage, however I think it could have used a little more zip.

This was actually quite good, and the aroma as it was cooking was tantalizing!  I subbed fresh basil for the oregano (personal preference) and half and half for the cream.  I will do this again!

This was a wonderful dish.  I did make a few minor changes.  I used Italian sausage instead and browned them on the stove(too cold out to grill). I also added some yellow peppers, onion and extra garlic(as many suggested) and I sauteed them in the drippings from the sausage.  I would definitely double up the sauce next time.  I did add cornstarch, as suggested. This is a definite make again, thank you for sharing.

I also used chicken broth instead of wine but followed the rest of the recipe. The sauce was more like a soup. Way too thin. It had a good flavor but needs to be thickened up. I would make again but probably strain the tomatoes and use heavier cream.

We really enjoyed the grilled flavor of the sausage, which I kept whole per hubs request. I did add a bit more garlic and I used fresh Oregeno, basil and tomatoes. I used the red wine but I let it reduce down a bit. It tasted great. We will eat this again using the fresh ingredients.

I made this today for lunch. I couldn't find the right sausage, so I used Roasted Pepper & Asiago with Mesquite Smoke sausage. I couldn't find diced tomatoes with Italian herbs, so I had to use Rotel which has green chilies in it. The sauce was too thin for my liking, so I added 1/4 cup cold water mixed with 1 Tb. cornstarch right at the last & just heated until sauce thickened. I also used cooking sherry instead of wine.

This was amazing! My husband doesn't like new dishes & he is usually meat & potatoes. I had a chicken breast & a whole other meal ready to cook him. He tasted this & said, "I think that's a meal in itself." I said it was supposed to be but I thought you wouldn't eat it. Did I mention he doesn't like anything with heat in it, like Rotel or he doesn't like noodles? He loved this & told me to put the chicken up, he was eating this. This will be a favorite of ours now. Thanks Al Fresco!

The red wine colored the grilled sausage red, made it look like blood sausage.. other than that, it was pretty good.. next time I may use white wine to preserve the natural color of the sausage.

I really liked this sauce! I usually do white or red sauce, and the combination of the two was refreshing and easy to make. I ended up using spiral noodles, because I already had them on hand. I will definitely make this again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, I used chicken broth instead of wine, and added in some sauteed portabella mushrooms.  I think grilling the sausage is the key to this recipe...it gives it great flavor!  I am a huge fan of al fresco now!!!!  This is my second review, I also add in 2 tablespoons of fresh grated parmesan reggiano cheese and top with sliced black olives, it goes great with crusty garlic bread!

This was very good. It did need a little bit of salt. Also thought the sauce was to thin so I under cooked my pasta and finished it in the sauce. I would make this again but I would drain the tomatoes.

Even I, a self proclaimed sausage hater (it's a black pepper/fennel thing), thoroughly enjoyed this.  I also enjoyed that it was super quick and easy to prepare since we'd already pre-grilled the sausage earlier in the week.  The only change I made was to add a dash of Italian Seasoning since I belatedly realized my diced tomatoes were sans seasoning.  I used a Cupcake Merlot for my "dry red".  This recipe is def worth a try!  THANKS, Al Fresco!

This was a very good dish. The sauce was flavorful and blended well with the chicken sausage.
I did take the advice of other reviewers and added a couple tsp of corn start to thicken it up. Otherwise it would have been way too thin. 
I also used chicken broth instead of red wine.
It turned out great.

I thought this was ok, the sauce was too thin though.  My husband, however, did not like it.  He thought the sausages contain far too much fennel seed, overpoweringly strong even.  I'll try them another way and see if he feels the same, but he has asked me to buy a different flavor next time.

This was pretty tasty, although it was nothing memorable. The cabernet that I used made the sauce an unattractive color when it mixed with the tomatoes. I let the sauce simmer about 20 minutes before adding the cream to allow it to thicken. I also found myself smooshing the tomato chunks to help with the thickening. It came out nice, the flavor was good and we all enjoyed it. My DD complained it was a little too sweet. I'm not sure if that was from the sausage or the cream.

Yummy!! The whole family raved over this.  It will be a keeper for me.  The only thing I did different, was to add mushrooms.  Others had said that mushrooms made it even better, and I had a lot of them that needed to get used up.

This was excellent! I did need to thicken it b/c it was waaaay too watery, but other than that, I followed the recipe. LOVED the flavors of this and think it would be wonderful w/ the addition of some mushrooms, which I plan to try next time. Hubby nd the little guy loved this too...a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This sausage is so good. My family loved that it was very flavorful with our being too sweet or too intense. My kids loved it!  I used a 12 oz package of sausage (that's what was on the shelf) and it seemed like a lot so 16oz would definitely have been too much.  Can't wait to use this in other things.

I did puree all but 1/4 cup of the sauce before adding the sausage because my husband is not a fan of chunks of onion or tomato.  Also I added 1T of cornstarch to thicken it.  Based on the reviews and the type of wine I had on hand I did 1/4c of red wine and 1/2c of low sodium chicken broth.

We loved the Al Fresco sausages and this was a great dish. In the future I might completely eliminate the cream to make it healthier and prettier-looking. I don't care much for the pinkish hue that the cream mixed with the tomatoes create. It is delicious, regardless, but I will probably skip it when I make this dish again.

Anyway, I made slight changes to the recipe.  after sauteeing the onions and garlic, I added basil and 1/2 cup of red wine bc that was all I had.  Let it cook until most of the wine had cooked off, then added 1c of chicken broth, only one can of whole tomatoes in natural juices, cut in pieces, and a cup of milk mixed with 2tblsp of sour cream.  let that all cook on low until the pasta was done, then mixed it all together with the cheese in the pot, covered it and let it sit about 10 minutes.  This let the pasta absorb a lot of the sauce.  Delicious!

Way too much red wine! As soon as I added the cream it curdled.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe and went back for seconds. We donâ€™t have a grill, so I cut up the sausage and sautÃ©ed in olive oil instead of grilling.

Very good!  I used a bit of corn starch in the cream to help thicken the sauce to avoid the runny sauce many reviewers complained about...no runny sauce here.  I also used fettuccine noodles as that is all I had one hand.  Added a few mushrooms when the garlic was added for an additional flavors component.  Everything came together quickly and we had an enjoyable meal that will be repeated again.

This was good and I will make again.  I made a couple changes.  I browned the sausage sliced then put back in when sauce was almost done to finish cooking and I used half & half.

I did not like the sauce at all.  It was overpoweringly flavored with red wine.  I made a similar recipe with no red wine, and it was quite good.  I will not make this recipe again.

I always add a bit of sugar to any Italian dish, to cut the acidity. But other than that, I leave these recipes alone, so I can rate it, as-is.

Loved this, it was so easy! I used Johnsonville Italian Sausage. It was cold out, so rather than grilling, I took them out of their casings, chopped them up and sautÃ©ed them with the onions and garlic. I also chopped up some mushrooms that needed to be used up and threw them in for a couple of minutes. I didn't have tomatoes with Italian seasoning, so I just added some from my Italian seasoning grinder.  I used half and half, because that is what we had. My fiancÃ© loved it too. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good.  I followed the recipe with only a couple of changes to substitute ingredients I didn't have.   I used half and half bc I didn't have light cream on hand.  I used Bogle merlot for the wine and basil instead of oregano.  I shredded Parmesan right into the sauce and let it melt in.  I used Pastene pasta nests for the pasta and a roasted garlic and gruyere cheese chicken sausage.  Since it was a precooked sausage I didn't grill it, I just sliced it and heated it in the sauce.  Next time I make this I will add some fresh baby Bella mushrooms.  This was a quick, easy recipe and delicious to boot!  Definitely a keeper!

I used canned diced tomatoes with basil and oregano. I added less than a half-cup of red wine. Finally added the cooked bow-tie noodles to the other ingredients, heated through and served it as a one-pot meal.  My family loved it.

I've made it a couple of times and it has always been delicious.  I haven't tried any variations because I like it so much as it is.

Despite the pictures of this dish not looking all that amazing, this recipe is really good. My boyfriend likes Gerber chicken sausages and I usually don't, so when he bought a pack of them recently I went in search of recipes that would involve something other than eating them like bratwurst on a bun. I had most of the ingredients for this, so I decided to make it. I substituted the Gerber spicy Italian chicken sausages, which are raw so I had to par-boil them before putting them on the grill. I also only had white wine so I used that instead of red, and I used an Italian seasoning blend instead of just oregano. I let the wine and tomato juice cook down a bit before adding the cream, since I could tell it was going to be on the thin side. I also added the parm right into the sauce to help thicken it and then just tossed in the linguine. The sauce was still a bit thin, but I would definitely make this again! Maybe more cream

I had half a can of table cream in my fridge to use up, found this recipe. Bought the exact same sausage and other ingredients were same as the recipe (wine was Pinot Noir.) Small thing I did different (because we prefer sausage slightly browned on all sides) was cut the sausage up first, started frying them with 2 tsp oil on high in a pan a couple minutes while I diced the onion, then added onion (didn't need more oil), cooked until onions were soft. Also my sauce simmered a bit longer, perhaps 8 minutes, until the noodles were done. Plus used at least double Parm cheese on top as we love cheese. Very tasty dish, incorporating the slightly-sweet sausage with pasta & sauce. (Much nicer than serving the sausage plain with a side dish.)

Texture was way too thin, even after something for 20 minutes to reduce, had to use cornflour.
I also thought the wine taste was overpowering, and had to add about 1/4c tomatoe puree, 2tsp sugar and a chicken stock cube to even the flavour a little. I don't think I'll be making this again.
