What I loved about this was the colors and how healthy it is. You can really add whatever veggies you have on hand. The Parmesan Cheese Crisps were wonderful! I make them often to top soups. What I didn't like was that it was a bit bland. There wasn't even salt and pepper in this. If I make this again I would definitely add salt, pepper, garlic and if I'm feeling a little crazy, red pepper flakes. I would also probably cut the grape tomatoes in half so they give up some of their juice while cooking.

I've made this several times and the one addition that lifts it over the top is a fair-sized dollop of pesto.  It makes a superb vegetarian main course, delicious and satisfying.  If you're in a rush, you can just add the Parmesan cheese instead of making the crisps, without sacrificing flavor.

Used whole wheat gnocchi and added yellow squash, red bell pepper, green onions, whole garlic cloves and a little red pepper.  Didn't have parm cheese so we just used mozzarella and it was great!

I put in a full 8 oz. bag of cherry tomatoes, cut in half, and 8 oz. of mushrooms.  For more flavor I crumbled half a minicube of Knorr Chipotle seasoning over the combined ingredients (my favorite seasoning).  It turned out really good, with raves from my wife.  Thanks to PamMar for the suggestions.

I made this recipe with Trader Joe’s Cauliflower Gnocchi!  I put the gnocchi on paper towels in the microwave for three minutes to get some of the moisture out of it, then sautéed and browned the gnocchi for about 10 minutes at medium to medium high heat stirring often.  Instead of making the Parmesan pancakes, I sprinkled the Parmesan over the top at the end.  Yummy!  Will definitely make it again!

I thought that I would be missing a sauce or something, but this was honestly pretty great as is. I added some garlic salt and some white wine to the mushrooms while they cooked but otherwise didn't change a thing.

I was looking for something to use up some potato gnocchi and found this recipe.  I cooked the gnocchi separate but cooked everything else in the same pan together.  I left out the tomatoes and pine nuts and added some sliced ham.  I just sprinkled the cheese on afterward and let it melt on top of everything in the pan.  I added some salt, pepper and fresh oregano along with the basil.   My husband and I really liked the flavor - would make again.

The recipe was ok. I liked the very detailed instructions and the idea of the recipe. I used packaged whole wheat gnocchi and that may have been a large reason for my dissatisfaction. Based on the other reviews I added chopped scallions, garlic and mixed color bell peppers. I only had cherry tomatoes so used those cut in fourths.  I also added salt and pepper.  It was a very attractive and the flavor was ok- but something was still missing. I made the Parmesan crisps, but they didn't seem to go ( they seemed greaser making them this way, I have made the on parchment paper in oven and liked the result better). I wonder if adding the cheese to the veggie mix might have been better. Also maybe a dash of balsamic.
