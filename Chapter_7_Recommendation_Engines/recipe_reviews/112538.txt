I totally disagree with the other review. I just made this and it was so convenient and delicious. I loved it and will definitely make it again. It's better than turning on the oven, especially this time of year, and it cooked nicely without having to watch it and worry about it bubbling over. The key is convenience and my husband, who is Italian, loved it also. Thank you!

I used the oven ready noodles, so no need to cook them first. I also added extra italian spices and did not add the eggs. It was awesome! I plan to make again soon.

I love this recipe. I have a large family & we love lasagna, but don't make it often enough due to getting off work at 5. i let it cook all day & dinner is ready when i get home. besides the slow cooker uses less energy than the oven & doesn't heat ur kitchen up.

I'm sure that this one is really good.  I don't use that many types of cheese. My suggestion is to use oven-ready lasagna noodles.  All you have to dirty is one pan for the ground beef and the crockpot.  Yeah, I know, I hate doing dishes!

I used my own way of making the sauce and use the no boil noodles however I did use the recipe for the layering and on the cheese mixture. I used more sauce then the recipe called for and took the lid off my slow cooker for about 20 minutes while the bread was cooking in the oven so it would thicken up fully. It turned out better than when I make in the oven. Will make in slow cooker again- thanks for the idea!!!

Great recipe, still the work of a traditional lasagna but with the ability to assemble it ahead of time and put in in the crock pot so dinner is ready and hot when you get home.   I assembled it on Sunday and set my crock pot to turn on 3 hrs before I got home.  I cooked it on high and it was perfect, not mushy at all!!!

I followed the directions exactly, but this did not turn out as good as I had hoped.  When it got finished cooking it was missing most of the sauce so I will try it again adding extra sauce toward the end of the cooking time.

I loved this recipe!  This was delicious!  My husband made it today.  He had just a few alterations.  He used no-boil noodles, which made preparation easier.  He cut back on the amount of mozzarella on the top layer by quite a bit, using just about 2/3 cup of a mozzarella/ parmesan mix rather than a full 2 cups of mozzarella.  He sprinkled the cheese on top with a mixture of marjoram, thyme, and a small amount of fennel.  We loved it.  I loved the amount of sauce in it, and felt it was not too runny.  We will make this a staple!

True you do have to do a lot of work but then you can set it on the counter and have dinner ready when you get home. I put together the night before then put in the refrigerator and turned the slow cooker on in the morning. It tasted really good just like Lasagna. The only suggestion I have is using cottage cheese in place of ricotta cheese.

I did not believe I could really make a tasty lasagne. quite rich with all those cheeses and all this riccotta, but sooo worth it! Hubby worked double second and third shift and I left portioned containers in the fridge. he'd eat it at 5am with love and indulgence and had a great deep sleep afterwards! Great recipe, though I'd still love to figure out how to get all those scrumptious layers clean out of a 5 quart slow cooker to serve so it looks as delicious as it tastes!

This recipe was great! I switched ricotta to cottage cheese and parmesan to asiago just because we like those cheeses!  I added a bit more sauce (as suggested by others). It set up well, (eggs really help with that)and cooked all day while I played taxi :) My one change would be to cook the ground beef with some garlic, onion and spices. I loved that it wasn't greasy or sloppy AND I didn't have to wait for it to cook!

i thought this recipe was great.  i am not a big fan of store bought sause, i usually make my own.  i thought this was a great way to make lasanga without having to make my own sauce.  we have a large family and it was good size for us.  there was even a battle the next day who could have the little bit of leftovers for lunch.  i would definitely make this again.

I loved this recipe. I substituted mont.jack cheese for the ricotta and added an extra 14 oz or so of sauce but did the remainder exactly as called for.  I cooked it for 4 hours on high and it was very very good!

I cooked this lasagna Sunday night. I spent to long at the grocery store and decided to place in the oven instead of the slow cooker. It turned out really good. Definitely better than any frozen lasagna. I did 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground turkey Italian sausage and a lot of Italian seasoning. I will definitely be trying with my slow cooker.

This was my first lasagna! I loved it and so did my family. I used the ready cooked noodles and doubled the pasta sauce, and I was surprised how well it held up and was easy to remove from the pot. The only suggestion to the author is they did not mention where in the layering to add the gound beef. I have never made lasagna before so little details like that matter.

I love this recipe. I did make change as I did not want all of the cheeses, but want the wonderful taste from the slower cooker. I put sauce on the bottom then noodles, pepperoni, mozzarella cheese and then sauce ending up with noodles and sauce on top. About half hour before ready I add some more mozzarella cheeese on top. (I did not use ground beef). There is such a wonder taste to this no matter what your taste is. Thanks Lora.

This is the only kind of lasagna I've ever made and we love it! It's so quick and easy and I love I can just set it and forget about it for awhile without risking burning it. We always increase the meat (we've used hamburger, sausage and venison) and cheese just a little (so there's plenty of leftovers) and only use one egg. I do have one tip to cut down on the cook time. We use oven-ready noodles and only have to cook this for 4 hours on low. I can't imagine cooking it for 8-9 hours!

I tried this for New Years Eve and the noodles wound up being too overcooked and gummy.  I won't use a crock pot for lasagna again.  I guess I will have to buy a pyrex transporter for next year.

This was my first ever to make lasagna in a slow cooker.  Why on earth did I wait so long?  It is so simple and easy.  I sprayed the slow cooker with cooking spray, boiled the noodles and drained.  I combined 1/2 pound of HOT pork sausage and 1/2  pound of lean ground chuck, fried until brown and drained the grease.  I added the spaghetti sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of Italian Seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon of Thyme.  I used Part Skim Milk Ricotta, 2 cups Part-Skim Mozzarella and 1 cup of fresh grated Parmesan and 1 egg. Layered as per instructions and cooked on High for 2 hours.  I loved that I was able to assemble, turn on the slow cooker and forget about it.  Delicious and will definitely make this way again!  Thanks Lora for sharing your recipe!

It was okay. Pretty dry. I will have to use the other half-jar of sauce when I plate this every time. I did change it slightly by using cottage cheese instead of ricotta (it's what I had on hand) and penne pasta instead of lasagna noodles. Easy to make and nice that I can do it on *my* schedule instead of frantically trying to get it done when everyone's ready for dinner. Will try again, next time adding two full jars of sauce.

It works for a crock pot version of lasagna. I think it was a bit bland, and if and when I do it again, it needs some garlic added to the cheese mix, and some oregano, maybe basil. Also, I never seem to have enough cheese mix once I start layering, I don't know if its just me, or what. I would have doubled that part. Also, I DON'T recommend going with a cheap jar of sauce. Get something good.

I used the oven ready noodles.  It was a bit dry after cooking on low for 8 1/2 hours.  We cook for a shorter amount of time next time.

This lasagna is very good, easy to make, the only thing I did differently was add Italian Seasoning to it. I will definately make this again!

I thought this was pretty good, but it was a little dry for my tastes.  My husband liked it more than my regular lasagna, my son liked it less. Made it exactly like the recipe.  Had to peel the cheese off the top and dispose of it...was like leather!  If I make it again, I will add cheese near the end and cook it less time....maybe 6-7 hours?

Excellent flavor,  I increased the sauce to 3 jars, using 4 cheese, mushroom & Basil marinara.  Browned onion & garlic. with ground sausage and layered it in the crock pot.  Next time I will not leave it on high the recommended time it scorched the bottom.  The family inhaled the entire pot within 24 hours.  So much for freezing some for later.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated, other than it cooked on low for 8 hours since I was at work. The bottom of it was way overdone and instead of being crispy and yummy, it tasted really burnt. It's unusual as I cook in my slow cooker at least once a week and haven't had this issue with a sauce on the bottom. 

If I make this again I will definitely make it on a weekend where I can watch it after 4-5 hours to determine if it's done so it won't overcook again. Unfortunately the "burnt" taste was evident on the top as well.

This was awesome! I did use about a half cup more sauce then was called for, and next time I will add garlic powder. But overall, it was great -- I'll never make lasagna in the oven again!

I thought this was really good, and very easy!!  I basically followed the recipe, but I used ground turkey and no-boil noodles.  I liked the ease of no-boil, but since you are making this in an oval crockpot, I had to break up the hard noodles like puzzle pieces to fit them in, so perhaps using boiled noodles would be better so they can be soft and shape to fit the crock.  Other than that, I added a 1/2 chopped sweet onion, minced garlic, and some seasoning to the meat/sauce mixture.  Made some garlic bread and it was a great meal...will definitely make again!!

I am not a big lasagna fan, but this was pretty good.  I did use more sauce (2 jars) than it called for since other times when making lasagna, they never have enough sauce.  Was drier the second day, so could use even more sauce.  Others who like lasagna really liked it.

I agree with the convenience of the slow cooker.  I prepared it and put it in my casserole slow cooker, went to work and it was ready when I got home.  I didn’t boil my lasagna noodles.  I placed in hot water while I cooked the meat and meat sauce then shook dry.  The lasagna noodles were perfect  and not overcooked which I was afraid they may have been if I cooked on low for that many hours with cooked noodles.   You can easily tweak the sauce to your taste preference or use your own.  Very versatile.  Loved walking into the house after a long day at work to smell this cooking and ready to eat.

This turned out almost perfect. I put the noodles in uncooked, omitted the eggs and didn’t mix the cheeses to save time. The only change I would make for next time is using three jars of sauce instead of two.

I followed the recipe adding a little extra sauce at the end.  I like my lasagna with more sauce than most.  Very good.  My 80 year old picky mother enjoyed it (of course she said more sauce also) but ate the whole thing.  I used the no boiling Barillo pasta to save time.  Still very good.  I made it the night before and put it on low about 1pm eating at 630.  Perfect!

I followed the recipe until it came time to layer it. Layering it I improvised based on how I would want my lasagna to be and it turned out great. I was even able to use the left over noodles for dinner the next night.

So I cooked mine on low for 8 hours and the top and sides are burnt! Scraped the top and sides off but still can taste the burnt. ?? in the middle appears to be good. So that's why I gave it 2 stars. If you cook for less than says you may be good. But 8-9 on low doesn't work.

This was the easiest way to cook a lasagne. The noodles do not need to be pre cooked. Break the noodles up to fit the slow cooker pot. I only needed to cook it for 4 hrs at Low. It was awesome and all stayed together.

Good, pretty quick and simple recipe. When I make it again, I will increase the sauce and meat mixture, maybe even double. It was pretty rich and thick with the cheese mixture (and this is coming from a cheese lover!). And I have a large slow cooker, so with this volume I was only able to get two layers of noodles. I may also change it up from time to time with spinach or other veggies. 
All in all good for the effort involved. Our AC does not keep up well in the middle of summer, so it is nice to have real meal options without involving the oven.

my family loved it!!  yes the traditional lasagna make and bake is after but I liked putting it in the crock pot and cooking it that way.  i used the noodles that you don't have to boil first.  they are are so easy.  I used 1 large can of whole tomatoes and cheddar cheese too.  it was delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.

It was just okay,  will not make again, Not a good recipe to be able to fix and leave.  Plus having to pre-cook the pasta, might as well make my classic lasagna. Had I made this on a day when I wasn't  home to keep a check on it, it would have been a total loss even cooking on low.

I used a bit more sauce, with a jar of Classico Tomato-Pesto and a garden vegetable pasta sauce, and found that it was plenty ready on the low setting after 4.5 hours. Save some cheese to add at the very end, versus putting it all on to bake from the very beginning.

Very tasty.  It's actually worth the extra time/steps needed to prepare.  *Tips to save time -- use oven-ready noodles (see cooking time recommended below) and also use already made meat sauce (just defrost if frozen).

I made it with oven-ready noodles and they worked fine.  Although, I would reduce the cooking time to Low for 6 hours (I made it for 8 and a little bit too soft).  I also omitted the eggs and didn't miss them.

I recommend that your sauce be equal parts liquid and chunky (mine was a bit too chunky -- I like it with lots of veggies).

I am also going to try it with cottage cheese next time. I enjoyed the ricotta however, I prefer my family's tradition of cottage cheese.

Bottom line...a very hearty and delicious lasagna.  Perfect for those needing to prep for dinner and walk away.

I really liked this recipe. My husband and kids also really liked it.  It did seem that I did not have enough meat and sauce for my layers (5)  so used 1 1/2 lbs. of sausage instead of ground beef. I also added a layer of spinach on top of each layer of ricotta mix.   Very tasty!

I am giving this recipe four starts only because I love the slow cooker concept and the cheese sauce was fantastic. I feel like this recipe is bland. I used my own sauce recipe. One can mushroom pasta sauce, one can three cheese pasta sauce ( the recipe made the lasagna very dry), an onion, a green bell pepper, and two cans of stewed tomatoes. I ended up only using half of the noodles from a single box. Like I said the cheese sauce was great. I added more ricotta because it comes in a sixteen oz container. As I said make the tomato sauce your own, plane old tomato sauce makes for a boring lasagna!

We made this while camping.  Everyone loved it.  I assembled it in the morning and when dinner time came around dinner was ready to go.  I substituted oven ready noodles.
