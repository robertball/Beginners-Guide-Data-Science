This is really good.  All the adults who have tried it loved it.  None of the kids (teens) will even taste it!  But  they won't taste a lot of foods that are new to them!  I made a lot of it and it will probably last into at least part of the fall/winter season.

Simply perfect and glad to see it online.  Did this in England and then in Michigan and then in Georgia.  A few minor differences but basically the same Betty, very good my Dear.

this was too runny for my liking, so I took a good portion of the liquid off the top before canning and bottled it as a sweet and sour sauce. Turns out that the sweet and sour sauce was the most popular part in my household. However, friends who I shared the chutney with did like it and are hoping I'll make it again if this year's tomato crop doesn't get the chance to ripen before frosts set in.

I omitted the cauliflower.  I also purred mixture before I added the flour/spice mixture.  I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.

Used large yellow, roma and three colors of cherry tomatoes instead of green and increased all spices by about 30%. Next time iwill add chilli. Absolutely recommend this recipe.

Never made chutney before and all I can say it was very yummy, made a curry that was a bit bland put some of the chutney in it and it was very tasty.

Turned into lumpy large dumplings as it hit the simmering tomato mixture.
