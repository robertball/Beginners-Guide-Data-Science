Loved it, with a few modifications.  Don't use as much broth as called for; I used about half.  I also added a splash of cream towards the end.  I sauteed a clove of garlic along with the peppers and onions.  I added dried basil and oregano.  And I added about two handfuls of shredded parmesan cheese to the sauce just before serving.  It was DELICIOUS.

WOW!  My husband and I love this recipe (with a little tweeking).  My husband is a meat guy but still likes this recipe.  We add a little more red pepper flakes to spice it up a little more to suit our taste.  One thing I have found that does make a difference is the pasta you use.  I highly recommend Buitoni 4 cheese pasta because when I have used other pasta, it was still good, just not great.

Excellent dish with just the right spices.  I  used sweet peppers, not the traditional bell peppers.  I also used less chicken broth and added a touch more red pepper flakes for some added zing. I used asparagus and cheese ravioli instead of plain cheese ravioli also which was excellent! My boyfriend absolutely loved this dish!

This turned out very good.  My partner and I had this with leftover pizza, it was a perfect match. I used vegetable broth as I'm vegetarian, and added a couple of cloves of crushed garlic.  For taste, I tossed some basil flakes and let a sprig of rosemary sit on top of the sauce as the broth evaporated.

I read almost all the reviews before making this dish. I've made it several times since, and it always turns out wonderfully.  I use onions, spinach, mushrooms, and the 3 colors of bellpeppers for the veggies. While sauteeing the veggies I add oregano, basil, salt, pepper, garlic, red pepper flakes, and rosemary. I then add the full amount of broth and let the whole thing cook. I add cornstarch based on need. I also add a few splashes of either heavy cream or half and half close to the end of cooking, along with about 2 handfuls of parmesan cheese.  I have used various types of ravioli, and it turns out great every time :)

Unlike most reviewers I found this recipe boring and not very exciting. The only changes I made was to sub an orange bell pepper for a green bell pepper and to add 2 cloves of garlic. I do not plan on making this again.

This was so pretty on the plate.  I did make some changes.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it meatless & and only used half of it and I used a whole red and yellow pepper and smaller green one (like red and yellow better).  Next time I won't cook the peppers as long so they're more crisp.  I also used minced garlic when sauteeing.

As written this, IMO, is a 3 star recipe.  I made some adjustments and managed to make this about a 4 star.  First I added some mushrooms that I needed to use which I think improved this some.  I also added a couple of cloves of pressed garlic.  I used half white wine and half broth.  The biggest issue I have with this recipe is the cooking time.  If you saute your peppers/onions and then simmer them for the amount of time it will take to reduce the sauce, I think you would end up with mush.  Not to mention that most of the beautiful, vibrant color of the peppers would be lost.  I sauteed my peppers and removed them from the pan.  Then I sauteed the onions and proceeded with the sauce.  Rather than simmer it all away, I reduced it a bit and then added a little corn starch mixed with chicken broth to give it just a little body.  If you change the cooking method as I did, this can be a beautiful dish.  Flavor-wise, it was good, but not great.  It definitely needs some salt and pepper!

This is a great recipe! I have made this a few times now and I have found that I like it better with the following changes:
1. I use the whole red and yellow peppers, sliced thin and each an inch long.
2. Add thin sliced chicken to the peppers and sautee - seasoned with garlic, oregano and basil.
3. I omit the onions (bleh).
4. I use 3 cheese tortellini, cause  I like the way it looks. lol
5. I use half of the chicken broth and a little bit of cooking wine.
6. I add a bit of cream or fat free sour cream, and parmesan to the cooking broth.
 
Mmm this is GOOD! My BF says I must make this for our friends. lol

LOVE this!!  The recipe as it is stated is fantastic.  

The following changes are not necessary, but wanted to share what I do.  I usually add more peppers - 1 green, 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange.  I also like it really spicy so I add more crushed red pepper flakes and a few sprinkles of hot sauce.  I also add a clove or three of minced garlic to the oil and saute a bit before adding the onions and peppers.  LOVE it!!

very good.  I had no problems with the amount of broth, just be patient and let it reduce.  I did add a little chopped tomato, nice and light.  it cuts the richness of the ravioli nicely.

Not a bad recipe at all, but I did make a few changes to add a little extra taste.  As well as the peppers and onion, I added some very fine sliced mushrooms and carrots.  I only used 1/2 the stock which was plenty, and more and it would be swimming in it.  Also added a little garlic, oregano and basil.  Just before serving I added 1/2 cup thick cream and a dash of salt and pepper.  To be honest, without the extra herbs and seasoning I did think the sauce was a little bland.  The Ravioli I used was grilled chicken with rosemary, parmesan and mozzarella (Costco).

This was good, but nothing amazing.  I liked the concept of how to prepare the peppers - and I probably will make them similar in the future - I just won't be making this recipe again.

Excellent! However, I did make a few modifications.  I did saute the onions, and the peppers with some crushed garlic in my wok with the olive oil.  I didn't feel the dish had enough "substance" to it.  With the peppers onions, I added some Johnsonville adoulle style spicy smoked sausage cut into pieces.... Making it  a "one dish meal".   The sauce wasn't actually thick enough so I added some alfredo sauce as well.  Everyone loved the recipe, actually had no leftovers. Will definitely make again, Next time will serve with some french bread on the side to soak up the sauce.

I did make this recipe again, making some "different changes" from the first time I made it.  Sounds crazy, but in place of the alfredo, I added about a pint cream and roughly 1/2-3/4 cup balsamic vinegar.. Again, rave reviews from family.  I really think this would be amazing topped with grilled shrimp!

Great change of pace!  We tried it with butternut squash ravioli and added a splash of roasted carrot soup to moisten the pepper mixture.  Delicious!

Really good..we added shrimp to our meal...followed the recipe to the letter but omitted the red pepper flakes (only b/c I didn't have them) but it doesn't alter the test only the spiciness...Have made twice & will make again!

This was wonderful.  So fresh tasting.  The only thing I did different was to only use 1/2 of the broth.  Loved it!

Pretty good. Next time I will add more chicken broth and throw the Ravioli in with the mixture so it will absorb some of the flavor.

Great recipe base, but it did need a few modifications.  I took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and sauteed garlic with the onions and bell peppers, then added 1/2 tsp of oregano and 1/2 tsp basil with HALF the amount of broth.  I added a splash of white wine and a splash of cream. I doubled the amount of red pepper flakes, per the advice of others - I would NOT do this again.  I think the amount called for in the recipe is probably fine.  Next time I think I'll add even more cream than I did.

This was pretty good as written, but it needed some herbs.  Since my husband wants meat in his meals, I browned some chicken hot Italian sausage first then I deglazed the pan with white wine.I added garlic and oregano while the peppers and onions were simmering, and added sliced crimini mushrooms. I found some lobster ravioli for a good price, so I used them instead of cheese ravioli.  Just before serving I stirred in some fresh chopped basil and a touch of fat free half and half. This was very tasty, but as written, the recipe needed some help.

This was a pretty good dish; I made a few beneficial modifications. I added an entire red bell pepper, 1/2c sun dried tomatoes, substituted green onion and added 1t basil, 1t oregano, 1t parsely and 1/2t thyme.  I thought the amount (1/4) of hot pepper was perfect.  This took a bit of time to reduce the sauce but the finished product was good.

I decided to greek it up a bit.  I sauteed chicken in olive oil, lemon juice and garlic.  Then I removed the chicken and sauteed the peppers in the same pan.  Only used one cup of vegetable broth and returned the chicken to the pan with the broth.  I also used spinach feta ravioli.  I thought the peppers were too soft.  They should be cooked less time.  Served with a ceasar salad.

Overall, the ravioli was good- but the taste was pretty bland. I would add more Red crushed pepper and some garlic powder to spice up the flavor a little bit.

Delicious! Used about 1/2 C. less of the broth and sprinkled with shredded parmesan cheese prior to serving. This would be a perfect compliment to many main dishes. Thank you, I will definitely make this again!

I loved this, and so did my kids. I didn't halve the broth, and it turned out just fine. I think it's a matter of being patient enough to let it reduce. The flavor was excellent.

This was very good though I altered it a bit.  I used half of the chicken broth and I didn't use onions or red pepper flakes. I added chicken strips, cheese, and assorted spices.  It gave it a bit of a kick and it was delicious.

I added some garlic in the beginning and went ahead and just tossed in the whole pepper for the red and yellow instead of half because I had over a pound of ravioli. I also added some Italian seasoning near the end and topped with Parmesan cheese. It turned out great! We will definitely make this dish again.

This was a very good recipe and a refreshing change from the normal ravioli we're used to making.  I did make a few changes...I used about 1 1/2 c.'s of broth b/c 2 just seemed like too much.  I also thickened the broth with some cream as another reviewer suggested.  Because I only had frozen chopped green peppers in the house, that's what I used.  I'll be keeping this in the recipe box for future use.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I LOVE bell peppers.  I also love ravioli.  But this wasn't so much a dish as it was cooked bell peppers on top of ravioli.  It was awkward cutting slices of peppers over squares of ravioli.  Maybe a better option would be to dice the peppers and cook them in some red sauce for a healthier sauce, or make a pureed sauce from grilled peppers.  This just didn't work for us.

Made this for dinner tonight!  It was great!  Quick, easy and delicious!  Used a little more red pepper flake for some added heat.  Also, used a little less chicken stock and added in some half and half at the end of cooking.  Sprinkled with Parmasan cheese and served with a nice green salad.  Great way to use up some peppers from the garden.

Delicious! I used Costco frozen 4-cheese ravioli and followed another poster's advice about adding garlic, oregano, and basil to the pepper mix. I also used red, orange, and yellow peppers and skipped the green pepper. Sprinkled shredded fresh parmesan on top and it was wonderful! Am looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I'd give this 4 1/2 stars with the modifications I made.  I used 1 red and 1 yellow sweet bell pepper, 1 tomato, 1 onion, and about 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper.  I diced all the vegetables and sauteed for a few minutes in just 1 Tbsp. of olive oil.  To this, I added one cup of chicken broth, simmmered for 5 minutes, and then added another cup of chicken broth mixed with 1 Tbsp. cornstarch.  I removed this from the heat as soon as it thickened and served over 20oz. of fresh cheese ravioli.  It had very good flavor, including a nice bite from the crushed red pepper, and the vegetables were tender without being mushy.  Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top would be a nice touch.

Personally, I thought it was eatable, but pretty bland.  To me, the peppers were too mushy after being in the broth for so long, but my grandma, brother, and cousins all wanted seconds, and the whole dish got eaten, so I guess everyone else liked it a lot.

I used the suggestions from various other users. Definitely add garlic! Also, add some chicken breast to make this a well rounded meal. Don't skip the red pepper flakes. Those are a must - they add all of the flavor. I also used low sodium chicken broth to make it more healthy.

Very easy to make and a tasty change of pace. I used vegitable broth instead of chicken broth and it turned out good. I made home-made tortellini to go with it and it was yummy but I think when I use this recipe again I'll use simpler pasta, with tortellini the flavors competed a bit, I'll also put a bit more of the pepper flakes in.

Absolutely delicious! A big hit every time I make it.  When I make it, it takes a while for the broth to cook off so I hold off on cooking ravioli until pepper topping is close to done.  Ravioli doesn't take long to cook.  Just have boiling water ready for when you need to start them.

YUMM.  That sums it up.  This was a wonderful change from tomato based pasta just as the description states.  I doubled the recipe and added about 1 tsp of roasted minced garlic to the onion and pepper mixture while it was cooking, but I'm a garlic junkie.  It was light and fresh tasting.  My daughter loved it and there were no leftovers.  I will absolutely make this again.  Thank you for submitting it!

Yum! This was simply fantastic, albeit with a LOT of tweaking to get it there. For starters, I added WAY more spice - a 1/2 t each of basil, oregano and salt. I also added 2 LARGE (minced) garlic cloves to my bell pepper / onion mixture and a handful of shredded Parmesan cheese and a little less than 1/4 c. of chopped flat-leaf parsley as garnish. Because my hubs is not fond of green bell peppers, I subbed an orange one instead. With these changes, I turned what I believe would have been a mediocre dish into something incredibly delicious. NOTE: It takes a while to reduce the broth, so be patient! Because I was busy tending to other tasks, it didn't seem to take very long for mine to reduce, but I can see how hovering over the stove waiting could be nerve racking.... Served with garlic bread, this was an almost too easy meal. :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, LOSTTHYME. You have proven that an entree without meat doesn't equate to less filling or bland! :-)

Great alternative to a tomato sauce.  I used veggie broth due to my daughter being vegetarian, and added a pinch of salt and fresh cracked pepper along with a tbsp of fresh, chopped parsley at the end.  Excellent over home-made spinach/ricotta ravioli! Thanks for the recipe!

The broth reduces down, but is still saucy enough to coat the ravioli.  And it's a beautiful dish with all the colorful peppers.  Company worthy.

This was a surprisingly delicious dish. It was so simple that I wondered if what I was putting together was going to really taste like anything, but boy was I surpised. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken as I was in the middle of a fast (no meats). Still the dish came together and was very flavorful. My husband loved it.

I didn't have any ravioli, so I used cheese tortellini instead. I also added a bit of sea salt and black pepper and didn't use any crushed red pepper. This dish was absolutely fantastic! It had great flavor and was a rather healthy meal by my standards. I will definitely make this again.

This is a very easy and good recipe that I make quite often. If you need meat with your meal use this as a side dish. Add a salad and you've got a meal.

Great receipe!  I followed the suggestions by several readers.  I cut the broth in 1/2,added roasted garlic and several other spices. My husband who is a pasta-tomato lover really enjoyed it and said that he would like it served again!!

I agree with several others that this is a pretty bland recipe.  I pan-sauteed a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a sliced onion and a clove of garlic in a bit of olive oil to start.  Then I added 1 cup of chicken broth and added a splash of white wine after the liquid had boiled down some, though I agree that this amount of liquid was still too much.  The veggies will just simmer in the liquid and begin to get mushy after a while.  I ended up pouring off most of the liquid before this happened.  And even though I added crushed red pepper and some Italian seasonings and served it all on top of fresh gorgonzola ravioli with a side of garlic bread, the meal was still only so-so.  I will not be repeating this recipe.

I added mushrooms to the mixture in the skillet, and I was surprised at how everything shrunk down as the peppers cooked. It tasted all right - a little bland. I added some light cream and less broth, but it never evaporated. I used tortellini and it added a lot more flavor than the sauce.

This was a nice change from marinara on ravioli because it didn't hide the taste of the ravioli.  I ran out of olive oil and ended up using vegetable oil and it was still tasty.  I recommend topping with parmesan.  The next time I will carmelize the onions before I saute the peppers.

This is a great recipe - such a nice change from heavy sauces and meat.  It is a regular in our home!
We usually just use all green and red peppers though depending on prices - tastes the same!

Love this.  It is in our regular dinner rotation.  Only thing I do differently is up the amt of pepper to 1 green, 1 red and 1 yellow or orange.

I love this recipe, it is becoming a regular in our weekly menu. I do add a couple of handfuls of parmesan cheese, a pinch of oregano, a pinch of basil, and only 1.5 cups of broth. These were all suggestions from other reviewers. It is a really great recipe

I love this recipe. It was quick easy and delicious.  I had bought some sweet peppers from Costco and had so many, I just cut them up and used them instead of the bell peppers.  I followed the rest of the recipe and it was great!  The best advice I can give, it makes a difference to add a bit of parmesan cheese; it added just the right finesse to the flavoring.

My husband and I thought this was excellent. The only thing I added based on other reviews was a couple of cloves of garlic to the onion/pepper mixture, parmesan cheese, and I increased the red pepper flakes to about double what the recipe called for. Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make this one again.

I thought this was great; however I did make a few changes. I only used red and yellow peppers, I omitted 1 cup of broth, and I added a can of cream of chicken soup.  Next time I will use spinach ravioli, but I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was alright. It was a little bland. I would add some sweet and hot peppers next time. It was nice to have Ravioli without a heavy tomatoe sauce.

This was pretty good but does need an extra "something."  I also added freshly grated parmesan cheese for more flavor.

Really good!  Beautiful - the sauce seemed to be missing something.  It was watery - maybe more simmering or parmesan cheese?  The flavor was great!

Very nice, light recipe.

The only changes I made after reading many of the reviews was that I:
1. added 1 tsp garlic to the veggies
2. used 1 cup chkn broth, 1/4 cup lemon juice (I ran out of capers), 1/2 cup white wine

I also added roux to the sauce to thicken it up. 

My whole family really enjoyed it. It had a wonderful, light flavor different from what I normally cook.

Thanks!

This was very good.  I followed recipe exactly except used a full red pepper and half a yellow and half an orange one. If you have time, be patient and the broth WILL reduce - the enhanced flavours will be worth the wait.

My husband loves it when I fix this for dinner. I made a few changes though. I added a yummy Alfredo sauce seasoned with lots of basil and cilantro. I also didn't use green peppers at all, and I added some herb-y veggie broth to the mix. I tossed the ravioli with the sauce and poured the peppers over it to serve.Wonderful with margaritas.

I thought this was delicious.  My 13 month old son wouldn't even look at it, but he is tepid about trying anything. The sauce was so good I am going to puree a little next time for him.

I thought this was good, but not great.  I made half of the recipe and added one clove of garlic with the peppers, added one tsp of cornstarch + water into the broth to thicken it, and added a few shakes of garlic powder and onion powder while the broth was cooking.  It still seemed pretty bland and was runny.  It's a good way to get some veggies and I love bell peppers, it just wasn't an exceptional way to do ravioli.  Would definitely need more garlic and red pepper to salvage.

The dish was okay, nothing amazing.  There seemed to be too many onions.  Also, I think that red peppers would have been a better pairing then green.

We love this recipe. I've made it 5 or 6 times now and it turns out better every time. I also add less chicken broth, more pepper flakes and a bit of garlic.

I made this recipe a while back and it was a nice change from pasta with tomato sauce.  I prepared the recipe pretty much as is, but did add fresh garlic and used low sodium chicken broth as that's what I always buy.  Turned out really well, thanks for the recipe, nice and quick for my busy weeknights!

Liked the heat in this dish but it just didn't really do anything for me. My husband liked it much better. I used a frozen blend of tri-colored peppers as well as frozen diced onions as a timesaver.

This was outstanding! I did not have any ravioli so I tossed the pepper topping with some soba noodles and crumbled feta cheese. It was so incredibly flavorful and colorful. I also rubbed some chicken breasts with a sundried tomato paste which I grilled and served along with. Add some fresh greens on the side and you have a beautiful meal to impress your company or to just treat yourself!

I'm telling ya, these five star recipes never fail me! Great, easy recipe! I was a little worried about it being too spicy but it wasn't at all. I added some garlic powder but other than that I followed recipe to a tee. The whole family loved it. I could hardly believe how fast my 2 year old was eating! I think the next time I will experiment with different flavors of stuffed pasta. Thanks for another great recipe!!

Definatly a good change of pace.  I added a little minced garlic and garlic powder and an onion quarted and the sliced.  I also used ricotta and asparugus filled tortillini's.  This was a very giid dinner!! 4 and a half stars, because this wasn't quite a 5 star, but it was better than 4 stars.

Excellent!  I made it a 4 pepper dish and used red, yellow, orange, and green peppers.  I also added fresh parsley and a little bit of garlic powder.  The red pepper flakes are necessary to bring out the flavor in this dish. We were very pleased with the results and will make this healthy dish often.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I was so bored with the same old tomato sauce or alfredo sauce.  This is exactly what I was looking for.  Although it tastes great as is, I will also try it with sauteed garlic next time.  If you like your vegetables crisp then I recommend heating the vegetables just long enough to tenderize the garlic because they will continue to cook when the broth is added.  I only used 1 cup of broth and that was plenty.  I'm not a big fan of really spicy foods but the about of red pepper in this recipe was just right for me.  Watch it if you're serving it to kids though.

I just found this recipe, and I am only giving it 3 stars right now, since I haven't had the chance to make it. Leaving a review to make a suggestion. If you're looking to cut down on costs, you can buy a 1 pound bag of frozen fajita mix which is usually a 3 pepper and onion blend. They taste great, easy to cook, and its already cut up and blended together.

Great alternative to a tomato-based sauce. Hubby and I loved it and it looked beautiful plated. I sliced some Chicken sausage into the chicken broth mixture, and added two tbls cornstarch to make the sauce thicker.

The first time I made it it was a little too warm, too much red pepper flakes. The next time i added ground beef and Parmesan cheese. Excellent!

I really enjoyed this. The peppers and chicken broth made for a great topping to the cheese ravioli.

this was ok.  I took some of the other reviewers advice and put my spin on it.  Didn't use any chicken stock, but a can of Italian flavored chopped tomatoes and white wine instead.  Added some fresh garlic, salt and pepper, and finished it with a TBS of butter, grated parm and some fresh basil.  I think it would have been better with even more veg, such as zucchini and mushroom.  I also only cooked the peppers and onion until they were crisp tender.  I might make again.

My husband and I enjoyed this with a couple slight changes to the recipe.  While I sauteed the peppers & onions I added some minced garlic and salt & pepper.  Then, when I added the red pepper flake, I also added some "italian seasoning".  Lastly, I left some chicken broth in with the peppers and thickened it with some cornstarch to make a sauce. We also grilled some italian style chicken sausages and mixed them in with the ravioli & peppers and served with a sprinkle of parmesan.  Will definitely make again!

Deee-lish and very easy to make. As an alternative I poured marinara sauce on the plate before loading it up. This way I could have both sauces.

This was really good.  I used fresh three cheese ravioli, 2 green, 1 whole red, 1 whole yellow peppers, and 1/2 large onion. I should have used the whole onion. Like someone else, I added a little crushed basil, and oregano.  I will be making this again, it was a nice change to pasta with sauce.

This was pretty good and easy.  My ravioli was done long before my peppers were.  I have to say I don't think it was quite as amazing as other reviewers did, but I might make it again.

Very tasty, I could see puting in chunks of chicken. This would also be a great base for  creating a chicken soup. I did add mushrooms, salt and pepper. Very good I will make this many times over. Thank you!

Awesome, I added garlic and some(about 1/4cup) alfredo sauce at the end, but I only used half of the broth.

I thought this recipe was very good. I made a few changes based on the suggestions of others. I used all of the peppers instead of halving them, and added an orange one, just because I had it on hand. I put minced garlic in with the pepper and onions. I also cooked the peppers with olive oil and maybe two tablespoons of butter to give it more flavor. Then added basil, oregano, and a little tiny bit of parsley. I also upped the red pepper to a half teaspoon and mixed some parmesan cheese in at the end. I didn't think the chicken broth was too much, as long as I gave it plenty of time to evaporate.  All in all it turned out well, it's a good recipe for me since I like to play around with ingredients.

This was easy and delicious.  Next time I would add much less vegetable broth as it made the peppers 'steamed' rather than sauteed.

Simple and delicious.  And to make it even easier to prep, I just used a jar of roasted red pepper, cut in strips.  Added a splash of balsamic vinegar and salt.

A great alternative to red sauce however I added a little red sauce for added color and thickness. I spiced it a little with chili pepper, oregano and basil. Fresh parasan made a difference too. Very good!!

Prepared 2 versions. Needed a dish for a meatless meal for a family from my church. Doubled the peppers and onion for two batches. I prepared the first exactly as written except I used vegetable broth and added some basil. Only had a small taste, but it was great!  After preparing the first version, in the car as I delivered it, thought about all the notes I'd read here. Finished my family's portion with the chicken broth, added sun dried tomatoes, shredded squash (had some to get rid of) added white wine and heavy cream. Topped with shredded parmesan. Very very good. This is one that is great as written and can be played with in any number of ways...thanks!

No as good as I was hoping. Followed the recipe and was disappointed. It needs a lot of stuff added such as garlic, red wine, seasonings etc. Add a lot after I tasted it with nothing added. I would find another recipe.

I did not think this was as spectacular as everyone else did.  First of all, 1 lb. of ravioli made 2-3 servings for us, not 6 as it said.  Secondly, 3 TBSP olive oil was a little much I felt and in the end, the whole meal felt heavy and too rich.  However, it was still a little bland as if it needed more spices.  I will not make this again.  I gave it three stars because it was creative, I felt.

I used 2 small red bell peppers and 1 large green bell (it's what I had) and some sliced fresh mushrooms.  Only 1 cup of chicken broth total.   I threw in a finely chopped thai chili (instead of the pepper flakes) and some minced garlic to the onion saute.  I didn't cook off too much of the liquid and added a little milk/cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.   Also had some fresh ground pepper & dried basil.  Served on top of butternut squash ravioli.  It didn't totally wow me and was kind of bland even with my added flavors.  I think I'll make it again though with some added spices.

Very good, this will be a regular recipe in my house. I used the full amount of broth, giving it time to reduce, and I plan on doing it again in the future. I may try grilling chicken tenderloins on the side to round out the meal, or when my vegetarian friends come around I'll substitute vegetable broth for the chicken. A very flexible, quick, satisfying meal - thanks very much for sharing.

Made using only 1 cup of broth, and it was good, but not great.  Will make again, but will work on it some.  Included garlic this time, and that was good.  May include a light sauce next time.

This was outstanding. I took the other cooks' advice and used a lot less chicken broth. I also used cheese tortellini instead of ravoli. It was such a nice, light dish. I will definitely be making this again.

I bought some Ravioli from Sam's,cheese and brocolli, and followed this recipe, except I only had green and orange peppers on hand, and increased the pepper flakes a bit, and added some half and half towards the end. It was awesome!! I wish I had cooked a bigger portion, even though there were only 2 of us. Will have this again! Thanks!

This recipe was wonderful.  The flavor of the peppers was great.  I used a cheese ravioli from Costco, and it was wonderful.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Yummy! This recipe is wonderful, I didn't change a single thing. Actually, I take that back, I used a little less broth than called for, but that is all. The amount of spice was perfect for me, too. I'll be making this again, thank you!

Fantastic I followed other suggestions and didn't put in as much broth just enough to make the sauce go a little further. I also added garlic to the peppers and onions along with basil and oregano. At the end I added a splash of cream and Parmesan cheese as well. You might want to add some cornstarch to the recipe so it will thicken faster and wont reduce as much , I felt I could of used some more sauce!!

Delicious!!!!  i used red & orange peppers because we like them and the buitoni ravioli another reviewer recommended.  also thickened with a bit of cornstarch the second time i made it to help adhere to the pasta better.  Yummy!!!

This was very good.  My husband wasn't thrilled when he looked at it but was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it very much.  Unlike most of other reviewers, I added the full amount of broth (maybe a little more) and tried not to let too much evaporate because I like having the ravioli in the broth.  I will definitely make this one again and might even put the sauce over chicken next time.  Thanks!

Great recipe! So unique!! I took the advice of others and added some Parmesan for serving, and I think that definately made the dish. Also, I only needed 1 cup of chicken broth. I love the change from red sauce though.

Great recipe and really simple to make. I took the advice of others and reduced the broth down to 1 cup and added garlic and cheese. I also added in mushrooms. For a fuller meal, cube and cook chicken when cooking the veggies. Great addition to the meal. I've also used beef ravioli. It gave it that extra "something".

This was pretty good.  Our family is not a huge fan of peppers, but it was eaten.  The only changes I made were to use 2 green peppers and 2 red peppers because I didn't have any yellows and the red and green ones were pretty small.

My husband loved this recipe and he is a red sauce pasta lover, me on the other hand i have to say it was just okay. I did take the left over pasta without the vegetable mix and saute in a pan with olive oil, oregano, a bit of thyme and salt and paper to taste and I must say we both liked it much better!

This recipe was totally boring!  I added garlic, salt, pepper, lots of crushed chili flakes, and basil but it still couldn't save it.  

There are too many onions and I don't think they should be chopped, I think they should be sliced and pan fried first with garlic.  I would also add a lot more parmesan cheese.  

I only used one cup of broth as suggested and even that was too much. 

This didn't do anything for the ravioli which is the whole point so I won't be making it again.

Was good, but not great.  I've made this twice now, and my husband and I both agree that it is slightly bland, so maybe next time I will add some garlic to punch it up a little.

Very good, exactly the change from traditional sauces that we needed. Used it on three cheese tortelini. Added garlic, italian seasoning, used butter instead since I was out of olive oil. Fantastic!

Pretty good. Needed more sauce. I might use ravioli with something more than cheese - some kind of meat.

I thought this was delicious. Very light and flavorful. I did add more garlic powder, more broth, and an italian seasoning to give it more pep. A bit spicy, very flavorful, quite a pretty dish.

Very very good dish! I used regular spiral pasta instead of the cheese ravioli but the sauce was still excellent. Oh, and mine was also a bit too spicy hot, but that's because I was careless with the crushed red pepper. Next time I think I will forego it altogether.

I was really disappointed with this recipe; the reviews made it sound so great, so I was excited to try it.  While the ravioli was fine and the peppers tasted really good separately, there didn't seem to be any cohesion between the two.  It didn't seem like one dish, but two.

This was delicious, spicy yet mild at the same time.  I am new to cooking and was looking for something to restore my confidence after a few recipe flops (I was worried my poor boyfriend was going to start starving!) This was very easy and made such a nice presentation.  I had some cheese tortellini, so I threw that in with the ravioli and it turned out well because the revioli are bigger and needed to be cut, but with the torellini you got a bite of pasta with every forkful. Will definitely make again.

Great dish.  This reminds me of the flavor you get from wonton soup but without all the broth. Went wonderful with garlic bread and tossed salad.  Quick dish that satisfied the whole family.  They kept talking about it while eating.

This was really good! A very easy meal to prepare...simple, light, yet tastey.  I would most definitely make it again. even my picky 8 yr old enjoyed it.

Very good, but not worthy of 5 stars.  Subtle but tasty flavor.  The sauce is pretty runny so take measures to thicken it (cook for an extra couple minutes) or just don't serve it on a flat plate.

I thought this recipe was really good and so did my family. It was a nice change from the usual sauces. The only thing I did different was add some garlic and that's just because we love garlic. If you are serving this to kids though I would watch how many red pepper flakes you put in, if not and you like it spicy I would add more. Thanks.
