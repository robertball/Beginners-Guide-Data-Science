I took to this dish to a party and had no leftovers. I used fresh steamed broccoli instead of Mann's Broccoli Wokly and chopped peanuts instead of seasame seeds. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent!  I made for friends that were visiting from Canada and they had to make sure they went home with the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to blanch the red pepper with the broccoli. My grown children LOVE it.  Thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe that I've been meaning to rate for a long time.   I make it exactly as written, usually serving it with Asian salmon from this site. It's healthy, easy, and delicious. Anyone who likes cold sesaame noodles from a Chinese restaurant should like this.

This was very good.  I love red bell pepper so I might put a little more in next time.  Could be great for an office pot luck.

Pretty good, but very salty. Next time I would skip the extra salt and use low-sodium soy sauce. Also, 1 lb of pasta is way too much. I'd recommend more like 1/2 lb.

These noodles were a huge hit with hubby and kids!  Sauce was a tad thick, so I'll probably add a little extra soy sauce or a bit less peanut butter next time.

This dish was okay.  My parents thought it had too much sauce and that the peanut butter taste was too strong.  I would suggest putting less peanut butter, maybe a tablespoon less than recommended.  I actually like peanut butter but it was a little too much for me. The recipe has a strong flavor.  I don't think I'll make this again.

My first time making cold sesame noodles at home... yum!  I used 1T less peanut butter (based on reviews) and sprinkled each serving with a little extra soy (low sodium, of course) and sesame oil.  Even my husband liked this side!  Makes TONS!
