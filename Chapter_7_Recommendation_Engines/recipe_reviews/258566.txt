7.15.17  First, I couldn’t believe how little grease cooked out of the corned beef hash (I’ve never before had it canned).  This recipe couldn’t be simpler, and was a nice change from just good old corned beef hash and eggs.  I think there are many variations you could do.  I was thinking adding some red pepper flakes to the hash while it’s browning, adding some chopped parsley to give it a little pop of color,  or instead of regular cream cheese, spreading the dough with some pimento cream cheese spread, etc.  Would recommend leaving your dough sheets in the fridge until you’re ready to fill and roll them.  I spread my hash mixture while it was warm which softened the dough making it a little difficult to roll tightly.  In the future, I’ll let the hash cool down a bit more.  Really enjoyed the simplicity of this, and it was a nice Saturday morning breakfast paired with some fresh fruit.

I love pinwheels with breakfast sausage and this is just as good. I wouldn't have thought to use corned beef hash, so I'm glad this creative submitter showed me how to do something different with the corned beef.

This is a great idea and it turned out very tasty! It is very decadent but worth it to indulge every now and then. These are great for breakfast but just as good anytime. We had them as  a breakfast for  dinner night. Will make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe and ate it as a light dinner.  I made just one change....after browning the hash, I added the cream cheese directly to the pan, let it melt, and stirred it in.  I used about 6 ounces.  It turned out delicious!

This recipe was a cute idea and would be perfect for kids or on a brunch table.   The crescent rolls cooked perfectly and the inside was creamy and delicious!  I think they would be great with a sprinkle of green onions or chives inside for a little crunch.

I used crescent rolls instead of dough sheets just because I already had them on hand. I hadn't ever made anything with corned beef hash before so I picked a recipe that seemed easy. It turned out great! I would make this again. Thank You for the recipe!

Great recipe and easy to make! I used some corned beef hash from a local restaurant as opposed to hormel. Turned out great!
