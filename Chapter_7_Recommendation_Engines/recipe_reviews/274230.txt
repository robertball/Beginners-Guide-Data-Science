This was very good!  Reminded me of something you could get off the menu at Olive Garden.  It was pretty easy to make as well.  Definitely will be making this again!

Had a gaggle of picky eaters drop in unannounced for lunch today, had the ingredients on hand so just rolled with it.  The only thing that I did differently was substituted radiatore for the penne, I find that to be my go to noodle for the pressure cooker.  Long story short, dinner on the table in a half hour and even my pickiest eaters went in for seconds.

I made the recipe as is except I made it on the stove. It tastes delicious. 
The only change I would make is try to cut calories like using light cream cheese or something like that. Maybe someone can give me suggestions on how to cut some calories on this recipe.
