What a great filled cookie!  Here are some suggestions for making it easier.
1. A regular size canning jar ring is a perfect size for the circles.
2. The dough is very soft to handle.  Try doing only a small amount at a time, enough for 6-8 circles.  Keep the rest of the dough in the fridge until you are ready for it.  Use lots of flour, stopping every couple rolls of the rolling pin to move the dough around and add flour if necessary to keep it from stick to the work surface.  
3. Raisins are very sweet in and of themselves.  I cut the sugar in the filling back to 1/4 cup.  Next time I'll eliminate it altogether. I also eliminated the nuts.  
4. I chopped the raisins in my food processor, along with some of the water for the filling.  It worked like a charm.  I'll probably make 1 1/2 batches of filling next time for 1 batch of dough.
5. For a slightly fancier look, use your fingertips to crimp edges as you would a pie crust. To go simple, just press edges together.
6.  If you want the filling to show through, cut a small x in the top circle of dough before you place it on top.  
7.  And...a piece of advice, from my experience...this is a recipe to keep until the kids are in bed.  Don't try it with a 3 year old wanting to help, and a sick, fussy 8 month old to hold!

I've looked for years for a raisin-filled cookie recipe like my aunt's (she'd never give hers up) and this is the closest I've found.  Great taste and texture.  Make a double batch - my first batch was gone before they cooled.

Great cookie! I only used 1/2 cup cugar in the filling and it was PLENTY sweet enough. Everything else stayed the same. I did drizzle a VERY small amount of a powdered sugar glaze in order to sprinkle red and green sugar crystals for decoration for Christmas. I also processed my rasins in my food processer.

All you young bakers, don't turn your nose up at this old fashioned cookie! You must give it a try. This is one of those cookies that reminds me of home and of  church lady bake sales. It's time consuming to make, but a must for Christmas and Easter.

Oh THANK YOU!!!  I had these when I was a kid and I have been searching for the recipe since my mom lost it, and these taste just like the ones I remember!!  I'm so excited to have it again!!  Also, for a "fancier" looking cookie I cut a smaller hole (about a quarter size) in the top cookie for a peek at the filling.

I made these for my grandparents as a Christmas gift and they loved them as snacks. However I found that I may have made a mistake with my dough because I needed way more than a lightly floured board, however they did taste delicious.

In all honesty, I did not use the cookie portion of this recipe as I have a similar raisin-filled cookie recipe where the dough doesn't have to be chilled 3 hrs before being able to use it.  I did use the filling recipe, however, and boy is it ever a sweet, eyes-rolled-back-into-your-head filling.  Very good indeed!  I put my raisins into my blender to grind them, but they quickly became gummy so I added the water, which worked like a charm.  You do have to watch it carefully as it will quickly become very soupy.  Pulsing with a food processor, if you have one, would probably be an easier choice.  A wonderful cookie for those with a sweettooth!

These cookies are really tasty.  I recommend increasing the flour by 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour for folks having trouble with the dough being too soft.  I could tell as I mixed it, that it might be too soft, so I added approximately 1/4 cup.

I had to put it in the freezer rather than the fridge as I needed it quicker.  You still need to have flour on the table as you roll it out, but you'll have less trouble if you add a little more flour while you're making the dough.  My batch made 3 dozen cookies.  I made a few with strawberry jam filling just to add variety for my family.  I'll make these again as they are a favorite of my husband's.

Delicious but my dough was VERY soft. The rolling out was extremely time consuming. I ended up hand rolling balls, squishing a hole in center, filling w/raisin mixture & sealing. But tasty.

Excellent! I followed directions EXACTLY...and the 22 "cookies", 2 3/4 wide, in my 350 degree oven (thermometer confirmed) baked 11 mins and got just barely brown on the edges. Think about doubling the dough or halving the filling. I have enough filling left for at least 18 more...and yes, I did use the full heaping teaspoon that was recommended. The dough rolled out great for me. I believe the trick is to remove from the refrigerator only the amount you will immediately be working and handle it as little as possible. I chilled mine for 8 hours. There was no sticking problem because I kept a full cover of flour every time I turned the dough. Remember that unless you weigh your flour, and sift it (as recommended), you will get a different dough consistency every time. Enjoy and Happy Holidays!

This was an old family favourite that I had lost the recipe for.  Thanks for sharing.  You really need to chill the dough overnight, then there is no problem rolling it out.  A cream cheese drizzle is a nice addition to finish them off for Christmas.

These are awesome!!! Taste just like Grandma used to make! I've been looking for a recipe and let me tell you....I found it! The dough is a little sticky, had to use a lot of flour but they are delicious. My 13 year-old grandson wasn't sure he wanted to try them but he ate more than anyone! What a nice way to bring back memories of happy times. Thanks for posting this.

We loved these, though we did make a few changes. We omitted half a cup of sugar and the walnuts (allergies) in the filling. As Lynnje said, they were plenty sweet. We also used a shot glass to cut circles out of the top layers. We then brushed the cookies with an egg wash to give them a shiny brown crust. They were very pretty, as well as delicious!

These are the best. Reminds me of my Great Grandma’s!! I needed to add more flour to my dough due to our high altitude in PA. They are perfect! The recipe was doubled and yielded about 50 hearty cookies!

I made these for my dad who was reminiscing about his mom who used to make these when he was a kid. He gave these a great review and I saw him come back for more several times! The only change I made was adding less sugar, as many other reviewers had suggested.

My brother reminded me of these cookies recently so I had to find a recipe.   I refrigerated my dough overnight but it was still soft to work with and the cookies spread, which made the cookies flat and not how we remembered them.   Great taste memory, however.

While these were too sweet for my taste, my husband, who requested them, gave them five stars. He said that they were better than his grandmother’s, which is the ultimate compliment! The dough is very soft and makes an almost cakey texture.

Made these sweet pockets of Holiday deliciousness for the first time this past Christmas and got rave reviews as well as repeated requests for the recipe!  So easy to make. I followed the recipe with one omission- the nuts. Everyone loved how the  sweet 'cookie pastry' encased the tasty filling in a convenient hand-held pouch. No messy oozing...like a dressed up 'mincemeat tart' to-go! 
Will definitely be a new Christmas dessert tradition for our family!!

These were absolutely delicious. I added 1.5 teaspoons of nutmeg & adjusted the raisin filling to give me 1 & 1/2 the amount in recipe.  I also had to adjust my oven temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit and baked 13-14 minutes.

This recipe reminded me of a date filled cookie that our small town bakery made wile I was growing up so I had to try them. I had raisins (no dates) and agreed with another reviewer that they would probably be sweet enough with less sugar, so I used about 1/3 c brown sugar (and no nuts). The first batch of filling I put the raisins in the food processer with some water (bad idea/ broke the blade) so the second batch I rough chopped the raisins and simmered them longer (which I read on another recipe that didn't call for grinding them)  .  Both batches needed the emersion blender to get  a smooth texture. (and easier to clean than a grinder)  I used a 2 1/4-1/2" biscuit cutter and got  3 dozen with the little "heaping teaspoon" of filling  and had about half of the dough left.  (ergo the second batch of filling)So I then got 2 dozen more with the balance of the dough the next day and just divided the second batch of filling among them.  I like them more with the heaping Tbsp. +/- of filling.  agree that they have better flavor (more like the ones from my youth) when cooked just 8 mn/ before they get brown on the bottom but they took longer (12 mn) with more filling.  But watch them closely as my oven is funky.   I will make the again when I have dates. Great nostalgic Christmas cookie. Thanks for a wonderful cookie and  good memories.

The dough is very soft. The refrigeration time is definitely required and you will need a lot of flour. My dad used to make these with his aunt and said that she never rolled it out quite as thin. Everybody loved these cookies and I will be making them again.

These have a good taste & are easy to make but the dough is very crumbly & hard to work with.

The filling was ok but the cookie itself was not. They tasted doughy.

I have tried this recipe and this is the one I have been looking for  years. MY mother made them when I was still at home, I love them.
