I was stationed in Guam almost 20 years ago and have thought about keleguin a number of times, and now thanks to Al Gore I have the internet(ha ha).  Anyway the locals would use Keleguin on chicken, deer, beef, and lobster. Its an excellent flavor.

I've lived on Guam my whole life and this is definitely a traditional dish made as is, and of course delicious. Now living California, it can be difficult to get a fresh coconut, not to mention the fact that I don't have the old school coconut grater my mom used, thus making it a chore to grate a fresh coconut. Of course you must use a FRESH coconut to get that wonderful authentic flavor. I usually make this dish for my husband without the coconut, store-bought whole roasted chicken(to save time), and with minced scallions OR chives. Sometimes I chop fresh baby spinach and add to the dish to give more color and nutrition. I absolutely LOVE kelaguen.. whether it's beef, deer, fish, or EVEN SPAM. Yes, I said spam. Man, I miss home...

Delicious!  I made this with chicken breast once and a rotisserie chicken another time.  Both were great.  We ate it over coconut rice, but it can be eaten cold as a chicken salad or warm.

A small flexible knife will do wonders for getting the meat out of the coconut's curved shell.  Thought the ingredients looked like an odd mix, but i was in the mood to be adventurous. The recipe was delicious. Really interesting mix of flavors, and the coconut added a wonderful crunch. I'll probably make it again, but it may take me a while to work up the nerve to deal with a coconut again.

Wow, yum!  I used a rotisserie chicken from the store, and substituted 1 small clementine orange for one of the lemons, and put the pepper flakes on the table so that all could season to taste.  I chilled the chicken/coconut mix, heated fresh baked tortillas from the deli in the oven, and served both with a pineapple yogurt sauce (crushed canned pineapple mixed into plain whole milk yogurt).  My husband and I loved it - thanks - we will put this one into regular rotation.

I kinda did my own thing with this, but the basics are wonderful. It's really flavorful, tasty and easy. Don't be afraid to try this! (i would buy some dried coconut, or coconut milk, it's not authentic, but the real coconut was a huge hassle for me.) SUPERB!

I was so excited to find this recipe - was my favorite dish when I lived in Guam.  I'm more excited that I can make it myself now and share it with family and friends!  Delicious!

It was really hard to get the meat off the chicken.... but this was pretty good. I sided it with a Guam rice that I found on this website.

Delicious--what a fantastic unique blend of flavors!  I could just imagine myself sitting on a breezy island enjoying this dish.  The coconut was a perfect compliment to the lemon and chicken (I was really surprised at how well-pronounced the flavor was among the other ingredients); the onion and pepper gave it just enough 'twist' to keep it from being too bland and boring.  I didn't want to waste a whole chicken on this recipe since I've never had the chance to try it in a restaurant.  Honestly, then, I just use the recipe as a point-of-reference and mixed the ingredients to taste rather than following the measurements.  I also cheated and used a rotisserie chicken from Sam's Club and pre-shredded organic coconut.  I can totally see this as a lovely potluck dish in my future.

This is wonderful.  I bought a whole chicken and didn't know what I wanted to do with it.  I decided to give this a try and couldn't be happier.  A gave it a liberal squirt (maybe two tbl spoons) of sriracha to bring up the heat a little.  I was worried about grading the coconut meat but it turned out to be much easier than I thought.

Have you tried checking the frozen food for fresh frozen coconut.  I use this for cakes.  Hope this helps.  I cannot rate as I have not tried, but will give it a 4 based on the other reviews.

Very unique flavor, much better than I expected.  I had a very hard time with the coconut, so I will probably buy it preshredded.  I will probably also go 1/2 on the red peppers since it did a little number on my stomach.  Very good!  Thanks for this great unique recipe.

You all can thank me now. I have found a way to cut the prep time in half. For those of you not lucky enough to have a Guamanian coconut scraper and have spent hours getting that coconut out of its shell listen up. Crack the coconut with a hammer into small pieces then with a sharp knife cut the outer “shell” aka the brown part. Cut the meat pieces into 1 inch pieces and put in your blender on “grate”. It comes out perfect and so so easy!
I was lucky enough to grow up on Guam and have such fond memories especially of the food with Keleguin being my favorite but was SO time consuming that I seldom made it. It will be made a whole lot more often now. Watch out, pickled papaya is next! Hafa Adai!

I wanted to like this dish, but I must have done something wrong. I used a young coconut because that's all they had at the store, and the coconut flavor was overpowered by the lemons. I think my cooking ability ends at preparing fresh coconut!

Awsome flavor combination. I cut the pepper flakes down to just 1tbsp so that it wouldn't be too hot for everyone.

This is a wonderful dish! It was soo yummy, I plan on making this all the time! The only reason it isnt getting 5 stars is because it was WAY to spicy for me. I used 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes, next time I will use 1. Three is WAY too much, unless you love very spicy foods. Thanks for the recipe, really great!

No one had seconds. Also, the high fat, high fiber content of the  coconut did not sit well on everyone's stomach.

This is a basic, traditional recipe my family also uses. Instead of dried pepper flakes, we use fresh peppers (donne). Most on the mainland do not have a coconut grater (kamyo) unless it's passed down from family or someone builds it. If you to not have a kamyo, the kelaguin is also tasty without the coconut. Kelaguin at a party/bbq as a side dish, with flour tortilla (kelaguin burrito), sweet bread or on tatiyas :)

This is one of my favorite recipes to make. It takes a while to make, but it's simple, healthy, and delicious. I usually cut back on the red pepper flakes, as that much makes it very powerful. My wife and I like to wrap this in warm tortillas. It is also good cold as leftovers.
