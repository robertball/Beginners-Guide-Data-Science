Step one should mention that you put the salt in with the ice... it took me a few minutes to figure it out (I'm trying to learn to cook, so not obvious to me)  also had to google kosher salt versus iodized... iodized worked just fine.  This was super yummy.... my husband thought I was a little goofy when he saw me shaking plastic bags around, but loved it once I was done :)

Another great way to get the kids involved is to use two metal coffee cans one small with the ice cream bag in it and one large with the salt and ice. Place the small can in the large can (make sure the lids on tight) and roll them on the floor back and forth. Not only is it easy for little ones to help; its not so cold on the hands.

My kids used a recipe very similar to this in Pre-School.  It was a great project for them, everyone had tons of fun.  Surprisingly it works!  Their arms got a little tired from all the shaking, but moms were on hand to help.  You have to eat it fast, it melts quickly.  Maybe if you put it in the freezer after, but then who wants to wait!

I promised my 4 year old a vanilla ice cream cone, but the local ice cream stand was closed!  So in less than 15 minutes I whipped this up and I had one thrilled 4 year old.  I only had whole milk on hand so I used that, was low on vanilla extract, so I added a tablespoon of instant vanilla pudding mix, and I left out the strawberries.  I'm sure the texture was changed a bit by using whole milk instead of half and half, but it was still delicious!

This recipe was so fun to make with my 4 year old niece! the ice cream wasn't bad either! it was however very hard to squeeze the ice cream out of the bag without hurting my hands too much because it was SO cold! that was the only downside to this recipe. Also after shaking for 5 minutes i put the ice cream in the freezer for about an hour or so and the ice cream still melted very fast, but tasted amazing!

My daughter had a blast making these! She did get tired quickly though, so I took advantage to workout my triceps and biceps lol.
