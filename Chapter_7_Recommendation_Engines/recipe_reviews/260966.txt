We liked this dish but felt it was missing something that could be fixed.  I must admit to not having grilled the chicken but rather just stovetopped chicken tenders (that shouldn't have changed the chicken at all).  I didn't use head lettuce but rather leafy red lettuce.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  It just needed to be easier to eat.  This is a great starting point because the sauce as written was okay.  I hope someone else has a better idea on this because it has possibilities!  I hope someone will give it a try!  EDIT:  We had leftovers in sandwich form tonight and the chicken was better!  Maybe it just needs to marinate longer!
