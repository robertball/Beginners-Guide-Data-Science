I've been making this salsa for 5 years...it is DELICIOUS!  
Use 15 CUPS Chopped Tomatoes (skins removed, of course).
Add 3/4 cup - 1 Cup of FRESH chopped cilantro AND 2 Tablespoons ground cumin IN THE LAST 15 MINUTES OF COOKING. 
THIS IS PERFECT!  i always get between 16 & 18 jars.....plus all the taste testing! :)

Cooked it down so it was nice and thick.  Added a bit more sugar and cilantro.  First batch of tomatoes from the garden this year done!
