Delicious! I used light Velveeta in place of the cheddar, and used the Italian seasoning, to taste (personal preference). This baked up beautifully and tasted great! This made exactly 3 ramekins, which was perfect for us. I liked how I was able to assemble this earlier in the day and just refrigerate it until I was ready to bake it. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The best way to describe this was.... a pile of mush. The flavor wasn't very good and the orzo kind of cements into a ball of mush as soon as you put it on the plate.
