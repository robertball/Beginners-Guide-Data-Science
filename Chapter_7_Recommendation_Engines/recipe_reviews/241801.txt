Made as written except that I used regular tortilla's and also sprinkled pepperjack cheese on the top layer before rolling. The swiss was nice melted on the bottom but I just wanted some non melted cheese on the top. This crisped up nicely and even though I'm not a huge tofu fan, this is one I would definitely make again.

Tasty, but I think it needs something more. I'm considering including caramelized onions and substituting bleu cheese crumbles for the melted Swiss next time I make it but doing so would complicate the recipe and muddy the concept of "cheap, quick and easy".
