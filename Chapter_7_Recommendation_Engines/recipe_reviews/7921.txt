The rum-soaked raisins are a nice touch, which I also use when making apple strudel. Other that that, though, I judge it a rather average cake, with a slight rum flavor.

This cake has been the talk of the office.  I put a little twist by using half applesauce and half chopped fresh sweet apples.  WOW.  Excellent recipe.

Pay no heed to the 3 star reviews that say this cake is too dry, or not Rummish enough. Maybe it is in the original form, but use this twist: Use a  full 1/2 cup rum to soak raisins. Also use this to glaze the cake fresh out of the oven: 1/4 C butter, 1/4 C Sucanat or Turbinado sugar, 1/4c (or a *tad* less if you prefer) rum. its fantastic. i also use a  half and half Sucanat- turbinado sugar mix for the cake itself. It is healthier than white sugar and really you can't tell the difference.

I loved this cake!  It had more of a banana bread consistency which made it great.  I too halved the applesauce and put diced fuji apples (the sweetest).  I used all golden raisins and let them marinate in the rum for two days.  Sooooo good.  My dad loved his birthday cake.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)

I am surprised that anyone would describe this as a rum cake.  I was quite liberal in my use of rum, and actually added more than the 1 cup of rum soaked raisins called for (additionally, I soaked my raisins in rum for several days), but no rum taste was discernible in the finished cake.  I would describe this as a snack cake.  It is moist and mildly spiced, not overly sweet, yet does not require a frosting or glaze.  It is relatively healthy for a cake, and makes a good lunch box addition, or simply a nice snack for the kids.  It is not an exceptional recipe in any way.

This turned out perfectly the first time I tried it.  I didn't have cocoa powder so I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg, and dusted the top with some powdered sugar.  Very nice!
