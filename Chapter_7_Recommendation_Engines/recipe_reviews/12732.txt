“What’s Old Bay?” you ask. Try this: celery seed, black pepper, bay leaf, cardamom, mustard seed, cloves, paprika, and mace. 

Didn’t have cod, so I added shrimp during the last 5 minutes of cooking. (Don’t overcook shrimp, otherwise they get rubbery).Also didn’t have clam juice, so I used extra chicken stock. Instead of evaporated milk, I used 2%. As others mentioned, I added corn, extra mushrooms, and crumbled bacon on top.

Mmm...Mmm...Good!

This chowder is AMAZING! I accidently overcooked the potatos, so I would be sure to follow cook time to a "T". Still turned out great. The only thing I changed was mincing the celery and mushrooms, and I only added one can of evaporated milk. Great combo with the fish especially for those who don't like chewing on rubbery clams. I am from the Pacific Northwest and we have a lot of famous chowder houses up here. A trick I learned when searving chowder is to put a bit of butter and a sprinkle of pepper on top. (Thought I would pass it on) This chowder is already very rich and creamy so I am eating it just the way it is. I saw a lot of comments stating this is a bland chowder and I did not find it so. I put in a lot of pepper cause that is the way I like chowder, so maybe give that a try. We had garlic sticks with ours and it made a great meal!

This really was easy and extremely adaptable.  I used catfish, but any white fish would work well - even a mixture of fish.  I increased the Old Bay Seasoning to 1 tsp +, and added the entire bottle of clam juice.  I also added 1 Tbls more than called for of flour, to make it a little thicker.  Next time I'll add the crumbled bacon into the soup, rather than use as a topping.  Top with parsley.  KEEPER!

This was soooo good!  My husband's first response was, "Darn, that's good!  Why haven't you made this before??" I did make a few changes though... but I think the recipe as written would be just as yummy.  I used 1lb red snapper, 1lb cooked baby shrimp and some chopped clams.  I had lots of clam juice, so I used 4 cups clam juice to 1 cup chicken broth.  I also used half and half rather than evaporated milk and found that 16oz was enough.  Used Lawry's great garlic salt with parsley and lots more Old Bay's to taste.  I can't recommend this recipe either way highly enough.. we will have it again and again and again!

I added 6 strips of bacon and used a whole lot more Old Bay Seasoning, plus a few clams.  It was terrific.

THIS CHOWDER IS SPECTACULAR!!  I made a few changes based on previous reviews and preference.  I used an 8 oz container of sliced mushrooms.  It looks like a lot but they reduce in size after cooking.  I used 1 lb of cod, 1/2 lb of bay scallops, 1 lb of shrimp and 2 cans of minced clams. Instead of buying a separate bottle of clam juice, I saved the juice from the canned clams and mixed it with the flour.  Two cans will give you one cup of juice. The variety of seafood added great flavor!  I also used a full tablespoon of the Old Bay seasoning which I thought was perfect!  I also took other reviewers suggestions and used one can of creamed corn and used 1 cup of half & half in place of the evaporated milk.  My family absolutely loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe with catfish and it turned out wonderful, I only used one can of the milk, and about 1/2 cup extra chicken stock.  I also included bacon, and cooked the onions and celery in the drippings.  I think adding scallops would have really made the recipe better, I will add them next time,  Thanks for a great winter recipe!

Excellent chowder!  An easy recipe to make substitutions and additions.  I chopped red chilis and put into sauteing onions and celery. This gave a little 'bite'.

Outstanding recipe.  Instead of the cod, I had leftover grilled striped bass that I used, which made it a bit faster and also gave a hint of smokiness.  I also put in some finely sliced scallions - added the white part before I took it off the heat and added the green part with the evaporated milk.  Really great for a quick summer dinner.  Would definitely make again.

Awesome. Made with frozen halibut from summer. Weirdly, I didn't have any mushrooms. Turned out great, anyway!

Wow... after all the rave reviews, I thought this chowder was boring and bland. What was everyone raving about?  I doctored it up with some worcestershire sauce, a shot of sherry, a little thyme, marjoram, a bay leaf, and a lot more Old Bay, and then it was pretty good.

As written this recipe is 3.5-4 stars. It is a good base. However, AS IS the recipe is bland and a little "off". Once I doctored it, it was 5 stars. I noticed many (if not most) people rating with 5 stars made changes. How can you give a recipe 5 stars if you have to change it? That means the original recipe isn't a 5 star recipe...the one YOU created with changes is! *ahem, okay stepping down from soap box* LOL Anyway, I also made changes as recommended by other viewers (cooked a few slices of bacon chopped; skipped the mushrooms; cooked veggies in 1T bacon grease, 1T butter; also used fat free half and half instead of evap milk; added a LOT more OBS as well as a little cajun seasoning; used only half of the flour and instead mashed about half of the cooked potatoes with my potato masher for thickening without a goopy flour taste; and finally, garnished with fresh cut chives and that cooked, crumbled bacon...YUM). Although I did make adjustments, I still say kudos to AMYTHE for sharing this good base recipe. Thank you!

I'm the nameless "sister" that created this recipe in the 1980's and am thrilled it has gotten such great reviews! I didn't use Old Bay Seasoning and used white, not black, pepper, and garnished with crumbled bacon. It's still a great recipe! Enjoy tweaking it to suit your own tastes. I was honored that my recipe was included in the Allrecipes cookbook some years ago. Janet

This recipe was thorough in timing if you follow the amounts given. I used fresh trout which was very good. Also used 1 teas fish sauce and a cup of water for clam juice. Can use creole seasoning for old bay if need be in a pinch. This was a favorite dish of my husbands. I left out the mushrooms didn't have any.

Ode to the soup.....hip hip hooray.  We decided instead of fish to put in 1lb of sea scallops, 1/2 lb large shrimp (diced), 2 cans of chopped clams with the juice in.  We also found that pureeing the onions it gave it a more distributed flavor....smack. Also a dash of tobasco. BEWARE: This is a Jamboozle of soup be prepared for dinner guests or have lots of butter containers for freezin your left overs.

Really good soup (the Old Bay seasoning is wonderful), but I did make a few changes: 1) extra Old Bay seasoning and pepper 2) use less flour and thicken with instant potatoes 3) skip the mushrooms and add roasted corn instead (sautee it in a pan with EVOO, onion, and celery) Thanks for a super yummy recipe...this will be a family favorite=:)

My first foray into chowders = delicious! I read several reviews and made these changes: first, I started by browning 6 slices of center cut bacon in the bottom of the pan. Since they were center cut, I still needed to add the butter for the onion, mushrooms (used more than 4 bc I had them) and celery.  I used two cans of chopped clams and added the clams (reserving the liquid for step 4) and 1 can of creamed corn after step 3. I added 1 tsp of Old Bay and found that was enough. Be careful adding salt if you add the bacon and that much Old Bay. At first it doesn't seem like there's enough liquid, but it makes for a thick, hearty chowder - and with so little dairy! We served it after clams casino and before lobster for Christmas Eve - bellisimo!

Just made this tonight and its a total hit. My kids are devouring it (and one of them hates fish!!) I omitted the shrooms because I didn't have any but I added carrots. I also had no clam juice so I used additional chicken stock and I used flounder because it was on sale for $1.99 a lb. It is awesome!! I will be making this again!! Oh yeah.. if you have a Whole Foods around they carry a seafood seasoning that is called New Orleans Seafood seasoning w/ Tabasco (its a powder and it tastes like Old Bay with extra heat) and I added some of that to give it a little kick but still used about a tsp and 1/2 of Old Bay too. Was so so good.

If my family could have rated this recipe more than 5 stars we would have.  This was so-o-o-o-o good.  When my husband asked "What's for dinner?"  I told him a fish stew (fish chowder)  he was skeptical. But we love chowders and this one was better than any restaurant chowder.  I did add a can of drained clams and about 10 shrimp.  Thanks Amy!

I made this with a few alterations for a surprise pirate party for my boyfriend, who happens to LOVE seafood.  I used 1 lb cod, 1/2 lb shrimp, 1/2 lb scallops, and used a can of mince clams in place of the mushrooms.  I'm allergic to shellfish, so I couldn't try it...he couldn't get enough of it.  He said the consistency and spices were just perfect. He ate two bowls before we took it to the party, and for once, my dish was the first thing everyone emptied!  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll be making it a lot more!

Oh my goodness.  This was unbelievably good - better than the fish chowder my New Englander in-laws make!  I used 3 tsp. of Old Bay, and a bag of frozen pollack (which, to be honest, wasn't 100% thawed when I put it in, but seemed to come out okay in the end).  I also let the soup simmer for a minute after adding the flour/clam juice mixture; the thickening magic of flour doesn't happen without heat.  I used 8 oz of mushrooms, and I highly recommend the hot pepper sauce.  I didn't have any problem with the texture - it's true that this isn't one of those thick-as-mayonnaise chowders, but it's also true that it's some tasty, tasty stuff.

Excellent! The second time we made it, we added fresh chives, crisp bacon, corn, and a combination of fish, shrimp, and lobster. It was wonderful!

This was excellent! I used orange roughy & a little less evaporated milk. Needs plenty of seasoning I found, but very easy & so good.

This is the best chowder recipe we've ever tried -- it's creamy, thick, and easy to make.  And even those who think they don't like seafood will like this chowder since it doesn't have a really "fishy" taste like some.

This makes a lot...if you halve the recipe you get six good servings.  I found the taste improved by sauteing the vegetables in bacon drippings, increasing the Old Bay seasoning to about 1.5 tsp, adding 3/4 tsp. of salt when adding the potatoes, keeping the clam juice at 1 c when halving the recipe, and finishing with a tbsp. of butter when the evap. milk was added.  Really excellent!  Thank you, Amy!

Great chowder!  I omitted the mushrooms, added some bay scallops, extra celery and cooked bacon.  The whole family loved it!

Delicious! Only thing I should've done differently was use only 1 can of evaporated milk instead of 2 just because i would've liked it thicker.

Am eating my first bowl of this right now.  Made it exactly as stated.  Quite delicious, will make again.  You have to kind of hover around the stove so that you don't overcook either the potatoes or the fish but it is worth it!

This soup was easy to make and very tasty on a cold day.  As suggested by others,  I increased the Old Bay Seasoning to 1 tsp. I also used 2 cans of minced clams.  I mixed the clam juice with the flour (it came to 1 cup) and added the clams to the soup.  I only had one can of evaporated milk and that seemed to work fine too.  All in all, a great soup!

OK, I know we're weird- but we're low-carbing so we used turnips instead of the potatoes.  It turned out REALLY yummy!  First time I've ever made a chowder- I can't believe how easy it was.  This is definitely a keeper.

My husband really loved this fish chowder.  I made a few changes.  I substituted 8 strips bacon for the butter, which I chopped in 1/4 inch pieces and then sauteed until crisp (needed to pour off some of the drippings to get down to 2 T) and then added onions and celery.  I also added 2 cloves of diced garlic to this.  When these were almost tender I added the mushrooms.  I did all else as decribed in the original recipe.  It made a good fish chowder and fairly simple to do!  Thank you for the good recipe...

we loved it!  thank you for the recipe.   made it per the recipe just added a splash of white wine to the saute and a couple carrots for color.  oh and just for our preference we like chowders spicier (added cayenne) and on the thick side so i added a few instant potato flakes at the end to quick thicken it which was great but i think it did change the texture from what was intended, we were hungry though no time to flour thicken again. flavor was wonderful and delicate, we topped with a few french fried onions and paired with an alton brown recipe for creamed corn corn bread with a drizzle of maple syrup.  yum went nicely with the spicy chowder.  one thing maybe someone can tell me, but my fish sort of disappeared texture wise.  i followed the recipe and i didn't have any chunks of fish.  it was still really great, maybe that's how it's suppose to be.  maybe i needed thicker fillets.

Great quick recipe. I usually use grouper. I add a can of clams, cayenne, and increase the chicken stock to 2 cans. Careful when cooking the potatoes, don't cook all the way. I also use 2 cooked potatoes and 1/2 c corn pureed to thicken it instead of the flour. Oh and also some fat free sour cream added at the end to make it richer. Love this recipe, easy to have all the ingredients on hand. I actually reheated and served it to company!!

This didn't do it for me.  It was VERY bland as written.  I ended up using about a Tsp. of Old Bay, 1 Tsp. lemon pepper seasoning, 1 Tsp. salt, dash of smokey paprika, dash of red pepper.  Still thought it was a bit fishy, used Tilipia, which shouldn't have been fishy, and not much flavor.  Won't make again and shows we all have different tastes.  Husband said it was good but only had 1 bowl.

This was ok, for being my 1st chowder.If you make this ADD MORE SEASONING. I was expecting more thickness and a little more creamy-ness. I will alter this recipe the 2nd time around for sure. Also I will finely chop the mushrooms next time due to that fact that I have 2 small ones that didn't care for the "sliced" mushrooms. OVERALL ****'S

It tasted like something that I have eaten in a nice restaurant!  It was really easy to make and had a really great taste!  I made a few substitutions based on earlier reviews.  I replaced one of the cans of evaporated milk with 1 can of creamed corn and used about 1 tablespoon of the old bay seasoning (instead of 1/8 tsp).  A salad and some cheese biscuits made the meal complete.

I love this recipe. I have made this several times now- it was a huge hit for Christmas eve dinner. I add shrimp, scallops, clams and corn as well. Must be careful to not cook too much after adding cod(or haddock) because it breaks down, so I add it in big chunks & cook it for several minutes longer until cooked thru. I also add a splash of sherry and some extra butter- yum!! Thanks!

Excellent! Even my skeptical husband loved it! Based on reviewers' suggestions, I altered the recipe as follows: First, I cooked it in my slow cooker (low, 8 hours); omitted the mushrooms, added a stalk of celery, decreased potatoes to about 2 cups, decreased cod to 1.5 lbs., added a good palmful of Old Bay (it had some kick!), added one tuna-sized can of minced clams with juice, and added 3/4 lbs. of scallops. I also only used one can of evaporated milk, and added that in the last hour of cooking. Next time will try with some chunked lobster meat. Thanks for the great recipe--it will be a standard!

Definitely add more Old Bay.  Also, I substituted a can of cream of mushroom for the extra can of milk.  I used Striped Bass and it worked great.  I also added some can corn to give it a little more color.

This recipe was really nice, simple, and delicious.  We used Tilapia b/c that is what I had in the fridge.  I also omitted the mushrooms, and only had celery seed.  I looked up Old Bay Seasoning and just added what it had listed.  My family as a whole enjoyed this recipe and there were no leftovers from 4 of us!!

Tis chowder is very good and I will definitely make it again. I agree that extra seafood needs to be added which I did; clams, shrimp, and scallops. I also added the cream corn which added more body to the chowder and I definitely used more of the Old Bay then the recipe called for. It was very tasteless without the extra.

This recipe was EXCELLENT!  I highly recommend using the "Seasoned" Chicken Broth that is seasoned with garlic.  The only other changes I made were:  
1.  Used two cans of minced clams - mixed the juice w/ flour and put clams in the soup - DELISH!  
2.  Used 1 can of evaporated milk  
3.  Used catfish instead of cod

Excellent Recipe..  I didn't have "Old Bay Seasoning" so I googled it.. found the ingredients (mustard seed, celery salt, red pepper, cinnamon and ginger).. I had all of these so I added a splash of each..  I also added a bit of Tobasco.
It was wonderful with crunchy bread!!

Went heavy on the veggies (celery and mushrooms), used tilapia as the fish, and subbed half & half for one of the cans of evaporated milk.  Also, you'll want A LOT more Old Bay.  The result: fantastic!  A few drops of Tabasco or another hot sauce in the bowl along with some sourdough bread on the side makes this incredible... one of my new favorite recipes.

I really liked this recipe but I did modify it a little.  I added a can of crab meat, which added another texture and subtle flavor.  And I used Red Snapper my husband had caught deep sea fishing instead of cod. Next time I might add cream or something for a slightly creamier flavor.  But overall, very good!

This recipe is incredible, the chowder was better than what I've had a many restaurants. I used 2x the Old Bay for more kick as well as frozen flounder instead of cod and it was insanely delicious, an absolutely 5 star recipe.

It was "chowdery", but a bit lack luster.  I did feel it could have had a little more flavor.  I changed a few things:
#1. upped the Old Bay to 1 teaspoon
#2. upped the mushrooms
#3. used 1# fish,and 1# fresh shrimp 
#4. minced up 1 heaping tablespoon of fresh ginger
#5. When the soup was done cooking I tossed in a handfull of minced fresh Cilantro.  
#6. Served with bacon to sprinkle on top, along with shredded med cheddar cheese.

My company RAVED ABOUT IT!  When soup is good the first night you KNOW it's going to be even better the second night!

Original recipe was 4 stars, but once I reved it up... I felt it was 5 star!

We always have a chowder during our annual carol sing and this was the new recipe we used.  Where we live it is difficult to get some of the seafood mantioned,  and we used cod as one of the main ingredients.  It turned out great and everyone loved it.  This is a keeper : )

We are from the East Coast in Canada and know our fish chowders!  This one was loved by all and especially by the cook because it was so easy!  I doubled the butter, celery, mushroom and only added 1 can of milk.....it's a keeper!

This was really good!  I used a mixture of fish- catfish, cod and swai. I also used half and half instead of evaporated milk. I didn't use potatoes either- making it low carb and used about 3 Tb of flour instead of the half cup. Unfortunately I was out of celery, so used some chopped carrots instead and used 1 pound of fresh mushrooms chopped in half. I added some thyme and parsley and extra black pepper. This is really, really good and I plan on making it a lot! I think it would also be really good w/ either a can of creamed corn it it or some frozen corn thrown in, and maybe some bacon crumbled on top.

We LOVE this chowder! I've made it twice in the past month (and my family rarely likes repeats, except of true favorite dishes). I added chopped carrots and a can of clams (including the juice). Also increased the Old Bay (esp since we live in Maryland!!!) to 1 tsp+. Awesome recipe, thank you for sharing!

My husband and I have made other Fish Chowder recipes before; but after we made this recipe yesterday....."by far this is the best we've had" We look for easy not time consuming and healthy meals for our family.   This was easy not time consuming and the kids can't get enough of it...

Very nice and easy recipe.  I had to leave out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them (unless he can't actually see them).  He's a native New Englander and said that it was as good as any he'd ever tasted - high praise!

Fantastic! I didn't have clam juice so I added another cup of chicken stock. Instead of evaporated milk added a cup of cream.  And the last 3 minutes also added shrimps. Definitely a winner!

I am from Cape Cod & I know chowder! I've attempted to make chowder before & failed miserably. This was not only easy but SO tasty!! The only thing I changed was using instant potato flakes instead of flour to thicken the chowder and I seasoned the chopped fish with old bay before adding it to the stock. Oh & I'm a vegi-fishatarian (I don't eat any meat except fish) so I used veggie stock instead of chicken stock. I don't know what people are talking about when they say it's bland... it's not CLAM chowder people, it's FISH chowder! If you want that clam taste use ALL clam juice instead of chicken (or veggie) stock! I also used a mixture of cod & haddock- both are white fish so they both work well. AMAZING! I'm so unbelievable excited to make this again- fast, easy and SOOOOO GOOD!!

Used a whole gang of Old Bay and followed a reviewer's suggestion of adding whole bottle of clam juice.  But it was still a bit bland for my taste.

This was my first time making fish chowder and this recipe came out great! I used low sodium broth to make up for the very salty clam juice. I think next time I might just use 1 cup evaporated milk and maybe 3 cups potatoes. I topped with turkey bacon and used a little hot sauce. Delicious!

This was good. We all liked it. It reminded me a lot of clam chowder, but with a slightly different fish flavor. I would make this again for sure. Definitely a hardy meal that warms the belly on a cold night.

I made this fish chowder for Christmas Eve supper and it was a BIG hit. So easy to prepare and very delicious.  I didn't change a thing, and it is a family favorite already. Maybe make it for New Years eve too.

Seriously good chowder. Although I limit my food intake to veggies and fish/seafood, I am not one who generally appreciates corn or other random veggies in a chowder so I tried this recipe the minute I realized it didn't have all of that. I only used one can of evaporated milk and added a splash of red wine vinegar to the end of the cooking process. Everything else was exactly as written. Thanks for posting this and an even bigger thanks to those fisherman who shared!

My version kind of had everything but the kitchen sink in it... couldn't get enough fresh Cod so I added clams, scallops, shrimp and a few other goodies we had at the house also added a can of corn... 7 yo ate it with no complaints, hubby and I both enjoyed it a lot but ended up with WAY more than what I would call the 8 servings as we had 5 bowls amongst us the first night and had to package and freeze leftovers enough to have it 2 more dinners! Definitely halving the recipe next time!!! Also adding more spices next time around... just a little bland for us but a great base to play with and make your own!

My family enjoyed this chowder. I did make a few adjustments by adding more mushrooms and celery. I also added 1 cup of corn. I did not add the clam juice (did not have). I also increased the Old Bay to 3/4 teaspoon. Will make again.

I have made this twice now, and while I tweaked it both times, the base recipe is a great start.  I eliminate the butter and use olive oil, use low sodium veggie broth  (don't eat chicken), and add a ton of other seafood.  This last time I made it I added a pound of bay scallops, 1 lb shrimp and one can of minced clams.  I cut back on the amount of clam juice and just use what is in one can of clams, and then add white wine for the rest of the liquid.  The first time I made this I used cod, the second I used tilapia.  Definitely prefer tilapia, cod just had too little flavor and completely dissolved in the broth.  Also, the second time I didn't even bother cutting the fish.  I do add at least a tablespoon of old bay, and remember old bay has salt in it, so I would use a stock with very low sodium and then hold on adding any extra salt until you get the flavor you want.  Also, the second time I used leeks instead of celery, which I was a little worried about, but I was thrilled with the results, it added that little something that was missing the first time around.

Really good recipe and pretty foolproof, although I did accidentally overcook my potatoes (totally my fault-- but absolutely follow the times listed).   I used 2% evaporated milk and added much more Old Bay and thought it was great. Next time I will probably skip the celery and maybe skip 1 can of milk. Still really good and has enough flavor IMO, especially after adding a good sprinkling of pepper.

I adapted the recipe to my slow cooker and it was really good. Definitely add more Old Bay and plenty of black pepper.

This would make a great clam chowder.  I love cod, but it totally fell apart in the soup and it's such a mild fish, you don't really taste much of it with all the other ingredients.  I had to add an additional cup of chicken stock and I used at least a full teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning.

I used heavy cream instead of evap. milk (just eyeballed it) as I don't care for its sweetness in soup. I also omitted the mushrooms as I've never had chowder with mushrooms before, and I didn't much like the idea of it. Finally, I definitely recommend sprinkling some crumbled crispy bacon on top. Thanks!

Outstanding! Made a few changes: Used 1/2 tsp. old bay instead of what's called for. Added 1/2 tsp. basil and used 1 1/2 lbs cod, 1/2 pound of bay scallops. Cooked the vegetables in bacon drippings. Really great!

Fabulous!  I've made it several times & the only thing different I did was add more Old Bay.  Today, I made it & substituted the cod with shrimp.  Delish!!

Excellent recipe.  Hubby had seconds. :)  I threw in a small can of clams since I only bought about 1.25 lbs. of fish.  I also had only about 3 c. potatoes instead of 4.  Turned out great though, and not too thick.  Love the low fat content!

Wow this recipe is excellent.
I used more celery, three stalks, and 1 chopped onion, and thawed bay scallops. The scallops were perfect. After adding the evaporated milk I put it back on the stove long enough to heat to serving temperature. Served with green salad and toasted garlic bread wonderful. The recipe says 8 servings but this as a main course it fed 6 adults.

I loved this recipe.  I added scallops and the whole pot dissappeared.  It's not too thick.  The flavor is mild and well balanced.  I live in Massachusetts and have had many different "chowdas" and this one is excellent.

Wonderful as directed!  The second time we made it, I modified this by adding shrimp, scallops and using tilapia in place of the cod.   I also used a lobster stock that we made last time we had lobster in place of the clam juice.   Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe, very simple to make. I added sweet corn; it tasted great and gave the soup added texture. Served it with some warm french bread and it made a very satisfying meal.

Great recipe!  We made a couple of changes:  We used Tilapia because that's what we had, We used about 1 1/2 tsp old bay seasoning, doubled the mushrooms, added some shoepeg corn, topped it with crisp bacon and soup crackers.  Thanks for the wonderful meal, we'll definitely make it again.

This is very, very good.  My husband loves it, and guests always like it, too.  I substitute bell pepper for the celery just because I hate buying a bunch of celery and only using 1 or 2 stalks.  I have made it several times with evaporated milk, but most recently I used 2% milk instead based on other reviews.  I do think it came out better this way.  We don't have cod readily available on the west coast, so I usually use catfish.

This is the BEST chowder ever!! I've made this at least 5 times and it comes out perfect every time!  I've added shrimp, clams, scallops, and any kind of mild white fish.

Very very good. Followed recipe more or less exactly except - used tilapia, and a handful of shrimp and scallops (leftovers). Also didn't have (or use) the clam juice and used regular milk - not evap. But this was so rich, creamy and tasty! Will make again and use this as a "base" for adding other ingredients!

Loved this soup!  I have never made soup in my life (other than opening a can) and I must say I was pretty impressed with myself!  :)  Like many of the other posters, I added a lot more Old Bay and salt and pepper.  I also used tilapia instead of cod since I couldn't find any cod.  It turned out great.  One last thing - I liked it better after a few days in the fridge - seemed like the flavor was stronger.

After reading the reviews, I did expect this chowder to be bland, and it was, so I was ready, and incorporated some of the other reviewers suggestions. I used bacon grease and a little butter to cook the veggies in, used way more mushrooms. I used 1# cod and 1# shrimp, increased the Old Bay to about 2 tsp. Added some cajun seasoning, lots of salt and pepper and some cayenne pepper (I didn't measure, all to taste, we like a little spicy). Only used 1 can of evaporated milk, adding 1T butter along with it. With these adjustments,it was very good, nice and thick and I will probably make it again but will try using herb seasoned chicken stock instead of plain next time to help with the flavoring.

Recipe is a pretty decent chowder.  Nice and hearty.  I added a can of clams which had use in it.  Since I didn't have chicken stock - I used condensed cream of chicken soup.  It was decent but I still prefer New England's clam chowder :)

This is a real treasure!  Few suggestions: Just use 1 can of evaporated milk.  Also add some minced red pepper and corn kernels with the cod for color and extra goodness.

I've made this recipe a few times, once with chopped fresh clams, once with haddock, and once with cod, clams, and shrimp together. I love mushrooms but don't include them in this recipe because I just don't think they go on chowder, but otherwise this is an excellent, tasty recipe. And I live in Massachusetts, so I've had a LOT of chowder in my life!

Used 1 can of evaporated milk and half pint of cream.  Added a good shot of sherry and some nutmeg.  Could also add a few red pepper flakes for a kick if you like that.  How could that not be delish.

Great recipe.  My mom is from Maine and said this recipe is very close to what she had as a child - except the mushroom (which I left out).  Instead of using flour to thicken the soup, I shred part of the potato and cook with the rest of the ingredients.  The starch in the potato thickens it up nicely.

I didn't dislike this recipe but it wasn't my favorite chowder.  It was pretty one dimensional.  I made it as stated except that I subbed carrot for the celery since I dislike celery.  After it was done I added extra Old Bay but that didn't fix it.  I put in a lot of garlic salt and then finally thought to add some sherry and a little heavy cream.  That improved it dramatically but even with that change it only brought it up to four stars.  The husband is on his second bowl (after he added even more sherry) but neither of the kids liked it.

What an excellent recipe.  I added about a tablespoon of Old Bay and used a tsp of celery seed because I didn't have any celery.  Any kind of fish would do for this outstanding recipe.  I used what was in the freezer - a piece of flounder, a piece of salmon and some whitefish. Yum

I loved this recipe! I used Striper for my fish-alot of it this time of year for our area-I took the advise of ReeRee's Kitchen and used a bit more Old Bay Seasoning, Mexicorn rather than mushrooms (don't like them) and 1.5 tsp liquid smoke-the liquid smoke brought all the flavors together-devine! I will make this again for sure but I will probably cook my potatoes separate and spoon them in at the end because they cooked so quick that by the time it was ready they were falling apart and i followed the times exactly...I used Yukon so it may be the type of potato-Thanks for sharing!

This was lovely. I turned it into a seafood chowder and added chopped shrimp and crab at the very end. Next time I would add a bit of sherry...maybe some roasted corn and red pepper. Easy to make. Nice for company as well.

Couldn't be better or easier! I skipped the celery, Old Bay seasoning, clam juice, and flour and it STILL made a fantastic soup. Takes me back to my childhood--mmmmm!

I loved this soup!  I modified it a bit by adding extra mushrooms, frozen corn and some bacon, and also used lots of extra old bay and toni's Cajun spice instead of salt. Topped with oyster crackers and hot sauce it was delicious. Will make again

I use this site for recipe scoping, & generally incorporate others' suggestions.  Modifications were: 1) Subbed 2% milk for evaporated milk 2) Subbed Tilapia for Cod 3) Subbed corn for mushrooms 4) Tripled celery 5) Added 1.5 tsp hickory flavored liquid smoke 6) left out salt & pepper (better to let people add it to taste & according to any diet restrictions).  Cooked in crock pot on high temp for 4 hours & served with Rosemary Ciabatta bread & tossed salad w/ balsamic vinaigrette.  Made a pleasant, satisfying, wholesome meal that was not too heavy.  Somewhat bland, so added liquid smoke, but may add more Old Bay if I make it again.  Seems fairly healthy & easy, so makes for a nice, warm satisfying dish that you can feel good about eating & serving to your family.  Easy to make, but giving it only four stars because it is rather bland as written & needs doctoring to make it interesting enough to want to eat.  I recommend adding spices according to your taste (we liked liquid smoke, salt & more Old Bay seasoning...other recommendations included Thyme & Marjoram).  Bon Appetit!

Delicious Chowder!  I added more celery, 1 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, no clam juice, no flour & used milk instead of evaporated milk.  Also, added 1 tsp thyme. Tripled the recipe and only added 3 lbs. of fish, used Tilapia.  My family enjoyed it immensely.

This was really good & so easy to make!! I used more chicken stock instead of the clam juice cause I didn't have any on hand & used about 1 1/2 cups of milk in place of the evaporated milk again didn't have it on hand. I tasted it before serving & it was a little bland so I added garlic powder more salt & pepper & a little paprika. Next time I will saute some fresh garlic in with the onions & mushroom mixture. Very good with the changes!

This is a wonderful recipe. I used 2 whole tilapia instead of cod. I filleted them and used the bones to make fish stock intead of using chicken stock. I didnt have mushrooms so I added corn. other than that I stuck to the recipe and it was wonderful. I served it with corn bread. mmm mmm

Quite good! not as creamy (aka healthier) as using half & half, but to each his own.  I followed some of the other users' suggestions: increased the Old Bay Seasoning, added corn and carrots, as well as clams & scallops.

Found a pound of haddock in the freezer that was past-prime for serving plain, so got another pound of cod and combined them. First time I've made a chowder of any kind, and it came out really well, and easy to prepare! Twiddled the seasoning a small amount for my tastes and added a couple slices of chopped bacon - and some drippings - as it cooked, but as written would've been just fine, too. Yum.

My husband's a commercial fisherman so I'm always looking for new recipes for fish, and this one is definetely one I'll make again. I used fresh Permit(whitefish), used bacon instead of butter, and added carrots, and the whole family loved it!

We all really liked this and everyone had seconds - my husband, myself and our one year old. The only change I made was I used sole instead of cod because we had some sole that needed to be used up. Also I wasn't sure whether the potatoes were supposed to be cooked or raw - I had some boiled potatoes to use up so I added them instead using raw ones.

I have been on this site for years and have never rated anything. This soup is so good and so easy that I felt like I literally had to comment. I only had 1 lb of some random white fish in the freezer and only 1 can of evaporated milk, so I was short 1 can of milk and 1 lb of fish. I added an extra cup of chicken stock to compensate. I did add in 3 cubed potatoes and a can of corn for some texture. Even missing some stuff, this chowder turned out delicious.

The only changes I made were to add a lot more mushrooms. I halved the recipe for just my husband and me.  It was only okay the first meal but tasted much better when we had it the second night (even halved it makes a lot).  If I make it again I will use less flour as it was a little too thick and slightly "flourie"tasting which I didn't notice the second time around.  Next time I will add clams and maybe some shrimp too.  It needs a little more spice, but I don't know what that would be...pepper? garlic?

I LOVE this recipe. Instead of condensed milk and clam juice I added almond milk, an extra cup of flour, 3 extra celery stalks and a whole package of corn. I also added rosemary, oregano, and red pepper flakes. I highly recommend this to everyone!

I made this fish chowder last night for supper and it was very good and very easy to prepare. I warmed up the leftovers for supper tonight, it was even better warmed over the favors had blended more and it was delicious.   I used fat-free evaporated milk, added extra onions, used onion powered, used olive oil instead of butter and added baby scallops to the mix. It was very good.  It’s a very easy recipe to change up for a little different twist.  This is a keeper.

Super!  I cooked some bacon in the stock pot first (omitting the butter of course) and then cooked the onions and celery (added garlic) in the bacon fat - mmmm!.  Substituted tilapia for the cod and used gluten free rice flour instead of the all purpose flour to make it a gluten free chowder!

Five star recipe!!!!  Tastes just like Campbell's clam chowder and restaurant clam chowder.  I LOVE IT.  Have made this several times, and each time it's fantastic.  We don't get celery where I'm living, so I substitute chopped green bell pepper instead, and it adds a nice extra 'bite.'  To lower the calorie content just a bit, I will usually cut down or eliminate the flour.... which of course takes away some of the thickness of the soup, but we all have to make sacrifices, right?  :-)  No clam juice readily available here, so I usually just use the fish juice from the thawing frozen fish or substitute the juice from a can of tuna.

I used bacon as in a traditional chowder, added corn, and used more Old Bay.  This is excellent.  I haven't even added the milk yet, and it has such a delicious and rich flavor. Can't wait for dinner!

This is a great chowder. I followed the recipe and used cod, bay scallops, and shrimp and almost a tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. The result was very rich, creamy and delicious and a definite keeper.

This is FANTASTIC!!  I am really trying to eat a little better---and it is hard to believe that this is a low fat chowder!  I brought this over for my family and they all loved it---there were no leftovers!!  I used one can of fat free evaporated milk and one can of regular just to see what it would taste like and it was still wonderful!!  Thank you so much for the recipe....I will be making this often!!

My family loved this!  I doubled the amount of celery and mushrooms and added diced green peppers.  I also used seafood stock in the base for a more developed flavor and 1 cup of cream instead of the evaporated milk.  Truly divine - especially when topped with smoke kissed bacon bits.

Chowder was wonderful--some of the best soup I've ever made! Used cod as called for (diced when partially frozen)and did add some diced carrot (for color), dash of dill, and some Minor's clam soup base for extra flavor. Shared with a friend who absolutely loved it. Can't wait to make it again for company.

Without changes, this is definitely NOT a 5-star recipe.  And everyone that rated it a 5 star made tons of changes!  I don't get that!  Anyway, instead of a whopping 1/2 cup of flour, we pureed 2 cooked potatoes and 1/2 can of corn... then we we added the clam juice, we only had to add 3 tbsp on flour to it before mixing it in.  Also, omitted mushrooms and added a can of corn when we dropped the fish.  And used 2 cups fish stock, 1.5 cups chicken stock and 1/2 cup of cream.  It does need a LOT more seasoning, so we doctored it up with salt, pepper, old bay and cayenne.  I think worcestershire would give it a nice flavor and depth too.  Thanks for the base, but be prepared to do some "tweaking".

PERFECT for a chilly, rainy evening.  I made this in a crockpot and used frozen orange roughy since that is what I had. Additional ingredients I threw in were frozen corn, diced carrots, and with 30 minutes to go, I added 12 large frozen shrimp.  After the soup was ladled into bowls, I sprinkled a smidge of freshly grated parmesan cheese on top for an added layer of flavor.  My husband and I LOVED LOVED LOVED this chowder.  Thanks for sharing, Amythe!

Awesome!  Changes I made were omitted mushrooms, 2 celery stalks, 2 flounder filets (will use more next time), 1tsp Old Bay (will use more next time) 1 can of clams & reserved juice which was 1/2C to mix with flour.  I added 1/2C chicken broth to clam juice to total 1C to mix with the flour.  Instead of evap milk I used 16oz of 2% milk.  

This was smooth, creamy and rich without having to use heavy cream.  The taste was better than most I have had in restaurants and this will definitely be in heavy rotation at our house.

I'm from the New England coast- this was very,very good. Quick to prepare, tastes like you worked very hard. I left out the mushrooms- didn't feel they were authentic. I don't understand the reviews where people complained about the taste of evaporated milk in the recipe. Sometimes people confuse condensed milk with evaporated...
will make this again and again.

Incredibly flavorful and hearty.  I used haddock instead of cod, ommitted the mushrooms and chopped up an additional stalk of celery.  I served this with slabs of Irish soda bread for a very filling lunch!

Fabulous taste, nothing but rave reviews from friends and family who get to taste it. 

I can't find any Old Bay Seasoning, so I leave it out. I also added a can of creamed corn a couple of times and a can of loose corn another. I prefer the creamed. 

I have made it without the clam juice when I didn't have any. Still great, but I prefer with the juice. 

And I like it with more mushrooms, say 8 oz. Try crimini or any of the more flavorful ones.

Thanks for posting this recipe.

Good chowder!  Cooked bacon, then the onion and celery in some of the bacon drippings (no mushrooms).  Mashed the potatos a little before adding the fish.  Nice comfort food.

**I'm upgrading my review.  This chowder tasted much better the 2nd day!  I still say it needs some doctoring to suit your tastes**

I was underwhelmed with this chowder.  I followed the tip to cook the mushrooms, celery, and onion in bacon drippings but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It definitely needs some doctoring, ie more Old Bay, scallops perhaps, etc.  I also didn't care for the cod.  I don't eat fish often so I didn't know what to expect of the cod beforehand.  The bacon adds a nice depth to the flavor. I won't use this recipe again.

I had some mushrooms that needed to be used so I added extra & I used green onions. Instead of cod, I used red snapper that my son caught on a fishing trip. Hubby said the snapper was a pain to cube & that we are grilling the rest, just in case you were wondering. LOL I cut back on the spuds & used 2% organic milk to make it more figure-friendly & I increased the Old Bay quite a bit. Thansk Amy The!

I'm not the fish eater in my family, but my husband ate this 3 meals in a row when I first made it.  He raved about it.  We used halibut cheeks I bought while on a trip to Alaska, hubby says that is one reason it's so yummy - the cheeks are very rich. I accidentally bought the 5oz evaporated milk, so I supplemented with half & half!  That made it even better, I am sure :)

I made this recipe with an open mind...I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was fantastic! I gave several bowls away, and they were well received, too. I will certainly make this again. The bacon bits are a good addition; I think next time I will add some corn and green/red pepper as well.

I made this for visiting inlaws. They love fresh fish especially knowing my husband is the one who caught the fish! So I used the bluegill filets I had in the freezer from an earlier fishing trip. And I added a small bag of frozen shrimp (thought I wouldn't have enough fish). Man, this was really great and not that hard to make! We all loved it~I will totally make this again~it made me look like a great chef!

This chowder had a great flavor, I used much more Old Bay and rockfish from the Chesapeake. I think that the amount of thickener (flour) called for is way too much, it was kind of 'goopy' and I am not sure if it was the flour or the evaportated milk but the color was an unappetizing gray-tan. Crumbled bacon on top was an excellent suggestion from another reviewer. I wouldn't make this again without some changes.

This was very good as well as healthy and filling. I used chopped carrot in place of the celery, added clams and a little extra clam juice. I also topped it with crumbled bacon and parsley. With a good roll it made a nice meal.

Great stuff!  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I upped the amount of OldBay to about a tsp ... but could have used even more.  The final result is a bit bland (but I tend to under-season, specifically under-salt).  I did substitute half-n-half for the evap milk, plus I added about three cups of ready-to-eat smallish frozen shrimp ... and a small bag of frozen shoepeg corn.  Yum!  A keeper!

This was fantastic.  I used tilapia instead of cod and left out the clam juice (I'm not a big seafood fan).  I loved it and even my two year old wanted more!  Will definately make it again and again.

I am from New England so I added a typical NE touch by frying up the vegies with salt pork. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning, giving the chowder a little more zip. My husband is allergic to all shell fish, so I put in chicken broth instead of the clam juice. No left-overs here! Now that's what we call Chowda!

I loved this recipe and so did my husband, in fact he said it was "screaming". I added some corn to it, but that's the only change I made.

This is a good base.  I added corn and a lot more mushrooms.  I used 1 lb. of cod and 1lb.bay scallops.  Next time, I will add crumbled bacon into the chowder.

This was an awesome recipe! I replaced 3/4lb of cod for shrimp, but next time i would use the whole 2lbs of cod as well as the shrimp. i also used just one can of 2% evaporated milk because i don't like chodwers that are really thick. It turned out really good and I served it with a loaf of three cheese bead I picked up from panera. overall the meal got rave reviews!

Tonight I fixed this recipe for the first time.  I added more mushrooms, sherry, hot sauce, and alot more Old Bay.  I used half bay scallops and half tilapia fish.  My chowder is excellent!  I think this recipe is great as a base.  Season to taste!

I used some frozen cod for this recipe that I couldn't cook well any other way.  It was delicious!  I also used skim evaporated milk to cut the fat a little.

I was impressed with myself that I could actually make something like this from scratch. Very nice. I did substitute half of the cod with red snapper, and it was tasty, tasty, tasty. I recommend to everyone that they buy only the freshest fish possible or else they can get a flavour that is too fishy.

Tried this recipe last night, and it was great!  I added extra Old Bay Seasoning and also added 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme.  As my husband said, "this one's a keeper".

Absolutely delicious! I didn’t add the mushrooms and added more Old Bay. As well, we used crappie instead of cod as we are avid fishermen! My husband raved over it and I loved it! Can’t wait to share this with friends!

Delicious fish chowder!  I made a few simple changes by not using evaporated milk.  I used 2 c. half and half.  Also, added 3 garlic cloves minced, 1 c diced sweet potato, 2 thinly sliced carrots & 1 tsp. marjoram, 1 tsp old bay plus 1 bay leaf : ).  Added fish and deglazed with 1 c. white wine to absorb flavors.   Lastly, added 1/2 c corn. Served in sourdough soup bowls. YUM : )  everyone (even those who claim they don't like cod) loved it!!

Delicious recipe. I did use 3 slices of lean bacon . This added so much flavor to chowder. Using 1/8 tsp of bay seasoning didnt do much to the overall taste of chowder. I kept the seasoning as is to 1/8 tsp. I did add some half  and half(1/4 cup) along with the evaporated milk.  Im sure using 1/4 heavy cream will make it creamier and richer. If at any time you want the consistency of chowder thicker, use some corn starch mixed with water. Let the chowder boil gently to let the starch do the thickening.
Thanks  Amythe for posting!

I didn't have mushrooms, celery, or clam juice when I made it and it was still delish!! I used Swai fish instead of Cod and celery seeds to still get the taste of celery. Also, I only used about two table spoons of flour to thicken it with water. Anyway, my family loved it!

This was delicious!  Okay, I had to make some changes to use what I had on hand, but it turned out great. No cod, so I  used today's catch...spot, black drum and whiting; husband is lactose intolerant so I substituted diary-free milk and no flour so I used Autry's seafood breader.  And some fresh thyme, cilantro and parsley. Despite myself, I got rave reviews! Thank you Amythe!

This was a joy as I am NOT a chowder fan! 
A few alterations: omitted the clam juice, used leftover grilled red snapper (that I mistakingly over salted), full carton of mushrooms in chunks, added half water with the 1/2 and 1/2 milk and added coconut oil with the sauté. It was lovely and my four year old son loved it as well.
The second time I did the same as above and used 2% milk and salted fish (that I typical use with Ackee) and it was still a hit at a potluck.

I added corn and bacon, and more Old Bay... quite possibly my new favorite chowder.

Great recipe! I wanted a lighter version so I omitted the evaporated milk entirely and added white wine and garlic broth from a batch of fresh mussels I made recently. Also added a can of baby clams with the juice and used sole fish and doubled the Old Bay. Delicious! Not so much creamy as just yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight and my 7-yr old had a second bowl.  We all finished our large bowls and declared the recipe a keeper.  I am always appalled when people list all the changes they make to a recipe during a review, but I must admit that I did change it a little.  Four cups of potatoes and two pounds of fish is a lot!  So I did increase the liquid:  I used a tablespoon of "Better than Chicken Bouillon" to 3 cups of water.  And I bumped up the Old Bay.  Didn't use cod either...I had some tilapia fillets and Mahi Mahi fillets in the fridge that I hadn't used, so substituted those.  The recipe is very good, especially with fat-free evaporated milk.  We didn't find it bland at all.  It does yield a lot, especially since I increased the liquid, but that was just my own doing.  It's a keeper in my house - a great way to use up extra fish fillets from other recipes.

This was great! I just made 1/2 for the 2 of us. I didn't have clam juice, so I added a can of chopped clams. I also added a splash of white wine. Sherry would be good also. I used swai, my new favorite white fish and homemade chicken stock.

All the adults who tried this, loved it...the kid's didn't want anything to do with it.  From reading the other reviews, I made a few adjustments.  More Old Bay - 1 full tsp., doubled the celery - I like celery, only used one can of evaporated milk - it was creamy enough for me.

So tasty and got better after simmering for an hour in my dutch oven. Didn't have mushrooms or celery so I substituted them with corn. Also we used fresh caught halibut and it was delicious!

Very good.  I followed the recipe closely but did make a few changes.  I omitted celery because I didn't have any, used 2 cups of clam juice because I wanted to use some I'd had a while, used 2 5 oz cans of evap milk cause that's what I had on hand.  I used tilapia and bay scallops and 2 cans of crab totaling 2 lbs in place of the cod cause that's what I had on hand.  I had never used Old Bay before but had a sample pkg on hand so I tried it.  It is very good and I ended up adding more, a little at a time until I had used 3/4 tsp.  Although it tasted very good at this point I still added my personal favorites in seasoning which were a good splash of sherry(real sherry-not cooking sherry), nutmeg, all spice, cayenne, ginger all to taste.  Let simmer and it was wonderful.  Served with a tossed salad and warm garlic bread. Thanks AMYTHE!

This is a keeper, satisfying and so easy to make. I have used a variety of white fish to make this.  When I say soup is for dinner my husband mopes but he doesn't consider this soup.  Hearty and satisfying/

Great soup! Made generally as is except for the following: added kernels of 2 ears of fresh corn, brancy to deglaze the sauteed vegetables and I used two cups of half and half instead the evaporated milk.

This is the best chowder. I don't put mushrooms in mine, but it is still wonderful. You can also use Talapia  or other fish (not catfish) in this recipe. There are never any leftovers when I make this.

I changed a few things. 
I used carrots with the onions and other veggies. used beef broth instead of chicken. We had a ton of fresh walleye to use up so that is the fish I used. I used half and half and one pint of heavy cream instead of the evaporated milk. I also used coconut oil instead of butter. All in all this had a wonderful taste, a very hearty soup. I will definitely make this again!

I've made this too many times to count.  I make it exactly according to the recipe and add canned corn.  I double the celery and increase the Old Bay seasoning to a heaping teaspoon.  It's a crowd pleaser every time.

Great! Added carrots but followed the rest as written. It had a very mild flavor, not fishy at all. Will make again and probably and more spices to jazz it up a little. Very comforting on a cold day.

I cut the recipe in half as I only had a pound of cod to work with. And I started out by making a roux by mistake as that is how I am used to making chowder. Anyway, that helped with other reviewers issues with an uncooked flour taste. I liked this recipe for it's ease...I did feel it was missing a vegetable...carrots or peas, perhaps? I'll experiment until I find the right one. But all in all a good recipe, thanks AMYTHE for posting!

We loved, loved, loved this fish chowder.  We made it with striped bass caught fresh and frozen just under two weeks.  We added lots more Old Bay (husband is a Marylander)and pondered making a roux with bacon grease but opted to keep this simple - didn't want to be cooking all night.  Perfect!

So easy and really quite tasty!  Even my 10 year old, who won't eat my favorite restaurant clam chowder, loved it.  I followed the recipe to a T except I did add one small can of chopped clams.  I didn't have bacon to top it with and think that would have been perfect.  It was a little flat but salt at the table fixed it for me. Overall it was a huge hit and we'll make it again!

Excellent chowder.  I had a pkg. of cod that needed to come out of the freezer and a new container of Old Bay Seasoning - a match made in heaven.

I used potatoes and evaporated milk in my husband's half and no potatoes and half and half in my half (Atkins diet) and no mushrooms because I didn't have any and no roux (Atkins again) with clam juice. I, instead, split a can of clams with the juice.  It was so good, I still have a smile on my face.

This was awesome.  I used Tilapia instead of Cod, and Clam sauce (with garlic and herbs) instead of Clam juice.  I started the fish in the slowcooker in the chicken broth while I prepped all other on the stove top, then let it all simmer and blend in the slowcooker for several hours, adding the milk in the last 2 hours.  Even the kids loved it!  And leftovers??? Ha! none...

This is really good!  I like more veggies so I added a bag of frozen peas, carrots, corn, & green beans.  It adds a bit more flavor & color.  I used 1 lb of mahi mahi and a 1 lb bag of frozen mixed seafood (shrimp, calamari, and scallops).  I used about 1.5 tsp. of Old Bay and lots of black pepper.  Also, 1 can of fat free evaporated milk was plenty for me!  This is wonderful!

Just made this tonight for dinner. MMMM I used a pound of mushrooms (which next time I'll saute first). I also put much more Old Bay than called for. Love this recipe!! I'm gonna play with it adding other items!

Just made this the other night with chopped up tilapia and shrimp. Awesome. Use a lot of Old Bay Seasoning. What the recipe calls for, is just not enough. Serve with some french bread. Yum

A good way to use leftover cooked fish. But this definitely needs more spices. I had fresh parsley on hand and a few shakes of Lawry's season salt. And I only added 1 can of milk. Why does it have to be evaporated, can't regular milk do the trick? My kids only ate one ladle full each. So my husband has 4 tupperwares for lunchtime leftovers

Delicious and easy for beginner cooks like me. :) Used haddock and homogenized milk, but no clam juice,  mushrooms or Old Bay. Seasoned with epicure crab dip seasoning and it was excellent.

This is a great recipe, I only used chicken broth (I didn´t have any clam juice) and it still came out great. The only change I made was I sauted the fish in olive oil seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper and salt and then incorporated it to the the broth and mushrooms mixture. Will be doing it again and very soon!

not a fan of evaporated milk.  it was excellent, though, when it was simmering with the fish.

Excellent!! Wasn't sure about the 2 cups of onions, but it was great. I didn't have the clam juice so just used extra broth. I did add about a pound of medium size shrimp and used orange roughy fish instead of the cod. My family raved over this so it is definitely a keeper. Great on a cold night.

I picked up all the ingredients at a small local store that did not have clam juice.  We made it without, using a traditional roux.  I had Turbot in the freezer and it worked nicely with this recipe.  My hubby the chef made his own version of Old Bay (didn't have at that store either).  Really great soup!!

So I mostly followed the recipe. For broth, I used the snapper carcass to make broth all day; about 3 quarts worth. Once that was ready, I used 12 cups of potatoes, cooked everything a lot slower and also used corn. Chowder is not chowder without corn. Of course, I adjusted the seasoning and and not to mention the broth was made from a Vermouth and vinegar base. I got the broth recipe from Sally Ofallon's Nourishing Traditions. Enjoy!

Very good start, added some minced clams and went heavier on all spices. Plus added some sour cream at the end. Cut the evaporated milk in half with milk. Came out excellent and was loved by all.

I used this as a jumping off point for a fish chowder recipe of my own. Delicious!! I recommend using 1part Heavy Whipping Cream and 2parts Milk instead of the evaporated milk. It makes for a richer soup. Also a little dash of nutmeg is an interesting addition. ;)

This was so good, I added a diced carrot with the onion and celery. I also added a can of chopped clams along with the Cod. I used a little more Old Bay than it called for but I think that should be added to taste. A warm crusty loaf of sourdough bread and everyone was happy!

Quite literally the best Chowder I have ever had. I followed the recipe to a T, scaled down for only 12oz of fish. The entire way through the process I had trepidations...it just seemed like the scaling was wrong. At each point though every thing turned out just correct. Thank you, oh the Old Bay spices are awesome. They had them at a Sunflower Market here in Tempe, AZ.   Fish Chowder in the desert!

This recipe is delicious, I am very pleased with the outcome! I love corn so I just had to add some, and insead of cod I used fresh caught smoked whitefish which tasted absoultly wonderful. I recomend this to anyone who loves a good chowder.

We enjoyed this soup last night while the rain poured down and the wind howled.  It is delicious comfort food that's good for you too.  The recipe seems to tolerate tweaking very well.  I used only one can of (fat-free) evaporated milk, added a can of chopped clams, upped the mushrooms and spices, and substituted haddock for cod.  My husband and I rate dishes on a scale from 1-10 and he said this is a ten.  It made a big batch but he said no, we should not share it with the neighbors.

I loved this recipe! It was fabulous and I'll use it again!  
I did add a little more Old Bay, and used white pepper instead of black.  And when I reheated some later, I added just a touch of Sherry, which made it even more awesome!

We loved this chowder.  Changes I made included adding diced carrots in lieu of mushrooms.  Increased the old bay seasoning as suggested.  Also I had learned from another chowder recipe that you can add the whole piece of fish (at least if you are using a flaky white fish) and you can easily break it apart  as it cooks. The second time I made this I used fingerling potatoes with the skin on.  Quick, easy and more vitamins!

used halibut, but was a little too fishy for our tastes. Added shrimp, and next time would only use imitation crab and shrimp to avoid the fishiness. Otherwise, the base was wonderful.

I tried this today for the first time and it is absolutely magnificent. Of course I made changes according to what I felt like having. I added two cups of clam juice and only one can of evaporated milk. I also took down the fish to 1 lb and added 1 lb of scallops and a can of baby clams. It was amazing. Thank you, this is going in my collection.

Other than adding a bit more Old Bay, as has been suggested, it really is a hearty dish. Will make this a regular dish in our household.

Great recipe, my husband and I loved it.  I had some little fillets of crappy and they worked perfectly.  Nice to not have to cook them up individually.  Excellent recipe.  Didn't have the spice called for but substituted 1 tsp thyme, and sprinkle of ground mustard, 2 cloves, and paprika worked just fine.

The only changes I made was adding sea scallaps as well as some cream.  Oh boy was this good.  Next time I'll use cheaper, smaller scallops since I had to cut them in half (so we wouldn't need knives while eating).  I'll make this again.

This was ok, but not exactly what I was looking for. I think I would have been better off using half & half instead of the ev. milk.  Mine turned out very thin and the cod fell apart into very tiny pieces.  The only thing that saved this were the scallops and shrimp I added.  I think I'll keep looking but thanks!

Made this for my husband last night, he said that it was excellent and this recipe is very similar to a soup that he used to make. I did add extras, I added a 1/2lb. of small bay scallops, 1 lb. medium shrimp, a can of minced clams and some carrots finely chopped and instead of using cod, I used fresh stripped bass ( husband & son are big fishermen). I definietly make this one again!!

Loved it. I used some clams and firm white fish. I added a carrot and substituted the onion with leek. It was beautiful. Especially that it has a 1/3 the fat as most chowders!

This recipe is outstanding.  I made a few substitutions, according to what I had on hand.  I used one pound of imitation crab meat and 1 12 oz. can of clams.  I substituted half and half for the evaporated milk.  In addition to crispy bacon and a few drops of hot sauce, I also added a bit of shredded cheddar.  We all loved it!  Thanks so much for the post Amy.

Rich, creamy, and delicious!  This recipe tastes fattening but it really isn't.  It reminds me of a blend of potato soup and clam chowder except instead of having the chewy bits of clam there is tender white chunks of fish.

Made some changes since we don't live where you can get good "fresh" fish. I didn't use the clam juice this time or the evaporated milk since I didn't have any on hand. I replaced with regular milk. Next time I'll use more mushrooms & Old Bay Seasoning. We think if you could use fresh fish from the coasts it would be fantastic.

Fantastic!  I used 2 cups chicken broth and 2 cups fish broth, and replaced the evaporated milk with skim milk.  Also added some white wine, pinch of dried thyme, tsp parsley and a bay leaf.  Will definitely make again!!

yummy! i used milk in place of the clam juice as i didn't have any and used regular milk in place of the condensed milk - still nice and creamy.  A handful of fresh parsley at the end adds a nice touch :)

This is a terrific recipe. I made some changes to suit my family's tastes -- doubled the mushrooms and celery, substituted vegetable stock for the chicken stock, and substituted vegetable broth for the clam juice. Also, as many others did, I used regular milk instead of evaporated. We'll make it again, for sure!

I turned this more into a stew than a chowder, omitting the flour and milk, replaced the cod with canned salmon, and the mushrooms with carrots, which still worked quite well. A very quick and easy recipe with a big flavor payoff!

This was the best fish chowder we've ever had! I was hesitant about the evaporated milk since I've always hated the taste of if, but it's excellent in the recipe. Couldn't find the clam juice so I just added a large can of clams. Also put in shrimp and used pollack (.99 a pound) instead of the cod.

I had clam broth left over from a clam bake, and used that instead of chicken broth for the base.  The soup was so delicious!  Like most soups, it was even better the next day--good thing the recipe makes a lot!  Can't say enough about how good this chowder is!

I made it with bacon and 3 types of fish: cod, trout, and catfish. I also used whole milk instead of condensed milk. It's excellent. Very flavorful, especially the cod.

This I will make again.  Didn't change much.  I added 1 tbls. of Old Bay and used chicken stock instead of clam juice since we do not like clams. I used heavy cream in stead of evaporated milk.  Used cod and shrimp.  Would cut cod into chunks, cod kind of disappeared when cut into one-half inch pieces. Very good recipe.  Oh, I also added a can of creamed corn, glad I did, it added to the flavor

Excellent ...  after reading the reviews, I added bacon ,  1 can of creamed corn, and a bit over a tablespoon of old bay seasoning in step 3.   I used 16 oz of half and half instead of the evaporated milk.   I'll definitely be using this recipe again!  The possibilities of combinations of seafood are endless.   This time, I used cod, salmon and crab.

I t was easy. The flavor did not "pop." Perhaps I was a little to easy with the Old Bay Seasoning? One person thought it lacked flavor so I added more Old Bay Seasoning, and the next person thought it was too spicy.  I will try it again.

Wonderful chowder recipe that I use as a base. Today I had about a pound each of frozen striper and black sea bass from last summers fishing. I also add about a half cup of Chardonnay to the recipe, and always substitute half and half or light cream instead of canned milk. No mushrooms handy, they always add a yummy depth, but this still rocked the family tonight.

This was really really good. Made as directed except I used low sodium chicken stock and no-salt in place of salt.  I also mixed in some crab meat with the cod.  Goes good with oyster crackers.

Since I bought my Cod at Costco, I had more than the recipe called for so I tryied to compensate by adding more liquid from 5 cans of clams. Then I added the clams. Delicious. I did add some Creole Seasoning which gave it some heat, and I had a full two teaspoon fulls of Bay Seasoning. Will definitly make this again.

I really liked this recipe. I needed a bit more spice so added about a 1/2 tsp of Old Bay rather than an 1/8 tsp. I used cod and tilapia because I had some in the freezer. It worked very well. I would definitely make this again!

Very good and easy to make.  Cut back on chicken broth and added an extra cup of clam nectar instead.  Next time would add a mixture of seafood rather than just the cod and maybe some frozen corn.

One of my favorite fish chowder recipes.  First time making a recipe I usually follow it exactly.  Second time I made this, I tweaked the recipe a little by using clam sauce instead of clam juice and adding a dash of sherry.

Really good! This is a very healthy chowder recipe, I did make my own Old Bay seasoning (from this site) otherwise I basically followed the recipe.  My fish was already cooked so I added it after the flour/clam juice and milk.

We really enjoyed this soup! It was super easy to make, tasted very rich without a great deal of fat, and you can use just about any kind of fish. I didn't have clam juice so I used a chicken bouillon and I didn't have old bay so I used a little dried tarragon (about .5 teaspoon) which is a nice herb to use with seafood. I will add this to my regular soup rotation!

Was awesome! I made this with some fresh Cusk (North Atlantic cod type fish) I had caught the day before and it came out terrific! 
Note: easy with the pepper, you can easily make it a little too spicy.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as prescribed but accidentally bought and had to use vegetable broth and I added some fresh corn on the cob I had in the fridge. I didn’t have bacon on hand.

A cool rainy spring evening and I need soup! Had most of the ingredients and this seemed like the taste I was after. Turned out delicious with cod and shrimp.  I did not have mushrooms (they seemed wrong anyway) or clam juice (used water).  Took other reviewers suggestions for Worchestershire and Sirracha but after it was all together and I determined what else it needed - for me.  I think the seasoning as listed would be fine for many but as with All Recipes it is great to adjust to personal taste.  Now wish a had a nice crusty loaf to go with this!  Next time I will be prepared.

This chowder was amazing! Great base recipe, I followed pretty close. In place of the butter I fried the bacon and used the bacon fat to saute the onion and celery. Then used the juice from a can of clams and added the clams to the soup and a little more Old Bay. Delish!

Absolutely loved this soup!   Even without the bacon.  Had some Whiting I didn't like on its own so I figured I'd use it in the chowder.   Off the charts good - no more canned chowder for me!

I really liked it. I only added 1 cup of evap milk and about 1+ tsp Old Bay. I also gave it a shot of white wine. I added scallops and a can of clams and I thought it was wonderful.

So creamy and super easy. I used whiting as we had excess in the freezer. Cut the many small fillets that were frozen together into big chunks and added as they were. Did cook a few minutes longer as they thawed and broke up. While this didn't give many large pieces of fish, it was delicious. Try adding bit of freshly ground pepper when serving. I made a half recipe and it was perfect for our dinner.

Very flavorful, thick, and satisfying. A lovely family meal on a cold day. This recipe also lends itself to a bit of personalizing; I added less potatoes and included some shrimp to make it a bit less carby. It was just as tasty.

I added quite a bit more Old Bay Seasoning and also Seafood Seasoning...You should taste along the way as this can be "bland".   Used bacon crumbles while cooking as per another suggestion and I luv plenty of onions...Used catfish nuggets, cod and baby shrimp...Other than that, pretty good..Also used seafood stock instead of chicken stock as I had it on hand

Made this with 2 lbs of halibut. Added a lot more Old Bay, Dill, and Tarragon. Didn't have any clam joined or evaporated milk so used more chicken stock and cream. Started with frying some bacon strips crispy and used the grease to brown the onions, celery and chopped mushrooms. Also added petite white corn and a squeeze of lemon really brightened the flavors!!!

This is a really good chowder! I pretty much followed the recipe, used up fish, shrimp and a few scallops that I had in my freezer. I did add 1.5 teaspoons of Old Bay. I had never included mushrooms in a fish soup and was curious about how the earthy flavor of mushrooms would combine with seafood- it works very well! I stayed away from the bacon as sometimes bacon can overpower more delicate flavors and I finished instead with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes which nicely provided contrast without dominating.

With all due respects to the fishermen go Bodega Bay, I added a can of baby clams with the juice, instead of just the clam juice, also threw in some sea scallops and shrimp in the final 2 minutes.......delicious.

Forty percent of the soup volume is composed of uncooked, unheated evaporated milk. This makes for a very dilute and bland fish chowder.

This was very, very good! We read reviews and added a nice bit of bacon when we browned the onions, etc. We threw in an entire teaspoon of Old Bay, as well as a goodly amount of fresh, chopped spinach. It was made on a Saturday for a Sunday ice fishing trip. While very good the day of, it got rave reviews on the ice the next day!

I used Swai instead of cod, and substituted fish sauce for the clam juice.  It was wonderfully delicious.  I have also made it with the clam juice which was also really, really good.  I don't usually like fish but this is very good!

Of course being from Minnesota...I used Crappie fillets!  Very good recipe!  I did not thicken this, we prefer thinner soup!  As others recommended I used 1 c. vegetable broth with 1 tsp fish sauce in place of the clam juice.   Also in place of the evaporated milk I used 1/2 almond milk (due to milk sensitivity) and raw milk.  Very good!

It turned out delicious. I did not include mushrooms as my husband is allergic. Instead of evaporated milk , I used milk and half-n-half.  I included a (drained) can of minced clams and a (drained) can of shrimp. Will make again!

I varied the recipe & substituted fat free condensed milk, did a mix of sweet & red potatoes, as well as a mix of mahi mahi & cod.  I also go heavy on the old bay.  My husband loved it & said one of the best chowder's ever!

I have to start off by saying that I NEVER cook. I decided to give this a shot and it came out AMAZING. I was very proud of myself! I substituted light cream for the evaporated milk but it was a bit too thick. Next time I may just use half & half instead but other than that my family absolutely loved how it came out. Perfect for a chilly fall or winter's evening.

This was terrific. I  made mine into seafood chowder, using fresh sole, 2 cans chopped clams, and 1/2 lb frozen shrimp. My husband prefers the mix of seafood. I like it either way. For seasoning I added 2 teaspoons old bay, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and used half and half instead of evaporated milk. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe AMYTHE!

Easy to make, I had to substitute milk instead of condensed milk, and added Turmeric to the spice mix. All worked well.

Just awful. The evaporated milk made it sweet, and not creamy at all, just milky-looking. Bland - and I even added more seasoning than was called for.

I didn't have mushrooms, clam juice nor evaporated milk. So I used yellow canned corn instead of mushrooms. After simmering the fish, I stir in 1 can of coconut milk with the flour. For seasoning I made a blend of cardamomo, paprika and cumin. My girlfriend just couldn't believe it.... She said she missed me ha. Thanks!

My whole family LOVES this chowder!! Do not cook the potatoes as long as it says to or they will be mush. I put the potatoes and fish in at the same time and cook them till the potatoes were as hard a I like them, then I completed the recipe as instructed. I also used Swai fish instead of cod, but this recipe would work great for any type of seafood.

This was soooo good! I added shallots, more celery, bell pepper and 2 jalapeños. I changed the white potatoes to sweet potatoes and added extra Old Bay seasoning as well as whole milk at the end instead of evaporated milk. It was wonderfully creamy and had some heat too! Great!

I am from New England but now living in CO so I sure miss recipes like this. I made a few alterations and it turned out so delicious. I used smoked salt which gave it such a rich kettle flavor. Also, I added 2 teaspoons of Herbs de Provence and used only one can of milk. The finishing touch was a squeeze of Siracha. MMMMMMM

I added a bit less than 1/2 tsp. salt,  a bit more than 1/4 tsp. black pepper and near-doubled the Old Bay seasoning..  I also added a full bottle of clam juice and, in place of evaporated milk, I used half and half. (I didn't have any evaporated milk.  Next time and, for sure, there will be a next time, I'll try white pepper.

Yum. This is a keeper you can make if you have any leftover white fish from some other recipe. Just use whatever variety you have on hand in this. I had pollack and tilapia and it was great. I halved the recipe because it looks like it is made to feed an army and I still had a large pot of soup. I used Knorr veggie bouillon cubes for the broth instead of chicken because it is what I had and like best and I skipped the mushrooms, they are not at all necessary. Just season to taste, like most people I ended up using lots of old bay. I added a touch of smoked paprika too. Toward the end when it was time to add the evaporated milk I liked the taste so much I felt I could have just as easily omitted it and still had a great thick and rich chowder but I added it anyway. I'm sure I'll be making this a lot.

The only changes I made to this recipe were that I sautéed the vegetables in 1 Tbs butter and 2 chopped slices of thick cut bacon. I cut the fish in about a 1-2 inch dice. After 20 minutes the potatoes were overcooked and having only cooked the fish for the 10 minutes specified in the recipe the fish had completely fallen apart. I tried adding more OBS but it can't disguise the unwelcome taste of the condensed milk. Oh, and even using 2# of fish I only needed 1 can of milk. I'm shocked that so many people liked this recipe. If you're trying to cut down on fat I suggest going with a tomato based soup with clam juice and fennel seed. If it's chowder you're after, find a recipe that calls for cream.

Really happy with my first attempt! Family has all given it the thumbs up.  Here are my notes: Used cubed Mahi and diced shrimp.  My batch wanted more salt and Old Bay.  Used white pepper for a spicier flavor.  Wish I would have only used one can of Evaporated milk for better liquid solid ratio.  Might swirl in a dash of sherry before serving.  Great base recipe with so many possibilities!

This is wonderful, especially on a cold Winter day! It's perfect as written, but I like to do half cod and half scallops. I also add some crushed red pepper toward the end of the cooking time to give it a little heat. Thanks for the recipe, AMYTHE!

I made this tonight.  The boss cook gave it raves.  I searched the reviews and found changes to the recipe which I made.  I added the spices given in one review as alternates to the proprietary one listed.  Since that review gave no quantities I added a strong 1/8th tsp of the spices I favored and a scant 1/8 tsp of the ones I'm cautions with.  I substituted nutmeg for mace and went with a scant 1/8th tsp on it.  I added a half pound of bacon cut in 1/4 in. slivers and cooked separately.  I saute'd the onions, celery, and mushrooms in the drippings.  I added cooked shrimp and raw scallops.  Without thinking it through, I doubled the flour in the clam juice when I thought the mix was too thin.  The resulting chowder was pretty thick but acceptable, meaning the boss liked it a lot.  Next time though I'll stick with the specified amount and see how that comes out.

This was easy and very good. I followed the recipe except I did not add mushrooms (forgot to buy them) and used 3.25% milk instead of evaporated milk. My husband and son were impressed, will make it again the same way.

I made this recipe with a few embellishments. I substituted cod with haddock and clams. I also added carrots. Instead of chicken stock, I used vegetable stock. I had never heard of Old Bay but used Cherry007's suggestion and it turned out lovely.

I liked this recipe, it's quick and simple. I used two celery stalksI sliced my cod fillets thick(fresh NE cod), rather than dicing it so it flaked apart on its own, and for the clam juice I used a can of clams with juice then added some mushrooms with bayleaf, dill, and a pinch of powdered ginger root mixed with the OldBay and some ground cloves. I did the same procedure as instructed and served in mugs with dill and scallions. It was well recieved lunch as today was a bit chill.

We just got back to SW Virginia from a trip to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Maine.  I wanted some more of the great chowder we had been eating, and this receipt was perfect!  Very quick and easy. I added shrimp and carrots and used whole milk.  Probably lots of the Old Bay - just added and tasted until it was right.

I made a half-batch and left out the mushrooms, added a little celery seed (in place of Old Bay) and used light cream. The cooking times worked well. Thanks AMYTHE for a very good and easy recipe. UPDATE 11/11/15: I added a small can of crabmeat and some garlic and onion powder. No need to look further for a fish chowder...excellent! Now used heavy whipping cream in place of evap milk. UPDATE: Added mushrooms this time and used heavy cream.

Very good. Used stripe bass instead of cod.  I spilt ALL the clam juice all over my stove rather than in the soup ! Had to go with more broth instead ( store is to far )  Anyway it was still wonderful .

This was wonderful. My teen daughter said it's the best chowder I've ever made. I didn't tell her there was clam juice in it! lol I used all the ingredients except mushrooms, and I added an extra stalk of celery. I made stock with chicken boullion cubes, 5 cubes, 4c water. The only real difference I made was I added two frozen whole haddock fillets before the potatoes and cooked til it came apart, then added the potatoes, and after 10 min, added a fresh fillet as well. Everything else was the same. I will say though, this is a thick chowder; if you like it thinner, try reducing the flour to 1/4c, or you could eliminate it altogether. As a person who does not like clams at all, I was sceptical about using clam juice, but I must say, it gives it amazing flavor, and I'm guessing it's use in the majority of restaurant fish chowders, as it has that full flavor. Don't be afraid to try it, even if you hate clams like I do! Will be saving this one for sure!

Family loved it. Easy to prepare and versatile. I used the spice suggestions of another reviewer (cherry007) since I didn't have Old Bay. I'll be making this again.

This was excellent!!! I skipped the evaporated milk and mushrooms and added 2 cans on cream of mushroom soup ( that's what I had in my cabinet).  I also skipped adding the flour and only added 1 can of minced clams with the juice.  Very good!!!! I made it a few days ago and already have requests to make it again.

Excellent recipe.  I didn't have any parsley or Old Bay on hand so substituted 1 tsp south India fish curry powder.  Didn't have any clam juice and substituted can of chopped octopus including the oil. Substitute use of Taiwanese dried mushrooms and added garlic, 4 oz canned corn including the water. Added 1/4 cup cooking wine. Did not use any flour.  The base recipe provided the guide.   It came out excellent based on comments from six people served and myself.

Can't give it 5 stars as I altered the recipe somewhat.  I cut the recipe in half as there are only two of us.  Used all chicken stock and no clam juice.  Added 1/2 can of creamed corn and 1/2 can of evap. milk plus a handful of shredded cheddar.  I also fried up the bacon and sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat and put the crumbled bacon on top.  Very good will make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use haddock instead of cod and 1 teaspoon of Old Bay for more flavor.  My family loves this recipe, including my 4 year old and it reminds us all of the East Coast creamy chowdahs!

Most excellent basic recipe but need tweaks on the spices. I had no idea what Old Bay is but someone made a suggestion if what's in it and I used that. (Celery seed, mustard seed, paprika, ground fresh pepper,cardamon, mace, bay leaf) worked for me! Hearty and full of good taste. Any kind of fish or seafood would be great too.

I made this without clam juice or old bay seasoning, and we loved it! I did add garlic cloves, about 2, as well as dill and a quick shake of Tabasco  to add flavour. I included carrots and corn because I like a very hearty soup and used our local whitefish. A good basic recipe that adapts to your preferences well!

Made this recipe with my husband as he loves anything seafood. On a cold winters night this chowder hit the spot for our family.  Following this recipe was very easy but we made a few additions. Little neck and regular clams shelled and raw Shrimp.  I think this will become a regular dinner dish for winter in our home!

I love versatile recipes!   This will not be a helpful review of the recipe as listed, but an encouragement to those like me who did not have all the correct ingredients- it still turned out fabulous!  I used tilapia instead of cod (defrosted the wrong fish!), one can of evaporated milk (all I had), replaced the other can with regular milk (2%).  I was out of flour, so I thickened it with 1T cornstarch in 2T cold water.  I had no clam juice- I am sure this would have added a lot of flavor.  No mushrooms- added 8oz frozen corn.  I found it a bit bland, so I increased the Old Bay to 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon salt (I used low sodium chicken broth, so that may have been the reason).  Yum!

I took many of the reviewers feedback and added 8 strips of bacon and cooked the celery and the onions in the drippings.  Also added a teaspoon of Thyme and frozen corn.  Omitted the mushrooms.   Many people comment on reducing the recipe to 1 can of evaporated milk.  We thought it was great as is - not to thin and not too thick.  My husband was shocked that he liked it so much.  He had never had fish chowder and expected it to be “fishy” - which it is not!

Epic!  I went a little heavier with the Old Bay, included carrots, excluded mushrooms and used whole clams over fish.  Knocked the family's socks off!  I highly recommend.

Just made this tonight for supper! Loved how fast this dish was to make too! My husband and I are big penny pinchers so I worked with what we had in the kitchen. We didn't have clam juice, or evap. milk or Old Bay. So I used 5 cups of chicken stock, 2 % milk, and various spices.

We will have this again and again I can tell you that. Next time I will add more quantity of veggies and add shrimp! Made this with garlic-parmesan mini biscuits. Perfect pair :)
p.s. my husband is always on dish duty after I cook dinner, and he loved the fact this was a "one-pot-wonder" :P

I used some white wine and because I had no Old Bay I seasoned with thyme, oregano, cayenne and paprika. Also had some fresh parsley, so threw that in. With so many changes, I am not sure how to rate the actual recipe! But obviously, it is similar and mine turned out delicious!

This recipe is excellent!  Everyone loved it!  I followed the basic recipe but made the following additions: I added more mushrooms to my liking, added chopped red sweet pepper, diced carrots, and 1/2 can drained corn.  I increased the Old Bay to 3/4 teaspoon.  I also added a small can of chopped crab meat with juice.  I used Mahi instead of cod because that is what I had.  I prefer my chowder a little thicker, so after adding the crab juice and flour, I made a rue with flour and the broth to thicken it up more than the recipe called for.   I served the chowder with the most popular Corn Fritters on this site.

Great flavor.  Be careful not to overcook the fish--I did, by about 8 minutes, and mine turned out rubbery.  The flavor was delicious and and it was easy to make.

My husband loved this chowder. I didn't use the 2 cans of evaporated milk. I used half and half instead. About 1 1/2cup. And instead of butter I used bacon fat that I cooked the mushrooms ,onions and celery. Then I used the bacon for the top of the soup. Great Chowder. I also used scollops in it because my kids love them. I think they go great with the fish.

I thought this made an excellent chowder and my husband and two daughters agreed. I made a few changes based on other reviewers' comments. We like a lot of flavor, so I added 1 tsp parsley, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1.5 tsp of the bay seasoning. I think I will try 1tbs of the bay seasoning next time. I also increased the celery to 3 stalks, used a whole small onion (chopped), and put in half a container of baby bella mushrooms (sliced). I used fat free evaporated milk and 2 tbs of olive oil instead of the butter to help cut some calories. Everyone still thought it was rich enough, but it definitely did not have the richness of chowder from a restaurant because of the removed fat, I'm sure. Next time I will probably add even more celery and mushrooms. The amount of potatoes was perfect. The cod worked wonderfully in this recipe. We did sprinkle store bought bacon bits over the top when it was completed and it was a nice touch. I might try a dab of hot sauce added next time right before serving as someone else suggested.

I think I messed this up and cooked the potatoes too long, which made the soup more bland. It didn't have enough flavor for my husband and I, but again.....my fault.

This is simple and delicious ...I used only 1 can of evaporated milk to have it a little thicker and I used 1/2 tsp. of old bay seasoning...great comfort food. Oh I also used sea bass for my fish.

My boyfriend made this for me and this was awesome! We did add a bag of frozen corn, shrimp, and crab meat. Instead of two cans of evaporated milk we only needed one. We also found some cajun seasoning at the grocery store called "Slap Ya Mama" it gives it a nice lil kick to it and it is seasoned perfectly. I would definitely recommend this to other people.

It needed more Old Bay, and as per several other reviewers, only one can of evaporated milk.  I used bacon drippings to saute the veggies.  I used a combination of cod and flounder, and almost 3 cups of chicken stock since it needed more liquid when I put the potatoes in.  It thickened up pretty nicely.  It was even better the next day after the flavors intensified a bit.

MMMMM...yum..did the similar changes by upping the old bay spice to 1 tsp..felt i could go a little more next time even. i used 1/2 and 1/2 milk instead of evaporated milk. I just don't like the taste of evaporated but 1/2 & 1/2 was perfect, i added carrots and shrimp to the recipie otherwise i left it the same. soooo good. thanks for sharing this.

I had some leftover seafood and was looking for a great chowder recipe, and this is it!  I added some fresh crushed garlic to the butter, and I used leftover white fish, scallops, and rock shrimp for the seafood.  Yukon Gold potatoes were perfect as they don't get mushy - I did cook them a little longer.  Perfect!

Dad went back for thirds!  This fish chowder was wonderful!  Update: This is still a household favorite.  You can use any kind of white fish you want with this recipe.  I also occasionally add clams to it.

I made this recipe, but with a few changes (so am rating my changed version).  Used 2 cans reduced fat cream of mushroom soup (no evap milk)as I had no mushrooms on hand.  Added 1/2 of a 15 oz can of creamed corn (the other half I used for corn muffins that I made to serve with this chowder).  I added some montreal steak seasoning to it along with black pepper.  The overall taste is a bit mushroom-y so I might back off one can in the future.  Used Tilapia as the fish and new potatoes and red onions. Didn't need the flour and didn't have clam juice either.  Enjoy!

This was so easy to make and has been loved by everyone! Rich and creamy - everything I was looking for in a fish chowder. I did not have Old Bay, so substituted spices. I also added lots of differnt fish, shrimp and clams to it. Yum!

Tasty, easy recipe.  I added a can of chopped clams and omitted the mushrooms.  You could probably substitute some or all of the fish for clams or other seafood if you wanted to.

I made this with mahi mahi and added a can of chopped clams. I came up short on the clam juice so I made up the volume with fat free half and half, and used just 1 can of milk. Definitely add lots more Old Bay...will make again, was a big hit with friends!

It needs a little more Old Bay and some pepper, so don't hold back on the spices.

YUMMY!  Just got back from Bodega Bay and found this recipe and it brought back good memories. Wonderful hearty stew. Can't wait to make again. I added some fresh thyme, fresh parsley, and celery salt to the stew also. Excellent! We paired it with Cheval Blanc wine from wine country.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. The only problem was that it lacked in flavor, it was a little bland. So next time I will add more Old Bay. We sprinkled it in our bowls as we were eating and it helped alot.

This was pretty good and easy to make. But both my daughter and I felt it was missing something (I even added more Bay seasoning as recomm.) Next time I make this, i'll try a little fresh thyme and use yellow skinned potato instead of regular russets and see what happens. All in all though, a good meal, will make again!

We aren't fish lovers, and all I had was frozen salmon.  This dish was good although a little fishy for my taste.  I'd imagine with a nice cod it would be great.

This wasn't a big hit with my family, except me and one of my daughters LOVED it. Was my first attempt at chowder, and it was a  success! Lucky for me, the boss loved it too the next day. Will try with clams next time. Very rich and thick.

Very good chowder but thought the evaporated milk gave it sort of a funky taste.  Next time may play around with that maybe use half evaborated milk and half regular milk.  Also, could use a little more fish and did increase the Old Bay seasoning.

I'm sorry to say this was no a hit at my house. It was terribly bland. I wouldn't make it again.

This recipe is a keeper! It did not turn out with a very thick consistency, but the flavor was all there. Delicious! It was quite simple to make. My only advice would be to double or triple the Old Bay seasoning.

Outstanding!  I've made this twice since I found this recipe.  By making this chowder I have made chowder lovers out of my friends.  The great thing is that there isn't a lot of fat in it.  I used boulon cubes for my stock and that worked out great.  I only use one pound of white fish, which was plenty.  I love this chowder, it will become a regular at my house.

Boy was this some good eaten!  I used crappie in the recipe and added approximately 1 teaspoon of the Old Bay seasoning.  The increased amount of season made it taste like it came from Lousiana!

I'd substitute clams for the mushrooms and have a real treat!

Great chowder!! Instead of butter, I substituted a few slices of bacon and sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat.  Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

This is the best seafood chowder soup that we ever had!  My family can't get enough!
