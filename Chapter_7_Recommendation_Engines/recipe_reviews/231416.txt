I love the heavy use of apples in this recipe - don't skimp!
If using a Bundt pan, *double* the recipe & bake ~8-10 minutes longer (I went 43 minutes & it turned out perfectly.)  Cut apples small and coat with squeezes of fresh lemon juice, which adds a lovely touch to the flavor.  I agree w/ another reviewer here who said this recipe is too sweet!  Half the brown sugar - I used 3/4 cup for a double recipe & it was still sweeter than I would have wanted for breakfast.  I used sour cream plus a fatty plain Greek yogurt (Fage), adding a bit more vanilla.  Delicious.  Recommend the granny smith apples as the recipe indicates. I forewent the crumble & dusted with powdered sugar instead.

Very good!  Did not have the vanilla yogurt so just doubled the sour cream!  I doubled the recipe and it fit nicely in a 9x13 pan.

This is the best coffee cake recipe I've ever made... since I didn't have sour cream, I just used all yogurt instead of the sour cream, and loved it! I've made it 4 times since the first time I tried it... My husband and family love it!! Thanks for sharing it Nancy!!

Fabulous! I doubled this for Sunday breakfast and my family of 5 devoured the whole thing by 3pm. I used sucanat instead of sugar and gala apples instead of granny smith, tossing them with the juice from 1/2 lemon before adding to the batter. A word of caution: don't over mix the dough as that can lead to a tough texture; mix the dry ingredients well, mix the wet ingredients well, and then gently mix the whole thing just until everything is incorporated. Thanks for this great recipe, the kids are already asking me to make it again!

We have a B&B and bake sweet breads and coffee cakes daily.  This just got added to our regular rotation.  Over the top good. Made the following changes. Used all yogurt, omitting the sour cream. Increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp adding one to the flour mixture. Extracts are so under-used. I PROMISE you, if you add a teaspoon of apple extract to the batter you will be floored by the result.

I'm glad to be one of the first few reviewers of this recipe.  I have an abundance of apples this Fall and was looking for ways to use them.  I made the recipe exactly as it is written and it was very good!  So moist and flavorful...I will make it again and again. We took the suggestion of the submitter and put a dollop of yogurt on the top.

I made this for breakfast this morning and it was really, really good. We have been trying to cut back on our sugar intake, and I should've cut the brown sugar down in this recipe. It was really sweet - so sweet that next time I will HALF the brown sugar in the batter. I will be making this again!

I've made this cake about 10 times now for birthdays, special breakfasts and when I need to use up apples. It is delicious! I use more apples (3-4) and cinnamon because I like a lot of fruit and my husband likes copious amounts of cinnamon. I've tried five or six different varieties of apples and all work well. It takes about an hour to bake with all the extra moisture. My three year old loves to help and it is always a hit. This is a simple recipe that is really great! Thanks for this wonderful crowd pleaser with less butter and sugar than other cakes this good.

This is a jaw-dropper. The look, the smell, the taste is exceptional! It has made it into our recipe books as holiday morning breakfast (every holiday)! The only adjustments I make are minor: whole wheat instead all-purpose flour, plain yogurt in place of both vanilla yogurt and sour cream, and only 1/2 C. brown sugar in the batter instead of 3/4 C. Thank you for an incredible recipe!

I made it yesterday and it came out just delicious!
All reviews are always helpful! My only review would be that I wanted to make this recipe double, but only had plain non fat yogur and buttermilk, so I used both instead of sour cream or vanilla yogur.  I always love to use a little bit of nutmeg in my recipes
 You will never regret this cake...

Doubled it for 9x13 pan.  Used Coconut Oil instead of butter; whole wheat cake flour instead of white; vanilla greek yogurt for the yogurt.  My apples were frozen chunks from the fall with skin on....used 4 cups for the double recipe and could have used more.  I didn't thaw the apples and just cooked it at a lower temperature for longer....close to an hour.  It was awesome and devoured quickly at an Easter brunch!  Thanks!

There aren't enough stars for this! Oh my, my, this was simply amazing! The kids n I made a double batch with a scant 1 cup sour cream n extra vanilla, a scant 1 Tablespoon.  We lightly dusted the apples as we diced them, and I made them pretty small. other than these changes, followed the recipe to a T.  The batter is very goopy but yummy, and cooked up into this dense, moist masterpiece! We used a glass 9x12 pan and it cooked to perfection in 40 minutes. Thank you, mysamba! This will be a family treasure!

Don't understand why so few reviews for this unless its too new.  I followed recipe exactly but had fresh peaches I needed to use so substituted for the diced apples and it was amazing.  So moist and tender and looked fantastic.  Will be adding to my list of easy breakfast/coffee favorites!

The amount of spice and the cake’s texture was faultless, as was the topping amount.  I chopped the peeled apples in 1/2 inch dice and it baked up nicely.  This yummy coffee cake is nice served plain or with a dollop of vanilla yogurt, and is company worthy.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe, the kids and hubby love it and I love it - it's easily one of my top five. I've made it with all kinds of apples, extra apples, cooked or frozen apples, less brown sugar, all sour cream, all yogurt, lite sour cream, in a cake tin, in a loaf tin... No matter how hard I try to mess it up, it always turns out perfect!

I give it three stars because I had to improvise on ingredients. I didn't have butter or yogurt so I used (solid) coconut oil and sour cream respectively. I couldn't wait to see how it tasted. I doubled the recipe and added walnuts too.  All said and done...it was delicious. Can't wait to try it as written!

Super tasty breakfast cake recipe that we all really enjoyed! I used a large fuji apple since that's what I had, and replaced the yogurt with additional sour cream and otherwise followed the recipe as written. Delicious - the texture was great as well. 35 minutes was perfect to get a nice crunchy texture on top and tender cake crumb. Yummy!

This recipe is dynamite. I’m lactose intolerant so I typically just omit the sour cream and use Lactose free Vanilla yogurt for the whole amount and it works out beautiful. When doubling the recipe I find it to be a bit too wet so I typically use just 3 apples and cut them into a medium dice for even cooking. And I add an extra heaping tablespoon of flour and it’s perfect. Definitely a favourite!!!

10-14-2019 ~I am a firm advocate for having all ingredients measured, out, and ready to go before setting out to prepare a recipe.  And I did here as well. That said, after getting this into the oven I painfully noticed my measured out sour cream sitting on the counter.  I thought what the heck, it's already in the oven, might as well see this out and see what happens. When the bars were cool, I held my breath and cut into them. (Yes, these turned out to be bars, not cake) They seemed perfect!  Then I tasted them, and they were… perfect!  Moist, tender, apple-y, and simply delicious.  I warned Hubs of my error before he tried one and I swear he ate the whole pan in two days!  His last comment, after remarking how “D” good they were, was, “Don’t ever NOT make these with no sour cream!”  In other words, if your omission of the sour cream is what’s responsible for these being so good, don’t ever add it!  Still, I’d like to see what these would be like as written, WITH the sour cream… next time. (But I won’t tell Hubs.  I’ll let him think it’s a different recipe altogether!)

Really yummy recipe. I doubled the recipe to make a binder ring. I used envy apples (only ones on hand), and reduced the amount of brown sugar by half. Sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar, turned out amazing. Family is waking up as I type this and walking right to the kitchen.

I made this according to recipe, except for one thing - I used less dry ingredients per amount of butter in the topping, because I don't like dry bits falling off the cake.  This was AMAZING.  I used Macintosh apples - because they are my favorite and I use them for everything. Exceptional - will be making this often for my ladies group!

Delicious!  Followed the recipe, except only used 1/2C brown sugar.  I was afraid that there was not enough batter for the apples, but it turned out just fine.  Nice and moist, not overly sweet. Definitely a keeper - great cake to bring to a brunch!

I love this cake recipe. Although I must say it has more of a regular cake texture than a coffee cake texture. It is sweet, delicious, moist. I did make some substitutions. I used fat free sour cream and low fat butter spread instead of full fat butter. I needed a cake which would make me a little less guilty for eating it lol. I also added 3 tbsp of apple butter to the mix. Just to add a little moisture. I have an electric range oven so I did have to cook mine for about 11 minutes more. I also used a 9 inch round cake pan cuz that is what I had handy. This recipe isa keeper.

Only change I made was using Bob's red Mill gluten free 1 to 1 flour and added 1/4 tsp of zanthum gum.  Will definitely be making it more times.

It was very good!! I was concerned about the thick batter so I added an extra egg and it likely didn't need it. Family loved it, will make again. Not overly sweet, sprinkled the topping with a couple tbsp steel cut oats for extra crunch. Very good recipe

This was amazing!! I added more apples to it and used apple pie seasoning. This was by far my favorite cake I've ever made. It was a little mushy at first but I let it rest in the fridge over night and it was perfect in the morning.

Very good recipe! I only made a few changes: I used gala apples instead of Granny Smith, added a little extra cinnamon, and used Yoplait Greek vanilla yogurt which I think is a little sweeter than most other types. I also had to enlarge the recipe a little bit because the only baking pan I could find was 9x13", so the cake ended up being a little thin. The cake came out perfect, though, and in my opinion tastes even better after being refrigerated for a day or two. The crumble on the top is quite good, and it's the perfect to have with a pot of tea. Thanks for the recipe!

Kids and guests loved this!  I am overseas where sour cream is hard to find, but I used all vanilla yogurt and it turned out great!  I used three apples for a double recipe, and it was a good amount, although I may try 4 next time.

Very good apple coffee cake! I will definitely make this again. I didn't have any yogurt so like other reviewers I doubled the sour cream. It has a delicious flavor. Next time I may add a little drizzle of frosting for an extra sweet touch.

Great recipe!  The only thing I changed up was using extra apples (  I peeled and diced too many and didn't want to waste), extra cinnamon in both the batter and topping.

My house smells amazing and 1/4 of the DOUBLE BATCH  is gone already. Next time, I might do less apples. This was a great use for apples that had been in the crisper too long. Some additions that worked for me: spray the 13X9 Pyrex with bakers flour spray and dusted that liberally with cinnamon sugar. I added 1/4 cup of raw oats to the topping and sprinkled that with cinnamon sugar too. Baked the first 1/2 of baking time on 350 and dropped the temperature to 325 for the last half. It’s Delicious! Would be amazing with Vanilla Ice Cream. Thanks for the recipe!

This was amazing! I did not have the yogurt so I used all sour cream. Also I only used a half a cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 of a cup. It was sweet enough with that amount of sugar. I also added a couple drops of Almond extract along with the vanilla extract.

I made it exactly as written and added pecan pieces on top. It was 'ok'. I didn't think it was the very best I'd ever had and it was very good. I doubt I'd make it again because I'm used to the cinnamon gooey center of a coffee cake and this just did not have it. As far as the recipe? It's easy, tasty and accurate. I ended up adding a sugar glaze, which perked it up some.

Hoo boy and yowza! Thanks for a terrific recipe. I made this as-is and have also made it with pears.  THANK YOU for providing ingredients for a smaller cake. Ingredients can always be doubled for larger families, larger groups.  Just terrific as-is.

This is delicious! I made this using a mix of apples when we went apple picking and only using Granny Smith apples. Both were delicious! I doubled the sour cream since I didn’t have yogurt, still turned out! This cake is perfect!

The first time I made this I doubled the recipe but otherwise followed it perfectly. It was good enough to try again,  this time with better baking apples, adding a touch of nutmeg, and using half whole wheat flour. Gone from good to great!

I made this to bring to sister-in-law's house for dessert tonight.  Only made a couple of changes -  used 1/2 cup brown sugar as  suggested in other reviews, 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 tsp vanilla, added 1/4 cup walnuts, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Baked for 30 minutes and it was perfect - moist and delicious!

I doubled this recipe and I love it, it's great to please pretty much anyone, even the picky ones! I did follow what other reviewers said and added a touch of nutmeg to the cake batter and the topping. Also tried it with and without yogurt and found only a slight difference, however; I really like moist coffee cake so I added a little extra of both sour cream and yogurt. Awesome! Great recipe thanks for sharing!!

Delicious. Used all greek plain 0% fat free yogurt and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla instead of vanilla yogurt because I didn't have it and I used 2 Pink Lady apples because I had them. Moist cake. Yum!

I have made this many times, it is a forgiving recipe & so moist and delicious. You can double/triple or halve the recipe with no problems. I rate the original recipe 5 stars but still have my own preferences as follows: I never mess about with vanilla yoghurt but just take the full 1/2 c of whatever I have on hand - plain yoghurt, sour cream, etc. I generally increase the cinnamon to 1 tsp in streusel & 1 tsp in cake. I have made this using standard gluten-free flour and it was great too - baked about 5 min longer. Whatever format, cook it until a tester comes out clean and it will be perfect.

For a 9x13 pan: 1.5 x the recipe for 40 minutes (also 1.5 x streusel).

For a Bundt pan: double recipe, in my pan it needed to cook for about an hour. Put the streusel on top & halfway down the cake.

I doubled the sour cream because I had no yogurt and added about 2.5 cups apples because that's how many I cut up!  I cut them very thinly, peeled.  The cake was VERY moist, had to cook it an extra 10 minutes probably due to the extra apples.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving!

Delicious, moist but very fluffy. I didn't have Granny Smiths on hand so went with a Mac and another type. I cut back on the sugar by a 1/3 with no problem (still sweet due to the topping).  I also replaced half of the butter with canola oil. Checked mine at about 30 min and glad I did because it was ready. Will surely make again, and thanks!

Terrific.  Doubled recipe to cook in bundt pan.  Took 55 minutes.  Put half of topping at bottom of pan (to end up on top of cake) and half in middle of batter.  I think less flour or no flour would have been better in topping -- more crunch.  A big hit!

This is the best coffee cake ever!  It is so moist and great flavor. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and increased baking time to 50-55 mins.  I made it the night before which makes it even better.  This will be one of my go to recipes when I have overnight company.

Great recipe good review comments. I made a few changes that worked well. Made four times the recipe in two Bundt pans. Replaced the yogurt and sour cream with two cups of buttermilk. Replaced one cup of all purpose flour with 1 cup whole wheat flour. Halved the sugar in recipe and halved all the topping. replaced half of the butter with olive oil. Added 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder. Baked 56 minutes in 350F gas oven.
Cake is delicious, still sweet &moist even with half the sugar gone. Was nicely browned and know it won't last long. The reduced amount of topping was fine for the Bundt pans and adhered well.

Great coffee cake. I did not think it had too much sugar personally as some reviewers have said but then I do have a sweet tooth. I did make one change. I didn't use vanilla flavored greek yogurt because the one I bought did not have a nice flavor to my mind. Perhaps because it had artificial sweetener in it which I do not like. I substituted an equal amount of plain 2% greek yogurt. This may be another reason why I didn't find it too sweet because the vanilla flavored yogurt is very sweet. I did add some fresh squeezed lemon juice to the apples before adding them to the recipe. No more than a tablespoon.

Made this today, doubling the recipe to make a Bundt cake. I used my home-made brown sugar and all sour cream, no yogurt, and I added some walnuts to the topping. I also put in a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to get a richer flavor. I cut down the brown sugar a little, because my friends prefer less sweet cakes, and it's just perfect. I sprinkled about half of the topping on and then cut it into the batter with a knife before adding the rest, because I'd doubled that, too (not necessary). I think next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll put half the batter in the pan, then add some of the crumb mixture on top, and then add the remaining batter, finishing with the crumb topping. Because the Bundt cake must be inverted, the crumbs don't stick, so having inside would be great. If I were making it in a 9x13 pan, I'd just put it on top.

I also made home-made salted caramel sauce to drizzle on the top, and oh my goodness, it's fantastic like that!

Best Coffee Cake I've ever had!  It does take more work than most coffee cakes though.  Waiting for the butter to soften, cutting the apples, doing dry ingredients then wet, etc.  Only changes I did was use 1/2 whole wheat flour and half oat flour.  I added pecans.  I also had to use an extra tablespoon of butter to the crumb topping.  I was amazed that there seemed to be a ton of crumb topping (usually i need to double it).  As another reviewer said when i put the apples in it seemed to be more apples than dough but it turned out great.  Had to bake for 40 minutes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great tasting cake, although I followed a couple suggestions by other reviewers.  I doubled the recipe, but reduced the brown sugar to 1.25 cups.  Even with my sweet tooth, it was still pretty sweet, so I think you could go to 1 cup for a double batch, if you don't LOVE sweet things.  I also increased the salt to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter and 1/4 tsp to the crumble - all for the double batch.  The batter seemed quite thick, but with the moisture from the apples baked up nice and light - yummy.

Had doubts while mixing it - the dough to apple ratio looked strange, all apple and hardly any batter. But it came out amazing, moist and delish. I did reduce the sugar since I live at 6000'. Will make this again, maybe with a sour apple like Granny Smith.Just noticed that GS apples are called for, I used Galas, which were ok.

Made it yesterday and came out perfect.  Didn't have vanilla yogurt so used all sour cream and also didn't peel the apples.  Moist and tasty! Hubby said tasted really apple-y. A real keeper.

This is one of the best apple cakes I have ever had. I made it twice last week! The cake is so moist thanks to the yogurt and sour cream, and I love that it isn't overly sweet. The apple flavor really comes through. Most apple cakes I have had are crumbly, but this one really holds together, enough that you can even cut it into bars and eat it as a finger food.

This was fine. Given all the rave reviews, I expected more though. I followed the directions and the only change I made was to add about 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I find this coffee cake pretty bland. The crumb topping is a little sandy, I would decrease the flour in the topping net time. Except I don't think I'll bother to make this again.

It turned out awesome! I've never made a coffee cake before and it's so good! For once I didn't have yogurt in the fridge so I subbed it with the sour cream like the author said you could.

I made it and it got a great review from my husband and my brother-in-law.
The second time I made it I added walnuts to the cake and  to the topping.
It was so simple, and I discovered that apples can be frozen.
Thank you

I’ve made this about every other day since I found the recipe.  My husband and I both love it.  I’ve made it both with all sour cream and with sour cream/yogurt.  I prefer the all sour cream version, but that’s just personal taste.  It’s just as good the second day.

Will be adding this gem into our regular rotation! Made exactly as outlined, with granny smith apples (took 2 medium sized ones, peeled & cut into small cubes)... used full fat Greek yogurt along with 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, a bit more cinnamon than called for, added pumpkin spice and a little cardamom, also doubled crumb topping because we love that part. LOVE everything about the simplicity and the deliciousness of this cake. Made our entire house smell heavenly, too. Thank you so much for sharing, Nancy! :)

I made the cake to bring to the school where I teach. But my daughter took a whiff of it coming out of the oven and had to taste it. She loved it and promptly took it back to school with her. I made another one a half hour later and got rave reviews from teachers and staff.

Amazing!!!! First time that I made this. Addicting. The people I made it for loved it. The main change I made was to use only Greek yogurt and no sour cream. Served it with either milk or vanilla ice cream.

Will definitely make it again!!!! Yummy in the tummy. 

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent!  The initial butter/brown sugar mixture never got light and fluffy though.  I used 1/2 cup (sort of medium packed) to start, added about another 1/8 cup, but it stayed thick and dark.  Eventually I gave up and just proceeded with the recipe.  The batter was quite thick, more of a spread than a "pour" into the pan.  However the resulting cake had a great texture and was delicious!

I made this recipe using Fuji apples and it was very good.  Next  time I'll use Granny Smith per the recipe because I prefer a more tart apple taste.  I'll also make extra sugar topping.  I used Chobani 0% milk fat Vanilla Greek Yogurt and full fat Daisy sour cream.

This turned out excellent!  Didn't change a thing and it turned out so nice and moist and flavorful.  It was delicious still warm from the oven.   I already made it a second time and I know that this will be my "go to" recipe for cinnamon apple coffee cake.

Really tasty, especially served with a scoop of ice cream on top!  Made the house smell like 'sugar, spice and everything nice' while it was baking.  It was hardly out of the oven before we dug into it!!!

So good!  To save a couple of calories I used 1/2 cup of low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and regular yogurt.  It’s perfect.  I could eat this every day!!! I’ve made it twice and used two different kinds of apples so no need to get Granny Smith’s specifically.  Thank you for this recipe.

Made it as recipe listed. Loved it, The family too! Very moist. I made two at the same time, and froze one for later. Defrosted today, and just as delicious. Will definitely make again during apple picking season.

This is SO GOOD !!
One of the best coffee cakes EVER. 
I doubled it,  baked it in a 9x13 pan, and tweaked it a bit (added nutmeg and allspice, extra cinnamon,  extra apples, extra butter in the topping and added chopped nuts to the topping.)
I also used butter to grease the pan before I floured it, rather than a spray.
I used 5 Granny Smith apples - diced up three of them into very small pieces and grated two of the apples. 
Not too sweet, despite what some of the reviewers said. 
Really excellent.
I served it as a dessert - warm with vanilla ice cream.
My guests devoured it. 
I MIGHT add raisins to the batter next time. 
That would be the only change I'd make.

I doubled the recipe,  and added extra cinnamon and nutmeg to both the cake and the topping mix.  I also added chopped pecans to the topping. The rest of the recipe was followed as written.  I used a bundt pan and packed half the topping onto the bottom of the pan,  poured in half the cake batter,  then added the rest of the topping and the rest of the batter.  I baked it at 350 for 55 minutes,  but had to add an extra 15 minutes of baking time.  It was delicious and I will be making this again.

I made this recipe and it was a huge hit. I used a mini bundt pan so that  I could make individual cake for everyone, which turned out  to be perfect portions.  I will definitely make this again. FYI I used Matsu apple which are sweet and tart, not to mention my favorite apple because of the balance between the sweetness and tartness.

I doubled the recipe.  It was good and I baked for 35 minutes.  It was ok but not spectacular.  Perhaps I used too many apples (4) cups and not enough crumble on top.  I also should of added more brown sugar.  I only used 3/4 cup for a double batch.   I may try again.

This was a super easy recipe. I didn’t have brown sugar, so I substituted with granulated sugar and 1 T molasses. It turned out great, everyone loved it, but I think it would have been better with brown sugar.

So delicious! I cut back the sugar and added cloves, nutmeg, and ginger and it turned out great. I also used extra butter to keep the crumble from being too dry. This will definitely be one I make over and over.

I didn't read the instructions right and looking for a " in a separate bowl" I missed the "in a bowl". I mixed the streusel into the batter. Realising my mistake too late , I put the batter in the pan, topped with apple slices, and cinnamon sugar. It still came out great! It's extremely moist but not soggy. I topped it with a tiny dollop of cool whip!

I made this today and it turned out excellent.  The only change I made was to reduce the brown sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup, only because I don't like really sweet apple cakes, I like to taste the tartness of the granny smith apples.  This was very moist and tasty and had plenty of apples.  I diced the apples in about 1/2" dice.  Served the cake warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Scrumptious!
I will definitely make it again.  Thank you Nancy Gibson.

Only had sour cream so added some more vanilla.
Had one large Granny and medium red Delicious.
Squeezed fresh lemon over chopped apples to keep fro browning and it balanced the somewhat too sweet Delicious.
Cake was wonderfully light and apples tart-sweet and juicy.
Wonderful cake

Highly recommend.   This will be my "Go-to"  snack cake from now on.  After reading the reviews, I followed suit and adjusted the recipe by decreasing the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup.  This cake is so moist that it keeps well for several days without drying out. Ice cream is the perfect topping.

Easy to make once apples prepped.
"Crumble" didnt work 

I used light brown sugar instead
Lite sr cream & vanilla Greek yogurt
Added extra cinnamon,  chopped pecans, & a bit of unsweetened applesauce for extra moisture.
Tasted great.

I, too, doubled it so it would make a Bundt pan size cake. I did not double the brown sugar, however. It's plenty sweet with half the amount. I also added raisins. Next time I would probably not use the raisins as they overpowered the apple taste. Skipped the streusal topping and did a simple icing (1 cup confectioners sugar and 2 Tbsp milk).

Love love love. I have apples coming out of my ears right now. Hubby gave this 10 Stars. The only change I made to the coffee cake was to use 1/4 tsp cinnamon and. 1/2 tsp of apple pie spice. I didn't use the streusel topping but instead made up a whiskey- maple syrup- salted caramel sauce glaze using our homemade Maple syrup. Am making 3 more of these hope they freeze well . Thanks to the lady that shared this amazing recipe with all of us.

I made it using Greek yogurt in place of the vanilla yogurt because I didn't have any.  The next time I make it I will try using all sour cream to keep from buying items I don't usually have on hand.  My husband really liked it and I did too since I try to not eat things that are really sweet.  This was great in that department.  Great with a good cup of coffee.  Next time I will double the recipe and use a 9X13 inch pan.

I made 3 my first attempt. . By accident, I made one with only 1/4 cup of brown sugar in the batter instead of 3/4.  I think it tasted amazing....not knowing what that extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar would have made it tast like.   I gave the correct ones to my post surgical friends. This was fabulous.

Just made it and baked it exactly per recipe.  Got some old fashioned vanilla ice cream waiting in the fridge to go with it.  It's October and Fall weekend here - the house is smells really good!

Love this recipe! The only thing I changed was I used canned apple pie filling as it is what I had on hand.  Next time if using the can I will use less.  My sister and her kids loved it! I know it's good when my sister likes it, she is very picky.  This will definitely be my fall and holiday party go to.

To be honest and more accurate I should say, "I make it" though I use Emeril Lagasse's recipe which does not include the yogurt; otherwise it is close enough and it really is fabulous.  I'll often substitute fresh blueberries when they're in season and all I can say is 'Wow!'  Next time I'll try the yogurt and see how it turns out.  Enjoy!

I don’t bake much but tried this and loved it.   Did not have vanilla yogurt so I put some peach yogurt it and it was wonderful.  My wife asked why I was baking it( she is the best) and I replied I have no idea. The spirit is moving me.   Even she loved it and was pleased.

Delicious! I had fresh pears that needed to be used, so substituted that for apples. I used Greek yogurt only, no sour cream, and substituted 100% whole wheat pastry flour for all-purpose flour. I also added chopped walnuts to the topping. Will make this again!

This came out great. I doubled the recipe but did not increase the amount of sugar. I used  6 medium size (peeled) gala apples. I cored the apples and pushed the slices vertically into a food processor with a 2 mm slicing blade. I folded the apples into the batter mixture and placed this in a bundt pan. I baked this for 75 minutes. (after 50 minutes I kept checking the coffee cake every 10 minutes to see if it was done.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm a novice baker and this was delicious and very easy! Following another user's suggestion I doubled the recipe but kept the sugar to 3/4 cup to reduce sweetness and baked in a 9x13 pan. Instead of doubling the amount of apple I instead used diced rhubarb.. turned out delicious!

Delicious. I added nutmeg with the cinnamon in the cake plus chopped pecans. Also substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Next time I will cut back the sugar a bit just for our taste but a moist yummy cake. Also will double the recipe to have a fuller bundt and add cooking time. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my -- this really does live up to the great reviews! I doubled the recipe, used all plain yogurt and put in extra apples and cinnamon. The batter alone is delicious. Like others, I cut back on the sugar and was glad that I had. Left the skin on the apples. Thank you for a great treat!

Wonderful texture and very moist but I didn't really care for the taste of the cake. I substituted additional sour cream for the yogurt as I didn't have yogurt.  I also used white sugar instead of brown sugar in the cake batter, which I'm sure altered the taste a bit so maybe I'll try it again with the brown sugar.

This is a great recipe,  really exceeded my expectations.  I had only golden delicious apples on hand, so I tossed them in a little lemon juice to tarten them up.  That suggestion of vanilla yogurt on top was awesome.  I only wish I had made a double batch.  :)

I have made this three times now, and each time I doubled the recipe so that I could share with others. Good thing I did because many people wanted seconds (or even thirds)! This is a simple recipe, but absolutely perfect for having guests over. Not too sweet (not like store bought coffee cakes). 

I’ve tried it with Grannysmith (as per the recipe) as well as Ambrosia apples (what I had on hand). Grannysmith was definitely the way to go.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent flavor but the cake was too moist for my liking (my son and husband disagreed). When I make this again, and I definitely will, I will dice the apple a little larger and use less, maybe even sprinkle on the batter and under the topping.

Fabulous!  This was the best coffee cake!  Only had plain yogurt, so used that instead of sour cream, added another tsp of vanilla, subbed 1/4c of brown sugar with white (didn't have enough brown)  and reduced sugar for the topping.  Was soooo good.  I don't like cakes too sweet so will continue with less sugar, but next time will make with all brown.  Thanks for sharing!

My granddaughters said this the best coffee cake I  ever made. They could survive on this. We doubled  it and ate in all in 8 hours! 
We will make again for Christmas. Yummy.
Thank you for this recipe.

This was the quickest cake to make. It was moist and delicious!! The Granny Smiths and brown sugar make a wonderful contrast of sweet and tart. 350* for 35 minutes was perfect. We served it warm by itself and also with vanilla ice cream. It was a hit with our guests. Even cold the next morning with coffee, it was still moist and delicious!!

Absolutely delish!  On a whim, I added cream cheese frosting and I'm happy I did.  If I make it again, I would omit the crumble topping and add the frosting again.  Super moist and my family raved.  Better the next day.

VERY good. I would compare it to an old German recipe that has been in our family for generations. I doubled and baked in a 9x13 pan. No yogurt in the house so I used all sour cream. Can't wait to share. Thank you for this recipe.

Made a double batch.  Everyone loved it.  The fact that it was from scratch made it very desirable.  Home cooked beats boxed anyway,  Moist and fresh.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I doubled the ingredients with the exception of the brown sugar, had to bake it considerably longer 15 minutes, and still seemed under baked and overly moist--very disappointed.

I made it gluten free with almond flour , and used coconut oil instead of butter and replaced regular sugar with  coconut sugar . I also added chopped almonds and some oats . I skipped the crumb topping ( although it sounds amazing ) to make it a low calorie version . It came out delicious !

I'll make this one again - it was excellent.   I didn't have any vanilla yogurt, so I doubled the amount of sour cream and added an extra splash of vanilla extract. 

I might add some pecans to add a bit more crunch - but this recipe stands well on its own.

Disappointed. Baked it for almost an hour. The toothpick came out dry. Set it aside to cool. When I went to check on it, it sank. Cut into it and the filing was gooey. Probably could've baked it for another 10 mins. Not sure what I did wrong.

Loved it!  I made 2 batches simply because 2 Granny Smith apples made almost 4 cups so I wanted to use them up.  First batch made just as recipe called for and I added some chopped pecans to both the mix and the topping.  I love nuts in almost everything!   Easy recipe that made my house smell amazing. Good plain or with a dollop of whip cream.   Definitely a keeper!

As a birthday surprise, my 10 year old made this with my husband. Easy to follow directions. Very moist. Great flavor. May decrease the amt of apples to 1-1/2 cups the next time. While I enjoyed the apples throughout, the coffeecake didn't hold together as well as expected. I still give this wonderful treat 5-star rating!

Extremely moist cake. I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon to both the cake and crumble and my family loved it that way. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the crumble. They have asked to add it to the favorites list to make again.

I have made this three times in one week. I doubled the recipe because it’s so delicious. Sometimes I add golden raisins and every time I added some chopped pecans on top.
Raves from everyone!

Simple and good, love it with coffee for breakfast. I did not have buttermilk, so used Greek yogurt + milk. Also used a bit more than 1 1/2 cups apples--I chopped up two whole apples which yielded almost 2 cups.

While my wife and I didn’t get to taste, the couple we made it for raved about how good it is. Her husband usually doesn’t like sweets but devoured it. Can’t wait to make it for ourselves!

My husband liked it but I didn't.  I thought it was very bland, like it needed something.  Would rather have Jewish Apple Cake, so I won't make this again.

Absolutely delicious!  I used 1 large Honey Crisp which made 2 cups.  I didn't have any yogurt so used all sour cream, dash of nutmeg, ginger &  less light brown sugar (more than 1/2 cup but less than 3/4 cup).  It tasted much better after it cooled.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thank you

Super tasty, and moist!  I made it with half of  gluten free all-purpose flour from Trader Joe’s,  the other half brown rice flour, for my husband needs a gluten free diet.  Unfortunately, I needed something else to help it hold together, because it fell apart too easily.  My fault, not the recipe.  I will have to further modify it for gluten free.

It was my first time making it so I didn't make any changes.  It was absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing except maybe double it because it only made an 8x8 and it was gone instantly.  Also ate it warm so a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top would be heavenly.

Delicious cake! The whole thing came out very moist and dense. Apples were wonderful for this and I truly enjoyed it. I did use Fuji apples because I was out of Granny Smith, but the whole thing still came out very well.

I made this just as written, only I used Crispin apples.  My favorite!  Very moist and delicious even using fat free and light ingredients. I will make this again and again.

I followed directions exactly.  I lucked out and even had the yogurt.  It was easy and delicious...you can't beat apples and cinnamon and perfect  of both.

My husband and I loved this cake. I didn't have yogurt so I used sour cream in its place. Turned out wonderful! I couldn't wait to try it, I had a piece that was still warm with vanilla ice cream. I'll definitely make this again!

I also used less brown sugar, just under 1/2 a cup also for the topping I substituted dry quick  oatmeal for the flour. Makes the house smell great!

Very good!  Followed the directions exactly and it came out wonderful!  (I did have to coat the apple dices in lemon juice because they were browning quicker than I could cut.). Even my picky son asked for seconds. I did not think it was too sweet.

I sprinkled walnuts on top .. But the topping wasn't crumbly I put the butter flour and cinnamon and used a fork to mix it and it still came out pasty .. It also took longer than 40 minutes to cook it took an hour. But all in all it smells delicious. Haven't cut it yet it is still cooling off.

This is a keeper!  So light and DELICIOUS!  I made some changes:  Increased vanilla to 2 tsp, used 1/2 C light sour cream due to no yogurt in house. Used 1 large pear and a honeycrisp apple diced small, peels on.  Added 1/4 C quick oats to batter and strussel topping.  Added 2 caps of lemon juice over chopped fruit as I prepared batter. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to strussel topping.
This smelled heavenly as it baked 40 min.  It pulled my sleepy boyfriend out of bed and we both enjoyed a piece with a hot cup of coffee.  Very light and comforting.  I HIGHLY recommend using pear!

Very good coffee cake for a first cold morning in the fall. I didn’t have brown sugar and yogurt, substitute with white sugar and sour cream. Only I put less sugar 1/2 cup instead 3/4, much healthier for breakfast. As I am writing this review i am enjoying my coffee and apple cake for the first time. I don’t give many reviews, but this time I need to. If you don’t make it you will miss something that’s so easy and quick to make  and it is SCRUMPTIOUS!!!! Thank you Nancy!

Did not like this.  It was nice and light, but the flavor was off. Some nuts could be added.  The topping not crumble.

I made this cake after reading the reviews and it turned out great!!! I didn’t have sour cream so I added more yogurt and used a butter vanilla extract. I let mine cook 10 minutes longer due to the density and it was also in a glass pan so I could observe the color. My granddaughter and daughter loved the taste and asked why I didn’t make a bigger one!! I Love this recipe and will keep using it!!

It is delicious. Maybe make it in an 8” square pan so it is a little thicker. I left the skin on the apples for a bit more flavor.

Very moist and tasty. Made yesterday for my husband to take on a trip today. Smelled so good I had to steal a piece to taste test. Used two Gala apples, cut into small dice (slightly less than 2 cups), all sour cream with a little extra vanilla, and added chopped walnuts to the topping - walnuts and apples just go together. At 35 minutes the center was still a little jiggly, but 5 more minutes it was perfect. I will be making another one while he's gone!

Excellent recipe! Replaced yogurt with additional sour cream and added a tsp of additional cinnamon in with the flour, no other changes. Easily doubled for 2 pans which I recommend because this cake will disappear quickly!

Made just as written & it was really good (lots of apple—yum!), but next time I’ll cut back on the sugar & leave out cinnamon in the batter, that’s just my taste.  Good with my cup of tea in the morning!

YUM!! Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It only had 159 reviews (so far) so I hesitated to try it. So glad I did! I doubled it and it baked up beautifully in a 9x13 pan. I used granny smith apples, diced pretty small. I decided to use half whole wheat flour and also followed some other's suggestion to cut the sugar in half in the cake (not the topping). This will be a definite repeat recipe around here!

I really liked this cake!  Made it without the topping just because I prefer frosting (or cream cheese) so instead just added cinnamon to the batter and it was delicious.  Only negative I can say is it that its really moist, verging on almost too moist.  Totally could have been how I measured the flour though, so next time I will weigh it out.  I also found it too sweet, but thats totally a preference (so next time I will cut the sugar back.) Definitely a good recipe that you could customize easily with other fruits or toppings.

Accidentally used a stick of butter instead of a half-stick & thought it would be ruined, but it was delicious! I only had gala apples on hand but that too worked out fine! I’ll definitely make this again!

I was short on apples so I added 1/3 cup of  golden raisins.  Very good.  Very moist.  I also dusted the top lightly with cinnamon as it cooled.

This is moist and delicious!  I've made this just as direction indicate, and I've used all Fagé full fat yogurt and it was just as amazing!  And I've cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup,  I am glad to hear others cut back further on the sugar with success, iI've made this at least once a week since last August.  I am a frequent baker, I normally don't care for baked goods after they are a day or two old--this I've eaten into the fifth day when just my husband and I were eating it. I have shared this coffee cake with relatives, and friends and they rave about it, too!  So I've shared this recipe with a dozen people, or more.

Followed recipe, doubled, except dusted top with powdered sugar after baking in lieu of crumble topping. I baked exactly 40 min in large baking dish. A hit at the office pot luck!

I made this in an 8" pan.  Should have doubled it to make the 9x13"!  Used two Granny Smith and one Gala apple and doubled the sour cream because I didn't have vanilla yogurt.  Added a little extra vanilla extract.  The only thing I would do is increase the ingredients by half to make the topping....seemed like I was a little short on the crumb topping, which I think polishes off a coffee cake.  I think doubling the topping ingredients would be too much.  Other than that, my family polished it off in no time!

This was very good! For the strudel top I used unblanched almond meal. Just because I thought the nutty texture would be nice. Also used only sour cream. Loved the amazing smell while it baked. I took it to a potluck. Was scared I wasn’t gonna get a piece! ??

Very good!  Peeled apples and used 1 Fuji and 1 Granny Smith because that's what I had.  Added 1/4 c. chopped walnuts and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the batter; and 1/4 c. rolled oats to the topping.  Mixed everything by hand with a wooden spoon.   I mean, why drag out the electric mixer if you really don't need to for such a small amount of ingredients. Came out great!

I had no sour cream and used plain yogurt, it came out deliciously warm and redolent of that cinnamon-apple fragrance that reminds everyone of home.  I chose to chop the apples into very small pieces. I didn't grate the apples because I wanted to be able to bite into apple pieces instead of just having the apple flavor. For our tastes, this method still imparted a wonderful apple flavor. The cake was moist and the topping was just enough to provide a little crunch and burst of cinnamon/brown sugar, without overpowering the apple in the cake. The  big guy and buddy enjoyed it immensely and I'll be baking more for sure.

If I can figure out how to attach the photo to this review you will see evidence of my shameful inability to not eat this apple cake. Made exactly as the recipe indicated except my oven runs a teensy bit hot so I preheat to 340F and it was perfect after 35 minutes. My advice would be to make sure that you really get the wet ingredients smooth and creamy before adding the dry. Also, be sure to sift your dry ingredients so they're very nice and fluffy. Finally, don't be shy about really working that butter into the flour and brown sugar mixture to get the perfect crumble. This was perfect. I cannot stop eating it, the family may or may not ever discover the joy of this cake and I'm not even sorry.

This recipe is easy to put together and very good.  It's definitely worth baking.  After making it per the recipe at first, I felt it was a little too sweet.  Now when I make it, I reduce the brown sugar by at least 1/4 cup for the cake batter.  I also add an extra 1 T of butter to the topping along with 3/4 cups of chopped walnuts.  Once when I was out of sour cream, I used more plain yogurt to replace it, and it was great.   I've made this same recipe replacing the apples with Asian pears, and it's equally good -- maybe better :).

This was good, I'd  make it again. Only complaint is that its hard to turn a crumb topped cake out onto a cooling rack without making a mess, so next time I might make muffins out of it instead. Taste wise it was good though, better the next day or two once its moistened a little bit. I used all sour cream as I didn't have any yogurt in and you couldn't have told a difference. I also added a pinch of nutmeg to both the cake mix and crumb topping.

Really tasty cake and super quick and easy to whip up. I didn't have sour cream so I just used a half cup of vanilla yogurt in stead of a quarter each. Other than that I made as per the recipe, had to bake an additional 5 minutes to get it done inside but all in all a great recipe. My husband and I ate the cake in 2 days ourselves

Simple. Delicious. This is an easy reliable recipe when you’re looking for something different from your usual fall apple pie and crisp. Perfect as a breakfast cake with coffee, afternoon snack,  or dessert even with company. I’m tempted to give it another go and add some walnuts and mini white chocolate morsels to the topping. Very yummy!

I made a few changes, I reduced the butter as other reviews indicated and increased the amount of vanilla and cinammon (just a personal preference). However, I also made a mistake and instead of number of cups I did number of cut apples, so I ended up adding about 1.5  to twice the number of apples in the recipe, but still came out great.

I definitely will make this yummy and moist apple cake again.  I doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 Pyrex  pan, I made a few changes by using 5 cups of  chopped apples, and 1cup of raisins, tossing them in the juice of half a lemon. I also added a little bit of allspice to the mixture, as well as to the topping. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour instead of 2 cups of white flour.  Amazing!!!!

This is the second time I have made this recipe and it turned out great. I made it EXACTLY as listed in the recipe and I added some walnuts to the crumble topping. It was great served with whipped butter and a tall glass of milk.

This was easy to make and I liked the amount of apples. My problem with the recipe, was it was just a bit too sweet for my taste. The other problem, was the crumbly topping did not keep its texture. It kind of just sort of melted into the cake. I believe the thin, crunchy, sugary layer on top may have added to the sweetness. A different crumble topping may have fixed this issue.

After reading the reviews, I cut the amount of sugar in half, doubled the recipe and baked this in a bundt pan. It was delicious, and I will definitely make this again.

Really moist!  I didn't have granny smith apples so I used my Fuji apple.  I didn't have vanilla yogurt so used my greek coconut yogurt.  Came out just as good!

Excellent! I was searching for a healthier dessert that would satisfy my husband's sweet tooth and help him forget about the apple fritters he's not allowed to eat anymore. Ding, ding we have a winner! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used whole wheat flour, and added chopped pecans and raisins. I also grated about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and added it to both the batter and the topping. I diced the apples to about 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces and did use about a Tablespoon of lemon juice to keep the apples from browning. It's not a fritter but he said he can definitely get used to eating better if everything tasted this good. I'll take it!

I didn't have sour cream or vanilla yogurt so I substituted carmel yogurt for both. It was amazingly moist and delicious. This is definitely going into my regular breakfast portfolio.

Made it just as stated but cooked it in a square pan. I would probably like it better in a Bundy but it was very moist and was a big hit with the family. Would definitely make it again.

Had to make some changes.  We brought some apples from home to use up while we are in the south away from the snow & cold.  I chopped up some prunes and apricots and re-hydrated them for the difference in apples.  VERY moist and delicious.  I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly step by step (except I poured the batter in individual cupcake baking pans than a 9 in. cake pan) and the cakes came out amazing! I even added chocolate chips into one of the cakes and strawberry jam into another one and they both tasted wonderful too. Definitely the best coffee cake I've ever had!

I used 1/2 cup light sour cream and no yogurt and I used 3 large Braeburn apples, which was probably about 3 cups. The cake came out great....very moist and not overly-sweet. I will definitely make this again.

This was easy and delicious.  I split the flour half white flour and half wheat flour, and it turned out great!  I also added chopped up pecans to the topping to give it that extra crutch my husband loves!  I am making this again this weekend for a party!

I doubled the recipe and added an extra cup of diced apples. It was a moist cake...so moist that after having it covered for a day and a half the top was soggy instead of crunchy. If I make it again I would serve it fresh that day.

This coffee cake was moist and delicious. I made with plain yugort and Gala apples ( what was available ). And I corsely grated the apples to ensure even distribution throughout the cake.
I served it  warm, for dessert, with a scoop of ice cream.

Very tasty.  Doubled the recipe and baked in 13"x 9" pan  I used reduced fat sour cream and fat free greek vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup less brown sugar in the cake for double recipe.  Was still plenty sweet.

Perfect as written. I doubled it for a large group and cooked for 40 minutes. Everyone LOVED it..Very moist. I chopped the apples very tiny. I was worried it would be too many Apples for my taste. I was wrong..Everyone including myself thought it was perfect. Don't change a thing..

This was a very good cake.  I would cut down on the sugar next time.  Just keep in mind that this is a lighter cake than some of the apple cakes I have made in the past.  Not quite as dense as some.

I doubled this and it turned out really well. The only thing I would do differently is to cut the topping in half - there was a little too much for my liking. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

My family loves this recipe!  We make it almost every week and double it so we can have a little left over.  I usually use only greek vanilla yogurt and it tastes fabulous.  We also like to put more yogurt on our cake when we eat it!

First time I've tried making coffee cake and wow is this recipe ever a keeper! I loved the flavour and the topping was perfect. The apples were a nice touch. I wasn't sure how to transfer the cake to a wire cake without making a mess so I just left it in the pan to cool. It didn't seem to affect it though!

I also doubled the recipe and baked  it in a 9x13. 
I did not use yogurt, used full cup of sour cream minus 2 tbls... added 2 tbls of liquid French Vanilla  coffee cream... so moist and flavorful !!!
I also added 2/3 C of chopped walnuts to the crumble topping...
I recommend using the granny smiths, chopped small...

It was really good however I did make some changes I added more cinnamon and  I added some nutmeg.  I also forgot the yogurt and sour cream but it was moist and delicious anyway!!!
It's a great way to use up apples.

Moist yet with crunch, thanks to the apples, delicious. thanks to everything else.

I wonder how this would be with a lemon or orange frosting.
I'll let you know the next time I make this.

I didn't end up using the full two apples, more like 1.5, and it turns out I didn't have the 8 inch baking dish so I used a cup cake tin. I revised the time to accommodate the smaller tin size (20 mins @ 350).
End result: very moist, dense deliciousness!

I've made this recipe over and over again. Everyone loves it. Moist and sweet but not too sweet. I made sure to use a greek style yogurt with the sour cream. I also add nutmeg for an extra kick. I use green apple for the tartness.

I doubled the recipe and made a few modifications: I used double sour cream because I had no yogurt, and I added a dash of all spice. I used this for a church trip and people loved them! Baked in 2 8x8 pans for 40 minutes, next time I may try putting apples in food processor, add some nuts and bake little longer to get a firmer texture... But all that being said this will go in the regular rotation!!!! They are so moist and rich! Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice.  It is more apples than cake.  I will definitely make this again!  I did double it the second time to make a double batch.

Totally YUM! Didn't have vanilla yogurt, so I used all plain yogurt (no sour cream) and an additional TBL of vanilla.  Also, I sprinkled cinnamon sugar VERY lightly over the cake before baking.
I'll be making this again this weekend. My husband loved it!

I added about 2 Tablespoons additional butter to the crumb topping. It always is a hit!

made it - apple amount is nice - crumble type is nice.  Unfortunately the amount of sugar this recipe calls for make sit so sweet that no one had more than a slice in our home - while some kids might eat - it would still be sweet - not semisweet with half the sugar - the topping could also be reduced to half and be enough to cover everything - there is so much topping that it just adds to having more of the sugar.  The taste was otherwise great - I used 1/2 inch diced Macintosh applies and they were perfect.

Yum!! I made a double batch and put it into a 9x13 pan. Also used some whole wheat flour. Next time, I will add even more whole wheat flour.

Awesome apple and cinnamon flavor! Moist and delicious. I doubled the recipe because I needed a large cake, and it was perfect. I didn't have yogurt on hand so I used buttermilk to make up the difference, worked perfectly as well. The only addition I made was I drizzled icing lines over the top to dress it up. A keeper!

I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13" pan which worked well. Just personal preference but I think I'd like to try it with a crumbly oatmeal streusel topping instead of the more fine-textured topping in this recipe.  We had it with frozen vanilla yogurt - nice pairing.

Good, moist, and easy.  Used all whole wheat flour and it was fine.  Will be making it again, will likely add a bit of nutmeg.

This was good, but nothing spectacular. Definitely too sweet, even with (unripe) apples from the garden and no topping. Bake a 9x13 (double batch) at 170C for 25 min in summertime.

Yummy! I made it w/out the topping and just sprinkled some powdered sugar and cinnamon on top. It still tasted great!

With two Granny Smith apples sitting around and no idea what to make for dessert, this recipe was perfect!  Nice and sweet, but the apple chunks give a hint of tartness and the cake itself was tender and moist.  Not having sour cream I used all Vanilla yogurt and it turned out delicious.  Very nice recipe, will make again and again~

I didn't have any sour cream (we are all lactose intolerant) so I added double lactose-free vanilla yogurt instead.  Very good!

These taste great!  The flavor is spectacular.  My only concern is how it cooked.  The center did collapse a bit, and the middle was pretty doughy.  Any ideas on how to bake it better in the oven?
