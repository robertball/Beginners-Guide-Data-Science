Wondeful!  Better than I expected.  Expensive store bought truffles just don't seem as good anymore since I have seen how easy they are to make!

These were great!!! Very smooth. I coated some with the almonds, some with toasted coconut and some with powdered sugar.  I did find that you need to coat them as soon as you roll into a ball. Otherwise they dry out and the coating won't stick.  Wonderful!!

I made this to take along to a Christmas party. I tripled the recipe and varied it a bit. Each batch was a different flavor; almond, mint and plain chocolate. It was a hit! These are very rich and very good!!

Mixture was VERY stiff, vigorously is accurate. It was somewhat crumbly after chilling, which made it difficult to shape.  The flavor was ok, but I'd like it to be smoother. If I made them again, I would try shaping them before chilling.  I also did not use premium chocolate, so that may have been part of the problem.

I didn't have milk chocolate at hand. I used the dark bitter one... So it tasted like marzipan with the almond extract... Probably will try making again with milk chocolate and probably substitute the almond extract with hazelnut or orange extracts...

Thought they came out pretty good.  I would use a dash less of the almond extract though.  I would have liked them to be a bit more creamy tasting though.  They were more like a fudge to me. I rolled half in the toasted almonds and half in toasted coconut for a "Almond Joy" truffle.
