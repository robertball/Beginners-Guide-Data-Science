Great flavor!  I added only 8 cups of water and that was more than enough.  Also, the frozen vegetables did get a little mushy while the potatoes and celery were perfect.  I think next time I make this I will spend the time and cut up fresh vegetables.

I love this soup.  You can add any veggies you like, and it keeps well too.  I added 1 can of mexican tomatoes to give it a little kick, and left out the tomato sauce.  I didn't use frozen vegetables.  Instead, I used carrots and fresh green beans.  I also left out the evaporated milk.  
You'll love this recipe!

Serve hot with cold evaporated milk, if desired? I don't get it. Add cold milk to hot soup or serve with it?

This soup was great and easy to prepare!  I modified the recipe based on what I had in my cabinets, and it turned out great with the alterations.  I added a can of kidney beans, used a smaller can of tomato sauce than was called for, and used vegetable soup mix instead of french onion.  I also only used 8 cups of water.  My boyfriend loved the soup and said it was similar to the beef stew his dad used to make, without the beef...perfect b/c I'm a vegetarian.  Thanks for sharing!

pretty easy to make.  i didn't have tomato sauce, so i used 1/3 cup of tomato paste.  i also used golden onion soup mix instead of regular mix and added a few beef bullion cubes.  would be great with chunks of beef for to put the "beef" in this vegetable beef tasting soup.

This is the first recipe from this site that my family absolutely did not care for.  We literally couldn't eat it, it was so bad.  Admittedly, I did puree everything together in a food processor at the end, because my brother had just gotten braces on the day before, but that's just a change in texture, not flavor.  I have no idea what went wrong- I listed the ingredients and neither my mom nor my brother could figure out the culprit, but either way this turned out horrible and I will not be making it again.

I have to note that I'm not someone that needs heavily spiced foods yet this was still bland for me. HOWEVER, I froze this soup in small freezer bags, and as I defrost them I add cayanne pepper, cumin, and fresh cracked pepper and it's better...I won't ever make it again though...sorry!

Cant get much easier than dump it all in a pot and cook soup!  I'd cut back on the tomato sauce a bit and up the seasonings.
