My husband liked this dish, but felt the addition of the pearl onions a little over the top.  It is a little time consuming, what with browning the chicken, removing it, putting it back later, etc.  I would make this dish again without the pearl onions. Does have a nice taste.

This recipe tasted delicious and was enjoyed with rave reviews by all members of my family--even my chicken hater. However, the next time I make it, I will simplify it so it doesn't require so many steps. Maybe I'll saute all of the vegetables together instead of separately. The pearl onions really made the dish special, but I might try using canned onions.

While the outcome was delicious, like the others who rated before me, I thought the recipe was way too time consuming, hence only 3 stars. I'd make it again, but bump up the amount of sliced onion and go without the hassle of separately cooking the pearl onions. (Or just use frozen.)

While this recipe tasted good, I think the time consuming method of cooking everything seperately is not worth the outcome. If I make it again I will cook the all veges together to save time. To mine I added 1/2 teaspoon of dried tarragon and some cubed, cooked potatoes. I think that there are easier chicken casserole recipes out there which taste just as good, although this one is slightly healthier.

Ok, so it seems a bit fussy but the taste outweighs the hassle.  This is fantastic and the fact that its low in fat, etc only makes it better. I have shared this with some friends who have all rated it top notch.  Try it yourself!  My only hint is read directions first and prepare the veggies, etc with chopping and setting aside first.  This saves an enourmous amount of time and hassle.

In addition to all of the things that everyone else has already said, it just tastes bad. Too many pans.  Too many onions.  Too long to cook.  Too many flavors.  Not enough money in the world to make me try this again.
