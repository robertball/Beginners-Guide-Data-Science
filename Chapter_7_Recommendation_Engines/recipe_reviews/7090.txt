I used ripe bananas and slightly less banana than called for.  I notice now that the recipe calls for mashed banana--presumably not ripe.  The dough was runny.  It rose over the top of the pan and oozed down the sides.  I had to scrape it out to control the burning.  In 13 years of using bread machines, this is the first time I have seen this.  The bread tasted good and had a nice crust to it where it touched the pan.  I used 2/3 cup of pecans instead of macadamia nuts.  The pecans gave the bread a slightly characteristically bitter flavor.

This came out great! I added 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut flakes and it was perfect. It was moist with a subtle banana flavor and just sweet enough. Next time I'll reduce the flour to 3 cups due to the bread rising too high.

It was OK, and nice light texture, but definitely won't do again. I was looking forward to using my macadamia nuts given to me by Australian visitors, but think this was a waste of them. Could not taste banana at all, and not suitable for sandwiches etc. Thanks for the suggestion though - willing to try most things!

This bread wasn't what I expected it to be. I was looking for a traditional banana bread. It was more like a regular loaf of  bread. I guess it was the yeast. I should have known that. However, it tasted very good. It was moist and had a nice banana flavor. Just not what I was looking for.

I didn't care that much for it. couldn't taste the bananas at all and I used ripe bananas.looking for a recipe almost similar to the one you would buy in a store. I wouldn't make this one again.

I thought this was really good even though I kinda messed it up a bit.  I used 2 very ripe bananas which, when mashed, measured out to be almost 1 cup.  I cut back a bit on the water due to that.  And I veganized it by subbing grapeseed oil for the butter and flaxseed/water for the egg (I didn't have any eggs so I figured what the heck).  I also used an unprocessed cane sugar rather than white sugar and added 2 or 3 tablespoons of grapeseed flour for some of the bread flour.  And I added a bit of vanilla paste to round our the flavor.  I did have to add about 4 cups or so of flour.  It smelled great when baking, and the finished product tastes great.  Toasted with PB for breakfast...yummy!!  Oh, and I did this by hand rathr than a bread machine...just threw everything into my KA stand mixer.

I'm pretty sure the yeast quantity is wrong. My bread overflowed the breadmaker. I suggest using only 1tsp, and maybe even less than that. Use the instructions that came with your machine as a guide.   I had to rescue the partially baked dough and dump it onto a cookie sheet to finish baking it in a conventional oven. So it came out as a kind of large ugly lump. It tasted pretty good though! It was a little underdone, so I recommend careful probing with a cake tester.    Some other reviewers noted the lack of banana flavor - my bread had an attractive and subtle banana undertone. I liked it but I guess everyone's taste is different.

After reading the reviews I made several changes. If it's not listed, then it stayed the same:

1/2c water
1c overripe banana
3c bread flour
3tbs brown sugar
1tsp yeast

It turned out perfectly for a 2lb loaf in my bread machine. Moist and "banana-y" Only 3* because of all the changes made.

I just made this recipe and had the same problem other people had, it overflowed in my bread machine. I had to dump it into a pan and put it in the oven.

This is a good recipe. It needs some changes to be successful. As is, it will create a mess for you in your bread machine. Cutting the ingredients in half may be a solution, or, as some people have suggested... using the quick bake on your bread maker make be a solution as well as it would give the bread less time to rise. 
I did cut the flour and still had some run off. If I cut it much more, I may have had a consistency issue. 
Please note, you are using yeast, this is not banana bread. This is going to be a great bread for making sandwiches, however! And also very simple to make. Very light on the banana flavor, so don't let that throw you! 
Next time I make this,  I'm going to do a half recipe! It's very good and a great texture!
