I found this recipe because I had nutella and peanut butter and I needed something that used both. This did wonderfully. Loved it! I did't have enough nutella so I threw in 1/2 a bag of chocolate chips. Yummy and decadent.

The flavor was great, though I couldn't taste the Nutella very well over the flavor of the peanut butter. I'm not sure it's worth the expense of the Nutella, since its hard to discern.  I may just make my old tried and true no-bake cookies from now on, which are inexpensive and fool-proof.  Be sure to check that the sugar is completely dissolved.  My first batch came out very grainy and no one would eat them, though I cooked them according to the recipe times.

I used a whole 13oz jar of Nutella, and only 1/2 cup Peanut Butter and it still came out very crumbly and dry. Next time maybe only two cups of oats instead of 3.

I wanted to try this as an alternative to my usual no bakes, and they were pretty good. I did make a few alterations with the second batch. I used hazelnut butter instead of peanut butter, and I used less oats because I found them a little too dry without adding milk. A nice change, but I like my traditional recipe better.

Pretty good. I reduced the peanut butter so as not to overpower the nutella, but it still kinda did, and the bars turned out crumbly. I guess i should have added more nutella to make it stickier. Still tasty and makes good topping on ice cream.

Made as directed but it was so crumbly. Extremely sweet as expected from reading the ingredients, using natural peanut butter may help with that...

Easy to make and good flavor, but extremely sweet for me, and thatâ€™s even with using a natural peanut butter without added sugar. I would make it again but cut the sugar way down (just one cup perhaps instead of 2?) and just let the sweetness come from the Nutella.

I omitted the vanilla extract and replaced with a marshmallow. At the end, I added a cup of marshmallows with the oats. In my recipe, I used Hershey's spread.
