4 fluid ounces of a good quality liquid smoke is way too much. 1 teaspoon is plenty enough for 4 pounds of pork. I'm going with the spicy kick next time.

This was my first pulled pork recipe I've ever made, and it was good. I'm not a huge pork fan, but family likes it and wanted something simple on a warm summer day to throw together. 
I used one bottle of Jones root beer, and only 5 dashes of liquid smoke. There is simply no way I could bring myself to use the entire bottle. 
Mine took 7.5 hours. I drained the juices, shredded, and added a mixture of some of my favourite BBQ sauces. 
Served on a bun with a chopped salad or top.

It was good but I did not think the root beer added a whole lot of flavor.

This is my family's very favorite pulled pork recipe.   I really like the fact that it's a "dump" recipe -  just add ingredients, set cooker, and go.

I didn't see the point of adding root beer.  It didn't taste any different than just slow cooking it.  There wasn't any added flavoring to it.  BUT, on the other hand - I was able to shred it, the pork was tender. and I used another recipe to make Shredded Pork Burritos.  Very good.

I loved it. I am going to make it again because my sister does not like meat and she loved it also my other sister liked it and she is very picky with what she gets.

I am making it again right now.  It was delicious, juicy,  and very easy.  I'm going to add onions to the pot this time and maybe a couple of potatoes cut into chunks to cook at the same time.

I do not discard the liquid.  I strain it,  freeze it and substitute it for water in  a pot of Amish ham,  potato and green beans.  Yummy !

I felt like the pork came out a tad dry considering it was swimming in liquid. I'll probably make this again.

The pork was super-tender and tasted slightly smoky. You’d think that adding an entire bottle of liquid smoke (which has a very powerful flavor) would make the meat far too smoky, but it really doesn’t! Can’t taste the root beer at all. I cooked for 8 hours, which was plenty. The meat definitely needs a sauce. We used KC masterpiece original, which was good.

I cooked this in my instant pot, it had very good flavor. I think I'll try it with a different cut of meat next time. The cut I used was too fatty and had a lot gristle. Not the recipes fault.

Plain taste. The liquid smoke is artificial tasting. Would not make again.

I followed the directions as written.  I made this for a family gathering and everyone enjoyed it.  I served barbecue and hot sauce with the pulled pork.

I was a little concerned with the liquid smoke as I have never used it before. It turned out not to be an issue since the meat tasted bland to me. It could have been the cut meat I used, the size or I needed to take off more of the fat. In any case, I reheated what I planned to eat and covered it in BBQ sauce.
