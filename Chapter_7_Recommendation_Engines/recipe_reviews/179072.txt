Yummy..Easy & Elegant!  I added dried thyme, basil & fresh ground pepper & sea salt to the rosemary @ rubbed it onto the room temp chops, then let sit 30 minutes before grilling..the sauce was delicious, but I needed a bit more cornstarch upto a Tbsp. Flip the chops once and don't overcook. Served with brussell sprouts @ baked potato, lemon sauce was good on the sprouts too.

The sauce was amazing. I did add a touch of garlic powder and a squeeze of lemon to the chops and let them sit for an hour. Did everything thing else as recipe was written. Will be adding this to my meal rotation. Oh, & DH raved about them and he is not the biggest lamb fan.

I didn't like this at all.  The lamb chops are probably not as good using the grill recipe.  The lemon sauce was OK but I had to add less lemon and little more mustard.  Just not a fan of this. :(

OMG just yummy!!!  Did not have any zest so left if off but still tasted just great.  I did take quite a while to thicken the sauce but once thickened it too tasted great.

This was very good. I added tyme, parsley and minced garlic to the marinade.  For the sauce, I decreased the lemon juice from 3 tableapoons to only 2. This is my first time cooking with lamb and since mi husband loved it, I will definitely make it again!

The sauce is the star here - so easy and can be paired with lamb chops, pork chops, chicken breasts, a nice pork tenderloin.... so easy and so versatile.  I made it with lamb chops, but I browned them in a skillet instead of broiling or grilling.  The sauce was slow to thicken, so I added it to the pan juices after I had pulled out the chops - yum! It made the sauce even more tasty.  I would have served this with mashed potatoes, but by the time I found this recipe, I had already put a couple of sweet potatoes in the oven.  So I cooked a bag of  baby carrots and served the chops and sauce on top of the carrots.  It was awesome - this sauce would be good with anything!

KEEPER! I had a bit of a problem trying to select the kind of chops I needed for this recipe. I had never cooked lamb so  I found out that there were at least 3 kinds so I just took the tiny lean chops the ones that look like little triangles. While preparing, I was tempted to add some garlic but decided not to. I kept going and as I broiled them I was a bit fearful of under cooking them so I kind of cooked well done with a tid bit of crisp. While broiling I noticed that the sauce does take a while to thicken but I really wanted to try so...TASTE TIME...OMG!!! This recipe is soooo good! The sauce's tanginess just made this whole plate! I prepared a side of Orzo with Parmesan from this site and a bit of the lemon sauce seeped to the orzo...OMG! It tasted even BETTER! Also I made some Parmesan Knots from this site and my meal was TO DIE FOR! Next time, I will just adjust the cooking time to avoid overcooking the chops and maybe try a different less lean cut of lamb shoulder chop for instance to see how it comes out! Honestly, it is worth it!

Just came across bland sauce wise. I should have added garlic as some reviewers have suggested.

Really simple recipe. The chopped, dried rosemary really complemented the meat and the lemon/mustard sauce was as good on the side of rice as it was on the meat itself. I also had a caesar salad and a mint chutney on the side - winning combination!

The mustard is overpowering.  I think I would look for a different recipe next time.
