It isn't even close to Valentine's Day but when I noticed this recipe I recognized it as quite possibly a hidden gem of a yellow cake.  While I didn't use the designated pans, it did "pan out."  (Ha! Couldn't resist!)  I did have my concerns - first, this calls for a little more milk than other, similar, recipes.  Then, when I mixed it up, the batter looked just a teensy bit curdly, not as silky and fluffy as I would have liked.  (or as the batter I used yesterday  in "Aunt Mary's  Delicious Bunny Cake" was) I made half a recipe into 12 cupcakes.  I gazed at them a couple of times during the baking process (about 20 minutes) and they rose up nicely.  The frosting, as I've mentioned many times in my reviews, has that 2 c. powdered sugar to 1/2 c. butter or shortening that I prize.  In this instance, however,  a little milk or water is needed.  The cake is moist  (since butter cakes can be dry I added a tablespoon of vegetable oil to this half recipe - 2 T. if using the full recipe), a pretty yellow, soft, but not so soft it's fragile, not fluffy  but not dense either - just what you'd want for the perfect old-fashioned  yellow layer cake or cupcake. The bottom line is that as this recipe's first reviewer I give it two thumbs up.  I'm sure it would make a darned fine Valentines's Day Cake, but it made some darned good cupcakes too!.

Made this into cupcakes, they were dense and pretty dry. The icing was delicious.

I made this into cupcakes instead and it went really well. The baking time for cupcakes is 15 minutes.

This was an easy recipe, very moist and delicious, not grainy at all. I did add approx 2tsp. of canola oil to the recipe and made sure to cream the mixture very well, otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly (add the almond extract) it adds to the flavor. The mixture was smooth as silk, I filled each cupcake paper 3/4 full and baked approximately 15 minutes.

I have always used this recipe for a great yellow cake. It is not to dense and just right when you follow it in steps. When using a mixer do not mix it for to long, this will cause the batter to go "limp". Only mix to blend ingredients and move on! Love this cake! ??

This was really easy...anyone can do it!
Its a great base cake recipie, you can add colors and flavors however you choose.
I wanted to add a bit extra, so I spread some cherry pie filling over the top of the cake while it was still hot ;-) then I let it cool and frosted it like normal. My family went nuts over it!

This recipe didn't work for me. My cupcakes caved in, but the icing was delicious. I highly recommend the icing.
