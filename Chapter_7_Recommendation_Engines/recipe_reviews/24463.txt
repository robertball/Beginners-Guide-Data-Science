I'm rating my mom's version 5 stars. It differs in three ways: you use 1 1/2 oz unsweetened chocolate squares, which is then melted with the margarine and water. Secondly, you combine all the dry ingredients before you put in the chocolate, sour cream, etc. Finally (and most importantly), you add an egg to the cream cheese mixture, which makes it much thinner and easier to marble the squares.

It's impossible to swirl the thick mixture of cream cheese and sugar. Maybe I didn't let it soften enough, but I did beat it for a very long time and it was still too stiff. Also, the recipe calls for sour cream and cream cheese; the two together makes the brownies too tangy. Maria

A family favorite for years!  Yes, these are definitely more cake like than your traditional brownies (that's why they're not called brownies), and no, I don't think they're super chocolaty, but they are still chocolate.  I was surprised by other reviewers that said the sour cream made the dessert "tangy".  I've never thought that these were tangy.  Similar to another reviewer, I always add an egg to the cream cheese mixture, and we also melt 1.5 oz of unsweetened baking chocolate squares instead of the cocoa powder.

This recipe, although a lot more time consuming then some other dessert recipes is my absolute favorite. My mother in law has been making them for years. These are not brownies, to call them that is a complete misrepresentation of their greatness.  You really need to let the eggs, butter and cream cheese come to room temp. for the best results in this recipe.  Everyone who has ever eaten one (that I know personally) has loved them! I'd give it more then 5* if I could.

This was GREAT!! You MUST use an electric mixer for this recipe. You need to take the time to beat the creamcheese and sugar until it is smooth. Makes all the difference. It creates mushy,gooey spaces in the brownies. Wonderful!

Who was daring enough to rate this recipe 1*? It surely is quite tangy, but what would you expect in a recipe containing sour cream and cream cheese. These bars are super moist, not that rich, and ready in no time. Make sure though that your cream cheese is at room temperature; you might want to microwave it for about 20-30 sec.

Brownies are my curse, I can never get them right. This recipe sounded interesting but didn't quite work either. I wouldnâ€™t discard it though, because I think with some modifications it can be very tasty. Next time I will double the cream cheese mixture and use at least twice the amount of cocoa powder called for, as they were not chocolaty at all. I also added a bit of coffee liqueur and think it gave them a very nice flavour.

I wasn't super impressed with these brownies. I thought they weren't chocolatey enough for our tastes. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but for us, i don't think i'll be making them again.

Super moist and the spots of chocolate with cream cheese are so yummy!  Make sure you get the cream cheese soft enough, I put mine in the microwave for a little bit before I mixed it with the sugar and it mixed with the chocolate so easy! Next time I might add some nuts to it! Good recipe.

I loved it but also had to thin down the cream cheese mixture... I used sour cream but an egg would work too. And yes, use a mixer to stir it all together...

I have to say that I was very disappointed.  These are not brownies...it is a cake.  The flavor was good, but if I wanted a cake I would have made a cake!!
