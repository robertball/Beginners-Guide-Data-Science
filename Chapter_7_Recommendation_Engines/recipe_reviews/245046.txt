Made this several times for various family members making variations such as sometimes used avocado instead of pickles.  Gherkins sweet pickles instead of dill pickles.    Spinach or other salad green. I make my tuna using green apple diced & celery diced with a little mayonnaise...that's all!!
Or even added cherry tomatoes on top for color
