I hate to do this and it is the first time I've done this but as written this is inedible. The batter is so loose that the Snicker exploded within 2 seconds of hitting the oil. I made this 3 times in attempt to get it right. First time= inedible. The second time I did my best at thickening up the batter and it was better but still not okay. The third time was a charm or my best attempt you could say but I will never attempt this again. What I did: Freeze your Snickers as in frozen solid. 1 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of the sugar, NO egg, vanilla, and  1/2 cup of the club soda. This eventually worked ok but I was totally over it after wasting so many ingredients trying to make it work. It might be an editing error but as written this does NOT work. At all.

I'm giving this 1 star because they left out a crucial part of the recipe...you need to FREEZE THE SNICKERS BAR otherwise you end up with a mess. And just make a simple batter the club soda and flour and sugar. You can add the vanilla if  you want but lose the egg.
