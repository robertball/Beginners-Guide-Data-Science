These were simply amazing. I've tried a couple other thumbprint recipes before and there was always something wrong with them. This one is simple (no nuts or frills) and it tasted oh so good! I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have 3 hours to refrigerate the dough. I did put it in the fridge for about an hour though and the consistency while rolling into balls was fine. I used the back of a 1/4 tsp to make the indentations and I put the jelly into a bag and piped it on. I used strawberry jam and the little chunks made it a little messy at times, but most of them came out looking great. And the ones that didn't... well they sure didn't go to waste! I melted about a cup of white chocolate and maybe used half of that for the cookies. They are sweet enough and don't need the white chocolate, but it does make them look nice.

These are very good.  I put the jam in a small ziploc bag and "piped" it into holes I made with the back of a wooden spoon, that worked out very well.  They are really festive looking if you do the white chocolate and red sugar.  I'll definitely make them again!

I was very pleased with how easy these cookies are to make!  I chopped pistachios and sprinkled them on top while the white chocolate drizzle was still wet. Yum!  Next time I will chop the nuts finer and add them to the dough before baking instead of sprinkling the on top.

Made a double batch and I am so happy I did. These are so so tasty. They have a crispness yet fluffy, sweet with a bit of salt. YUMMO.  I used seedless knotts berry farm raspberry jam.

Lovely light cookies!  Made with lemonade for a gathering on my porch.  Decided to skip the white chocolate and used a powered sugar dusting.   May also try a dark chocolate drizzle next time.  Great recipe and directions - spot on!  A family favorite already!

Loved this recipe !! It was easy and the cookies came out perfect ! Instead of the sprinkles I used green melting chips to make them look festive ... Posted pics don't know why the green ones posted so many times... Will be making these every year .

My family liked these quite a bit but I think next time I will skip the white chocolate and sugar garnish as they're really great just by themselves.

These turned out fantastic! I made just as written. I Duffy what another reviewer suggested and piped the jelly in with a baggie and made the thumbprint with a wooden spoon.

I think it would be better with strawberry Jam. Other then that the cookies were easy to make and tasted great.

My husband claims these are the best cookies I have ever made.  I added some finely ground almonds to the dough which added a nice flavor.  Be sure to make the cookies the size indicated in the recipe. I made them larger and they spread while cooking.

These were easy to make. You do have to keep the dough cold to work with it. Maybe needed a little more vanilla. But it is a very good, nice looking little cookie. I will be making these for the holidays.

These are really good! I used preserve instead of jam and I think they came out well. I didn't do the drizzle either but people loved them! Thank you for a great recipe!

Love these. Super easy to follow and make. I'll be making them for Christmas. I didn't have the colored sugar sprinkles but I think it's perfect with the white chocolate drizzle.  Huge hit with hubby and kids. Made some with seedless black raspberry,  strawberry and apple butter. Thank you for the recipe. My cookies aren't as pretty but they are very tasty.  I'll definitely be practicing!
