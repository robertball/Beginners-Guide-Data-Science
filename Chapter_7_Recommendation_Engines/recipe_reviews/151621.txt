Pretty Good! I used chicken stock instead of water to add some extra flavor.

It was pretty good. I liked it but it needs more flavor. I will have to play with it a bit when I make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

My family has been using a version of this recipe for years and we love it.  It's delicious using stuffed pork chops or even chicken breasts.

While the pork turned out great, I also thought the sauce was really lacking flavor. Even though I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, I kept the 2 cans of soup because other people had mentioned the lack of flavor. I was hoping that would help...it did not. This would be a great dish, but you really have to doctor up the sauce.

I am giving this recipe two stars instead of one solely because my husband liked/ate it. It had a terrible texture and no discernable flavor. I would not ever make this again. Sorry!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed to recipe and all we tasted was onion. If I make this again, I'm gonna have to adjust something.

The meat was very tender and good, but I thought the sauce was only okay.  Very easy to put together.

I'm giving the original recipe 3 stars b/c while it was decent and easy to make, it really needed some more flavor.  

Before putting the chops into the slow cooker, I season them with salt, black pepper and dried rosemary(after rinsing them and patting them dry).  I use white wine instead of water.  If I don't have any white wine on hand I use chicken stock or lemon juice.  I like the white wine flavor the best however.  

I've also noticed that the flavor changes slightly when you leave the peels on the apples vs. taking them off.  The onion also makes a difference.  I use a yellow onion b/c I like that flavor the best.

I read the reviews and tried to doctor up this sauce a bit. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce so I looked up a recipe and just added the ingredients: fresh ginger, LOTS dried garlic, a bit of ketchup, a few tsps of soya sauce, lemon juice, a bit of hot sauce- it turned out delicious! Just keep testing as you add them until it tastes good (obviously put the pork in last while you mix the sauce). I also used Macintosh apples, served it on basmati rice- super good.

Easy to make, and kids and hubby all liked it.  Served with rice and poured the 'gravy' over.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will certainly make again.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by this dish. We did feel like it needed a certain kick or punch of extra flavor to it. But it was very yummy as is!

I didn't think it lacked flavor.  My only advice is to trim the fat off the pork, because after cooking for 9h the pieces of apple turned translucent and hard to distinguish from the pieces of fat that fell off the pork chops. Also, omit the water - even without it it was more runny than it should be.
