This recipe is very simple, and I found using fresh basil a nice touch.  To avoid a mushy quinoa, you definitely need to cut the stock down to 2 cups, but it also helps if you prep the quinoa like this: rinse it and and drain it, and then put it in a pan and dry toast until a few grains begin to pop.

I decreased the liquid to 1.5 cups and used beef broth (I had to use it up) and I think that gave it a good flavor.  I also used red, yellow and orange peppers, so it was a pretty red-colored dish with the potatoes and green beans I served it with.  The quinoa gives a great source of complete protein!

The flavour of this was good, but it was mushy and soggy. There must be an error in this recipe. it calls for 3/4 cup of quinoa and 4 CUPS of veggie broth. From what I've read quinoa need a 1:2 ratio (quinoa to liquid) I tried doubling the quinoa. It made a HUGE batch, way more than a family of 4 could eat. I imagine if you reduce the liquid to 1 1/2 cups it might be good. I will try it again.

This is an awsome dish!  I took suggestions from the other reviewers- I reduced the cooking liquid and added some feta cheese. Also, I used canned tomatoes and used the liquid from the can as cooking liquid. A family member suggested it might make a good filling for stuffed peppers.  I'll definately meke this again.

This would get 5 stars from me if the liquid was adjusted to 2 cups so it wasn't so soggy. Still, we ate it all and my teen son even went back for seconds.

I whole heartedly agree with the other reviewers regarding the soupiness. This would have 4 stars had I cut down the broth-quinoa ratio. Definately omit 2 cups of water.

This recipe taste good but it was to watery.  I followed the exact recipe but I expected it to come out like rice where the liquid is absorbed into the quinoa.  I'll try less stock next time.

The peppers are a nice flavor. I have been wanting to try quinoa so this was a good introduction with an easy recipe that could be altered to suit. I followed the recipe and it wasn't mushy, but I have never eaten quinoa before.

Wow!  I love this!!!  I'm glad I read the other reviews and made it with less broth and more quinoa.  I used  2 cups of chicken broth & 1cup quinoa, then took another suggestion and put a little feta on top.  I also doubled the garlic because I'm a nut for it.  I will be making this one regularly.

I made this last night and my husband and I both loved it.  I did alter the recipe a little.  I used one cup of Quinoa and only 14.5 oz. of broth and used canned diced tomatoes because tomatoes are not in season righ now.  We will have the leftoves for lunch.

I used 2 cups vegetable broth (instead of 4) which was perfect.  It refrigerated well and tasted good cold too.  Next time I make this I'll play around with the broth mixture and spices as it was missing something...

This is really good, with modifications.. I decreased broth to 2 cups, used low sodium chicken broth, added canned tomatos, added pineapple slices and a bit of pineapple juice, red chili flakes, a bit of chili paste, two orange peppers and one red and then crumbled a little feta on the top. My health-suspious boyfriend even liked it! And it's even better the next day. Very filling and great for you!

This was so good - I wish I would have tripled the recipe!!  I used 1 fresh tomato and made up the rest with sun-dried tomatoes.  I also cut the liquid back and added feta cheese at the end.  SO delicious!!

this was great when you reduce the liquid. I added saffron in this dish and it was delicious! If you have saffron lying around --add it!

WAy to much liquid. I decreased the recipe to 3 cups and it still had to much. I had to drain it so may have lost some of the flavor, but it was pretty tasty still. I would have given it a 5 star except for the soupy quality.

Great dish using quinoa for newbies like me. Before this recipe I had never used quinoa before. This recipe is easy and tastes great. I don't usually even like peppers, but I do in this dish.

As with other reviewers, I would have given this a higher rating, if the liquid amounts had been adjusted.  Even after setting for a while, it was still too soupy and tasted watered-down.  That being said, however, a healthy dose of paprika and red pepper flakes made this great!

I tweaked the recipe by adding a can of Tomatoes with chilies instead of the tomato paste. I used the tomato liquid adding it to 2 cups of chicken broth. Used yellow and red peppers as I didn't have green peppers. It makes a colorful dish.  Served this in lieu of rice with African Curry (from allrecipes.com) and it mixed quite well with the Coconut Milk base and the chicken of the curry.  Both dishes had tomatoes and onions. Combined the two dishes together for lunch the next day.

So yummy! I will make this regularly. I followed the alterations other reviews made and put 2cups vege broth to 1cup quinoa and used olive oil (slightly less then suggested) and it turned out amazing. I added a tiny bit of cheese and my 2year old daughter ate it up. It made a lot so I was able to freeze half for later. I really enjoyed it as stuffing for home made burritos with some beans and a little cheese and sour cream. YUM!

Delicious!  A great intro to quinoa dish.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe closely and it was too mushy, as others have noted.  However, on second try, decreasing the ratio (I used a 1.5 cups liquid for 3/4 cups quinoa) worked great!    I used chicken broth instead of vegetable simply because that's what I keep on hand, and it is really delicious!  Even my suspicious-of-new-foods husband loved it!

I love quinoa! It's so easy to put your own twist on it.  When I make the "mediterranean" style, I add about a cup of crumbled feta or goat cheese to give it some texture.  It's a great base for roasted veggies, or a dish like ratatouille, can be a side dish or with some chicken or tofu added in turns into a meal.

I liked this recipe. But reduced the broth to 2 cups thank goodness otherwise it would have been a really watery.

I did make a couple of changes....mostly because of what I had in house, but this was GREAT!  I didn't have broth...so I dropped 4 bouillon cubes in 4 cubes of h2o.  I didn't want to open tomato puree, so I skipped it.  I only had one orange and one yellow pepper, so that's what I used.  I had to cook it a bit longer to reduce the liquid, but, boy was it good!!  thanks!!

Yum! This was so tasty. I didn't have many peppers so I added some endame (soy beans) and carrots and it turned out great! I cooked it longer than I needed to and it didn't spoil...it was creamy and nutty and very filling. I'll be making this again

Not a lot of flavor for all that is in it.  I messed around with amount of quinoa vs. liquid and it came out about right thanks to other reviewers.    If not for the flavor of the dish I paired it with, not sure I would love it.

This made for a warm, satisfying weeknight meal. As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the stock to 2 cups. I also opted for red, orange, and yellow peppers (rather than any green, which tend to impart a more Mexican flavor, in my opinion). I subbed ketchup for the tomato paste and added a splash of balsamic vinegar along with it. Definitely add feta cheese (or, even better, crumbled goat cheese) to serve. I can't wait to make this again!

I love quinoa but thought this recipe was too bland.  The only change was to sautee 1 small zuchinni with the other veggies. It was good but needs some zip.

My kids don't like tomatoes so I made this sans tomato ingredients.  Also, I used 2 c broth based on other reviews and actually had to add about another cup of broth to finish the Quinoa - we like ours soft.  My whole family LOVED this!  Even my kids who usually don't want to see anything green in their food ate it peppers and all!  I used basil and oregano for seasoning and added a little kosher salt.  Yummmy!  Thanks

Thanks to all the excellent comments, this turned out great.  I used only 2 cups of water and cooked it 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for while stirring it regularly.  The longer cooking time really allowed the quinoa to open up and reveal its wonderful nutty flavor.  Oh, yeah, I also added some asparagus near the end when I put the tomatoes in for a nice added color and texture.

This was tasty.  I used less water as recommended by other reviewers.  Also, I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and used the juice in place of some of the water.  I only had red pepper but I added some chopped fresh spinach after about 10 or 15 minutes of cooking which helped make it colorful.

Good recipe. I took people's advice and used only 2 cups of water. It worked out well. I also added cherry tomatoes at the end instead of regular tomatoes. I also added a chili pepper for spice.

I read suggestions an altered a little. I sauteed the veggies in olive oil, used 1 cup quinoa and 2 cups water - perfect!! I also threw some cheddar cheese and turkey ham in. My 9-month old daughter LOVED it and kept wanting more.

I thought this was a great recipe. I used all 4 cups of vegetable broth, and I liked the texture of the quinoa. (I like my quinoa mushy, though.) The broth gave it a great flavor, and the peppers, onion, & garlic made it taste great. I put in a LOT of Italian seasoning, so it was very flavorful. My whole family loved it, and so did I :)

This is a very healthy and filling meal! I really enjoyed it. I also used only 1.5 cups of (chicken) broth. When I was re-heating it the next day, I added a little bit of shredded cheese and let it melt. I think it added some flavor to the dish. A little note for those who are not familiar with quinoa - lots of little pieces will get stuck in your teeth! :)

This is a wonderful recipe. I used about 2 cups of water instead of broth, and instead of the tomato paste and fresh tomatoes, substituted a 22-oz. can of chopped stewed tomatoes, not drained. The tomato flavor tied everything together and made it taste surprisingly, but not overly, sweet. My first experience cooking with quinoa will not by my last!

It was alright. Used less water as suggested. Would probably be better with some goat cheese. I added some cooked chicken because I needed to use it.

I wasn't sure about this, but when I cook at work I am always encouraged to go the healthful route.  So, it was suggested and I tried it.  EVERYONE LOVED IT.  Even the people that just knew they wouldn't.....did!  I tried to be fair and stick to the recipe, but the ratio of liquid to quinoa didn't seem right to me.  So, I changed it to 2 cups quinoa and 4 cups broth (I was feeding a crowd!).  It turned out the perfect consistancy.  The only thing I will change next time will be to sweat the vegetables some, and stir them into the quinoa just before serving.  I prefer them to be a little more al dente.  Overall, it is a very good recipe.  Wonderful flavors, and good for you.  What more could you want?
