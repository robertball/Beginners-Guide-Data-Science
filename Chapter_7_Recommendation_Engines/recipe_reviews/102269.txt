I was looking for something different from the usual sweet, glazed ham for Easter and this was perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for cooking times because I used a spiral-cut ham which didn't need to cook as long.  Everyone LOVED it.

I made the Peach-Ginger sauce to go with grilled pork chops. Yum! I had been trying to find something similar to the Grace's Kitchen peach sauce (a line of very good frozen meals) and this is close, using white balsamic vinegar and twice as much ginger (which I love). I also didn't put the pepper in. So my rating is perhaps a bit skewed but I'm so pleased with the result that I'm giving it a 5! I think it would probably be very good as stated too.

the peach ginger sauce is so good.  i am going to use this as a sauce for other dinners as well.
if you have any problems finding hot cherry peppers, check out the 'italian' section of your supermarket.  our supermarkets didn't have any whole peppers, but i found them sliced and marketed as 'hoagie spread' in the italian section.  i had to go to a larger store that had plenty of selection to find it.

Best ham I ever cooked.  I'm sick to death of pineapple-y stuff.  The peaches w/ the tang from red pepper/ginger was just spectacular w/ that ham.  Thank you for making my husband announce that the kids and I had cooked a 5 star Christmas dinner.  I'll be cooking this for many many more years.

Tasty glaze! I didn't change a thing from the recipe. I think the sauce could double for a dessert with some vanilla ice cream!

Everyone like this sauce, I did leave out the hot pepper because I didn't have any and it didn't seem to need it.  Next time I will chop the peaches up.  It's expensive to make so its only for special occcasions.

I used a serrano pepper because I couldn't find a cherry pepper.  The heat of the pepper definitely adds to the flavor. I also couldn't find peach preserves, so I used apricot pineapple preserves. Very good!

I made this for my "Gourmet Group" and everyone loved it.  I, too, made it with grilled pork chops based on a review.  I meant to incorporate clove in the glaze since I wouldn't have the whole cloves on the meat, but I forgot in my rush.  I also omitted the peach nectar based on a review and would not have wanted the sauce any more liquid.  Very yummy!

I followed the recipe mostly. Another recipe recommended slicing the top of the ham about 1/2 inch apart and 1/4 inch deep, that worked out well. I used ground cloves instead of whole cloves. Also, I couldn't find a hot cherry pepper anywhere, so used some bottled pimientos (maybe 2 tbsp) that I chopped up. I also doubled the mustard/cinnamon/brown sugar glaze. Also used fresh peaches, peeled them and cut them into small pieces for the sauce. I had several friends over for dinner and they LOVED it.

I have never had any thing like this.  My family did not like it but I could not stop snacking on the spicy peaches while I was putting dinner away.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  I only made changes out of necessity, but this turned out AMAZING!   I forgot to buy a cherry pepper, so all I had was some jalapeno slices.  I also didn't buy enough frozen peaches, so I only had about 10 ounces of peaches to put in the sauce.  I didn't add anything else in it's place because I thought that looked sufficient anyway.  It all turned out amazing.  The ham by itself in the glaze was phenomenal.  When you add the peach sauce, the flavors blend together SO well!  It had the perfect amount of spiciness with the perfect amount of sweet and a great zing from the ginger.  My husband and brother-in-law are picky men who don't really care much for ham.  They went back for thirds and commented several times how great it was.  I think this will be our new Christmas ham tradition :)

As someone allergic to pineapple I love this recipe, thanks for sharing. Very tasty and the sauce gives a ham meal a whole different twist. Made a few adjustments but because I didn't have what was called for; I used Peperoncini peppers and Dijon mustard. We loved it!!

Big hit! I made this with a smaller 5lb boneless butt pre cooked ham (because that is what I had) but other than that, I made it as written. I shortened the pre-glaze bake time accordingly, to 75 minutes. It was delicious and a beautiful change from the traditional pineapple accompaniment. My husband requested ham for Christmas, but this was beyond his expectations, and now this is the recipe he prefers. Next time I may use a bit more ginger and hot pepper for kick.
