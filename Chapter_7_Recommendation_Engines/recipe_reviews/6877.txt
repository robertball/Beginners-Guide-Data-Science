This was delicious and very soft! I made the dough in my Kitchen Aid Mixer with the dough hook.  Add the warm milk, sugar and yeast and let sit for about 10 minutes.  Then add the rest of the ingredients and mix for about 5 minutes.  I needed to add more flour...not sure how much...but quite a bit until it kneaded in my mixer easily.  Then I covered it and let it rise for 25 minutes, punched it down and put it in a sprayed bread pan.  Covered it again for 10 minutes then took off the cover and turned on the oven.  It rose for about 15 more minutes while the oven heated up.  I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes and it was perfect.

This is wonderful bread! I used the dough cycle and followed the previous reviewers suggestion of shaping it into a 9 bny 5 loaf pan and letting it rise 30 minutes (although next time I'd probably let it rise 45-60 min). Then baking it at 350 for 35 minutes in the oven.  Turned out perfectly!  My husband LOVED it and said I should make it every morning! We had half the loaf left over for a couple of days and I made the BEST garlic toast with it...slice 3/4 inch thick, generously butter both sides, put on baking sheet lined with nonstick aluminun foil, then mix 1/4 cup parmasan cheese with 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning, sprinkle on each slice of buttered bread (on top side only) and then sprinkle the top of the seasoned side with a 3 tbsp. shredded mozzarella cheese.  Bake at 400 for 10 minutes or so until bottom is toasted and top cheese is bubbled and browning.  These were so delicious with spaghetti, much better than the frozen 'Texas Toast' you buy at the store.  This bread is requested especially for the garlic toast I make with it! I bet it would make wonderful French toast as well!

Today was the first time making this bread and it turned out WONDERFUL! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The crust was tender & slightly chewy while the inside was incredibly soft. We gobbled it up with butter and honey right out of the machine. I've now found my perfect white bread recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Ijust finished baking this bread.  The only change I made was that I used bread flour, probably from habit.  The bread has a wonderful texture, is hearty and has a very good flavor.  It is definately a keeper -- thank you.

Exactly what we were looking for - simple and delicious.  Toward the end of the baking cycle, the aroma overwhelmed the house in the most wonderful way! The crust is light, almost flaky!  This is the end of a long search for a simple bread machine-bread without the crunchy crust. Thanks.

I've made this for the first time this morning.  The tast is excellent, my daughter walked in and asked for a slice as she was starving (a thick slice) even she thought it was gorgeous.  Same problem though, I live in Johannesburg, 6000 ft above sea level and even with some adjustments still very dense.  Will mke it again later in the week though as it's worth it for the flavour.  Many thanks for sharing this

Holy smokes, this bread turned out amazingly.  I also mixed it by hand and baked in the oven.  I mixed yeast, sugar, and mild and let stand for about 10 minutes.  It was just getting a bit frothy.  Then, I added the flour salt and butter (which I softened in the microwave).  I covered the bowl with a damp towel and let it rise, punched it down and let it rise again.  I would've liked to have let it rise a bit longer the second time, but I was in a bit of a time crunch to get it done.  It baked for 35 minutes at 350 degrees, the top got nice and golden, and could've stayed in another 5 minutes or so.  It cooled in the pan and when I turned it out, it was gorgeous.  It was light and dense at the same time.  I can't wait to make this again.  I made it last night and have almost just the heel left...

Great bread! Might add a tad more salt next time. Stuck to my bread machine pan. Don't know if I didn't let it cool long enough, or if the dough was too moist. Anyway, so easy and delicious. Definitley making this one again!

I made this the old fashioned way - by hand as my bread machine is on the blink. It was lovely. I left it to rise over night with a damp cloth over the top to stop it drying out and then baked on 175C for 1 hour on the bottom shelf of the oven. I then left it to cool with another damp cloth over the top to soften the crust. It was lovely, so tasty I could have eaten the whole loaf!! Great with home made butter. Yum.

I tried it second time.The only suggestion I have people out there who are looking for good recipes is to read all the options given by wonderful people in their reviews and then follow the recipe as you feel right...Other than that this is perfect recipe just i changed all-purpose flour with bread flour..and I chose bread setting in bread machine to knead it and raised it outside the machine and baked it in the oven. I have tried baking breads in bread machine as well but everytime they came out too dense for us.somehow while searching for answers i came across this site and its reviews options It worked perfect for me...enjoy baking

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe.  It is great if you have a bread maker because all of the ingredients are things you have on hand anyway, except for the yeast.  Doesn't require bread flour.  I made for company last night and they took home the leftovers.  So have another loaf in the bread machine right now.  No changes, great just as is.

Very good Basic Bread recipe. I made in OVEN at 350 for 40 minutes. Needed a bit more flour, but that's probably due to not using a bread machine; besides one always has to judge the flour 'as you go' as it's never exactly the same twice. Listen to your fingers. Thanks for the recipe.

Ok, but not even close to "soft" bread. I have made much better from my bread machine handbook.

The BEST bread recipe I've tried. My family doesn't really like the really thick crust and this is just perfect. Soft inside, flaky crust outside. Kids even like it. I was tempted to add more flour when watching it in the bread machine because the dough seemed really sticky. I'm glad I didn't, it turned out perfect!

This recipe is definitely the best white bread recipe I've found. The bread is very moist and is somewhat sweet. It's great by itself, with butter, or dipped in olive oil and spices. It's somewhat thick, so it makes a great french toast. The first few times I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful! Lately, I've been experimenting with some of my bread recipes and the last time I made this bread, I substituted honey for the sugar. The bread turned out even more moist than before and had a slightly sweeter taste. It also kept a little longer than the other loaves I've made. If you're having problems with the loaf drying out too fast, try reducing the salt by half and substituting honey for the sugar. I haven't tried making a cinnamon bread out of this recipe yet, but I think I will try it tonight so we can have cinnamon french toast for breakfast tomorrow.

This is very good bread. The taste is excellent and it is homemade and has no preservatives like the ones from the store! You dont ever have to buy a loaf of bread again from the supermarket! Easy ingredients that are on hand. I love the fact that it uses all purpose flour rather than bread machine bread flour. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Nice smooth top, however I found the crust to be somewhat soft on top.  Could be due to my machine.  Otherwise, delicious.

I accidentally forgot the butter, and this bread was STILL awesome!  (Lol... next time, I'll make it right though!)  I used this recipe to make a ham and cheese stromboli that was SO tasty... a great basic recipe that you can do a lot with!  Thanks for posting!!

This bread was great. It stayed very moist until the last slice was gone. I could also suggest using just the dough only cycle on your machine,  let it rise again in the pan, then bake it in your oven on 350 degrees for aprox 40-45 min. the crust comes out wonderfully.

This bread didn't turn out too well for me.  It was really dense and doesn't have much great flavor, tasted more like yeast than bread.  Won't be making again.

This was wonderful bread.  I made it for xmas gifts with honey butter to give to my family and neighbors.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't however bake it in the bread machine I mixed it and let it rise once then placed it in bread pans, cooked it in the oven.  I also used water instead of milk and added 2Tlb of dry milk. WONDERFUL BREAD!!!

Oh man this is the bomb!  I used sour milk ..soured from raw milk, didn't have very much butter so I omitted the butter..and I used a TBSP of Sugar and a TBSP of honey.  This is the best white bread I've ever made and I've made a lot!  I also covered it in olive oil while raising and then when baking.

I've tried many bread machine recipes and this is the closest to "store bought" that I've tried.  Absolutely delicious sliced thick in the toaster.  Follow recipe exactly and you can't go wrong!!

This bread makes good toast (grilled cheese, french toast, etc...) but I don't like it for just plain sandwiches.  The crust is too hard and didn't soften when it cooled like the Amish White Bread recipe on this site.  Make sure you bake it long enough - I took mine out after 35 min and it probably should have cooked for at least 5 more min.

I have tried many different recipes for white bread and about six months ago gave up on making my own homemade, since I couldn't find a good recipe! After reading all the reviews on this one, I tried and let me tell you this is the BEST recipe I've ever used. The texture, crumb, taste and all over appearance was perfect and this is by far one of the easiest bread recipes I've used. I made it the old fashioned way by hand, letting the yeast sit in the warm milk/sugar for a few minutes and then adding the rest of the ingredients. Kneaded for about ten minutes, let it rise twice and baked it at 350 for a half hour. I made this last night and between me and my husband and our two baby boys this is GONE already! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this bread the first time for a get together a few months ago, and now I am making it again for a potluck.  I like this recipe because I do not need to change anything, I can use things I have around the house (such as skim milk), and it always comes out perfectly.  Thank you for providing it!

This bread is WONDERFUL!! This is the best recipe for a breadmaker white bread so far! The texture and taste were perfect and the 1st loaf lasted about 20 minutes in my house. I would reccomend this recipe to all. Also, I made it exactly as it said and my bread did not fall. It came out perfect. I would suggest that people try this first as stated before cutting out any of the yeast. I will make again and OFTEN =)

This is my everyday white bread recipe.  I use the dough cycle on my bread machine to mix it and let it rise.  After that I shape it into a loaf and let it rise for another 30 minutes.  Then I bake it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  Be sure to let the bread cool before slicing it...it will keep the bread tender.  The crust may seem hard when it comes out of the oven, but it softens as it cools.  When I have leftover bread, it makes awesome bread pudding!

This recipe was fantastic! I was searching for a good basic white bread recipe and found one that was even better than I hoped for. I have made it twice now (once adding cheddar cheese) and both times my husband and I loved it. Now if I can find a wheat bread recipe just as great! Thanks!

This was wonderful. I used half coconut oil and half grapeseed oil for the butter, just to have something moderately more healthful, and it was still fabulous. I might try substituting olive oil or flaxseed oil for the grapeseed oil next, just for more flavour and variety. I like this a lot better than the other popular white bread recipe on this site. I didn't have a bread machine so I kneaded it by hand for about 6 minutes and left it to rise probably an hour, punched it down and left to rise again for maybe half an hour in the bread pan. I baked it around 350-375 (my oven runs slightly hot) for about 30 minutes. The crust isn't SO crisp that it will be impossibly chewy, and the center is fluffy and has the finest crumb. I baked this loaf with the intention to use it as sandwich bread for the week, and I think it will be great for that. Very soft without a hint of that doughy flavour. I might try to make burger buns out of this recipe next. I also think this bread would become fantastic french toast. Thanks for the recipe!

Update:  I'm reducing this to 4 stars from 5 because the bread wasn't as good the next day.  It got pretty dry and crumbly and w s hard to use for sandwiches.  It still tasted yummy, just got too dry.

Original review:
Delicious, soft white bread.  Much better than the recipe in my bread maker instruction book.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Pleasantly surprised. No bread machine, so was doubting. Ingredients are spot on. Five mins in the kitchenaide, and 5 mins kneading by hand. One hour rise in a warm place while covered with saran. Punched down, then into a bread pan. Another rise for 30 mins. Shallow slice with a sharp knife down the middle from end-to-end (aesthetics only), then into a 350 oven for 35 mins (internal temp registered 190). Twenty mins to cool -that was an hour ago- and the dam thing is all gone! Yum!

This is the perfect recipe!! I have tried many others and this one won the golden ticket for sure. It has a wonderful texture like store bought bread, my family loves it. I mix it in my bread machine, take it out let it rise, punch it down and let it re-rise in the loaf pan. I bake it on 355 for 35 minutes (gas stove) and it is perfect every time! Anyone who gives this recipe less then a five star is doing something wrong. Lisa you are the bomb!!

This is a nice basic recipe.  From this you can change it to add whole wheat flour, oats, flax meal, chia seeds, cut fruit, cinnamon - pretty much anything you want.  Keep in mind the bread gets a lot heavier / more dense when you add things.

Loved it !, I was after a soft white sandwich bread for years, I made mine with Evaporated milk/Water mix as I was out of milk, turned out just fine, Soft dense little spongy air pockets, light crust.

I used my machine for the dough set the dough in a pan in a warm oven with a tray of hot water alongside  for the rise, baked mine @ 325 for 20-25 min in a dark pan, ate 3 slices as soon as it cooled a bit.
A 5 star White Bread !, Thanks

This is a yummy recipe for my husband who likes white bread. It has a nice texture and makes great French toast and grilled cheese sandwiches! I always use bread flour but this time I tried it with 2 cups flour and 1 cup rye flour....turned out great. I microwave the milk for 40 seconds which brings it to lukewarm and use olive oil instead of butter. I like using the dough cycle then baking it in the oven for about 30-35 min.

I tried this recipe several times but it came out too flakey for our family as we like to use our bread for sandwiches often. This bread doesn't cut well and falls apart. THe taste though, isn't bad.

Bread did not taste like white bread, it was ok as is (to me), but boyfriend did not like the texture. It did not rise very well, just like other bread recipes we have tried that require all purpose flour. I think we will stick to bread flour from now on, because it rises twice the size and doesn't have that potent flour taste. I will try again with bread flour, but I hope it turns out better than what I cooked. Maybe next time I will check out other similar recipes  and compare. I think it was the all purpose flour and not the bread flour.

Followed this recipe exactly - came out soft and fluffy inside with a slight crust. My husband took a bite and said "now that's good bread" -    I was thrilled with this and plan on using for market sandwhich's next - excellent warm with butter - yum yum!

This bread tastes really good. It is more dense than I thought it was going to be. I needed to add more flour (about 1/2 cup). Maybe next time I'll use less milk as some of the custom versions suggest. I might also try sifting the flour to make it lighter. It didn't rise as much as the photo suggests. It makes a pretty small sandwich. But it is delicious. I made it the old fashioned way since I don't have a bread machine. I'll definitely try this one again. It's super easy as far as bread goes and I don't have to buy bread flour. :) update: I can never get this to look right without a bread machine. it always goes flat no matter what I do. It does taste good, but I want a fluffier bread that I can use for sandwiches. This is heavy and doesn't get "sandwich" shaped. I'm going to try to find a different recipe.

This came out pretty good! I used the fast setting on my machine by mistake (did not use rapid rise yeast) so the rise was lower (more like 1.5 lbs) and I added an additional dusting of flour on the dough ball to make it less sticky, during kneeding. Then added italian seasoning and garlic powder for an Italian version. The taste is great (medium yeast taste) and the density is medium with a light crust.

I used the dough cycle on the bread machine and then kneaded the dough a few times, rolled it out to a rectangle, rolled it up, placed it in a 9x5 greased pan, let it rise about 45 minutes, then baked for 35 min at 180C in a mini oven. The bread came out evenly light brown. I used half of it the next day for French Toast - and it was excellent! It was easy to slice and tender.

Very yummy. The first time I made white bread, I used another recipe. It was a failure. Then, I found this recipe, and cross my finger and tried it. It turns out perfect. I made it manually, without the bread maker machine. After it has 'proof' to double of its volume, I punch it down and knead for another 2-3 minutes. Then I cover it with the tea towel, I let it rose for another 10 minutes before I bake it in the pre-heated oven for 20 minutes. I definitely will make it again and again.

This was alright. I didn't rise well but it had good flavor. The family ate a whole loaf for sandwiches at lunch but it doesn't slice into sandwich bread well.

I just got a used bread machine with no book, so I needed to find a recipe to use with it. This is the first one I tried and it is great! I've made it 3 times now and it has turned out delicious every time!I used the med. crust for this bread. We thought the crust was crispy and the inside was soft. Perfect. I'm glad I won't need to keep looking.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a recipe that I can actually make!! I have never had luck baking bread but this turned out wonderful. I did add 1 Tbsp of fresh cracked black pepper-- AWESOME!! I have never had luck finding a recipe that works with pepper...this one does. Also makes great grilled sandwich bread.

THIS IS THE ONE I've been looking for. Finally, a tender white bread. I followed Michigan Mommy's suggestion and put it in a 9x5 bread pan - let it rise about 45 minutes. Baked @ 350 for about 30 min. Top was brown and sounded hollow when thumped. It was beautiful. Tasted wonderful. This will be my basic bread from now on. I'll let the bread machine do the work, and use the oven for baking it. Thanks.

I used the "dough" setting and baked in the oven.  I also used bread flour. It did fall slightly but it is light and fluffy and holds up well.  Good for sandwiches and toast.

My husband wouldn't even eat this and he loves fresh baked bread! It was lacking flavor and it was rather hard and dried out very quickly.

I've tried a few but this is the best white bread recipe I have found.  I scaled it up to 470g of flour (extra strong white), basic bake, large size and it produces a really tasty, high rising loaf.  Doesn't last long though - it gets eaten too quickly!  Works well on both normal and fast bake although fast produces a slightly less risen loaf.
Machine is Panasonic SD255.  Knocks spots off of the white recipe in the Panasonic book.

This is the best ever white bread, baked in bread machine. It is light and fluffy, very nice. Remember, to let yeast warm to room temp before using.

Came across this recipe today and LOVE it!!

Baked it last night.  Everything looked good when I checked it halfway, but when the timer went off I discoved that the top of my loaf had totally collapsed.  Used bread flour...maybe that's why.  Good flavor though.  Chewy and yummy.

My husband and I are toying with the idea of making our own sandwich bread instead of buying loafs from the store, which anymore tend to be a complete waste of money.  My husband found this recipe and we love it!  It tastes excellent, especially right out of the bread machine.  The only thing I will do different next time is use less yeast.  It seems to have risen too much and then collapsed while baking, but of course that didn't affect the taste.  Used the light crust setting.  Also had to go out and buy an electric knife, it's just impossible to make nice slices with a regular knife.  Am going to make again tonight!  Thanks so much - hopefully we won't have to go back to buying store bread!

The only change that I made was using honey instead of sugar. Well, that and the fact that I used my 'old-fashioned' oven instead of a bread maker. It turned out well, a bit too 'yeast-y', but that was probably my fault. I had a slice straight from the oven and it was nice.

This is the first time I have ever used a bread machine to make bread and I thought this recipe made a very tasty loaf.  My family of 5 devoured it as soon as it came out of the machine and I had to hurry and wash up and make another one!

I made this last night for the first time, using bread flour and bread machine yeast on the manual/dough cycle.  I patted the dough out into a rectangle and rolled up into a "log" to fit my bread pan, let rise to double, then baked at 350° for 30 minutes.  It turned out perfectly and tasted great. I have another loaf going now! Great recipe!

Great loaf of bread! I've had no luck with bread flour so I was on the net all morning looking for a recipe for my bread machine that called for all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. Thank you. The texture was nice, and I thought the flavor was tasty. For those who had problems with this recipe, make sure your yeast is good and not expired and your liquid is not to hot. My family loves it. It will be on my table again very soon!!!

I get spastic when I can't find this recipe ... it is the best...thanks Lisa.  I have copies stashed everywhere and even one in my breadmachine when not in use.  I'll never need another basic white again.  It's the family favorite.

I made this for the first time last night and I already have another loaf in the bread machine now.  It was fantastic!!!  When my husband walked through the door he wondered what the wonderful smell was!!  It was very tender and delicious.  We couldn't wait for it to cool down.  Very easy to make, especially with a 3 year old and 7 month old in the house!!

We didn't like this bread very much, it didn't have much flavor to it at all, and wasn't as  soft as other breads I've made.  I'll stick with the boxed variety for the bread machines until I come up with a better recipe.

This bread is absolutely delicious.  My husband and I make it all the time, it's our favorite bread recipe.  I like to make it on the dark crust setting on my bread machine.  It's soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

Excellent!!! Was a little surprised to use all purpose flour instead of bread flour, but it worked fine and was wonderful.  Nice texture.  I think the whole loaf was gobbled up before it was completely cool.  The kids loved it!

This bread is just fabulous.  Normally, I'm not the type to eat plain bread and butter, but this bread is good enough all by itself.  It did collapse a little bit, but not being a "seasoned" bread maker, I don't know why.. It was too good, though, to be upset about!

I made the dough in my bread machine then turned it out and hand kneaded it before raising in loaf pan. 
The instructions don't tell me if the butter needs to be room temp soft or melted and cooled.   My dough was a bit wet so when I turned it out I was adding quite a bit of flour when kneading it.  Turned out very good; think I would leave it in oven for an extra 5 minutes or more.

I love this as a basic and very versatile recipe, and use it regularly. I use the dough setting on my bread machine, with the milk and butter in the bottom, flour on top, and salt in one corner with the yeast and sugar in the opposite corner.  A few options I’ve tried successfully: 
1) shape into dinner or hotdog buns, a bread loaf pan, rise and bake. 
2) knead in shredded cheese for cheese buns, bake for 15, sprinkle more cheese on and bake another 10. 
3) increase the sugar to 3Tbsp., punch it down when it’s done, then roll it out and sprinkle with cinnamon and raisins and rolled it into a loaf. I let it rise to double then bake (35-40 min @ 350). That is pretty popular in my house (I hate raisins so I don’t even try it!) 
4) roll out and cut into 10 strips and wrap each around a pepperoni stick and grated cheese, bake for 12 min., top with shredded cheese and bake another 10. By far the favorite around here, everyone loves them for lunches.

This recipe is a must try!

Most bread recipes I tried have resulted in heavy bread.  This white bread was a bit heavier than store brought bread, but much lighter than most.  It made great ham sandwiches.  I will make it again this week. 

I did not have dried milk. So I used the 2% milk.  I also added 1 Tbs of olive oil.  This made the dough wet. So I needed to add a bit more flour until the dough was no longer wet and tacky.

Loved this! I added 1 tsp of cardamom to make it special. I also used whole milk because that's all I had. Baked it on the sweet bread setting so it wouldn't get too dried out. Very moist, soft, and a nice consistent texture. Very easy to slice.

The first time I made this bread I just followed the recipe. It didn't come out quite right. However the second time around I followed some suggestions in the comments and it was perfect.

I'm trying this recipe again today in my bread machine. I made it a few days ago ,and my bread came out perfect ! The texture was fluffy,with a slightly flaky crust. It was gone the same day it was so good! I was looking for a recipe with all-purpose flour, and that didn't use powdered milk. This recipe calls for fresh milk,and I used 0% lactose free milk. I suppose almond milk or coconut milk could be tried as an alternative if you can't have dairy. It would be interesting to try it with gluten free flour,but maybe next time. I did not change anything in the recipe, but my bread machine baked it for 3h 40 min,which is the white bread ,medium crust setting for my particular machine.

I don't have a bread machine, but used my dough hook on my mixer to knead the dough.   The bread came out perfect and stayed soft and fresh for a few days while we ate it.   Great recipe !

Made this for the first time and followed the recipe exactly. It came out WONDERFUL for bread machine bread. Been making bread by hand for years but don't always have the time to hang around for the whole process. This bread is an excellent way to have an'almost as good and better than store bought' loaf without babysitting the whole process.

My family and I LOVE this bread recipe! The only change to the recipe I make is to add a beaten egg with the milk.....just makes it a little richer. I use my bread dough setting on my machine, take it out when it's finished, divide the dough into two equal parts, form loaves, and rise it again in the bread pans. Then I bake it in the oven 350 degrees for 35 minutes.......YUMMY AND CRUSTY.

I have made many, MANY bread recipes over the years, and especially from this site.  I have never had a recipe that worked every time until this one!  I follow StaceyL's instructions in her review because I do not use a bread maker, and it comes out perfect every time.  My family loves it so much I usually have to double the recipe and make two loaves!

This is wonderful!  My grandson has a sesame allergy, so it is just easier to make the bread.  Soft and delicious.  The only thing i would add is i use the 1.5 lb setting on my bread maker.  I am not sure that is the intended, but it works on my breville.

Made it twice this week, delivers as promised. Put it all in bread maker, pulled it out after 2 hours (having been mixed and risen once and mixed again), put into a bread loaf pan, let it rise for about 30-40 minutes, baked 35-40 min and it was perfect. Simple and very nice bread, light and beautiful flaky crust! Makes great toast! Thanks for a great recipe! Update: I’ve been using Bread machine yeast which means it doesn’t have to rise twice so I put it in the bread machine, let it mix, rest, mix rest, which takes 1:15 min, then in the loaf pan to rise before baking. Still wonderful!

Really good bread. Nicer than another recipe I tried which was very sweet for my liking. Although will have to half the quantities next time after the top of the bread hit the lid of the bread machine. I lost half the loaf because of this as the top stayed doughy due to moisture off the lid. This is my favourite bread so far though.

This was my first attempt at making white bread. I made the dough in my bread maker and baked it in the oven at 375* for 30 minutes. Came out wonderfully soft  on the inside and crisp and a little chewy on the outside. Son and hubby both gave it a thumbs up. This one is a keeper!

Made in my bread machine including the baking step and it came out perfect with a very even and soft inside and slightly flaky thin crust. I live at 6000'. The only change I made was to sprinkle about a Tblsp flour on while it was kneading as it was a bit sticky. I also had to scrape some flour from the sides into the dough but that often happens with my machine. This was probably the best bread I've made where I did the entire process in the machine. Often the top of the bread sinks/deflates and that did not happen. perfect for French toast and would hold up to a sandwich as long as you don't slice it super thin. Was very easy to slice and did not crumble.

I made this white bread by proofing and kneading. I proof the milk, yeast and used molasses instead then mixed with flour salt and butter. After incorporating all the ingredients I knead it for 8 mins then place in bowl with oil and test for 1 and 1/2 hours the deflate and knead again 5 mins then place in loaf pan and rest for 45 mins then bake 190 deg cel, 35 mins. Wallah perfect!

This is a very good basic bread recipe. First, I do not use a bread machine, so, I used the traditional proof and knead formula. I upped the salt by 1/4 tsp to cut the flat, used bread flour and added 1 tbsp of gluten for each cup of flour. It's really GREAT bread! The spring is outstanding and it makes heavenly toast. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe  several dozen times so far, and will continue to make it for my everyday white bread.

The only thing I do slightly different for perfect loaves every time is add the butter (Or margarine which I use) to the milk which I warm on the stove.

It makes a really nice loaf that is easy to cut with a bread knife,  and strong enough to spread butter on without the bread ripping.

All this without being a really dry or really dense bread is a plus for bread lovers everywhere.

2 thumbs up from this avid bread maker.

I followed one of the other reviewers comments about using their KitchenAid mixer.  I did need to add extra flour (close to around 1/2 cup).  I let it rise in a warm over, covered with a kitchen towel, for about an hour (it had more than doubled in size).  Punched it down, formed into a loaf, pushed it into a glass bread baking dish, let it rise another 20 minutes, placed in 350°F oven, baked 25 minutes, added one more minute, and the bread was done.
And it was delicious!

This bread is so fluffy and delicious. I made it per instructions the first time, and it was great, but we prefer bread that is a little sweet so i used my usual 3 tbsp sugar with the yeast. I have to use the bread machine for the whole thing. We all love love love this bread!

Great bread recipe and super adaptable. I've made it using brown sugar, white sugar, honey or maple syrup for the sweetener. I've made it with milk, water or a mixture of the two and it always works out! It does seem to fall a bit on top so I've increased the yeast by a quarter tsp, which seems to help. I love the soft texture, the simplicity and the adaptability of this recipe; A fantastic everyday bread! Thanks for the wonderful recipe, Lisa!

I've made this bread twice now.  This recipe makes a dense, chewy but soft center with a thin crust.  Really delicious and the limited ingredients make it one I can make without planning.  The next time I make it, I'll reduce the salt to 1 tsp. and increase the entire recipe by 1/2 to get two nice sized loaves.

Easy and excellent white bread. I put it on 1 pound loaf, medium crust.  It is a good crust and good texture inside.

I do not have a bread machine, so I followed StaceyL's review and made it, like she did, in my kitchenaid mixer.  My first loaf was a dud.  I followed the directions to the letter and it didn't rise.   I remade it, following my gut.  I used (not super hot) but warmer milk so that the yeast would activate.  I also already had my oven on from the first loaf, so anytime something needed to sit/rise, I put it on the stove top next to the vent.  It rose much better and looks 10x better than the first.

This was amazing.  It was light and fluffy.  Beautiful crust.  Took butter without getting mushy.  Just because I couldn't find it anywhere else, I cooked it as a 1.5 lb loaf on a med white setting. This is getting cooked again right now.

Just made this for the first time, and it was also my first time making bread, and it turned out WONDERFULLY! Plus, it was made with stuff that I already had in the cupboards and I didn't need to go buy anything special to make it, which is always a bonus!

This recipe is awesome. I followed the directions verbatim and received rave reviews from my family. The bread came out very light and airy. It was very quick to prepare and will be my go to recipe for white bread. Thank you Lisa.

Great recipe. Cooked up beautifully into a great loaf of tender bread that didn't crumble much. Made a good pairing with my pulled pork.

This was my first time using a recipe in my bread machine, i usually just do a box mix. I was not overly impressed but it might have been my inexperience and not the recipe. It was a little dense but again I think it was my fault and not the recipes. It did smell wonderful while baking though:) Might try it again and see if i can do better the second time around

Really good white bread. I added 1/3 cup sugar and used Rapid Rise yeast instead of Active Dry, which cut the time in half. When using rapid rise I first mixed all the dry ingredients (including yeast) then warmed the milk to about 120F, mixed it all together, kneaded, let sit for 10 minutes (replacing the first rise), then did NOT punch it down (skip punching down when using rapid rise) then let it rise in my slightly warmed toaster oven for about an hour and then baked for the recommended time and it was amazing! My boyfriend pretty much down the whole loaf with just butter. It was cool, except that now I have to make more bread but from now on I will definitely use rapid rise because it is so much faster. Great recipe!

My new favorite bread recipe! I made it the old fashioned way, took about 40 minutes in my oven.. but I love the crust. I love a soft crust, and this is the first bread recipe I have found that really has a crust the way I like it. Will make this one every week!

This is a great recipe, even when I manage to make a mistake and put things in the bread machine in the wrong order!  I did that once because I lost the manual for my ancient bread machine but with looking on the net, I found out how to do it.  I am getting a new Zojirushi BBCC-X20 Bread Machine soon (on order) and I am VERY anxious to try it with the new one!  Everyone loved the bread, including my extraordinarily "picky" DH!

I made this recipe yesterday changing only one thing; I set my breadmaker on the Dough cycle and baked it in the oven (after letting it rise a second time in the loaf pan) at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. It is wonderful, I'll make this recipe again!

This is an excellent, buttery bread. This was only the second time I've tried making bread with my bread machine and I was thrilled with how well it turned out. I used the light crust setting. The dough rose very well and the bread came out fluffy and light. I will defintely make this again. It was so easy and my family loved it.

This recipe came out only so-so. The texture was more crumbly when finished than a typical white bread. It also did not rise as much as I had thought it would. I proofed the yeast (no bread machine here, so I took it through two risings and kneaded 10 minutes, then baked for half an hour at 350). It did brown nicely and the flavor was good, but I would not make this again. It may well be better suited to a bread machine than the "old fashioned" way of making bread.

This was such an easy recipe, no special trip to the store for that certain ingredient, just uses basic things around the house thats the thing i love most about it. Used it to make french toast, came out great! Thanks for sharing this.

I am new to bread machine baking and was having a horrible time finding a recipe that didn't end up coming out like a brick. This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! Beautiful soft, tender white bread that wasn't lacking in flavor or texture. I baked mine on the "light" crust setting, and was pleased with a soft, golden brown crust. I'm readying to bake my third loaf in as many days. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this recipe four stars. It tastes wonderful, but the top fell. I don't know what happened. It seemed to be rising perfectly in my bread machine, then towards the end of the baking cycle it just fell. I may try doing as other posters suggesed, mixing it on the dough cycle, then letting it rise again and baking it in the oven. Thanks for the basic recipe! I will try this again. My house smells wonderful!

Yup, it made a pretty good bread.  Mine was a little more on the dense side, but was still tasty :)  Thanks!

This was good, I had to pull out my bread machine which I haven't used in a long time. But it was worth it, my kids already asked me to make it again.

I have made this recipe twice now and loved it each time!  I also made rolls out of it by just doing as dough in my bread machine and then rolling them out as rolls.  I like it just a bit sweeter so I added a little more sugar...but it's good bread!!

Didn't rise as much as I had expected but I will try to let the yeast do it's thing before I add the rest of the ingredients.  Tasted good though!

Revised - I used to much milk first time.  I put my machine on manual, let it rise a third time and then punched down and shaped into 12 rolls.  Let rise again until double then baked at 375 til brown.  Wonderful!

wow...and i thought my "standby" white bread recipe was good!!!!!! I served it for supper last night and didnt mention to the hubby or 10 yr old that this was a new recipe. Hubby took one bite and goes " wow...great bread..i love the crust!" I thought it was to good to be true when i was done adding the ingredients to my machine. This is sooooo simple!!!!!!

Yumm!! The bread was light and fluffy, and incredibly delicious. Normally, I don't like to eat bread plain, but this recipe was just as good plain as it was spread with marmalade. This bread disappeared the day I made it, and I ended up makiing another loaf for my family. Try it!

Well, made bread in bread maker.  It didn't rise very much and when I popped it out, it had collapsed 1/2 way down in the middle, while baking.  Maybe I need to add the whole packet of yeast instead of just 2 teaspoons.  Bottom half of bread was very good, though! And my 4-year-old loved it warm with butter, too!

Yummy!!  This is the easiest bread to make, and it's absolutely delicious.  I used bread machine yeast in place of the regular yeast, and my loaf was tall and airy with a great texture.  I can hardly wait for breakfast to see what kind of toast this makes!

This is by far the absolute best tasting
white bread I have ever tried. It rose beautifully and had a wonderful buttery taste. (However,I didn't have quite enough all-purpose flour so I had to use
the "bread machine" flour instead, but it was still perfect!!) A++++

This recipe did not work for me at all. It rose too fast and collapsed. I suggest using less yeast and sugar.

This is by far the easiest, most moist white bread I have made in my machine.  It takes only about 5 minutes to add all ingredients.  Definately one of the best.
