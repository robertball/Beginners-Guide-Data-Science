Authentic Mexican chicken soup: the best taste comes from using a whole chicken (cut up)with skin simmer in salted wateror you can  also add Knorr Suiza(chicken flavor) flavoring until cooked thru. Once chicken is cooked add veggies (carrots,potatoe,celery) a pinch of cumin (cilantro optional) and a handful of rice let simmer again and that is "michoacan style" chicken soup.

This recipe is a great starter. It was just the flavor I was looking for. I followed the recipe, but added/adjusted the following. I omitted the broth and used chicken and tomato bouillon cubes. I still had a very rich, deep flavored soup. I added 1/2 cup each celery, carrots and tomato, just because 1. I needed to use them up, 2. I thought this soup needed some veggies, and 3. I like those veggies in chicken based soups. I didn't make the rice - I had regular steamed rice already. Lastly, I added a squeeze of lemon to bring out all the flavors. Excellent!! My husband, who isn't big on soups even liked this one. Will make again and again. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great attempt at a Caldo Tlalpe√±o, a very typical Mexican chicken soup. In order to be true, it needs to have some small diced pico de gallo (tomato, onion, Serrano pepper) and Oaxaca cheese (Monterey Jack would be a good sub).  You can also add tomato puree (a natural one is better) and / or guajillo chilli that has been toasted, deveined and cleaned and mixed (in a blender) with a cup of the broth and the onion.

This is an awesome skeleton of the recipe! The first time I made it I used chicken broth, second and third time, I only used water.. The taste was the same! However, I think that was because the soup took on the taste of the veggies I added. I added celery, carrots, a potato, squash and lots of cabbage! Everything is to your preference and the end product is amazing! So glad I ran across this recipe, I was very intimidated to try and make a chicken soup, but this recipe really helped me! Thanks!!

Super yummy! I added veggies and and switched out the rice for curly noodles (1 cup dry) and it was delicious!  The vegetables that I used were red potatoes (3 chopped  up in 1/2inch pieces), 2 zuchinis, 1 yellow squash, small corn on the cobs that you can buy from the frozen aisle, and about a cup of baby carrots.

In addition to carrots, I added chayote (don't forget to peel), calabacitas and garlic. I used chicken quarters with the skin rather than chicken tenders.  Also, I deleted the chile powder.  All this based on what I've experienced with relatives and eating at Mexican restaurants.

This is as close to my favorite Mexican restaurant's Sopa de Pollo that I have found.  I did add pico to mine, but no other changes.  The broth is amazing!  No additional salt is needed if you follow this recipe.  I will make again, and soon!

Except I did not add bouillon. I used 99% fat free chicken broth and cooked brown rice in plain water without chicken broth or chile. I also added celery and carrots to the soup! It came out DELISH!

My family loves this soup. The only extra ingredient I add is a roasted Anaheim pepper.

I added fresh made pico de gallo, and sprinkled with cheese.  Would have been perfect with soft white cheese, but only had a Mexican blend.  Still, it was just what I was looking for.  Next time, would prefer to use a whole chicken.

Made this today. It's raining and 63deg. So why not?  I added celery and carrots and used water and 5 large chicken and 1 tomato cubes of Knorrs. Sided it with Monterey Jack cheese and sweet cornbread. Yummy!
