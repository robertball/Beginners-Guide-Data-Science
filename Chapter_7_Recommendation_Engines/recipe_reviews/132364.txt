Wow! The taste of Asia! Thanks for the great recipe. We didn't have the curry leaves and I used only about 1 teaspoon of the lime juice but it smelled and tasted just like we were back in Asia.

Like everyone else, I didn't have exactly the right ingredients, but it is a good basic recipe that you can do a lot with!  I didn't have serrano peppers, curry leaves or fenugreek seeds, but added a Tbsp of garam masala and some red pepper flakes to the spices.  I also pre-cooked and sliced some chicken, and added them in with the green beans.  It turned out great!

I used this more for inspiration...so I don't know if I have a right to rate it. I added chicken for the carnavore hubby and some shredded coconut and the whole can of c.milk to make more sauce - oh and a handful of dried apricots. Was sooo yummy...thanks for the headstart on my inspiration for dinner!

Enjoyed trying this nice side dish!  I didn't have access to curry leaves or fenugreek seeds, but otherwise made as written.  Flavorful and delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

We loved this one ... perfect over brown basmati rice for a vegetarian entree ... I just wish I had increased the recipe ... as written it was just enough for my husband and I for dinner - no seconds :-(

I liked it a lot too but would recommend cutting the green beans in bite size pieces and adding some chicken or pork.  I didn't have the curry leaves or fenugreek seeds, but wouldn't mind trying to find them for the next time I make this.  Very fragrant and flavorful dish!

I loved this! But, in truth, I changed it a lot. I didn't have time to get curry leaves or  fenugreek, so I used garam masala, as per another reviewer, and I added just a small amount of hot pepper, and, I used 1 TBS of brown sugar (as per another reviewer), and I added boiled potato cubes, sautéed mushrooms and bok choy. The green beans took longer than the recipe suggested, but, they were al dente in about 15 minutes. I tasted the flavoring continually and adjusted seasoning. It was amazing! Seriously the best curry I've ever eaten!!! And, I think the lime had something to do with it! This recipe (if I can recreate it), is a keeper!!!

I loved the spice combination. I added other  vegetables because I didn't have enough green beans. I served with rice.
This is a keeper.

Loved this recipe.  Had to look up a few substitutions since I didn't have curry leaves but did have kafir leaves (which worked great).  Also, didn't have enough beans for the recipe so added some potato sliced thin.  Because I like my curries with a bit more sauce than the recipe created as it is, I simply added a bit more coconut milk and a bit more spice.  My husband loved it.  I loved it.  Can't wait for the left-overs tomorrow!

I didn't have fenugreek or curry leaves but it was excellent. I added just about a half tsp of cane sugar to bring out the coconut flavor

Pretty tasty! I only had frozen green beans mixed with waxed beans and carrots, but the extra veggies only made this more delicious. I do like a sweet spicy curry so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar. The lime juice is amazing! I never knew that was what was missing in past curry recipes. I did adjust spices slightly to my preferences and used the whole can of coconut milk for extra sauce (and I thought it was grainy with only a 1/2 c). Next time I will  add cube tofu.

A tasty vegetarian entree! I Added a little vegetable broth and a lid when I added the beans so that they would not burn up. Salt brings out the flavors nicely.

Not being a good recipe reader I added the coconut milk too soon so the beans got effectively boiled in the milk and spices: Not a problem!  We didn't have Curry leaves but that too didn't hurt at all.  A winner for us!

Lovely recipe! I didn't have any coconut milk so used plain yoghurt and grated in some fresh coconut. I also served it with some chopped cilantro sprinkled on top

My husband and I loved this one.  I used it as a side dish to Tandoori chicken.  I used coconut oil instead of olive oil to mirror the coconut milk and I followed the spices exactly.  I couldn't get enough!  That's my photo.  Such a yummy recipe deserves a photo!
