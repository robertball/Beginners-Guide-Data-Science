I was in charge of making the turkey this last Thanksgiving and I came across this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and I have to say it was the best Turkey we've ever had.  Everyone was amazed how moist and flavorful the turkey was.  This will be my turkey recipe for now on.  It was perfect, I won't change a thing!

This really was easy for a first-time turkey girl!  I am not a cook, in fact, I think of myself as a terrible cook and I wanted to simply buy the frozen slab of turkey meat for Thanksgiving last year.  But my bossy little sister forced me to try to make a "real" turkey.  So she taught me how to search all recipes and we found this.  It was FANTASTIC.  Everyone loved our turkey, even my fussy "no-processed-food-ever-amazing-cook-sister".  I am going to use this every year!!!!  The turkey really does stay incredibly moist and it was delicious.  Make sure to search the for the video.  Last year it was linked right there with the recipe, but this year I had to do a google search to find it.  His step by step easy to follow video really helped.

2.10.12 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/219079/chef-johns-roast-turkey-and-gravy/ ... Only a partial review, BUT the simple herb coating is FABULOUS!  It coats the skin well enough that it doesn't burn or need covering; &, of course, tastes delicious!  I combined recipes which basically means, I used olive oil on, & some butter in the turkey.  Also put an apple inside - & a T of the seasonings.  I used a cup of apple juice & a cup of water in the pan.  Gravy was dark, but very good.  When turkey time comes again, I'll follow the recipe better.  :)  Note4Me: Coating: 2T Kosher, 1T freshly ground black pepper, 1T poultry seasoning, 1/2T sage

My husband said this was the best Turkey he ever ate in his life. It smelled so good as it was baking. I did not deviate from the recipe at all but did not make the gravy to make the dinner healthier. I also made Chef John's Mango Cranberry sauce, other recipes from All Recipes: Grecian green beans, green salad with cranberry vinaigrette and pumpkin pots de creme, and Ina's sausage stuffed mushrooms and her glazed carrots. Here is the recipe for the herb butter: 1 stick of softened butter, 3 cloves chopped garlic, 1 teaspoon of- lemon zest, poultry seasoning, black pepper, rosemary and 1.5 teaspoon of kosher salt.

What an easy, and beautiful, and flavorful, and crispy, *and* moist turkey!(however, I must admit that I did turn down the heat during the last hour thinking we would have to hold the turkey for late comers, but the bird was done 'on time' anyway?!) Made up the butter mixture, the spice mixture, & cut up the veggies ahead of time; helping us get the turkey into the oven so easily come Thanksgiving day. I was shopping for a recipe because it was time to help my daughter learn to roast a turkey, & I want her to learn to cook better than I myself can cook. Yes, my 12 year old daughter & I had prepped a turkey together once before following another method, which didn't work as well as my 'decent' turkeys of the past. So we went shopping together for a new recipe.  She was utterly sold on your approach.  I let her take the lead.  She loved watching your video, and her jaw dropped when she watched you loosen the skin on the breast with a rubber spatula (yes, another thing I'd missed out on in the past, but thanks to you, my daughter will have an easier time of it!).  I do plan to obtain a fresh turkey which we can brine next time, but I want to incorporate much of what we learned from you modifying for a brined bird.  Will try to remember to let you know how that goes if we proceed as planned.....  Either way, thanks so much for helping my daughter's second turkey far exceed anything my mother or I put on the table throughout our entire lives!  Gotta love it!  Thanks, Chef John!

This is the second time I am making the turkey. One was made for the saturday after thanksgiving, which came out great and the next one was made today. I used all of the ingredients with only one addition to the herb butter, garlic. Just used a small amount. The presentation of the bird is wonderful! the flavors were fantastic and it was so very moist and tender! The steps from the video were spot on and very helpful. Can't wait to try more Chef John recipes!

The vegetable mixture, herbs and spices combined with lots of butter made this the best turkey I've ever made. I'll use this recipe again. Very "Chef-y." Did not make the gravy due to the fact I could not find the bag of giblets. (I DID find the bag after I carved the turkey.) Maybe next time, Chef John. :)

I want to share how I make turkey day less stressful.  I roast  the turkey 1-2 days ahead along with the neck and giblet, onion, 2-4 cloves of whole garlic, 1 stalkcelery and a sprinkle of anise or fennel seeds.  One hour before turkey is done add 2-3 cups water to the pan to create a flavorful broth OR remove turkey  from the roaster once done then add about 2-3 cups water to the pan and simmer on low with the neck and giblet and  wing tips and veggies about 1/2 hour or till flavorful.  Taste for salt.  Strain into another container that will hold turkey slices.  Slice the breast and dip into broth  on both sides .  Layer neatly in ovenproof baking dish large enough to hold sliced up turkey breast.  You can salt and pepper each layer if needed.    You can repeat with the dark meat but it's not necessary since it is juicier than white meat.   Slice dark meat and store with white meat or in a separate baking dish.   Cover and refrigerate.  Reheat before serving either in microwave or in oven covered tighty with foil.    By doing this ahead  the breast marinates in the broth and stays moist.   Use any leftover broth to make gravy.  The only thing you need to cook on Thanksgiving day are the accompaniments.  Everyone has always raved about the flavor and moistness of the white meat when done this way and I am not exhausted by the time I sit down to eat.

This recipe was amazing!  The turkey was moist and FULL of flavor.  The aroma in the kitchen was heavenly!  This was my first Christmas turkey and we will definitely be repeating this next year and throughout the year.  I used my food processor to quickly chop the veggies and it really cut down on the prep time.  I also did them in advance to save time on the busy holiday.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving 2013.  I've never made a turkey before.  However, Chef John's recipe was the BEST!  I received a lot of compliments and I for the first time actually enjoyed eating the turkey because it was soo moist and flavorful.  The only did one thing different from the recipe...I injected my turkey the night before I cooked it with seasonings.  Other than that the gravy recipe and turkey were on point!

Made this for a 24 lb turkey.  Also, brined it for about 18 hours using the "turkey brine" from here.  Took about 6 hours. I took the foil off at 5 hours and basted a couple of times.  This was the best turkey we've ever had.  So juicy and flavorful.  Everyone raved about it.  We'll be using the every time we host thanksgiving.  Didn't do the gravy, but will try it next time.

So this was my first time ever making a turkey...and I was scared.  Had people coming over for Thanksgiving and I didn't want to mess it up. I saw so many recipes telling you to brine overnight but I settled on this one and it came out PERFECTLY! Juicy, tender and tasty! Buttering the turkey inside and out was key!  I was told to add a few slices of bacon under the skin of the turkey and I did.  The fat from the bacon gave added flavour and moistness.  The only other change I made to the ingredients was to add a cup of white wine to the pan.  Other than that I made it exactly as written and it was perfect!

I'm a novice home cook and this was my first Christmas turkey.  It was easy, fun, and the most delicious turkey I have ever tasted.  The breast meat was juicy and the fresh herbs made the house smell fantastic for many hours.  Can't wait for next year!

Although I am not much of a cook, this recipe is virtually foolproof!  It was perhaps the most tender and moist bird that I have ever cooked.  It was also the first time that I used a meat thermometer, so that could have helped too.  I think that I made a mistake on the gravy, but it was still very good.  Thank you for this great and easy recipe!

This was one of the best turkeys I have ever delivered to the table!  I would have never thought to have placed it on a bed of vegetables instead of a metal rack.  The juices from the pan and stock made for a fabulous gravy.  The only thing I did differently was I stuffed the bird.  Thanks for the great tips, Chef John!

Our family made the turkey this year using recipe for the first time. It was a HUGE hit, with several family members saying it was the best turkey they'd ever had. We followed the recipe exactly, with only 1 addition, we put a stick of butter inside...butter makes everything better. :)

This recipe and associated video series were absolutely perfect. Covering the breast till the end allowed the dark meat to be done at the same as the white. Everything was very moist. The gravy came out perfect and was sumptuous! The only change I made was to mix the outside portion of the herb seasoning in an olive oil+butter mixture and then I used a brush to coat the bird. I'm a single dad, my kids said it was the best Turkey they ever had ... 'nough said!

My Kosher turkey came without  the neck or the giblets. So, I could only use the turkey part of this recipe.
The mixture of the veggies and the herbs, really makes this recipe stand out. And to me, the  secret to a tender and moist turkey is the steam chamber created by entirely covering the bird with heavy duty aluminum foil for the first 2 hours of cooking (not just the breast). Then uncovering and basting for the rest of the cooking time.

11/27/17: Still making this recipe and it's works every time. Watch the video and see the this link for the compound butter, though whatever herb based butter you choose to use will work great. https://www.thespruce.com/perfect-turkey-compound-butter-recipe-101448
12/22/15: Followed the recipe as is and it was the most flavorful and moist turkey  we have ever made. The gravy tasted rather basic, but was a good turkey gravy. We will continue to make this recipe for turkey and gravy for now on! 
MAKE AHEAD: We make the turkey the day/night before Thanksgiving, carve up the birds, and put the slices in two separate aluminum trays (white meat vs. dark meat). I usually make extra turkey broth to add to the trays to reheat the next day in the oven (@325 or 350 F depending on what other dishes are being made/warmed). We just add a little broth to the trays and cover them tightly with aluminum foil. This will prevent the turkey from drying out when reheated. I reheated the gravy in a saucepan over low heat to continue filling the gravy bowl as needed.

This is the best turkey recipe ever! This required no modifications. The seasoning was perfect, the skin was crisp to perfection, and the meat was moist! This is my go to turkey recipe and I will not ever look for another!

This recipe would get ten stars from me if I could!  I hosted a "Friendsgiving" the weekend after Thanksgiving so I was in charge of the turkey.  We had 17 people coming for dinner and I was pretty nervous about making sure it was perfect.  I had a 22.5lb bird and followed the recipe exactly.  The turkey was picture perfect when it came out of the oven!  We did end up letting it rest for about 45 minutes because some of the guests were a bit late.  When my husband carved into it, the juices were flowing and it was falling apart to the point where he had a hard time getting it on the serving platter!  The only thing that didn't turn out for me was the gravy.  I'm not sure what I did wrong but it never thickened up.  That was ok because the turkey was so good it didn't need any gravy!  I will also admit that the turkey was brined over night in a salt/veggie broth/rosemary/sage/poultry seasoning mixture.  I would definitely suggest this recipe to anyone who is a first time turkey cooker!  Oh and watch Chef John's video too.  The spatula technique he uses to get the butter under the skin was brilliant!

A nice basic formula for cooking a turkey. The herb and seasoning choices are very good. The two key things to take away from this recipe is spreading the butter under the breast skin and putting foil on the breast in the beginning. This makes a juicy and moist breast. This was the first time I cooked a turkey and the breast meat was moist. The celery carrot and onion is a nice touch. I feel compelled to add potatoes. Like chef John says the possibilities are endless, experiment with the seasonings.

Our family ruled this the best turkey we've ever made! The turkey was moist and the homemade gravy turned out. We enjoyed it so much at Thanksgiving, we made it again for Christmas Eve. There's a lot of seasoning, so we sprinkled the turkey nicely and had quite a bit left over. I saved that for the next time we bake a chicken. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this turkey very much. I used a bag to cook it though instead of just covering the breast with foil. Very tender!

This is a terrific recipe. I have made many turkeys and was delighted not to have to worry about basting this time. The turkey was moist and flavorful.  One thing - the part about tucking the wings under the bird.  I could not make this happen, and left the wings in the normal position.  I placed foil over the entire bird for all but the last hour in the oven and the wingtips were not burned - overall the color was perfectly golden brown.

Chef John is the bomb! Your videos and recipes for turkey cut through the conflicting advice I've read elsewhere and give clear, easy-to-follow directions with oh-so-good results. Although I didn't make the gravy part of this recipe, the turkey was delicious, made especially so by the compound butter you have posted on your blog. Also tried this with a whole chicken (at 400 degrees), which was equally yummy. Thank you for easing my turkey anxiety!

For the past 11 years I have tried a different turkey recipe each year, looking for one I liked.  This one is not only easy, but absolutely delicious!!  And, I have made gravy before, but not turkey gravy.  My husband (and the rest of us) love it!!  This is one recipe I will use for many years to come.

Fantastic!! Was a very juicy and flavorful bird. 

Issues: had to hunt down a garlic herb butter...found one on a different site that was probably close enough to what Chef John used. 

Also, I plan to pull the wings back out on the last hour when pulling off the foil so that they also get that yummy crispy, but not burnt, skin along with the breast skin.

My wife said, and I agree, that this is the best turkey we’ve ever had - bar none! I was disappointed because I didn’t allow myself enough time for the bird to sit in a brine first. But I needn’t have worried. It was extremely moist all the way through. Cooking time was spot on for our 14 pound bird. Definitely a keeper!!

No changes, just followed the advice to use whatever seasonings I felt like using.  The grandchildren now insist that only granddaddy can make Thanksgiving turkey because "he makes the best turkey!"  This recipe is how to do it.

I had never made a turkey before and was nervous.  I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out perfectly.  Everyone raved about how good and moist it was.  I made this with Chef John's make ahead turkey gravy,  which is also absolutely delicious.  Never again will I be nervous to make a turkey.  Thanks,  Chef John!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2016, and it was the best turkey that I had ever made! I bought a fresh (not frozen) 13-1/2 lb turkey, did not brine - and just followed this recipe and ended up with the juiciest turkey we've ever had! When my husband went to check the temp (we cooked it for 4 hours at 325 degrees), when he stuck the probe into the thigh, the juices literally came spurting out. THAT's when you know you're going to have a juice bird! Thanks, Chef John!

This is the best turkey I've ever eaten. Very Moist. And the Gravy is from another planet awesome! I'm now the family Turkey cook because of this recipe. Thanks John :) I followed it to spec and it is amazing. Will never do other recipes. There simply is no better Herb Butter under skin recipe.

This is the second time I cooked turkey for Christmas in my life and it came out perfectly. I didn't have the rosemary and sage and no thread. I put the onions. carrots and celeries instead and it still so good. It's very juicy and tender.  Thank you so much to put this out here so that a person like me who never cooked turkey before CAN COOK it.

Thank you for giving me the confidence to make my first turkey gravy after years for using the packaged mixes. You made it seem so easy. And it was!  My gravy came out so flavorful that I did not feel the balsamic was necessary this time but I might try it in the future.

Turkey was great and moist- It was my first turkey ever so I was very happy it turned out ok, but I would not add balsamic vinegar to the gravy next time. I did not care for the flavor.

I have made this a couple of times per year for the last three or four years.  It always comes out fantastically.  I do usually cook it breast side down though, which has also made a tremendous difference.

Didn't care for all the vegetables and too much liquid.   The brined turkey tasted very good and will always cook it in a 325 oven from now on.

This was by far the easiest and best tasting turkey I ever made. I started with a fresh Amish turkey and made it exactly as written.  Even the gravy was delicious and I have always struggled to make a good gravy.  Let your turkey sit out a couple hours before you start. This is exactly how I will make turkey from now on.

First time cooking a turkey in years and it came out moist and perfect!  I made this recipe as Chef John described with the exception that instead of laying they turkey on a bed of veggies, I used a classic roasting pan and rack.  I used the butter mixed with spices under the skin (which did not look as smooth as John's did in the video), I put spices in the cavity with fresh rosemary and sage.   The confusing part for me was the time needed to cook the turkey.   I learned, disregard everything else and figure on ~20 min/lb.   The wrapper on the turkey said a 16 lb turkey would take 3 1/4 hours...not even.  It took just short of 5 hours in a 325 oven.  
I so appreciated having this recipe and this video.  Thanks chef John.

This was the best turkey I have every made, and I used to try different recipes, brining it, doing this, doing that.... Our guests commented about how moist it was and how flavorful. Even people who do not like turkey normally went for seconds. 

I followed the recipe exactly, except I had a bigger turkey so I used a bit more butter and I also roasted it at 350F instead of 325 F because I calculcated that based on the weight it would need to cook too long and I panicked. It still was awesome! 

This is how I'll make the turkey every time from now on!

Tasted good but no drippings to make the gravy. The vegetables 9n the bottom of the pan just get tossed, and the low oven temperature seems to prevent fat from dripping out. Would not do this recipe again.

Came out just perfect! The only substitute I made was sage for poultry seasoning, I didn’t have the poultry seasoning. I omitted all the other herbs and no carrots, again, just because of what I had on hand. Delicious, perfectly moist, will make again!

This was absolutely the best turkey I have ever made. I had a 15 pound Butterball turkey. I did not have the fresh herbs, so used dried ones. The turkey was completely done in 3 hours, which is quite early. Check your turkey frequently because they tend to get done when they want to. I also did not make the gravy for this recipe as my mother-in-law showed up with the gravy.

I used turkey broth instead of water to cook the neck , heart and gizzards. Also used turkey broth to the pan instead of water. I did not use the balsamic vinegar.

Absolutely best turkey recipe. I put a lot of extra garlic inside, but don’t really make any other changes. I have made this probably 10 times and every timeout comes out beautifully. Even when I accidentally over cook it it’s still most and delicious!

Of course this was awesome, it's a Chef John recipe! :) Loved the flavored butter mix under the skin. I've used an olive oil/rosemary/garlic mixture before and that was great also. Putting a fat-blend seasoning under the breast skin really does help to keep it moist.

Love the videos, they are so helpful.

This was the first time making a turkey and it was delicious. It got rave reviews from everyone even though I managed to over cook it just a little. I’ll just have to check the temperature a little sooner next time.

This was fab. One juicy turkey for the guests. Watch the video. It really doesn't get much easier, and the gravy was mighty tasty. What a feast!

My Mom and I made our Thanksgiving turkey with this recipe and it was probably the best Turkey we've eaten let alone made ourselves!! The recipe was easy to follow and despite not having all the ingredients for the butter we used what we had and used our dried herbs instead of fresh.  It was still amazing!!! We also made the gravy and used cornstarch instead of flour so it was gluten free. We basically didnt need to add any extra spices or salt and it was perfect. Everyone raved about it. Thanks Chef John for the videos and recipes.

it's summertime and I was looking for a different recipe from what I use in my normal holiday recipe. This was by far the best recipe and easiest -  and I had everything on hand. I used my roaster oven. I added two halved lemons inside the cavity with the other ingredients listed. A 10  pound turkey was done in 2.5 hours but I let it rest inside the roaster for 1 hour with roaster turned off and cover on. Amazing! The gravy recipe I followed as listed but added garlic/onion  powder and salted and peppered to taste. I love the idea of taking the onions from the turkey roast pan and saute' in the turkey drippings and butter before adding the flour and Turkey broth. I struggle with making a good homemade gravy- This gravy was superb! I will make this again for my holiday meal.

This was a great Turkey recipe. I bought  a utility turkey for 1.00/lb so I was willing to try something different than our usual turkey recipe.  It came out so moist and delicious. The butter mix under the skin gave it a wonderful flavour. It browned beautifully in the oven and produced a sufficient amount of drippings for gravy. My only change that I will make next time is eliminating some carrots as I feel this gave the gravy a sweeter taste. (I did not use balsamic vinegar as I did not have any on hand, maybe that would have balanced the sweetness.) Will make again!

This is a great recipe, and I have always cooked my turkey on top of a few vegetables. However this year Intried something different. A few weeks before the holiday I bought turkey thighs and cooked them with the carrots, celery and onion. I had lots of juice and made and froze my gravy. 

When I cooked the turkey, I placed vegetables inside the cavity but did not out any outside. Although it did not produce a lot of juices in the pan, this was the best roast turkey I have ever made. 

Also my family loved my gravy that I only had to thaw and reheat.

This was, without a doubt, the very best turkey I have ever fixed. I followed the recipe exactly, seasoning the butter with poultry seasoning. It was perfectly juicy and the taste was wonderful. I'm making it again for Christmas dinner.

Quite a few steps but definitely worth it.  The gravy was the best I have ever made and the turkey was delicious and moist.  My turkey was 15.5 lbs and it took 4 hours at 325 degrees.

Made this yesterday and followed directions exactly including using Chef John's recommended compound butter mixture.  The turkey was moist and flavorful, and the gravy was also a hit with everyone in attendance.  Thanks for helping to make this a great Thanksgiving.

I cooked a 20# turkey in a baking bag, following the recipe that came with the cooking bag.  I multiplied the ingredients by 1.5.  Other than that, I followed Chef John's recipe.  Turkey was incredibly moist and tender.  Enjoyed by all.

I made this exactly as written and the turkey was so juicy and moist! I used the herbed butter referenced in the video. I didn’t make the gravy because I had already made Chef John’s make ahead gravy (which heated up beautifully). A 16 pound turkey took a little under 4 hours. Will be my new go to turkey recipe!

The absolute best turkey I’ve ever cooked.  In the 45 years I’ve been making turkey, this recipe is the best, wonder flavor, moist delicious meat you can cut with a fork.  I make the chef John’s Make Ahead turkey gravy, my family and friends call it liquid gold. Thank you Chef John!  I will never stray, just yummy.

I made this for a  dinner for 15.  The turkey was fabulous. The only thing I added was a medium size apple , chunked, to the veg mixture.  Rave reviews from the guests. So moist and the gravy was superb!

This is now my favorite recipe. I do not choose a different one every year. The only difference I make is to add thyme with the butter under the skin. 
I've always been a die hard - cook the stuffing inside - but after tasting the fresh herbs permeate this bird - you won't go back either!

Really love this recipe!  I've been using it for several years.  No need to brine for days; simply follow the recipe in the Thanksgiving Day morning and by the noon a juicy and flavorful turkey is done.  My guests love my turkey and the gravy so much and they are always surprised to find out I only get up in the morning to prepare it.  Thanks to Chef John for the butter trick!  I use the cooking wine with water for making gravy stock and roasting turkey.  In the rub spice, I add about 1/4 tsp of all spice and garlic powder but omit fresh rosemary and sage that my family don't like.

This was our Thanksgiving turkey last year, and we just scoured the internet to find it again.  Great video instructions for the newbies (us).  Simple and delicious.

This was my first time to roast a turkey, and it turned out beautifully!  I changed nothing about the recipe for the turkey or the gravy!  I am even going to make turkey stock as well from the bones!!

I used all the ingredients for the roasting of the turkey but instead of chopping the vegetables in large chunks I  chopped them up smaller. It still turned out great.  I followed another recipe for the gravy.

I made this for our Christmas dinner. It was a hit!! First time more than half of the turkey don't go to waste. It . was . gone!!
Everybody complimented it. The gravy  came out spectacular. 
My suggestion would be to put both the turkey and the gravy recipes together, in one place, so people don;t have to go looking for one of them some place else.
Thank you!!!

Made this for Christmas day dinner. The turkey was moist, and delicious. Rave reviews by all, even the toughest food critics.  Mine was a 15 pound turkey which I cooked for 3 hours and 45 minutes.  The gravy wa delicious, as well. Served with Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes which always are a success. Highly recommend!

The turkey was juicy and tender as promised, but the gravy was waaaaay too thin and not very flavorful.  I didn't see the suggestion of how to make it thicker until it was too late.  There did not seem to be much turkey fat in the pan drippings.  Perhaps I added too much water to the vegetables to begin with.  I would not make the gravy this way again.

Wow I’ve prepared turkey in so many different ways. This turkey so far was my favorite. So moist, tender and flavorful. Always enjoy Chef Johns humor and cheerfulness. PS I did add extra seasoning to my butter.

Very moist and flavorful. Followed recipe, just added fresh rosemary, sage, parsley and garlic to butter. Used half stock from giblets and half pan juices for gravy. Absolutely the best turkey and gravy! Will be making this year round!!

I loved this recipe! I did not use the veggies; and I did stuff it which lengthened the cooking time; but it was very juicy and had wonderful flavor. I have never learned to lift the skin and what a difference that made; especially using his recipe for the butter mix.  My mother watched as I prepared; always ready for giving instructions and she was convinced that not putting it in a bag would dry it out. She was amazed how it turned out with a foil cover. I will always cook my turkey's this way as it just couldn't be improved upon......

The turkey was very bland. We used more seasoning than what was called for and it still did not taste like anything. Also the suggestion he gave in the video for the amount of time the turkey should have been in the over was wayyyy too long. Our turkey was over cooked.

Chef John is the kind of person that naturally excels at sharing his experience and skills in a manner that is achievable by the enthusiast building  foundational principles of cooking applicable beyond the recipe at hand. This turkey recipe is no exception and I highly recommend to anyone looking for a savory bird.

I followed instructions carefully and was completely satisfied.  The meat was tender and tasty and fell off the bone. I always feel confident with Chef John's recipes and this was no exception.  I will be cooking it this way from now on!

Outstanding! Followed the directions as in the video using Chef John's herb compound butter. This was my first time cooking a turkey (or any large bird) and everyone really enjoyed the flavor! Definitely moist and tender. Thank you for sharing!

I have used this recipe for the last 3 or 4 years because my family LOVES it! I am not a great cook and this was so simple.Thank you for posting it with the videos. My family thinks I rule the Thanksgiving Turkey now and won't let anyone else make it. :-) Only change I made after the 1st time was to decrease the herbs some when I brine first so the flavor is not overwhelming. Some of my family thought it was fine without decreasing them so it depends on the person. :-)

I made it exactly as Chef John says and it was the most moist, flavorful turkey and gravy I have ever had. My husband was full of compliments, we were both amazed at its perfection. I've also done the seasoned butter with dried poultry seasonings instead of fresh, but kept the fresh garlic and it was still amazing!

I loved this recipe for the seasonings and prep of the bird. Chef says the butter under the breast skin keeps the meat moist and I am sold on the technic. I didn't have available fresh rosemary or save so I added dried of the two to my taste.

Flavor was 5 star, but dry turkey and runny gravy brought it down to 3. I followed the recipe the way it was written, excluding the optional Balsamic Vinegar.  The flavor was really good, but the  turkey's white meat came out very dry, the dark meat was juicy. Next time I'll either wrap the whole thing in foil, instead of just the top or I'll cook it breast side down to start. The gravy also had great flavor but had the consistency of water when I followed the recipe. I ended up having to get another pot and cook the butter, turkey fat and flour again and then poor the first pot of gravy into that one, was perfect after that. If the turkey wasn't dry and I didn't have to make the gravy twice it would've been 5 star.

I shouldn't even rate this...it really just provided inspiration. I definitely coarsely chopped up the veggies and did that part, but other than that I winged it.

I used half turkey stock and half water for the turkey. I mixed my seasonings into softened butter and coated the outside and under the skin with that mixture (Chef John's YouTube video was helpful for technique).

It was my first turkey and it was a total success so thanks Chef John!

Oh - My - Goodness! If I could give this recipe/technique an extra star I would. My turkey was SO moist and tender and tasted unbelievable. I used a 17 lb frozen turkey - thawed for 4 days in the fridge. I did not use all of the seasoned salt, but other than that I stuck to the exact recipe. I also made Chef John's gravy, which was EXCELLENT and so simple. I did change it by only boiling the neck with the bay leaves and a little pepper for the stock. I started the stock right after I put the turkey in the oven and once it was done I put the it in the fridge and checked off my list of things to get done before our guests arrived. The house smelled amazing within the first 10 minutes of the bird being in and the stock on the stove. Also, I used the temp from the deepest part of the breast and took it out once that read 175 (well done). I will be using this recipe for any and every turkey I make from now on. Rave reviews from my family. And may I add this was my first turkey! Thanks Chef John!

This was my first 5-star turkey recipe from Allrecipes.com - rave reviews, looked and smelled and tasted wonderful!  I used ground instead of fresh sage and didn't make the gravy per this recipe but everything else was delicious!  Served alongside the make-ahead mashed potatoes and crock pot stuffing.  Awesome!

Awesome recipe but a little complicated and hard to make but it was like a journey.  It really came out fantastic though, my son and I loved it so thank you, Chef John!  

Prepare the turkey the night before to let everything melt in.  The prep time of one hour is a joke unless you are a chef.  
It took me two hours to prep but I am a cook, not a chef.  Also, the temp and cook time I think are assuming a chef's oven.  I had an 18 pound un-stuffed bird that I did for 4.5 hours at 350 in a household oven and it came out great.

My advice, skip the gravy recipe at the end, too complicated and how the heck do you separate the onions from the other veggies after cooking?  And how do you separate the darn fat when you have to serve it in fifteen minutes?  

Find a simple gravy recipe and use that but remember that the pan drippings have water in them so they are not just fat so you have to modify most standard gravy recipes.   Also, start making the gravy before the bird is done cooking, allow 45 mins.  Really great recipe and now that I know it will be fun to play around with.

Even though I am a "brine" fan, I wanted to try something different. I prepped and cooked a 23 pound turkey as directed and it came out incredibly flavorful with delicious gravy. Everyone loved the moist, aromatic flavors as they kept going back for more. The gravy was a huge hit and made enough to cover everyone's healthy appetite plus left overs. Only thing I am going to change next time is take the turkey out of the fridge ahead of time so it's not so cold, allowing the butter mixture to distribute easier. Thanks to Chef John for another amazing recipie !

I got stuck making the turkey this year due to work schedules.  We got a fresh turkey from the local farm, and while I feel Chef John's recipe made a huge difference, the meat itself was all due to the bird.  If you can, spend the extra money and buy a fresh/not frozen turkey!

I noted that there was a difference in the written and video instructions.  The written said to put the butter on the turkey and then the seasoning.  The video has them mixed up together - I'll try that next time, this year I put them on separately per the written ones.  

The only trouble I had was when it came time to baste the bird, I couldn't find my baster anywhere!  I ended up pouring a little bit of boxed chicken stock into a ladle and pouring it over the turkey - I did this every 15 minute for the last 75 minutes of cooking.  

I also followed Chef John's recipe for the gravy, although I chopped up the giblets as my husband likes the chunks in it.  Adding the extra boxed chicken stock worked out well as otherwise there wouldn't have been nearly enough drippings.  This gravy was NOTHING like my mother-in-law's, so I was nervous.  Other than keeping the giblets, I followed the recipe to a T, including the splash of balsamic and the chopped fresh sage.  This recipe made an absolutely gorgeous dark brown gravy that may have been the best I've ever eaten!

Several of Chef John's recipes combined to make this a pretty perfect meal, thank you!

The gravy as presented in the recipe turned out very thin. Much better once I doubled the fat and flour. Everything else was just wonderful. Enough leftover's that I'm going to try a turkey pot pie.

Disclaimer:  I am not a fan of turkey.  Have never really been wowed by it.  
Good recipe, nothing outstanding.  The key to any recipe is probably just putting the butter under the skin.  I didn't understand the purpose of the carrots and celery in the cavity.  I just bought a package of poultry herbs instead of all the separate herbs (saved on expense!).   Next time I would mix the poultry seasoning and salt with half a stick of softened butter and spread that under the skin on the breast meat and then spread another 1/2 stick of softened butter all over on top.

I've been brining  my turkeys the last few years, but tried Chef John's turkey recipe this year.  Following his directions and  using the herb butter produced a more flavorful turkey. I overcooked it a little but it was still moist and good. No more brining for me.

I've made turkey dinner for Thanksgiving for many years. My turkey with my own recepie and seasonings have usually come out very good and moist no complaining. I wanted to try a new recipe besides the same ol one I do on whim. This was friggin awesome. Very very very good. I'm going to make it again next year when all the family comes for thanksgiving. I wouldn't change a thing it was great. Funny thing is I boiled and simmered the neck and giblets. And forgot about that stock for the gravy and ended up making the gravy from al of the juices from the pan of the turkey. After the gravy was made I laughed my  off because there sat the giblets and neck and all the stock. But thankfully the gravy was amazing even with all
Of the stock from the pan of the turkey. Really didn't need to use or boil
And simmer the giblets  and stuff. Everyone raved about the turkey how moist it was and so funny they said had never tasted a better gravy ever. Hahaha

I have used this recipe for 2 years already and will be using it again for Thanksgiving this year. The turkey comes out so good and juicy. Last year I had 2 guests that don't really like turkey and never really eat turkey but they were definitely eating some of this one and they were shocked that it came out so juicy , everyone loved it. Always comes out great. I love this recipe and it's so easy.

This made the most delicious and moist turkey and gravy! I am doing this again this year.  I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I mixed my own.

I used this recipe for Thankgiving last year, which was my first year hosting the family. It turned out perfectly, nicely browned just like the picture. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This is basically what I do every year with following notes:
-I use the stock as it is boiling as basting juice, then pull liquid from turkey pan back into basting stock.
-I either stuff turkey with sausage stuffing, or include bread in mix with onions/carrots/celery for stuffing.

Makes lots of great gravy as well as juicy, flavorful turkey.

Made as written. This will be my go to recipe for turkey gravy  forever. Made it the week before Thanksgiving and froze it, thawed it the day before it was needed and and then added the dripping  from the cooked Turkey. Race reviews. Thanks Chef John!

I just LOVE this recipe!!  It is so outstanding and delicious.  I use a black oval roaster with the lid to cook my turkey in for perfect and moist results every time.   I make this every year at Thanksgiving and it never disappoints!

Made this last night.  Very very moist!  Just used salt and pepper mix and didn't stuff turkey.  Plain butter under the breast skin and all over turkey -- worked well.  The turkey came out great.  Rave reviews!

Excellent.  Best turkey I ever made.  I usually put olive oil, seasonings and garlic under the skin.  When I went to make it, my cookbook with the recipe I use, was already packed (I am getting ready to move) so I used this one since the butter and seasonings are put under the skin.  I like your method of putting the butter mixture under the skin.  Your video was very helpful.  I also added several cloves of garlic-a must in my opinion.  Delicious.  This is my new go-to recipe for turkey.  Thank you, Chef John.

This recipe gave us one of the best Thanksgiving turkey's we ever had.  The only change I made was to rub the salt/spice mixture onto the turkey two days before cooking it - like a dry rub.  Then refrigerate the loosely covered turkey until Thanksgiving morning.  And I didn't use the balsamic vinegar.  It was great!

I've done a variety of turkeys and this by far is our favorite.  I also bring this to a large party and every time someone says I didn't like turkey but I do now.  Never dry, very flavorful.  Perfect.  Thanks Chef John.

Very good and easy.  I made one time without fresh herbs and the next time with fresh herbs and it is much better with fresh.  I stuffed my turkey with Stovetop stuffing after I put the herbs, onions and carrot mixture into the cavity.  I overcooked my turkey for 45 minutes to make sure the stuffing was at the correct temperature.  The herbs infused into the stuffing and the turkey was moist.  I got a compliment that it was the best stuffing and turkey they've had.  I also made the gravy ahead of time using Chef John's recipe.  I did not feel stressed out this year.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first attempt at turkey, and everyone loved it! I was so happy with how moist it turned out, I always hated my family's turkey because it's dry and tasteless. I can't wait until next year to make this again!

Perfect! I've done my turkeys mostly the same way for years, but have never roasted on a bed of mirepoix before this year. It was so yummy, and my dogs really enjoyed feasting on the carrots that came from the pan. Love this method and it's now four days after Thanksgiving and my leftovers are still moist and delicious.

This made for a delicious and juicy turkey.  I did not flavor the butter, just used it plain between the breasts and skin because I was concerned about too much since I had all the fresh herbs in the cavity.  It was a hit!  This is a keeper!  Thank you Chef John!

Our family Thanksgiving meal began with everyone enjoying a delicious slice of this turkey, and it was a big hit.  I prepped and cooked the turkey according to the recipe, making no changes.  My husband raved about the flavor.

The gravy was so-so, and I didn't really get any kind of awesome extra flavor from the herb butter mix under the skin.

This was a perfect roasted turkey!  I followed the directions exactly for the turkey and it was wonderful.  Everyone said the best they've ever had.  We went our own route with the gravy but I'm sure this one would have been great.

This is an absolutely great turkey recipe.  Placing the butter under the skin of the breast is really a key step.  I also liked the vegetables and a little water in the bottom of the roasting pan.  The one thing that did not work out well was the placement of the foil over the back top of the turkey.   I ended up with an "untanned" backside.  I would more carefully watch over that the next time.

I used this recipe cooking a 21lb turkey but I used a Turkey bag instead of roasting, cutting the time bye 2.5 hours, the herb mixture was something I have never done, but I will from now on, bye using the bag method and this recipe together the juices from the bag and the giblet stock made the best gravy ever!!!! the sage and rosemary blend added serious flavor bye far the best turkey I have ever cooked personally ty chef John :)

I used this for Thanksgiving last year and am now back again this Thanksgiving.  Last year my now husband insisted that he didn't like turkey because of how dry it is.  Challenge accepted! He has changed his mind about turkey thanks to Chef John.

I made this last Thanksgiving as my first turkey ever. I however did not try the gravy portion because I was already a bit overwhelmed cooking for 12-15 for my first Holiday meal ever. I followed the recipe perfectly. It had great flavor and very moist. Even my husband who doesn't care for turkey came back for seconds.  I did however, brine my turkey over night. I'm here printing it off again for this year. Thank you for sharing this recipe. My fear of turkey is over

EASY GREAT I followed very closely. I used a Butterball turkey. It was very good and very moist. Just watch the tablespoon of pepper in seasoning mix. I thought very peppery and worried, but others liked, and so did I, 
just don't over due. Also key, don't dry it out.
Sometimes I put a bit of balsamic vinegar in gravy I 
did not this time. I think because of strong pepper flavour
2nd time  I did not get butterball and did not use as much 
pepper. It was fine but not as good.

Made it exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.  It was excellent, and the gravy was superb too.  I'll just mention it because it took me a bit to find it, but if you Google chef John's blog you'll find the recipe for the compound butter.   I've brined turkeys before and they didn't come out this good.

I wasn't strong enough to separate the skin from the bird, so I just rubbed the butter all over the outside. Still came out absolutely perfect. Even the stuffing, which I cooked inside the bird, came out delicious. My first time ever cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving and everyone thought I was a pro.

Just like John said...I was too afraid to cook a turkey, I was chicken! I have now cooked this at least 5 times and it is outstanding! Don't even bother reading any other recipes, this is the one. 

Several times I have stuffed my turkey with stuffing while following this recipe and it still comes out flawless. Chef John is the best! Happy Holidays!

Fantastic! This was my first roast turkey and it came out amazing. Like all recipes I tweaked a bit to suit my tastes, but it was so moist and flavorful. I am on a low sodium diet, so I cut down on some of the salt, but it was still fantastic. My wife said it was the best turkey she's ever had.

Here's another thumbs up for this recipe and Chef John! This was very easy and the turkey was perfect, very moist and great flavors.  Slow roasting is the key - and butter, of course - lots of butter. The foil shield for the first couple of hours was also a big help. Thank you!

This was my first turkey EVER and it was so very moist and delicious. I don't usually like turkey and avoided making it for years and years (purchased, did other forms of poultry, skipped the holiday table and went to the beach). But, when my in-laws decided that my house was the house, I turned to Chef John and we delivered! I never used so much butter in my life - but it make the difference. Thanks!

The turkey was very easy and very good. I did not have the fresh sage and rosemary, so I did not use it. I also used half the salt and did not put the butter under the breast skin. I placed it in my roasting pan and took the lid off an hour before it was done. It turned out beautifully! I did not make the gravy, but used the drippings for soup stock. However, I am sure it would have been as delicious as the turkey. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Magnifique and as easy as can be! Moist & flavorful. I also made the gravy. My kids that don't eat anything ( serious) had like five servings. Thanks you Chef John. I also made your perfect mashed potatoes to serve our turkey.

This was my first time cooking a turkey. I followed the directions exactly as recipe called for and it came out perfect!  So juicy and flavorful. Love the video instructions too, huge help for a novice like myself.

Winner, winner turkey dinner!!!!!  This was soooo easy and came out perfect.  The meat fell off the bones and was so moist and flavorful.  I always thought turkey was like pizza: there's really no such thing as "bad" turkey, as it's easy enough to camouflage any shortcomings with gravy and sides.  But with this recipe I'll never suffer a mediocre bird again. I cut back on the celery and carrots so I could include a huge Fuji apple, thickly sliced.  Also, as I've had some issues with turkeys cooking fully the past few years, I cooked mine at 425 for 30 minutes then reduced to 335 for the remaining 3 hours for a 14# bird (I looked at a lot of recipes/tutorials and about half suggested roasting at 350 vs. 325, so I split the difference). I didn't make the gravy, but dumped everything left in the roaster pan into my stockpot with the turkey carcass to boil down for stock. Definitely give this one a try - even if you don't have fresh herbs for the cavity it won't disappoint!!!

Great recipe to follow for our second baked turkey. Didn't add the vegetables to the inside of the turkey, just the spices. Otherwise baked the turkey as directed. 

For the gravy, we didn't follow the directions at all, just the ingredients (minus basalmic vinegar). We ended up needing a lot more flour than stated to thicken it up.

This was my 1st turkey ever! Thank you Chef John it was a huge hit everyone was doubting I can do it I was being a chicken haha (inside video joke) but you made it easy and gave the confidence BUT I had major fail with the gravy my Butter ball turkey didn't drip a lot of fat so I sent my sister in law to buy can gravy and used the broth from the neck and heart that I had boiling and added it to my turkey. It came out moist and delicious.  Oh I added the new a back in to the turkey my mom was happy about that :)

This recipe is super easy to follow...great for a novice or an experienced cook. The fresh herbs smelled so wonderful and the turkey was delicious. I also used the "under the skin" butter. Yummy!

I used this recipe last year for my first time hosting Thanksgiving and making a turkey. I couldn't believe how easy this recipe was for the juicy and delicious turkey it produced! This will be my go-to recipe every year moving forward!

Did everything except I like stuffing in my turkey and I use slivers of my garlic cloves poked into the meat.  The butter under the skin trick was wonderful!!

This was my first time making a turkey and it turned out amazing! The flavor was so good and it turned out a nice golden brown and was so incredibly tender and juicy. This will be my go to for any turkey.

I used Chef John's roast turkey receipe for Thanksgiving and it was very easy to do.  The turkey came out perfectly roasted, very moist, with a delicious crispy skin.  My family RAVED about this turkey and ate the whole thing!  The only bad thing about this; no left overs!

I really liked how my turkey turned out, very moist and delicious! I used minced garlic and mix of herbs for the butter and it was yummy! I am no longer intimidated by turkey, thanks Chef John!
