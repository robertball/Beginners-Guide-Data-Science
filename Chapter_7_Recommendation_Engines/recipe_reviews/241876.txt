I thought this recipe turned out really well. I have been looking for recipes to use this PB2 I bought. I originally bought it for peanut butter smoothies, but found they also used it in commercial baked goods to up the peanut butter flavor without the greasiness. I followed the recipe exactly only subbing Jiff Whipped peanut butter for regular. I lined my square baking pan with heavy duty foil and sprayed it well with Bakers Joy. It lifted out of the pan and cut into such nice perfect squares. Using the slightly lower calorie Jiff PB Whipped peanut butter and cutting it into 16 pieces, instead of 12, the calories count equaled 165 calories per brownies.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 pan.  Didn't seem quite done at 25 minutes so left for 5 more.  27 would probably have been perfection.  Glazed with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze.  Wonderful brownies- I've found that I like the effect that the PB powder has on the texture of the product as well as the taste.   A keeper!!

Absolutely awesome!!!!  The first batch I made, I put recommended amount of chips and I loved it!!  My wife requested more chips (she loves chocolate) so increased amount and I have since made this delightful dish about 12 times. Passed them out to my friends and family and they were all blown away. They would have never have imagined that I took up baking. Hahaha.

I doubled this recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan using the convection setting on my oven which requires a reduction of 25 degrees.  I made no changes.  I baked for 27 minutes - the last 2 minutes on the top shelf.  I was initially disappointed because the edge row was a bit dry, but discovered that the next row was quite a bit moister.  Flavor is great.

This turned out really well, family liked it.  Instead of dark chocolate chips (didn't have any), we used 1/4 C white chocolate chips and 1/4 C peanut butter chips.

These were so good! The texture was really smooth and the peanut butter flavor was very prevalent! My family loved these!
