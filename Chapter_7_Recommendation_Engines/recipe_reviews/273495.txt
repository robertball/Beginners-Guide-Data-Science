After 25 years of marriage, I have finally found a recipe that my hubby LOVES!  Since it is difficult to eat the whole thing in one sitting, I divide it up into 3 Corelle 28oz pasta bowls.  Though these are not rated for the 400 degree temp in the recipe, since the cooking time is so short, I have not had any issues in baking the pudding in them.  The wonderful thing about these bowls is that I have the lids that go on them.  This way, we can eat them over several nights without the bananas going bad. I also have used 1/2 t of banana flavoring in place of the liquor.

I added more wafers and substituted the banana liqueur with banana extract.

Made this using pieces of home made rum cake I had in my freezer a month after easter,  instead of  the vanilla wafers.   Everyone loved it.   I actually don't care for the traditional banana pudding made with purchased wafers, so I wouldn't make it that way.   But was looking for a way to use up that rum cake and when looking for a way to use leftover cake of any kind where there's not enough to go around, this will be my go-to.

absolutely delicious. I couldn't find the vannilla wafers in our grocery store here in switzerland so i used the biscuits for Tiramisu and that was very nice. Soaked up the custard and very soft.

The pie had a very good flavor but I should have read the other reviews because it was way too sweet, 2/3 cup would have been enough sugar.

The first time I made it I didn't have enough pudding to cover everything in the baking pan I was using, so I added a fifth egg and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly, except for the bananas themselves.  For my taste it gets a little too banana-heavy as written here, so I go heavier on the wafers, and I also substituted Bailey's successfully for the banana liqueur.  Great easy dessert!

I loved it! If you make a 9 by 13, double the recipie. This way, you have a layer of pudding on bottom then in the middle, with a little on top. :) I did 5 bananas also instead of 3.

My husband likes the home made banana pudding. This was the first time I made it from scratch. I looked at several recipes before I tried this one. Some people Thought the 1/2 cup of sugar was too much but most recipes called for  up to 1 1/2 cups of sugar. Most of the ones I have eaten are too sweet. I thought this one was good.  I didn't have the banana liqueur. Used whole eggs, because we don't like the meringue I didn't need the egg whites. Used reg.  size wafers. The only complaint was it wasn't  enough for my size of bowl. I should have doubled it

Works great in an 8x8 pan.  Didn't have have any vanilla wafers, so I used graham crackers instead.  Still delicious!

I double batched it for my larger family. I thought it was way too sweet and way too much work for the final results.  And I even added less sugar
