This is very good!  I was given two angel food cakes and needed a way to use them other than a desert.  I made two batches and will freeze some.  This stuff is addictive!  LOL!

This is my daughter's recipe. She uses a 13x9x2" cake pan to make the cake, but the 10" tube pan will work fine. Anything smaller the cake will overflow - so be careful. You can also buy a pre-made angel food cake for this. We haven't tried that yet because we are afraid it might make it too sweet.
