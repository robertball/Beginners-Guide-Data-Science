Absolutely fabulous, my family raved!  The only changes I made were marinating all day and adding lime zest and a little black pepper.  Served with beans, Spanish rice, and tortillas.

Wonderful taste! I followed the recipe and marinated the chicken for 3 hours. Don’t be afraid of the intense chili powder. The flavor doesn’t overpower. Great blend. Perfect amount of salt. Definitely will make again!

I have to agree with the first review,  this was delicious.  I  let sit in marinade for 4 hours then cooked on grill with apple wood chips.  Served with flour tortillas and toppings.  Also served Spanish rice and black beans like first review  suggested, it really complimented the chicken. If you don't have ancho chili powder substitute chili powder with red pepper flakes,  just add as much heat as you can stand. Highly recommend this recipe.

We thought it was great. I made it pretty close to the recipe. I did chop up one serrano chili since I wasn't sure I could find the Ancho powder. Also, I used chicken tenderloins (2 1/2 lbs) 

My husband cooked it on the grill, was eating some on the way into the house. I can see using leftovers in tacos or spicy mac and cheese.

I made this, skeptical because I don't tend to like lime in well anything. I was absolutely blown away and am now addicted to this recipe. I made a few tweaks here and there including, substituting minced jalapeno and Serrano peppers for the ancho chili powder. (I was unable to find it at my local grocery store)  sauteing the chicken instead of baking it. ( just a personal preference) and I served it over Knorr Selects Rustic Mexican Rice and Beans. This dish all together. TO. DIE. FOR. 10/10 recommend you trying this at home.

This was okay. Made it just as the recipe states. No complaints, but no ah ha's.
