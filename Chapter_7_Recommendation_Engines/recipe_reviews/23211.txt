Mouth-watering!!  This is a truly excellent recipe.  I added garlic and lemon juice to the melted butter and sprinkled on Old Bay before wrapping the scallops.  I grilled them in a grill basket rather than bothering with toothpicks or skewers.  We devoured these!!!

I love recipes that can be prepared ahead, are quick and easy, and so good.  I made these ahead, refrigerated them and threw them on the grill as an appetizer.  I reduced about one cup of heavy cream, 2 Tablespoons maple syrup, and 1 heaping Tablespoon dijon mustard and served as a sauce on the side (use caution, I didn't measure, so this is a guess). Fabulous!

Delicious and rich.  Boyfriend said they were the best scallops he ever had.  I put three wrapped scallops on two skewers and served on pasta.

Very good recipe.  The suggestion about the frozen scallops was great.  I found them (not the same brand, but large size scallops) in my grocery store, no problem.  I was tempted to use bacon instead of prosciutto, but that would not have been as good.  The bacon would have over powered the scallop.  Then I marinated the scallops in bottled italian salad dressing for about a half hour.  I was worred about them sticking to the grill, so I put the marinated, prosciutto wrapped scallops on metal skewers and then put the skewers on a special shish kabob metal holder that lays on the top of the grill surface.  This keeps the skewer off of the grill surface.  I continued to baste them during the cooking time with the salad dressing.  I grilled them for about 20 minutes.  (the scallops were large and partially frozen) They were GREAT, very light actually.  I can understand why some reviewers felt they were a little on the salty side, but that is the taste of the prosciutto.  I did not feel the taste as over powering.  I served them with saffron rice that I had made previously and frozen (from this site) and it was a great easy summer meal. This would also make a great company dish or last minute meal as one reviewer suggested. Thanks for the recipe and thanks for the suggestions.

The prosciutto definitely makes the recipe. The tastes blended especially well, and the texture was really good too. We decided to use garlic butter for variation, and found it even better!!

These were FABULOUS!  I purchased the Prosciutto and large scallops (size of a silver dollar) from Trader Joe's.  The scallops were in the frozen foods section.  This makes an elegant, quick and easy dinner for entertaining.  You can keep the frozen scallops on hand in the freezer, and the Prosciutto lasts months in the refrigerator.  The Prosciutto is salty, so I will baste with Olive Oil the next time I make it.    I served it on a bed of pasta, with steamed asparagus on the side.  My husband LOVED this dish!

Not the best I have ever had nor made. Kind of difficult and time consuming, plus extremely salty tasting. I would not reccommend for people like me who are not big salt fans.

Just as good as I knew they would be.  I used bacon as we prefer its flavor over prosciutto.

These were excellent and really easy to make.  Forgot to soak the toothpicks so the ends burned to a crisp on the grill but other than that, everything was perfect.  I served them with horseradish sauce kind of following the idea of shrimp lejon and it was surprisingly good!

My husband made a similar dish for me for Mother's Day.  His recipe, however, called for a sage leaf between the scallop and prosciutto.  It was outstanding!  The only change we would have made is to add another sage leaf on the other side of the scallop as well.

I really enjoyed these.  I purchased prosciutto already sliced and packaged and trimmed off the excess fat from the sides.  I cut each slice down lengthwise so I had two pieces from each slice.  I wrapped it around the sides of each scallop, skewered with a toothpick and grilled the top and bottom of each scallop.  Eat immediately while still hot.

Um um!  Made them several hours in advance, splashed some garlic butter on them, and threw them in the fridge.  Served them over a bed of Angel Hair Pasta and the guests devoured them.  There was not one scallop left!  Thanks!

Awesome recipe. Using Prosciutto instead of bacon is brilliant. I didn't oil grill but put garlic butter on both sides. Will never use bacon again.

I've been looking for a good recipe for BBQ'd scallops and this is the best ever!!  The prociutto makes the recipe!  I brushed some melted butter with lemon and crushed garlic for flavour...we loved them.  This is definitely a keeper!!!  Oh and I did sprinkle the Old Bay Seasoning on them before I put them on the skewers!  Excellent!!!

I  have never grilled scallops before, but this is one of my new favorite recipes. . . so delicious! Before wrapping, I sprayed the scallops with butter, and sprinkled with a little lemon juice and Old Bay seasoning. After wrapping, rathering than using toothpicks, I put several on wooden skewers (soaked with water), then put them in a flexible grill basket for easy flipping. I didn't remember to baste during the grilling, but it didn't need it. I served these to 7 adults and 3 kids (including someone who'd never had scallops before), and every single person wanted more. Thanks for the great recipe!

I could not believe how good this came out.  The only thing I did was give the scallops a sprinkle of 'Old Bay' right before they were done.  I based a few extra times as well.  The saltiness of the food was perfect.  Don't waiver from this recipe and you'll be set for some good eating.  Good job.

To preface this review, I should say that I didn't use the butter and I didn't cook these on a grill, but in a skillet. I'd been pretty excited about these, but honestly, I wasn't the biggest fan of the real thing. They came out a little too salty (and I did use extra lean prosciutto), and it was very difficult to gauge whether they were done. They oozed a little water. I'm sure this would be better on a grill...

Very nice change of pace. I usually use bacon but this recipe is better. Not as fatty and I brushed a little teriyaki at the last minute. Make sure you use the Jumbo size scallops (about 1-3/4" - 2" diameter) or you need to adjust your cooking time. DO NOT overcook them and you will have no complaints.

Very good. I did not wrap the prosciutto around the edges because it did not want to stay. So I wrapped around the entire scallops.

These were amazing!  I mistakenly wrapped the scallops twice with proscuitto and that made it too salty.  Next time I will only wrap them once around.  I think putting them over noodles and alfredo would be amazing!!!

I've never had scallops wrapped in proscuitto before.  Let me tell you, these were absolutely the best scallops I've ever had! I used Boarshead proscuitto, sliced paper thin.  (I agree with other reviewers that you should use the best quality proscuitto available to cut down on the saltiness.) My husband grilled these on a cast iron griddle, about 5 minutes per side.   Pure perfection!

I used the sauce recipe cookin'mama posted in her review & I copied BJMULLANEY & added a sage leaf just beacsue I had some in the fridge. With these flavor additions, the scallops didn't need much butter so we only basted them  once & we didn't use much, to lessen the flare-ups. I "shmeared" some of the sauce (fantastic recipe, cookin'mama...thanks for sharing!) on the plate & garnished w/a couple of sage leaves. Served  Figs and Toasted Almonds Brie (from allrecipes) as an appy then the scallops & a huge salad. It was a wonderful dinner that was a snap to put on the table. Making the salad was the hardest part! LOL Thansk for the recipe Donna Francis, we enjoyed it!

Next time I'll use thinly sliced bacon instead of the prosciutto due to the cost.  In this recipe you wouldn't notice the difference.

These were absolutely delicious. I normally don't care for scallops that much, but the prosciutto adds so much flavor, I couldn't stop eating them. We also used olive oil instead of buter as suggested in a prebious review. Delicious!!!!!

Fantastic!  Wouldn't change a thing.  I grilled five minutes per side, I think 8 would be too long.  Better to be underdone than overdone.  Thank you!!  Delicious!!

Really good!  Very hard, though.  Didn't have proscuitto, so used bacon instead.  Was hard to wrap around the scallops.  But... after grilling the flavor was amazing!!!  Will definitely try this again!

This was good, but way too rich for me to eat as a main meal.  One thing I did to save on time was to skewer the scallops as shish kabobs.  I would probably make again as an appetizer.

While it was delish, the prosciutto was a little overwhelming. Would make them again but cut back on the pork.

Awesome!  Like another reviewer I used soaked skewers and put four scallops on each.  They were great with the salsa from the Seared Scallops with Tropical Salsa recipe on this site.

These were delicious.  Thought I would have enough, but ran out.  I read other reviews before preparing and here is what I did.  I used unsalted butter with dill and parsley.  Also, I used Boar's Head prosciutto.  The cheaper versions of prosciutto will be much saltier.  Buy a good quality prosciutto.  I too skewered the scallops instead of using toothpicks.

Super easy! Great taste! I put the scallops on skewers instead of using toothpicks and I made the wasabi sauce from the recipe seared tuna with wasabi-butter sauce from this site for dipping. The scallops turned out wonderfully and the left overs were even better the next day. I love it when something so simple is so yummy.

Made these this summer.  They were wonderful!  So easy, and yet elegant enough for company.  We made them according to recipe, only brushed them with plain olive oil.  Used large fresh sea scallops.

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it just didn't do it for us. I used the sage leaves, but the prosciuto was still overpoweringly salty. (And we're a salt-loving family!)

I'll have to try again with a different type and see if that improves it.

Awesome!  I made these tonight as part of a seafood "fest" for me and my bf.  We both loved them.  After reading the reviews I might make them again with some sage or garlic butter... or maybe even sage garlic butter.... mmm yummy.

This was WAY too salty.  I might try again using only half a slice, but not sure that would make enough difference.  Also used garlic butter instead of plain and thought that made it better...I think if I tried this again I would try those thin-sliced already cooked bacon strips (in the refrigerated lunch meat section) and see if that worked better.

Followed as suggested and found it to be lacking flavor.  Also very salty for my family.

My fiancee and I like these a lot! Made them twice. I used  pre packaged prosciutto from the deli. I used sone with less fat marble the 2nd time and it held up better. I also used a grill basket because they disintegrated off the skewers. I serve with Brussel sprouts and jasmine rice. Perfect.
