I did not have frozen hash brown potatoes, so I chose to use a russet potato which I peeled and sliced on my mandolin with the julienne plate. I saut√©ed the onion, added the water, corn potatoes, salt, pepper and some milk. I made a slurry out of the flour and the remaining milk which I later added to the chowder. After adding the slurry to the chowder and letting it incorporate I tasted the chowder and it was bland.

I decided to add a 1/2 tsp each onion powder and garlic powder, plus 1/8 tsp dried chives. This improved and gave it some flavor. It still lacked the depth I wanted so I added 3 ounces cream cheese and 1/3 cup grated sharp cheddar. Yes my changes don't reflect the recipe as originally posted, but they were an improvement to an otherwise 2 star recipe.

I love pepper, but this soup had too much.  No one could eat it especially my kids.  If I ever make it again, I would adjust the amount of pepper.

I did not make any changes, but it was really good. I might try to add some bacon next time.

My kids really loved this recipe.  I did use 2 fresh potatoes instead of hash browns because I always have a lot of potatoes around.  Just boil them a little bit before you start.  Also I used onion power, which eliminated the need for butter.  Plus you can drain the potatoes and use the same saucepan that way.

I didn't have frozen corn or frozen hash brown potatoes so instead I used a number 10 can of corn and shredded my own potatoes,
I also will have to add some different seasonings.

I used fresh diced potatoes instead of frozen hashbrown. I boiled them for 5 minutes then I followed the recipe. It was easy to do and it was delicious!!

Easy, quick and flavorful.  I added some paprika and garnished with parsley.  I'll be making this recipe often.
