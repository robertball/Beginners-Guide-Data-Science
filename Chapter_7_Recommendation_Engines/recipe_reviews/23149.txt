Loved it! It was very good. I made per instructions this time, but may substitute the corn syrup for molasses next time. For those who said the filling never set- this is a custard pie, like pumpkin or pecan, bake until the filling is set except for a little jiggle in the middle. You will probably need to cover the crust with tin foil to keep it from burning.

Tasty but did not set.  I may have underbaked, but the crust was brown, and filling was quite liquid (syrupy).  After sitting overnight it would come out in a nice slice without leaking, but there was still a huge puddle of filling in the pie dish.  It is like a peanut butter version of shoo fly pie - the peanut butter taste is there so you won't be disappointed, but people who don't like peanuts might enjoy it too.  The only really awkward thing is the solid peanuts...they taste nice and texture etc., but you cannot cut the pie nicely because the nuts get in the way of making even slices and the top (which gets hard as the pie bakes) gets all cracked and uneven when you slice.  So...it tastes good and looks bad?  I would make it again, but not to serve to company.

I wanted to use the 8 Keebler mini graham cracker shells I had on hand for this. After reading some reviews complaining about the pies being runny, I changed the ingredients to: 1/2 cup Splenda; 1/2 cup corn syrup - only had light on hand, so used it; 1/2 cup extra crunchy peanut butter; 2 eggs; 1 tsp vanilla; and the rest of the peanuts I had on hand.  As both the peanut butter and the nuts were salted, I omitted the salt.  They were cooked to perfection in about 35 minutes (probably because of the smaller crusts).  The recipe thus became almost exactly my pecan tart recipe, minus the butter and pecans and plus the peanut butter and peanuts! Thanks for sharing this idea.

Oh good, someone else knows the *right* way to make peanut butter pie! Nearly identical to how my grandmother always made it back in Texas. Excellent recipe.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  And I don't even like Peanut Butter!  We made it for Thanksgiving dinner and the kids went nuts over it - I had to make another!  This time I tried it without the peanuts and it was still delicious!  Definitely will settle any sweet tooth!  I recommend a nice glass of milk with it - Yum!

This did not set at all. It was very thick liquid like. I mean it tasted great. Had it set, I would've probably given it 5 stars but since I made it twice and both times it wouldn't set, I gave it 3 stars. Sorry :(

I Made homemade pie crust, because, I live in the south, I went to the corner and bought some boiled peanuts, to avoid what others said about the peanuts getting in the way.  cooked in the middle of the oven, and it turned out wonderful! yummy. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Wow, this was easy and good.  I used light corn syrup + a little molasses instead of the dark syrup.  I think the whole peanuts are fine, I used a serrated knife and sawed through them, and the slices cut nicely.

This wasn't what I was expecting. It reminded me more of a pecan pie only this had peanuts. It is very good with some whipped cream but it is also very sweet.

Tastes more like peanut brittle pie than a chiffon peanut butter pie.  Very rich.

Seeing how the reviews were split--I wanted to give this a try. It was good enough that I am glad I did, but not good enough to make it again.
It does take a long time to cook--to the point that it could overcook the pie shell. The next day it does taste really good, but its too finicky to be worth it to make again.

If you do choose to make it, try making it in cupcake tins with a graham cracker crust. Only fill the tins halfway and then they should come out for you. Another way that might be good is to make it, scrape it out of the pie shell and mix the pieces into another dish like a chocolate bread or something to that effect. 

Good luck, but I wont be making this again.

Great recipe but needs a little tweaking!  Got this recipe from a fellow at the fish camp who made one of these pies at least once a week. 
I just made it and it is NOT runny.  I baked it for only 40 minutes as I can remember how his pies looked and they were not overly brown on top. He does let his sit a couple of hours before cutting.  For those of you who tried it and gave up on it, TRY IT ONE MORE TIME!!!

In spite of the reviews saying this pie didn't set up, I thought I'd give it a shot.  I got the same results. My crust got very brown, but the filling was quite runny, and didn't even set up when I chilled it. Why doesn't this recipe work? What's the secret? I have had peanut butter pie, and just loved it. But it sure wasn't runny. More like a pumpkin pie texture?
