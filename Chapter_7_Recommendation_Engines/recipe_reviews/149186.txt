I am preparing this just to serve as a side for a hot dog grill party, I was wondering if I still need to heat it for 30 minutes even though I'm not canning it, or if it will be fine to just serve it?

This is a nice recipe.  I followed it to pickle my end-of-season peppers from my garden.  I used mostly cherry peppers, Anaheim and jalape√±o peppers, mixed in with some red bell pepper, finger carrots and lots of onions. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!!  Everyone loved it.  I used a homemade pickling spice recipe that I had.  I added it to allrecipes just in case anyone else was interested.

I was happy with the results but wondered if the pickling spices will soften up or if they should have gone into a cheese clothe bag & removed after cooking?  Also this recipe doubled makes 7 pint jars.

I made this recipe and after sampling it wished I had only put 2 T of pickling spice in it.  Way too much corriander seed, so it overwhelmed the star of the recipe...peppers and onions!  To save the relish I added 3 cups of diced cherry tomatoes.   For a great dip, mix the altered relish with cream cheese and serve with crackers or tortilla chips.

Made this wonderful relish yesterday from garden grown peppers and it came out fantastic! After canning, we had a little extra left over so we fired up the grill and made some burgers and put the relish on them and YUMMM! I added 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar. Thanks for a great recipe! rs

This was a good recipe.  Recipe yielded less for me than stated, but that wasn't a problem.  As well, you need to add a lot of hot peppers if you want to spice it up.  I added 6 jalapeno peppers, and couldn't even taste them.   I like things spicy, so if I make it again, I might try replacing all the bell peppers with jalapeno's.

We use it on every burger and dog this summer so far, and will have to make more soon!

We had so many peppers during the summer I knew we needed a quick but tastey use for them. We've used this relish on hot dogs, mixed it into muffuletta spread, stuffed into portabellas , adds great flavor to cream cheese when using for a dip.

First off, this is a good recipe that you can modify to your own tastes.
  
The reason I gave it a 1 star is to call attention to the fact that the recipe specifies "canning jars" and then specifies 30 minutes of "simmering".  Pints require a different canning time than quarts. Also, you do not "simmer" but rather boil at as high a rate as you can without emptying the pot. Also, no reminder for altitude adjustment. These are important safety issues in any canning recipe. If you have any questions about this, just Google "Canning" and there's a mountain of information for you to review.

Flavor was decent but somehow I expected something different - perhaps with tomatoes it would be better.  In addition to that the pickling spice that I used was very hard and did not soften after being canned for almost a year now.  Probably won't make again.

I bought too many bell peppers and needed a recipe to use them up.I made this today and just tried it on a German sausage in a soft roll fantastic!!!! I added just 3 slices of jalapeno peppers from a jar to jazz it up and cut the pickle spic to 3T. I will be making this with my own peppers from the garden this summer!!!!!

How does the relish turn red without any red ingredients?  I might try the recipe but hesitant to since I think something red is missing - red peppers or tomatoes maybe .
