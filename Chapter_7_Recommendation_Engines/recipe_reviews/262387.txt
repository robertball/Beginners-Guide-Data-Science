given amount of water will give you a swampy mess. try and fix it with more flour and it crumbles to pieces. given gluten free flour is never easy to work with, this didn't turn out at all

Thank you sharing this recipe.  We took the advice of another reviewer and reduced the water quantity to 3/4 cup.  In doing so the mixture was still to wet.  We added more flour to enable us to work the dough into a ball shape prior to rest for 30 minutes.

We will make a few changes next time:  reduce the water content to 1/2 cup or increase the flour quantity to 2 1/4 cup.  Stay tuned

My grandkids have several food allergies (gluten, eggs, dairy, wheat, just to name a few) so I tried this GF recipe & I must say
I am happy I did. I am giving the recipe 4 stars because of the flavor and texture of the dough. It really is very good and I will be making it again so thank you for sharing it with all of us. I did however need to add flour to the dough since it did not reach a very soft dough ball without it.
Since I needed it to be GF & dairy free, I could not use cheese so in place of cheese we make a white sauce with coconut oil, GF flour mixture, unsweetened almond milk & then use nutritional yeast & spices to season it. It really is quite good and I used that in place of the tomato sauce for this pizza. I then added spinach, broccoli, onion, garlic, red bell pepper. It was gobbled up in minutes!! Thank you again for your recipe.

This pizza delivers! I’ve been longing for a good gluten free pizza. I found it. I was concerned about the amount of water and oil. I added the honey and yeast to 3/4 cup of water afraid that my flour mix didn’t need a whole cup of liquid. In fact, I never needed the other 1/4 cup. I reluctantly added two tbsp of oil, but am happy with the results. I used fresh zucchini and cayenne peppers instead of heirloom tomatoes. Thank you for the recipe.
