Hi, this is my recipe.  Can't believe it is finally posted here after all this time.  Thank you for the positive reviews.  I have to agree with the comments about the cooking times.  I let it saute 3-4 mins. after adding the tomato.  Also, don't know where the crimini came from, I usually use baby bella or white button.  Also, I read another review commenting of being bland and the chicken being dry.  I have to say after making this so many times that the taste of the marinade is goiing to determine the taste of this dish so be sure to use a good vinegar and I think 1/4 cup of water is too much, the recipe was posted with 2 tablespoons of water.  Quality of the chicken will determine if it is dry.

This is a good jumping off recipe for an easy skillet meal. 4 stars from Sparky and three stars from me. There was a slight lack of flavor overall to us. I might marinate the chicken all day or even 24 hours to see if that jazzed up the chicken. The other problem I had was that it was too long of a cooking time for the chicken breast cubes (maybe 15 minutes total cooking time instead) and they were very dry.(I should have known better) I would sub wine for the water in the future and I would definitely add more seasonings and fresh garlic. We tried it with three different cheeses on top and our favorite was fresh mozzarella. Overall, an easy and healthy meal served with a salad and crusty bread. Thanks for sharing.

Well, this is wonderful stuff.  I did mix up my own herbs combined with oil and vinegar as I wanted to see if it worked with less salt and sugar and it does work just fine.  This recipe is my new favorite as a "go to" as I usually have rice cooked and in the freezer.

I have fixed this and it was delicous; have e-mailed the recipe to my daughters and friends.  We used it on white rice and the flavor was great. Couldn't find crimini mushrooms, so used small portabello's.  Feel sure you will enjoy.

I marinated the chicken in the Italian dressing mixture all afternoon. The cooking time for the chicken is off in this recipe so I just made sure I cooked it until done. We found this dish very flavorful with the extra marinating time and the only thing we didn't really care for was the added tomato. One plus with this recipe is you can put your own favorite cheese on it.

Diane your chicken dish recipe is delicious. My family loved it, even my 15 yr old daughter who is a very finicky eater love this dish. I served it over angel spaghetti noodles.  Thank you.

I was looking for a healthier version of "italian dressing packet + cream cheese", which I love.  This is simple, healthy and yummy! I used drained, canned diced tomatoes.
