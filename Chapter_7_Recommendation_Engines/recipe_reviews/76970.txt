My husband loves horseradish so I decided to try this simple recipe. I've tried it with both beef tenderloin and with tuna steaks with unfortunate results both times. It also isn't the most appetizing looking sauce. I will not make this again.

Prepared it for our Christmas dinner to accompany the prime rib roast. It was one of the big hits of the meal. None of it was left for the leftover roast! I found it easy to make.
