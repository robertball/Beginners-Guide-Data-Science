Not a mac and cheese fan and never have been but I am a huge fan of the buffalo flavor and decided to give this a try. Excellent! I was very much impressed and so was the hubby. I did use chicken breast instead of the dark meat out of personal preference. The only other change I made was that I substituted pepperjack for the Monterey jack because I already had it on hand and knew we'd like that extra punch of heat.  I typically don't have much luck with melting cheese and fully expected some clumping but there wasn't any. The ingredient amounts and the directions are spot on.  You have changed my opinion on mac and cheese Matt R. and I thank you for that!

Great dish! We doubled it and took it to a BBQ. We were a little shocked  that it took center stage over everything our friends had prepared for their party. They wanted the recipe so I referred them to this page. This recipe needs no adjusting, and is perfect.

Anything "Buffalo" catches my attention. This recipe was excellent.  My family aren't big blue cheese fans so I substituted a half cup of blue cheese dressing. I also put the ingredients in a 9 by 11 pan, sprinkled with Italian bread crumbs and sprayed with cooking spray to crisp it up. I baked it for about half an hour at 325. Absolutely delicious. Great quantity. I have a husband and three grown sons. Lots for dinner and plenty for leftovers

Love love love this stuff!  This recipe is very easy to make and tastes delicious!    I followed the recipe exactly as stated - except that I used penne noodles instead of elbow macaroni - and it turned out perfect!  If you like buffalo chicken flavor you will love this Mac and cheese!

Big hit in our house. Mostly followed the recipe. Did add more of the rotisserie chicken. 2 stalks of finely chopped celery. And used 1/4 cup of gorgonzolla cheese.  Mixed up 1 cup of Panko with melted butter sprinkled on top then browned in the oven. Nice touch. Made 12 big servings. Just the right amount of heat with 1/2 cup of Franks Hot Sauce. Will definitely make this again.

I made this tonight and it was delicious. A little sharp bite but not too hot. Give the milk patience to thicken- took me about 8 minutes with constant stirring.  I added breadcrumbs to the top and baked for 25 minute at 350.  I wonder if it would make the chicken stand out better to saute the chicken in the hot sauce before combining all the ingredients?

Pretty good!  I made half the recipe and decreased the butter to 1 1/2 tbsp.  I used skim milk.  Still very rich.  I'd make it again.

This is such a wonderful concept. I really wanted to like it, but I just didn't care for it. The sauce is more of a cheesy cream sauce and in my opinion doesn't have enough of that cheese flavor to be mac and cheese. It had kind of a weird texture, too - I couldn't get it to smooth out once I added the cheese. Others might like it, but I won't be making it again.

This was so very good! And you can tell because most of the reviews did not include a paragraph about how they altered the recipe! As is, perfect! What drew me in was the photo - it didn't look like the thick floury texture that most home made recipes have. My own personal preference after it was done, i added some reserved pasta water to thin out the texture. Absolutely perfect! Thank you!

I have my own version...almost identical but I add chopped celery to it right before I pop it in the oven and sprinkle buttered Panko over the top. Even though I haven't made Matt's version, it is so close to mine that I know it's awesome!

Very tasty! I had to sub penne pasta for the macaroni because that's all I had, and I added white & dark chicken, about 1 1/2 cups. I also upped the hot sauce to 3/4 cup and it was not too hot. Yum!

Excellent recipe, delicious macaroni meal, easy to adapt to suit what's handy, and when it says "8 servings", it means *BIG* ones.  :-)

The second time I did this, I didn't have much meat... so to keep the big chicken flavour, I cooked the pasta in chicken stock instead of water.   Not the same texture without as much meat as the recipe calls for, but pretty much exactly the same intensity of "chicken taste".

This is absolutely a 5 star recipe!  My husband, who swears he doesn't like mac'n'cheese , loves this.  He walked around the pot that was on the stove for at least 30 minutes taking a huge bite from the pot each time... I think that made him feel better than eating a large amount at one time.
The recipe couldn't be made any better... Do yourself and your family a favor, make this one... You won't be sorry.

The second time I made this, I started with the full recipe before I realized I only had an 8 ounce box of pasta, so I split the recipe, quickly whipped up some egg whites and made a cheese soufflé alond with the mac-and-cheese.  OMG! Both were over the top.

Thanks!

Amazing!  I put 3 cups instead of 4 cups cheese, used dark and white meat, but otherwise left the rest the same.  This will be my go to mac n cheese from now on.

Just a tip,
Use whole wheat macaroni, 
Don't get mushy and has hard your flavor not to mention it is healthier

My family isn't a huge fan of spicy food, so I only used half of the hot sauce, but everyone loved it - even the picky ones. In fact, my youngest even asked me to make it again!

Surprised the family with this one, and they all liked it a lot. Can be made without the chicken if you don't want it, just add about a half cup or slightly more of pasta. Found it to be slightly salty though, so will look for ways to balance that. Still an amazing dish!

Delicious, creamy mac and cheese.  I used the entire rotisserie chicken.  It was yummy right out of the pot, but I baked it with bread crumbs on top and brought it to a pot luck and it was a big hit.  Great both ways although a bit creamier right out of the pot.  Will make this again and again.

As usual I fiddle with peoples recipes, I live in country Australia and we don't have Monterey Jack cheese,so I used a smoked Gouda and left of the blue cheese and added a little lemon zest. It turned out great, your recipe was an excellent idea and I will make it again in out winter months.

This has replaced my old Mac and Cheese recipe.  It is a "Football Night" favorite.  The only changes I made was I added a few Tablespoons of diced onion as I was browning the "roux", otherwise this recipe is great as it is.  I used canned milk for extra richness.   I've left out the Chicken a few times for a vegetarian side dish.

I had high hopes for this because we love mac n cheese and Buffalo chicken. I think it would have worked if I didn't add the blue cheese, that flavour overwhelmed everything else. I like the basic mac n cheese component of this. Very creamy and smooth.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it were not for my kids. I absolutely loved it. My kids thought it was good but not great. I honestly think they are used to boxed mac n cheese and did not appreciate how good this was. It was so cheesy and just the right amount of spice. So delicious!!!!! Will make it again for sure (even if it is just for me!!!)

The recipe was good, thank you for posting. 
We were tempted to bake this but it was not necessary. We skipped the gorgonzola cheese.

We loved it and will make it again.  We had chicken thighs so I baked 4 of them instead of going out and getting a rotisserie chicken.  It was good as is but after we put it together, I put it in a casserole dish and baked it for 30 minutes.  The extra baking step made it perfect.

Soooo creamy, and there was no flour taste to the sauce. I made it with Swiss and white cheddar, and it was pretty good. Only thing I didn't like is the ratio of macaroni to cheese. A little too much sauce for my liking, other than that it was great!

This is delicious!  Taste just like the kind I've gotten in a restaurant.   Did it exactly like the directions but used blue cheese.  Will make again.

I made it as is except using pepperjack cheese instead of monterey jack. I love the roux, the seasoning, and just the right amount of heat that this recipe needed! Extremely creamy, cheesy, and delicious! Also soooo easy to make!

I’ve made this a few times now, my husband and son love it and ask for it at least once a month. I’ve used chicken they smoked, canned chicken and the recommended rotisserie chicken all with rave reviews!  I thank you very much for the recipe!

Made this as a nice Sunday meal for my family. I used the entire rotisserie chicken and sautéed onions, celery and garlic with the butter before adding the flour. Topped with blue cheese and baked for 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven. 

Very tasty!

This recipe is a keeper.  I used the cheeses I had on hand... English aged cheddar from Costco, Jarlsberg fromCostco and Monteray Jack.  I had a lot of extra sauce so I ended up boiling another cup of noodles, so total of 3 cups of noodles for this recipe.  The sauce wasn't too thick as some others mentioned, but since it will thicken as it cools from the cheese, it did thicken up.  Not a problem for us, we loved it.  Highly recommend this recipe.

My little brother LOVES this, cheese is his favorite food. But instead of chicken I used ground beef, and I skipped the gorgonzola. Still great though.

I made this for a graduation party with some slight modifications. I used 2 boneless chicken breasts that I cut up and pan seared. I also topped with some panko bread crumbs that I browned in butter and Frank's redhot.

This was so delicious. Honestly, next time I think I'll bake it with some cheddar cheese and a little bit of toasted panko on top. It was creamy and tasty like a good mac should be. :)

My son made this while visiting me- he had been wanting to try his first homemade Mac and cheese. I was a bit skeptical because I am not a ‘buffalo style’ girl. This was delicious and SO easy .  I will definitely keep this recipe and can’t wait to try it out for company- it will be a hit!

I usedn twist pasta (Trader Joe brand),  gorgonzola cheese and mostly white meat from a fresh chicken I roasted the prior day. I then put some breadcrumbs sautéed in butter on top and put it in the oven at 350degrees for 20 minutes.  I thought is was delicious!  Definetly a comfort food if you are a fan of buffalo chicken

This is my go-to recipe for buffalo mac and cheese. I usually shred 2 chicken breasts instead of using a rotisserie chicken and skip the gorgonzola. I recently found McCormick's Buffalo Wing seasoning packets that I add to the shredded chicken to give it an extra kick. Add seasoned panko on top for some texture and crunch!

This was absolutely delicious, a comfort food that’s so good I can’t feel guilty having seconds. I did make a couple of changes but I’m sure it’s great the way it is too! I substituted diced chicken breast for rotisserie, half of the shredded cheese for about 6 slices of Land O’ Lakes White American (I love how creamy it makes the sauce!). I also finished it off in the oven at 350 with a Panko bread crumb topping (About a cup Panko to 2 Tblsp melted butter, mixed and spread evenly over the top) for about 15-20 minutes. Broil for a few minutes to brown if needed but don’t overcook! Also I left out the Gorgonzola since no one else in my house cares for it but I’m sure it would be delicious baked on top!

Absolutely delicious! I've made it for my family many times now and it's always a hit! The only changes I've made are decreasing the amount of hot sauce, as my mom has a low spice tolerance, and using less gorgonzola because my brother doesn't like it. I also take out the chicken sometimes if I'm having my vegetarian friend over for dinner, and it's perfect! An amazing dish for everyone, and easy to fit everyone's needs.

Used what I had on hand...subbed 1/2 c. manchego & 1/2 c. mozzarella for the monterey jack, and used 2 cans of diced chicken since I didn't have rotisserie chicken on hand (drained it well and sauteed it in a skillet with some olive oil).  Added one stalk of sliced celery and voila!  It turned out wonderful!!  The sauce was creamy and coated the pasta like an ermine jacket.  It was a huge hit!!

I used almondmilk and baked it for about 20 minutes at 350 with bread crumbs. I prefer mac and cheese to be baked, but tasted good before baking.

This was a nice easy recipe.  However, I made a few changes.  First of all, I used penne pasta.  This was mainly because I like penne pasta, but it also makes this easier to eat with a fork.  I also think the rotisserie chicken idea is just bizarre.  Come on people, use 1 lb. of chicken breast cut into 3/4" cubes and saute separately.   Mix the chicken into the sauce when the sauce is done.  Mix it into the pasta.  Pour the whole thing into a 9x13 casserole dish.  Sprinkle crumbled blue cheese on top (cheaper and easier to find then Gorgonzola).  On top of that sprinkle bread crumbs of your choice.  And on top of that, sprinkle a little shredded cheddar.  Heat in oven on 350 for about 10-12 minutes.  Perfect!

Pretty tasty stuff.  Cheese sauce needs to be heated slowly to keep it from breaking or getting too grainy.  Can also be made with lobster instead of chicken and without the hot sauce and bleu cheese.....delicious!!

This was so delicious. I made it when we had several guests with small children for dinner.  I doubled the pasta and the cheese sauce.  After I mixed half of the pasta with half of the cheeses sauce, I added the Franks, chicken and bleu cheese to the 2nd half.   So we had both regular and buffalo chicken mac and cheese.  It was a big hit.  I used bleu cheese and people who don’t normally like bleu cheese, didn’t taste it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was extremely yummy, I boiled chicken breast halves instead of rotisserie to save groceries and it worked out amazing. I recommend getting a buffalo flavored hot sauce also.

Fantastic!  & instructions were easy to follow.  All I changed from recipe was using siracha instead of hot sauce as that's what I had on hand & adding some salt.  I will def make again, my family loved it!

We made this without the Gorgonzola but offered Blue Cheese and Gorgonzola crumbles for those who like the stronger cheese flavor.  It was a HUGE HIT, with or without the added cheeses. Spice level of the Franks suited everyone. Adding this recipe to the box for sure.

This was delish! My family loved it!  I will definitely make this again.  I followed the recipe very closely, which I rarely do.  I used boneless, skinless thighs cooked on the grill, and cut into bite size pieces.  I also followed a couple of tips from other reviewers.  I used chunky bleu cheese dressing rather than the actual bleu cheese.  I also used about a half cup of pasta cooking water to thin the sauce a bit.  It makes a lot, and is quite filling.  Thanks for this recipe.  Well done!

Very good.  I used 12 buffalo wings bought from the grocery store rather than a full rotisserie chicken.  Next time, two dozen or more.  The kids actually complained it was "too cheesy" but I think it was the blue cheese.  Halve the amount.

This was really good stuff! I used one really big chicken breast, rice flour instead of All Purpose to make the cheese sauce gluten free. I forgot the blue cheese but it wasn't missed. This was devoured by family and will become a repeat in our house!

Great recipe. The gorgonzola adds a great flavor to the profile. I used four chicken thighs rather than a rotisserie chicken. Next time I will add more hot sauce, and I want to try halving the recipe -- eight servings is more than we need.

Rich and creamy. Will definitely save this to make again and again. Two minor changes, pepper jack for the monterey jack and blue cheese for the gorgonzola.

Gorgonzola cheese is a great flavour builder!
We BBQ'd chicken breasts instead of using a roasted chicken.

Family thought it was weird.  Flavor was ok but didn't seem right with all that cheese.

My wife loved it, I thought it turned out pretty good but would cut back on the Gorgonzola the next time. Might add some roasted jalapeno too for more kick

This was wonderful! My 11 year-old son can't get enough buffalo and he loved this! My husband hates mac & cheese and even he loved it! It was easy to put together and makes a lot. I left out the gorgazola cheese- didn't have it on hand and used leftover grilled chicken that I heated up in a saute pan with 1/4 buffalo sauce.  I served it with a caeser salad. Made this for a family of 4 and had plenty left over to eat for lunches this week. Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe is great!!! I made it to bring to a dinner party back in April & the pot was scraped clean. I have also been asked to make it again a couple times. I personally don't use the gorgonzola & subbed in some blue cheese salad dressing.

Because the hubs won't eat anything spicy, I took a recipe that I was making for him and modified it to this one for myself. Bazinga!  Loved this one! Only down size, I ate too much!  Sooo good!

I made this just as a regular mac and cheese after my son asked for it on a Sunday night...the plain mac and cheese  needed more noodles because it was obviously expecting the chicken addition.  The hubby and I loved it, and added roasted cauliflower and broccoli to soak up some of the cheese - and then baked it with bread crumbs,  Yum!  Can't wait to try it with chicken!!  This is the first time I've made mac and cheese on the stove that turned out well, this will be my basic recipe from now on!!  Thanks for posting!!!

Followed the recipe, except added more hot sauce, great flavor, the texture of the sauce was not to my liking, thought it would be creamier. Maybe I did something wrong. Will try it again.

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/245764/buffalo-chicken-mac-and-cheese/ ... 2 6 17 ... Yeah, yeah, yeah, I halved the recipe, didn't add chicken or blue cheese; but the base was exactly as stated. I'm not a mac n cheese fan, but liked that little zip from the hot sauce. I made a recipe adding salsa & liked it better, but got a thumbs up from E, 19, for this one. Huh. :D

I added double the hot sauce, and I wouldn't add quite that much again, LOL. But, I would add a little extra. We really like buffalo sauce! Maybe that helped cover the bleu cheese, because I don't like bleu cheese and I did not think I tasted it in particular at all. My husband recommends it more as a side dish, because it is really heavy.

I made a few adjustments because of ingredients on hand. I used a turkey sausage, taxation and two other cheese blocks I had. Mediterranean Cheddar and Garlic Herb. Fabulous.

This turned out VERY well. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. Unfortunately, it did not give servings. This recipe makes a very large portion- enough for a potluck. I will half it next time.. and there will be a next time. It was delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly...almost. I used old cheddar and blue cheese. The recipe didn't say what type of cheddar to use. It  makes a lot...I found it delicious and even great the next day. Husband wasn't a big fan of the Franks sauce but I wouldn't change anything.

This easily became a family favorite.  Pulled it together when we had a house full of people from out of town.  Well worth the little extra prep time.  I used all the chicken as others did and added a salad.  Very good meal.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this three times now, this last time for my mother, who has stage 4 cancer.  This time I also used Amish Sausage instead of chicken and added a bit more hot sauce and she ate and ate and will be having it for lunch today!  
She loves all foods spicy and she didnt believe me, because I cannot handle spicy like her and my daughter do!  Also, left out the bleu cheese again, stuff is just nasty! LOL!
If you got someone who needs to eat, this is the way to go...less or more hot sauce, depending on the person.
I then added Gluten Free Italian Bread Crumbs and baked for 30 minutes!

The sauce was so easy to make!  And the kids loved it with dinosaur mac.

I hope I knew how to stir the flour into the butter better so that I wouldn't get so many lumps.  I had to drain the milk mix before adding the cheese.

This was so SO good!  I did change it a little - used Dreamfields healthy carb living elbow Mac, added a cup of finely chopped celery and 1/2 cup of finely chopped carrots.  I used 1/3 C of blue cheese (that's all I had), and I poached 2 chicken breasts, shredded them and tossed them with 1 T of Frank's buffalo sauce while I cooked the Mac and made the sauce.  I also used skim milk and decreased the butter to 4T and it was still enough to make a smooth rich cheese sauce.

I made the recipe as directed with two exceptions: I used all of the chicken meat and couldn't add the Gorgonzola or blue cheese because my husband is allergic.  The flavor was great, but the texture of the cheese wasn't smooth enough for me.  It was more stringy and sticky than I expected, which may not have been a problem if I had been able to add the blue cheese.

I chose to start with half the amount of hot sauce, and that was perfect for us. Friends asked for the recipe.

I used Dietz & Watson Buffalo Wing Sauce sliced cheddar cheese bought at BJ's and about 1/2 cup plain shredded cheddar cheese in the milk mixture. I used about 1/8 cup buffalo hot sauce and gluten free brown rice & quinoa rotini. Those noodles turn into a sticky paste if heated in a crockpot.  My Sabbath congregation enjoyed it!

Really good! I used some white meat in with the mixture because it seemed a little low in meat.  Also, I only used half of the hot sauce, but next time I'll use more.
