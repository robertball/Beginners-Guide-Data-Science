I think I'll stick to my regular Indian dishes.  Having only the garam masala--and too much of it at that--made this a little bitter.  I realize this is a light dish, but it still seemed to be missing something.  Maybe basmati rice would help balance things.

This was so easy to make and tasted great!  I cut the chicken into cubes, used about 3 tsp garam masala, used a white onion instead of green onions, and also added peas like other reviewers.  Then I served it over white rice.   Oh, and I also added some extra salt too.   I found a pre-made garam masala spice at my local health food store in the bulk spice section and that is what I used.  This was my first attempt at an Indian inspired dish and was very happy with the results!  Will definitely make again!

Garam Masala is an Indian spice blend, there are several recipes for it on Allrecipes - it's also available commercially.  I used a commercial variety.  Although I don't think this is a very authentic Indian recipe, it' still very tasty.  I think the author could have added that it should be served with basmati rice because it just doesn't make it alone.  I made it just as written (but served it with rice), next time I'll add something to it - maybe green peas would be a good addition.  Hubby gave it a 4 and I agree.  It's a good way to use boneless chicken and is relatively low fat.  I thought it was very, very good, but it's not "the best light chicken dish I ever had".

Agree this is an excellent, simple and quick base alone or to add to.  To enhance: suggest carrots and onions, and to enhance flavor use chicken broth instead of water and add some ginger.  To kick it up, add some red pepper.  The Basmati rice is a must, and cooking in clay pot on 400 for about 45 minutes soaked in the flavors.

I added the peas, as many suggested, and my family - not particularly versed in indian food  ( I was breaking them in easy) - LOVED it. Thanks!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and took the advice of others to add a few peas.  I served it over Jasmin rice and it was so flavorful!  Will definitely make this again.  Very simple to put together, too!

I couldn't find Garam Masala at my grocery store, so ended up using a random Indian spice mix that sounded similar.  Not sure how similar it was to Garam Masala.  I also ended up using fire diced tomato's because that was all that i had it my cupboard. So i am not sure how similar to the original recipe it ended up being!  Regardless, it was very tasty and i will definitely make it again! I would agree with the above reviewer in saying that it would be good with rice as well.

This was good and I followed the advice of the others and added peas as well as carrots with mine. That really bolstered the taste and made it a very hearty dish, along with some long grain white rice.

I'm not going to rate this recipe as high, nor will I rate it as low. As written, it doesn't really work all that well. When I think of garam masala sauces, I think of  a sauce a bit more rich in taste, with garlic, ginger and chilis. This dish, as written lacked those important components to make it truly over the top delicious. I will, however, say that as a base to create from, this recipe is amazing (hence my split 50-50 vote for it). I'd skip the diced tomatoes and use tomato sauce with a healthy pinch of palm sugar and go to town on the garlic, ginger, cumin, tumeric, chili and garam masala. Indian-inspired food should taste truly Indian inspired. The recipe, as written, basically took me on a TV journey to India when I wanted to board a flight and get off in Mumbai. 
I would have liked to have rated this higher, but, it just lacked in flavor, as written...but I wouldn't completely disregard this recipe, either. It's good place to start.
Thank you for submitting it. I did have fun trying it out.

This is a great recipe for something new, fast, and tastey!  I will be making this again.  I paired it with some brown rice that had fresh lime and cilantro. and grilled cauliflower.

Loved it. I messed with the proportions a bit. I used thighs rather than breasts. I added more garam masala and a serrano chili or two. And I roasted the veggies in the coals of the fire. I cooked this dish in in a Lodge cast iron skillet in the fireplace. Yum.

I also decided to cut up the pieces of chicken after I was done because I noticed this is also a really great stew.

This chicken is probably some of the best that I have made in a long time. Great flavor, not spicy, but I love all the spices that go into garam masala. My parents came over to eat, and my dad was surprised that there was cinnamon, which gives it an unexpected flavor to the dish. With this cooking method, the chicken came out very moist and tender so that was perfect. My five year old and two year old loved it, ate their portions AND asked for more! I will be making this recipe again soon. Thank you, breezermom!

I made a few changes. Used fresh garlic and cooked on a low simmer for a couple hours. Added green onions at the very end so they didn't go to mush. Turned out pretty good for such a simple recipe. Good change from my mainly Vietnamese cuisine.

Salt salt salt! That's all I tasted! Cut the salt in half or omit it completely! The salt absolutely ruined this dish.
