These were delicious and easy (if you buy the guac & salsa). It really didn't seem like leftover turkey at all. I do recommend the egg white to keep the tortillas from coming undone. I halved the recipe to make 6 flautas, but one came apart in the cast iron frying pan even after I used the egg white to roll it up.

These are very good.  My turkey was kind of dry, so I mixed the salsa into the filling instead of putting it on top.  That worked well.  I had ZERO luck hooking two tortillas together though, thus the four star rating instead of five.  Once I gave up on that and just made smaller flautas with single tortillas, things went well.

I followed this recipe exactly as stated except I used chicken instead of turkey  and it was absolutely delicious. I didn't have leftover of either, so I just stuck some chicken in the crockpot in the morning to save a step when it was time to make dinner.  It ended up moist and shredded very easily, and when it cooked in the tortillas it lost the "crockpot chicken" taste.  I think the only thing I'd change is to add just a little more cheese.  You could easily add some peppers to give it a little extra kick.   I'm very finicky about leftover poultry, but it was delicious as leftovers too.
