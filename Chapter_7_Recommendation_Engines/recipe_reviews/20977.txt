This was very simple to do.  Like some other reviewers, I added more flavorings.  I doubled the oregano, used a full teaspoon of sugar, minced two garlic cloves, substituted 1/2 tsp. garlic powder for the garlic salt, used 1/4 tsp. dried parsley rather than fresh (didn't have fresh on hand), and added about 1/4 cup (drained) diced tomatoes.  The flavor wasn't quite right once mixed so I put it in the microwave on medium heat for three minutes, stirred, and then let cool slightly.  I served this as the dipping sauce for "Real Italian Calzones" also featured at allrecipes.com.  Both were delicious!

WOW! Is this stuff good! My dear hubby said it was the best pizza I'd ever made (and I make pretty darn good pizza!). I'll never used canned pizza sauce again ... this was so simple to make!

This was pretty good on my Bisquick pizza crust.  I added several dashes of onion salt, and used garlic pepper since I didn't have any garlic salt.  I think I'll try adding some other seasonings, but overall, this recipe is a keeper.

Very simple to prepare; added fresh garlic and seasoning salt instead of using garlic salt. Also added basil and used dried parsley.

We've been using this recipe for over a year, and it's the only pizza sauce recipe for us.  Easy and quick to make and it always tastes fresh.  We use it with "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" recipe on this site.

This is probably one of the easiest best pizza dough recipes I've ever tried.  I use "way easy pizza sauce/bread stick dip" from here and just add my own cheeses and toppings. Everyone in my family loves it when I make pizza now.

I liked it because it's easy. Since we do not like sweet pizzas, I eliminated the sugar, used all fresh ingredients, and added some more fresh garlic and basil. Good recipe for a light sauce if wise amount is used. Thanks Dan, it's great.

Simple it is, but it is very bland.  I ended up using pizza sauce vs. tomato sauce, but it still needed a LOT more additional seasonings.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't disgusting or anything, we have just had better.  Thanks anyway Dan ;)

I was very pressed for time when I decided to make this, and was surprised by the quality of it, considering the minimal amount of work involved.  Very easy and simple, and I'll use this again when I need a quick pizza sauce.

I doubled the recipe so that I could use it for our pizzas tonight. I also made Italian Herb Bread (also from this site) into breadsticks and thought this would also make for a great dipping sauce. Although I did NOT care for this as a dipping sauce, it worked well on our pizzas. Even my guests commented that the "sauce" was very tasty.

This is the base recipe that I've been using for pizza sauce for a while now.

Some tips:
1.  Make it the day before you want to use and let it sit in the refridgerator overnight.  It's much more flavorful that way.
2.  To freeze extras - put in ice cube trays to freeze and place in ziploc bags.  Take out what you want the night before using to thaw in refridgerator.

Easy and inexpensive.  Thanks!
I've used this recipe for quite some time now.  The fresh garlic made the sauce too "intense" for the kids, but I liked it.  
To be "kid-friendly", I upped the sugar a tad bit, used garlic powder, and use jarred spaghetti sauce.  I add a little olive oil to make it easier to spread.  This makes a nice, thick sauce and a little goes a long way.

This was truly "WAY EASY"!  I added a little bit more fresh garlic and some minced fresh cilantro for more impact and it turned out very flavorful.  I would definately make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Delish! I followed the recipe with exception that I added 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of 1/4 teaspoon and I didn't have a garlic clove so I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  I also didn't have any minced fresh parsley so I omitted that.  This was delish!  I was making homemade pizza and realized I that the jar sauce I usually use had gone bad so I used this recipe.  Two thumbs up from my kids and I.  We used it to dip garlic toast in while waiting for the pizza's to cook and it was so yummy!!!  Thank you for a wonderful and easy recipe.  I will no longer buy jarred pizza sauce!

So so easy and good! I doubt if I will ever buy pizza sauce again since this took only a couple of minutes to put together and tastes so much better than store bought sauce. It had a good garlic taste to it, but I thought the other spices could be stronger. Next time I might try doubling the oregano and parsley and see how that turns out. Still great though, no complaints, I just like to experiment. I doubled the recipe so I could use part of it for a pizza and the rest as a dipping sauce for breadsticks, and I thought it worked out great for both. Thank you for a nice, really simple sauce, Laguna!

YUM! I used this as a base recipe and modified it for what I had on hand (stewed tomatoes vs paste & sauce) and doubled the spices and also added basil. I didn't have parsley wither but so far this is THE best sauce recipe I've made! Thanks!!

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I doubled the oregano, added about 1/4 tsp of dried basil, skipped the garlic salt & parsley since I don't have any, and added a dash of salt.  I used it as a dipping sauce for calzones and it was great.  I simmered it on the stovetop a little while so that the flavors could meld.

This was alright, needs more sugar and spice.  I'd leave out the garlic salt next time or swap for powder.

WOW, I couldn't believe how easy and tasty this sauce was.  I did use about 3/4 tsp sugar instead of the 1/2 it called for.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Delicious, but just a little thick for pizza sauce.

Super yummy and super easy, so a for sure winner!!  Comes together in a snap, my only mistake/downfall was using store bought crust instead of homemade :(

My family loves this recipe. We've been using it with the pizza crust recipe we found for months and months now. My boyfriend who lives long-distance from me decided to try and make the pizza my family and I make here. I gave him this recipe and he has gone on and on about how good it is for two days now. He told me he was going to put a bunch in his pizone and dip it on some more after, lol. The ONLY thing we have done different is use 1 15oz can of tomato sauce rather than 2 6.5's for cost and whatnot. Thanks for the recipe!! =)

Delicious! And could it be any easier? Well, yes! Forget the bowl and grab a clean recycled jar 10oz or larger. Throw all ingredients in and grab your immersion blender - or in my case, mini-whisk, since my blender was literally 1/16" too wide. Mix it all up, use what you want, twist on the lid and pop it in the fridge. Done & done! :-)

This is a very versatile recipe, and any pizza topping works with it. This is my go-to recipe. It is nice to have a recipe where I know I will always have all the ingredients in the cupboard!

The BEST pizza sauce ever! Perfect combination of spices.  Simmered on the stove for 20 minutes so the spices melded together.  Didn't add sugar as we don't like a sweet sauce.  Absolutely the BEST!!

This was so simple and delicious.  I added a little more sugar as we prefer a sweeter pizza sauce.  My family agreed that this sauce complimented our favorite dough and toppings rather than overpowering them as so many other sauces do.  This has a much fresher taste than jarred sauces and packs a lot more flavor!

I made this with breadsticks for a Halloween party.  It was so good!  I added a little extra garlic, and it turned out great.  This was the 'blood' to dip your 'fingers' in.  For the breadsticks I put almonds on the end before baking.  Very YUMMY!

Left out the tamota paste ( for some reason I never buy it canned and haven't found the tubes of it) and used no salt added tomato sauce. Used this for buscuit pizzas.

I will never buy pizza sauce in a jar again!  OMGoodness, this is sooo good.  My family and daycare all loved the pizza I made tonight.  I used "Jay's Signature pizza crust"(from this site) and this sauce.  It made a wonderful Gourmet Pizza.  thanks for sharing this recipe.

Nice flavor. So simple.  We had 7 kids over to make the sauce and they had a blast making pizza's.  A winner! Was a little thick.  Added a bit more water. Very yummy. Enjoyed. Thanks!

Very good flavor, quick and easy to assemble too. I wasn't happy with the consistency for a dipping sauce (I imagine it would be perfect for an actual pizza though) so I blended in 1/4 C of water with no noticeable effect on the flavor. Also I simmered it on the stovetop for a bit and served it warm to rave reviews. My breadsticks will be naked no longer... Thanks for posting!

Way easy is the right word and tastes good, too!  I followed the advice of other ratings and added a little more sugar -- was wonderful considering how quickly it was ready.  We ate this on Triscuit Pizzas and with breadsticks and loved it.  I always have this stuff on hand and will never be at a loss for a jar of pizza sauce again!

Good and easy.  I used Garlic, Basil and Oregano tomato sauce and paste.  So I didn't use garlic or oregano.  However, I did use garlic salt along with the other spices.

This was a very very good recipe.  I liked how simple it was.  I accidentally put 1/4 tsp of dried basil in it because I could have sworn this recipe mentioned it, but I am positive it would still be at least a 4.5 star without the basil.  Excellent and easy.

This sauce good but I'm sure there are probably even better recipes out there.  However, I always use this recipe when I make pizza because it's way better than the jarred stuff, it's super easy/fast to make and most importantly I have all the spices on hand! I use dried parsley because it's more convenient and it tastes just fine.

This is SO good, and SO simple.  I made Pepperoni Rolls and we dipped them into this sauce - perfect.  One of my children said that she liked how the Roll was hot, but the sauce was cold (room temp).   I thought about warming the sauce but tried it "cold" and it was excellent.

Very good!  I didn't want it to have a strong garlic flavor so I omitted the chopped garlic but did add garlic powder and onion powder.  I also added extra basil and it had a great pizzeria flavor.

This recipe is wonderfully easy to  make, just make sure all of your seasonings are finely ground (my garlic salt was gritty). The only thing I would change is the thickness, it's a little too thick for dipping, but a little water made it perfect. Absolutely de-lish!

So easy and so good! Nice and thick. Way better than those runny sauces you buy on the shelves!

This is almost identical to the recipe that I made up myself about ten years ago on the fly, except I made mine with just the paste and water. I wanted a thinner recipe today and wanted to use up some of the sauce I had in my pantry... I used a 14oz can of sauce instead, with the 6oz can of paste, and used 1/2 tsp ea: salt, sugar, garlic powder, dried parsley, and oregano. It turned out fantastic. Thanks so much for the inspiration! :)

Not a bad dipping sauce. Kids liked it and that is what matters.

Perfect sauce! Made it ahead of time and the flavors absorbed in the tomato mixture. It is nice and thick so you can spread it around. Not watery at all. I used 1 clove of garlic instead of the minced, and I used dried parsley instead of fresh. Thank you for a good down to earth recipe! It was enough to make four 12 inch pizzas.

This is good! I do agree w/ others that said it was too thick for pizza sauce...I just added a bit of water and that fixed that problem right up. We thought the flavors were nice...not too overpowering, which was what I was after. I subbed Italian seasoning for the oregano and added a bit of pepper and parmesan cheese...worked nicely and can't wait to try this for breadsticks! Thanks for sharing. :)

Tasty. The garlic salt made me want this more as a marinara sauce with breadsticks rather than pizza. I'll have to try breadsticks next time.

Simple, easy recipe.  I added a little too much sugar, but will use less next time.

This sauce was SOOOOO good!  However, I did make some minor changes to my taste.
I used 1 can of crushed tomatoes, 1/2 can of tomato paste, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp sugar, dash of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of dried parsley.  I mixed all the ingredients together and heated in the microwave and used for dipping "Paula's bread sticks"  (another fabulous recipe from this site)!

Even my very selective 6 year old ate this! I left out the parsley and I blended up canned tomatoes since that was what we had in the pantry. We used it as our pizza sauce on English Muffin pizzas. Yum!

I scaled this down to 4 servings and added chopped pepperoni.  This is quick to make if you do not have jarred sauce available.  I thought it was a bit too thick and was missing something in taste for a bread dip but would work with with pizza because of all the additional toppings.  I served this with Jimmbo's garlic knots recipe from this site.

I have made this a lot and we like it. I have tasted others with a little better flavor but this is the best fast and easy sauce.
