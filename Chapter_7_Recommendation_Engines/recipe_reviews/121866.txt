Wonderful muffin! What a great find especially if you LOVE orange. No additions needed as the delicate orange flavor is the real hero here. I doubled the orange juice and the orange zest as I really wanted to heighten the flavor. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin lined with paper liners so I got a half dozen really big muffins. I topped them with some turbinado sugar before baking. They took about 24 minutes at 400 and were nicely browned on top. I did an orange glaze over top made from orange juice and confectioners' sugar to really give these muffins a nice sheen and bring out even more of that wonderful citrus flavor - this is a real keeper! And, while I'm sure the orange spread is wonderful these muffins were great on their own...

These were wonderful. I had no trouble with dense muffins. I did wonder, because the batter was very thick. I made ten nice sized muffins that were just slightly crunchy on top. The spread was a wonderful addition. It is not meant bo be an icing. I'll definitely be making these again!

These muffins are very similar to the ones my Grandmother used to make when I was a child. She however did not use the orange butter, but instead used an orange glaze of squeezed orange juice and powdered sugar drizzled over the warm muffins. It soaks in and then slightly hardens on top. Delicious!!

These are wonderful muffins.  Since I made these for an upcoming swim meet and the muffins would need to be transported, I did not make the butter.  Instead I made an orange glaze to top the muffins.  I was able to use fresh orange juice for both the muffins and the glaze, and the flavor is just right.  My kids have already snatched one before the meet, and can't wait to have more.

Good flavor.  The spread is a nice treat and makes it special. It is very buttery and rich though, so we had to use it sparingly.  I will try using a little less butter next time and whipping it up a little fluffier, if possible, rather than just smooth.

I tried adding a little extra flour as recommended by one of the reviewers, but without adjusting the other ingredients as well, the batter was a little too thick and made for heavier muffins.  Next time I'll follow the recipe and make fewer muffins that are larger, and hopefully lighter.     

I think fresh grated orange peel instead of dried might have been better too.  Next time.

I increased the flour to 1 3/4 cups as I wanted 12 muffins.  These are so light and tasty!  You could skip the orange spread, but I wouldn't!

These were great! They are myhusbands new favorite! I didn't have sour cream so I used low fat vanilla yogurt and I squeezed the juice from the orange.  To get my husband to eat anything that is made with yogurt is a miracle. They were amazing!

This review is for the muffins only, although the orange spread sounds like a great addition.  I followed the recipe, but I did make mine a little larger than directed and got 7 good-sized muffins.  The addition of the orange zest gave these just the right amount of orange flavor.  I, too, made a glaze of confectioners sugar and orange juice and drizzled it over the tops of the cooled muffins.  Very nice!

These are really good muffins.  I didn't have orange peel, so I subbed orange extract.  Didn't make the spread, but did like some other reviewers and made an orange glaze.  Very nice flavor and still good several days later!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Pam!

I am rating just the muffins as I did not make the spread. These were fantastic! I made a couple of revisions. I was out of sour cream so substituted vanilla yogurt I had on hand. I doubled the orange juice and zest to kick up the orange flavor a notch. The recipe was so easy my preschooler helped to make them. They were enjoyed by all in this house!

These were just ok to me.  I prefer large, fluffy bakery-type muffins if I'm going to the trouble of not using a mix; these turned out small and dense.  Plus, the icing was way too buttery.
