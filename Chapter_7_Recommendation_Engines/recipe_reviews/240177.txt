This was my first time making overnight oatmeal, and it won't be my last! I really liked this. I used canned peaches (fresh are not in season right now), and skipped the optional chia seeds, but did add the pecans. I am looking forward to trying this with other fruits and nuts, like the submitter suggests. Thank you!

I've seen the recipes for overnight oatmeal and thought I'd try this one. It was very good! I went with what I had on hand that had to be used up:  vanilla soy milk and vanilla Greek yogurt. For me, no additional sweeteners were needed, probably after adding those. I didn't want to add the peaches in case I didn't like this, so in their place I added a few tblsp of dried cherries. I did add the optional pecans and chia seeds. I heated it and also added a little non-dairy creamer. Half of this was plenty for me, so more for later! The peaches would be good here; many possibilities for other add-ins as the author suggests. Very filling, nutritious and saves time! UPDATE 1/15/16: Used mixed berry yogurt, and it worked well here.

We love this recipe. We use a modified version.
Honey/maple syrup/chocolate chips/peanut butter instead of stevia
1/2 of any fruit
Sometimes we add protein powder

This was great! I used about half the milk and yogurt and put chopped grapes as my fruit. The almond extract flavor was a bit overpowering, I would try less next time. I like mine better cold!

I used vanilla extract instead of almond extract. I also used regular milk, that's all we had on hand. I ended up adding an extra packet of Stevia in the morning when I tasted it, the greek yogurt made it really tangy. I think next time I'll add a little less greek yogurt, and add a mashed banana for sweetness. I like that you can play around with this recipe.

I tweaked this recipe a little. I mixed steel cut oats with old fashioned oats to add more texture. Instead of almond milk, I used vanilla soy milk to give the oats to mix better with the vanilla yogurt I used. I added bananas, strawberries and raspberries because that's what I had around the house. Instead of mixing everything together, I layered the bottom with yogurt, added the oats, then added milk until the oats looked almost covered then put the fruit on top. This kept the fruit from getting soggy.

This is great alternative to smoothies! Because my husband and I have swallow disorders, finding delicious recipes specific temperatures, consistencies and textures is really tough. Unfortunately, we had to exclude chia seeds because they're a severe choking risk. Thanks for including it! I hope people add more!
