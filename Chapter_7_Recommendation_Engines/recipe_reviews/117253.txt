I thought this was going to be a little weird because of the mango, but it was surprisingly subtle. The recipe calls for quite a bit of it though; next time I make it I plan to use less.

Delicious and easy. I used whole-grain couscous and a mixture of diced shrimp with the crab since it's what I had in my fridge.

I liked this but it was lacking something and I am not sure what yet.  I may try adding some curry powder next time I make this.

I love it! My first time eating and making couscous. The only changes I made were not adding any crab meat or mango since I don't have any at the moment and just using water instead of the broth and butter. It's a delicious side dish to go with my grilled chicken breast. Thanks for the recipe!

This had a really great mix of flavors. I cut up an extra mango & boiled it down, added brown sugar, and chile pepper. Then added this to the dressing

Good salad, but I think next time I will dress it differently.  I found the olive oil taste in this dressing a little too prominent.  The dressing needs to taste fresher and tangier.

This was ok. I didn't really like the flavor of the combination of the mango and tomatoes.
