This is a good standard meringue. You can add 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar to help stabilize the meringue if you like.

I used Truvia,  and it still turned out fluffy and turned golden in the oven.   I didn't have the lemon extract so I used a little juice.  It's on a chocolate pie I made with Truvia, also.   I haven't tasted the combined effort as yet, but it tasted good going into the Pillsbury crust.     Thanks!

This was a very easy recipe, tastes delicious and it came out perfectly. The only thing I omitted was lemon extract because I didn’t have it in the house.

I didn’t have lemon extract, but it sounds good. The trick with meringue is to have a dry bowl and beaters, and to not overbeat it. Worked for me.
