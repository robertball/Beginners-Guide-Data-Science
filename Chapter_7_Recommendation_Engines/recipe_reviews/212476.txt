good salad, served it on Christmas for 20 people, got great feedback!  however, i could not find the dressing suggested in the recipe, so i used some rasberry vinegrette i had on hand, i think next time i would use a balsamic vinegrette.

This is a delicious salad! I have been making a salad similar to this, however, I use feta cheese, fresh apple chunks, and Maple Grove Fat-Free Cranberry Balsamic Salad Dressing because I have been dieting.  The madarin oranges really make it better  I was wondering if Joy Chou has a recipe for Cranberry Dressing?

VERY TASTY. We didn't have mandarin oranges on hand and it still tasted good, but I'm sure it would have been even better with the oranges. If any of you have tasted the California Citrus Salad from the restaurant Claim Jumper, this salad tastes JUST like it.

I submitted this recipe that called for Raspberry Vinaigrette salad dressing but after it was kitchen tested and approved, it was changed to Cranberry Vinaigrette dressing by All Recipes.

Like the intro to this recipe mentions, I too am a busy professional woman, so it seemed like a good choice. The salad was tasty and involves lots of "fancy" ingredients. Next time I would double the greens because the fancy parts are what raise the calorie count. It's a keeper!

A wonderful, easy salad.  I made this for Christmas dinner and it was gone.  I left out the avocado and it was fine without it.  I used Brianna's Blush Wine Vinagrette dressing, which is one of my favorites.  I've since made a small version for my husband and I, which is very easy to do with the leftover ingredients such as the cranberries and walnuts.  I'm very busy, so any quick, delicious recipes like this have a strong appeal for me.

Excellent winter salad. I served it Christmas day and received many compliments. The salad is flexible as it's as good with the avocado as without. I served it without the avocado as my husband doesn't care for them. I also served it with the blue cheese on the side [we had quite a few kids there and I was afraid the blue cheese would turn them off] and that went well, people just added as much blue cheese as they wanted.

As far as the dressing - I made the dressing found in AR's recipe Spinach and Strawberry Salad  EXCEPT I USED ONLY 1/3 CUP SUGAR AND USE BALSAMIC VINEGAR INSTEAD OF WINE VINEGAR. This homemade balsamic dressing is perfect with this salad.

Very good recipe! Only changes made were I replaced the walnuts with toffee covered peanuts (couldn't find honey roasted in bulk) and couldn't find cranberry vinaigrette, so got Girard's raspberry vinaigrette instead. Toffee peanuts made it a little sweet, so will probably go with unsalted roasted next time. Thanks! :)

We used cashews instead of walnuts, and used blood orange-infused olive oil and cranberry balsamic vinegar for the dressing. Quite easily the most delicious salad I ever made or ate. I gave up my entree to have doubles of this instead. :)

This is a really fantastic salad.  I left out the avocado and didn't miss it a bit!  Perhaps more lettuce would be a bit better, but it was wonderful as is.

Very good!  I served this for Christmas dinner.  It was a perfect pairing with our daughter's Coca Cola Ham.  Like others, I couldn't find cranberry vinaigrette, but raspberry vinaigrette was a good substitute, and I did use candied pecans instead of walnuts, as I had already made some for Christmas.  No avocados because some guests aren't fans of them.  Will definitely make this again.

Very tasty! Like most dishes I do, I took the original recipe and added some to it. I took some advice from an earlier comment and added an apple and a red onion. I replaced the cheese to Feta and that was key for me! I also added sunflowers seeds because I had them and why not. I like heartier salads to I added extra extra ingredients to my liking. I finished it off with a mango vinegarette. Everyone loved it! Happy eating!

This salad turned out great. I took it to my family’s Christmas and it was well received. I used bottled raspberry vinaigrette dressing. I’m not a big blue cheese fan, but in this salad along with all the other flavors it was delicious.

I used a Raspberry Vinaigarette dressing recipe on this site by Jan W.  The only red raspberry vinegar I could find was a sipping vinegar (with mother) with honey and raspberry so I used that.  Next time I will cut down on the amount of sugar for this dressing since there is honey in the vinegar.  GREAT dressing.  I am not a blue cheese fan but I LOVED this!  The combo of flavors was incredible!

This is one of the best salad recipes I have ever made. I couldn’t find the cranberry vinaigrette so I substituted a green apple vinaigrette by Panera Bread Company. The tartness of the green apples complimented the layers of flavor well.

Came out great. I used a regular mix of greens without spinach but didn't make a difference. Everyone loved it and will definitely make it again.  I used Paul Newman's Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette. Go light on the dressing. You do not need a lot at all!

Great salad. I made it to bring to a friend's house for dinner and everyone loved it. It's really appetizing to look at as well.  I made two modifications. I couldn't find Cranberry vinaigrette  dressing so I used Pomagranate.   And I substituted Gorgonzola crumbles for Bleu Cheese .

I made this to take to a Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it, nothing was left.  I left out the avocado, and used litehouse raspberry walnut balsamic vinegar dressing. I will make it on the weekends just for us. Thanks!

I made this salad as a starter to Christmas lunch.  It was really good.  Have already made it again to take with me to work!
