Awesome stuff. I was making a recipe from this site and realized I needed "self-rising cornmeal." I didn't want to go to the store and found this recipe. I changed the servings to 2 with the calculate button and got about 1 1/4 cups, which was all I needed for a recipe. Thanks, I will use this again. It was a definite time saver today. For anyone unsure there are other recipes on this site and net that use "self-rising cornmeal."  Here are just a few from Allrecipes: http://allrecipes.com/search/default.aspx?ms=0&qt=a&pqt=a&fo=0&rt=r&w0=Self-rising%20cornmeal&words=All&p34=SR_SortByRating&sb=ra

well, the obvious problem with this recipe, is, once you make the "mix".. what about the ingredients/measurements to make the actual cornbread? How much milk? How many eggs and how much "mix" to make a loaf or muffins? There's no sugar, so this would be straight cornbread.. I'm going to have to tinker with this mix to get the exact milk/egg/sugar to mix ratio.

I had to eliminate the dry milk for allergies figuring that when mixing batter, soy milk can be added later.  This worked out fine in the recipe I used!

Probably swell if there is some liquid ingredient!! Water, milk, something. I added both water and milk until I had a batter instead of a sticky dough. Its in the oven now. Need to be careful to add ALL the ingredients!
