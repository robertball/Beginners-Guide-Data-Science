Just delicious!  I had the benefit of reading other reviewers' comments so I added a couple of tablespoons of parmesan cheese in addition to the cheddar (I resized the recipe to serve 8).  Also, I used skim milk and I froze the butter and then grated it into the flour mixture (a trick I learned from a different biscuit recipe).  This made it easier to blend the butter in with the flour.  The biscuits came out crunchy on the top and bottom but light and fluffy in the middle.  My daughter said this recipe is a "keeper."

These were pretty good. I actually made 2 batches. The first ones I made exactly as written. They were maybe worthy of a 3 star rating. I probably wouldn't make them again if following the recipe as written. Then I made them following the reviews. I used butter instead of shortning, more milk, more cheese, added parmesean too, and brushed them with garlic salt and melted butter after coming out of the oven. I would make them like this in a heartbeat.

Really good, I've made them time and time again.  I used oil instead of shortening to make them a bit healthier otherwise I make them exactly the same.  Their super quick and can compliment almost any meal!

Really good flavourful biscuits.  I increase the butter slightly and used 1 cup of milk instead of 3/4 cup.  Sometimes I also add a few shakes of parmesan or some bacon bits.  When I don't feel like cooking dinner, I open a can of soup and quickly whip up these.  Dear hubby gushes more than if I'd spent all day preparing a meal.

Very easy!  Like she said, they're great just to toss something extra into your meal.  They're great just out of the oven, but got stale quickly...

I really enjoyed these biscuits.  My revisions to the recipe included adding a bit more garlic and cheese than called for and no chives.  I think had I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, it would have turned out better, as they were a bit salty tasting when they first came out of the oven.  They are great, though, as snacks later even after supper... just put them in the fridge, they're great cold!

This was really good.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and increased it to a heaping Tsp. (we like garlic) Also increaded the cheese.  It's a nice light biscuit with a crunchy crust and fluffy inside!  Yummy.  THX

Very good! My son made these to go with dinner and they came out perfectly. We did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and about a cup of shredded cheese. Baked them in muffin cups. Thanks for the recipe

Thought this recipe was OK, but needed tweaking.  I used aged white cheddar and fresh chives instead of dried (about 1 tbsp).  I added about an extra 2 tbsp worth of milk as the batter seemed dry which helped, but the biscuits still turned out a bit on the dry side.  Next time would add more liquid.

OMG! These are awesome...I have made them for a topping to chicken pot pie and stayed closer to the recipe except using self rising flour, veg oil and garlic salt. No chives. I also have made them in the morning to use for my breakfast sausage gravy. Both have been YUMMY!

Fabulous Recipe. These were so easy, I just decided to make them in the morning and they were ready for breakfast. Excellent Recipe. No more stacking on Pillsbury ready to bake biscuits, these were better. I added one fresh spring onion, one small clove of garlic and medium cheddar cheese as I didn't have sharp. Heavenly. Thanks a lot for the recipe.

These biscuits are almost a staple in my house.  I always substitute butter or margarine for shortening.  Sometimes I make them with the garlic, chives and cheese and other times I just make them plain.  This also makes a super yummy crust for pot pie.

There is a golden rule when making biscuits. " the wetter the dough the better the biscuit" This recipe i found to need an extra 1/4 cup or milk to qualify as a dry biscuit when cooked. I fallowed the recipe exactly. After making 2 biscuits as a test I found the recipe was so flawed I added more milk and some more spices such as taragon chopped onion and pepper. i also added a small handful of extra cheese. Only then did the recipe taste decent. This recipe is nothing more then flawed.

YUMMY! I made a few changes due to lack of ingredients...No chives, I used Dried minced garlic in place of garlic salt, half butter and half shortening. They were so good. Will make again. Soon!

I rarely follow a recipe exactly and we eat a lot of organic and whole foods so I made this recipe with whole wheat pastry flour and butter. I wanted a little more herbs so added  1/2 tsp of an Italian Mix. I used 1% milk and had to add another 1/4 cup on top of the 3/4. Had no sharp cheddar so used a little of parm and a monterey jack and mild cheddar mix. Probably a little over 1/2 cup of cheese total. I made big biscuits so got 10 out of the batch and baked them for 11 ish minutes on a baking stone. They turned out great. This is an awesome base recipe.

Great simple recipe.  The texture is just how biscuits should be--a bit dry and crispy outside, light and moist inside.  I felt like it needed some changes, though.  I added fresh green onion with the cheese and milk since I didn't have chives, and that was a nice addition.  I followed other reviewers' advice and added some extra Parmesan with the aged cheddar, but still thought they weren't cheesy enough.  Also tasted like way too much garlic salt.  Next time, I'll cut down on the garlic salt and add raw garlic with the green onion.

Excellent recipe! I did use 1 cup milk and also added straight 1/4tsp garlic powder and fresh chives instead of dried. My only comment is I think I would cut the salt a bit next time.

generally I really like this but did make a couple changes: salt plus garlic salt is too much salt/not enough garlic for me...so changed the garlic salt to just plain garlic powder. I also doubled the cheddar. No shortening on hand/used butter. I used buttermilk instead of milk just becauase I had it on hand in the 'fridge and I personally like buttermilk biscuits. I gave a 5 for me as above/a 4 star rating with needing to add a lot of stuff for more robust flavor. Someone who likes a milder flavor will probably like it "as written".I like stuff bursting with flavor.

I was very disappointed in this recipe.I don't know what went wrong. I think they needed more milk, because they were not the consistency to be dropped on to a sheet. I had to roll out like other biscuits, and cut into shape. Even so they were too dry and tasted doughy. Also they didn't rise and I used newly bought baking powder. If anyone has any suggestions, I sure would be grateful. After reading all the reviews, I think I must be doing something wrong.

Was really good after some adjustments. I first halved the recipe to 6 servings. Added an additional TBSP of milk, additional 1/4 tsp of garlic salt added a an additional 1/4 cup of shredded mexican cheese. Brushed the tops of the biscuits with a combo of Garlic salt and melted unsalted butter. Made 8 nice size biscuits. Cooked 15 min exactly.

very good, only needed more cheese which of course is a personal preference. Also, I added before the milk so as not to overmix the dough.

Awesome starter!  I used celery salt in lieu of plain and upped the milk to a cup, cheese to 1/2 cup and shortening t 1/2 cup butter - AMAZING.  Thanks for setting the groundwork, they turned out amazingly delicious.

Just made these and pulled them out of the oven. Followed some other comments, went with about a cup of milk, 1/2 cup of cheese and 1/3 cup grated butter. Also used about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and a few cranks of pepper. Turned out pretty good. I got 9 out of the original recipe and it took 12 min in oven. 4 are gone already. So definitely a hit

So happy to find a drop biscuit recipe to use as a guideline! I almost never follow a recipe exactly.  Instead of garlic salt, chives, and milk, I used 1c. buttermilk, 1t. kosher salt, & 1/2 c. aged white cheddar. I served it for breakfast with scrambled eggs, diced ham & onions, topped with some of the same white cheese. I look forward to making these biscuits again; they were perfect. It would definitely be good with fresh chives.  I will do a decadent bacon grease and bits instead of shortening for a special occasion.  My oven only heats to 350, I made 9 good size biscuits and baked for 30 mins.

A good basic recipe that's made fantastic by making a few changes. I used a full tablespoon of dried chives, & a teaspoon of garlic powder instead of salt.  I also used vegetable oil instead of shortening, & a full cup tex-mex shredded cheese in the place of cheddar. And they turned out wonderfully.  A lot of people have suggested adding parmesan as well & I've made these using a pre-shredded 4 cheese blend of italian cheeses from the deli section of my grocery store with equally delicious results.  Will be coming back to this one again & again.

These were pretty good. I used all ingredients but the chives. I added 1 cup milk instead of the 3/4 cup. I wish I would of added more garlic and cheese. This was good with out rice, ham and cheese bake.

Too stiff for drop biscuits. I added 2 T. more milk. Next time I'll double the cheese, too, and double the garlic salt but omit the regular salt.

Delicious! I've made a similar recipe using baking mix and was specifically looking for a recipe made from scratch.  I did use butter instead of shortening, a full tsp. of garlic powder, more cheese and maybe a tablespoon more milk.  Brushed with butter when done and my family devoured them!

Best biscuit recipe ever!! Came out perfect...light and fuffy, crispy with melted cheese on the bottom!  I did substitute butter as I had no shortening, and would make it the same way again. Might cut down the garlic salt just a bit...

Very tasty. Substituted mozzarella cheese for cheddar and yogurt instead of shortening. Didn't have dried chives, so used dried parsley. Added dried onion flakes, garlic powder, a dash of basil & oregano. Very moist & flavorful. Quick too- took about 5 min to mix all ingredients together.

Quick and easy! I ran out of Bisquick for the recipes that I normally used and tried this one instead. I did think they tasted a tad like flour, so I will tweak next time. I brushed a butter/garlic mix on top when I pulled them from the oven.

Quick & Easy! I made a few adjustments, i.e. no chives and substituted milk/butter for shortening.  The result was a tasty, but semi-bland and thick/heavy (tasting) biscuit.  Next time, I'll still use the milk/butter sub but add just a tad more milk, as well as more garlic.

We thought these were really good. My 10yo daughter wasn't crazy about them, but everyone else was. After baking, I brushed them with 2 tablespoons of melted butter with 1/8tsp of garlic powder. I thought they were almost as light as the Bisquick kind. I did have to add a bit more milk to get the dough to come together.  Thanks for the recipe!

We were snowed in after a snow storm and I happened to have everything for this recipe.  The only change I made was to add more cheese.  They are WONDERFUL!  So easy and so yummy!  I found them to be perfectly flavored.

I found these had a good texture but were a little too salty.  I'd substitute garlic powder for the garlic salt to keep the garlicky punch but reduce the sodium content.

I loved it.  This is pretty much my regular biscuit recipe.  The only change is, I added a little more cheese like the other reviewers suggested.  And I see now, I forgot the chives.  Happy baking!

This was my very first attempt at biscuits, short of the Pillsbury version. I was a little nervous but read a bunch of reviews to ease my fears. The one take away from my reading is that some felt the batter was too dry. With that said, I followed the directions, only subbing the shortening for butter (it's what I had) and I kept a little extra milk handy, which I did add a few extra splashes to help moisten the batter a bit. It was sticky, but firm enough to “glop” onto the pan.
I first baked a batch for 13 min on a cookie sheet with parchment paper and they came out wonderful! 
I then decided to try the same recipe for the top “crust” of my chicken potpie. Since all the ingredients to the pie were already cooked and warm, it was really just about cooking the biscuits. Again, 13 minutes and it was done. WOW!!! So very very good. 
I’m NOT the baker of my household, because I don’t like to measure so precisely, but I’m a pretty good cook overall. My wife was shocked when she saw I attempted biscuits. When she bit into one, she looked at me and said, “You measured!” She then ate 3! I think she might have also taken one to work this morning for breakfast.

I will certainly make these again!

I give this dish a 5 star rating for simplicity (measuring I can handle!) and taste.

After reading other reviews, I added some Parm cheese and another 1/4 cup milk and instead of the dried chives, I finely chopped up some green onion and I used multi-grain flour.   The taste was not bad but just too dry.

Amazing. I used butter instead of shortening because butter and a more cheese because cheese makes the world go round. I also used garlic powder rather than garlic salt and adjusted the salt accordingly. It’s super important to not over-mix biscuits so mix them until they’re just moistened through to prevent the dreaded biscuit puck. Fluffy, moist and cheesily excellent. Thanks for the great recipe!

This review is for the recipe as written. It was too dry and would require up to 1/4 cup more water. The flavor was good. I would make these again but add more milk.

Awesome! Substitute shredded unsalted butter, and used a bit of Parmesan cheese.  Light and fluffy, mouth watering quick do for end of day meal. Also Froze them individually for afternoon tea at work. Worked like a charm!

Love Love Love these! Increased milk to 1 cup, used margarine 1/2 cup. Added 1 TBS of sugar, added 1/2 tsp of baking soda in addition to the baking powder. used 1 tsp garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added 2 cups of shredded mild cheddar. I did not add chives, but that's just our preference. Made 12 large biscuits and baked at 450 for 13 minutes total. Biscuits were soft and moist!! Definitely will make again.

Excellent!  I was looking for a ham and cheese recipe, but just added ham to this.  Because of food allergies, I used lard and they turned out wonderfully.  I did omit the garlic and added a small amount of salt.  This is a keeper, so much easier than rolling, but I did need a tad more milk than the recipe required.  Oh, don't over mix!

These are another of my husband's favorites! I've made them so many times for him that I made some small changes. I use 1 cup of milk, added some parmesan and about 1 cup of shredded cheddar. Can never have too much cheese!

This was a simple recipe and very good. My son used them for his project in his nutrition class and found it easy to make. I did make a few changes. I used butter instead of shortening and used 1/2 cup of butter. I increased the milk to 1 1/4 cups and 1 cup of cheese. I melted 1/4 cup of butter and brushed the biscuits with the melted butter once the came out of the oven. They were delicious!

Everyone liked them. We had them with Brunswick Stew! I didn't have shortening or milk so I used butter and buttermilk. Also I didn't have chives. 
I still used garlic and salt. And I didn't really measure anything, I just poured buttermilk in until it was moist and I grated cheese until it looked like enough.
Oh, and I did cut down the baking powder to 2 teaspoons. My rule of thumb is to use a teaspoon per cup of flour because once I had a terrible experience with some biscuits that tasted like straight baking powder!
I baked them in a large muffin tin. Yum!

Disappointed in these. I followed the recipe and ended up throwing them out. They lacked flavor and were very dry and bland. I ended up re-making this recipe and upped the milk, butter, cheese, garlic and chives. Sadly I didn't write down what I did but they were delicious!

These were super easy and fast to make. They turned out very light and flaky. I did do a couple of slight tweaks to the recipe. I didn't have any shortening or butter so I substituted cold coconut oil and cut it into the flour mixture with a pastry cutter like you would with butter.
I also added more cheese, probably about 1 cup or so and a little bit more salt & garlic, though the next time, I'd nix the extra salt.
They turned out great with just the slightest hint of coconut, which I didn't mind at all. Fantastic straight out of the oven!

Great, quick, and easy.  I made 8 biscuits with 1 cup flour, .5 tbsp bkg pwd, .5 tsp garlic powder, .25 tsp salt, little more than 1/8 cup butter, 1/2 cup almond milk, shredded cheese for my half, shredded parmesan cheese in all dough.  Brushed with garlic salt and melted butter after coming out of oven.  Hubby loved them and they were milk free for him!

We don't usually like drop biscuits but as long as you add an extra 1/2 cup milk and double the cheese, these are nice and moist in the middle. I also followed reviewers advice and brushed them with melted butter once they were done. My oven ran a little hot at 450, so next time I'll probably bring the heat down to 400.

Ever since I had Red Lobster's biscuits, I have been trying to replicate them, that is until now. These are absolutely phenomenal. I altered it just a tad. I used a quarter cup of butter, I was out of chives, so instead I added a dash of rosemary (that is like 3 or 4 shakes out of one of those tiny spice containers), added 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and 1 cup of buttermilk. I never have to go to Red Lobster again for them. These are so simple to make and so delicious. I ate almost half a dozen in 1 sitting. :)

I tried this recipe tonight, and the biscuits turned out great! I did follow the suggestion to use butter and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I would like to try it with garlic salt next time to compare as mine were a tad bland. Only reason I didnt give it a five is because I didnt make it exact. Overall, this recipe is a keeper :)

I make mine with 1 cup of buttermilk and olive oil instead of shortening and it comes out fantastic. Use 10 tbsp of olive oil for every cup of butter.

A good recipe to work from. As others noted, I also increased the liquids and still found the outer edges to be dry though inside was moist - will adjust timing on next batch. I used 2c whole wheat pastry flour, 1 1/2T baking powder, 1/2t garlic salt and onion powder, 1c milk, 6T butter, 3/4c mixed cheese, 1t minced garlic. Did not have chives but will definitely add those or parsley in next batch for added flavor.

These were certainly easy to make.  They came out a bit drier for me.  If you are looking for a moister style biscuit this may not be it.   I used half and half instead of milk.  Used Garlic Powder and fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, parsley) and actually smashed some flat and used over chicken pot pie instead of crust.    Because of the dryer texture they worked out well with the gravy of the pot pie.    I will make these again, I just mixed it all in a bowl with a fork and it was pretty easy.  I hand shaped those that I didn't place on pot pies.

Absolutely dry and bland, I would probably add more milk and quite a bit more of the spices.

This is a dry biscuit, but very yummy. The only thing that would make them better is drizzling melted butter over them with garlic powder.

I've been going through a lot of biscuit recipies lately, looking for the right one. This definitely did the trick! I had to half the recipie due to an ingredient being nearly out, and I did not include garlic, and used green onions instead of chives. It was fantastic.

Bland. It does make nice fluffy biscuits but nothing like Red Lobster's.

Yummy and easy!  I followed other reviews and added a little extra milk, garlic and some parmesean.  Had no lard so used butter.  Had no chives used basil.  I would give it a 5 if I hadn't made little changes....so easy and quick!!!  Thanks!!

Good biscuit. Easy to modify to your personal taste. Watch them or they will dry out.

I thought the biscuits were quick and easy. I did not use chives and instead of cheddar cheese I used taco cheese. They turned out really good and will make again.

Good, quick and easy. Instead of dried chives I used some chopped onion, plus I added some fresh chopped garlic, very tasty and very easy to make!

Good, but a little on the dry side.  I definitely recommend adding much more cheese to this - I used sharp white cheddar.  Also, I brushed the tops with an egg wash and sprinkled with poppyseeds before baking and they came out looking great!  however, this requires a close watch since they brown much faster.. its worth it though, it gives it great texture.

these biscuits have the subtle flavor of "comfort food." i'll make these again but will add more garlic salt- the earlier review about them being too salty just stumps me. i found them to taste just the opposite. in agreement with an earlier review- be sure you eat them while still warm!
(especially yummy dipped in homemade marinara sauce)

We thought these were OK and has potential.  I will make again with 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, omit the regular salt, and use a full cup of sharp cheddar.
