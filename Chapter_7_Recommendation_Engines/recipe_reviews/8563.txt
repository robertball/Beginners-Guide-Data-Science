I let my chicken get a little too done but you couldn't even taste the burnt part!  The gravy was excellent on my mashed potatoes.  I thought the breading on the chicken would get soggy and taste gross but it was great.  I'll definetely make this again!

We just finished eating this and it's a good thing I made extra or I'd have nothing to eat for lunch tomorrow! I didn't bother with simmering in the bouillon water, so we just had them as chicken tenders! They were crispy and we served with a variety of dipping sauces. This is a healthy alternative to fast food, because we used all white-meat chicken and fried in olive oil. Yum!

The best way I have found to make chicken like this is to dip the washed and dried chicken in egg, then roll in Panko (or Japanese style) bread crumbs instead of flour and cereal, salt and pepper - and the most amazing ingredient is to fry these in coconut oil!  I know you think I'm crazy..., but it isn't sweet, it gives these lovely chicken tenders a new twist in taste!!  Don't knock it til you try it.  You may have to go to a Whole Foods type store to find the coconut oil, it is worth the trouble and cost!

This recipe tasted great, but it was terribly difficult to keep the chicken from getting a little soggy!  Maybe I did something wrong.  I gave it a 4 for taste because it was definitely delicious. :)

Maybe I did something wrong, but the breading on the chicken did get soggy and fell off the pieces of meat. I wasn't pleased with this recipe. Too much work!

This was pretty good but I like my chicken crispier.  It has a good flavor but the chicken crust gets soft.

Had to make it twice (first time was OK and worth a second shot), but the 2nd time was AMAZING. I did not have corn flakes on hand either time, so I went with some bisquick and seasonings. Don't "play" with the chicken too much or the breading falls off.

Edited to add on 06/05/15:

I have been making a gluten free version of this for a few years now. I either crush cereal of some sort or use an all purpose baking mix, depending on what I have on hand. I love gravy, so I use an entire carton  of chicken broth or stock. To aid in thickening, I also mix a few tablespoons of corn starch in with some of the broth/stock before adding it to the chicken. Serve with mashed potatoes. It's our family favorite.

This was kind of interesting, but a hitch with an ingredient and some inexperience with the technique made it just okay overall, in my opinion. I tried to make it exactly as written, but I quickly found out that 1/2 cup of cornflake crumbs was not enough. (I'd measured it by volume, and probably should have measured by weight instead.) In a minor vein, the amount of eggs used was too much (I used the standard "large" eggs, and the "medium" ones I see for sale would have been more appropriate). I'm not very familiar with the dipping and breading steps used here, so probably didn't do the best job, especially since I ran out of crumbs. I cooked the whole dish for 40 minutes (at which time my side dish was also done). It tasted decent, and the gravy was a nice touch (though there wasn't much of it). This was a nice, different recipe, but I think it could definitely be improved upon.

Have made this twice. It is tender, flavorful and easy.  Family and friends all love it.  Used garlic salt instead of salt and chicken broth instead of water.

While mine wasn't crispy when done, it was very tasty and I will make it again.
