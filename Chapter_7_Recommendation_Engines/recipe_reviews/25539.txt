I've been making a version of this for several years.  This is the first time I have added sausage to the mix.  I will make them this way from now on. I took a batch to work last Friday and they were a huge hit.  I had lots of requests for the recipe.  Good thing I have internet access at work so that I could eailsy print the recipe.  
Here are some of the tips that I handed out to my fellow co-workers....be sure to use rubber gloves when handling peppers.  Also, to reduce the "pepper fumes" in the air, fill your sink with water, float the peppers in the water.  Working with a sharp knife and a spoon, slice them in half length wise and use the spoon to scoop out the seeds and veins.  Do all of this under the water or you will cough hysterically!  I learned this from experience many years ago.  
I also added about 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar and a few sliced green onions to my cream cheese stuffing mix.  
Most people were surprised that these were actually very mild and quite tasty without a mouth of fire.  I suspose, if you wanted some heat you could leave the veins or add some of the seeds back to your stuffing mix.  
ENJOY :)

What a hit with everyone at the party! The reviewer who mentioned brushing the bacon with honey before wrapping the pepper was right on! It adds that background flavor that makes people wonder. Also, added cayenne for some extra heat to the sausage/cream cheese mixture.  My peppers were somewhat mild so this punched up the flavor a bit. I used a convection oven to bake the peppers and even that didn't crisp the bacon as much as I would have liked.  Next time I'll microwave the bacon slightly before I wrap the peppers.  Thanks for the recipe -- I'll make it again and again!

I have made this recipe for three different parties, and each time, have been asked for the recipe.  This is a fantastic appetizer.  I have not been able to make it in less than 60 minutes, so it is time consuming, but worth every second.  A few suggestions:  wear a mask while scrapping the peppers (after about 15 peppers, it has the effects of pepper spray); wear gloves if possible; I used reduced fat sausage and reduced fat cream cheese and it was still delicious; I precook the bacon in the microwave for about 45 seconds (for 8 pieces) to try to reduce the fat and ensure the bacon is not limp after baking.  Enjoy this wonderful recipe!

these are great. I have made them many times now and everyone allways loves them.  To battle the grease issue I partially cook the bacon in the microwave on paper towels first. This also helps to get the bacon nice and brown quicker in the oven.

These were sooo good.  You will need more bacon than listed (consider 30 jalapenos cut in half=60 individual appetizers=60 bacon 1/2's) and they do take time, but so worth it!

Made these for a Super Bowl Party. A huge hit. They were gone before some of the guests even arrived. My daughter said a friend of hers makes them all the time. She soaks the bacon in honey before she wraps the peppers. That sounds really good too. This will be a repeat recipe for sure! 
Addition Sept. 4, 2005...I made 100 of these yesterday for a golf party. I made them w/o the sausage. I dipped the bacon in honey before wrapping the peppers. OMG they were soooo good! They were gone before my husband even got any. I ended up making another batch today just so he could have some. I'm sure these will be requested quite often.

I have to admit I got confused by the directions.  It said it made 60 appetizers, but cutting bacon in HALF only yields 30 slices.  Whatever.  They got average reviews from our Super Bowl guests, but have inspired me to venture out on my own and create something better.  So thanks for that!

Made these for New Year's and they kicked butt!!!
I did need an extra pack of bacon and they were a touch greasy. Next time I will use a rack or some crumpled foil. Also I cooked them longer than the recipe stated. YUMMY!! Everyone wants the recipe.

These were gone so fast and I've gotten several requests for the recipe.  I made about 80 of these, so I put 1/2 in the freezer.  They froze wonderfully.  I took put them in the oven straight out of the freezer on 425 for about 1/2 hour. Then on broil for a min to crisp the top.  The bacon needs to be pre-cooked a few minutes in the microwave.

Great start!!  Love homemade Jalapeno Poppers.  My basic recipe (from my daughter-in-law, Nicole) has 2-3 dozen jalapeno's capped and scooped (unless you have LONG scooper, they're still going to be rip-the-top-of-your-head-off HOT),  cream cheese (softened), cheddar-jack grated cheese and chopped green onions and bacon bits.  I like this approach better (capped and sliced lengthwise) as it gets most of the "hot" out.  Put the cream cheese in a bowl to soften.  Put the jalapeno's in the oven for 15 min on a baking sheet (pre-cooks the peppers-keeps them from being soggy), cook and drain the sausage.  Mix the cream cheese, sausage, shreded cheese, stuff the jalapenos and wrap in bacon.  Cook for 20-30 min on parchment paper-lined baking sheet until bacon is done.  Excellent!!

I'm only giving these four stars because the recipe itself needs to be changed to say that 1 lb. of bacon cut in half is NOT enough. NOT, I say. I cut mine into thirds and it STILL wasn't enough. So tomorrow I have to run out and buy more bacon to finish this recipe. That, as they say, is a drag. I went ahead and made what I could with what I had, and will make more because they are delicious! (But it would have been better if I'd had what I needed from the start). My son has a lovely Mexican girlfriend and she and her brother were here this afternoon as I was making them, and they asked for seconds and thirds, so I'm taking that as a good sign that they were a hit! They aren't too spicy, which is fine for me. People who like them hotter could use spicier sausage (as recommended by someone else), but for most people, these shouldn't be a problem. I personally wouldn't change the recipe, except to let everyone know to buy two pounds of bacon and I did let mine cook about 5 minutes longer (I like my bacon well done) and then put them under the broiler...it just makes them look more appetizing, in my opinion. But other than that, I think these are wonderful! I've had great luck with putting things like this in my crockpot on low or keep warm to use for serving at parties, and will do that with these. They're little mouthfuls of heaven!

These are my most asked for appetizer.  I add a half an onion to the cooking sausage and while the sausage is still hot I add the cream cheese to it with my hands; then stuff, wrap and bake.  Be sure to make enough.

After making this as directed, I now make this with 1 pkg FF cream cheese, 6 links turkey sausage ground up (try a few pulses of the food processor), 1 small bag of Real bacon bits, 1 cup shredded cheddar, 1 minced jalapeno, and 1/2-1 tsp kosher salt to balance out the sweetness of the cream cheese. I mix it all together, put in in a zip-lock and squeeze it into the jalapeno halves. Try 15, cut in half to make 30 pieces. It all depends on the size of your jalapenos. 10 mins in the oven and done! If the peppers are not spicy enough, sprinkle the tops with a bit of cayenne! These modifications keep the flavor of the recipe intact, and make prep a lot easier. Thanks for the recipe!

I get many compliments on my food - but this is raved about and asked for again and again.  I do a few tweaks as suggested by others: add cumin, chili powder, and shredded cheddar to the cream cheese mixture.   I also do not wrap the bacon - far easier to cook the bacon first and then place a piece of bacon on top of each jalapeno (bacon hats I call them) - no wrapping and no toothpicks to mess with!  And warm honey can be drizzled on the bacon if desired.  Then bake.

I've been making these for years.  In Texas, serving stuffed jalapenos are a must.  You can also substitute shrimp, crab, etc for the sausage.

These poppers were excellent.  The only change I did was to add a cup of cheddar cheese to the mixture.  I think that using 40 jalapenos would use all the stuffing mixture as I did have some leftover.  Using a melon scooper as others have stated is a great tips in scooping out the seeds inside the jalapenos.  Will definitely make again.

To Cindy who originally posted this recipe, girl, you know we do EVERYTHING BIG in Texas! LOL!!!   -This is one of my favorite things to snack on while sipping on some Pinot Grigo wine whenever I am winding down on a Saturday afternoon after cleaning my house. Listening to some oldies but goodies music makes me ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!  Anyhow, the recipe is certainly worth saving as I use it often. THANKS!

A favorite for all! They are really easy to freeze also. Once frozen you can put them in a freezer bag & pull as many out as you want & have for an appetizer before dinner. I made some small preparation changes NOT any changes to the ingredients. 2 diferent things to do w/ the bacon: I like my bacon CRISPY cooked the bacon in the oven as much as I could so that it was still manageable to wrap. After par-cooking bacon in the oven cut the bacon in half. If half a slice is too short to wrap cut on an angle in half. OR I have found the wrapping of bacon can get messy & time consuming, SO... I cut pieces of bacon the size of the (length) of the jalapeno and place it on top. The bacon goes along way & it is less time consuming. Toothpick the whole stack & you are good to go!

Took these to a pre-wedding party for the bride & groom last week.  The peppers disappeared in 10 minutes & I was asked if I had anymore!  I allowed our 15yr old son & his friend to sample one each, before taking them to the party.  Both kids are nagging me to make some more.

I thought I had planted too many jalapeno pepper plants... Trying this recipe makes me think ... I did't plant enough! Great recipe!  I didn't have bacon so I used canadian bacon .

Okay, we've made these a few  times now and I would like to pass on a couple of valuable tips. 

Instead of trying to wrap the bacon around the pepper, just cut a smaller piece and lay it securely on top of the stuffed pepper and pierce it with the toothpick to hold it in place. You can even fold it over if the bacon is too wide. It is SO much easier and cheaper to do it that way, and you still get plenty of bacon flavor. Also, it does help to pre-cook the bacon for a minute or two prior to using it. 

Also, we discovered that if you add some taco seasoning to the sausage, it really kicks up the flavor even more. We added sharp cheddar cheese and cut back on the cream cheese which really helped. That will now be our standard stuffed jalapeno recipe.

We made about 100 of these for a wedding recently and they disappeared within an hour. Everybody raved!

This recipe is a keeper.  I followed someones advice to halve and clean the jalapenos under cold water - that worked very well. I wore gloves and did not have any trouble with fumes. I cleaned the peppers the day before I needed them and waited to stuff and wrap them till the next day. I only used one pound of sausage - added a cup of chedar cheese, a little onion powder and some siracha (hot chili sauce). I had only cleaned 25 peppers and I did not have enough filling for all of the peppers - I used 2 1/2 pounds of bacon. Brushed the bacon with honey before baking - broiled the last few minutes. It was the first appetizer gone and I had several requests for the recipe. When I cleaned the peppers I removed all of the seeds and ribs - there wasn't hardly any heat so even those who don't like spicy foods were able to try them. The only downfall was the time it takes to prepare them - well over 2 hours.

It was a great hit at my friend’s party. I added ground red pepper and hot sausage to the mix. Broiling the last two minutes was a great tip. You defiantly need more jalapenos and bacon than described. I live in TX so I have had this dish all different ways; but we all agree this is the best recipe. Nice and HOT!!!!

It is time consuming - but worth it!  Followed directions exactly except I put them on a rack in the baking pan so they wouldn't be greasy and like others I put them under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to cook the bacon more.  These can be made a day ahead of time and then just heated up in the micro.  They taste just as good!  Thanks so much submitter.  P.S.  Surprisingly we did not find them to be as spicy as we thought they would be.  Next time I might use some spicy sausage to kick it up a notch!

I have made this recipe a ton of times and everyone loves it! I also struggled with soft bacon so I kept tweaking it. I do not wrap them in bacon anymore. Instead, while they are cooking I fry and crumble the bacon. I grate 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese into a bowl and then add the (cooled) bacon. The last five minutes of baking I add the cheese and bacon mixture to the top of the peppers and broil for a few minutes. This is the best way I have found to get the crunch of the bacon.

Excellent recipe but needs clarification as to cook time and fill amount.  I followed the recipe exactly and these are my findings:

1)  FILL AMOUNT:  Very hard to fill 60 half jalapenos without knowing how much to fill them.  My advice would be to fill them so they're more than filled flat but don't try to hump the filling to reconstruct the size of the original jalapeno.  A gentle arc over the top for each one will fill them all.  First time I had too much filling; second time I had too little.  

2)  COOK TIME: The bacon needs far more than 20 minute (like 45 here) to crisp.  Basically after that time I took them out but they were still soggy on one side.  I honestly think you need to turn these to get the bacon crisp.  

I used a large turkey size roasting pan wrapped in foil, and a flat rack sitting on top, so the bacon grease would drain.  You DO NOT want the poppers lying around in the bacon fat or they will not bake, they will attempt to fry and won't get hot enough to do so.  Even on a rack, bacon remained soggy.  I wonder if I should have used higher heat.

Also, with this arrangement I still needed to cook these in two batches.

I used "thick" bacon.  I used "breakfast sausage," locally made, and in a plastic tube, singly wrapped (ie., no casing).  I used fairly large sized jalapenos.  

SUMMARY:  Once you have figured out the cook time and fill level, you will have an excellent jalapeno popper.  Feeds an army.

I made this for a BBQ. I usually make these with blue cheese stuffed in the jalapeno then cooked on the grill. I used the wrapping it with bacon idea I got from this recipe and it was delicious. I baked it for more like 30 minutes instead of 20. the bacon needed to be cooked longer. VERY YUMMY!!!!

They were are big hit the only problem was the time it took to make them. The recipe needs to be fixed a little for the bacon and I also precooked it a little to help speed up overall cooking time. I made them for a large party after doing 180 of them the only way i will do them again is in small batches. They were great just take a little to long for big partys.

This was just okay for us.  I ended up adding cumin and taco seasoning to spice it up some.  It was just for our family so I just placed the bacon on top rather than wrapping and I think is actually a good way to go.  This was after putting the bacon in the microwave as others had suggested.  It was good after our own favorite seasonings and will make it again with these additions.

These were spicier than I thought, but still delicious.  I sent my husband out for jalepenos, and of course he picked out the biggest ones instead of the appetizer-size ones, but I wrapped them in a whole slice of bacon and ate it with a ford instead.  They were delicious!

These were a hit at the superbowl party I made them for. I like that it is easy to make seperate batches of filling depending on how spicy your guests like it. I seperated the filling into two bowls and added ALL the jalapeno seeds to one bowl and kept the other one seedless. This way all the guests could eat them.

I made this the first time last year for a Superbowl party. Every time I make it, I'm always asked for the recipe. This is a sure hit! I don't wrap the peppers in bacon as some of the bacon doesn't get crispy, I lay a cut piece of bacon on top of the pepper and filling. I also brush the bacon with a little bit of honey. The spicy/salty/sweet combo is fantastic. Follow the others' tips...always wear gloves and dig the seeds out while holding the pepper under cold water.

We've made these for years, but as a suggestion, instead of regular cream cheese, use pineapple cream cheese.  OH so good.  My husband thought I was crazy years ago when I did this, but him and his friends will not even make them now without the pineapple cream cheese.  Everyone loves them, from kids to adults.

Great recipe - but wear gloves!  My hands have been burning for the past few hours. They hurt.  WEAR GLOVES!  As for the recipe, I prefer a little less sausage and a little more cream cheese.

This recipe is GOOD. My Dad handed on one like this to me a time ago. To make this perfect change a couple things. Same idea just a little differant. First use pineapple cream cheese or even strawberry. Use maple sausage and maple bacon. DON'T cut peppers in half, just cut tops off and gut with small knife. Rinse with out with water and stuff with mix. Use a full slice of bacon per pepper. Start at middle of pepper then over open end and back to middle on same side then wrap around and secure with toothpick. Will be tricky. Cook on grill or smoker.You have to babysit them on grill but they are worth the effort. As for how spicy a pepper is good luck, you never know what you will get, I have found though when the pepper has black in the skin it is warmer or HOT. I can't imagine this cooked in an oven but I guess it could work. I haven't met anyone who didn't love this. This is requested alot.

My guests loved these.  I thought they were very easy to make.  I added a little garlic to the cream cheese. Used the broiler the last 4 minutes as suggested in comments.  I had quite a bit of the mixture left... needed more jalapenos! hint: I used disposable aluminum foil broiler pans (3 for 2.oo) made for easy clean up and worked well for these!

These were extremely good.  However next time I would keep the seeds in since this was not spicy at all and I like hot foods.  I just used my fingers to insert the filling into the jalapenos, it was a lot easier than using a spoon or knife.  These went over well at the party I took them to.  I only made 1/5 the recipe.  There was a lot of the beef and cream cheese left over so I would scale that down.  I too used twice the amount of bacon.

I made these for a Super Bowl party.  I'm only going to give this recipe a 3 as it was extremely time consuming.  I cannot eat jalapenos and have never dealt with them so if you are like me, here's my hint - WEAR GLOVES or don't touch your face, even AFTER washing your hands.  I wish I would have cut the bacon lengthwise as they would have been easier to wrap.  And as others have said, 1 pound of bacon is not enough no matter how you slice it.  
Everyone at the party said they were ok but raved more about my marshmallow popcorn (which came right out of a box)and only took 5 minutes to make.

I fixed these and took to a party.  I added green onion and garlic to the sausage/cream cheese mixture.  I baked them on a wire rack in the oven to get rid of some of the grease.  They were wonderful.  Needless to say, my treats were the first to go.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

I also made this for a New Year's party. I,too,followed the solid advice about precooking the bacon and using a ziplock freezer bag to pipe in the cheese mixture. I also used hot sausage.  Needless to say, they were a HUGE hit!  People were tracking me down for the recipe.

These were very good, a big hit at the party I brought them too but VERY time consuming. It took me an hour and a half to make these (not including cooking time!) Depending on what your tolerancy to heat is these weren't that hot, but they did have a little kick to them. I used light onion and chives cream cheese which added a nice flavor. I did end up with extra (almost half) of the cream cheese/sausage mixture, which I will use for another recipe. I don't think I will make these again even though they were delicious but because of how time consuming they were.

I made about 60 of these without the sausage. I didn't really think it was anything special, however at the Superbowl party I took these to, they were gone before half-time!

CAUTION: Make sure you wear gloves! I didn't, and my hands felt like they were on fire, for 24 hours straight! I do not wish this pain upon anyone! None of the remedies I tried (soaking in milk, vegetable oil, rubbing alcohol, lotion) worked. Just pure pain. Make sure you wear plastic gloves!

delicious!  Did everything lowfat (sweet turkey sausage, lowfat cream cheese, 1/3 slice of bacon to cover the top lenthg of jalapeno).  Absolutely the hit of the party!  Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice and it was recommended by my son. These were made while camping using indirect heat on our BBQ grill. I cooked them on aluminum pans so no clean up. 
These did take longer than the 60 minutes but the second time I prepped the jalapeños at home. I used hot Chorizo from my favorite butcher and it was not hot at all. The next time I make these, I will precook the bacon so it will crisp a little faster. 
No one in camp was disappointed from the youngest 8 year old to us older folks. 
I will definitely make these again using one of the previous tips by precooking the bacon a little before wrapping just to help crisp the bacon. Thanks for the recipe it's awesome.

This is a good basic recipe. I was in a hurry and didn't have time to get to the store to get the exact ingredients, so made this recipe with I had. I used chopped shrimp instead of sausage, used a spinach and artichoke cream cheese and added an 8 oz tub of sour cream. If you like your bacon done, count on leaving it in the oven an extra 10+ minutes to brown up. After loading up all the jalapeños, I still had a bit of the mixture left, so I put it out as a chip dip.  It was all pretty tasty!

I have been making these for years, I sometimes substitute the sausage and use shrimp.  Just fill with cream cheese, place a shrimp on top and wrap with bacon.  I precook the bacon a little so it crisps up with out over cooking the shrimp.

Great recipe...I found a jalapeno baking rack at amazon($14), that lets you cook them upright! Just cut the tops off, core them, stuff, wrap with bacon...enjoy. Also, to help cut down on the grease I partially cooked the bacon in the frying pan, then used a paper towel to soak up the excess grease before wrapping around the pepper.Yummy:)

SOOOO rocking good! I put a little tiny bit of maple syrup on top of each popper before putting them in the oven. It made them the perfect mix of salty and sweet. Can't stop eating these!

SO GOOD!!! Stuffing jalapenos is what I call a labor of food love, but this recipe is worth the time and effort. I cut the recipe in half for two of us, but I accidentally used a full piece of bacon on each jalapeno, which, as my husband said, was not a bad mistake at all. The jalapenos at the market happened to be huge, so a full piece of bacon covered each half perfectly without toothpicks. To the cream cheese mixture I added ground garlic and onion, salt, cilantro, green onion, and some shredded cheddar cheese. I baked these on a rack at 375 degrees for about 55 minutes. I was concerned that the cream cheese filling would run out, but it did not. 

For those who have not worked with fresh chilies before, get yourself a box of rubber gloves before you make this recipe. I also wear glasses and sometimes wear a mask over my nose and mouth if the chilies are particularly hot. Cutting them under water is an excellent method. I find that with a glove on, I can easily scrape the insides out with my thumbnail. You don't fully respect the power of these little guys until they hurt you, and then the pain lasts for hours. This includes touching them and inhaling the fumes. Beware that they have oils in them so that even after you wash your hands, you can still rub your eye and be in trouble. I have learned all of this the hard way. Just be cautious!

Thanks so much for the excellent recipe. These are a real treat!!

This was so good.  I used the precooked bacon which worked out great and made it so much quicker to prepare.  This  was a favorite for my friend. Keep in mind you much use gloves when preparing peppers.

I made these per the recipe once so far and they were a bit hit.   Even my 8 yr-old grand-daughter liked them!  Ratrher than wrap the pepper with bacon, I cut the bacon in pieces just long enough to cover the pepper and laid it in top.  Fewer calories and still had the bacon flavor.  I'll be making them again this weekend.  This time I'm going to add some cheddar cheese as suggested below and will use one package of regular and one package of hot sausage to add a little more punch.

Yeaaa these were pretty awesome! Took the advice of others and pre-cooked the bacon so it could be cooked all the way through with the finished product.  Lots of time and love goes into making these, but they are awesome! YUM.

Simply Amazing! I made these for our office potluck. I was new and wanted to make a good impression. They were the crowd favorite and now I'm recognized as jalapeno popper Nancy, lol. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I did add 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper and 4 chopped green onions to the cheese mix as well as precooked the bacon and brushed a bit of honey to it before wrapping it. I found the wrapping the pepper with the precooked bacon was a bit difficult, so I ended up just placing a strip lengthwise on top of the jalapeno. Still looked, smelled, and tasted amazingly! Now there is no turning back with requests for these at every company event.

Good make-ahead appetizer!  I assembled them and refrigerated them overnight, and added 10 minutes to the cooking time.  I used reduced fat sausage and reduced fat cream cheese. I added a cup of reduced fat shredded cheddar to the filling.
     I didn't wear gloves when cutting the jalapenos.  It wasn't until 30 minutes later that my skin started to burn (for the next 12 hours).  I had to be extremely creative in finding a way to take out my contact lenses! So bottom line, as nice as it is to save a dollar, the gloves are probably a good investment.
     Besides that, I'll make these again.  They'd be good for company and they hold up well in the fridge overnight before baking.  Very attractive little snacks!

I have made these a couple times, they are great! Has anyone ever made these ahead of time and froze them, baking later for a quick appetizer? I was thinking about trying that but am worried they might turn out watery and ruining the whole batch, any suggestions? Thanks!

These are absolutely awesome. I originally left the bacon off because I can never get my bacon to crisp correctly no matter what I wrap (scallops, water chestnuts etc) and they were good. I had some pre-cooked bacon that I chopped up and sprinkled on top and wow... the bacon really makes a difference. Easier to me to just pre-cook the bacon crispy in the oven and then chop it up and sprinkle on top of them. Thanks for the recipe! Making some today!

My family loved these. Never seen a Jalapeno Popper quite like it. Very tasty and full of flavor. I added a few seeds to give it a spicy taste but be very careful to many seeds make it extremely hot.

I will make these Jalapeno Poppers for parties now and sure they will please my friends.

Awesome! Made these for our staff's "Green Eggs and Ham" Breakfast. I used Sage flavored sausage, chive & onion cream cheese and added a little onion soup mix.  Everyone loved them.  Had to make a second batch for home.  They freeze nicely also.  Will definitely be making these again and again.

Since I'm a vegetarian I never know how the dishes I make with meat actually taste until my friends and family tell me and I must say that these poppers were delicious! They disappeared so quickly that I began to blush. These were a great accent to the other dishes at my gathering and I have received request to make more for the next gathering.

These were fantastic! I used one of the custom recipes which has you add the 3 green onions.I also cut the bacon in half and put it in a freezer bag and coated it with a TBSP of brown sugar and let it marinate overnight before wrapping the peppers. Out of this world good!

These are fantastic! Sooo tasty!!! I followed some of the recommendations. I wore gloves while cutting and seeding/veining them. But I suggest a mask over your mouth as I was coughing near the end. I nuked the bacon for 45 seconds on paper towels. (And even with that they're still very greasy. Plus, I didnt' use the sausage, so I can only imagine how greasy they would've been then.) I added about 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar to the cream cheese. I didn't use sausage and I added an extra package of cream cheese to make up for the lesser amount of filling. That made just enough for the 60 halves. I cooked for 20 mins on 350 and then broiled for about 8 mins. I didn't bother with the tooth picks or the honey and only a few of the poppers had the bacon pull back from them. Soo good! Bringing to a Superbowl party tonight (GOOO Steelers!!) Can't wait to see how everyone likes them!

Amazing for dinner. I enjoyed your version and the version with honeyed bacon. The only extra step I made was to set each in a heated pan to crisp the bacon on the bottom, then I placed them in the microwave for 45 seconds to further crisp the rest of it.

Loved the base recipe, thought it needed some cheddar cheese added to mixture.  Probably added 1 cup. On the cutting board where I rolled the bacon, I would first squirt a line of honey on the board then lay the bacon strip on the honey.  This gave a fantastic sweet front end to each bite.  I think I'll add some seeds back into the mixture next time, as it wasn't spicy enough for me.  Overall, I loved them.

This recipe was exceptional. My husband put these out on the grill, which gave it a crispy-like texture on the bottom. The poppers did not last very long at all. They are not spicy when you take the seeds out. For me, I left in some of the seeds for an extra kick.

Best. Poppers. EVER. Seriously. I have made this for every party I've hosted over the past 2 years and it never gets old. Everyone loves them! I am constantly asked for this recipe so big props to the creator. I usually use turkey bacon, low-fat sausage and low-fat cream cheese to at least save a FEW arteries. But I always add Louisiana hot-sauce. Gotta make that tongue really pop!

Really good! I had to cook mine a about 10 min. longer to get the bacon done, and I did microwave it for about 45 seconds prior, and the peppers were probably a little bigger than I would have preferred, but that's MY issue. Didn't turn out very pretty, but QUITE tasty!

These are the best! Everyone loves them. I bake them on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet to let the fat drip off. I can't wait to have them again. (Double the bacon for 30 peppers)

These are super good!  I added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture before stuffing the peppers.  I placed them under the broiler for a few minutes at the end to crisp up the bacon.  I was even able to flip them over without loosing any filling to crisp up the bacon on the bottom.  I will use a wire rack to bake them next time so they don't sit in grease.  Don't forget to wear gloves... I forgot and paid for it all evening. OUCH!  UPDATE:  I forgot to mention these take quite a bit longer than the 20 minutes stated in the recipe to bake.  This time around I didn't broil, used a wire rack in the pan and it took about 40-45 minutes for the bacon to be cooked well enough.  I would stick to no broiling and the longer cooking time (broiling doesn't cut the time much-it's still at least 30 minutes baking time plus broiling time) so you don't have to mess with turning them over.

The only change I made to this was to use mexican "queso fresco" so that it wouldn't ooze out when cooking. The results were phenomenal. My family could not stop raving about them, including those that don't particularly like jalapenos. Some of them did turn out a bit spicy, but nothing that couldn't be handled.

Always a big hit at the party, and yes people will request you make them.  I use Bob Evans Zesty hot sausage, and they always come out great.
Also, was not happy with the bacon(not being done) so now I bake them let them cool, and bake them again. Whoohoo, perfect bacon everytime.

sure to use rubber gloves when handling peppers. Also, to reduce the "pepper fumes" in the air, fill your sink with water, float the peppers in the water. Working with a sharp knife and a spoon, slice them in half length wise and use the spoon to scoop out the seeds and veins. Do all of this under the water or you will cough

I looooved these. They were a huge hit at my party. Like other reviewers suggested I partially cooked the bacon in the oven and removed it before it got crispy. I found it was easier to work with. I also added 2 cups of cheddar cheese to the cream cheese and sausage mixture. I mixed it all in the food processor which broke down the sausage quite a bit. It was a huge hit.

I had a little get together last night and decided to make these instead of my usual deep fried poppers, which are really good too!  I read the reviews and made a few changes.  First I cut the bacon in half and then by placing a paper towel on a plate, put the bacon down and then another paper towl on top and cooking them in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes.  This removes lots of the grease and decreases the cooking time.  I brushed both sides of the bacon with honey prior to wrapping the jalapenos - this was a great suggestion from a previous reviewer.  To the sausage mix I added 2 or 3 green onions and 3/4 cup cheddar cheese.  They turned out YUMMY!

I use 1lb turkey sausage, 16 oz chive cream cheese, and about 15-20 jalapeños. Definitely cut the bacon in half and precook for 1-2 minutes in the microwave. Just laying the slice on top works best for me as it saves the hassle of securing with a toothpick. I do wear gloves when cleaning the jalapeños, and stand back from the disposal after tossing all those seeds down it before turning it on too; but I am sensitive to it.

Everyone loved these! However I did follow others advice 1)use a melon ball scooper, makes it so easy 2) scoop out under running water 3) putting honey on the bacon is a must!! It gave it that great spicy/sweet flavor. If you have convection cooking it cooked the bacon wonderfully. I think next time I will put in more cream cheese or some sharp cheddar.

Excellent!  I've had this recipe before without the meat in the cream cheese and would never go back.  My husband is not a big fan of cream cheese so I was happy when I stumbled across this recipe.  I too precooked the bacon, added a little groud cumin and chile powder to the mixture. I only made 1/2 the recipe and just laid the bacon on top.  Also, I used a grapefruit spoon to clean out the peppers.  It really speeded up the process.

I have made these and they are so good, always get snapped up quickly.   One idea: Sometimes I toss in some cumin seeds with the cream cheese mixture and it adds a nice extra  flavour.

These were really good! I halved the recipe, however I needed a full pound of bacon in order to wrap all of the jalapenos. It really makes a lot... for our Super Bowl gathering we had 8 people and mostly everyone only ate one or two, so we had a lot left over. I would reccommend using this recipe for a larger party, but everyone said they liked them.

Extremely tasty, but not as spicy as I thought they would be. Next time I will add spicy sausage instead of regular. I also precooked the bacon a bit so it crisped up quickly.  Will definitely make again.

I went to a party and the host put these on the BBQ. It was EVEN better because all the fat dripped off and the chilis got really soft. Let them cool a bit before eating~the filling gets pretty hot!  i used the light cream cheese and put it into a baggie and cut the tip off so i could pipe the cream cheese/sausage mixture into the chili.  i also cut the bacon strips in 1/2, cooked them partially in the micro to get some of the fat off and just placed the bacon strip on top of the peppers. using the broiler for the last few minutes was a good idea to get them crisp.  oh yes, WEAR GLOVES while handling the peppers!

These were delicious - a big hit at the party I took them to.  Instead of wrapping them in bacon, I added crumbled pre-cooked bacon to the cream cheese mixture.  I also cut each pepper half in half again and stuffed them that way so they were more like little bites!

WOW, excellent- thanks 4 a great recipe:)HUGE hit at a party, I made over 100 of them and it was VERY time consuming, I will make these again, soon! However I will definately search for pre sliced/seeding peppers. Made a few adjustments because I was concerned w/ grease as others had suggested they were and I've had poppers that were very greasy.  Made them w/ fat free cream cheese, used ground pork, after stuffing I pushed them face down in velveeta shreds, then wrapped w/ turkey bacon, then dipped in egg/milk mixture then taco seasoned bread crumbs and baked- Excellent, thanks again.

People always ask to make sure I bring these to BBQs. They are so delicious. Everyone is always surprised to fine the sausage in the cream cheese. If you have a mixer I have found that's the easiest way to mix the cream cheese and sausage. If you cream cheese hasn't thawed added the warm sausage to it and it will mix very easily.

I love this appetizer. They always go so fast. Make sure to wear gloves as your hands will burn for hours. I like to cut the bacon long ways to make sure it wraps around it. This last time s just cut them down the middle and laid them on top.

I made these two nights in a row. The fist night was for a BBQ, the next night just for my family. I used onion and chive flavored cream cheese and barbequed them on medium-low until the bacon was crispy. I also used whole slices bacon. They were amazing.

These were ok. My family ate some of them, but a lot were left over. Very good advice about wearing gloves when getting the seeds out of the jalapenos, and doing so under water. My daughter was the one cutting and cleaning them without gloves. Poor baby looked like she was sprayed with pepper spray for hours. Both of our hands were also burning for hours. So not worth the end result imo.

These were a huge hit at our New Years Party. Contrary to what others say I found these very easy to make and it took little time. The longest part is cleaning the peppers. Be sure to where gloves and clean out all those seeds. This are yummy and I will make again. I did add a small bit of cheddar cheese at the bottom of a few of the peppers before putting in the stuffing mix and instead of wrapping them with bacon, I just topped them with a small slice of bacon and let the bacon brown on top,. Yummy indeed.

These turned out GREAT!!!  I made them for a party my wife I were invited to where we didn't know very many people.  I made a lot of new friends by sharing the recipe!  I followed a few tips from other posters that helped:  I cleaned the jalapenos under water in a dish, I microwaved the bacon to get it started, I put a touch of honey on the bacon as well (you could taste the touch of sweetness), and I broiled the poppers for 5 minutes after the suggested 20 minutes of cook time, which made my bacon a bit crisper and gave a better presentation.  Some advice though, be careful washing any dishes the jalapenos touch.  The next day I washed the bowl (without gloves) that I cleaned them in and my hands burned for over an hour.  :)

I am making these wonderful poppers as I write this. I go to a neighborhood bar on the weekends to watch football. About a year ago I brought these poppers and WOW what a response. These and my banana cupcakes are the most requested things that I make. When I get there at about 3:00 today it will be standing room only. The owner of the bar lets me bring them (even though he has a kitchen and serves "bar food") because they are so popular and he does a ton of business because I bring good eats.

I just tried this recipe and I was really surprised how easy it was. I halved the recipe because it was just me and my son that will eat them. I added a little ranch dressing mix and diced red, orange, and yellow bell pepper only because I had it sitting in the fridge. I think the additions for this recipe are only limited by your imagination. I followed other reviewers ideas about microwaving the bacon first. Easy to do and delicious. Thanks for this keeper.

I have been making these for years! They are excellent.We call them Armadillo Eggs because we use a whole slice of bacon to wrap them, and when they cook down in the oven the look like egg shaped armadillo shells, lol. Also have found at my parties that the guys love to pile these on a burger!
 The nice thing is if you are making them for people who can't handle jalapenos, you can substitute any kind of peppers. I have used banana peppers, goat horns, anahiems, pablanos, anything. The pablanos are hotter than a bell pepper but not a great deal, they are much larger, we have made them as an entree!

I have been making this for years, Except I make a lowfat version. Use Honeysuckle White Breakfast Turkey Sausage (comes in rolls) and Fat Free Cream Cheese. And the lowest fat bacon (but real bacon) that you can find. It comes out better, I think and you don't feel so guilty!

Everyone loves them!  I cannot make enough!!  Two things I do is only add half the sausage and bake them on a rack.  The rack allows the bacon grease to drop down and the bacon to cook better all the way around instead of becoming greasy.

These get consumed so fast I'm not sure I've even tried one!
After running out of bacon, I put the remaining spread in a bowl and stuck halved jalapeño shells in as dippers-for those that like it really hot!

I make a version of this but I use Jimmy Dean hot sausage, chop it up in skillet as it is browning, I mix the cream cheese and add 1/2 pack of real bacon bits instead of wrapping it with bacon. I don't like them real hot so I also scrape the white membrane from the pepper under cold water. Once you start eating these you will not want to stop until they are all gone.

This was fantastic. Very huge hit at the party. I listened to others and brushed honey all over the bacon as well as microwaved the bacon for a min. Awesome dish

Fixed these for our Church BBQ. I made them the night before and then put them on a charcoal grill with very low heat, to keep them from burning and just enough heat to warm them up. Everyone just loved them. The hardest part was cleaning the peppers and getting all the vein out so they wouldn't be so hot no one could eat them. All and all, THEY WERE GREAT !!

These were a hit at our swim party.  I did pre-cook the bacon in the microwave then finished it up in the oven.  There were no leftovers.

I read alot of recipes with sausage so I gave it a try and thought it was awful.  I am used to the Best Ever Jalapeno Poppers that use bacon and a breading.  Bacon bits (the real kind) are SO MUCH better than sausage.  I will stick with bacon.

These are wonderful!!!  I have made these several times and I have taken the suggestions of the other reviews.  I have found the best way to clean and de-seed the peppers is to use a melon baller and for me this is the easiest way to prep the peppers.  I have also added some cayenne pepper to the cream cheese and sausage mixture.  I also pre-cook the microwave for just a few minutes prior to wrapping the peppers.  I have also drizzled honey over the peppers prior to baking in the oven and have always received rave reviews.

I love this recipe. The peppers are not too spicy for the kids with the yummy cream cheese inside. Definitely use 1/2 slices of bacon (1/3 if very fatty) so the bacon flavor won't overpower the other ingredients.

This recipe is amazing. I've made it twice already in less than two weeks. My boyfriend loves spicy food (and bacon!) so it's his new appetizer favorite. I made it the first time with ground sausage and the second time with ground beef. Both were delicious. I preferred the ground beef because I added cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. It gave it even more kick. This is a great recipe and I know I'll use it many more times!

Big hit at my house. Even those that don't like stuffed peppers really enjoyed. 

The bacon takes a while to get brown so be careful an watch your cheese.

Made these today for the first time....delicious!! My children loved them!! Thanks to the person who suggested soaking the peppers in cold water...I added ice to the water and had no problems with the fumes from the peppers. Thanks for sharing this recipe....will definitely do these again for an upcoming event next weekend.

Great appetizer. I've made several different versions of these over the past year. If you really like the heat, you can even use a hotter type of pepper such as serrano, which are always available and fairly cheap at my local grocery stores. To add some extra flavor to the filling, try adding some Cajun seasoning to the mixture.

time consuming but definitely worth the ooos & awwws.  definitely used gloves to seed the jalepeno and cooked the bacon first on the stove & then used a broiling pan in the oven to drain the remaining fat from the bacon to make it extra crispy.  to me, this recipe is very plain so i added more ingredients to make it spicy but JEEZ they still werent spicy!  any suggestions?

I made this for the Super Bowl get together at our house. I followed the directions, but did cook the cut bacon in the microwave for 45 seconds at the beginning before I put around the stuffed jalapeno. I did have to add an extra 15 minutes to the original time just so that the bacon was more done and the jalapeno's were tender. Everyone ate them, and they weren't hard to make at all. If you leave a few seeds in each one it will give it more heat, than if you completely take them all out. It's whatever you like. They are hotter if alot of seeds are left in though. Will make again.

These were yummy!  I followed the advice of pre-cooking the bacon some and using a rack in the oven and the were not greasy.  My only problem was that some of the jalapenos were really hot and some had no spice - and you never knew which you were going to get!  I will definitely make these again with the jalapenos from my garden!

Awesome! We made half of the recipe and it came out great! What a great app for a party. We wanted to try it at home first. Used some spicy patties from the grocery store and it was great!  Highly recommended!

Very labor intensive, but worth it. I made mine the day before and just refrigerated them uncooked and that caused no problems. I added some cheddar and green onions like other reviews suggested and they turned out amazing! I've never had a recipe be the star of a bbq and everyone asked for the recipe but this one did the trick. We cooked 1/2 on the grill (indirect heat) and 1/2 in the oven. The ones on the grill cooked faster (about 10 minutes) and had a nice grill taste to them. But the ones from the oven definitely weren't snubbed. I scrapped the peppers clean of seeds and white ribbing and they turned out very mild - like we like them. Wear rubber gloves and eye protection when scraping out the jalapenos! You'll be sorry if you don't. It took me about 2 hours to prepare 60 of these, so these will probably only come out on special occasions.

Every time I serve these at a party they get gobbled up before I can get seconds. Everyone loves them! I made them just as the recipe said and they were perfect!

This was a huge hit at the super bowl party! Everyone loved them. I took the leftovers to work the next day and everyone raved about them there too. Followed the recipe except I bought 20 jalapeno's instead of 30 which worked out perfect with the amount of filling it made.

I made these for a Super Bowl party this year and they were gone before halftime! I used HOT italian sausage and sprinkled some shredded sharp chedder cheese on the filling before wrapping them with bacon. I also made them in the morning and refridgerated them all day until the game. I definitely think you could even make them a day in advance.   I was curious as to how they would freeze, so I put a couple in the freezer and took them out the other day and baked them for a snack. They hold up great in the freezer! Next time I make these, I will double the recipe and freeze half of them!

So many of my guests asked for this recipe.  I thought it was good, but I usually eat really healthy food.  Maybe mentally I couldn't give it 5 stars.  They were greasy from the bacon (which I precooked in the mirco due to other comments) so next time I will put them on the broiler pan so the grease can drip down to the pan below.  Still great, perfect for superbowl!

2.36 stars from me. I made these for the superbowl. The first problem I had was getting the cream cheese mixture into the pepper. I ended up piping the mixture out of a tape-reinforced ziploc bag. I would recommend using a broiler pan so the grease from the bacon can drip away. I noticed the peppers ended up neither raw nor cooked after the bacon was done which both made the product difficult to hold and lent to the poor texture. As far as modifications go, soaking the bacon in honey doesn't really add much except to the mess. I tried frying a few and they tasted better than the baked ones (natch), but still would have been better if they were breaded.

Just made these for the first time and they were a hit! I followed the recipe for 10 servings and used Italian Sausage. Tip: wear gloves and put the jalapenos in a bowl of water when removing the inside. I used bare hands and experienced some burning sensation around fingertips.

I've been eating these for years, and I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. If I could give more stars I would. Today is SuperBowl Sunday (Go COLTS!), and I think I may try brushing this batch with honey before baking them.

This is very close to my standard Popper recipe (currently peanut butter stuff is my favorite). I normally cut the amount of sausage, cream cheese, and bacon in half. For those that say these are a bit greasy you are correct. What I do to prevent this; instead of cutting the jalapeno in half, just cut the top and use a spoon to rake out the seeds, if you have one, you can use a jalapeno corer. Then stuff the mixture inside the jalapeno and wrap the whole jalapeno in a half a slice of bacon, hold with toothpick, and cook as directed flipping the jalapenos once. This keeps the bacon grease from getting in the stuffing.

Yum yum yum!! This is the first time I've seen this recipe with the 'bonus' sausage & it really did put something special in the dish. A total hit that was simple enough to make. Definitely being added to my appetizer list!

These are a great appetizer.  As the recipe reads, they will come out greasy and take a lot longer in the oven than stated.  Save yourself a lot of work:  Par cook 5 slices of bacon at a time for 3 1/2  minutes in the microwave.  Cut each pice of  par-cooked bacon in half.  Lay a half slice of bacon on top of each prepared jalapeno.  Cook in oven until bacon is browned to your liking.  The jalapenos will still be crunchy.  No messing with toothpicks and much of the bacon grease will be eliminated.  Also good stuffed with plain shredded mozzarella instead of the cream cheese mixture.  I will post a picture of some made this way.

I have been making these for a while and they are ALWAYS a hit...I get requests for them everytime I have a get together...the only thing I do differently is add about 3/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese to the cream cheese and sausage mixture...it makes them even more scrumptious!

These were delicious.  I cut the ingedients in half but still needed about 20 peppers.  I used the center cut bacon which I microwaved for 45 seconds and then brushed w/honey and cut the pieces in half.  I also added a 1/4 cup of sharp cheese.  They were a hit at the super bowl party.  I will definitely make agian.

After all the rave reviews we made this for the Super Bowl. My husband & I were excited b/c we both love jalapeno poppers. However, these were nowhere near as yummy as we expected. They were kind of bland & too much sausage. I may try this again and alter the recipe w/more cheese & less sausage. I did take other's suggestions and used gloves and soaked peppers in water while working with them. Thanks for the tip.

First off, I followed the recipe completely. I have no doubt these came out of the oven tasting exactly as they should. However, with that being said, I can't say I really care for them. The Cream Cheese just made these too rich to enjoy. I'd like to recommend that people who attempt this recipe for the first time go really easy on the sausage/cheese mixture per Pepper half. I didn't love the few I made with less stuffing, but they went down easier than those that liberally stuffed to match the recipe picture.

I make these any chance i have but just a bit different. I put Cajun power and a bit of garlic powder in the cream cheese and mix, wrap in bacon place on foil and cook on the grill until the bacon is done. just before removing from the grill sprinkle with Mexican cheese and leave on for another minute. They dont last very long!

I've made these several times now and they've always been a hit.  The first time I used hot sausage and they were a little too spicy for my tastes so the next time I made them I used a pack of hot and a pack of regular sausage.  Perfect!

I NEVER make enough of this!!  No matter how much I make they disappear quickly.  Men especially love these poppers, I've caught them hovering around the tray eating them before they even hit their plate!!  Although I read some of the tips from others, I just make the poppers according to the recipe and love it. Very easy and yummy!

I hate to be the one to go against the grain...in fact, I tried this recipe originally because of the rave reviews; and the fact that I had a TON of jalapenos from my garden (still have jalapeno jelly canned from last year).  I must say, I was not nearly as impressed as everyone else.  These were EXTREMELY greasy!  And I even baked them on a rack to keep them out of the grease.  As the bacon cooked around them, all of that grease soaked into the filling.  I suppose to people who love bacon, and greasy fried foods, this is a hit; but for me it just made me kind of sick to my stomach.  Sorry, but I don't think I'll try this one again.

I thought these were great.  I used pineapple cream cheese and they flew off the table at the last football party!  The combination of sweet, salty and heat went really well together!  I didn't use sausage at all.

Great, Great Recipe!  I have made them three times and people beg for the recipe.  I have tweaked them each time, but in general I change it by adding chipotle seasoning to the sausage, cayenne pepper to the cream cheese, some shredded cheddar to the cream cheese AND melted on top, added scallions to the cream cheese filling and added a little honey on top of the bacon strips (befor e the cheddar)just to see how it was....all good!  This is my first ever review --- it was so good, I had to write about!

Love this recipe - and now I have to make it during every TN Titans game!  However, I make it using turkey sausage and turkey bacon (tastes better and A LOT less greasy!!!)  Also, I use fat-free cream cheese and add a little fat free cheddar cheese to the mixture and it has gotten great reviews!!!  Don't hesitate to try it!!

I took everyone's word that these were fabulous and took them the first time I made them to a BBQ with some very picky people. They were a HUGE hit. If you vary the sausage you can get a different taste every time, but always delicious!

My whole family has been making these since before I can remember and they are the best. We always add some chedder( when My dad eats them he wants sharp) to the sausage/cream cheese mix. I always thought it was a family recipe, but its so good I guess its not a bad things that everyone else can have the recipe too.

Outstanding! I have made these twice now and I should have made more both times.  A couple suggestions...definitely precook the bacon before wrapping.  I lay each slice out on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven at 400 for 6 minutes.  I also add 3 sliced green onions and about 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese to the sausage mixture.  I do put them on a rack when cooking and I also use convection baking. Delicious!

I have made these 3 times now for partys and they are the only thing on teh table that's completely gone! Everyone LOVES them and will be a constant request. After browning some original Jimmy Dean sausage I add the cream cheese and a can of original Rotel. Then I wrap them in Maple bacon and drizzile with a little bit of honet before putting in the oven to give it a spicy sweet flavor. I also have to cook about 10-15 min longer than it says. Definiely mircowave the bacon a little before wrapping, DELISH!!!

I had never bought fresh jalapeños before, and the various peppers at the grocery store were not labeled, so I ended up with what I think were poblano peppers (long skinny green peppers that were slightly hot).  I had to slightly increase the amount of sausage and cream cheese because the peppers were larger than jalapeños.  To make them spicier, I added some chopped canned jalapeños to the sausage/cream cheese mixture.

Delicious!!  My husband, who was doing a low-carb diet, couldn't stop eating them.    He wants to add this to the low-carb rotation.

This was soooo good!  I didn't have a problem at all with the peppers (fumes and such) so dont let that scare you, however if you think you might be sensitive gloves will help.  One thing I found to be EXTREMELY helpful while wrapping was using Turkey Bacon instead of regular.  It crisped up more evenly (using convection) and it was ALOT less greasy!  This one is a keeper!  I'll be making it tomorrow for the playoff games....Go Packers!

These are really good.  Next time, I will fully cook the bacon and crumble it on top of the peppers.  When I wrapped the bacon and then baked, the peppers were overcooked  by the time the bacon was cooked (and I even part cooked the bacon to start with.  The flavor was great, and I will make it again!  Thanks

I made these for a tailagte party and they came out terrific.  I made half with sausage and half without (everyone preferred with sausage).  Left a few seeds in just to give the right amount of heat.  I would highly recommend these as an appetizer...they are time consuming but well worth it.

I made these for a baby shower and they were tasty.  I made a few modifications as suggested by others.  Used hot sausage and microwaved the bacon for about 90 seconds.  I halved the recipe but still used up an entire pound of bacon.  The hardest part was wrapping them in bacon...I got so frustrated that I finally just laid the strip over the top of the jalapeno.  That seemed to work out fine.  I do STRONGLY recommed wearing gloves...I didn't and 3 days later my hands are still burning from handling the jalapenos.   Overall these are good but VERY time consuming to make.

Excellent.  I did 20 peppers, 1 pound sausage,  8 oz cream cheese and 1 cup shredded cheddar with 1-2 T. chili seasoning for the filling. One pound of bacon was perfect. I think the trick on the bacon is to get thin bacon that stretches some - I used Jimmy Dean Original.  I did half of them in oven at 375 and took about 30 minutes.  The other half we smoked on the big green egg. Oh baby so good!

I'm giving this 5 stars and I didn't even eat one...but I made 100 (50 peppers) for a Memorial Day party and they were all gone in an hour.  I grilled mine, open side down first, then flipping over; next time will try broiling.  All jalapeno peppers are not created equal - some are hotter than others.  I don't think it's a good idea to make these in advance (before cooking); some of that "juice" has to get into the cheese mixture and make it hotter.  IMO

Awesome awesome awesome!  I did use gloves for cutting and seeding the peppers which helped a lot.  BUT, be sure not to touch your face at all, and do your best not to breathe while seeding.  I about died until I figured out you need to hold your breath.  Not sure I'll ever make them again because of that, but tastey and as far as heat goes I would say mild.  Don't understand why seeding them was such an issue being as mild as they are - but it is!

These were the first to go on New Years!  They were awesome.  They do take some time to assemble though.  It took my daugter and I a few hours to get them ready for the oven. Next time I would assemble a day early.  I will definatly make them again and again when time permits.

These are so very good.  I used chive and onion cream cheese in the tub, and omitted the sausage.  I cut my peppers in half, seeded and deveined them.  Put the cream cheese on and wrapped half a slice of bacon around it.  I grilled mine outside on the grill.  They were awesome.  Watch out for that bacon grease on the grill though.  Talk about some smoke.......

I made this recipe for a party with jalapenos I grew in my garden.  I couldn't make them fast enough!  It's a little time consuming, and cutting up that many jalapenos (especially when making a double batch), is a little hard on the sinuses, but it's well worth it.  This is one of the best appetizers I think I've ever made!

Holy canoli!  These were awesome!  I made them the night before and popped them in the oven when guests arrived.  I did put them under the broiler for just a minute to really crisp up that bacon.  I'd like to make them again using the cream cheese with chives.

These were excellent.  I found the longer you cooked them, the less spicy the pepper was, so I was able to keep some very hot for the adults and cook a few extra long for the younger kids!

I am making these for the 2nd time in less than a week - just for my husband & myself. I use 12 peppers, 1 lb of hot bulk sausage, 8 oz cream cheese & 6 slices of bacon. Cut the bacon in half length-wise & cross-wise. They are just as good reheated. I will introduce them to "everyone" next week on New Year's Eve. I know they will be a huge hit. Thank you for our new favorite. The best part? They are easy to make. Ya gotta love that! UPDATE: I must have made 100 of these things in the past 2 weeks. My husband is absolutely addicted! And, as expected - everyone loved them on New Year's Eve. Thank you again!

I didn't get rave reviews from my friends on this, as I was expecting.  I couldn't try them myself - I don't eat cream cheese or jalapenos, so I have to count on the feedback I get.  They were a lot of trouble to prepare, and I just got ho-hum "they were good" reviews.   Sorry - I don't think I'll be making these again.

Delicious! I also added in a little garlic and onion powders to the cream cheese mixture and baked them a little longer than called for to crisp them up nicely. These were such a hit that hubby is still talking about them~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Meh, I thought you would have tasted more of the sausage but you really didn't. Think next time instead of regular cream cheese I'll go with the flavored jalapeño cream cheese and omit the sausage. Honestly I have had better poppers than this one.

I use 1/2 pound hot Italian sausage, a combination of regular cream cheese and pineapple cream cheese, green onion and about 1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese for 15 jalapenos (30 poppers).  The best way I have found to wrap with bacon is to microwave a couple of pieces at a time for 45 seconds and then pat off excess grease on paper towels.  I then cut the bacon in half length wise and the in half cross wise giving you 4 pieces out of one slice.  I then rub a little honey on each piece and wrap around pepper and securing with a toothpick.  These freeze well. Bake straight from freezer on foil lined pan for easy clean up.

Tried this as an alternative for my traditional poppers made on the grill. It was eaten, but we felt the sausage was a bit of an overkill for us. Thanks for sharing.

Need to precook bacon more so it gets crispy or turn the jalapeños over carefully and broil on both sides next time. Other than that I used hot sausage which spiced it up a bit and 60 of them were gone in less than 30 minutes so they were a huge hit

These are amazing poppers and huge hit at the party we attended.  I broiled them on a cooling rack, on a cookie sheet, but still ended up have to turn them over to get the bottoms crispy.  Definitely take the extra step and crisp the bottoms.

09-27-15 ~ Another popper recipe we really enjoyed.  I had 9 big jalapeños that need to be used up.  I scaled the recipe back and used eight of them.  The bacon was thick pepper bacon and my DH grilled them rather than baking them.  Loved the added sausage in the cream cheese mixture.  Served with 'Bronco Burgers' from AR and grilled peppers, onions and potatoes. Loved that all items were cooked on the grill. Made for easy-peasy clean up. (5-stars)

My husband LOVES these jalapenos! I've been making these for years now & always mix up the recipe. 
Sometimes I add a blend of three cheeses, other times, after i stuff the pepper, i'll cover the top with shredded mozzarella cheese then proceed to wrap them & sprinkle them with a bit of salt & pepper. 
ENJOY! :)

I made these at a family gathering, and they were AWESOME! Even the little kids loved them. A few tips: they're delicious grilled, but if you bake them, be sure to use a broiler pan or a rack. Boil or partially cook the bacon first, and broil at the end for a few minutes to crisp it up, if necessary. Where gloves through the whole process (my 13 year old was pinching off bits of the raw sausage for me to stuff the peppers, and got completely oogied out by the slimy feeling.) To keep them as mild as possible, but with great flavor, make sure you completely remove ALL the seeds and the ribs. A pretty time-consuming appetizer, but totally worth it. YUMMO!!!!!!

Very good recipe as it is. I have also made this with a few changes-- sour cream instead of cream cheese makes it more savory than sweet, added pepper jack cheese, white cheddar and sharp cheddar into the sausage mix. Added cayenne, cajun, onion powder & minced garlic for more spicy pop. Also wrapped in one whole slice of hickory smoked bacon intead of half & baked on a rack so that they don't sit in juices and get soggy. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this yesterday it was a hit with the family. I did precook bacon in microwave as suggested and that caused shrinkage so I cut the bacon in half and placed over the top.  Worked great. Thanks for the recipe!

his weekend I went on a quest to find the perfect popper.  I cooked up several different batches for a party and this was the favorite stuffing.  The sausage gives the filling a firmer texture and a delicious taste!  I did some of these in the oven and some on the BBQ.  I high recommend the BBQed version!  The BBQ gives the bacon a delicious flavor and really makes these “pop”!

Nice easy popper recipe however I did use shredded cheddar cheese as we do not like a cream cheese popper.
Idea and prep and can be suited to anyone's personal taste.

Tried the recipe and loved the poppers. The second time I forgot to purchase cream cheese.  I substituted Pimento cheese spread and from this point forward I will be using Pimento cheese.  I left out bacon bits; my preference. I also cooked 15 minutes instead of 20 minutes.

These are awesome and are always very popular at parties, if they make it there. We use chorizo for extra spice, and leave off the bacon (we are bacon fanatics, but with the chorizo, it's not really necessary...especially if you plan to eat 10 and don't want to regret the calories even more). Believe it or not, these are awesome if you make them with a good canned jalapeno; the kind that comes in a giant can, pickled with carrots, is the best! The brand name escapes me at the moment. Pickled jalapenos and chorizo together make a *very* spicy combination. I love the idea of honey on the bacon, however, so I think I'll try that next time, with regular sausage instead of chorizo.

I make this however, I put the raw sausage in the jalapenos and sprinkle onion and garlic powder on it...wrap in raw maple bacon...gives great flavor. In the summer we cook them on the grill, in the winter bake in the oven about 375 until sauasage and bacon are cooked and peppers are less hot the longer you cook them.

I like to precook the bacon and crumble it right into the filling as well as adding a little shredded cheese and fresh cilantro if I have it. I precook the jalapenos for just a few minutes before filling them then popping under the broiler until the cheese is bubbly. Problem solved!

This is probably my favorite appetizer. It was served at a party one time and now I'm hooked on making them. I like spicy food, so I keep some seeds in the chile.

I make a version of these also. These were very good but I add freshly grated parmesan to the mixture then spoon onto the peppers. They are almost addictive and there are NEVER leftovers. Also good for those watching their carbs. Not so much for those watching fat intake! But sometimes you just have to splurge!

I LOVE it!  I don't eat a lot of peppers but this was surprising how good it was!  Great to take to a party - make a bunch though, because they disappear fast!

I made these last night for Game Night for the girls.  I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but I was completely unimpressed with these Poppers.  The bacon never did get crispy, the peppers were al dente and they lacked flavor.  I think I would mix an equal amount of sharp chedder and cream cheese to add more flavor.  I used Bob Evans original breakfast sausage, maybe a different sausage?
They have potential but I was really disappointed.

WEAR GLOVES WHEN GUTTING JALAPENOS!!!!

I almost landed myself in ER, my hands burned for 12 hours!

Almost worth it because these were so good.  I see on the picture there is a sharp cheese on it, not included in the recipe... I will try that next time.  The baking time definitely took closer to 45 minutes versus 30, unfortunately.  Next time I will fry up the bacon for a few minutes before wrapping the poppers because it just never got crunchy.  All in all, a great hit.

I made these for the super bowl and they turned out great. Just for personal preference I left out the sausage and added some shreeded cheese, garlic and onion powder to the cream cheese mixture. My boyfriend gobbled them up and barely left any for me! Super yummy!!

I've never had Jalapeno Poppers before & this was delicious!!!  The bacon with the sausage and cream cheese complimented the Jalapenos perfectly.  Definitely a HIT!!!  Update: Made them today with the suggestion of cutting & coring the peppers in water & that worked well, however definitely need to wear gloves, 20mins later & my hands are STILL B-U-R-N-I-N-G!  But they are soooo worth it :)

WONDERFUL! I read other reviews and followed advice by adding about 2 tsp cajun seasoning and brushing honey on the bacon before wrapping. Took it to a Super Bowl party & everyone LOVED them, they went FAST!  One suggestion... I used Oscar Mayer bacon & 1 lb. wasn't quite enough, better buy an additional pack just in case.  And I did cook about 10 minutes longer and broiled a few minutes at the end to make the bacon a little crispier.  Thanks for this AWESOME recipe!

I cooked this several ways (based on the reviews).  They are ok (not great), straight out of the oven, but greasy, greasy.  I even used papertowels to help degrease the sausage.  I wouldn't make these again.

Made these for superbowl and all 40 of them went so fast! These were delicious but you need to add flavor to them.  For 40 of these poppers I used 20 jalapenos, 1 cream cheese, and a few sausage in the casing (i removed the casing).  For the filling I combined the cream cheese and the sausage.  I also added Parmesan  cheese, black pepper, & green onions.  Next time I will add a bit of salt, maybe some onion powder and a minced garlic.  A lot of reviews said it was really greasy - definitely use a higher rack to go on a cookie sheet so the oil can drip down. This really helps cut down the grease.

This was awesome!  Everyone loved it at the super bowl party.  One thing I would change though would be to cook for longer than 20 minutes.  I actually cooked for 30 minutes then broiled for another 10 minutes and they came out nice and crispy.  Unless you like your bacon soggy, this is the way to go.  I will try it again for sure.

AWESOME!!!! I made these for a Superbowl party on the grill... needless to say the guys devoured them! I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the cream cheese for the filling. I also added some cayenne pepper for a little more heat.

These were great!  I had my doubts when I ate a bite of filling that fell off a pepper and about burned my tongue off.  I hate hot spicy food, but I like the taste of mild jalapenos.  I made them exactly by the recipe, except it took them 50 minutes instead of 20 to get done to my liking.  It was worth the trouble.  I will make these again, and maybe even get creative with the ingredients.

I have been making my own version of this for almost ten years, except I don't use bacon.  I was thrilled to see bacon added to the recipe, as bacon can only make something better!  Also, I used parmesan cheese with my cream cheese and sausage stuffing.....about a cup.  It's definitely necessary!

My family has made these for years and we LOVE them! However, instead of mixing sausage in the cream cheese, we have always mixed in raspberry jelly. It gives it an amazing flavor. LOVE IT. I'm excited to try microwaving the bacon first...that's a great idea!

I have been making stuffed jalapeno poppers for years and years and have always made them this way.  This recipe is an old classic for me, so nothing new here.  Sometimes, I add onions and garlic to the sauage and sautee together, then add to soft cream cheese.

Good recipe as is that is easy to make better.  Lots of great tips in the reviews.  Brushing a little honey on the bacon is a great idea, or try dusting the bacon with a little brown sugar.  I find that using pre-cooked bacon saves so much time and actually produces better results, as raw bacon can't cook enough before the stuffing melts.  Also, try using canned pickled whole jalapenos instead.  Adds another level of flavor.

These were really good. However, I didn't use bacon because I dont really like it and it was just for me. I also used turkey sausage and low fat cream cheese.

Made these last night and they were AWESOME! I did however add a touch of garlic powder, 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup of mild cheddar.  My boyfriend ate most of the 30 that I made.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 because it's just the two of us.  Will be making these again soon.

WOW!!! I make a version of these on the grill but these are by far our favorite!!!  I did not change anything to the recipe however I did make these on 3 different occassions in the last week and found the following to be helpful.  they take about 10 minutes longer for the bacon to be done and crispy but the extra cook time makes the jalapenos literally fall apart so the second time we broiled them for a few minutes at the end instead of cooking them longer. next time we are gonna use a whole piece of bacon for each to "seal them in" and grilput em on the grill

I love this recipe. It is quite a process making them, especially when you have to make 90 of them. But everyone loved them and I will definitely make them again. I prepped the peppers and filled them with the spread the day before. Which worked out really well because the spread hardened in the fridge. Also took a little longer in the oven, but still an awesome recipe.

This recipe was delicious and pretty easy to make. The only thing that I did differently, was to put them in the broiler for 10 minutes after I took them out of the oven, to crisp the bacon. Very good.

I am giving three stars cause these poppers were a hugh hit at the Superbowl party, but i didnt like them, way to greasy for my taste. Good suggestion wearing gloves and putting in water. Saved me from a lot of pain.

I have been making a version of this recipe for a few years and always get great reviews.  A few changes to this recipe... instead of cream cheese I use soft unripened goats milk cheese.(just squeeze it out of the package)  I use breakfast sausage instead of ground(it fits perfectly in the jalapeno just cut off the excess).  I usually bbq these which is a little difficult because of the flare up but it does get the bacon crispy.  I will try cooking it in the oven and will try the honey on the bacon trick for sure.

Wow! This was amazing!! I did make a couple small changes though: I added sharp cheddar to the mixture and I used 1 whole piece of bacon on each pepper. Also, when I removed them, I let them sit on a few paper towels to drain the grease before transferring to the serving platter. The leftover mixture was excellent with a little cheese and salsa for dipping!! I can't say enough good things about this. It vanished in seconds.

Very good. Not really what I consider a "popper" though. Think I will make next time and then let cool and then make a coating like a "real" jalapeno popper and fry until golden brown for a nice alternative.

I followed some advise of pre-cooking the bacon in the microwave first and it woked out well.  My only advise is to try and use the same size peppers.  I had really big ones that needed more oven time than the smaller ones. very tasty recipe!

These were fantastic! Even with making them earlier in the day and refrigerating them until I put them in the oven, it still didn't take me as long as other were saying for the prep time. I used Pork Breakfast Sausage from the meat counter and bacon from the meat counter as well. I also saved the jalapeno seeds for the cream cheese mixture. I microwaved my bacon for about 1 minutes and then brushed it with honey, as suggested. These were the first app. gone at my fiances b-day party and everyone raved about them.

Very good! They were a big hit for everyone that tried them. I would suggest wearing gloves though while making them, my hands were on fire for 2 days! If this does happen to you soaking your hands in milk helps take the sting away!

wonderfull, I made them last weekend and they have already been requested for a bbq later today. I did use turkey bacon and precooked it for about five min. in the oven. I also used spicy sausage and still they didn't really have a kick but they were still wonderfull. I may try to dice some jalopeno and put it inside as well.

I have made this recipe 2 times for parties and they are the first thing to go.  Everyone asks for the recipe.  I make it diet friendly with turkey sausage, lite cream cheese, and turkey bacon.  Thanks Cindy!!!

These are always a hit for parties (especially with the guys!) - usually add a little shredded cheddar to the cream cheese along with a dash of garlic powder. Be really careful with the jalapenos though - the fumes can take your breath away! Great to cook on the grill too.

I tried these for the first time and they turned out well. I partially cooked the bacon on a broiling pan before wrapping and then used the broiling pan to bake the poppers hoping that the bacon grease would drain away from the peppers. (I occasionally cook my breakfast bacon this way as well) They still seemed a little on the greasy side and I will probably crumble precooked bacon on top just before removing from the oven the next time I make them. I thought that they were at their best while they were still warm. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I made this recipe for everybody else and they loved it. I think doing the bacon before wrappin for the final cook would be great b/c it took way longer than 20 minutes to cook but everybody loved them in the end. Also I had a ton of left over sausage/cream cheese filling so I'll probably make a little less next time. However these Poppers were a hit.

Yum Yum.  I did add green onion to the meat and  did not use tooth picks and they came out fine.  I also added a drop of honey on top of the bacon before cooking.

love this recipe if you well clean your peppers out side they will not choke you up,the fresh air helps.also they make a pepper cleaning tool so you can cut off the top and leave the pepper whole and clean it out.they also have a papper holder for the grill or oven.

I sort of followed the recipe. I used 2 sausage links cooked and chopped fine. Drained well first. Added 8 oz. creme cheese some grated moz. cheese a little parm. and about 15 slices of pepperoni chopped fine. Stuffed the halved peppers. They are in the oven now, so guessing 5 stars.

These made me a goddess to my family! Wow. I only made a half-batch using a one-pound roll of Italian sausage, one package of cream cheese and just a bit of extra sharp Cheddar. I agree with the reviewers who suggested cutting the bacon lengthwise before wrapping. Using the convection oven crisped it nicely. Thanks so much for such a fantastic recipe!

I made this poppers for one of my friends going away party and everyone loves it. And one week later I brought those to my friend anniversary, the poppers are gone within minutes. Everyone loves it. And it is very easy to make it. Even a cooking dummie like me can prepare them, I think, everyone will.
Thank you for the receipe.

I served these over the course of two weekends.  A family renuin on one weekend and a cook out the other.  Both family and friends loved these.  People were hiding them and hourding them.  My mother actually hid some in the back of the fridgerator to take home.  We have found that either leaving some of the seeds in or grinding them and putting them in the mixture makes them spicier.  Remember to use gloves when handling.

These were very good! Used maple sausage, maple bacon, and chive and onion cream cheese. Left seeds in half of the peppers. So some spicy, some not. But they were all were great! Took longer than 20 minutes in oven, but who cares. They were easy to make, and everyone liked them! Next time a think I will use regular hickory smoked bacon instead of the maple stuff, to cut down on the maple flavor. but when all said and done, wouldn't matter what type of bacon you use,  it would still be a killer recipe! Thanks!

This recipe is soooo good!!  I had to turn up the oven temp a little higher to cook the bacon more, but it is well worth the wait.  These are really spicy because of the fresh jalapenos, but they are awesome!!

Made these for our superbowl festivities, and they were very good.  The peppers had just enough kick - but not too much - and of course anything is better wrapped in bacon!  Yummy!

I made these for an appetizer for a holiday party -- BIG HIT! Even guests that usually don't eat saugage and/or bacon were enjoying them.  We warmed up the leftovers a few days afterwards and they were still good. However, it was a good thing that the holiday party wasn't at our house -- because the bacon really smelled up our kitchen.

I made these for the superbowl and everyone really liked them. They got spicier as they sat. They did take a lot of time to prepare though and I had to cook them quite a bit longer to get the bacon crisp. At the end I broiled them for about 3 minutes.
