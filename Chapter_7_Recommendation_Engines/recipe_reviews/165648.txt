Made this tonight for hubby excluded the mussels and clams which he does not like and used fresh veggies that I sauteed.  Added some lemon pepper seasoning.  He loved it.  Thanks so much for the post.

My husband feel in love all over again today.I made a few changes for taste reasons but basically I followed the recipe as written.
  I used spicey sausage and made my stir fry vegetables from my garden that I froze this summer.
  I don't eat seafood and I am making an effort to learn how to cook it for my seafood loving husband. So after the vegetables and sausage finished cooking I removed some for my self and continued on with the recipe.
 The first thing Bill said as I set the bowl in front of him was you are learning girl! He took his first bite and then didn't say another word until his dish was empty. He declared it wonderful filling and full of flavor.
  This dish makes even the most amateur of cooks look good. A good dish to serve when you want to impress the boss or in laws.

My family is not crazy about mussels, clams or scallops so I made it with 2 lbs of shrimp and a little extra sausage, outstanding!

I didn't feel like grocery shopping, so I made it without the sausage and used shallots instead of sweet onion. I added celery salt and tiny tri-colored tomatoes. It was amazing! Used shrimp and frozen muscles from Aldi's.
