2.18.16   Would recommend that you mix the mayo, sugar, salt, and pepper  together and then gently stir it into the peas, onions, and cheese.  This way you won't crush the peas mixing everything together at one time.  I'm not big on a lot of sugar these days, but that little bit in this recipe sets it apart from many other similar pea salad recipes.

I used 16 oz of frozen peas instead of the canned peas and I omitted the sugar. All the adults loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This was a classic.fish in our house. my only advice is to maybe add some hard boiled diced eggs.
