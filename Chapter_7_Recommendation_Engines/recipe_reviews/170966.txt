I am by no means a biscotti expect but I do tend to bake at least one batch a week.  Just love this recipe, I did change it slightly.  Not that it needed changing but to meet my own requirements.  I used 2 tablespoons of Bacardi Gold rum and also added ½ cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, used the rest of the ingredients as stated.  Mixed the batter as per the recipe (smelled delicious) but as I use a large baking sheet I only make 2 logs.  Split my batter in half in the KA and then working with each log separately, I kneed in a small amount of flour into each log on the counter, I then kneed for a minute until smooth, once smooth I roll out the log like a sausage, place this on the wax paper and press down to ½ inch thick on the baking tray.  I find this easier to deal with rather than rolling flat and then moving to the baking tray. I bake for 30 minutes until golden brown, remove from the oven.  When cooling I move the wax paper containing the biscotti off the baking tray and place it straight on the cooling rack, I cut with a serrated knife after 8 minutes of cooling.  I bake at FULL temperature for a further 15 minutes on each side.  I made an unbelievable 50 Biscotti from this batch.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe sueb  @//-_-\\@

This was my first attempt at biscotti and I am glad I chose this recipe because it was written so well.  Everything about it was perfect.  I did use walnuts as it was all I had.  I also dipped the finished product in chocolate and rolled in nuts as I love chocolate and thought it would go well with banana and rum flavor.  Thank you so much Sueb for sharing!

Whoa, this batter is super sticky.  But flouring my hands helped quite a bit.  I halved the recipe (made them into mini biscotti) and omitted the rum and they turned out great.  My only complaint is that they got stale very quickly (less than 12 hours) and I wonder if they should have dried out in the oven a bit longer...?

I couldn't stop eating these when they came out of the oven! I like really soft biscotti, so I didn't bake them twice...I don't think I could of waited that long anyway! These are so good warm!Thanks Sueb for the recipe!

Made as directed... I think they'd be better if they were baked until they were dry throughout, not soft on the inside. That made it seem like they weren't baked correctly and it made them seem stale after just a day. Would try again, baking longer and maybe adding a nice drizzle of melted chocolate.

Very nice.  I can't help thinking a touch of cinnamin and vanilla or rum flavor would be nice.  Very sticky so I suggest keeping hands wet while molding loaves.

I used melted butter for the oil and vanilla instead of the rum since I didn't have either of those ingredients on hand & my bananas wouldn't have lasted until I found time to run to the store! Because I wanted bigger pieces of biscotti I made two loafs instead of four, and I sprinkled them with a little cinnamon & sugar before baking, and I toasted mine longer than 15min a side, I probably did 30min a side, I like mine pretty crisp. These came out of the oven absolutely delicious, the banana flavor was great and not too over powering, it was just right. I can't wait to make these again, but with a thicker layer of cinnamon/sugar on them, it complimented the banana flavor really well!

yum! this is delicious. i've always made it with a different recipe but i think this one is better! should use this one from now on.  however, i changed it a little.  i omitted rum, and added vanila extract.  i only used 60g of white sugar,  and added almonds and chocolate chips.  other then that, i did exactly as the recipe.  it's so crispy and yum!  and i recommend to those who says it gets soggy to bake a little bit longer!

I didn't have pecans or rum, so I substituted with walnuts and vanilla, and this was great.  Very nice banana flavor-not too much, but definitely there.  yum

Very good.  Used walnuts, as that's what I had.  Should be even better with pecans.

I bake biscotti often.  This recipe was somewhat bland.  Needs the additional of vanilla extract and a spice such as nutmeg. Otherwise an easy recipe to put together.

Very good biscotti. The dough was a bit sticky, floured hands or Pam sprayed hands will be helpful when forming into shape. The only change I made with the ingredients is I used 2 cups white flour and 1 1/2cups whole wheat flour. For the second round of baking I did bake 25 minutes each side.

Very good flavor.  We love banana and chocolate so I added some chocolate chips and I drizzled melted chocolate on top of the baked cookies.

I really really liked this recipe!  First time making biscotti with banana, so I wasn't really sure what to expect, but they hardened right up after baking at 350 for 15 on the first side, and 10 on the second.  I also added a dash of vanilla because I only had white rum, and wasn't convinced it was enough flavor.  Next time I will double the recipe - half with nuts, half with chocolate chips.

Followed recipe exactly minus the addition of the nuts. I found these to be very bland. Not much flavor. I would not make this again.
