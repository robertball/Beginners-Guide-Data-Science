Let's start by saying that there isn't any left in my family of three. But..It's as salty as a salted salt stick from Salty the salted sailor. I think that's just way too much soy sauce mixed with the chicken broth. I was able to rescue by spooning in a couple of spoons of creme fraiche (most awesome french gunk ever) I'd use 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 cup of hoisin next time and cut in about a tablespoon of garlic powder, but I add garlic powder to everything and you should too so I can feel validated.

I thought this was delicious. I only gave it four stars because I changed some things. I used hoisin sauce instead of soy sauce. Hoisin sauce has soy sauce in it but tastes better than soy sauce. I used half teaspoon of ginger and half teaspoon of curry powder. I did not use sesame oil or sesame seeds because I did not have them. I served this with rice and I will definitely make it again.

I'm giving this 4 stars because we all liked it and that's including a 7 & 4 year old. I do agree that it's too salty as is though. Next time I will use low sodium soy or broth and add some garlic and red pepper flakes.

We really enjoyed this. I did make a few changes to make it vegan and reduce the sodium. I substituted tempeh for chicken. I left out the broth and corn starch completely. I used low sodium soy and halved it. I used this as filling for lettuce wraps. The crisp lettuce was a nice contrast. We garnished with sriracha. Yum!

I doubled the sauce, but then added sugar snap peas, baby corn, red pepper strips, broccoli water chestnuts and carrots! I ONLY use reduced sodium soy sauce but we thought it was very good!

This recipe was ok.  It was easy to make but it was missing something.  I probably won't make again.

I love this recipe.  My husband is on a low sodium diet, so I substituted low salt chicken broth and used 1/4 cup of soy plus 1/4 cup of water to lower the salt content and it still tastes delicious.  So far, I've made it twice.

This was good.  It would probably be even better with less soy sauce in the thickening mixture.  Makes it too dark and salty.  Next time I plan to omit the soy sauce from the thickening mixture and season the meat/veggies with dashes of soy as they cook.

I must admit I am the 2nd in command in the kitchen and have made other dishes that turned out great.  This was the worst dish I have tried to date.  Super salty, bad texture, even the dogs agreed after drinking several bowls of water to hydrate from all the salt.  I did not use low sodium chicken broth or Soy Sauce but I am afraid to try this again with the all the water I have retained.  As you were!

THis was good the first time I made it. The 2nd time, I used no salt chicken broth, and no salt cashews, but wow, was so salty almost could not eat. I used the 1/2 cup soy sauce, where last time I used only 1/4...

We actually thought this dish was bland. I think using fresh ginger root or chopped ginger in a jar would have been better than ground ginger.  We used reduced-sodium bouillon and soy sauce, so we didn't have a salt issue as others had.

This was great!  I used 1 Trader Joe's chicken packet with 1.5 cups of water and less soy sauce and it still tasted good but wasn't too salty.  I used frozen broccoli and cauliflour and sliced fresh zucchini that I added with the sauce.  My kids loved it.

This was excellent! It needed more sesame seeds so I garnished with black seeds.  My only problem with it is that it was a bit salty.  Next time I will use chicken stock, which is less salty than broth, and perhaps reduced-sodium soy sauce too.
