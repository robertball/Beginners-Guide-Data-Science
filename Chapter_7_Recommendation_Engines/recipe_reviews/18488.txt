A very "Tasty" dish, light and refreshing. Adding ginger to the whipcream creats a unique delight to the taste buds.  A must for any summertime "Pot-Luck" dish.

I added fresh blueberries and left the raisins out.  This salad was great - I will add even more fruit next time!  It would also be good in the winter with canned and/or frozen fruits.

Warning: makes A LOT as presented.  It says serves 6, but it serves closer to twelve.  Unless you're taking it to a pot luck, I recommend halving or even quartering the amounts.  Otherwise, VERY tasty and fun textures too.

I have made frog-eye salad for every family dinner for the past decade. This time I made this instead, and everyone loved it! I left out the almonds, but added a little almond extract, and used cool whip and left out the sugar. Being January, I had to use what I had frozen, so there were raspberries and blueberries, with no peaches. Finally, I cooked the rice in the pineapple juice from the can and some coconut milk. Very delicious salad, this will be a new staple!

I love it. I also added Blueberries, and a little Almond flavor to the Heavy cream. It was wonderful.

I brought this to a dessert potluck and it was a huge hit-- probably because it's delicious without being full of chocolate and sugar. It's very light (rich desserts aren't my thing) and easy to make.

I am vegan so I altered this a little. I made half the recipe. I used cold leftover Jasmine rice (from last nights dinner, when I make rice I always make extra to store for future meals) I did not have peaches so I used an apricot, I also subbed regular raisins for golden raisins. The biggest thing I changed was using Almond milk instead of heavy cream, I used raw sugar instead of white. The almond milk did not thicken as heavy cream would have so I just added extra rice. I made a bed of Artisan lettuce, spooned some rice salad on top and topped with pine nuts instead of more almonds. Delicious!!

Used wild blueberries, used frozen fruit as I needed to make a dish with no time to shop. Since blueberries are not as sweet as raisins I tossed in a half cup miniature marshmallows, used brown rice, and salad was very tasty.
