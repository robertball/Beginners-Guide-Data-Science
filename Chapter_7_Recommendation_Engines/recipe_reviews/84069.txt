It tasted okay but it was very dry. I've had breakfast casserole in the past and it was much better than this.  I think maybe something has been left out or the steps are wrong.  Avoid this one.

Not the greatest. It sounded good looking at the ingredients, but it came out very dry. Not enough eggs for my taste either. Maybe it will work better with some adjustments.
