This soup is delicious.  Just enough heat to keep it tasty.  Like one of the other reviewers, I used a small can or green chiles and increased the broth to 26 oz.  I also added a bag of frozen southwestern style corn I had on hand in the freezer.  Before serving, I added shredded cheese on top, either mexican or mozzarella.  Fantastic

This was really good! I only changed a few things because of what I had on hand - I used regular diced tomatoes instead of fire roasted and a small can of diced fire roasted green chilies because I didn't have poblano peppers. I also added another half can of chicken broth because I like my soup to have lots of broth, and a shake of garlic powder. Yummy, thanks!

This was very tasty! I think it's better than tortilla or fajita soup you would get at a restaurant. Like one of the other reviewers I used a small can of diced fire roasted green chilies instead of a poblano pepper. I also used red, yellow, and green bell peppers. I did not add hot sauce and to me it had enough spice and flavor. My fiance likes spice so he added hot sauce to just his bowl. After serving , I put crushed tortilla chips on top. Delicious!

When I made the soup the first time with the original recipe, I found it to be good, but felt it was missing some depth and richness.  The second time I made it, I sauteed the chicken with a heaping teaspoon of chopped garlic, I increased the fajita seasoning to one and a half packets, used two cans of seasoned black beans instead of one, and used a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers (drained) instead of just fire roasted tomatoes.  I added a cup and a half of corn and decreased the chicken stock to one cup.  Simmered for 30 minutes and found that it was a rich, tasty fajita stew.

This is a wonderful soup, and something I've never heard of before.  I did add a can of whole kernel corn, more broth and I used green chiles instead of the poblano pepper.  I also added more of the fajita seasoning to the chicken.  Next time I make it I think I'll shred the chicken and let that simmer with everything.  Something I'll be making again, thats for sure!

This is one of my most favorite fall soups to make. Now that I've made it a few times, I stick the chicken the chicken fajita marinade from this site (the one that calls for beer) during the day and then cook the chicken in a homemade fajita seasoning. Three Foster Farms chicken breasts make enough meat for this soup. I usually buy them at Costco. Sometimes, I'll add a can of Campbell's Healthy Choice Tomato Soup, if I have it on hand to make it a little tomatoey. (Is that even a word?) This is GREAT with the Mexican Sunset Bread, which is also from this site.

Bueno!  Soup is such an overlooked staple in our diets, and this one more than fills the bill (and the tummy!) for a satisfying main course, esp. on a cool autumn eve.  Like another reviewer, I sprinkle grated jack or mexican cheese(i.e. queso blanco or queso quesadilla)on top, and then some crispy fried or baked corn tortilla strips . . . divine!!!

3.15.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/188390/easy-chicken-fajita-soup/ ... Wow!  Who knew something so easy could be so good?!  I tend to shy away from recipes that say "easy," because they are usually simple, bland & not worth the tiny effort you put in making it.  Exception here.  Followed the recipe pretty much except I had cooked chicken already (heated & added the seasoning), peppers as listed, 7 1/2oz jar italianstyle peppers (drained), 15 oz diced petite tomatoes (undrained), unseasoned black beans (mostly drained).  I added leftover rice, about two cups; & two ears of corn. I add any already cooked foods to soup at the end.  They just need heating, not cooking.  For this recipe, black beans, rice, corn, tomatoes, fireroasted peppers.  Not much prep for a good soup; & most of us who are thinking soup really don't want to cook, only eat.  :)   Top with shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream & diced jalapeno.  Mmmm! 2/10/13 Bag of three pepper & onion blend in the frozen foods works great!  Kroger has one 12 ounces.  Perfect - & a time & money-saver!

we absolutely LOVED it!!!  I pored it over the tortilla chips and garnished with sour cream and shredded cheese for my childrens sake.  It was a huge hit.  We will definitely have it again soon.

AMAZING!  I  made 2 batches tonight, 1 steak & 1 chicken.  Used the frozen pepper & onion blend to cut back on cost.  I seriously think I could eat this every day.

This recipe is very forgiving. I made a couple of changes, according to what I had on hand. I used about 1 Tbsp of Emeril's Southwest Essence instead of the fajita seasoning. I also cut the onion, bell pepper (red only), and chicken into 1" chunks and cooked them all together with the seasoning on high for about 10 min. then added the toms, 2 cans of white beans, 1 can of diced green chilis 4 oz. and chicken stock etc. Turned out great! Thanks for posting this great recipe Gweb8 :)

Sort of blah...I was surprised that people were as crazy about it as they were.  Both my husband and I thought it was just okay.  Just not a lot of flavor.

Made this today, it was delicious, fast, and easy! I cooked the chicken with garlic and I also used green chiles instead of pablano since that is what I had on hand.  Also, I added corn because I saw many users add these changes.  I wouldn't say the recipe needs any of these changes, but it just made the soup more "my type of soup."  Thanks for the recipe! I definitely will use again.

This soup is absolutely delicious! I used left over rotisserie chicken from the supermarket which I added in the end instead of the beginning , I also added fresh spinach which gave it a beautiful color and juice from a whole lemon at the end which my husband loved. The hot sauce I left out as it is so tasteful already . Loved it, loved it!

This soup is awesome!! I am not too familiar w/ poblano, and I like my food spicy so I subbed 2 jalapenos w/ seeds.  I aslo season my chic before cooking w/ garlic powder, cayanne, cumin, and fresh cracked pepper.  I add about 3 tbsp minced garlic to my fresh veggies and add can of fire roasted diced green chiles to my canned ingrediants.  It was a bit spicy w/ these additions so I increased to 2 cans chic broth.  Easy dinner, use the vidalia onion chopper to cut all of my veggies and it is so delicious.  Add some cheese and fresh cilantro for extra special!

This was delicious, but it definitely didn't make 10 servings - maybe 6. I didn't have a poblano pepper so I added another red pepper. I also used regular diced tomatoes and black beans. I made my own fajita seasoning to control the salt. I added fresh ground pepper.

Really like this soup.  I made it easier by just dumping everything in a crockpot (didn't pre-cook the chicken) and it was wonderful.  Love coming home from work to smell dinner ready!

Words cannot describe how tasty this soup is, though I did modify it by using beef broth instead of chicken broth, a plain can of black beans instead of seasoned, and I made my own fajita seasoning from the recipe found here, omitting the cornstarch and the bouillon, using habanero powder instead of cayenne, and roasted paprika instead of plain. I topped it with a dollop of sour cream and some chopped cilantro.

I LOVE this recipe. It truly has the best flavor but I altered it by adding garlic and corn. I also substituted the poblanos for small amount of canned jalapenos. TASTY!

This is a great soup! I made it today and I got a great compliment that it was better than our taco soup that we have all the time. I made a homemade fajita seasoning, I just used a 1/4 of a onion instead of a whole one, used a jalepeno pepper instead . I also used fresh corn in the place of black beans, my whole family does not like black beans. A great dish that I was told to keep the recipe for. Happy eating people!

This was honestly the best home-made soup I have EVER had/made. To quicken up the process, though, I actually used pre-cooked rotisserie chicken strips from the frozen section at the grocery store. It saved about 10 min. This soup will be in my every-other-week rotation per my boyfriends (and my) request!!!!!!

Very good soup... but the serving size is really off.  We doubled it (so for "20") but it made exactly the same amount of soup as when we double a recipe that's originally for 4.  So doubling it made like 8-10 servings.  If you want to make soup for 8 - double it!

I made this and used a rotisserie chicken, a mix of green, yellow, red and orange bell peppers along with the poblano, and regular diced tomatoes, rather than fire roasted.  Since my chicken was already cooked, I started by sautéing the peppers and onion.  Then I added the fajita seasoning, the tomatoes and chicken broth and simmered for about 15 minutes.  Then added the black beans and chicken.  I didn’t simmer any further because I didn’t want my beans to get mushy.  I made this early in the afternoon and refrigerated it, then reheated just before serving.  I did find there was very little broth (even though I covered this while simmering), so I added another can of chicken broth before reheating.  This was good fajita soup and I loved all the peppers in it.  I might try this with taco seasoning next time.  UPDATE 1/25/14:  Made this again as follows - I did use taco seasoning this time, along with red, yellow and green pepper.  This time I did not have a poblano.  Instead of the fire roasted tomatoes, I used two 10 oz. cans of Rotel, which added nice heat, and I used regular black beans, rinsed and drained, not the seasoned black beans.  As before I added extra chicken broth, this time using nearly an entire 32 oz. container.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Made some changes based on what I had on hand, and took some others advice, used two cans of black beans, a dash of garlic, and a can of corn.  We also just had regular diced tomatoes, not fire roasted, and used a can of diced jalapenos since i didn't have poblano.  I went ahead and used a bag of frozen red, green and yellow peppers and onion too.  I think the extra beans made it richer and thicker, and the corn gave it some nice variety (soup didn't feel as dimensional as a soup should without it). We topped with lowfat mexican four cheese blend, a dollop of light sour cream, and crushed up tortilla chips.  We'll definitely be having this again!

This is easy to make, but I would suggest cutting the chicken and peppers into bite size pieces, rather than strips.  It was rather difficult to eat without trying to cut it int the bowl.  I ate this as it was intended - as a soup.  My husband, chose to use a slotted spoon and put his drained "soup" on a tortilla and eat it like a fajita.  He now wants me to make fajitas using this recipe, minus all of the liquid.  We ate every drop of this soup, so it must have been loved.

ONE OF THE BEST RECIPES ON THIS SITE.  Doesn't need any changes (though I personally like to add garlic).  Very easy to cook and healthy.

Really good.  I made no changes to the recipe other than using my own homemade fajita seasoning.  The only problem with this recipe is that the serving size is way off.  I would say this makes 5 servings, though I stretched it to 6.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe that I would make again.

I used Taco Bell Fajita Seasoning packet. I cooked the chicken, pepper and onions and then dumped everything in the slow cooker. I added extra beans and corn. Not as good as my regular taco soup, (Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup). I added some cilantro, lime and chipotle powder to give it a kick. It was better, but would not make again.

Very good!  To make it easier I bought the precooked, precut chicken strips.  My husband still didn't think it was very spicy with the poblano pepper, but I disagreed!  Next time I may throw in a jalepeno pepper, too, for him. I added a can of diced tomatoes and omitted the green pepper (but used the red pepper).  I also added 1.5 cups of water in addition to the broth because I like more liquid in my soup.  Very good!  Thank you!

This soup was amazing.  I was very surprised at the amount of flavor.  My boyfriend is a picky eater when it comes to veggies and eats a ton, the soup was very filling for him and he loved it, veggies and all.   The only suggestion I have is to add more chicken broth than directed.  Great dish!

Four stars because this soup really is amazingly easy to prepare.  Next time will chop the peppers and onions and the soup will be worthy of five stars. Next time I might also add a little lime juice because I love a little citrus flavor in tortilla soup; I think it adds another layer of flavor which really complements the spiciness and smokiness.

Very good!  Minimal effort exchanged for big taste! Added 1/2 can of enchilada sauce and sprinkled in some crushed red pepper.  I also added a little extra chicken broth to make it more soupier.

Fabulous! So easy and somewhat healthy... I added fresh garlic to chicken while cooking and also seasoned chicken with garlic salt and pepper.  Top with fresh squeezed lime, sliced avocado, shredded cheese, sour cream, and or chips. Will be making this often

Great! I have very picky eaters so most recipes I do have to change up, not this one! I followed it exact except added 1 tsp of tabasco to it while it was simmering, perfect! Found using tongs to do the veggie chicken stir fry portion worked very well.  Recipe is well written thank you! Prep time was right on and most recipes don't say whether to cover the pan while simmering or not.  Will be making this again!

Delicious! Will definately make again! I added an extra can of vegetable broth since it wasn't very soupy and didn't have poblano peppers so added cayenne pepper powder and a little extra hot sauce.  To top it off we added cheddar cheese, broken up tortilla chips and sour cream which made for the perfect toppings! Yum Yum! My guests were all impressed.

This is truly delicious! I've made it twice already and plan on making this a regular! All of the ingredients come together to make a tasty chicken fajita soup. I chopped the chicken strips in half so there would be more chicken, I also doubled the recipe so there was leftovers for the next day!

Very easy to make. The store didn't have seasoned black beans, just plain. And no poblano pepper, but the soup still came out good!

Wonderful and Versatle Soup! I increase the broth 2 more cups and added 1 cup of rice just before I simmered for 30 mins. It made in great! I also added chopped jalepenos and diced hot cherry peppers instead of the poblano pepper. Mainly because I do not have poblanos. I copied one reviews idea and add garlic powder too. This recipe is for sure going into my favorites!

Super easy and very tasty. Doubled the recipe.  Healthy and hearty, loved the black beans and fire roasted tomatoes.  Would have been great with cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips if I would have allowed myself the extra calories.  Great soup!

This was very good. I made this even easier by using leftover fajitas from a restaurant and just threw everything in my slow cooker on low for a few hours. The broth from the seasoning packet was great. I served this with quesadillas for dinner. I had to add an entire box of chicken broth and I was serving 4. I'm not sure how this is supposed to feed 10. Other than that, very yummy

Very good!  I was out of fajita seasoning so I used taco seasoning instead.  I used frozen pepper strips, added frozen corn, a can of diced chiles and an extra can of black beans.  My son loved it!

Love this soup.  I used rotisserie chicken which made it even easier if possible!  Truly did taste like fajitas.  We will be adding this to our regular soup collection.

This soup is a family favorite in my house.  I serve it with tortilla chips and low fat mexican cheese.  My entire family loves it.  Even my 3 year old and 5 year old - "the finicky duo" enjoy it! 

I normally add more chicken broth just to have more liquid, but as is it is wonderful!

This soup was so easy and delicious! I didn't have any black beans so I left them out. I used two fresh jalapenos instead of a poblano pepper (we like it spicy!). next time I will use another half packet of fajita seasoning.

OH MY GOSH!  This was wonderful!  The recipe sounded good and the calorie content even better so I made last night for dinner.  The flavor was wonderful - much more than I expected.  I added an additional can of chicken broth and black beans.  I highly recommend...especially for dieters!

Very tasty. I couldn't find Poblano peppers so I also sub a can of green chilis (4 oz) like many other reviewers have. I also added half can of corn and a lot more than a dash of hot pepper sauce (around 1/8 cup). I served it with sour cream, avocado and crushed tortillas on top.

This was allright. It was our dinner 2nite. My fiance & I rarely prepare elaborate meals during the week. We either use our sc, eat leftovers from the weekend, eat take-out or look for recipes that can cook in 30 min. or less. This met our need for a quick, no fuss meal, but for me, it didn't deliver on flavor. I pretty much followed Gweb's directions to the letter, but couldn't resist making a few changes lol. :) To streamline prep even further, I subbed two 8 oz. pkg. of pre-cooked chicken strips (thanks ErikaB!). The grilled strips seemed more authentic, so I'm glad I splurged for them. I'm lucky to live near a few ethnic markets (Italian / Hispanic), so finding a variety of fresh produce was no problem at all. I chose orange & yellow bell peppers & a poblano pepper for my soup, but you could use any combo that suits your tastes. My only other changes were to dbl. up on the broth (two 14.5 oz. cans), use UNSEASONED black beans (all I could find - the Hispanic market didn't even have seasoned ones!) & add a scoop of La Preferedia brand Mexican rice (scoop into bowl / ladle soup over all). The extra broth is necessary if you are planning to add rice or pasta. Even though I wasn't "wowed" with this, I would give it 5 *'s for ease & versatility. Served w/ a dollop of my fiance's homemade guac & some crushed corn chips, this was a filling meal. I'm just not sure I'd make this again. I guess I'm a sucker for sc chicken tortilla soup (Elena). Thanks anyways, Gweb! :-)

Great flavors in this soup. Thanks for sharing. Second time I made it I roasted the peppers on the stove. Added a great smokey flavor. I broil strips of corn tortilla brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with taco seasoning and add them for crunch. A little corn is nice too. Recipe is 4 stars without the changes.

WONDERFUL RECIPE.  MORE LIKE A STEW, BUT CAN ADD A LITTLE EXTRA BROTH IF DESIRED.  I USE ONLY LAURIES FAJITA MIX AND IT COMES OUT GREAT.

Great results! I used regular diced tomatos  a whole seeded jalapeno and my own spices instead of packaged. 1/2tsp black pepper, 1 1/4 tsp cumin, 1tsp chili powder and 1/8tsp ground coriander. Will definitely make this again!

I was skeptical about this soup because I'm more partial to thick, creamy soups. I followed the instructions as best as I could (I didn't want to run out to the food store).  I roasted some chicken breasts and shredded them for the soup. I didn't have green chilies or a poblano pepper so I used a tsp of the sauce from chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I also didn't have any tomatoes (I don't really like them anyway). I added lots of red and green peppers, onions, frozen corn and some black beans and followed the recipe in terms of cooking times and the order of filling the pot.
I have to say, it's only been a few days and I've gone out to the store to make sure I have ingredients to make it again this weekend. It was so delicious and flavorful. Once a little sour cream was added on top at the end, it was a perfect consistency for me and very filling.

This was very good and very easy to make on a busy night, I used my own chicken stock and fajita spice mix. My husband is still raving about it and said he gets dibs on the leftovers for lunch today. I almost forgot I did add in a jalapeno from the garden.

I am giving this 4 stars, even though it didn't come out very well.  The chicken was extremely dry.  That may have been my fault because I used my slow cooker for 6 hours.  The taste was good, however.  Next time, I am going to follow one reviewer's direction.  She used skirt steak.  I think that may work much better.  AND....I won't use my slow cooker.

This was great. Next time I will add more chicken. I did add more diced tomatoes, used a yellow pepper, green pepper, red pepper and yellow pepper. I don't digest corn well so I did not add that like alot of other people did. Also, I used a 32oz chicken stock and 2 packages of Fajita seasoning, gave it GREAT flavor!

It was good. I put The soup in a blender for kids to eat it. Next time I will use half of the fajita packet. It was a little strong for kids but great for me and the hubs.

It is one of my favorite soups. My whole family - even my 6 years old - loves it! We wanted more chunks so, I added some long grain, wild rice, barley, whole kernel corn, dark red kedney, chunky stewed tomato and the juice from a tomato can. It's an awesome soup for cold days. A keeper :-)  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Gweb8!

This is my very favorite Allrecipies recipe, bar none.  It's healthy, easy to make, freezes well, my husband loves it. Sometimes I add some shredded kale greens to sneak in even more good veggies.  Love it!

This was one of the best soups I have ever made. I went through and read the reviews, as I always do before I make a new dish, and although the dish is probably wonderful the way it is written, if there is something that keeps coming up repeaedly, I make that change....I read to add an extra 1/2 pack of fajita seasoning and a can of dieced fire roasted green chilis...It was AMAZING!! We didnt even add any hot sauce since we have a 2 y/o who was having dinner also. We used Tostitos Artisan recipe "Toasted Southwestern Spices" chips and monterey jack cheese, and had it more like a tortilla soup and every one ate so much, their tummys were buldging out! I also doubeled the amount of soup stated so there was more broth, as my family loves the broth! Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

Fantastic!  So quick and easy.  I changed some things due to what I had on hand.  No red peppers, no hot peppers, homemade fajita seasoning, only had zesty chili tomatoes, meant to add rotel tomato sauce but forgot.  Cubed my chicken breasts.  This one is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup is so delicious and flavorful. I actually make this in the crock pot. I cook the chicken with the oil and some garlic on the stovetop and add it in with all of the other ingredients in the crock pot. Like some of the others have recommended, I use the diced tomatoes with chile peppers and actually add an additional small can of chile peppers. And I do use more than one packet of fajita seasoning too.

I cook on high in the crock pot for 4 hours.  

I add some shredded mexican cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips on top.

Since my husband isn't a huge soup eater, he actually uses a slotted spoon to drain the liquid and uses a flour tortilla to make fajitas. 

Tastes awesome either way!

Made several changes but this was delish!  I marinaded the chicken in a fajita marinade over night, and then when cooking used my own blend for fajita seasoning (and I used a lot of it) I used two cans of diced tomatoes and about 4-5 cans of broth (I wanted enough soup to last me all week for lunch) In the end this was great!

Made just as written (with the exception of an anaheim chili instead of the poblano since the store didn't have). It was really good and the family loved it.

This soup is awesome!  Do yourself a favor and use the fire-roasted tomatoes and the seasoned black beans.  The first time I made this I just used regular tomatoes and unseasoned black beans, and the recipe was so ho-hum, I almost didn't make it again.  The second time I used the properly seasoned ingredients, and WOW!  Big taste difference!  Also, I found this soup to be very difficult to eat with long, thin strips of vegetables and chicken.  Now I only make it with everything chopped into bite-size pieces, and it does not make it taste any less like a fajita - it just makes it easier to eat. :-)  Enjoy!!

Pretty good. I used my own fajita seasoning spices: cumin, chilipowder, cayenne, garlic. The cooked peppers were a little bitter (maybe roast them in the oven first). Tastes like taco soup.

this was very yummy on this cold spring day.  The only modification I made was instead of packaged fajita seasoning I added the following: 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 1 tablespoon cider vinegar 1 tablespoon soy sauce 1 teaspoon chili powder 1 clove garlic, minced 1 dash hot pepper sauce, actually several dashes of hot pepper sauce.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

This recipe was really good.  The only thing I modified was the fajita seasoning.  I could not find any fajita seasoning packets that didn't contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.  So, instead, I used ~1/2 of a packet of taco seasoning, and then added mesquite seasoning (make sure it doesn't have partially hydrogenated oil either), chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper and garlic powder all to taste.  This turned out great and I feel better serving it to my family.  Note - it also freezes and defrosts great for an easy weeknight meal.

How great is this recipe?   I didn't have black beans so I used kidney beans. I didn't have Fajita spice pack, so I used Taco spice pack. I didn't have cheese, so I didn't use any. I didn't have chips, so I didn't use any. My two chicken breasts came to 1.25 pounds, I used them all. I didn't have 14 oz of tomatoes, so I used 28 oz. I didn't have poblano pepper so just used more bell peppers.  I adjusted the chicken broth to ensure soup consistency, using a concentrate.   After the first taste my wife said "Put this one in the binder. It's a keeper."  Absolutely no fail is my guess.   Can't wait to try the actual recipe. But I find that with alomost all of the five star soup recipes in this site. My advice to people, try them all and adjust as required.  Paul

Fantastic!  I added frozen corn and substituted green chilies for the poblano peppers.  I used more fajita seasoning to give it some kick and it is delicious.  Made my black beans from a bag as opposed to a can and used more chicken broth to make it more souppy.  Garnished with a dollip of sour cream, cheese, tortilla chips and fresh cilantro.

The flavor of this was good, but didn't really come out as a "soup" for me.  I used the one can of chicken broth as called for but added another one since it was supposed to be a soup.  We actually ended up serving it in flour tortillas more like a burrito instead of a soup.  The peppers and the flavor we really enjoyed though.

Delicious and so very easy.  I realized when I got home from the market that I only had one pepper (red) and a red onion.  So I made it with these, used the small can of fire roasted chiles (no poblano at the supermarket) and added a can of mexican corn to make up for the 2nd pepper. I also threw in 2 minced garlic cloves, too.  Oh, also, definitely use more chicken broth.  I used 24 oz. and it was still not too brothy.  This is definitely a keeper and wjips together easily.  I think this would work with steak, too. Thanks!

This was just okay to me.  Too many peppers for my taste.  My boyfriend really loved it though so I guess to each their own.  Thanks for the recipe, it was fun to make.

Good recipe.  I don't use premade spices, so I used a homemade taco seasoning.  I'm looking forward to tring it again.

Flavor was delicious! But had too many peppers and enough chicken and broth for our taste. Next time I will only put 1/2 of the peppers, double the chicken to 2lbs. and 2 cans of broth instead of one. I will definately make again with changes. Thanks for recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I added a yellow pepper for more color and extra chicken broth because my husband likes more liquid. To save time, I used the pre-cooked chiken strips and it worked out great. This has become a family favorite!

Per some other reviews, I added a can of corn and some extra chicken broth to make it more soup-like. I also cut everything into bite-size pieces and used a rotisserie chicken. My only issue was the McCormick's fajita seasoning I used (which obviously is not the writer's fault). It has a fake lime flavor that was a little odd in the soup. Next time I would use a different one, or just spice it myself. I had to add paprika, cumin, cayenne, and garlic powder to mask the fake lime taste.

My husband and I think this is one of the best soups we've ever tasted!  We had MANY sweet peppers to use up that had accumulated from our CSA boxes over the last couple of weeks; this recipe put them to excellent use.  I wanted to make my own dry fajita seasoning and didn't know where to start, so I Googled "Homemade Fajita Seasoning", and a very good one came up on About.com:Busy Cooks.  Gweb8, thanks for posting this soup recipe.  We love it and will be using it often!

WOW!  This dish was delicious AND easy!  I followed the directions exactly and was so pleased with how it turned out.  The entire family, including my two daughters, devoured this soup.  I fried up some corn tortilla strips as a nice, finishing touch.  Think I'll try adding some fresh cilantro next time.  YUMMO!!! :-)

I've found it sensible and easy to put together and remarkably low calories for something that fills me up so well.  I followed the instructions exactly the first time but each time there after may have varied a bit...but still turns out good.  It seems it is a hard thing to do incorrectly.  Oh...I couldn't find pablano peppers from Mexico (Superstores Canada) so I used Cubanell (from I don't know where...but if it's Cuba then harder for the American folks to get? )

I've been making this for a couple years now from this recipe and have come back to print it out again because the orginal is getting a bit soggy and messed up.  I love this soup.

DH absolutely loved this.  I did add the whole box of chicken stock also (48oz) to make it more brothy and added 2 of the fajita seasoning mixes.  DH likes spicy, so also added one small jalapeno.  Thanks for a terrific and super easy meal.  I did not saute anything.  Just put everything in the stock pot and let it simmer away.  Chicken breast chunks were super tender and moist.  This is phase one worthy of south beach diet also.  yum!

This recipe was great even with my modifications. I didn't have peppers or black beans  so I used: cannelinni beans (white kidney beans), diced tomates seasoned with onions and peppers, garlic and onion powder.  It turned out awesome. My whole family enjoyed it.

This soup is soooo good. I would rather eat this than fajitas. Tripled the recipe for a party with the exception of I only used 2 packs of fajita seasoning and it turned out wonderful. After cooking as per the directions I put it in my crockpot basically to keep warm. Had raves about the soup. Thanks, Gweb8 for sharing.

Pretty good soup, but my family needed a lot more broth to knock out some of the heat from all the fajita seasoning. The stuff I used was HOT! But otherwise, a yummy, filling meal.

This was so awesome, however that said, the only changes I made was dropped the poblano and used rotel tomatoes with green chilis instead of the fire roasted tomatoes, also added a clove of garlic with the peppers. put the hot pepper sauce in the individual bowl of soup and topped with mexican cheese, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips. Even the four year old had seconds!

Tasty. I didn't have a can of green chilis as suggested so I used a can of green salsa. Added some mexi-corn. I didn't have any chilis so I put 8 hot carrots. Very spicy, but I liked them. Next time, I will reduce the carrots. With or without hot carrots, it was still very good.

I really liked this soup, and would make it again.  I used homemade chicken broth and leftover shredded chicken off the bone, which I think gave it a very delicious flavor.  Everything else I did about the same, except I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and more than doubled the broth in the recipe.  It made it more watery than in the picture, but that worked quite well, because it did stretch it more!  (And I eliminated the hot sauce, finding it had enough spice on it's own).

This was delicious.  I followed other reviewers' suggestion and doubled the chicken broth.  I also added a can of diced green chili peppers and left out the dash of hot sauce (I added hot sauce separately when serving to keep the heat down for my wife).  Great recipe for a cold winter night!

My husband really enjoyed this soup. I did not have the poblano pepper, but I used RoTel diced tomatoes which added plenty of spice. I would recommend slicing everything into bite size pieces, as eating soup with strips of pepper & onion can be messy!

Yum.  I made some changes due to not having all items on hand and it turned out great.  I used pre-cooked baked chicken, no bell pepper, a little onion, garlic powder, Rotel mild and plain black beans.  I used extra chicken broth.  Very good.

I made this because it was quick and I didn't have much time.  Now my husband is telling everyone how good it is.  Easy and tastes incredible - can't ask for more than that!

Excellent. You will not regret making this one.   I would add that my next go round with this one will have the chicken flaked into brisket style consistency as well as adding corn.

I really liked this.  Honestly, I was tempted to eat it  before I added the broth.  The name is really fitting.   Excellent exactly as written.  I just used taco seasoning that I had.   Thanks for the recipe.

Loved the soup, even my husband liked it and he doesn't normally like soup. The only change I made was I fire roasted the poblano peppers first which made the soup a little smoky

I really like this soup.  Quick and easy to make.  The only change I made was using green chilis instead of a pablano because I didn't have any.  I did find fajita seasoning but next time I think I would just add my own spice mixture instead of the package stuff.

This was fabulous!  I did not have the poblano pepper so followed another reviewer's suggestion & used a small can of fire roasted green chiles.  I added this to the sauteing peppers (red, green & yellow for added color) & onions a few minutes before they were done, then put in the remaining ingredients. At the end of the simmering time, I added some ground black pepper, a small amount of salt and a few shakes of hot pepper sauce to suit our tastes. The soup really was delicious as written and needed nothing else.  However, intrigued by others' suggestions, at this point I added a can of southwestern style corn (couldn't find frozen). This made the soup very thick, almost like a stew, so I threw in an additional 14 oz. can of chicken broth and let it simmer for about 10 minutes longer. I ladled it over nacho chips in individual ceramic soup bowls with handles  and topped each with shredded Mexican cheese.  It was hearty enough to satisfy as a complete meal (a couple of the "boys" did have seconds!)with fresh fruit compote as dessert. I will definitely make this again -- and again!

Excellent soup. Definatly a keeper. I didn't have the fire roasted tomatoes so I used a 16 oz jar of salsa. I also used a can of regular black beans juice and all and doubled the ckicken broth.

This recipe turned out very well.  The dish is tasty, a teeny bit spicy, and I like the addition of poblano pepper.  I made no changes, except for using regular diced tomatoes since I didn't have fire roasted diced.  The soup was great warmed up the next day as well.  This would be an excellent dish to make for a cold, winter day.

This is excellent.  I made it just as the recipe was written, and it definitely had a nice restaurant quality allowing each of us to add a spicy kick with the hot sauce if desired.  Incredibly easy and quick to prepare.  Look forward to astonishing people with this fabulous recipe.

Pretty darn tasty!  I didn't have any chicken breasts, so I used thighs.  I also dumped some leftover salsa in and topped it off with some cilantro, cheese and chips.  I will be making this again soon!

Very good recipe and so easy to make! I did have to make some adjustments due to what I had on hand. I used a fajita seasoning mix instead of a packet. Also, subbed kidney beans for black beans. I didn't have poblano and added 1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce plus 2 tsp of the sauce. I felt a little more broth was needed and added about 1 cup more. I had a yellow squash to use up and added it to the soup. This is a versatile recipe to add other veggies you might like too.  Looking forward to having leftovers tomorrow! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this soup for a "food day" at work and it was a hit.  I didn't use pre-made fajita seasoning, but made my own instead.  I used cumin, Hungarian paprika, garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and fresh lime juice before cooking.  Finally I threw in some frozen corn for a little more color.

Great soup that you can customize to whatever you have on hand. I usually make the slow cooker chicken taco soup, but this is a quicker version that gives you similar results. I made one change, I added zucchini and yellow squash since I had some about to go bad.

Loved this!  Used 3 Tbsp of my favorite fajita seasoning and it was a little too salty.  Need to cut back on this next time.  The poblano gave this quite a kick!  Add some cilantro and eat with tortilla chips.

This is possibly the best soup I've ever had. The only changes I made were:
-I put pinto beans instead of black beans, because I'm not too big a fan of black beans and I happened to have a can of pinto.
-I baked and shredded a few chicken legs instead of using breasts because I didn't have any. I used three legs, but I would suggest using more than that because it wasn't very meaty.
-I put half a can of corn in after it was done cooking, just to get the corn hot, not to cook it.
-And at the end, I garnished it with some Monterey Jack cheese and some sour cream!!
It turned out amazing. I would suggest making a double batch so you have a bunch, because now I wish I had more.

This will be a new go to recipe for me! Everyone in the family loved it! Based on other reviews I made a few modifications: I used a can of green chilies instead of the pabalano pepper, added 2 cloves of minced garlic, shredded the chicken, 2 cans of black beans, 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes, 2 packets of seasoning, doubled the broth and added a little over a cup of corn. I also topped with with fresh chopped cilantro and jalapeño, tortilla chips,  and shredded Mexican cheese.

Yum!  I switched out black beans (don't like them) for southwestern style bi-color corn.  I couldn't get a poblano pepper, so I used diced tomatoes with added green chiles instead.  Garnished with a dollop of sour cream, crushed tortilla chips and a dash of cayenne pepper sauce.  Holy moley, this is good!  and I don't usually like Mexican-style food.  My husband would have liked it a touch hotter, but I'm a spice wimp, so he can just add more hot sauce!

This was really easy and so good. Followed the receipt but did add some fresh garlic and left out the hot sauce. Also added a bag of frozen corn. Will definitely make again!

I really liked this soup.  I had to deviate from the recipe a little, due to trouble sourcing the pablano peppers.  Since they were not available in my local grocery store, I substituted Jalepeno and Fresno peppers, and added a few extra dashes of hot sauce to make up for the heat difference.  I also added corn, since I like my soups a little thicker.  Next time, I think that I'll try to make my own Fajita mix instead of using the store bought variety.

This is a really good and pretty easy recipe to make. I made a few changes in that I used rotisserie chicken, substituted the poblano peppers with a can of fire diced green chiles, doubled the amount of broth,  and added a can of jalapeno corn. I also made some corn tortilla strips, and added them on top along with cheese and sour cream, and it was perfect! Will definitely be making this again. Rave reviews from all who tasted it.

We really enjoyed this recipe and will definitely make it again! I made just a few additions as suggested by a previous review and doubled the broth, added a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a small can of diced green chilies. I'll probably make a double or triple batch so I can freeze some for later meals.

This was so good.  I made a few additions.  I sliced up 6 soft corn tortillas and sauteed them along with the chicken.  They eventually dissolve into the soup and thicken the broth.  Also added garlic and cilantro....and then fresh cilantro sour cream as garnish.  Any excuse for cilantro!!

I used Hatch Chilies instead of poblano and  extra cumin and tumeric.  It was a tad too salty so I  added some  plain rice before eating.  Always looking for soup recipes to take in lunches for work.

I will definitely make this again and soon!  I used chopped green chilies (1/2 cup) instead of a poblano, added juice of one lime to each bowl along with a dollop of sour cream.  Fantastic!I was afraid it would taste too much like a pepper soup but not at all, in fact, the flavors blended beautifully.  I will double the recipe next time.

Pet peeve alert: For the life of me, if folks are rating a recipe, I can't figure out why they rate a recipe based on their OWN version!

Delicious! I added 12 additional oz of low sodium chicken broth, a second can of fire roasted tomatoes, two fresh ears of corn cooked slightly in microwave and cut off the cob. I also used two oz of Wild Tree Fajita seasoning. It was a little better the second day.

I used taco seasoning and a packet of Hidden Valley ranch dressing, also added a can of black beans. It was delicious! Used the red, orange, and yellow peppers and lots of onion. My husband loved it. I'll make this one again.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe except for forgetting the hot sauce.  It was DELICIOUS  even without the sauce.  The seasoning packet was perfect.  No need to measure out spices.   The fire roasted tomatoes gave it that extra punch.  I put tortilla  strips on top for crunch.  It was easy to make and scrumptious.   It is definitely one of my favorites now.

The recipe was scaled down to 3 portions rather than original 10. It was great although I could not get the chicken meat to brown. Another attempt will be made at another time. I increased the amounts of beans, fire roasted tomatoes and chicken stock over that listed for 3 portions. I also added additional onion and added 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of hot sauce I used a pinch of cayenne pepper. Delicious.

This was super easy and YUMMY!  I tweaked it out of necessity-hubby forgot to pick up the fajita dressing  and I didn't have time to run back out to the store so I had to improvise.  I used 1 packet of Goya Sazon (seasoning),  1 tsp of creole seasoning, a dash of salt and a dash of pepper.  I also cleaned my chicken with lime (I clean all meat with lime) seasoned it with salt and pepper and then browned it.  My husband and kids are NOT soup eaters (even when they are sick) and they ate EVERY bite of this!

I did make changes just because I didn't have exactly the same ingredients. Tossed in cilantro, fresh corn from an extra grilled cob that I'd had the day before, two cloves garlic. Used kidney beans cuz that's what I had. Used regular tomatoes and added a can of Rotele tomatoes  with green chiles. Used my own fajita seasoning. Will make again. It's quick and with my own seasoning eliminate a lot of the salt and preservatives.

Delicious.  Added a small can of whole corn.  Included entire contents/juices of canned ingredients, the juice of one lime and a full box of chicken broth.  Made enough that my husband bought freezer containers and will have multiple meals ready to warm up. Yummy.

The only change I made is that  they didn't have poblanos so i used some other pepper and a drained jar of pimento for the red pepper.  I used some sort of long thin green mild pepper and regular green pepper.  I think i would like my peppers sliced into shorter strips next time.  I used homemade broth and had to add cayenne to get a little heat.  It was very flavorful.  I used the broth from the bone-in chicken breasts I had simmered for an hour.  Very good, only you have take the chicken off the bone and dice it.  So i just added the fajita seasoning to the veggies as i was sauteeing them.   I added the cooked chicken pieces about 10 minutes before the soup was done.   I really like pre-simmered chicken better, the bone really adds flavor to the chicken and broth.  I have time, I am retired.

Absolutely amazing and delicious! Everyone always loves this! I make this soup all the time especially when a friend or family member is sick. The only change I make is using Serrano peppers because it's a little more spicy and salsa instead of hot sauce just for flavor .

This soup was absolutely delish!!! The whole family enjoyed it! The only things I did differently was I used left over chicken from a roasted chicken I cooked earlier in the week. Also for the chicken broth amount I used three cups. Everything else I did exactly as it said. I usually save my chicken carcass & make chicken noodle soup from scratch now I have a new soup to make with that left over meat. Nothing goes to waste in my house. I'm definitely making this again.

Yummy soup! The texture was more like chili, not runny like most soups. I used a small can of green chiles instead of the poblano pepper and also added a small bag of frozen southwestern style corn along with an extra 1/2 cup broth as another suggested. Since we don't like really spicy stuff, I left out the hot sauce. It turned out great. In fact, I don't think making minor changes would hurt this recipe because so many flavors are blended together. This soup was very good the second day as well.

mmmm, this is so good. Ive mede it severl times and absolutely love it! I change it around at time by adding some extra ingredients like mango sausage, corn, paprika, cayenne pepper, and cumin. I also play with the amount of chicken broth that I add. My husband isnt really into soupd, so at times i will cut the broth in half. I top it with a spoonful of sourcream, and YUM!

Nice and easy recipe. I didn't have the fajita seasoning packet on hand so I just used some pasilla and ancho chile powder. Turned out great -- family loved it!

I've made this twice and everyone wants to know what I'm having when I bring it for lunch. The first time I couldn't find fire roasted tomatoes so I used diced tomatoes with mild chilis. For my personal taste the diced tomatoes were better, but this recipe is 5 stars either way!

Didn't have fresh peppers so used frozen stir-fry pepper mix, and a drained can of Rotel for the fire-roasted tomatoes.  Considered a second can, decided against it but it would have been do-able.  Used packet&half of fajita seasoning & closer to 26 oz of chicken broth.  Added frozen corn.  No hot sauce, the seasoning packet spiced it up enough for me.  Also added chicken (season) rub while chicken cooked.  Crunched tortilla chips into my bowl, would have added sour cream but was out.  Smells delicious & makes tasty left overs.

Excellent recipe, smelled good from start to finish. I didn't add any hot sauce because I thought it might be too hot; it's perfect without it. It didn't make 10 servings by my standards, maybe 5 servings. I can't wait to make it using beef and beef broth and I'll add ½ cup of corn also.

Far and away THE BEST SOUP I have ever made.  I add about 1/2 a cup of lime juice when cooking the soup.  I also add a stalk of green onions, 1/2 a bunch of cilantro and a can of diced green chilies. I put everything but the beans, fire roasted tomatoes, chicken broth and diced green chilies into a large zip lock bag and I let everything marinate for 3 or 4 hours.  I use Cholua Chile Lime Hot Sauce for a final touch after the soup has simmered and the soup always comes out perfect.  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!

Hubby liked it: I used green chilies, stewed tomatoes and doubled the broth.  I could have used even more broth, if it would have fit in the pot.  Next time I will dice the peppers and onion, not just cut them into slices.

Mmmmmm...made this soup for dinner tonight (eating it as I write this review); and it is very tasty.  I think it is a little on the spicy side though; but once you eat it you get used to the spiciness of it.    I did add frozen thawed corn nibblets  at the end (about 1/2 cup) & served with shredded x-tra sharp cheddar cheese as a topping and cornbread; I wish I had sour cream, but I have none! :o(.    I was going to add a can of diced chili peppers, but after taste testing it about half way though the simmer, I decided not to because of the spiciness of it already.  Thanks for a great recipe; I will keep in my Recipe Box!

AWESOME.  My family and I love spicy food, so I ended up adding a diced jalapeno pepper to the mix.  Also, I served it with some Mexican blend shredded cheese, sour cream, and lime wedges,  along with some tortilla chips for dipping.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was an excellant soup.  I cut the vegetable into bite size pieces instead of the longer strips.  I left the chicken a little larger so that it didn't fall apart.  I added a few drops of hot taco sauce, a can of corn, cumin and paprika. Served with tortilla chips, and topped with shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.  Yummy.  May serve with cheese quasidillas next time.  A definite keeper!

Fabulous, simple comfort food.  The only change I made was to add a bit more of chicken stock, and to play with toppings.  I have used, alternately: fried tortilla strips, sour cream, and/or grated mozzarella or monterey jack.  To fry the tortilla strips, I just cut the tortilla in half and then in narrow strips and fried for about a minute in an inch of oil.  Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used half the amount of chicken since that's all I had, a yellow pepper instead of poblano, and diced tomatoes w/ chiles instead of fire roasted (and left the onion out since I do not like).  This tasted VERY salty to me and I didn't add any.  I added another cup of water to try and tone it down, but it still has a salty taste to me, more than I'd like.  I am wondering if it is the fajita seasoning I used?  Other than that, it is very zippy and tasty, just as I like on a cold night!

Soup has great flavor.  I wasn't sure how I would like the fire roasted tomatoes, but they give it an added dimension of flavor.  I sprinkled crushed tortillas on top of my bowl before eating.  I'll make this again.

GREAT! !! MUST TRY! Taste better if sits overnight OR hours to get flavor going. Suggest to marinate chicken in 1/4 of fajita seasoning & tbsp of water. I used 3 peppers (red, yellow, orange) had on hand; added 1/2 bag of frozen corn for veggie; used canned (drained) kidney beans that I had. Suggestion if don't have Broth, use water and buillion instead. A favorite soup!

Yum-O!  Couldn't find fire-roasted tomatoes, so used regular and fire-roasted green chiles in place of poblano peppers.  It looked great, and tasted even better the second day than the first.

Delicious.  So easy to make and very hearty.  Next time I think I'll cut the peppers into bite size pieces though as it was a little difficult with these in strips. Be sure and add fresh avocado and some shdreded mexican blend cheese on top when you serve.  PERECT!

Oh my!  I should say that again, oh my!  This is delicious!  I am actually eating some now while I am writing this review. I followed the recipe, except for the peppers. I didn't have any poblano or green chiles.  That's okay because it is great without them!  I also over seasoned, so I added a 16 oz cup of water.  That solved the problem. Oh, and I used two cans of black beans. Instead of tortilla's, I poured it over a spoonful of yellow rice.  Wow! This is good, good, good. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I cooked it exactly as the recipe stated. Both my hubby and my young kids enjoyed and I will certainly be adding this to our dinner rotation.  As a side note, the pablano pepper is called a pasilla in some regions.

Fantastic soup!  Added a can of diced green chiles and omitted the pepper.  Added a can of corn.  Great served with shredded cheddar, sour cream and tortilla chips.  Will make again - maybe with steak next time.

This was an outstanding, very easy soup. I followed this recipe just as it said and the soup turned out wonderful, but this could very easily be modified based on variations of veggies and/or other ingredients that you may have. I cooked it for the amount of time it called for, then let it sit and simmer on low for over an hour (I fixed it a long time before the party started). This is one of those soups that gets better the longer it sets, and is also better when it's reheated the next day. I will definitely make this again, and I think I'd like to try it with steak the next time.

FANTASTIC!  I diced all the vegetables in larger chunks instead of thin strips (easier to eat) and I replaced the poblano pepper with a can of green chiles.  Instead of using boneless chicken, I boiled a whole chicken saving the broth to use instead of canned chicken stock. I also used a Mexican fajita sauce (World Harbor - excellent!) instead of a packet.  I used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies (pepper mix).  Can't say enough about this recipe.  IT IS A KEEPER!

I made this soup yesterday, and it was pretty easy to put tegether.  I did use some taco seasoning instead of fajita seasoning thought it's probably about the same thing.  I also added an additional can of chicken broth, because it seemed to need more.  It was not too spicy which was good for me, but more hot sauce could be added for those who like it that way.  Nice and tasty on a cold day - we had a high of 39 - yuck!

This was so good on a cool autumn day!  Served it with tortilla chips and cheese and next time I will try a dollup of sour cream with it.

This was delicious! A quick and easy soup just like the title says. The poblanos at my local store were starting to rot so instead I used two tablespoons of jarred diced jalapenos. It's a bit spicy but not too much.  I paired it with a simple mexican rice and the meal was very filling.
