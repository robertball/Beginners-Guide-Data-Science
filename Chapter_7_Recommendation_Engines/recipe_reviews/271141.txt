I always make the recipe as it first appears on the site.  Then ask, "Does it need something else?"  This was a winner and I'll keep it with my Brussels Sprouts recipes, variety is good. 
I'd like a separate section for "What did you do to change a recipe."  Reading all the changes first, puts off making the original for me.  I like being the first to review just to let readers know, this is an easy tasty recipe without adding anything.
