I cut the meat back by half, used ground turkey instead of ground beef and threw in fresh minced garlic, sliced fresh baby bella mushrooms, chopped fresh red pepper and cubed fresh zucchini to compensate for the missing meat. Even with half vegetables, the family loved this dish. It was great for me because it was simple, fast and used pantry ingredients that I keep on hand for busy nights like tonight.

I made this recipe in 2 13x9 Pyrex baking dishes. First I line one pan with heavy duty foil. I leave enough extra foil on the sides so that I can crimp the foil together and freeze it. After it's frozen I pop it out of the dish and leave it in the freezer in the foil wrapper. When I want to bake it I peel off the foil and pop it, frozen, back into the Pyrex pan. I also do this with lasagna.

Wow! So easy and so delicious - perfect for an easy meal yet it tastes like something that took hours. I used half ground beef and half Italian sausage and used one of Prego's regular sauces so I added some fresh mushrooms sauteed with some onion and garlic.  I added a little wine to the sauce along with some fresh basil and a can of seasoned petite diced tomatoes.  Next time I might even add a litte ricotta cheese for more of "lasagna in a hurry" this was so good.  I served this with a garden salad and Pepperidge Farm garlic bread and we had a fabulous dinner in no time at all - fabulous with a glass of wine!

The whole family loved it! I used ground turkey instead of beef, and 2 regular size jars of Traditional Prego sauce. So excited to have one already ready to go for another time! ***Updated*** We used the frozen casserole and it was still a hit.  The second night I served it, in order to ward off the "leftover groan," I mixed it up with some added spaghetti sauce, turned it into a different baking dish, and added some more cheese on top to melt.  I called it "Lazitza," because my kids like lasagna, and they all raved about it.  No one realized it was the exact same dish redone!  :)

Easy!  I did make a couple small changes that i think had a great impact.  I used 2/3 lbs ground beef, 2/3 mild italian sausage and 2/3 hot italian sausage.  It came out delicious.  Wasn't too spicy.  But it was so flavorful.  I might have used a lot more cheese than called for as well.   I'm in a dinner group so I made this times six and it got good reviews from everyone.   Oh and I didn't have Prego on hand or the tube pasta (used macaroni).  It freezes well for one month.

This was a great!  The family like it because it wasn't spaghetti again!  I only made half but will make the whole thing next time as I didn't have much for leftovers.  Only difference is that whenever we make pasta sauce using Prego we always add garlic powder, onion powder and basil to it just to give it some extra taste.

I made this with Quorn instead of ground beef and added minced garlic, and it turned out very good.  I also divided it into 3 pans, eating one tonight and freezing the other 2 for a future busy-day dinner.  Not gourmet, but certainly tasty, quick, and easy.

We loved this recipe, but felt it was missing something.  I think I'll add some garlic next time and see if that's it.

Great recipe for how easy it was.  I made it with less meat (about 1 lb) and more sauce (about 1/2 more jar) and I think it would be dry had i not made these adjustments.  I also added Italian seasoning.  I was able to make one 9x13 pan and one 11x7.

This was great! It had a great taste!  We made this in our High School foods class. We had 45 minutes to make it. We did this in two class periods. The first day we got everything ready and stuck it in the fridge. The second day we baked it. It was still very moist. It was very good!

Yum. Made one pan with half the ground beef and half the pasta, same quantities for the cheese and sauce. I used Newman's Marinara since that's what I had and swapped 1 tsp onion powder for the chopped onion so my daughter wouldn't complain. Very tasty.

I've been making this recipe for years.  It's always a big hit.  I will sometimes use bulk sausage (Italian or mild) and/or cheddar.  Onions and black olives are also a nice add.

This was very good and very easy...and I love having a second pan ready for another meal!  I used 4 cups of cheese instead of 3 (2 in the mixture and 1 on top of each casserole).  Next time, I might try 1 lb italian sausage/1 lb of ground beef instead of two lbs of ground beef.  Could have used just a little more flavor.

This was a quick and easy recipe to use as a base.  I tweaked it a little.  Instead of 2 pounds ground beef I used 1 pound ground beef, 1 pound Italian sausage.  The only other thing I added was 1 green bell pepper which I sauteed with the onion. Yummy!

This one's a keeper! I am a novice cook but didn't have a hard time with this one. The mozzarella in the sauce gives this dish the sticky consistency I like in my pasta. Best served with toasted soft-meal bread and butter. Thanks for sharing!

Loved the simplicity of this recipe, I used it as a base and then added my own mixture of spices. I added extra cheese and used a mixed blend of cheese for optimal flavor. I will certainly make this again most likely a spicy version using Italian sausage and extra spices for zest.

This was super easy and made a ton! The only things I did differently was I did only one pound hamburger and also one pound ground italian sausage (sausage is cheaper by a few bucks), I also added one 16oz container of ricotta into the sauce. It made the sauce creamy. I did use 2 disposable foil pans as suggested and we ate one and I froze the other one! Husband really liked and I'm looking forward to eating our second one later!

So easy and yummy.  I cut the recipe in half, used traditional Prego and italian sausage instead of beef.  Definitly in my future menus.

This was good - I cut the recipe in half and agree that it's still too much meat. Did need a little more sauce. Quick, easy, tasty.

I made the whole thing! All in all it fit into a 13x9 and an 8x8. I froze the 8x8 for a further dinner. I pretty much made it as written except I used three 24 oz jars which worked out really well. I also used penne since I didn't have the ziti on hand. Between both dishes I used 4 cups of mozzarella and probably a little more than the 1/2 cup of Parmesan. This would be great with green pepper and/or mushrooms added to it. Will do this again!

This was really good and so easy.  I made the following changes.  I used 1 pound of beef instead of 2, added an extra 1/2 jar of sauce, and added about 1 cup of mozerella cheese.  Remainig sauce was used for leftovers.  I make this all the time now.

We enjoyed this easy dish. I used "Traditional" Prego sauce and doctored it up a bit with oregano and basil. Hubby likes "casserole" type dishes and its nice that we have a second dinner waiting for us in the fridge!

This was really good! I cooked this for me and my sisters and we all enjoyed it. The only thing I did differently was that I used two of the regular sized Prego jars like one of the other reviewers said.

This recipe came out amazing! I used Italian sausage instead of beef and used an 8oz package of Tillamook Italian blend shredded cheese. I halved the recipe, but will definitely make it again!

This was ok, I like the other baked ziti recipe on this site.  This recipe has less ingredients which makes it easier to make, but it's kind of bland.

I liked it but I would put in less meat (half of required meat) and then I would put more sauce (about a half more of sauce that is required).  Loved how easy it was!

I halved the recipe and put the ziti in the freezer.  I used 3/4 pounds of ground turkey, added seasonings to the meat and used meat flavored pasta sauce.  If I do this again, I'll probably still halve the recipe and put it in two 8 X 8 pans (because one 9 X 13 pan is still a lot for two people).

This was really easy to make. I used just a little bit of onion (because it gives my step-dad gas -_-). I mixed in a lot of random seasonings... I also used the $$"Great Value"$$ Italian Cheeses blend and Ziti. I also added 1/2 a can of diced tomatoes (no salt) and 1/2 a can of tomato sauce because the chili i'm going to make in the future calls for 8 oz .. and a whole can is 15 oz.. lol. This turned out to be a really inexpensive, delicious meal. And, I'm ALLLLLL about inexpensive.

Everyone loves this recipe! I added some fresh garlic cloves in with the onion. You can use any flavor of sauce, as we don't like mushrooms. Very simple and easy to make.

I made this dish for my family today and I was really disappointed.  The pasta came out uncooked!  Was pasta supposed to be cooked prior to mixing it with the beef?

When they say now and later, they mean it! I followed the recipe to a T, and ended up with so much leftovers I didn't know what to do with them all! This would be perfect to bring to a family reunion or to a pot luck. Thanks for a great recipe that is quick and easy to make!

Great recipe.  I used 1 lb ground sirloin and 1 lb spicy sausage.  I also used a jar of "Vodka Sauce" for pasta instead of Prego, and it was awesome.  It seems to me that this would probably do well with any jarred pasta sauce. Regardless, it's delicious.

Right amount of everything.  I added some chopped black olives because we like black olives.  It is just as good reheated as it is out of the oven.

Excellent easy meal... Not a fan of mushrooms so I used regular sauce instead of mushroom - still amazing. Sprinkle some Oregano, Basil, and Parsley after cooking for added appeal/flavor!

So, so good. I was skeptical about the amount of sauce this recipe called for. But it turned out wonderfully! I did use a different brand of sauce, but otherwise followed this one to the letter. I did increase the baking time - 30 minutes covered, 10 minutes more uncovered.

Smart idea to have one for now and one for later! Used a bit less meat (had what was thawed! LOL) and it was fine. Added a bit more cheese on top as my family loves it - this was great - thanks!

Crazy phone had me send review! Lol. For extras I add ground pork and extra sauce and veggies. My mother in law is German so I add German chopped bratwurst to it as well. My hubby took one bite and said it was delicious. I cooked the noodles beforehand instead of cooking them with the casserole. This will feed us for nearly 2 days!

I halved the recipe and used mild italian sausage in place of ground beef.  It was absolutely delicious!!  I used fresh mozzarella since that was what I already had on hand.  I'll definitely be keeping this recipe around.  My entire family loved it, including my 3 picky little boys!

I thought this was okay. This did all fit in the pan size suggested. I purchased a cheap disposable pan exactly that size to test it. I just placed it on a baking sheet to make it extra sturdy. I followed the recipe exactly as is, pinched for time, however this recipe really should have other ingredients added, as desired, onions, peppers, fresh mushrooms, seasonings, etc.

This was a big hit with the family this weekend.  I used ground chicken sausage and regular pasta sauce.  It came out great! I paired it with a simple salad and garlic cheese bread.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again.

This was great! It makes so much and is cheap to make. I used a pound of ground beef and a pound of mild Italian sausage (just chopped it up), 2 jars sauce, and added a little Italian seasoning, dry basil, garlic salt, and crushed red pepper. My husband loved it!
