This was very good, I made several changes to make the meal much easier and quicker to prepare with less dirty dishes. I browned the beef and added some minced onion and garlic.  Then I poured in two cups of water and a package of Lipton Fiesta Sides Taco Rice. I brought to a boil and then simmered covered for 7 minutes. I mixed the meat/rice mixture with the refried beans and 1 cup of cheese so that I just had to scoop a 1/2 cup of the mixture into each tortilla instead of doing each ingredient seperately and taking twice as much time. I mixed 2 instead of 1 can of cream of chicken soup with 16oz mild salsa. I poured 1 cup of the sauce on the bottom of each pan and then placed the filled tortillas. Topped with the remaining sauce and sprinkled each pan with 1/2 cup of cheese. These would have been too salsa-y without the 2nd can of soup in my opinion. They were yummy and easy and my hubby said he'd rather eat these then go to our favorite mexican restaurant!

Quick and easy to make. Instead of cooking my rice before hand, when the recipe said to stir in rice, I added uncooked rice and water and let it simmer for 20 minutes so the rice would absorb some of the seasonings.  Tasted great! My husband said it's definitely something he wants me to make again.

I'm giving it 4 stars because it was good and easy. It could be jazzed up a little with 3 easy steps: 1. Cook meat with a small onion and a little garlic. 2. Use Lipton package of rice for ease and flavor...either Spanish or Mexican. 3. Double the salsa/soup combo to make it more saucy. I used chicken/mushroom soup. These changes make it 5-star GREAT!

We made this with only one change. Instead of using the salsa mixed with cream of chicken, we used 2 cans of red enchilada sauce. It was really simple to put together and was something everyone could enjoy. Next time I will use more rice and try it with chicken.

This was very good. I made several changes to the recipe only because I didn't have all the same ingredients. I layered instead of rolling and this simplified the preparation and serving. I used one very large pan and spread the entire can of refried beans on the bottom layer of tortillas. Then sprinkled chopped onions, next the meat/rice and finally the cheese. For the sauce, I didn't have salsa so I combined one can of soup with a can of diced tomatoes and about 1/4 cup of taco sauce. Spread over the top layer of tortillas, sprinkled with more chopped onion and finished with shredded cheese. It stayed together well when I cut it to lift onto the plate and was delicious. Just add tortilla chips and guacamole salad for a complete meal.

Great basic recipe.  We found it delicious, and my husband - a reserved eater - had 2 servings!  I made just a few changes:
1) I added chopped onion to the cooked ground beef.
2) I bought taco flavored rice, stirred in just enough water to dampen it, and just let it soak.  I did not cook it before adding it to the beef.
3) For the topping, I added half a small can of enchilada sauce to the soup and salsa.  It gives a sweetness to it.
4) I used taco cheese.
5) Smaller shells work much better and are easier to serve and eat, so I used 6 inch shells and spread the extra meat around them, topped with sauce and cheese.
6) For serving, we topped with sour cream, diced tomatoes and green onions.

*TIP: To keep your shells rolled up, spread some refried beans as 'glue' when rolling the final edge.  They will stay closed every time!

My daughter and I made these for the rest of the family, and it was a HUGE success!  The only thing we did differently was to cook the hamburger with chopped onions and a chopped clove of garlic.

This is definitely not a traditional enchilada recipe.  I garnished them with sliced black olives after removing them from the oven.  Although they looked perfect, the flavors were a little odd.  Being able to taste chicken soup totally separate from the salsa was unappealing.  The leftovers the next day were amazingly better.  Very good the next day.  Maybe I will just make these and freeze them for later use--just so  the flavors have time to blend together.

Oh my goodness - these were SO good!  I have tried a LOT of enchilada recipes, and this is definitely my favorite.  I didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so used crm of mushroom instead.  Fantastic!  Will be making this a LOT.

My husband and I loved these.  It makes a large batch.  I used Lipton MeXican rice instead of white.  I also topped them with sour cream and guacamole.  YUM.

This was a HUGE hit in my house!  Don't worry about measuring the mixture per tortilla, fill them up, roll em and put them in the dish seam side down.  If you only use 1/4c you'll have tons left over.  Great re-heated too!

Excellent.  And any leftovers reheat very well.  I actually spread the sauce and cheese completely over the burritos because I thought they would get dried out with no moisture on them in the oven.  Other than that, I followed the directions.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

These were a hit!  The only thing I did differently was when I added the taco packet I added 2 cups of water and regular uncooked rice (3/4 cup) and simmered it for about 20 mins.  Worked great!

Yummy!!  I loved these - I did substitute regular rice for Spanish rice.  I would probably just use regular enchilada sauce next time instead of the soup/salsa mixture.  I'm excited that I have an extra pan in my freezer for a day that I don't feel like cooking!!

***I add oil to a skillet & saute minced onion & garlic for a while on low heat while I shred cheddar & monterey jack cheese.***I add the beef to the skillet, brown it well, season it, then add uncooked rice w/ 2 cups of water (which I blended in a blender w/ 1 tomato, 1 glove of garlic, & a tsp of chicken bouillon). I let it boil, then cover & leave it on low for 30MINS.***I use a whisk to mix the salsa and cream of soup b/c a spoon doesn't seem to mix it well.**Then I get a tortilla, smear salsa/soup mixture on it, add beef mixture, add cheese, a little bit of salsa/soup mixture again, add cilantro. Repeat w/ rest of tortillas.***I use foil on my pan & spread salsa/soup mixture on the bottom. After I place all tortillas inside, I spread salsa/soup mixture on top, sprinkle cheese, then cilantro. BAKE for 20MINS, then let it set for 10MIN.***Delicious :)

Made this for My inlaws+ family for my daughters 7th birthday. Only change I did was mix salsa with a can of cheddar cheese soup and spread on top, then topped with a bit of grated cheese. Great accompaniment to the "Outrageous Warm Chicken Nacho Dip" and the "Absolute Mexican Cornbread", both from this site. Everyone raved!

These very very good and easy to make.  My family doesn't like beans that much so I ended up adding a little bit more of the beef mixture into each tortilla.  I ended up only using about 14 tortillas.  Next time I will probably make more sauce or use some red enchilada sauce also since we like them a bit more saucy

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe.  I followed another reveiwers advice and added a medium onion and a clove of garlic to the meat as it cooked.  I also added my own little twist and used Rice A Roni's spanish rice.  It takes 20 min to cook, and I suggest adding salsa to that as well, but it makes the dish absolutely loaded with flavor!  Excellent dish for now, or to save for later!

I find that I only used half of the rice I cooked earlier. I just mixed in the beans into the ground beef and rice. Everything comes out quite a lot. I only used 1/4 of the entire mixture for 6 tortillas.

Liked this one a lot.  No need to bake it overly long if you heat the sauce.  Broil just long enough to melt the cheese on top.

Really great recipe for really great enchiladas! I used others advice such as increasing the sauce a little because for me it wasn't enough and using knorr spanish rice or any other knorr seasoned rice on hand. It just gives it that extra flavor. I've made this many times and have even made trays of them and froze them for another night.

was wonderful and easy!!  Great way to have a spicy dinner.  I only made half the recipe, but did not change anything, and actually made the rice the day before so I would have it, so all I needed to do was heat up the meat, I used ground turkey sausage, which was a little spicy and worked wonderfully, and throw it in the oven.  Thanks!

Mmm...LOVE this recipe! My family loved it too. I used Spanish rice and it was AMAZING, I was so glad I chose spanish rice instead of regular. We ate this for dinner last night and lunch today...We'll definitely be heating up those frozen ones soon!

Great easy meal.  I used red and green enchilada sauce instead of the salsa and soup.  Kids liked it.

Made as written except I used more meat filling.  That wouldn't affect the taste though.  They were mushy.  I made the enchiladas the night before and put them in the fridge (without the sauce).  Then right before baking I poured the sauce on top and baked.  The tortilla's were just mushy.  The filling was good but that's about it.  Not real Mexican but that was to be expected since it was a flour tortilla.

I made the recipe exactly as is and it was great.  My husband and I both agreed it was a keeper.  It made a ton of food though.  It states 6 servings but one enchilada was plenty of food for each of us so we have 8 of these babies left.  I'll see how well they freeze as the author suggests.

Only had 8 tortillas and was able to fit them all in a 15" x 10"(?) Pyrex.  Stuffed them with 1/3 to 1/2 cup rice/beef mixture.  Topped with the entire salsa/soup combo.  I poured it down the middle like the recipe asked but next time I will spread it out because the areas that didn't get covered with the sauce got a little crunchy and hard.

I liked the mixing of rice, hamburger and beans all rolled into one. I used Cream of mushroom soup since it was I had on hand, and it was very good. I also used twice the amount of soup/salsa mixture and covered the whole top. I topped with sliced black olives and sour cream, and some sliced jalapeños.

Very good!  I fried brown rice with the browned ground beef for a little while before adding seasoning mix and water, and mixed in the refried beans when rice was done.  I thought the sauce made this dish, and I also liked preparing two meals at a time and having one to freeze.

This is a good, quick dinner. I forgot to add the rice, and I used 4 tortillas.. I like my enchiladas really full, I think using 10 would be too many. Tastes good and its easy.

I used chicken instead of beef. I also substituted the cream if chicken with enchilada sauce. Used a can of rotel instead of salsa and used the 90 second Spanish style rice instead of white rice. This was delicious!!!

These were the best enchiladas I've ever had. Although I added a lot more cheddar cheese, sour cream, green onions, and enchilada sauce. Highly recommended recipe. Thanks!

Really easy! I think a medium salsa would give them a little more kick, but we loved them.  I made one pan for another family and a pan for our family out of this one recipes.  I also added onion to my ground beef.

My husband and I both loved these!! The kids thought they were too spicy, but that's okay because then there were enough leftovers the next day.  I did put the second pan in the feezer and they were just as good.  Will absolutely make them again.

I changed this just a little.  I didn't use salsa, but I did add diced green chiles to the meat mixture.  I also mixed sour cream, cheddar cheese and a little milk to the cream of chicken to make it creamy.  I put a little inside each enchilada and on top.  Then I covered it all with shredded cheese.  They were wonderful.

Put it all in 1 pan and just had leftover filling. Then I put all the sauce in that one pan. Cooked the beef with a chopped onion and then added uncooked rice to that mixture and let it cook for 20-25 min to absorb flavor. WONDERFUL!  One time I used 2 pans...wonderful but needed twice the sauce topping.

Mmmmmm...yummy.  I like the idea of using black beans instead of the refried.  I just mashed them up in the seasoned ground beef.  Good stuff.

My family loved this recipe, including my inlaws!  Tastes like it came from a restaurant.  I used black beans instead of refried and used burrito size tortillas.  I used also used spanish rice.  I put shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sliced black olives, salsa & sour cream on the table for people to top as desired!  Love it!  I am making this again tonight!

Easy to make and great tasting. Added onions and garlic to ground beef mixture,  used canned black beans, and topped with sou cream.  Kids loved it and husband and I added jarred jalapeno slices for extra kick.

This was really great and easy.  I chopped up onion and garlic and cooked that with the meat.  I was running low on taco seasoning so I added a can of El Pato Tomato sauce.  This gave it the perfect kick.  My husband loved it.  I also used black beans.  I have been telling everyone about this recipe.

This was GREAT! Everyone cleaned their plates and husband went back for thirds and is still talking about it! Made it exactly as it is written except left out the refried beans - and added black beans instead on 1/2 of them and made the other half with just the meat and cheese for picky preschoolers. I used Uncle Ben's brown rice and no one could tell the difference. I think this would be good with chicken too!  The sauce was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious!  I actually used Mexican style Rice a Roni and cooked it while it was simmering.  I also used mexican style shredded cheese on top instead of cheddar!  Wonderful!  I actually fixed the second pan within the same week.

These came out great. I used the taco seasoning I from this site. They had just a little bit of a kick. I will definitely make these again.

This is a great receipe!  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  Thanks for posting.  The ratings really help in chosing a receipe. I trust the ratings.  This was very good and I will make again for sure. :)

I thought it was a great way to use up leftover ground beef and cooked rice, only it seemed really blah.  Definitely needed something.

These were absolutely DELICIOUS!  Had leftovers today and we could easily make these as a weekly meal!  I had a jar of enchilada sauce that I used instead of the salsa and chicken soup.

This is a great weeknight dinner that my whole family loves.  I like to make it a bit healthier by using whole wheat tortillas, ultra lean ground beef, and make sure to use the lowfat cream of chicken soup.  I usually sub out the refried beans for a can of spicy diced tomatoes to add some extra veggies!

These are by far the best enchilada's I have made so far.  The only thing I added was a little bit of water to the soup/salsa mixture to thin it out a bit.  Husband and kids loved them!

The author's description mentioned picky eaters, and this recipe was a hit with my picky eaters too.  I personally prefer a much spicier and complex kind of dish, but for the kids, this was just right. 
Only change I made, out of necessity because I did not have any cream soup on hand, was that I combined the salsa with some of the refried beans to make a smooth spread to go on the top.

I followed your directions and didn't change a thing. This was a bit "hotter" than I expected it to be and I even used a medium salsa.  But I gotta say ... it was sooooooo yummy for the grown ups in my house!!Thanks a bunch!!

This is VERY GOOD!  I did adjust a little because I had no cream soup on hand...I used a can of enchilada sauce at the end & just added the salsa right into the rice mixture. YUMMY!

Loved It!   Used Cream of Onion soup instead and a canned tomato/green chili pepper instead of salsa.  Made up double the sauce seen in photo which I think works for the best considering some of the reviews I read.  I also diced a small onion and cooked in with the meat mixture.  Definitely will make this one again.

My hubby enjoyed this so I gave it 5 stars, however I didn't wrap the filling in tortillas and pour sauce over, as I can't stand it when they get soggy. I made the filling with the taco spice seasoning recipe from allrecipes (I didn't realize I was out of the packet seasoning) and used a can of kidney beans instead of refried (didn't have refried), also only used 1 cup of salsa and it was still a bit too spicy for me. Next time I may add 2 cans of soup and 3/4 cup of salsa.  I made it without the tortillas, as a casserole and it was really yummy.

Mmm this recipe is definently a keeper.  I made the following modifications: 1 lb of ground turkey, 1 can black refried beans or just black beans, 12 corn tortillas (i dont like the flour because they get soggy), 1 can enchilada sauce because I didnt have salsa, and Healthy request condensed chicken soup.  This recipe does make 2 9X13 dishes, so i did put one in freezer for later and topped the cooked enchiladas with shred lettuce, diced avacado and tomato.  Yummy and satisfying!

I've made this recipe a couple of times for my family, which includes three young boys.  They love it.  I follow advice from other reviewers and add some onion and garlic to the meat as it cooks.  I also mix the meat, rice, cheese and refriend beans together to make preperation easier.  One final change...one review suggested 2 cans of soup to one jar of salsa and I think this is what really makes it a hit in my house!  Next time I'm going to try to make a healthier version with ground turkey, lowfat cheese, fat free soup, fat free refriend beans, and low carb tortillas - I have a feeling it will still be awesome.

Made these last night with my college buddies-- awesome!!! We used enchilada sauce instead of the soup and salsa combo (just to save on money) and mixed it with the leftover ground beef we had after stuffing the enchiladas to pour over them. We also added garlic powder to the beef-- forgot to get an oinion. They were a hit, easy and delicious!!

We really liked these.  But, we made 8 of them, in a 9x13 pan (just stuffed them with more filling).  I think next time I will add some onion to the mixture and maybe top with some jalapenos to give it a kick.

It was too hot for me, but I'm sensitive to spices. The rest of the family liked it as it is. I replaced soup and salsa with enchilada sauce. It was easy to make. I'll make it again, but reduce the seasoning.

Delicious! I followed the other reviewers, cooked the beef with minced garlic and onion, and added uncooked rice in the beef mixture and taco seasoning. I also mixed the beans in the beef and poured the salsa mixture all over the tortilla. Yummy! Will definitely make this again. A big hit to my DH. Thanks Stacy.

This was awesome! Even my picky eaters loved them! I only made one change~ I used spanish rice and added rotel to it instead of using plain rice. I really like this recipe as an alternative to using enchilada sauce, which no one in our family cares for. Thanks for the recipe =)

This was a quick easy and tasty meal to make. I did make a few changes. First I used cream of jalapeño soup because it is what I had on hand, also I only used half a jar of salsa. I used a Knorr brand "Mexican rice" mix and cooked it in with the ground beef. I didn't grease my pans but I did use some of the cream sauce mixture on the bottom instead, I did not have any problems with sticking. I spread the beans on the tortilla and sprinkled cheese and the meat/rice mixture and rolled. Topped with the cream sauce and extra cheese. Baked @ 350...this came out great!

This was simple, tasty, and my husband approved. That gets a thumbs up from me. I used AR Taco Seasoning I, left out the rice, and only used half the can of beans. I was about 2 oz. short of salsa, I used On The Border brand. I thought this was good but would rather have had a traditional red enchilada sauce instead. Thanks, this was a nice dish that we all enjoyed.

Delicious and easy to prepare.  I used mexican rice instead of plain white rice. And instead of the salsa and soup I used a can of Enchilada Sauce. I topped it off with cheddar, mozzarella, and colby cheese. I served with black olives and sour cream and salsa. Yummy.

Delicious!  My only complaint is that it made too much food for us (I expected the enchiladas to turn out a bit smaller).  My family compared them to Carlos O'Kelly's enchiladas.

These were great! And I really liked the fact that it made two meals! I used a package of Spanish rice which I just added to the browned hamburger and followed package instructions for amount of water and length of cooking. Served with salsa and sour cream, but didn't really need it. Was great without it too.

Easy and tasty.  I always get compliments whenever I serve it.  The last time I made it, I added 1/2 cup salsa to the water/taco seasoning and 1/2 sour cream to the salsa/soup mixture. Very good flavors.

I have made these several times and they always turn out great. Even my picky husband loves them (who does not like burritos, tacos, or any enchiladas but the cheese kind). I have never used the topping, and only add the cheddar when I bake them. Excellent and easy recipe!

This is definetly a keeper.  I used another reviewers advice, and cooked everything together.  browned the ground beef, added 2 cups of water, spanish rice uncooked and taco seasoning mix....let it simmer for about 20 minutes until juices soaked up, then added the can of refried beans.  I mixed mushroom, and cream of chicken soup in with the salsa, put about 2/3 of the sauce in one casserole.  and put cheese on top.  These are extremely filling.  Loved them!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.  This is my favorite so far!!!

Love this recipe.  I used Fiesta Nacho soup in place of the cream of chicken soup and it added just the right amount of extra flavor!  Highly recommend this recipe!

I wasn't thrilled with the final product. The meat probably should have simmered a while longer because it didn't absorb the taco seasoning flavor. The taste was a little off, next time I'll try a different recipe.

This was a definite hit with our family!  I added the onion and garlic per other review, and also used Cream of Mushroom soup with the salsa instead of Cream of Chicken.  My husband loved it and my little ones really enjoyed the meat/rice mixture separately (they don't care for casserole type meals).  We will add this as a staple to our menu!

The search for a good/quick/easy enchiladas recipe is over!! This is such a great dish.  Super easy and taste great.   I did modify it as many of the other users.  We used ground turkey cooked with onions and garlic and added a little cumin.  I also used instant rice and added it to the cooked ground turkey and taco meat.  Added a can of green chilis and 3 cups of water, covered until rice was done. It turn out so tastey I had to keep my husband and son out of it so I could stuff the tortillas. We also added a can of prepared redenchiladas sauce to the salsa/cream of chicken soup. Serve the extra sauce on the side with chips. Great meal going into the regular meal rotation!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used other reviewers suggestions to add flavor to the meat mixture and I highly recommend that. I also used a small jar of green chiles and I thought that added great flavor. It was a huge hit at my house. Thank you for the great recipe, it is my new favorite for enchiladas.

This was a hit!  I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions by using the lipton mexican packet rice. I also added onion and garlic to the meat while it was browning.  I love that you can freeze half for later!

We really enjoyed these! I was a little worried about the soup/salsa combo, but it was great. I used Campbell's Mushroom/Chicken Soup because I don't always like the plain cream of chicken taste in dishes. The only other changes I made were to add a clove of garlic while the meat was browning and I added a can of diced green chiles to the meat/rice mixture. Thank you!

these were really good!  I omitted the beans since my husband and I don't like them.  Other then that, the only drawback is using a lot of pots and pans and to cook everything separately and then having to have more cook time in the oven...not a good quick weeknight meal.  But when time permits, this is excellent!

I thought this was a terrific recipe! The directions seems a bit off to me though, I put 1/4 cup of the beef mixture in each tortilla as it said and had a TON left over and had to go back, open the already rolled tortillas, and fill them up with the rest of the mixture. I think that 1/2 a cup per tortilla is a bit more accurate! I also thought that more refried beans would make the recipe better, so the second time I made it I used another can and poured it on top with the salsa mixture and it was awesome!

Very tasty!  Next time I might double the sauce as I found the filling a tiny bit dry.  I added a small can of sliced black olives and used a Mexican cheese blend.  Definately a recipe worth repeating, so thanks Stacy!

My family loves this recipe!  I use half for dinner and freeze the rest-they are good after being frozen as well!  The only change that I make is to use mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar.

These were really tasty! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added onions and garlic powder when I cooked the ground beef. I mixed in yellow rice instead of white rice, but only because that's what I had on hand. Turned out really well! I was nervous about how the soup and the salsa would taste together, but it was indeed very tasty. :)

very tasty!!  made this last night - and all the ingredients were in my pantry!  very easy, but time consuming if you don't have rice already cooked.  i added some sliced olives and they were great.  recipe made a lot, enough for dinner, lunch, and more!

I have to say, I combined a couple of ideas from the enchilada section.  First, I would never use the packaged taco mix; much better to use your own spice mixture.  Cooked with ground turkey & scallions.  Added cooled rice. Didn't have cream of chicken, so used cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic, shredded sharp & jack & half sour cream half plain yogurt.  Spread soup/cheese mixture on tortilla, drop some spoonfuls of refried beans,top w/ meat mixture.  Enchilada sauce over prepared tortillas & extra cheese on top.  They were excellent!

This is a great recipe.  We usually serve it with hot sauce and sour cream on the side for those who want a little extra flavor, but it is fine without.  The best thing is that my husband likes to make it.  All I have to do is entertain the kids while he makes it then we all enjoy!

This is a good family meal.....simple and tasty. I liked that it made two pans.....easier for me! I took the second pan of enchiladas to a friend and she said she and her husband really enjoyed them. I had frozen them, and so she followed the directions for thawing and heating them, and said they were good.

These were good but seemed to be missing something. I'll definately make them again and add some onion and garlic to the meat as it browns. I increased the water to 2 3/4 cup and simmered 2 c. instant brown rice in the taco sauce/meat combo. The filling made 12 rather than 10 rolls and extra filling that I put into the fridge for lunch tomorrow. Love that I now have a meal in the freezer for another day!

Good stuff. I sauteed a diced onion with the ground beef, and also added some canned corn that needed using up. I also threw in a good dash of cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick. Nice easy tasty recipe. Thanks!

Came out perfect! Having leftovers tonight and can't wait! Used Taco Seasoning I recipe instead of packaged Taco Seasoning, since they have MSG. Hubby loved it too!

Excellent.  I used 2 chicken breasts, cooked in the slow cooker with 2 cups of water and taco seasoning, shredded, along with the rice.  I also added an extra can of cream of chicken soup, just because I like it SAUCY:)  It made 1-9x13" pan and 1-8x8 for 14 enchiladas, total.  Wonderful to enjoy today and know we've got dinner for another night.

Made these last night while looking for something last-minute to cook for supper.  They were good, not anything extraordinary, although I did like the sauce on top.

Really good and Really EASY!  I made a pan for us and froze another to keep on hand.  The frozen pan was just as good as the 'fresh' one.   We don't care for salsa so I used enchilada sauce and cheese soup (didn't have chix soup).  Anyway, it is great and lends itself to substitutions.
Thank you for sharing this recipie!

Really enjoyed these. Forget freezing one pan, I made both and we are all taking it for lunch tomorrow.

My 18 month old scarfed these down as well (made them with mild salsa). Added some black beans as well and the flavor was great.

Will definately make again!

Wonderful. So easy to make . My husband and I really liked them. I used brown rice and doubled the sauce and put a thin layer in the bottom of pan before putting in the filled tortillas, poured the rest on top and used the extra sauce in the bottom of the pan for dipping each bite into. Don't over stuff your tortillas as they will end up kinda dry. I did on a couple and it tasted better with the correct amount in them. I also added extra cheese on top. Will make again. I like that the leftover can be frozen.

Very good.  Super Easy!  I did add some things to the recipe that I had on hand.  I added some onion to the beef after it was cooked.  I then added a can of rotel tomatoes with green chilis.  I took advice from another reviewer and added the rice and refried beans to the meat/onion/rotel dish.  I even thickened it at the last minute with a dollap of sour cream.  I filled the tortillas and added the salsa/cream of chicken soup on top.  A great dish.  I will make again.

This is a great recipe, although I didn't particularly care for the sauce.  If you feel the same way, here's something that worked  for me -

Follow the recipe as is, until your beef/rice mixture is "completed".  After that, add two cans of refried beans.  If you are using a large skillet, your skillet will be very full, so be careful.  After the beef/bean/rice concoction has cooked until it's been warmed and thoroughly mixed, fill each tortilla with it.  You don't have to be too shy about how much you put in, you'll have plenty.

Instead of putting the two cups of cheese inside of the enchiladas, put it on top of the enchiladas.

In addition, there should be enough of the mixture to eat with some chips as an appetizer, while the meal cooks.

Either this way, or with the original sauce, this recipe is great.

I wouldn't say these are the best, but they were very good. The kids really liked them, nothing objectionable. I just didn't think they had much pizazz. They needed a spicier kick. Maybe more seasoning in the meat. I will try these again, maybe adding 1 and a half taco seasoning packets & medium salsa instead of mild. Nice & easy though - I made them all & had leftovers the next night! Serve atop lettuce shreds with a dollop of sour cream!

My kids gobbled this up which always makes a recipe a keeper!  
I used these changes as suggested by another reviewer. Super easy & tasty 

I browned the beef and added some minced onion and garlic. Then I poured in two cups of water and a package of Lipton Fiesta Sides Taco Rice. I brought to a boil and then simmered covered for 7 minutes. I mixed the meat/rice mixture with the refried beans and 1 cup of cheese so that I just had to scoop a 1/2 cup of the mixture into each tortilla instead of doing each ingredient seperately and taking twice as much time. I mixed 2 instead of 1 can of cream of chicken soup with 16oz mild salsa. I poured 1 cup of the sauce on the bottom of each pan and then placed the filled tortillas. Topped with the remaining sauce and sprinkled each pan with 1/2 cup of cheese. These would have been too salsa-y without the 2nd can of soup in my opinion.

Very good! I doubled the meat, rice, onions, spices and slow cooked. Used half for the meal and froze the other half for another day. Added black beans and corn. Subbed 2 canned tomatoes w chilies for salsa since it's cheaper. 8 flour tortillas fit nicely in my casserole dish. This dish is always a hit!

I made this recipe 4 times now. Twice exactly as written. Twice I sprinkled some drained and rinsed black beans in it. Both ways are great! Also I layered the ingredients like lasagna once instead of rolling each enchilada and it was great like that too.

Excellent recipe! I made a few changes to better suit our tastes: added onion and garlic to ground beef. I cooked 3/4 cup rice in 3/4 cup water, just until water was absorbed, then added to beef mixture with the water and taco seasoning. I also added about 1 cup cottage cheese to the beef mixture for additional creaminess. I also mixed refried beans and the 1 cup cheese right into the beef mixture to make assembly easier.

We don't use condensed soup, so for the sauce on top, I used mild red enchilada sauce and mixed in a few spoonfuls of sour cream. They turned out delicious!

Very good!  I used one pan for all 10 enchiladas and cooked it at the same temp and time as directed.  They came out perfectly.  I went by the recipe almost exactly except I cooked my rice with the cooked beef.  Used a Knorr Spanish Rice package and it added some great flavor.  I put a little salsa in the bottom of the pan before putting the enchiladas in like some of the previous reviews said to do.

We made this & everyone loved it. Even snuck in quinoa to replace the rice! It was goooood! I think next time we'll tweak it a bit: refried beans for black beans & corn.

Loved this recipe.  It was simple but it was still really good.  I used fat free sour cream instead of cream of chicken soup to make it healthier and it turned out great.  I put some of the salsa mixture on the inside of the enchilada as well and it made it so good.

I was hesitant because I never made enchiladas before but these came out delicious.   They will surely be added to my regular routine.  The best part about this recipe is that it's already set up to make an extra tray for the freezer.  I did use black beans instead of re fried and I also chopped an onion into the ground beef.  These weren't mushy as I feared and they turned out to be quite filling.  My husband struggled to finish two of them.  I think these would be quite appropriate to make for company or to bring to a party.  Wonderful.

My family loved this recipe!  The only change I made was using corn tortillas instead of flour.   It took a little longer for the prep since you have to fry the tortilla in oil until soft, but it was well worth the taste.

Very good and tasty. I will make it again. My son pronnounced this is his new favorite. Mexican in our house tends to be taco bar style ... so I slike the casserole version as it was a sit down emal together. I used a small amount of refried beans under the ground beef then cheese and served rice on the side. I LOVE the idea of soup on top versus cheese. I didnt have salsa either so added a mild hot sauce to flavor the soup. Thats saved a lot of calories yet looked and tasted like it was a cheese sauce.

Even with adding onions, garlic and green chiles to the beef, this was just OK.  I won't be making it again.

I did most everything that user  SHMANESSA8 suggested, such as sautee the beef with onions and minced garlic. 
I then added 2 cups of water and 2 bags of Success "uncooked" rice to the mixure and simmered until the rice was cooked(10 minutes).
I didn't have any refried beans so I added a can of dark red kidney beans and heated until hot.
This dish was excellent!

This was good. Really good. Better than I expected. I used multi grain tortillas and medium salsa. I thought I would taste the chicken from the cream of chicken soup but I didn't. I still think I'd try it with another soup next time. I served it with sour cream on the side.

Family loved it!  I took some of other reviewers ideas .... I used the taco rice, added beans and some cheese to mixture and just scooped on the flour tortilla.  I also added a little onion powder and garlic, and used not quite 2 cans of Cream of Chicken Soup with the 16oz jar of salsa.  One can was a little to much salsa taste, so added a half can more of soup and it was perfect!  We love salad with everything, so we topped ours with garden salad!  Pretty sure this is my husbands favorite NEW thing I have made in years!

I used store bought enchilada sauce to use instead of the salsa/cream of chicken soup combination.  This was amazing! Even my DH thought so! Next time I am going to try chicken instead of beef.

I can only rate the filling for these enchiladas. As I was getting ready to make the enchiladas my family was just too hungry so we used the filling, added cheese and made burritos. They were really good. I liked how the rice really made this dish go a long way. Tonight I will make enchiladas with what was left. It was great to make two dinners out of one pound of ground beef.* I made the enchiladas following the recipe and they were great! So many people went with an enchilada sauce but trust me the soup and salsa is amazing!! I was pretty skeptical but oh so surprised with the delicious results. Who knew? I highly recommend this recipe and follow it as written. It definitely makes a lot of food.

Amazing!! I only made a few changes to the recipe; I made my own taco seasoning, used cream of Mushroom soup (Instead of the cream of chicken) added a few cloves of crushed garlic and a shallot.  It is now a regular meal at our house!

Very delicous! My husband gave it a 10 Highest rating he has ever given. I took the advice of one of the other reviews. I added the cooked meat and taco mix in with the uncooked rice and water so the rice would take on the taco flavor. This dish was excellent. I would highly recommend it.

Quick to make. Easy. The soup and salsa mix for the topping could be jazzed up a bit. I think I will try a can of Rotel instead of salsa the next time.

These are delicious! Super easy to make and very satisfying. I only made two changes to the original recipe - I used minute rice and cooked it in the same pot as the beef, making for one less dish to clean up. I also used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of chicken and it made the sauce taste like nacho cheese. We served it with green olives, jalapenos, green onion and sour cream, and we loved them!! Definitely worth trying out.

I made these last night and my husband said they were better than the Enchiladas I always order at our local Mexican Restaurant.  I did make some changes.  I sauteed an onion in 2 Tbs Olive Oil then added the ground beef (I used sirloin).  I used Cream of Chicken Soup with Herbs because that was what I had on hand.  I ommitted the beans because I didn't have any.  And finally I had all the tortillas rolled up when I realized I forgot to put cheese in them so I just dumped all the cheese on top of the salsa/soup mixture.  Yummy!!

I think this is a very tasty recipe.  The fact that they can be frozen is great.  I tend to make this later in the week after I have had something else with rice. I double the rice for the first recipe and then I have cooked rice on hand for this dish.  Makes it easier for me to come home from work and prepare these quickly.

Fantastic recipe.  I did add some dried onions to the meat mixture while it was cooking.  I also used lipton fiesta rice to the meat (I didn't have any regular rice!).  And I used spicy encvhilada sauce because I had it on hand.  Great recipe and thanks for sharing.  This will become a family favorite!  I have a picky eater too and I think she really likes this!

My family LOVED this recipe.  Before I mention the changes I made, let me start out by saying that I found this recipe because I had left over brown rice and some ground turkey that needed to be cooked, so my changes were out of necessity, not because I thought they would improve the recipe.  That said, instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey.  The rice I used was brown rice, and I used sprounted grain tortillas, because that's what I had.  I probably used more cheese than the recipe, because I was afraid with the other changes, the recipe might be dry.  Even with all these "healthier" changes, the recipe was delicious, and I will definitely make this again!!!

We absolutly loved this, as this was my first time making enchaladas! I did make some personal changes, just to suit our own tastes and based on others reviews. I made extra rice, used olives, and I simply forgot to add the salsa, and I did leave out the chicken soup. I used enchalada sauce instead. I must say, I even had a friend from California, who knows mexican dishes say it tasted perfect. I will definetly be making this again!

My picky family loved this recipe.  I didn't have any refried beans so I used mild chili beans instead.  I also omitted the soup and used just salsa on the top. Used a large onion and baked some Spanish rice in the oven to place in because that's what I had on hand. Very YUMMY!!  Highly recommend!!

This is definately a staple recipe in our home.  I'm not a fan of beans so I  leave them out.  Often times I'll cook up chicken (diced - partially frozen for easier dicing) add taco seasoning, water, and rice for easier cleanup.  Then I'll finally add in 1/2 the cheese just before putting it into the tortilla.  Great week night dinner.  I always have leftovers which freeze great for workday lunches.

My family loved these. The only thing I did different was to warm the tortillas on top of my gas cooktop first. Lay the tortilla directly on top of the burner grate after turning the heat to low. Just about 5 sec on each side will do it. I find it give them a better taste.

Very good!  I sauted garlic and onion with ground beef and added the rice and water to the beef and cooked it together.  I also made my own cream of chicken soup and cooked it with the salsa to make a sauce for the top.

WOW! I love mexican food and this is going in my favorites.  I did make a few small changes - fried up one medium onion with the beef, 10 ounces of salsa and one can of cream of chicken soup and then topped it all off with 16 ounces of red enchilada sauce, then more cheese.  We like them to be really wet so I added more sauce although I had to cook about 8 minutes longer.  All in all super good - I was skeptical about the cream of chicken soup but it was fabulous!  Thanks for sharing!

A really wonderful recipe!  I made this tonight for the family and it was a hit!  All of the kids loved it and my oldest had 2nds,  my husband said they tasted like his favorite mexican restaurants and said these are a keeper for sure.  
I made it exactly as written except I used a can of red enchilada sauce instead of salsa.

I just reviewed my recipe box and this is my "go-to" enchilada recipe.  I like to double the recipe, assemble the tortillas, and freeze them.  I can then take out as many portions as I need, and assemble the casserole in less time.  A great way to make a meal quickly.

I have to say these were really tasty.  The only change I made was to add a chopped onion and added some garlic powder to the hamburg mix.  I loved how the taste of the sauce came out.  It was so good.  Will make again.

I made a few small changes to this recipe, first I cut up 1 small onion and added in, I did not have any refried beans in the cupboards so I used some leftover baked beans (I was really skeptical about this, but it turned out well considering the situation).  Also, I left out the cream of chicken soup, it just seemed like it did not belong; however my husband said he may have liked it, so the next time I will try it for him.  It seemed as though it could have used a little more taco seasoning than one pack, was a little weak on flavor for me.  Over all, this was a good recipe; although time consuming (took almost 2 hrs start to finish, mainly because of the rice), will be making it again in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were easy to make - and very tasty!  I used some leftover steak instead of the ground meat and used Velveeta cheese instead of the shredded cheese - it was what I had on hand.  I thought it turned out well - would like to try it next time with the shredded cheese (texture was a little off).  Otherwise terrific and next time I may throw in some veggies to give it some added nutritional value!

Great recipe...easy and tasty!!  I did make a few adjustments. (1) I only used half a jar of salsa mixed with one can of soup.  I agree with another review that said a whole jar would have been too salsa-y, but two cans of soup would have been too sauce-y.  (2) I used my family's simple taco meat recipe that complimented this one instead of using the packaged taco seasoning. - To browned ground beef I add some potatoes and carrots (already boiled and cut into 1/4-1/2 cubes)...adding veggies and texture.  To flavor the beef mixture I add salsa and ketchup, about 2 to 1.  I don't really measure, so just add a bit of each little by little to your taste and consistency desired (less wet or more wet).  Overall, a great recipe...one of the best I've tried from this site.  Thanks!

This is quick and delicious if you follow the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and add the rice to the ground beef to cook.  I had a tough time keeping my husband out of the mixture long enough to roll it up into the tortillas.  The only thing I'd change is the cream of chicken soup; I think it tastes kind of weird with ground beef.  Next time I'll try cream of mushroom instead.

I, personally, did not love this recipe.  The cream sauce (that you pour over the top) had a very sweet taste that grossed me out.  However, my boyfriend went crazy over these enchiladas. He said that they were the best enchiladas he has ever had (and he LOVES enchiladas).  When picking out a restaurant to go to several days later, he told me that he didn't want to go out for Mexican because he was afraid that their enchiladas wouldn't be as good as the enchiladas that I made.  That, alone, is reason enough to give this recipe a high rating.

Edited: It's been several months since I made this and my boyfriend STILL raves about it.  I might try making it again but this time substituting sour cream for the cream of chicken in the topping.  Maybe it will be less nauseating.

I love this recipe because I had all the ingredients already!  They were delicious and tasted even better the next day as leftovers.  The only complaint is that it makes more than enough filling for one pan of enchiladas.  I would suggest making one 13x9 inch pan and then another in a smaller 8x8 pan to freeze.  Thanks for the recipe and I will make again!

This was really great!  But I did do a few changes.  I used chicken instead of beef, omitted salsa all together, and added mexican rice.  On top I used a mild can of Red Enchilada sauce mixed with FF cream of chicken.  Sooo good!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was "alright".  I didn't like the soup mixture on top.  I would tweak this one a little before I would make it again.

My husband and his friend gave this recipe a five star rating.  I followed the recipe except that I used Mexican rice instead of regular rice and garnished it with sour cream.  I had quite a bit of the meat/rice mixture left so I spread it over the enchiladas along with the sauce and cheese.

Very easy and super filling.  You could easily add more things to spice it up.  But for picky families, this one is a keeper.

Very easy and quick to make, and good!!  I made a few changes to suit my picky eaters, and make it diabetic friendly.  I used ground turkey, skipped the beans (kids won't eat them), left out the rice (but may do brown rice next time), and used a reduced fat mexican cheese blend.  It was very tasty!!  Thanks!

I omitted the beans (husband doesn't like), sauteed the beef with a little minced garlic, used cream of chicken & mushroom soup, medium salsa, and replaced plain rice with lipton mexican rice. It was a little spicy but got raves from the family!

My 1- and 3-year-olds ate this up! The only changes I made: doubled the sauce, and used a box of Mexican rice rather than plain. The prep wasn't bad at all, and with the saucier version, it's fun to eat with chips.

It is *very* easy to burn the flour.  It is also helpful to have all the ingredients measured beforehand as the recipe came together quickly.  I thought it was oily, next time I will try it with 1/2 the oil.

So good!  Have made several times and are always a huge hit with friends & family.  I usually double the soup and salsa to give extra sauce to the dish.

It was very bland. My husband and I came to the conclusion that if this was called a burrito it would be okay but, since it is called an enchiladas I am going to say it is the worst one that I have ever had. I used spanish rice but, that still left for a bland taste. Kids may like it though because it is not spicy and it's cheese, meat, and beans.

OMG this is fantastic!!!  I did not add as much salsa to the soup as I was not sure if my 2yr old would find it too spicy, but she just devoured it (eating a whole enchilada by herself).  I served this with extra salsa and a crisp salad as it is quite rich.  Next time I will hide some veg in the sauce (by means of grating or pureeing the veg).  Cannot wait to eat the spare one in the freezer!  YUM!

My husband is not the pickiest of eaters but he also rarely mentions anything about what I make.  When I made these he said they were phenomenal and the best meal he has had in a long time.  I thought they were great too.  The only change I made was to use home made taco seasoning and I used Jalapeno Cheddar tortillas for the wraps.  Very yummy and I would definitely make again.  Using a medium salsa also helped with blending the chicken soup flavor.

These were good, not great.  However, I did not do the sauce as they had, so maybe that would have changed my rating.  I just used enchilada sauce from a can, which was good in itself, so my 4 rating is based on the meat mixture.  Like others I added some onion and garlic powder to the beef mixture.

Just what I was looking for, a new "ground beef dinner night" dish.  Easy to make and a step up from our usual taco night.  I added green chilies and garlic and onion to the ground beef.

This was wonderful!  I followed the recipe except I used Lipton Taco Rice. Added a big dollop of sour cream after they came out of the oven.  Delicious, this one is definitely a keeper!  (Also, the leftovers were wonderful also. I cook for two and was able to freeze the leftovers and have enough for dinner for two other nights!)

These were really good and I liked that they weren't too spicey.  Very easy to make too!

This was too basic, and something I've made up on my own many times.  The sauce was not great.

Maybe I'm spoiled by living in Houston and having access to some of the best Tex-Mex in the world, but for me, these were just "OK".  I must say, though, it was nice to have extras frozen, so dinner was a snap the next week.

Used 3/4 uncoked rice to get 2 cups cooked.  Used tex-mex shredded cheese.  Made 7 larger enchiladas instead of 10.  
These were good but I want to try other recipes, so many to try!!!  We preferred the cottage cheese chicken enchiladas just a little bit more.

It was good because it was quick and used very little dishes, but it was not great tasting I would consider them to be more of a smothered burrito. My boyfriend said they were better the day after.

These were very good, even better as leftovers.  The only issue I had was that it took sooo much longer than the recipe said it would.

Pretty good and I like the fact that you can freeze one batch and use later. It just needs some sour cream and guac. for the fresh taste. Cilantro added to the top is nice for a fresh kick too!

These were awesome - for some reason the tought of using cream of chicken over a beef recipe did not appeal to me, so I made two batches - one w/ cream of chicken and one w/ cheese soup - both were great.  Made this for company and sent some off and ate for another week on leftovers.  Will make again.

This was very good, but I think it had to much salsa. Next time I will use less and maybe use more cream of chicken.

I think this recipe could have done without the cream of chicken soup, but it wasn't bad and with a little tweaking, could be pretty good.

I used chicken instead of beef, a mix of wild and brown rice, and made my own taco seasoning (from allrecipes).  Otherwise I followed the directions and the meal was wonderful.  My husband didn't speak the entire time because he was too busy eating.  I think I had more rice than what was called for, but it worked really well.  I served with a side of corn and salad and my husband ended up putting his corn on his enchilada.  He was more than happy to have left overs for today.  We'll make this one a regular in our house.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great.  I added some scallions after I drained the beef.  I also used Salsa Verde condensed soup rather than chicken and it really added a great kick.  Great easy recipe.  Thanks!

This was quite good.  The only change I made was to use black beans instead of refried beans.  We liked it a lot.  I love the fact that I've got a dinner ready for next week too!  One can of black beans made 10 enchiladas for me and I still had enough meat filling for 4 more tortillas.  Nice bonus!

This recipe was a great stepping stone.  I found it doing an ingredient search and substituted shredded chicken for the beef.  I then added a few things, like green peppers, tomatoes and black beans to the meat.  Everyone loved it.

These were so good and easy.  I actually got 3 dishes out of this.  I just kept opening cans of refried beans.  I think I used 3.  This is a super cheap meal and my husband and I loved it.

We loved these Enchiladas!  I used black bean instead of the refried and I added them to the rice and meat while it was cooking and it was great.  As my wife said, "It's a Keeper!"

Very good.  Had no taco seasoning so I used spanish rice, added cumin and garlic powder to beef and added a can of tomatoes with chiles (undrained) to beef and rice mixture before heating together.  Soup and salsa can be heated together until well combined before pouring over the top.  To me these are baked beef, bean and cheese burritos with rice so if you don't like enchiladas you may still want to try this; the sauce is delicious but not at all a typical "enchilada" sauce.

This was pretty good.  I added garlic and chopped onion as most others did to the meat.  I think the sauce to go over the top was awesome.  I can't believe it was only chicken soup and salsa!  Yum!  Next time, I may try to put some of the sauce in the enchiladas in addition to on top?  It was just missing something.  Husband thought it was great though!  I will be making this again...for sure!

this was very good. i too added some onions and used ground turkey instead of beef. i also added some frank's hot sauce to the salsa/cream of chicken soup topping because i like a little kick. thanks for the recipe - i've already shared it with some co-workers!

Pleasantly surprised.  I switched the beef for turkey (trying to be more healthy) And it was very good.  I did add a pack of sazon- I like lots of flavor.  I wasn't sure about the salsa/ soup thing- but it worked out well.

I really thought that my family would "veto", though everyone loved this recipe!  I only made 6 Enchiladas and covered them with the salsa/soup mix.  I did sprinkle onions on top of the ones that my hubby would eat, and placed them in a bed of lettuce and cilantro.  YUM YUM  Thanks!  This is a keeper!

This recipe was great! I have a beef burrito recipe I normally use but wanted to try something different. I made this precisely as written and it earned rave reviews. Thank you.

My kids are ridiculously picky and weren't thrilled, but my husband liked it and I thought it was great.  We warmed up our leftovers from the first round the next day, and are having our frozen portion tonight--3 meals in all, which we really enjoy.  Thanks!

First time making enchiladas and it was very good.  I impressed my wife.  Didn't really like the topping sauce, I will probably do something a little "cheesier" next time.  Very handy having an extra batch in the freezer.

I have to say this was absolutely delicious. I made it for my son amd myself and it was better then eating at a Mexican recipe. I prettm much followed the recipe but made less echaladas but added more to each one. 
Simple to make and plenty leftover.
Thanks
