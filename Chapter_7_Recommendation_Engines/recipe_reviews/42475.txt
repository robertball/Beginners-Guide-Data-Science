Most Excellent!  I used coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla pudding  and real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip.  When you whip the cream, add 3 to 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar and it will stabilize just like Cool Whip.  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla to whipping cream.

I changed this a bit for the ingredients I had in my pantry. First I used Banana Cream Pudding, instead of vanilla, and I had some pound cake on hand;[I wanted to use up]for the wafers, and I used strawberries instead of banana's,[that was in the pudding]. Looked like it needed some chocolate so I put some chocolate syrup in the layers. SOO GOOD.

This is the absolute best banana pudding filling ever.  Another recipe on this site called for 3 cups of milk which after making this one doesn't make sense.  The 1 cup is great and makes it great. I don't like bananas so I only unsed 2 which was still plenty.  Next time I am going to bake a yellow cake mix and crumble it in the bottom and then layer the filling, bananas, and cake to make it just like baked banana pudding. Thanks for this great recipe!

Really good (and quick) recipe! My fiance' love, love, LOVES banana pudding and he was hesitant when he saw I wasn't making it from scratch (like usual). Just didn't feel up to the time consuming task of homemade custard/pudding.I added my own pinch of spices here & there, as well as a little lemon juice & crushed ginger snaps on top. 0ther than that, kept everything else the same.
 I have to say, this got better each day we ate it! Friends & coworkers loved it as well! Will make again!

Very good for a quick banana pudding. Took it to a work function and people were asking for recipe.

Awesome dessert! Refrigerating it for a few hours makes it even better. I used banana pudding mix because the kids love it, but I think they would have loved this even with the vanilla.

I put this in a rectangular/brownie pan and did 2 layers (wafers, bananas, toping) and it went over well. it's very rich so no one person will clean out the dish for you.  Bravo on this! Super easy and super yummy!!

I added 1 cup of sour cream to the pudding mixture and it turned out great.  It takes away some of the sweetness of the condensed milk.

This is very similar to one of my favorite banana pudding recipes, but I use French Vanilla pudding mix and Pepperidge Farm Chessman cookies in place of the vanilla wafers.  Yummmmmm!!!

Pudding is very good, but too many vanilla wafers.  About half as many wafers is enough.

Yum!  I messed up when making this and forgot to put the whipped topping in the pudding mixture so I put it on top.  Was still really yummy.  My only complaint is it doesn't save well because the bananas turn brown so you have to eat all of it the same day.

Very easy to make. Everyone who tried it gave great reviews.  I saw a previous review that said the recipe called for too many vanilla wafer cookies so I used about 2/3 of what was called for and this turned out to be plenty.
