I found myself wanting to add to this but have shared this on a lonely night when the winds were blowing... The heart/Home feeling to it was worth it's own simplicity - We continue to enjoy the friutes of our labours...

This recipe is the best pea soup I have ever tasted and I have been trying so many recipes I was about to give up. I did add a couple of bay leaves as I like to put them in all my soups and I didn't soak them in water overnight . I just rinsed them and followed the recipe. It was so easy and the end result is a definate winner.

April 19th, 2014 UPDATE: We make this soup about 3 or 4 times every year and it is splendid every time.  We always make it following a ham dinner so we can use the ham bone.  You have to try this recipe.  Serve with "Angel's Yummy Bruschetta. 

Feb 18, 2012 Review: Wow!  I love yellow pea soup from the can - never had I tried making a dried pea soup before.  I've tried other cooks handy work at pea soup and couldn't finish the bowl.  I had a nice ham bone and husband's encouragement - so I stayed as true to the recipe as I could.  I used 2 cups of homeade chicken stock and 6 cups of water with 2 packets of Knorr chicken OXO and three table spoons of chicken bovril. All else same-same. My children age 17 and 13 finished their bowls and we all agreed to add this recipe to the regular menu.  Yes, it's that good!  Thank you!

I did not have dried peas so I used frozen green peas. I added ham to it as I had left overs. I pureed the mixture as it was to watery for me.

Good as is! Memo to self, do some cutting on the shank first so it falls off.
