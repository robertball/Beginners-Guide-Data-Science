This came together so easily with the help of my food processor.  (Pulse to cut in the shortening/butter add remaining ingredients and process until it comes together.) It was simple and good.  Instead of all shortening I used 1/2 cup real butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening.  Also I didn't level off the baking powder so it was more of a heaping 1/4 tsp.  Thanks for sharing this.  I don't need to look any further for a great spritz recipe.

Definately easy to mix up.  As for taste - it was o.k., but we'd rather stick with butter over shortening.  My husband thought it had a "shortening aftertaste"

Yum yum yum!  I finally found the perfect Spritz recipe!  Simple..and delicious!  Only change I made was I used Butter flavored shortening.  And added about 1/8 more flour because I live in Colorado and always make adjustments for the altitude.  I colored half the batch with Forest Green gel food coloring..and they looked awesome!  THX for a great recipe!

Use butter not shortening! Butter makes all of the difference, the cookie will have a nice texture and taste.

I followed the recipe, but added peppermint extract and they were wonderful and very easy.  I loved them so much that I made up a couple of baggies filled with all dry ingredients, so next time I just have to cut in the shortening and the other wet ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

For those complaining about the use of butter....not everyone can digest milk protein, which is found in butter.  Thank you, Sherri, for providing this wonderful recipe. I'm participating in a cookie swap with my inlaws.  I couldn't fathom everyone getting to chow down on their own collection of cookies while my 11 year old nephew sat and watched without any of his own to enjoy.  I used butter flavored Crisco and they came out fantastic, every bit as good as my standard spritz cookies.  Thank you!

It turned out too dry to use in the cookie press. After I added 1/4 cup water, it worked better but still I had a hard time getting the cookies out of the press. My hand will never be the same! Once made, they tasted very good, however.

I tried three different recipes this year so far this is the only keeper. I had no problems except...I have six kids running around the kitchen and forgot to put sugar in the first test batch (only like 10 cookies) so I quickly added 1/2 cup sugar to the dough and they were just fine. update**I have now been using recipe for over a year and the quality ingredients you use makes the difference I use Pillsbury's best flour real butter 1/2 cup and butter flavored Crisco 1/2 cup I am trying to make some for Chistmas baskets but can't keep the hubby and kids out of them! My eggs also are already 1/4 cup so I just add a couple drops of water.

I'm not usually a big fan of Spritz cookies. Most are pasty and lack impact. This version was not like that at all! The flavor out of the oven was fantastic and two days later they were crispy yet buttery and lovely with coffee or tea. I used butter flavored shortening, which I believe made a huge difference. Taste aside, I still don't like cookie presses - pan in the butt to clean and very fussy.

Recipe was good.  I don't like the the instructions on the cookies.  I highly suggest baking them for about 7-8 minutes instead of 10.  Mine browned on the bottom.

Dough was too thick to go through my cookie press, I am using a Wilton battery operated press.  I think it would be fine with a manual press and I am going to get one.

I didn't have almond so I sprinkled a little cinnamon into the batter. I also used the butter flavored Crisco. I added tiny chocoloate chips, different flavors of fruit preserves, sprinkles, caramel, walnuts, and coconut to the tops of the cookies (of course only one flavor for each cookie). YUMMY!

These are yummy.  I made them with all butter, minus the almond extract (allergies).  I also added red food colouring and made them into little heart cookies for the school Valentine's cake fair tomorrow.  If they disappear as quickly as the tray I made for home testing, they will be a complete success!

I use the Pampered Chef Cookie Press and if I don't have problems getting the cookie to stick to the pan instead of the press, then it's a success.  These were a success.  I have another recipe that calls for 2 c of butter and didn't have the butter this year.  It lacks the buttery taste, but has almost the same texture.

Half butter and Half butter flavored Shortening works nice. Girls at the cookie decorating party ate before they could decorate. I made several batches using different flavors: peppermint, rum, almond, lemon, etc.

This was really easy and they came out great. I only made one change, and that was to use softened butter in place of half of the shortening. I did a regular batch, and added some peppermint extract to the second batch.

I made these with butter instead of shortening. They tasted fine, but the taste and texture wasn't worth the extra work of cutting in the butter. And I found the dough too sticky to work well in my cookie press. Will try another recipe next time.

This was our 2nd Christmas using this recipe for Spritz.    Recipes seem to work differently depending on the press you use and I had a difficult time finding just the right one for the Pampered Chef press.  I didn't need to refrigerate or anything - perfect recipe.

We really liked this cookie recipe! We left out the almond extract for our first batch because of allergies and we also used half shortening and half butter. We really liked the flavor and the consistency. We left one half of the batter white and colored the other half green and made trees and flowers. They look great and the taste and texture is perfect.
