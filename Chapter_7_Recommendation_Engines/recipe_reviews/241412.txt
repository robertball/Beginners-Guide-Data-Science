Bacon, pecans, and cayenne pepper...what's not to love here! I'd leave them whole though, the bits are just too crumb-like. Thanks for the recipe.

I just made these and they are yummy! I left pecan halfs whole, and sprinkled pinches of the coconut sugar when I removed them from oven, only because I don't like a lot of sweetness to my food. Will be making this again.

This recipe has a really great combination of flavors. I think they blend well together. I like my half pecans, so I ignored the direction to smash them up. I ended up taking them out at 45 minutes- my oven runs hot. After tasting them, I added more sugar, cayenne, and salt. The flavor is great, but wasn't as bold as I prefer after baking them. Still giving 5 stars because the seasoning combo was so great!

I have made this a couple of times now. It only takes a few minutes to mix up the ingredients. I leave the pecans hall instead of chopping them up. This is very tasty.
