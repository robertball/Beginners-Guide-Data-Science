The coating for the chicken is WONDERFUL.  However, I had some trouble with the sauce - cooking it for the recommended time on medium for so long made it quite blackened.  But it was delicious without the sauce too.

I fixed this recipe for my girlfriend on Valentine's Day and she absolutely loved it.  The seasonings are delicious.  The dish is pretty easy to make and done well, this dish is superb.

This recipe has some different combinations of flavors that sounded interesting, but didn't really work for me. The sauce had an odd flavor and I didn't think it went with the chicken at all. If I make this again I will not make the sauce, the chicken coating is flavorful enough in itself. I will also not fry it on the stovetop again as the chicken turned out really oily (so did the sauce). I think it would be just as good done in the oven as I have a similar recipe that cooks the chicken in the oven at 350 for about 50 minutes.

Good and tasty, though not as tangy as i would have hoped. Still, very heartening and I looked like a gourmet - way to impress the roommates!

This is one of the most wonderful chicken dishes I have ever had! I made it for our anniversary last night, and both my husband and I LOVED it.  I double-coated the chicken and dunked it in buttermilk to get the coating to stick.  I am definitely going to make this again.  It was wonderful! Kudos to you, Justin Parrott!

The ground almond is a nice coating for the chicken, and the dill makes the sauce smell very nice.  However, the amount of the spices is so little that their flavor really didn't come through at all.  Still, it does offer a nice presentation, and I agree that it looks very gourmet.

The smells, the texture, the taste-all fabulous. I had an abundance of fresh spinach in my fridge so chopped it up and threw it in the sauce at the last minute-healthy AND yummy!

My friend Zac and my dad really enjoyed this dish when I prepared it.  The only negative thing I can think of is that the preparation is a little complex. Really tasty!

There are a lot of steps for the recipe but it's pretty tasty and the presentation is pretty. I added cut-up asparagus to the sauce 5 minutes before it was done to give the dish extra color. Served with rice.

Delicious!  I tried this out on my husband but had to substitute the oranges with clementines.  Also noticed that you didn't need as much almonds as recipe calls for.  I ended up throwing out about half after I coated the chicken breasts.

The chicken was just OK. I should have listened to the other people who posted and said to double the spices in the chicken's coating. I couldn't even taste the different flavors which was very disappointing. It just tasted too greasy for my taste. I didn't like the sauce at all and my husband said he'd like it if the rosemary and thyme was cut in half. Would not make again.

If your going to use this recipe I would advise to use the almonds after cooking chicken.  And fry the chicken the way you may be use to.  Otherwise I absolutely disliked this recipe.

DO NOT TRY TO HALVE THIS RECIPE. The sauce burned like crazy. Very sad, had to use canned tomato sauce as a backup.

I gave this three stars because I thought it was rather bland.  First, I couldn't disagree more with the users who said the chicken was better without the sauce, the sauce was definitely my favorite part.  I cut the oil in half and it was still really oily for my taste. Another tip, do NOT skip the clarifying of the butter.  I ran out of oil/butter when frying the chicken breasts and just threw some in the pan and it burnt really quickly, whereas clarified butter doesn't burn as easily. I had extra almond/flour mixture and not enough tomato sauce, so that should be adjusted. It was a hit with my boyfriend and friends, and looked really great, but the flavors just didn't really come out.

I love the almond coated chicken concept for this recipe. However, I prefer to prepare a different sauce than the one used here. I make a lemon butter sauce to go with this chicken instead. Delicious!

This is a great recipe and very versatile.  I actually made it an Almond Crusted Tilapia with the same sauce and it was wonderful.  Great flavor and will definitely make again.

The chicken was wonderful, full of flavor and very crispy. The sauce on the other hand did not turn out at all. Still a good recipe but I would not try the sauce again.

This was very good.  I was worried about the rosemary being too overpowering, but it wasn't.  I would feel good serving this at a nice dinner party.

This was just ok. The sauce was too citrus tasting. I had to add a bit of sugar to balance it. Also I don't think the Rosemary worked very well with the citrus flavour.  The almond crust was nice but not as good as I had hoped.

I great recipe!! Though the prep time took me more like 15 min. I decided to lower the recomended amount of oranges and added a little more spice and found the balance of flavor to be great.

The almond crusting on the chicken is amazing!! I will definitley save that part to make again. I doubled the curry, tumeric and cumin. The citrus sauce was just ok.

This was pretty good!  I liked it, though there was a sort of curious flavour to it.  I think I'll chop my herbs a little more next time, maybe diminish on a few of them.

This was a fun new taste for my guests and I - the recipe is perfect for a small dinner party. I baked the chicken after coating it in egg and milk and the dry mix. Paired it with white rice and squash. The sauce was fantastic! I liked the taste of citrus from the orange peels combined with the tomato and fresh herb flavors.

I used grape tomatoes instead of roma, as that's what I had on hand. Other than that, I followed the recipe. For us, this dish was missing something. I would have liked the sauce to have more liquid. It was more of a relish than a sauce really. I did like the almond coating on the chicken, but like others mentioned, the spices were not prominent enough for our taste. Just seemed to be lacking in flavor overall. Sorry, but this was not for us.
