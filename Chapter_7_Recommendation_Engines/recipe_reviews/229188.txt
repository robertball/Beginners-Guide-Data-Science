I tried this, though on a smaller scale.  I found a "lower calorie" version by substituting a low fat yogurt in place of the full pint vinilla ice cream and using "dite" soda.  Then add sparkling wine.  A really fun New Year's party drink I think.  To try on friends this year.

My grandma made this...it was her "special occasion punch" and we all LOVED it.  It's simple, refreshing and yummy.

I made this for Christmas. Only about 1/4 was drank.  I threw the rest away.  Not to impressed with it

I made this for my husband's surprise party. We do not eat a lot of sugar so I wanted to alter it to make it not as sugary. I substituted Sprite 0 for 7 Up and Diet Orange for regular soda. I used rainbow sherbet for the ice-cream. It was a big hit and those who don't do sugar-free didn't notice the difference!
