Hey, this was a great quick dinner, and a nice change from rice. Thanks, Ruth - the kumquat and basil blend is a real winner!

Couldn't find kumquats at this time of year, so substituted strips of orange zest.  Never having eaten a kumquat, I can't say how the zest compares, but it was good.  It was a nice, quick weekday meal that everybody liked.

I used broccoli and mushrooms and didn't have tofu. This was easy, fast and I love the balance between the lemon juice, cumin and cayenne. Loved it!

This turned out very nice inspite of the fact that I did not have kumquats, onions and fresh basil:). Substituted lime pickle(without oil, speciality of North India) for kumquats and used dried basil. Thank you for a very interesting recipe.

I substituted mushrooms for the tofu, and I didn't have the b. wheat, so I used couscous.  It was great, I will definitely make it again.

Great taste, but a little dry. I added teriyaki sauce to the bulgur after it cooked. I also scrambled a few eggs into the mixture during the last three minutes of cooking, which gave it a nice flavor.
