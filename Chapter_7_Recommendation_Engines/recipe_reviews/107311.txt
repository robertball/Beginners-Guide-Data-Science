This was really good and easy to make.  I did mine in the slow cooker and had it on low for the day.  The only thing I would advise if doing in slow cooker is cut back on the water a little bit.  I liked how it came out, but was informed that while the taste was right on, it was a little soupy for how the dish is supposed to be.  The flavours were wonderful. I had to buy a few of the spices since I have never made indian quisine before and have never used them. Definately worth the small investment.

I love this recipe! It's my new favorite! I will make it over and over again. I wouldn't call it "broken thermostat" because it's not too hot, but as the submitter said, it's "mildly spicy." I think I'll add more red pepper flakes next time. Also, I cut this in half and it was perfect. I was wary about the yams--but they were great! I served it over jasmine rice and am thoroughly enjoying it right now!

Great!  I accidentally mistimed the chapatis I made to go with this, so it overcooked a bit and the cauliflower disappeared.  Turned out to be a great mistake--my finicky husband loved it...and he hates cauliflower.  This is a keeper.  The spices were just right for us and we chose to add salt at the table.  Served it with plain yogurt, jalape√±o, and cilantro.  Yum!

Needed a little salt to give it more flavor, but my wife and I enjoyed it. (Kids refused to try it since it had cauliflower in it.)
Don't know why it's called "Broken Thermostat Curry" though, since I really couldn't taste the peppers at all. Would be inclined to double-up on the cayenne next time. 
But a good, healthy recipe.

My boyfriend has long stated that he does not like curry but went nuts for this recipe.  He asks for it on a regular basis. If you're a fan of spicy foods, I would add more red pepper flak and cayenne than what this recipe calls for.  For true spicy fans, this curry is a little too mild as is. I substituted chicken stock for the water, double the yams, and used about half the amount of potatoes.  I also used canned diced carrots to save time and energy. This is a fabulous recipe that also freezes well.  I highly recommend it.

Not impressed with this recipe--it's incredibly bland!  I've tried this recipe twice and been disappointed both times.  Adding salt is an option for creating some taste but i try to avoid adding salt whenever possible.  I ended up adding cashews and raisins but as is i wouldn't even want to eat this.

At first it tasted a little bland.  Also many said it wasn't hot so I made it as dinner for all including 13 month old son.  It was a little too spicy for him and for me it was a bit spicy.  My hubby agreed with others though.  So I guess that all depends.  I would next time add less potato and more yam.  Also, I added a can of coconut milk.  That was a great improvement.  I also added vegetarian chicken to it.  Mealstarters found at most any big chain grocery store in the freezer section.  I would rate it a four and a half after all my changes.  HEHE.

This was pretty good.  It was missing something so I added a bit of salt and some raisins from Trader Joe's (jumbo raisin medley). I served this with a seared salmon curry dish from this site, homemade naan from this sire and tofu/garbanzo beans with a masala sauce and mango chutney.  yum yum

my first try at curry.  Very yummy.  I added a bit more cayanne and red pepper flakes.  It was almost too spicy, but our tounges got used to it.  My kids liked it too.  My husband said it needed meat, of course, although I did think as eating it chicken would be good in it.

Fabulous! I like spicy foods, so I ramped up the cumin, curry, cayenne and pepper flakes. I used peas instead of the cauliflower, and added an individual can of V8 juice with the carrots and onions, then reduced the water to 1 1/2 c.  It was every bit as good as what we get at our local Indian deli.  This one's a keeper.

I really didn't like this. 30 minutes isn't long enough to cook the sweet potatoes.

Found this thru a search looking to use some yams.  Used fresh romas instead of canned and instead of water I used a box of chicken broth that was seasoned with coconut and coriander. Added chickpeas and green peas. For the curry powder I used 1 t mild and 1 t HOT.  In the end I added another t HOT, just right.

Very delicious but still very mild.  I doubled the amount of spices suggested but still found it a bit on the bland side. Great recipe though...I would make it again.

Found this recipe using the ingredient search. I did not have a yam but a lot of cauliflower and had crushed tomatoes instead of diced. I think it worked out well and enjoyed the flavor.

My boys hate it when I add vegetables to a meat curry. Now I make this one as a side dish and find it is eaten first!

Did it a little bit differently, but I liked it overall. Thanks!
