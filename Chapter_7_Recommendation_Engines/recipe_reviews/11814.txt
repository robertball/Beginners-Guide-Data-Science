Out of this world!  A good friend is a chef, so I was nervous about cooking for him and his wife.  He RAVED and offered me a job in his restaurant!  Even my husband, who isn't wild about pasta, couldn't get enough.  Like some other reviewers, I reduced the butter and used the oil from the oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes and the result was great.  I also used 6 oz. clam juice and 4 oz. white wine then reduced before adding 1/4 c. cream.  Finished with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and served with a simple mixed green salad and lots of crusty bread.

One cup of fat is completely out of control, so I reduced it to 4T altogether (half butter, half oil) and it still tasted great!  I also thickened the sauce a bit with cornstarch and doubled both the sun-dried tomatoes and the parsley.  I found that the best way to chop sun-dried tomatoes is with a strong pair kitchen scissors. Then soak them in boiling water for 15 minutes.

I should start out by saying that it's not often that I rate a recipe 5 stars, but I would give this recipe 6 if I could!  I did modify it a little bit though.  First, I scaled the recipe to two servings; I reduced the olive oil to 2 generous Tbsp and used the correct amount of butter; I added a large(ish) shallot along with 3 cloves of garlic.  Once this was softened in the oil, I added the clam juice and the shrimp and scallops and cooked them *almost* through.  I removed the seafood and reduced the remaining liquid by half (the seafood gave off quite a bit of liquid).  Then I added about 1/4 cup of 10% cream; added the seafood back to the pan along with the rest of the ingredients (I used about 1/3 cup chopped, dried sundried tomatoes which I'd rehydrated in some water) and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  I poured this over the pasta and added a grating of fresh parmesan cheese.  The end result was absolutely delicious! It would also be a good dish to serve to company.

Oh my.  I would give this ten stars if it were a choice.  This was just sublime.  I made it as described with the addition of 1/4 c half and half to give the sauce a little more body.  It was scrumptious!  My husband stopped mid-first bite, looked up at me, chewed, swallowed, and said reverently, "This is the BEST thing you have ever made."  We all (including 2 year old daughter and 4 year old son) thought it was wonderful.  Next time I will add a few more sundried tomatoes, but other than that, it is perfect, truly one of the best I've ever tried.  Thank you so much for sharing this easy but company-quality dinner dish.  Garlic bread for sopping up the sauce is a MUST!  YUM!

What gives you the right to low-ball a recipe that you haven't even tried. Personally, I found this dish to be absolutely outstanding - Yes, it is very rich . . . but the key word is 'Moderation'.  Will definitely make it again.

Like this recipe a lot; if you have a Trader Joe's in your area, I used their Frozen Seafood Mix (shrimp, calamari, scallops)instead of just shrimp and scallops (because I love calamari!)and served it over TJ's garlic & basil linguine. Served it with a salad for guests and it was gobbled up!

YUM!!  Thanks!  I decided that both butter and olive oil was too much for me, so I only used butter this time around (I figured that I'd try the fattening version first to see if I like it, and then make it healthy later).  Also, I used about 3X the amount of tomatoes and a few sprigs of lemon thyme while sauteing.  It was great!  Thanks again!

Great! I followed some suggestions posted before. Reduced the butter, used reserved oil from sun dried tomatoes, used 4 oz clam juice, 4 oz white wine, 2 oz heavy cream, reduced the sauce and added a little basil with parsley and some shaved parm cheese as a final note. Spectacular!  My family asked for seconds and thirds.

Excellent dish!  I scaled this down just for the 2 of us and had to swap out the scallops for some lobster chunks, but I think any combo of seafood would be fabulous.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and many more sun-dried tomatoes, also added a splash each of white wine and 2% evaporated milk along with the clam juice (had the milk to use up and love the white wine for the flavour with seafood).  Will make again for sure, very yummy!

Excellent.  I used sea scallops instead (the bigger ones) and added a little white wine and lemon juice to the seafood.  Served it over angel hair pasta and sprinkled with some parmesean cheese.  My husband and I cleaned our plates.  Thanks!

It was very tasty. I did it with seafood blend brought from TJ's and basil and garlic linguine. I put 3 tablespoons of butter, and no olive oil, than added garlic. Later I added seafood blend and sun dried tomatoes, waited for 5 minutes and poured some half and half in it. I had to use corn starch to make the sauce thicker. In the end I poured shrimp with sauce over linguine and squeezed some lemon juice on it. It is very fast to make, it took me only 15 minutes, so I will be using this recipe again. Thanks!!!

Solid, restraunt quality dish. I used sundried tomatoes in olive oil. They were easy to dice and soft enough to chew. Let olive oil to drain, what's left that still be enough. So, I did not add any olive oil to the sauce and used butter just enough to saute the galic. Keep in mind that if you use less ingredients for the sauce then you should reduce the amount of red pepper flakes, unless you like spicy dishes. Do not omit lemon zest. When making a sauce you may want to reduce clam juice a little prior to adding prawns and scallops. The dish looks very beautiful. Tastes interesting. Overall - restraunt quality.

This was so good. Didn't have shrimp so I substituted clams. Didn't have parsley either. I added 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter. Also left salt out since my dad has high blood pressure, but I ended up adding some later for myself. I plan on sticking this recipe into the regular rotation.

I made it almost exactly according to the directions with 2 exceptions. I added a shallot with the garlic and after sauteing the seafood, I removed it from the pan (and kept warm) and added the clam juice. After reducing the clam juice, I added the seafood back in with the remaining ingedients. It was awesome. My guests loved it.

Easy and elegant - but be sure to follow the advice of the poster and have all ingredients ready before starting - makes it really smooth.  I used more sun-dried tomatoes, and served it on a white china platter.  I used just 8 oz dry pasta and we had more sauce to dip bread in.  My husband commented that it looked more like a dish we would have gotten at Buca's.

This one stays in my recipe box! Didn't change a thing. Don't be put off by the liquid consistency. It's perfect for sopping up with garlic bread. Have everything ready to go. It's a quick and easy recipe. My husband just said it was EXCELLENT!

This recipe was very good. I was afraid it would taste too fishy (seafoody), but I was pleasantly surprised at how light and fresh this was. I made several changes: I used fresh spinach linguini. I also decreased fat to about 3/4 c total (splitting between oo and butter). I didn't use the whole jar of clam juice, I thought it was a bit much, and thickened the sauce a bit with heavy whipping cream (about 1/4c). At the end I mixed in a squirt of fresh lemon juice, along with the zest, and topped with shaved parmasean cheese and fresh basil, instead of parsley. YUM. My husband, who really doesn't like seafood all that much had seconds! He loved it.

This recipe got great reviews and has become a favourite in our house!  Because it doesn't have a cream sauce, the sauce does not become too thick if left for a few extra minutes.  Very good!

Turned out delish!!!! I didnt have any scallops on hand but I most definitely will next time. I also added some white wine and 1/2 of a fresh squeezed lemon to the shrimp. I couldnt find any clam juice at the store so I just bought a can of clams and added the whole thing. Will make again!!!!

The only seafood I had on hand was canned baby clams and minced clams, so this is what I used.  I also reduced both the butter and oil to 3/8 cup each, and per another review, I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.  What a great combination of flavors!  My husband rated this 9 1/2 out of 10.  I will definitely make this again.

I did cut the butter and oil in half and I added clams since using the clam juice. Other than that, everyone was really happy.

This is a awesome recipe.  The only changes I made were adding the clams along with the clam juice and thickened the sauce with a little flour.  I will make this again and again.

I hesitate to review this because I didn't make it exactly the way stated in the recipe due to ingredients I had on hand. That being said, I would imagine it to be a good, basic recipe but nothing that would be extraordinary. Used fresh lemon basil in place of the zest and that gave it a fresh flavor but I can see it being brighter with the zest. I'll try it again the right way and leave a final review.

This was so good! I made this as written and the only thing I would do differently next time is to cut the olive oil and butter down by at least half. It was a little to greasy to us but the flavor was out of this world.

I made this tonight looking for something different for dinner. Took some of the recommended changes like the half and half and corn starch to thicken but also added mushrooms and artichoke hearts. It was absolutely amazing!!  I definate must keep in the recipe folder!

Superb recipe. I followed it pretty closely, other than adding in an extra half pound of scallops. My family said it was outstanding, something they rarely say about a particular recipe. Tasted like a gourmet meal, truly.

This recipe is a keeper.  I made as instructed except added a little salt and a little heavy cream at the end as other reviewers suggested (but I don't think the cream was needed).  I also didn't cook the shrimp and scallops as long as the recipe says. Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing this.

Having read the reviews (all of them!) I decided to reduce the sauce at the end and add some cream. I was told by my family to make it again anytime!!

amazing dish! does not take long at all to put this together. followed other reviewers' suggestions and used clam juice/white wine mix for sauce. reduced this and added little under 1/4 cup of cream. also added some red pepper flakes and a squirt of lemon juice. the lemon zest and juice add such a fresh, clean taste to this meal. served with a pinot grigio and baguette. beautiful and tasty!

Liked this, though I only had shrimp.  Would have been better with both.  Used more sun dried tomatoes and served it over mushroom raviolis.

WONDERFUL!! This is a GREAT. Recipe.  I went out on a limb and made it the first time for company which I never do.  WOW.  It was a HIT.  I read all the reviews... Kept the butter and oil the same.  

Things I changed:  I used angel hair. It soaks up more flavor.  Added fresh basil and I used sea salt, so I added additional salt to taste (about 1/4 tsp).  Added 6oz clam juice and 1/2C white wine.  I also added half and half and a little corn starch to thicken. 1 minute before adding the  seafood to the pasta, I stirred in 8oz jumbo lump crab meat. 

Wish I had used all 8oz of clam juice and added more wine because more sauce would've been nice.  There was sufficient sauce, but it was so good that more would've been better.  I just ate some leftovers sprinkled with fine grated cheddar/jack.  I served with steamed spinach and crusty bread.  GREAT meal.

Everyone loved it! I added more chili flakes and used jumbo prawns (no scallops at market). I drained off some of the excess sauce to try and shave off a few calories. Wishful thinking? Will do it again for sure!

Okay, the lemon zest didn't seem to fit, and I had to add more seasonings. I will make again, but only for myself.  My husband didn't care for it at all.

You've gotta be kidding me.  Take a look at all that butter and olive oil and the CALORIES and FAT content of this dish!  I can only wonder who would make this.  Not me!  There are a lot healthier and delicious dishes out there than this one.

Wow!  I rarely rate recipes unless they are exception or awful, but this one was great!  I changed a couple of things: I used 1/2 the amount of butter and oil and then sauteed the garlic.  I then added the clam juice, sun dried tomato pieces (already softened with boiling water), salt and dried parsley. I let this cook for a while and then added a little bit more clam juice.  I added the shrimp (I used 2 lbs of shrimp instead of using two kinds of seafood), and as it was cooking, I added a bit of heavy cream/whipping cream to make the sauce a little more substantial.  I omitted the lemon zest as well as the pepper.  I just didn't think it needed it.  It was fabulous.  Thanks again.

Great recipe!  Very easy to prepare and very flavorful.  The only change we would make is to increase the amounts of lemon zest and red pepper flakes to give it a more distinctive flavor.  Thanks for giving us this one!

Awful. One of the worst recipes I've made from this site. This dish has absolutely no flavor. I kept thinking when I looked at the ingredient list where the flavor would come from, there isn't any.

This dish was great! A couple of changes I made: I seared my sea scallops in a hot pan first, then removed them and used the same pan to cook the shrimp and "sauce." Added extra garlic and a shallot.  I deglazed the pan with white wine only (no clam juice), and added some steamed broccoli for some extra color and nutrition. Added pasta and scallops at the very end, and then hit the whole pan with a generous squeeze of the remaining lemon. Delish!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it like the recipe except that I doubled the pepperflakes... next time I'll do even more. Lots of sauce so use a full pkg of noodles. Used more tomatoes than asked. I have also omitted the clam juice and used white wine. I can't have dairy so I use the oil from the sun dried tomatoes instead of the butter. Super yummy!

I thickened the sauce a little with corn starch, doubled the tomatoes and added a squeeze of lemon juice in addition to the zest.  Company worthy.  Delicious.

This came out great.  I did make some changes.  We had some leftover cooked shrimp scampi from the night before.
Cooked the garlic in some butter and olive oil until aromatic.  Added a bottle of clam juice and more dried tomatoes than they said.  Cooked and reduced this down to not quite half.  Added the shrimp to warm, a little heavy cream and the lemon zest, salt, and freshly ground pepper.  Also added about a half cup of freshly grated Parmesan.  Cooked until slightly thickened.  Served over fettuccine with summer squash.  YUM!

This is awesome.  I didn't use the clam juice, lemon zest, parsley or red pepper and only used half the butter and then added some sautéed onions.  There was enough juice in the seafood though it was a bit thin.  I used some homemade dried tomatoes that I had just made the day before and they were so flavorful that I didn't need the other flavors except added a little salt and pepper on the plate.
I used a frozen seafood medley of calamari, shrimp, scallops and clams from Gordon's.  So very good....

Used 1/2 the butter & oil. Added 2T. cornstarch to thicken & 1/4c. 1/2 & 1/2.  First time ever I would give unlimited stars if I could.  We live on Cape Cod and it's bay scallop season...we LOVE it.  Thank you so very much for a great recipe!  We'll do it with sea scallops on New Years Eve for the entire family.

Everyone raves about this one!!  I use less oil and butter (about 1/2) and will use less clam juice next time - there is a little too much liquid, I think.

Not to thrilled with this dish!  Could have had better flavor.  It wasnt aweful, and my husband liked it but it wasnt anything to write home about!  Probably wont make again.  There are other recipes that we like much better!

This is tasty! Used much less butter and oil than the recipe called for and only used clams, shrimp, and a little cream at the end. Also added lots of mushrooms, and lots of crushed red pepper flakes. Tasted even better the next day.

I had to substitute clams for the scallops, no scallops at my tiny grocery store today.  But, it was still great.  My husband loved it. Next time, I will make the forty time trip to the next town to get scallops and lobster.  Thanks so much.  It is always great to get new pasta recipes that taste this good!

I found this to be very good.  I left out the scallops (as my husband does not like them) and doubled the prawns.  Although I enjoyed this very much I would probably not make it again as it turns out my husband does not like lemon zest or sun dried tomatores either!

Excellent recipe! I LOVE this dish! I substituted clams instead of scallops because I can't eat scallops, and added mushrooms. This is a favorite of mine now! Very good - make sure to add the lemon zest, it really adds a good flavor to the dish!

This was delicious when I made it last night. I've made some tweaks:  I ran out of linguine and added some fetticcine to the pot. My bay scallops were big, so I split them into halves. And my frozen shrimp were extra large, which came out all right. I didn't have lemon zest, so I used lemon juice instead. It was so good! I would make it again!

One of my favourite recipes! Only advice is watch the red pepper flakes; a little too much can really tilt the balance of this dish.

This was delicious! Instead of clam juice I made it a creamy white sauce by adding heavy whipping cream and a mix of shredded Italian cheeses. More fattening, but worth it!

I followed the suggestions from some of the other reviews and pulled the seafood when they were mostly cooked. I then added lemon juice and half and half to the sauce and let it thicken up. I served it with a baby spinach salad with balsamic vinaigrette and french bread. It was a huge hit with my date.

My husband and I loved this dish. We made it almost exactly as directed this time (used Penzey's dried minced lemon peel instead of fresh zest), but next time I plan to double the amount of sun-dried tomatoes and add a tablespoon or two of rinsed capers. But that's just due to our personal preference, not because the recipe is lacking in any way. It's excellent just like it is.

This recipe is great without being altered at all.  However, I think the amount of olive oil and butter is too excessive.  I've tried it without the olive oil at all - only butter - and it's just as good.  I regularly make this recipe, and after looking at the comments, I think I'm going to try adding basil and shaved Parmesan cheese next time.  I love scallops, but they can be expensive and sometimes difficult to find where I am, but it's still very good with just shrimp.

Great Pasta! I used a veggie based pasta medley instead of linguine - Any pasta will do.  omitted the shrimp and used a can of whole baby clams and their juice instead of just clam juice.
The sauce was indeed scrumptious.  Fresh Bay of Fundy scallops make the dish.  This recipe is a keeper.

It came out great!! Only change I made was to add a little half and half to it to thicken the sauce. It was delicious and I will definitely be making this again.  This is a keeper? It got rave reviews !

Maybe I did something wrong :-( but I didn't find this to be tasty like so many of the reviews mentioned. I tried some of the alterations, but not my favorite.

I've made this many times to impress guests and family and there are never leftovers. Like other reviewers I also half the oil and butter, and the clam juice as well, since the dish can get watery (especially once the seafood is added). Good quality sundried tomatoes is also pretty key. I serve it with homemade garlic bread and kale Caesar salad - yumm x10!

Very refreshing and simple to make.  My husband requested more tomatoes next time, so I think I might test this out with some fresh tomatoes cooked for a few min. with the shrimp and scallops before I toss them in with the pasta.

Nice suggestion with the citrus! The family loved it. You can tell they do more than tolerate your cooking when they go in for seconds! Good recipe, though more fatty than I prefer this dish had an excellent flavor.

Really good!  simple and light, I added a little heavy cream after allowing the sauce to reduce, make sure to remove the seafood if you're going to reduce the sauce.

I followed the recipe other than halting it since I was only cooking for a couple, and I added some herbes de Provence to the oil/butter with the garlic. I'll definitely make this again soon, and that's rare for me.

This recipe is just superb! It's my husband's bday and thought of doing something different than the usual bday spaghetti.. I'm glad I came across this recipe! Since I made 2lbs of linguine, I also added  mussel meat with the scallops and shrimps :)
My family raved about it! Thanks!

I made this dish today & it was delish! I made it exactly according to directions. I tasted it just before I served it & decided to add a few sprinkles of granulated garlic because I felt it needed it! This was a wonderfully easy & tasty dish to make. My compliments to the chef!

I've made this a few times already. The only adjustment I made, from the second time on of making it, was using only half the oil. This is so very good. I'm making this again tonight I am going to add some chopped clams to the mix. This recipe is very versatile..you can add whatever to it and it will still be delicious. Add other seafood, spices, more or this less of that. One of the best recipes I've found online.

Great recipe. I left out the scallops for taste preference and halfed the butter as it was just too much fat for me. Delicious regardless!

I hadn't read the reviews prior to following this recipe exactly using all fresh ingredients.  My wife said exactly what was on my mind.  It was pretty bland as it was.  I also found it to be oilier than I cared for.  The reviews stated what I was thinking.  Less oil, replace half of the clam juice with white wine and reduce a bit (with cooked seafood removed of course).  Next time I think I will also add a shallot and some basil.

This recipe was Amazing. The different flavors of the recipe combined really well. The only thing I changed was instead of just clam juice, I added chopped clams. This comes in a can as well. Just added to the seafood variety! I absolutely recommend making this. This is a recipe meant to impress. :)

This seemed like it had too much liquid.  I think it's possible that a longer simmering time is called for.

Delicious meal. Love the combination of lemon, red pepper, and sun-dried tomato. Great flavors. Just keep an eye on those shrimp and don't overcook them! Ten minutes plus three more minutes with the clam juice will yield some pretty tough shrimp.

I loved this. I used two tablespoons butter and two of olive oil; might've added a tad more but it was great. No clam juice so all white wine with a little fresh lemon juice. Used flour to thicken. Dee-lish!

Awesome!!  Added more sundried tomatoes, and marinated artichokes.  Quick and easy.  I also halved the olive oil and butter since I was only making a small batch for 2 people, and used locally caught fresh shrimp.  Its officially "added to the rotation" at our house!

My husband and I went to Italy for our honeymoon and we had a VERY similar dish at a restaurant on the Amalfi coast. Unlike many pasta dishes, it's super light and crisp. This is our go to pasta dish always!

This recipe was just ok. Surprised it has such a high rating.
 THe ingredients did not marry well, it was better the next day believe it or not as all of the ingredients were all mixed and heated together. If i do make it again, instead I will add the tomatoes etc to the sauce. Also, the sauce seemed a bit watery, i like a thicker sauce.

Very good sauce.
I did not have all shrimp or scallops so I used three cans of clams instead. It was delicious!
I will certainly try this recipe again with the proper seafood!

Delish! I found this to be a light and refreshing meal, but all that butter and oil certainly didn't make it lowfat! I did reduce the amount of butter and oil. I really enjoyed the lemony flavor of the lemon zest. I will probably add more sun dried tomatoes the next time I make it.

This dish was descent. Doesn't have to much flavor to it though and I followed it to a tee. It's overrated if you'd ask me.

I don't know why this has gotten such good reviews because I didn't think it was good at all.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it was just bland to me.

Star, you are a "star".  This is as fine a seafood recipe as I have ever enjoyed.  It rates right up there with the best you'll find at a great seafood restaurant.  I don't recommend changing anything.  The flavors blend beautifully. An added benefit is that it's so simple to prepare.  But take her advice and have all the ingredients prepared and ready before starting. This is wonderful.. thanks.

I couldn't get enough of this dish.  I utilized some of the helpful comments from others and cut back on some of the butter, added some half and half, and used 2 lbs shrimp, no scallops.  Loved it.  Made enough to have leftovers for a couple of meals.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Instead of scallops I used lobster pieces.  It was good, but I did need to pick up the salt and pepper shaker at the table.

This is a very good recipe, but I agree with other reviewers that the oil/butter can be reduced without hurting the finished product at all. I loved the lemon zest flavor and will increase it next time around. Also, more parsley and garlic :) Thanks, Star!

I soaked the sundried tomatoes in boiling water for about 5 minutes and then drained & chopped them.  My husband suggested chopping them into even smaller pieces next time as he felt the tomatoes were strong tasting.  I only used olive oil (as it's healthier than butter); next time, I'll try about a third cup of oil.  I only used 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper flakes & 1/2 lb. whole wheat angel hair pasta.  I added parmesan at the table too.  Next time, I'm going to try adding some sherry or white wine for added flavor.
