My family thought this recipe was plenty sweet. I made it with canned peaches in Heavy syrup, so maybe that helped. I suggest cooking it in a larger than 8x8 pan. I found that the cake was so moist and dense that the center never seemed to get done, and it almost over flowed. I ended up covering it with foil. Over all baking time for me was 1 hr 15 minutes. It was really really good and I'm definitely keeping this recipe. It would probably even work for dessert!!

It's summer so I used fresh peaches... I cut up 6 but I think next time, I'll use 7 or 8.  I used less sugar and spiced it up some with cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg.  I didn't have any orange juice so I used apple juice.  I put it in a 8 x 10 glass casserole.  I cooked it for about one hour and it was pretty much done.  I will make this again.  Thanx for the recipe!

I used the canned peaches in this recipe. I found that it lacked a lot of flavor.  Unless I change the recipe, I wouldn't try it again.  Sorry David.

We enjoyed this cake very much.  I also found that it was still gooey in the center after 45 minutes, but I just let it cook for 10 more minutes and then turned off the oven and let it sit for another 15 and it was perfect.  I also used a 25 oz. jar of peaches, so found that the volume was just right and didn't overflow the pan.  I look forward to trying this recipe again with other fruit!  Thanks!

I really like this recipe because it doesn't call for a cake mix and then pudding mix and then other processed items.  I live in Guatemala and those things exist, but not commonly, and usually are off brands or of lower quality.  I prefer using natural ingredients as much as possible.  

Like many others, I made a few changes to the basic recipe. I used butter rather than oil in the peach mixture as well as added a half teaspoon of salt to kill some of  the sweetness of canned peaches.  I added about a Tbsp of cinnamon to the mixture because, hey, I love cinnamon.  I also added the juice of the zested limes -- can't get lemons here -- to the batter for a bit of extra flavor. The resultant cake is fabulous, light, rich and delicious.  Allrecipes is making me famous here among the community because I'm always finding new and interesting recipes to delight my friends and neighbors.  Thanks a lot.

This is one of the best recipes. I didn't have peaches, but I did have nectarines. They worked great. Now I'm going to make it with canned peaches, I read some reviews saying it was too sweet. If you use peaches with any kind of syrup then adjust sugar accordingly. I will make this many times. Thank you David. :)

I should have read the reviews first.  This is good, but a little too sweet for my tastes.  The cinnamon idea would also be good.  I used 3 fresh peaches, which was just enough to fill the 8x8x2 pan.  My husband is gluten-intolerant, so I substituted gluten-free flour and xanthan gum and that part was perfect.
