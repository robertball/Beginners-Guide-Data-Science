Even though we are garlic lovers in this house, after reading the reviews of others, I decided to make a few changes to the recipe. Instead of the 2 tbsp of garlic powder, I sprinkled garlic powder, along with salt and pepper over the chops (so used less than 1 tsp total), then I rubbed in the minced garlic as called for, into the chops. I then browned the chops as Mitzi8 suggested, and then added the water and worchestershire sauce mixture, along with 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar to the browned chops. While the chops were simmering, I sauteed the mushrooms (doubled the amount) and onions in a small skillet in 2 tsp of butter, and added them to the chops with about 5 minutes left in the cooking. The result was delicious - my husband gave it 'the highest stars.'

I thought this might be too salty with 1 tsp. salt, but followed recipe exactly anyway.  They were not too salty,however, I think they were too PEPPERY and the Worcestershire was too prominent in my opinion. I baked an additional 20 minutes @375, after braising the second 10 minutes;due to my chops were really thick. They were juicy and the mushrooms were great, it was quick, and pretty good. Maybe if you added a little something sweet like balsamic vinegar or maple syrup it would of balanced out the flavor more. I will try again, doing that.

very good! instead of putting mine in a skillet, I baked them. I rubbed the pork with the dry ingredients and put them in the oven 350x45minutes.  While they were baking I put the minced garlic, worchestershire sauce, and water in a saucepan to heat up, then drizzled it on top when the chops were done. I omitted the onion and mushrooms. But fantastic!!!

Good home cooking, husband and son both loved it, I was OK with it, hence the 4 stars. I rubbed pork chops with 1 tsp garlic powder, salt and pepper. I browned chops, removed them, then sauteed the onions and mushhrooms in dripping until soft. I then added garlic and sauteed until I could smell it (hate burnt garlic, it's so bitter!). Added chops back along with rest of ingredients and simmered 1/2 hour.

This was De-Li-cious! If you love garlic this is just excellent. I followed the measurements for dry spices as directed and used about 5 cloves of garlic and smothered them on one side of each chop after rubbing them down with the spices. I browned them first an sauted the onion rings & mushrooms in butter flavored cooking spray and tablespoon of butter as other reviewers suggested. Even though I think I slightly overcooked them, the worchestire sauce mixture, kept the chops moist. My husband and I really enjoyed these and will definately make again, with more mushrooms and more sauce. I plan on slicing up the left over 2 chops and toasting them in a sandwich roll w/ more sauted onion, mushroom, bellpeppers and cheese! Thank You!!!

We liked this recipe.  I used 32 ounces of mushrooms and the same amount of Worsestershire and water.  I browned then removed the chops adding them once again after the vegetables were cooked.  I then cooked the pork for 10 minutes and thickened the sauce with flour to go over rice.  Served with fresh green beans and baked bread. Easy to prepare.  I will make this recipe again.

This is a staple in my dinner now. I have made it around 4x and now make about 5 or more pork chops, and then after cooked, I add onions/mushrooms a little more water for about 8 mins then add on top of pork chops. It taste great every time I make it.

I agree with most reviewers this was very good. It was tender and had a bit of a kick, too. I did have to add water a couple extra times or it would have dried out. Still, I would definitely recommend it.

This recipe had my favorite ingredients in it, but there was definitely something missing in the way of flavor. I used Colgin's Hickory Smoked Worcestershire Sauce, McCormick's Smokey Slack Pepper and I can tell that these added an extra "kick" which helped, but even with loads of garlic (never enough), I still couldn't find the taste. I usually use a pork rub and will have to stick to that for now.

I really enjoyed this -- great taste, really easy to prepare.  I did it precisely as prescribed.  Perhaps my stove was too hot, as the sauce dried out by the end of the cook time.  I added a bit of red wine towards the end to revive, and all was well.  DELICIOUS!

A great new date/company staple - cook time is perfect, and so easy! I heeded the advice about the garlic -- just sprinkled my chops with a little garlic powder, salt and pepper, and tossed on some lemon pepper, and rubbed that all in, and followed the rest of the instructions. The onions weren't quite done at the end, so I removed the chops and added in a little butter (hee), salt and pepper to give them a flavor boost. Next time I'd double the sauce recipe and serve over mashed potatoes. Moist, juicy, and the flavor was delicate and not overpowering. I think this is as about as spectacular as it's going to get if I'm doing the cooking -  Y-U-M!

Per another reviewer, I rubbed the pork chops with 1 tsp garlic powder, salt and pepper. I made double the amount of the Worcestershire & water mix. I browned the chops then removed them so I could sauteed the onions, garlic and mushrooms in dripping until soft. Then I put everything back in the pan to finish cooking it.   It was an okay recipe.

This was very good.  :)  I used less pepper than the recipe called for, but it was still a little too peppery for us.  I'll tweak it a little (which is why I didn't rate it 5 stars), but we'll definitely have these again some time.

This is a good recipe, but I altered it, and will do further alteration.  First, I cut the salt in half, and because I was out of garlic (out of garlic?  What the heck!?!?) I used only powdered garlic. At the end of cooking, I pulled the chops and most of the mushrooms and onions out of the skillet and kept warm in the oven.  I thickened the sauce with corn starch, and added some milk.  The sauce was still QUITE spicy ... too much black pepper.  

The next time I make it will be with fresh garlic, and half the pepper.  

I also made stuffing (OK - Stovetop stuffing) with carrots and served the chops and stuffing w/carrots with the sauce on top, quite a good and tasty meal, for not very much work.

My husband makes this recipe, I got him to cook one day while he was home from work due to inclimate weather.  I was VERY impressed, and he now calls himself a good cook!  :)  This is a definate keeper.  Very tender juicy pork chops with a kick.  May need to cut Garlic in half, it is a bit much, we did the second time around.  We were quite stinky for a day or so.

I can barely boil water. This recipe was easy enough that I was actually able to make something edible. This is not just edible. This is DELICIOUS! 

Only things I did different was:

1. put the rub on the pork chops and brown them slightly on both sides. I added just a touch of ground red pepper so it would have a little spice

2. put mushrooms, onion, sliced red pepper in a separate pan w/2 tbsp butter then added it to the pork chops for the last 5 minutes of cooking

First time making pork chops, this was an excellent recipe. My pork chops were rather large so I had to cook a bit longer and add a bit more liquid (added a splash of red wine) but overall they were quite tasty.

Loved it! Instead of water I used chicken broth for extra flavor. I also cooked the mushrooms down more after removing the done pork chops from the pan. It cooked down to a thinned out sauce which worked perfect with Jasmine rice. It was amazing. Every bit my toddler and husband took I heard a ummmm, so I know it was a hit!

Very good, simple recipe. I made almost exactly as described except I browned chops on both sides before adding worcestershire  and water. I coated onions with basalmic vinegar and added added them at the end with about 10 minutes left to cook. After browning and adding liquid,  I cooked with a lid on the pot to keep everything from evaporating.

This was great.  I didn't have mushrooms/onions so I added sweet red pepper. I also substituted chicken stock for the water and added a splash of wine.

I would replace half the Worcestershire with balsamic. It was delicious, but a little more peppery than I like.

Good flavor for the pork!  Left out the onions and mushrooms due to time constraints but otherwise pretty good.

I think this was very tasty and my meat stayed moist.  I'll use the left overs for a casserole.  It's a great seasoning!!

I thought this sounded good but it was very blaw and bland I think there is too much water not enough salt and its missing something like maybe a dash of thyme or rosemerry maybe some sage

Way too garlicky, and we love garlic in this house. It completely overwhelmed the dish. In the future, I would omit the garlic powder and just use minced.

I thought this was just okay. I made it exactly as written, and even though I like garlic, I thought this was way too garlicky. I used some fairly large boneless pork loin chops, so there was lots of surface area for the seasoning, but it was just too much, in my opinion. It's a good idea, but the proportions just seemed off to me.
