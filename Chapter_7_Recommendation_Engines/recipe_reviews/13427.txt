Great flavor although I did add a few extra touches. Some herbs garlic powder plenty of salt and fresh parsley and chives to top it off! Made a great meal with some fresh bread. Next time I will probably add extra bacon to please my man:)

Delicious but labor intensive so do yourself a favor and use bacon bits from a bag. The quantities might be a little off because I halved everything and still had a LOT more than 4 servings. I don't think I'll make it again just because it takes too long but the taste is perfect! Enjoy:)

didn't care for this- how ironic to say add the healthy carrots when the soup has 71 grams of FAT and over 1000 calories! Not a good soup for the heart!

I have made this soup too many times to count and it always comes out perfect! This is my gran-daughter's favorite soup. The only change I made was I use 1 stick of butter instead of the margarine. It does take time but it is so worth it!

I added more spices and did not add the margarine. I sauteed the onions celery and garlic in the bacon fat. It was a hit with the family but will not make this often as it contains a LOT of fat and calories.
