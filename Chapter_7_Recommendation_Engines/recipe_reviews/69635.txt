I just made this soup for dinner and loved it! I did make some personal tweeks. I added roasted garlic cloves, used only 1/2 a cauliflower (that all I had) and used less broth as others had suggested. I also added navy beans instead of cream. They gave it a thick rich texture and added protein. It tuned out to be a real stick to your ribs soup. Perfect for a cold night.

I love this soup and have it for lunch nearly every day. The texture is a bit more thin than a Potato and Leek Soup but that is to be expected in a low carb version and the flavor is outstanding. I now make it with 6 cups of broth instead of 8 but it's great either way. I also wanted to mention that if what you want is potato and leek soup then MAKE potato and leek soup and refrain from giving this recipe a low score because it isn't something that it never claimed to be. It's not rocket science people. Really. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is a great light dinner, if it's for 1 or 2 people, there's plenty of leftovers to take to work for lunch! Low-carb, low-calorie, can be low fat depending on your use of heavy cream. I've made this twice, and I've made a few enhancements I think bring more flavor without adding anything unhealthy: -Roast the cauliflower in the oven - set the broiler to 500, break cauliflower into florets and place on baking sheet; spray with cooking spray and place on 2nd rack from the top. Roast until tips have a nice amount of browning (not burning!) and it's soft (doesn't need to be tender - it will finish cooking in the soup). Roasting enhances the final color of the soup as well. -Roast a thickly sliced shallot with the cauliflower, and add to the soup. -Add a yellow (can use sweet) onion to the pot when sauteeing leeks. -Saute some spices with the leeks/onions - I added fresh ground pepper, ground red pepper, and garam masala (an indian spice) for a bit of smokiness. Experiment! This soup BEGS for spices! -Try half&half or lowfat sour cream spooned over each serving. Tastes just as good. -Garnish each bowl with some thinly sliced chives and a thin drizzle of olive oil.  In all, a good soup, and my first time working with leeks - but use it as the foundation of introducing some spices or fresh herbs you particularly like - it's a little under-seasoned as-is.

I only used two ginormous leeks and organic chicken broth because that was what I had on hand. I sauteed two chopped zucchini with the garlic and leeks because I had to use them or lose them. I only pureed the cauliflower and chicken broth which meant I had to cook them seperate in another pot. It didn't take 45 minutes, more like 15. I gave it a taste without the milk and I thought it didn't need it, just a little more spice (onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flake, rosemary). I threw in about a cup of chopped ham because I had some I needed to use. Really yummy. It totally makes you think you're having potato soup when you aren't. This is going to be a treat for me this week. Thank you for sharing! EDITED: And yes, this soup is even better the next day. It's totally like potato soup. It's fauxtato soup!

This recipe was really easy.  I didn't have any vegetable broth in the house, so I used chicken stock and it came out great.  I also mixed a few teaspoons of cornstarch in with the cream before adding it at the end.  It thickened up nicely and had a great consistancy.

Excellent!  Normally, I avoid anything marked "low carb" like the plague, but gave this one a shot.  Every time I make this, I'm honour bound to bring some in to my staff, as they absolutely LOVE it.  If I don't have three leeks, I substitute an onion.  I also increased the garlic (well, doubled it, really) because I love garlic.  It's fantastic!!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

What a wonderful soup!! After reading the reviews, I used only 6 cups of stock and found it to be just right. It wasn't bad without the cream, but I crave that velvety goodness of cream soups. Use a dusting of curry powder or not; delicious both ways.

Fresh, rich and delicious, and I just couldn't get over the velvety smooth texture of this.  I did add the optional cream, but only half the amount called for and it seemed just right.  I used chicken broth rather than the vegetable broth, again, less than what the recipe directed, about six cups rather than eight.  I'm glad I did, as I wouldn't want to "water down" the flavor. Very beautiful, elegant soup, perfect as a starter to our steak dinner, but would be equally as appropriate to accompany a sandwich.

I am on a lowfat/lowcarb diet so I made the following alterations and it was super healthy and DELICIOUS!

-no butter
-no heavy cream
-just enough olive oil to coat bottom of the pan before adding in veggies
-added dried oregano & red pepper flakes & 1 extra clove of garlic
-used 5  cups (not 8) of low sodium chicken broth instead of veg broth
-roasted the cauliflower first in the oven (sprayed it with PAM so it didnt stick to baking sheet.

I found that all these changes made the soup thicker, creamier & quite flavorful with a bit of kick. Without the cream, butter & oil it has little to no fat.

I made a couple of changes to this recipe, I made extra cauliflower and set aside some of it to add later so that there would be chunks (more satisfying), and we served it with a dollop of sour cream...........delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good!  I roasted the cauliflower with salt, pepper, and garlic oil prior to sauteeing and skipped the optional cream.  The end result was surprisingly filling and satisfying.  I resisted the urge to add additional herbs/spices to this dish, and I'm glad.  I think anything than salt & pepper may have overpowered the delicate leek/cauliflower flavor.

I was looking for a low cal, low carb soup.  After cooking, I split the soup into portions so I could blend it in my blender. After  half of the soup was blended, I tried it. It turned out pretty yucky and bland (I did not want to add the heavy cream). But I didn't want waste the giant pot of soup and all of my effort, so I added half a can of coconut milk and some green curry spice and a bit of yogurt to make a curry-like soup.  To the soup I hadn't blended, I added tomatoes, artichokes and 2 Tbs of pesto and ended up with an Italian veggie soup. This recipe might be a base for a healthy soup, but "doctoring up" is needed.

I used purple cauliflower because that's all I had...weird but okay. Be careful with the salt since the broth most likely has plenty. Next time I'll leave aside some boiled cauliflower and leeks and chop it up and add it in at the end to make the consistency more interesting (I'm not much of a smooth soup person).

I had my doubts about this one, but it turned out delicious!  I didn't see the comments about using less broth beforehand and I would use about a cup and a half or so less next time.  DO NOT ADD the cream- it is NOT needed!  I made half for my vegan family members without and it was fantastic, then added some cream to the second half, and it wasn't as good.  I also added a can of white beans for extra heartiness, I recommend that as well!

I love this recipe! I always roast my cauliflower on a cookie sheet with the garlic instead of saute-ing it in the pan. Just drizzle the bottom of the cookie sheet with the olive oil, place the cauliflower and garlic on top, then drizzle some more oil on top and broil until the garlic is a light brown color. Repeat the same steps throughout and enjoy!

Awesome soup! I made a couple of changes.  I only used 4 cups of chicken stock (All I had) It was a think soup and more filling.  I also used 6oz of fat free plain greek yogurt instead of the cream and added it right into the soup.  It added a little protein and no fat but still made it rich and creamy.  It was even better the next day and the yogurt in it holds up to reheating without curdling.  Yummy!

I made this recipe the first time as the recipe states,I tasted it without the cream because I was hoping to get an awessome result without all the fat. the cream totally enhances this soup. the next time I made this soup I just used it as a base, I know this is a whole other recipe but seriously... you should try it adding 1/2 tsp paprika 1 tsp curry and about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. after I pureed the cauliflower I added frozen zucchini,summer squash and carrot medly. It was sooo good!I think I will puree it all together next time because I really like the cream soup texture. the rating I gave is for the original recipe. I just thought I would mention the changes I made in case someone else was looking to spice it up a little.

I added a can of great northern beans, and mixed a little cornstarch into about 1/2 cup of 1% milk.  Added a little cayenne for a bit of a kick, and wow!  This soup was not only way better than I expected it to be, it was awesome!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks :)

Just made this soup for the first time tonight and it was fabulous!  I did as others suggested and broiled the cauliflower & garlic with olive oil , salt & pepper until slightly golden.  I only used 5 cups of broth and boiled everything for only 20 minutes.  I did use the heavy cream in the end and I think this what put it over the top-delicious!

I can't believe this is healthy ... to die for.  Only modification: We used half chicken stock, half vegetable stock because that's what we had available.  Used all 8 cups and we ground pepper into it.  New favourite!!!!!!!!!!!

I've been on a low-carb diet for a few weeks and really felt the need for a good vegtable dish. This really hit the spot. I followed the directions to the T and it came out great. I highly recommend it.

This was great! I added thyme and italian seasoning. Instead of cream I added some water to a can of cannelli beans and blended until smooth. This thickened the soup and added protein...perfect!

One of our favorites. I reduce the amount of broth to 5 or 6 cups (we use chicken broth), add roasted garlic and a dash of white wine, throw in some Parmesan cheese before blending, and garnish with curry spice. It never lets us down!!

Great recipie.  I added coconut milk instead of cream and coconut oil instead of butter to make this a dairy free recipe.  Also added a bit more garlic! Delicious - my 11 year old daughter LOVES this soup!

Excellent soup without adding in the merit of it also being low carb.  The thinner version works well as a chilled summer soup but by all means reduce liquid if you want something thicker.  I used half the browning fats & chicken stock/half vegie as it was what I had on hand.  Also used 1 cup evaporated WHOLE milk instead of heavy cream.  Easy to make, really easy to consume and a hit with my adult family.

This soup is fabulous! I used crushed peppercorn to give it a nice kick and it did.  I also added one can of cannellini beans which added protein and a nice thickness so I didn't need to use the heavy cream or anything for that matter to get it to a nice thick, creamy consistency.

What a great soup. I  roasted the cauliflower and used sage as my spice. The heavy cream was not necessary. The texture and taste was first class. Thanks drumnwrite

This recipe is awesome. If I knew that low carb diets were this easy I would have done it a long time ago. Instead of heavy cream I use butter milk and I use my own homemade stock. The best soups are made when you use homemade stock. It is easy to make.

For my first time making soup (other than Top Ramen of course), this turned out fantastic. I halved the recipe to reduce to 6 servings, and based on the feedback of others, I made a few changes.  I roasted the cauliflower and garlic just enough to brown them before adding them to the pot. I also minced a shallot and sauteed it with the leeks, garlic, and cauliflower. For the broth, I used the full recommended amount of broth (4 cups for the halved recipe), but I used half vegetable and half chicken, both with lower than normal sodium. Once the broth was in, I also added one peeled and cubed potato.  Beyond the basic seasoning, I also added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, cumin, and a small amount of general Italian seasoning mix. The cumin went well with the roasted cauliflower and garlic, and while I may have added a wee bit too much cayenne, the soup was definitely not bland and I will make it again. It's also very filling, and a little bit of it goes a long way.

I actually put 5 leeks because it was going to be a little too watery and added some spices (garlic powder, basil) and it turned out good.  I would re-do again.

I had lots of leeks in the house that I had to get rid of before they went bad.  This low carb recipe is a winner.  Many commenters said it was too watery so I took advice of others and used only 7 cups of broth (I used chicken).  It turned out thick.  You might want to even try it with only 6 cups of broth and add more broth at the end to get the consistency that you want.  Definitely use that cream!!!  Thanks submitter.

So delicious!   I omitted the butter and cream, and used plain nonfat greek yogurt instead - and it was fantastic, and guilt free!   Gave it the creamy texture without the added fat and calories of butter and cream.  So, so good.

Very much like potato soup in a low carb version. You should increase spices to taste. I like more garlic, spice blend, more leaks, etc.

I have made this twice so far and it has turned out wonderful. There are some great additions offered by other reviewers that I used: white wine, curry, and substituting chicken broth for veg broth. I steamed the cauliflower instead of sauteing or roasting. Also, I skipped the heavy cream and only blended half of the soup as I like bits of cauliflower in the puree. The consistency is better if you add extra cauliflower or use a cup or two less broth. Still, a great recipe. Big thanks!

YUM!!!!!  ...sooo creamy and delicious.  Unique flavors blend well together making this soup a definite keeper. Once made, it is impossible to know that this is cauliflower.  I followed the ingredients except I used a 32 ounce box of chicken broth and a bag of frozen cauliflower (defrosted, of course) and I wish I had not tried to half the recipe.  My husband and I loved it for dinner as an appetizer, and I had it for lunch twice.  Certainly could have made the entire recipe and enjoyed it for another dinner and lunch.  Next time, I will prepare the full recipe and even consider tripling it for our Thanksgiving feast.  Go for it!

Both my partner and I thought this was excellent. I agree with the reviewers who have suggested cutting back the on the liquid. In fact, next time I will add 5 cups of broth. For those who are truly "low carbing," non need to cut back on the cream unless the calories are a concern. The cream helps make the dish really luxurious! For the reviewer who said she avoids low carb recipes "like the plague," I have to wonder why. Most LC recipes are very delicious, it's the low fat dishes that tend to lack flavor. True, there are some weird LC recipes out there (mock french toast made with pork rinds--it is seriously pretty tasty), but most LC recipes aren't strange--just short on starches and sugars.

This was a wonderful soup. It diffently needs the cream, it really cut down the overwhelming flavor of the leeks in this soup. I will make this again with 1 less leek because mine were totally huge flintstone size, and I tasted more leek then califlower, but that's because of how big mine were. Other then that, I got my son to eat it and that made me giggle beyond belief because he doesn't like califlower. My family thoroughly enjoyed this very much and it made a great addition to my recipe box. Well done! Thank you.

This is my favorite fall soup!  I make it exactly as the recipe calls for, but I don't add the cream.  It's a very forgiving recipe and super easy to make.  Sometimes my carnivorous husband likes to sprinkle bacon crumbles on the top, but I prefer mine with a little extra pepper.

I made a half a recipe and was pleasantly surprised at how much flavor this soup had for being low carb and low calorie.  My soup turned out more brownish in color than the photos, almost looking like butternut squash soup.   The veggies were pretty brown after sauteeing for 10 minutes, already starting to caramelize and sweeten.  I used Kitchen Basics Vegetable Stock (only brand I use for boxed broths and stocks) which is deeper in color and richer in flavor than many others.  I think those two things made the appearance a little different than what you'd expect from cauliflower and leeks.  I did add just a little bit of cream but also added some FF plain yogurt, as well, which I think enhanced the flavor.   Thanks DRUMNWRITE , this is a keeper.

I just made this soup.  I reduced the broth to 6 cups, only had two leeks but they were huge, and did not add the cream.  I am on a very strict eating plan and can't have any salt or dairy, and nothing tastes good anymore.  But this soup was amazing!  I can only imagine that with the addition of salt and the cream it would be even more outstanding.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Fabulous recipe but fat-free half-and-half can be substituted for heavy cream without diminishing flavor but cutting fat and calories.  I use this for all cream soups and recipes calling for cream.  They can not stock it on the shelves of my grocer!!!

I have made this soup so many times since finding this recipe! This is a really great vegetarian soup. I follow it exactly, except I puree about half the vegetables and leave the others. I like the chunks of cauliflower and leeks. I also use half and half instead of cream. At the end, I stir in some yellow curry powder and we top with sour cream. Delicious!

This was a delicious soup idea though I altered the recipe a bit. I did not use butter or cream, but I did include a few shallots because I had them on hand. I made two versions: one with cumin and a touch of curry powder for a truly warming soup inside, and one with rosemary, time a basil for a savory soup. Both delish!

This was too watery, even after I added a small potato.  I much prefer a regular "Leek & Potato" soup. If you cut back on the liquid, it would be better and it's an OK dish for calorie counters. Just not my taste

Have made this twice now (only recently discovered it) and the only changes I made were to use just 6 cups of broth, as many other reviewers noted, and I used chicken broth instead of vegetable (just personal preference). With the cream being optional, I used 1/2 cup cream in the first batch, but my vote is to not use it at all. Delicious!!

Loved the combination of cauliflower and leeks. The only change that I made was to purée a can of garbanzo beans instead of the cream. Will be making again.

I am so not a cook.  But this recipe was so easy - and so good.  I even got a call to make it for our family Thanksgiving dinner --- now that is a recommendation!! Didn't change a thing.

This is terrific! I used less broth and skipped the cream. I also added some herbs. I am on a strict low carb diet and thought this was even better than potato-leek soup. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really enjoyed the light taste of this, although I wish it had a little more seasoning.  Thanks to this recipe, though, I know use leeks much more often.  Delicious soup, and healthy too!

I really got a very good response from making this soup.  I did tweak it just a little bit by adding 1/8 of a purple onion and 1/8 of a white onion finely diced and i used this BEAUTIFUL purple cauliflower.  I added white pepper and 1/2 the salt in the cooking process.  I also forgot to cover it so i just added some more water.  Really tasty and really beautiful!

Fantastic flavor! I used only what I had on hand: 1/2 Cauliflower head, 2 cups Chicken Broth & 1 cup water, 4 garlic cloves, 2 Leeks, and 1 Tablespoon Low fat Evaporated Milk powder (creamier & no fat).  Thank you so much for this recipe. Happy cooking everyone.

We liked it!  Something different.  Only had chicken stock and used 6 cups of that.  Did not have any cream, but didn't need it.  Tasted good with some shredded cheese in it.  Would make again.

I used roasted garlic and Better Than Bouillon brand vegetable broth. Instead of simmering the cauliflower 45 minutes, I roasted it at 425F for 15, while the rest of the soup ingredients simmered. Then I blended everything in the blender with 8oz tofu to make it creamy. Took about 25 mins start to end.   I'm sure I could get the same level of creaminess as regular potato & leek soup if I doubled the tofu next time. If you don't have a huge blender, you can do this in batches. I also think you can use onion powder if you don't have leeks or onion and it will be fine. Great recipe!

The day I made this...I did not enjoy it. It was rather bland and reminded me a bit of baby food. However, the second day, I topped with a couple TBS of Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese. The flavors in the soup really came together after sitting for a day! I did only use 4 cups of broth (chicken) and 1/2 cup of heavy cream because my cauliflower bunch was rather small. I also roasted my garlic and cauliflower to bump up the flavor as others had recommended. I'll make again, but wait until the 2nd day to eat it :)

EXCELLENT soup!  I adjusted the following ingredients: 6 cups of chicken broth, two leeks, one yellow onion, and four cloves of garlic.  I added just a light sprinkling of paprika at the end.  No need to add any cream.  My husband said it was restaurant quality.  Plus, it was a cinch to make.  I'll double the recipe next time.

This was a very good soup, I didn't modify it at all. Creamy and light. Mine was not a nice "white" color but that may have been because I made my own vegetable broth. I think my homemade vegetable broth added a different dimension to the soup, but really, I think it'd be hard to miss with this one. Good flavor and easy to make while you're preparing an entree. If you find that the soup is too watery, just cook it down a bit until the water has evaporated. This also improves the flavor.

I really liked this soup. My modifications were to add a shallot, some white wine and a pinch of cayenne for a little spice. I think it would have been tasty even without the cream, but I couldn't resist.

This is a great low carb recipe.  I used others advice and used an onion instead of the 3 leeks and it turned out wonderful.  I also used 7 cups of vegetable broth instead of 8 (it was all that I had).  I will make it again.

Good base recipe. I tweeked it. Added one potato, a tablespoon curry, five slices of bacon, and 1/2 cup cream. Blended lightly. Excellent. Well, no. Can't have it all. It is no longer low carb.

This recipe has everything I want - easy to make and very tasty.  I am grateful to whoever recommended curry.  I just sprinkled it on my portion at the table, as my family members are not keen on curry.  It gave a more full-bodied flavor.  I liked it both with and without the cream.  One thing: I added canned mushrooms, which did not blend in to the soup.  I actually liked having pieces of mushrooms, but next time (and there will be many times) I will use fresh mushrooms, chopped into smaller pieces than canned.
Update: I made this recipe again, using half a cauliflower and adding curry powder, turmeric, and red pepper flakes while sauteing & garam masala at the end. This was even better!

Thanks for the great recipe.  Since I am trying to cut down on my fats and carbs, I didn’t add the cream.  It was great even without it.  Also, I added less (chicken) broth and only blended half of the soup.  It was still very tasty and rich.  Thanks again for sharing.

I ALWAYS modify recipes. I was looking for lo carb/sodium soup -- store bought is just way too high. I didn't notice that I using instructions for 12 servings-so I modified it--a lot of which was for the 6 servings directions. I added whole mushrooms, a stalk of celery and slices of onion roughly cut. For the broth I used only 1 heavily salted pkg of Goya chicken bouillon which is perfect for 4 cups of water which I prepared in the micro while the veggies were cooking.  I added the broth & cooked it for a 1/2 hr - which was too long ... I like a little crunch & next time (tomorrow?) I will cut this down to abt 15-20 mins.  I then added Cream of Mushroom soup with abt 3T of cornstarch.  Also mixed in few shakes of curry, pepper, mixed seasoning, along w abt 2 caps of cooking sherry. VERRRRY GOOD.

Made a crockpot version of this, which came out nicely. I added some chopped shallots and sauteed them with the garlic, then put it in the crockpot with the cut-up leeks and cauliflower. Also reduced the cream by half, and it was still plenty rich. A great wintry soup for February nights!

I used 2 medium heads of cauliflower,  2 large leeks,  4 cups of unsalted chicken broth, and 4 large cloves of garlic.  I forgot to sautee the leeks  and cauliflower and garlic, so just added olive oil and butter to the pot as it came to a boil.  I also threw in a handful of smoked bacon ends that I had rendered previously.  I only had 1/2 cup of cream to add, and per another comment I added a can of Cannellini beans to thicken.  Salt and peppered at the end, and it is delicious!!!

I should have read the other reviews before making. The big change I would make is way less broth! I would do 4-5 cups instead of the 8. My soup was extremely runny with the 8 cups. I also added some chopped bacon and cheese on the top after I made it.  Very good flavor overall. I will make this again.

I missed the olive oil while reading the recipe and I didn’t miss it. Didn’t use the cream either. This is wickedly easy to whip up and it is delicious. This is going into my regular rotation.

The first time I made this soup I was lazy and didn’t blend it. It was okay but obviously the texture was wonky. But I got an immersion blender and tried again. My husband semi-sort of remembered the first flopped attempt so he wasn’t psyched for a re-do. However the second attempt was a HUGE hit. Totally WOWed my hub AND discovered the joys of an immersion blender. Score!

I've made this twice now, it is so easy and delicious.  And it freezes well since there are no potatoes (which I find go mushy or grainy if frozen).   No changes to recommend.

I didn't use the cream and this soup was the best! My husband was skeptical of the leeks but he said this was the best soup I've made.

This is a five star with or without the heavy cream. I've made this recipe many times as written and then played with the ingredients as well. I recommend trying it as written. You won't be disappointed!

I got two HUGE leeks in my Farm Fresh to You CSA and had no idea how to use them! (a bit embarrassing) So I came digging at All Recipes for something tasty. And I found it!! Really enjoyed the simplicty of the recipe, for the beginner that I am. And it was so yummy.  I'm going to try to making "cashew cream" to replace the heavy cream that's optional in this one. I used the cream this time. It was lovely, but I'd like to reduce dairy even further from my diet. Thanks! I'll update on how the cashew cream turns out. :) Happy Eating!

On its own, this recipe was too bland for my taste. I added nutritional yeast (7 tbsp), smoked paprika (1/4 tsp), herbes de provence (1/4 tsp) and tumeric (1/4 tsp) in the soup itself and blended it in the Vitamix. The texture was great. I actually prefer the texture of this soup since it isn't as starchy as a potato and leek soup. When I served it, I added bacon bits, a spoonfull of sour cream and some chopped chives. (all vegan) The tweaked, final result was really good!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious!  I made a few changes but the base of the soup was the same.  I added an onion, cut the amount of vegetable broth by half, added a tsp each of garlic and onion powder.  I didn't  add the mentioned cream in the recipe.  It turned out nice and creamy.  I will make this soup again soon!

Roasted the cauliflower, added 1 large shallot, a can of Great Northern White Beans, and about a cup less broth.  Tasted it before I added the half and half.  The cream really knocked it out of the park!!  Oh, and I also added a large teaspoon each of rosemary and thyme.  Will make again and again!!!

Just happened to pick up leeks and cauliflower up at the farmers market this morn. It was their last day for the season. It was meant to be. I love these wonderful, simple, and easy recipes. Especially when they are music to your mouth!

I don't really measure when I cook, but I did follow recipe.

I followed other reviews suggestions and only did 6 cups of broth, but next time I will use 4. I  added a lot of garlic and other spices to make it more flavorful. Otherwise it's a little bland. But a good soup for a cold winter night.

This recipe is AMAZING…..like the others who posted reviews, I used less broth.  I actually used just enough to cover the vegetables.  I cannot believe the great consistency (I did not use cream or milk).  I think the thickness is due to less broth (I used approximately 5 1/2 cups)…..I am going to try this and add some winter veggies.  I did need to add a bit of salt (the store bought broth was low sodium and it really did need a bit more - kosher salt).  The emersion blender is winner with this recipe! 
Don't hesitate to try this……it is so good!

I also suggest using less stock - this makes the soup creamier. I used just enough to barely cover the vegetables in the pot. I also did not include the butter to make it healthier, and I didn't miss it. I could not believe how delicious this soup was. Love that it is healthy and utilizes winter veggies that are in season right now. Potato soup is a guilty pleasure - this is a no-guilt, just-as-tasty and super healthy substitute.

This is a staple in my house.  It's so easy, so delicious, and I haven't met anyone yet who doesn't love it.  I use less broth so it's a little thicker, more like 6 cups, and you only need light cream not heavy.  Wonderful.  If you want to shave some cheddar cheese on top before serving you can, but it doesn't need it!

My first time using leeks and well worth the time.  I used approximately 6 cups of chicken broth and thickened slightly with flour instead of adding cream at the end.  The ideas submitted by everyone to enhance the flavor and heartiness will definitely be experimented with the next time.  I, however added finely chopped grilled chicken for a protein.

This is a VERY delicious soup - especially for my husband who refuses to eat most vegetables. I varied the recipe slightly to make it healthier & because I didn't have vegetable stock. 

1) I used 6 cups of chicken stock and one can of cream of mushroom mixed with one can of water = 8 cups of stock. 

2) I also used Olivio Light for the butter. 

3) Instead of using heavy cream, I looked up substitutes and ended up using 1 cup of plain greek nonfat yogurt. You need to heat the yogurt up in a small pan on low heat until its hot and then whisk it into the soup to add creaminess. 

Each of these substitutions worked perfectly!!!

What a wonderful, tasty soup, very easy to make and also good for you! I added a few garlic gloves, which I roasted off first to just enhance the flavour , and dropped the cream as it didn't really need it. Other than that, a simply good and easy recipe for a quick dinner or lunch.

Excellent soup!  Great flavor without the carbs of potatoes.  I used a smaller head of cauliflower and reduced the broth to prox. 5 cups and used 1/2 cup of half and half instead of heavy cream.

I was blown away by how delicious this soup was. I did season it up a bit (added some onion powder, Rosemary , and red chilli flakes) as per other reviewers and roasted the cauliflower, but other than that I left it as is. It's a great soup to experiment with- will definitely make again!

LOVED this! Adding white wine and lemon is a must. I followed the advice of someone else and also pureed a can of cannellini beans to thicken it up. Absolutely delicious! And so so good for you!

I just tried this recipe today, I had some high hopes after reading all of the reviews on it. I was a little weary about it being bland and gritty but to my happy surprise I was blown away. THIS SOUP IS AMAZING!!! Simple, hearty, and scrumptious! All I had on hand was chicken bouillon instead of vegetable broth and it really gave it an awesome flavor. This soup has a very pleasant smooth consistency, and would be perfect for a healthy lunch or a side for dinner. I will definitely be making this a repeat in my home.

This is a fabulous recipe that is healthy and EASY! I personally like a thicker soup so I add two heads of cauliflower instead of the one. I found this mellowed the flavor out a bit so next time I will also be adding six leeks instead of three because I enjoyed the intensity of the flavor with one cauliflower. Son and husband add bacon and cheese and it tastes just like baked potatoe soup! Love this, thank you so much for sharing.

This was awesome! I changed it up a tiny bit: added WAY more garlic and one sliced potato (skin on) and a little bit of braggs aminos instead of salt or pepper. SO GOOD, the recipe is enough for a small army so I have enough to feed myself at work the rest of the week!

One word..Yummm!  Have to admit tweaking, but the base is great. I used chicken broth and reduced it to six cups, added a bit more garlic, one small hot chili pepper and one tsp curry paste. If you brown the veggies in the butter and oil before adding the broth, it will have a nice nutty, buttery taste. Once mixture was blended, I found it creamy enough without having to add the cream saving a few calories. Will definitely be making again, especially with winter around the corner!

So easy. So yummy.
I blended mine in the blender at the end, and peppered each bowl. This is tasty soup. Filling, slightly sweet and enjoyable with whole grain garlic toast.

Wow, never thought I would be this excited about cauliflower soup.  I substituted the leeks with an onion and sprinkled in a little liquid smoke with a can of white beans for thickness and protein and used 4 cups of chicken broth.  Yummo. I'm full on just two small bowls. EASY to make, great and guilt free!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is incredible.  Thanks to the other reviewers, I made a couple modifications.  I cut the recipe in half using 3 3/4 cups vegetable broth AND half a can of cannellini beans.  After I blended the soup, there was no need for the cream.  My 9-year old is devouring a bowl now...She LOVES it!  It's not easy to find healthy foods she loves, so I'll make this again...and again...

I REALLY like this. We didn't use butter, pepper or cream, and we used low sodium chicken broth instead of vegitable broth. We used less broth to make it thicker.

I reduced the broth to 4 cups (all I had on hand), increased the leeks (had 5), and used half-and-half instead.  My husband saw it cooking and asked me to serve it before blending it smooth.  Maybe I'll try roasting the cauliflower next time. Great soup... very elegant. Thanks!

Low carb awesomeness.  The best thing about this recipe is you don't have to have exact proportions.  I've made it three times now and I've just used whatever proportions of cauliflower, broth, and cream I felt like using.  Definitely add your own spices, a lot of them, as the recipe itself is really bland.  I used extra garlic, sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and lots of crushed red pepper.  

And to top it all off:  add some shredded cheddar and crumbled bacon.

Hello soup season!  I loved this.  I followed this recipe with the exception of using chicken broth instead of vegetable both and I didn't not feel the need to add the cream.  Wonderful texture, warmed the soul & healthy.  What a perfect soup on our first day of snow.

I thought this was excellent.  I made it exactly as written..except I overlooked that garlic was on the list.  It looked very bland and I was thinking rapidly about what I was going to have to do to give it flavor.  I added salt and pepper and wow, yummy stuff!  I'm not sure why some found theirs watery unless they used small leeks or a small cauliflower.  The consistency was just right.  I used only 1/3 cup heavy cream (it's all I had on hand) and it was just enough creaminess.  I'd almost be afraid to use more.  Looking forward to the flavors tmw as others have said it only gets better.  It even had a buttery flavor from the saute step.  I may sprinkle some of the suggestions made by others in a couple servings to try that sound like they might add even more character:  curry, wine, bacon.  I'll be making this a lot.  Thank you for a wonderful easy and tasty low carb recipe.

AMAZING! I also used 6 cans of chicken broth and it had a perfect thick and creamy consistency. I omitted the butter entirely and no taste was sacrificed. I will make this again and again.

I have never cooked with leeks before, but was looking for a low carb soup.  This was awesome!
Because I am not vegetarian, I added leftover ham ( about 1 1/2 cups cubed) and can not believe how well it went together!   Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a terrific recipe, I did however add paprika and cayenne pepper and I used fat free half n half. I also added 1/2 can of navy beans to it to add protein, since I often just eat soup for a meal with bread. A good rule of thumb for the liquid measurement, since every head of cauliflower is different, is to use just enough to cover the vegetables. It won't be too waterey then.

Very yummy soup!  I made this to use up some cauliflower in my fridge and some leeks for that matter!  Made a smaller batch just for me as this is not hubby's soup of choice!  Anyway, I opted to roast my cauliflower and garlic and added a bunch of seasonings due to other comments about this lacking spices.  Still cooked my leeks separately using some spray oil and a little oil.  I only added a small amount of 5% half and half after pureeing my soup in the blender.  I must say, this tasted better second day than it did when I did the spoon test immediately after making (as I said, just made for me...so put in the fridge after finishing for lunches)!  Looking forward to a few bowls leftover!

Excellent!  Smooth, creamy and delicious!  I had my 15 year old God-daughter over, and she was a little reluctant to try this soup that had strange vegetables.  Once she did, she loved it and so did I!  It was amazing!  I will be making this one again!  It was the perfect soup on a chilly autumn evening.  Superb!

update: this is extremely easy with an immersion blender.  after making this soup many times, i did try to roast the cauliflower and garlic beforehand.  honestly it did nothing to enhance the flavor - the recipe is perfect as is!  subbed half and half for the heavy cream, otherwise followed exactly....yummy!  somehow i think bacon can only improve on the dish

A beautiful recipe...     As advised in the reviews I only used 6 cups of broth, this was the perfect amount.  I used extra leeks as I wanted to use them up.  And I didn't add salt as it was lovely without (and I usually add salt to EVERYTHING!)  I also added the cup of cream.  My boyfriend loved this soup so much he asked me for a straw so that he could eat it faster.  Easy to make and much faster than pumpkin soup as no peeling involved. Excellant! Thanks!!

I am going to give this 4 stars because I couldn't imagine it being very good as written. 8 C. of broth just didnt seem right - I used HALF - 4 C. and just a tad of cream (1/4C?) and this was thick and filling. Overall, a good low carb option and I will make again.

I roasted the cauliflower first. While it was roasting, I sauteed the leeks in the butter. I also threw in about 5 whole roasted garlic cloves that were left over rather than chopeed fresh. Finally, I used half chicken/half vegetable brother and tossed in some skim milk rather than cream at the end. A wonderful soup I'm definitely making again!

I made this several months ago, but I remember it was okay. I didn't use cream though. It might be good with it. Sorry if this doesn't help much.

This recipe was wonderful!  I did follow the advice of others and used 6 cups of broth.  ( I used chicken broth, only because I had just boiled chicken and had the broth on hand.}  Otherwise, I pretty much followed the directions.  What a nice "comfort food" on a cool evening.  Thanks for the recipe!

SO easy and delicious!  Had a few changes due to what I had on hand.  Only used half head of cauliflower and didnt have broth so I poured about 5 cups of water with 5 small chicken bouillon cubes.  I did not add cream at the end and it did not need it at all.

Wonderful soup! My first time cooking with leeks! I don't usually make homemade soup and I found this to be very easy and delicious.  The only change I made was to use fat free half n half instead of the heavy cream but I tasted it before adding the half n half and it would have tasted just fine without it.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Not bad!  To save cooking time, I cut up my cauliflower & leeks & pulsed them in the blender a few times before cooking.  Some of the veggies came out of the blender very finely chopped, while others were larger & more chunky.  I added extra garlic, & will definitely make this again!

It's so easy and very tasty!!

This soup is outstanding!  I would recommend the broth sit a little above the vegetable mix - 6 cups should be enough.  I was generous with the leek and garlic, and also substituted some of the (vegetarian) broth for water to reduce the sodium.  Fantastic!

It came together very easily.  But, it was a big disappointment for me.  I took the advise from others and used 6 cups of vegetable stock I had made.  It was still way too thin.  Maybe I did something wrong, I don't know.

Turned out pretty well and was a good recipe to use up a bunch of cauliflower I had. I use extra garlic and put in whole milk (instead of cream). I thickened it a bit with cornstarch. I also added two tiny potatoes that I had leftover.

This was quite good!  I used olive oil instead of butter to saute the veggies.  I didn't bother with the heavy cream, as once it was pureed it was quite thick and creamy by itself!

Loved the recipe, especially using chicken stock.  When using the chick stock I also added 1/2 tspn of dried Tarragon.  Gave the soup a wonderful aroma.  Once tried with some finely shredded Parmesan - that worked well too.

This is a great soup. Everyone loved it. Just a couple of things I did differently from the recipe:  used chicken bouillion, left the vegetables chopped - did not blend them.
Oh, and I didn't add the cream to the whole pot, just to my bowl.
This ended up cooking about 20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for but the vegetables didn't turn out mushy.
It's a favorite that will be made repeatedly.
Thanks for sharing.

An acceptable low carb compromise, but the texture is not as satisfying as a similiar soup made with potatoes. Flavor is good.

This recipe was as delicious as it was simple.  I did not add the heavy cream.  I used my emulsion blender, making it creamy enough for me.  I did add turmeric and when I shared with a friend garnished with bacon.

Definitely roast cauliflower & garlic first.

I added some broccoli cause I had it also cannelloni beans.  Still found it to be bland so also put in cheese lots of salt and pepper.
I will serve it with pretzel bread.  I’m hoping it will taste better once the flavor s come together

I love this recipe but did add a couple of stalks of chopped celery to it.  I also used chicken broth because I had it on hand & added some celery salt at the end.  My husband is watching his carb intake & loved this as a substitute for my potato-leek soup.

Delicious! Since it’s just the two of us, I halved the recipe. I also followed another commenter’s suggestion to roast the cauliflower and garlic. I used the green part of the leek since it was to be cooked for awhile. Used half and half instead of cream. My husband and I loved it. Looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

The first time I made it, it was good. The second time I made it... I roasted the cauliflower under the broiler for 5-10 minutes before adding it to the pot while the leeks and garlic softened (reserved a few small pieces of cauliflower for garnish at the end), and added a pinch of red pepper and curry right before I added the broth... and WOW this soup is amazing!!

This soup was good but pretty bland I put in a little bit of siran cha sauce, a good shake of black pepper and some salt (I have. to watch the salt intake). So some spice or other flavouring should be added. Over all, I enjoyed it.

We did a Chopped cooking competition for a work offsite event and I won with this recipe!  It was so delicious.  Add a little bacon to really boost the flavor.

After reading many reviews, I did not make the soup according to its original recipe so I don’t know what it really tastes like on its own. However, after using some of the suggestions made in other reviews, it was fantastic and I will definitely Make it again. I was fairly generous with the garlic and pepper and also seasoned the cauliflower and leeks  during the sauté  process. Further, I added a container of baby Bella mushrooms and a couple of teaspoons of better than bouillon garlic paste and only used 6 1/2 cups of the vegetable stock. I do not have an immersion blender so used my hand mixer to blend and then added the cream. This is a great base recipe that has many opportunities to enhance to your liking.

This was delicious. I used 6 cups of broth as suggested in previous reviews. I only added cream to half of the recipe to see which I liked better and it tasted great both ways. I also only used half the cream. Will definitely be making this again.

Soup was a little bland so I added 1 can of chickpeas and one can of red kidney beans and a little more spices. I didn't need to add any cream, because after mushing it in the blender it was beautifully creamy. When ready to serve I added a little bit of horseradish. Yummmm

I really enjoyed making this. I used 6 cups of broth and could have maybe lessened it a bit, but it was still great. I happen to find mushroom broth in the store and used have that and half chicken broth unsalted. I also had a summer squash I needed to use and added that to the sauté step. I did roast the cauliflower a bit.

Added some Miso paste, a little thyme, a few red pepper flakes  and a splash of rice wine vinegar. It gave the soup a lot of depth and richness and a little umami flavour.

Very tasty soup.  I pretty much stayed with the recipe, except I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth, because that’s what I had on hand. I added a couple of pinches of curry powderm

LOVED this recipe and so did the in-laws!  I did add the usual soup starter of celery, carrots and onions and a dash of this and a dash of that for seasonings.  Excellent soup, thank you for sharing!

Just made this with a few changes and it is delicious!
1. instead of butter I used ghee
2.  I roasted a head of garlic and added it when I blended the soup rather than sauté fresh garlic. 
3. used six cups of stock (chicken)
4. I  didn’t add the cream because it isn’t necessary. 

Tastes creamy like potato based soup ??

I did add about 2 cups of shredded (to taste) sharp cheddar cheese. Also inadvertently bought chicken broth so used that instead of vegetable broth. Used the dark green tops of the leaks, washed and not cut, to give added flavor. Removed these before pureeing the soup. Love this soup!

I didn't emulsify. It tasted hearty and stew-y. I roasted the cauliflower and added more chopped garlic (5) to the leeks and cauliflower sauté, and  a can of rinsed and drained Great Northern Beans (instead of cream as suggested by another reviewer). Unbelievably tasty!

Delicious, however I roasted the cauliflower and added some onions that I also roasted. Followed suggestions in posts for 6 cups of vegetables broth instead of 8. Did not use heavy cream was not necessary. Tried both with and without topping with sour cream and was great both ways. A definite keeper.

This is now my 2nd time making it. First time used box chicken stock. Turned out absolutely amazing. I don’t believe I used heavy cream. It was sooo delicious! Received such great feedback that this time  I am making it with chicken bone broth to be a bit healthier ( which I read they are interchangeable with stock ) but to be honest I am a bit nervous as it doesn’t smell as good while cooking. Will come back later with results.

I could tell going in that there wasn't going to be a lot of flavour to this soup.  I contemplated roasting the cauliflower but decided to just make as written.  I should have listened to my instincts, the soup is very boring and bland.  I added a bit of cheese, sriracha, and lots of garlic and it was ok. Probably will not make again.

I used chicken stock , (2 leeks because that’s all I had) added 2 bay leaves, 3 crushed green cardamom pods, and a scant 1/2 cup of half and half instead of heavy cream to reduce calories, and it was delicious. Will make again.

I started the soup before reading all the comments and I’m glad i did. I used the full amount of chicken broth and added the cream. However i didn’t put it through an emersion blender (we love our soup a little chunky) but Instead mashed the big chunks with a potato masher. We loved the soup!

My husband said this soup is “incredible”.  I can’t remember if he ever said that before.  I used 8 chicken bullion and 6 cups water because the water covered the cauliflower and leek.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  And so inexpensive too!  Wow!

A friend made this soup and brought some in to share.  I liked it so much I had to make it myself.  I did use chicken bone broth instead of vegetable broth and added some cheese.  I also couldn't find leaks so I used onions.  Hard to go wrong with this recipe.  Very good.

Tasty and flavorful.  I used 2 leeks and 6 cups of water instead.  I made this for a dairy sensitive person, so I eliminated the cream and it was very good.

I didn't blend this because I love to have a chunky soup. I thought it was an easy recipe and loved that it was low carb.

many talked about roasting the vegetables, well I accidentally browned them in the pan which ended up like a "roasting flavor".  When reheated, I needed to add a little more stock to loosen it. Did not miss the potatoes at all. DElish!!

So. This was good-ish.

At my house: let's eat more healthy.

Also at my house: let's eat less meat and less carbs.

After making this soup, at my house: can you add some Italian Sausage?

Good soup. It is what you think it will be: cauliflower soup with leek.

I've never made even potato leek soup, but this soup is delicious! For ease, I used frozen "riced cauliflower" which made prep a lot faster! I lowered the amount of broth to 6 cups as other suggested. I sautéed half an onion with the leeks. I also added a cup of quinoa for a thicker consistency. And I used whole milk instead of cream. It's been a hit!

This soup is delicious. Better than potato leek in my opinion.
The only difference I used half and half that was all I had and it's great!

Loved, loved loved this soup. It was tasty and filling. Only alterations I made were to use 6 cups of stock instead of 8 and 1/2 cup of cream. It was the perfect amount of liquid.

Great hearty soup. Based on other reviews I roasted the cauliflower as it adds more depth and colour. I also added a can of Navy beans, which adds tons of fibre and protein. Lastly, I used old bay spice to bring out all the flavours. Really good!

I made this as directed and was so disappointed. I thought that it was bland and really needed some other seasonings in it. I also had to add a lot of salt to it because there was no taste. I was really looking forward to this but was disappointed.

An excellent, easy-to-make tasty soup. While the cream may be optional, it helps round it out.

I cooked, browned the leeks and cauliflower first. Deglazed with some wine. I did not use the cream. I did not put in the blender, just mashed the cauliflower with a fork. Added some cumin and all done! Yum

I just made this for the second time today! First time I didn't have any heavy cream and I blended it too long so it came out without any chunks. But the flavor was delicious and I knew the next time which is today I'd come more prepared. I added another whole cauliflower to thicken it up! You can't use too much of anything so I just throw as much flavor as I can when it comes to the leeks and garlic. It's good with fresh grate parm on top.

I love potato and leek soup but have been low carbing it lately so this is a great alternative!  It's also nice because you can customize it to your own tastes and thickness of the soup.  It is a great tasting and comforting soup.

I did not use any cream, etc. and cut back on the amount of broth (and I used chicken broth, it's more flavorful).  I also added an onion.  Was very good and didn't seem to have lacking in flavor for me!

So yummy!!  Just used a little less broth (6 cups vs. 8), and did use the cream.  I also used Better Than Bullion (chicken) for the "broth".  Turned out really amazing!

This is a hit with the family. I've made it several times. I find it goes great as a side dish for Christmas Prime Rib. I add a little more salt and put 1/2 cup of heavy cream in it.

Made this for the first time yesterday.  What a great base soup recipe that you could tweak in so many ways.  Very rich tasting - I did not use any cream at all.  I did make some substitutions and additions - did not have vegetable broth, so used half chicken broth and half mushroom broth.  After tasting, I felt it needed some perking up and added some cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika and nutmeg.  You could really play with the seasoning in this recipe.  A great way to eat your veggies!

Added some cheese on top and stirred in a bit of Tabasco...so good...I did not even miss the potatoes!
Btw, I did NOT run it thru a blender...too messy...just mashed it a bit.

I made the soup with just one leek, a full head of cauliflower and added a half head of cabbage.  Did not use  spices or milk, but came out good.  I use this as a health food and it helps to maintain or loss weight too.

I'm only rating this a 3* only because I think it either needs more cauliflower or less broth as it's really thin.  I think if it was a little thicker it would be a 4*. Next time I think I'm going to add carrots and use more cauliflower.

I had some leeks I needed to use and some cauliflower, to this was perfect!  I added a bulb of fennel that I had also.  Cleaned out the veggie drawer.  The soup was fantastic, and I did not even add any cream.  It was delicious and had such a smooth creamy texture without adding it!

This soup is delicious! I'm on a low carb diet and this is just what the doctor ordered. I took the advice of some other reviewers and roasted the cauliflower with garlic and olive oil. I added extra garlic because I love garlic and reduced the vegetable broth to 7 cups. I also added the cream. Yum! Thank you :)

Wow. This was soooo good! I made this for my stepdad who had surgery & needed light nutrition. I added keilbasa for protein, but it's good on its own. Also, my husband was freaked out that there was so much cauliflower (meat & potatoes guy!), and he inhaled it. A+++++ in my book!

Overall the soup was great. I thought the soup was a little thin so I did add a little corn starch before blending. I also added 1/2 cup of carrots for the sweetness.  I'm a dill nut so I also added 2 tsp. of dill weed and a  tsp of crushed basil. To cut back on the fat I used 1/2 and 1/2 cream.

I loved this creamy soup.   Because I avoid dairy I substituted almond coconut milk for the heavy cream.

This was absolutely fabulous, and I can say that as a person who makes a lot of soup!   I was looking for a thick recipe that didn't require cream or starch and this is it.  Organic leeks were on sale so I ended up with 6.  I roasted the cauliflower as others suggested, using coconut oil, oregano and red pepper flakes.  Used 2 boxes of chicken stock (8 cups) because I'm too lazy to pack leftover stock.  Added more red pepper flakes to the combined pot (I like it spicy).  I cannot get over how simple and how good this is!

What a great base!  I didn't have any leeks, so i used onions like another reviewer had mentioned.  After it was done, I added steamed veggies and rice.  It was delicious!  Tastes like a creamy soup and I didn't even have to use the cream!  Great healthy alternative!  Perfect for a cold day :)

OMG, this is delicious! Popatoes spike my blood sugar,  but i love popato leak soup. This is a simple and very delicious substitute.  I will be making this alot!  I used organic chicken broth instead (that's what I had in the cupboard ) and added just a pinch of salt & pepper. The store had no fresh cauliflower, so I used 2 bags of frozen.

I read the reviews afterward,  and will try some of them.

This soup was absolutely delicious! I'm transitioning to a vegan diet, so I sauteed the vegetables in coconut oil and added coconut cream to the soup at the end instead of heavy cream. I used all the recommended ingredients and the recommended servings. The only thing I did differently was slow cook the soup on high for 4 hours instead of using a stock pot. I served this at my Christmas dinner and it was a huge success! I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

I used rutabaga in addition to leeks and cauliflower, and for the veggie stock, I boiled onions, rutabaga, parsley, mustard seed, turmeric, rosemary, sage, and thyme. I also added kale which turned it a baby food green color! But it was SO TASTY!!!

Really good.  Here are my edits....  No butter, just 3/4 of (veg) broth,  add 1 can of white beans just before blending, add soy milk as needed after blending.

I used bone broth for the base liquid.  I used canned coconut milk instead of cream. And blended in the Vitamix to make it extra creamy. Delicious!

Decided to do a couple of vegetarian meals throughout the week, I'm so happy I went with this recipe. I followed it exactly, with the cream. Took me a while to make, but I'm always a distracted cook. I do not really care though,  because this soup is so good.

I love the flavour and texture. I didn't have cream so used bits and pieces of cheeses I had left over in the fridge. Delicious!  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. Looking forward to many delicious meals with artisan bread, salad and a gorgeous soup.

This was good. I was cooking for a vegan friend so I added tofu to thicken it and corn for more flavor. I guess that makes it higher in carbs, but it was delish. Next time I'll probably add kale as well.

We had this for dinner and although no one really liked it, everyone consumed their portion.  I used 7 cups of vegetable broth and thought that was too much, 6 would have been better.  That said, the vegetable broth is the main flavor, so make sure you really like the vegetable broth you use.  For our tastes, chicken broth would have been much better.  I used 3 leeks and could barely taste them as the vegetable broth and cauliflower really overwhelmed the leeks and garlic.   Although this was interesting to try, I doubt we will have this again.

A new family favorite! Subbed chicken broth for vegetable and added 1 whole chopped onion and 1/2 lb (10 strips) of bacon. Will definitely make again - and I don't really care for soup!!

Very good.  I added three stalks of sauteed celery and used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Tasted good even before the cream and I haven't added any seasonings yet.  I'm not a huge cauliflower fan but I had some leeks I needed to do something with from my Farm CSA, and this was great!  Since it's blended, I might even be able to get my three year old to try it!

This recipe is yummy! I did modify according to some other posts - i added a little curry paste (i've done it both ways and it's delish either way) and I substituted the cream with greek yogurt. It freezes great too! AND tonight instead of giving them the same soup AGAIN I served it over white rice with some ground turkey (salt,pepper,chile powder, curry paste, cumin and ground ginger)and it was amazing!

I love this soup.  I wasn't able to find leeks so I used half an onion.   I ended up adding a few carrots just because I had them in the house and   instead of heavy cream, I used 1/2 and 1/2 and it turned out very rich and creamy. I'll be making this again.  It was so good that I will double the recipe next time.

Easy, excellent. I followed the directions exactly, did not add the optional cream, and it tasted delicious. Creamy, velvety texture, lovely flavor. And milk-free!

I would recommend drizzling some pumpkin seed oil on top, or sprinkling with freshly ground cracked pepper, but those are just suggestions as the soup tastes lovely the way it is.

I made it just as directed, but thought it tasted a little bland so I added a little onion powder and cayenne pepper.  I do not have an immersion blender so I left it chunky and I enjoyed the pieces of cauliflower in it.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I used half and half and it turned out delicious.

Followed directions with a few adjustments. I used two smaller heads of cauliflower that I roasted with olive oil and a few cloves of garlic. One head was blended up and the other added to the soup in smaller florets. I took the suggestions of a few other posters and added a touch of curry, paprika and garlic powder. Whoa .... So yummy!! I wish I had a dollop of sour cream for each bowl! A definite winner!!!

I agree that 8 cups of broth is too much - I prefer a thicker soup.  I also cut back on the fat by only using the olive oil, and instead of cream I blended in a package of silken tofu for texture and protein.  I also roasted the veggies for 30 minutes to add some depth of flavor.

Delicious!  I'm on a 3-day green smoothie "cleanse" - ? not really sure it's a cleanse though, and am so sick of green smoothies.  
I made this recipe to get something more savory, with the following adjustments to keep it super low-carb / low-fat:
- no oil, no butter.  Just steamed the cauliflower and leeks in a bamboo steamer until ready
- no cream
- 3 c. veg broth
- forgot the garlic!  doh!
- added salt, pepper, cayenne
- after blending, added finely chopped parsley on top
Thanks!  Yummy!

A delicious low carb soup.  We have to put the cream (sometimes we use half and half) or we don't care for the flavor, but mixing it in makes for an amazing creamy soup.

I made this soup for dinner and followed the directions EXACTLY.  I did not substitute anything.  As is, this soup was AWESOME.  My husband loved it.  My 5 and 7 year old gobbled it up.  I'm definitely making this again.  Now I have leftovers for work tomorrow.  :)

My 8 year old who only eats carrots likes this soup! I was generous with the salt, and used 1.5 cups of 18% coffee cream in place of the heavy cream.

This recipe was outstanding! I followed the review of Matthew F from 2009 and added Garam Masala, the Indian spice, crushed red pepper too. I also broiled my cauliflower with a chopped shallot, and added a sweet onion to the leek mixture. With the salt, pepper, crushed pepper and garam masala, it was very flavorful and I possibly didn't need the cream, but....I ended up adding 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of Light cream and it definitely enhanced the end result. I even threw a few homemade croutons on top for garnish and still kept it low-carb. Fabulous recipe!

Great recipe, tasted as great as a cauliflower leek soup I just had at a local restaurant. I halved the vegetable broth and added turmeric, salt and pepper while sauteing the vegetables.  Also added a large shallot and a small onion.  Topped with fresh kale.

Will make this again and again!  My husband loved it and my Dad said he could eat it everyday!!  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I did add a bit more salt, added some cayenne and garlic powder and swapped out the heavy cream for half & half.  It was delish!

I’ve been on a soup kick lately.  Must be that time of year.  I deviated somewhat on this recipe by cutting the olive oil back to 1 T. and the butter back 2 T.  As others, I reduced the amount of broth to 5-3/4 cups (one 32 oz. box and one 14-1/2 oz. can) and used chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I also used white pepper instead of black.  This was just ok for us.  I thought it really needed some pizzaz.  We ended up adding Velveeta to the two servings we ate and the rest went to the freezer.  Maybe the leftovers will be better.  UPDATE 1/15/14:  Since writing this review we have had this two more times.  It definitely improves if you allow the flavors to meld.  Last night we added some sharp cheddar that I shredded myself and it was the best yet!  Now this is a five star recipe, not the three stars I originally gave it.

This was really good! I only had one leek so I added a yellow onion and some green onions. I also only used 6 cups of vegetable broth and more garlic than the recipe called for because I love garlic. Didn't need to add the cream it was the perfect consistency. Will definitely make again.

I roasted the cauliflower until lightly browned, used probably 3x the garlic (about half of which was roasted garlic), added some onion flakes, a little ground red pepper (be careful, it doesn't take much to make it really spicy) and 6 cups of chicken broth. Then I added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to cold skim milk (about a cup?) before adding to the soup. Let it return to a boil and then removed from heat and blended.  Tried it tonight and it's awesome.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors meld even more.  With the reduced broth and addition of corn starch it is quite thick and smooth.

This was very, very good!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using low sodium chicken broth as that is what I had on hand.  I also used the immersion blender and cream at the end.  Next time I will reduce the broth as the soup was pretty thin.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was amazing!!  I added a little onion powder and some dill for flavor.  I have yet to find a better low carb recipe.

I made this recipe today and now I wish I had doubled it. The taste was wonderful! My 4 year old and 11 year old tried some and loved it too (I didn't tell them it was cauliflower). Next time I make it I will set aside some chunks to add to the puree. Great recipe!

I make this often and love it. After making it so many times, I started to make my own little tweaks to suit my tastes. I usually roast the cauliflower to add a little more flavor and I use chicken broth instead of beef broth. I put in a blob of sour cream before eating.

I made this soup today and found it to be quite delicious! I had only two leeks but when combined with the cauliflower and sautéed, the scent was really good.  When I finished the cooking and used my immersion blender and added the cream, it was just fabulous -- much better than I would have expected.  I didn't add any salt or pepper because I thought it was perfect just like it was.  I will definitely be making this one again and again!  Thank you, DRUMNWRITE, for sharing this delicious recipe.

WOW what a tasty treat.  I roasted the cauliflower and garlic with olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and what a yummy nutty flavor that it added!!!  Will be making this on a regular basis.

I like the idea of the soup being low in carbs.  However, I found it lacking flavor even though I used only four cups of broth.  I diced up some jalapenos and added some cardamom and garam masala.  I would have added a medium onion as well if I had one on hand.  I did like a suggestion to use yogurt rather than heavy cream because this is a good way to add creaminess without adding a ton of calories.

Easy & delish!!!!!  Reduced stock to 6 cups and added well drained and rinsed cannelini beans.  The beans thickened the soup enough that I could easily have used 7 or 8 cups stock.  I also substituted non-fat greek (oikos) yogurt.  YUMMMY ;D  Thanks for sharing

Very good!  Creamy, flavorful, and comforting.  The cream really makes it taste more like potato but it was good without (if you don't have any on hand).  I will be adding this to my recipe rotation.  Thanks!

We are making this soup once a week now. My picky husband says it tastes like baked potato soup...and he's lost 15 pounds this month eating this for lunch most days.  I did substitue half and half for the cream and added 1/4 cup of shredded carrots and some cayenne pepper for zip.  Love it!

I was eager to try this after so many people gave it such high scores.  I followed to recipe to the "t."  It didn't look at all like the picture (which isn't necessarily that big of a deal).  It had an average, subtle taste, but it wasn't absolutely delicious.  WORST OF ALL it was a full week until the cauliflower (quite similar to broccoli) smell diminished.  I had all the windows in my house open for an afternoon, had the fans running, sprayed Febreeze, lit candles, and used 6 plug-in air fresheners and it still took a week to subside. I liked it somewhat, it didn't taste bad; but the after-smell totally made it not worth it.

Maybe I added a few more carbs, but like soup thick as it is more satisfying for my family.  Only used 6 C. broth, 2 cans of rinsed navy beans and two handfuls of Gluten Free Croutons to simmer.  Added a few more layers of flavor and was nice and thick!  Salt, white pepper and next time will try some fresh chopped Tarragon or parsley when serving.  My son eats cheese so he melted a little grated cheddar cheese over the top.  Yum.

This soup is delicious, hearty and filling!! 
My sister (who does not like veggies by the way) fought me over the last bowl of this soup! 
I made a few changes; roasted the cauliflower like someone else suggested, used green onions instead of leeks, only cos I have never cooked with leeks. And I added some sauteed chunks of chicken at the end to make it heartier! Overall; loved this soup!!

I just made this soup for the first time and my husband and I both loved it!  What a treat for us after having been on the low carb diet for a month.  It is a little thin but that's the trade off for being low carb.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I didn't have vegetable stock, so I used chicken, and only 4 cups which just covered the vegetables.  Added whipping cream at the end....Delish!  My husband loved it and he hates cauliflower!  He didn't know that was one of the ingredients.

No changes made to the existing recipe. With a minimum of ingredients and effort, you get a high end tasting soup. I excluded the cream but didn't miss it at all. Pureed in the Vitamix, it comes out silky smooth. It's pale green colour is very attractive as well. Absolutely delicious!

add an onion (1/2 vidalia?) and celery salt and natures season. Only 3 cans veg broth. Ham would be good...or more solid veggies (peas, carrots, cooked cauliflower, etc - not blended in)

Great recipe. I must admit that while reading this recipe I had some doubts, but the finished product put them to rest. I took the advice of earlier reviewers and cut back the (chicken) broth to about 6 cups and thickened slightly with flour. I also reserved some of the cooked vegetables before using hand mixer and added them again after mixing. The whole family liked this, even my 12 year old,  who doesn't like cauliflower (we told him it was potato soup). This one's a keeper!

We loved this soup, even my husband.  I didn't have the veg broth so I used beef broth and I also used shallots.  Yum.  Will do this again but will try to use veg broth.

excellent! added paprika and chopped onion as someone suggested and only used 6 cups broth (8 cups would have been way too liquidy). great for those of us watching our carbs

I didn't have any watery issues with the amount recommended.  I used chicken stock instead of vegetable.  This was really good, but a bit bland so I just threw on some cumin and was good to go!

Tasty! Not our absolute favorite soup, but good lo-cal dinner. Served with chicken sausage and sourdough. Roasted the cauliflower and a clove of garlic at 400 for 40, 50 respectively. Since the cauliflower was mostly cooked, I didn't boil it in the broth for long. We can definitely taste the roasted garlic!! Used only 6 c of broth and a dash of thyme at the end.

Very good, and easy too! I did not saute my veggies, instead i made a rue with the butter and 3 tablespoons flour then poured in my chicken stock and just let the veggies cook a little longer. I also did as a few suggested to only add 6 cups stock rather than eight. I also added a dash of curry. I will be making this again!

I was rather unimpressed, although perhaps the positive reviews inflated my expectations.  I used only 1/2 a cup of cream; that almost made it less appetizing, surprisingly.  I think this recipe lacks spices and personality.

I think this soup is great. Super easy to make and a really good texture and flavour. A couple variations that I did were adding only 4 cups of veggie broth with a can of chichen broth and a can of onion soup. I also added four cloves of garlic rather than just three.  I would definately recommend this soup to anyone.

Pretty delicious! My only reservation is the salt - it was definitely over the top for me. Next time, in addition to cutting down the broth from 8 to 5 cups, I'll be sub-ing in some water for part of it. Also, I left out the cream - there's no need for it. Honest!

Wonderful flavor that is rich and smooth. I added a couple tablespoons of dry milk solids instead of cream. And shredded spinach. Next time I may add mushrooms. But the base soup recipe is excellent if you need something light and nutritious.

This was very good.  The only change I made was using home made chicken stock because I had some in the freezer.  I also didn't think there was a need to add salt (especially not if using canned stock)  I would eat this even if it were not healthy and will make it again.

I thought this recipe was OK, but just OK. I reduced the stock as other suggested, and omitted the cream because the texture was wonderful so it didn't need the cream to feel velvety. It tasted a little blah, so I added a dash of sage and some thyme.  With and without the additions, it was still just OK.  I won't make it again.

I have never had potato leek soup so I had nothing to compare this to, but I LOVED this soup.  I followed some of the suggestions and used one can of navy beans and about 1/2 cup whole milk instead of heavy cream.  And I cut the broth in half.  It was very creamy and filling!  My 1 year old even liked it.

this is a creamy yummy way to get our veggies and avoid the starch. i used beef base instead of vegatable broth. it's all I had. turned out great. I didn't puree it too much so it had some texture.

This is an ok, easy recipe.  I used chicken broth and fat free half and half.  No doubt it would have been better with cream but the old arteries can't take it.  Even though I mixed the soup with a hand mixer for a very long time and overcooked the vegetables the soup had a lot of texture and never truly became creamy.  Maybe my mixing skills are lacking.  To make the soup more enjoyable I added a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of feta cheese.

I really liked this! I am watching my diet so I used nonfat milk and thickened it with a little flour. I also used sodium free low fat chicken broth in place of vegetable broth. I think you could play with this recipe and really have fun! I like the texture and I will definately make it again!

Flavor was very good, soup was thin so next time I may add some flour to thicken it up and leave some chunks in it.  I also used chicken broth instead since I'm not a huge fan of veggie broth.  All in all a good, healthy recipe.

This was delicious and I'll definately make it again. My only problem with it is it is a little soupy (not very thick) and I like soups with more substance. But since it is low carb it doesn't have starch from potatoes or flour to thicken it so it makes sense that it would be a little thin.
