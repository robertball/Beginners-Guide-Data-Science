I was a little unsure about these, but they were delicious! The flavor is kind of like French toast, plus cheese. The leftovers made for a great breakfast, too! :)

I can never make enough of these delicious treats at parties! I always share the recipe and how easy they are to make. I would warn against using maple flavored bacon, unless you want them took taste like breakfast wraps. I prefer to use them as a savory appetizer, so I use regular smoked bacon.

This is one of our favorite allrecipes treats.  Everyone in the family loves it.  My son even told his friends about how good it was and they want me to send them a sample.

The flavor was excellent, but I really didn't care for the texture of sweetened condensed milk and flattened bread.  It was very chewy, kinda like a carmel.  The boys liked it okay, but plenty went uneaten.

My mom actually made this one time about 20yrs ago! She got the recipe from an old co-worker, but had lost the recipe. We have been looking for the recipe for more than a decade and THIS IS IT!!  Its sooo good!

This is one of my favorite appetizers! It's super simple and incredibly delicious. I would agree about using smoked bacon rather than maple. I also usually add a splash or two of worcestershire sauce.
