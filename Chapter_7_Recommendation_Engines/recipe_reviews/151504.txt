The topping on this pie was pretty tasty, but there was too much flour in the filling.  It turned out a bit pasty.  I would try it again with out so much of the flour!

Sooo good!  I would cut down on the "crunch" part though.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this apple pie! Although I use my mom's flaky crust recipe, I follow the rest of this recipe exactly except using about 3/4 cup of flour in the filling. I've made it for my family, a friend who had surgery, and a work event--everyone loved it.It IS more work than dumping canned filling into a Pillsbury pie crust--but well worth it! YUM.
