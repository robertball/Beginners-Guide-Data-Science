Nice texture and wonderful flavor.  I used Ritz crackers since they were on hand.  I also would consider the Parmesean as a "required" item.  There is something about it when combined with the other ingredients that makes this special.

Delicious, fast, and easy! I've never made fish before, but wanted to try it. I used Tilapia filets, and Italian breadcrumbs instead of cracker crumbs and seasonings. My husband and kids ate every bite! I'll be making this again!

I'm sorry, but this was a great disappointment.  I followed the recipe closely, except used bread crumbs instead of crackers. I was a bit wary of the "Italian" nature of the seasonings, used on a delicate fish like walleye.  The seasonings were not actually too strong, but they were just wrong with the natural flavor of walleye.  Just made the fish taste un-wonderful, and walleye is expensive.  I would have done better just to pan-fry with a light flour coating with salt, pepper and lemon, which would have complemented the fish.  Sorry, a complete fail for me.

I love this recipe but I add a bit more to it. Start with about a 1/4 cup crushed buttery garlic croutons, 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans, 1/2 teaspoon dried parsley and coarsely ground black pepper to taste. Also, instead of using parmesan cheese I use a three cheese blend of parmesan, asiago and romano cheeses. I also like to add about and extra 2 Tablespoons of cheese blend to the mixture. Bake for thirty minutes and this fish dish is to die for!

This dish was amazing!  Very simple to prepare. I switched the fish for tilapia and it came out fabulously.  My wife quite enjoyed it when I made it for her.  The seasoning can be done many different ways depending upon what you would like to add.  I threw in some cayenne pepper to give it some heat.  Overall, delicious!  Thanks!

My teenagers loved this! I used 1/2 tbsp of Italian seasonings since I did not have any oregano on hand. Loved the way the crumbled crackers blended with the Parmesan and herbs. Spritzed a little lemon juice over top as I served the fish with lightly saut√©ed red pepper, garlic, asparagus, and sugar snap peas. This recipe was so  easy! Thank you, Brianne!

Quick and easy.   I didn't use as much butter and it was fine.
I used breadcrumbs (Italian) and 
baked for 8 min then broiled to crisp them up.  Very good!!

Turned out very good. I might have to attempt to make it a little healthier though bc it was soaking in butter, which while it tasted good, is pretty bad for you.

I used Panko bread crumbs instead of saltine crackers, but either one will work well.  Everyone loved how moist, flakey and flavorful the walleye tasted.  I will definitely prepare this dish again!

I used this with red snapper. It was very moist and flavorful, but I would have liked the breading to turn out crisper. May want to bake at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time.

I substituted the saltine crackers, Parmesan cheese and garlic powder with Ceaser croutons ground into crumbs.   Oh so yummy.

I didn't have any basil or oregano left, but it didn't matter. Walleye doesn't need much seasoning to be amazing. I did use an Italian style breadcrumbs mixture. I served it on fresh spinach and basmati rice and it was fantastic!

This was moist, flavorful & delicious! I used a couple I'd of different crackers since I didn't have saltines & pulverized them in my Vitamix dry blender. I had one large walleye filet and dipped both sides in the melted butter before pressing it into the cracker mixture. I sprinkled 1/2 of the remaining crackers over the top, then tipped the baking dish and spooned butter over the crackers. Then sprinkled the rest of the crackers on top. I baked it for the full 30 minutes then broiled on hi for 5 minutes to finish crisping the top. The top was crispy but the bottom was soggy. Next time I'll crisp both sides on the stove first then finish in the oven as someone else suggested.

My family loved this recipe. I used bass fillets and fine bread crumbs but otherwise cooked it according to the recipe. Because I used bread crumbs instead of crackers, I broiled for a few minutes to crisp it up. Will make again for sure!

Very tasty, quick and easy. Substituted multi-grain crackers and Basa fish but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. This will be a routine addition to my menu; I plan on trying it with other species of fish as well.

This was excellent! I made it with the parmesan, and it had great flavor. My 12-year old who hates fish and my husband who prefers heavy batter both enjoyed it. We didn't have any leftovers!

Made it once with bread crumbs - 
A second time with Wheat Thins cracker crumbs- 
Much much better with the cracker crumbs
Also I started it on the stove - got a golden crust - then finished it in the oven. Delicious!

Delicious!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and used 1/4 cup croutons instead of crackers. I added dried parsley instead of oregano and added 1/2 teaspoon of Chili Seasoning II from this site for a little something extra.  Brushed fillets with olive oil, coated with herb mix, then added a couple of small pats of butter on top of fish to help crisp it up.  Fish can be baked or grilled on tin foil.  This meal received rave reviews from the guys!

This recipe is great. I used tilapia.  I didn't have any saltines or crackers, but I had a partial box of Italian style panko crumbs.  So I used that and added in all the seasonings.  I also halved the butter because an entire stick seemed like a lot!  It turned out great, and the seasonings plus the Italian panko crumbs, minus the butter... It was perfect.  I made a pasta salad and green beans on the side.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very good I made it with Basa Fillets, rice and Glazed Dijon Carrots.Along with the herbs in the recipe I added some Parsley and dill.
