I wanted to cut back on the fat, so I used a small container of low-fat key lime yogurt and low-fat sour cream. I also added another tsp. of lime juice. Very good. It's almost like a key lime pie, only without the crust. ;)

I think a little less mayo would probably be good, but besides that, this is an excellent recipe. It goes really well over chicken too as a sauce, so I use it to make my Ginger Lime Chicken recipe, which is boneless chicken brests cooked, then covered in this sauce. Thank you so much for sharing!

The mayo taste is overpowering with the current proportions, so I added more ginger, honey, and lime. it still didn't taste all that great. I think I would make a different fruit dip before I tried this one again. Too bad, it was so easy!
