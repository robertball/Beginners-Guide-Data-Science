I made two slight changes but they were so miniscule that it's really not a huge deal. Instead of plain water, I soaked two Celestial Seasonings honey vanilla white tea chai bags in the half cup of water I heated for about five minutes and used that to add a little oomph. I also added two tbsp. of honey. Those were the two things I noticed that people said that these muffins needed, a little spice and perhaps a little honey. The smell of these while baking was amazing and they look super fluffy and just beautiful. Mine did need just a few more minutes to bake. Half of this recipe will be for my two kids and husband and the other half will be gifted to a friend tonight. I'll update my review once I found out how everyone liked them. EDITED: They were a hit. The kids inhaled them and couldn't really tell they were sans sugar. This will be my new blueberry muffin recipe. Thank you SO much for sharing.

I'll admit, I was a bit wary of making these because of all the reviews saying that their was no flavor. Based on my (small) changes, I rate it five stars. I think the flavor is great, I really don't miss the sugar at all, and the texture is really good too. I used apple sauce instead of the oil, subbed 1/4 cup of the flour for flaxseed meal, and added half a teaspoon of vanilla. I also halfed the recipe, so the measurements are based on that.

I was expecting no taste and was pleasantly surprised. For a no-sugar recipe, I think these came out amazing. The key to the flavor is ripe bananas and delicious fresh blueberries.

Curiosity!  I just had to try this one out for curiosity’s sake and let me tell you, whole wheat and no sugar was a bit of a culture shock for me.  I made sure to use overripe bananas and ripe blueberries to give it some sweetness.  They were really moist and better on the second day.  However, I just couldn't overcome the blandness.  I even added extra blueberries, cinnamon, and nutmeg and still nothing.  Next time I will try with a little honey.  This recipe will really make you stop and think about how dependent we are on sweeteners in one form or another.

My husband is a diabetic so I'm always looking for no sugar muffins. These are pretty darn good. I had some really juicy, sweet blueberries which I think really help. I did use a bit less soda, and baking powder. I also added about a teaspoon of my homemade pumpkin pie spice. Without this added spice it's probably boring. The batter was really thick so next time I think I'll give it just a small amount of liquid sweetener. I only got 12 regular size muffins & needed 2 more minutes in the oven. Next time I'll add some walnuts for even more nutrition. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

With a few alterations this was pretty damned good. Use really ripe bananas and increase to 1 1/4 cups mashed banana. Increase blueberries to 1 1/2 cups and always use fresh. Replace 1/2 cup flour with flax meal and half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce (keep some of the oil because fat helps control blood sugar spikes in reaction to the sugars in food). Adding spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, allspice, ginger and clove are a really good idea to give it more flavor. You can also oompf up the health factor by including fiber and vanilla protein powder.

Great recipe! Since there is no added sugar, you would think that the muffins wouldn't be very sweet.  But, they are very tasty and healthy! My children wanted to eat 3 of them for breakfast!  I frequently make banana bread and muffins...this recipe is much healthier and you don't miss the sugar!

Remarkably good. I did add some (1/4 c) soy protein powder & fiber to bump it up for my weight loss program. Also didn't have any blueberries, but added the equiv. in cherries (20). Still a great combo and tasty.

Wow, Speck, these are awesome.  You can sort of notice there's no sugar but it doesn't pose a problem at all.  To be honest, I think they are much better than some of the sugary muffins we're used to baking.  The baking time was right on the mark and the final product was oh so fluffy.

Unfortunately, I did not have enough ingredients so I changed the recipe a little. I used 1/2 cup banana, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, and 1/4 cup grapeseed oil for the banana part of the recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I will try using 1 1/4 cup wild blueberries next time. They are very good warm. The consistence was good. I made 12 and baked them for 28 minutes.

LOVE THESE. They definitely made 12 largish muffins that needed a bit more time in the oven, but they were really delicious. I added a shot of vanilla & some grated carrot but I think even without those add-ons it would have been great. They're not really sweet but very tasty topped with butter. My diabetic grandmother is going to love these:)

These were surprisingly good!  I did change a few things based on the other reviews.  I wanted something nonfat, so I subbed my homemade no sugar added cinnamon applesauce for the oil.  I used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 c all purpose flour.  To add some spice, I simmered the water with 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t each nutmeg and ground cloves for several minutes. Finally I added just 2 Tbs honey. They rose really welll, and were done perfectly! My 2 year old loved them! I did 1 and 1/2 the recipe and got a full 2 dozen.

These were pretty good.  My banana probably wasn't ripe enough and I added 1/2 c applesauce to make up for only one banana- so that could have been the problem.  But, even after adding some almond extract, 1 T honey, and a packet of Stevia I thought these were pretty bland.  I think it's a good base recipe, but I'm going to have to play around with it to see what it's missing.  I'm hypoglycemic, so I'm used to cooking without sugar and I don't think that's the missing element.

These are very good, and done exactly as the recipe says, they taste like what they are: healthy, whole wheat, blueberry-banana muffins. They are not sweet, and I might not give them as a gift unless I knew the recipient would appreciate the healthy, whole-wheat taste.

These muffins for me... need a little something else.  I used frozen banana and blueberries, so I don't know if that was the difference or not but I miss either sugar or a pinch of salt.

Initial shock over the lack of sweetness didn't last long.  I really appreciate the actual flavour of the muffin.  I did add 2 tbsp honey as per other reviewers but am not really sure if it makes that much of a difference.   An excellent healthy muffin recipe.

I followed this exactly except for adding just a bit more blueberries. These were wonderful! Since I don't like sweet muffins these were perfect. They taste very healthy! Thanks!

these are very good for no sugar muffins.  I wish I could find more recipes like this that don't just replace sugar with artificial sweeteners.  My kids are not crazy about these but I am trying to wean them off the super sugary muffin mixes from a box.  I added 2 tablespoons of honey and used the apple juice leftover from making applesauce for the water.  Also my flour was white wheat mixture (1/2 & 1/2).  Thank you for posting this.  Post more like it!

I used applesauce instead of oil like another reviewer suggested. The result looked like the pictures. It worked, but it is what it is, a sugarless muffin. Unlike the other reviewers I felt this could be tastier, but plan to eat with pb for extra taste. Its great to have such a healthy baked option.  Will try again.

I loved these muffins. I did not have enough wheat flour (only 1 cup) so I added oatmeal to make up the difference.  I am sure they were not as light but I liked the extra texture.  Will try with 2 cups wheat flour & also would try adding 1 tsp of vanilla extract & a tablespoon of honey.  I am diabetic so this will be a welcome change for breakfast.

Great recipe I made a couple of changes.  Instead of blueberries I added one cup of mixed berries.  Blackberry, blueberry and raspberry.  Gave a sweeter muffine.  I also replaced 1/2 flax seed meal.  Turned our great have made this over and over.  They don't last long with my boyfriend.

I made this for a diabetic person and unfortunately, it didn't come out well. I've made other fruit/no sugar breads, but this came out rather bland, unless you spread butter or jam on top.

After reading other reviews I made the following changes.  I substituted orange juice for the water and applesauce for the oil.  Increased the bananas and fresh blueberries to 1 1/2 cups each, making sure both were very ripe. Added cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. I also made it in a loaf pan and baked for 40 min. Just goes to show that not only can we bake with less sugar, but no sugar works too!

Used this recipe as a base for strawberry and apple muffins. I used 1 cup chunky unsweetened apple sauce and 1 & 1/2 cup not quite puréed strawberries. I also used fruit juice instead of water, to sweeten a little. I agree with others, it needs salt and spices. I used cinnamon in mine.

If you are used to sugar then you can tell that there is none in this recipe.  That said, they taste ok and 2 of 3 kids in my house give it 5 stars.  I cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups, adding 1/4 cup flax and 1/4 cup wheat germ. I also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  Next time I will add some vanilla per the recommendation of some other reviewers, and an additional 1/2 cup of crushed blueberries.

I made these for my daughter & myself since we're on the 'elimination allergy diet'. I subsituted the wheat flour w/gluten free flour. They turned out very good.

Love the texture of these muffins…and didn't really miss the sugar.  I did add some vanilla but otherwise followed the recipe with no changes… I would make these again with other combinations of fruit like  raspberries and mini chocolate chips added to the ripe banana.  Great with tea or coffee too.

Excellent, one of the moist muffins I have ever made!  I couldn't resist without the sugar so I added just about 1/4 cup of Splenda.  And I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour.

I also used a spatula for mixing.  I believe this helped it from over mixing (which I usually end up doing LOL).

Wonderful, will make these once again without an issue.

I was not impresed with these at all. I used strawberry jam instead of a cup of banana (which didn't add anything to the flavor, just for the moisture) and Gluten free flour. For the second batch I added a few tablespoons of white sugar and that helped a lot. It might just be my flour that made it taste off. Usually I will substitute 1 for 1 and it tastes delicious. But this isn't a recipe I will try again. Oh, the first ones without sugar I drizzled honey on top, I wish I had added it into the batter!

I make this recipe often, and love it.  Super simple and quick! I don't like sweet foods much so this is a nice muffin for breakfast or snack time.  My husband even takes them to work.  They look beautiful and taste great with soft margarine.

These muffins rose nicely, had a very good appearance, were moist inside and browned just right on the outside, but had no taste at all.

I will be making again and I did change per some suggestions from others.  Added 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 Tbsp. honey. Substituted 1/4 C applesauce for half the oil, 1 C all purpose flour for half the whole wheat, 1/4 C orange juice for half the water and am considering adding cinnamon next time. We loved them and are trying to eliminate sugar, so this is a good start.

I was short about 1/4 cup of wheat flour, so I topped up the cup with quick cooking oatmeal. I added a tsp of honey to the wet ingredients.  I also sprinkled some oatmeal over the tops before putting in oven. I mixed wet ingredients in one bowl and dry ingredients in a second bowl, then I added the dry into the wet bowl and stirred until all the dry was moistened. They turned out really good. Moist and light!

These are great!  I did a few minor tweaks... Added 1/4 cup more banana, used avocado oil instead of vegetable, added 1 tsp vanilla, and instead of flour I put steal cut oats in my food processor (to make a flour consistency) and used that instead - you would never notice the difference. Thanks for the recipe - we are on a "zero added sugar journey"

No sugar?! You guys, a MUST TRY recipe... But do make sure your bananas are really ripe. Very moist and good! Didn't miss the sugar at all. We all need more recipes like these. Speck, you're awesome! ;)

Great recipe for the sugar conscious. I added vanilla and sprinkled the top with a little sugar and cinnamon because I was afraid I'd miss the sugar too much - I didn't. My husband loved them too. A great breakfast treat for those on the go and kids who don't need the sugar. Very moist and a great treat for lunch boxes.

I made these for a diabetic coworker and they were great. I followed someone suggestion and added nutmeg, cinnamon, and a half cup of Splenda. I also felt there were not enough blueberry's so I added some more. I've never cooked with wheat flour before and no sugar, but I will make this a lot since there is less guilt. My husband even liked it!

These were pretty good; i added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice to give a little more flavor.  i made them into mini muffins and baked at 350 for 14 minutes.  i also only added 2 tsp baking powder and it was plenty.  next time i will add a little sugar though, i do need a little sweetness!

Great standard no sugar added recipe. though I did follow  one reviewer's  idea and added 2 scoops  of a vanilla protein powder which had a little fructose in it. I used very ripe  bananas and frozen blueberries but came out great for a healthy/satisfying breakfast. Will make again for sure!

Great appearance and consistency.  Taste was decent (not bland), but I found the taste way too heavy of baking powder.  Also, not sure why, but my batter was so think before adding the blueberries, that I had to add at least an additional half cup of water to even be able to fold in the blueberries.  Next time I would like to try it with a little cinnamon & nutmeg.  Made 24 mini muffins and 8 regular sized muffins.

I'll make these again!! so yummy-- great texture and great flavor.
 I made 5 changes:
1. I subbed white whole wheat flour.
2. Instead of 1/2c of water, I used the crushed pineapple with juice (not syrup, but pineapple juice) .
3. Added ½ tsp kosher salt.
4. I used 2T of butter, melted and avocado oil, to equal the ½C oil.
5. I drizzled them with a syrup I made with 2T of sugar and 4½ tsp of lemon juice after they were done and popped them back in the (now turned off) oven for about 4 minutes.

Good recipe.  I made it again and modified with additional mashed fruit to  make it a little better and less banana.  I really like not having any sugar except from fruit!

I doubled the recipe but didnt have alot of frozen blueberries so i mixed blueberries & raspberries together . Added cinnamon & vanilla also.  It is my version of Tim Hortons fruit explosion muffins. Oh I also used 4 cups of fruit, started watching them at the 15 min. mark. All in all they are pretty good since my son has now smuggled 4 of the muffins lol.

My audience for these was my daughter's preschool class, so I was looking for a healthier muffin with less refined sugar (as opposed to no sugar). I read others' ideas and then made the following changes: white whole wheat flour instead of regular whole wheat, added 2 TB honey, 1 tsp vanilla and a1 tsp baking spice. I subbed apple sauce for the oil and milk for the water. I tossed my frozen blueberries in a little flour and threw in another 1/4 c blueberries for good measure. I got 12 beautifully risen muffins with good texture. A nice healthier take on blueberry muffins I think the sugar-obsessed preschoolers will gobble up. I certainly enjoyed mine!

Love this recipe! I substituted unsweetened apple sauce for oil and added some ground flax seeds and cinnamon. They came out delicious and we're such a big hit with my fam that just 2 days later I'm making them again- but doubling the recipe:)

I just popped these in the oven, and will update them on how they are! I did add some vinilla plus cinnamon, but I also added my trademark muffin topping. Which is some Maple sugar mixed with orange zest! UPDATE: THESE. ARE. THE. BEST. MUFFINS EVER.

I made these muffins, they were moist and very good the only changes I made was 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of oil, and I added a 1/2 cup of powered stevia to the flour mixture. This made them just a little sweet but not to sweet, they are now one of my favorites, one muffin and some Greek yogurt make a quick and good breakfast. I will make again.

This were great as gluten free and vegan also.  I used a flaxseed alternative (1tbls flaxseed, 1/4 cup warm water, let gel) gluten free flour, 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and 1/2 cup almond milk instead of water.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla for flavor.

If you're looking for a low sugar option, then this is perfect. I made these into mini muffins and they turned out awesome!

It kind of amuses me that some of the changes/additions (like applesauce) contain sugar.

No flavor. I even added a tablespoon of cinnamon and teaspoon of vanilla and 2 tablespoons of agave and this still tasted like wheat flour. I think it might need 1 tsp or so of salt.

Generally really good. The texture was perfect! It's not super sweet (which I suppose is what makes it healthy lol) but that does make it perfect to pair with some jam and butter. My only real criticism is that it wasn't particularly flavourful, hence the need for jam and butter. But I would still make it again!

These muffins are a great way to use up ripe bananas and they are okay for my husband who has diabetes.  They also freeze well which I like.

I made 18 muffins, just as the recipe directed. I also made the following additions based on the tastes of my family: dash of cinnamon, dash of dried orange peel, splash of vanilla, substituted chopped strawberries for the blueberries. I used two extremely ripe bananas and it was exactly 1 cup of mashed banana. I will definitely make again! No sugar necessary. They might benefit from a dash of salt.

After reading the other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1tbsp of organic honey.  I forgot to add the baking powder so I was pleasantly surprised that they still came out light and moist!  Will try substituting applesauce for oil next time...

Very happy with this recipe-  I changed some things based on others' suggestions.  Substituted orange juice for water, used 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c veg oil instead of 1/2 c veg oil, only 1 and 3/4 tsp baking powder, 2 Tbsp honey, and 3/4 tsp of cinnamon.  Whole family enjoyed!  I'm sure spreading some butter or margarine on them would make them super tasty, but I'm trying not to so as to keep them healthy!

I tweaked this a bit too, based on what i had on hand and personal preferences:  I added vanilla, a half teaspoon of salt, used two bananas, a fourth of a cup of organic brown sugar, some hemp hearts and a splash of orange juice.  They come out fluffy, and my kiddos LOVE them.

This recipe was exactly what the title suggests and I believe in making recipes as stated the first time. That said, I made a lot of changes I loved this time! I substitued applesauce for oil, milk for water and added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/3 cup brown sugar. We LOVE them! My 1 & 3 year olds love them and my husband didn't notice the reduced sugar. Win-win!

I don't think this recipe has enough flour in it. It fell flat and tasteless, while I'm all for no sugar I think another overripe banana, some honey and another cup of flour would do the trick

Great recipe without the refined sugar! I made some changes due to reviews saying the flavor was bland.... 
added a small amount of vanilla, a little cinnamon, a little bit of brown sugar (maybe 1/8 cup IF THAT), a squirt of honey, some white and chocolate chips, used 1 cup white flour, 1 cup wheat, used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. Also added in some flaxseed. Moist and delicious!! Had to bake an additional 3 minutes to full cook. Enjoy!!

I added plain yogurt, vanilla, a dash of honey, and nutmeg. I used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil.

I love this recipe!! I add raspberries instead of blueberries, they seem to give it extra flavour and I add some chocolate chips, because I love chocolate.

These were great! I added a little vanilla extract, and used fresh strawberries instead of blueberries.
