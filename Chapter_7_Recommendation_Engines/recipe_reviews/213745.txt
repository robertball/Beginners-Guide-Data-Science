I am the submitter of this recipe. ostrich is NOT a poultry-type meat, but is a red meat and is best cooked to medium rare or rare, otherwise it goes very leathery. So when cooking the steaks it would not be possible to get a golden brown on each side and to get rid of all the pink! Cook the steaks more gently rather than sear them, and treat them as you would treat Venison.

They brought ostrich to Colorado years ago in an attempt to introduce us to the delicate meat. The project failed miserably and never became mainstream I think because the birds were so large, unusual and regal but a few restaurants still prepare it. Very meaty and lean it is delicious when prepared properly. I'm a fan although it is no longer sold retail here. California Cafe in Denver still features it and it expensive but incredible and worth it! (30.00 a steak)

Thank you :)  I had no idea how to cook ostrich steaks and this really hit the spot.  FANTASTIC Sunday lunch.  My bf LOOOOOVED it.  I didn't have apple brandy so I substituted apricot brandy and it was still delicious.  Can't wait to make it again!
