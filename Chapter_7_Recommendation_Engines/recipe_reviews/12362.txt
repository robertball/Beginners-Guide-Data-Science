I was not overly impressed. It tasted a lot like a sugar cookie to me and just using sugar cookie dough would be easier. No kneading. Just be sure to not over bake.

I added a little more sugar to the dough (my preference) and made it in my food processor---much easier that way. I blind baked it in a 9" removable bottom tart pan and once cooled filled it with a key lime filling using sweetened condensed milk egg yolks lime juice and zest. Baked at 325 until just set (about 14 min.) and cooled completely on a rack before refrigerating for several hours. The crust was quite delicious and flaky.

I made this last night and for the amount of work I felt it just wasn't impressive. It was not flaky it was slightly tough. it did not puff at all. Definitely more like a sugar cookie than a flaky tart pastry. Didn't taste bad but wasn't worth the work and mess.
