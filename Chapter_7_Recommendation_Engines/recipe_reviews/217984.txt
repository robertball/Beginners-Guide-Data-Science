YUMM YUMMM YUMMM The only thing I did differently is that instead of the tomato sauce I used 1/4 cup of red cooking wine and 2 tbsp tomato paste (italian style from a tube)

This was excellent.  I prepared the dish exactly as written and served it with Mofongo (from this site, same author of this recipe).  If you like garlic, you will love this.  Will definitely prepare this lovely, garlicky dish again.

This is a very good recipie!  I tweaked it a little because my wife does not like tomato sauce, or spicy things.  So in place of the sauce I just got a package of Lawrys Sundried tomato and garlic sauce, and Mixed that in.  She also does not like spicy as well, so I cut out the peppers and put in paprika in place.  But followed the rest of the recipie to a T.  I Put it all on a bed of pasta,(would also go well with rice) and It came out with a VERY light Mediterranean taste.  Definately season with salt and black pepper at the end, but it came out SO Flavorful!  My wife said it was restraunt quality. I am rating this a 5 because this is a very EASY recipie with good results at the end.

Yum! I made this for my Puerto Rican girlfriend and she 100% approved! Just a few notes. First, tomato sauce is not the same thing as you'd put on spaghetti. It's actually more of a purée. Look for Goya tomato sauce in little cans. Also, I'm assuming "fresh" shrimp means uncooked. I couldn't find any uncooked shrimp on sale, so I added cooked shrimp, but not until the final 5 minutes when the tomato sauce went in. Any earlier than that and the shrimp will get mushy. 

I served over white rice, and if you want the full experience, make some plantain slices fried in olive oil as the side. There was a decent amount of leftovers even after 2 large plates each.

Delicioso!  I was nervous that the garlic would overpower everything else, but once it was done I thought it tasted fantastic.  I upped the red pepper flakes a bit because my fiance loves spicy food, otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I'm adding this to my keeper file, gracias latinacook!

very tasty, I used red bell instead of green and fresh parsley (because that's what I had) and reduced the butter, as well as added a jalapeno.  Will make this again.

Big hit with the whole family! Doubled the recipe so i was shoveling in the garlic. Our family loves garlic, though, so we didn't find it heavy handed at all. The posted pic is not representative at all, though! This makes a nice sauce that goes better on rice, by far, than in tacos.

I followed the recipe with just a few small changes: I used 1/3 each green, red and yellow peppers for more color, instead of tomato sauce, I pureed 1/2 can of garlic-basil diced tomatoes, and I added 1/4 cup of sherry when the shrimp were almost cooked. It was absolutely delicious served over angel pasta.

I didn't expect it to be as flavorful as it was.  This was really good.  I had too double the recipe. Since 1 pound wouldn't of been enough for my family of 5. They loved it. There were no leftovers.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and easy to prepare!  I loved the garlic and spice.  For tomato sauce I used vodka tomato sauce because it's what I had.  I served it inside corn tortillas and it was very tasty.  I think it would also be great over rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious dish. A bit heavy on the butter. Didn't have green pepper so I added blanched bok choy instead at the same time as when I added in the tomato sauce. May try to reduce or eliminate the butter next time for a more healthy dish.

Great shrimp recipe and so simple.  I always like to put a little bit of anchovy paste in when I saute vegetables.  You can't tell there are anchovies in there at all, it just gives it a nutty, salty flavor.  Very good, thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used red bell pepper instead of green and fresh parsley instead of dried.  The cook time is definitely shorter then 20 min - probably more like 13-15 min.  I served this recipe with "Best Spanish Rice" from this website.

This was very good. I doubled the amount of green bell pepper, and I couldn't really taste the garlic, so next time I will double that as well. I think cilantro would work better than parsley.

I love it. I had a hard time mixing it in with the tomato sauce, so I watered it down a little and it worked perfectly and also water came out as delicious shrimp soup. 
I made this with Brazilian white rice and creamy potato salad from this site as well. I'm a beginner cook and it came out perfect. THANK YOU

Great recipe! I used 3 Jalapenos instead of the green bell pepper. Turned out great. I put this over a bed of yellow rice and the wife and I loved it.

Yummy and very easy to prepare. Taste just like something you order from a Mexican restaurant. I served it with some Spanish rice for a complete meal.

Absolutely delicious.  I used tomato/basil pasta sauce instead of the regular tomato.  I will make this again, and again, and again!

Super yum! Made it as written except I added the sauce/parsley/red pepper mix the same time as the shrimp and kept them on opposite sides of the pan as to not overlook the shrimp. Served over plain white rice to soak up that nice sauce. Thank you

Followed recipe, it was delicious.  Had a spring mix of veggies with it.  Next time will make up some sticky rice to put it on.  With two in the house it was a bit much but looking forward to left overs tonight.   Da Grinch

Super easy and really yummy.  I put in the amount of red pepper flakes and the spice level was perfect.   I also used cilantro on the taco instead of parsley inside mix.  I would also suggest some chopped cabbage which I wish that I had.  I added it to handmade corn tortillas.  The picture I added was taken right before I added the 1 cup of tomato sauce.  It also doesn't really need 1/4 cup of butter but it sure makes it takes better!

Anytime I try out a new recipe, I make my husband rate it and he gave it a solid 7. I think I may have enjoyed it more than him and would give it an 8. This is a very good, flavorful recipe that is easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added jalapeño. I also sprinkled some Adobo seasoning, since I had it on hand. Instead of dried parsley, I opted for fresh parsley.  It tasted like a fish that you would eat at someone's house-there was something Beth comforting and satisfying about this dish. Overall, I'd highly recommend making it!

This was fabulous.  I did change a few things. Instead of using tomatoe sauce I substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes and served over speghetti. I also cut the garlic down to 5 large cloves pressed. My husband and sister loved it, my sister got up during th night and had some left overs.

This was a great recipe and a definite keeper.  We live on the coast in Brazil and shrimp is one of the major food groups here.  My wife does not like hot stuff so I left out the red pepper flakes and used fresh parsley instead of dried.  This will be one we make for the next time we entertain.  We made saffron rice (rice cooked a little sauteed onion and cooked in chicken broth with a little saffron) and covered it with the shrimp.  I just did not have the courage to pour this over the banana deal without making a batch to try first.  We will give it a shot this week.

It's a really good start. I seasoned the shrimp while I was prepping the rest(sort of a dry cure), and like someone else here swapped the tomato sauce for a heaping tablespoon of  tomato paste and sherry. Next time I plan to also add some carrot and celery, but it was good enough to merit a next time on it's own.

Tasty and flavorful.  I modified recipe.  left out the hot peppers since we didn’t want it spicy today.  I used red and orange peppers since I was out of green peppers.  I used half of the tomato sauce since less tomato was desired. Still was good!

Delish! I generously wiped out the cast iron I had made bacon in this morning and used that (Like a boss!) :D Followed the recipe to the T (other than using fresh parsley) and it turned out amazing!  Served over home-made yellow rice. Fantastic!

Super easy, tasty and got rave reviews by my husband.  I served it over rice and used orange peppers instead of green.  I also added peas for additional color, which worked well.

Delicious! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/4 cup red wine and 2 tbsp tomato paste instead. I forgot the red pepper flakes and parsley, but it was still to die for.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was easy, restaurant quality and absolutely delicious!!  I only made a few changes.  I used red bell pepper because I prefer the flavor over green pepper.  While I love rice the family does not so I served over bow tie pasta and it was a perfect pairing. This will definitely be added to our rotation. Thank you!!

AWESOME RECIPE!  Made this last night & served it over pasta.  So easy, yet very tasty with a complicated taste, felt like I'd spent ton of time preparing the dish.  Followed the recipe exactly with only one change, used 1 cup of tomato basil spaghetti sauce, as I had 3/4 lb. of pasta & wanted all the pasta to make friends with the shrimp & its sauce.  Will be making this again & again.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us all.

Serve in a wrap. 1-2 tbsp butter, 1/2-1 lg onion, 6lg or 10 small garlic cloves, 1 1/2 lb shrimp, may want to add rice in wrap. To make juicier add other 1/2 of tomato sauce and more olive oil/butter.

So very good! I made a few changes though. Doubled the green pepper, added one full cubed tomato, topped it with about an ounce of shredded goat cheese. Delicious!

This recipe is perfect as it is! I have made it several times. I really just eye everything now as it relates to ingredients. The only change I sometimes make is adding a second can of tomato sauce for a more saucy dish. I serve over fluffy white rice with side salad and maybe some garlic bread. Delicious and so easy! Folks will think you slaved over this. I still don't understand how so few ingredients have such a wonderful and full flavor! Thank you for sharing.

Awesome! Made it just as written, but think I can cut butter in half and still get great flavor. Used brown rice. This is a keeper.

Just made it for the first time, and it is definitely a keeper.  Delicious as is, and I wouldn't change a thing with the spices.   It is very well seasoned, and I am a girl who loves seasoning.   You could do a whole bell pepper if you wanted additional veggies to make these more like fajitas.  I served these wrapped in tortillas as soft tacos.

I didn't change a thing and it was delicious! Don't decrease the amount of garlic and make sure you use tomato sauce. I served these in tortillas like shrimp tacos and my family gobbled them up. I'll serve them over rice next time. This is my new "go-to" shrimp recipe.

Great dish. I made it exactly as written (except that my shrimp were frozen) and served it over cooked white rice. Lots of garlic flavor here, and that little bit of crushed red pepper goes a long way. Very nice.

I used a whole red pepper for this recipe.  My garlic I minced. Also I used cooked shrimp, so I added them in at the same time as the tomato sauce so they didn't get over cooked.  Other than that, left it as is and this dish was AMAZING!!!

This is an incredibly tasty and very simple recipe.  I left out the bell pepper (don't like it) and the parsley (didn't have it) and everyone at dinner loved it.  My daughter called me tonight to get the recipe because the son-in-law was wanting her to make it.   And another thing:  I would double the recipe next time, because four people at every single drop.

This recipe was not only quick and easy but delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, minus the pepper flakes, and I served it over white rice. So much flavor. I'm glad I have leftovers and I will definitely be making this again :)
