Baked fudge is NOT fudge. I can see how the name is misleading, but it is NOT supposed to be like the fudge that you get at the candy store.

It's also not like brownies-- it's supposed to be a little runny and mushy. The reviewers who have given this one star based on the fact that it is mushy have not made a mistake-- that's how it is SUPPOSED to turn out if it is baked fudge.

If you want baked fudge, this is a fantastic recipe. If you want candy fudge or brownies, this is not the recipe for you.

That being said... I love my grandmother's baked fudge and this was just like it! It was so delicious that I ate about two full servings- after a full meal- and I usually can't even finish one adult dessert serving. Mmmmm. I was a little intimidated about the roasting pan and the water, but it was very easy and VERY VERY worth it! THANKS

This is a fantastic recipe!  No, as others have stated, it is NOT fudge... more like a VERY fudgy brownie, but still great.  I added a litlle extra cocoa (about 1 1/2 TBS) and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top before baking.  Excellent seved warm with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream!

This recipe tastes great! I only gave it 3 stars, because of a few things about the way it's described:

1) As someone else pointed out, this isn't fudge. It's delicious, but not fudge.

2) I followed all directions, but 50-60 minutes at 300 degrees doesn't cook this. I cooked it almost 1 and a half hours at 300, and still had pudding in the bottom of the pan. Increasing the oven to 425 and cooking another 10 minutes finished it off.

I don't care if this is healty or "NOT FUDGE" as previous reviews, all I know is this stuff is good. Yes, I'm not good at making flan as this is to be baked..mine turned out gooey not set. But the first smell, the first look...this was..OH..the spoon came out of the drawer, I waited for it to cool a little, I ..I...it was a Saturday...I took it to bed with me..I didn't stop..spoon full after spoonful...as I kept telling myself this is bad but I didn't care I just kept going...it was getting all over..I lost control...after wiping my mouth with my top sheet i put the pan on my night table. My cat was sitting on the corner of my bed looking at me with ears down in disgust..this was truly the best and dirtyest thing I've ever done in bed and I will do it again.

Well, there is no doubt that this recipe is absolutely delicious.  Mine didn't come out the right texture, though (it was really globby, like a pudding cake), probably because I used self-rising flour instead of regular.  Oh well...better luck next time I make it!

Very, very fudgie brownie!  It makes a crisp crust on top and ooey-gooey in the middle.  I added 1 Tb more cocoa.  My husband loved it and said it was so chocolatey.  It sets up as it cools, so I recommend cooling it very well before eating.  Even better the next day, if it is still around!

This had the most wonderful chocolate flavor and was easy to put together.  I had to use a 9x9 pan and I couldn't tell if it was done at the end of the 60 minutes. I jiggled the pan and the top was set.  I should have used a toothpick because the bottom was a fudgesauce.  So I realize I should have baked it longer.  I finished my pan up in the microwave.  Turned out fine.

I made some alterations to this recipe.  1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, instead of 1/2 of a cup.  1 cup of melted Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (It promotes weight loss, and a feel of satiety, so I do not end up eating the entire tray of fudge!!!)  2 cups of melted semi-sweet chocolate chip. I replaced the 2 cups of sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. It gave the fudge more of a 'chocolatey' tase, because I love chocolate.  I put the coconut oil and the semi-sweet chocolate chips together in a bowl and melted it, and I let it cool for about 15mins. before adding it to my dry ingredients.  I did not use any pecans. I did not have any at home.  The fudge was divine, and I only ate 4 pieces, instead of the whole tray, because of made it with the Extra Virgin Coconut oi, instead of melted butter. I added a frosting topping for daughter. She likes icing on her fudge and brownies.  PS. Make sure to cook fudge at 275 degrees, because coconut oil burns at a high temperature!  I let it bake for 35mins, and I removed it from the oven.  What a treat. You will love it like this if you a chocolate lover!!!

LOVED THIS! Thanks for contributing it!

AS A SIDE NOTE: For those of you who are complaining that it's unhealthy, yeah, it probably is, but NO ONE is forcing you to make it OR eat it. Exercise some self control if you are concerned about the ingredients.  

NO, it isn't 'real fudge' but or those of us who, due to disability aren't always able to stand and beat the fudge until it loses it's, gloss, this is great as an alternative. AGAIN, if you don't like the method, DON'T MAKE IT!

If you 'altered' the recipe to the point that it no longer looks like the original in the ways that count, congratulations - you have your own new recipe.

I wasn't what I expected at all. It was complete mush except for the top. The top tasted really good but the bottom wasn't great. It was more like chocolate jello than fudge or brownies.

I was so excited to make this, but it turned out very underdone.  Any ideas why? My oven was definitely pre-heated for a long time, and I baked it for an hour. Please someone help I want to try again!

My boys (18months and 6 years) just loved this brownie/fudge dessert.  I had gobs of ingredients around and searched for something to make on this website.  The only problem is, I had already started mixing things together when I realized the recipe called for a roasting pan and I don't have one.

I made this last night, as written except without pecans since my daughter won't eat them;  baked for about 60 minutes. (My first try at any kind of fudge.)  This was an easy recipe to follow.   Results were very gooey initially,  but after refrigerating overnight ... WOW ...  Awesome!!!  The texture is somewhere between fudge and chewy brownies (a little soft but no problem for us) ... and now able to be cut into squares with a small spatula.  So rich and chocolate-y good!!!  Thanks for the recipe; a definite keeper!

I agree that it is NOT Fudge. Not even fudge like brownies. More like a fudge cake. However, regardless of what it's called it is excellent!! It tastes very good. I am on a low/no sugar diet so I substituted 1 cup of sugar with one cup of sucralose for baking. Tasted great! Then I loaded the sugar back on it by topping it with some chocolate frosting and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. It was very tasty. I am now going to make it again!

I first got this recipe from my aunt, who called it "1800s Baked Fudge".  It pre-dates candy thermometers, chocolate chips, and fluff, and is what fudge really was like in the old days.  It's real fudge, just not what we've become used to.

Is the temperature really supposed to be 300?  It did not get firm as the recipe suggested.  The flavor was great but it was the consistency of syrup.  It would be fantastic on ice cream.

This recipe was great! I'd never tried this before but it was fab. This isn't brownies, as some claimed, it had an entirely different texture. Chewy at the top (but firm top) and goey in the bottom. My kid sister loved it, as did I. And finally a recipe made from simple ingredients available world-over (my family lives in a compound in the middle east, and we don't have quite the range of products as the USA). Thank you so much for an excellent recipe. Also, to whomever rated this low because it is 'unhealthy', my apologies, but I have never heard of anyone baking any sort of dessert for the health-benefits. I believe the appeal of dessert is that it ISN'T good for you, at least that is my experience of it.
