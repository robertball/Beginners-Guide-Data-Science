I used Irish Whiskey and also diluted it 50:50 with almond milk upon serving, to reduce the alcohol.  This did not make the flavor weak at all!  In place of the heavy cream, I used a can of Trader Joe's coconut milk.  It is superb!

I've been looking for this. Years ago my Bridge club referred to this as "THE RECIPE", wink, wink. I prefer vodka, but it really doesn't matter on the liquor. I use Hershey's chocolate syrup.  Try it with caramel sometime or one of the new flavored vodkas. It's better if you can leave it alone for a few days, more like 4 days instead of hours. Don't worry about how long it will last..it won't be left over.

Knocked 'em all back a foot.  45 of us drank the whole bottle playing cards.  Fantastic!!!
