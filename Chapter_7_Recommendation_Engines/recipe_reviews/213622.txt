This is something I used to make all the time, and for some reason forgot all about it.  Many thanks for reminding me.  It is one of the best chicken dishes around.  The only change I make is to add a heaping teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  The combo of sweet and hot is addictive!  I would also suggest that you use a not so sweet marmalade, like the kinds from Europe.

We made this last night & the orange marmalade glazed chicken was a big hit! I will definitely make this again but next time we will just use regular rice - the orange flavored rice was a bit too much orange for us - I think the yummy glazed chicken would be complimented better by just plain rice.  We served this with sugar snap peas - delicious!

Delicious! I followed the recipe for the chicken and added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I took the advice of others and skipped the rice part of the recipe and instead served the chicken with rice pilaf and green beans. Yum! I will definitely make this again!

Followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was dry and bland. I would maybe marinate it in orange juice for a half hour at least before cooking next time. Very disappointing. However, the rice/almond/onion combination was excellent.

Made this when my parents visited. The whole family loved it. My dad called me a gourmet cook! Very delicious and easy to make. I substituted basmati rice because I have a huge bag of it (I used the amount of water the basmati rice called for but made half of it orange juice). I also seasoned the chicken breasts with garlic pepper while cooking them. I'll definitely make this again.

Fantastic! The only thing I changed was to marinate my chicken in OJ and a pinch each of salt, pepper, and garlic powder as they thawed in the fridge over night. Dumped marinade and proceeded as directed.  Used a bit more OJ in the rice as I made basmati (what I had on hand). Excellent, fast, easy, and both kids loved it.  Thank you!

I made this for my boyfriend's family came to town last weekend. It was one of the most simple and delicious recipes ever. I am making it again tonight because I've been craving it all week! I served it with some cooked asparagus with parmesan on top and it made the meal.

Great recipe. I followed it exactly, except for omitting the green onions because I was too lazy to go out and buy some. I would advise that you drain the pan after you take out the toasted almonds and before you add the chicken/more butter. I left the almond "juice" in the pan, and I think this added unnecessary grease to the recipe. Everything still tasted fine, but it may have a lighter taste if the pan were drained. Also, I added the marmalade just after the chicken started to slightly brown, so it had a chance to carmelize as the chicken cooked up. Everything turned out yummy, especially the rice, which I will make again with other dishes.

This recipe is wonderful. It transforms boring chicken breasts into a gourmet meal with very little work involved. I left out the almonds and onions (my husband does not like them), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The rice tasted amazing; it was such a nice complement to the chicken. I will be making this again and again--especially for guests, as it is sure to impress.

Good for a quick and easy dinner, but be sure not to add the orange marmalade to the pan too soon, otherwise it will start to burn and turn the chicken black, as it caramelizes too much.  It was still tasty.

Quick, easy, and flavorful.  The toasted almonds were a nice addition, and the rice with the subtle orange flavor was a nice change from ordinary white rice.

I didn't change anything, and turned out great & will make again.  Husband suggested smaller chicken tenders.   My son ate the meat with BBQ sauce like he always does (kids!)  I wouldn't recommend the addition but even he said he'd like it again.

So Yummy and very easy.  I loved the sauce on the chicken more then the rice, but both made a great meal.

My family raved about the chicken.  I dredged it in flour, salt and pepper first to give it a little crust.  The rice wasn't a big hit - but the chicken made up for the rice.  Thanks for the recipe - it was nice to try someething new.

My family loved this dish!  It was super easy to prepare too.  The toasted almonds really add a special touch.  Next time I will add some crushed red pepper for a little heat, and leave out the orange juice to flavor the rice.  We didn't care for that much and ended up adding some chicken base to the water for flavoring anyway so I'll just do that next time.  I used low sugar marmalade and served with fresh broccoli for a delicious meal.  I'll definitely prepare again, even for company.

We didn’t care for this recipe, at all.  I thought it would be more like the Panda Express Aorangi chicken and this one was completely different. We had to toss it out and make something else because we couldn’t tolerate the flavour.

Chicken was great.  I added a tbsp of Dijon with the marmalade to cut the sweetness.  I didn't make the rice only because I had some in the freezer but that part of the recipe sounds good too.  Next time I'm going to make it a bit more figure friendly.  The butter is so good though!
