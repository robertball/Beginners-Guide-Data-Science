I baked mine on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and no problems with a soggy crust. Here's another trick. Add some crushed fennel seed and red pepper flakes to the ground beef when browning. The stromboli will taste like it has Italian sausage but you can have the low fat benefits of extra lean ground beef.

Great recipe my kids loved it. It did get soggy on the bottom but I think thats because I used more than the 1/4cup of pizza sauce. This one will become a regular for us because of how versatile it is.

This was awesome! Very simple and quick. I had pepperoni on hand so I used it instead of defrosting ground beef. I also sauted onions and bellpeppers. The only problem I had was I made the center too thin and so it got a little soggy on bottom. But I will definitely make this again!

This is awesome!!!  I was so excited to eat my leftovers the next day. I added mushrooms, but the recipe would have still been superb without them.  Yummmmmy.  I can't wait to make this again.

We have been making a recipe like this for many years.  I was so happy to see it on here already!  We like to put pepperoni and ham with cheddar and mozzarella cheeses in it.  You could put whatever you like in it (whatever you might like on a pizza).  But we really like those.  Some times we add coconut flakes (which we like to add to our pizzas).  

The kids love to help make it and eat it!

Wow, this was really good, and very easy to make. Per another reviewer's tip, I used parchment paper on the baking sheet, and there was no sogginess. I added onions and mushrooms, and it was a great meal. I don't know about 6 servings, though. My husband and I pretty much polished off the entire thing ourselves. :)

Super easy, fast and delicious. Big hit with my whole family. I used chicken sausage for the filling once, then used spinach and mushroom the next time. Yum!

Great recipe that's quick and easy to prepare, especially if you like Stromboli and from this recipe you can even get creative.

I'll admit I'm not the best cook in the world, but this recipe was so easy and was such a hit. I added chunks of tomato in mine too.

Whole family loved it. Made 2, one for my hubby with sausage, onions, and 2 kinds of cheese, and 1 for kids with pepperoni and the cheeses. I got really frustrated because here i am, an experienced cook, making this "simple" dinner, yet i had alot of trouble stretching out the @#*% dough! Lol i had followed one of the reviewers suggestions and took it out of the fridge before i made it but i guess i left it out a little too long because it was very sticky. The parchment was a brillant suggestion and i also placed a few slices of deli provolone on the dough before the sauce so i think that also help prevent sogginess. My husband works nights and just gobbled up the (hidden!) Leftovers for breakfast,  so definitely a keeper!

Simple, easy, and great for a quick weeknight dinner. My husband and I both ate the whole thing in one sitting haha. My tip would be dont be afraid to add a little extra sauce though becuase we didnt think it had enough and ended up pouring more souce on top of it.

Super great!!! We made ours more like a pizza with pepperoni . The one problem was that i thought the amount of sauce was too little so we added more and it was great. We also added chedder cheese and basted the top with butter!! Will definately do this again!! I wanna try like a barbeque chicken mix inside next time
