I added more veggies and increased the amount of Ranch.  This was good, but not great.  It really needs more spice.

I love this salad!  My son chose to make it for his birthday - when it was 96 degrees and it was wonderful.  He did almost all of the work himself, and added in some green and red peppers for a little extra.  We used frozen peas, and increased the amount of cheese and ranch, which may be the reason some findit bland.  We've already made sure we have the fixings for this on-hand so we can make it anytime!

Good recipe.  If I were to make it again I would definately add to it.  Maybe some more vegetables and other spices.

This was pretty good, but it was kind of bland.  I think it needs more spices, but I'm a pretty new cook, so I don't know what to recommend!

Great quick throw together salad when the weather gets too hot. I did not use canned peas, I used frozen. To make it a little more hearty, I threw in some chopped cherry tomatoes, cucumber and red pepper. Instead of using a mix of ranch and Miracle Whip (which we don't have in the house anyway), I used a mix of ranch and italian dressings.

I added broccoli and peppers and carrots to this otherwise traditional dish. Tasted like I was a kid again, so the name of the salad is perfect.

This was okay.  The ranch dressing got very absorbed into the pasta so it didn't have enough of the Ranch flavour.  I doubt I will make this again.

The kids loved it!  I added 1/2 of a red onion and some cherry tomatoes and it was delish.  I'll make it again - especially in the 110 degree heat that we have!

Super Summer Salad! My hubby isn't fond of ranch dressing but loves this, i added black olives, dill pickles just for something different and of course my hubby didn't like the changes, so I will stick to the original.

The sauce was very heavy.  Next time I would take out the Miracle Whip or perhaps try something lighter than ranch. I would never make this again.

good but not so great ill make it this way every time. definitely an easy side for a hot night but i used frozen peas instead of canned i thought they would be too mushy. i also omitted the ham but added it to the leftovers ( just regular lunchmeat ham) so that my brood could have it for lunch tomorrow.

I changed a few things instead of peas I used Birdseye mixed vegetables. I also used a cup and a half of miracle whip. I also put a little onion powder, garlic powder, celery seed, dill weed, salt and pepper. Blend with whisk until smooth before adding to pasta etc in bowl.

I added jalapeños, green onion and lots of black pepper. Also used 2 packages of frozen peas and extra ranch. Big hit with everyone. I’ll make it again and again.

I used farfalle pasta and fusilli pasta and I thought this turned out well.  It's a little bland...but when you are bringing something to a large company potluck, I like things to be a little bland as it seems to appeal to the masses.  I think I would spice it up a bit if it was just for me.  This kept well as a leftover for several days after the party.  I am definitely keeping this recipe on hand for future gatherings.

I made this  it came out awesome. I did add some pickle relish to the recipe. My mom use to do that. It gave  it a great flavor.   Easy to make and keeps well in the frig.

A good basic recipe.  I added chopped red onions and celery. Instead of canned peas I used frozen peas that I cooked with the pasta for a minute or two.   I will make it again.

We liked this! I wasn't sure about mixing Miracle Whip with ranch dressing (I used the light versions of both), but it was pretty tasty. I didn't really think it needed anything else added either. I would make this again for something different. Thanks for sharing. :)

I've made versions of this salad and this particular recipe is quite good. Rather than all miracle whip I did 1/2 cup miracle and 1/2 cup mayo, as I think they compliment each other well. As a rule of thumb for pasta salad with no onion, I substituted onion powder and just a pinch of garlic powder. Along with this I added a pretty substantial amount of pepper and cheddar cheese. It turned out lovely. Additionally if you cook your ham in a pan prior to putting in the salad to reduce some of the water found in the ham I tend to find it allows for a better flavor and texture!
