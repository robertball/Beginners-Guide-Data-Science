I have been searching for this recipe for years!  My grandma made it for me when I was a child.  It is a mild tasting casserole that is perfect for kids who dicriminating palates nix all veggies except corn!  I added a tsp. of worshshires(sp?) sauce & the cheese on top is really not needed.  Thank you for providing a childhood favorite that my family loved as well!

My husband and I really enjoyed this easy weeknight meal.  A quick throw-together kind of hamburger helperish skillet meal, it was very hearty.  I saw others' comments about the recipe being bland, and I think that is because the recipe is very light on the spices. A "pinch" is not nearly enough of any of the spices. I used a generous 1/2 tsp each of the onion powder, garlic powder and salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.  I also used more evaporated milk than the recpie called for because it was really, really thick.  With extra milk, the consistency was great.  We loved it and I will definitely make this again for a  super-quick and easy weeknight meal.

Oh, so good! Was a big hit in my house but we LOVE cream cheese! My four year old to me I was the "purdiest good cook ever" she ate two bowls of this! Then my 18 mo old had two of her own bowls without the ground beef, she seemed to enjoy it very much.

I've been making my own version of this for years. Thought I would mix it up and try this one. This was not a hit in my house and I will not make it again.

good, quick, easy and I had everything on hand to make it. I enjoyed the mild creamy taste and the pinch of sweetness added with the corn.

This was great, but sat really heavy so I had a lot of leftovers. The ingredients really added up to a good ole comfort food dish, even if it was pretty dense. I like that when it's this tasty. I live alone but failed to cut this recipe so by day 5 of eating this for dinner it seemed a lot less satisfying than when I first made it.

This is an old family recipe. I omit the mozzarella, use cream of chicken soup & I use a pkt of brown gravy mix instead of the spices. I do bake it all in the oven instead of on the stovetop...it's better that way, I think. Not very healthy but it's great for when you are going for comfort food. My grandkids loved this as much as my children used to! I served it w/ a salad & Golden Sweet Cornbread (from this site).

Delish!  I didn't have any cream cheese, and after reading reviews wouldn't have used it anyway.  I used sour cream instead, which gave the sauce FLAVOR and tang!  I loved it.  The kids and hubby all loved it as well.  I will be making this one again- SOON!

VERY Yummy (with modifications). First off, I halved  the recipe since it was huge. Then, I used one large onion chopped (instead of onion powder). I also used 3 large garlic cloves (instead of garlic powder). I used cream of chick soup since that's what I had (instead of cream of mushroom). Finally, I used about 2 Tbls of skim milk (instead of evaporated milk). It was excellent and I'll definitely make this again!

Sorry, but this was really bad.  I even tried to help it along with more spices, a can of green chiles, sour cream, and black beans.  It was still very blah and I can't imagine it as the recipe stands.

My family loved this recipe. Quick and easy - only - add lots of garlic, substitute dried onion flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, 1 small can of green chilis and I added a small jar of pimentos as well. Also used frozen corn and not canned.
This is a yummy family recipe!

Was pretty good.  It didn't look as appealing as I expected it to.  A little dry so i had to add more milk.  But then I didn't add the corn to it so go figure.  Nice taste though.....beef stroganoff.

This was delicious! My whole family loved it. Reminded me almost of a cheesy stroganoff. The only thing I modified was I used less mozzarella. A full 8 oz. pack of shredded cheese seemed like it would be too much.

I thought this was a pretty yummy dish.  I changed it up a little, using what I had on hand - and my family loved it.  I used spaghetti noodles, only 1 lb. of ground beef.  I used way more than a pinch of garlic and onion powder.  You have to or it's too bland.  I added cumin if you can believe it - and that REALLY added a nice flavor.  I skipped the evaporated milk and just used a little whole milk. Added corn and butter peas - really good combo.    I make a stroganoff that is very similar - except I use 8oz sour cream instead of cream cheese and add a packet of French Onion soup mix for a fantastic flavor.  I think I will make those substitutions next time.  But this is a nice base recipe to start from.

Great recipe; however, my changes were:  used ground chicken as we don't eat red meat, added A LOT more spices like garlic salt, onion salt some pepper.  I also used some fresh garlic (you know the kind out of the jar that's already minced, I guess that's not "fresh").  Other than that I kept it the same, I was just concerned about the blandness some people experienced so I upped the spices.  My family loves casseroles and this one is a keeper!  I also chose to bake it instead of serving it right away, so I just poured it all into a casserole dish, topped with mozza cheese and baked for about 15 minutes.  Yum!  Served it with some garlic bread.

Like others said, very bland. I seasoned the meat heavily, so it tasted good, but the sauce is very lacking in flavor. I dumped a bunch of garlic powder and pepper on it, but it still needs more. I don't know what combination of spices would make this good, so I'm just not going to make it again.

Ok;.. So I did have to omit the corn due to us not having any.. but, I went step by step for the rest of it.. and my husband ( who will eat anything) wouldnt eat it.
So, I did this as I love to try new things, and there were some great reviews
But.. Hubby wouldn't eat it, so I will not be making this again...

I make a variation of this recipe that is very similar minus the cheese and cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom soup, because no one in my family likes mushrooms.  We love this casserole and have been making it for years.  It is requested sometimes once a week.

This is a great, quick recipe! My family was a little leery about the cream cheese, but they loved it. For a little TexMex twist, I added a 10 oz. can of chopped chiles in place of the corn, and a small jar of medium salsa in place of the cream of mushroom soup. And I served it with a big basket of tortilla chips for scooping (or in case someone didn't want to dirty a fork.)

Looks like a hit with all five of my kids.  I added the whole onion, too, as well as some onion garlic spice.

this was good, just a little plain.  but i think that's what made it a hit with my kids.  it kind of tasted like hamburger helper beef stroganoff, only better.  :)

This is a wonderful recipe that can be quite versatile.  You can change the vegetable or the type noodle, or even the cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was good but way to thick.  I would make it again but would definitly have to change it somehow.  Not bad though.

I tasted the cream cheese, my wife tasted the hamburger (and wanted it more seasoned).  This seemed to be a great starter recipe.

Very bland, my family wasn't that excited about it, I tried saving it by adding some flavor at the last minute, but that just didn't work.  Good base perhaps to add what your family likes.  Will not be making this again.

I really liked this recipe. It was a quick, easy, and satisfying mid-week meal. It's nothing fancy, but it was really creamy and good. It falls in to my comfort food category. I'll be making this again. Thanks Sheri!

For me this was just food - a bit like hamburger helper.  I did not think it rated anything special - but a good kid dinner - quick and easy - not for company.
