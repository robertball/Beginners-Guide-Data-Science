A good start, but I'd make a few changes, use only 2c swiss cheese, more of the sauce to make it creamier and it needed GARLIC to make it a little tastier.  I will make it again with the above changes.  Also, keep it warm when serving so cheese doesn't set up.

Used imitation crab meat in place of lump. Used baby swiss deli slices (cut finely) along with 1 oz of Mozarrella (cut finely) & some soft Muenster cheese (maybe 1/2 oz or less) (scaled down to two servings. I actually didn't have any milk so I just used a small amount of whipping cream and watered it down a tad. I ended up just mixing the whole thing up instead of layering it. Also added a small amount of finely chopped capers and green olives stuffed with pimentos (no more than 1/4 oz) and a small amount of garlic salt (1/8 tsp approximately). I usually try to make things as called for fot the first time around but since I was out of the milk and didn't quite have enough artichokes I thought what the heck! This dip turned out absolutely fantastic!

This was a great recipe, but the proportions were a little off.  I used only 1 lb. of crabmeat, 1 1/2 lbs. of swiss cheese, and 1 cup of bread crumbs.  Everything else I kept the same.  This made PLENTY of crab dip and everyone loved it.  Will definitely  make again.  Thanks for sharing

This was a lot drier than I expected. It would have been better with a creamer cheese sauce and more sauce.

I love crab and still found this recipe way too fishy for my taste.  My husband wouldn't touch it.  Maybe cut down on the amount of crab in half.  I do plan on making it again with half the amount of crabmeat.
