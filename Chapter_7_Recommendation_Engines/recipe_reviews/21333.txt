These turned out fantastic!  They will curl up as they steam, so for the sake of presentation, you might like to run a wooden skewer through the length of each tail. Other than that, it was lobster perfection in 8 minutes!

Wow! Wow! Wow! What a great recipe. And so simple and quick. I used a whole bottle of Michelob Lite because I did four lobster tailes and added about 1/2 teaspoon of fresh minced garlic. Couldn't believe at how quick this came together. Made a drawn butter with lemon juice and served with a California veggie medley. Going to make this again tonight!

I have never prepared lobster before, was always hesitant. I used two bottles of Bud Light with four tails, which were frozen so we steamed a little longer.  Absolutely wonderful!!  I served them with melted butter and steamed broccoli on the side.  We would do this over and over again.  Even our two year old loved it!

I brought home lobsters for my Valentines last night. The fun part was placing the critters on the floor and watching our four cats reaction to them! The lobsters turned out great and we could definitely taste a hint of beer in the lobster meat along with the several cloves of garlic we also threw in. Absolutely delicious. Thanks Kathleen!

This was fantastic.  I used a dark beer and it had no strong flavor on the lobster.  I also added the crushed garlic in the beer.  It had a wonderful moist flavor in a very short time!
I ate mine with lemon juice and butter.

Marvellous.  Steaming in beer was easy and quick.  It was easy to see when the lobster was cooked. (My steamer pot has a glass lid.)  The beer added subtle flavor that was perfect.

Thanks kathleen for a quick and delicious recipe!Steaming with beer turned out to be the way to go for very moist and favourable lobster tails. With the price of lobster tails you don't want them dried out in the oven or overcooked on the barbque. Great with a hot 
dip of butter,lemon and garlic powder..badaboom,badabing..will make again.

Great recipe as-is.  Used Sam's Adams and there was a wonderful slight beer taste -- and it made the lobster slightly sweet.  Serve with melted butter.  Highly recommend.

My boyfriend and I decided to cook lobster tails  for New Year's Eve.  Only one problem - neither one of us had ever cooked lobster.  I thought this sounded easy enough!  It was AMAZING and couldn't be easier!  didn't have a steam pot so I improvised with my largest saucepan and a roasting rack that happened to fit in the bottom.  We cooke three tails and used one full 12 oz bottle of "Blue Moon."  I thought this beer would work well since it's orange-based.  The result - incredbly flavored lobster tail better than any restaurant!  The only word of caution if you've never cooked lobster tail before, remember to remove the vein that runs down the back of the tail prior to serving - didn't know that!

This is absolutely the easiest way to cook a tasty lobster.  I added 3-4 minced garlic cloves to the beer and steamed them for about 9 and a half minutes.  Watch them though...the key is to NOT overcook them.  Remember, they'll cook a tad more after you remove them from the steamer before you can even get them out of the shell.  I have done them twice and 9 minutes is perfect.

Amazing! I used a citrus IPA beer from a local brewery and added 2 cloves of garlic. The lobster was extremely flavorful and not over powering. I didn't have a steamer, so I put a round baking pan inside of a large deep pot. Worked perfectly, although unconventional. Only took 6 minutes even though the lobster was still slightly frozen.

This has become my go to recipe for making lobster tails. I put a skewer throught the tails to prevent them from curling up and add garlic to the beer when I steam. I make my butter with extra garlic and lemon zest. So easy and very tasty!

This was excellent.  I used Â½ can of Keystone light.  I minced four cloves of garlic and sprinkled some Old Bay into the beer as well.  Steamed for about 9 minutes (I had 8-ounce tails) and the results were fantastic.  The flavor was so good that using butter was superfluous.  Normally I do not care for lobster, but this was incredibly moist, flavorful, tender, and delicious.  I will try this same recipe with crab legs next time.  The wife was dubious as other attempts to make lobster tails for her have fallen short (undercooked/overcooked, off flavors, etc).  Needless the say she was sweetly surprised and very happy with the meal.  I served this with steamed asparagus and a Parmesan potato crusted filet mignon.  Perfect!

The beer changes the flavor a little but it doesn't scream "beer" so don't be afraid to try it.  Easy, delicious!  I used three tails for 8 minutes and it was perfect.

This was so good! Very simple and fast.. i suggest cooking these before you make the rest of your dinner. It gives you time to let the shell cool and then get the meat out of it.

We used a Blue Moon and it was wonderful. We also prepared an Orange Butter Sauce to dip the lobster in (just melted butter with fresh squeezed orange). It was incredibly easy and so delicious! We steamed it for eight minutes and then took the pot off the eye while the steaks finished (approximately 3 mins) and the lobster turned out perfectly cooked.

So easy, and so good. We've always been so-so on lobster, but now that we've found this recipe we'll be making it a whole lot more often. The beer (we used Moosehead) gave a subtle but delicious flavour, and my husband made a butter drizzle by melting butter with some lemon juice, minced garlic, sea salt and chili flakes. Delicious.

I have never made lobster tails before and this turned out very well.  I will definitely do it again.  I had two-4oz tails that were partially frozen.  It took about 13-14 minutes. I used a light beer and added some garlic and there was no beer taste in the lobster.

The last time I tried to cook lobster it was a complete failer. I was really afraid to cook lobster again but with this recipe I have gained my confidence back. The lobster came out perfect. It was so tender and juicy. It came out amazing. I made it as part of my brothers birthday dinner and he loved it. Thank you!

Absolutely amazing!!!!  I used mini lobster tails about 3 ounces each.  I added 24 ounces of Heineken and five cloves of chopped garlic along with Old Bay seasoning.  I brought it to a boil then placed my steamer in the pot and steamed the lobster tails for about 3 1/2 minutes!  I also sautÃ©ed chopped garlic and butter to make a butter sauce!  Definitely a five-star lobster tail!!!

I've used this recipe twice using 4 tails skewered vertically in a tall steamer (layer of beer under the basket) , and both times they have been perfectly cooked and MOIST.  So many recipes seem to dry out this expensive item and that is SO disappointing.  Flavor is good with no strong beer taste...just seems to make them taste more intensely good.  Important to use shortish wooden skewers to keep tails from curling if you care how they look and helps even out the cooking.  I love lobster and this works consistently!

Absoloutely delishous! I have used Bud Light Lime, and Blue Moon.  Both leave a great hint of zest.  This is one of my favorite easy recipes!

This lobster was great, I usually baste it with garlic butter and grill it, but this came out moist. I followed a suggestion and added garlic to the beer. I then served it with grilled steak (marinated in soy sauce, white wine, boysenberry syrup, salt, pepper, garlic, powdered rosemary & onion) and garlic lemon butter.

easy recipe.   I used 1 can for 1 1/4 pounds lobster tail + 1 crushed garlic clove.   It was easy not to overcook them.  They were delicious.

I bought some pre frozen, thawed lobster tails for a seafood dinner night. I used Guinness and unfortunately there was no flavor imparted to the lobster. But, timing was perfect for getting a succulent piece of meat from the tail, yum!

Lobster is my favorite seafood but I have been very disappointed with the restaurants lately. They are not flavorful and over cooked. This was the BEST tasting lobster I have EVER eaten. I will never go to a restaurant for lobster again. I did add a few cloves of garlic to the beer but that was it. Thank you SOOOO much for this recipe!!

Nice recipe, very simple. I made it twice with two kinds of beer, and found the Red Stripe version to be very tasty. One note: the recipe doesn't specify a size of lobster tail. I had to steam my lobster tails quite a bit longer than the recipe states in order to ensure they were cooked.

This is one of the BEST tails recipes I have EVER tried....I also changed it up a bit..dark beer, garlic and finished it up on the grill(due to the size of the tails)  Hats of to Kathleen...thanks for the recipe I will definately use again!

I have always broiled lobster but today I tried this recipe instead and I'm glad I did.  When broiling, it's hard to tell if it is not cooked enough or cooked too much. In the steamer it's easy to check and get it just right.  I think it's a lot juicier this way. This is the only way I'll ever make lobster again.  It's as good and anything you'll get in a restruant.

I had never cooked lobster before, so I wanted a recipe that was really simple.  You don't get much simpler than two ingredients!  I didn't notice the beer taste, and neither did my husband, but we weren't looking for it either.

I always make my loser tails using this recipe. The flavor is perfect! I like the other reviews idea, about using a wooden skewer to keep the shell from curling up. I will definitely try that next time!

I gave five stars not because I loved it but because I liked it better than any other lobster I've had.
I've never been much of a lobster or crab eater.
And I'm not a beer drinker either, so I had no idea which beer to use. 
I used Dos Equis. My first time tasting it ,too. It's a very good beer.
I also added granulated garlic to the beer.
There was a distinctive beer flavor in the lobster.
I would recommend this to any lobster lovers and I may have it again, myself.

This is the first time I have ever cooked lobster anything. I used 4 small-ish rock lobster tails and boiled 1 bottle of Kokanee. I think 10 minutes was a bit too long but I drizzled garlic butter over these in the serving dish and everyone raved about them for Father's Day dinner. Will definitely make these again for special occasions.

These were wonderful!  I used a pale ale beer and added one smashed garlic clove to the beer as it boiled.  Also added a touch of Bay Seasoning to the tails before steaming.  The timing in this recipe is perfect.  The lobster came out so moist and tender.  I can't wait to make this again!

Loved this!!! I changed it up a little. Instead of beer I used sparkling apple cider left over from Christmas. For a dipping sauce I used 1 cube of butter, 1 t. lemon juice, 4 finely minced garlic cloves, 1/2 t. parsley, 1/2 t. dill and simmered until the garlic was soft. It was delicious!!!

YUM! YUM! YUM! I will make this again. I just boiled the lobster in Bud Lite Lime 24oz. because I don't have a proper steamer yet. I kept a close eye on it. I boiled the liquid with minced garlic then put 3 lobster tails in it and lowered the temperature  to just above simmer and covered it. I did check to make sure it was cooked through all the way which was about 13 minutes. The reason it was 13 minutes was because I had froze them after they were caught so they had to thaw out before boiling. They were so tender and delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have never made lobster before and it was great.  I used 12 oz "grass roots' from great lakes brewing company for three tails.  8 minutes was perfect.  I made it for our anniversary dinner with rib eye steaks. Better than going out for dinner!!

I paired these delicious lobster tails with another recipe from this site, "Filet Mignon with Rich Balsamic Glaze."  I was worried that a strong beer flavor would conflict with the richness of the steak glaze, but we actually didn't taste beer in the lobster tails. I added 1 Tbs. of Old Bay Seasoning to the beer. Used at least 16 ounces of beer, because we needed an extra large, deep, frying pan for our four very meaty tails. I didn't measure -- just made sure I had an inch or so of beer in the pan.  The tails fit fine, sort of draped over a vegetable steamer. I cooked them covered for 8 minutes, but they could have used another minute or so of cook time because of their size.  Great, easy recipe. Valentine's Day treat for sure.

This was amazing and soooooo easy!!! I did as other recommending by steaming with garlic ( I used 2 cloves). I served with melted butter, next time I will also serve with lemon wedges.

We loved this recipe!  I fixed it for Valentine's Day with rave reviews.  I used O'Malley's Irish Cream Ale.  I doubled the recipe to have leftovers and used them to make the Seafood Sandwich from this website a few days later.  Yum!

These turned out great, though I couldnt tell there was any beer involved, as far as taste goes it might as well have been water.  But I would definately use this recipe again because they turned out so tender and good.  Good recipe for basic steaming of lobster tails.

Iâm so thrilled to find such an easy recipe for cooking lobster tails! Iâve modified the steaming liquid by adding two teaspoons of garam masala and Iâm using blue moon beer. Iâm serving it with roasted baby potatoes, garlic, pearl onions, and broccoli pieces! Iâll post pictures etc! Yummm!

I used a small amount of white wine instead.  Don't have a steamer so I just put the lobster in the pot shell side down!  I had two 4 ounce tails and steamed them covered, for about 7 minutes.  They did curl up but I had cut them with kitchen shears and loosened the flesh before steaming.  It was pretty easy to crack open the shell where I had cut it.   Delicious!  I was nervous because I had never cooked lobster before.

This was an ok recipe. The beer does give the meat some flavor but be careful what beer you use. Also, donât go by the time stated to steam the tails. Mine took less time. Not sure Iâd use this recipe again. The kids didnât like the taste the beer left on the meat. If they are around next time I wouldnât use the beer.

Honestly, much not different than boiling. Still lobster is great! Steamed in beer and 1 teaspoon minced garlic. Took 8 minutes for lobster to steam. Butterfly split lobster first.

Loved this simple recipe... I used beer and old bay and followed the recipe with 8 minutes for steaming. I made four tails and they were perfect. Moist, tender and juicy! Thanks so much for sharing, it is now my go to recipe for when we do lobster!!!

Steaming was great.  I did it in a rice steamer.  However, the taste of the beer was very subtle - almost too subtle!

Delicious !!! The lobster has to be cleaned first. I did season the lobster to my taste with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Added fresh lemon juice and small amount of melted butter after it was done. I will make this recipe again and again.

Yummy!! An absolute winner. This makes for some tasty lobster. I did add garlic to the beer, based on the reviews of others. It is so full of flavor you don't need any lemon or cocktail sauce (if that's your thing) LOL. 
we will definitely use this recipe again.

Love this recipe! So easy and quick to make. The lobster tails tasted delicious. It was my first time cooking lobster so I was a little hesitant, but it turned out so good! Can't wait to try it again.

Turned out perfectly! I don't have a steamer basket, so I used the more unconventional method of using a stock pot, putting tin foil balls in the bottom and then a heat safe dish on top. You then put the tails in the dish and cover as directed. Because I used this method, I used a whole beer. I made drawn butter with garlic to dip it in. My husband and I both wished we had more!!! Keeper recipe FOR SURE!

This recipe is a keeper! We had Giant North Australian lobster tails, so the flavor of the beer really made it extra tasty. We did add mince two large cloves of garlic into the beer, and because of the size of the lobsters we added a minute to the time, but no more than that! It was delicious!

I dont know if mine were still a lil frosty in the middle but i cooked mine a little longer- about 11 minutes. I took them out after 8 minutes and took them out of their shells, then put them back in the steamer. Wanted to make sure they were cooked all the way, the texture just was a little off.  I didnt have a strong beer flavor, which i guess was nice, but probly could have used water and gotten the same effect. It was good though! Considering it was my first time making lobster tails :)

This was sooo good!!!! My Husband and I made this for our Mother's Day seafood feast. I put 'salt free' Garlic and herb' seasoning on right before steaming and used the same for the melted butter dip. Squirt with lemon, dip in butter and enjoy!!!

Was a great recipe.  I used 12 oz of beer for 4 small lobster tails and added a little old bay seasoning.  They turned out great.

I used Miller Light and added some garlic powder to the beer. I steamed the tail for 8 mins exactly and had pure perfection. I believe cooking with the beer took away any funky fishy flavor that frozen seafood usually has. I like how steaming didn't seem to dry out the tails like the grill does. Wonderful.

Quick and easy and yummy-used dark beer (was all I had) added some garlic to the beer-and did put a skewer in each tail for presentation-worked great-cooked slightly too long- (my 1st time cooking lobster tails) but yummy just the same.

Ugh - we didn't like this at all.  The beer ruined it for us!  For as often as we get to indulge in lobster (maybe once every couple of years), why would you chance it by steaming it in beer?  I wish I thought about that before I made this.  The only reason I'm giving it a two star is because I had a TON of butter to dip it in.

I've made this twice in a month! It's so good and easy. I've used a Sierra Nevada and I tried a Fat Tire Ale with mini slider lobster tails. The Fat Tire seemed to impart more beer flavor, which was awesome! We also used a couple cloves of garlic in the beer.
It cooks amazingly fast, which makes this a truly fast, and delicious recipe!
