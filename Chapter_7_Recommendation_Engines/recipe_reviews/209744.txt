Thanks for the great recipe! I used 1 1/2 cup of pumpkin since I usually add extra to all of my pumpkin cakes. I also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  The texture was not as runny as some of the other reviews indicated. I used a tablespoon melon baller to drop onto a greased cookie sheet and baked for 12 minutes. They were a bit taller than I prefer, but tasted scrumptious! For the filling, I increased the cream cheese to 8oz., used 1 tsp vanilla, reduced powdered sugar to 1 cup, and 6Tbs of butter. I recommend reducing butter to 4 Tbs since the outcome was overly buttery. Be sure to refrigerate for at least an hour before indulging as they filling needs time to meld with the cake.  Overall, these were very yummy and I will make again!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were fantastic.  I made them the day before and covered with plastic wrap, and I think they were even more moist because of this.  Also, I used a shortening-based traditional filling that I found on another whoopie pie recipe here, because I did not have room in my refrigerator to keep these cold overnight, and I was more than happy with the combination.    Also, when I was about half way through, I put the batter in a plastic bag with the tip cut off, and I found that was easier to get them a uniform size.  Although, its no big deal if they are not that uniform - I found that I could put together two that were next to each other, because even though my sizes were varied, they were pretty close if they were next to each other.  (hope that makes sense)  I'm not an experienced baker by any means, and these were very easy for me and made a great impression on my guests.  I will make these again.

I altered the recipe a little: I only used 1/4 cup butter in the cookie dough, 1 cup granulated sugar, 1 1/4 cups pumpkin puree, and pumpkin pie spice instead of ginger.  For the filling, I used 4 Tbsp butter instead of 6.  I'm not sure how they would have turned out if I hadn't cut out some of the butter and sugar, but they turned out delicious the way I made them.  They're best when they've been sitting in the refrigerator for a few hours and the filling has become even creamier.  A great snack for school and work lunches!

Made these because my jelly roll pan has seen better days but I was craving a pumpkin roll.  All in all, they're delicious!    Since there were no reviews I made this exactly as-is.  It was difficult to get the cookies all the same size because the dough/batter is pretty loose.  My first pan turned out much too small.  I did have it figured out toward the end though, and used the entire 13 minute baking time.  The filling is good with the cookie, although it's pretty darn sweet and I would like a bit more cream cheese flavor.  Next time I would use 5oz cream cheese and only 2 tablespoons of butter, and just a little less powdered sugar.  Would have given five stars if it weren't for the super-sweet frosting and also presentation - with this loose dough, forming even circles would be REALLY hard - must've taken many batches to get those perfect cookies in the photo!  I have faith in the AllRecipes readers though - a few tweaks and this is a real winner!

OMG! These are great. Followed the recipe, and they turned out wounderful. I used two tsp. for the batter to make them somewhat uniform.

Great recipe...I brought them to a party and they got rave reviews.  I did make a couple of substitutions:  used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar, added some ground cloves to the mix.  For the icing, as suggested I cut back on the butter and added a little more cream cheese.    I also had trouble getting the batter into circles...I tried 2 methods - free-form on a cookie sheet and a tablespoon or so in a muffin tin.  The cakes rose a little too high in the muffin tin.  I want to try a pastry bag next to try and form them better.

Very good! I had no problem with these turning out well from the very first batch.  I increased the pumpkin to 1 1/2c like others plus I altered the flour to 1c white 1c whole wheat. Pumpkin is hearty and lends itself well to subing white flour with whole wheat. Still very light and fluffy but with a little extra nutrition.  I'm thinking canola oil could be substitued for half the butter in the cookie with good results as well - I'll try that next time. Definitely will add this to my recipe box!

This was a great recipe; make just like the recipe tells you and you'll do fine.  We made for ourselves as well as Christmas treats for the neighbor kids.  It tasted really good.  Wish I had some right now.

scrumptious! Followed recipe except I added ground nutmeg. I made the cookies a little too big so next time I will be sure to make them "mini". Also, the cream cheese filling is super sweet so next time I will cut sugar in half for the cookie. super good cookie!

These were very delicious. The cookies were soft, the filling was creamy. I substituted banana squash for the pumpkin, which is why my pies turned out more yellow than orange. I want to try them again, this time using pumpkin!

These were very good. For the pies I used pumpkin pie spice (two teaspoons) instead of the individual spices. For the sugar, I used 1 cup white, and 1/4 cup brown. The pies were awesome! I used some of the suggestions to make the filling. It was good, but next time I will make more of a marshmallow creme frosting. With a different filling, these would be a 5 star recipe!

Delicious!

Not sure if it makes any difference, but I added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, too. Aslo, I used only 4 tablespoons of butter instead of 6 for the filling and it was fine.

Great recipe, very tasty!  I added some pumpkin pie spice also to the batter.  For the filling I ended up using 8oz of cream cheese, 1/2cup butter and added cinnamon to it.  The cookies were slightly different shapes (I did heaping teaspoons) but easy enough to match up.  My only issue is that they were sticky after cooling so I used powdered sugar on the outside as otherwise I'd have taken a fingerprint out of each one when I filled them.  I would definitely make these again, they were a hit!

I followed the instructions for the cookie with an addition of a dash of nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves.  I was worried the cream cheese frosting would be too sweet so I made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting:  1/2 stick butter, 1 C confectioners' sugar, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp of sour cream, and 1 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese. Very good! It's not too sweet and it really brings out the flavors of the pumpkin.

Moist, not too sweet, delicious!  It is better than Martha Stewart's pumpkin whoopie pie recipe which I have also tried.  I would recommend using a tubing pipe to make even whoopie pies.

Wonderfully delicious!! Such a pleasant surprise-- the cream cheese frosting in the middle-- yum! My only feedback is this:  my cookies are exceptionally moist, so that they stick to the fingers when picking up or eating.. any advice to solve that problem would be appreciated!

Everyone likes these!  I've dropped the dough by spoons and piped them, both ways are good.  I found I got better results when I added flour with the mixer instead of spooning it in at the end.  I've tried various cream cheese frostings, they are all good with this recipe.

This was a delicious recipe! I made them for Christmas and I just know my family with devour them in minutes :D However, I changed the recipe by making the cookies larger and merely putting the icing on top. It saved a lot of time.

I have made these 5 times in the past 2 weeks. EVERYONE loves them.  I too added Nutmeg, it just goes well with the Pumpkin. I also increased my Pumpkin to 1 1/2 c.   its hard to make them small, but I find that everyone is pleased with a slightly larger cookie!!! SUPER YUMMY!!!

veryyy good! i took these to a cookie exchange and won for best cookie :) like others said though, i altered the cream cheese filling by using 8oz of cream cheese, 4 tablespoons of butter 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup of powdered sugar. also i used pumpkin pie spice in the batter in place of the ginger and added just a pinch of ginger. all around though, it was a great recipe!

These were very good. This is a keeper. I made changes per reviews and didn't want to waste anything. I did use a whole can of pumpkin and used pumpkin pie spice. On the filling I used 8 oz of cream cheese 6 tbsp butter and almost 2 c powder sugar.

I brought these to a football party and they were a huge hit.  I actually just thought they were OK, but everyone else went nuts for them.  I changed a few things... I used whole wheat flour, instead of white, I used extra pumpkin and 8 oz of cream cheese.  Next time I will use half all-purpose and half wheat.  I would also add nutmeg and maybe cloves.  I think the spice flavor is what was missing for me.  I'll definitely make them again though with a couple more tweaks.

These were delicious. They were gobbled up right away. I ended up just using 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices. I also used 1 1/2 cups of the pumpkin like suggested. I found it was a little runny and added a bit more flour so that it was scoopable. Very yummy indeed.

Whoopie!  This were the hit of our Thanksgiving dessert table.  Wish I had made more.  They were simple to make.  I made up the cookies the day before and filled the next morning.  My whoopie scooper was too big so next time I will scoop less whoopie to get them more mini.  I did use pumpkin pie spice rather than the individual ginger and cinnamon.  For sure will be making whoopie ((pies)) again and again.

These are really tasty. They are also fairly easy to make. I would have given them 5 stars except they puffed up more than I personally would have liked. Also, in the picture they are nice and orange but mine were not that orange in color. The only change I made to the recipe is I added a few dashes of cloves as recommended in several reviews. I will likely make these again though because they do taste good and they are easy to make.

Made for a party today... really cute. I followed directions exactly. I chilled dough prior to baking and they came out puffy, very moist, and soft. They are quite tasty, but next time I think I'll add either more pumpkin and/or more spices. Not quite pumpkin-y enough for me.

PERFECTION!!!! I only changed things slightly. Only 1 cup of sugar, added an extra 1/4 cup of pumpkin, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. These were gone in less than an hour. Everyone loved them so much! Im planning on making some more very soon.

Delicious!  My kids love them!  These whoopie pies came out very moist and flavorful.  The cream cheese filling is a perfect complement to the cookie.  I did make a few minor changes based on some reviews here.  I added a half teaspoon of ground cloves and nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon and ginger.  I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the cookies.  Instead of canned pumpkin, I used fresh, and added about 1/2 cup additional flour to the dough to make it less soft.  For the filling, I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 8 oz cream cheese, 4 tbsp butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla.  It was perfect:  not too sweet, with a nice tang from the cream cheese.  I made the cookies kind of large, so had far less than 72 to work with.  They were perfectly baked in 10 minutes.  I will certainly make these again!

These were fantastic, as is... And deceptively easy!  The dough is pretty sticky, so I just scooped a small amount out with a spoon for each cookie and slid it off onto the cooke tray, then dabbed at it to get the right shape.  I used a frosting bag for the filling, which I highly recommend.  Next time, I will probably try it for the dough too.  Thanks!

The pumpkin cookies themselves are very cake like and good. The cream cheese filling is to overpowering. If I didn't taste the cookies by themselves I wouldn't know that I even liked them.

So yummy!!!!  These were a huge hit at a dinner party.  I also used 8 oz. of 1/3 less fat cream cheese (you can't taste the difference), and reduced the butter.  The easiest way to get these little guys uniform is my favorite new discovery...zip-top pizza storage bags.  They are triangular shaped, and make great pastry bags.  I get mine at Xmas Tree Shops in packages of 10 for $1.99.  I can't even tell you how many of these I have gone through over the past few months!!

EXCELLENT recipe for whoopie pies, except I did add 1/3 cup extra flour and next time, I'll double the filling recipe.  The whoopie pies I grew up on in PA Dutch country have lots of filling, and I had to spread this kind of thin, and ran out of filling just before I ran out of cookies.  Pumpkin cookie recipe would be great on its own, too.

Outrageous - A MUST TRY - like a holiday lil Debbie, but fresh!  The only thing I changed was that I used all whole wheat flour for the cookie & trust me with all the sugar and butter you couldn't tell at all. They are wonderful!  A holiday treat.

These are not only easy to make, but they are delicious too! They are definitely sweet, but that's what whoopie pies are supposed to be!  They look like they take alot of effort, but they really don't- and this is coming from someone who doesn't bake very much.

These are so cute when finished! And tasty. I followed the recipe for the cookies exactly, but next time I'll definitely substitute some brown sugar for the white. With the filling I only used about 3 tbsp of butter and slightly less sugar than called for. I piped the filling onto the cookies, definitely easier and less messy. In regards to shape I don't think they need to all be perfectly round. My only issue was keeping them the same size. Mine got a little bigger with each batch! Just takes some patience, and they are worth it. YUM

These were delicious, but the filling was WAY TOO sweet! Also, there was a lot of frosting left. So if I make this again, I will cut back on the amount of filling as well as how much sugar I use. The cookies themselves were delicious!

My family went nuts over these! They are so delicious that a single recipe disappeared within 24 hours! I would suggest just one modification...I dropped the dough onto the pans by teaspoons for the first two pans and despite my best efforts the cookies came out of the oven kind of lumpy and oblong shaped. Too weird looking to sandwich together.  So I loaded up the rest of the dough into a frosting bag with a large tip and piped little mounds onto the parchment. They came out of the oven glossy smooth and perfectly round. Used the bag again to pipe on the frosting filling and they looked just like the photograph! Both of my 
non-pumpkin-eater teens said they were the best cookies they had ever tasted!

GREAT recipe.  I followed the recipe as written, and I had no problem making fairly uniform cookies.  (I used a baby spoon to help get the filling out of the measuring spoon, and it worked like a charm.)  I also used parchment paper, and they popped right off.  I would give 5 stars to the cookies.  They were perfect!   My only problem was with the filling.  Flavor was good and well-balanced, but I think it was a little too runny.  Hopefully, some time in the fridge will help solidify it a little bit.  My 3-year-old sampled the first cookie before refrigeration, and she was a mess, but she's also a 3-year-old.  I'll make these again when I am craving pumpkin and have a couple of hours to kill!  Making these took most of two hours with my husband and my 3-year-old assisting.

These are AMAZING...so good.  The cookie is soft and fluffy and the cream cheese filling is perfect for it.  As some others suggested I used a piping bag to make uniform cookies and used 6 oz of cream cheese instead of 4 and 4tblsp of butter.  I just like that extra cream cheese flavour.  Will be bringing these to thanksgiving dinner!

This recipe is fabulous! They were moist and perfect on flavor. The cream cheese filling was sweet, but not too sweet. Didn't change anything in the recipe. These whoopie pies are a new favorite in my home! The kids and hubby loved them.  Thanks for sharing!!!

So yummy and easy!  I use a gallon size baggie with the corner cut out as an easy way to squeeze out perfect dollops every time.  I do the same for the dough AND the filling.  Tidy and very quick!

I made these for our Thanksgiving dessert...they were a huge hit! We had some left over and froze them-The next day we ate them like ice cream sandwiches and they were even better. I took the advice of some other reviews and added cloves and nutmeg and I substituted brown sugar for granulated, and for the filling I used 8 oz cream cheese. I will definitely be making these again!!!

WOW! Amazing! I added 1/2 t nutmeg, used nearly the whole can of pumpkin. For the filling i used 8oz cream cheese and 1 t. vanilla. A cookie scoop works perfect to make the "pies" even. I will for sure make these for xmas!!

These are beyond yummy and they're better with a few hours of refrigeration. I have made these quite a few times in the past week and a half since I first tried them. The demand from friends and family is so heavy, I had to get faster! To step up production of these babies, I fill a large ziplock bag with the batter and pipe the cakes onto the baking sheet. I do the same for the filling, pipe a dollup in the center of one cake and when you cover it with the other it spreads the filling with a perfect slightly rounded puffed finish. No mess, and nice consistency in shape and size is the result with very little fuss!

So good! I made these moonpie sized with maple cream cheese filling (I added both vanilla and a tiny, and I do mean tiny, amount of maple extract). These went fast!

These were pretty tasty but I think I would have liked more of a pumpkin/ cinnamon flavor.  It was also hard to gauge how much icing should go on each one because I ended up having a lot of icing left over.

I didn't check my pantry very well and only had 3/4 cup reg. sugar, so I added brown sugar to total the amt. cld. for.  I also used about 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and ground ginger.  I used a whole can of pumpkin..the regular size, like the soup can size.  For the filling I used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter and about 1 1/4 cup powdered sugar along with the 1 tsp of vanilla.  I had trouble finding the correct scoop size, so the ones that were too big, I simply iced with the filling!  I will be making these for a Halloween party next weekend, and for Thanksgiving, and for....well..you catch my drift!

These were awesome! The only thing I changed is the filling. I mixed 8 oz cream cheese, 8 tb. butter and 2 1/2 Cups powered sugar. It wasn't to sweet and fit the cookie exactly! I've already made these 3 times!

They were great! I changed one thing though. The pumpkin. Instead of pumpkin, I added Apple Butter. It turned out great! I a love this recipe. It's soon to be in my 'written by hand' recipe box.   P.S. When you said 'you wont be able to resist these!', I was like...'Hmm... I bet I could. I only want one little bite.' HA! Was I wrong. This turned out to be one of the very best recipes I have ever tried.

good cookie, and I liked the icing idea. I made the iced pumkin cookies first and since the recipes are similar I used 1 cup of sugar, rather than 1 1/2-glad I did, they were sweet enough this way. Great get ready for fall cookie.

These are good according to hubby and our friend Chris.  I didn't make mine quite as mini and I had the cream cheese icing left over from another recipe I tried, it was the exact same icing.  The pumkin cookie part was almost the same as pumpkin cookies I make in the fall for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

WOW! So delicious! So easy to make despite the the number of ingredients. The only word of caution I have is the cream cheese filling is extremely runny made as is, even after being refrigerated for 3 hours. Next time I make these (and I will!) I will add more confectioners sugar while mixing the filling to stiffen it a bit more.

GREAT little dessert! I used 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of the ginger. And for the frosting, I love a lot of cream cheese, so I used two 8 oz bars of cream cheese, 4 tablespoons butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and then I added the powdered sugar to taste. I maybe added a total of 3/4 or 1 cup. So, MUCH less than what was called for. That would have been really gross.  DELISH! And so cute!

I was so excited to finally try this recipe. I really wanted to like these.  They came out ok, but to hard for me.  I even adjusted baking time but it didn't halpern the.  The filling was good though.  I guess I'll just stick to making pumpkin rolls.

These are amazing, and I don't even care for sweets. Made them for my hubby's office for Thanksgiving, but might have to keep some at home after all. ;)

SO many compliments on these!  My favorite was "10 out of 10"!  The only things I added was just a pinch of ground nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice.  Very yummy!

Try it with sweet potatoes!
This is probably my favorite dessert ever (as well as very popular with all of my roommates).  I make the revised version of the icing, and I actually make them with sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin. I happened to have sweet potatoes around the first time I tried the recipe, and although I keep telling myself I will make the pumpkin version, I can't stop making them with sweet potato, because they are sooo good!  So if you love these cookies but are looking for something a little different, I would recommend substituting sweet potato (either canned or fresh (just cook and peel them if you are not using canned))

This recipe is great and easy to follow. The pies turned out perfectly. I'm not too fond of the flavor of the cookies, but these are perfect for anyone who loves pumpkin!

These were SUPER yummy when fresh, but once I stored them in the refrigerator, the cookie part became slightly soggy.  I'm not sure what I did wrong.

These are so good!  I've made them twice & they went fast both times.  I love spices so I add 1/4 tsp. ground cloves and 1/4 tsp. allspice.  I use an even Tbsp. to measure out the cookies and it makes about 50-55 halves (25 cookies when done).  For the filling I use 6 ounces cream cheese and 3 Tbsp. butter for a nice cream cheese flavor.  I put the frosting in a large plastic bag and pipe it on to the cookies, it makes it really easy & fun to do!  These are great the next day after being refrigerated and the cookie & frosting meld together!

I made these to send to work with my husband. Apparently I am the one one who thought they were too sweet, despite my cutting down on the cream cheese filling. I used my small cookie scoop but didn't get anywhere near 72 cookies like the recipe suggested. One change I mas was  adding some cinnamon to the filling though, and thought that was a nice touch.

First attempt was a bust! but I refused to go down without a fight, so without turning off the oven I tried again. These were so messy and after they came out of the oven I had my doubts. Surprisingly, they turned out fantastic. I think they were in a minute too long as some of the smaller ones started to burn around the edges, but just barely. The biggest tip is to wait until they have cooled completely to frost them. If you don't, you will end up with a runny mess that will stick four or five cookies all together and have frosting running out of the sides or even being sucked into the cookie. Wait until they are cool. Frost them. Put them straight into fridge. Wait a couple of hours until they solidify or freeze them for the next day and allow an hour or two to defrost in fridge. I brought these to my sons wrestling tournament and was surprised to see them disappear.

Very good! The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had to add additional spices to make it taste more like pumpkin. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves. The cookies by themselves were very good! I took the suggestion of others for the cream cheese filling and used 8oz of cream cheese, 4 tbsp of butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup of powdered sugar. The sandwiches were very good after they sat in the frig to set up! Will definitely make these for thanksgiving.

There are great for a bake sale or even for around the house.  The kids loved them and so did the people at the bake sale. I did have too double the recipe and triple the recipe for the filling, because woppie pies are just so much better with a bunch of it.  I had only one dislike because it wasn't chocolate. I say what ever to that comment. I do plan on making it again.

These were insanely delicious!!!  The cookie can be enjoyed without the filling.  I did make changes based on other suggestions... for the filling - used 8 oz Philly neufchatel cheese, 4 tbsp butter, 1.5 tspn vanilla ext, and 1 cup powdered sugar.  Also added just over 1/2 tsp nutmeg and about 1/2 tsp cloves to the cookie batter.

These were fantastic!  My 9 yr old beginner baker whipped them up this afternoon.  The cookies themselves are great, but add the filling and you realize you can eat 6 of them at a time.  I think next time, I will double the recipe and make them bigger,  they are just that good!

Yummy!  I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to make it taste more like pumpkin pie, but other than that I left the recipe unchanged.  My only complaint is that the cream cheese frosting wasn't enough.  I'd recommend maybe even doubling that part of the recipe.  Otherwise, these were a big hit!

My husband doesn't believe in mini cookies, so I made these about 4 times bigger than called for.  As a result I had way too much icing.  The cookies were fantastic, and moist and the icing delicious.  I'm sure I will be asked to make these again!  My cookie connoisseur gave them 5 stars.

These are AMAZING GOOD! I used a small ice cream scoop to get the cookies the same size but was only able to get 56 cookies. Since I wanted more of the cream cheese flavor instead of frosting flavor, I used 8oz cream cheese, 4 TBLS butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup powered sugar.  Used the same scoop to get the perfect amount of filling.  Not enough filling was made! No worries - turns out these cookies ROCK by themselves too!  Ended up with 24 filled and 8 left over - all yummy!

If i could give these 6 stars, i would. i made the cookies exactly as instructed in this recipe. i just used a teaspoon and did my best to plop the dough down in evenly round piles. i just matched them up by shape after they were baked. For the filling, i used 8 oz CC, 4 T butter, and 1 C P. sugar and it was great, not too sweet. i did have to make an extra 1/2 batch of the cookies because it didn't seem to yield as many as i thought. i brought them to a "Pumpkin Party" and they were the biggest hit there. i highly recommend this recipe and will make it again and again.

These tasted awesome. For some reason some turned out flat while others were perfectly rounded - this happened even on the same pan. Don't know why but that didn't affect the taste, just made it harder to put them together.

These DEFINITELY did not come out looking ANYTHING like the picture. Don't let the pretty orange whoopie pies fool you, for what this recipe call for, 1 cup pumpkin, they come out an ugly light brown color & hardly taste of pumpkin. I even added 1 tsp pumpkin spice, and nothing. Definitely needs more pumpkin.

These are very good!  I only gave it four stars because I had to add at least 1 extra cup of sugar to keep the icing filling from being insanely runny.  Also, this is not a traditional fluffy woppie pie filling, although it is very good.  Also, the filling is better to use after it has been refrigerated.  Thank you for a good woppie pie recipe.

A delicious snack/dessert!  I made mine larger (rather than mini), so the recipe yielded about 18 completed pies.  The cakes were moist, soft, and perfectly "pumpkiny".  The filling was creamy and just the right amount of sweet.

Made these as written and they turned out great! I've tried pumpkin cookies in the past and didn't like the texture, but these were really good. The icing might benefit from some tweaking for sweetness/texture based on individual tastes.

Wow, these came out great.  By mistake I used only 1 cup of sugar, but you dont notice a difference.   I cooked them 12 minutes and they came out perfect.  For the frosting I ended up using 2 cups of powder sugar to get the filling I wanted.  Make sure to put them in the frig to "firm" up slightly, then enjoy.  These are great.

Well the flavor was there but the texture was off. My cookies were VERY sticky, to the point where the powdered sugar tip wouldnt work. Next time I will cook even longer, perhaps on higher heat. I used one of the recommendation icings, with more cream cheese. Despite being a sticky mess, they were eaten up in minutes so worth another try.

I made this recipe exactly as is for a Fall Festival at church...both to serve with dinner and larger ones for a cake walk... Everyone raved about them! It's also the best icing I've tasted in a while...not to sweet! Will definitely make again!

I followed this recipe to the "T".  I sampled before adding the cream cheese filling and all I could taste was flour.  Even after adding the filling - there was an aftertaste.  I don't know what went wrong.  I was really looking forward to these :(

Wow, I dont know what happened. I made these and they were pretty good (nothing fabulous) after putting them together. However after the fridge the "cookie" part was sticky like pure dough. No one touched them and i had to throw them all out. Maybe they shouldnt be refrigerated overnight, but its cream cheese so I dont see how else you can do it.

I added extra spices to the cookies and doubled the cream cheese in the filling.  The cookies are very soft.  The filling is delicious.

Very nice! After reading the reviews, I made this recipe with the following changes: halved the sugar in both the cookie and the filling, used 50% more cream cheese in the filling. The results were delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

I made these a few years ago for Thanksgiving and my family raved about them, so for a Halloween party, I said that I would attempt this recipe again. 
I did use vegan butter instead of regular butter (and wasn't exactly precise in my measurements), used a mixture of raw and organic sugar, and didn't have ground ginger on hand, so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. They came out beautifully! I cooked them until the edges were browned slightly, let them cool for a good 30 minutes, and then made them into little sandwiches. They were a huge hit and I'm already planning on making them again for Thanksgiving! A+ recipe and very easy to make.

These were not as good as all the reviews led me to believe! I made them exactly as the recipe indicates and the cookie batter was a sticky mess. It was VERY difficult to even get the batter on the cookie sheet. So I spent about an hour doing that (a mess) and then frosted them with the cream cheese mixture, and was dissapointed that they didn't even taste good :( They were not pumpkin-y enough, and they were overly sweet. Even the next day, they were sticky and dry and really NOT good. I'm not sure where I went wrong where so many others were successful, but I would NOT recommend this recipe!

My sister in law made these for Thanksgiving as a alternative to the usual pumpkin desserts. They were so unbelievably awesome! I may try them as just a cookie with frosting (instead of sandwich style), it will make them last longer!

So good!! The reason for only 4 stars...I added more pumpkin(1/2 cup), nutmeg & cloves (1/4 tsp each) in the cookie batter and in the filling more cream cheese (4 ounces) and I cut the sugar to a cup!  They are delish!

These cookies were moist, fluffy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but would make a few changes next time.  To make them more pumpkiny I would add more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and a little more cream cheese in the filling.

We love whoopie pies and I make them quite often.  This was a nice change, but we still prefer the chocolate version.  In fact, when I told my husband I had made pumpkin whoopie pies, all he heard was whoopie pies and then when he saw their color said “what happened?”  Imagine, my husband doesn’t listen to me. Such a surprise.  But in any event, I thought the pies could have used a little more spice although they had good flavor and were very moist.  Also, I like to overload my whoopie pies with fluffy frosting.  The frosting was good, but I think I would use my regular whoopie pie frosting the next time.

SO GOOD! So easy! My family ate these right up. I used pumpkin puree that I made at home instead of LIBBY'S. I did need to make a little bit more filling, but totally worth it. I would recommend this to anyone!

Really great recipe!  I tasted the batter, and decided to add another 1 tsp cinnamon and about 1/4 tsp fresh grated nutmeg.  I also cut the ginger in half b/c it's a taste I'm not fond of.  I thought the pumpkin flavor came through, but if you use homemade puree, be sure to really strain it to make it more condensed and flavorful b/c it is generally a milder pumpkin taste than canned.  For the filling - I added another 4 oz cream cheese and another cup of powdered sugar. This made it a very cream cheesy taste, which I think the whoopie pie needs, a nice little tang.  These'll go fast!

These were a huge hit with my hubby.  I used a medium sized scoop, which probably produced bigger whoopie pies than called for, but it still worked.  They just had to bake a little longer.  Great way to use up a little extra pumpkin.

These were a little labor intensive, but tasted great!  I'd suggest 2-3x the recipe so you get more at the end of your labor!  I used a damp finger to smooth the tops & sides of the cookies before I baked them.  They're a crowd pleaser!

Yum, this is great!  I added the full can of pumpkin, because I'm nutty and I love pumpkin.  Also, whoever suggested the scoop, genius!  The batter is loose, but the scoop makes them uniform.  I have little domes and they aren't all perfect size, but no one will care that they aren't perfect, they taste amazing!!!!

Made recipe as stated but halved all ingredients.  Had ten pies which was plenty for my family of four.  Great cake recipe.  Filling was ok.  I would prefer a more whipped and fluffy filling for the center.  Will use a different filling next time.

It is unfortunate that this has to be a 4 star recipe. If it weren't for the unnecessary amount of sugar in it, it could easily be six stars. I added an extra 1/2 cup pumpkin, substituted 1/2 cup of white flour for wheat, left out 1/2 cup of the sugar and added an 1/8 of a teaspoon allspice. For the filling I left out 1/2 cup of the sugar, put in less butter and more cream cheese by about a 1-2 TB each and they were still fantastic. I made an extra batch and tossed them in the freezer for yummy snacks!

Five stars because the taste was awesome!  They weren't terribly high though... maybe I should chill the dough?  I also altered the filling:  16oz of Cream Cheese, 1/2C butter, 1T Vanilla, and 2C of Confectioners Sugar.  Because they were flatter and larger I required more filling.

This is an amazing little cake! I made the cake part exactly as in the recipe, except my eggs weren't room temp, but it still turned out fine. SO YUMMY!!! I used a different center filling than shown, but I highly recommend making these!!! I only had to bake them 10 mins because my oven is generally more hot, and they turned out great, none burned :)

These are perfect for any time of the day... they are moist and a little sticky, but that just makes them finger-licking good! Remember to double the recipe for 36 actual sandwiches and not single cookies!   LOVE LOVE LOVE these! =D

These were great added a bit more for the spices and a little bit of nutmeg and allspice.  I also used light cream cheese which worked very well and used half the filling than what it called for as I like just a bit of frosting.  I would definitely make these again.

These were really tasty.  I made mine a bit larger but I didn't cook them any longer.  I subbed sour cream for half the butter and 1/3 less fat cream cheese in the filling and they were so yummy!  They were a bit sticky, is my only complaint but that  didn't stop my family of four from eating them all in a day and a half!  Good stuff!

First time making these. They are great and easy ro make. My 5 yo loved helping. I cut down on the sugar of the dough and filling. I also used less butter in the filling. The only thing I can't figure out is these stay a little gooey on top so when I took the plastic wrap off to serve some of the pie came with it.

This recipe was fantastic. The only teeny tiny adjustments I made were as follows: instead of the ginger, I subbed in a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and I added 1/2 cup MORE pumpkin puree. Delicious recipe. My batter wasn't runny, at all. I used a small melon baller and got perfectly sized pies :)

Awesome!! The cookie itself isn't too sweet, so that with the combo of the filling is great. If only my house could smell the way it did while baking these ALL THE TIME! I read through all the reviews and did a combo of a few suggestions and it worked out perfectly. I up'ed the pumpkin to 1 1/2 c for the cookies. And for the filling the only changes were, I did 8oz of cream cheese and 4 tb of butter. I was very nervous because of all the comments about problems making the cookies even / shaped well etc. My batter wasn't runny at all, maybe bc of the extra pumpkin? I piped it out of a plastic bag. After piping the shape was a little hersey kiss like, so I sprayed my fingers with a bit of pam and smoothed out the cookies. Glad I did because they came out perfectly shaped!  Cannot wait to serve these at my halloween party. Thank you!!!

So far I can only rate the filling. I made another Pumpkin Whoopie Pie recipe and the filling was nasty. I came across this one, and since I already had cookies made, and really liked them, I made this filling. Love it! I read a few not so great review about the cookies so I think I will mix and match if you will. I may try these cookies next time but I will also add cloves.

This year for Thanksgiving I made these for my family along with other delicious goodies and they were delicious.  I followed everything exactly the same except I added the whole can of pumpkin puree.  I also added cinnamon to the frosting and cut the butter down to 4 tbsp.  These have now been requested for Christmas this year. :D Thanks Libby for helping me impress my family.

Pretty tasty.  To solve the issue of uniformity, I just used a cookie scoop and it made them all look nice and round.  They tend to stick because they're so moist so be care when you pack them for storage.

Oustanding!  Easy and delicious recipe!  I didn't change a thing, other than I used my "cookie scoop", which resulted in bigger cookies, although they were at least all the same size/shape.  Wonderful recipe!!!

These were really yummy!!  I'm not even a pumpkin girl, but the rest of the family is, and I can't stay out of them!  I made them as is with one small change - used freshkly grated ginger instead of powder, but I don't think I used enough, as I can't taste the ginger.  Next time I'll either use more fresh, or run to the store for the ground stuff.  I have a cookie scoop which kept the size pretty uniform, and these bake up very puffy and cake-like, sweet and sticky - perfect with a nice, strong cup of hot coffee!  The batter was really loose, but I just popped it in the fridge and they were fine.:)
