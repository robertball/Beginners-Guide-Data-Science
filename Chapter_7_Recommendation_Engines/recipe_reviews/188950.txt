It was good, but I definitely prefer to add polska kielbasa chunks. Made it much better.

I made it but added more spices  because I accidentally put too much of one seasoning. I also added onion powder, garlic powder and some seasoning salt. it came out good and spicy. Next time I'll follow the recipe exact and see how it turns out.
