This is soooo good! Was a hit with my hubby and son. I used fat-free yogurts and lowfat Cool Whip making it even lower in fat....but you couldn't tell that by tasting it!

It's so easy to find the ingredients and to make -- just have a mixer ready.  I took it to a dinner party and it was a hit with everyone! I added a few ground pistachios, to it.

This is a great variation on the more high cal version.  I shared it at work and it was a hit; everyone wanted the recipe.  Besides being delicious, it is easy to mix up.

I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used 2 containers of fat-free vanilla, and used regular instant pistachio pudding mix.  Otherwise, followed the recipe, and this turned out wonderfully!  I've always loved my local deli's pistachio and pineapple salad, but it's so high in fat--and expensive--that it's a rare treat.  Now I can make it myself and enjoy it more often!

What a yummy way to get yogurt, you can't even tell it's in there.  I used the sugar free cool whip too and you can't tell there's no sugar in the pudding.  I gave it to a friend with kids and they loved it, too.  For one of the yogurts I had to use fat free instead of low fat because they didn't have it and it was great! 2011 UPDATE: I used greek plain for the plain yogurt and 1/2 cup drained cottage cheese.  Wonderful!!

This was a delicious addition to our annual St. Patty's day party.  I used only vanilla yogurt since i didn't have any plain.  I keep everything else the same.  It was a great, healthy, sweet treat.  Might add strawberries next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Maybe it was all of the sugar-free/low-fat but this left a very strong unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth.

Good snack.  I had 6 oz containers of yogurt, one vanilla and one plain Greek.  I added a little vanilla extract. Update:  I added one more can of pineapple to this and it was much better.

I don't like sugar-free anything, plus my supermarket didn't have sugar free pudding mix (only regular,) so I made a full-fat, full-sugar version of this. I do not like yogurt but couldn't even tell it was in there. The pudding has such a creamy delicious texture. Next time I might add some more ground pistachios since I really love them, and I found that the pineapple flavor overwhelmed the pistachio a bit. The flavors blend really nicely. The best thing about this is that it's so easy to make. It was a crowd pleaser too.

Delicious, and ready in 5 minutes!  I first had this when a friend brought it over to my Grandma's house, and we all called it "the green stuff" b/c we didn't know what it was!  We still call it that, but I'm so glad I found the recipe so I can make it for myself at home.

Everyone liked this dessert. I used all sugar free stuff and instead of canned pineapple, I used a whole fresh pineapple and all vanilla yogurt b/c I was out of plain. Great for my diabetic dad.

LOVED this fluffy dessert! It is also very forgiving because I took the liberty of using a large can of pineapple, only vanilla yogurt and the whole tub of lite whipped topping. It was amazing! My hubby won't eat anything green, so I may try another pudding flavor next time, but I really enjoyed it. It kept well in the fridge for about five days. Great, easy dessert!

I just made this (in less than 10 minutes) and although there are many versions of this salad out there using pistachio pudding mix (including the side of the pudding box), so far this is my fav! The combo of vanilla and plain yogurt gives this a very savory, creamy flavor and smooth texture and the color is great for christmas! If you use non fat yogurts and cool whip lite you can cut the cals and fat even more!

Very good!  Used nonfat yogurts and fat free Cool Whip as well as the sugar free pudding.  I didn't change anything.  Recipe reads that it serves 6 and it really does.  I divided it up for 3 and it was too much.  I'll make this again.

YUM! I didn't use sugar free, and I added pecans and sprinkled marshmallows on top. It's maybe not as fluffy as what my mom used to make, but it's just as good, and way more healthy.

We love this recipe.  I used 1 fat-free vanilla and 1 strawberry, orange, & banana yogurts with a 8 oz tub of lite cool whip.  I also used sugarfree pudding.  This is awesome!!!

This was excellent!  Instead of crushed pineapple, I added pineapple tidbits (just a personal preference).  I love pineapple, so I think the next time I make this, I will add more pineapple chunks.

OMGosh...this is SO GOOD!!!  I'll take this over icecream any day.  I used all low fat/lite ingredients, including the cool whip.  I'm going to triple the recipe and put it out at my next family gathering!

This was wonderful! My Dad is diabetic and loves pistachio pudding...this was a nice pistachio dessert with a little "kick". I could not find plain yogurt in the store in a small container and did not want to buy a large one and have it go to waste so I substituted two individual Sugar Free Vanilla pudding cups instead (about 3.5 oz each). It came out delicious! Will definitely be making this again and again!

This is very tasty. I like it with just the pudding mix, pineapple and yogurt. If I add whipped topping, I use the Easy Whipped Cream from this site.

Wonderful!  I, too, didn't have plain yogurt, so I used 2 containers of fat-free vanilla, and used regular instant pistachio pudding. Fat-free Cool Whip (whole 8-oz tub) made it even less fattening, and was great!  I did add a bit more pineapple, just as a personal preference.  I think next time I'll add a cup of marshmallows, just for a change.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this, but then I've got a sweet tooth on steroids. It was a little too sweet for some of my family members, but I would make it again in a heartbeat.

I made it as a side dish for a picnic and it didn't go over real well. It tasted great and was healthy, but just doesn't look that appealing. I thought it would be a "salad" but it turned out more pudding than pineapple, so more dessert. I would put more fruit in it next time.

My first time ever making this wonderful pudding.  I Love It.  I researched a recipe for a friend for a gathering in July. I printed this and made it to be sure it was the right one.   It is definitely a keeper that I will do again and again.

Favorite from when I was a little kid and no one makes it anymore.  A little extra pineapple and slivered almonds makes it like the olden days!

Ok 5th time is the charm. How to Macgyver this recipe when your local ghetto fab store has no pistachio pudding and you have a craving for this that won't quit: 1 box vanilla pudding, 1 8oz vanilla yogurt, 1 8 oz pineapple yogurt, 20 oz pineapple with juice (yes, 20 oz),2 tsp almond extract, 1/2 cup sliced almonds. Since there's extract you may like to let it set overnight so the flavors can marry each other. Thanks.

We've made this for years but without any yogurt.  Just 3 ingredients - pistachio pudding mix, thawed cool whip, and crushed pineapple.  Such any easy and quick go-to!  My favorite!
