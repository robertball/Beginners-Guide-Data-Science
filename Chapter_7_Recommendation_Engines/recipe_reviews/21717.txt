This recipe is a 5 Star. I made it in a tube pan, bundt pan just too small. Just a couple of suggestions.  First, next time I will finely dice the apples and mix into the batter and then proceed to use the steusel in layers as directed  I used a combination of lowfat sourcream, yogurt and applesauce.  Excellent results.  Flavor of the coffeecake is also enhanced by lemon or orange zest.  For appearance I made a thin frosting and drizzled on the top.  Not to much, just for effect.  Once you make this recipe you will keep it near by to repeat and repeat.  Thanks Kris!

This cake was wonderful--it baked up very nicely and didn't fall apart when removed from the pan.  I would probably cover the "top" with foil for the last 15 min. of baking time, though, as the streusal got a bit crunchy.

This is a very goos cake and was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone at a recent Spring brucnh.  I will warn the future bakers with a few tips:
1) This takes at least 60 minutes, if not more.  I think I wound up cooking it for almost 70 minutes because the apple section seemed gummy when I first turned the cake out of the pan.  I wound up putting it back in the pan (no major feat!) and putting it back in the oven after it had cooled for the 15 minutes.
2) Put a cookie sheat under the bundt pan in the oven because the batter JUST fits and you might get a tiny spill.
I am sure you could also do this with muffins, but the layering in each muffin cup might take time.

AWESOME. I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any yogurt, so I substituted sour cream and a little applesauce to total 16 oz. Worked great.

This was excellent! Way better than store bought. It tastes like there's apple pie filling in the middle. I used margarine because that's what I had on hand. I also used two 9x5 loaf tins because I don't have a bundt pan and baked for an hour. I found the walnuts slightly bitter so next time I'll use pecans.

This came out so good. I brought it to a party and everyone went crazy over it.  I melted caramel and drizzled it over the top.  I also put foil over it at the last 15 minutes just so the streusel stayed really moist.  The yogurt was really good in it.  I think I might try sour cream next time.  But it was awesome!!

This was fantastic. A food proccessor makes the job of making the crumb mixture extremely fast and easy. The only problem I had was I think there was too much batter. My coffee cake filled the bundt pan right to the top and then some of the filling oozed out and didn't smell to pretty on the bottom of the stove. Also, after I had mixed the flour mixture in, I realized I had only used had used 12 ounces of yogurt (2 6 oz containers...i thought they were 8 oz each). So I added a little sour cream and made sure to mix really well. It turned out awesome!

Absolutely incredible!  This cake is always a winner at parties: it's very moist and sweet.  I like to use Stoneyfield nonfat organic yogourt to keep calories down.  Also, if the cake is left to sit for a few hours after baked, it tastes even more flavorful.

THE BEST coffee cake that I've ever had.  I will definitely be making it again. Because I'm nuts over apples, I will probably add a second layer next time.  You owe it to yourself to make it.  When it is baking, place the pan on top of a cookie sheet to protect against possible drippage.

I've made this recipe several times already, and I can't believe I haven't written a review.  When I don't have yogurt, I use an equal amount of sour cream without any diffference in texture or taste.  I've found the best layering method for me is to first place some brown sugar/flour mixture on the batter followed by finely diced apples.  I then dot the apples with chilled butter and then top the butter with more brown sugar/flour.  I cover this streusel layer with batter then repeat.  I always seem to have extra streusel when I follow this recipe so I usually cut the streusel ingredients to about 75% of what the recipe says.

really good, my hubby sat down with the cake plate and a fork and polished about a quarter of it before I stopped him.  I made it in a tube pan and baked  it for 70 minutes, used french vanilla yogourt and only made half the streudel. and it was great.

FYI, don't freeze the butter. That's too chilled. Just fridge-ready butter is sufficient. I've tried making crumb mixture both ways, and it's much easier to stab the pieces into crumb size with a pastry blender if the butter is cold but NOT rock-hard. I baked mine for 70 minutes, and it was the perfect amount of baking. I had to add more liquid to this recipe to make the cake part be runny enough to not worry me. (I used skim milk as my liquid, FYI, probably a half-cup, I eyeballed and added and stirred and repeated until it looked how I wanted.) I don't know if that step was necessary, but I loved the texture in the end product, so it certainly didn't hurt. The only thing I would do different is to add a pinch of salt in the streusel and 1/4 tsp of it in the cake part to liven up the flavors. Sugar without salt is a little flat, and while this cake is quite good, I do think the salt would make a significant step towards perfection; I wish I had thought to try it, but didn't realize til I tasted it that it was missing anything. This cake makes a beautiful company-worthy presentation, and is easily 5 stars in flavor (even without the salt!) Thank you for your recipe, I don't think I'm even going to share this one with DH's coworkers this time :=)

This one gets 4 stars because it completely fell apart on me when trying to invert the bundt pan. Also I had to change the yogurt over to 16oz sour cream (I just don't keep yogurt on hand) and I omitted the nuts (personal preference) but other than that it DID taste AMAZING!! It was perfectly moist and not the slightest bit runny. I only needed to bake it for about an hour, then I turned off the oven and let it sit for about 30-45 minutes. I will be making this again but next time I will NOT use a bundt pan, I'll just simply layer it in a 9x13 casserole dish and just cut it into squares and serve it straight out of that. I should note that I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the batter when mixing. Very yummy!!

great recipe.I used one cup of whole wheat flour and two cups of white with no taste change. I also used my apple corer to core and slice my apples to save time.

It is very good.  Nice and moist w/ good flavor.  It did fill my bundt pan to the brim but did not overflow during baking...it rose just a little over the edge.  I used the full amount of streusel and it was a good amount, but I think anything less than 3/4 would be too little.  Mine took exactly 60 min to bake.

I have made this cake 3 times and it is without a doubt WONDERFUL !! To add an extra flavor boost I added the grated rind of a lemon to the batter and used double the apples.  Rather than one layer, I made two and added apples to the top and covered with streusel.  The result is absolutely magnificent!!! As other reviewers have commented, the baking time,however, should definately be increased another 10 minutes or so. Enjoy!!

I made this cake this afternoon. It was relatively easy to put together. The problem is the pan size. DO NOT use a regular size Bundt pan. It is much too small. I have coffecake all over the cookiesheet I baked the cake on. I would say that I lost at least 3 pieces of cake to spill over. My kids ate the "drippings" and loved them. I wouldn't recommmend a Bundt pan at all. Go for a large square pan, to assist cooking in the middle and clean up issues.

Delicious, moist, flavorful cake for breakfast and/or desert.  Changes made:  1) added 1 teaspoon cardamon and 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg to the cake batter; 2) used 16 oz container lowfat sour cream instead of the yogurt; 3) used 3 diced granny smith instead of 2; 4) added 3/4 of the apples to the middle, as directed, and the remaining on top, before the streusel mixture, pressed into the batter.  All raved about the cake and asked that I make it again:)

This recipe is a definite keeper. Everyone who tried it came back for more. I plan on making this again just to share with coworkers. I ended up using pecans because I was out of walnuts. I was a little nervous about this spilling over. My Bundt pan was very, VERY full. I placed the pan on a large 1/2 sheet pan in the oven. Somehow it did not bake over. The streusel on the top (bottom) did get a bit crunchy, but did not burn. This only served to add texture to an already delicious cake. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Nice recipe! My husband loves apples, so he dove into it when it was right out of the oven. It was so good; the filling when warm tastes just like apple pie. Next time I'll make sure the filling is completely enclosed in the batter. I had some of the apple filling along the edge, and it stuck in the pan even though I had greased and floured it. This coffeecake has a great flavor. I brought it to my office and got several compliments on it. I'll definitely make this one again. I wouldn't skimp on the streusel - it's the best part, and although this recipe fills the pan completely, I had no problems with it overflowing.

I tried it with the apples and it seemed soggy to me so I made it without and it's excellent! I omitted walnuts and substituted sour cream for yogurt.

Really good!  I made this in a tube pan and used 2 layers of apple and streusel.  The batter filled the pan nicely and it didn't overflow.  There was extra streusel, but since I used a tube pan, I just added the extra on top.  Using a bundt pan would have left too much streusel on the bottom when it was flipped over.  Mine was done in 60 minutes.

Delicious coffeecake! I used this recipe to fill two 9x5 loaf pans. Like other reviewers I ended up with so much streusel topping and apples left over that I made another 1/2 recipe of cake batter and used it all to fill a third 9x5! I baked these for about 65 minutes... they needed the extra time. Definitely will make this again -everyone raved!

I loved this recipe!  I used a large tube pan instead of a bundt pan and had no trouble with the amount of batter.  I also substituted sour cream for the yogurt.  I did have to increase the baking time too.

This recipes was a huge hit!  I sliced it up for a Sunday brunch and brought half of it - it was gone in no time!  I brought the rest to work the next day and it was gone in 20 minutes!  The yogurt made it moist and the apples and brown sugar gave it the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

This cake turned out great the first time I made it!  The apples in the middle were soft and warm, giving the cake a great flavor.  It is also a very moist cake, best if eaten while warm.

This is tasty, but quite a bit of work - particularly if you do the streusel by hand, as I did. I used four apples (could have used even more), and half the streusel, which was enough. Thought it was a bit on the dry side; the batter could have used some extra milk/liquid.

Wonderful coffeecake!  I used sour cream because I didn't have any yogurt - but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I would make next time is to cook the apples a little before I put them in the batter to soften them up a bit (I prefer the apples to be cooked through). I had two very large granny smith apples and they were still a little crispy by the time the cake was done - so I probably had too much apple for the batter.  I took this coffeecake to a church gathering yesterday and it was gone very quickly.  Thanks for sharing Kris!  I'll definitely make this coffeecake again.

Very good.  Followed the recipe very closely except we added another stick of butter for the streusel.  Very interesting coffeecake.  We are enjoying this.

i did not care for this. After nearly 90 minutes i took it out (after putting some parchement on the top to keep it from burning.) It tasted bad and part of it still wasn't done.

Amazing!!! I used pecans instead of walnuts and also used 8oz of sour cream and 8oz of apple butter instead of the yogurt. I also made mine in 2 loaf pans and baked for about an hour and it was delicious!!

Absolutely gorgous! Thanks for this recepie. I was looking for a traditional german recepie for blueberry streusel kuchen, as we picked wild blueberries. In germany these are made with a yeast dough but his cake looked great and had great reviews (it is also easier not to use yeast). I added 150 mls of milk to 300 mls of full fat yogurt as this was what I had. I also made the batter with half wholemeal self raising flour and half white self raising (preference), so ommitted the raising ingredients.  I substituted blueberries for the apples, enough to cover the cake in a thick layer and used less sugar for the topping and added a few oats along with the nuts (approx 30 g) Just as well it is a large recepie. Delicious!

Very tasty.  But batter was so think that it was difficult to work with -- particularly spreading the second half of the batter over the apples.  Also, I prefer my coffeecake to be a bit less like cake and have more of a crumb to it.

This was OK.  A little too dense and not enough flavor. 

I definitely would make again, but I would add more apple/streusal layers in between the dense cake.  Just a little too heavy for my liking.

I tried this recipe today, as I was looking for something unique. Fabulous! At first, I was worried about the topping and overflowing the bundt cake, but it came out perfectly. I used cooking spray and flour to prepare the bundt cake.  As another reviewer suggested, I added applesauce to make it extra-moist.  Will make this again. I only got to taste a small slice, so will have to make a double batch next time. Thanks for sharing.

I liked the cake part of this coffee cake, but I would cut the streusel in half and probably the apples as well.  It was mushy in the middle and I don't think it was undercooked, since the cake part was fine.  Even when I was making it I thought there was a lot of streusel - half is plenty.

usually get my dessert recipies from Bon Appetit.  This was great. Made for a group of talented cooks and bakers and they all loved it.  Read other reviews first and did bake for 70 mins. and it needed the cookie sheet underneath.  A keeper.

This recipe was excellent, the yogurt in the mix along with 3 eggs made the cake moist and light.Instead of using all the butter called for I used half apple sauce/half butter in the streusel and batter and it turned out great. I also used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 all purpose.I found the cake a little too sweet for my taste, and used 1 1/4 C but next time would use 1 C in the batter. I baked it in a 9x13 pan sprayed with Pam, it baked in about 45 minutes and tasted great. Two layers of batter 2 layers of streusel on top. Yummy!

This absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe as written, but my batter was REALLY thick.  I don't know what I did, so I add 2  small individual cinnamon applesauce containers that I happened to have, that loosed the batter enough that I could somewhat pour  (scrape) it into the bundt pan.  I used 1/2 can apple pie filling instead of slicing apples.  It did bake for a little over an hour.  It did bake to the very top of my bundt pan but it didn't go over, I also covered it the last 25 minutes with foil as others suggested.  This takes a few minutes to put together but it may be one of the best things I have ever baked! It is delicious!

Great cake!!    I made 2 levels of apple/struesel mix.  Cake part was delicious!  My family loved it even my sister who was skeptical because she doesn't like apples in her baked goods usually.  It did fill the pan and I baked it for 60 minutes.  I under cooked it so I had to cut it into pieces and bake some more but after that it was awesome!  It is hard to tell when a bunt cake is done.  It felt done and the toothpick came out clean but it was not cooked all the way through so just watch that.

WOW!  I'm glad I took the time to make this fabulous coffeecake.  It reminds me of the kuchen you can get in Germany.  Very moist.  The whole family loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly--no changes, no substitutions.  Well worth the little bit of time I spent.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is to add a bit more apples and not dice them so much but rather leave them more like an apple pie filling. Hint: do not use overly ripe apples as it takes away from the actual apple flavor.

Great cake. I have been making it for about 1 year now and never had a failure. I add some berries as well for that bit of tang. Nothing else is changed. I do ignore the listed cooking temps and times as I know my oven and the type of cake this makes, so can't comment on that side of the process. Fabulously moist and keeps for ages.

My husband LOVED this coffee cake!  It was the best he's ever had.  I did use a bundt pan and it came out looking lovely.  The layer of apples made it look like it was more work than it was. 
I'll definitely make this again.

Wonderful results!!! Made this recipe with pecans and used pink lady apples. I also made half of the streusel - just the right amount, I think. Had no troubles fitting all of the batter into my bundt pan. It baked up perfectly! And freezes well for later use.

This was absolutely wonderful! Both my husband and I ate it warm from the oven and it can't get any better than that. It's only flaw is that it is just to sweet for me to justify eating for breakfast. We ate it as dessert after dinner. Will probably make as a dessert for a family gathering sometime, but I'll scratch it off my breakfast recipe list.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch, and it was a huge hit. My husband ate the leftover cake after everyone had gone home.  A few things, though, the bundt pan was almost overflowing, and if you follow the recipe exactly, there ends up being a ton of streusal on the bottom once you flip the cake over.  VERY tasty and moist though!

This is SOOOO delish and SOOOO bad for you!!! I loved everything about it except for the fact that the cake lacked a little bit on the moisture and sweetness catagories. SO yummy though!

This one's a keeper my husband loved it. I made 8 mini loaves and 1 small cake with 1 batch. The only mod I did was doubling  the streusel.

I baked this in a large spring form pan, nearly an hour and a half later it’s still RAW in the middle. Taste is ok but this could have made 2 smaller cakes easily. Not sure if I will attempt again, batter was very thick and needed more apples.

I used three nonfat Greek yogurt cups and three apples. The cake turned out perfect! When I make it again, I will put the streusel in the bundt pan first, followed by batter, apple filling, streusel and rest ofthe batter. Excellent coffee cake. Delicious and moist on day two as well.  It won't make it to day three!

Wonderfully moist cake. I mixed the apples in to the batter was my only change. I had extra batter and put in  a small cake pan with the stresel on top. Everyone loved . I used cortland apples, Ceylon cinnamon.

Delicious!  It came out of the pan very easily.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used Greek vanilla yogurt and it was really good.

Big hit! I put some apple slices, white sugar and cinnamon in the bottom of the bundt pan so when you turned it over it had a little decoration on it. Also the second time I made it I used a little less batter it before adding the first layer of strudel and apples. The first time, the strudel apple layer was too close to the bottom layer that has more strudel, which left a lot of cake without any "spice."

Great recipe! I used a regular cake pan, not a bundt pan. Also, I used egg substitute and vanilla yogurt (instead of plain and left out the vanilla extract). Baked for 45 minutes at 350 and 25 minutes at 325.

This is the first time I tried making a cake like this from scratch and I love how it turned out. I took it to work and everyone gobbled it up. It is definitely a keeper. I left out the nuts because I knew someone was allergic. I also made a bit of frosting to dribble on it.

An excellent dessert or for coffee time.Ireduced the brown sugar by1/3 and replaced it with brown sugar substitute.Granny Smith wasn't there today so I used Macs.A little too moist for the bottom layer. For best time use I suggest prepping your apples and the streusel mix ahead of time.Took me longer than 30min. to do for the first time.An excellent choice for a winter's day. I will make again.

Not only was this the best coffee cake I've made, but the best I've tasted!  What a wonderful recipe!  I love all the streusel!  Usually, I end up straying from recipes a bit, but this one's perfect just as it is.  After reading some of the reviews I was a bit worried, but I had no trouble with getting it all to fit into my bundt, as others did. Thanks so much for sharing!

good.  some loved it (adults)and some thought it was just ok (kids).  didn't earn 5 stars in my book.  perhaps it wasn't as appealing to kids as a 9x13-less-cakey-more-sweet-stuff type of coffee cake.

This was pretty good!  I really enjoyed it.  I planned on making the cake myself, however, I ran out of time and assigned the job to my mother who was visiting us.  She followed the recipe exactly and used the proper pan that it called for.  But there was so much batter.  She filled the pan as much as she could to allow for expansion as it baked and she still had batter left over. And even with the room she allowed for in the pan, it still  overflowed as it baked.  Therefore, we had a rather messy looking cake...but it tasted delish! I'll give this one another try on my own just because it did taste so good.  Made the house smell great on a cold fall day too!
