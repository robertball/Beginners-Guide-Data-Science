Great smoothie! I didn't have vanilla soy milk on hand so I used I improvised and used milk with a splash of vanilla extract.  I love incorporating wheat germ whenever I can and used a combination of frozen blueberries and strawberries. Overall, "berry good!".

I didn't have wheat germ, but used flax seed instead and added a few ice cubes.  I used frozen blueberries and strawberries for the fruit and it was excellent!

I have made many smoothies, though this one was the best I have ever tasted.  Usually my husband doesn't like the smoothies I make though this one he said was the greatest!  I will definately make this smoothie again. I did add banana and put 1 cup of blueberries and one cup of strawberries.

This is the third smoothie I've ever tried and I think it's the best one.  I loved it.  I even made it again but with a slight switch in ingredients.  Instead of 2 cups of mixed berries, I put  1 cup of strawberries and 1 cup of peaches.  We loved it and I think when I try this again I will add a banana to the strawberry/peach mix.  Thanks!

My kids and I made this and just couldn't get past the taste of the wheat germ. It added a somewhat bitter aftertaste that we didn't care for.

I tried this recipe and loved it! I changed it up a couple of times, once I used frozen mixed fruit and added a fresh banana, WOW!!! You can't even tell that it is healthy and this smoothie can replace breakfast anytime.

i taught a class on healthy smoothies and had the kids make 3 separate recipes and pick their fave. this is the one they picked. we used lite OJ just to cut down the sugar. i tried it again at home using some frozen mango and added a little non fat plain yogurt and it was awesome!!

Good, just wanted to note that wheat germ doesn't have a bitter aftertaste, it has a nutty sweet taste. If it tastes at all bitter that means it's gone rancid. Hope that helps anyone.

YUM. I did not have vanilla soy milk so I used regular milk in it's place with a half teaspoon of vanilla extract. I threw in a couple pieces of chunked frozen banana to thicken it up just a bit and to add extra fruit. This was so good.

I used blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. Instead of wheat germ I used flax seed oil, and I substituted rice milk for soy milk. It was amazing!

This smoothie was very good. The wheat germ gives a nice texture. I also added 1/2 scoop of protein supplement strawberry flavor.

It bit me back ( a bit tart), so I added some sugar to taste, which made some improvement.

This was pretty good but it was way too thick. Next time I will only use 1 cup of berries.

Yummy!!!At first I didnt like the texture of it-too paste looking for my like of smoothie...I only used 1 cup of mixed berries-even that was too thick so I had added alittle bit of water ...I like my smoothie alittle runny not thick...so instead of 1/2 milk  next time i will try 3/4 cup of milk-maybe that will be better.I love the color of it as well..I didnt have oj so I used peach juice-this is definately a keeper...When I run out of my diet powder drinks I will for sure be replacing this...Cant wait til my kids try it out...

I used mostly blueberries & strawberries, but also tossed in a bit of blackberry.  I do not use soy milk, so like others I added a bit of vanilla into my 1% milk.  I'd say the biggest problem I had with it, is that even though I used frozen fruit, it just wasn't cold, and non-cold smoothies don't much appeal to me.  I did try adding ice but it seemed to water it down too much.  It was OK, but in the end, I have other ones that I like better.
