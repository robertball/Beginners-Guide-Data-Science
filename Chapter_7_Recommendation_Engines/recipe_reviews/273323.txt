The flavor was good, but we didn't like the skin on the top.

I will never use a boxed chocolate pudding mix again.  This is so easy.   I did substitute one cup of heavy cream for a cup of milk.  That worked very well.

7.28.19  This doesn’t take any more time than mixing up a box of pudding with ingredients always in the pantry, but the consistency and taste is just so much better.  Only suggestion would  be to use a good-quality cocoa because that’s what you’re really going to taste here.  Silky, creamy smooth, rich even made with skim milk (what was on hand). Just not quite as thick as I'd have liked, so I'll add a bit more cornstarch the next time.  Thanks for sharing your nana’s recipe.
