Ok, my thoughts: 1) Ketchup? Sounded gross but turned out to be a nice addition to the flavor. 2) Needed more honey for my taste, but that's personal preferrence. 3) Sesame oil: you don't need it if you don't have it, but what starts out as overpowering really mellows and adds to the flavor as you cook it. I didn't have fresh ginger so I added ground ginger to the sauce. I added different veggies (see my photos) but you really can throw in anything you like. For prepping, rather than stir fry the veggies, then add the sauce and shrimp and let everything get soggy while trying to cook the shrimp, I did the following: make the sauce to taste earlier in the day. (Flavors get better the longer they sit). I only used 1.5 tsp corn starch, which gave the perfect thickness to the sauce. Toss the shrimp in to marinate. If it's not cooked, cook it, then toss it in. Later, as you are stir frying your veggies, re-heat the sauce/shrimp separately. When the veggies are done (about 5 minutes) toss in the shrimp/sauce mixture, quickly stir and put into bowls. This keeps the veggies from boiling in the sauce and getting soggy. I had already cooked brown rice and just added the stir fry to that. IMHO, the amount of liquid from the recipe was perfect for 2. I would make more if you have more than 2-3 people. Overall a very good dish and I would certainly make it again. Thanks Coastiewife!

5 outta 5... in love with this recipe, made it 5 times with different veggies. OMG who knew ginger could change a dish. Starting, flavoring the oil (Olive Oil) with the ginger and garlic, the smell just envelops the dish. Double thumbs up, everyone in the house thinkin i own Panda Express,lol. OMG 2x, the sauce! i always wondered how to make a sauce thick, and i nail'd it on my seconded try(Holy Moly, Corn Starch!!!)!..... PROUD BEGINNER, cooking is very fun=) thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty and easy. I used a full pound of raw shrimp instead of cooked for more flavor and followed the recipe exactly. I think using cooked shrimp would result in overcooked shrimp at the end. Unlike some of the comments, I could not taste the ketchup specifically at all and when I asked my husband what the sauce tasted like, he couldn't identify it either and was surprised when I told him.

Made this with a bag of spring veggies instead of chopping a bunch, plus added a can of water chestnuts & baby corn. Didn't have any sesame oil so I skipped that but it still turned out amazing!!

I substituted the Catsup with Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce to make it a little spicier and used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies because I didn't have fresh on hand. It was quite tasty. Next time I will use fresh veggies.

We like more sauce for the rice so I tripled the sauce and added hot chili pepper sauce instead of red flakes. I might add even more next time for a little more heat.

Will definitely make again.  I thought it was good.  Did not have pepper flakes, so I used cayenne pepper.  Will either buy pepper flakes or add more cayenne next time.

As promised, this was done in 45 min ( including prep) and easy.  The pepper flakes gave it a nice bite as well. Pre-cooked shrimp, while convenient, just doesn't have much flavor, so drags this down a bit.  No fault of the recipe, just a case of taste vs. speed & convenience.

This was such a great meal!  I switched out a few vegetables for what I had on hand, but it didn't change the flavor.  I think it is the sauce that totally makes this meal!!

Just ok, seemed bland. I added spinach, mini corn, bean sprouts, water chestnuts but still something seemed lacking.

I adjusted a little.  Used a whole onion, skipped one of the yellow zuc, used a whole package of mushrooms, a pound of shrimp and added a turkey sausage.  Made brown rice to go with the dinner. It was very good and easy to make.  Maybe next time will replace the  ketchup with sirachi sauce for a little kick.

The sauce is delicious! You can use whatever veggies you want.  Just an FYI, if you use more veggies than the recipe calls for, increase the amount of oil and sauce.

I followed recipe except I used fresh shrimp and omitted peanut oil, since I didn't have any. This is definitely a keeper. It was tasty and easy.

I needed a sauce recipe, so I pretty much just used that part of the recipe. It was delicious, though.

Ok, just not much flavor. I used fresh shrimp and added fried wonton strips on top for crunch.

I made this just for myself, so I scaled it down to two servings. If doing that again, I would keep the sauce amounts as originally stated, because I would have liked it 'saucier'. After the frozen salad shrimp I used were thawed, I added them to the sauce and set aside. I first sauteed the onion, and also added chopped celery and carrots, and then added the zucchini. After a few min, I added broccoli flowerettes and let it cook a bit. I had a box of frozen snap peas that I microwaved and added last, as they were soft already. Then I added the shrimp that was in the sauce a bit and just cooked until heated. I had with some sweet chile sauce and brown rice. Very good - thanks!

Used frozen stir-fry veggies and frozen cooked shrimp, just thawed the shrimp out and coated it with sauce before cooking.  I used fresh mushrooms.  When I tasted the sauce as-is before cooking, it was bland and needed more punch.  So I added sweet chili sauce, some peanut butter, and doubled the recipe (need enough sauce for rice!)  I also added cilantro, green onions and sesame seeds to the mix when it finished cooking; I basically turned into a pseudo-Thai stir fry.  That definitely gave it more flavor!   Hubby and I really enjoyed it, and he requested more peanut butter in the sauce and even some peanuts for crunch.

I did not care for this recipe. I could't get past the ketchup flavor. I should have trusted my gut and not tried it in the first place. My kids liked it though.
