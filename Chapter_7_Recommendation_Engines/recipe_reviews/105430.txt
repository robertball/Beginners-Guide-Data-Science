If you want this more flavorful, marinate the pork first with rice wine, white pepper, corn starch and tiny bit of soy sauce. You can also combine sweet bean sauce with spicy bean sauce.

I really enjoyed the simplicity of this dish.  I couldn't find spicy bean sauce, so I used garlic bean sauce and lots of crushed red pepper.

I've modified this dish to make a MaPau Pork/Tofu dish which I loved from restaurants in Singapore. Came out well. Doubled quantity of black bean sauce, used beer instead of sherry, added an equal amount of Japanese Rice Wine, used one regular minced onion, some mushrooms and voila! It was awesome.

My husband and I went very impressed by this dish.  It did not taste bad but there wasn't   anything in it to really make it stand out.  My husband added some chinese five spice to his portion and he said it helped.  We won't make this recipe agian mainly  because we like our food to be very falvorful and this just wasn't there.

Not bad with the black bean sauce. This was similar to the Ma Po Dofu that my mom used to make - a favourite of my brother's! Instead of black bean, we always used spicy red chili garlic paste, and garnished with chinese parsley. Cilantro, for all you non-asians!. SERIOUS heat - serve it with lots of steamed rice.

4.21.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/105430/chinese-style-ground-pork-and-tofu/ ... This was good.  I had to do a little substituting.  Used garlic chile sauce for the black bean sauce.  I also added a half teaspoon cornstarch to help the sauce "stick".  I didn't have green onions so just used regular onions & sauteed them with the garlic.  Green would have been better.  Needs more veggies than just that, too.  The sauce was really good, but not nearly as good the next day.  Eat more the first day or make more/fresh sauce the next.  :)  Tried with reduced fat pork & it was a good choice. Notes4Me: Marinate pork. Can sub spicy chile garlic paste for spicy black bean sauce.  Garnish with Chinese parsley - or cilantro.

Didn't have all the ingredients so I made a similar recipe for dinner. It was good & filling. Very easy & customizable to whatever you have on hand.  Browned the pork with oyster sauce, garlic powder & pepper. Then added a little chopped spinach & cilantro with soft tofu for a little extra color & flavor

I couldn't find the spicy black bean sauce so, I just used garlic black bean sauce and added some Thai chilis for the spice. This came out just okay for us. It didn't taste bad, we just think it lacked something and just wasn't anything special that we would want to make again.

Tasty and very fast. I added some broccoli and added the tofu at the end so the cubes wouldnt get all mushy with stirring for the three minutes. Next time I'd add water chestnuts

I could not find spicy bean sauce or dry sherry so used garlic bean sauce and cooking sherry instead. I thought it was dry and did not like the flavor.
