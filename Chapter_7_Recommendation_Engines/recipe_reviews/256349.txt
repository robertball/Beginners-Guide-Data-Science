Love this as a good base because it allows for many different add-ons. I decided at the last minute to include a sprinkle of of all-purpose seasoning and tossed some leftover bread crumbs on top of each piece— omg!!! This was so delicious, easy and quick. I’ll definitely be making this again.

We enjoyed this.  I had haddock that was on the thiner side so it was ready in 12 minutes. Fairly basic recipe that could be adjusted to suite your tastes.  Thanks for sharing!!

So simple yet so tasty. Family loved it. I used Alaskan Cod. I served it with Zucchini chips and brown rice. I’ll definitely make this again.

Nice simple recipe that turned out delicious. I did add a sprinkle of dill and finished it up with a couple of minutes under the broiler.

Very tasty result even though it's so simple. Didn't have any lemons but had plenty of limes left over from the margarita party this weekend (haha), so used the juice of one lime instead. Had lake trout fillets (wild caught, not farmed). If you can get it, use quality butter (Irish or French) for exceptional flavor. Who thought something so simple could be so good. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very good!  I used almost a pound of flounder fillets because that's what I had on hand. Cooked in about 22 minutes. Delightful and delicate taste. Delicious!
