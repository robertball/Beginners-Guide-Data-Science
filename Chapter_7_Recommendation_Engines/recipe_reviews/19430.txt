Well, indeed it is a great substitute except it will give you the worst stomachache from the high concentration of condensed air that you are pumping into it! All you're swallowing is air so don't overdue it - just be careful!

WOW!  Avoid this one folks, unless you enjoy a challenge.  I blended and blended until my arm about fell off, and still nothing but sweet milk.  After 15 minutes of blending at every speed, I gave up.  The directions really need to be more specific.  How long do we blend before peaks begin to form.  2 minutes, or 20?  I am trying to salvage my milk mixture.  I poured it into a bowl, added extra vanilla to taste preference, and it's now in my freezer.  Going to attempt to turn it into ice cream, or rather ice milk.  Thanks anyways, but next time, just go to the store and buy cool whip.  It will actually save time and even money considering todays milk prices.  :-)

After halving the recipe and following the directions, the result was foamed skim milk with a hint of sweetness.  I added more sugar in hopes of a whipped cream-like product.  That didn't help.  It made it worse.  This is not something I will try again.

I would not use this recipe, even in desperation. I not only wasted milk, but time and money. You should really try out a recipe before you put it onto a site like this. I tried, to no avail, make this recipe work. However, after I exhausted all my efforts and attempts, I ended up with foamy milk with a hint of sweetness.

I whipped the milk for the longest time, and it still didn't work. Even though it got slightly foamy, within 3 minutes the air had gone, and all i had left in the bowl was sweet milk. At the end of the day, cream works the best when it comes to whipped toppings

After reading the previous reviews, I tried this with Lactaid's new Half-and-Half. I still got very bubbly liquid, even after adding more confectioner's sugar.

I've made this type of whipping cream and it tastes pretty good to me because it's fat free so no guilt and works in a pinch as long as you have skim milk and a really powerful mixer (400 watts or more) and use really cold skim milk. It really will only work with skim milk and I also put my tall mixing container in the fridge to get cold as well .  I own a Bamix immersion blender and the recipe book has stuff like whipped toppings to mayonnaise but it has speeds 8000 to 12,000 rpm so I think the people complaining here that this recipe didn't work just didn't have a strong enough mixer.  * Also - I add a few drops of vanilla stevia (amazon sells it) which really adds to the taste with out the calories

I have a question would it be ok to use 2% milk instead of skim?
