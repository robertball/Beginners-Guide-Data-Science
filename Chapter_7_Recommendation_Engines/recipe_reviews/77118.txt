Update - still make this a couple of times a month and know it will be a hit at my SuperBowl party - thanks again for this true keeper!  ... Excellent and authentic!  I added a bit of cilantro and a small onion (humoring the backseat cook bf: "salsa w/o onion?!"), and it looked as good as it tasted.  Next time I may use serranos, etc. to add some heat, depending on the company.  Thanks very much for sharing!

I finally have found the best green salsa.  I have tried many and they were never the ones.  This is the best I have ever found.  Just made it and followed the directions which rarely do, only guidlines.  Did add 1/2 small onion and 1/2 bunch of cilantro.  Tried it and was great, wife tried it and thought it was the bomb and couldn't stop eating it, even got a slice of bagget out and tried it on that.  She said it could use a little sugar, added 1 pinch was good added 1 more pinch and it is a keeper.  This will be the only salsa i make from now on.  Thanks for this one.

This recipe is great for chip dipping as well as for use as a marinade.  We used it to marinade chicken breasts and they turned out really juicy and flavorful.  It also worked wonders on a pork loin we grilled.  I'd suggest soaking the meat over night for full effect.

I usually make tomatillo salsa with cilantro, but used this recipe because I didn't have any... totally different flavor, I love it!  Very sour and spicy!  I used 5 tiny hot peppers instead of jalapenos... VERY spicy, not for the faint of heart.  Great recipe, thank you!

¡Qué Rico! I had a "cambio de galletas" (cookie exchange) this weekend and made a batch of this as a mojo to have with some chilaquiles. Lovely flavor! I have a lot left over and I am putting it on everything...my vegetables, my meats, etc. Thank you!

This is so easy to make. Hot and spicy! I couldn't resist and added a little onion powder to the mix in the blender. Maybe it would have been milder if I had seeded my large jalapeno first. Thanks for sharing this recipe! 4.5 stars

very good salsa. I used 1 lb fresh tomatillos (6 small tomatillos), husked and rinsed, 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded, 3 cloves garlic, peeled, no cloves, dash of cumin, a pinch of rock salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. did not need to add any chicken bouillon granules. Also, I placed all of these ingredients on a baking sheet along with half of a white onion, rough chopped, roasted them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes until they were real soft. Threw them into a blender, added a bunch of fresh local grown cilantro, pureed them, squeezed half of a lime juice and added more salt if needed. I served this with, "Carne Asada Taco," "Spanish Rice," from this site, and also with beans.

Fabuloso! Maravilloso!!! Holy smokes is this stuff GREAT! I love it! I finally found some FRESH, homegrown tomatillos in CANADA! (my local farmer's market had them!) and I could not WAIT to try this recipe! I have been to Puerto Morelos twice now (once for a cooking class there) and this can not be any more authentic! The only slight change I made was to use one jalapeno and one red serrano fresh picked from my garden! I am headed to the market this morning to get as many tomatillos as I can so I can make more and freeze for the winter! Woo-Hoo! Muchas Gracias Tapatia por sus recita!!!

Excellent and authentic! I leave out the cloves, personal preference only. I use this for many things, but mostly for chilaquiles verdes! Pick tomatillos that are small to medium, firm and have the skins still on them. Enjoy!

this stuff is fantastic!  I make it at least once a month and it freezes well.  It is great on eggs.  I put some on my breakfast sandwiches all the time.
08/19/22016 Update:   I still love this stuff.  I make it whenever tomatillos are on sale.  I started to cook/char the ingredients on the grill instead of using the stove whenever it's nice outside.

I LOVE salsa & this is about as good as it gets(on the green / smooth texture side)! It's too spicy for the "mild' salsa folks, but the flavor is A+++!!! Excellent as a dip or a topping.

This sauce is amazing.  I can't wait to try it on eggs or juevos rancheros.  I think it would be a great sauce to put on chili rellenos, as well.

I didn't love this one.  I thought it was lacking in flavor.  But to be fair, a good salsa is only as good as your tomatoes- perhaps I am not a good judge of tomatillos when it comes to salsa verde.

This was the first time I made salsa verde and it was awesome.  My husband and I loved it and I will definately serve it when we have guests.  It was so easy; I will never buy it in the jar again!

Maybe I did something wrong, but this salsa just didn't do it for me. It tasted as if it were missing something, and I added chopped onions.
Perhaps I have grown accustomed to the manufactured green salsa in a jar (egad!)
Thanks for the recipe though.

Amazing! I'm a big salsa fan, and everyone I've made this for has loved it!  I ended up using habaneros instead of jalapenos to make it spicier, and added about 1/4 cup onion.  Great recipe!

Very good, Very easy salsa to make. 
I had never used tomatillos before and this recipe was very easy to use the tomatillos I received in. I used it as the sauce for chicken enchiladas and they were very very good.

This is spot-on!  That dash of ground cloves is what sets this apart from other salsa verde.  Now that fresh tomatillos are stocked in my supermarket I can stop buying the jars.  Thanks Tapatia!

This salsa is a great starting point! I made as directed and felt that a 1/2 white onion and 1/4 bunch of cilantro with a dash more of sea salt took it from good to phenomenal. I will make this regularly and can't wait for the next social event to share it. Thank you for the great recipe!

Excellent. I made it exactly as the recipe and wouldn’t change a thing. Definitely a keeper!

The recipe calls for a dash of clove... literally, just use a dash!! The clove slightly overpowered the dish and I would do without next time. Otherwise the flavors were great!

I tried this, but compared to the canned salsa verde, which I've used to make this super fast instead of from scratch, the taste is bland and tastes like leafy vegtables. The canned has a more chili taste but both were spicy. Maybe I need to learn how to pick different fresh tomatillos, it lacked in the flavor I'm used to for salsa verde.

This is awesome!!! I also added a bit of sugar...about 1.5T in all. I alos opted for only 1 jalapeno and even with that, it was plenty spicy...and we like spicy food! So quick and easy...will never buy the jarred stuff again! YUM!
