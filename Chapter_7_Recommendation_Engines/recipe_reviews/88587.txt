Sauteed the mushrooms and onions in extra virgin olive oil with a paste made of fresh garlic and a little sea salt.  Topped them with grated fresh Parmesan and skipped the Asiago.  Beautiful--especially served alongside our grilled steak and "Smashed Cauliflower," also from this site.

Tasty and quick.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic flavored oil.  Next time I would cut the total amount of olive oil in half, to make it even healthier and lighter.

Couldn't have been easier to prepare. I used fresh garlic and olive oil instead of garlic flavored oil.  Also, added a tad of butter. Put on top of a salad. Used presliced portobelo mushrooms.

This recipe is great, it's also good with cut up tomatoes and spiced with crushed red pepper.

I definately used the shallots instead of onions the second time (first time was too dominant of a flavor).  It was really good.  Added just a splash of white wine before serving.  Thanks for the post.

These go fast, so at least double, if not triple, the recipe..also, fresh garlic is important.

I used shallots instead of onion.  Like others, I used fresh garlic instead of garlic olive oil, and used shredded cheddar as a poor girl's substitute for asiago.  (Hey, I can take risks when I'm cooking for myself!)  It was pretty good!

LOVED THIS: 4 onions chopped/sliced 2 portobello mush sliced and cut into smaller pieces 4 garlic cloves chopped cooking water from garbanzo beans (not soaking water; that gets tossed) salt white wine  1.  heat a little EVOO and throw in onions and garlic and sautee down on high flame.  add "bean juice" as needed.  Chicken broth would be good, too. 2.  add mushrooms and a very little salt and cook down. 3.  add 1 cup or more of garbanzo beans 4.  at the end, throw in some left-over white wine.  FILLING AND UTTERLY DELICIOUS!!  I will double it so I get some leftovers.   House smells great and the scale tomorrow morning will show me a good number!

Absolutely wonderful.  Easy to prepare while finishing the rest of the meal.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic flavored olive oil, but it was great. Thank you

Many recipes are described as quick and easy, but this one truly is.  It was quick, delicious, filling, and healthy!  I reduced the calories by using 1 tablesppon of toasted seasame oil and one table poon of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Lite (165 calories vs. 360 calories).  I also reduced the sodium by using spices (I used Mrs. Dash) instead of salt.  I agree with other reviewers, fresh garlic (or minced garlic from the jar, 2 tsp) makes a difference and is a good alternative if you don't have garlic olive oil.  Truffel oil would probably taste great too.  I like the tomatoes idea that others used, I'll try that next time.  I personally liked the onions, but I love the flavor onions add.  Great recipe!

Sauteed the mushrooms with shallots and minced garlic.  Added a splash each of balsamic and red wine vinegars and a pinch of red pepper flakes in the last few minutes. Let the vinegar cook down on heat. Omitted cheese and 2nd drizzle of olive oil. Delicious, light and refreshing - especially served with a salad dressed with lemon vinaigrette!

Pretty good! Used extra evoo and minced garlic and couple of dashes white wine; warmed diced tomatoes at end of cooking; put on top of spinach; sprinkled with a little light balsamic vinaigrette. This would make a good side dish with steaks too - guess I'm not much of a vegetarian!

Unbelievably good (lots of flavor), easy to prepare, and perfect if you are watching carbs.  Like many others, I used regular olive oil with minced garlic instead of the garlic-flavored oil.  I also used a grated parmesan/romano cheese instead of parmesan and asiago.  I'm comfortable that this turned out close enough to the original recipe to give it a 5-star rating.  I normally won't rate a recipe if I've modified it too much.

These were delicious, but the amount of oil the recipe calls for was too much in my opinion.  I reduced the oil to 1 tablespoon and added fresh garlic instead of using garlic flavored oil.  With these changes, this 5 star recipe.

I did this recipe by accident! I was just trying to combine great flavors that I love while doing a fruit and vegetable detox. I didn't use any cheese, but did decide to add some fresh baby spinach! It was delicious AND GUILT FREE! :)

So simple yet so delicious! Used 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic flavored olive oil and added some small spicy green peppers. Sauted until the mushrooms were soft.

This is very, very good. I didn't have garlic EVOO, so I just added a little minced fresh garlic to regular EVOO. I didn't use the whole amount of oil called for, I did add about a tbsp. or so of balsamic vinegar for flavor. Incredible taste. Very good.

I've always wanted to try portebello mushrooms but didn't have a recipe. This is a great one. I enjoyed it very much. Even my 19 year old picky eater liked it. I altered it a little, I purchased pre packaged parmesean, asiago, and romano cheeses. I was still very good.

OMG. I had two portobello mushrooms that I was planning to have with steak but never got around to it.  The steak got frozen... no big deal.  But I had no clue what to do with the mushrooms.  This recipe was awesome.  Like others, I added a little butter and then serve it over quinoa pasta.  Omitted the Asiago (didn't have any).  I will be serving this amazingly delicious dish (vegan at that) to all my friends.  It is delicious, filling and oh so tasty.  Thank you!!! This will be one of my favorite pasta dishes for a very long time.

This was a fast no meat dinner. I did not add the additional 1.5 tbsp of Olive Oil.  I made linguini to amke this a dinner and added some of the pasta water to make a sauce.  I also added some chili flake.  It was yummy.

I think I need to try this again. I added tomatoes but it still needed something else - something sweet I think. We also excluded the cheese.

Very good! I followed the recipe, except I left out asiago cheese (didn't have any) and used plain olive oil and minced garlic instead of the garlic flavored olive oil. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I used fresh minced garlic, shallots (for a softer flavor) some balsamic vinegar which reduced in the pan and gave the mushrooms some zing and shaved Asiago on top. Great recipe!

YUM! I just did this today for lunch, only I used whole portobello caps.  I sprinkled the cheeses into the upturned mushroom cavity and let it melt a bit.  DIVINE.

I prepared the mushrooms with some fresh basil and served it on a bed of fresh spinach with feta grated on top rather than the parmesan and asiago.  Very delicious salad!

So easy and quick to make! I substituted the garlic flavored oil for bottled minced garlic in olive oil though.

This was wonderful. Flavorful, simple, easy. Even my husband, not a big mushroom fan, really liked it. I didn't have garlic flavored olive oil so I sauteed a couple pinches of fresh minced garlic in regular olive oil instead. Great side, great vegetarian option, or even a great snack. Would also be great on steak.

Just tried this recipe tonight.  I can't believe how good it turned out to be.  I wasn't convinced but basically it's all I had time for, and needed to do something with the mushrooms I had bought 2 days ago, so I tried.  Am I glad I did! I used fresh garlic instead of garlic flavored oil and didn't put any black pepper.  Also, didn't have any Asiago cheese, and the only parmesan I had was a 'Caesar Blend' which had Romano and Parmesan mixed.  Well, IT WAS Delicious!!!!  As some said, make extra because it goes fast :) We had it with a spinach salad and mashed cauliflower.  Super fast, easy and Tasty!

This was very good. I made it with Baby Bella's and followed the recipe with the exception of the garlic flavored olive oil because I did not have any. Instead, I minced 2 cloves fresh garlic and added it the last few minutes. We had guests for dinner and everyone commented on how good they were. I served with marinated strip steaks. I will make this again.

We really liked this recipe but my onion seemed to be a bit strong---onion’s fault—LOL.  Next time I will use fresh garlic, a shallot, and add a little butter along with a splash of wine just to add a couple more layers of flavor.

We had this last nite & loved it.  I did use shallots, instead of onions.  I couldn't find Asiago cheese, but did find a grated Italian cheese mixture that had both cheeses, ( and some others as well), & used it instead.  Both of us loved it!

This was great!  I used fresh garlic instead and green onions.  Also added red wine at the end.  Topped our salads and didn't need a dressing.  Very tasty indeed!

I made this as a main course for a vegetarian. She loved it! As did those who also had the chicken! I used fresh garlic instead of flavored oil. We like garlic; I used about 8 cloves.

Used 1/2 the olive oil stated and used a minced garlic instead of the garlic flavored oil. Didn't have any frest asiago, so just increased the amount of parm.  Very good for a side!

YUM! but I want to try w/blue cheese next time - First Made More as is, except that I didn't have access to garlic oil & used more oil than called for... the results?..:  Fabulous! These mushrooms are evidence that I'm finally growing up (aka: I can finally cook fabulous mushrooms, ...took me a while! .... I'm over 50!)!  Hmm, mods: Put crushed garlic in the pan prior to everything else and left them long enough to get a bit soft. Then I pulled them out of the pan so they would not burn.  Put in the mushrooms and the onions, and 'turned down the heat' on my electric skillet.... Hmmm, that took a while.  Which required extra oil (turns out to be my preference!?)....  Guess I'm not the 'low-fat' gal in the crowd these days !  Anyway, I finally said 'enough is enough' about the cooking time, ramped up the heat setting to its highest; they browned beautifully in no time & so did the onions. Tossed the garlic in just prior to serving.  Hubs wanted them on buns.  We added mystery cheese (some specialty cheese which we didn't get to and had been frozen long enough to lose it's label...) and topped it off with some onions which I 'd tossed with white vinegar, S&P, sugar, and pickling spices. Served with a side of caramelized carrots and onions. -- I couldn't be more pleased! Thank you!

I used fresh garlic instead of garlic-flavored oil, and dried basil, as well as shallots instead of onions. I also added some balsamic vinegar and red wine near the end and a little truffle oil after turning the heat off.  I served over a tossed salad with bleu cheese (instead of asiago) and avocados. Really delicious.

Easy and tasty. I found that cooking them on low was unnecessary, and just sauteed them at medium heat. Also added some butter in place of some oil like another reviewer suggested, as butter and mushrooms belong together! Final note: I don't ever have garlic flavoured olive oil, so I simply minced some garlic and added to the oil in the beginning. These were really yummy; I usually do them on the grill with Worcestershire sauce, which is a much different flavour than this, and both are delicious.

Thanks for the post, Bridget! Have made it 3 times in 3 weeks - we LOVE it! Have served it with steak, with pasta, and tomorrow and am taking a neighbor's advice and will serve it with scrambled eggs for breakfast. I ad never had Asiago cheese, but really enjoyed it.

This was a really good recipe.  I did make very minor changes.  I drizzled olive oil on the mushroom added salt, pepper and onion powder.  Used chopped garlic and a some butter.  I did not add any grated cheese.  It was really good.  I sliced the portabello thinly in and angle and served them on top of chesse burgers and it was a hit.

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe with the only exception of using a garlic and salt paste like Naples suggested and only putting parmesan cheese on top.  A very good side dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this side dish.  I will cut the onions in ringlets next time as I would prefer that they cook a bit more.  I used a red onion.  It was delicious, fast and yummy.

This was GREAT! I used fresh garlic and omitted the onions, though I will use shallots next time.  I added a bit of red wine toward the end and then spooned some balsamic reduction over the top.  Even my son who hates mushrooms thought it was amazing!

Fantastic! I doubled up the recipe and made it a little early for Thanksgiving. It kept really well in a covered casserol dish in the oven. Also while in the oven it released a bunch of juices that I plan on turning into a mushroom gravy!!

Very yummy, I made this to have with steak but after having it I feel it could easily be eaten on its own. So much flavor.

This was delicious! I used fresh garlic and added balsamic vinegar for the last few minutes. Served it over quinoa, mixed veggies and pesto with parmasan. Absolutely fantastic! Thanks for the inspiration!

Quick, easy and very tasty. I know it was optional to add steak seasoning and bc I ran out of it, I used Mrs Dash original. Also added grilled chicken and we had it as a main dish. So delicious be the chicken I grilled had already been cooked in a steak marinade so it gave the mushrooms so much additional flavor.  Would definitely make this recipe again and as a sidedish

I just used the Asiago but skipped the Parmesan. I used more portabella mushrooms only because I wanted to use them up. It was good and I will make the recipe again.

So delicious! Even my picky eater loved it! I used 5 mushrooms, 3/4 thinly sliced sweet onion, 5 minced garlic cloves with a dash of kosher salt and oil that sat for 15-20min instead of infused oil (thx naples34102). I also added one thinly sliced pattypan squash. Served next to "roasted" red potatoes cooked in my Instant Pot.

I made this recipe the other day and it is VERY bland. I do not understand the 4 and 5 star reviews because this recipe (undoctored) is not good. I ended up sautéing them in Balsamic vinegar which 'completely' saved me. If these folks are giving this recipe a 4 or 5 'after' making changes to the recipe...then the recipe  (original) does not warrant high ratings.

My first time cooking portobello mushrooms and this was the most perfect, easy, delicious recipe. Used fresh garlic, and onions and added one small zucchini chopped, about 2 Tbs. red pepper chopped, and two small cherry tomatoes sliced. Only used parmesan as I had no asiago on hand. Delicious!

This was unreal. I was looking for a quick meal and happened to have a portabello mushroom. I used fresh garlic nd no salt. Added a few slices of red pepper with the mushroom. Placed in a warm tortilla with mozza cheese. I cant wait to make this again!

Was just ok for me though I may have over cooked the mushrooms as they seemed a bit tough... And I should confess that I don't LOVE mushrooms to begin with. So, this was meh. I won't likely make again.

I made the changes others recommended (fresh garlic, green onions, wine) and served it over penne pasta.  But it seems like it needed something else to make a sauce for the pasta.  Anyone have suggestions?

I thought this might be good based on reviews, however I found it to be bland and too soggy with all the oil required.  After saute, I added, a tbl spoon of balsamic and tsp of soy, topped with feta cheese and placed in oven on 400 for five minutes.  Next time I will go back to cooking on the grill.

Excellent side dish for steak or pork!  I love portobello mushrooms and this was a gread way to cook them.  I added a little balsamic at the end but probably isn't even necessary!

I've made this a few times. I use regular olive oil and a little garlic powder and/or diced garlic, depending on my mood. Very yummy, great vegetarian alternative main course.
