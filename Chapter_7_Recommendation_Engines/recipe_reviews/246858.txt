I made another Currywurst sauce last night too but hands down this one was the best. It uses a lot less ingredients yet taste much better. I'm not sure what sweet curry is? I just used the curry powder you find in the spice aisle and it was delicious. The only thing I would change is to reduce the amount of sugar but that is it.
