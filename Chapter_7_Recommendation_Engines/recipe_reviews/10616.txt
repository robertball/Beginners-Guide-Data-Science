I love this recipe and have been making it every year for the past 5 years at least, maybe longer! Only thing that I do different is before baking I dredge the cookies in a cinnamon sugar mixture and then place a baking sheet. It gives the cinnamon flavor an extra kick!

I didn't care for these, they are crispy, but taste's too doughy.  I won't make these again.

I made this cookie for a party. It was very festive looking and tasted great. It was a hit with us and well worth the effort.

This is even better if the pinwheels are glazed with cream cheese frosting

Made the cookies almost exactly according to the recipe, but substituted 1/4 cup of the sour cream for greek yogourt because I didn't have enough of the former. They were easy to make and turned out fantastic - wonderfully flaky without being too buttery, just the right amount of sweetness. The only thing is that for some reason, they puffed up into little pyramids - wish they would have turned out flat. But that also makes them interesting. 

Great recipe, will definitely make again!

My sister and I make dozens of cookies for the holidays every year. This one was added last year and was very well received.  It has been requested for this year so we will be doing it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasted fine and they did work out alright but a lot of work.  Did like the glaze on top - I will use that again but don't think I will spend the time to make these again.
