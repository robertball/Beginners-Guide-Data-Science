I made this salad and was very surprised how good it was. I made the dressing as written but changed the ingredents for the salad. Whole wheat pasta, red peppers, tomatoes, celery, baby spinach and kidney beans. A compleat meal.

I made this earlier today for a lunch I am hosting tomorrow so its only been sitting for about 4 hours and the recipe does state to let it sit for 8 to 24 hours before serving. I wanted to give it a try to make sure it was something I would be okay with serving because I was a bit thrown off by the smell of the dressing (very vinegary and oniony) was blown away by the taste of it already. Don't let the smell of the dressing hold you back nothing in it is overpowering. The dressing didn't seem like it would be enough but as stated by another reviewer it is very liquidy which is why it needs to sit for the amount of time stated. Its very fresh tasting, super simple/quick to throw together, and you don't have to worry about it having mayo in it. Definite keeper!

My new favorite summer salad.  I didn't have dried parsley, so I used some fresh.  Added small mozzarella balls and grape tomatoes before serving.  What a hit!  FYI for those who think there's too much liquid - that's the whole idea of this salad.  The pasta soaks it up overnight.  Don't drain, you'll be disappointed.

Cloyingly sweet and too much liquid.  I salvaged it with the juice & zest of 1 Meyer lemon, celery salt, 2 stalks of celery, the rest of the cucumber, and strained off the extra liquid.

I needed a simple pasta recipe for hot weather for a large group of people.  To often I see people picking out what they don't like...the cukes, the tomatoes, whatever, so this avoided that.  This pasta salad was SO EASY to make and went over great.  Nice thing too is that leftovers (only because we showed up late, oops) keep well because there are no veggies that get mushy.  Delicious, just as is!

Omg, I LOVE this! I only made 1 small change, I only used 1/4 C sugar, and that's a personal preference because I don't really care for sweet salads. Other than that, this is the best! I love that it's not oily, think Italian dressing oily, and there's no mayo in it, which gets boring after awhile. As for the person who said this was too wet, my guess is they either 1.) didn't wait the 8 hours before eating, or 2.) overcooked the pasta so it couldn't soak up the dressing. This is definitely going to be my new "go to" pasta salad!
