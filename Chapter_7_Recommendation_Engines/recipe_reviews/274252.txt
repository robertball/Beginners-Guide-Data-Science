These are a good spicy, pumpkiny, muffin with a great texture. They aren't too heavy at all, even with using all whole wheat flour. I did sub maple syrup for the honey and used less sugar than called for since my cranberries were sweetened--and I'd probably use even less next time, or use only the maple syrup without additional sugar at all, as I found them to be a tad too sweet for me. I topped a few of them with the cranberry/sugar/spice mixture, some with just cranberries, and some with just cinnamon sugar. I didn't care for the cranberries on top--as they got kinda hard and chewy while baking. And the additional sugar on top was unnecessary. For me, I would just sprinkle the tops with some cinnamon and call it good. I could see adding walnuts, pecans, or almonds to these as well! They took about 23 minutes to bake, and I got 16 muffins out of it. Thanks for the recipe!
