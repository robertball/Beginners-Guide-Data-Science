This was my first time making this dish, but I followed the advice of other posts and made some changes.  I lightly seasoned both sides of the fillets with Lawry's salt.  Instead of raspberry vinegar, I used a raspberry vinaigrette, which isn't so "vinegary," for lack of a better word, but still flavorful.  I also used 2 Tblsp Dijon mustard instead of yellow, and cut the olive oil in half.  I didn't have any dill, so I used rosemary.  I also used just a bit less than 1/4 C of honey b/c the vinaigrette is already sweetened.  The result was fantasic!!!!  Even my very picky kids liked it!!!

I am personal chef and wanted to try this once before I made it for my clientele.  Something is not quite there with the combination of ingredients, it may be that it is too sweet for this type of fish.  My husband and I did not care for it.

First impression it needs salt. I guess I would salt the fish on both side before putting in the pan. Also I only had extra virgin olive oil in the house (it overpowered the flavors). I would also cut the amount of oil n half. You don't need all of the oil. It is a little on the sweet side, but not bad, a little more mustard would help. Changing to Dijon or brown mustard  would add the tang I am looking for.  It is so easy I will try this recipe again tasting the sauce as I go along to get the right mix. Always try the original once before making any changes.

This was the first time my wife and I had ever cooked fish.  By the end of the meal (which took almost no time to prepare), we had already added it to our list of fast, healthy favorites.  I don't know how kids will like it as we have none, but the flavor of the fish was incredible.  I recommend this for anyone who would like to make a light, fast, and healthy dish.

One of the previous reviewers of this recipe suggested subbing in two tsp of dijon mustard for the one tsp of yellow mustard-this worked out wonderfully!  Thanks for the great suggestion.

My boyfriend and I are fish lovers already, and we loved this.  I made a couple of substitutions, because of what I happened to have around: I used a spicy honey mustard instead of the yellow mustard, and I didn't have any dill, so I used rosemary instead.  I made a salad dressing to go with it: more raspberry vinegar, a little lime juice, and some plain yogurt.  We had that over spinach salad, with fresh raspberries.  Yummy!

I made this as one of the "freezer meals" I make for my parents.  I used a soy-ginger vinegrette instead of the raspberry vinegar mixture.  I put everything together in an aluminium foil pan, covered with foil and froze it unbaked.  Gave instructions to thaw overnight in regrigerator, then bake (covered) as directed.  My parents RAVED about it!

Very tasty! The fish is very moist.  I use dijon mustard and add less honey because it is a little sweet.

I cook Tilapia quite often.  This recipe was to sweet and just had an overall bad flavor, I will stay with my lemon pepper and dill weed, really brings out the flavor instead of covering it up..

We loved this but I adjusted the recipe as follows.  I didn't have raspberry vinegar so I mashed & drained about 1/3 cup of fresh raspberries and added enough white balsamic vinegar to the juice to make 1/4 cup.  I only added 2-3 TBS honey, and I used about a Tablespoon of dijon mustard.

of course of course Dijon mustard!! i am a huge tilapia fan, and eat it very often. the amount of olive oil is of course excessive. delicious recipe if you simply scale down the quantity of the ingredients. The flavor combo is delicious. just too much of it for a delicate flesh fish like tilapia!

Great raspberry flavor with the tilapia, easy and quick.  We also tried pan frying the fish with mixture with was equally tasty and a little quicker.

I used raspberry vinaigrette, which is all I had. Since there's oil in that, I only added 1/8 cup (1 oz) olive oil. I added seasoned salt to the fish. Got rave reviews! This recipe is a keeper.

Pretty good basis, but we modified it a lot based on reading reviews: less oil, more mustard, salt+pepper on fish. I also had to improvise with white vinegar & frozen raspberries since all the 'raspberry vinegar' contained sulfites. But the end result is pretty good!

I'm giving this a 3 because my husband (who enjoys sweet things) really liked it, and I really didn't lol. So i averaged our respective scores. I made it how the recipe said, except I very lightly salted the fish first. It was definitely overpoweringly sweet, so unless you really like stuff like that, I'd suggest modifying it or finding a different recipe.

Great recipe!  The only changes I made was that I used vinaigrette instead of vinegar, and I didn't have dill weed so I used Italian seasoning because that's all I had. I made it with asparagus and spooned some of the extra sauce over both on the plate.  Yummy!!

This is now one of my absolute favorite recipes.  For the people who said it was too sweet - one suggestion would be to increase the mustard to vinegarette ratio.  Overall, a VERY easy recipe with ingredients I always have in the kitchen, and it's so quick to prepare!  Thanks for posting this!

This just did not suit the tastebuds of me or my family. The mix of the honey and the raspberry vinegar made the fish way too sweet for my tastes. It overpowered the delicate taste of the tilapia. I probably will not make this again.

This seemed lacking to me.  Tasted like sweet fish.  Can't say that there was much remarkable about it.  The sauce would make a yummy salad dressing, though!

A very excellent and delicious recipe. I served it on a bed of Rice a' Roni ('stir fry' without the seasoning) with corn and green beans as sides. I drizzled a little of the 'sauce' into the rice to flavour it. My husband flipped over it. Also, I took the leftover fish and rice and mixed it with carrots and broccoli for an excellent lunch dish.

I followed some others suggestions. Instead of raspberry vinegar I used a light raspberry and walnut vinagerette. I also substituted the yellow mustard for honey mustard. I used an 1/8 cup olive oil. And for an added kick I sprinkled some crushed red pepper flakes on the filets right before I put them in the oven. Turned out great! My 3 year old son and 5 year old nephew ate it... Without ketchup! lol

X2, I agree with the other reviews.  Sub dijon for the yellow mustard, cut back on the honey and oil, and season the fish beforehand.  I still found it a bit too sweet and added more dijon to taste.

This was a nice change of pace for our fish meal.  I did take the advice of some of the reviews and added Dijon rather than regular mustard and vinaigrette rather than vinegar. I think the only thing I would change is letting the fish marinate in the mixture for the whole day.  I would have liked it to be throughout the fish, not just on the top.  My family really liked it and we will have it again.

This was excellent! Serve it with light sides, salad and a sorbet. If your serving food to people who generally don't like fish this is what you should serve! Don't serve it with heavily seasoned side with flavors which could overpower the fish. And don't overcook the fish!

I am happy to see that you tried to liven this up somewhat. In my opinion, tilapia has the texture of blotting paper and tastes about the same. Anything added is an improvement

After a few changes, such as less oil, and more raspberry walnut dressing (like that better than vinegar) this is a great recipe.  Goes very well with a beet, orange, red onion, and spinach salad.  One of my favorite meals.

My daughter was browsing and picked this dish for her 14th birthday dinner. We LOVED the flavor! The littler kids (and my husband) were disappointed in the color but all loved the taste. Also, the sauce was SO good on the dinner bread!

I usually try to make a recipe as close to as posted as possible the first time, but I just didn't have all the right ingredients on hand, so I improvised a lot with this one. I can't rightly comment on the posted recipe, but as I made it I really liked it! I used dijon mustard, pure maple syrup in place of honey, and, since I didn't have raspberry vinegar, I used red wine vinegar and a couple spoonfuls of low sugar raspberry jam. It still tasted a little sweet to me, so I added some seasoned rice vinegar. I blended it smooth with an immersion blender. I used two pieces of tilapia and poured a generous amount of sauce over. I had some sauce leftover and used it as a dressing for a spinach salad with apples, cranberries, and toasted pecans. My hubby said it was the best raspberry dressing he's ever had! The fish was good! It still tasted just a bit sweet. I'll probably reduce the syrup a bit next time. Thank you for the inspiration!

Fantastic entree!!! I was entertaining Saturday, one of my guest being my mother who doesn't like fish other than salmon. Well she ended up LOVING it. I like that is was sweet and there was no fishy smell through out my house or the fish taste. Bravo!

This was a disappointment. It was good sauce, but the fish is too mild to do anything but sit in it. I tried this with chicken breast cut in strips but again, it just laid in the sauce. I may try it on a fresh spinach salad instead. Good sauce, just didn't lend it's self to the fish's taste at all...

Great recipe!  The whole raspberry/vinegar/fish idea was new to me too, but I thought, what the hell, it sounded interesting and easy to prepare.  Glad I took the chance!  Wasn't sure if the yellow mustard was supposed to be the powdered or liquid variety, so I used powdered, and it worked fine for me.  Thanks, Darlene, for a nice new addition to my fish repertoire!

I used a light raspberry vinaigrette in place of the vinegar and oil since this vinaigrette was made with EVOO.  I only added half the honey called for in the recipe, but wow ... this was really sweet and my husband and I thought the fish could use more seasonings i.e. salt, pepper, garlic ,etc.  Might try again with no honey and more seasonings.

Lots of flavor! I used Swai instead of Tilapia - not sure it was a good replacement. However, the "sauce" is really good and would work well on chicken - plan to try that next.

This recipe sounds great, but doesn't taste very great, at all! I did use flounder instead because I like that much more than tilapia. The overall flavor is just wayyy too vinegar-y! I think it would have been better with a raspberry vingerette instead of the actual raspberry vinegar.

A great fish, but lacking a little of the raspberry punch I was looking for. A little less honey might bring out more flavor.

I took another reviewer's advice and used raspberry vinaigrette but the BIG DIFFERENCE was using fresh tilapia rather than frozen!  Oh my!  It was much more succulent and moist than any tilapia I've eaten to date! Never using frozen again!

Did not care for this recipe.  My family found it too sweet.  I decreased the amount of honey and raspberry vinegar but it was still too sweet.  We use tilapia a lot but I would not cook t this way again.

Tilapia is my choice to save money and have the taste of cod or haddock.

Love this fish and it does take on every flavor so I was looking for something dfferent then lemon herb, dill, cajun, etc. Prepared this for two and after reading others great ideas this is how I tweeked it. Two fillets, 1 T of olive oil, 2 T of lite raspberry vinegarette, 1 T honey, 1 t dijon mustard. Yikes, I don't think I even used the dill. I marinaded for about two hours in the frig and turned several times. Turned into a sprayed/olive oil glass dish. Poured remaining marinade over fillets and placed in preheated 350 degree oven uncovered. This took 25 minutes to flake the way we prefer. This is a keeper and thanks for the other reviewers for their ideas.......

This was a really good base recipe. It was really sweet, so I too added an extra tsp. of dijon mustard and also added some orange zest and about 2 tsp of orange juice. This helps cut the sweetness a bit more. I also sprinkled some toasted pecans on top when finish for a bit of crunch!

Hands down this was the best tilapia I have ever made! NOTE: I made a few changes.  I used olive oil, a raspberry vinegarette (dressing), 2T agave nectar (in stead of honey), and a sweet & spicy mustard, the final touch was fresh minced rosemary.  Wisk all of those in the pan, then rub the fish with seasonal before placing the mixure - dipping both sides. OOOHHH momma, this was good!

I used a light vinegar, rather than the rasberry vinegar and served this over a bed of creamed spinach with a butter and garlic pasta on the side.  Perfect quick and tasty meal.  Tilapia is one our favorite and inexpensive fish.

I don't like fish very much, however I have been able to eat Tilpia with the right recipe.  I don't think I will try this one again.  Just like a few others mentioned there is not very much taste, even with adding garlic, basil, Dijon, and lemon.

not so good.  Seemed way to sweet for a fish taste and while I think it has potential there are so many other good recipes out there.

It was good - not great.  I too thought it was lacking in flavor. The marinade tasted so yummy before I out it on the fish and baked it!  It lost something... we drenched it in the sauce to enjoy it.  It needs a little more oomph for my taste buds, but not bad overall.  I'll try it again with the addition of something.

I had this Tilapia recipe this evening and it was a delicious experience.  I think the next time I will use just a little salt and pepper on the fish before pouring the Raspberry sauce over it.  The sauce is deliciously delicate and it also mixed well with the Rice Pilaf that I served along with it.  THANK YOU DARLENE.  I will be making this again --- soon.

Quick, easy and very nice.  Of course it needed salt and pepper.  I did cut the amount of honey to suit my taste .  I don't know what yellow mustard is - I used Dijon and I added just a little more than the measure given.  I didn't use tilapia, but had sardine fillets in the deep freeze.  It went very well.

Hubby and teen son loved the slight sweet flavor. With the dill weed its extra special. I think we may try the spicy mustard next time.  This will be kept to make again!! Thank you for a real easy, special tasting recipe that takes no time or effort to make.

this was the easiest recipe I think I've ever made. I did make a few changes and used what I had, like: instead of Tilapia I used Swaii, subbed Italian Seasoning for Dill ,Dijon Mustard for Yellow Mustard, and only about 3-4 tsp of honey for the 1/4 c, and sugar free Raspberry jam mixed with Balsamic Vinaigrette for the Raspberry Vinegar. baked @375* for 18-20 minutes using the Sugar free jam and the vinaigrette made it somewhat diabetic friendly. will definitely make this again

I love healthy salt water fish and this recipe is no exception! I don't keep yellow mustard so I have tried both spicy mustard & dijon mustard & both work well. Don't worry not strong mustard-like taste, and I also I don't think any need for any other adjustments like everyone else here thinks.  The honey, mustard and raspberry vinegar provide more than enough flavor not to mention the dill that gets thrown in.

I was excited to make this recipe, but did't forget to look at the reviews and follow some suggestions of substitutions/tweaks. As others suggested, I reduced the amount of olive oil and honey. For the raspberry vinaigrette, I used a salad dressing with that flavor. I didn't have dill weed, so I used Italian seasoning. I also added a hint of salt to enhance the flavor. It came out OK. If I would make it again, I wouldn't add the honey or just add a little as the raspberry vinaigrette is sweet enough.

I love Tilapia because it is not a strong fish and I wanted a mild recipe. This one was easy and tasted good. The fish was nice and moist. I used 2 tsp of spicy brown mustard and half the amount of honey. I also used raspberry vinaigrette instead of regular vinegar and I seasoned the fish first with just a little Mrs. Dash. I love this site because of the excellent suggestions from others and it paid off in this case. My husband liked the flavor as well.

I tried this for the first time last night.  I did as others suggested though and used Raspberry Vinergerette.  I also didn't have any dill so made it without.  Very yummy!!  The only thing is you do need to watch the fish and account for thickness because I did this with 5 pieces and it seemed like they all needed extra time and I guess one of the pieces was thicker than the other and needed about 45 min.

Great recipe. I used pomegrante vinegar like someone else suggested, served with white rice and broccoli and it was terrific!

I'm not a big fish eater but I relly liked this.  Great for someone looking to introduce more fish into their diet.

Not sweet but great flavor. This one is a winner. *If you like a strong fish taste stay away from this one.

This was very good and easy to make.  I used a raspberry vinegarette dressing that was on sale and honey dijon mustard.  I also made it once adding in some parmesian cheese.

I thought the raspberry sauce was good but overpowering for a bland fish.  I plan on trying it again with a different fish, maybe cod or perch.

I VERY much enjoyed this recipe.  I used a raspberry vinigrette instead of rasp. vinegar.  Loved the light sweet taste and the moistness of the fish was great.  Make all the time now.
Thanks!

My boyfriend and I thought this one was pretty good.  We couldn't find any raspberry vinegar, but I had some leftover raspberry salad dressing.  It was kind of thick so I thinned it with apple cidar vinegar.

This recipe didn't really have a lot of flavor.  I followed it exactly using the raspberry vinegar.  My husband liked it fine and it was nice for a change but probably not something I'd make again.

I am so disappointed--what a waste.  I used 'raspberry white wine' vinegar--should I have used 'raspberry balsamic' vinegar?  I didn't think it would have mattered, but maybe that was my mistake?

This was very easy to make and good.  I couldn't find tilapia filets so I used wild Pacific whiting instead.  It turned out very good.  My husband,my two year old and I liked it.  My two daughters (4 and 7 year old picky eaters) did not.  I would make this again.

I thought this was incredibly easy and very tasty.  The sweetness of the vinaigrette was really fun.  And my husband loved it!  I used a brown mustard... I think any mustard would do, really.  I didn't find that it needed any extra seasonings.

Very easy recipe, and a unique tasty combination of flavors! It took a lot less prep time than 15 minuts...more like 5 minutes.

Great recipe. I substituted sundried tomato and oregano salad dressing as I didn't have any raspberry vinegar. My wife really enjoyed it as well.
