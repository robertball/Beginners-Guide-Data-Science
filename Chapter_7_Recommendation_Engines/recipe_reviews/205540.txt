This made for a quick, delicious and satisfying lunch made with a combination of ingredients very familiar to me.  Using Greek seasoning, however, was not something I've used often and I enjoyed it.  Can't beat a dish that requires such little clean-up, is SO good for you and so flavorful.  Other than using grouper instead of halibut (any mild flavored white fish would work) I made this with the ingredients as directed, just winging it with measurements.  While I did miss the golden color that comes from grilling, roasting or sauteing, I was nevertheless very pleased with this, and since this calls for ingredients I always have in my kitchen, it's something I plan to treat myself to frequently.

I made this the other night without thoroughly reading the recipe and just layered the ingredients instead of mixing them together first and it was fabulous.  The onion and tomato were chopped in fairly large pieces and the presentation was gorgeous.  My guests were very impressed and it was so easy!  Thank you mleiland!

Okay I know people get annoyed when you change up a recipe too much, but this came out really spectacularly so I thought I'd share.

I used half an onion rather than whole, and sauteed the onions and olives in about 3 or 4 Tbsp olive oil on medium heat until onions were mellow and brown.  Added a basil leaf and some chopped fresh lemon thyme because I had some from the farmers' market and have no idea what to do with it.  I also added about a teaspoon of dried oregano.  I added three cloves smashed garlic, the chopped tomato, one can artichoke hearts, chopped, capers and about 2 Tbsp tomato paste - again because I had some sitting in the fridge.  Covered the whole deal and simmered on the stovetop, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes more.

I greased a pyrex pan generously with olive oil, placed the halibut in, rubbed with salt and pepper and poured the lemon juice directly on the fish, and then poured the pan sautee mixture over everything, and baked until done.

Served over sauteed spinach with a side of rice.  Yum.

This is an excellent recipe!  My Greek Yiayia would make it often, served with rice pilaf and lemon wedges.  Don't forget the feta, sliced cukes and crusty bread.

Loved it! I used halibut, and the only change I would have made would be to maybe go a little lighter on the capers next time - I did rinse them first, but they seemed a bit too prevalent for my tastes.  Could just be me though, so this still gets five stars!  Love cooking fish in foil pouches - it stays so moist and the flavors of the other ingredients are absorbed nicely.  I'll be making this one again for sure! Thanks, mleiland!

Very good dish.  Veggies on top were scrumptious too.  Was a great change for a fish dish.  I made it as the recipe described except for the kalamata olives were omitted.  Was still great.  Kids ate it up too.

Had some tilapia one night and wanted to make something with it.  Made a few substitutions, but didn't stray too far from the original recipe.  Used canned tomatoes and ripe olives, and of course, Tilapia.  I liked using the foil packet - it makes clean up such a snap.  Very flavorful recipe, even using the substitutions I did.  Thanks for sharing.

Have made this several times. It is good enough for company! I make it in a ceramic dish with a cover rather than foil.

This was excellent! I didn't have 4 - 6oz filets and used 1lb of cod and didn't have 'Greek' seasoning so used dried oregano, basil, some sage and a (forgive me) shake and a half of garlic powder. One full medium onion and a half, a 6oz jar of kalamata olives and nearly an entire 3oz jar of capers.... with the other ingredients listed; served over jasmine rice ... wonderful!

I cooked everything as directed except that I used mahi mahi steaks because that's what I had in the freezer.  I also didn't bother to thaw them before making up my foil pockets, and everything turned out wonderfully.

This was so delicious! I left the ingredients alone (but topped with feta cheese) and served with olive oil & garlic couscous and a tomato/cucumber/feta salad with red wine/balsamic vinaigrette. Fabulous! Definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

WOW...loved this!  I scaled this recipe down for just the 2 of us and used tilapia.  I didn't have an onion, so left it out and had to pit the olives myself as my jar of olives had pits, LOL!!!  Nonetheless, this was scrumptious and we loved all of these flavours together, such a pretty and fresh summer meal!  Went nicely alongside Zucchini Saute from this site!  Will make this again no doubt!

Very good.  I didn't have tomatoes, but it was still good without it.  I did add mushrooms and green peppers.  Will definitely have again.

Fairly easy.  Used tilapia and added a yellow bell pepper and it was fine.  Next time I'll add feta cheese.

Ok I've made this 4 times now and here are my notes:
1.add red or yellow pepper
2.use a small-med onion
3.don't be stingy on the capers + juice, olives + juice, lemon
4.Tilapia cooks in 30m, veggies may take another 20+ min
5.serve with rice
6.garnish with feta + avocado

I tried this the other night with some modifications and it turned out amazing! My husband liked it as well. I didn't have any capers, so I just left them out. I used tilapia instead of halibut, and I had to make my own seasoning. I also sautéed the onions with about a tablespoon of minced garlic before mixing it with everything else. I served it with kale chips and black beans.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I found a Greek seasoning blend recipe that I used for the seasonings. I also made the dish with Tilapia - because that's what I had on hand - and campari tomatoes. I may try this in the steamer using the rice dish next time since it seems like it would be about the same as baking it in the foil.

Frickin'awesome!  I love garlic so also added 2 cloves, crushed, and made my own Greek seasoning, adding a dash of ginger and some cayenne to spice it up.  The topping to me was reminiscent of gyros.   I'll eat this a lot!

I made this for my vegetarian family tonight and they loved it!!! It was very easy and I had all ingredients on hand.  I did change a few things. I added roasted red peppers and crab claw meat. I did increase the amount of veggies and added garlic and added lemon infused olive oil. I will definitely make this again!  I served over a bed of kamut orzo.

This fish had a lot of flavor.  I used salmon instead.  The capers add a bit too much saltiness to the recipe.

How do I put this... AWESOME. It was the first time my husband and I had Halibut, so I was worried. But this was simple and delicious. No leftovers. And I am posting this to my Pinterest page.

This was really tasty!!! I was a little surprised because at first glance it didn’t look overwhelmingly appetizing but it sure was!!! The only thing I did differently was leave out the capers only because I’m not a fan and I used a different type fish because the Halibut was very pricey. I used Pollock instead and it was delicious!! I will definitely be making this again.

I grew up on the southern east coast with a lively seafood diet. This recipe works on most of your favorite fish...especially grouper. YUM!!!

Last night was the 2nd time making this dish. The 1st time I cooked the halibut 30 minutes and it was over-cooked and dry. (My fault, I guess.) The 2nd time I cooked slightly thinner halibut fillets for 12 minutes and they were perfect. I added some cayenne and garlic cloves to the "tomato mixture". Couldn't find Greek seasoning, so combined the 12 ingredients to make my own. Served with Greek salad and figs oozing with goat cheese, both recipes on this site.

Omg!!! I died and went to heaven! This was absolutely phenomenal! The only change I made was I used cod as it was all I had but everything else was as per the recipe. i served this over Uncle Ben's 7 grain rice and was blown away. This is a keeper!

30 minutes in oven destroyed $50 of halibut.  20 minutes probably right.  otherwise, tasty and easy recipe.

My mother LOVES this recipe!  Despite the fact that I have a whole collection of fish recipes, whenever she asks me to make "That fish meal" I know she means this one.  The Reynolds people won't want to hear this, but I've cooked this wrapped in parchment as well as aluminum foil and both ways turned out perfect.

Finally, a fish recipe that isn't fishy!  Delicious!!  I used cod, and for the first time ever, I actually liked the cod.  I made substitutions based on what I had.  Used marinated artichokes instead of capers.  I used my own mixture of spices, a little this and that of : oregano, dill, thyme, rosemary, basil, paprika.   Also added a tsp fresh minced garlic to the veggie mixture.    (It was salty, so next time will not add salt to veggie mixture)This would be excellent with crusty bread or pasta, mashed potatoes.    
Will definitely make again!

This was completely out of my food range because it had ingredients i have never used. But i was very pleasantly surprised! I will make this again! I will use a little more tomato and a little less olives. Also, I used cod fish because the halibut was too expensive. Yum! And very filling!

Great on the grill!  Love this recipe!  A couple of tweaks:  didn't have Greek seasoning so used a little bit of Old Bay instead.  Grilled the onion beforehand.  Cut back on the capers to 1T.  Sprayed Pam on aluminum sheets, chopped the grilled onion and mixed it with everything else and folding it up tightly.  Grilled on medium high for about 10-12 minutes.  Served it over a bed of sautéed garlic spinach and a side of rice/quinoa.  Absolutely outstanding; thanks for the recipe!!!

I used this marinade on shrimp (since I had no fish) and it was amazing. I would recommend baking shrimp in this sauce to anyone interested. Put it on a bed of couscous, and you're set. So good!

We did it with Tilapia steaks as that was what we had on hand and hubby liked it .  I cut down on the amount of capers a bit and added some yellow pepper.  Also used regular olives with tablespoons of olive tapenade instead of the kalamata. Those would have added even 
more flavor .

I will make this again and again.  The only change I made was to make extra of the tomato/onion mixture so people could add more if they wanted to.  EVERYONE wanted to - it was delicious!  My guests asked for a copy of the recipe as well.  It really is easy (even when you're feeding 10 people) and super yummy!

We used a really inexpensive fish, swai, and this was incredible. Required maybe ten minutes more of baking time but we started with the fish still frozen. We topped with fresh lemon juice and feta cheese and it was perfect.

I did not follow recipe but it provided great base of deliciousness... added green onions and  mayo and mild mustard to my seabass and the great part of it all is the foil wrapped fish that stays soooo moist.  ONE thing i would say, is don't cook any fish for 30 minutes unless it is a great big hunk... cooked this 20 minutes and it was flaky fine!

I thought the tomato mixture was very nice but the fish was so bland! maybe because we are used to eating more flavorful types of fish like salmon. I had to keep adding more seasoning. I won't make this one again.
