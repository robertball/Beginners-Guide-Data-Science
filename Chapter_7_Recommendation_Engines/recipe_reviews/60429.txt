This recipe was so easy to make. I tried it out since I didn't have many ingredients laying around but I wanted to try something new and different for salmon.  It came out DELICIOUS. The orange flavor is not overwhelming and is the perfect compliment to the salmon. It also seems to make the salmon taste less "fishy".  What a great idea! Thanks!

I add a few things to kick it up a notch. I add pats of butter about 2 inches apart on top, salt and pepper, and chef paul hommes vegetable magic, and minced garlic to the top. This adds  all the flavor that the previous recipe lacks and makes it all all- star. Broil till brown and  then turn to bake till flaky.

This was very easy to prepare. After reading the reviews that said the salmon was too bland, I sprinkled some seafood seasoning over it as it was cooking. It seemed to do the trick! Both my husband and I really enjoyed it and would make this dish again. Would be perfect as a light meal served on a bed of mixed greens.

This recipe is very unremarkable.  Like my wife said after the first bite:  "Tastes like salmon with orange juice poured on it."  Fast and easy but disappointing.  Would not make again unless all that was left in the refrigerator was salmon and orange juice.

This was a good starting point for this dish. I added garlic, salt and pepper and let the OJ caramelize before pouring it over the fish. I served it with rice and cucumber dill sauce. Fabulous! Tastes like cooked sushi when all mixed together. ;)

It was a great quick meal.  I added while boiling the sauce, a little bet of honey and lemon for an extra sweet touch.  It tasted delicious.

Pretty good!  I made some rice with mine, and to keep with the orange/citrus theme, I made it with part water and part orange juice to give my rice a bit of a tang.  :D

If you use very good, fresh salmon, fresh squeezed oranges and fresh dillweed, it makes a very good dish!  Really enjoyed it and appreciated the mild, rich flavors.

No, I didn't make any changes first time around and  Yes I will definitely be making it again.  I gave it this rating for many reasons, primarily because it was so quick and easy to make; it only needed a few ingredients; it was so delicious too considering the first two reasons....I will probably make it again as is, but also try adding one or two ingredients I really love.

I added two tablespoons of lime juice and the flavor was wonderful.  Any sweeter and I would not have liked it, and the lime juice leveled the flavor out.

The orange juice reduction makes this recipe as the salmon pairs well with it. I didn't taste much of a dill flavor.

Unfortunately ,I did not care for this one. It tastes like salmon with orange juice on it...thats it. Maybe should have made an orange sauce with some other ingredients, instead of straight orange juice, sorry..

The orange juice in this recipe covers up the fishy taste of the salmon. It is delicious and so easy to make! Whenever I want to get some fish into our diet, I am using this recipe!

I'm constantly trying to come up with new ways to cook salmon, and this was definitely unique. My husband and I liked it, but the taste was a little too mild for us. Very moist though!

This was my first attempt at cooking salmon, not only was it totally easy, but it was also really yummy.  I impressed myself.  And somehow it manages not to be too orangey, just a nice flavor.

I am not a big fan of salmon but this recipe makes it very tasty and not fishy. It's also very easy as it said and I love it.
