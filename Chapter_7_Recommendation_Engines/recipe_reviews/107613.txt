Being a true Boriqua (from Puerto Rico) I can truly attest that this is the real thing.  I've been cooking from Cocina Criolla (the authentic PR cookbook) & there were no hints on how to adapt this recipe to a slow cooker.  So I was thankful when I found this. With the following adjustments my home smelled like it did when growing up and it tasted exactly how I remembered!  The few adjustments I made: 1) I cooked a whole chicken cut up into pieces that was about 4 pounds (basically straight from the store) so I increased the amount of adobo I used 2) I used one entire can of beer instead of the wine (any kind will do, I used Miller light this time) 3) I used the authentic frozen Goya sofrito instead of making the puree mix (again purchased from the store - DON'T buy the glass jar because it's not the real thing).  I used about as much sofrito as I would have had if I made the puree.  3) I added one entire can of tomato sauce 4) I happened to have canned diced and sliced potatoes, so I used that instead of cutting up the ones I had just purchased (I forgot I had them)....and I think that's it.  The adobo and sofrito are key to PR  cooking & unless you have this, it won't be authentic.  My family practically inhaled the meal because it was SO good.  Thanks to whomever originally posted this.  Now that I know I can make it in my slow cooker, it will be a frequently made dish.

I have been making Fricassee this way for years and it is wonderful. The only difference is that I use white wine, a couple tablespoons of olives with their brine (about 8 olives), and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce or occassionally toss in a can of Rotel or other similar tomato and chile product. Hey, my grandmother makes it with white wine and tomato sauce so that's how I learned to make it many years ago, but this way is good too. Otherwise the measurements of ingredients are identical to what I have always used. Not only is it wonderful made in the crock-pot, but on the stove top as well.

Excellent dish! I'd describe this dish as extremely flavorful, moist, saucy and actually quite healthy. I served it alongside a salad. Its very filling and tasty even without a carb alongside it. I made only slight changes:
1) To make it healthier, I substituted the chicken legs for skinless, boneless, chicken tenders (I used 3 packets, so I also doubled the potatos).
2) The chicken rub calls for sazon seasoning  which I did not have. So, I looked it up online and made my own version of it: 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 tsp coriander powder, 1 tbl paprika, 1/4 tsp salt, about 1 tbl tabasco sauce, about 2 tbl white wine or rice vinegar. These ingredients are some of the ingredients included in the actual sazon. Other ingredients were already in the Adobo seasoning, so I didn't bother duplicating those. 
3) I thought the original recipe needed to be a bit saucier, so I added 2 cups chicken broth. 
This dish gave me a whole new perspective on puerto rican food and could actually turn into a staple in our household! By the way, I wanted to mention that I think you could easily make-ahead the sauce in the blender to save time.

Second time I made it: I roasted the peppers, garlic and onion for about 24 min. using 1/2 the evol called for in the recipe. I did everything else the same. It was amazing!

This is a delicious, authentic Puerto Rican dish.  The recipe uses fresh ingredients and native spices.  My husband is Puerto Rican and LOVES this dish.  It is FAR from bland (didn't quite understand that review).  This is as authentic as it gets!  I needed two pounds of chicken drumsticks, so I just doubled the Adobo and used an entire packet of Sazon.  It was fantastic!  I have never been able to cook Puerto Rican food like my husband does, due to the fact that most of their cooking is done by taste, not measurements (and I could never quite master that way of cooking, LOL).  So thank you very much for posting a recipe that us "non-natives" can make!!!  Delish!!!!  8-)

This recipe is right on.  Reminded me of my mom's recipe.  My only changes were:  1)  added 1/2 can (4 ounces of tomato sauce) 2)used sofrito (check out recipe on this site and omit the tomatoes, salt, and pepper) in place of the cilantro, peppers, onions, and garlic.  I thought the it was very flavorful but although my husband liked it a lot, he felt it lacked a bit of salt.  So, for those who think it is bland, just adjust the salt/sazon/adobo to your taste because this recipe is a definate keeper! By the way, I made this awesome recipe in the slow cooker and also in a pressure cooker and got awesome results all the time.  My 6 year old daughter is amazed by the fact that the meat literally fell off the bone and left it dry.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great flavor, and pretty easy (though time-consuming) to make.  Tip:  - Cook in dutch oven for 3 hrs on low heat instead of using a slow cooker - reduce the liquid.  I used the amount specified in the recipe for 1.8 lb chicken (even though recipe calls for 1 lb), and still ended up w/ way too much sauce

O My Goodness!!! There are not enough stars here to rate this recipe. It is amazing!! I used a 2 and a half pound bag of drumsticks skin removed. Two packets of sazon and two tablespoons of adobo. I used a 12 oz can of tomato sauce and a whole bottle of miller lite for this recipe. I did not use a crock pot and made it on my stove top instead. I first made the sofrito (blended veggies) then i seasoned the chicken with sazon and adobo and browned them in olive oil. I added all the sofrito, tomato sauce, and bay leaves and simmered on low for 45 minutes. It was perfect and the flavor was phenomenal. Will definately be making this over and over at my house .

I thought this was pretty good and a great starting point! I am lucky enough to be from a Puerto Rican family so I used my aunt's homemade sofrito instead of all the peppers, cilantro, etc.. In my opinion this was way too salty from the all the adobo seasoning but this can obviously be adjusted and my hubby loves all that sodium anyway.... I did use a 4 oz. can of salt free tomato sauce and about 1/4 c. of white cooking wine. I did cut the potatoes into chunks from the reviewers suggetions and this worked out great. It would be good to add some pinto beans next time also.

This was good, I did play around with the spices a bit to get it just right, but this was a good base.  Next time I will make sure to cut my potato slices thicker, as by the time this was done cooking, the potatoes had mostly all turned to a mushy sauce.  This didn't affect the taste at all, just the presentation.  Taste was very good.  Next time I might try with a can of diced tomatoes as other reviewers have suggested.

This was so good. Very fresh tasting...which does not happen with a slow cooker very often.  I will use boneless/skinless breast next time just to make eating it a bit easier.  Great flavor. Will make again soon!

This was soooooooo good!  I used a little bit more chicken (it was a pack of leg quarters but then I skinned it and removed all the ick so I'd say maybe about 2 and a half pounds were used) and there was enough sofrito without adding more liquid to cover the potatoes and chicken.  Very authentic taste.  Can't wait to make it again just to smell the fresh sofrito in my blender :o)

It was was way too much a potato fest without additional chicken; so I added 4 thighs. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written. By the time this dish was finished cooking though, it was way overcooked. The potatoes were mushy and falling apart and the chicken wasn't very tasty (or appealing) either. If I were to ever make it again, I'd do it on the stovetop, rather than rely on the prescribed time in the slow cooker.

Chicken thighs are our favorite so that is what I subbed, bone in, for drumsticks.  I know that boneless is less work to eat, but, oh my, the meat that has been cooked right next to the bone is the very best.  I doubled the amount of chicken so I doubled the sauce ingredients, cutting back a bit on the cilantro, and that probably was not necessary as there was plenty of sauce.  Not having cooked with sazon seasoning before I did not realize that MSG is one of the main ingredients.  I am going to look for a substitute the next time I make this.  I do not like really salty foods so I did not add the ½ tsp. of salt and I used white wine because that is what I had open.    When I tasted the sauce toward the end of cooking I thought I was going to end up dumping the whole pot, as it tasted very bitter and unpleasant to me.  I guess the recipe submitter knew best because I added some Himalayan sea salt and it balanced the flavors perfectly.  We ended up loving it the night I made it and loving it even more the next day.  I will make this again!

YUM!  This was awesome.  Used 2 bags of Morningstar Veggie Chicken strips in place of the chicken and it turned out marvelous!!!  Paired it with rice and Habichuelas Guisadas.  Shared some with one my students and she demanded the recipe instantly!

I don't know about this recipe being authentic---I just know it was DELICIOUS!  I did---don't we all---stray a bit from the recipe.  I had a package of boneless chicken breasts and thighs I used instead of legs and used most each of  red, green, and yellow peppers. I haven't had a crockpot since the my lid got melted (long story).   But I popped it all into my blue enamel roasting pan that has NEVER produced anything NOT yummy and into the oven at 300 for about 5 hours.  Anyhow, the smells in the kitchen within an hour---the alluring aromas of garlic and cilantro and onion...mmmm....    I did sample the sauce before I turned it over the chicken, and it was sooo good!  I could probably have just ate it then on some chips.  Oh---and I used fresh oregano.  I didn't use red potatoes but one thinly sliced Idaho.  I served it all with Saffron rice and a salad I made of the leftover bell peppers, some fresh jalepeno pepper, red onion, cilantro, rinced black beans and roasted corn.  I dressed it with a lime juice and garlic-olive oil dressing.  It lacked something---maybe a dash of vinegar?  It needed another layer of flavor, but mixed with the Pollo and rice---magnifico!  The chicken was so tender and sweet, the sauce---and there was plenty of it---was to die for, so complex and flavorful, but with a summer-y freshness thanks to the tang of the cilantro.  This recipe will definitely see my roasting pan again!!!!!  Thank you!  (Oh, and I can't believe it, but I found the sazon season

This recipe was very good, and my husband and I both loved it. It was a bit spicy for my kids, who are 3 and 5, but that could be because of my one major substitution.  I used one chipotle pepper and about a teaspoon of adobo sauce instead of the adobo and sazon seasonings. The sauce was still delicious, though, in my opinion, and the chicken was just falling off the bone- so tender and yummy!  I will definitely make this again!

This is an awesome crock pot meal! I did add about 3/4 of a can of tomato sauce. It was very flavorful! I also used white wine, and 2 green peppers instead of a red one. I made 2.5 lbs of chicken thighs so I did double the adobo and sazon. We enjoyed it!

This meal was so easy and so good.  I,a Polish-Italian descent , had a hard time believing that I cooked it.  My husband, a true Puerto Rican, wanted to know if his mom was over and cooked it.

Lacked flavor. Definitely needs some salt. Also, I like slow-cooker recipes I can throw together before work and then go. This one requires quite a bit of preparation. I probably won't make this again.

This was very tasty, but to me, too greasy.  I would like to try it again but with boneless/skinless breasts.  I think I'm just not used to cooking with dark meat with skin.  The flavor was fantastic, though!

I would add another packet of sazon and more salt.  I would also think about adding some chili powder, tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes.  It needed just a little more flavor.  Otherwise it was really good.

Wow !!! So yummy! The chicken fell off the bone and was mouth watering good! Very easy to make too! I used sofrito like some others had suggested and added chicken stock to cover. Next time I will add carrots and some beans.Thanks for the great recipe !!!!

Honestly I didn't like it. I expected it to have more pizzazz. It wasn't horrible and it was easy and interesting but not suited for my palate. It definitely needed something but I don't know what. A jalapeno maybe? Would that have made it terribly inauthentic? I know nothing about Puerto Rican cooking but this was terribly bland and a little bitter. It needs a kick.

My apartment is smelling wonderful with a couple more hours of cooking to go...I added a can of"Pearls" black olives just because I love em. I used a Food Processor to pureé the veg. I'm bringing it to work tomorrow for our Valentines supper and will find out then how good it is as my coworker is Puerto Rican.

I don't know if it's fair to give this recipe 5 stars even though I made some slight changes to it but the changes were slight and the end result was sooooooo good! The changes I made were: 1) Instead of using a tsp each of oregano and cumin, I used a tbsp each. 2) I forgot the bay leaves (oops!). 3) I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used 1 1/2 tbsp. dried cilantro. 4) I didn't have green peppers so I just used all red peppers. 5) I didn't have red potatoes so I used white potatoes. 6) I added a few manzanilla olives because of the other suggestions. Next time I'll make sure I have exactly what I need and try the recipe as written because when I winged it it was really good so I'm sure the original is even better!

First, Fact; half the human population taste's cilantro as the taste of soap! If you've never delved into the world of cilantro, i suggest you snip and eat a leaf off a bunch at the grocery first. Cilantro comes from the Coriander plant. You can try Parsley or Italian Parsley as a substitute. I'm one of those in between as I taste some of the soapy taste but I tolerate it well.

Anyway, I made it and I believe it to be a good recipe. Very healthy too. But I don't see why some rate it as difficult to prepare! All the veggys are rough cut and made in two batches in the blender or processor. I used Paul Masson White Zinfidel wine. Let me suggest substituting yucca for the potatoes! I will use the yucca next time I make it. My wife is New-Rican (I'm Scot/Irish) and says her mother (born /raised in Puerto Rico) added tomato paste and she wants it served with white rice. In summary, Bravo, great contribution to our community!!

Finally, the real deal!  Thank you for posting.  I have had many variations (a few with crazy ingredient twists), but I know this to be the correct and most authentic Chicken Fricassee of Puerto Rico.  Great job and "Buen Provecho!"

Probably the best recipe of this type I've ever made.  And I didn't do the puree thing, either.  Just added all the ingredients (frozen cilantro cubes instead of the real thing).

This dish took a while to prepare but was definitely worth it.  Everyone in the family loved it and the house smelled amazing while it was cooking.  Will definitely make this one again - would love to get a larger pot to make even a bigger portion!

Fricassee is a french word, and this is nothing like the Fricassee that the French Acadians in se Louisiana make. But, it sounds wonderful! So what's in a name? It's all good!!  :)

The chicken was awesome.   Make sure and keep the slow cooker on low, I didn't and it fell apart too much.  I also added a bit more liquid to the blender because the sauce was very thick.

Mine came out pretty good.  I didn't have the wine and I really would like to have tried it with the wine. It was a different flavor than I am used to but I am used to more traditional American foods.  However, I really enjoyed this dish and would make it again, but my boyfriend (who is kind of picky) tried it and said that "it really wasn't his thing"...so that must mean it didn't taste "bad" but just "different" than what I usually make for dinner. I would use this particular recipe if I were to make it again.  I made no changes besides that of the red wine, and I used chicken breasts. Also, I used some of the leftover sauce as a base for a black bean soup, and that was really delicious! (I added black beans, yellow corn, chopped bell peppers, chopped tomatoes, and a little bit of vegetable broth until the soup was the consistency I wanted)

This recipe is great! I used a previous posters suggestion and used the frozen sofrito and the beer instead of the puree and the wine and my family loved it! The only other thing I added was some hot pepper for spice. This will certainly be added to regular rotation.

I made this recipe as best I could with what I had on hand. Chicken breasts instead of legs, no potatoes, no wine. The chicken still had a beautiful flavor and was very tender. Served with yellow rice and pigeon peas. Made this again on the stovetop with a whole cut up chicken, still tender but definitely needs more salt.

The flavors in this dish are outstanding. The prep time is long but worth it. I didn't bother peeling the potatoes and it made no difference in the flavor. I also peeled the skin off the chicken because I didn't want this to end up too greasy. The one thing I would change here is the amount of chicken and potatoes. Not enough meat, and way too many potatoes. I might also add some peas or corn to it in the end. This turned out like a stew, so no rice was really needed here.

this was so delicious and fresh tasting.. we're not puerto rican so we didn't really care if it was truly authentic or not.. just so long as it tasted good!  i felt like one pound of drumsticks wouldn't be enough (equaled out to only 3) so i added one more and a thigh equaling about 2 lbs.. i doubled the sazon (i found a recipe for it on another site) but should have also doubled the adobo but i was worried it would have been too salty per other reviewers.. i also omitted the additional salt knowing we could salt to taste at the end..  i didn't double all the other ingredients as i wanted it to be more of a stew and less soupy like others said it was.. i used 2 medium russetts and 3 heirloom carrots, making sure to very thickly chop them up.. our cilantro bunch was on the large side so we just used half.. next time i'd use double the adobo to accomodate for the extra chicken and add black pepper while cooking since our adobo doesn't have any.. i just cooked it in our dutch oven on the stove top since i didn't have 6 hours to put it in the crockpot.. either way, i'd love to try this again soon.. bf absolutely loved it.. ty for the recipe

I was born and raised in PR. It tasted just like my grandma's fricase de pollo. I followed the advice from a reviewer and used beer (12 oz lager). My nana uses beer. I would recommend using a little less adobo. I make my own sofrito (peppers, onion, garlic, basil, cilantro)and freeze it so that it's ready when I need it. I cooked it on the stove. I pan friend the chicken with the ingredients except the beer. It took about 30 min to cook.

So absolutely delicious!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and upped the recipe due to the amount of chicken I had.  Wow!  The only thing I will do differently next time is to cook for less time- boneless chicken will cook faster thank bone in.  I think 4 hours on low would have been plenty!  The sauce was so delicious that rice on the side was a necessity to soak up all the garlicy flavorful goodness.  I will make this again and again!

This was delicious!  Not a recipe I would have originally picked, but my girlfriend made it for a work potluck and then I made it at home.  I used a combination of thighs and breasts.

This was the greatest slow cooker meal I ever had. So flavorful and tasted great! Only difference was that I made my own Adobo (googled recipe).

Delicious!  Awesome flavors.  I didn't use drumsticks; instead chicken breasts & thighs.  I added sliced carrots and didn't need the salt.  It was very flavorful.  Served with white rice, whole beans, and salad.  Nice, healthy meal.  Mine was done in 5 hours on low.

I thought this recipe was really good. Perfect for the crock pot.  I made this as is except I used 4 big thighs that was about 2 pounds and I thought it still turned out perfect.  I didn't have to adjust the seasons infact I thought there would be too much salt but it came out perfect.  The red potatoes are a must for this dish because they hold up where regular baking potatoes would dissolve or turn to mush.  Perfect amount of broth.  You can always save what's left over, strain it, and make a gravy to put over pork, roasted chicken fried chicken....meatloaf.

I always add 1 tablespoon of white vinegar and instead of red wine I use white wine or cooking wine. Sometimes, when I don't have wine, I use beer and works out great.

This was really good. Served w/ white rice. I did add a can of chicken broth, looked like it needed more fluids. I also did not have red wine, so I used white cooking wine, Also used chicken breasts.

The smell of this dish simmering all day in the slow cooker is making all of our mouths water. My children have been in the kitchen to check on it a hundred times, and they say they know it will be good because of the smell and color. I only used one potato, (red, skin on, cut small) because I want to make Spanish Rice and tortillas with it. I used white wine because that's what I had on hand. I've tasted the juices (it's still cooking) and so far it's wonderful. I would definately serve this for company for an informal gathering. Thanks so much for this recipe, it's definately a keeper!

Great ficase de pollo. I make it on the stovetop and sometimes add thinly sliced carrots. I add more chicken and keep on tasting it to make sure it ends up con mucho sabor.

I have made this recipe 3 times for my girlfriends and I have to say it is the best tasting dish and so easy to make.  I have served it with yellow rice and deep fried plantains and sangria.  The only part of the recipe that I altered (based on a former review) was to add only chichen thighs and chicken breast which I've cut in half.  I put it all in a slow cooker.  Bravo!

I tried this recipe as written except that I omitted the 1 teaspoon of ground cumin.  I made the recipe in a crock pot and was hoping I would love it because I was looking for a good fricassee. I was extremely disappointed in the taste. The crock pot did a good job of cooking the chicken, however I did not like the flavor particularly of the sauce. On another day I ate the leftovers hoping the taste would improve....unfortunately it did not. Needless to say, I won't be making "Pollo (Chicken) Fricassee from Puerto Rico" again.

Made this recipe tonight. It was great. It tastes authentic!
The only changes were I
didn't use cumin instead I used black pepper & added a small amount of chicken stock to it as well as about a 
cup of white  wine and finally 1/2 can of tomato
sauce. Delicious!

This Recipe was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I added a small can of Hunts tomato sauce along with 1/2 cup of Chicken broth. I like to have extra broth.   Added my homemade Sofrito (similiar to ingredients in step 2). Serve it with white rice.  My husband thought it was so good he went back for seconds.

This is awesome. So easy to prepare and so good. The only thing I did different is that I used bone in chicken thighs. Next time I might use chicken breasts for
More meat. Definitely will be making this again.

I love this! I'm Puerto Rican & this is authentic. The garlic, peppers, onion, etc that you puree together is called "sofrito" so I always have this blended on hand. (I make batches ahead of time and freeze them into small batches). The only change I make is I usually add some veggies, even if it's small corn on the cobs or just mixed stew veggies. I serve this with white rice and tostones (which are fried plantains). Delicious!! I make this all of the time.

Nice hearty fall dish! It was best the next day when all the flavors combined. Skipped the Odobo and Sazon seasonings and their MSG, preservatives, and food coloring. Instead I doubled the salt and add a teaspoon each of turmeric and ground coriander.

Awesome recipe!  I noticed some reviewers said it was too salty, I offer this suggestion: season to YOUR taste.  I used La Preferida Sazon all purpose seasoning with pepper and Adobo all purpose seasoning like I would normally salt my chicken before cooking.  I added one and one half pounds of skinless chicken thighs when I saw how much sofrito the recipe makes.  The sofrito(pureed veggies) is great.  Oh yeah, I'm making this again!

Amazing! I used chicken breasts, added some diced tomatoes while it cooked. Served it with rice, black beans, fresh cilantro and a little bit of salsa.

This was a huge hit! What a nice aroma to come home to after a long day. I ran out of wine so I added about 3/4 of a bottle of beer. I also swapped one of the green peppers with a poblano pepper for a little more heat. I used skinless drumsticks which helped with making it less oilly. Next time I will put a few skinless chicken thighs in too as it does make quite a bit of sauce. I served with white rice and black beans.  Thanks, this was a nice and easy authentic way of impressing my Puerto Rican Father- inlaw!!

This turned out great!  I used skinless chicken thighs instead of drumsticks and browned them before putting them in the slow cooker.  I doubled the amount of adobo seasoning and sazon as some had suggested and did not use any additional salt.  It seemed like it would be a little watery so near the end of cooking I added a small can of tomato paste.  The chicken was so tender it was falling off the bone. The potatoes were delicious (I'll put a couple more in next time). My husband really liked this - although if he'd seen what went into the sauce he would probably have refused to try it!  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is the ultimate slow cooker recipe- minimal prep work and outstanding flavor!! I like very spicy food so I substituted jalapenos for the green bell pepper and chipotle pepper for the sazon seasoning. The entire house smelled yummy. This will be my #1 go to slow cooker recipe!!!

This is a wonderful dish. I made minimal changes, added some sliced bell pepper and diced onions with the potatoes. I added some extra pepper and some Mexican Chili powder to it and next time (and yes, I will cook this again!!)I'll probably double the chili powder.
My slow cooker took about 6 hours on high to get the potatoes done. The chicken was moist and sooooo tender. I used chicken breasts (about 2.5 lbs) instead of legs.

Grate recipe.  I made this for my first meeting with the in-laws and it turned out perfectly.  I didn't change any of the sauce, I just used a fryer chicken instead of the dark meat.  It had enough spice and zip and it turned out very tender & moist.

The chicken was very moist but overall I found the dish to be very bland. The spice just seemed to one dimentional for me.
 My wife liked it though and thats why I am giving it two stars.

My boyfriend and I got a place of our own over two years ago and never really had company over for dinner till the other night.  I made this dish and everyone really enjoyed it.  It was easy to make and I didn't have to worry about wether or not I was going to burn it or if it was going to be ready to eat when we all sat down.

Ohhhhh Emmmmm Geeeeee DELISH!!!!! Now I did scan the reviews and tweak recipe based on what I read. I made 6lbs of chicken I used legs and thighs.....I kept measurements for the "sofrito" ingredients the same. I did purchase frozen sofrito. I used four tablespoons of it . I also used about 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth and 3/4 of a can of tomato sauce. I also added 1/2 cup more of wine in the pot. I followed cooking instructions to a tee. I made mine in a dutch oven. Next time I will brown chicken first. MAKE IT!!!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!

Very good!  I make my own sazon seasoning mix instead of using the packets (too salty with the msg). I halved the amount of adobo, which was a mistake. I used almost 2 lb chicken drumsticks, but did not scale the recipe considering reviews mentioning too many potatoes. I agree more meat is needed. Made this dish on the stove -- browned the drumsticks first, add potatoes (peeled, halved, and sliced), and sofrito mixture, and cooked over low heat for 2 hours. Removed and discarded skin from chicken. Removed meat from bones and added back to dutch oven for about 30 min. Served over steamed white rice. Loved the flavors and will be making again, but will add more meat. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is right on!  I had a Puerto Rican roommate many years ago and this is right on par with hers.  My only change was that I had an extra red bell pepper I needed to use up so in it went to the sofrito!  I'll probably be making this 2x/month at least now!  Best served with rice and tostones!

Doubled the amount of chicken... otherwise, followed it exactly; but flavor is missing something - it's too garlicky/paprikish (harsh). I added additional freshly chopped cilantro before serving to 'freshen' the flavors and it was ok.

Followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it. I did make my own adobo seasoning (found recipe on allrecipes).  It was good but definitely missing something... I will add more seasoning next time.  My husband, a real meat n potatoes man, like all the potatoes along with the chicken.

Delicious!!!  I had to make a few edits for missing items but tried to stay as close to the recipe as I could. I didn't have Sazon (couldn't find it anywhere) so blended up twice the garlic and cumin, 1 dried ancho, 2 fresh jalapeños, and a handful of cherry tomatoes (along with the other items listed in the recipe). It was absolutely fantastic and I will definitely be making this again for lazy ladies night!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, just subbing in chicken thighs for the drum sticks. I made my own sazon and adobo seasoning. I only added 1 tsp of the adobo since my recipe was very salty. I tasted the sauce at the end of the cook time and added 2 more tsp since it tasted bland. Much better! I can't say I am as wowed as I thought I would be from the reviews, but I liked it. Hubby said he liked it too - I don't think he loved it tho. Good, filling meal with the rice and tostones on the side. I may make it again during the really cold months.

I've made this several times, always using thighs instead of drumsticks.  Also, I use the frozen sofrito, so it comes together very easily.

Just made this for dinner. It passed the Puerto Rican test with my grandma who is a true native of Puerto Rico. So good. Gotta try it! I'm definitely going to make this more often. I served this with a side of Arroz con Gandules. Perfect.

I am Puerto Rican but haven't really cooked a lot of Puerto Rican dishes, I leave that to my mom normally. I saw this recipe and decided that I needed to try it. 
The few changes that I did are I used boneless, skinless chicken breast because my husband doesn't like the drums nor skin on the meat unless it's fried chicken. I also didn't have any red wine so I didn't use it. I served it over white rice. The family loved it. Thanks, I will try it again.

I think cilantro lovers will love this - it's almost like a chile verde with chicken. The hubby loved this but I thought it was good. Not sure what would have changed my mind and made it a *****'er - just not my flavors I think.  The chicken came out super tender (almost a little too tender) and the potatoes were perfect, surprisingly not overcooked.  Served this over brown rice.  This came out with so much sauce which got thrown away sadly - just too much to use.  A lot of work for a slow cooker recipe, I was hoping for something with shorter prep.

Very soupy and not appealing.  Hubby liked it, but the kids and I thought it was bland as is.  IF i make this again, there will be LOTS of adjustments.

You could also use chicken tights and if you are in a hurry or do not like bones, like me :), I use boneless tights instead. It will still be delicious.

We really liked this recipe!  Great flavors, we love cilantro, and it's so much better the next day!  The chicken was tender and we served it over rice.

Tasty! Not sure why we pureed everything, but it was good. We used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs. Turned out fine. Will probably make again.

love this recipe...will double and use for a group of friends.  I also used chicken breasts on the bone (cut into 3 pieces) and chicken thighs (cut in half)...I cooked this recipe for 10 hours on low and was a hit.

After reading all the positive reviews, I really thought this would be really good, BUT it wasn't!  I only changed 1 thing out of the whole recipe, and that was using beer instead of wine(as suggested in other reviews), maybe that is the flavor I'm not liking?  This took a lot of time preparing, and I was so excited to come home to puerto rican tasting chicken!  Darn!  Oh well, my boyfriend said it was "not too bad", so thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't sure which type of sazon to use; nonetheless, it smelled delicious while cooking; the taste was not as I was expecting but still very flavorful.

This is delicious and different but pretty salty. The first time I made this with the salt, but I omitted when I made this again.  Unfortunatly, I still thought this was a bit too salty. The next time I make this, I will have to cut back on the Adobo seasoning. I did skip the Sazon seasoning as this is bascially MSG.  I also replaced the chicken legs with a large tray of chicken tenders.

WOW! I used about 4 oz. tomato sauce and white wine like other reviewers suggested. This was amazing and easy. My husband licked his plate clean. I would love to make a huge pot of this for parties. I would love more authentic recipes like this.

Delicious! I used chicken thighs, added a can of rotel and used beer instead of wine. Next time I'll try it with the wine. Can't wait.

Even my two teenaged boys liked this! The flavor and texture of the sauce were totally new to us.  It was fun to make something different that wasn't loaded with the usual high amounts of fat and calories.  I did add 4 oz of tomato sauce as other reviewers suggested. Thanks Love2Cook for sharing this delicious recipe!

This reminds me of my dad, who was from Puerto Rico.  He made the most delicious chicken fricassee.  It wasn't exactly the same as I remember, but I think what's missing may just be the love :)  Thanks for sharing!

I'm giving this 5 stars because the only thing I didn't love is a change I made.  I used sweet potatoes and it added a little too much sweet flavor.  Worked great in the crockpot!

This was ok.  Glad I tried it, but not really a keeper.  I was really hoping for the best with this because it sounded delicious.  The chicken fell off the bones and it was a stew, more or less.  Watch out for the tendons and the end bone on the leg.  These come off the drum stick and make for a nice choke hazard if you miss them.  I think the veggie mix you dump on top could be a pretty good salsa with some doctoring.

We thought it was great!  I saved the leftover "gravy" and ate that as a delicious soup for lunch the next day!  This was a great way to get my kids to eat their veggies without knowing it!

This was pretty good, it smelled great while cooking. I didn't add the peppers for personal tastes, but my hubby (he is Puerto Rican) said is tasted authentic. But the chicken dried out in reheating.

This was AMAZING!!!!!!! I skipped the green bell peppers because I think they're gross cooked and just used red and yellow, otherwise I followed the directions and this was a hit from the minute it started cooking.  I don't have a slow cooker so I did it in the oven at 350 for 90 minutes.  My kitchen smelled SO GOOD and the food didn't disappoint!
