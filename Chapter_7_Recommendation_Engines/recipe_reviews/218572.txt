I rummaged around in my cupboard, looking for jello, and managed to find two black cherry and one raspberry flavored packets and decided "what the heck" and used them together.  They were all sugar-free, which is all I have.  I also found a quart-sized container of low-fat yogurt marked down to $1.50 because it was close to its pull-date. After I mixed everything together, I tasted it and thought I'd like to increase the cherry flavor  a little, so I dumped in a packet of unsweetened cherry Kool-Ade and a bobble of vanilla extract.  When these were half-frozen, I threw in some blueberries and raspberries.  I also sprayed the baking dish with some pan spray to make sure these came out of the dish easily.  And they did.  These were wonderful!  A nice refreshing lo-cal treat that helps me get my dairy for the day.  Thank you so much for the post, Pepita, I just love these things.  I can't wait to try some other flavors!

i love this!  I was looking for a healthy ice cream like recipe and found this.  You can eat is when it's barely thawed or wait longer and it'll be more of a jelloish consistency.  I used orange juice instead of water and orange jello for a more creamsicle flavor...next time I'll add mandarin oranges at the end!

Easy to follow recipe. Four cups yogurt = 32 oz container (knowing this will save you prep time). I used 2 cherry and 1 rasberry 3-oz box of regular jello. Wasn't sure how fluffy mix was suppose to be, so used judgment and poured when it looked ready. Wasn't sure how mixture would freeze w/yogurt so rather than pour the whole batch into a 9x13-inch glass dish, I used 1 plastic ice tray and 1 flat square storage container. I inserted popscile sticks into ice tray mix. Won't do that again - sticks or ice tray - too hard removing frozen mix. When I first took recipe from freezer, I waited 10 not 15 minutes before biting into it - was very tart. Put 2 tsp of mix in bowl and let sit in room temp for 1-1/2 hrs while family went to dinner at a resturant. Came back and ate the yogurt. It was a bit softer, had clear liquid forming in bottom of bowl. Yogurt tasted a bit sweeter then I prefer and consistency was more like "junket," a dessert Mom made when I was a youngster. If I make recipe again I will try using sugar-free jello in a different flavor. Suggestion: unless you plan to eat the whole recipe in one sitting you might consider putting mix in individual molds/bowls then freeze. Thanks for the recipe, Pepita.

Really good idea - used vanilla Chobani to get a good protein source and poured it into 6 plastic cups for individual servings!

I did not care for this recipe. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because my kids ate them with glee, but they eat anything remotely sweet

Hubby and I loved this!!  Tasted just like a creamsicle.  Very easy to make.  I adjusted to 1 box of jello as I didn't have enough yogurt to make a full batch.  It didn't get real fluffy either but it was still good for sure.  Kids would not eat it but this isn't a big surprise.  Very picky kids.  Texture issues.  Not big jello fans to begin with.

So good. I used sugar free jello and put it in muffin tins. Kids and I want to make this over and over, maybe next time with fruit in it, although it may adjust the good consistency of the original recipe.

I thought this was fine. Really easy to make and tastes okay if you really just want something sweet and cold. My daughter liked it a lot. I put halved cherries in mine and made individual servings in a silicone muffin mould. Much easier to remove and prettier too. I'll make again just for the ease and kid-friendliness, and also to try different flavour-fruit combinations.

I raelly loved these.. used plain fat free yogurt and sugar free strawberry jello... delish. They froze up really quickly. I used a silicone pan and it popped out easily
