Sorry to complain, but I am questioning the measurements & directions for this recipe because it was a complete disaster.  Although the dough turned out wonderful and tasty (5*'s), the filling and streusel DID NOT!  TOO MUCH FILLING AND STREUSEL INGREDIENTS TURNED INTO SYRUP.  I think it needs to be cleared up as to whether the milk or creamer to be used is dry powder or liquid.  I used 2% milk instead of creamer as suggested, but it was NOT struesel.  The filling oozed out & burned on the baking sheet & even reduced the amount to 2/3's of the recommended amount.  I will use the dough recipe again, but will look for other filling & struesl recipes.
