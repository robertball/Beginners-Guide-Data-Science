I wasn't looking for a Paleo recipe but found this Ragu recipe and had to give it a try!  I made this as called for and it came out great!  It smells so good while simmering.  The Chef's notes talk about removing the pork chunks into a separate bowl to shred them and that was exactly what I did.  I served it over Tagliatelle pasta, but it is so good and thick that I could eat it with just a loaf of Italian bread!

Excellent dish!  The beautiful, earthy taste of the shitake mushrooms shines in this ragu.  The pork is so tender and delicious.  I actually used boneless ribs and browned them in small chunks.  Served it over fettuccine.  Fabulous!  Well worth the simmer time.  Thank you for sharing!

Just okay and definitely not worth the  4 hours to make it.
