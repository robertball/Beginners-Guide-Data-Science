Gone in minutes! Family loved this. I didn't put tortillas on bottom in fear of becoming soggy.Added jalapenos on just 1/2 the side over salsa for my son who loves heat. Served with bowls of shredded lettuce, chopped tomatos, sour cream, guacamole, and the SCOOP tortilla chips! No silverware even needed for this quick and easy dish. You can also spoon some on a flour tortilla and roll it up like a burrito.
Thanks for the great recipe!

While the meat cooked, I made a package of yellow rice and used that as a layer for a little more "substance".  Being 8 months pregnant and craving something mexican, this hit the spot!

Tasty and simple to make.  I put chopped fresh tomatoes and sour cream on top and served with torilla chips.  Also served a salad and had a complete meal.  The next day, we cut small pieces, approx. 1" x 3", heated them in the microwave, then placed them on large tortilla wraps, sprinkled a little cheddar cheese, tomatoes and sour cream, rolled them up and had instant burritos.  They were even better this way!

This is really great and easy.  I layer it with flour tortillas by spreading the tortilla with the beans and then start the layering process ending with cheese on top.  You can add corn or black olives for more variety.

So good and easy too! Top with sour cream and black olives. AWESOME! I have to make a suggestion though. Don't use the prepackaged taco seasoning. You've gotta try the recipe for "taco seasoning I" from this sight. IT MAKES IT!!

This was SO easy, and very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the result. I knew it was a hit when my very picky husband suggested that we have the leftovers the very next night. He loved it. Be sure to use a quality salsa that you love, because it is the prominent flavor in the dish.

I made this for a party, and everyone loved it!  The next time I make it, I will use a mild or hot salsa.  I would like a little bit more zip.  I added a final layer of sour cream, sprinkled with green onions and added a green onion garnish.  This went fast!

this was pretty basic.  i added a poblano, onion and garlic to the meat. i also spread the beans on the bottom of the dish rather than trying to put it over the meat.  

I wish I would have made rice and put that as a layer in there.  I topped it with shredded lettuce, black olives, sc and cilantro

**Low Carb Alternative**
I have recently been reducing my carbohydrate intake and have found great alternative. Instead of using the Beans you can use layers of frozen vegetables. I usually use a mix of carrots, zuchini, squash, red peppers, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower. (It all comes in the same bag) I also use the vegetables as the base layer instead of the meat, I then add the seasoned taco beef, cheese (taco flavored shredded is great!) and then I add the salsa. I continue to layer it and make my final layer cheese and bake it for about 15-20 minutes until the cheese is melted. Once complete I add little sour cream to the individual servings and it's delicious!! A great meal for a working mom, without a lot of time to prepare dinner.

Great!  Made an 8x8 instead of the 9x13.  Only one change: added 3 tortillas, bottom, middle and top, serving like a lasagna. Used a little less salsa and seasonings because my new husband is a spice feather-weight.  He ate the whole thing (minus my piece) during our day off together. Top-notch and soooo easy!!

I love to make my leftover taco bakes into taco salads with the addition of corn chips and russian dressing.  I know the combination sounds odd, but it really is delicious.  I usually don't add refried beans to mine..but I do have them on the side.  What's mexican food without the beans??Thanks Leslie.

This is very similar to my mom's taco casserole, but she unrolls and pats out a can of refrigerated crescent roll dough in the bottom of the casserole and tops the shredded cheese with crushed taco chips. I'd give it a five star with these (admittedly caloric) additions. We like to add chopped green chiles and black olives, but that's a matter of individual taste. It's yummy either way!

5 stars w/ modifications. I put down a layer of crushed nacho Cheese Doritos, mixed the beans, taco seasoning, and beef together and spread it over, pureed a jar of mild salsa (we hate chunks) and spread it on top, then added another light layer of crushed Doritos and extra-sharp finely shredded Cheddar. Next time (and there will be one!), I'll only use about 3/4 of the salsa - it was just slightly too soupy. Excellent recipe base!

When I ask the kids what they'd like for supper, they always say,"Taco Bake!".  They love this stuff.  I run the salsa through the blender, because none of us likes "chunks" in our food.  It's so easy that my 10 year old daughter made it for our family one night.

I was in a hurry to find something simple and quick to feed the family when I found this recipe. My 13 year old (aka the garbage disposal) could not get enough. My "particular" hubby said to print this one out and keep it. I did. Also, the recipe called for jar salsa, but I used some left over "spicey bean salsa" (from this site) and that just made it even better! Also, as another review suggested, I layered crunched up tortilla chips on the bottom. This goes into the "family favorite" list at our house!

Tastes just like tacos without the mess.  Warm up the beans in the micro before spreading.  My teenage son loves this fun food!

Very simple and tasty recipe!  I used a can of black beans instead of refried (drained but didn't rinse) and added about a 1/2 Cup chopped olives and a 1/2 Cup onions before the cheese layer.  It would be good with some canned corn too I think.  I served it hot with a dollup of sour cream and chips on the side.  It's delicious scooped up on a chip.

What a great recipe.  I made it the first time for a superbowl party this year.  It seemed to be well received, although I think I liked it best out of everyone.  It's so easy to make, which is the best part.  Sometimes I'll just make this for dinner and we'll sit down with a bowl of chips and chow down.  Never fails....

I modified this recipe slightly. I didn't have any salsa or refried beans. Instead, I used a blender to mix up a can of chili bens, a can of peeled and diced tomatoes, and a can of tomato sauce. I also added 1 cup of sour cream to the mixture. I also used cheddar and monterey jack cheeses. Turned out perfectly and VERY tasty. Definitely will make this one again.

This was very easy to prepare.  I put sour cream on top and used tortilla chips as utensils. I will use this one again and maybe use less seasoning for my husband.  He does not like it too spicey, but it was perfect for me.

This was easy and delicious. Came to me in my email just when I needed a good suggestion for ground beef.  I added a layer of slightly crushed tortilla chips between the beef and refried beans.  Was great.

This is a great recipe! Works for the whole family. Some tips, warm the beans as mentioned by someone else. Also, buy chunky salsa. If you use salsa with to much liquid it will make the final product runny. This is also good heated up the next day and wrapped in tortillas.

This is a very easy dish that takes almost no time.  We liked it quite a bit.  I crushed tortilla chips over mine and liked it that way better.

What a great idea - sort of like tacos but in a dip! I topped the dip with tomatoes, lettuce and jalapenos and served sour cream on the side.  I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes to the meat mixture. This was a hit with my family.

I made this last night and the whole family loved it.  I did make a couple of changes: I added a layer of crushed up tortilla chips on the bottom, then the meat.  I also combined the salsa with the beans and added some cheese, then spooned it over the meat.  I topped it with the remaining cheese and bake until the cheese browns.

My husband loves this since he is usually on a low carb diet. :) The kids and I also love it and usually mix it with some rice and put it on tortillas. It is good as written but you can jazz it up. My kids love corn in it and kidney beans instead of the refried for a change. Either way- this is good and easy and makes a filling meal with leftovers. If you don't want to put the rice in the casserole- just serve it with Spanish Rice and Taco fixings on the side. Delicious!

I probably shouldn't even be rating this, since I changed the recipe so much, but I think others might like these changes also.  I used ground turkey, Old El Paso cheesy taco mix (added water per package directions,) and used boxed spanish rice instead of the beans (family doesn't like beans.)  With these changes, the taco bake was delicious!  Served with sour cream and low fat tortilla chips.  I think the regular recipe would be 5 stars also!

Delicious!  Used ground venison and a chunky pico (I created using canned tomatoes with green chilies!).  Very simple to put together.  We ate it the first night as a dip with white corn chips.  I rolled leftover portions into flour tortillas, sprinkled with some cheese, then baked them in the oven.  We liked the 'burritos' better.

This was pretty good.  I browned onions with the ground beef and added black olives and a can of chiles.  I served with sour cream and tortilla chips.  It was a quick easy recipe which I will probably make again.

This is a good and filling dish.  There isn't anything really special about it, but the fact that it tastes good and takes hardly any time to make is outstanding.  I added green chiles like others, and actually omitted the beans.  I added taco sauce to the leftovers, and it tasted even better!!

This is a tasty and easy recipe.  I did not add the salsa.  After it baked and I let it sit for a few minutes I served it with bowls of salsa, sour cream, green onion on the side.  Served with the Baked Tortilla Chips from this site.  Excellent Mexican dinner.  Thanks

What a hit.  This went so fast and it was such an easy appetizer to prepare!  When layering in the pan I found it difficult to spread the beans over the beef.  I mixed the two and then finished layering.  This is a keeper.

I used ground turkey, light colby jack cheese and fat free refried beans to lighten it up. Since I was baby sitting a friends kids I let them use this as a dip with multigrain totsitios. It was tasty but I was at a loss as to what to serve with it. I will use it as a hot dip but itsn't practicle as a main dish.

Taco Bake I Haiku: "Pretty sloppy meal. But wow did it taste awesome! (Serve with rice or chips.)" This was a really liquid-ey, difficult dish to serve, so when I make it again, I'd plan on eating it over rice, or crumbled tortilla chips, or maybe scooped w/ a slotted spoon into tortillas. I used refried BLACK beans, a mexi-blend of cheese, and added a little sauteed garlic and onions to the meat. No major additions or substitutions, so I feel confident in calling this recipe an easy, tasty, (albeit, messy) dinner that I'd gladly prepare again.

I only had a pound of ground beef so used that and only had about a half a jar of salsa so used that all too. We all really enjoyed this. I bought the Scoops and placed the filling in each scoop and topped with cheddar and heated in the oven to melt the cheese. We all loved them.

I love to try new recipes rather than making the same dishes over and over.  There is a joke in my house that if my family says they like it, then I don't do it again (of course that is not true).  My husband said this last night after the first bite!  It was wonderful! The only change I made was to spray the bottom of the pan with olive oil spray and then put two tortillas on the bottom and spread the beans on top (as someone had suggested), spread half the meat, then the salsa, and repeated the layers. Put the cheese on top.  I will be adding this to my own "recipe" book!  Thanks for the recipe.

Good, simple and homey feeling food.  Tasted to me just like the inside of a burrito, but the whole family loved it.  I served it with Mexican Bean Salad from this site that is loaded with corn and bell peppers so it was a nice combination.  Thanks for the recipe :)

Based on another reviewer addition, I also added rice.  Plus I tossed in a can of corn.  It was incredible the way my family liked it!  I served it with both tortillas (for burrito style) and blue corn tortilla chips.

This is so delicious! My family gets so excited when I make this and the whole thing gets eaten every time! I changed just a few things. I added a 1/2 onion, finely chopped to the ground beef as it was browning, an extra can of refried beans and only 1/2 a jar of salsa and make it in a 9X9 pan. This amount is good for a family of 4. For more people, add 1 lb of ground beef, use 2 taco seasoning packets, 1 jar of salsa, 1 onion, make it in a 9X13 dish & always use lots of cheese!

This was great.  I served it with corn chips for a fast dinner one night and it was gobbled up.  It was even good as a left over for lunch.  Nice for those busy evenings when you need to slip something in the over quickly after being out at sporting events all evening.

Made this today for a pot luck - it was OK but not a giant hit.  After tasting it I decided that if I make this again I will saute some garlic and onion with the meat.  I used more taco seasoning than called for but the meat still needed some more flavor.  The only other change I made this time was to throw some sliced black olives on top.

I have made this for years--and I thought I invented it.  lol.  I have always included a couple layers of corn tortillas drizzled with a little canned enchilada (red) sauce.  I love cat's idea of the rice tho. It had never occurred to me.  I will try it next time with brown rice--Trader Joe's has a precooked/shelf-stable one in vacuum bags that will cut a huge ammt of time.  Thanks for the great ideas everyone.

Really good party food! I layered lettuce, tomatoes, diced onions, black olives, and jalepenos on top. Served with tortilla chips, sour cream, and extra salsa on the side. Everyone devoured this in minutes.

This is very good and so easy to make.  I'm not sure why other reviews say it's "runny", because I had the opposite problem:  mine turned out very substantial.  The changes I made were using very lean ground beef and cheddar cheese.  Next time I think it would be good to add a layer of chopped fresh tomatoes or diced canned tomatoes.
I would make this again.  Thank you!

I made this for Super Bowl.  Everyone raved about it.  I topped it with olives, green onions, tomatoes and extra cheese.  It was great!  Next time I think I will mix the beans with the meat.

This was very easy to make.  My husband, myself and my older daughter liked it and all had seconds.  The younger wouldn't eat it, but it's hard to find anything she'll eat.  

I did make a few changes.  I used a can of light red kidney beans instead of the refried beans and I added two bags of the boil in a bag rice before I baked it to give it more substance.

So easy and tasty!  Would be perfect for a pitch-in or buffet.  I used the taco seasoned shredded cheddar cheese for extra flavor, and sprinkled some crushed dried cilantro on top to perk up the appearance and flavor.  Top with sour cream after serving.  Use the new Gold tortilla chips that are extra sturdy for dipping or use the tortilla scoop or frito scoop chips for best results.

YUM! one of our favorite recipes. i make this in an 8x8 square dish, double the beans and cut way down on the meat. I use turkey instead of beef. We like it with shredded lettuce and sour cream.

I made this for the first time last night for
some friends, and everyone LOVED it!  I added
onions to the beef as some people suggested, and
definitely heating the beans first was a good
hint.  Also added black olives.  Served it with
tortilla chips and guacamole on the side.  YUMMY!

A big hit with my husband! I added chopped onions to the hamburger, used a cheddar/Monterey Jack cheese mixture, and cooked it a little longer at 350 degrees. Next time I will add a layer of chopped black olives.

This recipe went over big with my honey.  I added chopped onions with the ground beef.  Before putting in 13 x 9 baking dish, I added a small can of Mexicorn.  This really added to the recipe.  I used medium, chunky salsa.  I served it with warm, plain tortilla chips.  I have been asked to make this recipe again for a gathering this weekend.  ENJOY!

Made this for NYE. It was a success. Served with tortilla chips. Only issue I had was I forgot to get the picture.
Made it again for the Superbowl. My family loves to eat this as a dip with tortilla chip scoops. I added some shredded lettuce to top their scoops and it was so good!!!

This was very good. I made this to bring to a friends. I increased the servings to 10 which was 2 lbs of ground beef. I added 2 full cans of diced tomatoes & 2 packs of taco mix & increased the water. Not much of a change. I omitted the sour cream because my Husband & I don't like it. Served Tostito scoops on the side. Came our great & everyone liked it!

I made it just like it said.....but I served it with a lot of extras---shredded lettuce, diced fresh tomatoes, black olives, fresh avacado, sour cream!  So delightful with all the trimmings!  Like a taco in a casserole.

One of my kids does not like salsa and another does not like tomatoes. So I secretly mixed about 1/2 cup to 2 cans of beans before spreading beans over beef. I added corn across top of cheese (to give a veggie) and crushed tortilla chips after baking on top of casserole. I placed guacamole and sour cream additional salsa for options of who wanted. This was so simple and great this recipe is going to my box.

Wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars!  I had thawed out my hamburger, planning on having a family favorite recipe, and then realized that I was missing an ingredient..  It wasn't too long before my husband would be home, and I had a really hungry 18 year old, who had also just come home from work. What to do?! I got on Allrecipes web site, and found this recipe, and I had all the ingredients!  Everyone was agreeable, and so away we went!  The only changes I made, were to tear up a tortilla and put it at the bottom, then put 1/2 the meat.  I only had a 28 oz. can of refried beans, and I used nearly the whole can.  I put a layer of beans, then the salsa.  I got 2 layers in my dish, and topped it with a mixture of cheddar and mozz.  We loved it!  My son went back for seconds, and he took more on the 2nd time than he did the first!  My husband at his, and then ate what I couldn't eat.  Our son is taking all of the leftovers to work today.  This is definitely a keeper, and thank you to whoever posted this recipe!  You saved my bacon, so to speak, and we really love it, and will be making it again soon!

This was very good and very quick. The only thing I did different was not adding the salsa until after it cooked. I dont care for warm salsa, just a personal choice.

I used ground turkey and refried beans with Jalapenos.  I then had garnishes of tomatoes, lettuce, onions, sour cream, and black olives with Jalapenos, on the side.  I laid out chips and flour tortillas, and let everyone choose to use the dish as a dip, as a burrito, or as nachos.  They loved it!  Everyone was happy and full!  I also used the Taco Seasoning I on this site.  I have a feeling that this recipe is going to be another favorite!

This was good - but almost better as a dip than a meal.  We ate it with tortilla chips and it was great!

This was great!  I was low on dinner supplies but this totally fit what I had!  I didn't include the refried beans because I didn't have any, but it was still great- possibly better b/c my husband isn't a huge r.f. bean fan.  I served it with tortilla chips, but tried it with just a fork too- either way is great.  Reheated well too!

I give this a four star rating for chip dip, but this is not an entree by any means.  Yummy chip dip though :-)

This was so easy!  I made mine a little healthier by 1 pound of ground chicken mixed with one can of corn (drained) instead of the beef, used fat free refried beans, and on 1 cup of reduced fat cheese.  Although it was runnier than I anticipated, it was still very tasty :)  I also added some onion and made my own taco seasoning (less salt).  We ate this with tortillas kinda like a burrito.  Rice would be a nice addition.

We loved this! The only change I made was to use Taco Seasoning 1 by Bill Echols from this site because I dont use package taco seasoning anymore. Quick and easy! I will be making this again.

My son loves this recipe.  The first couple times I made it as the recipe as is then I changed a few things which made it way better.  One, more meat is definitely needed at least 2 or 2.5 lbs to offset the other ingredients. After browning the meat and adding the seasoning, I mix in half the can of refried beans,half of the salsa, and some of the cheese (you can add more or less of these ingredients according to your liking and how much meat you used).  Then I mix it on the stovetop melting the cheese.  I put the meat mixture in the pan (w/o the cheese) and bake it about 20 minutes, then add some cheese to the top layer and bake the last ten minutes so the cheese on top isn't burned.  To me this is way better than layers.  The flavors blend together very well.  I definitely prefer this way better!

Quick and easy, although I made a few modifications.  I always cook my ground beef with the taco seasoning - so the meat ends up a little more flavorful - and add a chopped onion and can of green chiles.  I layer the beans on the bottom, followed by Spanish rice, meat, salsa then cheese.  Top with sour cream and serve with chips for dipping.  Tastes great!

Very easy! I chopped up an onion and cooked it with the meat. I layered the beans first (much easier to spread evenly:), meat, salsa, japelenos and juice, olives, and cheese. I had Doroitos, tortillas, lettuce, and tomatoes on the side. I enjoyed dipping the chips in the bake as well as crumbling them on top of the bake in the tortilla! Simple, great dish. Will become one of my regulars!

This is a good basic starter recipe. I used a mix of chopped jalapenos, red and black beans for the bottom layer. Then added the rice mixed with the enchilada sauce, and then layered the hamburger spiced with chili powder, garlic powder, and ground cumin(smells and tastes just like taco seasoning). This gives the taste of taco seasoning without the orange oily, greasy taste,and all the additional chemicals. I topped it with cheddar and cooked it in the oven until it was hot and the cheese melted. Then I just added some chopped onion, salsa, lettuce and sour cream for the toppings. My dad just couldn't leave it alone. I served it with chips on the side. It's not the most nutritious thing, but it's not junk food either and it cooks up quickly, and some nights that's what you need.

This certainly can be prepared quickly but I do not consider this an entree.  It would make a good appetizer.  Originally, I rated this four stars but reworking the recipe the second time I have to boost it up to five.  The second time I made it I added an additional 1/2 package of taco seasoning and a can of mild chiles.  I increased the refried beans to 2 cans and added additional cheese.  Served with sour cream and black olives it was delish.  So what if I don't consider it an entree as long as my family does, who cares.

Easy and tasty.  I took the advice of others and made Mexican rice and added that to the recipe.  I used tortillas, lettuce,sour cream and diced tomatoes on the side and it was a hit. Perfect finger food -- thanks for the recipe!

My family gobbled this up last night! I too made a few minor modifications - my son hates refried beans, so I replaced with black beans. Also, I crunched up a few corn chips in the bottom of the pan before spreading the meat. Served with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and more corn chips as garnish and they said MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN!!

I made this for a thanksgiving pitch-in at work.  I thought I'd be able to take the leftovers to another gathering that evening, boy was I wrong!  Then next time that I made this, though, I mixed the beans in with the meat.  Much easier, and just as tasty!

What a great recipe.  Didn't try it on any kids but think they would love that.  You could easily put lettuce and tomatoes on top.

My husband really liked this recipe.  He wants it again soon.  I was happy that it was so easy and quick to make.  I also used chunky salsa, and wished I had warmed up the refried beans, but I managed.  Thanks for offering your yummy recipe.  (I think it tasted like a mexican pizza from Taco Bell minus the layers of friend tortilla bread)

This is a great starter recipe that could be added too easily according to taste.  I would add onions and jalepeno and green peppers next time I make it. Good warmed up the next day too!

This was very good.  Even my husband, "Mr. Put Tabasco Sauce On Everything" thought the basic recipe was a "good start".  Next time I make it, he's requested hot salsa and some jalapeno peppers on top.  I don't particularly care for spicy food and it was just right for me.  It was still good the next day when I warmed the leftovers for a quick lunch.

This dish is wonderful.  My pickiest eater actually had a second helping. You may want to warm the beans in the microwave for a couple of minutes to make the beans easier to spread.  I also substituted a 5 cheese mixture in place of the jack.

I just made this last night on a whim. While it is easy to make and very filling it's pretty basic and doesn't really have enough going on as far as taste goes. However it becomes exceptionally good with a few simple and cheap additions. I would suggest adding a layer of saffron rice over the beans before baking, and then topping the finished product with diced tomatoes and sour cream.

It was good, it was easy. I wanted a little more kick so I only used half the salsa called for and added hot taco sauce. I garnished with romaine lettuce and black olives. It was missing something. I can't put my finger on it, but it was.

This was great! I included a layer of cilantro lime rice before the salsa, and the bottom layer was corn tortillas with re-fried beans on them. Next time I will mix the beans and beef, they were hard to spread. This went quickly.

Excellent dish. This dish is excellent as it is, but I think you can make it seem different by adding to it. Next time I may add rice or corn or add black beans.

eww! I, nor did my family, care for this dish.  It was low in the taste factor and the visual appeal didn't rate much higher.  Perhaps, it could be used for a dip, but not a main dish. I won't fix this again.

One of our favorites.  I add a canned spanish rice (sounds weird, but works great, just be sure to drain a little) and black beans.  I also saute some onions and garlic before adding the meat.  We eat it with tortillas, fast and easy!

This was great!  I put the beans on the bottom layer and added extra taco seasoning to the beef.  I served it with sour cream, chips, and lettuce.  It was a hit!

we thought this was good as a dip for chips.  Did not think it was as good as a cassarole type/main entree.  I will add a layer of guacamole next time I make as a dip.

So easy and so good! I thought it was a bit too much cheese so you might want to cut back on that a bit.  Served it with shredded lettuce, salsa, chips and guac and it was a huge it!  Thanks!!!

I make this recipe but we call it mexican dip.  I spread a can of refried beans mixed with 1/4 bottle taco sauce on the bottom of the pan.  Refried beans are hard to spread so on the bottom is easier, then the ground beef mixed with an envelope of the taco seasoning (according to directions on the envelope), then cheese, sliced black olives, chopped tomatoes, and shredded lettuce on the top - bake til bubbly at edges.  Soooo good....

This was pretty good and a little different for a change instead of nachos or tacos. I added chopped onions to the beef, and next time I'll probably add some jalapenos to the bake to make it a little spicier!

Talk about simple! This was very easy, quick and tastey.  I eliminated the salsa because I was serving it to kids to do not like anything with chunks of tomatoes.

This recipe was not runny at all, but I did use thick salsa.  I found it to be kinda bland, but it was a hit at my superbowl party.  I will definitely use again when in need of a quick appetizer.

Delish!  This is so simple.  We had it topped with lettuce and sour cream, and scooped with taco shells broken in half.  But you could top with tomatoes, black olives, jalapenos, on and on...
Thanks Leslie!

This recipe tasted fine, but there seemed to be something missing.  With the consistency being so thin it almost seemed like a dip rather than a casserole.

Left out the beans and topped with crushed chips and jalapeno slices after I saw the kids weren't eating it. This is more suitable for an appetizer, not a main dish. I cannot imagine eating this as the main course.

Delish! I jazzed it up a bit by adding diced onion and a can of diced green chiles to the seasoned beef mixture. I also added a layer of crushed tortilla chips on the bottom of the baking dish. (Don't recommend this, as it makes the chips gummy.) Five minutes before the baking time ended, I topped with chopped fresh tomato, green onion, and more green chiles. Thanks for the inspiration, this one's definitely a keeper!

This is a really easy recipie to follow.  I see it more as an appetizer than an actual dinner.  But, I used the taco bake as a filler for soft tortilla shells and added some lettuce and tomato and that turned out great! Overall, it's a good recipie.

Delicious but heavy.  Don't forget a green salad to offset it.    
I found I was out of salsa so I had to substitute with a jar of Taco Bell taco sauce.  Yummy.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and topped the cheese with olives.  After it was done baking I put avocado slices on each piece as a garnish.  I will definately be serving this one again.

This is a great hit with my husband.  He requests it often..  I use corn instead of beans to make it more kid friendly and low-sodium taco seasoning and torilla chips to cut down on salt.

It tastes fine and I added a layer of spanish rice.  However, after having to cook the meat, rice, and heat up the beans I don't think its worth dirtying up another dish.  So, my family will stick with taco salad (same ingredients just not baked together) and get the added benefits of including lettuce and any other veggies desired.

So easy and delicious!   I didn't brown the top that much because I will be reheating the leftovers in the oven, so they'll brown more then.

Great starter recipe! I added rice to my taco meat and used about 1/4 jar of salsa. I also spread the beans on tortillas as my bottom layer. My family loved it!!

I used the taco seasoning recipe on here vs store bought pkg, as one reviewer suggested, as my husband has to watch his sodium intake. Used ground turkey and  Had black beans left over from another recipe so layered those on top of  of ground turkey  . Lined the balking dish with corn tortillas I baked for about 15 min until they were crunchy and it was a wonderful and tastee  meal!

I did make a few changes however. I put a box of Jiffy@ cornbread in and bake it first then put all ingredients over the cornbread. Then i substituted American Cheese Slices for shredded pepper jack(I was out). Was very flavorful and added picante sauce when served. Everyone loved it!!!

I made this tonight because my family is eating low carb. My husband liked this, my son thought it was ok and I was not impressed. There is certainly something missing and this needs more seasoning. Perhaps some cornbread dumplings on top and more seasonings would make this better.

Easy, cheap and yummy! I made a few changes...I mixed all the ingredients together plus added olives and corn and used black beans instead of refried (to make it more healthy). I lined the bottom of the pan with tortillas then I layered with my "mixture". It was a big hit!

A very quick and filling app.  I put pickled jalapenos on the top as "decoration."  This is even better the next day.  I usually scoop the leftovers into taco shells, and eat it like a soft taco topped with cheese and sour cream.

This receipe is alright, though nothing fantastic or creative. It's basically taco dip. I found it really helpfull to make as a full meal by adding two cups frozen corn, and layering with tortilla chips before baking. Makes a WONDERfull texmex casserole.

Nice alternative to traditional tacos. I used ground turkey, browned it my cast iron skillet, drained the fat, and layered all the ingredients over the meat. Then I baked it all in the same skillet. It was a very nice one-dish meal.

Really good! This was excellent. I served sour cream on the side and as another reviewer suggested, made my own taco seasoning similar to "Taco Seasoning 1". A little spicy that way but most of us love spicy.

My whole family liked this recipe. We ate it in tortilla shells, as a dip with chips, or just plain. It was good with sour cream on it as well. I doubled the beans though. Easy and tasty.

This recipe was supposed to be an easy, inexpensive meal for my boyfriend and I one lazy tuesday night, and it turned into his favorite meal!!! He is a huge taco/burrito/nacho fan, and after eating this dish two nights in a row, he confessed that if we could have this readily available in the freezer, he would never go to another mexican resturant again!!
I just had to write and say how helful the other reviewers were, as I opted to mix the meat, rice, salsa, and cheese together and then bake (rather than layering). We ate the mix in a soft tortilla shell as a burrito, and also with chips as nachos to eat the next night.
I never thought such a simple meal would turn into a household favorite...but it was really a huge hit! Thanks for reminding me I don't need a 20-ingredient meal to make a delicious dinner. What a relief!

My husband and I loved this recipe!!  We really like spicy food, so we added some crushed red peppers while browning the meat, then after we layered in the ingredients, sprinkled some Texas Pete on top before the cheese was added.  We also left out the beans, and serve it with the Fritos "scoops" as sort of a dip! One time we were out of ground turkey, so we used sausage! Delicious!!  One of our weekly meals.

SUPER easy and very good.  Easy to manipulate to make it spicy or mild based on inividual preferences.  I used the Taco Seasoning recipe from this site, mixed the beef and beans together in the skillet and then layered it on top of some tortilla chips in the bottom of an 8x8 dish.  Topped it with teh salsa and a 4 cheese mexican blend and it couldn't have been easier!  Served with sour cream and it was devoured during dinner!

I absolutely loved this!  It's almost too easy and good to be true.  I'm pregnant, and I'm craving mexican food on a daily basis so having the leftovers was pure bliss.  I have a feeling this will be my little boy's favorite once he gets here :-) Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

This is a really good recipe but not 5 stars.  I served it as an appetizer for 3 people with chips one day and used the leftovers with lettuce,tomatoes and sauce rolled into tortillas the next day for lunch.  Yummy!  Thanks.

This is really more of an appetizer than a meal to me.  It was nice to have on hand for a quick dinner to throw together quickly, but I don't think I'll have any other use for it.

My husband and family really like this.  The only thing I might change is that I would put some flour tortillas on the bottom to soak up the juice and give it a little bit more flavor.  I also cut up veggies and put sour cream on top when it was done.  The other option is to put crunched up tostio chips on top.

Easy, quick, and delicious. What more could I ask for? I added a drained can of Rotel and a drained 4 ounce can of diced chilis, and it came out nice and spicy. Also, this is a relatively low carb recipe, so it can be part of a diabetic's food plan without too much trouble.

Tacos are one of my favorite food. This just didn't get me as excited as regular tacos does. I will certainly eat it and make it again if someone asks for it, but I  just didn't go yummmmmmmm.

Really good!  Made a yummy Sunday night "quick" dinner - served with tortilla chips.  I preferred corn tortillas and just scooped some in for a quick soft taco!  A salad on the side goes great.  My suggestion - use a 30 oz. can of refried beans and half a jar of salsa worked for us.  Not too thick or runny!  Thanks!

This was great! So easy to make and my husband loved it.  Mine wasn't runny at all.  I only used enough salsa to spoon a thin layer over the beans, that might have made a difference.

I certainly didn't have the problem that some others had with this being runny.  On the contrary, mine was very thick.  That's the only reason I held back a star.  We had to use spoons to spoon it onto our tortilla chips because they broke when we tried to scoop with them.  The flavor was good though and I will probably make this again.

Very good!  I used cheddar instead of montery jack because I had it on hand.  We used tortilla chips and wheat thins on the side.  My two year old loved it too!  Great recipe!  Thank you for posting!

Serving this dish over tortilla chips and shredded lettuce is a must - without that it would seem like we were eating plain taco meat!  I also added corn to the mix which we liked.
