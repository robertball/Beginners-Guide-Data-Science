Good sandwich that I've been making for years but to save calories and trans fat I use peanut butter that's made w/o hydrogenated oil (there isn't a difference in taste), and use one of those $10 sandwich makers.  It doesn't require butter because it actually toasts the sandwich.  It melts the peanut butter and jelly and tastes so good that you won't notice that there isn't any type of butter on the outside.  And, you'll feel good because you saved yourself a few extra calories.

Oh man, you guys are killin' me out there! When one is a peanut butter junkie and is also trying to diet, one should never, ever read any kind of review that contains this creamy indulgence. My first mistake was reading the recipe itself when I came across it. My second mistake was then reading the reviews! Up until then it was "do I, or don't I"? Thanks to "MC MA of 3's" review (the woman's a bad influence on me) I just couldn't resist! Before I knew it, I was in the kitchen grilling this baby up. I must say though, that after inhaling it, I felt absolutely no remorse! Chastity, I don't know whether to thank you or not for submitting this amazing little sandwich recipe because now I know I'll never get back to my diet! DELICIOUS!!!!

Don't know why I took a Home Ec course in 7th grade in 1965...guess I wanted something easy just for the credit as I had been cooking and baking for several years already and didn't need this basic instruction. So the class, as I suspected, was boring (but fun) for me. We made some pretty basic recipes, none of them particularly memorable. But it speaks volumes that this simple twist on a basic PB&J sandwich left such an impression on me after all these years. I will NEVER forget that first bite... As with many other things in life, the more simple things are often the best.

Love it!! The only thing my son can cook and he made this JUST yesterday.  I had to laugh at the reviewer who subbed the peanut butter with turkey and the jelly with cheese.  That was the funniest review I've ever read.

I'm an admitted peanut butter addict and love to find new ways to eat the stuff and boy was this good!  Sometimes the simplest things in life turn out to be some of the best and this was no exception.  If you love peanut butter and jelly sanwiches give this a try, you'll be glad you did.  Definitely have an ice cold glass of milk handy...

Are you kidding me?? Who thinks of recipes like this? I never in a million years would have thought of toasting my PBJ sandwich. This was absolutely delicious with PB just dripping right out of it! I'm not sure I could ever eat a regular one again!

A good way to turn "same ol'" into "sinful." I highly recommend using tablespoons instead of teaspoons for the measurements of peanut butter and jelly. If you're watching fat intake (if you are, why are you eating peanut butter anyway?), you can get good results by leaving out the butter and grill and just popping the sandwich into a toaster oven.

As it stands these sandwiches are great. And yes it is a recipe because I personally had forgotten how good these are. Stop rating recipes if you aren't making them. I know it pesters a lot more allrecipe members other than just myself.

MMMMM-a nice twist on an old stand by.  When I was pregnant with my daughter I craved PB&J on toast and ate it EVERY day...why I didn't think of this is beyond me.  I added sliced bananas on top of the pb.  Very rich, but very good thanks Chasity.

WOW!  What a surprise. Just thought I would try it, and it was good.  My nine year old wanted nothing to do with it (She wanted just a regular sandwich), so I made it for my 3 year old.  He liked it, so I asked for a taste.  Yum! Then my, nine year old daughter wanted to taste it.  She liked it too, and wanted a grilled one too.  But we were out of peanut butter.  Now she is upset that she has to wait until tomorrows lunch to have one. I will make again. I didn't follow ingredient amounts, just buttered and grilled my regular PB sandwich.

Holy mother of....!! this is truly fabulous.  I never knew a sandwich could be like this.  I made mine with peanut butter on both slices and sliced banana in-between.  If the butter's  hard like mine you can just put a little pat down on the pan and turn the sandwich to cover the bottom.  Had with a glass of cold milk.  So good I had to call my boyfriend in the middle of the day to inform him I'd had a religious experience.

I made these thinking they would be terriffic - after all, I love any type of grilled sandwich.  I was disappointed.  The peanut butter and jelly oozed out and warm jelly just didn't do it for me.  Hubby was equally unimpressed.  I guess I like the original plain old PB&J's.  Thanks for posting anyway, Chasity.

Absolutely delicious.  I took this decadent recipe one step farther and used raisin bread instead of the usual white or wheat.  Absolutely wonderful.  This is also very good with cream cheese and jelly on raisin bread.  Thanks for the inspiration.

We love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches but wanted something slightly different. This was great twist. I used Skippy’s Creamy Peanut Butter with Strawberry Jam and some with Guava Jelly. Oh my goodness! Who would have thought that just buttered and grilled PBJ sandwich would be so scrumptious. It was just warm, creamy, ooey, gooey, sweet and delicious! So simple and yet so satisfying! This was great with a cold glass of milk but I would most likely make this again with tomato soup to make it more of a complete meal.

This is a really great sandwich - just the way the recipe calls for it.  I understand some people adding cinnamon or raisin bread or whatever to suit their own taste. It's not like this is something you eat every day.  It's a treat - a "once-in-awhile" treat.  Enjoy it, for goodness sakes. Why suffer through the drab greasy taste of Pam when you can have the bright creamy taste of butter.  It's only a dab or two!!  Relax and enjoy!!

Even though I was sure at age 10 (40+ years ago, ahem. Yes, I am old haha) that I had "invented" this recipe, I had to give it five stars because I know how delicious it is! :) If you're worried about calories; use no sugar added jam, and all natural peanut butter, then spray the bread with pan spray instead of butter. It's not *quite* the same, but still pretty darn good!

I must say that this was very tasty, and something that I had never considered doing before. It wasn't incredible or anything that special, though, to warrant five stars. It was fun to make it once, but my daughter and I could both care less whether or not we ever make them again. Basically, it's just a peanut butter and jelly sandwich made into something a little bit more special. Thanks for posting it.

I've been making this sandwich for myself and whoever I could convince to try it since I was a teenager. YUM YUM YUM!!!!! If you love peanut butter and jelly, you MUST try this. Words can't express the deliciousness that is "Grilled Peanut Butter and Jelly".

As a child, this was one of our favorite sandwiches. I still get a craving for one now and then. Just remember to be careful when you take the first bite, because the jelly gets very hot.

you can make it easier, by just toasting your bread in the toaster... and applying the peanut butter right away while your toast is still hot.  It gets all melted and gooey, quickly... add your jelly if you want and eat while it's still warm.  Delish!   Just thought to share a toasted PB&J that I have been making since I was a kid, and now my girls do the same.  **because I did not actually make this recipe/grill my sandwich, and I have to rate it, I gave it a 3**

i like to use fresh fruit like thin sliced strawberries, any other kind of bush berry, banana, thin slice apple... the grilling makes it like a peanut butter- fresh fruit pie!

Oh baby! I make these all the time and it's the only way I eat this sandwich. I use wheat bread and strawberry jam. When I'm too lazy to use a pan,I use butter flavor spray on top of the bread and pop it in my toaster oven. Also great with a banana if you don't have jam. Gotta have this with a glass of milk.

I can't say there was anything wrong with this but I don't think it was for me (just a matter of taste).  I baked my sandwich since I don't have a good grill anymore.  Watch out for hot jelly - hot sugar is super hot!  Thanks for the idea.  I made this and ate it on National Peanut Butter and Jelly Day.

Oh dear.  I feel sorry for everyone who has to watch their weight and calories, I really do.  Due to lives of moderation and eating healthfully, my kids and I were able to really enjoy this treat without any guilt whatsoever.  We thought it was delicious, and will make again.  I will just say that for me, four minutes per side was too long ... maybe I had the heat up too high (was at medium).

Bummer, you put up this recipe before I could! The only thing I suggest is if you like this, try a grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich. They are both AMAZING. Just make sure to use the spatula to squish the sandwich down, it makes a world of difference. mmmm.

The hot peanut butter and jelly run out all over the place and burn my fingers and make a mess.  I'll just have my PB&J on toast if I want it hot.

Wow, I actually didn't really like this.  I love grilled pb and banana sandwiches.  I love regular pb&j sandwiches, but something about the hot jelly on this kind of grossed me out.  I think part of it is that the recipe calls for twice as much jelly as peanut butter.  It'd probably be better to reverse that.  I'm sure this is just a matter of taste that I didn't like this so don't let my review scare you off...plenty of other reviewers seemed to enjoy this quite a bit.  Thanks for the recipe anyway!

Grilled PB& J sandwich?! Are you crazy?! Who thinks of these things?! 
I face palmed myself when I saw this... I ran to the pantry and fridge and grabbed what I needed. Must try this now! So I was standing over my pan while it was heating up trying to determine how I could put PB on one side of the bread and butter on the other without making a HUGE mess when I thought (insert another face palm) "melt the butter in the pan instead of spreading it on the outside". I can be a genius too sometimes! Did a quick spritz of nonstick spray just to make sure nothing stuck just to spite me, melted the butter, one slice of bread with PB on it went in, slice with jelly topped it-- waited impatiently to flip-- slid spatula under sandwich and melted more butter into the pan and then flipped the sandwich back into the pan jelly slice down. It is done now and I am waiting for it to cool slightly. Though I have a slight headache now, I am sure the cold milk and AWESOME sandwich will make me feel better. 
**mental note to self** Needs more PB & J (bread absorbed a lot of it)!

Super Yummy!  The buttery crunch of grilled cheese with the deliciousness of peanut butter and jelly!  I find it easier to assemble a regular PB&J sandwich, butter one side and put in on the skillet, then butter the other side.  Then the butter doesn't get all over my plate & hands.  Great recipe!

I have used this recipe for years, however, I use JAM rather than jelly and recently I've started 'buttering' the bread with real mayonnaise instead of the butter-much more even browning. A word of caution: THE JELLY OR JAM STAYS HOT FOR A VERY LONG TIME-- BE CAREFUL WHEN SERVING THIS SANDWICH TO CHILDREN.

This was too weird to me. I didn't care much for it. It was like combining the taste of a grilled cheese sandwich and a pb&j together. I even followed the exact amount of peanut butter and jelly, as little of an amount as the peanut butter seemed. I bet most kids would love it though.

You would not believe how DELICIOUS something so simple could be! This is so easy and quick, but it is AMAZING. The peanut butter really gets a crispy taste and fantastic texture. Try it out, you've got nothing to lose!

my 10 year old nephew "invented" this when they found out he was alergic to milk.  he was a grilled cheese junkie and needed a replacement.  he like it with bananas and no jelly but LOTS of butter for grilling.  reminds me of Elvis.

There is another version of this (equally yummy).  Instead of buttering the outside of the bread....just make the peanut sandwich like you normally would, and then dip the whole sandwich into an egg and milk batter that you would dip french toast into.  Then brown on a griddle like you would french toast.  Of course, with pb&j you cant go wrong.

We have been doing this for years, in the pancake side of a griddle (squashed flat).   Only instead of jelly we put in chocolate chips,  and sometimes marshmallow fluff.   Yum, Yum.

Great sandwich, where has it been all my life. Growing up on PB & J sandwiches but never thought to grill them. I am sure there are numerous ways to change up this sandwich. I prefer them with bananas in the middle.

I have been making this sandwich for YEARS! All of my friends think I am crazy when I mention this being one of my faves. I am so glad to see it posted. Just to add a little twist to this sometimes I add a little red onion. Don't judge me, try it!

It was delicious! I melted the butter in the skillet instead of spreading it (like I do w/ grilled cheese) on the bread...worked just as well. Also, I had it with extra crunchy peanut butter and it was great.

Oh my gosh! So delicious! Here's a tip- instead of using butter, just use no stick spray to spray onto the backs of your sandwich for an easy alternitive. But this was one of the most simply delicious things I've ever tasted!!! I could eat it again and again and again...and again!

I grew up eating these, but we do it like this at my house... toast the bread and spread each piece with jam and pb, press together and eat. Much easier than grilling in a skillet.

Things that I always do when making grilled PB&J 1) mix cinamon with the butter before spreading it on the outside of the bread. 2) use the peanutbutter with honey in it, and mix cinamon with that. 3) dust it with powdered sugar after grilling it. Sometimes, too, i make it double layered. Which. Is. AMAZING!

This was so gross! I couldn't get my little boy to eat it. He tried it and wouldn't touch it again. So I thought I should give it a shot and see if he was just pulling my leg and it was so disgusting, I wanted to gag. I did, however, also make a grilled PB & honey sandwich and it was really, really good.

omg! my new fav go-to sammy! i use natural almond butter and homemade low-sugar no-cook raspberry freezer jam. it's wonderful on killer grain bread but is elevated to a new level when grilled. thanks for reminding me of ways to spiff up an otherwise ordinary sandwich.

This is the best way to eat PB&J - instead of cooking mine on a grill however, I put it in the toaster oven - a few minutes on one side, flip, then a few minutes on the other. Saves using the butter, dirtying a pan and tastes just as yummy.

My mom always made these for us, and I've converted several naysayers over the years myself. Just be careful and let it cool a bit before eating, because the hot peanut butter and jelly tends to become like burning hot lava. But really yummy burning hot lava, at least.

This was just great.  I never thought of grilling a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  
I did a whole papering in college on peanut butter and jelly sandwich .And I didn't see this recipe before.  I didn't use butter, I used "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray.

This wasn't bad! I didn't use the exact measurements as written. I just used enough of the butter and peanut butter mixture to cover the bread and to my liking. I didn't have separate jars for the peanut butter and grape jelly, all I had was the already mixed up kind so that's what I used. I won't be making this every time I want a PB&J sandwich but it was pretty good! Thank you!

I tried this recipe and did not enjoy it. Neither did my family. I infinitely prefer my usual simple method of toasting one piece of bread, spreading it with peanut butter and then putting dollops of jelly on top of that same piece of bread.

I, like most of you, didn't use the "recommended amounts".  Just make PBJ like you normally would. If you don't like the molten innards oozing out, or are too impatient to let it cool, cook it on HIGH heat for 30-45 seconds on each side; the innards will be just warmed.

This is the best! And the great part is that you really don't need to measure. Just spread your pb and j, and spread butter on the bread and toast to perfection. Works every time. :)

I've made this before and excited to hear how impressed people are on this twist to a traditional pb&j. Inspired me to share my personal twist... Maybe I'll eventually take a photo and post the recipe. Exact same prep and ingredients, except swap out the bread for flour tortillas. Pb&j"illa" (as opposed to quesadilla). Cooked over a pan or in a griddle. I discovered it out of necessity and need to be resourceful with what I had in my pantry. Thought I'd share my twist!

I was craving something different for breakfast for the fam.. and I opened my mail box and lord and behold Grilled PB&J... we are a family that loves our PB&J... so i made it for breakfast this morning and my 10 year old stated you make the most AWESOME stuff... (thanks to AllRecipes) my whole entire menu is based off this site.. but needless to say I was a big hit this morning, and when her dad came home she couldn't help but brag it up about what she got and he didn't.. needless to say I'm off to the kitchen again :)

I rarely write a review, but this doesn't work and yet so many have given it such a high score.  Here is the problem:  Peanut butter is not made to be cooked like this.  It breaks down into it's oil base and just burns you.  The nutty flavor is diminished.  The jelly liquifies.  The best way to do a hot PB&J is to toast the bread first, spread the butter thinly and then spread on the P & J to your liking.  The peanut butter will lightly thin this way giving you a better mouth-feel and the jelly will stay relatively firm.

I prefer to place it in a George Foreman. And if you love cheese add a slice of American cheese in the middle and it's out of this world! Great recipe! Nothing beats PB and J!

What a trip down memory lane. My mom used to make these for my brothers and I all the time when we were growing up. Our friends used to think it was "weird" when they were offered a "grilled" peanut butter & jelly sandwich, until they tried one. My kids and now my grandchildren are fans of the Grilled PB&J. My personal preference is to use sourdough bread in place of just regular white bread.  However I prefer my grilled cheese sandwiches on sourdough also.

I am a grandmother myself, but I grew up on a variation of this sandwich.  My daddy had a very limited appetite of meat or fish and potatoes, but he loved a grilled PB&J with BACON in the middle!!!  Try it sometime, it is delicious.  Just make sure the bacon is well done and place it between the bread slices before grilling.

Back when I was a teenager, I found a recipe similar to this one that I used to make for my younger sister.  However, we wound up modifying in a way that made it even more yummy--WARNING, though, it is NOT a healthy recipe.  Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread (I would use more like 1 TB); top with your choice of 2 tsp jelly (I like the classic grape).  Butter the other slice of bread and then sprinkle with approximately 1 tsp. sugar and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon (or a cinnamon/sugar blend).  Place the two halves together, PB&Y touching cinnamon/sugar mix.  Then, lightly butter the outsides of the sandwich; grill until nicely browned.  DELISH!  You can do a little better calorie-wise by using a healtier peanut butter (I like Smart Balance) and reduced calorie butter or margerine, such as Olivo Butter Spread.  Enjoy!

I love toasted PB&J sandwiches, and thought this might be worth trying.  However, it was not a good combination at all.  I gave it two stars because the recipe is easy to follow, and does produce the product.  However, I'm not a fan of the overall combination.

I LOVE a grilled sandwich, and this is one I've never had before!  Why I never thought of it is beyond me!  I used Oat Nut bread, and the extra crunchiness really worked.

For those of you who say to leave out the butter, and use a toaster oven, the sandwich is no longer GRILLED, but TOASTED.  There is a BIG difference.  Go put some slices of cheese between 2 pieces of toast, and see how good that "grilled cheese" sandwich is now!!

Sure there isn't a mistake in the amt. of peanut butter and jelly in the recipe.  Can't imagine being able to spread 1 teaspoon of p.b. and 2 teaspoons of jelly on two slices of bread. Haven't tried it yet, but I am a peanut butter lover and know even a tablesppon doesn't go very far!  Someone comment, please.  With all those 5 star reviews it must work.  Or they used more.

This is one of my very best favorite go-to sandwiches and has been for years. My daughter & 15-year old grandson like it as is. BUT...my 11-year old granddaughter and I add a slice of 2% Kraft American cheese. I've also used Velveeta, too. You just have to be careful as both the peanut butter and the cheese can burn your mouth.

You can make many variations of this.  Any sandwich grilled makes it special.  However, I now brush olive oil on the bread instead of butter.
My grandchildren love the combo of peanut butter and Nutella together.  Or you can just try slicing fresh fruit in sandwich instead of jelly.  Try peanut butter on one slice of bread, Nutella on the other and sliced strawberries or bananas in between.

Melted inside is the only way a PB&J sandwich could get any better!!  Delicious...but I do it a healthier way and use PAM butter spray instead of real butter.  Still get the crunchy outside.

This has always been a 5-star sandwich for me.  It was a tradition for me growing up and it is now my kids' favorite.  Over the years, I found the least cumbersome and least messy way to "construct" the sandwich is to butter each slice of bread and put the buttered sides together.  Spread the peanut butter on the unbuttered side facing up, then spread the jelly on top.  Separate the slices of bread and put the "peanut buttered/jellied" slice on the pan, buttered side down, then top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.  No mess on your hands, no mess on the plate.

I've been eating these minus the jelly since I was a child.  My grandchildren love them.  My favorite memory is coming in from playing in the snow and my mother making soup and grilled peanut butter sandwiches for lunch. :)  yummmm

My family has been doing this for years and we really like it. One thing I have to say is that you need to use a lot more peanut butter to get the desired gooey effect that you want when making a griled pb&j.

well if you are even lazier you can do what I do and pop your bread in a toaster then spread on the PB and J....same great taste, and you save yourself time and cleaning, and the butter calories.

There's something about the melty deliciousness of peanut butter on toasted/grilled bread that always seems to hit the spot. I like mine with fluff (marshmallow creme), which also melts.

When I was a kid, my friend's mother used to make these all the time. My daughter loves them.  Two things: 1) If the heat is low enough and you have a non stick pan, there is no need to butter the bread, it will toast nicely; 2) This also works well with store bought "Crustables" (no need to butter these either).

mm mmm this is good.  Im chowing down on one as I write this.  I have never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich other than just the regular way.  I really like this way even better!  The peanut butter just oozes out and is so creamy.  I didnt have any jelly so I used some mixed fruit preserves on the other side.  This would be delicious with strawberry jelly!  As another reviewer said, this would also be awesome with marshmallow fluff!  Ive gotta make this for the fiance, he's in love with peanut butter and jellys.  Thanks for the recipe!

I always did mine in the toaster...It cuts out the butter which is healthier, cuts out on dishes and cuts out on time spent on it. Plus I like spreading the peanut butter as it melts on the hot toasted  bread.

OMG!  I am a fanatic for peanut butter and jelly toast.  I consider myself a pretty creative cook.  Why I never thought to butter the outsides of this sammy and cook it on a griddle is totally beyond me.  One word, as Rachel Ray would say YUM-O!

I've been making this for my son for a while now, one note though.  If you will put a thin coat of peanutbutter on each piece of bread and then put the jelly on one side it kinda keeps the jelly from leaking through the bread.

These are the best. I always use nice texas toast style white bread for these. Last night I made these with raspberry jelly and also made grilled sandwiches with Nutella and banana. My roommate and I devoured them. Definitely recommend that you try these with Nutella if you haven't already.

HEALTHY?: Switch to whole wheat bread slices with natual peanut butter. If you dont want to use that much butter, just use the spray butter on both sides.  DELICOUS TIP: Sprinkle cinnamin on both sides before you grill it. It's so good you won't know what to do with yourself! :)

This bad boy is really good!  I had issues with my peanut butter and jelly squirting out every time I bit in to it though.  So I had some flour tortillas laying around, spread the pb&j on it and popped it into the microwave for about 8-10 seconds and rolled it up (also rolling up one end).  Tastes just as good and all the ooey gooey pb&j stays in!!  Edited to add that I used MUCH more than the tsp of peanut butter and jelly.

Wow! I have been making these since I was a kid... Glad to see that other's are enjoying it as well!

*If anyone wants to experiment... you can also make these in a flour tortilla, and make a pb&j "quesadilla". Just be sure to leave room around the edges, so it won't seep out while cooking.

A buddy once made this for me on a George Foreman grill (without butter). I thought that he was crazy for preparing a PB and J sandwich on a grill, but I liked it enough to request it again after a night out on the town. I was so tired and hungry that this sandwich tasted like the best thing on earth LOL!

One word:  YUMMY! The only way to eat PB&J.  I prefer it with a whole grain bread, crunchy peanut butter and a good jam.  Decadent!

I make a version of this as a good-for-sharing dessert.  After grilling, cut into four triangles, drizzle a little chocolate sauce in a zig-zag pattern and sprinkle powdered sugar on top.  YUM.

I make this all the time for my kids and they love it. I do change it up a bit. I use whole wheat bread and I sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the buttered side before cooking. I also like to use honey instead of jam.... YUM!

Pretty Yummy! My boyfriend said it was full of peanut buttery goodness, and I must say that I concur. I used chunky peanut butter in my sandwhich which was just an excellent addition! I only had wholemeal brown bread and I can just think how much better white bread would have make this delightful treat.
Thank you for sharing!

It seems any sandwich gets beter "grilled" and this is even better grilled too. A little drippy though when the pb gets hot, so be careful eating them. A nice change from the regular cold sandwich. To like this though you have to already like pb&j sandwiches... and shhh, let's not even count calories or fat grams.

If you want an extra speacial treat-toast the bread in a toaster first, assemble the pb&j sandwich, dip in  beaten egg to coat sandwich and then cook in skillet to make a pbj french toast. Drizzle with maple syrup...mmmmm....

Excellent. I find it to be easier to butter the pan, as putting the PB/J on the bread with one side buttered is messy.

Very good, though. I have frequent cravings for it.

I never would have thought of grilling my peanut butter sandwich, but I'm glad I saw this recipe~ what a treat!  I made mine on wheat bread with honey instead of jelly, and it was delicious.  One hint: don't use fat-free margarine, as the bread won't get nice and golden crisp.  Regular margarine or butter works better.

This is one of those simple recipes you wish you would have thought of a long time ago.  I made these for an after dinner snack last night, and ended up making 3 of them, they were so yummy!  I made 2 sandwiches with PB & J, and the 3rd one using PB, honey and bananas.  They were both delicious and my son now thinks I'm the "coolest".  Thanks for sharing Chasity.

This recipe was convenient, quick, and yummy!  It's a good sandwich for kids on the go because it won't get soggy!  The bread is nice and buttery too!  I made this on the stovetop and it only took a couple of minutes on medium heat.

I was surprised that I actually liked this recipe.  The idea of melted jam didn’t seem all that appealing to me, but I decided to give it a try and it ended up alright.  Although, I didn’t use the measurements of the recipe because I was too lazy and thought that the amount of peanut butter and jelly you put in should be based on taste.  If I would have put as much jam as the recipe maybe it would have been way too melty and gross.  And in the end I still prefer a good old original PB&J.

Great sandwich, but with a couple of modifications: only old-fashioned all natural peanut butter should be used because it doesn't get too runny when heated.  Smuckers is a great choice.  Also, Jams should be used instead of jelly for the same reason. It helps if the jam is placed in the center of the bread and not spread before cooking.  The heat will spread it for you.  Of course, for the best taste and experience, real butter should be used instead of margarine.  Enjoy your gourmet PB & J!

After trying PBJ French Toast and loving it, I wanted to try this too. This was just OK for me, nice to try once, but not again. I didn't like the middle oozing out as much as I did with French Toast. Thanks anyway.

I enjoyed this version of the PB&J. I like to switch things up so I have tried toasting the bread first, which is good, but this is also another great take. I will also be trying PB and honey too.

I have always loved toasted peanut butter and jelly, but I was inspired by the reviewers who made subtle changes to the recipe. So I decided to add my own little twist. I replaced the peanut butter with a cracked egg, eliminated the bread and jelly, and fried it up. Amazing!

To be honest, I'm already a fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I've toasted my bread before, but never grilled the entire sandwich. My mother asked me the difference. The difference is the peanut butter and jelly are now more gooey and warm. It makes for an even more delicious sandwich. Definitely give it a try.

I also have been doing this for years & love it. In addition to the powers fat peanut butter, I will spray a small amount of nonstick spray on outside of bread to help brown it instead of using butter. I will have too look at one of those sandwich  makers.

Great taste (assuming you love peanut butter) but this is basically a toasted PB&J.  Toasting vs Grilling is lots easier and you don't have to worry about oozing PB&J on the griddle.  I just went to the Texas state fair and had a deep fried PB&J.  Now that was a different treat!  But this is a close second.

I laughed when I saw this on a restaurant menu years ago. When I decided to make one I just made a regular  peanut butter sandwich and grilled it.  Very rich, yummy & gooey.  A great cold winter sandwich. This recipe is a good guideline but basically you just make it and enjoy.  I only butter one side of one slice of bread, put a small amount of butter in the skillet, put the unbuttered side of sandwich down first.  I is a lot less messy.

I am almost 40 years old. My Mom has been making PB&J this way since I was 9.  But then again I am Indian. And Mom has been pan frying everything since we were kids! But yes I can vouch for this. It's a GREAT way to PB&J!!!

My sister is a HUGE fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches myself, but I wanted to try something more unique. Since I didn't have any white bread, I used wheat bread. When I took a bite of the sandwich, the peanut butter was melted-which made the sandwich that good! I made that for my sister, and she LOVES it! I would eat the Grilled Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches with a glass of milk. YUMMY!!

For the sake of rating this recipe, I did try it as written. It was good, that's for sure, but really unnecessarily complicated. You can get almost the same results a lot easier (and with a few less calories and fat) by simply toasting your bread in the toaster, then proceeding to make your PB&J as usual. Ta da! A warm PB&J that is delicious (the toast warms the peanut butter making it super gooey and yummy!). But if you just love buttered, grilled sandwiches, then you will probably love the original recipe as written. It really was pretty good, but for me, just not worth the extra time, effort and calories.

We done this for years only instead of grilling, we just toast the bread and spread the peanut butter immediately out of the toaster.  The PB melts quickly and spread the jelly.  For a really sinful change you can use Nutella instead of jelly.

As far as the one who changed the recipe using ham and cheese.  I do that all the time with any meat and cheese on the George Forman. I do spread butter on one side of the bread but don't add any condiments.  This is what I've seen on menus known as a Panini and they are great.

There is a restaurant in Oklahoma City, the Red Pin, that does this recipe by grilling them on a panini press, then slices the sandwich into 1/2 inch thick strips and serves with a cup of chocolate (like Hershey's) sauce for dipping. Absolutely amazing late night snack food!

I've been making grilled pb&j's for years.. I was so excited to see that someone posted it as a recipe... now I can show all my friends that it's an actual recipe & not just one of my weird food cravings!! I absolutely love the combination of warm gooey peanut butter, sweet jam & buttery crunchy bread. Try this variation: make grilled peanut butter sandwich (no jam, just peanut butter) then cut into triangles & serve with some honey for dipping. Crunchy peanut butter works as well!

I've made grilled pb & j sandwiches for years but for an added delight, I sprinkle it with powdered sugar when it's done.  Also, be really careful when biting into it because the jelly is very hot.

I put the peanut butter and jelly on first and put the sandwich together. Then I butter one side and put it on the griddle and butter the other side while the first side is cooking. It's less messy that way. This is the only way I will eat PB&J, my mom made these for me growing up and I now make them for my 8 kids and they love them to! I also got my sweetheart hooked on them. He looked at me funny at first but I made him try them anyway and he was really surprised at how yummy they are.

I have been making this for over 30 years. It's comfort food extraordinaire. When I make it, it's usually a cold snowy night, kids and husband not home, do not feel like cooking, and just for me. It's dinner and dessert combined. Love it

Not much different from the "toasted" peanut butter and jelly sandwich I have been making for years. Only difference is I put wheat bread in the toaster, butter bread, then put jelly on bread, melt jelly under broiler in toaster oven, then add peanut butter. This way has a fewer steps and taste the same, if not a little better. Thanks Chasity! I would have never thought of fixing them this way.

Been doing this for years with 3 slices of raisin bread. Use jelly on 1 slice, crunchy pb thinly put on both sides of middle slice and marshmallow fluff put on the other slice. So good and hearty - great for a.m. bike ride.

We have enjoyed grilled PB&J since I was a little girl...we call them "Candy Sandwiches" because the melted PB & J are so yummy and the grilled bread texture is a great contrast.  If I ask someone if they would like a grilled PB&J they think I'm crazy but a Candy Sandwich seams to be a more sane option :)

I have made this recipe for over 40 years.  It is filling and delicious!  I first started making this when my husband was "drafted" into the Army and we had so little money.  It was a cheap dinner, but filled us up.  I know many will enjoy it, if they will just try it.  Connie

I've been making this one for DECADES! Definitely a favorite for me! I've always hated peanut buutter because of it's consistancy so this is the only way I ever eat a pb&j. For a twist, you can also make grilled fluffernutters.

I've eaten grilled peanut butter sandwiches since I was a kid and still love them. I've never had tried them with jelly, I just might have to do that.
What I have tried is grilled peanut butter & nuttella (the chocolate/hazelnut spread) boy is that yummy.

I agree with many of the past posts...PB&J is wonderful. I would make a couple of adjustments to the simplicity of this though. Definitely my preference, but I hope someone else tries it. Instead of general peanut butter, try the crunchy kind. I prefer strawberry preserves to the jelly because you get the actual strawberries in the sandwich. Mix the jelly/preserves and peanut butter in a bowl before putting on the bread. Spread the mix on the bread and then...for those of you who like strawberries and bananas (OOOOHHHHH!!!!), try adding thin slices of bananas between 2 layers of the spread. That's good! One last note, has anyone considered using something like Nutella or some other kind of nut-butter? You can mix it with the PB even for a sweet treat. Hope you like my ideas. Happy cooking!

Made this for lunch today, YUM!  This sandwich reminds me of when I was a kid.  I'm sure I used more than a teaspoon of peanut butter, but that's a personal taste.  The only issue I had was that 4 minutes per side was way too long, my first came out rather black.  Instead I cooked it for 3 minutes on one side, 1 minute on the second side in my square frying pan with a glass press.

Just made this for lunch and as I was sitting and eating (devouring) it, my at-random-playing ipod chose The Watson Twins version of "Just Like Heaven," which I found apropos =)  After eating half of it I paused and thought, "it's missing something... a glass of milk!!!"  That should be included in the ingredients list, imo!  I'm toying with the idea of turning it into a dipped PB&J Monte Cristo/PB&J Stuffed French Toast now...  Oh, and try sourdough for the white bread for a more grown-up pleasing version.  And resist the urge to prss down on this with your spatula while it's grilling, or its guts will ooze...

Update: i finally took the plunge and made this simple yet delicious classic with a twist. If you are dieting and cutting back on fat and cholesterol, this isn't the sandwich for you. I love butter and have a preference for my grilled cheese and grilled pbj to be grilled with butter. I know it's decadent, fattening, unhealthy...but you only live once.
I haven't made this yet, only in my head. I thought I came up with a new twist on an old classic pbj. I also thought it was kind of crazy, but now that I see so many others have eaten it, I don' t seem so crazy anymore.

I loved it! I made it for lunch for myself and my brothers. And they loved it! I don't exactly how to explain how it tastes. It kinda tastes like a grilled cheese sandwich but not really if you know what I mean. I'm going to try and cook it every Monday. Chasity you are a genius! Did you make this up?

My daughter wouldn't eat this at first so I ate half and I really liked it, once I convinced her to take a bite she ate the other half. I will make these when I make grilled cheeses and give them half of each.....

I'm not normally a fan of PB & J but with this simple twist it won me over.  It helped that my kids liked it too.

Not the best. I think just white bread toasted and then spread peanut butter on top then put jelly on top of the peanut butter, this is much better. The peanut butter still melts and the jelly doesn't get hot just warm. And it saves a lot of fat  and calories.

This was ok, and tasted like a mountain pie.  However, it was nothing spectacular, and I like the regular version just as well, so I probably wouldn't go through the hassle of grilling it.  However, I do like grilled meat and cheese sandwiches (like turkey and cheese) because the grilling does seem to add something different to the flavor.

I've been doing these for years for the Cub Scouts, but I use "Pie Irons". That makes a nice, grilled sandwich that the edges are sealed.  I have also used marshmallow fluff, chocolate and peanut butter.  Macy

I have loved this sandwich for probably over 30 years! As an alternative if you don't have much time (or the kids can do this without using the stove), I will pop two slices of bread in the toaster, then spread the pb&j on it and slap them together as a sandwich - the pb still melts, and the jam stays a little bit cool... extra yummy!

Yum. Also fabulous made as french toast, particularly when you use banana slices and honey instead of jam (it does not leak out so much then.)

I haven't eaten plain peanut butter and jelly since I first heated one of these up in the skillet.  Melty goodness! I used strawberry jam, wheat bread, and smooth peanut butter.

I love to make this.  My variation is to use honey instead of jelly.  I use a sandwich grill that I have, rather than using a pan.  Easy, wipe up cleaning.

This was OK, but I think I honestly like regular PB&J better. It tasted less like peanut butter than a normal peanut butter and jelly sandwich (I guess I expected the opposite), and the jelly got so hot that it burned me when it oozed out. It was worth trying once, though!

Love it.  Been doing this for years without the butter and in the toaster oven.  Having melty peanut butter squeezing out from between two slices of toasty bread is wonderful.

I used to eat these ALL the time as an after school snack when I was in Junior High to try to gain some weight (unfortunately after 3 kids I don't have that problem anymore).  These are THE BEST.  If you want to cut calories by eliminating the butter, you can always stick these in the oven on a piece of foil or baking sheet to catch all the creamy, yummy, oozing peanut butter from making a mess.

I am so embarrased to say "Wow, this is really good". It never would have occured to me to grill a PB&J but I can't wait to make this for my family.

For the longest time, at least for the past 10 years or more, I would toast my bread sometimes for a peanut butter sandwich because the peanut butter tastes so good melted.  I will definately have to try this one.  My 3 year old love pb&j sandwiches, so this would be one I might make today.  Thanks.

This sandwich is supposed to be messy to eat! Grab some napkins or a wet wipe and get to to it! I've made this for my 4 year old several times now, it's simple, nearly foolproof and you can change it up with different kinds of jam. I always can't help to sneak a few bites of my daughter's sandwich when I make this!

I liked this a lot but I'm only giving it 4 stars because the peanut butter and jelly was dripping all over the place while I was eating it! I made this in my George Foreman so it totally eliminated the need for butter and I used raspberry preserves cause it's my favourite. I will make this again even though it's so messy because I really enjoyed it! Thanks!

It's good, but not much different from toasting bread and doing a regular PB & J. Plus, it takes longer and gets a pan dirty. Not really worth it for tasting pretty much the same.

My mom made this for me and my 3 brothers as we were growing up.  We all loved it and referred to it as "Peanut Butter and Jelly Cooked in a Pan".  I still can taste the gooey melted peanut butter and hot mostly liquid sweet grape jelly.  I seldom can indulge these days but if I have even just a bite of this sandwich, I am instantly transported to the 50's- sitting at the kitchen formica table eating lunch. Oh, yum!

This is a great little sandwich. I have made it for years but, I always toasted my bread in the toaster then spread the peanut butter on one slice and the jelly on the other. Good Eats!

I used pb and honey, not pb and j--just wanted honey at the time.  I liked it, but I prefer toasting the whole sandwich in the toaster oven--makes it crisper.  Thanks for the idea.

Yum~O!! I had never thought about grilling anything but cheese. This recipe gave me the basis for all sorts of grilled sandwiches!! We tried the peanut better and jelly, peanut butter and honey, and my personal favorite marshmallow creme and nutella. Fantastic!! Thank you!

this is so good! i decided to add a slice of swiss cheese to see how it tasted and it added a yummmmy extra flavor but is also great without it. you just have to make this sandwich i don't see why anyone wouldn't love it! just make sure you have plenty of napkins to clean up the gooey insides that squirt out!

My mom used to make these for lunch on cold days.  We got a glass a milk and a piece of fruit and this was a great lunch.  Be careful when you bite into the hot jelly you can get burned.  As an alternative mom would replace the jelly with honey.

...such fond memories.  we grew up on these. grilled pb&j, pb&j, pb & marshmellow, pb & banana --  along with grilled cheese, and tuna or egg salad sandwiches comprised the basic lunch menu.

i made mine with guava jam and wheat bread and used Pam spray instead of butter.  Didn't think a grilled PB & J would taste so good!

This sandwich was awesomely awesome!! =D I am so happy I found this recipe because I love PEANUT BUTTER and Jelly.. When I cut the sandwich it was all gooey.. It's a perfect sandwich if you like warm, gooey, peanut buttery, and jelly. To add some flavor to the bread I put some cinnamon and sugar!! =D

Sounds weird, but I've been making these for years with a few slices of cooked bacon  in between the slices of bread. They are even better that way! I haven't read the reviews, so I don't know if anyone else has suggested this yet.

I love these. I think they're even better when made “French” style… battered with an egg scrambled with cinnamon & nutmeg, then grilled.

I made this to try to jazz up lunch a bit for my 2 year old.  She didn't eat much of it, she just wanted to lick out the middle.  I liked it but I don't think it'll quite replace the classic PB&J.

I have been making hot peanut butter sandwiches for years and adding in the jelly is an added treat.  There is nothing like hot peanut butter and butter dripping down the corner of your mouth with every delicious bite.  It is heavenly.  Not diet friendly ofcourse but a much needed treat for the deserving-and we all deserve it :o)  PS I do make a healthier version for the kids and just put the bread in the toaster and as soon as it comes out I add the peanut butter and jelly quick and it essentially is the same minus the butter on the outside.  ENJOY!

My Grandmaw maid these for me when I was little, I got HOOKED! I use Wheat bread insted, I dont like white but i think Wheat browns better. I was serprised to find them on here. I got my best friend hooked on them a few years back. We were young and crazy then, so we asked if we could have bacon on them. It was an explosion of flavor!! Cook your bacon till it's still soft and flexable when done. Then lay down about 4 peaces across it. One layer deep.

Oh my, I am feeling like Elvis Presley eating fried sandwiches! This is very good but I just have a fundamental problem giving a PB & J 5 stars, you know what I mean? Of course these are good, this is an American staple that we have been doing for years! Too bad this isn't on South Beach or Atkins ;-)

For PB&J lovers out there, it doesn't get any better than this! A nice twist to the classic that makes it even more indulging. Also, if you enjoyed this, try the Peanut Butter and Banana French Toast, also from this site - it's awesome!

Being a big PB&J fan, I was excited to try this recipe. It was delicious, yet very simple. My only advice is to use more peanut butter and jelly than the recipe calls for.

I can't believe this recipe is on here!  I have been grilling my PB&J sandwiches for years and my husband thinks I'm wacko!  Glad to know I'm not the only one.

I've been making these for 30 years, my kids love them. I never use jelly, just slather the bread with peanut butter and fry it like a grilled cheese. Add a bowl of soup to this and you've got a great lunch for kids. Sometimes I add a couple strips of cooked bacon too. I always use Skippy peanut butter, I think it has the best flavor and isn't grainy like other brands. It's softer and more spreadable now than it used to be. My daughter makes grilled peanut butter sandwiches for her daughter now, deja vu.

Oh my gosh!!!  I can't believe I never thought of doing this before... sure I've eaten pb&j on toast but this is amazing!  It's buttery, crisp and gooey.  I loved it.  It will become a regular for me as far as scrumptious snacks go.

This recipe is awesome.  My oldest duaghtered (9)absolutely loves this!  My youngest (6) doesn't care for it but her opinion is skewed.

My 5 year old loved this!  I thought it was pretty good myself!  It's not quite pb&j on toast, but not on plain bread either!  Very yummy.  Thanks for sharing a recipe my son was excited about trying!
