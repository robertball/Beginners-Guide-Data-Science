This is a great recipe. As one of the reviewers mentioned it's a little messy to roll them, but I preservered and kept them a little tighter at the beginning of the roll; keeping as much of the topping inside the roll as possible. They were pretty big rolls and turned out great. I also used 3 breasts as someone else did and spooned some Alfredo and cheese on the top before baking. I will definitely make this again, the ranch mix throws a nice taste in the mix! the family loved it!

Tried rolling the lasagne noodles as stated in recipe but was too messy so I just decided to turn it into Alfredo lasagna instead. Instead of adding the ingredients to each noodle I just layered it. Also added some Parmesan cheese to mixture. Was very tasty and my guests enjoyed it.

Family says it's a keeper! I topped it with left over cheese mixture before putting it in the oven. In the recipe I used 3 small chicken breast and 2 cups mozzarella.

Delicious!  I was afraid it would be bland, so I added leftover marinara on top of the Alfredo on half the pan.  Both sides were great.  I laid the noodles out on a sheet pan to divide and roll, tucking filling back in to the sides as I went, and it contained the bit of a mess.  Thanks for the recipe!

We did not care for this. It was a little dry and the flavor was just okay.

I love chicken alfredo, I love lasagna, why the heck didn't I think of this before! Very good recipe and well worth spending the time to make it for yourself or the family. Thank you for sharing.

This was delicious but kind of messy to roll up. I used a tray to roll them in so it was a bit more contained. It was hot outside so I didn’t want to start the oven so I put them into the slowcooker. I heated them on low for 3 hours but that was too long. They dried out on the edges a bit but this method worked instead of turning on the oven. I found that there was a lot of extra chicken sauce so any extra was poured over the top with the extra alfredo sauce. I’ll make this again.

This was awesome! I did make a few changes of course what cook wouldn't!  First, I had no evaperated milk but go figure I had heavy cream-I used 3/4 cup of heavy cream and 1/4 2% milk.  Did not have the packaged ranch dressing but did have a container I purchased from costco and added 2 Tablespoons.  Cooked the chicken in that and the smell was soo tantalizing!  Now for the bacon, I used quick strips that I could microwave.  (not sure where the original maker of this recipe came up with 15 min prep but not likely!) As for the cheese, I only had a yummy cheese I had to buy from amazon because it isn't found where I life-provel.  Oh my goodness the silky creaminess of this was great.  Also, recipe didn't say what to do with the sauce that the chicken was cooked in so of course that went on top along with some cheddar cheese for good measure.   Baked as directed and this will be a contender for xmas!

I left out the evaporated milk & packed ranch mix as I didn’t have them on hand. Doubled the alfredo sauce instead. I also cheated & used the ready made lasagna noodles because I thought they would be easier to roll. And they were very easy to roll up!

It was very good! We especially liked the chicken with ranch sauce. I made the alfredo ahead of time and refrigerated it. Then it spread well on the noodles. Will definitely make again!

I used Ragu Alfredo sauce and had a little leftover as well as cheese mixture so poured on top of rolls. No substitutions. Excellent! It will be on my Christmas Eve buffet!

This was an awesome recipe! I have never given a review before, but this definite needed to applauded! Very easy to make. I used 3 chicken breasts and added 1/4 cup of grated parmesean cheese to the dry mix for the stuffing of the noodles. I also  poured about a 1/2 cup of Alfredo sauce on top and finished by sprinkling mozzarella cheese over the rolls.
