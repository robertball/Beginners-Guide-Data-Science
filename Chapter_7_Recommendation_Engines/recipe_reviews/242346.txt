I am the submitter for this recipe, and I am not sure what happened- but this copy is different from the one I submitted! 
The photo is different, and the amount of cider vinegar should only be 1/4 cup!

Glad I read the submitter'S correction.  Half cup of vinegar spoils this recipe.  I used zucchini and yellow squash.  If I make it again I will double the curry.  I like curry.

Before I read your post on the vinager I choose to cut it in half.  I love curry so I added more!  I believe any veggies would make this excellent.   Served it over basmati rice.  Yum

I made this solely with eggplant and did not add bell pepper.  
However, the dish was just way too vinegery for my taste. I do not plan on making this dish again.

This is yummy! I will use less vinegar (or perhaps some that's not expired!) to appease the pallets of my household, but this is a GREAT way to get my boys to eat lots of veggies!! We add turkey keilbasa and it's a big hit!
