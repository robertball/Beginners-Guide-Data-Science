I left out the feta, added paper thin slices of red onion, and used spinach as the greens. This was a light, tasty and oh-so-good for you salad.

I have made this salad for two dinner parties and all have loved it!!!!  It is very easy to put together.  You can use raspberry and walnut vinaigrette as well.

This was a really good recipe.  A nice addition to make it a complete meal is grilled chicken.  This is a keeper recipe.

This is such a great and delicious basic recipe.  I have been making various forms of it for several years, and have also used raspberries, strawberries, halved red grapes, or even pomegranite seeds! Also have used chopped pecans or sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  My family hates feta so we always use milder soft goat cheese, which everyone likes.

I like the simplicity of this recipe.  I used balsamic vinaigrette since I don't like raspberry flavor.  I would never have thought to use blueberries but they actually cut through the tartness of the dressing.  I think this salad would benefit from some thinly sliced red onion too.

This is an outstanding flavor combination!  I am on Atkins and this is one of my favorites.  Be careful with the dressings as they may be high in carbs!

Loved it! Toasted the walnuts and used a homemade raspberry vinaigrette, other than that I made it exactly as written.  I will be making this frequently now!  THANKS!

We enjoyed this colorful salad very much.  I used baby lettuces from Hubs’ garden and since the recipe called for raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing, I threw in some fresh raspberries, as well as the blueberries, for a little more color.  I toasted my walnuts to bring out their flavor (bake at 350 degrees for 8-10 minutes or until fragrant).  I also added some chopped green onions because I almost always do.  All in all very good!

Fabulous salad! I made a homemade raspberry vinaigrette dressing and this all turned out great. My husband wouldn't even try any, which was fine since that meant more for me anyway.

This is a good recipe. I did make a few changes. Instead of greens I used spinach, swapped out the blueberries for dried cranberries, I make my own candied walnuts, and I used balsamic vinaigrette instead of raspberry.

I picked blueberries today and was looking for recipes using them.  I made this salad as part of my dinner tonight, using FF Feta and Ken's FF Raspberry Walnut Dressing.  It was delicious!

This has become my favorite salad recipe. I make it all the time now. I started using raspberries instead of blueberries and it's even better. The feta cheese and the raspberry dressing are the best parts. Those who substituted these for other ingredients really missed out.

I had never had blueberries in a salad, and I loved it.  I only used 1/2 pint of blueberries though and used 1/2 sliced strawberries.  I also added some green onions and chicken as suggested.  I served this as the main course at a luncheon, and the ladies all raved.

Yummy!  I added some apple and you must toast the walnuts to bring out their flavor.  I only had balsamic vinegar dressing and that worked well.

I was intrigued by the combination in this salad. We are big fans of feta cheese so that wasn't a stretch but the blueberries. Let me tell you this is a delicious combination. When I planned this I was sure I had a raspberry vinagrette in the fridge but I didn't so I had to use a pooppyseed dressing. It was delicious. I bought some raspberry vinagrette and tried again and it is just as delicious. I love this combination and I think it would taste good with almost any dressing. I've added a bit of orange pepper that had to be used up as well as some red onion and both are a good addition if you like lots of flavors in your salad. Thanks for sharing this it has become my new go to summer salad.

This is incredibly simple, delicious.  My friends ate every bit of the salad I made.  Ingredients are readily available when blueberries are in season and easily changeable.  I used Brianna's Poppyseed dressing because I didn't have the raspberry vinaigrette, but I believe this is a great option.

My entire family enjoyed this recipe. As mixed greens, I used argula and shredded red cabbage. I also added crisp apple pieces. I made a huge bowl thinking I would have leftovers. Well, I didn't. It was great. Thank you for the recipe.

Outstanding - good enough for company.  We did not like the raspberry with it and used Good Seasons made with white balsamic vinegar.  Great combo....we will make this each year at the end of blueberry season when berries are tghe sweetest

Because it was a blueberry based salad, for presentation I ended up using spring lettuce. I used chopped walnuts as per the original ingredients but used halved walnut as "garnish". I used cubed feta in place of the crumbled feta, but this would be purely personal preference. A very nice recipe,  MARASADIE

Outstanding salad. I love fruit and green salads, had to use baby spinach since I didn't have enough Romaine lettuce. I took the advice of the recipe submitter and added in some sweet red apples and red onions, a very nice addition. I used the Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing By: JAN W on this site for the dressing.

Nice light salad- made exactly as called for. Did add a few fresh raspberries that we had picked that day at the local farm and it added a nice color. I can see how the sugared walnuts could be a nice addition to the salad.

Wonderful.  I added some purple onion and used the raspberry vinaigrette recipe from this site (from Jan W. but didn't use the full amount of sugar).  Excellent and healthy!

So tasty when paired with diced golden delicious apples, shredded parmesan and diced grilled chicken. We enjoyed this for dinner last night, what a great main dish meal for summertime.

This is one of the best salads I have had.  Talk about greater than the sum of its parts - I couldn't believe how nicely all the flavors blended.  I made a homemade Raspberry vinaigrette, using Splenda, and added red onion and served with grilled chicken on top.  Wonderful!!!

Very nice side salad.  Made as stated in recipe, except since blueberries aren't in season I used thawed wild blueberries from Costco.  This definitely would be even better with fresh ones.  Next time, I think I will toast the walnuts, as one reviewer suggested.  Make sure to use a good raspberry vinaigrette.  We really like Newman's Raspberry Walnut.

Great combo of sweet and salty flavors in this salad. I always add onion per other reviews, and I have also tried it with nectarine. Both are good additions. I'm not a fan of bottled raspberry vinaigrette, so I've tried a few variations on the dresing. I've found that both balsamic vinaigrette and a simple oil/lemon juice vinaigrette are good substitutions. Next time I might even try making raspberry vinaigrette from fresh berries and see if I get converted! This is definitely a keeper with lots of fresh variations possible.

I made this salad for a bridal shower with 20 women.  I received rave reviews and several women went back for seconds.  I added homemade candied walnuts for a special touch.  Definitely will make again.

I used everything but was out of the walnuts. Substituted with sunflower seed raspberry salad topper. It was good but I think the walnuts would have made this perfect.

This was good. But next time I will change the dressing (I used raspberry walnut vinegarette). Goat cheese might also be a good swap out for the feta!

This  is a very nice, light salad with a pleasing combination of flavors.  I used a low fat blue cheese in place of feta.  This would be good with either pecans or walnuts, as is or candied.  I used walnuts  and believe the next time I make this I'll toast whichever nut I use to enhance the overall flavor.  I may also take another reviewer 's suggestion to add sliced orange or red peppers for color contrast and additional flavor.

This is a very simple salad to make but super yummy!  I used a raspberry walnut salad dressing.  I used less than half a cup however, and I added a bit of chopped fresh mint. Those are the only changes I made and people loved this salad!

I made this with roasted chicken to have a full meal.  It was very good.  I decided to use goat cheese.  It was what I had on hand, plus I like it better.  I toasted the walnuts, too.  Tasty and easy.

The only change I made was pecans instead of walnuts as that is all I had. For some reason I just didn't care for this as well as similar salads using other fruits like strawberries, dried cranberries and mandarin oranges. I love blueberries, but somehow this salad was just mediocre to me. Sorry!!

Thank you! perfecto without the chicken!  Toasted walnuts and added slivered almonds.
