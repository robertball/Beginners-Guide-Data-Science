Even better when you use orange or mandarin vodka instead of regular!

i combined all of the ingredients and used the famous magic bullet to blend it and it turned into a perfect tasting icy smoothie. barely even tasted the alcohol but strong enough to get you drunk. i drank this for 3 days straight! good stuff...

Wonderful!  It wasn't too sweet and made a beautiful drink.  I topped mine off with a cherry.  This would be good for a brunch.

This was my drink of choice tonight. I dumped all the ingredients in my blender and hit frappe. Nice and smooth and the 
right drink I needed for a warm day. I used Smirnoff vanilla vodka.

Tasty!

Yum...this was a very tasty drink!  Not overly sweet.  I added the grenadine in with the other ingredients when I shook them.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I increased the amounts to 6 and made a pitcher.  Placed all ingredients into the blender and it was amazing.

Very tasty drink without the grenadine. I made one with a splash of cranberry juice, liked that much better.

I added whip cream and shook it in. Also doubled it to 2 oz peach vodka, 2 oz peach schnapps. I added 8 oz lemon lime drink as well. Doesn't even taste like alcohol!

Yummmmm!!! I loved this drink.  I normally don't do drinks with OJ so instead of three oz's OJ , I did two and added an extra oz of peach schnapps.  It's fantastic. I will definitely make this drink in the future.?

Perfect to me! Not too sweet or too sour. Nice and cold. Great drink recipe.
