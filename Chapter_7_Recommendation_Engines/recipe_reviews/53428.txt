Great quick & easy recipe! 
I used the "jumbo" style buttermilk biscuits though & after stretching them out, cut them in 1/2 long ways then after dipping them, twisted the 2 halves together. Cook time for jumbo bisucits was about 15-18 minutes. They were a hit with my kids & hubby!!

These were good.  I followed the directions on the can biscuit package to get the temperature right, this kept the bottom from getting to done as many have suggested.  I also spread some cream cheese frosting on top when they were done for an extra treat.  This made them really good.

I love this recipe because it's so easy, and my day care kids just gobble it down. They're always asking me to make it and to give it to their mom so she can make it at home!

I didn;'t like how the bottom burned even at 7-8 minutes.  Changing pans only helped somewhat but the pan was left with a unremovable stain.  I would try foil if I were to try this recipe again.

These were great and so easy.  I made them with my 6 year old daughter and she had a blast.  My husband commented that they were a litle dry, so I made up a powedered sugar/milk frosting.  With that they were perfect!

This was a really good recipe.  Every liked it.  I was hoping it would be more crisp on the outside so I may try a different biscuit next time.

Quick and easy, but temperature needs to go down a bit so bottom isn't so crispy.

Yummy & super easy. My 5-year-old was able to help. We decided to call them "Dirty Worms." They look like wriggly worms as they untwist a bit after you put them on the baking sheet.

My son loves the doughy sweet flavor. Now it is something he wants every morning with chocolate milk...hummm...i don't think so! every week-end is ok for this tasty treat.
