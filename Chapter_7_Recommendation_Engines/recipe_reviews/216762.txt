This recipe came up on a "gluten-free bread" search.  I made it with gluten-free oats.  It offers an interesting flavor change from the usual gf recipes containing rice flour and potato/tapioca starch.  My suggestion is to add a touch of salt and sweetener of your choice.   If you don't have cornmeal you can use the same amount of corn flour - just add more liquid.  I would make it again using a milk substitute.

I had to add 1/4 cup garbanzo bean flour and 1/2 cup rolled oats to this recipe!  This made 5 pancakes.  As written here, this does not seem like the recipe I submitted!

I LOVE pancake foods with all sorts of flours.  This combination of chickpea, corn, and oat flours is fantastic!  Be creative, people.  Try adding other spices like cumin, turmeric, paprika, or anything else you want.  Try dicing up peppers for a spicy kick or saute mushrooms, onions, and garlic before putting it in the batter.

I have 3 bags of garbanzo bean flour and had been trying to find a way to use them up.  My twins love pancakes and I'm always trying to find good GF recipes.  I came across this one and thought I'd give it a try.  I added 1T of sugar and 1/8tsp salt and used milk instead of water.  I thought they turned out great and my boys ate them up!  They are very hearty and healthy breakfast!

I made a few changes based on reviews of it being a little bland. I used milk instead of water and added a tablespoon of sugar (used coconut sugar but any kind would work) and a teaspoon of vanilla extract. To help with the texture I ran the oats through my food processor (you could probably use oat flour too). They were good for gluten-free but if you don't have a wheat allergy I wouldn't bother. You are also getting extra protein and fiber with these so they are more nutritious than your average pancake.
