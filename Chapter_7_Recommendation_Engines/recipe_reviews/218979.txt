I tried this on my hubby and mom and they were impressed! Just the right amount of "kick" from the jalapenos. Things I changed were omitting the bell pepper and using black beans in place of the pinto beans. It was excellent! Will definitely be making this again. (I also transferred to a slow cooker after the meat mixture had cooked).

This chili came out great.  I did not use the bell peppers or they thyme, but I followed everything else in the recipe.  Pretty simple, I will definately make this again.

great on a cold, rainy, fall day!  I doubled the jalapeno peppers and threw in a can of beer.  Plus put it in the crock pot on high for the afternoon.  If you like spicy, this will clear out your sinuses!

This chili recipe is delicious.  I will definitely make this again with the ground turkey.  I only made slight substitutions for ingredients I had on hand:  small can of mild chopped green chilies instead of the jalapeno peppers, black beans instead of the pinto beans.  I added a few drops of hot sauce to make it a little spicier.  As mentioned in the directions, I left the lid off while simmering so it was thickened the way I like it.  Thank you.

This was delicious.  I didn't use all the sugar, but there was still some sweetness. I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans.  I didn't use jalapeno and it was perfect for me and my daughter was able to eat it.

Made this tonight and it turned out great!  I used what I had and  had to omit the bell peppers, jalapenos, sugar, thyme and pinto beans.  Used water instead of beef broth and used stewed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes.  I didn't use the exact amounts of seasonings listed here, but I think it's dependent on your own taste anyway.  Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe that I'll keep using!

This was great! Subbed oregano for thyme, just not a big fan, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Right after cooking I thought it had a tad too much cumin and thought about cutting it a bit next time. However, after eating the leftovers for lunch today, it's absolutely perfect! I would suggest making this the day before you plan to eat it just to let the flavors blend. Will definitely make again. Very good!

I made this exactly as the recipe said, except this time because my daughter's friend is a vegetarian, I use the Morning Star Grillers Crumbles.  It was excellent and will become a main chili choice both with Ground Turkey and Grillers Crumbles.

It had such a good flavor. I used 1 jalapeno and it turned out spicy enough for my family.  I also sprinkled some chopped green onions on top to serve, along with some fresh lime juice.

Great recipe, easy to make but the changes I made were to use oregano and ancho chili pepper, substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, added a tbl.  of unsweetened cocoa powder and used Guinness beer instead of the beef broth.  Perfect with a smoky flavor.

Well this chili was the first I've ever made and probably will be the last time I make this recipe. I used dry beans in lieu of canned and I would use more ground meat, way too beany for me and my husband. The flavor was good though.

The entire family loved it! We are trying to eat less red meat and honestly, we couldn't even tell that this was ground turkey. The only changes I made were because of lacking the ingredients. Ran out of chili powder, so only used 1T. Also, only used 1T of cumin, as another reviewer recommended that. Used a large green pepper and no red pepper, had no jalapenos and used vegetable broth instead of beef broth. The canned diced tomatoes had extra basil, oregano and garlic already mixed in.Next time, I will make it exactly like I made it today. Perfect and healthy.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I did do a couple of modifications.  I did not include the jalapeno peppers and I substituted black beans instead of the pinto and red beans.  This seriously is the best homemade chili recipe I have ever tasted.  I bought a pressure cooker with a slow cook feature that allows you to slow cook for 2, 6, or 8-12 hours.  I slow cooked it for 2 hours.  Absolutely delicious.

Great taste ; simple to make.  Few changes--Sautéed in avocado oil, one can of kidney beans instead of two, two cans canned mushrooms added at the end, skipped the cheese, asked extra seasonings for more kick! Will make again!

This recipe makes a pretty killer turkey chili. Plenty of room to modify to your taste and spice level. I almost prefer this to a traditional beef chili and it’s a bit healthier. This is my go to chili recipe now,

I swapped out the peppers for celery and instead of jalapenos in the chili, I made jalapeno cornbread. It was the perfect combination :D My husband and I loved every bite.

I will make it again. I changed it by using What I had on hand—
I had half a large Visalia onion. Some fresh tomatoes instead (none canned on hand)I had no chili powder but I used 1 T of Sirachia Rub,  added canned corn, black beans and kidney beans since they were in my pantry. I had a green pepper and  to make up for the lack of canned tomatoes I added half a bottle of mild salsa, with the tomato paste and this was absolutely delicious. From reading these reviews it seems like you can’t go wrong with this recipe! I also used garlic salt since I had no fresh garlic. It was still perfect!

Yes, I'll make it again.  It makes multiple servings which is great; have future dinners waiting in the freezer now.  I omitted the jalapeno peppers, so it came out just as I wanted.

So easy and so delicious. I didn't have fresh produce so I omitted the onions and peppers, and I only had half the recommended amount of cumin and it still came out so tasty.

Great flavor! Hard to tell this is even ground turkey. I used the beans I had on hand (black beans and white kidney) and they added some nice color. I also doubled the salt to 2 tsp because it seemed very bland when I first tasted it. I used two full jalapeños with seeds and it had a nice kick of spice to it without being too spicy for me (I would omit the seeds if serving kids or older folks).

It’s simple and great taste, as always I like to add my Latin flavor. so I added a can of corn, large red bell pepper, cilantro, sazón, and doble the jalapeño...

Good recipe, but too much tomatoes.  I'd eliminate one of the tomatoes ingredients.

This is a great chili recipe!  I used a can of fire-roasted, diced tomatoes with garlic.  Instead of pinto beans, I used a can of black beans.  I used all of the other recipe components, including the jalapeños.  It had just the right amount of heat.  Everyone that tasted it said that it was delicious.  I am replacing my former “go to”  beef chili recipe with this new healthier version.  It doesn’t even taste like turkey and it actually tastes much better.

I cut the thyme, chili powder and cumin in half to adjust to our taste; and used a 50-50 mix of ground beef and turkey because I had it left over from another recipe.  This recipe is awesome -- the consistency and flavors really meld together and make a great dinner dish!!

Added a can of corn and subbed white beans for pinto due to what was in the pantry-left out the jalapeños for the whimps and the green peppers.  this was fantastic!  Can’t wait to make it a again-easy crowd pleaser

My husband and I made this and it was delicious! We only used one jalapeño and it was spicy enough for him but not too hot for me. Otherwise we followed the recipe and it turned out great. Definitely will make it again!

Just put this on simmer after taking a taste, yummy! I used pinto beans and white kidney beans (don't like red). I also added a bit of cayenne pepper and used ground chicken and chicken broth. Soooo good and pretty easy too!

This recipe is amazing! It was my first chili ever and I didn't even have all the ingredients (such as cumin, broth) and eliminated chili and jalapenos due to no one in our house enjoying spicy food, and it still turned out delicious! Highly recommended.

I was concerned about the quantity of cumin and chili powder so I halved each of them and could have even gone a little lighter.  Loved, loved  it with my small changes.  Will make it again.

Yum! I made this almost exactly as the recipe instructed and it is amazing!!! Ran out of cumin after 1 tablespoon, and used green chiles instead of jalapenos, next time I will have those on hand. Definitely a keeper! Will be making it again....And again!!!

I made this and it was so good. I didn't have thyme so I left it out. Also left out the jalepenios. I used cayenne and some paprika. Plus used some onion powder and garlic powder. I made it too spicy with the cayenne so I put some cream cheese in it. Wow, it was really really good. I'll be freezing it for the winter.

Made this in a crockpot. I used a 28 oz can of tomato sauce and omitted the tomato paste and beef broth. I sauteed the onions, turkey, and garlic before adding it to the crockpot. Used one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans. Added frozen roasted corn to the crockpot towards the end. Served with avocado and cilantro.

This is excellent, made it as per the recipe.  Just the right amount of heat for me.  I am curious however, it says it makes 6 servings, but how big is one serving?  1/2  Cup, 1 Cup, 1 1/2 Cup, 2 Cups??  Without dividing the receipe into six different bowls to calculate . .  I also made it with dry beans after soaking over night.

My first impression is this tastes really good, spicy enough. I halved the recipe - basically changed only two items as I didn't have jalapenos or beef broth. I subbed ancho chili pdr and chicken broth.. Definitely a keeper, will be sharing the recipe.  And it seasons up even better the second day,  so I suggest you make this ahead if you can.

Delicious chili. I left out the jalapenos and did about 1/2 the chili powder and it still had enough heat for me and my kiddos. Serve with corn bread, nom nom.

Thanks for the recipe. Tweeked it a little bit. Added kielbasa and hominy and doubled jalapeños. Left the sugar out. Was a hit with the Fam. Thanks for the inspiration.

This recipe is pretty quick and easy as far as chili goes, but it does need a few tweaks. Even with no sodium added beef broth it's plenty salty, so be careful about what you're adding to it. I used the optional 2 jalapeños and I didn't find it spicy enough, so I added 1tsp goat pepper mash and a bit of Tabasco Chipotle sauce. I also don't think 45mins is long enough to let it "cook down" - I would recommend at least 2 hours of simmering to get the most from the ingredients. All in all a decent recipe to use as a starting point - it gets better the longer it sits in the fridge and can be easily frozen for a week's worth of meals.

Did this recipe tonight and my husband loved it! Added a little bit more cumin and used cayenne pepper because we like it spicy and i didnt have jalapeno peppers in hand. I will make this recipe again. It didnt take me 45mins to reach the desired thickness i wanted. I simmered it for 30-35mins.

...a great twist on chilli! The mix of all of the spices makes it very unique, and perfectly paired with the turkey. I served it with grated sharp cheddar. 

Delicious!

I made this for the first time tonight and thought it was delicious : ) made a few adjustments though. I added ab twice the amt of tomato sauce as well as broth. It was way too chunky and had no tomato base before adding the extra broth. I will probably use a little less green pepper next time too. I used way more seasoning too. But overall, it came out great with a really nice flavor. I always make my own chili generally the exact same so this was a good change.

This recipe is a delicious classic chili recipe. Instead of turkey I used ground beef which my husband wanted. I also added about half of a Scotch bonnet pepper in addition to my home,grown jalepeno.  Also has fresh thyme too!

Very good! I added 1/2 Tbsp of cumin instead of 2 Tbsp. I also substituted black beans for red beans and one monstrous red pepper for the red/green peppers. I recommend adding a sliced chorizo for some kick! Would definitely make this recipe again!

Traditional Chili with Ground Turkey Haiku: "Can't believe how good, this chili turned out to be. Easy and delish!" I halved everything except the 1 lb. turkey due to only having 1 can of red beans (meh, we don't like pintos) and an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. The only ingredient that had me nervous was the thyme, but I was faithful to the ingredients, dumped it all in the crockpot while I was at work, and then we served it with cheese and Frito Scoops. Umm wow, deceptively sneaky good chili that my 6-year old gave a very exuberant "5 Stars!" to.

A great, traditional chili recipe, just what I was looking for! I do not write many reviews, but I had to for this one. I didn't follow the recipe to a T, instead I subbed dried oregano (I didn't measure how much I used)for the thyme. I also used Indian chili powder, which is very spicy, so I reduced chili powder to ~3/4 Tbsp. I also reduced cumin to 1 Tbsp, both because my husband doesn't like overpowering cumin and because I ran out :) 
I cooked and browned the turkey separately from the onions and peppers. I added my turkey to the onion mix after the initial 8 min. and then threw in my spices.
Also, in place of the fresh/pickled jalapeños, I used Ranchero pinto beans with jalapeños. 
My husband thought it was great. Also, on a side note, I made Alex Guarnaschelli's easy cast iron skillet cornbread to go with it; I highly recommend this cornbread recipe!

The hubby said this was the best recipe we have tried. It was great and awesome to warm up the left overs. I personally think that I will be replacing the beef broth with just more tomatoes. We don’t eat any red meats so it set off a little flavor I wasn’t expecting. But over all was great and will be making again with just a few tweaks!

I had a package of ground turkey I needed to use before it went bad, so I searched for recipes for ground turkey and this popped up. I was happy to see that I had nearly all of the ingrediants already. What I didn't have was cumin, bell peppers or tomato paste. I also didn't have diced canned tomatoes. Instead, I used crushed and added extra to make up for the lack of paste. This was an easy dish to make. The only thing I would question/suggest is the cook time. I have no idea why this says 2 hours. Once everything was in the pot, 40-45 was enough for the beans to tenderize. I say everything in total took a little over an hour.

I have never found a "worthy" chili recipe- until now! This is FANTASTIC. I'm not a green pepper fan, so we used two red peppers. Also not a kidney bean fan, so I swapped out black beans. However, I'm sure the original recipe would be just as great. Even my picky second grader likes it.

Great recipe, don't really need green bell peppers with jalapeños, just add more jalapeños. It could be a little more spicy, so leave some jalapeño seeds in it to spice it up. All in all I rate this a high 4 stars. About a 4.7.

Simple, prepared in about 30 minutes or so. Adjusted the spices and herbs to taste, but only added cayenne instead of jalapenos, plus 1-2 Tbl of fennel seeds, 1Tbl paprika, vegetable broth instead of beef. Also used 1 each, 15 oz cans of white kidney and pinto beans. Good stuff!
