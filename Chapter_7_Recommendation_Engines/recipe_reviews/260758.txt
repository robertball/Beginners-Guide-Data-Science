Great texture and the cayenne is subtle to start and bites in the end. Ideal accompaniment is a tall glass of milk.

Going to a church picnic tomorrow and entering it into a cookie contest. Will update if I win something. LOL

UPDATE 7/22/18: I ended up winning the "best texture" category and the "best cookie overall" category!  Got lots of compliments. Just enough kick to balance the chocolate. WINNER!

Wow!   I haven't reviewed anything in probably 10 years but I loved this recipe so much, I had to reopen my allrecipes.com account just to put my feels in!
I was a little anxious to try these as it is a pretty new addition to the site and they only have 2 reviews (both positive).  I made them exactly as written and everyone from my 5 year old up to my husband loved them! 
I was concerned about the addition of spicy cayenne for my non spice liking kids but we all found it has just enough spice to add depth to the otherwise very rich chocolate cookie. 
I have made A LOT of cookie recipes over the years, I actually have quite a reputation for my cookies with friends and family.  So trust me when I say this recipe is a keeper!  I plan to make these many times in the future!  Thank you so much for sharing!

Made these cookies according to the recipe but did spice them up a bit more by adding an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 tsp chili powder to the batter. They came out delicous, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

I followed the directions, but maybe it was too little moisture in the air (DC Area), but they came out too dry and gritty once they cooled.  I wanted to add some more moisture to the cookies to get either something with a softer bite or at least less like white sugar crystals.  So I took 1.5 cups of white sugar suggested and instead did .75 cups of white sugar and .75 cups of dark brown sugar (brown sugar contains more moisture because of the molasses and does not alter the taste to much).  I also added a tablespoon of whole milk.   If you add too much moisture in the recipe, you will not  get the great crinkle breaks on the top of the cookie.  To remove the moisture, add a 1/4 cup of flour at a time.  You are looking for something that is closer to break-n-bake cookie dough, but less sticky.  I would also advise you chill your cookie dough before using it.   15 mins in the refrigerator is enough to chill it.  It makes it easier to roll into a ball and hold the desired shape better.  If it is too warm, you cookie cook, but it look like it has a puddle around the edges.  Do not however leave it chilling for too long (i.e. 1 hour) because can become too hard to work with and you will have to wait for it to come up to handling temperature again.  Lastly, the other commentators are right, double the suggested amount of chili (cayenne) powder or use an equal amounts of another chili powder like ancho or chipotle to add more character to your spice.

Easily the best chocolate cookie dough I have ever worked with.  These cookies are amazing made as is with just slightly more cinnamon and cayenne.  I also tweaked it to make chocolate peppermint cookies using just a dash of cinnamon and cayenne for depth, then added chopped peppermint baking chips with chocolate chips.  Crushed candy canes into powder and mixed with sugar to roll in.  Thinking of using dough to also try chocolate salted caramel espresso cookies.

These are wonderful. Followed the suggestions and upped the cinnamon. My husband was impressed with the gooey centers from the chocolate chips. I'll bet adding mini marshmallows would take this cookie to the next level.

Excellent cookies. I did double cayenne pepper and added a 1/4 tsp black pepper.  Next time I will sub half brown sugar with white. Cinnamon and sugar on outside a must, I personally added a touch of cayenne to mixture, wonderful.

After reading the reviews I decided to bake recipe as written but only 1/2 batch. Boy am I glad I only did do a 1/2. They were edible but most definitely needed more cinnamon and cayenne.  Also mine baked for 13 minutes. Will make again next week with the modifications and update review.

Delicious and so easy! I was craving sweet and spicy, I added a touch more cayenne and they were perfect. My husband took some to work and was immediately invited to join a holiday cookie swap.

I made these as a christmas gift for someone who loves cayenne pepper. And it was a huge hit at the office.. A few things I did to make it my own. I used baking powder instead of cream of tartar. Did not use chocolate chips. But I melted some espresso chocolate chips and put a drizzle on the cookies. And I did add cayenne to the sugar cinnamon mixture. The espresso drizzle just made these even better than they already were!

I doubled the Cinnamon and Cayenne the first time I made it per the reviews of others.  Definitely helped get that kick I was looking for, it hits you after you have finished the cookie. Cayenne happens to be my favorite spice at the moment and this fits the bill it is so so good.  I also added some Black Hawaiian Salt to the Sugar/Cinnamon Mix to coat the cookies.

OMG. Best cookie EVER!!!!  I made it exactly as stated but used a heaping half teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a touch more for good measure. Same with the cinnamon . I love how the heat from the pepper gradually lets itself be known after that first bite. Definitely a keeper!

I love these! I added some extra cayenne and added some mini marshmallows to the top as soon as they came out of the oven. They have the best consistency and the flavor is amazing!

These were amazing! Used a rounded 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne. Dough was a bit wet so I chilled in freezer for 15 min, then I was able to roll into balls easily.

Yummy!  Turned out perfect as written.  I used extra-hot red chili powder (the type from Indian grocery stores) instead of cayenne since that's what I had.  I'd maybe use less of that next time.

So far so good! These cookies are very quick to make. I have the first set baking and they are looking good, I live in AZ and it is mid July so I have to be cautious with the butter so I don’t end up with flat tasty but not pretty cookies how ever these ones held up really well they are round and as my daughter said, pretty muffin tops.  For my family that is adverse to spicy foods the hint of pepper is just right as listed in the recipe. The flavor is nice, I love the chocolate cinnamon mix. Perfect simple and tasty, just right for a busy mom.

I adjusted the recipe a little, I used Bob's red mill gf all purpose 1 to 1 flour because I am gluten free, and it worked great, I also tried rolling cookies in confectioners sugar, and they tasted great with either type of sugar. I have officially found my favourite kind of cookie. After years of searching for the perfect recipe I am happy to say that I have found the cookie that represents me. Thank you!

These turned out great. I will definitely make them again. Maybe add a touch more cayenne next time.

These are fantastic. I substituted 1/2 the sugar for brown sugar and used Mexican cocoa powder and vanilla (I travel there frequently). Rich chocolate flavour with a slight heat afterwards. Even the family who don't like spicy loved these cookies.

First time making- I modified. For sugar I did 1/2 white sugar 1/2 dark brown sugar (was out of light brown) and for butter I did 1/2 Crisco 1/2 butter. For the chips I did 1/2 peanut butter 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate. I also didn't roll the cookies in the cinnamon and sugar mixture- I put all cinnamon and sugar in the batter. I realized I left out the salt once all was mixed together so instead of adding it to the batter I sprinkled crushed sea salt on top of the cookies before baking. I like cookies a little bigger (the approx. size of my palm once baked) so baking time usually takes a little longer- I baked 'em 15 min instead of 10. They cooled firm but chewy with chips perfectly gooey. My husband loves them.

My boyfriend LOVES these cookies. I tweaked the recipe a bit because I do not like spice, so I make the better without any cinnamon or pepper in it, then make the sugar coating mixture with Chipotle powder, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper. I make 3/4 of the batch of cookies by rolling it in that mixture then leave 1/4 of the batch "naked" for me. :)

Holy moly!  O. M. G. These cookies are DELICIOUS!  I’m only half done baking all of them but I had to say how great these are!  The ONLY thing I did different was I added 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne to the batter (1/4 teaspoon extra). I used Ghiradelli cocoa and chips. I went ALL IN. SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD.

These are delicious! I made two batches - one just as posted, and the other with double the cayenne and double the cinnamon as others suggested. The regular was perfect for our family members that don't love a lot of spice, and the doubled batch was perfect for our spice-lovers! This is my new favorite cookie!

Excellent recipe. Logged back into the site just to write a review! I doubled the cinnamon and cayenne and also added a sprinkle of Chili powder to bring out the flavors. The cooking time is perfect and followed the rest of the recipe as directed. Great for my cookie swap!

OMG! Sooooo yummy! I’m not even done baking them all and rating this 5 stars. Chewy, deep chocolate flavour, with a little spice kick at the end. I plan to use this dough without cayenne in the future, too - great flavour. ??????

These are so good! They aren't super spicy, I would describe them as warm. We didn't have cream of tartar and looked up a substitution, which was 4tsp baking powder for this recipe. They are taller than the ones in the picture, but are not cakey at all. Very chewy and delicious.

Have made these several times and they are always a hit. I like the warmth so I double the cinnamon and cayenne and it's perfect. Made a half batch just because I craved the this afternoon.

Amazing. Definitely add the pinch of cayenne to the cinnamon sugar mixture. I only let mine cool on the pan for 1-2 minutes, and the texture is perfect. I took a double batch to a party, and every single one was gone when left.

Beautiful fluffy texture.  I can't taste the cayenne, but I do get a nice warm after-spice feeling.  I didn't have chocolate chips so I think they really would have helped provide more chocolateyness that mine are shy on.

So I decided to make these because they looked easy and I'm a beginner baker. So when I made them I added a tad extra bit of cinnamon and cayenne. They tasted awesome and I loved how the cayenne kicks in when you eat it. Great job!

I increased the cinnamon a bit but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  My kids LOVE them!  I always bake with Einkorn flour which normally requires an extra couple minutes of cooking time, but in this case increasing the cooking time by just two minutes made the cookies too crunchy for me.  I stuck to 10 minutes for subsequent batches and they turned out perfectly.

I liked it and won't be changing the recipe.  My ghost pepper loving son didn't like the cinnamon/cayenne flavor and thought they were a little weak on heat. The other 5 members of the family thought they were an interesting twist for a cookie.

If you love Mexican hot chocolate you will love these cookies.  The texture and taste of these cookies are wonderful.  The cayenne pepper gives it just the right amount of kick.  One of the best cookies I've ever eaten!  Highly recommended!

Oh my goodness, where do I start? These are wonderful! Chocolately with just the right amount of spiciness! So I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder, replaced the white sugar with 1 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar, and added a 1/2 tsp chili powder (I highly recommend that!). I also misread the directions and added the full 1 tsp of cinnamon to the dough instead of only 1/2 of it. So I just rolled the cookies in plain white sugar. I got 33 cookies out this, using a medium cookie scoop. And 10 minutes at 375 was perfect for me. I want to make these again, but coat them in powdered sugar to make a Mexican Hot Chocolate Crinkle Cookie! Thanks for the recipe!

Great! I used a melon baller to make mini cookies. They required the same amount of time and made about 120 cookies. I learned on the first batch to pull them out at the 10-11 min mark to get cookies soft in the center. If you want them crunchy, leave them in 11-12 minutes. They crack when done, but otherwise you can't tell. Perfect amount of chocolate and chile flavor; I would not adjust the spices at all.

Looked good. I added a touch more cinnamon and cut down the sugar a tad as per another review. I like cinnamon and I like chocolate; but not together. I tested it out on others; not a hit. Wouldn't make again.

My family LOVED this cookie! I was a little apprehensive with the cayenne...but we loved the little bit of heat! I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious cookies! I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon cayenne for an extra kick. My friends loved it, and two of them asked for the recipe!

My kids loves these, despite the heat.  I sprinkled white sugar on the top.  I might make them without the choc chips next time.
