I had to freeze in two batches.  I considered letting the mixture cool before putting in my ice cream freezer but was afraid of what the jello might do.  That batch did not work out well.  The second batch sat in the refrigerator for nearly 24 hours before I put it in the ice cream maker.  It came out beautifully and would rival any premium ice cream on the market.

This is a terrific recipe. I used the amount of graham crackers called for and it came out wonderful. I think using more would have detracted from the flavor of the key lime. My family also raved about this ice cream so I made another batch but doubled it, which kept very well in the freezer. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

One word - FABULOUS!  Delicious recipe! I even added real Key lime juice in place of the regular lime juice. Had to use less as it is stronger though. :)

BRAVO! This recipe was outstanding. I made it for a large gathering and everyone said it was the best. Very refreshing. Note-it DOES take a long time to set up in a commercial ice cream freezer. This was even after I chilled the custard before putting in freezer. And do plan on breaking up the graham crackers before adding them.

This is fabulous.  I was worried it would taste like sherbet - yuck.  But it has a rich creamy taste.  Instead of the milk and heavy cream I used half and half.  I had a little trouble with the graham crackers.  When I put them in whole they made the churn bind up and the crackers didn't break up.  The next time I made it I put in graham cracker crumbs.  That worked better but the taste of the crackers was rather diluted.  Next time - and there will definitely be a next time - I will add broken up crackers near the end of the churn  process.  Very refreshing for a hot summer day!

Very good recipe.  The taste and texture is superb.  I altered the recipe by tempering the egg yolks before adding them, and I used mini teddy-graham crackers instead of regular graham crackers.  I'll definately use this recipe again.

This was WONDERFUL!  I made it and took it to our ice cream social at church.  It was gone before any other ice cream and I had about 12 people request the recipe!  

I used Graham Cracker crumbs instead of the crackers and it did fine as well.  We also sprinkled the crumbs on top...it was a hit!

Good recipe!  I would just suggest adding lime zest into this mixture just to add a punch of real lime flavor.  We also added a bit more graham crackers in for the crunch + contrast of taste and texture.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks.

Truly Amazing!!!  This is not 5 star, it's 6!  Rich, creamy and oh so delicious.  Made it exactly as posted though I used additional heavy cream instead of milk.  Really, just like a delicious key lime pie,

Love this recipe! We just pulled it off the maker and put it in the freezer to harden. The flavor is perfect. Lime is delicious without being too strong, as lime sherbet sometimes is. We made it for an ice cream social this afternoon. Can't wait to see what our friends think of it.  UPDATE: This ice cream won 1st in our ice cream social contest yesterday!!

I made this ice-cream for Fathers day and it was a big hit.  My nephews couldn't get enough.  I followed the recipe for the ice-cream, but instead of using graham crackers, I made a graham cracker crust and baked it on a cookie sheet while ice-cream was churning in the machine.  The last 5 minutes in the maker, I broke up the crust and mixed it in.  It was awesome!!!

I had to cut this recipe in half because my Krups Ice Cream maker only accomodates 1.5 quarts of ice cream.  I agree, it did take longer to set up so I plan on reducing the plain milk again by 1/4 cup after I reduce the recipe.  The basic recipe is great and you can change by using orange jello and extract or cherry jello and extract.  This was very creamy and I know it will be made over and over this summer.  Thank you for an excellent recipe!

I made this recipe for our annual Ice Cream Extreme night and it took first place in the people's choice!  I did use Nellie and Joe's Real Key Lime Juice and left out the Lemon Extract.  This is my new favorite ice cream.

Crazy good. Insanely good. Tastes even better than Key Lime Pie! I did add extra graham crackers and I threw everything but the crackers into the blender for easier mixing. It made it super smooth and satiny. If I could give this more stars- I would! My husband (who is not easily excited) LOVED this! So did my kids and I. =0)

Another one to throw in the recipe box. Very good. I upped the heavy cream to 1 c., and cut the whole milk by 1/3 c. to get a creamier texture. I used real key lime juice. It's stronger, so I only used 3/4 cup. The ice cream ended up a little "chalky", which I think might be due to the way the Jell-O interacts with the other ingredients, but it was still delicious and creamy. I also tempered the egg yolks with some of the warm cream mixture, then stirred them back into the ice cream base, just to make sure there were no scrambled egg bits. You should also let the mixture chill before churning - makes churn time go faster. It's true - this does taste EXACTLY like Key Lime Pie. Try to keep the graham cracker pieces big, and mix them at the very end of churn time, so they don't break up too much and dissolve into the ice cream. Froze it overnight, and the whole family gave it a thumbs up. I'll make it again!

This is an AWESOME recipe!  We made it on the Fourth for a group and it was "knock your socks off" great!  Everyone loved it.  I made it exactly as given in the recipe, had no problems whatsoever...and it was my first batch of home-made ice cream ever!  I will definitely make it again.

Originally I gave this recipe 3 stars because the texture was off - seemed kind of like an ice cream mouse.  I've decided to bump it up to 4 stars because the texture got a lot better after it sat in the freezer another day.  The flavor is really great, and the graham crackers really added so much yummy-ness that I wasn't expecting.  The recipe doesn't specify fresh or bottled lime juice.  I just took the easy route and used bottled, and I think it was fine.  And yes, as other reviews have suggested, make sure to cool the mixture completely before putting it into the ice cream maker.  I refrigerated it overnight.  Overall very good - I'm sure I will make it again.

Oh my!!!!!  Completely delicious!  I made this recipe three times this summer for different events.  People could not believe how awesome it was.  It is now my Mom's all-time favorite ice cream.  I have never had ice cream this creamy.  Definitely let this ice cream cool to room temperature after you cook it, then refrigerate it over night.  I fully believe this makes the texture incredible.  I will make this recipe a few times every summer!

Awesome Ice cream recipe! I didn't experience any chalky texture as some reviewers have claimed. I tempered the eggs, pretty much constantly stirred mixture while over heat, and let it cool completely before placing in my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker. I had to mix in two batches as it's only a 1 quart machine. I whisked the cooled mixture before pouring into the machine. I didn't put the graham cracker in the ice cream but instead served the ice cream in tart sized graham cracker crusts, topped with homemade whip cream and a lime slice. Turned out supper cute!

Perfect ice cream for citrus fruit fans!  I love the sweet tang, and it is so creamy!  I didn't add the graham crackers, since we were serving it in homemade waffle cones.

After making this several times I believe it is essential to refrigerate 24 hours before putting in the ice cream maker, otherwise it's not nearly as smooth and creamy.

Excellent lime flavor and the grahams make it!  I made it twice and cut the sugar a little the 2nd time and it was better! Wonderful extra-special treat for a special occasion!

I was so hoping this recipe would be good. I wasted a lot of money to find out not so. First, this makes way too much. Why do so many ice cream recipes make so much? I don't even know where to find an ice cream maker that big. Second, this mixture needs to cool before freezing. That's a given, but it should be mentioned in the recipe. Third, this never set up properly (and I let it go an hour!) Finally, it left a weird aftertaste. I won't make again. :(

I too experienced a "chalky" texture with the end product.  This is a relatively expensive recipe, but for my Cuisinart ice cream maker, this recipe makes a double batch.

I just finished making this recipe and it is yummy! The only thing I changed was that I used a graham cracker pie crust instead of regular graham crackers-mmm,mmm.

This ice cream is amazing. Everyone who tried it just loved it. The first time I made it, it had a bit of a gritty consistency, but still tasted great. The second time I tried it, I turned off the burner before adding the eggs. The mixture was still hot, so I tempered the eggs and then added the jello.  This seemed to work better for me and the final product had a very rich and creamy texture.

all i can say is AMAZING! this tasted exactly like keylime pie. followed the directions exactly except i let the mixture cool in the fridge for a few hours before putting it in my ice cream maker.i used bottled lime juice and it still tasted great. this was so creamy and refreshing on a hot summer day. i made a grahm cracker crust and broke it into pieces to serve with the ice cream. will be making this again soon.

I wish the original instructions told to refrigerate the mixed ingredients for 24 hrs prior to placing in ice cream maker !  Mine turned out to be a major FLOP because of that.  It NEVER properly solidified as churning and wound up a heavy solid ugly srapable hunk of green stuff.  Not very appetizing and embarrassing to serve to my guests, who proclaimed it was WEIRD.   I like my foods as natural as possible.  That's why I have an ice cream maker in the first place.  I'm trying to avoid poisoning my family as much as possible.

The taste on this recipe is superb; just be sure to use bottled key lime juice--it tastes just a bit different from "regular" lime juice. I failed miserably at getting this to thicken in the ice cream freezer--maybe it was too hot? And my Cuisinart machine proved unequal to the task of breaking up the graham crackers, so I partially froze the ice cream and smashed the crackers with the side of a metal spoon. It came out a little bit grainy, but as I said, the flavor was great: just like eating a frozen key lime pie.

This was pretty good, considering I made it with fat free half and half and skim milk.

Guess I'm the party pooper :(. This was just OK. I couldn't get past the taste (or color) of the lime jello; it didn't taste natural. The texture was marshmallow-like, and it took me, as recipe indicates, probably double the time to churn as regular ice cream. But here is my *PROCESSING TIP (I have a 1.5 qt. Cuisinart): Churn the mixture until it seems to be freezing and whipping no further. If it does not seem light enough, remove the bowl and place it, with the mixture and paddle inside, in the freezer for 30-45 minutes. Then remove from freezer and manually turn the paddle until it is loosened and able to churn again. Place back on machine and churn again. Repeat if necessary.

Kinda pricey to make, but absolutely delicious. Worth it when you want to splurge and have something "sinfully delicious".

Great ice cream!  I as well used more cream and less milk per other cooks suggestions to see if it would set sooner, but still took a long time. I used Key Lime Juice instead of lime juice, just used less due to stronger flavor. Tasty!

If you use 24 servings it will perfectly fill a two quart ice cream freezer.

This was seriously amazing ice cream- everyone loved it!  It really did taste like key lime with the addition of the lemon extract without having to buy key lime juice.  I did let the mixture cool overnight in the fridge before putting it through the ice cream maker.  I allowed the ice cream to work in the mixer for about 35 minutes rather than the 25 minutes I usually do.  About 2/3 of the way through processing in the ice cream machine I mixed in broken pieces of graham cracker.  As others mentioned, this made more ice cream than would fit in my machine.  Rather than re-freezing my ice cream maker bowl I just poured the remaining mixture into popsicle molds.  Excellent flavor and consistency, will definitely be making again!

This had a bit of a chalky taste initially, though it quickly vanished under the delicious flavour of the ice cream.  I liked this, but didn't love it.  It got mixed reviews from famiy and friends.
