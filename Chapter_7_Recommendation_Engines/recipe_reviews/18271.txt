I only used 1 can of cream-style corn and for a little ease, used Jiffy cornbread mix, which gave this some sweetness. You can also consider adding jalapenos for an additional kick.  This turned out great...will make again.

Updated 11/25/04:

Baked it in a 9x13 pan for 1 hour 45 minutes - knife still didn't come out clean, but after it sat for a bit the consistency was perfect.  This is excellent and seemed to be the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner today.

I used 2 can of corn and one creamy corn, made it a little crunhier. i added some more salt and pepper in the mixture. i say add more spice in the mix because the corn does taste kind of bland. i used only 1/2 box of the corn muffin mix which made it perfect! last year i used 1 box and it turn out to be corn bread instead of casserole =P i used 3 eggs instead of 2 and less butter.  i took someone advice and added some mayo, not sure how much it affected the recipe but it was very moist! i guess if you add a little more sour cream it'll do the trick too = ) i didn't add any onions or chillies but next time i'll probably add some mix veggies (frozen package) to give it some more color...
when it's almost done in the oven i added more cheese on top to make it a little crispy and cheesy because when you add the cheese in the begining it just sinks in w/ the mixture.  more the cheese the better!!! i'll def. make it next time!!!

I absolutely love this dish! Even my pickiest friends enjoyed it. I used hot diced chiles instead of the mild, and also have tried it with half cheddar and half pepper jack cheeses. I think leaving it in the oven an extra 10-15 minutes makes the casserole texture more firm, not too mushy. If you prefer a drier casserole, I recommend baking it in a wider dish.

I made this to go with the slow cooker taco soup! I didn't have enough sour cream so I used 8 oz. cream cheese instead and it was fantastic. I also sauteed the onions with that butter and my guests loved it!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This was really good and my family liked it.  I cooked it longer than the recipe said to get the golden brown top.  I made the mistake of eating it straight out of the oven.  I would wait 15-20 minutes before serving to let it build up its texture because it will taste much better that way.

I prepared this recipe for a celabratory dinner for my mom's 77th birthday.  Even my picky, don't-care-for-vegetable siblings asked for seconds!  The only variant to the original is that I added a few light sprinkles of cayenne pepper before spooning into the casserole.  It was just the right amount of zip for my spice-loving family!  This recipe has already been given the family's approval to add to our traditional Thanksgiving menu.  Bravo, Polly!

This casserole was very good, but we all agreed  the chilies got to be too much.  Next time I will make it without the chilies for a sweeter corn casserole.

This was delicious. I prepared this as written, except for size of baking dish and cooking time; I used an 8" x 13" glass baking dish. The recipe didn't specify, so I used a box of Jiffy corn bread mix. Oops, and I forgot to drain the can of chilies, but a 4 oz can is so small I don't think it affected it. I think my oven's thermostat may be a little inaccurate, because when I checked the casserole at 60 minutes the top was a beautiful golden brown, and I removed it from the oven at that time. The knife did not come out clean at that point, but after letting it sit on top of the warm oven for about 45 minutes it attained a lovely "bread pudding" consistency. Letting it sit also allows the flavors to mature; I know, because I just had to taste it as soon as it came out of the oven (it smelled so good!), and it really was better after it set up. It was wonderful just as it was. Thanks for a great recipe, Polly; I will definitely make this again!

This is really tasty!  I brought it to work for a holiday luncheon, and everyone had at least 2 servings, and most people asked for the recipe.  I made it in my slow cooker, for 3 hours on high.  I stirred it a few times for even cooking.

Oh my wow, this stuff is good.  I changed a few things and thought it was perfect.  Easily the best casserole I've ever made.  I added about 1 tbsp. of mayo to the mixture, left out the chilies, and only used about 3/4 of the box of jiffy corn muffin mix.  And instead of just plain cheddar cheese, I used the pizza blend with mozzarella and cheddar.  Sooooo good, everyone loved it for Easter lunch!  Thank you :)

I made this recipe for the first time friday night because we were having some friends over & I couldn't find an old corn casserole recipe that I've previously made and loved. Well, it has been replaced! This is by far the BEST corn casserole I have ever made! My dinner guests and my husband complimented me continuously throughout the meal and the casserole was still delicious when we had it for leftovers tonight.  Next time I make it, I might try using some more cheese to make it a tad cheesier. Other than that, this recipe was absolute perfection.

I love this recipe, it works so well with everthing, especially bar-b-que!  I use "Glory" brand skillet corn, it is delicious.  Sometimes I use an egg, sometimes I don't.  I love jazzing it up with jalapenos and also have used bacon, onion, and cheddar.  There doesn't seem to be anything you can do to "kill" this recipe!

We made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  Being SO tired of just heating up a can of corn we thought we'd try it and it was GREAT!!!!!!  Just enough kick with the chilis, but not HOT at all.  We made it the day before and reheated it before dinner, it held up very well and it was great as leftovers, it didn't get soupy or break down.  I will make this again and again, it would be great as a side when having mexican night at our house too!

I thought this was excellent! I doubled the recipe but instead of doubling the regular corn, added the one can of regular corn and a bag of frozen broccoli chopped up and put into a 9x13 pan.  This got rave reviews from everyone!!!!

Splendid comfort food!  I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving 2004, having never eaten anything like it before (not a cornbread person), and it was such a pleasant surprise. Savory yet slightly sweet, very moist but holds together, looks appetizing.  I can see this going well with breakfast foods.  I have enjoyed this best of all the holiday leftovers!  I have made this three more times since then. Occasionally, for a bolder flavor, I have tweaked this recipe as follows:  add finely chopped light smoked turkey sausage (such as Butterball), doubling and carmelizing the onion before adding to the other ingredients, doubling the green chiles, and adding some canned diced jalapenos. When I do this, I add a little sugar to retain some sweetness. Adding a bit of cumin is a nice touch too. I use light sour cream, half the butter, and a good quality extra sharp chedder cheese.  A nice variation for a bolder flavor. I usually double the recipe and freeze plenty of it. Delish!

I personally didn't care at all for this recipe.  I've never had corn casserole before so maybe I'm just not a corn casserole fan in general.

This was a bit sweet, but overall it was good.  I think if I was to make it again I would add hotter chile peppers, cayenne pepper or some tabasco to lessen the sweetness.

This was a hit at my house. I did make a few modifications suggested by other reviewers: Sauteed the onions in the butter, added one more egg(3 total) and cooked in a 13x9. It was done in about 35 minutes. It didn't get golden on top like I would have liked, will try a hotter oven next time.

Just served this at our Super Bowl BBQ and it was a hit. Imagine a very moist, kind of cheesy, slightly spicy and sweet cornbread. I don't really like corn bread (too plain)and I love this. I exchanged the can of regular corn with a can of Fiesta corn. Next time I think I will use 2 cans of Fiesta corn instead of the cream of corn and use the juice from the can of the chilis for the extra liquid. I think this will be better if its a little more spicy and a little less sweet. I baked mine in 2 cake pans and sliced it pie style for serving. It had the perfect texture and was not dry in all. Definately try this recipe. I think the sweet and spicy variations are a personal preference, but easily changeable to meet everyones needs.

I have made this recipe numerous times. The only change I make is to use a medium onion, coarsely chopped, a 7 oz can of green chilies, and 2 cups (standard small bag) of any cheddar type cheese. I don't think the chilies add too much spice, just a little extra flavor. The extra onions are sweet when cooked for so long and add a nice texture. This is a wonderful recipe that we love.

A favorite in our house. Everyone always asks for this delicious corn "souffle." I skip the onion and green chiles. This is the first item to be completely gone at any family gathering.

This is the perfect corn casserole recipe.  I have been looking for this for several years.  It is just delicious.  It is not the sweet version.  This one is a perfect dinner side dish.  I did leave out the diced green chilies as I did not have any.  It was still yummy.  Thank you.

I did not make a casserole but instead made individual servings of this in muffin tins.  I filled 18 muffin tins, after greasing them, and baked at 350 for 35 minutes.  There were tasty.  The first batch was a little bland for our tastes so I added 2 tbsp chopped fresh chives and 1 cup of chopped ham.  It made a great breakfast.

Made this in a 9x13 dish for the allotted time a day ahead of time to go with enchilada casserole.  Just reheated it in the oven the next day and turned out great!  Next time I probably will add more spices, chili powder, red pepper, etc.

This tastes wonderful! I didn't have muffin mix so I used self-rising cornmeal and it turned out great, kind of like moist cornbread. If you want more zip, I recommend adding jalapenos or hot green chilis.

ABSOLUTELY to die for!  Did not change a thing--perfect the way it is.  I did use 2 cups sharp cheddar only because I comes in 2 cup pre-grated bags, I just sprinkled some on top.  Don't omit the green chiles they don't add heat, just flavor and watch the baking time, you definitely don't want to overcook!!!  I made this for Christmas day and worried about using a new untried recipe but delish!  Everyone devoured it with seconds and fourths!

I know this recipe has been around awhile, but for some reason, I've never tried it...and that was MY MISTAKE!!  I love this.  I like it a little spicier, so I add a few dashes of cayenne.  I had some fresh garden tomatos, I chopped a couple and added those too.  They added some color and tasted great!  This is just one of those great recipes you can have fun with.  I used fresh corn the first time I made it.  Next time I used canned.  Great both ways.  Next time I may add some chopped red pepper.  I don't think you can go wrong!

I am a caterer and frequently get rave reviews about this casserole. Instead of using green chiles, I roast a poblano pepper, remove the skin, chop it up, and add it to the mixture. With a couple of dashes of Tabasco, it gives the casserole a nice southwestern flavor.

Love this recipe!  I also add one additional can of whole corn and 1 tspn (or more to taste) of garlic powder.  I cook it in a cast iron square casserole dish and the texture and taste is perfect every time.  I would give it more then 5 stars.

I made this last night, and I enjoyed it, even w/ the sour cream, which initially made me very skeptical that the sour cream would screw it all up. But it didn't. I would've like to have tastes more of the cream style corn though, so I think next time I will only do 1/2 can of whole kernel corn. and maybe another 1/2 can of cream style. I'm going to play w/ the recipe and make it suit my likings, but in general this recipe was great, so easy to follow! Just to note, I'm allergic to iodine, and used the "no salt added" corns, and I couldn't taste a difference from regular corn w/ salt added.

This is a GREAT corn casserole.  I added pimentos and used jalapenos because I didn't have the green chilies.  My husband loved it and my picky step-son also said it was good.  We will be using this again and again...

I made this for Thanksgiving and took to Potluck.  So many raves about it; my friend said she had to have the recipe, so I gave her the one I printed out.  My betrothed is still raving; we had it last night cold.  I did not put the entire amount of cheese in it but will next time.  Will be making it for Christmas.

I made this for New Years Day dinner at my granddaughters.  Everyone there loved it.  I discovered after it was about half way baked that I had left out the onions (still sitting on the bar)..it was great without the onions and my g'daughter was happy as she doesn't like onions anyway.  I will be making this recipe for most family meals from here on, a definite hit with our many family members.  Addendum: 5/10/09...making a double recipe again today and included the onions...my cousins, friends are all making this great recipe.  I do add another 1/2 cup of extra sharp cheddar cheese, otherwise it is all the same.  Best corn casserole ever!!!

Very excellent recipe.  Moist without being overly wet.  I used frozen corn instead of the canned.  I just don't like the taste of canned corn.  I believe next time I make it I will add hotter chilies as I like things a little  spicier.

I made this for Easter brunch, and it was fabulous. Not a leftover in sight. Even the kids loved it. Very easy...just dump the ingredients into one bowl, stir, dump into the pan, and bake. The flavors and texture were just great. I think I'll try it as a main dish one of these days and add some chicken or ham.

I made it with corn & peppers instead of the whole kernel corn which gave it a nice southwest flavor!  Yummy!  What a great recipe!

I made this recipe for a family get-together and it turned out wonderful!  I omitted the butter and used low fat sour cream to cut down the calories, and used a Mexican blend for the shredded cheese.  Very easy too!

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. This year   I brought it to a potluck and was asked for the recipe by at least 3 people!  I made it just as it is and it was great--fast, easy and even good the next day!

We've enjoyed this several times.  We use 1/2 cup of egg substitute instead of two eggs, 1/4 cup of "light" butter, no cheese.  Makes it a tad healthier and we still love the taste.

This was really good!  I used a full 2 cups of shredded cheese and omitted the chillies (because I forgot to buy them) and it was still very good.  Everyone loved this and I will definitely make this again.

A simple but very tasty recipe.  Be careful not to overcook because it dries the casserole out easily.  I tried cooking it at a higher temperature to go with the meat I was cooking and it came out a little too dry.  There were no complaints at dinner about it however.  A keeper recipe.

Very easy recipe, but it takes a long time to bake.  There was no size for the dish to bake in and I used a round large casserole, the center did not bake in that time.  Next time I will use a 9x13 pan.  Did not put in the butter and it was fine.

This casserole is divine. It absolutely does not need any modifications. I'm lucky to live in the SW, so I defrost some Hatch Chile's to use instead of canned, cook it in my grandmother's Corningware dish, and it comes out perfectly.  To take to a potluck, I put it into a buttered Crock-Pot on low, and in a couple of hours it's heated through. I could eat the whole thing and lick the bowl!

I took this to a potluck where the host was serving chili and it was a great hit. I doubled the recipe leaving one half exactly as the recipe called for. In the other half I added a couple of jalapenos that I sautéed for a few minutes with the onions. The jalapeno version went the quickest but both versions were very popular.

I don't comment often, but I do like this recipe. I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it worked wonderfully (it was practically gone). I doubled the recipe, extended the cooking time and added extra cheese on top for the browning effect.  I did have some little leftovers (I made too much)and took what little I had left home; but it does taste fantastic the next day. This year, I'm making this for my mom's potluck lunch at work (she doesn't cook).  Last year, I used a 10x12 after doubling the recipe; this year I am using a small 2-quart as the recipe states to make a single batch.  My only suggestion is that if folks like spicy, add more onions and chilies; if not keep to the recipe, add the cheese on top. I bought extra cheddar chees to top, since this was for multiple folks. Overall, I think this is an awesome base recipe with wonderful abilities for altering to taste. There's a great sweet and spicy flavor for all. Just gauge your guests and what they like. This is a fantastic Thanksgiving side... just try it beforehand and SLIGHTLY alter the tastes according to your guests. :) I personally LOVE it as is (oh, I have always used JIFFY corn muffin mix... it works awesome! :)

This was great.  It is a wonderful side dish.  I added a can of hot chilies in place of regular green chilies.  My family loved this dish.  I'm going to make this one of my side dishes for Thanksgiving.

I used this as a side dish for spaghetti and fried asparagus. Add jalapenos to it to give it a extra kick and bring it together. Really good. This will be a staple in my household from now on.

Wow!  I was looking for a new side dish to serve with Xmas dinner.  We were fixing something a little different than the typical turkey dinner (seasoned boneless pork roast). Followed the corn casserole recipe exactly and it was excellent. It was similar to dressing but with a twist. I used Jiffy box cornbread mix ( I don't know if that added anything extra in the way of flavor but thought it worth mentioning). Everyone just raved about it and cooked as instructed it was very moist with the cheese browned on top. A few reviews mentioned worrying about it being too dry with the full amount of corn bread mix. I didn't find that to be a problem. Next time I think I will switch out jalapeños instead of the green chillis. We decided we could go for that extra tangy kick. I highly recommend this recipe. It was very fast and easy to make.

I have been making this casserole for about 6 years, now, and my family is always so excited every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I make one with the chiles and one without (for the kids). It's my 10-year-old daughter's favorite food at the holidays and SO easy to make! Try it, I guarantee it'll be a hit for years to come!

This was good.  It was a nice change from the normal dishes I cook.  I used a 7 oz can of green chiles instead of 4 oz and next time I will probably use more.  Takes forever to bake though!

yum! Forgot to add cheese and chillies but it was still really yummy. In fact, I don't think the extra calories from the cheese are necessary.

By far the BEST corn casserole I have ever made! I didn't change a thing, besides adding the entire package of cheese. This recipe is fantastic, it's definitely the sour cream that makes this casserole so much better than any other I have tried. I made it for Thanksgiving this year and it was hit. I, myself, liked it so much that I made another the following Sunday. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I lost this recipe during the divorce and went on line to try and find it. Except for the chilies it's the same! This is far and away one of the best out there! I can't wait to make it this Thanksgiving!!!!

We made this yesterday for a family supper and added 1/2 cup celery and one jalapeno from the garden to the onions when they were sauteed.  We did not have the can of green chiles.  This came out FANTASTIC!  Sweet and spicy and savory all at once.  The family raved.  I would leave out the chile/jalapeno if making for children, they were not fans of the spice.  I will make it again.

I have been making this dish for years and it is always a hit and I get requests for it at Holiday gatherings.... I never thought to put green chilis in it and I will try that and maybe some chopped sweet red pepper.

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner for YEARS!!!  Its always a hit!  I don't put in onion because i'm allergic, but love the taste that the green chilies give it.  Its important to let the sour cream sit out a while so its easy to dollop on top.  I add paprika and salt and pepper on the top.

I made this for the first time today, for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly.  It was great, but just a little bland.  I'll definitely make it again, but will try adding some different seasonings.

Huge success at our Thanksgiving dinner!  I did cook it for longer than suggested.  I also let it sit for at least 30 minutes before serving.  It was amazing!  I used the exact amounts of ingredients in the original recipe.  Excellent!

Everyone said this was the best thing on the table at a family dinner where many brought dishes.  I used Del Monte Creamed Corn and 1/2 cup sharp cheddar and 1 cup mild cheddar.  The chilies do not add heat, just flavor, so don't let them scare you.  I left it in the oven for 90 minutes.

I've made this twice and love it.  I convection bake this about 45-50 minutes and add a bit more cheese.  Very good.

This was pretty good. I used "olivio" instead of butter and light sour crream. I also used only 3/4c of cheese. I poured into 2 8x8pans and froze one. Mine was done in about 45min. but the rest of dinner wasnt so I turned off the oven and left it in for another 45min was still hot and perfectly set. Was sweeter than I imagined.

This is my first review and I felt compelled to write this because I want to say how much we enjoyed this casserole! Took this to easter dinner. My son who is very picky asked for seconds, and the leftovers were just as good.  Definately will make this again!

This is a great recipe! I used frozen corn instead of canned and it worked fine. I added a teaspoon of chili pepper and a dash of some very hot red pepper flakes to give it a little more of a kick as well. The knife didn't come out clean but I let it sit about ten minutes and the consistency was fine. This one is a keeper!

Super quick and easy to put together. Three out of five of us like it. I used egg substitute and light sour cream.  1/2 cup of fresh onion seemed liked way too much so used about a tablespoon of dried minced onion.

This was great.  I think it could use more cheese, though because I couldn't taste the cheese at all and I love cheese.  Maybe next time I'll sprinkle some over the top just as it's coming out of the oven.

This was probably the best side dish at my family's Thanksgiving Dinner, this year. And I'm not just saying that because I made it. It was moist, full of flavour, and impressed even the toughest of critics in my family!

I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe, except that the 1.5 cups of cheese can be more if you like. The jalapenos can be optional, and I found that a black olive or two adds a little bit of colour to this dish.

Very easy to make! Very delicious! I plan on making this year after year now!!!

This was pretty good.  My kids loved it.  I doubled the recipe and it made a very large pan.  The next day I had made BBQd chicken legs in the crockpot with sweet baby ray's sauce.  I took the casserole, sliced it into meatloaf shaped pieces, topped it with some of the BBQ sauce from the chicken and sprinkled with some gorgonzola cheese and reheated it and THAT was fabulous!!

Good recipe but mine needs tweaking... I didn't have a can of creamed corn or chilis so I used two cans of whole kernel instead and left the chilis out all together. I added a little milk to make up for the moisture lost from not having the creamed corn but I didn't add enough and as a result it turned out dry.  My boyfriend, however, loved it.  I think the next time I make it I'll make sure I have the correct ingredients on hand and I'm sure it will be better.  My boyfriend also said it reminded him of quiche.  While I'm not sure about it tasting like quiche it was good even though it was dry.

My husband is from Nebraska and considers himself a connoisseur of corn casserole.  He wasn't happy when I strayed from my typical recipe - until he tasted this one.  He loved it. This is now our standard recipe.  I did omit the onion.

My family has several outstanding cooks - and even those with "gourmet" tastes love this recipe. I'm asked to bring this dish to most family get togethers. It's really yummy and easy to prepare.

This recipe is so good!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and was so happy with it.  I didn't add the chilies but made it just as the recipe states.  It smelled incredible while it was baking and looked like a picture.  It also warmed up great.

This was awesome!!  I was a little intimidated with the cheese and onion but it was just superb!!  My husband doesn't like anything with sour cream in it and he thought it was terrific.  Everyone has asked for the recipe when I have made it for family gatherings.  I thought I was pushing my luck by using the sour cream when I made it for the family so I didnt add the green chiles and it was still great.

This was a very good recipe. It was better than I thought it would be. My parents and sister thought it was good. The only thing I'd do differently next time is add sharp Cheddar instead of mild (I know the recipe didn't specify one over the other). It really just depends on your tastes. I might even try adding a little salt and pepper next time.

Made this for a father's day barbeque and everyone loved it.  I even used fat free sour cream (I normally wouldn't but that's what my dad had on hand) and it was still very good.  Thank you!

I needed a last minute recipe for a potluck gathering this afternoon.  I doubled the recipe and did not change a thing.  What a surprise!  People were going back for seconds and thirds and were begging for the recipe.  THIS RECIPE IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER.

WOW! I wouldn't change a thing. This was perfect. The exact thing I was looking for. I particularly liked the chili's added. No spice to them (you could probably do Jalapeno's if you wanted) but just a great flavor. Got great reviews! (I served with a touch of sour cream on each serving. Nice addition)

This is one of the best corn casserole recipes ever!  I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe: used egg substitute, used margerine instead of butter, added 4 oz. can of diced jalapenos (drained), and didn't add the onion (my hubby doesn't care for onions) and it still turned out very YUMMY!  Next time I make this, I'll probably use less cheese (my hubby's preference) but it will definitely be a regular in our recipe book!

This is the second corn casserole recipe that I've tried from this website and it was the best, by far!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  Very moist.  Although not much was left over, it was even better the next day when warmed in the microwave.  This recipe will remain on our Thanksgiving menu!

I have made this same recipe many times before (obtained from a co-worker) but never before with the peppers & onions.  I used jalapenos instead of green chiles, added a dash of cayenne and it was so good!  I made a pan with spicy and one without for a family party and the hot one was gone!
Thanks!

Very tasty!  I made this for a family reunion and it went over well.  The chiles give it a little kick, and I might add a few more next time.  I'll definitely make this one again.

Very good.  I didn't use any chilis or spicy things though, and it turned out great.  It really was all the great things the other posters described.  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe multiple times now, and it hasn't let me down.  It's become a Thanksgiving standard at my house, and is FAB as a side dish for barbeque.  I substitute pepperjack cheese for the cheddar to get a little more zing. If I know people who like things really hot will be eating it, I'll mince up a fresh serrano chili or two and put those in the mixture prior to baking.  Be careful, because it can get really hot very easily!

I made this at Christmas.  I had made this before w/out the chiles or the onion and my family loved it.  I thought the chiles and onion would change the taste but didn't see much of a difference.  I'll probably go back to my original recipe.

This recipe is wonderful!!!!  After using it a few times I have made a couple minor changes.  I drop the temp to 325 instead of 350 so it doesn't burn, and I fry a few slices of bacon, crumble them up pretty fine and add them.  The smoky bacon flavor compliments the corn and green chilie flavor very nicely!

This is not a recipe I will be trying again. I think it is probably a good dish for some people.  It has some delicious ingredients in it. But, my husband and I do not like corn in this fashion. My grandchildren did not eat any of it for Christmas dinner.

I felt I needed an extra side dish for Thanksgiving and thought something with corn would be perfect.  This was easy and a big hit.  I plan to make it again next year.  Notes -- I had to bake it longer than 1 hour.  Also, I used mild chilies.  Next time I might use medium hot.

This is very good! Very rich too.  I used light sour cream and used white pepper in the dish.  My husband is requesting this again.  I look forward to making it when we have company over. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy and delicious.  Goes great with chili.  I typically leaves out the green chiles however.

Perfect comfort side dish and so easy to prepare!  

I had to dice up some adobo red peppers since I didn’t have green chilies and just guesstimated a half a cup of diced onion, but those are insignificant changes because the dish came out splendid.

It formed up perfectly enough to cut and serve with a spatula without breaking apart and everybody had second helpings except the little girl who filled up on fried chicken.

Only thing I I changed was sautéed peppers, green and red onions. Also, sautéed the canned corn before mixing .

My husband liked it, I like scalloped corn better, which is more sweet than savory.  I didn't like the peppers, he did.  So it is all in a person's taste.  The recipe is fine.  I froze 3 bags, each enough for a side dish at another meal for us.

I doubled recipe, had to use cottage cheese/milk/lemon juice substitute due to not having any sour cream, used frozen onions, no green chilies, and added s&p. Baking it now, we shall see how it turns out!

I have made this in the past and it's a really good side dish or if you added ham for instance it would almost be a meal or hearty snack food. Everyone loves it.  I should think of doing this more often - also very economical.

Always a favorite.  We use a larger pan to make it a little thinner because we all like it a little crispy on the edges.  I use the Jiffy mix as well.  The green chili adds a little kick without heat.

I split the recipe into two batches.   One per the recipe and one with modifications.   Both were very good but I liked the one with the mods better.   I added diced green, red and yellow bell pepper and extra cheese.  Plus a little extra salt and pepper. I liked it because it had more taste, more texture and much gooey from the cheese.  But both were very good.   Next time I’m gonna add some picco de gallo. This will go well with chili or stew. Instead of corn bread.  I think I’ll also try it with more corn bread mixture.

Made it exactly to recipe for a work cookout. Everyone loved it. For me personally I would have put in another chilies or red pepper flakes to cut the sweetness a little bit. But I really did love it. Thank you

This was the first time I made corn casserole and it was really good. Sweet and creamy and  served well! I followed the recipe except for only using about 3/4 to 1 cup of extra sharp cheddar....I didn't measure, just grated it into the bowl... and no green chilies so I finely chopped jarred hot jalapenos which gave it a little bite  that was a nice addition.  Thank you for sharing! I will definitely do this again!

I added a finely chopped jalapeño from my garden and sautéed it along with the onions before adding them to the recipe. It was  fantastic and my Thanksgiving guests asked for the recipe.

This is the second time I have made this.  Both times, due to dietary restrictions of my loving wife, I have substituted about a 1/2 cup of lactose and fat free milk for the sour cream.  It still comes out wonderfully!  A nice, pudding- like consistency, with a touch of background spiciness from the chilis.  Big hit both time I have made it, for two different groups.

Excellent!  My husband even ate it cold.  First time I made it, after reading other reviews and changes, I left out the eggs. I'm going to try again today using fresh jalapeños and onion, and bake a little longer.  From reading the reviews and my own experiments it seems foolproof.  Jiffy corn mix, whole corn, cream corn, sour cream, onion and peppers and cheese on top. Yum!

This is a hit every time I make it!  I do sometimes make it in a 9 x 13 pan and that works as well.  For a higher casserole, make it in the smaller casserole dish (2 quart as called for).  This is just yummy!

I have been making this corn casserole recipe for many years, my all time favorite.  The chilies add so much to this recipe.  I don’t change a thing!

Made it as written.  My MIL always made the plain jane corn casserole and I thought this would be better or have a little kick.  Not worth it.  The plain recipe (no eggs, no chilis) is better.

I would rate this more than 5 stars if I could.  Just made it to have with dinner, and my husband and college age sons could not stop raving about it.   I made it exactly as written, and the consistency came out just perfect.  It was moist, but not soupy, and the guys were fighting over the crispier corner pieces which had browned a bit.   One of my sons is not a fan of spicy food, so this was perfect for us, because others could sprinkle some of the favorite hot sauce on their serving.   My boys are also learning to cook in their own apartments now, and both wanted me to mail them this recipe.    It's a keeper!

I love this recipe...the only difference I made was use Zataran's Corn bread mix for an extra kick in flavor.  I also make this with other add-ins to make it a complete meal, such as sausage or ham.  You can add bell peppers, etc.  I usually add fresh finely chopped jalapeno.  This is a family favorite and well worth the wait!

My hubby usually does all the cooking.  I made this and he absolutely loved it.  He even asked if we had any left over!  He never eats leftovers, but he ate this.  A big hit.  Thanks so much.

Made this fabulous dish last night with minor changes. Used 6 oz. Jalapeno cream cheese and 6 oz. sour cream. Half cheddar and half Monterrey jack cheeses, shredded. Small can of green chiles. Sauteed half a diced onion and two seeded jalapenos. Sprinkled cayenne on top before baking for 65 minutes at 350. Came out perfectly browned and just moist enough. Let set 15 minutes. Beautiful blend of heat and sweet.

I was very pleased with this recipe. The only changes I made was to add 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic and increased the green chilie to about 1/3 cup of medium hot New Mexico Hatch green chilie I had in my freezer. Thanks!

I hate reviews that the reviewer changes a bunch of ingredients.  The ONLY thing I substituted was the corn.  I used a bag of "fresh" corn we had from last year, that may have been a bit over both cans content wise, and the juice that was in it.  It came out perfect and the picky kids ate it all.  The next time I may put jalapeño in instead of green chilies, or maybe a drained can of rotel to give it some kick, or some seasonings.

This was delicious! I made it exactly by the recipe. Mine was done in one hour, not the 75 minutes called for. My son suggested  that a couple chopped jalapeños would make it even better, but then we Texans tend to think jalapeños make everything better!

Great recipe.  The only thing that I changed was to omit the can of green chiles and replaced the onion with green onion.
It was cooked in less than 75 minutes. Thanks again!!

Recipe was so simple and tastes so good. This was the first time I tasted corn casserole though. It would be good if you can clarify "...inserted knife comes out clean". Do you mean no tiny lumps? or squeaky clean? Mine still left "streaks" after 70 min. top was golden.

made for company to go with our stuffed green pepper dish. Everyone loved it. I added chopped green onions. Cooked till golden brown. I didn't know where to use the butter, so I just put the 4 Tablespoons on the top and it helped it brown.

I didn't add the chiles.  Otherwise, it was PERFECT!  I made it for an office party.  I will definitely redo for Thanksgiving.  I told my co-workers that I omitted the green chiles.  they were grateful and felt the recipe was great without it.  personally I would have liked to try it with the chiles.

I made it and it was ok. I'll try once again with jiffy corn bread. I think it would have tasted a lot better with sweeter cornbread. I also left the chilies and onions out. I don't care for them.

This is always a favorite request for potlucks, by mistake I used jalapeño peppers (diced) 4 oz. can instead of chili peppers. I think I like it better, really good!!!

Good change from plain corn...but not a favorite of mine.  I am not a fan of canned corn, and used frozen for the can of regular, but still used the can of creamed corn...may try it again using all frozen or fresh corn...( I think it was the canned corn, that ruined it for me.)

I've been making this recipe for thanksgiving for 5 years and it's always a big hit. The first 4 years it has taken about twice the cooking time. But this year, I took it out of the oven every 15 minutes to stir and as a result-baking time was slashed to 45 minutes! Last fifteen minutes I sprinkled the cheese on top

It was delicious and easy. I took it to a potluck and got some compliments. I added an extra cup of frozen corn and a cup of diced colorful sweet peppers. The only problem was that it didn't rise at all.

Just a heads up if you were looking for something vegetarian. This comes up in a search for vegetarian recipes, but if you use a corn bread mix like Jiffy, it contains lard.

I ate the whole thing! I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except I only used 1/2 a can of the green chilies and a 6.5 oz bag of corn bread mix. I also ended up cooking it for about 85 minutes to give it a nice color. I served it for dinner with chilli and my family loved it. I ended up eating the leftovers for lunch for the rest of the week. Sooo good.

Delicious!I used what I had on hand, so I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used a smaller can of creamed corn, 2 oz less sour cream, 1/2 c cheddar cheese and a can of mexicorn with the chiles. The result was great. My mother and boyfriend gobbled it up. I can only imagine how much better it would be if I had all the ingredients.

My family really enjoyed this. My new oven seems to work hot, so I reduced the temp to 325, used a rectangular glass 3 qt pan, and after 1 hour it was beginning to brown around the edges, and it was done. We ended up eating a bit earlier than planned!

A great side dish for the smoked Wild Turkey that hunter hubby made. I lightened it up with light sour cream and light butter, also used frozen corn instead of additional can of canned kernal corn. Very tasty!

First time trying corn casserole. Followed the recipe as it was written but added bell peppers and it turned out great! I didn't personally care for the casserole but my daughter and husband LOVED it! He said he didn't think 'corn could taste this good!'

Other than exchanging the canned whole kernel corn with  12 oz. frozen yellow sweet corn, I made this as directed.  I used a flat 2 qt. casserole dish and it took about 1 1/2 hours to cook.  Everyone at the family gathering loved it, even the young kids.  I will make this. again. Thanks for sharing.

We have made a version of this recipe for years, only I substitute mayo for the eggs, sourcream and butter, as it makes it even easier and creamier!  Crushed red pepper flakes can easily be substituted for the chile peppers in a pinch, and I generally use parmesan cheese instead of the chedder, but it always gets rave reviews at holiday dinners.  Also, if I'm serving a large crowd I just use a bag of frozen corn, and parboil first.  Works everytime.  Awesome sidedish!!

This is very good. I make it using Mexican cornbread mix. Not as sweet as Jiffy and gives it an extra kick.

I thought this was a great find!  Looking for a different type of corn side for Thanksgiving and was happy to come across this.  I had a half  red bell pepper I needed to use up so I diced and replaced it for the green chilies, and when I do make this again I will probably stick with the change as we all loved the flavor it gave.  I may use half green and red for Xmas dinner for that festive look! And yes, it did have a souffle quality.

I cooked for about an hour at 360 degrees due to time constraints, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Was very tasty, no complaints.

Love this recipe! I made it once at Christmas and have been asked to make it again every year. I use cream cheese instead of the sour cream and reduce the corn muffin mix to a 1/4 package, but still love the orginal recipe.

I used low-fat sour cream, a little less butter, about 1/4c onion, and I added about 1 tablespoon diced jalapeno. I cooked this in a 2 quart glass bowl which I believe made it a little "soggy", but next time I will use a flat square dish to "dry" it out a little more for my taste.  Great recipe, thanks!

My Family didn't like this at all.  It's not cornbread and it isn't corn souffle... it's likw old fashion corn cakes, mushy corn bread with corn in it.

This recipe is awesome. I don't change a thing except sometimes I leave out the green chiles depending on who I'm making it for. I usually take it out of the oven before completely done in the middle to prevent the edges from getting too done. A lot of people ask me for this recipe.

Very good recipe.  Used sweet corn bread for more flavor.  Spiced it with white pepper and garlic. It was a crispy crust and sweet corn flavor.  Will make again and again and again.....

I added this recipe, minus the onions and green chilies, to our Thanksgiving repertoire last year.  It was the biggest hit of the day.  Great texture and just the right amount of sweetness.  There was a tiny amount left over and it was even good cold!  We're doubling it this year so we'll have plenty of leftovers.

Very tasty!!!!!!!!!! I made this for potluck and everyone loved it. I left out the chilies (not sure if everyone would have liked them). But, it was still great. Next time I'll add them for us. This is going to be a new standard in our home. Thanks for the great & easy recipe.

I made this for a Christmas get-together last night for the first time and everyone loved it!  I cooked it in a slightly larger dish (2.8L) and my oven runs a tad hotter so I cooked it for the recommended 1 hour and 15 minutes.  It came out perfect!

This is very easy to make and is pretty good overall.  It might be the corn muffin mix I used (Jiffy), but the casserole was too sweet for me and my family.  If I make it again, I will look for a sugar free muffin mix and perhaps use hot chiles instead of mild to cut the sweetness.

This is absolutely delicious! I made it for a party and everyone loved it! i did leave out the chilis and seasoned it with our southern favorite, Tony Chachere's.  And it only needed to cook for 45 minutes. It was perfect. I am makink again for Christmas!

I made this last night for my husband and three children. All in all pretty good...the kids ate it so that is always a good sign...I would add maybe a little sugar or something to sweeten it up some but I will definitley be making this again.

This was sooo good! I made it on Thanksgiving and all 15 people that were at my house loved it, even my picky father-in-law who won't eat anything with sour cream in the ingredient list. Thanks! This is a real keeper!!

This is just the best! I had to triple the recipe for our family Thanksgiving, using a 16 x 11 pan. It had to cook a little longer than stated I'm sure because of the amount I made. Nothing was left and there were raves all around! Thanks so much!

I'm not much of a cook, but was looking for something different as a side dish. This was a hit, all of family loved it and wants me to make it for Thanksgiving dinner. If I can do this, anyone can.

This casserole was delicious.  I probably would have rated it a five if I could have converted the rest of the family into liking it.  I love corn casseroles, but neither my husband or two children would have anything to do with it, even though they all liked the ingredients it took to make it.  On a great note, if you have alot of leftovers, like I did, it is easy to store, and tastes just as good re-heated for lunches within the next week!

I was looking for a nice side to go with my Pan Fried/Oven Baked pork chops. The was a very simple easy wonderful recipe. I did use reduced fat cheese and sour cream, I also subbed egg beaters in and added some diced Jalepenos and the flavor was very enjoyable.  As soon as a little cooler weather hits, I will do up some chilli and my new favorite corn casserole.

I was looking for something besides rice or potatoes to serve as a side dish, and this fit the bill.  I wasn't really wow-ed by it but it was a nice change and my five year olds loved it.  They even had it for breakfast the next day.  I followed all directions but cut back a bit on the butter.  Like I said, a nice change from the usual but not really memorable.

This turned out very nice!  I substituted fresh chopped seranno chile for the canned chiles and used green onions.  I baked it a little longer to crisp up a nice crust.  Delicious!

Loved this recipe!  Wasn't going to add the chilies but I'm glad I did.  It was perfect!  Going to make it for a holiday party at work and it will definitely become part of my holiday dinners at home.

I didn't like it much at all, but my husband loved it.  I took it to a covered dish gathering I attend monthly and no one commented on it, which is usually a sign that it wasn't their favorite, either.  But I will make it again for my husband :)

Great recipe! I double it, using one can mild chiles and one can of jalapenos for an extra kick. I've brought it to several potlucks and it is always a huge hit.

This was pretty good, it tasted like a mexican cornbread recipe I have. It wasnt what I would consider a casserole I guess. I might make again, but will continue to look for another recipe.

This was a really great recipe.  Easy to make and tasty.  Smelled great too!  It kind of reminds me of the sweet corn relish that is sometimes served at mexican restaurants - but not as sweet.

I personally loved this recipe.  I used Jalapenos instead of green chile for added heat.  My Indonesian friend loved it too  and asked for the recipe.
