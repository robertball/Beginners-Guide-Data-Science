I love Carrot Cake! I have my own recipe that's a winner with friends and family, but I wanted to try it with whole wheat flour to see if I could tell a big difference in taste. Well, I tried this cake recipe (Carrot Cake X) minus the wheat germ this past weekend (9/19/04) and I loved it. Everyone who sampled a piece enjoyed it as well. The whole wheat flour gives the cake a nice texture, and it doesn't change the taste of the cake! This is definately a winner in my book!!

Amazing! I followed recipe except healthier choices. I used splenda for the sugar and apple sauce for the oil. I only used half cream cheese frosting from one of the other carrot cake recipes. Great Recipe!

I added low-fat homemade cream cheese icing to keep it relatively healthy.

This is very good and you feel good eating it!  I did change a few things.  I used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil, used only 3/4 c of sugar, replaced the coconut with raisins (I made this for my 1 yr olds b-day and he loves rasins :) ) and cut the nuts in half.  He loved it and we did too.  I did cheat and use the cream cheese frosting from Carrot Cake III from here.  I had extra batter so I made muffins for my husbands breakfast.  Will definetly be making this again!

Unfortunately I did not get to actually taste this recipe, BUT after sending it to work with my Hubby I got requests for more! I wanted to make this into a double layer cake so I added a quarter more of everything.  To make this a bit healthier I subbed Unsweetened Applesauce for the Oil.  ALSO, I did not have Wheat Germ so I substituted All Purpose Flour in its place.  For no particular reason I also added a touch of Orange Juice.  Hee hee!  And to finish it off I frosted with homemade cream cheese icing.  Hmmmm... Wish I had tried it!

I baked this cake on the recommendation, and with the assistance, of a friend because it is a healthier option for a delicious treat. We substituted the sugar with just over 1 1/4 cups of honey and followed the recipe otherwise. It was DELICIOUS! While the cake is quite dense, as a carrot cake should be, it was also very moist without having an undue amount of oil present. I would highly recommend this cake based on taste alone, the fact that it is a healthier option is a lovely benefit! Give it a try, you will be delighted!

Really heavy but then again  carrot cake is a heavy cake. Tasty. Probably one of the healthiest versions of carrot cake out there. I might modify it next time with added raisins and sugar substitute. This time I used olive oil and it was fine. I highly recommend this recipe.

Astounding! I, like everyone , made a few changes. I doubled this recipe and it actually made enough for a 3 layer cake! I used no wheat germ , but added 1 cup of applesauce, 1/4 c of orange juice , 1 c of golden raisins, and 4 small plastic containers of pureed carrot baby food! For spicing, I used, ginger, nutmeg , clove and cinnamon to taste.Deliciously moist!

This is what I was looking for! Had a great carrot cake at a little bistro with whole wheat, pineapple, nuts and so soft. This one does it. I will probably add a few more carrots next time.

This cake is absolutely delicious!  I didn't use any kind of icing with it because it was just sweet enough and the flavor was just right that it didn't need it.  Yummy!!  Has a more sophisticated flavor than regular cakes, so both the adults and the children enjoyed it!

Excellent and moist. I didn't even ice this as I made them into muffins. You can't tell this is made with whole wheat and wheat germ! The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the obscene amount of oil. I will try some of the other reviewers tips next time, but this is definetly my new carrot cake recipe!

I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce and cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cup (since applesauce is naturally sweeter than oil).  I prefer to pre-cook my carrots, and added cream cheese frosting. Delicious! It doesn't even taste whole wheat. Next time I am going to try replacing the sugar with maple syrup to cut down even more on the processed ingredients.

i also substituted pineapple for the coconut because i'm not a huge fan of coconut and it turned out delicious!  It's kind of dense, but still very moist, so everyone ended up having smaller portions too

Very good for being so healthy.  Of course, it had a nice layer of cream cheese frosting too.  I took suggestions from others and made the following modifications. * only 1 cup sugar * no oil * 1 cup unsweetened applesauce * closer to 3 cups carrots * coconut was sweetened (part of the reason I reduced the sugar)

I've never failed a recipe before, but I didn't like this one. Batter and cake had a strange, non-cake like texture. It was also dry. I substituted applesauce for half of the oil. Used coconut oil for the other half. It says it is done when it springs back, what about when it feels like a brick?

This was heavenly it was so moist and delicious I made a few changes. I didn't use any of the pineapple and I substitute take some of that oil for applesauce. Also the icing that I used was actually a cream cheese and sugar and vanilla blend.  I will definitely make this again.

This cake was a huge success and so easy to make! Every bite was so flavourful &  moist! I highly recommend it BUT it requires a cream cheese icing to complete it!
