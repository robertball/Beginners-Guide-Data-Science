Great recipe for a side dish to a main entree. I used a 1/2 cup of french onion dip instead of the sour cream. Gives it just the zip that it needs. It also may eliminate the need for chives depending on your taste...   I also sprinkled the top with buttered bread crumbs and parm cheese with a hint of Italian dressing mixed in... Baked the same amount of time.

I've made variations on this for years, but I want to pass on a holiday hint: Make these in any amount you want--I use 5 lbs. potatoes, 8 oz. cream cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and seasoned salt as a rule--and then put 'em in a crock pot on warm. Stir occasionally because the top "sweats" a bit, and you can keep them as long as you want. My daughter and I use 3 crocks for Thanksgiving dinner--one for potatoes, one for dressing, and one for green beans. REALLY cuts down on the rushing around when it's time to get dinner on.

Turned out awesome. My husband always begs me to make twice baked potaotes so I finally did and I made these. They were quick and easy. I bought the cream cheese with chives in it and it tasted sooo good! I would definantly make again. Hubby wants them again tomorrow!

Preparing mashed potatoes this way is not new for me - it's how I routinely make them.  I just wanted to pass the word around about how good they are, how rich and delicious.  I never measure anything, I just add the sour cream, butter and cream cheese to taste - and for my taste that means lots of all of it!  I've never added onion salt before - in fact I don't have it in my cupboard. I do have Penzey's shallot salt tho,' and it did seem to give the potatoes a little extra flavor.  These are also nice using other herbs as a variation or addition.

The potatoes were good though not what I expected. They seemed to be missing something and weren't very flavorful. My kids struggled to finish their portions of potatoes because of the lack of flavor. However my husband and I thought that they were good enough to eat. Still I would add a little something extra to this next time to make it more flavorful. Perhaps some roasted garlic or a bit of cheddar mixed in would kick it up a notch. Still a great base to work with. Thanks for posting!

Delicious and super-easy!  I prepared this dish the day before I hosted a "big-family" dinner.  The next day all I had to do was I bring the dish up to room temperature before putting it in the oven.  It received rave reviews from everyone!!!

I made these at christmas dinner and they were loved...by everyone except me. I thought they tasted nothing like mashed potatoes so next time i will just add chives to normal mashed potatoes.

Yummmmmmm... I followed most of the recipe. Accidentally dropped lots of oregano... turned out awesome. Since I was just making it for home, I sprinkled half the dish with parmesan and bread crumbs and the other half with cheddar and baked at 350 for 15 mins. Both sides tasted great and I tried out 2 variations at one go :-)

I don't know how anybody could think these were bland.  ummm they were DELICIOUS!  Five stars all the way.  I doubled the recipe and ended up having lots of delicious left-overs.

I've been making these for years and it's the only mashed potato recipe my family will eat. I do add 2-3 cloves of freshly minced garlic, about 1 tbsp parsley and about 3 tbsp of chives, then top with some shredded SHARP cheddar cheese (just a thin layer) before the paprika.

These are also wonderful for left-overs! Of course, I have to triple the recipe to have any left overs in my house. We add a couple raw eggs (1/person), stir very well, and then make them into patties. Then lightly sprinkle with flour then fry with a scant amount of oil until crisp & browned. Great for breakfast the next morning!

These don't have a real strong flavor, so you might not want to use them for the main event, but as a side dish to a very flavorfully marinated steak, they were great. They were nice and thick, and they did have a nice and subtle sour cream and chive flavor. If you like cheesy mashed potatoes, I bet this would lend itself well to adding cheddar cheese into the mix. I might experiment to try to punch up the flavor next time, but they were still quite good as-is.

First of all, I had no onion salt...so I did 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp onion powder.  Also, reading the reviews about it being bland, I tasted it & added some extra onion powder, seasoning salt, and garlic plus.
I also stirred in some bacon bits...Then topped it with cheese about 10 minutes before it was done.
They were pretty good...but not really anything special.  Especially for all of the extra calories/fat.  Nice for a change, but don't expect to impress.

I have made my mashed potatoes with this same recipe for a long time.  I always have scallions (chopped and frozen), so I used them in place of the chives.  I also use this recipe for twice-baked potatoes, adding a little shredded cheddar and/or crushed french fried onions on top.  A big hit!

these are the BEST mashed potatoes you can ever make!!  I've been making these since 1981...and STILL get requests for the recipe.  It's the only way my son would eat mashed potatoes (he never cared for mashed potatoes with gravy)  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!!!!!!

We've made a similar version called"Refrigerator Mashed Potatoes" since the '70's. Ours has the cream cheese, sour cream, onion salt & pepper, but we also use garlic salt (1/2 onion salt & 1/2 garlic salt) - maybe a 1/4 t. of each, or to taste.  I don't use the paprkia.  I put them in a greased casserole, dot with butter and bake at 350 for about 30 minutes or until hot. Always delicious and can be reheated many times. If you have leftover plain mashed potatoes, you can doctor them up with the ingredients in this recipe and bake. These were called "Refrigerator Mashed Potatoes" because you can make them up and keep them in the refrigerator for many days!

Very good. I added chopped green onions,  1 tablespoon dried parsley,1 teaspoon garlic powder,1 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon dried basil,1/2 teaspoon dried thyme,1/4 teaspoon paprika 1/4 teaspoon chili powder,1/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 teaspoon dried dill weed to the sour cream then stirred in after mashing. I too added real bacon bits, herb bread crumbs and shredded cheese on top before baking. After the additions it was 5 stars!

Made these potatoes according to the recipe, and they were pretty good, although I prefer the tang of mashed potatoes made with plain yogurt as opposed to sour cream and cream cheese (healthier too!). I liked that they were nice and thick. Thanks!

These were delicious!  I made a minor adjustment, I added some very finely chopped onion & cheddar cheese on the top for the last minutes in the oven.  My boyfriend loved them!

I thought they were super delicious. They are the FIRST mashed potatoes that my 3 year old would eat. I did grate cheddar cheese on the top before I baked them. FANTASTIC!

I thought perhaps a little dry, but my family liked them as was.  I would definitely add cream cheese at room temp to get a better mix.  The potatoes seemed to be better the next day.  Plenty of room to play around with this recipe and create something to your taste.

I thought these potatoes were yummy!  I would add way more chives--they added soooo much flavor and texture.  Delicious and creamy potatoes, albeit not particularly heart-healthy!

I made these for Thanksgiving and put them in the fridge overnight like suggested. We were all excited to taste them and were very disappointed. They were bland at best and nothing special. I didn't want to waste them, so we made potato pancakes and in that form, they were way better. I won't be making these again....

I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great. My family gobbled these up. My only disappointment was that there were no left overs! The only thing I might change about this is to try low fat dairy products and a little less onion salt.

Excellent potato recipe. My wife, the mashed potato afficionado of the family, truly loved these and wants to have them again soon. Next time, I might try some reduced fat ingredients to see how they impact overall taste and texture. Outstanding as written, though!

I did not care for this.  I am a fan of different types of mash potato recipes, however, it was very bland with the cream cheese and sour cream and when I added the onion it was to over powering.

These are DELICIOUS with excellent flavor. I'll never make mashed potatoes without sour cream and cream cheese again! UPDATE: I just reheated the leftovers for dinner tonight but I stirred in a handful of sharp cheddar cheese. They tasted like the instant cheddar potatoes but MUCH better! If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would!

This recipe leads to a salty, tangy, complex flavor- which isn't bad, not wholly unrelated to sour cream and onion potato chips, except with cream cheese. The cream cheese flavor really doesn't help, in my opinion, and my Thanksgiving guests were, at best, unenthusiastic. I ate it, I've had better, and I can't say I plan on making it again.

I found these to be very bland, but a good foundation for great mashed potatoes. After I added a bit of garlic powder, a few dashes of oregano, and some milk, they were delicious!

I made these mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner- with all the fixing. Even though there were three of us, and all that food, these potatoes didn't stand a chance and were gone quickly. We added some garlic powder and onion powder also topped with cheddar cheese. I could see these being yummy with some crumbled bacon on em. And I just realized I totally forgot the paprika, which probably would have made it even better-oops!

Delicious!  I made this recipe as written, except I substitued scallions for the chives.  It was great for my dinner party -- I could make it ahead, then just throw it in the oven without thinking about it.  I am bringing these potatoes to my sister's for Thanksgiving, but plan to use the crock pot to heat them.

~Very quick & easy to make. it kind of had the taste of twice baked potatoes but without all the time & effort. You could also embellish this to suit your tastes..Next time I will try it w/cheddar cheese or bacon bits..Very good recipe though!!

These potatoes were great. We used Michigan white potatoes and left the skin on. We also subbed French onion dip for the sour cream and added diced onions, green peppers and real bacon bits. Finally, we baked it uncovered to get it a little crispier on the top.

Great flavors. A little different than the normal mashed potatoes. I didn't have chives but that would have made it taste even better. I added 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 1 and used white/yellow potatoes with skin on. Would be wonderful with red potatoes or russets as well.

Great potato recipe!  Adding paprika and cooking the mashed potatoes in the oven added more flavor, if that was possible, to this delicious potato recipe.  Adding green onions or bacon bits might add more flavor but the ingredients for this dish are fine as they are.

A couple of my potatoes were about medium sized, so I cut the sour cream to 1/4 c. I also used the chive and onion cream cheese, rather than the chopped chives. I added cheddar cheese and real bacon bits to the mix and also sprinkled a little cheese on top. It may have been something I did, but the consistency was a little too runny. The taste was awesome though!! I will definitely make again!

I used these for my shepherds pie and they were fantastic! I used another persons suggestion to use the chive cream cheese and it was great!

I really found these pretty dry and bland--not sure what they are missing. I may try the substitution of the onion dip for the sour cream if I make it again and add some cheddar cheese.

I made this recpie to the tee.  It is an awsome variation of mashed potatoes.  Light and fluffy with a hint of sour cream and onion.

really, really good; however, I don't foresee us being able to use this recipe often, but when we have a meal that the flavor would pair well with, these will be the potatoes we serve with it.

Pretty good. I followed it exactly and was very surprised with the taste. All I can really say is that it is different. With my portion I added extra butter. My husband added salt. I think cheese added to it would be typical, so for the most part it was good as a base.

Delicious! Great recipe to serve for company since it can be prepared ahead of time and then baked. I used baked instead of boiled potatoes and added cheese and garlic powder. I mixed all the ingredients together before adding to the potatoes. Potatoes were topped with grated cheese and bacon pieces, added the last few minutes of baking time.

This was a great recipe! I loved it! I added a teaspoon of steak sauce to add a little hint of flavor. I got that from another recipe and it turned out great.

Just about perfect as is -- not at all bland. I added a dash of garlic powder but otherwise followed the recipe as is. It was so good my husband went back for another heaping helping! Used store bought already prepared mashed potatos since I had them on hand (1 pkg of Bob Evans brand), and it saved a bunch of time and dirty pans..!

After reading the reviews I was concerned this would be a bit bland so we added a large clove of garlic, half a cup of cheddar/monterey shredded cheese & some crumbled leftover bacon. Delicious!

Made these for Christmas dinner, and got raves all around (even from those not overly fond of sour cream). This recipe is a definite keeper! YUMMMM!!!

Excellent.  I served with Rib Roast and was the perfect compliment.  I did use green onion tops chopped and baked with a layer of shredded cheese on top.  Could not have been better.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe, I didn't really make any changes with the exception of adding a bit more salt. The potatoes were very creamy and very very delicious! I will be making this again soon!
