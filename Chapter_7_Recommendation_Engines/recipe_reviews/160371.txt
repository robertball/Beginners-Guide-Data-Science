Outstanding, refreshing and uniquely flavored cookie, unlike anything I've ever had before.  You can taste both the lime and the nutmeg (a spice I generally don't care for) yet the two combine and blend to create a delicious flavor all its own.  Be careful not to overbake these - -you don't want them brown around the edges. Once the cookies have set and are just beginning to turn color along the edge they're done! Any longer than that and you'd more than likely end up with an overly crunchy cookie. Beautiful cookie too, all light and sparkly with its sugar/nutmeg finish. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed something so different so much.  I will make them again for sure, and I won't change a thing!

OMG!  What a delicious little cookie- light, crispy, buttery, slightly spiced, and sweet with a nice touch of lime!  It's almost like a shortbread cookie, but not quite. I love the pairing of lime and nutmeg.  Who would have thought those two flavors would blend so well together in a cookie!  When it came to the spiced sugar mixture to dip the cookie into I used turbinado sugar vs. white sugar just to add a little extra crunch on top.  I'm so glad I stumbled upon this recipe. It's definitely different and something I'd be happy to make again.

I LOVE the flavor of these. The picture that was posted made the cookies look chewy - and they are not. They are a super-crisp butter cookie. When I make these again I'll add an egg and see if I can get a softer consistency. Thanks for the recipe!!

One of the most interesting cookies I've ever tasted. Starts out in your mouth like a regular butter cookie, but after a few seconds, the lime really cuts through. I read comments saying that they weren't chewy cookies, though, so I went ahead and added 1 egg yolk. It worked out beautifully. They're hard on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside.

Wow, these are great!!!  I don't usually try unrated recipes, but I love lime so I had to give these a whirl. They're like a cross between snicker doodles and lemon coolers.

My only caution is to make sure your pan cools between batches.  When I baked a batch on a hot pan the bottoms burned and got very crispy before the tops looked done.  Maybe they're a little delicate, but the recipe is simple and worth it!

These are SO GOOD. I made a few batches with the sugar coating on top, and then got lazy and made some without. Let me tell you, the sugar on top is what really made them go from good to fantastic.   PS I also fresh-grated my spices, and I also made sure not to leave any pith on the lime zest.

These are really tasty cookies.  I usually use my little zester that has five holes on the end to zest my lemons or limes, but for this one I used my microplaner.  That's the best way to get the lime distributed throughout the cookies.  This is kind of like snickerdoodle/butter cookie meets real flavor!  These are a very tasty change from the cookies I normally make!  Thanks, Valima!

Oh these are delicious.  It has too be my favorite cookie recipe so far.  I omitted the Lime zest (as I don't like it) and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I made 24 small cookies, not sure how this would possibly stretch to 48!  I did have at least 1/2 the sugar mixture left over (hate waste) so next time will certainly cut that by 1/2.  I ended up with perfect little cookies crunchy on the outside and soft in the centre.

Not only do these cookies smell AMAZING while baking, they taste even better!  The flavor combination of nutmeg, cinnamon, & lime is so provocative & makes for happy tastebuds!  A very easy recipe for such delicious cookies.  The lime zest puts these over the top!  This one is a keeper!  Thank you for this great recipe!

LOVED these cookies! Like another reviewer, I am not a huge fan of nutmeg. However, it was perfect in this recipe. I don't think it would have been right without it. Great with a cup of tea!

Being perfectly honest, I wasn't sure how the nutmeg and cinnamon were going to work with the lime.  But....it totally works!  These are terrific.  The best way I can describe them is like a snickerdoodle with a little lime flavor. It's nice how you get the kick of lime after chewing the cookie a bit.  The dough was a little dry and they weren't the prettiest of cookies, but what a nice change up from the usual cookie flavors that the family is so used to.

This cookie was good but not "wow!" When it first came out of the oven it was great, but after a few hours, the taste dulled a little.  I would suggest those who want a softer cookie to make the cookies a little bigger, but cook with the same time. Instead of making the amount the recipe called for, I only made 36, but the cookies were kind of soft. I rolled my cookies to a size a little larger than a walnut.

Supereasy to make and taste great. I cooked mine for 14 mins. Don't let edges get too dark if you don't like crunchy cookies.

These will make great holiday star cookies! The lime is a welcome relief from gingerbread men and plain sugar cookies. Also, love that they require no egg :-)

In my opinion, these are 5-stars! Fun flavor combination--I love lime, cinnamon, and nutmeg...never would've thought to add them together in a cookie...I was happy with the results! Others I shared them with didn't care for them as much, but they aren't as "adventurous" or "curious"-of an eater/baker as I am. If you're up for trying a uniquely fresh mix of flavors, this is a real treat! I didn't realize until I was baking them that they didn't even use any eggs... Interesting!

What a great alternative to the usual types of cookies we make!
I came upon this recipe while looking for something to use up the limes in my fridge. I love non-traditional ingredient pairings so I decided to try it out. 
The only change I had to make was because I didn't have butter so I had to use margarine but they still tasted fantastic. They turned out perfectly! They have a sweetness from being rolled in sugar but a tangy bite from the ginger and lime. I am DEFINITELY making these over and over again!
I served them to my extended family and they asked how I got them perfectly chewy but not too doughy. Others who commented noted that the cookies turned out hard so I took mine out early becaues cookies still bake inside for a little bit once you've taken them out of the oven. 
Don't hesitate to try this one!

Thought these cookies were great!  Made the house smell like Christmas.  After reading reviews about the crispness of these I added 1 egg yolk into the butter and sugar mixture and baked at a little less than 350 degrees for 13-15min.  Turned out nice and soft in the middle and the perfect firmness on the outside!

These were delicious. They are soft without being undercooked and have a nice lime tang.  My fiance didn't love them as much as I did because he thought they looked like sugar cookies and expected a super sweet taste when he bit into them, but if you are looking for something a little more interesting than your basic cookie, this is a great recipe.  I added a splash of milk when I was forming the ingredients into a ball because it was a little too dry, but other than that I didn't change anything.

Delicious and flavorful - the lime and nutmeg go very well together! I used pre-ground nutmeg and the flavor took a back seat to the citrus; if you want a really noticeable nutmeg taste, I recommend either increasing the amount or using freshly grated nutmeg.

One word of warning: don't expect these to be sugar cookies with a hint of lime. These are LIME COOKIES and although I loved the strong citrus flavor, my roommates were not so thrilled with it - I ended up eating most of them myself. (On the plus side, I can report that they keep well!)

Wow!  I usually don't bother with desserts that don't have any chocolate but I had a craving for something sweet and didn't have any eggs...these were perfect.  The surprising flavor combination of lime and nutmeg was sublime.  Buttery, sweet (due to that awesome sugar coating), and tangy all at the same time.  I'll definitely make these again.

These cookies were a great find. My husband is allergic to wheat, gluten, eggs, and diary. The only changes I made were using gluten free flour (same amount) and unsalted margarine. There were no eggs to worry about so this recipe is a keeper, so good and fresh tasting with the lime.

I like these, not too sweet and a little unexpected. I think I'll add a pinch more nutmeg next time. I don't think most kids would like these... or picky adults :o) but they are really good!

These cookies are perfection.  I didn't have problems with them being hard, as other reviewers started.  I'm thinking they just baked them too long?  They don't change color much so if you "burned" them they probably wouldn't turn brown, just hard.  When people asked what they were I just said "a kind of lime snickerdoodle"  and they were a huge hit.  The only change I made was to add about 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the mix.  Everything else was perfect and I can't wait to make them again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was excited to try these, but the end result wasn't that great.  As my husband said, these are, "Weird lime cookies," and I agree!  Basically, they're like a lime snickerdoodle (minus the cream of tartar).  Even the cookies I pulled out early ended up being hard and crunchy.  No one I served these to took seconds.  I was hoping for a refreshingly different cookie to add to my recipe box, but this one isn't it.

These are excellent cookies.  Extremely easy, and the longest part is letting the butter soften.  on the first batch, I watched these like a hawk to make sure 16  minutes wasn't too  much, and I'm glad I did.  16 minutes did work in my oven--I pulled them out just as the tops were starting to crinkle a bit and a very tiny bit of the edges were browning.  I ended up with a crisp cookie with a little bit of softness on the inside. And the lime flavor is perfect.  I wouldn't use as much sugar in the coating next time bc I had a lot leftover--my only complaint, and it's minor because I like these cookies a lot.  Otherwise, these are a wonderful little cookie that I'm glad I tried.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were GOOD! I don't tend to waste my time on cookies that lack chocolate, but I had extra limes on hand that I needed to use. I read other reviewer's posts, wherein they stated that the cookie was quite crumbly - I like mine chewy, so I added in an egg yolk and sifted the flour. Measuring out the lime juice and zest was more effort than I felt like putting forward, so I just used the zest and juice from 1 lime, poured them into my small Ninja, along with the cup of sugar, 3/4 cup of cold butter, and one egg yolk. I blended them for about a minute, until the zest was chopped into smaller pieces (I h-a-t-e chewing on rind), and the butter and sugar were creamed together. The dough was formed into 1in. balls, and rolled into 1/4c. sugar, 1/4 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon. I baked them at 350 fegress for 12 minutes. They seemed undercooked when I took them out, and were SUPER soft when still warm. After they completely cooled, they were kind of dry and crisp on the outer part and still chewy in the middle. Excellent cookies!

Wonderfully different cookie!  After reading the reviews stating that this is a very crisp cookie, I decided to take them out of the oven at 9 minutes. They turned out just perfect, crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I can't think of anything I would change!

Very good cookies! I added 1 egg to the batter for extra softness, and took them out of the oven at 10 minutes, then let them cool on the pan. Perfect soft cookies with a slight golden brown bottom. Used 1 tbsp of dough per cookie. Made half the amount of the sugar mixture, but would make all of it next time: it was just the right amount, but it's easier to roll them with more. These spread out a little but only to about twice the size of the dough ball.

These cookies are really tasty and different!  The lime definitely comes through, and the nutmeg melds nicely with the lime.  Do cook them until the edges are just beginning to brown - otherwise they're a little too soft.

These are absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for sharing. I made them exactly as the, very easy, recipe reads. So good. I did, however, only bake them for 10 minutes per batch, not the 13-16 as suggested. LOVE!

I've made these chookies several times now, and they are always amazing. People ask for the recipe - they are a wonderful surprise in flavor.  They do come out crisp, which I like.  Don't skimp on the lime zest - using a microplane is a must. Also, definitely use freshly ground cinnamon and nutmeg - it has much better flavor.

These cookies are delicious!!! I had a rare craving for something lime and these really hit the spot. I agree with another reviewer who said "I can't remember the last time I have enjoyed something so different so much". I was leary of the nutmeg-lime combo as I am not a huge nutmeg fan, but they worked together splendidly!! I made the recipe exactly as written, and its perfect. I use a mini ice cream scoop to keep my cookies consistent sizes, and I also like my cookies SOFT - so mine were cooked to perfection in 11-minutes (they wont look done, but they ARE!). Will definitley make these again through the Spring/Summer seasons!

Omg these things are addicting. I love them! Will be making this again and adding to my favorites pile. I took the other reviewers advise and added an egg yolk. I also did raw sugar(brown) on the outside of the cookies. De-lish! They turned out soft, little crisp on the outside, and they looked lovely.

These are the best for a sugar/butter type cookie EVER, without the lime and spices, just use milk (almond is nice).  We make these in the summer with lime or lemon and omit the spices , very good. My husband is a cookieaholic and i am a super picky baker, but when i take these anywhere, everybody raves. Butter and sugar the cookie sheet for an extra special touch...mmmm....
Also makes the best fruit pizza crust!!!!!

SO GOOD THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DOUBLE THE BATCH.  LOVE THE LIME PUNCH THAT THEY GIVE OFF.  The next time I make them I may try adding more lime.  Only complaint is that the recipe was rather difficult to follow but after making them once they are going to be so simple to make.

These are great!  They are simple yet refreshing, and easy to make.  They are my go-to when I don't have a lot of time but I want to make a cookie that I know people will love.  I have gotten a lot compliments on them!  In summertime I have served them with coconut sorbet - yum!  Sometimes I increase the lime juice and/or the spices a bit, but make no mistake you really don't have to change the recipe at all to get a delicious cookie!  Thanks!

Great easy recipe, doubled the amount of lime zest, added teaspoon of ground cardamom and used freshly grated nutmeg. A totally delicious tangy, spicy cookie that will be made again and again., especially as lime tree has just given up its crop to me!

My first ever success with baking cookies! As a British person not from the "cookie" tradition I've tried so many cookie recipes, which all turned out looking and tasting like flattened cup cakes ... Finally with this recipe I realised, if you don't want cake don't use eggs.  Simple once you know!  These cookies taste great, a lovely exotic lime flavour, but not overpowering.  I made them exactly as the recipe, the only thing I did find, was I halved the quantity (in case I made 48 disasters) and the reduced quantity only made 12, not 24 as I expected.  That's not a problem though - will just make another batch tomorrow.

Best & most unique cookie I have ever had...LOVED it!!!!  Made a half batch & added zest from one lime (wasn't sure if they're supposed to be packed) and all other ingredients as written when scaled to a half batch. We're a bit crumbly & hard to form, so I sprinkled a few drops of water with my fingers as needed to get the dough to hold together.  Phenomenal cookie & very addicting....definitely a keeper!

Okay I actually like the punch of lime in these cookies, I made the original recipe.  There is two things I would change to get more of the lime flavor and not so much spiciness.  First I would take the measurement for the cinnamon and nutmeg from 1/2 tsp to 1/4 tsp in the flour mixture and I would not roll it in the sugar mixture at all (just omit it if you like the lime flavor).  I also like the fact that I did not have to you an egg.  If you like more of a spicy recipe then use the lime.

This was a very very  good cookie!  I used orange instead of lime, because that was on hand.  I made sandwich cookies by glueing two rounds together with vanilla frosting.  YUM!

These are awesome! I make cookies frequently, and I'm tired of the same old flavours. So glad I tried these! The spices are subtle in these; I'd describe them as lime-flavoured sugar cookies. I added 2 egg yolks, due to other comments. I'll be making these again.

We really loved these, a grown-up cookie with a nice flavor.  I'm going to make some more today, but I'm going to double the lime zest, I think it needed a bit more of the citrus tang, since the nutmeg is so powerful.  Lovely recipe though, thank you for sharing!  :-)

I liked the idea of this cookie incorporating a unique blend of flavors, but it just didn't do it for me. It's a good recipe which I recommend especially if you like lemon cookies because the taste is so similar. My taste buds prefer chocolate which I probably should have stuck with! The cookie will crisp through and through even if it's undercooked.

These are like a lime snickerdoodle.  Very different & really good.  I used the small Pampered Chef cookie scoop & got 41 cookies.  I also baked them for less time because I like my cookies more chewy than crisp.  Great after a Mexican meal or in the summer.  The lime makes them refreshing.

These were nice and crispy!  Great recipe for people who are allergic to eggs.  My daughter had fun dipping them in the sugar and pressing it down with a fork.  We used a fork to press it down, like for a peanut butter cookie.  We had alot of spiced sugar mixture left over.

These were so easy and what a great fresh taste. I don't usually like crispy cookies but I would have these cookies any other way. My husband won't stop asking for them.

When I made these, I took them out of the oven just before they began to brown (between 12 and 13 minutes for my oven) so that they wouldn't be crunchy.  They were still fairly hard and chewy (moreso than I generally prefer), but the people I made them for really enjoyed them.

Loved these. A bit tart for my husband but that just leaves more for me. I definitely recommend grating  a fresh nutmeg. It’s an important component of the taste!

This was very tasty. At school I did a country report on Guyana and wanted to share Guyanese lime cookies with all of middle school, so I tried this recipe and its amazing! Even my dad liked it. The only thing that I would change would be adding a little more lime juice and something to make it softer. Other than that it was a great surprise.

Wow! These are awesome!
I accidentally misread the recipe and used 3 tblsp lime zest, but they're still delicious. I love the bright flavor of this cookie.
Next time: dial it back to 2 tablespoons of lime zest, and maybe a white chocolate drizzle for decoration. Otherwise perfect as written!

Excellent but you really need to double the recipe to get 28 cookies.  And do not flatten

This became my ultimate favorite cookies of all!  Although I like lemon cookies, I was not sure about this unique combination of lime and spices.  I am SOOOOO glad that I tried it and did not change a thing!  It smelled great and tasted absolutely AMAZING!  I will make this again and again.  Thanks much!

Dough tasted amazing, the end result not so much. I started off baking my cookies for 15 minutes and they were basically mush, sliding all over the baking sheet. I put them back in for another 3 after that. At no point did the edges begin to turn brown. When they first came out the texture was perfect but then turned rock hard once cooled. The lime flavor also seemed to disappear during the baking process. I may try again and add more zest and decrease the baking time.

started making this, then realised I did not have enough plain flour. Substituted with half almond meal. Then no baking powder...used baking soda in 1/3 measures to baking powder recipe....then no white sugar...used brown sugar...made the portions too big and they are saucer like...really yummy though!

These taste great.  I did have one problem, the dough was a little dry.  I made them exactly to the recipe, without deviation.  The dough was too dry.  I usually bake in batches of 5.  As I went along, the later batches got so dry I had to moisten my hands to get them to stay together.  Other than that, the cookies are delicious.

I enjoyed these, and they were easy enough to make.  They were ready to come out of the oven after 10 mins.  Somehow, they lacked excitement.  Perhaps making them a bit bigger, adding macadamia nuts or incorporating a sugar topping would help?

Deliciously different and.. have spunk! Don't cook for the full time if you don't want a little bit of a crunch (you want a more chewy cookie). They are thin and flavorful. The flavor is very good, not too much. My dad made the comment 'they aren't too much but the flavor is so full that one is probably perfect'. I did add more lime juice though, so that probably adds into it.  Only other thing is that I came out with leftover sugar mix, so if you're baking these, reduce the measurements. Thanks for the recipe, Valima!

Actually -- it's a 3-1/2 star rating, but I couldn't figure out how to do the half! The first tray of cookies were WAY TOO CRISPY, browned really fast, and were a bit greasy. Had to add another 1/4- to 1/2-cup of flour and ended up with a quite thin cookie, but still with a little chewy tooth. But the lime taste is fabulous and I think they'll go over great at the Wednesday afternoon lecture in September.

These were great! Simple and a refreshing taste. I had some thinner than others and those ones were a bit crispier but the others were kinda chewy. Both versions were great!
