I cut this recipe down to one serving--for my packed lunch for work today. I made the recipe as stated, only adding in more cumin and cilantro. I used leftover broiled chicken that I had in the fridge for this. Very good and fast to make. Next time, I might add some sliced red onion and maybe increase the spices just a touch more.

Very good salad. I mixed the dressing a few hours beforehand so that the flavors had time to mingle. (I probably added a little extra lime.) I prepared the chicken by rubbing it with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, and then sauteed it in a bit of the dressing. This salad had a very nice flavor, and the excess dressing tastes delicious sopped up with some fresh baked bread.

I wanted to find a recipe that mirrored my favorite salad at a local cafe. I followed the directions of the dressing perfectly, for the salad I added some pineapple and mandarin oranges but basically kept with the original recipe. I feel that the added fruit was the only thing that saved this dish, otherwise I would have been tasting nothing but olive oil. Less olive oil would do this dish a world of good!

YUMMO!!!!  I loved this!  Nice and light.  I only did something slightly different by letting a bit of the dressing hang out with the chicken before cooking it, then heated it up with some bell peppers and onions, made the salad part into my "Slaw"  with lettuce, onions cilantro, tomatoes and dressing, and wrapped that in a tortilla.  How wonderful!!!

I did not Like this salad at all!!  Way too much olive oil!  I was so excited about the recipe (I love salad and really love cilantro).  I am very disappointed!!  (not to mention of all the recipes I've tried on Allrecipes... this is the first review I've done which should count for something)

I've made this salad a lot.  I'm a huge fan of the dressing and have made it to have on hand (sans the cilantro)  This was a great summer dinner or lunch and was also nice to take to pot lucks.  A nice touch also is to add some feta cheese.

This is a light and refreshing salad, great for summer entertaining.  After mixing the dressing, I let it stand 1 hr. to let the flavors mingle.  I added chopped red onion and shredded cheddar cheese, and after preparing the chicken, I seasoned it with 1/2 tsp Cavender's Greek seasoning.  Next time I prepare this, I will add sliced avacado and substitute crumbled feta cheese for the cheddar.    I will be making this again soon!

This was really good. Next time I will double the dressing and marinate the chicken overnight in it.

This dressing was amazing. I changed the chicken to leftovers - I had made chicken with pinaples, so I used pinaples and apples instead of tomatoes, and it was AMAZING.  :)
