This is great chicken salad. It's simple, but with lots of flavor. I make it all the time when it's too hot to cook. I just bake the chicken or boil it in broth, then dice it up. I've made it with a variety of different nuts - pecans, walnuts - and low-fat mayonnaise. It always tastes wonderful! I highly suggest including the lemon juice, it adds a great subtle flavor.

Good basic.  I added fresh pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, a little dijon, and crushed pecans instead of almonds for a richer chicken salad.

Exactly what the name implies. Great and simple.  I didn't use the almonds because we didn't have any.  I did add just a little sprinkle of garlic powder and some sweet pickle relish....it was delicious.  Thanks for the post.

I love this recipe. So does my whole family. It is a great starter recipe. You can make it as is or you can add or take out the things you like or dislike. I love the slivered almonds in mine. I like to cut up some apples and grapes and serve them on the side. That way everyone can eat it the way they like it. I don't put celery in mine but I do add a finely chopped green onion and some sour cream to the mayo. I use half of the mayo and the other half sour cream. It is great!! Thanks for this recipe!! Will make again and again!!

This is a great basic recipe. It was a little bland until I added some extra spices like garlic powder and onion powder, but I guess that's why it's called "basic." This recipe calls for a LOT of almonds, but I love them in chicken salad, so I used them all!! Thanks for the recipe.

I don't always have the lemon juice on hand, so I omit it.  I also toast the almonds in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350 which gives them a lot more flavor.  We love onions so I also add a small minced onion to the mix.  Delish!

Delicious chicken salad!  I love the nice hint of lemon flavor.  I didn't have almonds on hand.  I used 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp. each of salt and pepper.  I added a little bit of dijon mustard and dried parsley.  I used Hellman's light mayo and let this set in the fridge for an hour before serving.

This is exactly what I remember growing up with as a child. Exactly how my mom made it. Delicious! With chicken salad, the simplest recipes are the best. Don't use FF mayo, use light if you absolutely must. Hellman's or Duke's mayo yields the best results. I love Miracle Whip but not in chicken salad. A delicious warm weather meal!

Quick and easy. I always have cooked chicken cut up and frozen just for this dish.  Will use it alot in the summer months. I also like to add a Tablespoon or so of sweet relish to it.

Great recipe 'idea'! thanks.
I used cashews instead of almonds. Cut out the celery. Added spring onion, pineapple pieces. Served on salad mix, topped with fresh grapes.
Simple 'dinner party' food!

Fantastic recipe for its reliable simplicity alone. Great as is, or embellished to your liking with various add-ins and seasonings.  As for me, I like my chicken salad with no add-ins other than the tiniest bit of minced onion and a little heavy cream to tame the tang of the mayo.  And celery of course!  Love the touch of lemon juice but can do without the almonds.  When your grown kids ask you how you make your chicken salad, you know you've got a winner on your hands!

I guess I just needed this recipe to start the instructions a little earlier.  Like, how do you get your chicken cooked perfectly, ready to chop?  Ok, here's what I do: Boil 3 or 4 (seasoned) chicken breasts in 2cups water (with 2 T.oil) about 8 minutes on a rolling boil, or until done.  Cool & dice fine.    Add I need more seasonings in my chicken salad:  I stir together the 1/2 cup mayo, 2 T. lemon juice, seasonings (1/2 t. pepper, 1/2 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. Old Bay, 1/2 t. Mrs. Dash) and 2-3 Tablespoons sweet pickle relish. (Yes! that's TABLESPOONS -- the big ones!)  Toss with chopped chicken, 2-3 ribs diced celery, 2 T. finely diced onion, & 3/4 cup slivered almonds.  Add addt'l salt & pepper to taste.  Chill 1hr.+ for flavors to meld.  Serve chilled.    Of course, this makes MORE than Jackie's recipe, but if I'm making something this good, I want enough to enjoy several (toasted) sandwiches, as well as nibble at it with crackers!   Yummy!

Delicious! I'm picky about chicken salad but loved this one. Used rotisserie chicken from Sam's Club and slivered toasted almonds (bought 'em that way from Trader Joe's). I threw all ingredients including a few addl spices (garlic and onion powder, a dash of seasoned salt) into the mini food processor. Blended nicely, it was great on toasted wheat bread with mixed salad greens! I used lite Miracle Whip to reduce calories - still fabulous!

It was the end of the month... no money for groceries.  So, I substituted shredded carrots for the celery, sunflower seeds for the almonds and added 1/4 cup chopped onion.  I served them open faced on toasted cheese bagels and the kids LOVED them!

Fantastic base!!  A dab of Dijon, sour cream, green onions, and some garlic gave it the customized "oompoh" just for us.  I used a salt & pepper rotissery chicken and low fat mayo/s.cream.  A wonderful low-carb meal/salad!  Great stuff!   Will use regularly!!

This is delicious!!!! Very good with canned chicken, makes a very tasty instant lunch. I added a dash of garlic powder & onion powder. I left out the almonds (don't care for them in chicken salad) and served this in a wheat tortilla wrap with grapes as a side item. VERY GOOD!

great recipe - you can substitute the almonds for walnuts if you want a nice earthy flavour - also adding a little curry power takes it to a while new level!

My husband is very picky when it comes to anything with chicken and he loved it!  Except he doesn't like raw celery, so I grated some raw carrots and it tasted great.  I also added a dash of garlic and onion powder like other posts  suggested.    Instead of 1/2 cup mayo I used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup greek yogurt.  Its a nice healthy substitute for a portion of the mayo.  This recipe was quick and easy and best of all its ingredients that you probably have in your fridge anyway.  Good for a tasty last minute dish!

So so good! Tastes like my momma used to make it. Put in a little garlic powder, a little more mayo and relish, and fewer almonds  (if my husband "knew" they were in there he wouldn't have eaten it - he didn't know and he loved it).

A basic recipe to tailor to your own taste. MUST have a quarter cup of minced onion.  I substitute chopped walnuts for the almonds and a pinch of tarragon is nice. Try a tbsp Dijon mustard; a half tsp white wine vinegar or half tsp white truffle oil.

This is a wonderful chicken salad! I usually use leftover rotisserie chicken which adds a little extra flavor and I substitute grapes instead of celery (I don't like celery). Have made this many times and my family loves it!

Great basic recipe! I cut boneless skinless chicken breasts into bite sized pieces, seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, and then baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  I also added some spicy mustard, grapes, and red onion to the mix. Thanks Jackie!

This is a decent chicken salad recipe and very basic indeed. I like the lemon juice idea, but I prefer a mixture of mayo and heavy whipping cream that I've tried from other recipes on AR. I would add some chopped onion or fruits (apples and grapes work well). It needs something more besides celery and almonds.

I have used this recipe for years. You can do so many variations.  I have added bacon bits, various herbs (tarragon is our favorite),grapes, and different types of nuts.  The lemon juice is a must!  It's so nice to have it at my finger tips on my favorite site now!

sooo good. The almonds are genius here.  TIP: always store your nuts in the fridge.

I have made this salad for years.  I use to have a sandwich shop and I had a hard time keeping enough made.  I roast my almonds in the oven until they have turned a toasty color and I used sour cream and mayonnaise. The almonds give a little crunch to the salad.  If I am serving this on a bed of lettuce, I like to add halved grapes (to taste).

I've modified by substituting reduced fat mayo, cashews instead of almonds, and doubling the celery. Makes for a very crunchy salad and everyone seems to love it.

Wow! The toasted almonds *really* add depth to the flavors in this salad, and the lemon seems to compliment the almond.  I can't wait to play around with the recipe to try to lighten it up (1/4 cup of mayo per serving is a little excessive). All in all, this one's a winner!

Basic is best!  I needed to make chicken salad for a party, and I didn't want to add too many unusual ingredients, not knowing the tastes of the many guests.  I don't make chicken salad for myself, and don't know how it's supposed to taste, so I wanted to start with a good basic recipe.  I've said in other reviews that I'm sure some cooks think it's silly that there are recipes on here for things that they just make from memory. To those of us who have never made them before and want to get it right on the first try, these recipes are a lifesaver. Thanks so much!

This is a great basic chicken salad recipe. I followed the directions exactly the first time but seasoned it to my liking the second time. I boiled a whole chicken in a stock pot with seasonings (rosemary, celery seeds, sea salt, black pepper, onion powder and garlic powder) until it was done but not overcooked. I pulled the meat from the bone and chopped it, adding chopped celery, mayo, black pepper and celery seed according to taste. This makes a very flavorful chicken salad!

Very good basic recipe, but I made a few changes to get the way I really like. Here are my changes: 1)I used 1/4 cup of light mayo and 1/4 cup of fat free plain yogurt. 2) I didn't have any almonds, so I used pecans instead. 3) I added chives and dijon. It turned out excellent.

If you eat this right after making it the lemon juice gives it some zing, but if you eat it the next day, I would add some garlic salt.  The taste dulls somewhat after sitting.  Very good.

I love this recipe!  What a great way to use leftover chicken!  I wanted a "basic" chicken salad recipe (my husband and I are not great fans of grapes in chicken salad) so I was looking for something a little different and I found it!  This is now part of my recipe box and will be a staple in my kitchen during the summer!  -- After making this a few times, we have found that no matter what type of chicken we use (grilled, baked, etc), we always need to add some additional dill and celery salt.  It really seems to make a difference.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Made this salad last night to take to work for lunch today.  I did toast the almonds to give them some crunch and more flavor and also chopped them up a bit.  Excellent salad - great on whole grain bread!  Thank you for this recipe - this will be the only chicken salad I make from now on.

Love this recipe!  I use canned chicken and add a little shredded cheese, and probably use less mayo than recipe calls for.  It needs to chill for several hours for flavors to mix.  I like mine on a flour tortilla as a wrap.  Perfect for lunch at work!

This was the best chicken salad I have ever had!  It was such a hit when I made it!  I did add some seasoned salt but other than that, I will not be buying canned chicken again.  This is a recipe that needs to be on hand at all times!

I Just used chicken, salad, mayo & lemon & it was delicious!!

From start to finish it took me less than 10 mins. I seasoned my chicken and grilled it on my little hamilton beach grill and mixed everything up when done & YUMMY!!

Put it in a pita bread & enjoyed a light dinner.

I had to make finger sandwiches for a crowd was looking for a good chicken salad recipe to put into small croissants and found this one. I used canned chicken breast and added green onions. Couldn't have been easier to make and people were telling me it was delicious.

Try pineapple juice instead of lemon juice. The mayo and sour cream is good too.

Great base, my great aunt Esther started her chicken saled like this, but added halved red grapes, a couple hard boiled eggs, and about two teaspoons curry powder.  The curry adds a wonderful flavor.

This is good!  I make it with rotisserie chicken.  It's really flavorful and a great way to use up any leftover rotisserie chicken!  It's pretty basic and works well with many variations such as waldorf chicken salad with apples, grapes and walnuts.

I made this exactly as stated and it was a good...I used left over chicken and fresh lemon. I also used a frying pan for the almonds instead of toasting them in the oven which was A LOT easier as I HAD to pay attention to them instead of popping them in the oven and walking away only to have them burn. Next time, I'll add fruit and give it a try, but I don't put stock in reviews of recipes that people ALTER. Seems pointless.

So glad I found this recipe. I've tried making chicken salad before and the flavors just never seemed to be right. I had to use what I had at home, so I used leftover rotisserie chicken, added some onion powder and celery salt and in place of celery and almonds, I used craisins and peanut/pecan nut topping (the kind you use for ice cream sundaes). It tasted great!

Great recipe!  Good meal for warm weather.  We ate this on croissants.  I think it would be good with raisins or grapes too, something to give it a little sweetness.

Very good but nothing special.  To make it quick I add shell pasta and use Perdue's Short Cut chicken in whichever flavor I'm in the mood for.  For a special chicken salad recipe (sweet flavored dressing), go on this website and look up Chicken Cashew Salad.

This is a good basic chicken salad recipe.  It's very tasty even without modifications.  I did add a little chopped red onion for a little kick.  And the finer chopped the ingredients, the better.

Very quick, easy and good! I had sliced almonds so used those in place of slivered. I also added some chopped green onion and since I had some kohlrabi from my CSA farmer I used that in place of the celery for the crunch. Excellent recipe!

What a great, easy recipe! I had some rotisserie chicken left over from another meal, so I had just the right amount for the salad. It went together in a flash (I didn't bother to toast the almonds), and it is SO GOOD!!

Simple and delicious! I used the diced chicken breast from a store-bought rotisserie chicken (almost exactly 2 cups) and omitted the almonds because I didn't have any on hand.

You just can't beat chicken salad. I love the basic but also sometimes add, grapes, drained mandarin oranges cut up, a little pineapple drained well, pecans instead of almonds, and also I always add at least one hard boiled egg.  We eat this on crackers, chips, grilled italian bread, and just a fork full sometimes fills the bill.

Exactly what I needed when our air went out all of a sudden and I dreaded turning on the oven.  I obviously had to use what was on hand, so I subbed in cashews instead of almonds and relish instead of celery.  I also added a dash of garlic powder.  Wonderful!

This recipe lived up to it’s "basic" name. It was indeed very basic. I tried to rate it on its own merit because if you have to add several ingredients it then becomes another receipe. I will not make it again and will search for a tastier chicken salad receipe.

Very good.. it seemed like it was missing a little something though. I tried it a second time with sliced grapes, walnuts instead of almonds, and a sprinkle of some spinach/dill dip mix. It was fantastic!

Good recipe to add to. I leave out almonds and celery, add paprika and garlic.  Great use for leftover chicken breasts no matter the seasoning of the chicken.  Have used with grilled chicken and BBQ chicken works great!!

Wowza! I worked at a little cafe through college that had the BEST chicken salad. This is the closet I've come to it. The lemon juice is the kicker. It gives it this tangy, suprising taste. I loved this recipe. I will make it again and again. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! I ended up adding a little too much lemon, but I'm a lemon fan, so all the better! I've been looking for a good chicken salad recipe for awhile, and I'm glad I found this one. It's really light and refreshing tasting. Perfect for picnics or parties.

I used Tyson's frozen Grilled and Ready Chicken Breast Strips. Added 1/4 tsp salt and two green onions chopped, cut the almonds by half (but otherwise changed nothing) and served on warm toasted bread......Fabulous! Best I've ever had! Thanks for the basic recipe and to those who added comments!

I normally just make chicken salad to taste, but decided to follow a recipe to see if there was any difference. Before I started I thought I had all of the ingredients, but then realized it called for slivered almonds instead of sliced. So, I decided to just leave them out. I followed the rest of the ingredients but I used lite mayonnaise and just a pinch of pepper. I thought the amount of celery or the added lemon would transform the chicken salad into something different then what I normally throw together, when busy, but it doesn't. It is what the recipe says a "basic chicken salad."

Yum!!! Light and Fresh! I loved the crunch of the almonds and celery! Next time I may add just a little lemon zest to brighten it slightly and see how it turns out.  So good! Thanks for the recipe!

Love the basics!  I have to leave the nuts out because of health conditions.  I added chopped cilantro for a bit of a zip.

Served it on  AR's Homemade Flour Tortillas recipe with some lettuce and sliced tomatoes.  I cooked the chicken in a slow cooker for a couple hours in the morning with some fresh garlic, onion powder and parsley.  When it was done I shredded it.  Also added pickles.  My family thought it was a very gourmet lunch :) that would be served at an expensive restaurant.

I really liked this; I was a little surprised -- esp. since I generally don't like nuts in my food.  But I mashed the almonds to tiny bits, and that really helped.  I also substituted purple onion for the celery (but didn't measure it). I especially loved the tang of the lemon juice. Good stuff! (PS-You can definitely get more than 2 sandwiches out of this.)

What a wonderful chicken salad "base". I add about the same amount of chopped apple as I do celery. I substitute pecans for the almonds because pecans are just better! I also add just a little stone ground mustard, garlic powder, and onion powder. This is so yummy...perfect for the summer.

I made this recipe with canned white meat chicken and substituted dried cranberries for the celery and it was awesome! Since I only had a 5 oz can of chicken, scaled the recipe down to 1/4 of original..

I thought this was a really tasty chicken salad. I did add some chopped sweet onion, because I like onion in chicken salad. Also, I chopped my chicken and veggies really fine, because I like a smoother texture, but kept the almonds in the regular size pieces. This added great texture to the salad. Great recipe!

Great recipe!  few changes...1) I used a handful of chopped pecans.  2) I used half of a crisp apple chopped as well as chopped celery and purple onion 3) I also sprinkled in some tarragon for a little zip!  came out awesome!  I make this at night and let it chill and make sandwiches the next day for lunch or for road trips.  it's so easy and delicious!

Delicious! My first stab at chicken salad. I burnt the almonds, so I threw them out and used walnuts. It came out great. Definitely use the lemon juice. It gives it a good kick.

This was a perfect afternooon lunch for us.  I used some leftovver chicken i had and WOW.  I didn't put in the almonds cuz of my little ones but my mom was a huge fan.  I think you can add any of your own preferences to this salad the celery slat and dill made a huge differnce. Yep another keeper!  Thanks!

This was a hit here. I didn't have almonds. Hellman's light mayo for this and I used lemon pepper since I was out of lemon juice. I did add more freshly ground pepper. My husband raved. Thankfully I made enough for the week so there is plenty of leftovers. This is simple and delicious! Thanks Jackie.

I seasoned the chicken breasts with black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and a little cayenne pepper. I added a tsp of relish, capers and a pinch of pink Himalayan salt to the chicken salad. I added some diced red onion to the second batch I made. If you like a strong onion flavour will like it this way. If not, omit it. So delicious and perfect for making chicken salad wraps. Great recipe.

I've been looking for a good chicken salad forever. Though this was safe and nothing objectionable about it, it wasn't what I was looking for. It needs a little something. I added some dried cranberries to it and that helped a bit. I'll probably use it as a basic recipe and just do some add-ins.

Great recipe! To make it a little more flavorful, I added a few dashes of tabasco sauce and 2 tablespoons of finely chopped red onion. I also added some salt to enhance the flavor. It turned out pretty great! You can also add some buffalo sauce to turn it into buffalo chicken salad. Yum. I love to eat it with wheat bun or wrap it in lettuce ;)

Great simple recipe.  I added walnuts instead of almonds and a half chopped apple...think it was a Fuji.  Will make this again!  Thank you.

I made this tonight and it was pretty good. Made a few changes. I used leftover lemon pepper rotisserie chicken from walmart. Not quite a full tbsp of lemon juice because it was already lemony. No almonds but I did put in cut up pieces of half an avocado. Served on fresh baked rolls.

Great jumping off point, as others have stated, but is good even without tweaking. The lemon and the freshly ground pepper are standouts. This time I added a small chopped apple; and for the dressing  some dijon mustard (1/2 tsp.), 1/2 of a drive-thru honey mustard bbq pkt. we had on hand, 1/8 tsp. garlic powder, pinch of onion powder, along with the lemon juice and pepper. Served over a bed of spinach and garnished with dried cranberries, almond slivers, bacons bits.

Would you believe...this is the first time I've ever made chicken salad??? I picked this recipe because of its simplicity and my family absolutely loved it! Extremely easy to make- the hardest part was chopping the celery :)

This recipe is so easy and simple.  It's probably one of the best chicken salad recipes I've ever had.  I've made it exactly as written and I also added apples.  I've use left over jerk chicken which gave it a kick.  I've used breast meat and thighs.  It's a very forgiving chicken salad.  You really can't go wrong.  I even make it with fat free mayo and its still delicious.  Yummy.

I've made this a few times and it's become my go-to chicken salad recipe.  You can't mess it up and it's addictive.  The flavor's best the next day, so make it ahead if you can... but it's good no matter what!

This is a great base for chicken salad. As is, it was a bit bland for me, thus the four stars. I added more black pepper, diced onion and some celery salt. Afterwards it was five stars! Served on top of sliced radishes for a low carb late night snack.

This was very good-added dill weed too. My opinion, you can not use thighs for ckn salad. They are too greasy, even without skin. The mayo will not adhere to ckn.

I had some leftover slow cooker chicken from the recipe here on AllRecipes.com.  I used about 3 cups of that chicken (mostly breast) chopped.  I also used Miracle Whip instead of mayo (just personal preference), about 3/4 cup.  My almonds burned, so I left those out.  I used a pre-chopped combination of celery and onions from the grocery store (to taste--about 2 tablespoons), and juice from one fresh lemon (should have used two).  It seemed to need a lot of salt, pepper and the garlic powder that I added to give it flavor.  It is totally yummy and very easy to make.  I need easy go-to higher protein recipes, and I will definitely add this one.  Try it, you will love it!

Made this for a luncheon we were having at church, everyone loved it.  The only change I made was I added some green grapes cut in half at my husbands request.  The grapes added a little extra flavor and a texture but I thought it was great either way.

This was a GREAT simple and easy recipe. I went according to the recipe EXPECT, I'm not an almond person with chicken and I was out of celery. I instead added cilantro (not too much because cilantro can be overpowering) thinly sliced some tomatoes and salted them. Toasted the bread and added the chicken salad mixture. It was soooooo good!!! Thanks for this recipe saving this to my box!!

This was okay. I guess Im not sure what I was expecting from it but it was quite bland. I ended up adding some grapes after tasting the final product to it to add some taste. Overall I think I will try a new recipe next time.

I'm not much of a cook, but once in a while I like to make something for myself. This was a nice and simple recipe to follow, and you can personalize it as you like. It's a great way to stock up on sandwich material for the week when you're a busy student like I am.

Great recipe, I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, pepper, and seasoning salt before sauteing. I also added a bit of onion to the salad. It was delicious on ciabatta bread. I'd never even had chicken salad before.

I used three really big leftover fried chicken thighs, skin and all. I added a little granulated garlic, a few baby pickles, chopped and green onion. My son and I ate the lot. GOOD stuff. I think the fried chicken was what made it so tasty. NOTE: My fried chicken was Tanya's Louisiana Southern Fried Chicken.

I like this recipe!  It was nice and simple!  I took three chicken breasts and seasoned them with salt, pepper, and garlic and cooked them at 375 for about 35 minutes.  I used that for the recipe.  I didn't use almonds but I did add about 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese and about a tablespoon of relish.  I ated it on whole grain sandwich thins.  Delicious!

This was a simple, yet very flavorful recipe that I really enjoyed.  I used a package of vegetarian "chicken" strips, which I chopped into chunks, in place of the regular chicken.  I also used a light mayo, and it turned out great.

Used fat-free mayo to reduce fat and calories.  Great taste and such a cinch to make!  Much cheaper than buying chicken salad from the grocery deli and just as tasty!

This was a simple "basic" recipe. I tasted it and knew my family would like it too. Thanks, Jackie for sharing it.  When I was ready to "up the ante" I added 1/4 c. sweet pickle relish, 3 finely minced boiled eggs, and 2 T. salad dressing. Also, I didn't have the pre-cut blanched almonds, so I diced natural almonds and toasted them in a pan (with EVOO on the bottom). It was SO good! P. S. A friend of mine had a deli. On his chicken salad sandwiches he added a thin slice of tomato and Iceburg lettuce and toasted the bread. This too is delicious!

Great basic recipe.  Love the toasted almond flavor.  Added 1/4 cup apple for a nice sweet crunch.  Could probably use a little less mayo if desired.

This recipe is a good foundation.  If you want to add dill pickles, but don't have pickles in your refrigerator, use fresh dill from the store.  I also added some garlic powder.  Since I didn't have celery, I substituted using 1/2 of a green bell pepper.  Of course a red bell pepper would be fine too.  To give the recipe some zip, I chopped up some scallions and added them to the mix.  White onions would also work well.  I also added some chopped walnuts.  Finally, I didn't have lemon juice on hand, so I substituted this ingredient with lemon pepper.  My wife loved it!  What a great way to use up the remaining store bought rotisserie chicken.

Yum! This is an excellent chicken salad. I did add some green grapes to mine, and I think dried cranberries would also be excellent in this.

A great basic recipe.  I omitted the almonds, added onion and sweet relish and onion and garlic powder. SO I basically added a bunch of stuff but it was so yummy!

Easy and quick! I wanted a quick lunch, but had not much in my fridge, so found this recipe for the basic chicken salad and made it mine! Just added 1/2 apple, some garlic powder, paprika powder, ground caraway and mustard seed. And of course fresh parsley, cilantro and green onion. So much about basic.. :)) Well it turned out great!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe and it was so simple.  I used some left over chicken and it was great.  I did add garlic powder, and green onions.  The celery makes it a little crunchy which we like.  It is a standard of mine as a summer salad or with soup in the winter time.

Ok.  I have made this recipe several times and it is just right.  It is the great base for whatever you like to add to chicken salad.  I have to add my one (but very important to me) change.  It makes a world of difference when you use a deli rotisserie chicken instead of a cooked chicken breast.  It is very worth it and most grocery stores offer them on sale and cold the day after they are roasted.  Happy Cooking!

Really good basic ingredients. I used leftover turkey, and added to the recipe: a dash of garlic & onion powder, fresh ground pepper and some dried cranberries. I also used Hellmans Canola Mayonaise which cuts down the calories and is a very good option.

Very good basic recipe! I followed others' advice and added garlic powder, a little extra black pepper, green onions, and some dijon. I also added just barely a teaspoon of sugar, I think the mayo I was using was a little too vinegary or something. Anyway, it came out really really good. Will definitely use this again.

Great beginner salad.  This has been one of my fav's for some time. I add curry to the mayo as well as some tsasiki sauce (it replaces lemon for tartness).  In summer I add seedless green grapes, fresh pineapple, apple, celery and always almonds slices.  In winter I replace grapes with seedless raisins, cranberries, mini marshmallows,and use canned pineapple.  I brown the almonds for extra flavor and still add curry to the sauce, but add a pinch of salt and a hint of sugar.

Very good basic recipe. I toasted the almonds and added a little salt, garlic salt  and pineapple tidbits. My girls couldn't get enough. We put it on sandwiches but think this would also be good served on a bed of lettuce.

This was a good basic recipe. It really needed some salt though. I added it to taste and added some cut grapes. I deleted the almonds because I made this for a church luncheon and didn't want to deal with nut allergies. Very good.

This is a quick & tasty chicken salad. I buy almond slices or slivers and use them as is, as I don't think toasting them adds much with all the other flavors in the mix. I often add other veggies for variety, but the recipe is good in its basic form, too.

This chicken salad was wonderful.  It's a perfect place to start.  I added some red onion, crasins, and fresh dill weed.  I served it for my sons 2nd birthday party and it was a hit!!  Eight of the nine kids gobbled it up!!  I loved the lemon juice in it, thought it gave it a great tangyness.

This was very delicious. It does lose it's taste after a few days, so i would reccomend adding some garlic powder. Also, chop the clery VERY fine. Same with the roasted almonds. I broke them up before adding them to the salad. Overall, super delicous. Makes a fair amount.

Great basic recipe!  My first time making chicken salad and everyone gave it rave reviews!  Didn't change much, but did add some garlic powder, minced onions and plenty of salt and pepper!  Made it for mother's day lunch and it was wonderful!  Plenty leftover for lunches this week too!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really liked this recipe. It's really simple and easy to prepare. I added some green onion that gave it a little kick.  If I had some I would have added red onion also.

Great base recipe. I ended up adding more mayo but that's just a preference of mine. I also added diced avocado, garlic powder, eggs and salt.

Wonderful! Simple! Great way to use left over rotisserie chicken from Costco.  Works well with canned chicken too. The only thing I added was a little green onion. Worked great with or without nuts.  This is a keeper!

Made this in quantity for a catering job.  Served it on ciabatta rolls. Everyone loved it, and many said it was the best chicken salad they'd ever had.

Love this recipe as a basic that you can do magical things to enhance for the season.  I start with a roasted chicken from the store, chop it up, add ingredients and then toss in what I have on hand, or what I want to feature for the season. Today I cut up fresh peaches and sliced almonds.  The lemon is important.  I also reduce the may to 1/3 cup, and it is plenty!  Make this weekly.

I was looking for a simple recipe and this was it. I cut chicken breasts into small cubes and seasoned with S&P, garlic powder and onion powder. I then baked for about 20-25 minutes on 400 on a baking sheet. I let the chicken cool and added the mayo, lemon juice, a little more S&P, some small diced onion and celery. My family doesn't like nuts in chicken salad so I left out. I put on toasted bread with some lettuce, tomato and sliced pickle. It was great.

This has been my basic recipe for years .  Usually use pecans and add craisins.  When I'm feeling really adventurous I add curry powder.  This is a great jumping off point.  Don't omit the lemon; it really brightens it up.  Serving tonight at my *Friendsmas* dinner.

Thank you Jackie!  It's perfect as is.  I had forgotten how great tasting chicken salad is. Made it last night and like so many salads, it's even better today, 
Followed directions, exactly. I was temped to add salt, but just added at the table. Delicious. I read all the reviews and everyone "fancying"'it up. Does not need any of that. The only review I took advice was to toast the almonds. I generally prefer nuts that are toasted, so I went with that. I think it would be delicious with them not toasted too. I would not change a thing!!!!
When I finish this, I am going to make it again. Maybe I will share next time. :) Maybe!
Update... I have made this 4 times! It's incredibly good. I recommend doubling it. You will want more. :) It is great as written, I would not change a thing. 
Again, thank you for sharing this chicken salad recipe. It's great!
Update, update. I made it again! This chicken salad is deliciously addicting! The last two times I made it I bought 2 of the pre-cooked rotisserie chickens sold at grocery stores. We have dinner (usually serve the legs) and the remaining chicken I remove the skin, refrigerate and easily cut enough chicken to double this recipe. Still followed the recipe, no changes. Why mess with perfection? I'm on this sight like it's my job; always trying new recipes. This might be my absolute favorite. 
Thank you SO much far sharing this,

This is my base recipe, and it's fabulous!  I've tweaked it a little over time, but it's very good on it's own.  I usually end up making a quadruple batch because it's so popular.  I also add pecan chips, celery, and grapes for the crunch, and tarragon, and it's everyone's favorite!

I made this with miracle whip light, and on top of the basic recipe I added a little bit of garlic powder, onion powder, less than 1/2 tsp dijon, tbsp dill relish, and used leftover grilled chicken breast. Yum! I love the toasted almonds in it.

Simple yet amazing chicken salad recipe. Use lemon juice from a lemon, not that faux stuff. I used meat from a rotisserie chicken and original oven roasted almond slices by Wonderful. Also added a dash of Mrs. Dash (garlic and herb).

Starting with this basic recipe, I added a few grilled celery stalks and onions, walnuts instead of almonds, and added some garlic and onion pre-mixed spice from Aldi...AND IT WAS FRICKEN AMAZING!  I've never made chicken salad before, actually never liked it, but needed to get rid of some chicken and the kids asked for chicken salad.  This will definitely be one of our family's faves from this point forward.

This really is a great basic recipe.  I've made it about a dozen times now.  My only complaint is the lemon juice... While I don't contest that it is a necessary ingredient, I find 1 Tbsp to be just a bit too much.  I've found it best with 2 to 2.5 tsp.  I no longer toast the almonds - I like it just as much with raw almonds.  I've tried it with walnuts and with pecans instead of the almonds and even used whole unblanched almonds thrown in the food processor for a few seconds.  All were good.  I've successfully substituted up to 1/3 of the chicken with chopped hard boiled egg with no negative effects.  And like others have mentioned, I have found a bit of garlic powder (and sometimes paprika too) to be nice additions, when I remember them.

Way too many almonds.  It would be much better with maybe only 2 or 3 tablespoons.  Other than that is is a good simple recipe.

I have used this recipe several times.  Eventually modifying it to meet my family's taste.  I start with poached chicken, this allows for a moister meat, and the use of less mayonnaise (actually I add 1/2 cup of chicken, and use the original mayo specificiation.  We've also found it too lemony and have eliminated that.  If you don't have can't find slivered almond, pecans or walnuts (not toasted, but crushed a bit) are a good substitute.  Craisins and dill (fresh is better) add a lot to this recipe.

BASIC is JUST what I was looking for. So often I find fun new recipes to try that are a spinoff of a classic...but I decided to stick to the basics here. Using flavorful chicken probably didn't hurt (used homemade roasted chicken). Unfortunately I didn't have almonds, so we chose to use pecans which is fine. I did think it was missing a touch of salt, so I added that but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It doesn't need garlic, dijon, onion, bacon, etc... it's excellent as written.

Perfect!  Easy, crunchy, wholesome!  I didn't have lemon juice on hand, so I made it without and it was still delicious.  Can't wait to try it again with the lemon.

Every weekend, I prepare my husband meals for the week. So this weekend, I decided to incorporate this recipe. The only thing I didn't do was add the nuts. I must say its one of the best that I have add in a long time and my husband loves it too. Thanks again for sharing. This will be added to my recipe book.

This is a good, basic chicken salad.  I made this as written, but I didn’t have lemon juice, so I subbed the same amount of cider vinegar with good results.  I toasted the almonds (350 degrees for 8-10 minute, until fragrant and lightly golden).  I liked the almonds, but I may try toasted pecans next time.

My tummy is in love! I poached the chicken breast first -- seasoned with garlic salt, pepper, sea salt, & chicken seasoning -- then chopped it up when done. I mixed in all the ingredients as the recipe instructed. I also chopped up green onions and added it to my mixture. To compliment this delicious chicken salad I spread cranberry sauce on the lightly toasted bread. My tummy and taste buds are beyond satisfied!

I made this recipe with 1/4 cup reduced fat mayonnaise and 1/4 cup low fat sour cream. I grilled the almonds in the oven, keeping a close watch on them (a few minutes on a high temp) and  replaced the lemon juice with two finely chopped spring onions. I served this with fresh green batavia leaves. Delicious and healthy.

This chicken salad was good, but did not taste like chicken salad that I was brought up on. I'm used to it being a lot creamier than this recipe. I would add more mayo. Other than that, great recipe.

great basic recipe. I did omit the celery (i am not a celery fan), almonds and forgot the lemon juice. I added garlic powder, onion powder, chopped onions, minced cilantro, minced hot yellow peppers & crushed red pepper. YUMMY! Thanks for pointing me in the right direction=)

Just made this with left-over rotisserie chicken.  I loved it!  I didn't have slivered almonds so I roughly chopped some whole almonds.  I didn't measure the pepper, just ground away with the grinder over the salad. I also added just a touch of sea salt.  Even my teenage son liked it, and I really didn't expect him to, he's never liked any kind of chicken salad before.  We had it on whole grain buns with lettuce leaves and some sliced tomato.  Added root beer and we were very satisfied with a nice light summer supper.  In retrospect, chips would have been perfect with this and vanilla pudding for dessert.  Maybe next time!

Yummy! I had some leftover chicken from dinner and wanted to make a chicken salad to take to work tomorrow. The chicken was still a bit warm, but the flavor was really great. Can't wait to eat it on a sandwich tomorrow!

Mmmm.  This so far is my favorite chicken salad recipe!  It is especially good the next day.  For dinner we ate it on ciabatta  rolls toasted in the oven.   I woke up craving it so I ate it on crackers for breakfast.  When my family saw what I was doing, they each wanted some too!

This is an excellent and easy recipe. I've always wondered what the "secret" ingredient of gourmet chicken salad is and I think this recipe made it clear...roasted almonds!! We all thought this was yummy with more lemon juice, salt and extra freshly ground black pepper. It's basic but delicious!! Next time I'll add diced onions and creole seasoning to add a little heat! Yummy to my tummy :o)

Someone brought over a rotisserie chicken from the market for potluck- used the leftovers and added wasabi coated almonds to it and a couple slices of crispy bacon. Added some zip and made super sandwiches even the kids loved!

I make this all the time, using canned chicken and whatever nuts I have handy--usually pecan/pine nut.  I'd never have thought a chicken salad could taste so perfect without onions, but this does.  Great for a quick dinner using pantry staples.

Great basic recipe.  Instead of almonds, I just use pecan pieces which everyone likes much better and add red seedless grapes halved and pineapple cut into tiny pieces. Wonderful!

My family loved this recipe. I used walnuts, that's all I had on had. Didn't matter, great taste and a lot of crunch. Also used evo mayo, with the lemon juice and the celery you couldn't tell the difference

I use Miracle Whip instead of mayo, but other than that have been making chicken salad like this for years.  To make it a little fancier for company, try adding red seedless grapes, cut in half.  Delish and pretty!

Very good recipe. I'd increase the amount of chicken and stress the lemon juice amount stay at 1 TBSP. Refreshing!

Awesome basic chicken salad.  I omitted the nuts since we have a nut allergy in our home.  But never the less, it was delicious!  I say "was" because I devoured mine!

Good! It was a little more mayo than I would have liked, but it was tasty. I seasoned chicken breasts with thyme and baked to use in this. Nice and simple, just what I wanted. Thanks! :)

Great recipe.  I enjoyed it as is; next time I may add grapes and nuts, but I didn't have any this time.  I think the lemon juice makes a huge difference--don't leave it out.  Thanks!

Great basic recipe. I add a bit of onion and a bit more celery, a tad of mustard and some garlic powder. I ate it with the Amish White Bread (from this site) and the bit of sweetness in the bread tasted AMAZING with this recipe.

I used left over grilled chicken quarters. I did not have any almonds, so I used pistachios. I also added a teaspoon of chopped capers and 1/8 teaspoon of dry mustard. Two thumbs up!

This was a really good easy and delicious recipe. I added a little lemon zest and went a little easier on the mayo and added a bit of sour cream just because I wanted to cut down the calories.

This turned out very well.  We made it with "oregano chicken" since others suggested using baked chicken with herbs, thank you very much, it's "delicious!"  I also used pecans rather than almonds since that's what I had on hand, again, it worked out nicely.  This is a great basic recipe, thank you!

Really yummy! I also thought everyone's comments were great, too. I cheated and used canned chicken b/c I was in a hurry. Also I used celery salt b/c I didn't have celery. I used choppped pecans and added some golden raisins. I really enjoyed this one.

Great starter recipe. I had never made chicken salad before so this was a great help. I sauteed some finely chopped onions and zucchini with a little butter, EVOO and minced garlic and added some crushed cashews and it was awesome. I had it for lunch, and I can't wait for supper!

Fantastic! Even my 3 year old loved this recipe. I marinated chicken breasts in an "Island Teriyaki" marinade (store-bought) and grilled them- the sweetness of the teriyaki definitely added great flavor, but this recipe would be tasty with any type of chicken! The toasted almonds are the key. Thanks so much for sharing it.

This is a pretty good basic recipe. If you want to jazz it up though, add a little curry powder to it! Yummy!

I always use this recipe as a starting point for left over rotisserie chicken so none of it goes to waste. I’m sure it would be equally as good with any other chicken. I omit the almonds because hubby just doesn’t like them. Omitting them greatly reduces the time it takes to make this dish. I also add some chopped green grapes. Every single bit of it gets eaten in my house every single time! Thanks for sharing!

The basic recipe is very good!!!  I will make it again and play around.  I did not have lemon juice.  I added a little yellow mustard and that helped kick up the bright flavor.  It's great and will even be better with the lemon!  Thank you!!

This made a nice simple meal that used up some leftover chicken.  It needed some salt and celery seed IMHO, but otherwise it was tasty comfort food.

This a good recipe to use on that inexpensive chicken breast deals you find in the store.  I just boil up the breasts and put them into a food processor.  The family loves it as a snack or a before dinner appetizer.  I like to add a bit of hot spice to give a kick.

My favorite chicken salad recipe. Made as is except substituted sour cream for 1/2 of mayonnaise. Can also use Greek yogurt for 1/2 mayonnaise.  Have also added a little chopped onion at times.

This is an excellent recipe on its own or a base for adding some extra ingredients of your own taste. The toasted almonds and lemon juice are a must. Since discovering this recipe I keep a bag of slivered almonds in the cupboard. And I'll add red onion or any onion I have on hand and some seasoning of my own taste. Living alone I buy a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket have it for dinner and make chicken salad with the leftovers. Excellent recipe thank you very much.

Basic chicken salad -- great as is or use your imagination to gussy it up. I like to add chopped apples or grapes cut in half (green or red or a combo). The toasted almonds add a great taste and the perfect amount of crunch. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I would say this is a good recipe. I did follow recipe in a sense, I left out almonds because I’m it sure how almonds go well with chicken in my opinion. I did also add maybe half a diced onion.

Simple and easy to make on a hot summer evening. I added a diced mango and a few slices of cooked plantain that I had left from the night before...I think you could add any ripe fruit in your fridge or even from a can!

Excellent basic chicken salad. I added toasted walnuts, sliced grapes, minced onion, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, black pepper, seasoned salt, and combined FF Greek yogurt w/light mayo. Now it's the BEST chicken salad!  Hubby raved.

I found it a bit watery and need to figure out how to correct that.  We both liked it but will try a few changes: add a touch of dill, less mayo, more almonds and more celery, less grapes.

I thought this was a really good recipe. I pretty much followed it except I didn't add the lemon juice and I added a dash of rosemary. We like to eat ours with Hawaiian sweet slider buns and it was delicious!! I am definitely making it again during the hot summer months.

Made this recipe several times. Delicious every time but it was the best when I toasted the almonds in a pan for a few minutes. I like to bake my chicken with lemon pepper seasoning too.

It does say it is basic so I made several changes, I added garlic power and onion power like a previous poster suggested.  I also don't like mayo much so I cut that to 1/4c and used cream cheese and sour cream for the other 1/4c, it still came out dry so I added more mayo  and sour cream probably equaling another 1/4  cup.  I also used rotisserie chicken  which may have been why it needed more mayo.,and toasted pecans instead of almonds because that was what I had on hand.  Served it to some unexpected (but not uninvited) guests, when you say "stop by any time" you better be ready,  I sliced up hot dog buns and made sliders out of them and it was a huge hit.

This recipe is a really good base. I ended up adding basil as well because the dressing was a little bland. I also did not add almonds but used a granny Smith apple and green onion in addition to the chicken and celery. this would also be very good with dries cranberries or craizins or other dried fruit.

This is great!!!! Thank you so much for sharing. I’m a guy who hates the kitchen. Seriously. And because of my night shift life, I leave for work as my wife comes home. This is the perfect thing to bring to work. Two servings with healthy snacks is a perfect day of food. The first time I made it my 10 year old tasted it and stole it from me. So now when I make it I have to make extra. Thanks again.

I really liked the ease and simplicity of this recipe. I used Costco rotisserie chicken and added a few dried cherries and cranberries. The lemon juice added lots of flavor and cut down on the amount of mayonnaise (thus fat) needed.

kept the receipt the same except I didn't add the almonds this time, maybe next time.
I did add about 2 teaspoons of brown spicy mustard to give it the flavor and spice I wanted.

I used leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco for this recipe. I had to add a little extra mayo so the salad wasn't too dry. I also added a little garlic salt because my son said it was a little bland, but I thought it tasted like chicken salad should. I did use light mayo to mitigate the calories a little.

This is nice and easy, but it's too simple. I don't think it even suggests adding salt or pepper.  I made it into the best chicken salad I've ever had. Here's how:  

If you can, use left-over high quality chicken breast from grilled (apple-wood smoked, preferably)  chicken kabobs. This is easy if you've had kabobs with mushrooms, onions and bell peppers for an earlier dinner. Chop up the chicken into small cubes. Follow this recipe, but add cracked pepper, salt and dill. Don't be stingy with the dill unless it's fresh, which has more flavor.  Use ample lemon juice. 

Outrageously great!

I didn't make any changes or any additions to this recipe and it turned out great.  The toasted slivered almonds are a nice touch.  Chicken Salad doesn't get any more basic than this!

I made it and thought the basic recipe was pretty good, however a little bland.  I added some raisins and a little curry powder.   It does call the recipe "basic" which it is.  This recipe lends itself to most anyway you want to go with it.

This was delicious.  I did follow the advice of others and used garlic powder.  I added onions and fresh dill.  The lemon juice and the slivered almonds are a must in this recipe!

Love it, will make again.  I added red onion, bacon, dill pickle and olives.  Next time I will leave the olives out, just too much fighting against each other but other than that it was great.  May try a little jalapeno next time.  :)

This was a great recipe, I followed it exactly as written.  The only thing I will change next time is cutting down the amount of mayonnaise to about 2/3 C.  I added some sliced almonds to a second serving and that was also good.

I’ve used this recipe many times, always a hit. I didn’t have any celery so I used minced onion and chopped up green and yellow pepper.  Didn’t have any slivered almonds so I used roasted sunflower seeds.  I also love adding pickle relish.  Used Dijon mustard as well. Yummy!

Perfect solution for an at-home meal on a hot summer day when you want to avoid the oven! I shredded the breasts of a large rotisserie chicken which made about 4 cups, so I doubled the recipe. Once the chicken was doubled, I used the juice of a whole lemon from the garden and the celery and mayo. I held off on the almonds until tasting it but found I didn't need them. Change: I added a dash each of garlic powder and onion salt and served it paired it with crackers. A side salad made this a filling, ideal, no-cook meal. My husband and two teen sons LOVED it! Will definitely make again.

Great basic recipe.  I marinated boneless chicken breasts in a zip-lock bag with 1/3 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup of balsamic vinegar and some chopped garlic.  (marinate for a few hours or a day).  Cook them either on the grill or put in a small crockpot on low for a couple of hours ( don't overcook).  When cool, I shred the chicken.  To the real (!) mayo add 1/2 cup of sour cream, lots of fresh lemon juice, chopped parsley, onion and garlic powder, dried mustard, dash of cayenne, dash of kosher salt, and plenty of fresh-ground black pepper. Didn't have almonds, but added dried cranberries with the chopped celery.  Let it sit in the fridge   for  awhile. Hmmmmmm.  delish with  crackers.

I really loved what the toasted almonds did for this chicken salad! I made this basic recipe as an appetizer for a cookout by using it as a filling for miniature peppers. Delicious while waiting for the food to be grilled and ready.

I made it for the first time because my recipe is packed in a box right now. I didn't add the nuts but added green seedless grapes. My daughter-in-law suggested it while I was visiting and I loved it and have done it ever since.

I make this and really like the basic recipe. How ever I have played around with it. I use the recipe for "Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I" on this site instead of full mayonnaise and a sprinkle of paprika.

This is a fantastic and an easy recipe . I use a  rotisserie chicken. I add a few shakes of garlic salt and 1/4 cup of onions to it. I also add about 1 tablespoon of green onions. I don’t add the almonds to it. It comes out soooo good.

Great simple recipe.  I had some previously sous vide chicken breasts leftover.  I used 2 stalks of celery, some celery seed, a handful of dried cranberries.  Didn't have almonds so chopped up a few cashews.  Also added a splash of sesame oil.  Of course hubby had to add Tabasco.

I’ve made this numerous times, and here’s what I do. I brine boneless tenders for 24 hours; then I poach them in chicken broth. Allow them to cool and then assemble the salad. I leave out the almonds. Oh, and using lemon pepper gives it a little zing!

Good basic recipe.  I didn't have all the ingredients, like lemon and almonds, so I winged it with a little chopped apple along with the celery.  If you want to add a little mystery, try a very small pinch of allspice to make everyone say, "wow, what is that extra taste?"   Definitely a good recipe to have on hand.

Simple, foundational chicken salad recipe. Added a little garlic powder and Dijon mustard to increase flavor. Very successful with Hawaiian rolls as sliders for baby shower. Great basic recipe.
I considered this quantity to work for 8 sliders.

I loved this recipe! That being said, I had to change a few things, I did not add the nuts or the pepper (I hate both.) I also added some chopped green peppers (I used a premade mix of peppers and celery.) I usually hate most tuna and chicken salad recipes, but this knocked it out of the park!!! It wasn’t overly spiced and it didn’t involve a lot of ingredients. This is now my go-to recipe for chicken salad! Thanks for posting it!

I love this recipe for a basic chicken salad sandwich, I also throw in some low fat cheese, a little mustard and pickles. With cranberries tonight. I even just end up using the packs that come in the salad mix because my salad goes bad so I keep those for the occasion!

This really is a great, simple recipe. I like a pretty “basic”, unadulterated chicken salad and this fits the bill. The lemon juice gives it a nice, fresh taste so it’s not bland. I didn’t have any celery so I added a few shakes of celery seed. I also didn’t have any almonds...will add them next time. Gonna let it sit in the fridge overnight and I know it’ll be even tastier in the morning when I make my sandwich to take to work ! Thanks for a great “everyday” recipe !

There are inconsistencies between the video and the written recipe (teaspoon of lemon juice vs tablespoon of lemon juice), but the most glaring omission is the lack of any salt.  Add salt, double the pepper, and it starts to get some flavor.  As others have mentioned, some garlic and onion powder add a little depth as well.

Quick and delicious. I was out of celery so it was missing that delightful crunch. I added a little garlic powder and little mustard. Next time I'll be ready with the celery.

Great starter recipe. Too bland for my tastebuds, but a nice recipe to build on as a foundation for a medley of variations. I omitted the almonds. We're not fond of almonds in my household. Instead I added finely chopped pecans. I added celery (diced small... similar to a brunoise cut) and some chopped green onions. I also added sliced grapes, shredded carrots and small sweet pickle cubes (I purchase the sweet pickles cubes at Kroger, or just use sweet pickle relish). For spices I used cracked pepper, salt, a smidgen of cayenne pepper and some of my homemade chicken spice (paprika, okonion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary and sage). Then I stirred in the added the mayo. Yummylicious!

Yes, I did make changes. I do not like mayo. I tried potato and macaroni salad for the first time in my 30's. I like them. So, my SO asked me to make some chicken salad. I found this recipe. It looked simple enough, but I remember my family always putting onions in it, and SO is not crazy about nuts in food. I left out the nuts and added 1/2 cup chopped onions. Only change I made. As I was putting it away I thought, why not? So, I actually tried it. I liked it! All I can say is anything that can make me like mayo has got to be pretty good!

My first time making chicken salad and it's DELICIOUS! I agree on the lemon juice, don't leave it out. It adds a great flavor. I added about 1/2 cup of dried cranberries because I LOVE them. So delicious.

The best ever.  I thought it might be a bit to peppery for my elderly Mom ,but she loved it.  My old recipe was always bland.  To much mayo, too little flavor.  This is a keeper!

I substituted satsuma juice for the lemon juice and walnuts for the almonds.  It's good the original way, but this is amazing.  Yes, I'll be making this recipe again.

I had some leftover chicken breast that I had shredded and was looking for an easy recipe to use it up. I had never added lemon juice to chicken salad and I loved it. No need for salt, the pepper and lemon juice are perfect in this recipe.

I think I will try shredding the chicken next time.  I was altttle  bland.  Maybe after it sits in fridge, it will taste better.  Not bad, just not awesome.  I did use fresh lemon juice.

I give this recipe a 4 but a 5 after adding additional ingredients. I doubled the recipe since I'm using for a potluck. I also used chopped walnuts which I chopped up to tiny bits. I used Krafts mayo with olive oil and this brand already had cracked pepper so I didn't need to add anymore pepper. I also added a teaspoon of onion powder, garlic powder and poultry seasoning and a 1/4 teaspoon of paprika. I didn't have to add any salt only to the water when boiling. Love the flavor

So simple and delicious and filling without being a gut bomb. I poach the chicken to keep it nice and tender and chop it up finely. Blanched, slivered almonds are such a treat in this. Green onion, parsley - whatever add-ins you like/have would totally work. Just plain yummy.

I wasn't really impressed with this. Followed the recipe as written and it was just kind of bland for me. I added more celery, and a 1/2 cup chopped green onion and it was a little better. Didn't have more time to play with it, so I will try the Best Chicken Salad Ever recipe next time.

Very basic. Easy to make -  I had all the ingredients in my pantry already .   I'm not a big fan of celery and so I replaced it with cut up grapes.  The chicken salad at my favorite café has grapes in it and so I took a chance -  it turned out great!

Delicious !!!!!! First of all l liked the simplicity of this recipe. It's a great foundation.  I followed the ingredients and instructions except for two things. I made this with a rotisserie turkey breast and added sliced apples. This one is going on my recipe book. Thank you for sharing.

This is the first time I tried making chicken salad. I desperately needed something different for my lunches than salad.  I made it exactly as directed but used store prepared chicken strips that were already seasoned and roasted.  It was pretty good but I agree there could have been more flavor. So next time I make this I will use some other reviewers suggestion to add some punch to this. But still, the basic recipe is quite nice.

This is so simple but so delicious! 

My favorite tea room that I moved away from served a very similar chicken salad. I could never figure out  what made it so different. Thanks to this recipe, I'm certain it's lemon juice! I'll continue to tweak the recipe to try & imitate it more, but now I finally have a base recipe. 

The only changes I made this time were to omit the almonds & add chopped cranberries. I'll have to experiment with poppy seeds like the tea room, but this is a keeper!

I intended to make it exactly like the recipe, except without the pepper.  My husband and I would disagree on how much pepper, so everyone can add their own if they want.  Anyway, I forgot about the almonds.  But it turned out great.  It's just your basic chicken salad, but I'm sure you could add almonds, cashews, cranberries, grapes or whatever you want to it.  I used rotisserie chicken, so it was tender and juicy.

I gave it 4 stars because it's a too basic to be a five star recipe, but there's nothing wrong with it. It's easy to make and tastes great!  It's an economical way to use up leftover rotisserie chicken. 
Toasting raw almonds is so much better than using pre-chopped almonds. I've made it with pecans and walnuts and it's even better.

This recipe was simply delicious!  I made only one real change, which was using pecans instead of almonds.  I sprayed a baking sheet with Pam, spread the pecans on it in a single layer, and toasted in the oven at 350° for about 5 minutes, then added them at the end.  Also, I poached chicken breasts and added salt, basil, rosemary and thyme to the water.  Gave the chicken a delicately seasoned start.  When mixing all together, I added a few spoons of sweet relish and just a touch of mustard.  my family raved about it!

As always, I made the recipe exactly how it's written and really liked it. Since then,  I'll tweaked it a bit depending on my mood ;)  I use a minimum of 2 cups chicken and usually use a rotisserie chicken, combination dark and light meat. I always use full fat Hellman's mayo and add 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of ground white pepper. If I'm not adding halved white grapes or Craisins, I'll add 2T. sweet pickle relish.  Chopped pecans replace almonds. But as I said, the original recipe is 5 stars as it is. DO NOT omit the lemon juice!

I am very picky about chicken salad. Not a fan of relish and only like grapes in curry chicken salad, so I gave this recipe a try since I had leftover rotisserie chicken and all of the ingredients in hand. I did season the leftover chicken with dry basil and added garlic and onion powder and a little spicy Dijon mustard, as other reviewers suggested. I also added about a third of a yellow onion, finely diced. It was great! Served it on a bed of romaine lettuce leaves. Definitely a keeper! I may try other enhancements, but plan to make it a lot during the hot summer months! Thank you!

A great basic recipe.  Enjoy it as-is, or tweak it to your preference.  I add a tablespoon of ranch dressing sometimes, or honey mustard.  Sometimes I sub part of the mayonnaise for guacamole and add a pinch of cumin.  This is a great, simple starter that lends itself well to customization.

The only change I made was to use sliced almonds instead of slivered because that is what I had on hand. It turned out delicious and was a big hit with the whole family. We make this recipe every time we have left over chicken.

This was a bit too basic for me, but I know that some people really like it this way. I made two chicken salads for a lunch yesterday. One had curry and lots of add-ins, and this one for those who like things more plain. I left out the almonds and added some garlic powder, onion powder, sweet pickle relish and a bit of parmesan cheese. It was well received.

Me and my son both loved this recipe. I did add some garlic powder, salt and pepper. I left off the almonds because we did not have any and I did not want to chance walnuts.  The only thing I think that would be good for next time would be dill pickles.

Excellent! I added a bit of brown mustard, onion and mushrooms. Don't leave the lemon juice out! It really sparks it up without being really obvious. I'll definitely be making this again, and I'll probably add different things next time-the basic recipe  is wonderful by itself, by the way (I tasted it before I started adding) but it really comes to life with your own additions.

I made it with the laughing cow creamy Swiss light cheese wedges to replace the mayo. They give you the creaminess without all the fat and calories. I'd recommend one wedge for each chicken breast you use.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder and a little Dijon mustard at the suggestion of some of the other reviews and it turned out great!

This is exactly what I was looking for. I used breast meat from a wonder roast chicken. (The other parts went into soup). From there, I had to substitute a few things with what I had on hand. A little bit of green onion instead of celery. (I would have preferred celery). The only nut-like thing I could find in the pantry was raw Pepitas. So, I roasted those. Excellent. Thank you very much!

I loved this, such a classic. I did however make a couple of changes...I always have apple pecan clusters on hand for a snack, so I divided the clusters and toasted them in a sauté pan. Also, instead of celery I chopped up some spinach stems for some added nutritional value and finally I added some sliced cherry tomatoes on the sandwich with romaine lettuce...so very good :)

I had a lot of chicken left over from the holidays and thought this would be a good way of getting rid of it other than throwing it away. I didn't change anything. Made some additions, like relish, more lemon juice, other things to taste. However, overall this was easy, simple and delicious.

First time poaching chicken for salad...great idea better than canned chicken. Followed someone's suggestion and used sour cream & mayo combo; great idea it lightened it. The lemon juice was a great addition. Had nn nuts but no one missed them.

This is awesome. I kind of use this as a base recipe, and I have added a little bit of sweet onion sometimes, some chickpeas sometimes. Adding a little bit of onion seems to be the best! Just experiment a little bit and make it your own.

Loved it as written.  Loved it when I substituted the almonds with chopped apples and walnuts, as well. Served on a croissant with Romaine and tomato slices.

Good basic recipe that you can tweak to your liking! I took the advice of others and added some spices to kick up the flavor a notch. I added garlic powder, minced onions and paprika. I also added in one sliced green onion and about a cup of drained crushed pineapple.

Great base. I did something I never ever do which is buy a rotisserie chicken. It was cold n half off so I thought ,why not. Like others ,I added onion ,well ,a shallot. Nice and crispy with toasted almonds,celery and shallot. Love the little tang from lemon. May add a few more drops. I've been looking for something that had no fruit in it or pecans or walnuts. Thank you !!!!!

This is a great base recipe!! I used walnuts instead of almonds. I found it to be a little dry for my personal preference, so I added an extra 1/8c. mayo. Also used a little bit of McCormick's garlic and herb seasoning for flavor since I saw garlic powder as an addition in a couple of other ratings. So delicious!!

I had never made chicken salad prior to this recipe. It turned out delicious! I didn't use almonds...and I've since made it 2x without any lemon and it tasted just as good.  Such a quick and easy meal! Can't believe I waited until I was 40 to make this!! ;)

Fantastic.  Adjusted all ingredients based on 3 cups of chicken.  Also added drained 15 oz. of mandarin oranges; 1/4 tsp each of onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Also used light mayonnaise.

This was a great basic recipe for starters, as reviews say you can make it your own and it still turns out amazing. I didn't use lemon but will on the next go round! I added a few things, lil salt, a splash of vinegar for bite,I cut the mayo in half mixing it with hidden valley ranch, an topped off my sandwich with a few mild banana peppers(i love a good pucker!)and it was delicious!

used to make this all the time, but found recipe in BoarsHead booklet at deli counter using similar ingredients but with confectionary sugar and it is wonderful for a change.  Try it.

I agree that this is an excellent basic chicken salad. I've made it like the recipe, and I've also experimented with it by adding dried cranberries, curry powder, or herbs like thyme. Yep, I love chicken salad.

I've made this dozens of times except I use half mayo and half sour cream... so much better! I use a little finely chopped green onion, and garlic to taste.  Be sure to toast the almonds first so they don't get soggy.  Everyone loves this recipe.

I make this often.  I add red or green seedless grapes, halved, chopped pecans roasted and salted and chopped Granny Smith apple.  You get the sweet, and salty with these additives.

YUM!  Great starter!! I used a smoked chicken and added seasonings (celery seed, garlic salt onion powder) to taste, halved the mayo and compensated with sour cream.  Cut slices of beget and layered chix salad, broken pieces of fresh basil, slender slice of bacon and a thin slice of roma tomato and covering beget.

As written, this recipe is pretty tasteless.  I wouldn't serve it as-is.  It IS a pretty good base though, as far as achieving a decent chicken salad consistency.  You could go several ways with the seasoning in this to make a great chicken salad.  I ended up adding onion powder, garlic powder, minced onion, sriracha, cumin, paprika, and a little splenda and it turned out very well.

Skipped the celery, added some seasoning based on other reviews, added a little bit of sweet relish - boyfriend loved it.  Next time I will use 1/2 miracle whip or mayo with olive oil to lighten it up.

Simple, yet awesome.  I love chicken salad and have been looking for a great recipe for a while. I didn't have any almonds, so I added a few grapes. The salad was awesome and I can't wait until I get home to eat some more.

Wasn't the absolute best chicken salad I've ever had, but it was good. I'd make it again. It was quick, easy, and got the job done. I always keep some canned chicken in my pantry and that is what I used. It made the salad a little gritty, but as the recipe does not specify to use canned chicken I did not take that into account while rating this recipe. The ingredients are simple and common and make it easy to whip up and take on a picnic!

Such an easy recipe that is so versatile. I use 1/4 cup olive oil mayo instead as well as a little onion powder. The lemon basically eliminates the need for salt. I also try to change up the flavors by adding dried cranberries, raisins or roasted unsalted sunflower seeds. I omit the almonds because the kids don't like them.

Great basic recipe! A tad on the bland side, however, without further seasoning. I added a bit of curry powder and some sliced scallions, which upped the impact. I'll be going back to this recipe and using some of the variations suggested in the other reviews.

This is a standard chicken salad recipe that doesn't fail.  I love the crunch of the almonds and celery and use this recipe every time I have leftover chicken.  I sometimes lightly toast the almonds for 30 seconds or so to give it a toasted extra flavor.  Good stuff!

Wow. Being a vegetarian, I have missed chicken salad so much. I made this with Morningstar Farms fake chicken strips. It was absolutely fantastic! I lightly browned the strips in a pan (directions are on the bag), chopped them up, and put them in the fridge to cool. Then I mixed everything together. Soooo good.

This was amazing!  We ate it up immediately and are still craving more.  My new favorite recipe!  I added a little bit to it as well--just a pinch of garlic pepper and a little bit of green onion.  I also boiled the chicken in rosemary, onion, and basil.  It came out tasting very rich!

Very simple and very good! I love the toasted almonds. I also like that the ratio of mayo to chicken is not too high -- it's just right! You must include the lemon. I made it just as is and it was fantastic!

Great starter...aka basic recipe.  For personal tastes, I added chopped green onion tops, about a T of chopped peeled cucumber and swapped chopped cashews for almonds  I also use light mayo due to dietary restrictions.

Very good & easy.  The almonds make it the best. I also used lite mayo & added salt. I would also encourage using chicken that has some kind of seasoning to add flavor.

This was so yummy. I used a little less mayonnaise because my husband doesn't love it in large amounts. He was a happy camper. I will make this again and again.

This was really great- though I did make a few modifications! I marinated the cooked chicken in the lemon juice in the fridge for about an hour. I shorted the Mayo by about 1/8 of a cup and added about 1/8 cup of ranch dressing. I added about 2-3 Tablespoons of chopped onion cause we like onion. It sat overnight in the fridge, and I topped it with chopped pecans before serving WOW!!

i never liked chicken salad, or so I thought. I made this recipe and added some of the suggestions, like diced apples, red onion, onion powder and sunflower seeds. DELICIOUS! Thanks for the basics!

Wonderful recipe.  Sometimes simplicity is best.  I started with the "Boiled Chicken" recipe from this site.  Make sure you cool the chicken in the broth to keep it moist. The salad was just right, not too creamy and definitely tasted home-made.  Didn't add the almonds per hubby's request.  We both loved it!

Very good basic chicken salad recipe. In my opinion, needs a little more. But thats the point of a basic chicken salad, you can add or omit whatever you like. I couldn't taste the lemon juice and I felt it made the mayo runnier. This sat in my fridge for 2 days and it became extremely dry. Not sure why, when I first made it, it was very creamy, though a little runny from the lemon juice. For the checken, I slice chicken breasts in half and then cook in a non stick pan coatded with non-stick spray. And then sprinkle with some pepper and dice when cooked all the way through.  We did serve this over a mixed salad and it was delicious! Next time I think I'll mix in a couple of tablespoons of sour cream along with some of our own personal choices: spicy mustard, some garlic, onion powder. Just add whatever you like to this and it will be great!

I made this as is, but I whipped up a batch of homemade mayonnaise.  It was perfect with some pickle relish or diced apple stirred in!

This recipe was great.. exactly what I was looking to do with the left over chicken from dinner last night! Quick and Easy! I kept everything exact except I shredded the chicken and added just a little more seasoning (Nature's Seasons, it's a medley of seasoning that I use on EVERYTHING). Delicious!

This was very tasty!  I love the crunch of the almonds & celery.  I might try to add grapes next time just to kick it up a little.  Thanks for the recipe!

The name hits the nail on the head.  A wonderful basic recipe.  I added dill weed to it.  I love the crunch of the almonds and celery in the recipe.
