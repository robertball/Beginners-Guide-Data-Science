It was a pretty good start for quiche, but I would definitely make some changes next time. There was too much meat & not enough egg for me to consider it real quiche. I'll cut the meat to 1/2 a pound an increase the eggs to 4 or 5. I also used plain yogurt instead of mayonnaise since I'm not crazy about it. Also, if you used a frozen prepared pie crust, make sure it is completely thawed before you start.

My husband has never heard of a Quiche before so he was a bit wary when I told him what we were having for dinner, and even more nervous when he saw it on a plate. He absolutley loved it, pretty much ate half the pie by himself. Will definitley make it again, but two pies next time--one wasn't enough!

Excellent Quiche.  Tastes more like an egg casserole.  Took around an hour to cook.  Followed the recipe with the exception of adding half a red pepper and an extra egg.  Real hearty.

Was very yummy. I did make a few changes to make it more figure friendly. I used ground turkey, only half the amount of cheese, and halved the mayo by using Greek yogurt. Also, I made the crust from a box so I could make it supper thin. Will make this again. My family loved it.

My family really liked this. It was too salty for my taste. Next time I am only going to use 1/2 tsp salt instead of a full teaspoon. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for a while and have always loved it, but recently I started adding a red pepper and using green onions instead of yellow and it made it so much better! Definitely a good recipe to keep handy.

Very good and something different. I added a small can of green chilis for some extra flavor and I couldn't even taste them so it made me think of how "plain" this would have tasted without. So I suggest adding garlic or something extra for some flavor. Still a keeper at our home!

This was very delicious.  I had extra ground beef in my freezer so the quiche worked out.  I think for the people that said the quiche was watery - cook longer.  I usually end up cooking my quiche longer (around 15-20 minutes longer).  After the 5 minutes of cooking at a high temp I put foil on top of the quiche so it doesn't overcook crust.  I added an extra egg and extra 1/2 cup milk.  I only used 1/2 pound ground beef.  Added a little hot and sweet roasted red peppers from a jar.  Had Mexican cheese in the fridge and added that.  This was very good.  Thank you for the recipe.

I thought that it was delicious. But it was missing something not sure what yet, but I'll figure it out. I definitely enjoyed it just something missing.

It was tasty and my husband loved it. I added an extra egg and had to use mozzarella cheese. I found that it was a bit runny in the center (maybe because of the extra egg?), but I will make it again!

although i think this is my first time trying quiche, i am not a big fan and probably wont make this again unless maybe my father requests it bc he liked it.
