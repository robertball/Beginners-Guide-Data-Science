This was a great "base" recipes for shrimp creole.  As one user stated, the sauce just tasted like tomatoes.  I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and tomatoe paste for the sauce.  I also had to add aaaaaalot of seasoning to the sauce to give it some flavor. I added paprika, extra worsteshire, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt and a healthy amount of old bay.  I added these ingredients a little at a time unti the creole was very flavorful and spicy.  Also, after peeling the shrimp I added a little salt and pepper and let them marinate in the fridge with hot sauce for about 20 minutes.  Overall, this recipe was great, however if you like your food flavorful you'll need to add a lot of seasonings.

this is a good, easy recipe and it contains what we old cajuns call the "holy trinity", celery, bell peppers and onions. if you can, only buy shrimp exactly the way they came out of the sea, put the shells and heads in 2 cups of water and boil down until you get about 1/8 of a cup and add it to the mixture, it will add much more shrimp flavor, also, folks outside of the area continue to believe that everything we eat is "hot", when we say "spicy" we mean that our food uses many types of spices, not just chili powder or hot sauce

The 2T of cornstarch is too much.  Both my husband and I thought the sauce was too thick.  I'll try it again with less cornstarch next time.

Delicious!  Since I prefer spicy foods, I took the advice of others and went heavy with Texas Pete hot sauce and chili powder, and also threw in some cayenne and thyme.  Also, I omitted the can of tomato sauce, since I was pleased with the consistency after adding everything else.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This recipe was easy and fairly fast.  I followed the recipe as printed, but thought there was too much liquid and it needed more hot sauce.  I will make it again, but with a few changes:  more spice (cayenne?), less tomato sauce and chop the vegetables into larger pieces so they don't disappear into the sauce when cooked.

EXCELLENT DISH! As fast as it takes to say "chop chop and stir stir," this receipe was done. So fast and easy...and sooooo good. Spicy but not hot (my daughter could even eat it). I added some red bell peppers but is not needed to make the dish. We all give this one two thumbs up! Thanks katrina!

This is probably my favorite recipe on this website!  I've been making this for dinner for years and my family absolutely loves it!!  I make it exactly as written, and serve over rice.  There are never any leftovers!

My husband's grandmother came to visit and requested I make or take her out for shrimp creole.  She is a VERY hard to please woman and I had never had it, let alone made it.  I followed this recipe to the T and it was a HUGE hit!  She is still raving about it months later.  For my husband and I we now add a little more chili powder, hot sauce, and a bit of cayenne to spice it up, but even without the spice it has a super yummy flavor!

This is a great recipe! I've tried shrimp Creole recipes in the past and they never tasted quite right. This was the taste I've never been able to quite touch on, until now. I spooned out the kids plates first then loaded the pot with hot pepper for my husband and I. Just right! Thanks!!!

I tried this recipe last night, and it was very good. After reading some reviews before I made it, I changed it up just a bit. I doubled the onion, green bell peppers, and celery. I used 1 stick of butter and 1/4 flour for the roux, and doubled the tomato's. I added cajun seasoning, in place of the chili powder and 2 lbs of shrimp. It was fantastic!

This WAS easy to make, and since I was peeling my raw shrimp anyway, I decided to take THEDAD's suggestion to make a stock from the shells.  I also used a bit of fresh ground black pepper, and about a tablespoon of dried parsley (but I also needed to double the recipe).  My family of finicky eaters LOVED it!  I will definately make this again, even if I take some's suggestion to use cut up chicken breast pieces to save a little $$$$.

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet because I've been making it just as written for years now.  My husband requested Shrimp Creole and this is the first recipe I hit on and we both love it.  I don't think you need to change a thing.  Great recipe and great leftovers. Update 9/22/18:  Everytime I eat this I'm wowed by how good it is.  I'm eating leftovers tonight and I don't know if Katrina Berry ever sees these reviews, but I just want to say it's so delicious every single time.  Thanks so much Katrina, I love this stuff! Another update: 1/4/19  I love this so much I just have to say it again.  Thanks, Katrina, this is just so good.

I read the reviews and isn't amazing how peoples tastes differ?  Irener thinks the sauce is too thick and kerrypat thinks it's too thin.  Just goes to show, you can't please everyone.  Instad of adding a can of stewed tomatoes, try adding a can of "Rotel" diced tomatoes and green chilies. It comes in mild, medium and hot which should take care of everyones idea of "spicy".   It also comes in "Chili Fixin's" which already has chili powder in it.  I LOVE garlic so I added 2 more garlic cloves.  I liked the idea of adding more vegetables and chopping them more coarsely.  Just a suggestion.

My husband loved it! I did not use the cornstarch, the sauce was thick enough on its own and I added frozen, cut okra. I also cooked the shrimp in a separate pan with butter and Tony Chachere's until they were nearly done and finished cooking them in the sauce.  I served it over rice and my husband nearly ate all of it.  This recipe is easy to prepare and leaves room to add other ingredients if desired. I will cook this again.

This is a quick and easy dish.  It was bland for our taste so I added white wine and creole seasoning.  The addition of the corn starch made it too thick so I added chicken broth until it was the consistency that I desired.  A great base recipe that can be easily seasoned to suit your own taste.

in echoing what everyone else said... this was good but it needed a lot more seasoning than is called for in the recipe.

I added some oregano, paprika, soy sauce,more hot sauce, more chili powder, some black pepper... etc. Without these it would have tasted like tomato sauce

Very good.  This is a quick meal doesn't really improve with longer cooking--20 mins. tops. It's better the next day. Additional spices help, but that's a matter of taste, so to speak. I used only a tsp of cornstarch, and won't next time. It turned this light, summery dish into a heavy, gloppy stew. Canned tomatoes (stewed or plain) work fine, but I think fresh (peeled and seeded) would be better.

We brought back 25 pounds of shrimp from the Gulf. After looking at all the recipes for creole, this one seemed to be the best. We absolutely loved it! Made the recipe exactly as stated. So glad you offered it. This is definitely a KEEPER. Thank you!

I made this for a Mardi Gras party and it went over very well. Easy to make and very good. I agree with other that 2T of corn starch was to much. I will make it with just 1 next time. Thanks!

I didn't use the measurements much, I just threw everything in the pot.  I did use #5 large shrimp and 3 links of Zumo Sausage sliced up.  Also added another can of Del Monte Petite Diced Tomatoes and Tony Chachere Seasoning and black pepper.  WOW!  This was great and since i'm pregnant, I'm craving it at all hours of the night now.

Wonderful dish, a great way to get some seafood into the diet. Easy to prepare, although ample time should be put aside for peeling and deveining the shrimp -- rather than trying to do it while the onions/peppers are cooking, which I tried with little success.

My wife and I enjoyed the meal with a bottle of Marietta Old Vine Red; the two made for a remarkable dinner. 

Great recipe, and as always, great site.

To make this taste more "creole", I only use San Marzino canned tomatoes and "cut" in the spices (use 2 tablespoon of Chile Powder), 3-4 tblspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and double the onions and green pepper. I also used 1.5 lbs of small precooked shrimp instead of medium. Mince the garlic and I used 3 cloves. Hot sauce to taste.

Very good! I added in Red Bell Peppers, went a little heavier on the Chili Powder. Overall, I was very impressed. It was a quick meal (start to finish, maybe 20 minutes tops). I served it over grits, which was delicious!

Awesome! This was so easy to make and tasted great! I used a can of "Cajun" stewed tomatoes instead of the plain tomatoes and the end result was delicious! I'll definitely make this one again.

I cooked and ate this for the first time ever and it was very good.  I added cayenne pepper, a little more chilli powder, and 1 1/2 tsp. of hot pepper sauce.  Great turnout--will make again.

This dish turned out great.  It was really quick because I used frozen chopped onions and frozen green peppers. I also had to substitute cayenne pepper for the chili powder and didn't add celery.  Everyone loved it.  Can easily have these ingeredients on hand for one of those dishes I can make at any time.

The meal was stunning!!  Our whole family loved it.  The only changes I made were that I left out the green bell pepper (no one likes that in our family), increased the garlic and instead of adding chilli, I reduced the tomato sauce by 1/4 of a cup and replaced that with a South African sauce called Peri-Peri sauce which is made with chillies and commonly eaten with seafood.  Even my daughter, who does not like spicy food, devoured it and, dare I mention it, ...licked her plate clean when she was finished (she's 11)!!!!

I needed a quick recipe for dinner and had a craving for Creole.  The recipe was an excellent fast version and the taste was great.  If anything, it needed a little more hot sauce.

Creole is my favorite dish when we visit NOLA and this was my most successful attempt.  I substituted creole seasoning for the chili powder (adding a little more as mentioned by other reviewers) and doubled the onions, peppers, celery and garlic.  I followed directions from that point and it turned out fabulous.

Easy to make, and like a lot of Cajun cooking, you don't have to get the proportions exactly right - I ended up using 4 tablespoons of flour because I didn't have corn starch available, and the 1/2-cup stuff was all approximate. Everyone loved it, and I would definitely make this again.

This was a delicious base recipe.  We like it SPICY, so we were very liberal with the hot sauce, doubled the chili powder, and added red pepper flakes and cayenne.

this recipe was pretty good; the family loved it. next time i make it i'll leave out the stewed tomatoes and just use tomato sauce and add my own tomatoes; that way they're a decent size. and i added 2 tsps of sugar just before i added the shrimp, and of course, a bit more cayenne :)

Superlicious!  I did not have green pepper, so I substituted red, and I also did not have a can of tomato sauce on hand, so used 8 oz. of Shriimp Cocktail Sauce instead.  I think the cocktail sauce added a depth of flavor.  This is my husband's new favorite shrimp dish!

I used this recipe yesterday and it was quite tasty.  I must admit I was a little heavy handed with the Red Pepper Flakes, so it was extra spicy.  I like it spicy but my boyfriend had a hard time, there was a fire in his belly.  Will definitely make this again but next time I will take it easy with the flakes.  Yummy!!!

This shrimp creole was great, and, having lived most of my life in Louisiana, I have had my share of shrimp creole!  This was the first time I ever made it, however.  I sifted through the recipes on this website, and the ingredients and method of preparation looked to be the closest to authentic Louisiana shrimp creole, so this is the one I prepared.  It was not only delicious, but really healthy compared to most Louisiana food!  I highly recommend this dish.

This was very disappointing. I made these changes and it turned out fantastic.  First I used tomatoes with chillies and peppers,  cut the cornstarch in half, tripled the chili powder,added 1/2 teaspoon creole seasoning and added 1/2 teaspoon old bay.

I made this twice in two weeks I liked it so much! But in order to get 5 stars be sure to MARINATE the shrimp in some of the same creole seasoning as your first step so that the shrimp is infused w flavor--not just the sauce.  Very easy and really tasty. I added extra chili, hot pepper, used 2 pounds of large shrimp, omitted the garlic and substituted  tomato sauce also for the stewed tomatoes. I found it to be great with rice OR angel hair pasta. Thanks.

This was awesome!!  I added half a pound of sliced sausage(Conecuh or andouille) and it was even better.  Saute it along with the vegetables.  Doubled the garlic and added 2 splashes of chicken broth to cut the tomatoe sauce a bit.  Also added 1 tsp. of Tony Chacheres cajun seasoning.  Served it over rice w/garlic bread and a salad.  Next time I'll make more so we can have leftovers for lunch.  GREAT RECIPE!!!

A big hit in my house! I served over rice, added an additional pound of shrimp and a can of chopped tomatoes with green chilis for some added "zip". I also doubled the recipe so I had plenty left over for a second meal (I read in the reviews about how it tasted better after sitting over night, so I wanted to make sure I had enough left over to serve as another meal during the week next week.

I loved that this was so fast and easy, but I did think it was quite bland. I added about a 1/4 cup of red wine which helped alot, and 2 Tbls of parsley. Next time I might would replace the stewed tomatos and tomato sauce for diced tomatos and see how that works. I thought the tomato flavor was too strong.

All I can say is this recipe is YUMMY! I even brought the leftovers for lunch today! It was so easy too!  I did substitute the Chili Powder with Creole Seasonings and added a bit more Hot Sauce. When I told my Husband I was making Creole he replied - "Yuck I hate Creole"  Then he proceeded to eat 2 full plates! Our daughter loved it too!

Yum!  Fantastic recipe.  I would definitely add some more chili powder and red pepper sauce next time.  Wasn't quite spicey enough for my taste.  Tastes great over rice or try it over spaghetti noodles for something different!!!

I have made Shrimp Creole for years and we love it with a crisp salad and southern biscuits. Since reading the reviews I will have to make it w/the shrimp stock. I don't even have to taste this recipe w/the fresh shrimp stock i know it will be yummy. 
Thanks to cajun viewer.

This is a classic recipe, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs a bit more herbal seasoning.  I added some oregano, thyme, and rosemary, along with a bit of Old Bay and smoked paprika. And the suggestion to make a stock of the shrimp shells really boosted the shrimp flavor.  I used flour instead of cornstarch and petite diced tomatoes w/some tomato paste.  I haven't yet been able to duplicate my mother's, but this is the closest I've come.

This recipe was good once I added more seasonings:  1 tsp of Emiril's creole seasoning, 1/2 tsp more of chili powder and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it a little extra kick. Try this, you'll like it.

This was good. I added extra red pepper since that is too my taste. It kicked up the flavor and this decreased the tomato taste to the sauce. I also added cucumbers and pineapples for just something extra.

Love it! This is my first time making shrimp creole my self and it came out great. Very easy to make and reminds me of being back down south. I made a few minor adjustments based on what I have in my cabinet but I stayed pretty true to the recipe.

If I could give this recipe 6 stars, I would!! This is so delicious; served over rice, it is just like a $20+ plate of jambalaya at your local 5 star restaurant! Even my kids loved it, and they do NOT like spicy food! The flavor is so amazing! If you have a craving for some creole-style shrimp, I'd say cook up this easy meal, and you will not be disappointed! And if you share, you're sure to impress your guests :)

My husband and I love this recipe.  We like things a little spicier, so instead of stewed tomatos I used canned diced tomatos with spicey red pepper, add paprika, tobasco, and diced chipotles in adobo.  We also like to add more veggies to make for a more well balanced meal and spicey chicken sausage as well as the shrimp...not exactly authentic shrimp creole with these additions but we just love it.  We serve it with dirty rice and corn muffins.  Yum

This was good! I substituted green onions for regular onion because that what I had on hand. The sauce thickened up nicely due to the cornstarch in the recipe. Great overall flavor with a nice "kick"!  This is the perfect weeknight recipe - quick & easy. I served the shrimp creole over brown rice along with a green salad and crusty rolls  to mop up the delicious sauce!

I love this recipe and have made it about a dozen times, including tonight.  My minor alterations make it even better, at least to me.  I put it over grits instead of rice, dice a fresh slicing tomato (or a couple of Romas), and just use a dash or so of red pepper flakes for heat.  Love it...even using cornstarch instead of making a time-consuming roux.  I live on the Gulf--I should know great creole!

This tasted just ok, but I'm going to rate it a 4 because its easy to make and because my boyfriend, who's stingy on stars and only gave it a 3, did say he would eat it again. I added cajun seasoning, paprika, and tripled the amount of chili powder and hot sauce and still found this lacking flavor (although it had plenty of heat!). I will continue to look for a restaurant quality recipe but will keep this one on hand for a quick meal. Oh yeah, I also used only 1 tbsp of corn starch.

I just loved this recipe!  I didn't happen to have any shrimp so I used cooked, cubed chicken tenderloins instead. I too, only used half of the cornstarch and increased the chile powder and Worchestershire substantially. I wanted plenty of sauce for the rice so I added a can of tomato soup and was really pleased with the little bit of sweetness it provided. I also had some beautiful sliced yellow squash frozen that I cubed and added and was a delicious addition.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used tilapia filets instead of shrimp. I added an extra 8 oz can of tomato sause and a few more dashes of worcheshire to ensure there was enough sauce to serve over the rice. This was delicous...thanks for the recipe.

I used 16 oz can of tomatoes as we like saucy dishes.  This is an easy, yummy keeper. Served it to my parents when they visited and my father wouldn't stop eating.   Even the picky hubby agrees.  Thanks!

I've loved the Shrimp Creole I've had in restaurants for years, but had never tried cooking it myself.  I tried this recipe tonight for the first time, and it was excellent!  It was the best Shrimp Creole I've ever tasted.  Thanks so much to the lady who shared the recipe, and to AllRecipes.com for making it available on the internet.

I pretty much followed the recipe as written. I did all the prep work in advance - coarse chopped the veggies, cooked the rice, peeled the defrosted shrimp, and made a little stock from the shrimp peels. Cooking was a snap, although I did  extra spices (Old Bay and smoked paprika) as recommended in other reviews. Because we like our sauce more "runny," I added a little "shrimp stock" for the consistency we desire. Just heated up the rice in the microwave and spooned the creole over it. It was delicious and I think can be dish for company!

This was really good. After reading many reviews I added a few things. I added about 2 teaspoons of Frank's Cayenne sauce, several shakes of Trappey's pepper vinegar, a bay leaf, about a 1/4 cup of shrimp stock and some paprika. I served it over grits and it was great. I will make this again.

I followed the recipe as indicated, and it turned out excellent! The only thing was I added less cayenne pepper since I'm not a big fan of spicy food, but other than that, the dish was a success! Thanks for the recipe, will make this again!

Just made this last night and doubled the recipe.  It was so easy and was a HUGE hit.  I loved it!  ...I actually could've added a bit more hotness to it, but that can be done on a bowl to bowl basis.

This is delicious.  My family loves this recipe, especially the men.  I put this over rice and yum.  We rarely have leftovers.
Thanks for a great recipe.

I really enjoyed this dish. I didnt add the butter because i tried to make a healthier version without it. It still came out great. I also added a few more spiced to pump up the heat. It goes perfect served over steamed rice and corn on the cob for a complete meal.

I love this recipe and make it all the time.  I sometimes substitute Rotel tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes and we love the extra kick.  Often times I'll make it with chicken breasts as I always have the ingredients in my pantry.

I make this dish a lot because it is in high demand around my house.  I do not measure a lot of the ingredients, especially the vegetables and sauce.  I serve it over brown rice (to give it a healthier kick) and it still taste just as good.  I added one turkey kielbasa and put some to the side for one of my guest that is allergic to shellfish and they really enjoyed it.  It doesn't change the flavor, just give it more flavor.

I LOVE this recipe! We make this all the time in the summer, when veggies are more abundant.  I don't generally measure the celery and onions, just eye ball it and it always turns out great!!

GREAT RECIPE...I ENJOYED COOKING IT AND FAMILY ENJOYED EATING IT.
THE ONLY THING I WOULD DO DIFFRENT IS ADD SEASONING WHILE SAUTEEING THE ONIONS/PEPPERS & CELERY FOR MORE FLAVOR

Added a whole lot of cayanne pepper to make it spicy and served over rice.  I used precooked shrimp and added them at the last minute.  Good for a busy night when you don't have a whole lot of time to cook.

5 Stars!  One of the best recipes EVER!!!  

I followed the recipe down to the letter (almost).  I am an amateur cook but these directions where simple.  Did what SIENNA1929 suggested and added 1 extra pound of shrimp making it 2 pounds total.  I also had to add 4 ounces extra of tomato sauce.  

It was delicous!  I like spicy food and doubled the amount of chili powder with great results.  I also put about 3 spurts of the hot pepper sauce and its still not too spicy for me!  But others say that flavor gets more intense after you refrigerate it and warm it up the next day so I will not add any more spicy stuff until I taste it then.  I used medium size white shrimp because they where on sale this week.  A wonderful taste.  Be careful not to cook over 5 minutes!  After that if shrimp are too al dente just let them sit in the saucepan because they continue to cook in the hot liquid even after you turn off the stove.  That is why I say turn off the heat after 5 minutes.  

Truly exceptional recipe and I used 1 entire red bell pepper.  I think the red bell pepper really made the presentation effect extravagant and I recommend using red or orange bell pepper if you are serving it to guests.

I prefer to substitute a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos or diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions, depending on how spicy I want the recipe to be.  I also tend to omit the butter and cornstarch (don't neesd the fat and calories!).

When I tried this I was going to give it a rating of 3, but like a good stew or chili, I found that the next day that the flavor. That changed my mind to a 4 rating. Quick, easy and quite tasty.

This was a BIG hit in my house. The flavor was great. I would tweak it a bit if you aren't big on tomato flavors. I also used more garlic than the recipe calls for. Chop your veggies bigger than recommended so they don't get lost in the sauce. Tastes great with Martin's Potato rolls. Try adding Oregano, more pepper (wasn't hot enough for me) or whatever spices you love.

This was deeeelish!  I went a little heavy with the hot sauce according to my family  (mom's revenge!)  and at the last minute I realized I didn't have a can of tomato sauce on hand (substituted watered-down tomato paste) but it was still great.  Nice and quick too.  Thanks

This was extremely tasty, and very easy to change as necessary.  I had only about 1/2 pound of shrimp and no tomato sauce, so I estimated all the rest of the ingredients and used a little tomato paste and Creole seasoning.  It was quick to make, and I'll use this recipe again.

Great recipe!! I used a little less cornstarch and a little more spice, but it really depends on your personal taste.  All my picky eaters asked for seconds and it was SO easy to make.  I also suggest to add/use cubed pieces of cooked chicken (for a cheaper version).

it is just me or did this lack any flavor whatsoever?  it just tasted like bland tomato sauce.  i thought the sauce was too thick, so if i made it again, i'd add less cornstarch.  also, i didnt think it was spicy enough and lacked other spices so i added crushed red pepper flakes and salt and pepper.  i doubt i'd make this again

This was easy and very good!!!!  I followed other opinions and added cayenne pepper and extra hot sauce.  I also used fresh tomatoes that I put in my food processor. Also put kielbasa in it.  I put precooked frozen shrimp at the end. Will make again!!!

This was the second time I made this dish and I swear I have my husband and our friends almost licking their dish when there is no more left.
The first time I used Crushed Tomatoes, which turned it into more of a Pasta dish. So I served it over Linguine. Last night I made it with Plump whole tomatoes (Large can) and served over rice.
Let's just say our lips were a nice pinky color.
I use Cayenne & Paprika instead of Hot Sauce and it gives it a nice kick.
Thank you so much Katrina and Allrecipes, this is a fav in our Toronto, Canada house!

My family loved this - I used Chicken instead of shrimp since that was what I had on hand.  I did not add the corn starch until the end and added more hot sauce and a little cajun seasoning.  It was a winner

Great taste!  I did have to spice it up to suit our taste but it really was good.  My husband really like it - he said this is a once-a-week every week meal.

This is an awesome recipe.  I made it just as written and got lots of kudos from the family.  Not too spicy at all, just like creole should be.

We loved this shrimp dish.  I cooked it in the morning leaving out the shrimp till I warmed it again at dinner so the flavors would have a chance to meld.  Because we love spice I added a little bit of cayenne pepper and a bay leaf.  It is a keeper for sure.

Good recipe but the amount of chili powder and hot sauce is to low (good for kids though).  I recommend adding a couple heaping tablespoons of a good chili sauce (Sambal Oelek) to give it a kick.  Will make again.

delicious as written. however, added a little tomato sauce (1/4 cup) to loosen up the liquid and mellow out the spice. followed advice of one person adding  frozen okra instead of corn starch. daughter and i loved it with just a hint of heat. fyi used instant rice, not as sticky as regular cooked rice so presentation (molding rice in cup and inverting in middle of plate) was not as i had planned but tasty none the less

I left out the tomato sauce and added more worchester sauce and tabasco, and a can of very finely chopped tomatoes to lesson the sweetness of the stewed tomatoes.

Its a base start.. I made it twice the first time to a T the sauce was very thick and little flavor. The second time I cut the cornstarch in half it was still thick but workable I added creole seasoning and bayrub for flavor and it was 100 times better than the first time

Amazing: did 1 cup onion and added mushrooms , no cornstarch, no tomatoe sauce (put 1 1/2 cup shrimp stock), used can of crushed tomatoes instead of stewed, only 1/2 tsp. chili powder, and added to recipe 2 bay leaves and thym. Did not boil - simmered for 35 minutes then added shrimp. (Remove bay leaves before serving) - see food network shrimp creole recipe - a mix of both.

I made this dish for my husband and he loved it.  I didn’t have cornstarch so I sprinkled flour and mixed it with the veggies.  The sauce wasn’t as thick as others described with flour.  I also added a dash of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  Instead of serving it with rice, I used riced cauliflower as the bed for the shrimp.  Next time, I think I’ll dollop it over grits.  Yum!

As printed and followed this is a basic base recipe for shrimp creole.  The ways it can be improved:
1. Use diced tomatoes 
2. Add some shrimp stock or seafood stock (clam juice i.e.)
3. Add Old Bay or your own creole seasoning 
4. Something magical about that green Tabasco sauce, add it
5. Some Cajun Power garlic sauce.  Look for it, buy it and add it to everything!
6. Add half your trinity (onion, celery and bell pepper) at the beginning, save the other half and add it near the end while you cook the shrimp.  You will enjoy some slightly firm veg that otherwise would be all mush.

The only comment  I want to make is; "It is not the "holy" it is the "Cajun" trinity, celery, bell peppers and onions. At 78 I think I qualify as old enough and having lived from south  LA  to south MS all that time  I'm local enough to say I NEVER heard any  holy trinity  until these TV shows started talking about something else they don't know about.  
I like the dish by the way.

I only used half of the corn starch and added sugar, thyme, basil, a little lemon juice, and Cajun seasoning. Turned out great! Next time I will add more shrimp. I served it with green beans and garlic bread.

This was simple to make, and by using only 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch, was the right consistency.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. Note to chop the celery small so it softens instead of being crunchy. Didn't use the chili powder and hot sauce since not everyone likes it spicy. Added in crabmeat and served over rice.

The basic recipe is good. However, it definitely needs some tweaking to keep it from being bland. I ended up adding parsley, thyme, more chili powder, smoke paprika, creole seasoning, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes and onion powder to get it to a flavor that I was use to. I also halved the cornstarch. The next time I will double the onion. It was a delicious dish AFTER I tweaked it.

I added sliced up (pre-grilled) sausage and served over ziti.  And more than a 'dash' of hot sauce.  As other reviewers have noted, 1 TBS of corn starch is enough.  Stick to the ribs good.

A video would help. I muddled through. But, I wasn't sure how big/small to dice veggies, whether or not to cut the stewed tomatoes, & how long to let it boil.  At the end, it was very good, not great.

I followed some advice from the top review and added 1 tsp paprika, 2 bay leaves, red pepper flakes, seasoning salt and an extra tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I also marinated the shrimp in Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce for a half hour in the fridge. The real key to bringing out the flavour in this dish is to let it simmer for an hour (BEFORE adding the shrimp). Add the shrimp 5 minutes before serving. I served it over a bed of quinoa and it was delicious.

I followed this recipe exactly except for using 2 full tablespoons (used 1 1/2) of cornstarch and the dashes of hot sauce (did use hot sauce on my serving). My family loved this recipe even my LO kept saying, "mmm, good" for every spoonful.

Yum! My family really enjoyed this dish. I made some minor adjustments just to accommodate what I had on hand. I used 2lbs of Jumbo shrimp which I peeled and tossed with salt, pepper, and harissa spice and put in the fridge in the morning to sit all day. I doubled the chopped veggies too (more or less) and sautéed them in a roasted red pepper infused olive oil and butter combination. 2T cornstarch was just fine to thicken the stewed tomatoes and tomato sauce (used a 12oz can). I used harissa again in lieu of chili powder  and put in some generous glugs of both Worcestershire and a blueberry ghost pepper hot sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first time I made shrimp creole. It was fantastic!  I did add more chill and scotch bonnet hot sauce. Next time I will use 1/2 of the corn starch. Overall it had a great taste.

I've tried most of the recipes for this dish and this one was the best. Like others I backed off the cornstarch. My only modification was to add a half can of tomato soup and an extra 1/2 lb of shrimp. The tomato soup gave the sauce a slightly sweeter taste which is my preference for this dish. 

One thing that I suggest when cooking your rice is to saute and boil the leftover shrimp shells to make a shrimp stock which I used in place of plain water to prepare my rice. The whole dish was marvelous.

A quick and easy shrimp creole.  I used a can of chopped tomatoes (with green chilies and onion) in place of the stewed tomatoes.  It was the right consistency without the corn starch.  Next time, I might toss in a bay leaf.  This is a keeper.

An excellent "base"  I used crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato paste.  I added paprika and old bays seasoning and sa good amount of hot pepper sauce.  There is enough to feed 4 adults when serving it with rice.  I look forward to the leftovers!

Did not have stewed tomatoes or tomato sauce, so I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  put half can into food processor til creamy, added half teaspoon of basil and a dash of cajun seasoning.  It was great.  Served with leftover chinese pork fried rice.My picky eater husband asked for seconds.  That's how good it was.

I agree with others that this is a good start-off point for shrimp creole.  After reading several other reviews, I made sure that I doubled a lot of the ingredients listed--onion, garlic, green pepper, Worcestershire, and spices.  I omitted celery only because my husband doesn't care for it, but it still ended up being tasty.  I didn't use any cornstarch (I try to stay away from it if possible), so I used tomato paste instead which thickened the sauce just enough.  I added small, cooked frozen shrimp (thawed) and took the temperature down to a simmer to try to pull out more flavor overall.  Next time, I want to marinate the shrimp for at least an hour before throwing it into the mix.  I liked this recipe!  I would just recommend using a lot more spices/seasonings to your liking.

I followed THEDAD's suggestion to made a broth from the shells and tails and reduce it. I added about 2 tablespoons of that to the sauce, which made the sauce  what we felt was a good consistency with the 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I was tempted to use extra seasonings as others suggested, but since my partner doesn't like things very spicy, thought I'd better use the recipe pretty much "as is" the first time. I added extra hot sauce to my own serving. In the future I'll probably experiment with different seasoning combinations. Even my partner said he could handle a little bit more.

I've made this it's a great base but to really get layered flavor I put some shrimp peels in while sauteing  vegetables for a little while. Also you should make sure you like the consistency of the sauce before you put the shrimp in. You can always reduce the amount of liquid to you liking but once the shrimp goes in your done.

I loved it! I made it for NYE dinner and my boyfriend and roommate thought it was a hit. I did tweak the recipe, though. I forgot celery and garlic at the store so I just used a lot of garlic powder. The amounts of seasoning that the recipe recommends was definitely a base. I added more chili powder, hot sauce, and added seasoning salt to give it more flavor. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp.

This is close to a great recipe.
Double the garlic
forget the cornstarch, make a couple of tbs of light blond roux
 
cook it for 45 min , then add roux , paresely, green onion,  then shrimp in last 10 min and your there. thin out with water if needed,   Salt , black pepper, dash of hot sauce, and cayenne if desired.

The other proportions are correct.

It's a good base recipe but it NEEDS more flavor. I doubled the Worcestershire, chili powder & hot sauce and added Old Bay seasoning and garlic powder. Like IRNER posted, 1 TBSP corn starch is enough . I'm allergic to green peppers so used red bell peppers & added tiny heads of broccoli and chopped parsley...Mmmmm!!! All in all, I'd make it again tweaked to my liking of course.

It's a good base but it has too much tomato in it. There needs to be a roux, or something. Some zing to the zang.

As a quick meal this is one of the best.  So simple, but yet so rewarding.  I sub'd jalos for green peppers and used a TBSP of Old Bay instead of chili powder.  Cooked it in a wok to keeps temps high while adding the shrimp.  Dumped the finished creole in a bowl of jasmine rice.  yeah, i prefer the J.  Only complaint is that I am hungry 2 hours later.  

Never think you can't cook!

It gets 3 stars as is. To improve it I substituted 2Tbl of flour for the cornstarch, upped the chili powder to 1Tbl and added 1Tbl of Cajun seasoning (I use Emril's). I also seasoned the shrimp with 1tsp of Cajun seasoning. I left the hot sauce out and added it after cooking for those who don't like the heat I do. Got good flavor with a slight kick of spice before the hot sauce was added. Make it as hot as you want.

This was an awesome recipe. I tried this over grits, after trying it at a local restaurant. It came out very similar. I was very pleased with the flavor, but instead of hot sauce I added a little cayenne pepper.

I agree with others that this is a great base recipe but needs more seasoning.  I made it as written except I used 12 oz shrimp and 8 oz cod.  I boiled 3/4 c dry white rice and mixed it in with the seafood tomato mixture, which made it like a stew.

In my case, the recipe was easy to cook the sauce was ok, I used old bay instead of chili powder but next time I would add some kind of seasoning or maybe just salt for the shrimp while I am preparing the recipe since I think the shrimps were kind of unflavored. Definitively I would do it again.

this is a great recipe. but i know what the missing flavor is... yes you do need cajun seasoning, but the real missing flavor is one bay leaf. a few reviews mentioned that, but i can say that i've made it w/ and without and it makes a big difference. a bay leaf makes any type of stew better. it's an underlying flavor

This recipe is good, but needs more flavor. It may taste better tomorrow.  My husband loved it.  The sauce is too thick, and next time I will try less cornstarch, and may add a little more chili powder.

Went to a restaurant and my wife decided to order the special, which was Shrimp Creole".  Tasting it, I thought how easy it must be.  Looked up this recipe and have made it for her around 20 times.  Excellent, but I kick it up with more Chili Powder and Pepper Sauce.

Very bland.  I added cayenne and bayleaf, and wish I had added a LOT more onions, bell pepper, and celery and a lot LESS tomato.  No tomato sauce next time.  Better to cook a little longer and get real flavor.

This recipe is super easy and SO yummy!  I use tiger shrimp - in my opinion the high quality shrimp is necessary to make it fabulous. :)  We love spicy and put in a few more dashes of hot sauce and it's perfect!  We serve over rice.

This is a good basic recipe and quick too.  I used this as a "take-off" point and threw in a bit of my own tastes.  Added extra onion and green pepper in good sized chunks and used fresh tomatoes (peel & seed - it's important).  I use Epicure Cajun seasoning (Canadians will know the company), two drops of liquid smoke, and a really big shake of Cholula hot sauce.  The trick is to add a couple drops of Vietnamese fermented fish sauce to add richness without tasting fishy. Took it to work tonight over quinoa instead of rice.

Agree with others who said flour for thickening is not needed.  I made a double batch and spiced it up even more using 1T. Creole seasoning 1/2 T. Chef Paul Seafood Magic.  Also added a bit of fresh chopped hot peppers (Santa Fe Grande).  Awesome Creole. Served over rice with hot apple strudel muffins on the side.

My mother made this for many years, but there is one difference which I think will improve that "missing flavor" many of you have talked about.  We always added smoked sausage which was sliced and added with the vegetables (you can decrease or eliminate the butter when using sausage).  I have used beef or turkey smoked sausage & both taste great....of course turkey is the healthier version.  Try it with the sausage....you'll love it! It makes this a 5 star recipe!!

I didn't have everything on hand so I had to improvise. I only used stewed tomatoes, no tomato sauce. I used a frozen stir fry mixture of onion and bell peppers, garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, and celery seed instead of fresh celery. I also added some creole seasoning, Old Bay and black pepper. I served it over spaghetti noodles, but next time I would definitely have it over rice.

This stuff is amazing!! I added like 2 or 3 tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning and and instead of the chili powdered I used something called "Slap Yo Momma"... It's a Southern thing ;) But very spicy and yummy. It wasn't too hot at all. I added the stewed tomatoes and okra that I precooked. OMG it was DELISH!!!! and I didn't use the tomato sauce. This was soooo good and everyone loved it! Thank you so much for the recipie!!

We had this recipe tonight for dinner.  It was really good.  I did add old bay seasoning as suggested before and only 1 tbs of corn starch.  It came out great.  We will definetly have this recipe again and again.  Even my 1 and 3 year old ate it.

Gave four stars since it needed some minor modifications to make it better:
- Instead of cornstarch, used 1/4 cup flour after sauteing veggies in 4 tbsp. butter to make a roux. 
- Added about 4 oz. of water to thin the sauce out a bit.
- Added a dash of cayenne, couple tbsp of salt and pepper as well as some Paul Prudhomme Poultry Magic to give it a little mor flavor and spice.
- Coated shrimp in Poultry Magic seasoning before adding to the Creole sauce.

I served this at a dinner party to mixed reviews.  Friends who love cajun food and have eaten in Louisiana didn't like it, and complained that it was bland.  The others who didn't normally eat cajun food loved it.  It's a great dish, but not an authentic Louisiana Creole flavor.

Very good, I doubled the recipe, except still used one can of diced tomatoes and as always added more hot spices, and some fresh parsley. I used the 2T of corn starch that was suggested for doubled recipe and it was perfect. Served over rice with eggrolls.

Great!  I have never made this before and it was very easy.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that said 2 tablespoons of cornstarch is too much.  I decreased the amount to 1 tablespoon and also added some water as it was still very thick.

This was very disappointing. I thought it was going to be a lot better than it was. I gave it three stars because I was hoping that maybe because I had to substitute some of the ingredients it didn't come out as good. It just didn't have that wow factor.

Tasty.  Tripled the chili powder and hot sauce, still wasn't spicy enough for me! Just a note:  make sure you saute your celery longer & separately or chop it fine.  Otherwise, it will stay crispy long after your onion and bell pepper are done.  I didn't like the crispy celery in mine, but I knew better! Served over rotini pasta, went well together.  Will try with crab next.

Fair, I followed some of the suggestions & used 1/2 the sauce & cornstarch & shook about triple the amount of seasoning.

I like full flavor & this had just partial flaovr ;)

Really, really good.  I only had 1/2 pound of shrimp, so I added 3/4 pound of cubed red snapper fillets.  Served it over brown rice with extra hot sauce on the side.  Family liked this.  Will make again.

This recipe was terrific.  I made it exactly and everyone loved it.  My husband added more hot sauce to his but he adds it to everything.  I am thinking about trying this with chicken since my kids are not really crazy about shrimp.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was pretty good, but not the best.  I was hoping for a lot more flavor.  My girlfriend liked it a lot and said the flavor was great. So 3 stars from me and 4 from her.  This is a recipe that you should try atleast once...maybe I'll play with it to bring more flavor.

This was great. I can't eat bell peppers anymore, so I had to leave those out and I also omitted the cornstarch. I seasoned it with a small amount of cayenne and Emeril's essence. I served this with steamed rice and breaded, fried okra. It was the perfect meal for a cold winter night!

I side with the minority on this - shrimp in bland tomato sauce.  Even after a couple extra glugs of Franks Hot Sauce and Tabasco it was still very bland.  We added creole seasoning to our servings, which helped a little.

delicious easy recipe especially with precut onions,celery and green pepper from the produce dept. I added another pound of shrimp(large)and used a 15 ounce tomato sauce. I loved the taste as is,my husband added some more dashes of hot pepper to his.

Super easy.  Wouldn't change a thing - the spice is just right for me, and my husband just adds more hot pepper sauce at the table.  Serve over white rice with corn bread on the side.

My husband is from Louisanna so I knew he was going to be a tough critic.  He questioned everything I did and I followed this recipe to a tee!  It was fantastic and took no time at all; unlike when my husband makes a creole, it practically takes all day and a ton of extra pots and pans!  Thank you for a great and quick recipe!

I like it spicy, so I added additional red pepper flakes and a dash or two extra of the hot sauce. This is delicious! I love making it!

I doubled this one as I happened to have 2 lbs. of shrimp in the freezer so this made a lot!  I followed it exactly, adding more heat to it as we like it that way.  I served it with red beans and rice and coleslaw.  Great meal.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was delicious, and my family loved it! The only adjustments I made were adding more shrimp (about another pound)and I substituted a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce for the stewed tomatoes and the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.

This was very good, both my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did add a little oregano and more chili powder and hot sauce for a bit more spice, otherwise...great! (Oh, didn't have any tomato sauce, so I added 1/2 can tomato soup & a little ketchup.) Very easy and quick...I even used frozen shrimp which I ran under hot water just to separate and it was still quick!  Thx for sharing!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!!! I followed some of the others suggestions and added some wine and extra spice (heat) and it came out terrific. Next time I think I'll try added a little fish stock to give it a little more flavor. Thanks Katrina.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I followed the instructions, but made some minor adjustments..... I added some red pepper and lots of chili powder to give it a kick.  Plus I added some white wine to kill the strong tomato taste.  Overall the recipe is delicious... especially the day after when the flavors have really settled in.  Thanks for the recipe.

I accidently used my husband's super hot pepper seasoning, so there was a bit of an extra burn. Otherwise, this was excellent. Reminded me of something I'd get at a nice cajun rest. in New Orleans. Yummy!

Made the shrimp creole and I thought it was quick, easy and delicious.  Added additional spice and used diced versus stewed tomatoes.  My family enjoyed it and they tend to be kind of picky.

Easy and good!  Used a diced fresh tomato in place of the stewed and left out the Worchestershire (forgot); came out great.  Reheats well the next day too.

I made this tonight and hubby loved it.  Added a bit more chili powder and hot sauce for a kick.  Otherwise, I followed directions (mostly); I did use garlic & onion tomato sauce and italian style stewed tomatoes to give sauce a bit more flavor, also added some season salt while cooking.  BTW, the large easy peel shrimp were on sale this week, so I used them.  I think they were the perfect size for this recipe (and I about 1.25 lbs for the recipe).

I hate to go against everyone else, but I didn't much care for this recipe.  It was way too bland.  I tried adding different things to it to give it more flavor, but no matter what I did, it just tasted like bland tomato sauce.  I won't be making this again.

This was quite good.  I used frozen shrimp from the grocery store, so I think fresh shrimp would have been better.  I would even serve this without the shrimp as a tomato gravy for rice.

This creole recipe was absolutely delicious! I marinated the shrimp in a few generous shakes of hot sauce and a TBSP of Asian red chili paste for a half hour before cooking. Nice and spicy turnout!! I also added 1 TBSP of chili powder. Besides cleaning the shrimp, cooking it was quick and easy. Next time when I'm in a rush, I plan on buying pre-cleaned shrimp and this becomes a fast seafood dinner. A great keeper!

I did everything according to the recipe....but - I added two hot smoked sausages.  They really added a zing to it.  I mixed the rice in with everything at the end.  My husband went back for big seconds and was saying "YUM" the whole time.

Very good recipe. I expected it to be spicier though. Next time I will add more chili powder and hot sauce. But overall very good. I topped with a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese as well.

I hate to say this, but I thought this was awful.  It is just missing something and does not have authentic Creole taste to it.  My boyfriend thought it was okay, but I did not like it.  I followed the recipe to the "t", so I don't think I messed it up.

This dish was great. I left out the corn starch, and Wshr. sauce and it still turned out great. Thanks!

I made this for a work party. It was easily prepared, and my dish was the first gone. I also had to write the recipe out for some of the guests!

Thanks for this great recipe.  It was a wonderful addition to our SuperBowl feast.  I did go a bit heavier on the spices and it paid off!!! Yummy, this has been added to the list we will be making again!

Lacked depth of flavour.  Seemed to be too much tomatoe without anything to complement or counteract.  The only redeeming feature about this dish was the shrimp.  However, this recipe was extremely easy and very wholesome.   I would perhaps add a few dry or fresh herbs to give it a bit more flavour.

A good recipe not great but, good. Nice flavor, easy to make. I added a bit more hot sauce for more of a kick.
