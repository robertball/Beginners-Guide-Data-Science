I made this, even though it did not have great reviews.  I tasted it right after I made it, and thought I would have to throw it out, because all I could taste was sugar.  However, after 4 hours in the fridge, it was wonderful, and my husband loved it.  We used it for dipping fresh crab, and I used it the next day for mixing it with tuna instead of mayo for sandwiches.  The secret is letting it rest for at least 4 hours.

I only made this because it had pink in the title and I was hosting a bridal shower where the theme was everything pink......but ewwww....one taste and it was down the drain.  I'm not sure who would want to dip something in this oily mixture....but it wasn't me.

Made this yesterday, and as others, was ready to pitch it in the trash right after making, and tasting. Later last night I decided to give it another taste, and it was very nice.  I did add a little more sugar, since I used Coleman's dry mustard, which is a little stronger than regular dry mustard, and did add some Alpine touch spice mix, really good on most anything, but fish and fries are really exceptional with it.

I would use less mustard , 1/4 gave it an underbite similar to horseradish ...1/4 cup would be better . Put extra ketchup to offset bite.

Equal parts mustard powder (yellow) to equal parts ketchup (red) make orange and then you add 1/2 of mayo and you end up with a lighter orange so I'm not really sure where the pink is supposed to come in at. I made as written and even though the taste was okay, all of the whisking I could handle still didn't get the mayo completely separated.  Sorry but I will not make again.

We used to go to a restaurant that had this for mar far chicken and shrimp but could never get it where we moved to so I was so happy to find this recipe. It's especially great with hot mustard for BBQ pork.

It was missing something.  I recommend using salad dressing (Miracle Whip) instead of mayonnaise.  Also add garlic powder and paprika to taste.  I used 1/4 tsp each.  The key is to let it rest and let flavors mix.  Taste just like white (pink) sauce at our favorite Japanese place.
