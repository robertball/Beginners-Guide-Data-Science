Gave this 5 ***** because the combination is fantastic. I made this concoction for our St. Patty's Party of course I had to configure ingrediants but man o man was it a hit. Word to wise be alert of your own consumption because it will kick in before you know it. But you will be happy happy happy..........

Wow, Carrie. This was an AMAZING drink. It was flavorful but still subtle enough for many too have one or two [or 4...just kidding ;)]drinks. I reallly enjoyed it, thank you so much. My husband and I loved it.

WOW!  Made these for New Years Eve because I had everything on hand.  Good thing I ran out of vodka as I would have kept drinking and these do a sneak attack on you.  Didn't have cherry vodka, used plain.  Put a twist of lime in before serving.  These are going into my permanent rotation...they are easy to drink without being too sweet.  Thank you!!

This was really good...not sweet or boozey tasting. The first two sips I would have given it 3 stars but it just kept getting yummier :) It tastes great if you use cherry Brandy also. If you like cranberry juice...try it!

Very good. My husband was looking for something that wasn't too sweet & so I tried this on him.  I didn't have Cherry Vodka so I used regular Smirnoff but added a splash of Blue Curacao with the Grenadine. Came out FABULOUS! Will be keeping this one.

Fantastic and light and one of those alcoholic drinks where it's tough to taste the alcohol.  I didn't have cherry vodka, so used plain Absolut instead and added a dash of juice from a jar of marachino cherries to each glass along with a cherry for garnish.  Very tasty!

Very good drink! I don't taste the vodka in it. The store that I went to did not have cherry vodka so I bought raspberry vodka instead.
