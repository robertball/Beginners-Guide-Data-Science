I served this for Christmas dinner and it was just okay with my group, myself included. The recipe calls for too much herbs, too much lemon juice (white wine would have been a better substitute) and we found the honey did not complement the sauce at all. I think it's simply that there are just too many flavors going on here.

This was delicious with a capital "D"!!  I did find the lemon a little overpowering and I'll cut that amount in half next time.  I also used only one pork tenderloin (there's 4 of us) and  grilled it.  The next time I may decide to double the sauce - it's that good.  I used regular white mushrooms which I sauteed ahead of time and used the liquid from that.  I substituted chicken broth for the water.  I used brandy instead of cognac.  You certainly don't need a 1/2 cup of the herbs.  A few shakes did it for me.  A perfect dish to impress company or your family.  EDIT: I've made this numerous times.  Along with I said above, I use regular sliced white mushrooms and I simmer the mushrooms with vidalia onion (in place of shallots) in chicken stock - equal to the amount of water listed in the recipe.  when the mushroom are cooked through, I add the other ingredients according to the recipe.  Much easier and very tasty.  1/2 lemon is not enough and a whole lemon is too much so I'm somewhere in the middle with how much I add.

After trying two other recipes from this submitter, I figured why not do this one as well? Came out great! Other two recipes were Asian (Sesame Crusted Mahimahi) and Moroccan (Moroccan Sea Bass Ceviche) in flavor and now this one is French. This person has a very wide range of cooking talent with different cuisines.

For another little tweak on this dish, after you pan sear the pork, let the surface temp. cool for a little bit then wrap the pork tenderloin in proscuitto, serrano ham, or something similar to that before you roast it in the oven. Just watch your seasoning as the proscuitto will also add some saltiness to the dish.

Great recipe! I followed it exactly and it turned out great. Very easy and quick to prepare, yet very impressive. My guests loved it. The meat was tender and juicy and the sauce was so delicious... slightly sweet and very flavourful. All my guests wanted the recipe. Thanks for sharing, Ryan!

This was one of the most delicious recipes I've ever made, and I'm not even a big fan of pork.  I had to make some substitutions based on what was in the house...used many of the component herbs, but didn't have herbes de provence.  Had to use sherry instead of cognac.  Used white button mushrooms instead of porcini.  Anyway, it still came out perfectly.  My husband and I both raved about how good it was.  The honey was an especially great addition to the sauce.  I had my doubts and used a little less than the recipe called for, but it added such depth and a delicious sweetness to the sauce.  Thank you for the recipe!

I am a beginner (really basic!!) cook but this recipe made look like a chef. I did not have cognac but I searched over the internet for substitutions and used apricot juice(nectar).  Since the juice was already sweet, I omitted the honey.  Used 1/2 lemon following other suggestions.  Used all the herbs de provence and did not mind. About the sauce, the instructions OMIT when to mix the heavy cream and I splashed it when the sauce was reduced.  The sauce was wonderful.  The pork needs to be seasoned with salt and pepper before the marinade, I found it a little bland though full of flavor. And yes, you HAVE to double the sauce. Oh! And I used bottom mushrooms (the cheap ones) and makes no difference.

Totally awesome recipe!  Everyone loved it.  Only difference I made was to add salt and pepper to the marinade, which enhanced the flavor of the herbs.  I also found that making the herbs de Provence mixture myself was better than the premixed.  Make sure to use heavy cream, as I found lighter cream tended to separate.

Used less herbs for marinade. Used frozen porcini mushrooms. Substituted brandy for cognac. Too sweet. Overall was pretty good, but next time I will omit the honey.

Excellent.  Kids love it too.  Substituted shiitake.  Definitely use less herbs de Provence (about 1/4 cup is more than enough).  I think the stated baking time is too short, needs at least 40min in oven.  Will be trying the sauce on other meats.

First, I will say that I followed this recipe to a tee.

I really wanted to love this dish.  The pork itself was outstanding, juicy and succulent.  The sauce however was way too sweet and 'sryupy' tasting due to the honey.  The honey just did not go well with the other sauce ingredients.  

I made another mushroom sauce the day after which was much better.  Shallots, mushrooms, sour cream and heavy cream.  Simple and savory.  

If you want a sweet sauce with the pork, I suggest a fruit-based sauce instead.

This review is for the sauce only. I had prepared my tenderloins sous vide, and was looking for a sauce to complement the pork. I followed the recipe, with the exception of using a little milk in lieu of cream. This was exceptionally bland for us. I had to increase seasoning--I even added a packet of Herb-Ox No Sodium Beef bouillon, as well as salt and multiple grinds of pepper. I used the juice of an entire lemon, and used the honey as directed. Still not enough. I had used very high quality dried porcinis, and put the rehydrating liquid through a coffee filter to remove any grit. I used Hennessey for the Cognac, as well as good quality unsalted European style butter. After a LOT of tweaking of this recipe, it did finally come together. But not without huge alterations, finally including a generous dose of sambal oelek. I give 2 stars, just for the initial idea of a few ingredients. Without my adjustments, we would not have eaten this at all.

I loved this dish! I followed some of the other feedback and cut down the herbs and I made extra sauce (I increased it by 50%). I also cut the honey to one T and added a splash of white wine. It was a hit- thanks for sharing!

Really good, but 1/2 cup of herbs de Provence is way too much.  I had not read other reviewers' comments regarding this, and I ended up scraping a lot of it off before I browned the meat.  A couple tablespoons would be more than enough.  I also used shiitake mushrooms for the sauce which worked well.

This is better than any restaurant pork dish I have ever had.  Instead of cooking in the over, I grill for about 40 minutes on the top rack.  Less mess in the kitchen and better flavor.

This was fantastic.  The pork tenderloin tasted great without the sauce, but once you added the sauce it was outstanding. We did make one change because we were unable to get porcini's, but substitued with baby portabellas.  Honestly you couldn't tell the difference and you can save a pretty penny by substituting. We served this for a catering party we did and everyone kept talking about how great the pork was.  We will definately keep this on our menu.

I add yellow potatoes, green beans, onions and home grown carrots. I have been marinating the pork and I think this will be delicious. I don't have mushrooms so I figured I improvise in the oven:) Very good

Very easy and delicious.  No time to marinade so rubbed with 2T Herbs de Provence (1/2 c seemed like a lot to me) browned roasts and then baked as directed.  I deglazed the pan and then cooked off the garlic and mushrooms for a few minutes and added them to the roast after about 10 min.  If I had time I would make this exactly as directed. It was delicious.

Thank-you Ryan!  At a recent dinner party, this recipe received rave reviews.  The pork and cream sauce were fabulous!!  I increased the amount of cream to make more sauce.

This is fantastic! Was better than any pork I've had in a restaurant.

This was pretty good, but not worth the money in our opinion.  I took other reviewers' opinions of doubling the mushroom sauce and only adding 1/4 cup of herbes de Provence.  I don't think the honey went very well with the dish.

Have made this twice and was great both times!  Second time I used half the herbs de provence, however, as it was too much for us the first time.  Next time I make this I plan on doubling the mushroom sauce as it is delicious (it was just enough for 2 lbs of meat in this house).  Also plan on trying the mushroom sauce on other cuts of meat. Mmmmmmmm

Made this using large butterflied boneless chops. Also used regular button mushrooms. Had to tweak the sauce a little bit because it was to tart. Overall, we enjoyed this but I don't know if I would serve it again.

I cooked two 1.5 lb tenderloins.  The sauce was rich and delicious, but I will double it next time. There was only enough sauce for one of the tenderloins!  I used a little less cognac and Herbes de Provence, but I wish I had used the full amount of cognac.  I think there would have been even better flavor if I had let it marinate longer (I only had 2 hours).  When I browned the meat over high temp, the garlic started burning in the pan.  Wish I had scraped some of it off before hand. Still delicious and the meat was cooked perfectly.

I made this last night, and it was great.  My father in law said it was the best thing that I have ever made.  Served it with sun-dried tomato basil orzo.

This is so scruptious.  The pork turned out very tender and the sauce was absolutely divine.  I would cook this again.  This was my first recipe from this site and I enjoy the fact that it allows to adjust serving sizes.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made, and our guests all loved it too.  My 9 year old niece loved the leftovers.  I followed others ideas and used less herbes de provence (1/4 cup) and less lemon juice.  I also used baby portabello mushrooms.  I cannot wait to make it again!

This was really good. I couldn't seem to get the sauce to thicken but it still had a great flavor.

We liked the flavor combination of the shallots and porcinis.  I took the recommendation of other reviewers and cut the herbes de Provence in half.  It was still a bit heavy.  I may have reduced the sauce a little too much as I didn't end up with very much.  So next time I make this I will double the sauce and cut the herbes de Provence even further.

An excellent main dish.  Relatively easy to prepare as well.  I couldn't find the dried porcini mushrooms so used fresh baby portabella.  I sauteed them in the leftover oil after browning the tenderloins; then continued on with the recipe.  I also just substituted brandy for the cognac as it is what I had available.  My husband even liked it, which says a lot!

I thought this recipe was really great my husband would have only given it a 4 rating because of the sauce not the pork. I made extra sauce like suggested. It really had a different flavor to the sauce very rich but I thought it was wonderful.

This is an excellent recipe. my Family really enjoyed it. I did cut back on the lemon juice and honey. Next time I make this dish I will also use less garlic and less herb de province in the marinade.

This is a little pricey, but the flavor, especially of the sauce, is worth every penny.   Friends I served on a weekday night said it felt like  a special Christmas dinner.  I made a non-alcoholic version and substituted apple juice for the cognac.  The meat was super-tender.  Next time I won't cook the sauce down so far, so that we'll have more.  Served with garlic/parmesan/almond Brussels sprouts and baked brown sugar/butter acorn squash.  I made my own herbes de provence but will buy Spice Island version on sale for next time since theirs has the lavender flower.

Sooo good! Couldn't find a brandy I wanted to use so I used maple whisky and a lot less honey. I think the herbs makes a very nice spicy crust, don't think it was too much at all! And I don't understand the reviews that said it was bland because that porcini sauce takes the cake

Tried this recipe for the first time last night. The "herb de Provence" I used had some kosher salt in it as well as all the herbs. (I think this helped my entire recipe to not be bland.) After a short, 1 hour marinade, I scrubbed off about 1/2 of the herbs before I pan seared the tenderloins. Then I put them in a pan in a smoker for 45 minutes. Used regular mushrooms, some juices from the smoked tenderloin pan, white wine instead of cognac, whole lime instead of lemon, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. This tasted VERY acidic, but continued to follow recipe with final step of adding cold butter and honey. This was exactly what the sauce needed to make it complex, 3D and delicious! I ran out of the sauce too- should've doubled it for leftovers. Served it with roasted vegetables and simple twice stuffed potatoes, so as not to compete with the flavor of the tenderloin and sauce. I will definitely make this again!
