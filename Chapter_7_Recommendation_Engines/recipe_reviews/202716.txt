This was excellent.  I made a few tweaks that I think contributed to the success.  In addition to the onion and celery, I sauteed two hatch chiles (could use anaheim peppers) to give a little heat / flavor.  I used 2% milk instead of half-and-half -- there is enough fat content already, and the flour creates all the thickness necessary.  I then used 3 cups of chicken stock instead of the 1/3 diluted ratio suggested, which reduces the amount of salt needed but adds a lot of flavor.  I used two large roast chicken breasts for the chicken.  For the hot sauce, Frank's is a must for authenticity, though it is not particularly hot, so 1/2 cup was about right for me.  I would also advise that you wait until the soup is essentially 100% done before adding hte cheese, and then add it in small batches so that it melts in evenly.  All in all an excellent soup and one I will make again.

My husband and I loved this soup.  I forgot to buy celery, but didn't miss it.  I used leftover chicken from the Spicy Rapid Roast Chicken from this sight, which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  It was easy and outstanding.  I got two great meals from a $4 chicken.  If you like buffalo wings, you'll really like this soup.  Try it with a salad and the dressing you usually like on your wings--ranch or blue cheese.  Enjoy!

When my husband said, "this actually really does taste like a buffalo chicken wings" I knew we had a 5 star recipe.  I wanted to add carrots (but mine were gone bad) because I think that will only add to the complete buffalo chicken wing experience, so I definitely would add a carrot or 2 next time.  Also, top the soup with a little crumbled blue cheese for even more authenticity.  Other than that, the recipe is perfect in it's ratios.  Yum!

Yummy.  Needed a little garlic powder, but that's it.  Used 2 cans low sodium chicken broth in lieu of boullion/water and then a bit of boullion granules for extra chicken flavor. Used leftover Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken from this site.  Added a bit more buffalo sauce too. Yum Yum Yum.  if you're a buffalo lover -- this is a great way to go!

If you like wings, this is a good recipe. I grew tired of it quickly, and found it needed more "chunks of something else" in there to keep it interesting.

This recipe was a big hit!  I made it on a whim after a search for what to do with some leftover chicken I had.  It tastes like slightly spicy cream of chicken soup.  The only changes I made were to boil my (bone in, skinless) chicken breasts and then use the strained boiling water instead of using plain water and a bouillon cube.  Looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today!

Even better the next day! This soup only gets better as the flavors infuse with each other. When making it, I find blending the flour with the half&half before adding to the pot keeps it from clumping. We also like to use Pepper-Jack cheese in place of the cheddar for added spice and occasionally dropping a little crumbled blue cheese on top of a bowlful for the full "wing" experience.

Absolutely loved this soup...taste just like deconstructed buffalo chicken.  Only made two minor changes...use 1/3 cup Franks instead of 1/4 cup (we like spicy).  Lastly garnished soup with blue cheese crumbles.  This recipe was simple to make...it is a keeper.

I loved this. We made it gluten free by skipping the roux and adding some cornstarch to the dissolved milk, which I used instead of cream. I cooked the onions, celery and a couple cloves of garlic in olive oil. I used chicken broth because I had it on hand. I used a combo of NY Style Extra sharp cheddar and a four cheese mexican blend. Both shredded. Like others have said, if you like chicken wings you'll love this. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

My husband, who is very critical of any cooking (because its not like his "moms") Told me after I made this for him that it was "phenomenal"! Wow, it only took 10 yrs of cooking to get that outta him. This soup is quite tasty, I will say it does not look appealing as it cooks! I did sub in 1% milk, who needs the fat from half/half, added a little more cheese, used chix broth instead of boulion water and sifted in more flour towards the end to thicken it more. Very good:)

My new favorite soup! Added a dash of celery salt and upped the Frank's Red Hot to 1/2 cup. Used skim milk in place of half and half and 1/2 the water, still very rich and creamy!

This soup was really good. The only changes I made due to what I had on hand was: used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, and used Velveeta instead of cheddar, but I think it would be better with Cheddar. Yum!

I enjoyed this soup so much I made it twice in one week. I made some changes based on other reviews--instead of water/bouillon I used 3 cups of chicken stock, increased the buffalo sauce to 1/3 cup, added 1 cup of cream of tomato soup (I bought prepared soup in a carton), a dash of garlic powder, and about 1/2 a can of corn. I also shredded the chicken instead of cubing, just a personal preference. There was no need for salt or pepper. It was delicious!! My hubby liked it despite the celery (one of his least favorite things). We garnished it with blue cheese and chopped cherry tomatoes, and served with warm ciabatta bread. A keeper!

One of the tastiest soups ever! I used nonfat milk instead of half and half and rendered bacon fat instead of butter. I tossed the cheese with cornstarch before adding it to prevent clumping. I also added a potato, garlic, shallots, and some Worchestershire. I served with celery sticks (cute but unnecessary) and blue cheese crumbles (a must).

I made this just as the recipe suggested and it was awesome. I wasn't sure what buffalo wing sause it was talking about, but i used 1/2 packet of McCormmicks buffalo wing mix. I added a dollop of sour cream on top and it was even better. I added a little more cheese to mine as well.

I'm surprised this doesn't have more reviews. I left out the celery, because I hate the stuff. And oregano is suitable spice to add in with your salt and pepper. This is a very good base, loved the kick from the buffalo sauce. I will use it again, and maybe add some brocolli or potatoes. It really is wonderful.

Awesome soup! I ended up using 1-1/3 cup milk, 2-2/3 cup chicken broth and light velveeta. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of hot sauce for an extra kick, along w/ some garlic powder. It had great flavor, nice spice and was very creamy and comforting. If you like anything buffalo chicken, like we do, then this soup will be a hit at your house as well! I will be making this soup often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I pureed the chicken but not the vegetables and I used yogurt instead of heavy cream.  Other than that, I made as written.  Great idea for soup.

I was surprised that the cheese melted smoothly.  I did use less than called for.  I boiled frozen chicken breasts and used that broth instead of water in the soup.  Next time I will add the bouillon last after a taste test.  I also think I might like it better if I blended everything before adding the chicken.

Everyone really liked this recipe, but when I make it next time I won't put in extra hot sauce as other reviewers noted.  It was way too spicy for me - it actually was hard to finish a complete bowl of it.  BUT this is my personal preference as I really don't like things too spicy.  I think if you follow the recipe as written it should be fine.

Really good--both my husband and I liked this soup, which says a lot! :) I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only change I made was adding more buffalo sauce--about 3/4 cup total, since both my husband and I enjoy spicy foods. I didn't season the soup with salt and pepper, but it was still delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a soup bar at work and it was the first one gone.  Just the right blend of creamy and spicy all wrapped together in a blanket of comfort food goodness.  I liked the reviews that suggested adding a few carrots for texture and the idea of pepper jack instead of cheddar, but I wasn't perfectly happy with the consistency so I added a can of cream of chicken soup I had in the cupboard and that was just right.

Just what I was hoping for.  I followed the directions with just two changes.  I used all chicken broth instead of any water, and I added about 2-3 oz of whipped cream cheese.  I was hoping for something like the buffalo chicken dip we all love, and this was it.  Served it with toasted pita triangles, and the family loved it.

This is good.   Like others, I bypassed the half n half and used 2% milk at chicken broth.   Because I live in Buffalo, I have expectations.   I used Franks's wing sauce (Frank's is a MUST when making authentic wings and I used a half cup instead of a quarter.  I like my wings very hot.  

I was only going to give this 4 stars, but I'm eating it while reviewing and it definitly gets tastier after a couple spoonfuls and the heat kicks in.    

Very simple recipe that I think I will make a few times this winter.

This is one of those great recipes you can tweak to meet your taste. I like to put bleu cheese crumbles on top when serving. It's also easy to adapt to the crockpot. I cook the chicken in the crockpot with broth, then shred it and add celery, minced onion, garlic, hot sauce and chopped carrots. I usually add the dairy stuff at the end.

I could have eaten 4 bowls of this soup!!  So good!!  We grilled the chicken so it was extra flavorful - also added corn which gave it a nice texture.  Highly recommend - even my 6 year old son loved it!

This soup was delicious! It was also quick and easy to make. I followed all the instructions except that I had no bouillon so I used chicken broth instead. I used 2 cups of broth and one cup of water. I also used 1/2 cup of creamed tomato soup and 1/3 cup of buffalo wing sauce. I topped it off with crumbled bleu cheese. A hearty meal in a toasty bread bowl for a chilly evening.

We loved it!  I added one large (finely chopped) carrot, used thighs instead of breasts, and one percent milk with some heavy cream, just because that's what I had on hand.  DELish!

I used whole milk instead of half and half, and canned chicken. It came out great. My husband and I really liked it a lot. I only give 5 stars to extraordinary dishes, but I would give this a 4.5 if I could.

I followed everything on this recipe except I used low sodium chicken broth instead of the water and chicken bouillon.  I also added potatoes to make it a little more heartier.  It was delicious and so easy!  Even my 19 yr old son told me it was really good

I've made this twice, one time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I made some changes. The soup can feel very thin and sparse, so the second time around I added some spiralized carrots and a 1/2 tsp of corn starch to thicken the broth. It is very good.

I haven't  even attempted to make a different recipe  due to this being so delecious. The only change I made was about 1 dozen baby carrots chopped . I like spicy food however 2 cups of hot sauce was too much. Kids couldn't enjoy all of the flavor.

My family loved it.  18 yr old son said it’s his new favorite soup.  I will definitely be making this again.

I used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon.  I used fresh pulled/cut rotisserie chicken — made for tender and flavorful chicken in the soup.

This is very good! Easy, versatile, and even better on day two! 

I made a couple of changes but they didn't affect the integrity of the soup itself. I added one green pepper, one red pepper, and two jalapenos because my garden is bonkers. The jalapeno helped add some spice which we like. Doubled the wing sauce for some extra flavor.  I also added some carrots and potatoes because they were in the fridge and I needed to use them up. Probably won’t use potatoes again, though.

Made a few changes and I will definitely be making this over and over again! Added 1/2c. diced carrots and 1/2c. Franks Red Hot sauce, I like spicy! Also added chicken stock in place of the bouillon and water, about 4c. and the consistency is perfect!

Made many times. Super easy and delicious. I added a cup of wing sauce bc I felt it didn’t have much buffalo flavor with just 1/4 cup. I used franks wing sauce, it’s the best and has the most classic buffalo flavor without being too hot

Excellent soup if you like a spicy bite, as I do! I added a little extra buffalo sauce and used a Mexican four-cheese blend. I'll top the next bowl with some crumbled blue cheese, as a reviewer suggested. I'll definitely make this one again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my family tonight and it was a big hit. Per suggestions, I doubled the hot sauce (used Franks Red Hot) and used chicken stock rather than water and bullion. I also used 2% milk instead of half and half. It was super delicious. I wish I had doubled the recipe so I could have some to take for lunch tomorrow!

I also tweaked this recipe and it was the best buffalo chicken soup I've ever had. I added some banana peppers bacon and a little ranch. I substituted the buillon with chicken stock and I did half cup milk and half cup heavy cream.  I cooked the chicken in the chicken stock and shredded it instead of cubed chicken. Very delicious!

The only changes I made to this recipe were using Chicken Stock instead of water/bouillon, and adding more hot sauce.  

This recipe is delicious, and I make it once a week!

This recipe is a good base to start with.   However,  in lieu of the water I use chicken stock or broth.  I also add 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of celery soup, 2 tbsp sour cream, and 1/2 to 1 cup of homemade ranch dressing. These modifications make all the difference in the world!

I needed to use up some 2% milk so I used that instead of 1/2 and 1/2. This has an amazing flavor. I chopped up green onions & cilantro to see if adding this would improve it but I added it separately to try each in a cup. Don't bother. It is great by itself. I will be serving this next week in a competition. I'm gonna serve it with cornbread.

To lighten it up I used 2 1/2 tbsp. of butter instead of 4, 1 cup of 2% milk + 2 1/2(ish) cups of water, and 1/2 block of light cream cheese. I also used about 1/2 the shredded cheddar (the 2% version). Also, instead of adding buffalo sauce I used two cans of diced chicken IN buffalo sauce. It turned out exactly like I hoped!!! Perfect winter dish.

Really good soup. I think next time I will top it with some crumbled blue cheese to kick it up a notch. Would have gave it 5 stars but didn't serve 8 only got 3 bowls and followed recipe exactly. The soup was great though. Thank you for the recipe.

This was delicious. I made this for a group of women who all loved it.  I made exactly as recipe read.  Next time I will cut down on the calories and use milk. I also used rotisserie chicken cut up.

Yum! Added carrot and a little fresh thyme. We ate some as a chunky soup and blended the other half, both textures were delicious.

Very good, quick and easy!  Make sure and use a wing sauce you love, as it's the key to a great soup.  I liked the idea of blue cheese crumbles and chilies from other posters, but I'll need to wait for next time as this batch is gone already :)

1% milk instead of half and half. Two 14 oz cans chicken broth instead of water/bullion. I found 1/4 cup Franks to be just the right amount. Excellent soup with just a hint of "buffalo."

This was very good. I also added a large clove of garlic, chicken broth instead of water and bouillon, increased the hot sauce to 1/3 cup and used Purdue short cuts grilled chicken. I also used an immersion blender. Very good recipe. Thanks.

This is the best soup I've made! Only made a few changes: I added two carrots, 1/3 cup buffalo sauce, a dash of habanero hot sauce, oregano, and garlic powder. Ah-mazing! I also made it in my crock pot!

This was sooo yummy and you can't help but have seconds! To make it lower fat I subbed the cream for 2% milk and used shredded cheddar made from 2% milk. I also added some chopped carrots to give it some more vegetables. The only slightly negative thing I could say is, it realistically makes 4/5 servings, not 8 as stated. I made this twice this week! Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!

Fantastic recipe.  I modified it by using low salt chicken stock, added carrots, garlic, fresh black pepper, Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo sauce, Frank's Red Hot sauce and salt to taste.  Thanks to the original poster,  you are my hero!

This is a great easy soup. Only changes made were from suggestions from others which were to saute a clove of garlic with the onion,instead of water and bouillon I used chicken stock and used 1/2 c wing sauce versus the 1/4 cup. My husband and I both loved the soup. I plan on making it again soon. Will need to double the receipe if I it make it for family or friends as it only made 4 servings.

Really good but tweeked it just a little.  Added some garlic, about a tablespoon of blue cheese dressing and spinkled some tortilla strips on top just before serving!  Definitely a keeper.

Excellent.  Making the roux smooth is the only part that's not super easy for me but it's so worth it.  I omit the celery and also found it is just as delicious without cheese.  Also I use fat free half n half.  Definitely serve with a loaf of fresh baked bread (like take and bake from the store) to dip in it!  It is in our rotation of favorites.  Everyone loves it.  Thank you for the recipe!

This soup was great.  I did not alter the recipe at all and it was delicious!  I made a double batch and it was a great hit at a Football tailgating party.

This was awesome. I used powder instead of the onion and celery, chicken stock instead of the cube and water, and I added ranch and goat cheese. So scrumptious.

I followed the recipe and really enjoyed this soup a lot. The only thing I found to complain about was the serving sizes. Recipe said makes four, but if you want a whole bowl it only made about two and a halve to three servings. I'm thinking I might add broccoli or cauliflower to it next time and see how that taste. This recipe is going in my keeper file. Thanks for a fast and easy recipe. Andrea

Amazing! My husband says its the best dish I've ever made (this is a stretch but as a wing lover I can appreciate). Modifications I made include adding sautéed mushrooms, pre cooked in hot sauce, as well as pre-cooking the chicken in hot sauce as well. Also added a dollop of sour cream and some green onions. Serve up with garlic toast for a phenomenal quick and easy dinner.

AMAZING!!! BUT I followed other reviewers' lead and used chicken stock instead of water and bullion. I also used 1.5% milk and added about 1/3c. fat free ranch dressing. By adding lowfat shredded cheddar, I felt better about it:) I also rubbed the chicken with garlic powder and seasoned salt before I cooked it to add a little more flavor. Dish it out and serve with blue cheese crumbles- yuummmm. It was perfect! I doubled the recipe for a family of six and everyone had seconds... it was gone. Which was a shame, because at about midnight I wanted more!

Highly recommended-- however, I find the recipe a bit boring as is. I always add chopped carrots and canned corn along with the celery and onion for a heartier soup.

This is absolutely awesome!  I am a soup lover anyway, and honestly I can drink Texas Pete Hot Wing sauce straight from the jar.  So my only change was instead of just hot sauce, I just kept pouring Texas Pete Hot Wing Sauce until I was satisfied with the flavor.  Probably between 1/2-3/4 cups.  I could eat this a few times a week!

This was outstanding. I did use 3cups of chicken broth instead of water and bullion. Also instead of 3/4 cream, I use 1/3 cream and 1/3 cup nonfat sour cream. Like another reviewer I upped the buffalo wing sauce to 1/2 cup. This will be a regular in my house. Might try over egg noodles to make a dinner.

What a fun, comfort soup!  I was very skeptical before preparing, and thus pared the recipe down to two servings.  To my surprise, it was better than I had hoped for.  I really like the buffalo wing flavor, but don't enjoy eating wings so this fit the bill perfectly! I used a chicken breast that I freshly grilled, substituted the water/bullion for chicken broth and added extra Frank's and extra celery.  It was very flavorful and rich.  I am sure I will make this recipe again as it is a great soup for a cold day, but think I'll scale back the servings.  Because of the flavor and high fat/caloric content one or two bowls per batch suffice.

Nice recipe to start with. We added garlic, and used Buffalo Wing flavored chicken meatballs that were cooked and quartered. I could see adding potatoes, carrots, even broccoli or cauliflower to "flesh" it out. We all liked it at our house … made it with my daughter who's nuts about wings … she liked making it and even more so, eating it. I think we'll be making this again … guessing it would go great with a cold Labatt's Blue, too ...

Delicious as is. Spruce it up and it's outstanding. 

First, add a carrot or two to the celery and onions. Now you have the trilogy of soup ingredients.  Make sure you cook the veggies long enough to soften the carrots. I also added some garlic, too. 

When adding the meat, also throw in a can of Rotel tomatoes. Increase Franks to one cup. 

Add cheese at the end, and sprinkle with blue cheese when served. 

I substituted left over smoked turkey from Thanksgiving in one batch. Great stuff.

This was awesome! Best soup ever. I used hooters hot hot wing sauce. And shredded chicken. I did wait until broth thickened from roux before adding cheese or chicken. I also used carrots and celery seed and the onion as we don't like cooked celery. Will Mae again and share this recipe with many friends! I would give it 10 stars if I could!

I love buffalo chicken (wings) so I knew I was going to love this recipe. It's nice and thick, with a good kick of buffalo (we like ours spicy in this house!). I used rotisserie chicken (always looking to shave off time in the kitchen) and added a little extra half and half for a more creamy soup. I also used a full bag of cheddar cheese (2 cups) which made it even more delicious in my opinion.

Smelled and tasted great. We added extra chicken bouillon instead of adding salt and a bit of crumbled blue cheese, as well (Buffalo thing). We may add some diced potatoes next time. My daughter was craving this soup, so thanks for the recipe!

Did adjust to serve 12 (although I only used the original amount of shredded cheese & made up with 4 oz of cream cheese) and used a can of evap. milk instead of cream. Served in bread bowls from this site.  Perfect!

I thought this recipe was great!  Taste just like a wing!  I did add carrots and use chicken broth instead of boullion, only because I didn't have any on hand, and used more wing sauce to try and spice it up.  I think I'll try a hotter version of Franks, only because I thought it lacked heat.  All this being said, a great recipe and definitely in my winter soup rotation.  Can't wait for leftovers at lunch tomorrow! YUMMM!!!!

So yummy!!  Second time I made this in 2 weeks.  My very picky husband can't get enough of it.  The only thing I changed was I used chicken broth instead of water and bouillon.  And I added more wing sauce because we lot our wings on the hotter side.

i have made this many of times now! its one the family menu. great for these cold New England days. But i did make some tweaks. I use olive oil instead of butter to save on some calories. and i also use 1/4 texas pete buffalo and 1/4 of franks hot buffalo. and i like the crunchies so i dont soften the celery too much and add some extra! plain grilled chicken goes great and saves some calories also! if im in a rush the Purdue grilled chicken already cut is perfect i just dice the strips up a little more and walah! fast meal!!!

I tasted and then doubled the franks red hot sauce because I like a lot of spice.  I also used sharp cheddar because it was all I had on hand.  Excellent recipe even if you don't change a thing.

I've never really cooked before, so this was the first recipe I wanted to try. IT WAS FANTASTIC! It's super creamy and delicious and easy to make. I highly recommend it!

This is just like the soup we get at a restaurant we go to weekly. It is so good. I made it today and there is only enough left for lunch tomorrow. I added a lot more chicken than called for but I wanted to make it more of a meal... next time I will cut back as my husband would prefer more broth. Thanks for the recipe!
