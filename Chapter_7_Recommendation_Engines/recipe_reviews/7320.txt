Great cake!  I just didn't like the glaze - I would definitely make this cake again, just using a powdered sugar glaze instead.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is just like my grandmother's cake with a few exceptions - her recipe calls for crisco instead of butter, buttermilk in place of the milk, more coconut extract (a tablespoon), and no nuts in the glaze. Instead, you poke holes all in the cake with a toothpick and pour the glaze on top of the cake so that as much of the glaze as possible is absorbed into the cake instead of sitting on the botth of the dish - doing it this way makes the cake supermoist and flavorful!  Excellent!!

Yum! This cake is even better the day after it's baked. The crunchiness that the glaze adds is unexpected, but welcome. Definitely a keeper. My only suggestion would be to add a little more coconut extract to the batter.

GREAT cake! I did make some modifications to the glaze. 1/4 c. coconut rum 2 T. Butter 1 c. sugar Pour half of the glaze back into the bundt pan, put the cake back in the pan.  Pour the remaining glaze over the bottom and sides of the cake.  Let the cake sit in the pan for fifteen minutes or so to let the glaze soak in...invert on serving plate and VOILA....perfectly glazed cake without a ton of excess on the serving platter!

This was my very first attempt at making a pound cake and I think I chose a great recipe to start off with. This cake was enjoyed by my entire family.The walnuts, after cooking in the sugar, taste amazing by themselves and on top of the cake,,,,Homerun!!! Thanks for sharing.

This is a wonderful recipe. It was very easy to make and had a great flavor. It was very popular at our New Years party. It went very well with coconut gelato.

Based on other reviews, I increased the coconut extract to 2 teaspoons and doubled the flaked coconut which I had pulsed in my food processor. It turned out incredibly delicious with nice texture. Thanks, Janie.

Amazing!  I made cupcakes for our canoe club & now I'm asked to bring these every time!  I used fresh grated coconut & doubled the amount.  I also left the chopped walnuts out of the glaze.  I have made them with & without the glaze & they are loved either way.  If you love coconut, you will LOVE this recipe!!!!!

As far as taste goes, this is a 5 star cake.  But there are a couple of things I will change if I make it again.  The glaze is excellent, but more of it ended up on the cake plate and in the "hole" in the center, so I would definitely make in a couple of loaf pans next time to avoid losing so much of the glaze.  Also, the cake turned out too brown, although I followed the instructions exactly.  It was moist and yummy, but I would try some of the other suggestions if I made again, such as using coconut milk.  Also, how much coconut is 3 1/2 ounces??  I used 1 cup.  A better measurement would have been appreciated.

I stress bake so these days I cook a lot. But usually after liking the spoon or beaters I leave the finished product alone. But this cake is haunting me. I could eat half of it in one sitting and not even bat an eyelash. I gave it for stars just because I will change a few things nest time. It could be a tiny bit moister for me but I did only have skim milk to use which didn't help. So next time I might add some sour cream or coconut cream to the batter or use coconut milk instead of milk. And the glaze worked great but next time I will put it on a rack and pour over. I put it on the plate and the glaze went everywhere and it wound up sitting in a pool of sticky glaze that went everywhere!! Live and learn. But this was an amazing from scratch cake. I have a white cake that you make into a coconut cake I think I like this better.

So moist and delicious! I substituted coconut milk, as another reviewer suggested, and added a tiny bit of salt. I didn't have anything to measure the 3.5 oz of shredded coconut so I used a 1/2 cup in the batter. Made cupcakes with them and used a coconut cream cheese frosting. Oh man, I'm in love. Yay- a new favorite!

I did not care for this at all.  It may have been me more than the cake.  This made me realize that, although I love pound cake, when it comes to coconut I really like the regular cake version better.

Followed the recipe exactly but this cake did not turn out well.  It had a rubbery quality and unfortunately could not even serve it for my Christmas brunch.  Not sure what could have gone wrong.

I followed the recipe exactly, and should have read the reviews first. There wasn't as much of the coconut taste as I would have liked. Mine also came out somewhat hard on the outside, and was crumbly.

This recipe makes a solid, moist pound cake. I doubled the extract because I really like the taste of coconut. The cake tastes even better the next day (if you have the patience to wait that long). It is the first pound cake I've made by myself and it turned out excellent!

This is a great and easy recipe, I did some alterations and it came out super delicious, instead of regular milk I used coconut milk that comes in a can, also I cooked it at 335 F for the one hour. I like it better without the glaze, glaze was too sweet.

I will not make this cake again. I like my pound cakes to be bigger. 2 cups of flour is just not enough this cake does not really make for presentation. Other than that it tasted good with modifications of 1 cup of coconut in the batter and like others 2 tsps of coconut extract in the glaze.

I made this for my brother's birthday cake a couple of years back since he loved this coconut cake our great aunt used to make. Since then, I've been forced to make this for multiple birthdays, bake sales, picnics, weddings, and showers. It's delicious! I don't put the walnuts in the glaze though and when I pour the glaze over the cake, I usually poke holes in it so it seeps through and adds flavor. I've also made this a few times as little cupcakes and added a little cinnamon to the batter, they turn out great and great for bake sales (sold out in a matter of minutes!)

Soooo nailed this cake!! And just like another reviewer mentioned, it tastes even better the day after because of the crunchiness of the glaze. I had to scale down the ingredients because I made it in a 9x5 loaf pan but I followed the recipe to the letter, and it yielded a tasty, moist, sweet cake that lasted about a week in my home. I definitely will save this on and bake again.

I used lime zest and bacardi 151 as flavoring, and it was gone by the time lunch was over at work!  Also, glazed with confectioner's sugar glaze with lime juice, zest, and bacardi.  Can use lime curd as a filling, too.   Love this recipe.  Can be adapted for lots of variety.

I love this recipe!  It;s not difficult to make, it is moist and very delicious.  I used half and half for the milk and added Vanilla rather than the coconut...did not have on hand and have not bothered buying any.  I have made this cake more than four times and my family loves it. Thank you.

Excellent!  I made this yesterday in loaf pans.  I made four loafs and they are gone!  I gave them away to family for the holiday and everyone loves it!  I didn't have coconut extract so I used vanilla instead and it turned out great. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I MADE THIS CAKE AND SPLIT THE RECIPE INTO SMALL CAKES AND A LOAF TIN. I CUT THE CAKE THAT WAS IN THE LOAF TIN IN HALF AND GAVE IT TO MY INLAWS. MY MUM IN LAW ATE ALL THAT WAS SENT IN ONE NIGHT AND THE FATHER IN LAW, WELL HE GOT NONE. AS GOOD AS HER MUM USED TO MAKE AND THE REST OF THE CAKE WELL THERE WASNT ANY LEFT SO YOU CAN TELL HOW GOOD IT WAS. I SUBSTITUTED SHREDDED COCONUT FOR DESICCATED WHICH MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE AND I DIDNT USE THE GLAZE. ALSO SUBSTITUTE COCONUT EXTRACT FOR VANILLA.

I'm not too impressed with this cake. I wanted a pound cake, and the texture of this doesn't qualify as that type of cake in my opinion. It doesn't taste bad, but I wouldn't call it good, and a waste of expensive ingredients that could have been used in something better. I bake regularly and don't feel like there was error on my part.

Scrumptious!  I made this for my mom's birthday and everyone raved about it!  The pound cake was moist and just the right density.  The crisp outside was a wonderful surprise.  Awesome recipe!
Every year my mom requests a coconut cake for her birthday.  Usually I make some kind of layered coconut cake with frosting.  This year I wanted something different so I tried this recipe.  I'm so glad I did!  We are going to make this again and again and again!
Thanks to all the reviewers who suggested adding a little more coconut extract.  We love coconut so I doubled the amount in the cake and in the glaze.  Then I toasted some coconut and sprinkled it on top when the glaze was still warm.  I left it overnight and served it the next day since many said it was better the next day.  I also put the coconut into the food processor before adding it to the cake and I substituted buttermilk for the milk because we love our pound cakes heavy.  YUM!  I'm looking forward to tying different things with this recipe - like adding pineapple.

Absolutely amazing!!!  I made this into cupcakes and substituted roasted coconut juice for the milk in the cake.  I also frosted them with a coconut buttercream.  Defiantely the best cake I have made so far.  Incredibly moist!  Will be making it again as a birthday cake in a few weeks.

Really delicious cake.  The only change I made was to use vanilla instead of coconut extract.  I might try rum flavoring the next time.  I served it to a group of women and needed to give out the recipe to them.  It was a very moist cake.

This is a beautiful recipe! I used olive oil instead of butter and powdered coconut instead of flaked. It had an incredible texture and was gone before I could take it out of the pan! Best served warm with a glass of milk. It's so yummy it didn't even need frosting.

I was concerned with this recipe, at first. I made it in a bundt pan so that I could half it and use it as a base for my daughters bunny cake. It was really hard to get out of the pan, and the half I left sitting out overnight was like a rock in the morning. I worried about what was beneath our bunny cake. But everyone raved over this cake, the cake itself not just the novelty of it. The family requested the recipe so it was a hit over here.

I made this for my wife and father-in-law. They both said "this is a keeper"; we all loved it. After reading other reviews, I increased the coconut extract to three teaspoons in the cake and to one and a half teaspoons in the glaze. I added ten minutes to the cooking time.  Also, I browned 1/2 cup coconut in the oven broiler, then sprinkled it on top of the glaze after spreading the glaze on the cake. Thanks, Janie, "It's oh so good!"

Im on the fence with this one.  Its not bad, but its not great.  I doubled the amount of coconut extract and flaked coconut, but I think it needs more than that. The first bite has a mild coconut flavor, but after that its less noticeable.

If I make this again, I would replace the milk with some sort of coconut milk. I think I would also add some coconut rum.

Though I will make again, I will not make exactly as the recipe states. This did not taste even remotely coconuty and I added 3-4 times more coconut flakes and twice as much coconut extract. I think I need to substitute the regular milk for lite coconut milk an hopefully that will bring out the coconut flavor. The texture was good and the flavor overall (minus the lack of coconut flavor) was good as well. Will double the recipe next time as this barely made anything! Also, real eggs are not needed to make this nor most any baked goods. I always use Energy Egg replacer and my baked goods turn out wonderfully!

This was ok.  It wasn't as dense as a pound cake.  It was still pretty tasty though.  I didn't use the glaze.

A winner!  I used coconut milk instead of regular milk and added an extra 1/2 tsp of coconut extract.  I prefer a plain cake so I didn't bother with the glaze.

Very crumbly, not very pretty and  flavor was just ok.
