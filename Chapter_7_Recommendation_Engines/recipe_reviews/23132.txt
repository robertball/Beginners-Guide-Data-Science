I picked this recipe because it seemed simple and it included similar ingredients from the Caribbean sweet potato salad that I also made. Once I cooked everythinng, I was a little intimadated bc it seemed an odd combination, but, suprisingly--it was very delicious--esp if you love avocados, as I do.

Good light pasta dish!  
I left out the vegetarian chili, added a cup of frozen corn to the cooking pasta, substituted bowtie pasta for the spaghetti and topped  the dish with feta cheese.  My picky husband and daughter both liked it.

We really enjoyed this dish, and it was so quick and easy to make. I used bowtie pasta instead of angel hair & regular white onion instead of green onion, and we agreed to try it next time using turkey chili to give it more of a kick. Overall very satisfied!

Not bad, but needed a little something more.  I liked adding salsa for a bit more flavor.  I would make this again but include some changes.  Cheese would add a nice touch

Although this was interesting and extremely healthy, it wasn't a total hit.  I love avocado, so this left me somewhat satisfied, but did little for anyone else.  Also, it was a lot of chopping and effort for something that I could only give 3 stars.

This actually isn't too bad.  I heated up the chili and tomato bc I just didn't want to eat that cold.  I forgot the garlic, though, which is completely uncharacteristic of me.  I must be tired!  I don't have green onions, so I omitted.  Needed a bit of salt and pepper, but not a bad dish.  I was a bit surprised I liked it, as I just wasn't too sure about it.  Thanks!

This was pretty good, but next time I make it I think I'll omit the chili.  Every time I bit into a cold bean it made me a bit nauseous.  Also, the market I went to didn't have vegetarian chili, so the pasta did have some meat in there.  Still,  I got the gist of it.  Next time, no chili for me!  And more avocado, yummy!

was looking for a way to use up my avocados. This recipe sounded odd, and even while making it was a bit skeptical. But wow, turned out amazing! made it with whole wheat penne to make it a lil healthier.... mmm mmm good! and was even better the next day, next time will add a few things, like olives, some corn, maybe some pepperjack cheese, and definitely some sour cream. Definitely worth a try!

Made this and was really disappointed. Not enough flavor. Had to heat chili cause could not imagine eating that cold and it still wasn’t good warm. Might be a good dish with seasoned taco meat,  rotel tomatoes and cheese but definitely would not make this again as listed in recipe. Also too much cilantro and the avocado and lime didn’t do anything for it. The dish actually took away from the awesomeness of avocado and lime.

I made the dish w/o adding the vegetarian chili beans and it was very tasty.  I thought that a whole can of Chili Beans would make it overwhelmingly taste like the Chili. However, I would use a half a cup of rinsed black beans instead and add some chili powder (~1 TBlsp) or maybe dice a single jalapeno for more zip.

I made this as a cold side dish because I had leftover spaghetti in the fridge. I subbed in a little picante sauce for the vegetarian chili. It turned out to be a great pasta salad for a warm summer day.

This was kind of odd to me. I love avocado and tomato but I wouldn't combine it like this again. I didn't use all of the chili and to be quite honest, my first impression was that the mixture smelled like dog food. But, it tasted better than I expected.
