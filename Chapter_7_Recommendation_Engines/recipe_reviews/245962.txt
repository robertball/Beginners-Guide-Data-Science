These quesadillas were very delicious. Quick & easy and not a lot of clean up. The only addition I made was to add about a half can of black beans (drained and rinsed). We served them with sour cream salsa and guacamole. My husband went for seconds and talked about additional ways we could make this. I will definitely make this again!

We added about 3/4 lb of cooked chicken and half a can of black beans and it was a well rounded meal. We only had cheddar so that's what cheese we used. Really good!

This was OK. I served this with a small amount of sour cream and homemade guacamole
