Nice, quick & easy pie. I could have eaten the whole thing at once! I almost passed it by because other reviews said it didn't set. I had no trouble at all with the sauce setting. Be sure to heat the sauce over medium heat until it thickens in the pan while stirring constantly. Mine took about 4 minutes. Thank you - Love this pie!

Where do I begin with this recipe?  You cannot strain raspberries through a fine mesh sieve and get any type of mashed berry left over.  You will get amazing tasting runny berry juice, but the fiber and the seeds will be left over.  Go ahead and add an extra tablespoon of cornstarch.  That's what I had to do the THIRD time I tried to make this pie and I left it on the burner for an additional five minutes or so to get it to thicken up.  Also, you should double the amount of sauce/filling that the recipe calls for unless you want a lot of fairly dry berries.  See how many dry berries there are in the photo above?  That will be you.  As others have said, you will also need more berries for a 9" pan.  I gave this three stars for the number of attempts I made before it came out the way it needed to for the birthday for which I was preparing it.

Delicious.  The only problem was that we didn't wait until it was cool, so it was runny, but I'm sure that would have resolved itself if we had waited.  I love the fresh raspberry taste when only a few of the berries are cooked. I used raw sugar with good results.

This worked fine. I used some substitutions because I was making it out of season. I used frozen berries instead of fresh and just used all of them in the raspberry sauce. I'd use half as many as the recipe called for next time. It also took a bit of extra time to simmer, maybe 20 minutes.

Delicious!!!  I much prefer the taste of fresh raspberries to cooked, so this suits my taste perfectly!!!  I made the sauce a couple of days ahead and stored it in the fridge until I could get more berries.  Let the sauce come back to room temp. and proceed as written.  Fast and easy!  I also put the berries for the sauce(double the amount) through a Victorio strainer before cooking it and I really liked not having the seeds in the sauce.  If you do this, double your berries so you get the same amount of juice/berries called for on the recipe.  Seeds take up about half the berry.  LOL!

I used 1/3 cup sugar rather than 1/2 cup sugar.   Absolutely delicious pie!   Everyone loves it!   I have shared it with friends and they all love it!

Best fresh raspberry pie recipe. I doubled the graham cracker crust and mixed extra butter in. It was very good.

Very good pie!  This was a great way to use some of the raspberries we picked from our garden this year.  The pie set perfectly and looked and tasted great.  Our raspberries were a little tart so I would suggest modifying the sugar based on your own tastes and the sweetness of the berries.  I used a premade shortbread crust which went very well with this flavor of pie.

Great raspberry pie recipe. I used the flaky pie crust recipe. Followed recipe except I adjusted the sugar to my preference, used less. But it came out perfect. If I wait til its chilled it sets up perfect.

Just made this for company and they were asking for the recipe.  I was generous with the raspberries using heaping cups and added a little extra sugar to compensate.  Topped pie with fresh whipped cream which made presentation a little better and was absolutely the best raspberry pie I've ever eaten.

Tres magnifique! This recipe is perfect for me. Not-too-sweet, and full of flavour. 
I did find the raspberry filling a little scanty for a 9" crust... next time I'll do an 8" pie plate to make it seem more full.

My husband asked for a raspberry pie and I chose this one to try. I used four cups of fresh raspberries from our garden, organic sugar and an organic pie crust. The sauce set up perfectly and the pie was delicious. I'll make this again.

4 stars because I followed the recipe exactly, and the sauce didn't set. The flavor of this was delicious. The sauce not setting was disappointing, but it didn't stop my husband from devouring it.
