Excellent!  My family enjoyed these  brownies.  I also used 12 tbls cocoa powder and 3 tbls  vegetable oil instead of the 4 unsweetened chocolate squares.  Search is over - this is the recipe I'll keep.

I found this recipe in a brochure from a grocery store a few years ago.  These brownies are very easy to make! Just the thing if you are looking for a fudgy brownie as opposed to a cake-y one. A word of caution: they will stick to the pan!  The original recipe calls for covering the pan with foil, leaving enough at edges to form handles.  Grease the foil generously.  It works well.

I found this on the box of my Baker's Unsweetened Chocolate and gave it a try. My family & I agree that they are delicious. As another reviewer mentioned the instructions do say to foil & grease the 9 X 13 pan, which I did & used pam with flour, and I had no problems with sticking.

I followed the  variation on the box for a more cakey brownie which was to add 1/2 cup more of flour and 1/2 cup of milk. Perfect. Will definitely make these again :)

Edit: I made these again and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, while upping the vanilla to 2 tsp and they were much better.

I didn't have any squares, so I used the 12 to 3 ratio for cocoa powder/oil.  I was also out of nuts, so I omitted them also.   I didn't have any trouble spreading the batter or getthing them out of my glass pan sprayed with PAM.  They were VERY chocolately.  I didn't bake them for 35 minutes either - more like 27 or 28, but that could have been my pan.  I just watched closely for slight pulling around the edges.

Seriously folks, if you want the definitive, last word on the subject, BEST brownie make this recipe! (Or the other, identical, "One Bowl Brownie" recipe from this site...) I know there are differences from one person to the next on what makes brownies "the best," but in my judgment no one could possibly disagree this is it unless they somehow goofed up the recipe.  Easy to mix up, rich, buttery, fudgy, chewy on the edges and just the right amount of "chocolatiness" and sweetness (some brownies are so sweet they make my teeth hurt!). As long you don't overmix or overbake these, you'll have the perfect brownie - like the kind that beckon you from bakery shelves with their beauty only these taste a whole lot better!  So make these - and top them off with "Fudge Frosting," also from this site.  (I made half the recipe, baked in a foil lined pan, 22 minutes)

I live in Russia and am always looking for simple recipes with ingredients I don’t have to carry in my suitcase from home – this one is awesome!  Several people suggested following the instructions exactly – the first time I tried substituting cocoa powder and butter for unsweetened chocolate squares (they don't have those in Russia), I also wasn’t paying attention and put the eggs in before the sugar, maybe the problem was the butter was too hot and semi-cooked the eggs?  I don’t know, but the batter was chunky and not nice at all.  I cooked them, and they tasted good, but the texture was gummy and I needed a chisel to get them out of the pan.  

The second time I followed the recipe precisely, and they were perfect.  My whole house smelled chocolatey and when I taste tested one, I ended up tasting (uh) three.  Nice and crusty on top, soft, but cooked in the middle, my second batch didn’t stick to the pan at all – I was going to try out several recipes, but I will go no further.  This is my brownie recipe – I’m sure my Russian friends will love them!  (Guess I’ll be packing unsweetened chocolate squares in my suitcase!)

These were yummy and came out perfect!  I did change a couple of things (always do) - used 3/4 cup cocoa and 1/4 canola oil whisked until smooth (no baking chocolate) and added 1/2 tsp almond extract but otherwise followed the directions.  We will definitely be making these again.  They are insanely sticky, though; I will definitely try the foil trick next time.

Oh my goodness! These are amazing brownies. I have made them three times and they are delicious every time. I used old old old Hershey's baking chocolate the first time--only half of what was ordered (because I am an idiot and cannot always read very well). I realized the problem and made an icing (cocoa-based) and they got raves by everyone at the school party. The next time I made them with Girardelli (sp?) baking chocolate and they turned out amazing again--very rich and chocolatey. The next time I used the same chocolate and added a little Kahlua-maybe 3 Tbsp and put a glaze on again. Once again, everyone loved them. These are so so easy and the one-bowl to wash up? How can you beat that?

These were the best brownies I've ever had.  My boyfriend prefers cake-like brownies, but still loved these even though they were fudge-like.  We made a few changes.  First, we didn't have any vanilla so we substituted real maple syrup to add flavor.  We also added only 1/2 the walnuts and added semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of the other 1/2.  Pinch of salt is a good idea too.

Dear Lord! I don't like brownies much, or even chocolate for that matter, and my hubby and I agree: I can never make this recipe again. Why, you ask? Because it is sooooo good that we ate half of them while they were still warm - that's why! What a simple and amazing recipe! The only things I did differently was use 200g of dark chocolate (because it was what I had on hand and I didn't want to waste any), I added a pinch of baking powder, cut the sugar by 50g and split it - 200g white and substituted the remaining 150g for brown sugar. Bellissimo!!!!

Well I just didn't like these at all; I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the nuts and reduced the cooking time by 5 minutes.  I like dense brownies, but these were more like thick brownie crackers; they were chewy and crunchy on the edges, and just plain chewy through the middle.  Thanks for the recipe, but I'll keep looking.

This is my first time making brownies with melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder - normally I would just use Best Brownies from this website, because I make them dynomite every time, but I'm moving and have used up all my cocoa, so decided to go the chocolate route.  I had to make two slight alterations because of what I had on hand: I used 1 bar of 85% organic fairtrade ecuadorian chocolate (and a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips because the bar was not quite 4 oz).  I didn't have white sugar, so I used 1.5 cups of light brown sugar instead.  Other reviewers recommended a lower amount and my chocolate was slightly sweetened.  I must say... they're probably the best brownies I have ever made.  And I bake A LOT of brownies.  This shall be my go-to recipe when I have dark chocolate on hand from now on.  I use the "tin foil" trick, except I use parchment paper instead of tin foil as it is stronger and doesn't tear as easy, I find.  Another acceptable alternative is to grease the entire pan, and then use 1-2 tbs cocoa to coat the sides - works much better than flour as you don't get any white power on your lovely dark brownies.  :)

I took the advice of other viewers and used cocoa powder instead of melting chocolate. I apparently added too much though cause it was too dark chocolate for me. However, the  family loved them and said they were just right!

These were very good. I did 1 1/2 C. white sugar and 1/4 C. brown. Also, an extra tsp. of vanilla and instead of walnuts (didn't have any) i used semi-sweet chocolate chips. And just because, i added a spoonful of Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder.

These brownies are SO EASY to make & are just wonderful!  Crispy on the outside & chewy on the inside.  I did make the following changes:

Used semi-sweet baking squares instead of unsweetened (that's what I had on hand) -- used 5oz. instead of 4oz.

Used only 1c. of sugar since chocolate was semi-sweet

Used butter flavored crisco instead of butter

Used spelt flour instead of all-purpose since I'm sensitive to wheat

Added 1/2 tsp. of kosher salt to balance the sweetness

Simply decadent!!!  Thanks for the recipe :)

This recipe came together in a matter of minutes. Very simple. I made only one change and that was using chopped pecans instead of walnuts because we do not care for walnuts. Looks like your typical brownie recipe--it's cooling now. I'll update my review once we've had a chance to try it. I plan on frosting it with the Brownie Frosting recipe, which is also from this site.

I made this for my friend for her birthday. She is such a brownie lover that I decide to make some for her from scratch. They turned out okay. It wasn't really what I was expecting. They were more cake like than the fudge like ones we were use to. I think that next time I will reduce the eggs to only two, use a 8 in square pan and bake it for 30 minutes.

I really enjoy this recipe.  I like to add twists.
1.  Peanut Butter - a personal favorite - after making the brownie batter and placing it in the pan, mix 1 tbsp melted butter, 2 tbsp sugar, and 2/3 cup peanut butter.  Then drops spoonfuls over the batter.  Use a knife to "swirl" the pb into the brownie batter by "cutting" stripes in one direction, and then switch to the other direction.  Bake as normal.

2.  Cream Cheese - husbands delight - mix 8oz of cream cheese, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1tsp vanilla.  Spoon into batter as described for PB.  Bake as normal, might need to extend baking time by 5 minutes (use toothpick test).

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe til now. I've been making these brownies and passing on this recipe for more than two years! I only use half the sugar and they are plenty sweet. These are so easy and so delicious and so easy to modify, if you feel like it.  I've made them cake like and gooey and swirled with raspberry preserves and with chocolate chunks, and even with half the butter as applesauce.

I believe this recipe is from the box of the baking chocolate.  The recipe is reliable but doesn't provide the really rich, really moist brownies that I prefer.

The brownies were hard on outside edges and totally raw inside. There was no chocolate flavor and they were honestly too sugary and greasy. I was disappointed.

Although I baked for only 30 minutes, 5 minutes less than specified (because I like my brownies slightly underdone so they maintain chewiness) these still came out dry, dry, dry. I guess I'd say they're closest in texture to a cake - an extremely overbaked cake. My oven is dead-on calibrated, (and it's turned out some incredible creations in the last couple of weeks) so that wasn't the problem. The flavor was lame on the chocolate, too. I've used the recipe from the Betty Crocker Cook Book (copyright 1970) for many years, and although it uses only shortening and not a speck of butter, the result is full of chocolatey flavor and consistently chewy and moist. I thought I'd try a new recipe, one that had stellar reviews this time. I would have thought with the butter in this one they'd be more flavorful, but boy, was I wrong! I believe the source of the problem is that in my usual recipe, which uses the same fat-to-flour ratio, it calls for FOUR eggs, not three. I cut the "brownies" up to use in a chocolate trifle, to salvage all those expensive ingredients, so that it wouldn't be a total loss. Not trying to be unkind, but I found them to be incredibly disappointing.

Up the chocolate and dash the sugar in HALF, and maybe, maybe these could be called brownies.

Wow! Nice flaky top just like the boxed mix except this was chocolatier! (even with the cocoa powder substitute I did). Next time I will try taking the sugar down a notch, maybe 1/2-1 cup less, and I will use ghirardelli chocolate chips

THE BEST!  So maybe I am strange, but have always prefered box mix brownies.  I find homemade to be dry, but in desperation for a chocolate fix and no mix on hand, I gave these a go.  No more box mix for me!  These are great--no tweaks!

These brownies were very chocolaty and not too sweet.  I substituted the butter with apple sauce and left out the nuts and they still came out really moist and delicious!  I also cut everything by 1/3 and cooked in an 8 x 8 pan for 32 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

I made these for a special event after one of my batches of box-mix brownies fell apart (I needed 2 batches). I added a couple of the modifications suggested here - adding salt and an extra dose of vanilla.  So, I had the other box-mix batch to compare them to and I have to say, the box mix was darker, fudgier, more chocolaty. I don't like using box mixes much because of all the junk added, but I'd like my brownies made from scratch to be as rich and chocolatey... any suggestions to make these richer? What if I subbed some cocoa powder for 1/2 of the flour - would that help? Any other suggestions? Chocolate syrup?

I'm always looking for a good brownie recipe.  This is perfect, and no more difficult than boxed brownies. The chocolate is very subtle and the texture is exactly what I want in a brownie - chewy/fudgy.  I baked for about 33 minutes and they were perfect. trying it today for the second time, and I'm going to try with salted butter, rather than unsalted, based on another review.

I have made these brownies now many times, and they are always delicious. A great replacement for those unhealthy boxed mixes. However, I have found that the baking time makes a huge difference! The recipe calls for 35 mins. I usually bake it for 20-25 mins. Any longer and the texture changes a lot and becomes harder, if not slightly burnt. So perhaps set the timer for 20 mins and take it from there so you don't risk over baking it? I've also found that I should only mix it just until the eggs are incorporated. Over mixing makes the brownies too dense. Lastly, I usually mix in milk chocolate chips. These brownies are a quick, delicious treat that everyone will enjoy! Even my husband who usually doesn't eat brownies keeps munching on them. Definitely add this to your recipe box.

great texture, good brownies; but they need just a little salt! I always wondered what would happen if you left the salt out of cookies or brownies, and this recipe showed me. They tasted just a tad "off", but when I sprinkled a tiny amt of salt on them, they were perfect.

These brownies are fantastic! I wanted to add a little tip I love. 5 minutes before the brownies are done baking cover the top, generously, with milk chocolate chips. Once the brownies are done pull them out of the oven and spread the melted chips. When the brownies are warm the chocolate is heavenly and when they are cooled it takes on a topping like a chocolate bar. YUMMY!

I just cut up my first batch and my 3 year old and I love them. I had the unsweetened chocolate package where the recipe cam e from. I took a comment from a review to cut out some of the sugar so I only put in 1 1/2 cups. One thing that may be confusing to some of the people who've been rating this is they may have not put in the correct amount of chocolate to balance out the sweetness or butter. The box reads that "one square" is really the 2 pieces connected, like a bar of chocolate. So to use "4" in this recipe is really using 8 individual squares. My batter was very dark brown and tasted great before I baked it. Those worrying about raw eggs should relax. It is always a good idea to taste the batter so you know what kind of flavor you'll end up with. Mine turned out likely crisp on top and nice and fudgy on the inside. I had some extra choc. chips so I carefully sprinkled them on top right before going in the oven. Adds a nice decorative touch. Also, I used both the tin foil and PAM. Worked great. I will make this again.

I have been looking for the "perfect" brownie, and this is it. I added 1 tsp. instant coffee granules to the butter/chocolate mixture and stirred until dissolved. Coffee always brings out the richness of the chocolate. Great recipe! Thanks.

this is an excellent brownie recipe, which i make ALL the time, with a few modifications: I more than double the amount of chocolate to 250gms of 62% dark chocolate (in NZ the bars are this size and it is just too much effort to measure out 200gms), decrease sugar to 1 cup white and 3/4 cup brown, decrease eggs to 2 and substitute a generous tablespoon of sour cream (i'd read that you could sub 1 tbsp yoghurt for 1 egg), increase vanilla to 2 tsp, add 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt, and leave out the nuts.  i know this is a lot of changes, but we love the result. i just tried the sour cream substitution today  (ran out of eggs) and it really added a nice subtle creamy note to the taste.  ALSO, i line the pan with baking/parchment paper and the brownies never stick, plus it's so easy to clean up.

Super Yummy!  As recommended by others, I used 12tblsp Cocoa plus 3tblsp veg oil in place of the unsweetened chocolate. Baked in 2-8inch cake pans so that I could cut as a wedge and serve with Raspberry sauce, a few fresh raspberries and sprinkled with icing sugar. Recipe is a real keeper!

Baked these for 30 minutes and wound up with lovely, soft, chewy brownies. I discovered at the last minute that I was out of all-purpose flour - substituted 100% whole wheat with, amazingly, no ill effect! They had a great texture. I also added about 3/4 cup of flaked coconut and used 6 ounces of chocolate instead of 4. This recipe is easy and flexible - definitely my go-to for brownies from now on. :)

Nice chocolate flavor but mine were dense and cake-like but somewhat dry.  I'll try again using butter and not margarine. Will probably pull them out of the oven at 30 minutes and let them finish with carry-over heat. Good recipe. Thanks bunches!

Made these for my father-in-law's birthday and they were a huge hit.  In my usual fashion I did a few substitutions/additions:
1.  I used hershey's "special dark" chocolate. (113 metric grams)
2.  Cut back on the sugar by 1/3 (sugar in bar)
3.  Added 2 tbsp cocoa for extra chocolatey goodness.
4.  Added mini semi-sweet choc chips instead of nuts.
Only cooked about 30-32 minutes.  Because of the high sugar/chocolate to flour ratio they need to cool before they are set.  Don't overcook.  Line your pan with tinfoil that goes over the ens of the pan so you can lift out when cool for nice easy cutting.  Great!

I had to hold back on my review until I tasted these.  The ease and NO MESS made it a 5 Star in my book alone.  They are delicious.  I wish I had a cookbook of recipes as good and easy as this one.  It's a winner. I will make these all the time.  I was ready to put these in the oven before the oven had preheated.  Now thats fast!

Instead of chocolate squares, I substituted 10 TBS of Cocoa and 3 TBS vegetable oil. I have previously used the 12 as stated in other reviews but thought there was too much of an after taste from the cocoa. I did not use walnuts, instead added semi-sweet chocolate chips. They were absolutely WONDERFUL! Best brownie recipe ever!!

:-(  I was looking for a quick and easy recipe for brownies because my usual recipe (Food network's Ina Garten's "outrageous brownies" recipe) is time consuming and requires more chocolate than I had on hand.  This recipe was quick and easy, but the result was not good.  The brownie's were too sweet and not very chocolatey.  Which is surprising, because I used 2oz more choclate than the recipe called for.  I definitely won't make these again.

I think this recipe is a bit off. You only need 1 cup of sugar if you're using sweetened chocoloate... even not, I think 2 cups is waaay too much. Second, you only need 2 eggs. I added some salt too, which was missing from the recipe. Used a 9x9 pan. Baked for 35 mins on 180c, could have gone longer... the brownies came out pretty fudgy in the middle, not runny by any means, but not really cooked all the way through either. I would leave them in another 10 minutes next time. Hope this helps.

So far these are my favorite homemade brownies! They are fairly easy and quick to make. :) I like adding chocolate chips because it makes them gooier. I also like adding different types of nuts.

I always sub the 12T cocoa and 3T oil - never have unsweetened chocolate on hand. These are our go-to brownies, and they're always awesome, and I can't say enough great things about them. Get in the kitchen, and make some RIGHT NOW!

This might be great, but unfortunately the directions were not explained well enough.  I made this by recipe, but it had a soup consistency.  I didn't know if I was supposed to take it out and let it cool or what?  I put a tooth pick in and it came out nearly clean.  I am very frustrated by the outcome.  All those eggs and lovely chocolate for something that cannot be eaten much less going empty handed to the school party when I promised to make something.

My husband got to make these for me several times when I was pregnant with our twins.  He uses about half the called for sugar and when they're still hot out of the oven, he puts a lid on the baking dish and they end up having a lovely, gooing top.

These are the best brownies I've ever made! I made them exactly according to recipe, except I added a generous swig of Bailey's. They took 33 minutes. I might not use as much sugar next time.

Well, I can't stop eating these. That's a sign of a delicious brownie... though they are my biggest weakness! Perfectly chewy, fudgy... and super quick to throw together. I used cocoa powder and butter in place of the unsweetened chocolate, so I mixed the cocoa powder with the flour and added the extra butter to the butter required for the recipe. Worked well. Only comment is to make sure to smooth out the top and make sure it's really even. Some brownie batters are more runny and sort of even themselves out... this one you could see my spatula marks after they were baked. Nothing some delicious ganache can't disguise! :)

great recipe. i used 12 tbs cocoa powder and 3 tbs oil in place of the chocolate, and used 1 1/2 cup white sugar and upped the vanilla to two tsp. they were still very sweet. end result is crisp crust and delicious veryyy fudgy insides. next time i will use 1 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla. 
P.S. the brownies stick like crazy even though I used foil and a generous amount of PAM. perhaps pam and flour the foil?

Pretty good! A little crunchier than I normally like so next time I'll probably pull them out at closer to 25min, even 30min was too long. I used cocoa powder & veg oil, too. They were very good, lots of requests for more already...

I have made this recipe at least 4 times and it turns out great every time! I rarely have squares of chocolate so I always use cocoa powder and vegetable oil. They are great for people who love chocolate, because they come out very chocolatey! My boyfriend loves dark chocolate and he loves these brownies!

The only recipe I ever gave one star to. They were super easy but had no chocolate flavor, and the texture was off hard on the edges and almost raw everywhere else.  I am so sad they were not even close to being good.

I was a little reluctant to try these because they seemed TOO easy, but they were so delicious. They were gooey and moist and all around it was a great brownie. It literally took me like 5 minutes to mix everything together! Will definitely be using this recipe in the future!

Awesome! Really fudgy and moist. I decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was still plenty sweet. Used 2 tsp of vanilla and the cocoa powder conversion because I didn't have enough squares. These may be my new best friend, thanks Jody!

These taste great.  I cooked in a glass pan and baked for 40 minutes, but could have baked longer.  I also greased it, but I dont think I will next time.  That may be why they seemed so wet, but these things were my fault.  The recipe itself is incredible and I will make again.  Thank you!!

I tried baking these brownies last night and followed the recipe exactly (minus the nuts) and after 55 minutes in the oven they were still not cooked all the way through while the top had formed a hard crust.  I will never use this recipe again!

I had last minute dinner guests - family in town came over for a bbq - and was searching for a quick dessert... hoping to find something tasty that included ingredients I already had on hand. These brownies were very easy, quick, and very tasty. They were a hit. I LOVE chewy brownies (not cake-spongy ones) and these were definitely chewy. Only thing I did differently was that I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate squares on hand so I substituted cocoa powder instead (the substitution is 3T cocoa powder plus 1T cooking oil for 1 square of unsweetened chocolate) and it worked perfectly. To spice things up a bit I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top when there was 5 minutes of baking time left. Very good brownies that will definitely bake again!

These brownies where good, nice basic recipe for when I am running low on ingredients and craving! I also subsituted the cocoa powder for chocolate squares (what a money saver! I wish I would have know about this before) My oven runs hot and I only cooked them for 30 minutes and it was still too long. Maybe next time just cook for 27 minutes and see how that is.

Good easy brownie. Nice and moist. Rose up like a cake, but turned out fudgy. I used self rising flour because I thought I was out of AP and didn't want to use whole wheat or bread flour for this. I found a bag of AP after I had it mixed up. This made a big pan. Overall very good, but seemed like something was missing in the flavor? Maybe that's just me as no one else here said anything. Thanks, they're good.

I made these for dessert after dinner.  I Used the cocoa and oil substitute since I didn't have chocolate. I also used half sugar and half brown sugar.  The brownies were so good the pan didn't even make it to dinner.

I found this recipe on the box of Bakers Squares unsweetened about a year ago I think.  We LOVE these, these are hands down the best brownies we've had.  It is very fudgy so I always line the pan with foil and generously grease it.  I didn't know about the cakey version until I found the recipe on here, tried it and it came out awesomely!  These are great!

Delicious!  And SO easy!  Bang goes my diet :@)
I did use a slightly smaller sized pan so had to bake for a little longer and kept checking them.  I have baked these for a friends party and added the nuts at the end on only one half of the tray (as there are a couple who dont like nuts) and I'm expecting them to get an big thumbs up from everyone, if there are any left by the time I get there of course!

WOW. Absolutely excellent! I used real butter, and a dash of milk, and added 1 more square of chocolate just because I wanted it very chocolatey. Man the moisture, consistency, EXCELLENT!!! I'm not buying the box anymore. SO EASY AND FAST!

My daughter made this 3 times in one week! It was so easy for her! They taste great and since we did use a smaller pan for thicker brownies we adjusted the time and they came out perfect!

I cut the brownies into 1.5" squares and coated them with melted dark choc! My fiance and friends loved them, some of my friends even asked for the recipe. However, I personally think that it was too sweet even though I had recuded the sugar.

I was looking for a quick brownie recipe so I tried this one, and my husband said they were the best brownies I've ever made!! I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out perfect. They are not too dry or too chewy - perfect sweetness and perfect consistency!! I will definitely make these again!!! Absolutely wonderful and super easy!!!

I got this recipe off a Bakers Unsweetened Chocolate box several years ago.  My husband made this for me once, the first (and last) time he's ever done anything that involved food preperation.  So it must extremely easy.   I've got a batch baking in the oven right now, unfortunately I copied the recipe incorrectly and I put the batter into a 9x9 pan.  I've been cooking these babies for 45 minutes now and they still are not done.  Thankfully, though, they have not begun to burn, yet.  If you do not happen to have enough unsweetened chocolate you can substitute 3 tablespoons cocoa and 1 tablespoon melted butter for each ounce needed.  Fantastic recipe.

If a recipe is easy to prepare and the taste is good..that's a good recipe to me. This was one of those. Easy to do. The brownies were not dry. They were not to 'cakey', but were chewy instead, and not gooey. Made it exactly as presented. Don't overbake, 35 min is enough time, maybe even less. Will make again.

This is it!  THE brownie recipe I have looked for!  My brownies have a shiny, crackly top layer, rich and dark, fudge like texture with just the right amount of chew!  What a pleasure it is to sink your teeth into one of these brownies.  This recipe uses minimum ingredients and the one bowl factor is nice, too. I think, after trying several different recipes - some twice!) that the absence of any leavening agent is why these brownies turned out chewy and not cake like. This is just a perfect recipe!

My just-turned-nine son made these today all by himself and they are DELICIOUS! (Followed the recipe exactly.)

(We opted to line our pan with parchment paper, rather than grease it. Worked beautifully.)

These are so rich and fudgy... the kind of treat that will satisfy a chocolate craving when nothing else quite cuts it.  I used about 1 3/4 sugar since I ran out.  SO dark and delicious!  Not a cake-like brownie***

Not my favorite recipe. They were very dry and cakey even following suggestions to prevent that like less eggs and less flour. Probabley not make again.

This is a recipe from the inside of the Baker's Unsweetened Baking Chocolate box. I had a lot on hand, so I decided to give this recipe a whirl. They were fudgy and yummy. The best part was how easy they were to make. I don't like nuts in my brownies, so I felt that they were missing a little something - especially since they're not as super-sweet as a boxed mix. Next time I'll try adding peanut butter chips or marshmallows, or spreading some kind of frosting on top.

Although they were quick, these were not they were far from my favourite brownies. I found them too sweet, and they were very thin. Although I followed the directions in the recipe exactly, they were hard around the edges and mushy in the middle. I would not make these again.

Wonderful! I added a bit of raspberry jam on top prior to baking, and the brownies came out with a delicious hint of raspberry sweetness.

These were delicious.  My family likes fudgy brownies so I followed the advice of other posts and reduce flour to 1c.  I also used 2 eggs instead of 4 and added Hershey's chocolate syrup.  I honestly expected to mess this up because I changed it up so much but they were YUMMY!!  Great for when you need that chocolate fix!!

If you want a brownie that's not too sweet and nice and fudgey then these are for you! 
I substituted the chocolate squares for 12 tbsp cocoa and 3 tbsp oil, as well I used 1 cup each of white and brown sugar. 
I didn't have a 9x13 pan, so I split the batter into two 9x9 pans and baked for 20 minutes each.

Delicious and easy! Great texture and flavor. I had some trouble getting them out of the pan so I got to snag some crumbs before serving them. I will plan to use foil or parchment paper to line the pan next time.

Most of the brownie recipes I've found were not as good as a box mix. But this one is even better than a mix! It's very simple and has an amazing texture. Very fudgey, just the way I like. I used baking cocoa and sugar in place of the squares of chocolate like a lot of people here. I also left out the walnuts, because i'm not a big fan of nuts in my desserts.

These brownies were good. Halved the recipe (used 2 eggs) and baked in 8x8 pan. These are the perfect mix between super fudgy and cakey brownies. I prefer really fudgy ones so I like MMM..brownies better.

I made these for my mom's birthday, and they were delicious! I love this recipe. Since my mom is allergic to nuts, we made them without any,and they were fine. After adding the flour,the mix got a little doughy, so I added a splash of milk,and it really made them great.

I am giving this recipe two stars because the taste was delicious, but the brownies themselves were so greasy that you couldn't cut a nice square and take them out. I had to cut them and then kind of scrape a glop out of the pan. Too sticky and underdone texture even though they were cooked.

Really chewy and moist-the perfect combination for a brownie.  I was really impressed...I'm not an experienced cook but was able to whip up a really good dessert that I will definitely make again!  I will say, though, I only left them in for 30 minutes...if I had left them in for 35 they would have been overcooked.

This is an easy, perfect brownie recipe. I've made it with the chocolate squares and with cocoa powder/shortening, both result in wonderful, chewy, brownies.  KEEPER!

The best from scratch brownie I have made, yet.  These were rich and fudgy and evenly cooked all around the pan. There were no hard edges or raw middle.  If you line your pan with foil and refrigerate the browies, these are very easy to cut into perfect shapes and sizes.  Great brownie recipe!

If you are looking for a great chocolate flavor that is not sweet, make these brownies.  I did sub unsweetened chocolate with 12 tbs cocoa and 3 tbl vegatable oil.  I also topped the brownies with "fudgy frosting" from this site.  As others recommended, I lined the pan with foil.

Wow!!! Delicious. Very easy to make. I was thankful for the other reviews to use cocoa & oil instead of choc squares, as I always have cocoa and oil. So tasty, may even be replacing my long time favorite brownie recipe. This one is much more fudgey, which I really love!

Out of fairness, I really couldn't give this any less than 5 stars since I didn't make it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I substituted the 12 tbsp of Coco and 3 tbsp oil for the unsweetened chocolate.  Boxed brownies are much better.

As far as ease goes, these are wesome! I mean, how often can you really make homemade brownies in 1 bowl? Other than that though, I will say that next time I will reduce the sugar some. I have a major sweet tooth but I honestly thought that these were a bit too sweet. My husband agreed. I think next time I will reduce it to 1 1/2 cups.

I've made homemade brownies many times and wanted a truly fudgy one. I was troubled at the lack of salt, the fact that they should be in an 8x8 square pan and also wished I'd read the post about maybe there's too much sugar. The corners/sides were too chewy and dry. The insides were fine, very fudgy. They were easy and good but I'll continue my quest.

Here's my variation:  7/8 c. cocoa powder, 3/4 c. canola oil, 2 c. sugar, 3 eggs, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 c. rice flour.  Combine everything but flour, sift in flour last.  bake in 9 x 9 ceramic pan at 350 for 35 minutes.  Turn off oven, let cool in oven.  It makes a crunchy crust on top and brownies are fudgy.  The first time I tried this version it was because I had run out of regular flour and butter, but now I have a wheat-free, dairy-free brownie for friends with food restrictions!

this was good but the amt of chocolate needs to be increased bc 1 oz of chocolate isnt enough, mine came out light brown and tasting more like just sugar than chocolate. the texture was good however. i would add cocoa powder in addn next time.

These brownies are a keeper!   A few times I haven't had the squares of unsweetened chocolate, so I substituted 3TBS of cocoa and 1 TBS of oil for each ounce, and it worked great! I left out the walnuts and threw in some chocolate chips instead, and they were wonderful!   Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

Oh-if you need a your monthly chocolate fix this is it!  I did mine in a pot because I melted down my butter in that.  I added in one egg at a time beating well after each one.  I did use the coco powder.  I tried the foil and was not happy.  The foil is shiny and that causes burning.  I took it out 10 min early and it still was overdone (though we still ate the whole pan).  Next time I will either flour my pan (I use glass) or use parchment paper.  Very yummy.  Like the box but better!  Yum-O!

I followed the directions exactly (but subbed peanut butter chips for the nuts) and they came out GREAT! They were very easy and very tasty!  If you're worried about them sticking to the pan, use a silicone pan if you have one. They didn't stick at all!

NEEDED 2X CHOCOLATE!  I made this recipe twice.  The first time, I followed direction exactly and used Ghiradelli extra dark.  These were sub-par at best.  Out of desperation, I made a second batch with TWICE the same chocolate and a dash of cinnamon to make the chocolate pop.  This was a worthy brownie that got rave reviews.

these were the best brownies I have ever ate. So moist and yummy. No changes are needed. I left out the walnuts just because I don't care for um in my baked goods. I knew when I licked the batter off the spoon that these brownies were going to be good. Thank you so much

These brownies were really lacking in flavor.  I Made them exactly as the recipe said, and before I put them in the dish to bake I tasted the batter but it was super bland.  So I added about a tsp of salt and then baked them.  They aren't horrible, but I have definitely had better brownies.  Wish I had stuck with a tried and true recipe...

this was my friend's fave recipe...so glad I found it here!  The conversion if you only have cocoa powder instead of baking chocolate squares is as follows: 1 C cocoa powder 1 C melted butter-better with real butter 2 C sugar 3 large eggs 1 C flour 1 ts vanilla and my kids still don't like nuts, so for now we omit and they are chewy & gooey ....and easier to remember! Thank you!

I followed this recipe to the letter -- I did use two 8 x 8 pans because I was using my 9 x 13 for shephard's pie ---  They were very rich, chocolaty and satisfying.  Sometimes when I make "box" brownies, I want to eat the whole pan -- I had two small brownies of this recipe and was done.  Delicious!

These have become a standard in our house.  The ingredients are easy and always delicious. If you don't have unsweetned chocolate squares, I substitute 3 TBS unsweetened cocoa + 1 TBS oil/shortening for each 1 oz square required in the recipe. Delicious!!

Excellent!!! This recipe is very close to my cousins brownies that I wasn't able to get a hold of the recipe. I used pecans and giradelli chocolate squares. They came out chewy and fudgy. Although I used 2 c. white sugar, you could probably get by with 1 1/2 c. sugar. I will be making again and plan to use less sugar next time.

Great Chocolate flavor! I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar because that's all I had & they were still perfect. I cooked them in a 9" square non stick pan sprayed with Pam & had no trouble with sticking. I like thick brownies. Added chocolate chips & cooked for 35 min. Simple & Good!

This is my "Go To" recipe for baking homemade brownies.  I don't even use the boxed mixes anymore as these brownies are almost as easy and yield perfect results.  I originally found this recipe on the back of a Baker's Chocolate box.  I always use foil sprayed with baking spray in my pan, and I usually throw in something extra like Reese's pieces, Mini baking candies, or instant coffee to kick up the flavor a notch.  They are great on their own, though.  I prefer them made with real butter, but margarine turns out fine as well.  As for cooking time, I find that I need to leave them in for 35-40 minutes as opposed to 30-35 minutes.  As with most recipes, baking time is approximate and will ultimately depend on your oven, the pan you use and the temperature of the batter when you begin baking it.  I am well know for my brownies and I cannot imagine that this recipe, when followed, would turn out badly.

I used semi-sweet chocolate without realizing it.  Way to sweet with the 2 cups of sugar.  My biggest disappointment was the lack of chocolate taste.  I am not sure this would change if I had used the unsweet chocolate to begin with.

My dad made these for Thanksgiving and they were amazing.  Tip: under-cook them by just about a minute, and they come out tasting like fudge.

This recipe turned out extremely cake-like and not at as chocolaty as I would expect of a brownie. I've never had any trouble with chocolate recipes before but I didn't like these at all. It wasn't worth the ingredients.

I'm shocked at some of the negative reviews!  I use this recipe often, sometimes as is and sometimes as a base recipe, and it has never failed me!  They've always come out fudgy without being gooey, and definitely chocolaty enough as is.  Of course, because I'm me, I usually use 5 oz. of chocolate instead of 4, and also stir in about 3/4 cup semi-sweet morsels (good ones, like Ghirardelli).  By far my favorite brownie recipe as is or for a base recipe.

This is the exact recipe found on the box of Baker's unsweetened chocolate squares. I made them last night and they're really good! They came out nice and fudgy! A bit sweet though, like other people have said; i'll probably reduce the sugar next time.

I didn't like this recipe. Even with a greased pan, the brownies stuck very badly, plus they were uncooked on the inside even though I baked them at the suggested time. If I would have baked them longer, they would have been burned on the outside. A big thumbs down!

these turned out great and they smell sooo chocolately..even my neighbor said so :) Instead of a square pan I used a muffin pan for individually baked brownies. Topped them off with chocolate chips. Great recipe!

I made these for my Mom to take with her to have as dessert at a lunch after Bible study class.  The brownies were a hit! I was told there were none left.  As I'm unable to eat chocolate, I had to take the opinion of others as far as taste.  The consensus is these brownies are very good.

They are very easy to make and the recipe can be easily doubled.  The only thing that stopped this from being a five star rating, was the edges of the brownies got crisp.  You may not need to let them cook for the full 35 minutes.  Depends on your oven.

I had been trying to find a recipe for brownies like my friend Joan used to make.  I decided to try these today and I think this was the recipe she used!  These are really fudgy and rich, a snap to make too.  I don't know how they would fit a 9x13 pan.  I know it's not a typo because that is what is also stated on the box of the Baker's chocolate(this is the recipe on Baker's choc. box).  I put it in a 6x10? pan and it was perfect.  If I had used a 9x13 I'm afraid they would not have been anything but a wafer; I could be wrong but will stick to a smaller pan unless doubling the recipe.  I used salted butter(that's what I had) but still felt it could use a 1/2 tsp. salt.  I will do next time.  These are super easy.  Would be a great recipe for teens just learning how to bake.  It is a bit expensive when u consider the amt. of choc. and butter, but worth it.  To think I have paid no attention to that Baker's choc. box all these years!  Glad that it was posted.

I teach cooking classes to young children and teens.  I have used this recipe for a few years.  It's failsafe, simple and delicious.  In honor of St. Patrick's Day, in class we swirled green cream cheese batter in the brownies to make them a marble green.  We just omitted the box brownies and made our own from scratch using the above recipe.  They were delish.  However, the calorie content is greater with the addition.

Easy when making it with your little sister! I used the 12 tbls cocoa powder and 3 tbls veggie oil, didn't have the chocolate squares. We also added semi-sweet chocolate chips on top when we got it out of the oven. I also reduced the time by 5 mins.

I love this recipe! I had been dying for brownies for two weeks but I have been completely out of brownie mix. A couple  hours ago I just happened across this recipe and I just had to try it. They were really easy to make. I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate so I used 12 tbs of coco powder and 3 tbs of vegetable oil like the other reviewers suggested and they came out great! The only other adjustment I made to the recipe is that I  added a couple of dashes of cinnamon powder since I love the taste of it with chocolate.

The brownies are very moist on the inside and a bit crunchy/chewy on the outside. They're also very rich; much more filling than the ones than the ones you make with store bought brownie mix. I'll definitely be making these again!

These are very good when you make alterations. I always use cocoa powder/oil combo when making brownies and make sure to use good quality ingredients, especially cocoa. To avoid cakey brownies don't overmix and melt butter all the way. I find that simply combining ingredients with a fork gives perfect results every time. Also, let them cool in the pan before you try to cut them. This allows them to set. They are very chewy, but I love that in a brownie! I did decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup chocolate chunks (I used white, but use whatever you like) instead of nuts. Wonderful! This is my easy brownie recipe :-)

Four stars due to high sweetness, but good texture. I melted the butter with the sugar, boiling it briefly, then stirred in the chocolate (I used SIX ounces). Cooled a bit, then added eggs one at a time, then flour with 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp. vanilla (actually 1/4 tsp. ground vanilla bean). Really decadent- just wish they weren't so sweet.

I found these to be overly sweet the day I baked them and only tasted okay. I left them in the oven over night and the flavor improved and they didn't seem as sweet. They melted in your mouth and were yummy with a fresh cup of coffee. I will make these again but I will decrease the sugar the sugar next time. These turned out nice and fudgy and had the right amount of walnuts in them.

These were ok..  They were too cakey for us.  We like moist fudgy brownies.  We think it is the 3rd egg that may have made it cakey...  We made another recipe and the only difference was 3 eggs and one had cocoa powder instead of unsweetened squares.  Everything else was the same.  This recipe didn't have enough chocolate flavor.

These brownies are a staple in my household.  When I want a quick, chocolately treat, it's these that come to mind.  The only change is that I use cocoa and oil instead of baking chocolate.  I also watch very carefully so that they are not overbaked.  My oven tends to run a little hot, and there's little worse than overbaked brownies.

This IS the best brownie recipe ever!!! The only thing I do differently is add about 1 1/2 teas cinnamon to the flour. We all love that cinnamon taste, and hey its supposed to be good for your heart..so you can have the evil of brownies but know you added good for your heart!!!! :)  Thanks for posting this!!

Love these!  Totally fool proof. Add a little vanilla and dash of cinnamon.

Best brownie recipe I've found for how easy it is! I add a bit of cinnamon to enhance the rich chocolate flavor.

This is a great recipe! I use carob powder and carob chips instead of chocolate, but they are the very best brownies period. I also add a 1/2 cup more flour and use only one egg yolk. Thank you for this!

Excellent! I think this is the brownie recipe I used many years ago when my kids were growing up and it was the family favorite. Through many moves and changes, I had lost the recipe and am so happy to have it back again!  Don't change a thing, follow the recipe exactly as written and you'll have the best brownies ever.

When they first come out of the oven, they are too gooey to cut or eat.  Wait a few hours before cutting them.  Otherwise - these are perfect.  Mine didn't stick to pan at all.

Very easy! I actually reduced the sugar to 1 cup and substituted 1/2 cup all purpose flour with 1/2 cup self-raising flour. Turned out less sticky. Must definitely use the oiled foil lining.

This is hands down the easiest and BEST brownie recipe in exsistence! I love the fudginess and true chocolate flavor they have. I always follow the recipe as written except I don't add nuts (kids don't like them). Instead, I often add 1/2 cup or so of miniature chocolate chips for some extra chocolately goodness and top them off with a sprinkle of sea salt which adds a whole nother flavor demension! I'm getting excited just writing this review. I think I may have to make some more tonight!

I was craving the fudgy brownies with the flaky top that I can get out of a box. And boy was I disappointed! I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate squares, so I did 12/3 on cocoa and oil. Between the butter and oil there was way too much oil! I pulled it out of the oven after 35 minutes and I could see puddles of oil boiling!  I poured off the excess and blotted it with a paper towel. It was definitely not cooked so I just put it in for another 20 minutes. Hopefully it will be finished!

I just made these a few hours ago. I wanted to give this 3 stars but I didn't follow the recipe to the letter so I can't blame the creator. I substituted 3/4 cup of cocoa and 1/4 cup of oil for the unsweetened chocolate and while the flavor was incredibly chocolaty and delicious, the consistency was totally off. These were very loose and gooey - not a good gooey, almost like an underbaked gooey. I cooked them for 35mins and they taste fantastic, but it's almost as if you have to use a spoon with them because if you held one it would jsut mush apart in your hand. I almost added another 1/2 cup of flour to it but decided to just make it the way it said to first. Next time I'll definitely add 1/2 cup flour or decrease the oil to 1/8 cup. Really delicious, just completely unmanageable. Oh, and PS - I coated the 13x9 dish with tons of PAM and they didn't stick at all. They're also REALLY thin in a 13x9 pan, might put them in the 9x9 pan and boost the bake time by like 12-15mins and see what happens.

This was my first time making brownies from scratch, and I don't know why I'd ever go back to buying mixes.  These were super easy and very yummy.  I didn't have unsweetened chocolate squares, so I used the 12 Tbl cocoa powder and 3 Tbl vegetable oil recommended by others.  I topped these with the Brownie Frosting recipe from this site, and the result was fudgey deliciousness!  Excellent recipe!

I wasn't a big fan of the flavor of these brownies (followed recipe as written except leaving out walnuts). Too sweet and rich for my tastes, and not chocolatey enough. Also a little flat - I prefer slightly fatter brownies. They came out with the right texture, though, and no problems getting them out of a pan lined with foil and greased/cocoa powdered. The one bowl method was convenient, although next time I will go with a different recipe because of the taste.

This is my regular brownie recipe now. It is so easy and it works well with either unsweetened chocolate or the cocoa as a substitute. It even worked when I let my teenage boys make the recipe and they used semi-sweet chocolate. I wouldn't recommend doing that on purpose though because they were way too sweet.

I've been looking for a scratch recipe for years and was in a pinch last night to make dessert. I saw that I had all the ingredients for these and gave them a shot reminding myself that I've never loved scratch brownies I've made.  They were out of this world good. I made the recipe exactly like it called for but because of a few reviews I cut down baking just by a few min but I don't think it would have made a difference.  Very rich dark chocolate taste.  I topped with mini m&ms for kids but the adults had no complaints.  I'll never buy another box of brownies.

Since my husband gets migraines from chocolate but was kind enough to tell me "MAKE the brownies, already!  I don' t mind!" I cut the recipe in 1/3.  I had less than an ounce of ecuadorian chocolate, so added a tablespoon or so of cocoa (half of a 1/4 cup? a little less?) and chose to use organic grass-fed ghee instead of butter--and of course added a few twists from the sea salt grinder, baked in a little 2-cup casserole dish, buttered well, baked for 23 minutes.  Turns out that was maybe 1/2 minute short, since it was still pretty gooey in the middle but once they cooled a bit and set up ... YUMMY!!!!  Chewy chocolatey brownies with the crackly top and crunchy edges, just the way I like them!  This recipe is a keeper!  And they didn't stick at all!  If yours are cake-like, they're overbaked.  If they stick, you need more butter in the recipe--butter these days has more water in it than it used to have, which means that you're adding more liquid and less fat than you think you are.  The ghee, being all fat, is perfect.

I made it again, using some good, sweet cream butter from the co-op, right off the farm--high enough fat content to work well, again, no sticking.  I didn't have any chocolate so used 5T cocoa & an extra T of butter--next time I'll add an additional T of cocoa.  Still YUM!!!

Very easy to make.  Sticks to the pan even after using crisco.  The flavor is alright - nothing spectacular.

Mmmmm!!!  These are really good and easy!  I even substituted whole wheat flour for all purpose and smart balance instead of butter.  I had to cook mine for about 40 minutes.  I  omitted the walnuts because I didn't have any.  This has earned a spot in my permanent collection!  Thanks!!!

I've been looking for ultimate brownie recipe. I've tried about 10 different recipes. This is the very best by far. I will never try another. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe. Love it. Update: Add choc chips, even better.

WOW!  These are really, really good.  I am always the one who loves to eat the edge of the brownies because they're all chewy and dense.  This whole recipe turns out like that!  I subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar, and I might have added a little bit more vanilla, since I wasn't measuring, but otherwise used the ingredients as listed.  Mine only needed 30 min. to bake, so watch it after 30.  35 would have made them hard and dry.

WONDERFUL!!  Perfect brownies without the box. The only thing I added was peanut butter frosting 1 cup confectioners' sugar, 1/3 cup p.b. 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 2 - 4 T. milk.  You could also add flaked toasted coconut & toasted pecans with some M & M's for a very fun, very popular dessert!

This is a great recipe for those looking to get a quick-and-easy chocolate fix. These brownies have a great texture, and I love that you can almost always find all of the ingredients in your kitchen pantry. However, I usually add a few modifications since I like my brownies extremely chewy. I add 1/2 cup vegetable oil to give them a less-cakey texture, and use 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips in place of two of the unsweetened chocolate squares. My family LOVES them with a pinch of cinnamon!

These brownies have great chocolate flavor and they're great in a pinch if you need something to take to a party.  The only problem is they're not quite as chewy as I'd like.  You definitely don't want to leave them in the oven too long.

I doubled this recipe the first time.  Doing it that way it's not very chocolate-y, and very cake-like.  I doubled it because looking at the recipe and pan size, I thought they might be a little thin.  Next time, I'm still doubling, but changing it up a bit to make some nice heavy tar brownies.

These were delightful. To avoid a trip to the market (no unsweetened squares on hand), I used 5 oz of extra dark chocolate and reduced the sugar just a bit.

Excellent.  Followed recipe pretty much exactly (except adding a bit more walnut pieces than called for... and using only 1-1/2 cups of sugar) and had none of the problems/complaints of other reviewers.  Good texture, great chocolate flavor.  Oh ... I DID end up using a total of three bowls....

This is the recipe on the box of unsweeted Baker's chocolate.  It's pretty good.  I eliminated the nuts because I think they ruin a good brownie.  I added semi sweet chocolate chips instead.

These brownies were super easy to make and they turned out great. I also used cocoa powder instead of the squares with no problem. I didn't use the foil though. I just sprayed the metal pan with a cooking spray with flour(liberally.) My brownies popped right out. I'll definitly make these again.

Yummy Delicious!!!  I am 8 months pregnant, having a chocolate craving (Cocoa Puffs ain't cutting it), and a dwindling supply of stuff.  I ran out of cocoa powder, so this recipe was perfect!  Moist, very chocolately, and good enough to hide from my husband and son. :0P     I didn't have unsweetened squares though, and only had 3 total squares (semisweet), so I used the remaining 2 ozs or so of semisweet morsels.  Since I used the semisweet, I cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and I used maple syrup as I was out of vanilla extract.    This recipe was so good that it is the first I have rated myself since joining (and frequently using) Allrecipes more than 3 years ago!

Fantastic! As long as your follow the recipe. I first tried to make a batch without the walnuts, cherries and almonds instead, and they were just too chewy. The walnuts are necessary.

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out really well...although I prefer a more fudgy/chocolatey brownie.  I think next time I'll use an extra square or two of chocolate.  I'll definitely make these again though.  It took less than 10 minutes to whip up and throw in the oven...very easy.

THE BEST BROWNIES EVER!!!  They were delicious.  But I have one suggestion the brownies were a little dry so i added just a little dab of vegetable oil plus it made it stick less.

This is a good, quick brownie recipe.  I completely blew my diet with these tonight!  I had no vanilla so I omitted it.  I didn't use nuts either and I added a teaspoon of instant coffee granules (personal preference).  I lined the pan with foil and greased the foil.  I still had some trouble getting the brownies out, but they were nice and fudgy.  I don't know if it was just my oven, but I recommend baking them for five minutes less, as the edges were too hard, which always happens when i make brownies.

These are very simple to make and very good! I used walnuts and shredded coconut...yummy! One thing that I would change next time is to reduce the sugar a bit (as these came out quite sweet) but other than that, these are a keeper!

I followed the recipe. I Suggest NOt cooking for 35 mins at 350. I checked on my brownies after 30 mins and I felt like they were done (almost too done). I wish I would have checked at 25 mins. The taste is average. I had to make homemade chocolate frosting to go with.

This was my first time making brownies from scratch and this recipe was perfect. They were super easy to make and turned out to be super delicious.  Since I didn't have unsweetened chocolate squares, I used Hershey's Unsweetened Cocoa and Oil.   They were a big hit for the chocolate lovers in my family (including myself) and definitely satisfied all my chocolate cravings for as long as they existed (1 week).  I would DEFINITELY make them again!

I loved these brownies. I made mine with Semi-Sweet Chocolate squares, used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 2 tablespoons of vanilla.  They were the best brownies I have ever made and I will make these from now on.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I followed the recipe to the tee and they were wonderful.  Not quite as sweet as the box mix brownies you buy in the store and that's a good thing.  This will be THE brownie recipe in my recipe box from now on!

Followed the recipe exactly as is and it is FANTASTIC!  I had my doubts about such a big pan but it worked great.  I sprayed with pam and lined with flour - they came out just fine.  Baked 35 minutes on the dot, sprinkled with icing sugar and wow do they taste great.  This is the best from scratch brownie recipe I have had.

My first time making brownies from scratch and this was a perfect recipe. We didn't have the chocolate squares but did have Nestle's "Pre-Melted" packets which worked fine. grandaughter and Nana loved them.

I made a double batch of these brownies for my co-worker's birthday and she was in heaven! I added replaced the walnuts with chocolate chips and also used chocolate icing to make them triple chocolate and they were pure-chocolate lover's paradise. They're a bit tough to get out of the pan, though, but worth the effort!

I didn't have the baking chocolate, so I followed the advice of others and mixed 12 T cocoa with 3 T vegetable oil. I added a few handfuls of Reese's peanut butter chips, YUMMY! Everyone at our house loved them.

This recipe makes for some lovely, moist brownies, very fudgy not at all cake like.  I used only 200g of sugar, and added a pinch of salt.  I found the walnuts, which I didnt toast, gave a slightly bitter aftertaste. Still, that was not a recipe fail rather my laziness.  Next time, I'm going to subsitute Fra Angelico liquer for the vanilla and use roasted hazelnuts for the walnuts

I am typically not a sweets baker, so I was a little shocked to see the amount of sugar and butter that went into this recipe.  Nonetheless it turned out GREAT!  Exactly the way I want a brownie to be.  I added dried bing cherries which added a much welcomed tangy chew to the brownie.  I would recommend the addition of dried fruits such as apricots, cherries or cranberries.

I have never made anything from scratch until this recipe and it was so simple and DELICIOUS! I will definitely be making these again.  The only things I changed were: I used 3/4 c butter with canola oil, added slivered almonds, and used Betty Crocker Brownie Topper (chocolate) to frost them.  I think the butter with canola oil combo made them extra rich and gooey, just the way I like them!

I have tried a few brownie recipes from this site and this is the winner.  I didn't have baker chocolate so I used 1 cup semi-sweet chips and decresed the sugar to 1 1/2 c.  Baked for 22 minutes and used the foil trick.  Very very good.  Tastes like a really good quality brownie mix.  chewy, rich.  Next time I am going to try and bake it in a 9x9.  If you try a homemade brownie... try these!

This isn't even close to my definition of a brownie.  And mine didn't look anything like that picture either.  Since i took them out of the oven, the texture keeps changing, and the flavor is not brownie-like at all.  Won't be trying this again.

For ease, this recipe was great.  Unfortunately, I didn't have unsweetened chocolate and used semi-sweet along with the mix of brown and white sugars.  The mix tasted pretty good, but once backed, they were too sweet. I would like to try again with the correct chocolate or maybe the cocoa powder mixture.

I've never made brownies from scratch and was sure I was going to mess these up cause of the reviews about sticking, drying out etc.  My husband said they are some of the best brownies he's ever had...way better than any box mix.  I'm not known for being a baker so if I can do this, anyone can.  They did not stick at all, they came out super moist, not cakey which is how we like them.  I only baked them for 28 minutes and that was plenty.

The first time around, I read the chocolate amount as 1 ounce instead of 4, so messed the brownies up.  The second time, I added 3.5 ounces of chocolate, 2 tablespoons of cocoa, substituted canola oil for the butter, added a half teaspoon of coffee and also used aluminium foil at the bottom of a glass pan.   The brownies turned out perfect.

These were yummy!  My children were dancing around the house with joy after they took the first bite!  Used a 7x11 in. glass pan lined with foil and greased with "baking" spray, baked 30 min. and they came out perfect!

This is the easiest and best brownie recipe I have ever made. I didn't have any of the unsweetened chocolate squares so I used 3/4 c. unsweetened cocoa and 1/3 c. oil mixed together instead. Also used a glass cooking pan generously covered with non stick cooking spray. Did not have any problems at all getting them out. Topped them with the Fudgy Cake Icing recipe from this site. They were perfect. Thanks for the easy recipe. Will use over and over.

These brownies were awesome, they turned out great in first try...i did lil variations as recommended. cut the sugar to 1 cup, added 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup milk and 1 tsp baking powder. I like brownies soft and cakey so these variations worked... flavour is all sweet chocolatey .... yummy :D

Really really GOOD and EASY recipe from scratch: i made mine in a 10" springform pan and used dark chocolate with hazelnuts (doubling the amount called for chocolate) to make it cheaper (nuts here in germany are VERY expensive). Covered it with chocolate glaze for a birthday.

Easy & Very Yummy. I used the cake like brownie suggestion with the added 1/2 c flour, and 1/2 c milk, 1/2 cup less sugar & 2 t. vanilla instead of 1 t. Baked in a greased & flour glass pan for 30 min. Perfect. Frosted with choc frosting. Thanks to all of you for your reviews and suggestions. This is a keeper!

I really love these brownies, sometimes add an extra egg to make them fluffier, I'm curious as to whether cake flour would make them cake-ier.

These are the best brownies I have ever made! They are moist and chewy, and have that perfect crust on the top that makes a brownie, a brownie! Like a previous poster, I too used cocoa powder and canola oil instead of unsweetened chocolate squares. They are perfect! Thank you so much!

Fantastic recipe!  I made these to the recipe.  They freeze well when individually wrapped and stored in a freezer bag; that way they don't sit on the kitchen counter staring at you! :)

Wow best brownies ever.  I do subsitute half bakers choc/oil for 2 of the baking squares, but i am now known as the brownie lady.  I have been asked to make these brownies repeatedly.  They are easy, quick, and come out perfectly.  I only bake mine for 30-32 minutes.  I found that at 35 they get a little tough.

Golly, I made these exactly as stated, but omitted the nuts. They were SO tough, I couldn't gnaw my way through even one. The bottoms got really hard, and the rest was really dense and chewy as taffy. I bake often, and I really don't now what I could have done wrong.

I loved these brownies.  They cooked a little faster for me than stated in the recipe (but I may have pulled them out a little sooner than most people would since I like brownies to be really fudgy and chewy).  Other than that though, I can't find anything to complain about.  I, like other people, used cocoa powder and shortening instead of chocolate, but it didn't seem to matter.  The brownies had a great flavor and texture.  Let them cool a little before trying to lift them out of the pan though, because they are tender and crumble easily.

these were good but next time i think i'll try a little coffee in the mix. update: 2/16/09 i used the unsweetened cocoa and oil because i didn't have any chocolate bars, also i used half white sugar and half brown sugar, i used about 3 tablespoons of strong coffee and about 2 teaspoons of vanilla and it came out much better. enjoy!

This was super fast and easy to toss together and they turned out great! I used semi-sweet squares, so reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups, which turned out just great - not too sweet. Based on another reviewer, added a pinch of salt. Also used margarine instead of real butter. Unlike others who have complained about them being tough to get out of the pan -- mine were just fine - no crumbling or stickiness. Used vegetable spray to coat the pan prior to putting the batter in. Ran a knife around the edges when they came out, then let cool about 20 minutes in the pan on a rack before slicing. They came away perfectly. We didn't add the nuts but those would have been great too. The kids loved these!

These were good but not great. I didn't have bakers chocolate squares but took another reviewrs advice of using coco powder as a subsitution. It worked out good, but I thought the baking time should have been less that 35 min. I only cooked mine for 30 & still found them to be a bit dry. Like I said, good but not great...definatley easy though!

These are very good.  The top crust could be a little "crustier" so I didn't give them 5 stars, but if I could give them 4 1/2, I would.  They are fudgy, chewy at the edges, and have a good chocolate flavor.  The ease of the recipe and the fact that they take one bowl will make these a staple in my house.

There's too much sugar in them and the baking time's too long. If you're looking for a chocolate fix, they'll still do the job.

Delicious and so easy to make! We left it baking a little bit longer because we wanted it a bit more crunchy than fudgey. Will definitely make this again (and again and again). *Update* as I don't have the chocolate bars called for in the recipe I substitute 1 cup of semi sweet cocoa powder with 1/3 of vegetable oil to make a cocoa paste which I then add to the recipe. Delicious brownies! I have made them 3 times since and they are always winners.

I love this recipe!  I have been making these brownies for years.  Its the same recipe that's on the Baker's unsweetened chocolate box.  Of course, we cna always make them with variations as I did.  I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla and added 1/2 teaspoon salt.  I also used a little more than a cup and a half of walnuts and at the end I added about a cup (6 oz) of semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were better than any I have ever had from the bakery.  A good tip is to use foil in your pan and butter it or use parchment paper and leave enough extended over the edge to lift them out.  Cool and cut on a wooden board with a serated edge knife.  They'll last for a few days in an airtight container unless your house is like mine. :-)

I guess I'm a brownie-snob. I wasn't too impressed.  The hard top and fudgy middle were okay but there's just something missing here. Try using the smaller pan, maybe 1 less egg - but the flavor just didn't seem right to me.

Yes, they're delicious.  Yes, they're fudgey, not cakey.  Yes you should make the changes suggested by previous reviewers:
(1) less sugar (1 1-2 cups)
(2) less eggs (2 large)
(3) use a smaller pan than a 9x13
All i had on hand was a 9X13 and i was just having a mad brownie craving, so i didn't bother making that change.  The brownies were cooked within 15 minutes and were super thin, like cookies, but not crunchy or round. And just as a side note, this recipe is the same as "One Bowl Brownies" (+/- one egg) from this website which is the (kraft) recipe from the back of a Baker's chocolate box.

A bit sweet. But nice, just might not put as much sugar the next time.

Fisrt time I made it, it was sensational but i didn't use nuts. I never use vanilla esccence. Second time  made it, it was with mixed nuts and rasins and it was even better than the first time. 3rd time I made it, i added mixed nuts with raisins and chocolate glaze.The kids loved it but the adults thought the first ones better. 4th time I made it I used choc chips and the same recipe like before without the glaze and i doubled the mixture. 5th time I made it (2 days ago) I didn't have enough cocoa powder and failed to realize so it wasn't chocolatey and it was more like egg brownie. Fortunately, everyone STILL LOVED it. In all the recipes except for the first one, I used cocoa powder and it still does the trick. This has become an ultimate family fave! I make it almost every week and it only lasts one and half days at the most!

As stand alone brownies, they weren't really working for me, but crumbled into ice cream it was pretty good.

Maybe it is because I have gotten into the habit of using unsalted butter, but these brownies needed SALT.  I added about 1t the second time around, along with 1t of baking powder.  The first time I made them they were good, don't get me wrong, but they needed some salt.

I used 150 g of 70 cocoa chocolate in place of the unsweetened chocolate and lowered the sugar to 1 1/2 cups to compensate. I baked for exactly 30 minutes. The end product was not cakey but not exactly fudgy either and too sweet. I didn't used about 2/3 of walnuts and found the walnuts too overpowering.

Good brownies. I only had an 8" X 8" baking pan so I left it in the oven for an extra 12 minutes. I imagine time would vary depending on your oven. I ended up with very dense, tasty brownies. Will make again.

My first time making brownies from scratch. My family loved them they didn't even last 24 hours! After they cooled they could have been a little softer. I probably caused that though.

Great flavor and texture.  Mine did stick, using the butter/foil method.  Will try it in pan with just butter next time.  Baked as directed, worried that they might be underdone but as they sat and cooled, came out just right.  Awesome brownies!

These brownies are the BEST! I make them my own by changing the recipe a little and I add 1/2 cup chopped baking chocolate or mini chocolate chips. My family loves them and I couldn't ask for anything more - thank you!

This is a great brownie recipe that takes less than 6 minutes to put together.  I did substitute bitter sweet, 60%cocoa chips and it still was awesome.  I also have celiac disease & cannot eat wheat or gluten so I used a blending of rice flours, tapioca flour, & xantham gum powder.  WOW The Brownies are Fantastic, my husband LOVES them and that is what makes me happy....

Excellent!! However, I only had semi-sweet baking chocolate so I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and added two teaspoons of vanilla. MMMMMMM!

Here's what I did because I have a diabetic in the family and from my experience in the kitchen and my mother sharing hers over and over. I've figured out where some people have gone wrong.
1) It's too sweet! Even though I cut the sugar. Watch the chocolate and butter.  Don't use sweet or sweetened butter. Cut back the sugar by 1/2 cup if you are using semi-sweet chocolate. This recipe is for unsweetened chocolate. Not enough salt, watch out that you use salted butter rather then unsalted butter. If you do end up with unsalted butter don't panic it's not ruined use 1/2 tsp of salt in your recipe per half cup of butter. As for my recipe I cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2 cups of splenda instead and it came out fine. I also added 1/2 cup of milk and increased the flour by a 1/2 cup. I realized after 10 minutes into baking that I forgot to add my 1/2 cup of walnuts and simply pressed them into the warm batter with the back of a mixing spoon.  It was hidden by the  chocolate icing.  Note: For those using splenda in icing, use half icing sugar and half splenda, add a tablespoon of corn starch to increase bulk. Note: Corn starch is what gives icing sugar it's light loose feeling and it's bulk.

Not a disaster for me.  Didn't stick to the pan, or turn out raw or anything.  I simply thought these were far too sweet, and not nearly chocolaty enough.  A disappointment...

I didn't have any brownie squares so i used 12 tblspoons cocoa powder and three tablespoons vegetable oil.  It came out perfectly fine.  I also was talking on the phone and forgot to add the vanilla extract, and it still tasted great.  Crispy outside nice and moist center.  I will definately be making this again.

I made 1 1/2 times this recipe in an 11x17 pan. (Change the quanity to 18) I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate squares, so I substituted 3T cocoa powder and 1 T shortening for each 1 oz square.  I melted the butter and shortening together and then stirred in the cocoa powder.  I noticed some of the reviews said the batter was really thick and hard to spread.  I added 2 T water, and while the batter was still thick, it was a little easier to spread in the pan.  Be careful on your bake times - mine only took about 25 minutes.

These are great! Just put foil in the pan and grease the foil and you'll be fine. So easy too! You really only have to use one bowl. I put powdered sugar on top and they were really good. Never again will I buy a brownie mix at the store!

I am very finicky about my brownies, and this is the ONLY recipe I have ever found (and I have tried many..) that produces a super-rich fudgy, brownie very similar to a "Betty Crocker" brownie. I too substituted cocoa and oil for the chocolate and it turned out great. Next time, I will double the recipe to produce a slightly thicker brownie. Wonderful, thanks.

This is truly the BEST brownie recipe I have ever made (or tasted, for that matter). I used cocoa powder and oil instead of the chocolate squares. I also found it unnecessary to line the pan, unlike another reviewer posted. I generously greased it, and the brownies came out fine. If you're looking for a brownie recipe that tastes just like - and probably better than - your favorite boxed mix, this is it!!

Brownies turned out very tasty minus the nuts (allergies). I did use the premelted unsweetened chocolate as an alternative and it worked as well. One package equals one square. Definitely a keeper.

These brownies were delicious! Mildy crunchy on top, and soft and chewy in the middle, and not gooey at all. I did change the recipe a bit; I took out the nuts, put a layer of hershey's syrup over the top, and also added a thick layer of chocolate icing (triple chocolate explosion!) Three of my friends cleaned up half of them in under two minutes. Delicious, and easy!

Had I followed the directions instead of reading someone's review of putting it into a smaller sized pan these might have turned out.
Definately Follow the recipe on this one it's the same recipe as on the box of bakers chocolate squares so it can't be wrong..still not sure what I was thinkin!

This is the original Baker's One Bowl Brownies recipe that we have used for 25 years.  It is still the best fudgy brownie recipe.

It was a good recipe except that I was distracted and didn't calculate the chocolate squares properly (used 4 1/4 ounce pieces instead of the whole box of chocolate squares for 4 ounces) ;) Husband was highly disappointed since it's very cold out here today and he really wanted true brownies. They came out well otherwise - I liked the shape, consistency, texture and flatness, and they didn't stick to the pan, but were more like walnut blondies! Next time I'll make sure to put in 4 ounces of chocolate instead of 1. Also since the squares were semi-sweet I halved the sugar amount. Nice quick recipe, though.

These brownies have basically no chocolate in them and came out pretty flat. There's no rise to them at all, and I definitely wouldn't use a 13"x9" pan again. The reviews on this site are always misleading, I saw that this recipe had 4.5 stars so I tried it, but everyone who rated it well changed half the recipe! I might make this again but I would definitely cut down on the sugar, up the chocolate, and maybe add some baking powder so they aren't so dense!

I have made this recipe for over 20 years, with 100% success.  For those users that had the brownies not cook properly, get your oven checked!  You can substitute half coconut oil for the butter and they are healthier with a coconutty taste, or add chocolate chips, or add broken peppermint candies (sprinkled on top is very pretty).  Never buy box mix brownies! These are outstanding and you already have all the ingredients!

This is a great recipe - I used to make these years ago from an old Pillsbury cookbook and I'm so glad I found it again.  I like to make them thicker, so I bake them in a 9 in square pan.

This is a fantastic brownie recipe. I didn't have butter on hand, so instead I used about 2/3 cup of Safflower oil, much healthier. I also used a mix of light and dark brown sugar instead of white sugar. They came out chewy, moist and delicious! Caution, do not over cook. I only cooked mine for about 23 minutes. Also, I used a much smaller glass pan, about 9x9. Because of using the oil, the brownies did not stick to the glass at all like people are saying in other reviews. Another yummy option is to add some bittersweet chocolate chips to the mix.

Just tried this recipe except I cut it in half, reduced the sugar and used whole wheat flour. 
I used 2 oz (half a bar) of unsweetened chocolate, 6 TBL butter, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 egg, and 1/2 cup of King Arthur white whole wheat flour (omitted walnuts b/c I didn't have any). Baked it in an 8" square pan for about 18 min. They were only about a 1/2" thick but I thought they turned out well. Not spectacular but definitely satisfied my chocolate craving.

This is the brownie we prefer over any others.   Not nearly as sweet and cloying and if you don't overbake they turn out beautifully moist. Don't even need frosting but a dusting of icing sugar is nice. ALSO do not overmix.   Thanks for subitting this great recipe

I use this recipe, as is, every time I make brownies.  They are the perfect consistency if you like your brownies soft and fudgy.  I line my pan with foil and after they cool, I just pull them out and wrap them up.  Very easy and very good.  I get requests for them regularly!

Delectable! Combined a couple suggestions to make the Low-Sugar Cakey Version 2.1. Used only 1.5 cups sugar, used 2 tsp vanilla. Added an extra 0.5 cup flour and 0.5 cup milk to make it more cakey. Substituted almonds for walnuts. Pro-tip: I used a glass dish without grease and the brownies did not stick.

This recipe was a good start. When I made it the first time, my husband liked them, but I didn't think they were sweet enough and they were hard. When I made them the second time, I used semi-sweet chocolate. Both times I melted in a saucepan but the second time I added sugar in the raw to the pan so it would melt a bit because it tends to be grainy. Also to the flour I added baking soda, powder and salt. A strange thing happened, the mix bubbled and overflowed when baked, but the brownies turned out moist and delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe.

These were quick, easy, and delicious-what more can you ask for. Much better than the box mix and just as easy to throw together. I used a bar of Ghiradelli unsweetened baking chocolate and pecans in place of the walnuts-I don't think I'll ever buy a box again!

Color me disappointed. It's not the first time I have made brownies from scratch. Followed directions exactly. Used the last of my holiday nuts. Used 125 gr. baking chocolate (4 ozx29=116gr). End result: light on chocolate, heavy on grease. Overbaked exactly one minute. Hard on the edges, which I expected, gooey and unbaked interior.

In the words of my 8 year old : Awesome!!!!
No changes made and I did use the chocolate bars vs the coco powder.  Next time I may cut back the sugar by a 1/4 or 1/2 cup, but still great.  Baked for 30 minutes in  convection oven.

This was a good recipe. I didn't have any unsweetened baking chocolate so I used unsweetened cocoa powder and butter...added 1 tbsp too much butter. They were a bit greasy but still yummy. Will use again.

so as i read some of the bad reviews for this recipe i had to laugh. for any recipe, cooking time is based on the creator's oven, not your oven at home.  all ovens are not the same & if you know your oven and how it cooks, heats etc then you will know that you either need to add more baking time or decrease, maybe up the temperature, depends on your oven.  if you took the brownies out and there was a lot of oil still on the top then guess what? they need more time in the oven, common sense, nothing to do with the recipe creator, just know your oven. that being said i thought these were a good mix of cakey & a little fudgey as well. i used dark cocoa 85 % but i didn't have enough so i added some unsweetened cocoa powder as well. my only other changes, i used white whole wheat flour which is a finer wheat flour to use and your baked goods come out really light, not like when you use regular whole wheat flour. i used truvia instead of sugar but i only used 1 cup of sugar & it wasn't a full cup.  that's the only part of this recipe that i take a star off of, 2 cups of sugar is way too much sugar, were making brownies not candy. i cook with less sugar period so i might be biased but i didn't feel 2 cups were necessary so i used just 1 and they taste great, not overly sweet, just right. i might try it wit 2 eggs next time just to see if there's any change in the texture but this will be my go to recipe

My brownies came out lite brown, not so chocolaty... and I think I over work the batter.
I used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips for 4oz ... and omitted walnuts because I didn't have any.
I doubled the recipe and used half for cheese cake topped brownies... it was ok, but I think I like the other recipe better.

These brownies are awesome!  Much better than a box mix and much easier than the recipe I've used in the past.  I've made these a few times, experimenting with the sugar and butter amounts, and I think you can safely cut down on the sugar if you want (1-1/2 cups).  Try to keep the fat content as is, although you can substitute vegetable/canola oil for part of it.  Really delicious!!!!

I got this recipe from the inside of the Baker's chocolate box and I love it! Tips for those that are having issues with it: line your pan with foil or parchment, then grease if using foil or lightly spray with cooking spray if using parchment and it won't stick to the pan and will be easy to lift out. 35 mins is WAY too long to bake these, should be more like 25mins. Insert a toothpick to check, the toothpick should come our covered in fudgey crumbs, NOT clean. These are a very sweet brownie but I like them that way :) I also added a pinch of kosher salt to help bring out the chocolate flavor.

These are delish!  I wasn't sure I'd like them since I usually prefer a more cake-like brownie but I'm so glad I tried the recipe.  I'll definitely be using it as my "go to" and no more of that boxed stuff since these are just as quick.  I omitted the nuts (to me plain brownies are best-no nuts, choc chips or frosting) and used cocoa powder instead of squares.  They can't be resisted...thanks for submitting.

The best!  Nice and fudgey.  I found that they hold together better if you take them out earlier.  Usually 20 minutes or sooner has worked for me.

Brownies are not something I make often, so I'm going to chalk this one up to lack of experience and try again later.  They are easy enough and seem to bake up well, but mine were extremely gooey in the middle.  They certainly looked done and were crispy on top, not jiggling, etc, but kind of oozy when cut.  I've had this issue with cinnamon rolls, of all things, and when I switched from using a 9x13 pan to two 8x8 pans, the problem was solved, so I will try that next time.  It didn't stop bf from gobbling them up, so that tells me to experiment with the baking time and pans, not the recipe itself.  I frosted with leftover Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting and it was great together.  thanks for the recipe!

The flavor of these was VERY good (extremely chocolatey), and on that note I'd give them five stars.  The one thing I didn't care for, though, was the top of the brownies got "crusty" rather than soft - I prefer soft all over!

I made this recipe to the T. Could not cut out as really hard around the edges. Also crumbled when you tried to cut out the rest.You had to use a spoon to eat them.  One good thing is they tasted good.

Clearly I am in the minority here but I had a terrible time with these brownies. I tried them twice over the weekend and both times they came out half cooked and half raw. I added time and temperature both times and with no luck. Not sure what went wrong but they were basically unuable.

Best home made brownies ever, and unbelievable how easy they were to make! I used semi-sweet chocolate squares and half of the sugar. After they came out of the oven, I put chocolate fudge frosting on top. It melted into the brownies and soaked through. They were even more delicious the next day!

These are really good, and very easy.  I find there is NO change requred to the recipe as written.  The taste is fantastic, plenty chocolaty, not sickly sweet.  They are actually better on the second or third day, on day one they are more cakey and the flavor isn't quite as developed.  This is a repeat recipe in our kitchen, and they always turn out the same -- delicious and just right.

SO super easy and YUMMY!! I tried the suggestion of half the amount of sugar with brown sugar but it gave them a funny taste. The second batch I made as the recipe said ommiting the nuts because I didnt have any. The third time i placed sliced almonds on the bottom of the pan before pouring in the batter!!! I found this recipe a week ago and have already made them THREE TIMES!! I will DEFINATELY keep this one and pass it along to friends!!

I made this recipe last evening; I thought it sounded good and there were few ingredients and they sounded good.  Should have known better.  I have always used a cocoa powder recipe that everyone likes.  These brownies were so sticky and yucky tasting!  I even used parchment paper because alot of the readers mentioned how sticky they were and hard to get out of the pan.  Will never make this recipe again and will delete it out of my recipe box.  Such a waste of the chocolate squares...

I am shocked--these taste oddly bland to me.  I followed the recipe exactly and they look just like the picture, but the flavor is just... missing!  I am thinking they needed more vanilla and perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt.  Or were we supposed to use salted butter? I can't believe 4 oz of baking chocolate can make such a disappointing flavor.  The texture of these is not bad, but I still think it is worth it to beat the eggs and sugar first, separately, then add the melted (and cooled!) stuff, as most brownie recipes will tell you to do; it's really not that much more work.

I only gave this 2 stars because it came out a very light brown... I think maybe because of the chocolate... if you try this recipe, use cocoa instead.  I'm using a different recipe out of my nestle cocoa box :)

Great recipe!  Quick, easy and delicious!  I am not a fan of cake-like brownies and  these are the perfect texture....just like a brownie should be!  I made these with a little less butter and they came out great!  This will be my go to brownie recipe from now one!  Thanks!

One of the easiest Brownie recipes I've ever tried and one of the best. Very fudgie and crispy on outside. I did cook it longer than stated because I put it in a different sized dish and wasn't sure if it was done a few times, but it tasted wonderful! This was so convenient AND tasty that I will for sure make again.

Very easy to make, used oil and cocoa method. A thin brownie,sweet, not that real chocolate flavor. Have another recipe I prefer. Cooked very quickly compared with other reviews.

I did not have choc on hand so I used 3/4c cocoa + 3 Tbsp oil (like another reviewer suggested) and I reduced sugar to 1 1/2 c as per anothers suggestion, which worked. For next time, I would probably multiply the ingredients by 1.5 for a 9x13 pan. It was too cake-like for me so I may increase chocolate and reduce flour as well.

these did not work for me. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was sweet enough, but more like a grown up brownie than a kid sugar fest. I used 2/3 c of walnuts (one pkg) and that was plenty of nuts, less would have been better. What didn't work was they were over done at 35 mins.  Dense, but not fudgy. "Best Brownies" from this site have never failed me, but I cook that at 325.

These are perfect if you are looking for fudgey and chewy brownies. I did not change a thing.  However I did very little mixing in order to keep these from being cakey.

I really wanted these brownies to be as great as the comments! I modified the servings to 8 according to the Allrecipes calculator and something definitely came out wrong. I guess changing the serving size and omitting walnuts were what made these bomb. They came out like an oilslick. Way too greasy, and not enough flour in them.  So sorry :(

I have to say these were worlds better than box brownies. Easy and totally worth it.  I was cooking for a family member with milk allergies so I substituted shortening for the butter and used semi-sweet chocolate with no milk (found at trader joes). I expected them to taste mediocre but I have to say I liked them A LOT! And about 4 people asked me for the recipe.  You'll love 'em.

These brownies are awesome. I 'thirded' the recipe. I also omitted the nuts. (I don't like them) These don't have the cocoa-y taste you usually get with homemade brownies. They just taste like chocolate. But without being super-sweet like boxed brownies. I love these. I highly recommend you make these.

I thought this was a great recipe. So easy and  handy  to  throw together with just your basic staples.  I also like the fact that at a last minute invite you can make them relatively fast.

Can't get any easier than this!  And just because it was easy doesn't mean they're not good--this is the best brownie from scratch that I've ever had.  I made brownie a la mode and used cookies n cream for ice cream and everyone loved it!  But, being a cakey brownie myself I am trying the recipe with an additional egg.  I think that will do the trick.

These were amazing! The whole family loved them! They were chewy, soft, and cooked easily. I added a pinch of baking powder and a little cocoa to use up what I had at home. I will be using this all the time! :)

I'm as convinced as everyone else seems to be -- these are absolutely fantastic brownies. I did cut the sugar by 25% and I added almonds as well as the suggested walnuts. This recipe makes a really wonderful quick gift for a friend. EXCELLENT !!

This was a fun recipe to tweak a little bit and the changes I made were awesome.  First, I used 12 tbsp organic cocoa powder with 3 tbsp veg oil in place of the choc squares as another reviewer had suggested.  Worked lovely.  Then, I decided to make the brownies a bit more 'cakey', and added an extra 1/2 cup flour plus 1/2 cup milk.  The texture is still chewy like a brownie, but has a touch of a cake feel to it as well, very nice.  I also used only 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar, instead of 2.  The sweetness is perfect, and also saves on some carbs.    I've never made brownies before, but these worked out so well that I'll definitely make them again!

I found it!!!! Finally a recipe from scratch that is fudgy and has a great texture.  Thank you!  This recipe is not cakey at all it is chewy and chocolaty yum! Great with vanilla ice cream or alone.  I did substitute 12 TBSP of cocoa powder plus the extra oil for the chocolate squares just because I didn't have any available.  I also omitted the nuts for the same reason.  Wonderful brownies, look no further!

Nice simple recipe. We glazed these with a concoction of mint hot-cocoa mix, melted butter, milk, and confectioner's sugar, and they were delicious!

tastefull. I followed someone advice about cutting down sugar to 1 1/2 cup and increasingvanilla to 2 tsp. Family's decision: it's a keeper ! Cutting down on the sugar made it  pleasantly, and not over-whelmingly sweet.

These are great and very simple!  Never had a problem with them sticking.  It is the same recipe that comes with bakers chocolate squares.

This is the best! It's so easy and I love that I don't have to messy up any other dishes. All I had was cocoa powder so I used that instead. It turned out so chocolaty, soft and chewy. Oh, and the only kind of flour I had was self rising flower. I don't think it raised at all actually...strange.

I would give this 6 stars if I could, just for how easy and fast they are to make!  I used the cocoa and oil method.  The texture is nice and chewy, just like I like them!

Great Brownies! I heavily sprayed pan with olive oil spray and had no problems with sticking. I added the nuts and a handful of chocolate chips. Too sweet for our taste so I will cut sugar by half next time. It's a keeper!

We added  about a 1/4 of a cup of white chocolate chips and  some homeade chocolate frosting on top because at first they smelled like they were not sweet enough . Then after we took them out of the oven although  we cooked them for 40 min. Then we cooled them for approx. 20 min.  We cut them and added frosting.We ended up having to scoop the "brownies " out with a large ladle. These brownies were good but like a chocolate heaven and them were chocolate mush. Nobody can have another one because they are soooo chocolately . Now we call them Brownie MUSH.

This was a good recipe. I used 3/4 cup of cocoa instead of the squares. I like my brownies to be a little moist so I only put in 3/4 cup of flour. I also like them a bit sweeter so I added 1/4 cup of sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp of salt. They come out really moist.

This recipe is amazing. It's so easy and yet unbelievably delicious. My husband LOVES these, although he's not a big fan of chocolate. I made this many times for friends and colleagues, and they absolutely adore them.

I really wanted to like this recipe but I was very disappointed with the results. My 10 yr old daughter wanted to bake brownies for her class b/c she was nominated for student council. I chose this b/c of the simplicity and the reviews. However the final product was not as good as I'd hoped. You could taste the sugar in the brownie, also they weren't very chocolately and didn't have the color shown in the pic. Although, the texture was great in the brownies I could salvage (they stuck to the side of the pan--I had to literally scrape them off). The 2nd batch I added foil as suggested and was able to remove them easily but still, they had a baked sugar taste w/out much "chocolate" taste. Maybe the cocoa and oil many users suggested would help. If I try this recipe again I will definately cut the sugar and add cocoa.

The texture on these is great-- nice and chewy-moist with just enough crunch on the outside, but I'm afraid I didn't really find the flavor too outstanding. It kind of fell flat compared to many other brownie recipes I've tried. But it is good for a quick recipe, I'll give it that! :)

These brownies are fantastic.  I have made plenty of different brownie recipes and this is by far the absolute best.   Like others, I had to use cocoa powder and oil.  And I didn't have any nuts, so I threw in some swirled chocolate chips.   These brownies are simply amazing.  I may have undercooked them just a bit, but it's better to undercook than overcook!   2 thumbs up from me!

I am dairy and soy free since my nursing baby has those allergies. So I have to use cocoa powder, canola oil, and dairy/soy free margarine for this recipe. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't stupendous either. Which is perfectly fine for me since I haven't had brownies in 4 months! I will have to look for a better recipe though.

Hey! This is the same recipe on the back of the Baker's unsweetend baking chocolate squares! I thought you weren't allowed to do that...  But, I have to admit, these brownies are absolutely delicious, although a little more cakey than I would have excpected.

My first time making brownies from scratch and they were very good.  I also used Pam and parchment paper, no problem getting them out.  I also cut sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was an amaaaazing brownie! I halved it and made it in an 8x8 pan, except that it came out a little bit too thin, but me and my friends liked it just fine that way! It was very easy to make, especially the one-bowl deal! I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I didn't add the walnuts, and they came out perfect without them anyway.

These are the prefect brownies, to avoid sticking I just use a cilacone pan that way it is very easy to get them out. They make a great bottom to a cheesecake!

this recipe is so easy you won't even need to refer to it after you make it once or twice.  My kids love these.  You can cut back on the sugar if you want (I use 1 1/2 cups) and it will not be missed.

These turned out really great! It was crisp outside but really moist on the inside even hours after baking. If you have a sweet tooth like me I would suggest adding 2 more squares of chocolate. Also don't forget to sift your flour. My good buddy also wants to put in that you can add nuts, chcolate chips, caramel chips to tweak it up a bit :)

This are perfect! I've been looking for a recipe that tastes like boxed brownies, only better. I'm not a fan of cake brownies, these are definitely fudgey. The first time I even messed up the recipe and only added half the butter, but they turned out absolutely perfect, so I'll continue to do that to have a lower fat version. The second time they were good, but I overbaked, so make sure you keep an eye on them.

Always my stand by brownie recipe - though I skip the microwave and bowl and do it all in a saucepan on the stove and pour it right into the dish. Fantastic every time. I usually get creative and add chocolate chips (any kind) when you throw in the walnuts. AWESOME!

Okay, first & foremost:  Make sure you read your ingredient list... I must've forgotten how when I was making this.  UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE, not Semi-Sweet.  I did, as normal, cut the sugar by half cup.  So, though these were texturally perfect, they were FAR TOO SWEET. DH & Kids, of course, loved them - but if given the opportunity, they'd eat sugar by the spoonful...

This recipe is awesome! I've made it about five or six times now, and they never last more than 3 days. I also use the cocoa/oil substitute. A few varations: Pour half of batter in pan, sprinkle chopped up Reese's peanut butter cups, then pour the rest of the batter over the cups, spreading so that the cups are covered. Bake as directed - delicious! I also tried it with chopped Snickers, and it came out alright, but not as good as the Reese's. Also, make sure you foil and grease the pan - I made the mistake the first time of foiling but not greasing - what a mess! This one is definitely a keeper!

I used 6oz semi-sweet chocolate chips and substituted 1cup of [swiss] mueseli instead of the nuts to make it more chewy. I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of the 2 cups that the recipe called for, and it turned out moist, chewy and not so sweet! Good for those who are weight conscious but still need dessert!

Well, i don't think I'll be buying boxed mixes anymore...this recipe is so simple, & so quick-I wanted brownies for the Superbowl & didn't have a mix on hand- this definately did the trick! I absolutely LOVE brownies, and these did not disappoint! Definately put foil in the pan & spray w/ Pam-that way they don't stick. If you're looking for a rich, fudgy brownie, this is it!

This is my first time to ever make home made browines and so I tried this because I had everything it took and they are really easy to make and very good.  The only thing I think I will try different next time is cut back on the sugar a little bit.  It was a touch to sweet for me but that is just a personal preference.

Most amazing brownies.  I used Godiva dark chocolate finely choped and pecans rather than walnuts. Topped with a milk chocolate frosting made with Hershey bars and heavy cream.  Outrageously good.

Great converter to gluten-free!  Way better than a mix, this brownie recipe worked really well when I made it gluten-free by using bean & rice flours.  The flavor was fabulous, and the smooth texture just melted in our mouths!  I sprinkled the top with chocolate chips just for an extra punch of chocolate.  This is my forever brownie recipe!

My first review! I've been using all recipes for years but never reviewed. This brownie recipe was that awesome! I had to substitute a few  things just b/c I didnt have all of the ingredients it called for. Instead of all purpose flour I used whole wheat flour and I didnt have any chocolate squares so I used 12 tablespoons of cocoa powder. I also didnt have any walnuts so I mixed in some chocolate chips and sprinkled some more on top while it was still in the oven before the top was crusty. I think my whole wheat flour kept it from being too chocolatey. But still fantastic!

I just made these for my very pick family and they all ravished them. I did do a few alterations. 1. I did the 12 TBS Cocoa with the 3 TBS oil as previously mentioned, I also added 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  My husband is a chocoholic. :) My kids loved them as well as my husband. This recipe was easy ans delicious I will be using it often. One more thing we also let them cool then cut, and then warmed slightly in the microwave added one scoop of vanilla ice cream and some hot fudge and caramel.. (ala mode) YUMMY. Thank you for sharing.

These were mediocre at best.  They weren't very chocolaty at all.  I halved the recipe twice and made a tiny batch as I always do with new recipes (following it exactly), because I dont want to waste ingredients on a bad recipe.  I also did this with Brookes Best Bombshell Brownies at the same time (last night) and had a little taste test.  There wasn't even a moments hesitation when my boyfriend and I decided that Brookes Brownies were a million times better.  I was fooled by the picture for this recipe... because it looks like this recipe will make amazing brownies... but it doesn't... TRUST ME!  Plus Brookes Brownies are half the fat of these ones!!!!!

It's rather sweet and rich, but that just means you need to eat it with milk (or ice cream!)!  This recipe is way better than the boxed kind.  One of my daughters refuses to eat the boxed brownies, but really liked these.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I used Chocolate syrup instead of the chocolate bars and I also had to cook them in an 8x8 baking dish for a longer time. The coloring was a little light, but the result was AMAZING!!....I will make this recipe again!

These were really good, even after I cut back on the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups, and the margarine to only 1/2 cup.  It doesn't exactly make them good for you, but every little bit helps!  I frosted these with the Chocolate Frosting I from this site for the familys' portion.  Definitely the easiest brownie recipe aside from a box mix.  I am testing my way through all the brownie recipes on AR, but am sure I will come back to this one.

I altered this recipe so that I could have a lighter, moist brownie-like the kind you buy from a coffee shop. I did this by adding 1/4 milk and a total of 1.5 cup flour. I think this recipe is a little simplified in terms of the mixing instructions. It's not good practice to just dump everything together. I could mix eggs, sugar, milk and vanilla together. Then, melt the butter in a microwave and stir cocoa into it (the cocoa melts super easily). After combining my "egg mixture" with my "cocoa mixture," I fold in the flour until smooth. I fancy icing so I would add chocolate icing after it bakes. I needed 25 min. to bake it.

YUM!! Perfect brownies.  I will never bake brownies from a box ever again.  I too used cocoa powder and oil.  I also only used 1 stick (1/2 c.) butter and 2 eggs.  These brownies are too good for words, and the one bowl just makes them even better.

Absolutely Delicious. I used german cocoa powder and oil instead of baking chocolate. It turned out great, especially warm with chocolate and caramel frosting. However, I was thinking of tweaking the recipe a little bit to replace some of the butter to make it healthier.

I too had to sub the cocoa powder and oil in this recipe and I don't think that it made any difference. I doubled this recipe for my son's birthday party and only used 3 cups of sugar, which I did half and half w/ the brown & white sugars. I also added in a bag of chocolate chips. I thought they were good, but he wasn't impressed. He thought they needed more chocolate and sugar, which may be my fault as I cut out a cup of sugar to save some calories. They are more of a dense, adult brownie I think as opposed to the sticky sweet box mixes that my kiddos seem to love. I cut them in triangles so that I could stand them up next to a scoop of ice cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup on a plate. They make a nice presentation because they don't crumble.

These were ok.  I added a tsp of salt and perhaps that was too much. I think these would be much better made in a 9x9 pan... they were pretty thin and got crist as they cooled.  Perhaps with a little tweaking, these would be great.

These were great and SO easy!  I changed the recipe slightly.  Since i made a half batch, i used 2 eggs (hard to use 1.5 eggs) and eliminated the nuts.  I also added a 1/2 tsp (or less) of baking powder.  This made the brownies very slighly cakey.  As my husband described it, they were the perfect balance between fudgey and cakey.  Everyone at the dinner party raved about them!  So in short, i recommend adding an extra egg and a pinch of baking powder!

To the world traveler who wants to carry few extra ingredients and use what may be available, this IS the best recipe.  It's easy and impressive.  Great hot or cold and amazing as a base with ice cream and hot fudge.
I do substitute cocoa all the time and it comes out perfect every time. You do have to incorporate the ingredients in order.
Also, when they are best they don't jiggle in the middle and the top is hard glazed.  When they test done by conventional methods, they are overdone and will be dry.  That also means they don't need the amount of time set in the recipe - 5-10 minutes less even when I doubled the recipe.

I live in Estonia and it is hard to find good cocoa powder. I love this recipe because I don't need it. I don't have a microwave so I double boiled the chocolate and butter and added the sugar while it was hot. I cooled it before adding the egg so they wont scramble. I found my brownie recipe. Thanks! NOTE: Try using baking paper so they won't stick and put them in an airtight container after cooled. If you leave them out of course they will get hard.

I tried making this for the first time a couple weeks ago. It went together smoothly, but when they came out of the oven, they definitely weren't right. The top was dull and covered with popped bubbles instead of a nice flaky light brown the way brownies usually are. The taste was off, too - kind of flat. I couldn't think of anything I'd done wrong, but I haven't done a lot of baking on my own so I figured I screwed up something and decided to give it another try later.

Fast forward to today, and I was trying again. As I was getting the ingredients out, I was holding the box of butter and thought to myself "there's no way this package can be just 1 cup". See, I'd been assuming that each of the sticks in a 1-pound package of butter was 1/4 cup. An easy conclusion to jump to since it seems so logical for 1/4 of the package to be 1/4 of a cup :) But a quick glance at the wrapper on a stick showed me that each stick is indeed 1/2 cup - I'd put in 1 1/2 cups last time instead of 3/4! Oops.

Made with the correct amount of butter this time (1 and 1/2 sticks), they came out *perfect*. Crisp top and moist inside, just the way a brownie should be.

Though DH is a serious choco-holic, I am not terribly fond of chocolate overall. These brownies, which I whipped up one night when I, myself was craving something chocolate(LOL),are my absolute favorite ever and I make them often. (DH loves them as well.) 

It's necessary to use the foil, and makes them ever so much easier to cut. I don't bother greasing the foil, however, I just give it a good shot of cooking spray.

For a thicker brownie, use an 8X11 pan and bake for 5 minutes longer than the recipe states. They won't seem "done" in the middle but they'll keep cooking after they're out of the oven. Oh my. YUM!

VERY easy!  These have a nice flavor, but mine were not as soft and chewy as I like, but I give 5 stars because my sons (ages 11 and 6) ate every last one and then asked for more.

kind of a disappointment. I think the baking time is a little long on these (35min on recipe).. I only baked for 30 minutes, and they were already well done. These were alright.. but not the best brownies I've ever had. I like really rich, chewy and dense brownies. These were kind of dry. I would not make again.

I followed the recipe exactly (used whole wheat flour instead of bleached flour though).  brownies came out very gooey and tasted like nothing but sugar.  I baked them for an extra 25 minutes but they were still "undercooked".

I followed the recipe exactly, and used the foil method suggested by several for the pan, but we weren't really impressed with these.  I'm going to keep trying other recipes for brownies.

Not a big fan of these but I'm used to those amazing two bite brownies that you buy at the grocery store.  I only had semi sweet chocolate so I used less sugar.  I'm going to keep searching for the perfect brownie recipe.

The first thing I did wrong was misread the ingredients and I only added 1oz of chocolate instead of 4oz so they came out very light brown. They also stuck to the bottom of my pan and were a tad crumbly. This time, I used the recommended amount of  chocolate and baked them on the lower rack for half of the time. They came out perfect! Although the first batch was less than perfect, they were gone in two days. These taste so good, I don't think I am going to share!! My husband does prefer cake like brownies so he is not a huge fan of these, although he did eat three :)

Amazing! Absolutely foolproof. Lots of chocolatey taste. I would maybe bake them a little less than the 35 minutes next time and maybe leave out the nuts, but my mum loved the nuts, and she's the brownie expert!

As always, this came out fudgey and good. Not too gooey in the middle. You have to watch them like a hawk when you bake them. Your oven temperature must be accurate (get an oven thermometer). There's a point when the middle is set nicely and the edges are crispy. If your oven temp is right, this will be between thirty and thirty five minutes. I know it sounds like work, but having your oven temp set properly will help with almost all baking recipes. Mine was off by almost fifty degrees! 

New ovens have the ability to adjust the oven temp. It's in the owners manual.

I didn't care for these very much.  Too sweet, not enough chocolate.  I even cut the sugar by 1/4 cup, added an extra oz. of chocolate, and 2 T. of chocolate powder, and they still weren't very good.

Disaster for me.  Used semi-sweet chocolate-- result was a light brown cake unfortunately.  And after the recommended 35 minutes, brownie was still so raw.  Maybe will try again since this gets such rave reviews.

These are delicious. I baked them just shy of 35 minutes and they came out just the way our family likes brownies. These don't have baking powder, so are very fudgy! I added a pinch of salt and left out the nuts.

I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this - maybe it's because I used unsalted butter - but these tasted flat to me!  Otherwise very good; next time (there will be a next time) I'll add a tsp. of salt.

Good but I think it needs less sugar & more chocolate. I used pam and a dusting of cocoa powder to prevent sticking. I removed it and cut it up when it was still warm. No problems.

I added a 1/4 cup of milk and flour to make them more cakelike. The box says to add 1/2 cup each. I also added 1 cup white chocolate chips. Yum! great recipe, will definitely use again. Can't wait for my boyfriend to get home and try it.

Pretty good, I skipped the walnuts, and I think my baking pan was too big, as they ended up really thin.  Couldn't get them out of the pan easily but I think coconut oil spray really is not getting the job done when it comes to greasing the pan.

The best brownie recipe in my mind!! I also used 22tbs of cocoa and 3tbs of olive oil instead of he baking chocolate. I also was out of normal cocoa one day and used dark chocolate cocoa powder instead and holy guacamole!! I discovered the secret to really adding more chocolate flavor - I sub out dark chocolate in most of my recipes now!!

I used cocoa and oil instead of chocolate and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  It only needed 25 minutes and was absolutely perfect and delicious.  35 minutes would have been way too long.  Brownies should always be slightly undercooked.

These were easy to do and have a texture and taste of box mix. The Kraft website says to cook them for 50 minutes for a 9 x 9 pan.  But they were burned in the bottom and sides at 45 minutes.

Worst Brownies? 
I followed the recipe and even double it because it tasted so good! I followed baking instrustions then forked it when the time was up at 35 Mins. My fork came out clean but upon serving I discovered a gooey mess inside. 
It was almost like I got something wrong and maybe didnt account for doubling the recipe? So I shoved them back in the oven and waited 15 Mins more. Still the same. I wasted so many precious ingredients on something thats more a sugar blob than brownies!!

Followed recipe except added a little extra baker's chocolate.  Not nearly chocolately enough.  They will likely go in the trash and I won't make them again... a waste of ingredients and an hour!

Same recipe as on Baker's unsweetened squares package.  Almost the same as Granny's on here except Granny's uses brown sugar.  These got the "brownie job"done, but I wasn't wow-ed.  I used one less egg & one less T butter  = more like brownies, less like cake.

Followed recipe EXACTLY and they are extremely sweet, inedible sweet.  Really confused as how everyone said they're the best ever.  I even went to the dishwasher to check the size of my sugar measuring cup to make sure I made them correctly. 
Odd.

These looked really good but they are way too sweet. I thought this was a recipe I used to make years ago, but I don't think it is the correct recipe. I think the recipe I am looking for was on the box of Hershey's baking chocolate. 

Some people said they used less sugar the second time but this recipe was so sweet, I am not sure that would help. The sweetness seemed to clash with the chocolate, making them have an off taste. 

Will continue looking for the perfect crunchy top, chewy brownies.

I LOVE these brownies. They are my new go-to's! However, I did make a few changes. I used 1 1/3 cups of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar in place of the 2 cups of white sugar, and upped the vanilla to 2 tsp. I added 1/4 tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to make them rise just a tiny bit. Also, I greased the pan with shortening  first then put a dusting of cocoa powder (instead of flour) so the bottoms of the brownies wouldn't be white. No sticking at all! Cooked mine for about 28/29 minutes, and they were beautifully chewy but still held their shape. LOVED!!!

Best brownie recipe I've ever tried. I made one batch with nuts and another without, and both were amazing, dense, and moist.


Instead of using greased foil to keep the brownies from sticking,  grease the pan with butter then powder it with coco powder.

Great brownies! Read the reviews and was very happy some substituted powdered baking chocolate for the squares. The only other change I made, using a quarter cup of coconut oil for the vegetable/canola oil. This gave a hint of coconut to the brownies.

Oh my this is so good...I did use the chocolate squares, plus right before I poured the mix into the pan, I swirled about 1/4 cup peanut butter. These are so rich and moist. I am eating it right now still warm.  

This is so much better than the box...by far. I was looking to make something with chocolate with what I had on hand.  I did use margarine in place of butter...Delish...yum yum.  I cooked them about 5 minutes less and it was perfect.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This is my go-to brownie recipe. I generally forgo the nuts (personal preference), but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. These are perfectly chewy, in my opinion - not cakey, and not fudgy, with the perfect amount of chocolate. Love these!

great recepie for gooey NOT cakey brownies.  I used parchment paper sprayed with a bit of olive oil and they were perfect.  No mess, easy to pull out of the pan and cut.  Great with ice cream or on their own.  Crisp around the edges and top with a gooey soft center and bottom.

Pretty wonderful when they came out of the oven. After a day or two, they were getting kind of crusty, but they were still great. A little too rich for me, but otherwise delish.

I subbed out the unsweetened chocolate squares for semisweet chocolate chips, and left out the nuts, and the flavour turned out ok, but it was waaaay soft on the inside - more like cake than a brownie.  If I try these again I'll cook them in individual muffin things instead of one pan and maybe they'll come out better.

No more box mix brownies. Hooray! This is a very forgiving recipe. For someone who always insists on scratch baking, I am addicted to box mix brownies. Every time I've made brownies from scratch they're too cake-y and dry. Last night I had a brownies craving and made these, even tho I only had 2 extra large eggs.  I cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (something I usually do when baking) and reduced the flour to 3/4 cup. I baked them in an 8x8 pan for 55 min. These were slightly cakier than I like but it was expected due to lacking the 3rd egg. Everyone has a different opinion on the perfect brownie, but this recipe has what it takes for me: crispy, chewy edges and fudgy but firm middle. And ya gotta go with pecans. Looking forward to trying this as written in the future.

These were all that and a bag of chips.  I added a cup of chopped 75% chocolate bits; I found the full cup of nuts to be a bit too much, but only in looks, in the taste it did not seem to overwhelm.  I may cut them in half next time and see.  They are dense, rich, thick, and moist.  I took them to a dinner invitation and well, I was not allowed to bring any back home!  :)

This recipe has so many problems, I'm surprised that anyone likes it. Overly sweet even after I cut it down by 1/3 cup. Very oily, it looked like it was frying(and it was) while it was baking. There just anything positive I can say about these at all. The flavor is lacking. As others have stated the bottom is barely cooked while the edges are hard. Even in the mini muffin tin they didn't cook through correctly. Very disappointed.

Not very chocolatey.  Also, did NOT stick to pan at all.  I used spray coconut oil.  I won't make this again.

Great!  Did the cocoa powder/oil sub too and added salt..everything needs salt!  Otherwise, they are great and easy.  My brownie Holy Grail.

These aren't the best brownies I've made, but they were pretty easy for ones made from scratch. They were a tad on the dry side, and too cake-like and lacked that fudgy brownie-ness. I didn't use nuts, and instead used mini m&ms. I think some brownie frosting will help. Thanks for the recipe.. If I don't have a box mix on hand and want a quick easy brownie, I'll try these again :)

Really great recipe. Just awesome. :) The perfect bake time, however, is 50 minutes. In my experiences, brownies always need to be cooked longer than the recommended bake time. Just saying. Other than that though, awesome. Just... awesome.

This is my go-to brownie recipe now.  They're super easy and delicious; I usually add in chocolate chips.  They seem to taste better on the second day rather than right out of the oven for whatever reason.

I thought that these were fantastic!! They were so so simple to make and I find I don't have much time for baking anymore but now I know if I have 7 min I can make fresh brownies from stractch. THANK YOU!!
As for changes, I didn't really change much I just am not a fan of nuts so I replaced the nuts with chocolate chips. 
so my advice, take 10 min let the kids help and enjoy!!

A great recipe indeed!  Used 3/4 c cocoa powder and 3T veg oil with remaining recipe ingredients (except nuts)!  Baked for 27 mins in 9 x 13 glass pan lined with baking paper.  EASY to take out of pan.  Once cool, place brownies on cutting board and slice away!  This is my go-to recipe when I need to take something to a gathering in which I need to bring a dish to share.  All ingredients are staples in my house. Topped with powdered sugar.  (For nicer uniform presentation on a platter, trim off the crusty edges and enjoy eating them yourself!)

The brownies are dense, which is something I like, but they were too sweet. Not sure where I went wrong, so I'll look elsewhere next time.

This is my new go-to brownie recipe!  I used a different size pan though and had to bake a little longer and the middle wasn't completely done but I took them out so they wouldn't get hard.  Next time I will have to reduce the temperature and cook a little longer because I wanted thicker brownies.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and they were great!

Scrumptious! I wanted to make something quick for my neighbor's birthday but I didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand. I knew she loved chocolate and I did have a package of unsweetened chocolate squares. I did a quick search on allrecipes.com (always my favorite go-to recipe site) and found this simple recipe. With the help of my 8 year old son we quickly whipped them up & with the suggestion of another reviewer made the "fudge frosting" to go with them. To die for! I used non-stick foil in the pan and didn't have any problems with sticking. Will definitely make these again!

These were good.  They were extremely rich and sweet.  We had to use cocoa powder and oil, since we didn't have the unsweetened chocolate squares.  I also added semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the walnuts, which could have attributed for the extra richness.  One brownie makes you feel very, very sinful. ;-)

I like this recipe very much. Its simple yet different enough to make brownies taste so good I couldn't belive it! I didn't put any walnuts since I don't like them in my brownies, and instead of putting 2 cups of white sugar I put 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar (i was all out of white) and I will from now always use this recipe.  Jody... You really know how to bake!

I have used this recipe LOTS of times and absolutely LOVE it!!  Just the other day I added raspberries after putting the batter into the pan and they were even MORE divine!!!  Also added 3 T of cocoa powder just because and only use 1 cup of raw cane sugar and wheat flour.  SUPERB recipe!!!

I have been searching in vain for a scratch brownie recipe that tastes as good as a mix. This isn't it. The recipe was easy and the brownies were fine, but a little "sharp" tasting. I'm going to try making them with cocoa rather than the unsweetened chocolate and see if that makes a difference.

GREAT brownies!  I made them with my 11 yo son and it was very easy & tasted very good.  I did end up using 5oz of chocolate because what good is having 1 oz of bakers chocolate left over??  I also added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar to compensate for the added bakers chocolate.  Had some heavy cream so I made some whipped cream to top the brownies.  BIG HIT!  Everyone loved them!

These were AMAZING. I wanted something a bit more chocolaty to satisfy my intense craving, so I added 2 TBS cocoa powder along with 1 cup dark chocolate chips in place of the walnuts. Also, I replaced the regular flour with GLUTEN FREE flour mix ("Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Mix") and it is SO chocolaty, I could only eat one. I loved how adaptable it was to being gluten-free! I am pleased to say this will now be my "go-to" brownie recipe. Huzzah!

We loved these brownies.  I used a suggestion by someone else and used 3/4 cup cocoa and 1/4 canola oil instead of the choc. squares.  Baked them in a perfect brownie pan I received for Christmas at 350 for 40 minutes. They are perfect. A little sweet but I love sugar so no problem.

First time making this recipe. I also substituted cocoa powder and margarine as I rarely have unsweetened chocolate.  Brownie dough was stiff and gritty like it needed some milk.  My husband and I won't be using this recipe again.

These are great brownies and  recipe is like one mom gave me except you melted the butter and chocolate in baking pan in the oven, no microwaves in the 60's, & mixed in rest of ingredients in the pan. Then when the brownies came out of the oven she immediately covered the top  with chocolate chips and as the chips melted spread them like frosting.

Pretty good brownies.  Increased the amount of chocolate just for that good gooey taste.  Came out pretty good and enjoyed with homemade ice cream.

I think I'll go with a different recipe next time.  Certainly not the best I have had (I still ate them thou!).  I did the cocoa/oil as I had no chocolate on hand & added a bit more flour.  I'd keep the extra flour out next time. They kept REALLY well in the fridge.

I guess I am not a fan of unsweetened chocolate. Even with the 2 cups of sugar the recipe calls for, I couldn't get that bitter taste out of my mouth after biting into the brownie for the "taste test". The foil trick did work, however. Line the pan with foil, grease with butter, then sprinkle some flour before adding the batter to the pan. No sticking here!

Made these last night but only had dark chocolate chips.  Next time I will cut down the sugar if I'm using the chips as it was too sweet.  Great recipe though and the first time I've ever done brownies from scratch!  I'm at work now and I just know when I get home, hubby and daughter will have them gone!

I made this that week and substituted cocoa powder for the chocolate squares and topped the brownies with sliced almonds before I put them in the oven.  They turned out wonderfully soft and fluffy! Everyone loves them. Even after a week, they were soft and moist, especially after microwaving for about 30-40 seconds.  Will be coming back to this simple recipe in the future.

These are incredible. I'm a high school teacher and my kids and absolutely loved them, as well as my husband. Delicious! I used bittersweet chocolate instead of non-sweetened, and maple syrup instead instead of vanilla.

Simply awesome. Even though I, oke other users, did adjust the recipe somewhat, these turned out awesome. I doubled the receipe (we have five children) but also cut the sugar in half. Like someone else, I did half brown sugar, half white. Really, really good. Good enough that I will only be making the normal batch now so we've got no choice but to eat only two or three each!

These were so easy to make and they taste so yummy.  I used another reviewers mixture of cocoa and oil as opposed to the baking choc and did everything else according to the recipe.  We love it.

This is how brownies are supposed to taste like-- Delicious! The other day I was feeling guilty about eating the last of the store brownies my Daughter made and I made another brownie recipe and it tasted like not so good tasting cake. These taste like really good fudgie brownies. I couldn't resist and added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Alright, I followed the recipe to the tee. They took much longer to cook. They are very chewy, however not very chocolaty. These are good if you want a mild chocolate brownie that is good and chewy. I found them a little greasy to. I really had my hopes up for a good brownie. I might try to alter, but right now, I will just keep looking though. Sorry :( Thanks though.

These were really easy and much better tasting than the recipe my MIL has in her family cookbook... I like my brownies to be chocolately and these were perfect... Next time, I'll try them with a better chocolate, I only had Baker's chocolate but I think a better brand of chocolate would only make them better...

The brownies were pretty good, but I found them too sweet for my taste. However my teenage son and nephew said they were perfect. I would like to try them again using a darker chocolate. I also found them a little too greasy and more fudgy than I normally care for(I usually prefer fudgy brownies), so I'll try adding 1/4 cup of flour to the mix. Since it sticks so much, I would simply line the pan with parchment paper next. Altogether it is a very good brownie recipe. I would make them again in a heartbeat! In fact, I'm making another batch tomorrow with the changes.

I loved this recipe and my family loved them. My sister doesn't have a microwave so I used the 12 to 3 ratio for coco powder and vegetable oil also instead of butter or margarine I used the same amount of vegetable oil and I also used half coco powder and a darker type of coco powder and it made them like a dark chocolate brownie and they were AWESOME!! I sprinkled confectioners sugar on them and my family helped eat almost the whole pan. Only thing I would do different is grease the pan better because i had to almost chisel them out. I am defiantly saving this recipe!

The taste is pretty good, but these brownies are very flat and it was difficult to tell when they were done baking. Next time I will use a smaller pan and monitor the cooking time more closely.

Ok, well if they only looked like the photo I wouldn't have been so confused. First I have to say mine were not brown and they were pretty flat. I was really careful not to overbake but it was hard to judge right because of the flatness. I followed the time guide lines and if I make again I will try the cocoa powder/ oil mix. But, having said that I am glad this recipe has worked for so many others. I guess I'm going to have to practice making brownies more often. ♥

I had a craving for some brownies, but these didn't hit the spot. They are indeed quite sticky, but besides that to me there was way too much sugar. It overpowered the chocolate in my opinion. Only thing I changed was substituting choc chips for nuts.

These were all right- not overly impressive. They were easy, I'll give them that much. I topped mine with peanut butter frosting and Reese's PB cups, and it made them much better.

Followed the recipe exactly. They came out a little too "fudgy" but I was using them for brownie ice cream sundaes. They are perfect for that. :)

In theory, it's a good recipe, but when I made it, I don't think it turned out like it was supposed to. I think it was my fault though, because for the chocolate, I used a large, about 4 oz. hershey's chocolate bar. I also used a person's sugg. for a more cake-like brownie. I think next time, I will follow the recipe to a T, and see how it turns out. Mine came out barely edible. they were perfectly cooked, but they were a strange light brown tan color instead of dark brown, and they were dry, and the flavor wasn't very good at all. I think this has more to do with my prep than the recipe being bad. I'll just have to try again. :)

Not quite the best.  They were sweet but lacked enough chocolate flavor.  I made another batch with one more chocolate square and they were much better, better than from a box.  They were a bit difficult to handle without falling apart.  I recommend serving them directly from a nice baking dish.

Sorry, these are a no go for me.  I much prefer Ghiradelli box mix.    They were easy, though.

Very easy recipe.I substituted the unsweetened chocolate for semi sweet chocolate chips due to not having any unsweetened chocolate in the house and added 5 minutes to the cooking time and they were fabulous!

I was looking for a simple recipe for fudge-like brownies and this is it for sure! I cannot imagine how you can mess this one up.  This will be my brownie recipe from now on for sure!  Thanks!

These brownies are EXCELLENT! They're fudgey and chewy like brownies should be! The only minor change that I made was reduce the amount of sugar from 2 cups to 1 and 1/2 cups, because they seemed too sweet. Otherwise, they're great! Also, for extra fudginess just add some more chocolate chips!

These were very good, but turned out with an odd texture, which may have been my fault, I'm not sure. I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, added an extra ounce of chocolate and a half-teaspoon of salt, so the flavor was great. But they turned out neither cakey nor fudgy -- just sort of crumbly, but not at all dry. Very weird, never had anything turn out like that. I did use only two eggs, to insure fudginess, so maybe that's the problem. Of course, I live in Denver, so I could just blame the altitude! Anyway, I think these are fast and great-tasting, and worth tinkering with if they don't work out for you the first time.

We wanted something sweet after dinner, but didn't want to make a huge mess, so I did a search for a "one bowl" type of dessert. This one was super easy, and we had all of the ingredients on hand. I still think that brownies from a mix are the best, but this really makes a good, rich brownie. I only baked it for 27 minutes, because we love our brownies severely underbaked. Yum!

These brownies are the BEST homemade brownies I've ever tried. I don't usually buy baking squares, so I substituted with cocoa  & oil (dark dutch processed cocoa is the best!) I baked them for only 30 min. so they came out chewy (I leave out the nuts for my picky boys). They come out drier looking than "box" brownies ON TOP (no shiny, crackly appearance), so you'd think they would be drier inside, but they're not! With a thin layer of choc. or vanilla frosting or ganache, and nuts, choc. chips or sprinkles on top and they're the greatest! I've made them and brought them as a dessert on 2 occasions in the past month and got many great reviews!

I did not have the baking chocolate squares so I used the cocoa powder/oil instead, and followed the recipe as is.  The brownies turned out pretty good - just a tad bit dry for my taste.  But, very chocolaty and yummy!  I am getting ready to make another batch right now!

These were good.  I found that they turned out a little dry so the second time I mad them I cooked less and put in a smaller pan.  That way they were thicker and more moist.

This recipe failed to deliver.  Being an especially picky brownie connoisseur I was utterly disappointed.  They weren't chocolaty enough, the texture/density was way off and the appearance was also off.  I followed the directions thoroughly mixed every thing by hand and used the best ingredients.  I ended up with slightly denser cake squares.  They tasted ok but were definitely not a keeper.  I gave it three stars since the cake squares tasted ok and because I'm much pickier than most people.  If you are picky too move on this recipe is not for you.

This was my first time making brownies from scratch, so I got confused by the chocolate requirement. I read it as 1 ounce TOTAL, not four 1-ounce squares! I used 1oz. equivalent of cocoa powder/oil, and skipped the nuts. Fortunately, they still came out pretty good, as a moist and slightly chocolate-flavored brownie. They also baked in about 27 minutes, and I had no problems with sticking-I had buttered and floured the pan a lot. I'll definitely try it again with the proper amount of chocolate.

After I baked my brownies, I went back to my copy of the recipe and looked on this website to make sure I had copied it right.  I did....there was too much butter and these brownies were the WORST ones I have ever made!  My chocoholic husband wouldn't even eat them...They crumbled and were just ugly to even look at!

Used the cocoa/oil combo instead of the melted chocolate.  Added some chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Next time I'll just ust peanut butter chips or even some butterscotch chips.  Great basic recipe. YUM!

These were really good, chocolaty, moist, fudgy brownies. A real crowd please. The only problem I had was cutting them; the top had kind of a hard crust and so it just crushed and cracked around the knife. Otherwise very nice, I'll definitely make again.

I was going to give this a 4.  But then I tried getting the rest out of the pan, and ran into problems.  The taste is pretty good - not as chocolaty as I usu make (I was out of ingred for my usu recipe), but still tasted good.  However, they didn't come out and off the spatula w/o falling apart easily.  And the outer edges of the pan are still in my pan, impenetrable by my knife.  All that said, my kids thoroughly enjoyed them, and I am sure my hubby will when he gets home!  The un-cuttable edges are the reason I rated down.  sorry!

Very easy to make and yummy to eat!  My only issue with this recipe is that it calls for a very large pan, which made the brownies a bit thin.  Next time, I will use a smaller pan to make fatter brownies!

Nice and chewy.  I used the cocoa/oil substitute for the chocolate squares, used plenty of butter and cocoa to grease the pan, and had no problems with sticking as other reviewers have mentioned.

The cooking time of 35 minutes seemed long to me, and indeed my brownies came out really hard around the edges and a little too chewy in the middle. I think they would have been fantastic if they weren't overcooked. I didn't have any problem with sticking, I used foil and a generous shot of PAM in my nonstick pan. I think they could use a pinch of salt and baking powder. Although I like them fudgey, I think a tad of baking powder would make them a little lighter. Also the recipe doesn't make that much batter so a 9x13 pan is a little large. I might increase the recipe by 1/4 next time.

the brownies came out very tasty! thanks for the recipe! i, however, used cocoa powder instead of the chocolate squares. but i think i used dutch-process. would it change much if i use natural cocoa powder the next time? thanks!!!

There's nothing brown about these brownies unless you add cocoa powder.  I added mini choc. chips to mine because I didn't want to disappoint my kids ; they were looking for "BROWNIES".  Doubtful that I will make these again.

Wow , this was an excellent recipe.. although i followed what a previous review said and put 1 and 1/2 cup sugar and doubled the vanilla. I also added a dash of ground cinnamon,just to spice it up ;) and 1/4 tsp salt. It came out just the way i liked them a good balance between the cake-like brownie and fudgy brownie! And i just used one big bowl !

I love how easy this recipe is--can do it even while holding a clingy 1-year old lol. But the pan really is a tad big for the batter...I like slightly fatter brownies. They taste great though! Right out of the oven my first impression was that they were slightly dry, but after sitting in the container overnight they are delicious.
You can also make these into PB brownies by swirling peanut butter right into the batter in the pan before baking.

This was not only my first time baking brownies, but my first time eating brownies (yep, I come from a brownie-less country), I followed the recipe exactly, except that I baked them in a smaller dish (9x11)and I added a 1/4 tsp. salt.
At precisely 35 minutes, I pulled the brownies out of the oven and I was met with a shiny surface and a heavenly smell and when cutting them off, they came off the pan perfectly without getting stuck at all, perhaps it was the fact that I used a glass pan?.
Well, it turns out I don't like brownies at all!, the concept is far to much for me, too dense, too sweet, too chocolate-y; but my husband, who's american, told me they were absolutely perfect in every sense possible, so, five stars!.

My new go-to brownie recipe! Big hit with the entire family and easy to make. One hint though - never substitute chocolate syrup for the chocolate necessary in the recipe. I did once and it did not turn out so well (it was the ONLY chocolate we had in the house).

Love this recipe! I followed the advice and put these in a foiled pan and liberally sprayed it with Pam. As with most brownies, they aren't pretty until they're cut and put on a dish but they are just perfect. Just as easy as brownies from a box but taste so much better. Thanks!

Looked up the recipe last minute for a friend's birthday. Wonderful, quick, I used 12 tbs and 3 tbs instead of the baking chocolate. It was simple. Only complaint it that it was sometimes hard to spread on my pan. Might have been the pan or just how I was doing it. Nonetheless, FIVE STARS!

Easy but not as chocolately as I had hoped. They are light with a subtle hint of chocolate. I made the following healthier modifications, which may have led to my brownie. 
* I only had about 1/2 cups of butter, so I used a 4 oz cup of applesauce. Instead of all purpose flour, I had whole wheat flour, and I didn't add the full 2 cups of sugar, I used 1 cup of brown and 1/2 white. I threw in chopped pecans and mini chocolate chips. My  brownies definitely came out looking like muffins. I  baked them in a 12-muffin tin so that they would be easier for the kids to grab and eat.  All of these modifications resulted in a denser brownie. I will probably make this again but buy some allpurpose flour and add more chocolate than just one bar of hersheys (all I had). Im a dark chocolate fan, so will use that instead.

These brownies were awesome!!!  Since I didn't have baker's squares, I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels (about 1 1/2 cups) and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  I had to bake them about 40 minutes.  Hubby said they were the best he's ever had!  I also added crumbled up peanut butter cups.  Yum!

It was a little too sugary for myself.  However, this was a great recipe to make with my daughter.  Very friendly for young kids wanting to learn how to cook.

I love this recipe. It was easy to make and didn't require anything I didn't have. And since I made it in the middle of the night, I didn't use a blender and it still mixed real well. I used semi-sweet baking chocolate instead and then added an extra one that i had to the top. I choppeditup and sprinkledit on. I also used 3 tbsp of cocoa. You may have guessed, but I am a chocoholic.

Like everyone else says, this brownie is chewy and fudgy, just how I like them! They are absolutely delicious. I'll make them with more chocolate next time so I don't have to eat three to get a fix. :) Yes, they do stick to the pan if you don't grease it well enough. My suggestion for those who don't want to injure themselves while trying to scrape the squares out is to bake them in silicone cupcake cupcake liners.

Very good and easy to make.  My 7 yr. old daughter made these with only a little help from me.  I also made a batch and topped it with chopped peanuts, mini marshmallows, coconut and chocolate chips, after I followed the recipe.  Then I put the cooked brownies with the toppings under the broiler for a few minutes - voila! Rocky Road Brownies.  Delicious!

Excellent fudgy brownies. We loved them. I will alternate between these and some other cake-like brownie recipe but won't go back to boxed brownies ever again! Thanks for another great recipe.

these are super easy and quick to make, and they are good.  but i probably wont make them again, i actually like a few of the box brownie brands better.  these would be better with added chocolate chips into the mix.  they seem to be missing something.

I substituted 3 tablespoons of cocoa (even added a little extra) and extra butter for the chocolate as per the Hershey's box, but they were not chocolately at all.  The consistency was fine, but you could practically not even taste the chocolate. I ended up spreading peanut butter over them calling them Peanut Butter blondies, which were good enough that it wasn't a loss. They were quite sugary, esp. without a strong chocolate flavor.  I'd make these again per their reputation, but would cut the sugar a bit, add little salt (I used unsalted butter), and definitely use real chocolate.

I've used this recipe several times and it is very good.  I only use three chocolate squares and it still has very good flavor.  I'm suprised to read other reviews saying that their brownies do not have much flavor even after using four chocolate squares.

I really liked the texture of these brownies, and they were super easy.  I used the foil like previous reviewers suggested.  I did think they were overly sweet and could have used a little salt.  I think I would reduce the sugar a bit if I made them again.

Everyone likes these but me.  I find they are not chocolatly enough and they wouldn't cook....then they ended up too dry and crumbly for me.  I think the problem may have been me and not the recipie though since it worked for everyone else!

These brownies were awesome straight from the oven, with ice cream and fudge topping.  Very fudgy.  I greased the pan with butter before baking and didn't have any sticking problems.  I used cocoa powder/margarine as a substitute for the chocolate squares the first time i made them, and used margarine for the 3/4 c butter.  They were great.  The second time I made them, I used real butter....either I did something horribly wrong, or these turn out better with margarine. Either way, they're good.

Delicious! Mine baked for about 32 minutes- and came out perfectly. I have been making this recipe as my only brownie recipe for years (it used to be on the back of the Baker's chocolate box) and it is just the best! Some brownies are not chocolaty enough, but these definitely are.

Have to agree with other reviewers that the baking time for these brownies is way off.  The taste was good once they were finally cooked through, but the outside edges ended up with a burned taste. Could a little more flour help these cook better and not be so goey?

I thought this recipe was so simple and just tasted soooo good!!!  This recipe is as easy as a box with much better flavor. My family just loved these...this recipe is definitly a keeper and I will be continue to make them this way!!  The only change that I did was no walnuts, otherwise did just as the recipe stated...I did take the advise of using aluminium foil sprayed with oil, that worked out great!!

I wish I could give more than 5 stars!  These brownies are easier and simpler than any other from-scratch recipe I've ever tried, but the taste and texture were unparalleled.  I appreciated the simplicity-- no double boiler, no tempering eggs, very few ingredients . . . and they were fudgey, chewy, and deliciously chocolatey.

I cut it in half, using an 8" square pan.  I used almonds (I was out of other nuts!) and added chocolate chips.  The baking time ended up being 25 minutes for really fudgy brownies.  This totally cured my chocolate fix!

I had a problem with what 1 ounce squares meant.  My chocolate was in little chunks.  I just used about 1 cup or so.  I used 1 cup of sugar because my chocolate was semi sweet. I also had to try twice to make the batter because it was too thick and started chunking up.  The second batter I used more butter (1 cup) and it came out fine.  When done, the brownies were good.  But a bit too sweet.  The crust on top flaked and crumbled which was cool. But I'd like to see other recipes.

There was too much butter and when I pulled them out of the oven they weren't done. ten minutes more of baking only made them collapse in the middle and you could hear the sizzling of the butter grease. I don't know what went wrong but it went way beyond wrong. what a waste of ingredients. Extremely displeasing.

VERY good! I added white chocolate chips, and used macadamia nuts. This recipe was very simple to make and turned out well.

This was a quick and very easy recipe.  The brownies are incredibly moist and chewy.  However, when I made a second batch I used the option to swirl cream cheese.  This version requires an additional egg in the brownie mix.  This made the brownie more cake like.  we did not care for them.  Stick witht the original recipe, it is great!

This is not a fudgie brownie.  Other than having lots of chocolate in it, I found it wasn't very flavorable.  Also, I reduced the baking time to 25 min. after reading the other reviews.  It may help to put in a pinch of salt.  It was easy to make.  I won't make it again.

The brownies seemed a caramel colour rather than a deep chocolate, so I added extra chocolate. Other than that very good, nice and fudgey. They only lasted 5 minutes.

I made this with my 4-year old daughter and 4-year old nephew. EASY to make and they tasted great. I'd made homemade brownies once before and didn't like them. This recipe was far better. I will definitely make them again. They were actually better after they set/cooled but not many made it to that point!

These are great!

In the interest of cutting some fat and calories, I did replace 1/2 cup of the butter with 1/2 cup applesauce, and then reduced the sugar from 2 to 1 1/2 cups. Still sweet and moist enough!

The best brownie recipe I have found... But I altered it a bit..
I use 5 squares of unsweetened chocolate and 1 3/4 cups of sugar.
I ALWAYS cook them on Parchment paper and have ZERO sticking problems.

Wasn't horrible, but not fudgy at all.  More like still gooey in the center and I cooked them til they were done around the edges.  I used 1/2C less sugar than called for, but still very sweet.  Will try tweaking one more time then try another recipe.  Will try using only 1C sugar and more chocolate.  This time I even used the Special Dark baking chocolate, but the result was far more sweet than chocolatey.

This turned out good for me only I made several adjustments. I sprayed my pan (glass 9x13) with Cooking spray instead of using shortening or using foil. Secondly, I melted my butter and chocolate in a double boiler. It takes a lot less time to melt the chocolate that way. Next, I took mine out after only 30 minutes b/c they were already starting to brown too much on the edges, next time I will check them at 25. Also next time I will use more chocolate and possibly less sugar. Maybe Throw some chocolate chips in there or something.

These were awful.  My daughter made them and followed the recipe exactly.  They were so gooey after 35 minutes that she baked them another ten minutes. Then they were still gooey.  After cooling, they turned into cement.  We had to soak the entire thing in water just to be able to get them out of the pan so we could use the pan again.  Sorry, but we won't be making these ever again.

I made the recipe according to the instructions (except for adding nuts) and was pretty dissappointed. They weren't nearly chocolatey enough. I should have added an additional 2 1-oz squares of chocolate (at least) when I saw how light-colored the batter was. I made these for a day-trip I took with 15 people today, thinking that the brownies would dissappear as quickly as other baked goods usually do, but no one was very interested after their first tastes. The texture/consistency was good and the recipe was so easy and fast, that I might give it another shot (adding more chocolate next time). Otherwise I'd call this recipe "One-Bowl Butter Brownies", because all I tasted was chocolate flavored butter!

They also taste great!

These brownies were easy enough to put together.  However, despite appearing to be cooked all the way when I took them out, they were raw inside.  I put them back in the oven and cooked them longer.  They came out better, but not the brownies I thought they would be.  Nonetheless, they all got eaten.  The taste to me wasn't as good as a box mix and I will try to find another recipe I like better.  Not sure if I will try this one again.

These are great!  My whole family loved them and they were nearly gone by the end of the day.  I made them without the nuts.  I expected to have a cooking-time problem after I read the other feedback, but these cooked fine for me in 35 minutes.

Easy and quick... and very tasty!  This is the traditional non-cakey brownie; more fudgy.  As pointed out, it's the same as the recipe on the box of Baker's Unsweetened Chocolate.

I've made these twice, both times turned out excellent.  Better than any box mix.  I greased the tin foil lining like other reviewers recommended and haven't had any issues with sticking to the pan.  They also keep well, three days later they are just as yummy.

I made these brownies today (omiting nuts, since I don't like nuts).  The taste was okay, chocolatey and not overly sweet, but the product was a little off for brownies.  First, the texture wasn't very moist.  Usually brownies kind of fall apart, these stayed together perfectly.  I suppose they are more of a cake brownie than a fudge brownie.  The tops were crusty, and I only baked it for 30 minutes--not the full 35.  So, I don't know if they were overbaked and that's why they were somewhat crusty and dry.  Overall, the recipe was very quick and easy to clean up.  But, I would rather spend a little more time and clean up for more moist, sweet choclatey brownies.

The absolute best brownies I've ever had or made.  I've been looking for these results for years.  Dangerously delicious fudgy brownies.  I substituted the walnuts for pecans, which I thought made them even better!
