A very tasty meal. The only change I made was to saute some carrot, onion, and Green pepper
after removing the pork and before adding the pineapple--reserving the veg, adding back in once the fruit was carmelized.
I made this dinner for two, and the amount of sauce was adequate. You may wish to increase the sauce ingredients for four.

We LOVED this!!  I didn't add all the hot sauce, and for my photo I forgot to put the green onion tops on (sorry---it would have looked so much better).  I served this with sticky rice (calrose) and artichokes.  We all pronounced this a KEEPER!  Thanks once again, Chef John!

Loved it! Made it twice now. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time, I used the crockpot and liked it even more. You just need to made extra sauce to add on at the end.

I made this tonight for supper and it turned out very tasty! I didn't have all of the exact ingredients on hand so I had to ad lib a bit. Like other reviewers had suggested, I cubed the pork and pan fried it. I also sautéed some onions, carrots and green pepper with the pineapple. Then for the spice and tang I added a few dashes of Franks red hot sauce and about 1 tsp of red curry paste as I did not have any hot chili sauce on hand or red pepper flakes. Served it over rice and both me and my husband really enjoyed this dish and both agreed this recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks Chef John.

A word of caution concerning the spices used in this recipe. I cooked this for the first time last night and it came out very spicy. I used Sriracha hot sauce as suggested and tasted the sauce before cooking it and it was only mildly hot. But after cooking the sauce it had a great flavor but was so spicy hot that it was almost uneatable. I may have stumped my toe with the red pepper flakes. I added a couple of dashes instead of a pinch.

A good sweet and sour recipe...liked the sauce.  It was lighter, thinner than the thick type which is customary to sweet and sour sauce.  A nice change.  I added some other vegetables (carrots, celery, green pepper) to the blend to resemble the traditional sweet and sour I'm used to having.  I also cubed the pork.  I meant to sprinkle with sesame seeds at the end, but forgot.  Will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly except for pounding the meat. I just cut small 1 inch medallions and found this to work out just fine. This dish is pretty spicy hot yet so full of flavor I didn't mind the heat. I served it over rice.

This was quite good, although I changed it quite a bit.  We wanted to grill this, so I made the sauce separately.  I cut the Sriracha sauce in half and skipped the red pepper flakes and we thought the heat level was perfect.   After simmering, I thickened it slightly with a cornstarch/water  slurry.  Since I wanted to use fresh pineapple, I used about 1/3 cup of pineapple juice I had in the freezer for the sauce.  Hubs grilled the tenderloin whole, brushing it with some of the sauce toward the end of the cooking time.  We also grilled the pineapple.   Additional sauce was drizzled on when plating. The only change I would make next time is to run my emersion blender through the sauce to puree the chunks of onion, just for a more pleasing appearance.

This sauce is delicious - very tangy.  I cubed the pork, and cooked up white onion, red and green pepper with the pineapple.  I also used fresh pineapple, not canned, and splashed a bit of OJ in with the sauce in place of the juice.  So good on the first try.

I made this twice - the sauce was wonderful, but the meat was not quite so. First, unless something was missing from the directions, this resulted in just 4 large pieces of pork, not many smaller cubes of it. The second time I made this, I cut up the pork, and liked it a lot more that way. I made a mistake the second time since I bought a can of crushed pineapple instead of pineapple chunks - chunks are definitely the way to go here. I'm not a good judge of what the "Chinese take-out classic" version of this dish is, but something still seemed missing here. It was very good, just not 5-star, in my opinion.

Such a simple sweet and sour pork, we all enjoyed it. I did cut my tenderloins into bite sized chunks. Simply a wonderful tasting sauce. Served it with New Year's rice recipe on this site, great together. 
Update: I've made this in the crock pot  with  cut large chunks of pork tenderloin (they shrink half the size). I used fresh pineapple chunks, about two cups, and also cut up a half sweet  onion, saving the green onion as topping after cooked. Added in a small chopped red and green bell pepper. Used a bit more Mae Ploy Sweet chili sauce, like 1/4 cup, instead of Sriracha . Cooked on low for six hours in the crock pot. Meat was tender melt in your mouth. The sauce was so tasty with all the juice of fruit and peppers. Adding in a tablespoon of corn starch before cooking kept it at just the right consistency. Served over rice.

I made this today in the crockpot for tonight's dinner.  It was excellent!!!  I didn't bother pounding the meat, just chopped a porkroast into 1" chunks and browned it before tossing it into the pot. I added green pepper, yellow onion and celery to the mix. Cooked for about 4 1/2 hours on high... the meat was super tender, and the veggies were perfect. The sauce came out thin, so I drained it into a saucepan at the end and thickened with a little cornstarch.  In the future, I will add more vinegar as it was a little bland.  Maybe more heat, too...  However, all in all - delicious!

I followed as directed with just a couple exceptions. I doubled the recipe and used an entire package of  pork tenderloins (two tenderloins) and cubed them.  I also had to add some green bell pepper because it just seems sweet and sour should have it. I think I would tweak it further if I was to make it again but it went over well with my boys.

This came out more spicy than sweet and sour. I'd probably make it again without so much of the hot sauce.

Tonight's dinner was awesome! Served over steam fried noodles, I made this exactly as directed except I had double tenderloin so doubled sauce.  So good! Just the right amount of heat for us. Thanks so much for posting this. I'll make this again. Easy/fast too.

My go to recipe for S&S ... a regular meal for son & me.  We enjoy it with brown rice (1 1/2 cups) and a steamer bag of veggies. 
Not necessary additions, but suit our tastebuds are: 
a finger of grated ginger (stirred in with the garlic) and
a bunch of fresh cilantro leaves to finish. 
Probably will work with most proteins like shrimp or chicken as well.

Excellent recipe, a great base that can be used with virtually any meat. We had boneless and skinless chicken thighs on hand, so that’s what I used. I also had some green peppers from the garden so they went in with the onions. It was amazing!

I've made this 15 or more times. I use fresh pineapple and canned pineapple juice.  This is a family favorite, better than anything you can buy in any Chinese Restaurant, and it's all thanks to Chef John.

I loved this recipe! Very simple and yet very delicious! Didn't change a thing (we like spicy food) but if your not into it, i'd say cut down on the sirracha or hot sauce as well as eliminate the pepper flakes. Also i did only add some cornstarch but just because i liked the sauce to be more thick ( i doubled the recipe btw, and still came out perfect ) 5 stars and a picture! I had it with some green beans since we are trying to cut back the carbs. But with rice would really be the best everrr

Only change I made was to cube the pork tenderloins, about 3/4 inch.  I initially did 1 inch cubes and they significantly swell larger.  Incredible taste.

I made this the other night i didn't have pineapple on hand so i think it would b sweeter next time with it but it was still tasty. I just sautéed up veggies a bit and cut pork into cubes cooked them a bit and thru it all together in sauce and thru in oven. It was very tasty. Will definitely make this again but with the pineapple!

I just made this for dinner and it was outstanding! The only thing I left out (because I forgot to buy some) was the garlic cloves.

My family went nuts over this dish!
Tender, flavorful, easy, and versitile. I added red and green bell pepper, and skipped the chili flakes. SOOO easy to make!  My kids begged me to make it again soon! Thank you Chef John!

Tasty but TOO MUCH VINEGAR. It overpowered. I recommend if you're going to make this, use half of what's called for. I cut the pork into cubes and glad I did. Was much less work than slicing and pounding. I served on top of cauliflower rice. Worked well. Thx Chef John

I really like this pork. I used leftover meat from a bone in pork roast. This recipe is spicy and on the hot side. You can leave out the hot sauce to cool it down. I like spicy hot dishes so it worked well for me. I found the recipe didnt allow for enough sauce. I will increase the amount the next time.

Excellent.  I used one tsp sugar and dash of molasses (ran out of brown sugar)  Don't need the butter.  Used one tsp of oil in my non stick pan...the sauce was delightful.  I did add green bell pepper from my garden and next time will add the carrots, too.  LOVED it...

We really loved this over brown rice.  Doubled the recipe to make 6 lunches for me and the husband - there was a good amount of sauce so I followed the recipe exactly but went easy on the brown sugar. I didn't see when in the instructions to cut the pork tenderloin into smaller pieces? We did after the sauce was made before throwing it all over rice. I will thicken the sauce with a cornstarch slurry next time. Also didn't need to pound out the pork tenderloin - it's already tender and if you're going to cut it and put it back in the sauce after it's cut to heat it up, it'll get cooked through for sure.  I can definitely see adding bell peppers and onion to the pineapple stir fry to add some veggies in. This didn't come out spicy (though we used a different brand of Sriracha) - my toddler will be able to eat this without a problem.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written.  My only issue was I couldn't flatten the meat enough.  Since I don't have a meat tenderizer, I just used a large can of pears.  :)  After browning 5-6 minutes on each side, the pork didn't look quite done.  After heating the sauce, I returned the meat to the pan for 15 minutes and covered it.  I turned the meat over halfway through.  Came out perfectly cooked and super juicy.  Served over white rice with some extra sauce poured over top!!

This meal was fantastic!!!! (Thanks Chef John!) The sauce was more of a sweet and sour and spicy taste (for reference). Just like everyone else, I pretty much stuck to the recipe. Just made a few changes based on previous reviews. I added carrots, green pepper and onion (all rough chopped) at the same time as the pineapple. I also omitted the white part of green onions (thinking it was going to be too oniony). Next time I will cut the pork up into smaller bite size chunks and make sure to sear them in peanut oil to get a nice brown crust. Served with brown rice and it was awesome! Highly recommended for a nice at home healthier Chinese dish! My husband and I loved it and will make again.

Beginner cook and I found it quite simple to prepare. I used a 1:1 ratio of white vinegar and rice wine to make up the 1/3 cup of rice vinegar since I didn't have any. Very flavourful yet lighter than the Chinese take-out version - thank you for this recipe!

Added 1 tablespoon of corn starch to the liquids to thicken it. Cut the pork up into 1 inch pieces to cook faster. Didn't use the hot stuff. Used 1/4 cup chopped yellow onion
Will use twice the pineapple and liquids next time and put it over rice. This is a very easy and quite tasty recipe for pork tenderloin!

My family loved it! I did not have a tenderloin so I used pork chops , pounded and cut up into chunks, it was delicious. The flavor was spot on. I used spicy chili garlic sauce, which added a little bit of a kick. Added over white rice. I will definitely be making this dish again. Will probably add some mushrooms next time for additional flavors.

Way too much vinegar. Pineapple chunks before cooking were sweet, after cooking and adding sauce, they were biting with acidity. Other than that, everything else was good.

EXCELLENT and easy! I added more veggies (carrots, mushrooms, peppers, sweet onion, and broccoli). Just cook everything in the sauce a bit longer, not much, I still like them crunchie!  GREAT meal!!

Very good. Added half onion and doubled the pineapple. 
Diced the pork and tossed with a tblsp cornstarch and a cast iron skillet. Definitely sweet. Maybe a bit to kechup-ey sweet for me. Might try to swap out the ketchup for tomato paste or tomato sauce. Nice warmth that starts at the back of the throat  and ends on the lips. All-in-all, a recipe to repeat!

I've made this recipe a handful of times now and I like it a lot!  The sauce turns out really nicely with a great tang.  I add a little more pineapple than called for and add some rough chopped onion, red and green bell pepper.  I've made the recipe as called for with four large pieces of tenderloin, but my preference is to cut it up into large bite sized pieces instead. 
 Either way, this is delicious.  Give it a try.

Amazing recipe, the sauce was exceptional. I was surprised how quick the process was from start to finish and how many ingredients I already had so I recommend this for a cheap, fast dinner that's sure to please.

This will be my go-to sweet and sour recipe.  You could do with chicken just as well I think.  I agree with others that the sauce could be doubled and adding some green or red peppers adds nicely to the party.  I soft petaled the hot peppers.  Its better to undershoot than overshoot the heat.
Have fun with this.

I cubed the pork. Sautéed onions, peppers and carrots. Added the pork back after thickening, with cornstarch, the sauce. It was a hit.

I made this per directions with the following exceptions: I was out of rice vinegar so used white vinegar and I did sauté some diced red peppers with the pineapple. Beyond that I didn’t change a thing. Everyone ate it without complaints and there wasn’t a morsel leftover. I served it on a bed of jasmine rice and did a quick veggie stir fry as a side. Yum! This will go into regular rotation at my house.  I personally like that it wasn’t battered and fried. I haven’t been making sweet and sour pork because I don’t like the mess a batter fried recipe creates. And I don’t need or miss the coating.

Decent but not great. To be fair, I would probably never order sweet and sour at a Chinese place but I love Chef John and the reviews were so good and Pork Tenderloin was on sale for $2.99/lb...  but in the end it's still sweet & sour.  I also didn't have Siracha sauce so I used Sambal Oelek chili paste. The spice level was fine but this substitution may have taken the vinegar level too far.  I would recommend cutting back on the vinegar if you need to substitute like I did.

Excellent sweet & sour recipe.   I did not use a fresh tenderloin, instead I used a left-over juicy pork chop, so I did not follow the procedure for cooking the tenderloin.   Instead I just heated it through.   My only thing about this recipe that I would change is that I would double the amount of the sauce, as we found it to be not enough once it thickened.

I was looking for something to make rather quickly with pork tenderloin and found this recipe. Once I started to make it I realized I had  boneless center cut pork loin roast. I went ahead and used it, cut 1" cuts, then pounded out to ¼".  Meat turned out ok. The sauce was a bit to 'vinegary' for the family. I will cut that part down a bit next time. I also put just about a teaspoon of sriracha sauce (kids don't like it too spicy), that seemed to be about right for our crew. 
 Otherwise didn't get any other complaints...

It was good, but a little spicy. Next time I will add less hot sauce and probably omit the pepper flakes. I would have liked more sauce. Overall a good recipe.

The sauce had great flavor and really made this recipe. I added yellow onion, green pepper, and celery chunks to the green onions to make this dish more hearty. I also added corn starch to the sauce to thicken it. Also doubled the sauce to have plenty to serve with rice. Substituted white wine vinegar that I had in the pantry for rice vinegar

Like others have said, watch the spice, maybe cut the Siracha in half. So very flavorful! I didn't pound the pork and I added peas and carrots to the rice. I could see adding in several more veggies as well, but this was soooo good! I loved the flavorful heat that came with this dish and I am not a fan of spicy.

this was an easy and delicious recipe.  I used regular white vinegar instead of rice vinegar, and I used green peppers instead of green onions because that's what I had on hand. turned out pretty great.

I am not a fan of Sirachi so I eliminated that ingredient (I didn't have any anyway). This recipe was very good.  I did add thinly sliced carrots on the slant and next time I will use a little less Rice vinegar. (The 1/3 cup minus a tbls.) All in all a very tasty dish.

It wouldn't be my version of Chinese takeout without some green pepper, bamboo shoot, and water chestnut. I used half  the chili sauce and it still had a nice bite. Overall, a very tasteful dish. I thicken mine with a little corn starch.

Only thing I changed on this was that I used apple cider vinegar (no rice vinegar in the house) and I decreased the sriracha as we had a guest who has not adjusted to the heat we usually eat.  Would definitely make this again.  I made a large batch and there was no leftovers.

This is scrumptious.  Pork loin is such a tender and inexpensive cut of meat, it makes this a really delectable version of this classic dish.  I love that the sauce isn’t all gooped up with thickeners!  This is a fabulous recipe, thanks for posting it!!!

I thought this was awesome. I added more of the sauces so I could add more veggies when I cooked the pineapple. I added yellow and red pepper and an onion. Great great additions. I also added cornstarch to make it thicker.  I will do this again.

Sweet and Spicy
Great recipe! We added a little extra Sriracha as we like spicy foods. This recipe is very tasty. My son (who hates pineapple) liked the browned pineapples in butter. Overall, a great recipe. Will definitely make again.

I did the pork in the slow cooker (5 hours),  added the sauce ( didn't have rice vinegar, used Peri Peri sauce instead of chilli sauce), sauteed onions and pineapple in butter, added them and 3 peppers to the pork  and continues to slow cook for an other hour-amazing tender pork and great tasting meal !

There is another similar recipe on here called sweet and sour pork III, which was delicious but it used a whole cup of sugar. I made this one and just borrow two ingredients from the other recipe. I added half a green pepper cut into 1-inch pieces and a small stalk of celery chopped up and it was delicious. So I made this exact recipe and all I did was add the green  pepper and celery and it made delightful meal.

This version of sweet and sour pork was superb.  I did not give it five stars only because I added the vegetables as was suggested by several reviewers.  I cut back on the hot sauce by about 1/2, but that is just our personal preference and it was perfect.  I also cut my pork tenderloin into 1/2 inch thick medallions, instead of four portions, so did not brown them as long as the recipe stated, just until lightly browned.  I used two tenderloins, and doubled the amount of ingredients for the sauce.  We will definitely make this again.  I was amazed that the pork was so tender after such a short cooking time.  The vegetables I used were broccoli, red bell pepper, sugar peas, onion, and carrots.  Colorful, delicious, healthy, and delicious.  After browning the pork, I removed it to a plate,  sautéed the vegetables in the same pan, added the sauce until bubbly, and then the meat until heated through.  Served over a combination of half brown and half white rice.  Thank you, Chef John!

Followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding carrots, red peppers, and onion slices.  My husband and I thought it was very good.  We also topped it with some cashews.(I always like nuts on my Chinese.). I will be making this again.

I used leftover pork tenderloin, warmed it in the sauce. I did add carrots and greeen pepper to Pineapple. My sauce didn't seem to thicken as I thought it would but delicious. I halved the Siriacha, it still had some bite to it. Definitely a keeper!  It was also good leftover!

Yummy. Put it over meatballs. Made a few changes.... to the sauce added grated ginger, used just under 1 tsp hot sauce,  3 Tbsp cornstarch (next time will use only 2). Used pineapple tidbits and cooked the sauce in a pot before adding to meatballs. Once meat and sauce was together I thinned it out a bit more with white wine (which I think wouldn't have been necessary if I'd used only 2 Tbsp cornstarch but in the end I think it added to the flavour)

This was delicious.  I cubed the pork as some suggested and put Siracha sauce on the table instead of in the sauce as I have young children. We all really enjoyed this dish. I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely fabulous!  I used 1 teaspoon of chili powder, instead of the hot pepper and regular sweet onion in place of green onions (I didn't have any green on hand).  I added squares of green pepper with the pineapple and shaved carrot with the pork at the end.  Will be making this again and again.

We stirred a 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch into the ketchup/vinegar mix before adding to the pan & liked how the sauce turned out. You might want to add the Sriracha in increments & then taste for heat.

I made this tonight, hubby loved it, I did too. I needed to use up some leftover pork roast so I sautéed some green pepper and carrots with the pineapple, otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely make again.

I have a sweet and sour pork recipe we have been using for over 30 years.  That is being replaced with this recipe.  We loved it!  It is much less labor intensive than the other recipe, and we loved the sauce, and the hint of spiciness in it.  I cubed the pork, browned it, then removed it from the pan and sauteed cubed onion and green pepper, along with sliced carrots.  I added them to the pork, and browned the pineapple.  (What a great addition to flavor!)  I  then removed the pineapple, and poured the sauce into the pan.  I added some cornstarch mixed with water to the sauce to thicken it.  When thickened, I added everything else back to the pan, and stirred to coat and warm it.  I served this over brown rice.  We thought the amount of sauce was just right.  I will be making this again many times.  Thanks  for another great recipe, Chef John!

Really enjoyed it as a base idea. I sautéed some peppers and onion before adding pineapple and used white vinegar. Didn't have hot sauce or green onion, so I omitted those two ingredients. I also charred the pork on grill instead of sautéing .

Easy and good.  Cubed the pork.  Left out the hot sauce, added diced carrots, celery and bell pepper chunks.  Thickened sauce at end with cornstarch / water mixture.  Served over brown rice.  Sauce was really good.

Great for pork tenderloin. I might cut back on the heat (pepper flakes) next time for my husband's sake.

A-MAZ-ing! This dinner recipe is a keeper! Great flavors, but I did dial back on the heat a bit (1 t. Sriracha and two light shakes of red pepper flakes) and it was perfect. I roasted the pork tenderloin whole, then chunked it into 1/2" bites, and added that to the sauce with following add-ins (all cut into bite-sized pieces and cooked tender-crisp): 3 carrots, a green bell pepper, a small can of water chestnuts and at the end, two 2" tomatoes cut into 8ths. I drained the water chestnuts, but used the pineapple juice (recipe) and added ~1.5 t. cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Once warmed through, I served it on a bed of cooked brown rice. 
This will stay in my go-to box of favorites. Next time, I think I'll try adding large, frozen shrimp, and even some chicken chunks. Very versatile, and VERY tasty!

Way to much heat in recipe.  I liked it but the rest of the family refused to eat it after the first heat wave!  I will try again without all the heat, and add a bit more sweetness.

I thought this was fantastic! My husband loved it and the fried rice I made. A few notes, I used very well trimmed pork loin, very tender and I feel I'd be able to marinate 15 to 20 minutes less in the future. I omitted the celery and added a sliced sweet onion and carrots to the sauce, I used reduced sodium Soy, the dish was not  too salty. My husband loved the breading when fresh but as leftovers not so much. This will be a go to for our very rural lake house when we get a craving for Chinese take-out.

This is a great dish!  I made a couple of changes, based primarily on what I had on hand.  I used boneless pork loin chops and cut them into 1 1/2-inch cubes,   Worked great. Also, I didn't have hot sauce so I substituted sweet chili sauce, about 1/2 tsp., and that added great texture, color and flavor. Browning the pineapple was a nice touch and I did stir fry peppers and onions right after the pineapple, then added them back along with the meat. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and loved the outcome.  Served over rice noodles.  That was a good combination. I will definitely make this again.

OMG - this was FANTASTIC! Light, delicious and fantastic! Added extra veggies plus we were able to make this KID FRIENDLY while enjoying our spice! 

(1) REDUCE SPICE IN BASE SAUCE: Omit Sriarcha, sub 1t of sweet chili sauce
(2) ADD VEGETABLES: Saute vegetables your kid likes separately in oil (I bought presliced stir fry -  carrots, snow peas, bok choy, red peppers) 
(3) CHILDS DISH: Served rice, vegetables, pineapple and pork with sauce separately
(4) ADULTS DISH: put down the rice, veggies on top, pork on very top and added sauce to all; no scallions on top.
(5) ADD SPICE TO ADULT DISHES: Shake red pepper flakes on adult dishes at end, with scallions. This pairs well with Sauv Blanc if you have any around!

OMG, this was a winner!!

The whole family Loved it. I really enjoyed the kick the hot sauce gave it. I sauted some yellow peppers and a regular onion  along with the pineapple to give it a bit more crunch.

I made this exactly as written. The flavor was not reminiscent of sweet and sour. I wanted to like it, but did not.

First time tried to do a sweet n' sour and recipe was right on target...not sure why there are no instructions to cut up pork after pound, but definitely will need to do.  I used regular onions since didn't have any green ones on hand; added green/yellow pepper; and substituted dried red chile pepper for red flakes; and added dash of quick oats to thicken (could use corn starch as well)...was great.  Of course even better to add rice.  also will add more veggies next time (more green/yellow/red peppers)...

I followed the recipe pretty exactly, except I did cut the pork into cubes as many others suggested.  I was planning to add sautéed green peppers and onions like some of the other reviewers suggested, but forgot.  I think that would add a nice touch.  I did use corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit.  It was just the right amount of tangy and sweet.  Really liked it!

Amazing! This was a fantastic recipe and was very easy to prepare. It was a great way to use leftover pork tenderloin! I added about a teaspoon of corn starch mixed with water to thicken the sauce while I reheated the pork. This recipe is definitely "a keeper"!

This was a really good and tasty recipe.  Pleasantly surprised at how the spice added a little kick to it (even after I had to reduce it for the non-spice eating family).  Nice flavor and simple to make.

I really liked how light it was. The pork turned out so tender! Not like the dried up chewy pork from take-out. I will make this again. I did stray from the recipe and added bell pepper, carrot, and onion with the pineapple.

Sorry, I found this to have way too much vinegar taste. I would almost halve the amount. I also had to add cornstarch/water to thicken it slightly. I did like the step for caramelizing the pineapple. Very tasty. I also added green peppers and onions to round out the dish.

We loved it but I doubled up on the recipe added extra red peppers flakes and instead of just adding the pork back to the pan to re heat, I added it and cooked it longer on low heat  melt in your mouth

Great tangy sauce - added habanero chile sauce which gave it more of a kick than most other sweet and sour sauces.  I didn't pound the meat - just cut in bite size pieces. Used regular yellow onion instead of green onion, and added some sweet red and yellow peppers and sweet snap peas that I had on hand. Very good with coconut rice. Will definitely make again.

Really yummy, very 'authentic' take out flavor.  I added a little arrowroot starch to the sauce to thicken it a little (cornstarch would probably work also)

This tasted better than takeout. I made a few changes. I sliced the pork tenderloin into small medallions and coated them in flour. I also think that next time I will use less of the vinegar. it was a little overpowering.

Wow! We really enjoyed this! The meat was very moist and the sauce very flavorful! I too, wanted to grill this. I started sautéing the pineapple in a bit of butter and when it was golden, I added the rest of the ingredients and reduced it on the stove. I used an immersion blender once it had reduced to smooth it out a bit. While I didn't use nearly half the hot sauce and pepper flakes, it was perfect for us and it can be customized to an individual "heat to sweet" liking. Thanks, Chef!

Added 6 small sweet chili peppers. Increased the garlic about 50%. Reduced the red pepper flakes because the Sriracha sauce that I have on hand is very hot. Used a lot of fresh green scallions from my garden. It was still rather hot. However, my wife , who is spice sensitive, loved it. This recipe will become a regular at our house.

This was a nice healthier alternative to fried sweet and sour pork.  We really liked the flavor, but, it didn't get quite thick enough to make a sticky glaze on the pork.  I added a small cornstarch slurry and it thickened up perfectly.  I will make again, but, next time try with chicken.  I am sure it will be wonderful too!

Good recipe. I like to use it as the main ingredient in tacos rather than serving over rice.  I used slightly less ketchup than it called for and white onions instead of scallions (all I had). I also cut the pork into more than four pieces - I sliced it about 1/2 - 1 inch thick then pounded it. My only other change was to add the onions to the pan first, then add the garlic (I did not mix it into the sauce originally), then add the pineapple and followed the rest as is.

I felt it was missing something and it tasted better after adding in quite a bit of oyster sauce.

For 23 years my husband has said he didn't like sweet and sour anything.  Made this and didn't tell him what it was called.  He loved...I love it.   Only change I made was added carrots as suggested by others.  Delicious!!!!

That was pretty good, nice, different, probably won't make again, hence the 4, but still good enough for a try.
