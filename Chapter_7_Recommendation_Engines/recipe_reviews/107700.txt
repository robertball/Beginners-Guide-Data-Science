Very very good!  Instead of cooking on high, I added a can of chicken broth and let it cook on low for several hours while I was at work. I also added some carrots for the last 1.5 hours of cooking time. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll add peas too.  Served over wide noodles.  Everyone loved it!!

I made a few small changes as I didn't have all the ingredients from the recipe.  In the slow cooker I placed the chicken (frozen), 1 cup of chicken broth, 1 tbsp of Italian spices and 1 tsp of fresh basil.  I cooked this on low for 3-4 hours.    I then sauted the onions and garlic in butter as directed.  I then removed all of the broth from the crock pot and placed it in the skillet along with the cream of chicken (low fat) and tsp of flour to thicken it up.  I then added the (light) cream cheese.  I placed the chicken back in the slow cooker and poured the sauce over it and cooked on low for an additional hour.  Wonderful recipe!!!  Thank you very much.  This one is a keeper!

Creamy and deliciously tender chicken! I've made this 3 times over the past month. I serve it over butter- garlic long grain white rice with garlic toast to soak up the yummy sauce. If you don't have the dry Italian mix just use some Italian seasonings like oregano or basil works just as well.

Great recipe. I usually throw everything but the cream cheese into the crockpot to cook for several hours, even the frozen chicken. (I increased the chicken broth to 1 cup). Add the cream cheese the last 20 min of cooking and you're done! Very good even taking the shortcuts.   I've also tried this recipe & added 1/2 lb of fresh sliced mushrooms the last 10 min--great!  I've even used a homemade cream of chicken soup substitute in an attempt to make this healthier & I couldn't even tell the difference. I guess this is a no-fail recipe!

Exceptional.  I kept eating and eating this well after I was full.  I made some minor changes.  I did what another reviewer suggested where I put in chicken (cut in pieces) with the butter and can of chicken broth and cooked on low for 6 hours.  I added carrots 4 hours into cooking.  After cooking the onions and garlic, I added the 1/2 cup of broth from the crockpot, the cream of chicken soup and cream cheese.  I also added frozen peas.  I also sauteed mushrooms in a separate pan, and added those to the crock pot as well.  I cooked this for an additional hour.  With the carrots, peas, and mushrooms it added great texture.  It is seriously delicious.  I will be making this again very soon!!

3 stars for ease of preparation, good for weeknight. Salty for us. Used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts as that is what I had, and it was enough for the 3 of us. (We like sauce on our spaghetti; if I'd had 6 chicken pieces there would have been more  "juice" to the sauce I'm sure.)Used reduced fat soup and cream cheese. I shredded the chicken before serving. We did add parmesan cheese on the top when plated. Served with vegetables. This may work for a longer time on low, rather than the 3 hours on high, for those who aren't home in the afternoon to start this for dinner. I'll post if I try it that way.

This was just......okay. I got this into the crockpot a little late today (around noon) which worked out well for me as the newer model I now have is a much faster cooker than my last early 70's model. This really didn't need more than four hours of cooking in my crockpot. I followed the recipe closely, only adding more garlic and after tasting the sauce (which was not more than chicken flavored cream cheese), basil, oregano and red pepper flake. Even with the spices, this recipe just wasn't a home run for us. It was not especially visually appetizing and just kind of.........just not a favorite. Sure it's easy but it's just not very good. I'm sorry. We really tried. I won't make this again.

Very easy to make.  I modified this since I didn't have all the ingredients and it turned out just fine.  I didn't have cream cheese or the recommended seasoning packet.  I omitted the cream cheese, added mushrooms, used Lipton Golden Onion Soup Mix and had only 4 chicken breasts.  The chicken was perfectly tender.  I served it over bow tie/farfalle noodles with a biscuit on the side.

This was absolutely delicious!!  The only change I made was using 4 pieces of chicken instead of the 6 and I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of butter when cooking the onions and garlic and it still turned out perfect.  This simple recipe was a huge hit with my family and I will definitely be making this again.

Oh my gosh, this was spectacular. I used chicken tenderloins, threw in some Italian seasonings because I don't keep dry spice mixes on hand (oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary, paprika, celery salt, pepper), and I used a homemade cream soup mix that I love (I never buy it anymore, and this is so much healthier and cheaper)! I followed one reviewer's advice and threw everything but the cream cheese (neufchatel) in the crock, and just added the cream cheese later once everything else was cooked through. I shredded the chicken before the sauce thickened, so it had time to saturate the meat, and this was lovely but I recommend dicing your onions instead of leaving them as rings if you intend to shred the chicken! It's a little weird having big rings of onion in your shredded chicken. But still fantastically delicious! Served over rice with mixed veggies and watermelon on the side. This one's a keeper!!

I used frozen chicken tenders  (around 15) and just dumped all the ingredients in the slow cooker except for the cream cheese. I did add a full can of chicken broth an an extra can of chicken and mushroom soup. I cooked on low for 8 hours and the last hour added a container of Italian cream cheese spread, a cup of peas and carrot mixture and a bag of egg noodles. When I served it I just added some pepper and voila!  Perfect dinner.

I made this today and it was fantastic!!!  I added a box of uncooked Penne and sliced mushrooms at the last hour and it was an easy, delicious meal!  Good enough for informal company...it even looked good, which I find unusual for crockpot dishes. The sauce (which I used reduced fat cheese and soup) tasted like an alfredo sauce!  I want more like this!!!

I was really hesitant on making this. I usually hate recipes that use "cream of" soups & they usually turn out like slop....plus it doesn't look very appetizing, BUT did it anyway & I am so glad I did. I did not have this Italian dressing mix, but I looked up a recipe on this site for it..I used 2 tbs of that mix..plus a little tarragon. I added peas & some red & green peppers. Served it over angel hair & with warm crusty french bread. We really liked this.

This couldn't have turned out better!  I used Philly cooking cream (Savory Garlic) in place of the cream cheese but stuck to the recipe otherwise....my picky daughter was glad to come home to this after her track meet; she ate a big plate full!  We used penne pasta and there was plenty of sauce to cover it.  Looking forward to these leftovers!

I scaled the recipe down to half, and followed directions exactly.  The only thing I did different was add mushrooms, and served over spinach spaghetti.  This dish was good, definitely creamy, and the chicken was tender and delicious... but something seems off.  It just doesn't taste like tetrazzini to me.

Super easy and yummy! With a newborn, this recipe requires very little and comes out tasty. Couldn't find the seasoning mix and instead used Italian spices. Also used 3 bone in chicken breast and just removed the bones before adding the sauce. In the end also put in a few handfuls of frozen peas to add colour. Next time I would only use half of the cream cheese and areduced fat. cream of chicken soup. Overall a great success!

I didn't think this tasted good.  Too much of the cream cheese flavor and I didn't like the flavor of the italian dressing either.

Easy to prepare, and especially convenient that most ingredients are readily available in my normal "food reserves". I tried it out on my kids and their friends (ages 18-20), and they all liked it. I served it over linguine, and followed the recipe as written. Thank you for something new that the whole family will eat!

I decided to add the chicken back to the pot.  Not sure if I'll do that again next time though.  The chicken ended up shredding.  It tasted great but if the meal is for presentation purposes I'd make sure to poor the mixture over the chicken as the recipe suggested.  Regardless, the recipe was very yummy.

FOR PEOPLE WITH SOY ALLERGIES: If a cream of chicken soup exists without soy as an ingredient, I don't know about it - so instead of using COC soup, I do this: after cooking the onions (adding the minced garlic only in the last 30 seconds so it doesn't brown), I add the cream cheese + 2 big serving spoons of the liquid from the crock pot. I stir and cook to a creamy consistency, then I add as much heavy cream (I'm sure light cream would also work) as needed to get the sauce to the consistency that I want. My husband has the soy allergy, not me, and I love cream of chicken soup; I thought that the recipe would really be lacking without it. Glad to say that it tastes terrific! We have it all the time now; it's so easy to throw the chicken and Good Seasons mix in the crock pot  before work and let it cook for 10 hours on low. The chicken just falls apart. (I also never put 2 Tbsp. butter in the crock pot, it doesn't need it.) Delicious!

Very very good and easy! I tweaked it a bit because of what I had on hand, by adding mushrooms and instead of Italian seasoning I used dry onion soup and omitted the sliced onions, and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken, and used half and half instead of cream cheese. It was fantastic! I'm sure doing it the original way would be great too

Made changes using what I had. Cream of mushroom soup and added mini cut in half yellow, orange and red peppers. Also a small bag of sugar snap peas and some fresh asparagus cut up bite size. Put it all in the pot, as I was not going to be home and slow cooked for 5 hrs on low. Also used unthawed boneless, skinless chicken tenders about 10. I used a half cup of Italian dressing and cut back on the chicken broth. Served over wild rice, excellent my grandkids loved.

This was very delicious.  The only thing I would change is to make it a day ahead to allow it to thicken up a bit, otherwise it is perfect the way it is.

OH YEAH!  My husband and my 2 year EAT this up.  I make no changes (except when I run out of Cream of Chicken, then I use Cream of Celery or whatever I have on hand), but this stuff is YUMMY!!  Good cold weather comfort food, even better year-round-don't-wanna-cook-a-complicated-meal food!!!  Thanks for this recipe!!!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, and it turned out absolutely delicious. The only changes I made were that I also cooked it for longer on low rather than fewer hours on high, as other reviewers had done. I also added sliced carrots. When it was pretty much done, I shredded the chicken with a fork (it was so tender) while still in the Crock Pot and let it stay there a little while longer. I cooked angel hair pasta and then stirred it in with the chicken mixture in the Crock Pot. I really don't understand how anyone could say this recipe is "just okay". It had tons of flavor! My whole family said it was amazing. Even my finicky 2-year old devoured it.

Excellent with rice, fantastic served over biscuits. The first time I made this I used a low sodium broth and also made the cream of chicken from scratch (looked up the recipe) with the low sodium broth too. Excellent way to cut the sodium then add salt to taste. I also added mushrooms and (Carrots the first batch) roasted red pepper, adds color and flavor.

This was a fabulous slow cooker recipe.  I did make a couple of changes due to taste.  I used only 1/2 a packet of italian seasoning to cut down on saltiness.  I added more oregano and basil to keep flavor. Used about 4 oz. of cream cheese because it was all I had and it was perfect amount--not overwhelming.  Used cream of mushroom soup.  Also added red pepper with the onion.  Yummy.

Too bland for my family.  It was creamy and the chicken was tender but there was little flavor.  I also added peas to add color and flavor.  Didn't dislike it but I won't make it again.

This was sooo tasty! I only changed one step because I was not going to be home in the three hours it called for me to do the next step. After adding the chicken, butter and seasoning packet, I also added a 1/2 cup of broth so it wouldn't stick since I was gone. When I got home I did the next few steps and it turned out perfect!! I will surely add this to my collection and pass it on to my co-workers

Mmmmm!  I had only 4 chicken breasts, so it was way saucier than I'm sure it was supposed to be, but I used the leftover sauce with pasta and peas the next night.

This is so very flavorful and easy to make.  I did make it on top of the stove and served it over white rice instead of noodles.  It was still just as moist and full of chicken  flavor.  This has become a family favorite.  Serve with a fresh garden salad and some crusty Italian bread to complete your meal.

Definitely a keeper. Threw it together the night before and set the timer on the slow cooker. The wife made wife egg noodles when she got home, tossed a few garlic knots in the oven, and dinner was served. We loved it.

Having a family with bland tastes I senced this could be a success. I added a bit more garlic and over cooked the onions so they ( my girls) wouldn't complain. So I got all thumbs up. I give it five stars since it worked to my ladies. Next batch I plan to only add red wine vinaigrette and cracked pepper to the sauce. 
I also in the slow cooker added a quarter cup of chicken broth for the main cooking then drained it so sause wouldnt be too runny. Just thought chicken would be dry.  Worked great but on high easily cut cooking time down by half hour. Enjoy. Santa Rosa Scott

This was good but it had a salty aftertaste to me.  I think it was from the cream of chicken soup and chicken broth.  Next time, I will make sure to buy low salt/salt free products to avoid that.  
One more thing, I cooked it the full four hours but the sauce was  not thickening, instead it looked to be separating. Even after stirring a bit.  I added a bit of flour and stirred it at times keeping my eye on it.  The sauce thickened eventually.

Tender, creamy, delicious dish. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and cooked them on low since I knew I would be gone longer than 3 hours. Hint for those who think it is too salty: don't salt your noodles while they are cooking. Instead, wait and see if you need the extra salt at the table. I don't need to salt my noodles at all when I use this to top them.

This has to be the best meal I've ever made in the slow cooker.  I didn't have 6 chicken breasts, but two very large ones that I cut up.  Don't think I used a full 8 ounces of cream cheese but only because I didn't have a full container.  Oh, and I guess the biggest difference was I didn't have a packet of italian seasoning, but I did have a french onion packet (you know, the french onion soup mix).  SO good!  But next time I'm going to use everything this recipe calls for.  This is going to be a regular meal in our house now.

This recipe turned out exceptionally well for us.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except for cooking the chicken on low for six hours in lieu of on high for three hours.  I used three breasts in lieu of six, which was plenty for the amount of sauce.  I cooked 8 oz of spaghetti noodles and added them into the crockpot for the last 30 min of cooking.  A definite keeper for us!  Thanks for sharing Elbypasta!

Great recipe!  I used reviewer Alex's recommendation and the dish was excellent!  I made a few modifications, I added a cup more broth and since I didn't have cream of chicken soup, I just added heavy cream (about 2 cups.. with 2 tsp of corn starch to thicken) and cooked for another 3 hours. I served it over plain white rice and with garlic toast as another reviewer recommended. My picky 16 year old cleaned his plate and my husband loved it.  This will be a regular in our house now!

I thought the spice packet was a bit too much, but I love the creaminess of the dish.  I think I will try using my own spices next time, so it doesn't overwhelm the flavors so much.

I made it almost as is - I chopped up the chicken, added more garlic, and after tasting the sauce I added some oregano and black pepper.  It was OK, but just OK.  I think kids would love it but I guess we're used to meals with a bit more flavor.

This was a big hit for my family!  I added portabello mushrooms towards the last few hours.  I sprinkled red pepper flakes over mine, as I like a little bit of a kick.  I was thinking about adding some roasted red peppers next time.  Highly recommended!!!

My family and I loved eating this tonight! We ate it over store-bought egg noodles. I replaced the chicken stock for water and it was still really flavorful. I definitely don't think you need to bother with the chicken stock. The Italian dressing mix and cream of chicken soup have quite enough sodium as it is, anyway. I also replaced the butter with extra virgin olive oil. I think in the future I may make it with peas or mushrooms. Very good! Thanks for the recipe!

Myself and family does not like the "look" of white chicken; so I browned the chicken in butter, onions and garlic prior to putting in the slow cooker.  I, also, put in a large can of cream of chicken soup and used yogurt versus the cream cheese...............it got wonderful reviews..."Please make this again".

I love this recipe, the Italian seasoning packet is great add.  I now just add a few things that make it even better.  I add 1/2-1 bag of frozen mixed vegies.  I also use Cream of mushroom soup instead and add 1/2 can of cream to it instead of chicken broth.  For the noodles I make 2 packs of chicken flavored ramen noodles and only add 1 of the seasoning packets.  I add the noodles right before ready to serve.  I add some of the juice, but not all.  Just depending on thin or thick you want the sauce.

I made this almost exactly as written, but since I was actually using frozen chicken breasts, I sliced them up before putting them in to cook a little faster. I'm confident that I wouldn't have had to do that, but it worked great. I also don't chop onions, so I used frozen chopped onion. I had a LOT of extra sauce, so next time I'll add twice as much chicken to have plenty for guests or left-overs. This made 5-6 servings but could have easily been 8 with more chicken. Even though this has no sour cream in it, that's what it tastes like, which is a great, rich sauce if you like that. But if you don't like sour cream, this is not the recipe for you, even though it's not even an ingredient.

Made to the "T" and turned out amazing! Not too salty - everyone loved it! Use fresh garlic in your sauce for full flavour. Will make again all the time! Served with egg noodles.

I am always looking for easy, yummy crockpot recipes and I will make this one again. I did make some intentional and sort of unintentional changes to it and it still came out great. The first intentional change was to use thighs instead of breasts; I always find that breasts come out dry in a crockpot even if they are swimming in liquid. Also, when I made this I had about 20 minutes to throw something into the crockpot and get out of the house, so instead of doing the recipe in two stages as recommended I fried the onions and put everything into the pot at once (except for the cream cheese). My crockpot runs really hot so two and a half hours on high was all that was needed. I ended up completely forgetting the cream cheese and it was still really tasty ... Add to that the fact that I used reduced fat cream of chicken and it was a pretty light version of the recipe, too. Thanks for sharing!

This tasted AMAZING!  Both my husband and I loved it.  It was super easy to make.  I used half butter and half brummel and brown to save calories, and also used light cream cheese and light cream of chicken soup.  It was still amazing.  I also didn't melt the Brummel and Brown prior to putting it on the chicken, just spread it on.  YUM!

This was amazing! I cooked the chicken in the broth, removed chicken to shred it and poured the broth into a skillet to make the sauce. Added the shredded chicken back to slow cooker and then poured the sauce over top. Also added some steamed broccoli . Everyone had seconds and some had thirds!

Followed the recipe ingredients using frozen chicken and cooking it with everything besides the cream cheese which I added at the end.  I also added my veggies of carrots and peas to it so it was a one pot meal.  Served over noodles. Flavors were ok but nothing outstanding for me.

This was delicious, and there was A LOT. I'm not really good with making recipes into my own but this recipe leaves a lot of room for additions, to make it your own. I think in my next batch I will use more onions and fresh mushrooms. I also used a bag of shredded mozarella cheese to kind of make everything cheesy and yummy. My family loved this. I put some buffalo sauce on my bowl and ate it like that. I served it with french bread and bruschetta.

I loved the taste of this and will make it again.  It turned out a little too soupy for my taste, but hey, I'll add more chicken now and see if I can correct for that later.  
 
The finished product was super salty, and that doesn't work for a family member.  Next time I'll use lower sodium and salt-free versions of what I can, i.e., unsalted butter and lower sodium cream of chicken soup.

Good recipe, will add to the rotation for sure. Needed a little something though, so we added some red pepper flakes and salt and pepper on serving. Also grated half a cup of sharp cheddar cheese to sprinkle on top.

I followed the other recipes where I added the broth to the chicken initially on low for 4hrs with the Italian seasoning and sautéed the onions and garlic and added the cream of chicken and cream cheese for another hour. I also did add some sliced fresh mushrooms. Great recipe and definitely will make again! I did end up adding more broth which made it a bit soupy but added cornstarch to thicken it up.

This was amazing and delicious.  I've used very little onion and garlic, since it can be overwhelming at times. I've paired this with Reames's egg noodles.  Since I have leftovers, I might eat it alone or do it with pasta next week.

I made it twice, when using the Italian dressing packet, it was too salty.  I also made it with Italian seasoning from the spice section of the grocery store, much better!!!!!

This recipe is a family favorite! 
I use Ranch dressing instead of Italian, but it tastes great with either!
Serve with egg noodles or rice and steamed veggies. You will not be sorry!!

It was okay but too rich for our tastes.  Did not change the recipe. It may have been said before; but the chicken must be shredded after the cooking is done or else it is too watery.

loved it! it was a hit! I threw everything in the crock pot all except the cream cheese. so i used boneless and skinless chicken breast I used a cup of chicken broth, the Italian seasoning, some fresh garlic, onion powder and garlic powder. I used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken and threw it all in the crock pot. cooked it on low for 8 hours. The meat just fell apart. And in the last hour I put a pack of cream cheese and lots of shredded cheese and boiled some noodles. it was awesome! I will make this again!

I added mushrooms and frozen peas.. and changed the cream of chicken to cream of mushroom. Cooked the mushrooms with the garlic and onions, added all the wet ingredients and added to the crockpot with one hour remaining. Added the frozen peas on top. I also cooked the chicken in chicken broth in the crockpot and not just melted butter. After it was done, I cooked spaghetti, mixed it all together and put it in a baking dish, covered with bread crumbs and melted butter and put in the oven for about 15 mins. Absolutely delicious!!

Very good over rice as well. First, I added the chicken broth to boneless chicken thighs sprinkled with pepper.  After 3 hrs. on low, I added the remaining ingredients (I was two ounces short of cream cheese) in addition to carrots, peas, and  just a dash of cayenne pepper, for another 1 1/2 hrs. on low heat.   Sirracha was served at  the table to be added individually to taste (a few drops made this even better!). 
I typically don't rave about crock pot meals, but this was really very good!  Thank you for the recipe!  Everyone loved it!

Used a little less butter and a little more chicken broth, and added chopped green pepper and some shredded carrots for color. Served with egg noodles...this had great flavor and you can't tell you used the 'cream of ' soup in the sauce.

My family loved this (including 4 year old).  I did not have time to wait on the crock pot so I cooked the chicken in the oven and the sauce on the stove.  I did end up adding a little more chicken stock but that was it.

A very simple dish to put together with tender and creamy results.  I didn't have the dry Italian dressing so I added oregano, basil, parsley, paprika, celery salt, herbs de provence, salt and pepper (probably a 1/3 teaspoon of each). I also added frozen peas for the last hour of cooking, then served over linguine.  This one is a keeper.

Easy and flavorful. I didn't see the directions to add the spaghetti or noodles, but I enjoyed spaghetti with mine. It makes a lot. I might add vegetables to this recipe in the future.

It was really good, and the chicken was so tender! The only thing is, it was very very rich and filling, that we could only have one plate. Very heavy meal, but oh so tasty!

This came out pretty good. I made my own cream base using half and half instead of the canned soup. I doubled the broth and cream cheese. I diced the onions instead of leaving them in rings. I added 3 diced jalapeños and some carrots. Next time I'd probably add peas too. Thanks for the recipe:)

Delicious! I usually don't rate recipes unless I follow them exactly, but I am going to go ahead with this one since it was a minor change. My change? Only four breasts because that's all I had. As such, I reduced the amount of dried Italian dressing stuff by about a third. I also topped with some fresh parsley and served over fettuccini noodles. The end result was perfect! My three friends and I all agreed that I needed to add this to my list of regulars.

Delicious. Used Italian herb blend instead of dressing mix. Threw everything in the pot this morning except for the cream cheese. Thickened up the sauce with butter and flour. Added cream cheese and some fresh basil at the end. Wow.

We love this recipe as  a base, but changed the it up a bit.  We added extra chicken, pan grilled it and then shredded it.  Added Lipton Onion soup instead of the Italian soup mix.  Added very  finely chopped celery & carrots to the onion.  Also added a little sour cream to the mix!  Love it by itself with a few fresh baked rolls!

This is essentially the same recipe on the website whoneedsacape.com., except she calls it chicken stroganoff. Personally, this recipe, as written, lacks any real depth of flavor. I thought the Italian seasoning packet would add all the flavor necessary, but it isn't enough to stand up to the soup and cream cheese. This is an easy recipe that I intend on making again, but I will most definitely be tweaking the seasonings, in addition to adding a touch more salt. I did not find this recipe  at all.

Tip #1. Do not shred the chicken. Doing so will absorb the sauce and it will be very dry for a pasta dish. However, doing so made an amazing chicken salad. Then just add grapes, apples, nuts or whatever and serve on bread.

Made it,  but instead of using Italian seasoning I used ranch dressing (dry).  It was easy to prepare and it was delicious and I will be making this again!

Amazing. I didn't have an onion so omitted it. Was still an absolutely delicious dish. The chicken shredded beautifully when I added the cream cheese sauce. Cooked the remainder of the hour on low and it was one of the best dishes I've had in a long time.

Very good, followed recipe exact for first time and was delicious, next time i will use low sodium ingredients just because I am on a low sodium diet,  but did not have a " to much salt" taste at all in my opinion

It was good but we found it needs a little more flavor.  It was good but I found I could differentiate the cream of chicken soup too much.  Next time I would try to blacken the chicken to give it more flavor.

This was so good! I doubled the sauce ingredients because I wanted leftovers and I'm glad I did.  I also added celery, carrots, brussel sprouts, mushrooms and bell peppers.  I didn't have a powered dressing packet, so I poured about a cup of italian dressing over the chicken, and threw in an entire stick of butter :-)  Instead of putting it over pasta, I cut a spaghetti squash in half (length wise) and put the tetrazzini in the baked squash, sprinkled some cheese on top and baked it just long enough for the cheese to melt. DELICIOUS and very low carbs!!  Actually the tetrazinni could be eaten as a soup by itself.  It's a keeper!

Followed  the  instructions  pretty  closely  and  it  was  delicious.   Hubby  loved  it.   I  hate  that  it  calls  for  processed  ingredients  so  next  time  I'll  make  a  homemade  cream  of  chicken  soup  first.   This  time  I  did  use  Trader  Joe's  organic  low  sodium  chicken  broth  which  is  almost  as  good  as  homemade.  Thanks!

Hahaha, so I run the risk of writing yet another 'made-it-as-stated-but-here's-my changes' review, but here goes:

First of all, very good, but I did make some changes, one of which was unintentional...I did follow some other reviews that stated cooking all in the crock pot , so that's where I started.

I cut up four huge chicken breasts into thirds, put into the crock pot with about a cup of chicken broth (by day, I'm an exacting chemist, by night, I'm a seat of the pants cook), the Italian seasoning, 2 tablespoons of butter and a half a cup of cooking sherry.  Set the crock to high, and after an hour, I added a chopped small sweet onion, the garlic, and here's where I sorta messed up:  I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, um, they are right next to each other in the cabinet...since I had a lot of chicken, I added a can of cream of chicken as well, figuring, well, I wonder how this will turn out...

Let that cook on high for about four hours, then turned on low and added the cream cheese and started cooking the wide egg noodles.

The chicken was falling apart tender, the sauce was thick and tasty, I didn't soften the cream cheese enough as there were small chunks in the sauce and that was good thing - a really refreshing taste when you got a chunk in the sauce...

A total keeper and one we will repeat!

It was good, but it needs _something_ not sure what. I added peas and carrots to it. I cooked 4 chicken breasts, and ended up only adding two to the sauce. Served it over spaghetti.

I made this for tonight's dinner and we LOVED it.  I used the ingredients as listed except that I used a whole, cut up chicken instead of all breasts because I needed to use it up from the freezer. The night before I mixed all ingredients except onion together in a mixing bowl. I cut up the onion and put it on top and then covered with saran wrap and left in the fridge until morning.  In the morning, I skinned the chicken and put it in the crockpot first and covered with the ingredients from my bowl.  Oh, I added fresh mushroom too.  Turned it on low for 7 hours and went to work (mine has a timer and resets to warm when finished).  I removed the chicken from the sauce and shredded with two forks (too hot to handle).  With the chicken out, I mixed two tablespoons of corn starch with 2 tablespoons of water and added it to the sauce to let it thicken while I shredded the chicken and cooked the noodles.  I served over home made Amish egg noodles (because I saw them in the store and know that I love them).  DE-LISH.

I made this as close to the recipe as possible. I only had bone in chicken thighs. I will definitely make this again but use less of the Italian dressing, too salty for our taste. Thank you for sharing!

This is tasty and easy. I stirred in some steamed broccoli before serving, to give it some color, texture, and extra nutritional value. Was planning to serve the broccoli on the side, but the dish needed some visual appeal. :)

Very rich, flavorful, and creamy sauce, tender chicken breasts that easily shred, and simple to prepare (less time than most Crockpot dishes)!

This was super easy but I made a few minor changes. A couple hours into cooking I chopped up the chicken into chunks so all the pieces would absorb the sauce. I also diced the onion (medium) so it didn't overwhelm my four children. We're a family of six who loves flavorful dinners. So I doubled the dry Italian seasoning packets and the garlic. I also let it cook for six hours instead of four.  It turned out wonderful! Even my picky four year old loved it and everyone had seconds. I'll definitely be making this regularly because with six people in our family, we're always on the go.

This recipe was a real winner in my house! Very flavorful and super moist. My husband and I had a friend over the day I made it and the whole thing was gone in less than an hour! Needless to say it was a huge hit. I will definitely be making this many times over. As an experienced cook, I can say with confidence this is a keeper.

Really good flavor and the chicken was so tender.  I did add carrots and frozen peas.  And I used Italian seasoning because I didn't have salad dressing mix.  One note, if you use just seasoning you might add salt to taste.  But very good made without additions.  Thanks for sharing.

While I didn't cook it as written, it is an excellent starter base for anyone looking to try new things. My mods included adding carrots, peas and mushrooms. I cooked on Low for 6 hrs. Used 1 Cup of Chicken Broth and a can of Cream of Mushroom Soup. Other than those mods, everything else was as written. Really enjoyed it.

This was delicious. I used boneless thighs instead of breast meat then added some frozen peas and sliced mushrooms in the last hour...those along with the red onions I chopped added great flavor and color. Will make again soon!

I always hate to read made a few small changes...but sometimes you have too because of what you have on hand. I substituted Cream of Broccoli for Cream of Chicken.I used a whole can of Chicken broth and placed all ingredients except Cream Cheese in slow cooker on High for 4 hours. At last hour of cooking Shredded Chicken added cream cheese and can of sliced Mushrooms. Cooked 1lb. spaghetti and poured into buttered 9x13 baking dish, topped with parmesan cheese. Added Chicken mix and stirred. Placed in the oven while cooking a loaf of french bread to keep warm & served with a Salad. It was a hit!!

I've made this recipe many times. I followed advice from the reviews and cooked it on low in my slow cooker for 8 hours. Started adding canned carrot slices and made a huge difference! Great weekday staple meal, it's become a go-to for me. Super easy, set and forget.

Made almost exactly as written in the recipe (used Italian spices instead of Italian dressing mix, not sure if that could be it but we don't have Italian dressing mix here) and found it bland. The cream of chicken soup added a gross, synthetic/chemical flavor. It came out flaked/stringy. I tasted the chicken less than halfway through the cooking and it was tasty and already cooked through, but I decided to follow the recipe and added the condensed soup and cooked some more.

Made this exactly as directed. Tastes very nice and creamy, but quite salty! So easy to make. Next time, I will definitely add some carrots, peas and mushrooms to add veggies though because I really found it was lacking in that area. It would help round out the meal more.

I just tried this recipe. I gave it a 3 star because it was very easy to make. Other than that I didn't care for the taste of it. To each his own I guess. I did have to change part of it because I had no cream of chicken soup. Had to use cream of celery. Perhaps that is why it didn't taste right.  Other than that I followed the recipe all the way.  However I did like the first part of it, with just the butter and Italian dressing packet. Will make that part again for sure.

Followed this exactly but I had only frozen chicken breasts so cooked for 5.5 hours on low then an hour after the sauce added. Roasted some broccoli and mushrooms in oven and added to the recipe and served over bow tie noodles. My son asked if we can have this every Sunday!

Made this last night and it was a huge success.  I tweaked things a little..  added mushrooms and made my own Italian seasoning mix; cut the chicken into smaller pieces and cooked it on low for 6 hours.  But it was fabulous.  Will definitely add it to my go-to recipe box.

My kids loved it. I think I will try and cook it on low like other reviewers did and add the cream cheese later. While I didn't love it, i did like it.

Very good! Mixed everything together and poured over the uncooked chicken breasts, cooking on LOW for 3.5 hours (probably more than necessary). I removed the chicken and coarsely shredded. In the meantime, I added the Cream Cheese to the juices in the slow cooker, stirring thoroughly. I then returned the shredded chicken to the crock before serving over linguine.

I added peas and served it over angel hair. I used 98% fat free cream of chicken and this new Greek cream cheese that has only 3gms fat per serving instead of the 9gms full fat. Delicious!  My family loved it. I plan on serving it over rice next time.

I made this and thought it was delicious.  Everyone in the house liked it in fact.  I fixed white rice and noodles to serve over so they could have their choice.  I think mushrooms would also be good in this.

Delicious! My picky 7 year old even loved it.
I used boneless/skinless thighs because its what I had on hand. The meat was so tender & wonderful that I think I will use them again next time.
I also set the slow cooker to low instead of high.
I added fresh mushrooms to the onion, soup & cream cheese mixture on the stovetop.
One thing to note is that I think the thighs make a little more juice, so I poured off just a little of this after it cooked for a few hours & before I added the stovetop ingredients.
About 15 min before everything was done, I also added frozen green peas. 
Mmmmmm! You will love it!

Made it pretty much by the book except I used the 1c of broth and cream of mushroom as I didn't have chicken. Also added peas and carrots. My 6 and 4 year old loved it over whole wheat egg noodles. We'll do this simple recipe again!

Great recipe. I did two cans of soup and 2 cups of broth simply because I like the gravy! Added mushrooms and celery too. It came out really nice.

Sauce was great, I just don't understand how not to over cook chicken in crock pot. It was too tough.

I love this recipe!  So yummy.  I made the following changes to reduce the calories and increase nutritional value:
Add 2/3 cup of frozen peas and 2/3 cup of frozen carrots
Use reduced fat cream cheese

With these changes it is 211 calories for 1/6 of the tetrazini made from this recipe (not including pasta).  I found it to be a bit bland the first time that I made this, so I added extra garlic, garlic salt, onion powder and a sprinkle of chili powder.  Much better!

This one's a keeper!I made this for dinner tonight. I followed the recipe but substituted garlic powder for the fresh garlic. I also added some frozen peas and carrots to add appeal as it was a little bland looking. The sauce didn't thicken enough for me in the crock so I poured the sauce from the crock and used a roux to thicken it a little. I then poured it back over the chicken in the crock. I served it over egg noodles along with a green salad and garlic bread. This was very good. My husband even liked it and he's not crazy about pasta. Very good recipe and oh, so easy.

This is so good! I halved the butter (probably could have skipped altogether,) doubled the chicken broth, and put everything in the slow cooker at once (except the cream cheese as another reviewer suggested) to cook all day while I was at work.  When I got home I added cream cheese and cooked bow tie pasta- delicious!  I even froze some in 1 cup sizes to bring to work and it's just as good as the day I made it.  Hubby liked it too!

I thought this was OK, but didn't care much for the Italian dressing mix.  My family really liked it.

I made this recipe over the weekend with a few substitutions, served it over minute-made rice, and my boyfriend and I loved it (made for great leftovers!):

1. I cut 3 large chicken breasts in half and coated them with olive oil instead of butter.  I only used 1/2 the italian dressing packet (to try and cut out the sodium).

2. I cooked the breasts on high for about an hour and a half, and they were cooking pretty fast in my crockpot so I turned it to low for the remainder (still adding the mixture at the end of hour 3 for 1 hr).

3. I used a few dashes of onion powder instead of onions and I added a medley of frozen veggies to my broth/cheese/soup mixture for some color.

Tip: I didn't realize how much juice was in the bottom of the crockpot from the chicken so I had used a little more chicken broth than I probably needed to when making the mixture that you pour over them, it didn't hurt it, but it was a little thinner than I would have liked.

This one's a keeper!! I blew it. I got stuck at a doc appt for my daughter and overcooked the chicken. It was a bit dry. But the rest, the sauce... fan-freakin-tastic!! I loved it. Maybe this is kinda obvious but I likened it to Beef Stroganoff for chicken. LOL I laid it over some egg noodles and only had leftovers for one day! I'll be making this again. Maybe mushrooms next time, too? Hmmm.... I'll let you know. ;)

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful. Very rich and the flavour was amazing. My Hubby and I enjoyed it over Basmati rice for two meals and tonight I called my son to see if they had already started dinner. They eat at completely different hours than we do (we're retired & early eaters). Anyway he came over and picked up a dish of the Chicken Tetrazzini. He just called to let me know that they loved it. They also had it over Basmati rice and want it again to try with noodles and he want to know when that will be. Aren't kid terrific.

Yikes! Can't use milk! When I got to the store to buy the ingredients, I realized the recipe used milk products, which we were told to stay away from for a couple of weeks. Since I was pretty much committed to the recipe, I substituted a whole 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth (instead of 1/2 cup), a 12 oz. jar of classic chicken gravy (instead of cream of chicken soup), a medium size onion (instead of a small), and left out the cream cheese altogether. I cooked everything in the order given, but after combining the ingredients and cooking for the last hour, turned the slow cooker off for two hours, then turned it on low for an hour before serving (this allowed all the new ingredients to blend nicely). Amazingly, the substitutions worked, and I even had a request for the recipe.

Easy to make and tasted great. The only thing I did different was add 1/4 cup chicken stock to the breasts while cooking but every thing else was according to the recipe.  It's a keeper for sure.

Fussy for a slow cooker recipe, but yummy even following to the letter. I prefer to throw everything raw in the crockpot at noon (increase broth to 1c, decrease dressing 1/2 packet due to saltiness), leave it on low 6 hours and add 4 oz. cream cheese a few minutes before serving. I also add 6-8 oz diced mushrooms 20min before serving and shred the chicken. Yum!

Tried this recipe today but made some changes trying to reduce amount of sodium. I used skinless thighs because I prefer the taste and cost less. Instead of using Italian type seasoning instead of dressing mix packet, omited chicken broth, and added mushrooms while I was cooking the onions. I served it over bread because I thought I had noodles but didn't. Came out very tender and flavorful and most importantly, the kids liked it too!

It was a hit with the family.  I made a couple changes...I used skinless chicken thighs (about 12; for a family of 6 hungry ones), substituted 1T of homemade italian dressing mix for the pre-packaged version (less salty too), I added about 1/4 white wine, and cut the cream cheese to 4 oz. (and used 1/3 less fat kind).  Chicken was easily broken up with a fork.  Served over spaghetti noodles, with broccoli, salad, and garlic bread on the side.  Would love to add sauteed mushrooms and toasted almonds to the sauce, but then family would groan.  It's a keeper.

I made it for dinner tonight and it was a hit!  The entire family said it was keeper!  They even used the yummy sauce to drizzle over broccoli (and the extra bonus is they ate all their broccoli!!)  

I used Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup because that is what I had available and it was yummy.

After reading the reviews, I cooked on low and add carrots after 4 hours and frozen peas toward the end.  I like lots of sauce, so used just three chicken breasts which ended up being fine.  Very good, with little prep work involved.

I made this for the first time today & it was a huge hit with my kids! My husband hasn't tried it yet, but I  know he'll love it! My 5 yr, old & 22 month old gobbled it up! I served it over wide egg noodles, & we had sliced fresh apples with it & a nice cold glass of milk! so proud of my kiddos for loving it! You made Mama proud!

Followed the instructions almot to the letter.  Instead, I put the chicken broth in with the chicken to slow cook.  Then, when the onions were done, I took the broth from the slow cooker and pour into the onions and other ingriedients... FANTASTIC!!!

Yummy! I used white wine instead of chicken broth. The entire dish went quickly. Will make again.

I make this recipe often, my family loves it!  The only change I have made is to marinate the chicken in Italian dressing, I never have dry Italian dressing.  I don't think this changes the flavor but I have never made it any other way!

Very yummy! I didn't have an onion, so I used a little onion powder and I did what other did and added the sauce after an hour of the chicken cooking. Will make this again for sure!
