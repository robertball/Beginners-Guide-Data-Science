Very easy way to make pasta in sauce... one less step! No need to drain, so one less dish to wash! I usually use a 26 oz jar of sauce with 1 lb of pasta, so I added an additional cup of water to the sauce (for a total of 3 cups), brought that to a boil, then added a whole box of pasta spirals.

I have made this several times.  The first time I made it exactly as written.  The cooking method is great--the method gets 5 stars from me.  Sure, there is one less pot to clean up, which is great, of course.  But what I liked even better was that by cooking the pasta in the sauce, it eliminated that little ring of water that always seems to gather around the edge of my plate when I have pasta with sauce.  It also ensures that all the noodles are covered in sauce.  However, I had to deduct 2 stars from my rating because the sauce comes out tasting rather bland.  However, after making this a few more times, I was able to take care of that problem.  Instead of mixing in 2 cups of water, I use 1 cup of water, and 1 cup of tomato juice (I prefer V8 Hot & Spicy to give the sauce a bit of a kick).  I also always add a pound of browned ground beef, because I don't like meatless pasta dishes.  I will continue to make this recipe with my changes, because I love the cooking method.

Gave this 4 stars as it had to be tweeked, but maybe my family likes salt and seasoning too much.  I always wanted to cook the noodles IN the sauce but thought adding water to the sauce would, well, water it down. I was wrong, I will never make jar spaghetti any other way.  Instead of using water, I used chicken broth (base) and three cups of it too!  Of course I added my own special fixings, like smoked sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions, etc.  I also used one can of canned chopped Italian-style tomatoes.  Never tasted sooooo good!!

This recipe was fabulous.  Every noodle was covered with sauce so no need to worry about the sauce sliding off the noodle (which is what usually happens for me).  I made ground beef with onions and garlic in a separate pan and poured it in the pan after the spaghetti was done.  I will always cook my noodles in the sauce in the future.

Wonderful would have never thought to boil the pasta with the sauce.....all those years of sphaghetti meals wasted....I used 3 cups of Chicken Broth and added Itailian sausage, ground beef, sauted green onion/peppers/garlic. Wonderful ! Double the portion and was able to freeze some...didn't last the week in the freezer.

This is awesome!  And oh so very easy!  I've made this as written six times in the last three weeks as it's really quick to "whip up" after a tiring day at work and it is awesome in its simplicity and taste.  Tonight, I worked late and stomach was a little queasy, so to cut down on the acid of the sauce, I added a tsp of lemon juice, 1 tsp of sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  To add protein to mine, I added 1/4 cup of cottage cheese and nuked in the microwave for 45 seconds.  (Hubby doesn't like cottage cheese.)  Mine was still awesome!  This is a Classy Classic and forever in my repertoire so that I can call myself a Gourmet! :D

Five stars for ease. Straight forward - sauce and pasta. I used Barilla marinara and whole grain noodles with a dusting of parmesan cheese - good but not WOW!  Basic I'm hungry fix it fast pasta.

I'm giving it 5 stars because the finished product was fantastic. I changed it a bit because I felt like there would be way too much sauce. I used a pound of spaghetti, added 3 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of whole milk, and still had to add more liquid to ensure the noodles were fully cooked. I also added some ground beef with onion, peppers and garlic once the noodles were done cooking, and it was amazing. I don't know if I'll ever make spaghetti the "conventional" way again.

This was great!  I can't believe I've never made spaghetti like this before.  I don't think I had enough spaghetti as my son said it seemed really saucy so will increase that a little bit for next time but made it just as said (chicken broth vs. water) and I loved it!

We didn't like this at all. It tasted pasty.  Ordinarily we drain the pasta water, which is very starchy, then serve the spaghetti.  In this recipe that starchy water is part of the dish.  Not a good feel.

Didn't turn out like I wanted it too.  I'll try again, but maybe I'll use thin spaghetti instead of regular!  I added garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper before adding the pasta.

I read all the reviews before I started and decided to use 2 cups of water and a cup of fire roasted tomatos with garlic (almost the entire can). I thought this would solve the problem of needing more liquid without watering down the flavor. I used whole grain pasta. It worked. Because the pasta was  more dense I had to increase the cooking time by about 7 minutes. You just have to test it so the pasta is just how you like it. I also added small precooked meatballs at the very beginning. This came out really good. I used 1/2 of a box of spaghetti noodles and broke half of them and kept half long. I will make this again for sure! Try it yourself.

I never knew you can cook pasta with the sauce. It took about 30-45 mins to cook as I don't like my pasta that hard. It was a hit in the dinner table. I will definitely try different types of one pot pasta receipts after this experience

I have to say I was skeptical but it turned out great!  I sauteed some onion, bell pepper, mushrooms and zuchini in olive oil before adding the sauce and water...turned out great!  I did have to add some more water while simmering as the noodles weren't quite al dente yet.

So simple!  But so easy!  A great "Oops I didn't make dinner" meal that doesn't result in fast food.   5 stars for simplicity - add to it what you'd like to make up different tastes.  Me?  A Jalepeno, ground beef, an onion, and chicken stock to make the flavour go further.  But this would totally work as is!

By far the best way to make Spaghetti. Recipe is perfect!!! I added an extra cup of water, suggested by other reviewers, but I think 2 cups would have been fine too.

My kids loved this recipe, and it was very convenient to cook it all in one pot.  I added mozarella cheese at the end.  Very good!
