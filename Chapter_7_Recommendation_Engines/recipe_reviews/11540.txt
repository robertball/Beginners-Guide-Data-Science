Made a half recipe to use in the Homemade Banana Pudding Pie recipe. Do not look like the boxed ones but still good!

This recipe makes an edible cookie. However I agree with previous review: not wafer crispy and could be sweeter. Also used it in banana pudding: they remained firm/didn't soak in the pudding. With a bit of tweaking this could be a good recipe.

Plain tasting really dry. Need a drink after each bite. Nothing like boxed vanilla wafers. Fragile cookies easily fall apart. Won't make again.

1st use a smaller portion than the tablespoon, you'll get more cookies.  I added more vanilla and still need to add more.  Not real sweet or crispy, but they remind me of the old fashioned tea-cakes.  I took some to bible study and to work and got good reviews from all.  I have sent the link to this recipe with others who like just a little cookie with their coffee (me) or tea.  Could be a little sweeter though.  This recipe was quicker than the one I saw that you had to roll and refrigerate.  I might try that one later.

My grandkids liked these cookies. I had to refrigerate these for about 2 hours because the cookies were sticky. I used a teaspoon to make small cookies and I used the palm of my hand to press down the cookies.
