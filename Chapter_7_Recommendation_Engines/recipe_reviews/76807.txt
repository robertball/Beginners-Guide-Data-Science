The Chambord and Honey do not mix well at all and certainly don't float in the drink.

Wonderfully refreshing. Light Crisp and delicious. The honey is a wonderful touch in taste and for it's asthetic value in the drink! Great recipe.

I used cherry vodka instead of raspberry. These were very sweet (almost syrupy) & very strong...won't make again...sorry.
