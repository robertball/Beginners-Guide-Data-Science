This was very tasty.  It has the potential to be 5 star with a few changes.  I found that there was not enough sauce, so I will double it next time.  10 minutes is too long cooking the tomatoes; they fall apart.  I also cut the chicken into strips and put it over pasta.  I think adding feta and artichokes would be a nice addition.  I added crushed red pepper for a little spice the first time, but will try the feta and artichoke next time and see what happens.  I do have to say this though, it does make a nice aroma.  My husband told me as he was walking up to our apartment he was thinking, 'I hope this is coming from my apartment'.

UPDATE:  This recipe has grown on me.  I give it 5 stars with the following changes.  1. Double the sauce  2. Use diced canned tomatoes with juice  3. Use boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut in cubes.  Enjoy!

Five points: 1) I followed this recipe almost to a T.  We only used dried oregano & basil instead of fresh, b/c both herbs go bad so much more quickly than I can use them.  2) re: kid-friendly: my three year old ate the chicken, but resisted the new flavor of the olives.  But we don't feed him mac & cheese or hot dogs, so maybe his tastes won't translate to all American children.  Someone raised the wine question; alcohol cooks off in recipes.  There's no reason not to expand aa child's tastes with this great recipe!  3)My husband, who adores everything throat-burning hot, tried the suggested red pepper flakes sprinkled on top after tasting the authentic recipe & definitely prefered it as written.  4)Next time, we'll cut the Kalamata olives up into almost a tapenade, b/c the olive MADE this recipe & should be tasted in every bite.  5) We served the meal over a bed of basmati rice--good for soaking up all the delicate sauce.  Next time--vermicelli.

I made this yesterday at a grocery store food demo and it was a success.  Fresh tomatoes are not in season so I used canned no-salt diced tomatoes; omitted the parsley and used Italian seasoning instead of fresh basil; used dried thyme instead of fresh.  Everyone enjoyed it so I'll definitely make this again!

Read thru reviews and decided this one would be good to try.  Used the can of diced tomatoes as someone suggested and used Italian seasoning in place of the basil.  My husband loved it!  I enjoyed how easy it was to make such a great dish.  Thanks Robyn.

Went over really well, and it was fun to make!  Just make sure the oil and wine are mixed before putting them in the pan.  I had wine spitting everywhere on my first attempt!!!  I also omitted the olives, added oregano and topped it with mozzarella cheese...

Good kalamata olives are the key to this dish.  I paired it with Wild Rice.  However, afterwards I realized a great appetizer would have been to use some of the diced tomatos and some of the kalamata olives (with the oil) on a great bread with a bit of oregano and black pepper, to make Bruschetta.  I tried it afterwards -- perfect!  Also, I had a guest who was vegetarian, so I made an addt'l serving with Talapia (fish) instead of chicken, I actually liked it better!

Flavorful recipe. i used Spanish olives because I didn't have the Kalamata. The sauce was too runny, though, so I've had to thicken it some with cornstarch - which sort of changed its taste...

This is one of my favorite recipes. I usually make it with chicken breast halves with the rib bones in. I always add more lemon juice because I've notice that the pan starts to scorch if there is not enough juice. I also add a bit more garlic (another clove) it helps cut the spice a little bit. Make sure you baste.

Very good. I only used two chicken breasts, but kept the same amounts for the rest of the ingredients so there was plenty of sauce. I used a can of diced tomatoes (with liquid), used dried herbs (add these at the same time as the diced tomatoes) and manzanilla olives. When the chicken was added back into the pan, I added about 2/3 cup of frozen tortellini to cook for the last 7 minutes.

Healthy and delicious.... this is an excellent recipe! I used: Fresh roma tomatoes, a mixture of lemon basil and regular basil, and quality kalamata olives. I tried to use all fresh ingredients. When seasoning with salt & pepper, I also added a touch of curry powder tossed with a cup of reduced fat feta and some whole wheat rotini pasta. AMAZING.

AMAZING!!! I made this for when my parents visited, they were so impressed! I took others' advice and used stewed tomatos, it was much easier because I had them on hand, and I added onions and green peppers with the tomatos. Also, I diced the chicken into large cubes and sauted them more wine and less oil. I searved this with white rice and Im definatly making this again!

5 stars!   I sauteed boneless breasts in a cast iron pan and proceeded with recipe except I put it all in the oven at 300 for 20 minutes to finish.

this was delicious! even my boyfriend, who hates olives, loved it and called it a 'definite make again'! i wasn't too exact with the measurements because my measuring cups were in the dishwasher- it's a forgiving recipe. i used a can of tomato puree instead of three cups tomatoes and some extra white wine to have a liquidy sauce, then i cooked some cheese tortellini right in the pan with the chicken at the last step. turned out great!

This was very good - sauce has great flavor, there's just not enough of it.  I took the advice of some other raters and used canned diced tomatoes and it turned out well.  Don't do as another reviewer said and try to thicken the sauce with cornstarch.  This is not meant to be a traditional spaghetti sauce...it's much lighter and contemporary. Smells wonderful cooking.

This is a very good chicken dish, especially considering how easy it is.  I cut the chicken breasts in half so they would cook more quickly and used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly as written.  The chicken was very tender and flavorful.  I served it with hummus, pita bread, and spanakopita.  Delicious!

Agree with Jezebel, that the wine caused extreme spitting and splattering.  I won't bother with that, next time.  I don't think it really adds anything to use wine at the beginning.  The other change I made to the process was to place the chicken back in the pan after the tomatoes and wine in step 2, and cover with a lid.  The chicken and the sauce are ready at the same time, the sauce stays nice and fresh tasting, and the liquid doesn't evaporate.  Yes, the sauce is thin, due to the fresh tomatoes, but not objectionable, in my opinion.  I served with brown rice.

We liked diced canned tomatoes in this just fine tho when tomatoes come into season I am sure we will do it that way as well.. We cut the cooked chicken into slices before returning it to the sauce. I wasn't sure if we even liked kalamata olives and apparently we like them best in small doses and chopped very small. We want the flavor to be present but just a little bit is better than a whole half cup at our house :) Used a leftover chardonnay from the fridge and that was a tasty addition. Healthy, flavorful and quick, really a painless way to cut fat and calories. Yay! thanks for posting it!

My entire family thought this was really good. Some of the reviews talked about the "amount of chopping"  I actually added more chopped vegetables (mushrooms, zucchini, yellow squash and egg plant) and it was well worth every minute.  Like others I cubed the chicken, but be careful not to overcook.  I also used one can of diced roasted garlic tomatoes instead of fresh, and in place of basil and thyme, I used a generous amount of Italian Seasoning and some cumin.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  My family loved it.  Everyone had more than one serving.  I still had some left over and I have to say reheated for lunch the following day it was even better (I think the sauce acted like a marinade over night).  Very good, will definitely serve this again.

This is dee-lish - soooo flavorful.  Coarsely cubed chicken, used crushed basil tomatoes (in cupboard), and stirred in fresh baby spinach when adding olives. Thinking petite peas might be nice too. Served over saffron rice.  YUM.  Thank you, Robyn.

Wow, I followed the recipe pretty closely with the exception of the chicken parts I used & I was more liberal with the wine & garlic! hee hee  I used a whole cut up chicken and added about 1/2 cup more wine and several more garlic cloves than called for....it was a big hit at my dinner party this evening.  The chicken was cooked through and juicy & the sauce was perfection! At the very end I crumbled up feta to sprinkle on along with the fresh chopped parsley. I served with brown basmati rice, salad and steamed veggies it was soo good.  I would definitely recommend!!

Found that there was definetly not enough sauce, and the parsley over powered it a bit. Otherwise very pleasant dish.

This dish was wonderful and healthy. I did add a small can of artichokes and scaled it down to 4 for the two of us. Also added feta cheese to the top as others had done.
Will definitely make this again! Thanks for a great recipe.

Tasted great and had a very mediterranean taste. Even the kids gobbled it up. Very easy to make and didn't take much time.

I did as others suggested and used the diced tomatoes and this recipe turned out very well. The whole rest of my family enjoyed it. However, recently i have developed an intense dislike for fresh parsley, and the taste of it proved to much for me. It was still edible, and minus the parsley would have been fantastic.

Delicious!! My only changes were I used dried herbs in place of fresh because I didn't have any fresh herbs, I used cherry tomatoes cut in half, and I omitted the olives because I didn't have any. My step-mother said the sauce was so good she could eat that by itself. I will be making this again, possibly with some feta cheese sprinkled on top.

Tasty sauce, but chicken's too dry.  Will chop chicken into smaller pieces next time to allow it to absorb the flavor of the sauce

Loved it!  Even my hard-to-please fiancé and picky son both loved it!  Only changes were doubling the sauce, and adding artichoke hearts and feta as per suggestions of others.  Also I used shallots instead of onion because we prefer that. I served it with a mixed wild/colored rice that I cooked with a splash of the same wine and shallots.  Put feta in the rice, too and we all went crazy for it.  Will make again and again.

Although I modified this a bit due to what was on hand, I believe I achieved the same result--delish!  I used sliced black olives and vermouth (about 1/2 the amount), canned diced tomatoes, and Greek seasoning.  After cooking, I cut each chicken breast half in half again. I served it on top of orzo and garnished with feta cheese.  It was a beautiful dish.

Following earlier suggestions I used 2 large cans of diced tomatoes, doubled the garlic and fresh basil, added crushed red pepper, hot sauce and sprinkled on a little dried thyme.  I also used a jar of spaghetti sauce to thicken the sauce.  Just before serving I removed the chicken (which I had cut into strips) to a separate platter and sprinkled it with kalamata olives, toasted pine nuts and feta cheese.  I served thin spaghetti and the sauce in separate bowls and let each person help himself.  A resounding success.  Really good.

I'm rating it five because the sauce was so delicious.  But the chicken was kind of bland even with salt and pepper.  I think next time I will season the chicken a bit more before cooking.

Delicious and easy to make!  Love that it's low in fat too!  I didn't have enough olives so I added some capers too and to round this out I also added some squash so my kids would get their veggies too!  Definitely a do over!

Acidential put a can of diced potatoes with greenchiles in the mix.  Fantastic for me, other hates spicey.  Also added some greek feta cheese
and served over orzo.  One of the easiest and best recipes.  Definately in my regular rotation.
So simple but so good.  Like it hot try a can of petite chiles with green chiles

Easy to make, delicious, healthy.  I added some feta cheese on top.  It got a little soupy with the juice from the tomatoes, so I'll probably use canned tomatoes next time and drain them.  Served with couscous.

I liked the sauce created in this recipe. The cooked chicken itself had very little favor.  I plan to make the sauce, add feta cheese and use it as a omelet filling.

This was a great recipe!  We doubled the sauce like everyone else that has reviewed it, and it was delicious!  We used diced canned tomatoes.  I was afraid it would taste like white wine since I don't care for it, but you couldn't even taste it!  It was delicious!  I recommend serving bruschetta as an appetizer before this...it compliments it well!

Very good! A nice change of pace for a chicken dish. I did splurge on the Kalamata olives (they are expensive in our small-town grocery!); next time I think I'll try just green ones. I also added eggplant, as I had one to use and it worked nicely.

Why would you mix oil and wine at the start?  The two don't mix and will only cause spattering, unless you cook less than 200 degrees and get greasy chicken.  I could see making a marinade, but still you would only cook in oil.  Saute' over high heat to develop your flavor and brown the meat.  Use to wine to deglaze.  Otherwise, not a bad recipe.  Not  sure a real outcome was planned.  Is this a "saucy" dish or not?  Think ahead to accomplish what you want...

I was very happy with the reults! I followed the recipe except for using a dusting of salt and pepper seasoned flour on the chicken. I had to use addtional wine and oil to keep the chicken from sticking - my pans fault or the choice to use flour. And I used a 28oz can of Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes. And I only had dried thyme on hand, scaled it down to one teaspoon.

I often make this dish as comfort food or to cook for family and friends. I really enjoy the vegetables and chicken together and like it that this is not a heavy feeling meal. I usually substitute chicken thighs for the breasts as I like the colour and the flavour of them better with this meal.

Have made this several times and always good.  For a twist :) I made it with Mahi Mahi and it was equally as good.  I serve this on a bed of rice or quinoa with some chopped up spinach or kale and then layer on top.  My husband loves it!!

I loved this recipe, and I'm not normally a fan of kalamata olives (despite being a fan of mediterranean food). I made this for my husband and I and serviced over rice. I tried to stick as true to the recipe as I could for an accurate review - the only things I did differently were using canned diced low sodium tomatoes instead of fresh chopped (what we had at the house), using dried spices (again, it's what we had at the house), and I cubed the chicken before I sauted it. I did make sure to to cut the olives up really finely. Even the next day reheating it at work, everyone at both my office and my husband's remarked at how amazing it smelled. I will definitely make again.

Five Stars~ I used a combination of pureed tomatoes (from fridge), small can of diced and a cupful of sliced grape tomatoes. Chicken is definitely better cut up in chunks after sauteeing. Great comments and recipe!

Was a very easy to make recipe.  I used a can of chopped tomatoes that had some seasoning in them as well.  I was drinking white wine while I was cooking so I would pour some in here and there as the pan got dry.  Chicken turned out tender and full of flavor.

This is a FABULOUS recipe!  I used chicken tenderloins and seasoned them with garlic, salt & pepper.  When the whole dish was done cooking, I took some tongs and broke the chicken roughly into pieces.  I also doubled the sauce and used a large can of diced tomatoes.  This dish smells as good as it tastes!

For the amount of work required, this recipe was a complete dud. The chicken turned out bland and boring.

I made this recipe the other day.  It came out so good!  I varied the recipe a bit because I didn't have fresh tomatoes in the house.  I substituted it with tomato sauce and added sweet red peppers.  I also cut the chicken into cubes.  I will be adding this to my rotation!

I really thought this was going to be tasty with all the fresh ingredients, but it just wasn't.  I made this recipe exactly as posted and I thought it was flavorless, except for the olives.  Too bad.  Won't make it again.

The only positive result that this recipe generated for my family was great taste.  Other than that, the product looked weak and did not present well nor have enough sauce.  There was too much chopping required to generate such a low-caliber end-product.  I won't be making this item again.

I made this true to speed but used tilapia instead of chicken and two cans of organic diced tomatoes. It’s June, and tomatoes are still green!
Big hit. Also used and shaved home grown garlic  and herbs.
Delish. This is a versatile sauce and cans can be made for various proteins!
Thanks

I've made this many times, usually as noted in the recipe. The only changes I make that I think add more flavor are to season the chicken before cooking (I use Montreal Seasoning). It's a little bland if you season it at the end. I've also tried it with green olives and they are just as tasty. It tastes like a gourmet meal without the effort. Great recipe. Thank you!

This was a really great low carb, healthy, easy meal. I made it just as is except I had to add a lot more liquid because it got dry in the pan. I used cherry tomatoes cut in half, which aren’t as juicy, could be why. Great flavor with the tomatoes and Kalamata olives. Even my meat-hating kids ate it. 2 thumbs up!

I made this last night and suggest a few tweaks.  First, there is no need to put 2 Tbl. of wine with the olive oil.  In my case it started spattering everywhere!  Just add the wine into the sauce.
Secondly, I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I believe either would be good, but it's an option.
Third, I added tomato paste to the onion/tomato mixture.  It added a depth of flavor that I believe is often needed with fresh tomatoes.  All that being said, it was easy to make and very tasty.  I will make it again.

My 3 year old daughter loved this, it is going in the rotation!  My changes 1) Added mushrooms and feta at the end. 2) Doubled the sauce. 3) sliced my chicken into strips 4) used 5 cups canned tomatoes 5) increased onion to 1 c 6) increased garlic to 5 cloves 7) Instead of parsley I used italian seasoning. 8) let simmer for only 5 minutes.  I thought 10 minutes was too long.

This was a pretty easy recipe but I guess our family just does not care for a Mediterranean flavor.  We love all the ingredients individually so I thought we'd like it but husband said not to make again.  First recipe we've tried here that didn't make the cut but that's just because of our own personal taste.

This is a great recipe and it scaled down nicely.  (I cook for one maybe two) The members that said the olives made the dish- oh boy that's accurate.  By changing from pitted kalamata to cured black Greek you get a whole new flavored dish. Instead of one or the other I'm going to combo the olives next time.  I also never use canned tomatoes unless I canned them myself.  You can use fresh tomatoes cup for cup without issues in this recipe.

This was delicious - a real keeper for week night dinners.  Next time, I would cut the meat into slight smaller pieces because the breasts were a bit larger for one portion but otherwise very tasty.

I love this recipe!  Try using either Fire roasted tomatoes OR Sun dried Tomatoes in olive oil and add feta cheese and artichoke hearts.  I also added bow tie pasta to mine.  Served with a salad, my family loved it.  It is a Keeper.

Huge sucess.  Better than I have ever had in an Italian restaurant.  Kalamata olives are definetly a must.  Chopping Chicken into small pieces is much better

This was one of those recipes where I almost had all of the ingredients necessary and it came out very nicely.  I had black olives (not kalamata), I had a can of diced tomatoes (not fresh), I had vermouth (not white wine).  A very flavorful dish and enjoyed by all.

This chicken dish turned out SUPER delicious! My house smelled like a restaurant while I was cooking...I paired this main dish with other recipes from this site: Spinach and Rice (Spanakorizo) and Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce and bought hummus...for the perfect mediteranean dinner... the family loved it! Thank you!

FANTASTIC!!! I didn't have white wine, so I used chicken broth mixed with a little white vinegar.

Excellent!!!  Like other reviewers, I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, pouring off some of the excess juice first.  I also topped the dish with some crumbled reduced-fat feta cheese before serving.  I served it with Near East garlic-flavored whole grain rice blend.  My husband, who has been requesting more "mediterranean" dishes (even though he isn't entirely sure what it means, just that it's healthy) loved it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. It seemed like it would be sort of bland or boring, but it was actually pretty darn good, a keeper even! I think the fresh ingredients definitely made it. I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I used a can of stewed tomatoes and diced about 4 fresh roma tomatoes as well. I also added about a tbsp of brown sugar to take the acidity away, and because I like marinara sauce a little sweet. Very yummy, fairly easy. It was a lot of veggies to chop, but I'd say it was worth it.

This is a great receipe.  It's a little heave on the thyme though and I suggest you cut it in half or so.  Other than that, great!

My husband and I both liked it. The next time I make it I will season the chicken so it’s more flavorful. I added more wine and ingredients to increase the amount of sauce based on the other reviews. I followed the recipe and used fresh tomatoes and it turned out great. Will definitely make this again.

We made this following the recipe.  The only difference was we used two breasts instead of six.  I would say that our two breasts would have been equivalent to 4-6 breasts.  We were extremely pleased with the dish.  The balance of flavors was excellent, no flavor overtook the dish and they all brought something to it.  We did use the fresh tomatoes and herbs.  When we make again we will precut the breasts into serving size (4oz each) and we will also salt and pepper the breasts and the tomatoes as we add them instead of at the end.  Also, we will make sure to serve with a nice crusty bread!

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever tried!  It was delicious, and smelled so good while cooking. It was simple yet so impressive. I plan to serve this to guests next week. I served mine over yellow rice.

I loved the flavors--I used organic chicken breasts, so chicken was already juicy and flavorful.  I would add more juices for more sauce next time.  I like to add some kalamata olive juice as well to give a little more "pizzaz."  My husband, who does not like chicken as a rule, liked it very much!

Really tasty. The whole family enjoyed it. What attracted me to the recipie was the fact thet the olives were only added at the end, allowing some olive flavour to come through, but not take overthe whole dish when you cook with the olives right from the start.

I tried this’s with lower expectations and was stunned by how tasty this meal was. I think it might be the best Greek chicken recipe I have tasted. I loved it. The only thing I did was add some feta and risotto on the side. Delicious!

Great dish even though I made several substitutions due to what I had on hand.... but I did have the basics of white wine, garlic, olive oil and onions.

My changes per other reviewers' recommendations were to not heat the wine with the olive oil initially (I find the oil tends to spit enough on its own) and using a can of diced tomatoes (no salt added).  I added a bit more wine while cooking to ensure the pan didn't get any dry spots but overall there was enough sauce for my chicken.  I made egg noodles to serve on the side and both my husband and I were happy with the outcome.  There is a lot of flavor to the dish; I was initially concerned that the tomatoes would dominate but the spices (I used dried thyme and basil and fresh parsley) balanced it well.  Next time I will go with a suggestion to add some feta cheese too!

I use this as a sauce over spaghetti squash for a lower carb option.  Didn’t change anything. But I can say that it works equally well with dried or fresh herbs (the fresh are better, but most won’t notice a difference).  Also, I did canned tomatoes to save a step and worked fine.  Have done this recipe three times now and it’s perfect every time.

We enjoyed this very much in conjunction with Chef John's Rice Pilaf from this site. It would have been five stars except that it needs more liquid to serve it over rice. We will make it again and adjust the recipe so it produces more sauce.

The only adjustment we made this time was to use four chicken breasts instead of six because the ones from Costco are huge. And because they are so thick my wife cut them into pieces. 

All-in-all a solid four-star recipe.

Delicious!  And healthy to boot!  The only things I changed were I used a can of low sodium diced tomatoes and added some feta.  I put in more olives, chopped, and my brother said that's what gave it the "zing".  I agree!  I served this over angel hair pasta and everyone raved.  Will definitely be making again!

So yummy & flavorful and doesn't take too long. Goes well with an Italian pasta or good quality focaccia or warm bread as there is a lot of sauce so you want to soak that up and eat it!

I've made it twice now, and loved it both times.  I've tried both fresh kalamata olives from the deli section of the supermarket, and with canned california black olives.  Both worked fine, but I preferred the fresh olives.  I substituted cilantro for parsley because I'm not fond of parsley.  That worked well, too.  I use the canned diced tomatoes with garlic and herbs (two cans).  Serve with a nice crusty Italian or French bread.  I paired this with a spinach and sundried tomato salad.  Very nice.  It's going into my permanent repertoire rotation.

Very good but omit thyme next time ; too strong a flavor.  also I added sun-dried tomatoes for extra flavor.  Used only 3 chicken breasts but kept other amounts the same (except tomatoes, used 14 oz. can)

I added feta which increased the calories by a little less than 40 and seasoned the chicken to my personal liking which added minimal if not 0 calories. I also coupled it with a basic leafy green salad and a raspberry vinaigrette. Tasty.

Very quick and easy recipe. We put it over parmesan cous-cous and that helped to absorb some of the excess liquid from the wine and tomatoes. I'd recommend this one.

Absolutely delicious. No complaints whatsoever. I did however add one can of diced tomatoes (drained) to my 3 cups chopped. Also added marinated artichoke hearts, and about 1/2 of juice from kalamata olives. I used 3 good sized chicken breast and sliced them to make 6 pieces. Seasoned chicken before cooking of course with greek seasoning. Will make again and again.

My husband and I loved this dish. I cooked it as is except that I cooked the chicken on medium-low once I returned it to the pan, and I let the olives and parsley cook a little longer too. I would probably add 2 chicken breast halves for a total of 8 next time - we seemed to need more with the amount of sauce we had. I served this with quinoa that I cooked in chicken broth. It worked perfectly since the sauce is runnier. The quinoa really picked up the juices. Super delicious - will definitely make this again.

Everyone loved it - 3 year old boy, 10 year old boy, 39 year old man! I used some thyme and basil but then used Clubhouse Greek seasoning for the rest of the seasoning. Also threw in some of the olive juice, and used a can of drained, diced tomatoes.

I made this exactly as listed and next time might cut the thyme by half. Just a personal thing. I did add some crushed red pepper to taste after being served to add a little heat. I will probably make again.

I prepared this for my husband and we both loved it. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh. Next time I think I'll add a little more garlic. I served it over brown rice. My husband ate leftovers the next day and he thought it was even better the next day.

This recipe is a good start; needs tweaking. Doubled the sauce and served with rice.  A bit runny, but not bad.  Used dried herbs, so kept those quantities as per the recipe.  The dried thyme was too strong, cut back next time.  Also added 1/2 t. of red pepper flakes; it was subtle.  The recipe was a bit acidic with the tomatoes and wine.  A bit of brown sugar might help.  Also, a bit of chicken bouillon might help too.

Loved it and my guests raved about it! I would recommend having all food items chopped and prepped efore starting thid as it has time sensitive preparation, i.e. when to add the tomatoes or how long to saute the garlic.

Excellent! Huge hit for last nights Sunday dinner! Only thing I did add was that I marinated the chicken breasts with lemon juice, olive oil, fresh parsley, salt and pepper. Pounded it out in put it in the fridge for about 4 hours. SO GOOD!!!

Made this to the recipe, and it was really great, served with a small side of quinoa. Next time, to make it AMAZING, I plan to follow some other suggestions... it needs more of the 'sauce', so I plan to add more tomatoes. I would also like more kalamatas, simply because I love those. Apparently people have larger pans than I do, because I could barely fit all the chicken in my skillet. I think I will use dried herbs next time, except for the parsley. I can never use fresh basil and thyme quick enough.

Overall this is relatively easy and good. We reduced the garlic and onion thinking we did not want to overpower the recipe. However, this left the dish a little flat.  Next time I will go with the original recipe  At the end, we left a little of the tomato juices in the skillet after removing the chicken and added a bunch of fresh spinach, covered and simmered the spinach down for a couple of minutes.  We put the spinach and tomato juices and feta over Jasmine rice. Also, we had large chicken breasts. I would recommend dicing the chicken  before returning to the simmer as shown in the picture. We ended up overlooking the chicken a bit to get the center of the thick breasts done.

Needs more flavor, made it a second time. This was very good. I cut the chicken up into bite-size pieces before cooking and added some artichoke hearts when I added the olives. I served it over whole wheat penne. It's a keeper.
Third time used 29 oz. can of tomatoes drained n Marsala wine, had no white. I just wish it made a thicker sauce.

Excellent dish! My family loved this. The only thing I think I might change next time is to sprinkle feta over the top when it's done. Will definitely make again.

Update: I used higher quality kalamata olives, doubled sauce, and sprinkled feta over the top, all of which greatly improved an already very good recipe.

I loved this recipe. Next time I might add some fresh spinach. I served it with penne pasta. It was great the next day, cold. I might make it as a cold pasta salad.

I linked this recipe to my Dinner Craft blog on FB on 4/8 and just got around to making it. I kinda futzed and eyeballed all the ingredients because I used only 2 chicken breasts and mixed in 3 cups of cooked rice when it was finished. This fed a family of four, and the husband had 3 servings. BIG meal time WIN. For full revamped recipe see FB blog. :)

This was awesome!  I did use canned diced tomatoes, but otherwise followed the directions from this original recipe.  I think the key os to cook the tomatoes down before adding the chicken in the end to cook the liquid out.  Served it with pine nut cous cous...

Frankly I had mixed feelings about this dish. My husband really liked it and thought there was a lot of flavor. I felt I had to make too many changes to give it 5 stars and if I could I would have gone 3 ½. I cut the pieces of chicken into bite sized pieces and grilled them in butter (yeah, I know) and the white wine. I also seasoned the chicken at this point which you really want to do or the flavor is a bit weak even with the sauce. I also used canned tomatoes in their juices as another reviewer recommended. It definitely needed the pepper flakes to give a bit of a kick too. Also, the sauce got too dry as it was simmering so I added more wine as needed. I cut the olives into little pieces too so it would mix well with the other flavors and so I wouldn’t get an entire olive in a bite. They really made the dish. But now that I had this chicken mixture how was I going to serve it? So I took a package of dried vermicelli and browned the noodles in butter. Then I added it to one can of chicken broth. By the time the noodles were done the broth was soaked into it was perfect. I served the chicken mixture over the chicken flavored noodles and it was delicious.

Fantastic recipe!  It's not often that I try recipes on here that I don't have complaints about, but this is certainly one.  Wonderful mediterranean flavors.  The olive are really what made the recipe.  Could still be made without them if you don't like olive but I couldn't go without them.  If your grocery store has the olive bar definitely get some good greek olives from there to throw in.

This does smell great, but it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  I think I'll try this again, though, and add the artichokes and feta...that should help a lot!

Overall a simple dish to put together and the kalamata olives are the stars of the show for sure! So, if you enjoy kalamata olives, you might enjoy this dish. However, I felt like I am eating olives with chicken instead of chicken with olives. Maybe this is what mediterranean dishes are like?

This recipe was okay.  I left out the olives and used canned chopped tomatoes.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it lacked any real flavor so once it was finished I had to stand and add a whole bunch more spices and I can't even remember now what I added.  I will make it again but will be prepared to add significantly more spices.

Made in the crockpot with frozen breasts on high for 4 hours. Doubled the sauce, using crushed tomatoes and ommitting fresh (will add fresh tomatoes and the extra 1/2 cup of white wine in the last 10 min. of cooking). Adding artichoke hearts in the last 10 min. too. top with blue or mozz. Thanks!

I gave this stars (to me that means, good) because this is a good basic recipe but you'll need to adjust your spices to avoid blandness. I used tofu which I drained, cubed sprinkled with salt and pepper and nicely browned in place of chicken with the olive oil ans wine. I added in chopped mushrooms with the onions, and I used one can diced tomatoes with juice and 3 small chopped roma tomatoes, and seasoned the whole simmering pan with about 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, as well as a sprinkling of oregano and Mrs. Dash. After adding the 1/4 c. white wine I let it simmer for more like, 15-20 minutes to let the liquid reduce, and also added some sugar and a bit of chicken broth to cut the acidity. Lastly, added chopped Greek olive medley and tofu, let cook for 5 minutes, and served over basmati rice with lots of feta cheese. Yummy!! :)

This was SO good!  Kudo's to the gal who came up with it.  I read all the comments before I made it and added the artichoke hearts and feta cheese at the end.  The funny thing is that my husband did my grocery shopping and got some extra cans of tomatoes with chiles.  I didn't notice when I put the dish together, but after a couple of bites I could feel some heat, but I knew I didn't add anything hot.  When I mentioned it to him he told me he bought 2 cans of regular diced tomatoes and 2 with chile's.  I looked in the trash to discover that I used one can of regular and one can with chile's....a mistake that turned out tasty!  My husband loved it and I WILL be making this again!

This was yummy!  I made as stated except for cutting the chicken into strips.  Next time I would double the sauce as others suggested.  I liked using fresh tomato, I would probably toss in the food processor next time though.  I can't imagine having it without some sort of pasta or rice.  I served over penne with fresh parmesan on top.

My fiance and I both really loved the taste of this recipe.  He's not a fan of olives so he picked them out of his but still thought the wine-tomato sauce was really flavorful even without the olives (I happily ate all his olives!).  My one complaint is that my chicken breasts had to cook in the sauce a long time to be fully cooked and in the process the sauce cooked off too much.  Next time I think I'll use four cups of diced tomatoes instead of just three, and I'll use thinner chicken breasts.  Also, I definitely recommend using canned tomatoes to get the extra juice.  I think fresh tomatoes wouldn't have worked as well.

I figured that with all the great reviews, this recipe was sure to be a hit.  I followed the recipe exactly and found the taste to be very boring and bland.  We have so much left over and I am struggling to finish it because I hate to throw out food.

This is a very delicious dish.  The only changes I made were to use a little more white wine and use a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I also added a drained can of white beans which helps to make it more hearty of a sauce.  I put all the ingredients into my crockpot and cooked on Low for about 6 hours.  It tastes devine and I am going to serve it over a whole grain rice blend and top with a little feta.  Thanks for the recipe!

My college aged stepson was diagnosed with Diabetes yesterday and this was my first attempt at an ADA approved recipe. It was good, not great. I discovered I love Calamata olives! Yum! (never had them before) But I thought they were a little overwhelming for this particular dish. Maybe half next time.

Very good.  Took longer to cook then I expected so plan for more time.  I will add feta cheese next to bring out more flavor.

I'm not a big fan of olives so I left these out.  Of course it seemed like there was something missing after I cooked the dish.  I imagine the olives is where a lot of the flavor comes from and if I had included them in the recipe I may have felt differently.  Next time I will try adding them.

I made this and changed it up a bit. It was amazing to quote my 15 yr old nephew. I put in 2 boullion cubes of chicken and added flour to the mix to make a gravy.

Had to use dried seasonings because that's what I had.  Next time, I would probably use oregano instead of thyme since I'm not big thyme fan.  Also used canned diced tomatoes since it's the winter...and hey, it's easier!  Also added some artichoke hearts.  Delish!  I'll be making again, I'm sure!

Excellent flavor!!! I used Madeira wine instead of white wine and topped with crumbled feta cheese... this dish came out just incredible! My husband raved about Mediterranean Chicken after having it at a local resturant. I will definitely be making it again in the future! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was really good, and like another reviewer said, ya gotta watch it when doing the 30 sec. garlic thing, and adding onion, it did want to get dry.  It turned out just delicious, but I forgot to drain one of the jars of diced tomatoes I had to use (no fresh on hand), and my husband felt that it could be spicier.  Very good with fresh parsley stirred in, we served with rosemary roasted potatoes.  Thank you for the recipe, we'll definitely make again.

This was excellent, even using mostly dried and canned stuff rather than fresh.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not hugely into Mediterranean flavors.

This dish was absolutely terrific. I used fresh roma tomatoes and tossed some fresh feta cheese over the top of it, which really added to the flavor. And the aroma was to die for - I highly recommend this!

UPDATE: I have been making this recipe for YEARS.  It's definitely one of our go to recipes.  Over the years, things I have changed - add a can of drained artichoke hearts, leave out olives, use a can of 28 oz tomatoes instead of the fresh.  I also usually throw in some Italian seasoning.  This is great served with rice or even just with some sautéed spinach!  Serve with some sliced lemons - the acid does it great justice.


This was SO good!  I paired it with the spinach and rice recipe from this site and it was a great, healthy supper.  The only thing I changed was to use a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (per other reviewers suggestions) and I left out the olives, since my husband doesn't like them.  Too bad, I love them.  Still great though!

This is a great recipe.  I usually increase the amount of sauce, use canned diced tomatoes and sub queen manzilla olives for the kalamata - it gives a nicer tang.

I loved this recipe!!  I used canned tomatoes and black olives and I added a little bit of crumbled fetta cheese in the last few minutes of cooking.  It came out sooooo good.  My picky 5 year old would not eat it, but you can't go by her.

I used halved plum tomatoes and red wine instead of white.  Served with red pepper pasta and a salad, this bowled over my weekly dinner-club crowd!

This was a GREAT recipe.  It took a little time chop up everything but we also used fresh herbs.  Eating it with a bite of the Kalamata olives made it even better.  I suggest everyone give this recipe a try.  We cannot wait to make it again!!

This was a great change from the usual chicken dishes I've made.  Left overs kept well and the dish was particularly good the next day as flavors had had a chance to meld.  I will make this again!

First Mediterranean dish I’ve ever made. I added some other vegetables and artichoke hearts along with olives,  to make it my own. Used chicken thighs, instead of breasts.  I loved it and my Lebanese roommate said he really liked it. Dying to make it again.

I loved this, I subbed capers instead of the olives, and used dried seasonings for those of which I didn't have fresh. I just added more wine as I felt it was thinning too much and served over rice, with crusty bread. It was really really good. A sprinkle of feta was also yummy.

I did not have white wine but substituted chicken broth. I used a large can of diced tomatoes and doubled the garlic. I also added Mediterranean style feta bites and spinach. This was a home run for myself and my kids.  Highly recommend!

I followed some other folks' modifications to double the sauce and add some other ingredients to make this snazzier.  Wife and kid loved it.  For me, I need to watch how long I cooked the chicken.  Chicken scares me, so I waited too long to check it for doneness.  It didn't take half as long as I thought it would just simmering.  Other than that, awesome!

Husband loved it!  I did put in a cup of onion instead of 1/2 c., and also added a jar of marinated artichoke hearts along with the can of diced tomatoes (the kind in Italian seasonings).  I also added 1 T. Italian seasoning with the other herbs.  Also used closer to 1 c. of the wine.  I had problems with the chicken (boneless, 
skinless thighs) getting browned, what with the wine being in the pan with the oil, so I heated up another fry pan with some olive oil and browned it up in that.  While that was browning I worked on the sauce.  When the chicken was done in that pan, I fried up some zucchini,  onions  and mushrooms with some more Italian seasoning in what was left from browning the chicken.  It all came out great.  I served the chicken over basmati rice,  and sprinkled with feta.  Awesome!

Used canned diced tomatoes, italian seasoning for herbs and black olives and artichokes as the kids don't like stronger olives. Also put in 9 oz. package of refrigerated cheese tortellini. Honestly, I think I'll keep the sauce, it's pretty foolproof, but the tortellini was way better in this than the chicken and easier. Thanks for a great base recipe!

I made this recipe for myself while my husband was out of town.  I liked it so much I made it again when he got home.  He loved it and gave it two thumbs up.  I did not add the olives, since I don't care for them.  I used frozen blanched tomatoes from my freezer as well as a cup of homemade tomato sauce.  The extra sauce I spooned over the accompanying veggies.  I gave this recipe to two friends without them asking for it, I liked it that much!  Oh, I also added feta cheese just before serving.

After seeing other reviews, I doubled the amount of sauce, used chopped canned tomatoes with juice instead of fresh, and added one 14 oz can artichoke hearts. Served with brown rice/mushroom pilaf, then tried leftovers with plain white jasmine rice. Loved it with either! Sauce is great over the rice.

I lòved this recipe. So did my guests and family. I actually made a mistake and put all the wine in the pan at the beginning. The difference it made was that it was hard to brown the chicken. Added more wine later and the results were fabulous.

I have to agree with several other reviewers who said it was pretty boring.  I ended up adding fresh chopped cilantro and creaole seasoning to the already cooked mixture.  I also made it ahead, put it into a greased casserole dish and baked it in the oven (time saver), topping it with cheese about the last 15 minutes of heating.  It's a pretty healthy dish....just a little boring without adding more to the recipe.

Couple of comments, 6 chicken breast halves, was it supposed to be half of a chickens breast or one half of a Chickens breast, because 6 Chicken breast halves are larger than my largest skillet, also 3 cups tomatoes chopped, was that fresh tomatoes, or canned tomatoes, because fresh tomatoes are not as juicy and they don't sell chopped canned tomatoes, even though I used fresh tomatoes, but had to cut each chicken breast in half, so only actually used 3 Chicken breasts.

I have made this numerous times and we love it. I do however bake mine in a 9x12" pan once I've assembled it..350 for 1 hour. We shred any leftover chicken and combine all remaining ingredients with brown rice for a delicious second meal.

Made the recipe as it was stated. Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of chopping fresh ones to get 3 cups of tomatoes. Served over 2/3 cup of white rice that we mixed in before serving and it was delicious. Adding this to our nightly mix of recipes.

I made this chicken recipe since my family loves chicken. The basil and thyme gave it a great flavor with white wine.

On the up side, the chicken was juicy and there was quite a bit of sauce.  On the down side, I found the thyme to be a bit strong and the basil taste non-existent.  The next time, I will substitute oregano for the thyme and increase the basil.  It's such an easy dish to prepare that I think it's just a matter of tweaking it a bit for my taste.  It's well worth the effort for this good 1-pan chicken dish.

It was very good indeed.  I only made a minor change and added a tablespoon of paprika, personal choice.  Be careful not to overcook the sauce.

Easy to make. I used grape and cherry tomatoes. They worked great. Very tasty sauce. I am going to try and season the chicken a little before cooking.  Everything tasted even better 2 days later for leftovers. Yummy!

This was an easy, and refreshing dish. As others suggested I used canned diced tomatoes and doubled the sauce recipe. Very Tasty! I served over cheese tortellini with sautéed zucchini, summer squash and onions served on the side. The whole family liked it, but thought as one reviewer suggested, that next time I should add some red chili flakes for a little zip.

This was simply excellent....will definitely make again.  IMHO the chicken needs to be browned well and be sure to include the wine in the EVOO when browning.  I seasoned the chicken with a little salt, pepper and poultry seasoning prior to browning.

This was a satisfying meal and an easy one, but I upped the amount of herbs to add some flavor to it which I thought it a bit lacking in.  My husband really liked it though, so I will probably make it again.

This dish is delicious. I made it as written and it was perfect, but I needed to make it a complete meal. Therefore I tripled the sauce, added some freshly cut French green beans. I then added 16 ounces of linguine and topped it off with a 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. I agree that the olives are a must for this recipe. I did not triple the olives as I was skeptical of it over powering the meal. I doubled them.

Great recipe, I used canned Plum Tomatoes; Italian Spice mixture from spice rack and did not put in the olives as my husband won't eat them.  It was great.

Sauteing the chicken in wine and oil is not a great idea to much grease spattering, next time just the oil.

Made this dish for 2 but still made full recipe of sauce as we had it with linguini. Added fresh parmesan on top and side of sauted zucchini and it was a very good meal.

I used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3. I doubled the fresh basil. I used half the amount of chicken called for in the recipe, which left me with plenty of sauce, and I sprinkled grated Romano over it. Delicious! Tonight I'm going to place the chicken and sauce over a bed of Angel Hair pasta.

Made this for the first time and it was well received. The next time that I make it I am likely to make a few additions.
I am thinking that some capers, celery, sausage and serving it with some orzo pasta will enhance this recipe nicely. Not sure what it will do to the calories but I think it will be nice compliments to the original recipe

Good recipe. As suggested  by others, I topped it with feta cheese.    I also added garbanzo beans, just because I had them in the pantry!

Loved this!  Very easy.  Only change I made was I cubed the chicken and had to sub green olives as I didn't have kalmatas.  Also added a tablespoon or so of the olive juice to the wine and oil to fry the chicken in.  Really nice!  Will make again.

I made this as the recipe lists except for subbing cooking sherry for the white wine, as I did not have any. I also put the chicken back in the pan as the tomatoes and herbs simmered. It took about 25 minutes after browning to get the breasts cooked theough. This was a tasty recipe, and my husband and I enjoyed it.  I made a brown rice/quinoa mixture, and we used the sauce in that as well.  Good recipe.

It needs a little more sauce and I left out the olives as I don't like them. Otherwise a very nice meal.

This was very good, similar to a recipe I've made in the past. It has ingredients that are usually to hand. Adding mushrooms would make it better.

This was very good. I left out the olives only because my husband does not like olives but even with out them I felt it was great. Quick, easy and delicious. I used 3 heirloom tomatoes from our garden giving this dish a great flavor profile. Everything else I kept the same and served this with a parmesan risotto. Next time I would double the sauce or add a little more water to increase it.

We liked this a lot. I used bone-in chicken thighs, since that's what we generally have on hand, and a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping fresh ones. On the advice of other commenters I added some artichoke hearts when I added the olives, and set some feta crumbles out for those who wanted them. Oh, and I left out the white wine since I didn't have any. I served it with rice, though I'm quite sure it would work well with noodles.  Definitely one I'll make again.

Made the sauce as written but cooked it down a bit to make it thicker and only used 2 breasts....so it was 2 servings. My husband doesn't like olives so I just added olives to my serving. Omitted the parsley and topped with Parmesan cheese. Delicious and will make this again.

This was just another of those mediocre, easy to make dishes.   Throw the ingredients into the fry pan, serve it up, and forget it ever happened.  Suggestions: Don't spend three bucks on half a cup of kalamata olives - the name sounds exotic but use a 69 cent can of sliced black olives instead, with a teaspoon of olive oil and a dash of salt thrown in..  Truly a trashy recipe.  It just fills the gut, you know?

Delishious!  I had to use dried herbs and canned tomatoes (2-15 oz cans) bc that's what I had available, and the sauce needed to be thickened just a little.  I served it over white rice that I cooked in homemade vegetable stock.  Loved the flavor and will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

I threw everything in the crock pot on low for 6 hrs. It was easy and tasted great! I substituted canned diced tomatoes (2-28oz cans with basil)and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.I omitted the parsley as I was  out of it. Served it over near east garlic rice pilaf.

As other reviewers recommended, I doubled the sauce, chopped the chicken and used canned tomatoes. I also crumbled feta on top, which I definitely recommend.  Next time I make this I might chop up the olives so that there is more olive flavor throughout rather than bursts of olive every so often.

Second time I made it, because it's very tasty BUT,  6 breast halves is way too much.  I added canned artichokes to help balance the amount of  chicken . This time, I made it with two and I'm going to add the one I have left over from the first making. I'm, also, going to cut up the chicken this time.

Doubled the recipe and then used lots more olive oil, wine, garlic, thyme and basil. Used "Napa Valley Bistro - Pitted Kalamata Olives" which are marinated with Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon wine and Mediterranean herbs and an oaky Chardonnay. Absolutely delicious. This one is defiantly going in the "knock 'em out of the park" recipe box!!

I made this exactly as directed (as I say a lot in my reviews: you must follow the recipe exactly, at least the first time you try it), my package of chicken weighing just slightly over 2 pounds, which was just 4 good sized breasts.  (It is hard to tell what someone else thinks is the correct size chicken breast).  I thought it was very good and flavorful.  I forgot what one cook said about the spitting wine and I was covered in hot oil droplets, as was my stove top and counter!  I gave the whole dish to a friend who was ill, but still had a good sized taste myself.  I will make it again.  I'm thinking to sprinkle the top with some crumbled feta.

If I could I'd probably give the original recipe 3.5 stars, but I was able to come up with some changes the next day that made it 5 stars to me! I was really in the mood for some Mediterranean food and tried this recipe, and while it wasn't bad, it was really rather bland. Even my husband who will normally eat a ton at dinner even if he doesn't love something, only ate the bare minimum. The result was having a ton of left-over the next day that nobody wanted. So, I chopped the chicken up into smaller bites and stuffed the leftovers into blanched bell pepper halves. Sprinkled the tops heavily with McCormicks Greek Seasoning and a LOT more kalmatas and then poured a can of tomato sauce over the top of them and sprinkled with a little Italian Cheese blend. Baked in the over at 350 for about 25 minutes. It made a wonderful stuffed pepper and had a lot more of the Mediterranean flavor I was wanting. I now use this recipe as the base and go right to the stuffed peppers. I do think you could probably just add the Greek Seasoning, more kalmata's and a bit more tomato sauce and you'd improve the flavor without the peppers if you wanted.

I read many of the reviews and did add more liquid. Also added sliced zucchinis, chopped artichokes, Middle Eastern green olives, slices of lemon, sliced yellow and orange peppers. It is delicious and should be the crowd pleaser. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful taste.  Used apple juice instead of wine and it tasted great.  Recipe calls for chicken filets, but I cut chicken into chunks like shown in the picture and this worked well.

Made this last night almost exactly to spec, with only minor changes: I used canned, diced tomatoes since I was short on time, and had to use dry basil since I forgot fresh basil at the store (it was fine).  Once it cooked, I cut up the chicken into bite sizes, and served it onto a salad made with romaine lettuce leaves, a raspberry vinaigrette, cucumbers, more olives, and feta cheese.  I definitely want to include artichoke hearts with the chicken next time, but it was still delicious.

Picky husband who hates olives LOVES this dish. (Of course, he picks the olives out, but I cook them a bit longer than the recipe calls for so he still gets that briney salt flavor). We shredded the chicken and added crumbled feta on top, then served over rigatoni. Delicious, and will make again!

way too much meat.  no salt, no pepper
tasted poached. Could have been fried a pretty brown.  No sauce/moisture
I had to keep adding things just to give it flavor, added a jar of marinated artichokes and topped w feta cheese at the end.
I would not repeat this recipe again

This was good!  Not my favorite way to eat chicken, but it was nice for a change.  I would probably try it again with regular black olives rather than kalamata olives....they were a bit too strong for us.  I served it over basmati rice.

Phenomenal!  I only had 4 chicken breasts, so I added a can of garbanzo beans.  It was unbelievably delicious.  You could easily make this dish vegetarian by leaving out the chicken and just using the garbanzo beans...so so good.

So good!  I subbed green olives since I don't have kalamata, and subbed dried herbs for fresh--they just don't hold up well during cooking like this.  I used already cooked and frozen chicken breasts so I added the chicken with the wine instead.  Very nice dish, perfect with broccoli and saffron rice.  Thanks for the recipe!

This chicken dish is really good.  I make it according to the recipe except I don't like thyme and parsley so I leave those out.  I serve it with mashed potatoes and it's delicious every time.

This is an easy dish to prepare but disappointing.  I thought it lacked flavor and there wasn't anything that made it stand out.  Needs more flavor.  Maybe will add the red pepper next time.

Great simple dish.  Followed pretty much exactly. Used fresh cherry tomatos (cut in half).  As others reviewed.  1 - do not cook tomatos for 10 minutes, 2 - added crumbled feta at the end 3 - served with orzo.

Pretty good.

Preparation time is longer than the 20 minutes stated. Tomatoes should not be cooked the 10 minutes... they get annihilated.

I stuck pretty close to the recipe, just added capers, green olives, and a small amount of orzo.

I followed the recipe and it was perfect. My boyfriend loved it so much he asked if we could keep it in "the rotation" of weekly dinners.  I did top it with feta and add more olives per other reviews. It was delicious.

I followed the recipe precisely, however I was disappointed. I expected something more spicy and flavorful instead it came across as mild and bland. It has potential but I feel something was missing.

I really liked this recipe as did my family.  I also "cubed" the chicken and used canned diced tomatoes.  Served it over angel hair pasta. The only thing I would change next time is to add a few more kalmata olives.  They really make it special.  Thanks for the great recipe=!!!

This recipe just didn't do it for me. I used dried basil and thyme, and canned diced tomatoes. Maybe there's too much wine or thyme or something, but I just didn't go for the final taste. Tried it the next day, to see if the the flavors melded and tasted better, but I still didn't enjoy very much.

Made this last night.  Really liked it!  
Made a couple of changes, and found a few things I will add next time.
Added about a cup of chicken stock.  I served it over Cous Cous, and sprinkled it with crumbled low fat feta cheese.
Next time I will add mint, as well as the other fresh herbs, and maybe capers.

Very delicious and I love that it is low fat. The recipe did not say if the tomatoes were to be fresh or canned so I used canned. I used less chicken than called for and diced it into the sauce. I didn't have Kalamata olives so used black. Very good over whole wheat spaghetti.

This sounded good, so I tried it. It was bland and almost inedible. The basil was overwhelming, and none of the other flavors came through. I added salt and pepper at the table, but that didn't help much. Don't waste your time and ingredients on this one.

I didnt have the olives, and I used a can of garlic and onion diced tomatoes, I used dried herbs, and I thought this was very good.  Could have used a bit more sauce after I combined it with the pasta, which wasnt really all that much pasta.  Very good recipe.  Thank you for sharing

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this.  Next time I will cube the chicken and add feta cheese.  The sauce was tasty but the chicken was bland.

I took a bunch of shortcuts (dried thyme and basil, canned tomatoes), and felt the result was a little bland.  My wife loved it.  I will try it again soon with fresh ingredients!

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!! My husband loved it and so did I! I cut the breasts in strips. The sauce is wonderful but the breasts are a bit dry/hard meat for me. I will use thighs next time with this yummy sauce!!

Thanks for another heart healthy recipe Robin!  I did use one can of unsalted petite cut tomatoes and about 1/2 C chopped fresh tomatoes.  I added the can early in the recipe and the fresh about 5 minutes before being done so they remained whole.  Add a few red pepper flakes and you will feel no need for salt!  I put this over organic whole wheat pasta - yum!

This was a very good recipe.  I substituted dried basil for fresh, as I didn't have any fresh on hand. I used about half to three quarters of the chicken called for, as another reviewer had said there was not enough sauce.  I think using less chicken and keeping constant the amounts of the other ingredients yielded a very good amount of sauce. (of course, you could keep the amount of chicken the same, and increase the amounts of the other ingredients.) After the initial sautéing of the chicken, I cut it into cubes before adding it back in later during the preparation of the dish.  I think cubing the chicken produced a lovely looking and tasting dish.

I agree with others the tomatoes fall apart and should be the last thing added.  This was super tasty and combined all my favorite foods.  I tripled the olives along with doubling the seasoning-but that's personal preference.

This was really, really good! I made  few minor changes. I threw in a couple shakes of red pepper flakes, cut the chicken up into bite size pieces and tossed with a bit of flour before cooking. I added a couple extra cloves of garlic, and about 1 cup of chicken broth to make more of a sauce to go with the jasmine rice we made. I cut way back on the olives, to about 1/4 cup and diced them up, 1/4 cup is plenty if you don't like too much of a taste of olive. This way it gives just a hint of that kalamata flavor. I also added 1 diced green pepper to the dish right after I added the onions. This was an excellent dinner and I will be making this one again for sure. Very colorful dish, too!

Much like everyone else, I also had DRIED spices and canned tomatoes.  Omitted the oil and olives (to keep it VERY low fat).  And instead of individual spices, I just used Penzey's Pasta Sprinkle.  (Added crushed red pepper to my portion).  Quick & Easy.  Made a great low-fat, low-cal, yet flavorful lunch!

This was just okay. At the last minute, I realized my kalamata olives were moldy (how that happened, I don't know!), so I didn't use any. I also used canned tomato instead of fresh. Even with the substitutions/omissions, I can't imagine this recipe being spectacular. I cut the chicken breasts into thick strips so they'd absorb more flavor and cook quicker. Something new to try, but I probably won't make it again.

This recipe is a 4 as is.  At least for my taste.  After several attempts and changes I prefer to add canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  Be sure to not drain the tomatoes.  Too little sauce for me.  I also like to double the herbs, add capers, and a few more olives.  It's also a great soup base for a cold day.  Double the wine, add cooked barley or rice to taste.  The alcohol cooks off anyway.  Hope you like! My tastebuds do!

This is a delicious dish!  I added mushrooms and also used the white wine that the recipe calls for.  I couldn't rate if it was kid friendly as I don't have kids and you probably wouldn't use the wine if it was being served to them. I felt like I was dining in Spain when I ate this dish!!! Wonderful!!!!

Great taste. If you are not going to use wine remember to boost the flavor some other way! I forgot to and although it was good, the addition of broth or stock would make a big difference.

Almost tastes like the chicken my aunt in Spain makes!
