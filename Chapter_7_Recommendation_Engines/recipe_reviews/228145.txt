My son and I tried this and thought it was amazing. Instead of pizza sauce I used refried beans and sour cream with taco meat and a mix of cheese. I used taco mix of cheese. I topped it with lettuce and sour cream. My son also put salsa on his. He loved it!! It also tasted great reheated.

This was a good pizza but it could use some sort of sauce.
