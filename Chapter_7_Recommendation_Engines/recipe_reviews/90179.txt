I made this recipe last weekend and it was very good. I had to use a lot more chicken stock that it called for though. It simmered down to very little liquid - perhaps simmer on lower heat? I ended up using one and half cup and still felt like it could have used a bit more sauce. It was very tasty though and I suspect I will make this again. My boyfriend loved it.

This recipe is outstanding!  I loved it.  I made it with stone ground spagetti noodles to give it a nutty flavor.  Fabulous!!!

The flavors in this are really good - but more time consuming than it needs to be and the sauce is way too thick. Next time I won't flour the chicken, I don't think it adds anything and tends to dry it. I used red onion instead of shallot and bacon instead of pancetta. Garnished with sundried tomato (since we have one in the family that hates it), parsley, and red onion. Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely wonderful. I used prosciutto instead of pancetta because I read the recipe incorrectly, but it came out great. I agree that if you are eating this over a large amount of pasta, you need more sauce, but if you're just eating it with a single serving of pasta (ie, a normal person size serving instead of an insane restaurant size serving) you'll be fine. I recommend cutting up the sun-dried tomatoes -- mine were rather tough, though they did make it look very pretty. If you want to cut down on the fat content, don't saute the chicken, just poach or bake it, then cut it up. You won't miss out on any flavor because the sauce is so rich anyway.

Like others have said, double everything that goes in the sauce. It's so delicious we'll probably just make the sauce again for pasta.  Great recipe!

Very good recipe.  I agree with other reviews to double the sauce.  I used half-and-half to cut down on the richness a bit.  I also suggest seasoning the flour with seasoned salt.  It was still a heavy meal, but with fantastic flavor!    It didn't take 45 minutes of prep; more like 30.

This was DELICIOUS.  I did, however, make a few changes.  Instead of frying the chicken breast cutlets, I browned them in oil while sauteing some onions, garlic and turkey bacon (I didn't have pancetta) with them.  I omitted the sun-dried tomatoes all together, mainly because I didn't have them in my pantry.  After browning for 5-10 minutes, I added the sherry and let it simmer to reduce.  When the sherry had reduced about halfway, I added the chicken stock and let that reduce.  By this time the chicken was cooked all the way through, so I removed it to add the egg, skim milk (also didn't have heavy cream), and brie cheese.  I added more brie than the recipe calls for because I LOVE brie.  I used a little bit of whole wheat flour to thicken up the sauce, and then returned the chicken to the pan to coat.  I served it over a bulgar "risotto," seasoned with butter, parsley, and pepper.  My roommate and I ate every bite!!!

Very good dish!  I replaced the pancetta bacon with crumbled bacon from Costco.  I would suggest to cut down on the amount of garlic; keep in mind, this suggestion comes from a garlic lover.  I added a tiny bit more of sherry wine for maximum effect!  I served this dish as is without adding it on top of rice or pasta.  Other than that, the recipe is a hit.

My entire family liked this -- but made these changes:  Used 1/2 sm can of drained tomatoes instead of dried.  Ommitted egg yolk.  Added Penzey's Northwoods seasoning & capers.  Flavor was delicious!  Seraved over thin whole wheat spaghetti.  yum.

I liked this a lot. I doubled the amount of sauce and we had plent of it. I also used regular bacon rather than panchetta for more flavor. I'll make this again soon!

This dish was ok. A little too rich for me. My son (who is almost 17) wasn't terribly impressed with it, he said, "it's ok" I served it over a multigrain pasta, and I think I would have prefered a regular angel hair, but that was my error. I think I would replace the cooking sherry I used with a better sherry, also.

Delicious!  My husband loved the sauce and wants me to put it over buttered noodles next time. Caution!  This is not a low-fat recipe but you could cut down on some of the fat by using less olive oil to brown the chicken.  (Big help, I know!)

This was pretty good, but I think I was expecting more out of it.  The flour definately needs to be seasoned, the chicken was pretty bland the way this is written.  I increased the sauce based on other reviews so that we could eat it over pasta.  I also used regular bacon instead of the pancetta, and added some sliced mushrooms.  I gave the sundried tomatoes a spin in the food processor before adding them so they weren't as chunky.  Thanks for the recipe!

Husband's verdict: 'Tasty, but the little dried tomato things are a bit weird'! This was almost a complete disaster - I used Japanese cooking sherry for the first time ever, and had no idea it was SO salty (worse than sea water!). I ended up having to dilute and simmer the sauce with a ton of milk. The brie didn't help matters much either. Still, I managed to salvage it, and Husband didn't go hungry. Thanks!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled sauce, added more booze and chicken stock.  I also ended up adding more brie, pancetta and some crushed red pepper flakes, simply as a preference.  Raves from family, thus the five-star review.  I would, personally, give it a four-and-a-half.  It was more work than I like for a week-night dinner, but I do love it when the family can't seem to stop coming back for more!  Thank you for the fantastic recipe, Chip69 and to your Veronica for the inspiration.

Loved it, very easy to make and delicious. I used mushrooms and peppers instead of meat, it was very rich and filling.
