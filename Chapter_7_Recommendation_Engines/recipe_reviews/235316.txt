Delicious!  I opted to roast a whole head of garlic and just add it to the quinoa/ chicken broth mixture instead of sauteing the garlic.  The whole family loved it!

My whole family loved this side dish.  We had it with salmon and asparagus.  I made it somewhat like risotto.  Like some other reviewers, I used a spoonful of minced garlic from a jar, and added chopped onion.  After 20 mins of simmering, I added a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach and 3-4 tablespoons of shredded Parmesan, then tossed it all together until the spinach softened and the cheese melted.

Made this for lunch, but cut it back to 2 servings. My first time having  quinoa, i used lactose free margarine and my own chicken broth. I added peas for color. I Really liked it, my husband not so much. Guess it's not for everyone. Even though i found it took 5 minutes more to cook i gave it 5 stars cause its easy and tasty. Thank you for this recipe, i will be making it again.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  My husband does not like to try new things, but when I saw this recipe had garlic, I thought maybe there was a chance he'd try it.  He took three helpings!!  I used minced garlic from a jar, and it was VERY garlicy (just the way I like it) but I can see that it may be too much for garlic "likers", not "lovers".  I used the mixed Quinoa which gave it some added colour.

Instead of butter, I use olive oil to saute the garlic.  Also added some diced onion and saute with the garlic.

I made quinoa for the first time and I love garlic so I used this recipe. I also added a little chopped onion, yellow squash and a can of drained chunk chicken for protein. I was on my lunch break when I cooked it! Super easy and delicious.

This was my first attempt at quinoa...it was so yummy! I had about a quarter cup of diced onions from a different recipe and so I sauteed that with the garlic. I used vegetarian, better than chicken base instead of broth. The quinoa came out delicious all by itself but once completed I tossed in a big handful of baby spinach, a handful of sliced grape tomatoes, half a cup of chick peas, and a quarter cup of crisp corn. I tossed that together and put the lid back on for less than 5 minutes so the spinach wilted then put a crumble of goat cheese on each serving with a drizzle of olive oil. So filling and SO delicious! Quinoa will now be in my regular food rotation.

Generally, everyone enjoyed in my family. The biggest advantage is that it takes hardly any time to put it together. I added onion. It was quite salty so definitely would use low-sodium broth next time.

Loved the garlic taste.  If you are not a garlic person, may want to use a little less.

This was better than the boxed quinoa that I've had previously. I did think that it could use a little more flavor and next time will add some different seasoning. A great base recipe for people who don't know how to make quinoa!

I made this according to the recipe and I like it a lot but it seemed to be missing something. I added a little low-sodium soy sauce.  Next time I think I'll use vegetable broth and saut√© some onion with the garlic. It was super quick and easy!

An all time favorite since I discovered it earlier in the year. Quick 'go to' side dish that doesn't cease to disappoint! Great for after work. My chicken broth isn't salty enough on its own, so I add a dash of salt. Can always add extra garlic, as the garlic taste is subtle to me when made according to the recipe.

I have made quinoa before and had disastrous results, but this recipe was amazing!  The only change I made was about a quarter of an onion finely diced and cooked with the garlic.  My husband loved it!  (Just a suggestion, but try making it with Gorgonzola balsamic portobello mushrooms as the main course!  They are delicious together!)

This is my second time trying quinoa.  First time was awful, but I decided to give it another shot with this recipe, definitely the right choice.  My husband and I couldn't get enough of this!  Can't wait to have it again!  I do agree with another reviewer that it took an extra 5 minutes to cook.

I thought this was just a little heavy in the chicken broth so next time I will reduce the amount. It reminded me of the pre-packaged rice mixes and I never use the entire spice pack with them because I feel like that is all you taste. Other than that this was a good, quick side dish.

Delicious. Just the right amount of garlic flavor. Brown color okay. I would pair it with colorful vegetables, like greens and reds.

Replaced this for rice as a side dish. Enjoyed the change with this flavorful quinoa. I used chicken bone broth for added protein. Will make again.

I used homemade chicken broth, this was fantastic! It even got complements from people who didn‚Äôt know I made it at a shared meal. I may have used a little extra garlic and butter because I didn‚Äôt measure.

No changes here. This is my third attempt at quinoa. This is very bland. In fact, maybe a little short of bland.  It appears that my wife and I have no interest in quinoa.  Nothing seems to make it interesting. To this recipe (serving), I added one tablespoon of 
butter and a pinch of additional salt. That allowed me to eat most of one serving. We threw the rest out and will not make it again. Sorry. It probably isn't you; it's the quinoa.

I subbed in olive oil, instead of butter. I did thus because I have high cholesterol. Tasted wonderful. Zucchini in under rated.

I wanted to make this as a substitution for rice! Loved it! Only thing was I used low sodium chicken broth and realized that if I use it I need to add some kind of salty element. Otherwise delicious!

Needs some help. I wasn't a fan. I added onion as suggested by another reviewer and threw in carrots I had cooked in chicken broth. But it was still kind of bland.

I added 1 tsp of salt and substituted vegetable broth instead to make a Vegan version. It was absolutely delicious!

I made this just following the recipe.  Tasty side dish that could easily be modified by addition of various spices blends to provide any ethnic twist.  Recipe so simple to follow, my 11 year old granddaughter was in charge of cooking the dish while her mother & I managed the remaining meal.

How easy can it get? I just added vegetable broth and some extra garlic.  With five minutes to go, I added some diced sugar snap peas from the farmer's market to add a veggie crunch.

Made exactly as written,  using red quinoa.  I've been trying to introduce more whole grains, and this seemed like a basic way to prepare quinoa without getting terribly adventurous--which we are not!  Hubby thought it was a little bland, but the kids and I liked it a lot.  A very nice flavor to accompany any number of entrees.  Could easily be jazzed up with some greens or veggies.  I think next time I will use beef broth instead of chicken, just to see how it changes the flavor.

I made it as written, and felt it was kind of bitter with just the garlic.  My whole family prefers just plain quinoa with butter.

This was my first time making quinoa for my family and they loved it. This will definitely become a staple side dish in our house.
