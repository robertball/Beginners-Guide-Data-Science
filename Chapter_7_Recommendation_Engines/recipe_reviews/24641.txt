This recipe was very easy to make. Living in the Chesapeake region I had to add Old Bay seasoning to it and it was great. I served it at a Christmas party for 32 people and everyone enjoyed it.

Fast and easy for sure, but taste wise it was just ok. I won't make it again.

I wish I had heeded the advice of the other reviewers who said this was not a good recipe.  It was very bland, and pretty much just tasted like cream cheese.  I do not recommend making this.

My husband and I upped this to 100 for our wedding reception - it was VERY well received.  The only thing we would like to add is that we included fresh minced garlic - it made it so much more tasty!

I love this recipe!! It is incredibly easy to make but has the taste like you slaved over it. Spread the dip on garlic cristinis and "poof", you got yourself a killer appetizer. Plus...you can add artichokes to this dip and you got a great combination of flavor.

As is, it's a 4, but it's a 5 if you add a little of each; old bay, worcestershire, lemon, sherry and cayenne pepper.

This is a great base recipe for cold Crab Dip. I occasionally sub fresh chopped garlic for horseradish and add a pinch of cayenne, paprika, and a little nutmeg (sounds weird but adds a little something to creamy rich sauces, dips).  Also if you want a little thinner consistency add a 1 cup of sour cream and some lemon juice.  Thanks Allison!

This was kind of bland and tasted mostly of cream cheese. The ingredients did not call for any seasoning but I added 1 T of Old Bay Seasoning and 1/2 t of garlic for some zing - and wow! what an improvement!

I made crab legs for the first time and I was not a fan so I looked up a recipe for crab dip and chose this one.  My husband loved it!  It was easy to use and gone in no time!  Thanks!

I make the same, except for those wanting more:  I didn't mix horseradish, but mixed everything else and put cocktail sauce on it.  Very Good!

I too added one clove of garlic, crushed. I would also suggest chilling this dish overnight because the flavors really do come out the longer it chills. 
I will definately make this dish again!

Horseradish over-powered the taste of the crab! I added fresh parsley and it made for a better presentation.

I make this dish often but I only gave it 4 stars because I modify it slightly by adding 1 Tsp Old Bay Seasoning to really give that crab tastse a kick.  Everyone loves this dip!!

Another quick and tastier version of this dip is to mix cream cheese and crab only.  Then form in a mound on a plate and smother the mound with cocktail sauce. Crackers are arranged around the dip mound. Now that is tasty!

PERFECT! Just the effect I was looking for. The "blandness" that other reviewers report allows the subtle, delectable flavor of the crab to shimmer through. Because I did not have green onions on-hand I substituted 2 tablespoons of finely chopped white onion, then added a teaspoon of chopped dried chives for color.

I made this for a New Years Eve party and served it up with homemade crustini. I also used fresh grated horseradish root and a few extra green onions.  Almost everyone at the party loved it, so much that I wasn't able to taste it.  About 2 days later, I decided to make it again.  I am so glad I did.  It is a great dip, very flavorful, just yummy!!

This is very easy to prepare.  I did add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice for more zing.  And yes I did make a full batch. Took it to a social hour at the RV park and everyone loved it.

I was disappointed.  Maybe my canned crab was bad.  The first day this tasted only like horseradish then the next day it had a weird tasted but it didn't ever taste like crab.  Will not make again.

I took this to a pool party.  Everyone loved it!  As other tips suggested I added about a teaspoon of old bay to it.  I served it with wheat thins.  Just a nice light cracker is all you need for this wonderful dip!  I will definately make it again and again!  :)

I cut this recipe in half and made it for a party.  It was quite bland and unappealing.  Harldy any of it was eaten.  I will not make this dip again.  It needs something to "kick it up a few notches!"

It was good, and my guests ate plenty of it, but it just lacked something.  I know that crab has a delicate flavor, so it's hard to add too much without covering up the flavor of the crab, but still.  I wish it packed a little more flavor.  Even though I enjoyed the taste, I probably won't make this again.

This was a really good base recipe. I did add spices to our taste. I was pleased to find this recipe because I didn't have sour cream on hand and it called for milk instead.

I just didn't like this for some reason. I added some extra ingredients to spice it up, maybe that ruined the recipe? I actually made this for my Christmas party and ended up not even serving it. Thanks anyway!

this was good. but i think u really need to put old bay in it. i forgot, and i thought it was kind of bland. i'm sure it would really bring out the flavor of the crab if u put it in.

This was delicious! I added a clove of garlic, but probably didn't need to because I served it with Garlic & Cheese Crostini. I do think more green onion would be good though, including the tops. I would have tried previous reviewers' suggestions of adding Old Bay, but I didn't have any. Next time I'll try that.

I tried this b/c so many of the others called for cocktail sauce which I did not have on hand.  For some reason I did not like this recipe.  Maybe the cocktail sauce is just the missing ingredient for me.

This dip was good.  Not super exciting, but I will make it again because of the nice light flavor.  I also added a dash of Old Bay as suggested by other readers and think it was a nice addition.

Well I made my crab dip and I did get some favorable comments on it.  However, I didn't get the response I usually get when I make something.  For instance "can I get that recipe".  That's why I didn't give this recipe a high rating. I did add cayenne pepper and seafood seasoning too it which added a little punch to it.   Crab is so mild in flavor so it's hard to give it a little kick without missing the taste of the crab.  May try recipe again.  Not sure.

A GREAT starter recipe!  If you aren't very confidant in the kitchen this is a really east recipe to get you going!  I added, like others did, garlic, artichokes, Louisiana hot sauce, and I doubled the horseradish, but I LOVE spicy!  I also added some white onion, and a healthy plop of cocktail sauce!  I think everything blends together really well, and it leaves just a bit of bite on your tongue!

This is a good dip, I wish I had some Old Bay seasoning like the others had suggested...it would probably add a nice kick, but it was still good by itself to serve.  I do like to follow the recipe exact the first time I try something as long as I have the ingredients then make modifications next time.  Thanks for sharing!!

I thought this was very bland the first time I tried it. So The next time I did 1 8oz pkg of softened cream cheese, 1/4 C sour cream, 1 C of finely chopped cucumber, 1 can crab meat, salt, pepper and onion powder to taste. YUM!

This recipe has potential-- but I made a few changes:
I purchased a 16 oz package of crabmeat.  I used 12 oz for the recipe and followed it as it was written.

Here's my addition:

I put the dip in the bottom of a shallow dish and topped it with a layer of seafood sauce and the remainder of the crabmeat.  Serve it with Townhouse Flatbread Crisps.  It was very tasty!

Taste like a ball of cream cheese and I put 16oz of crab meat. Don’t know if I will make again but if I do I will use only 1 8oz of cream cheese.

Changed up the recipe a little bit. Only used 1 package of cream cheese, and 1/2 the amount of horse radish- added a little mayo, salt, pepper, minced garlic, and old bay.

This is bland as others have stated. I used less cream cheese and added garlic, Worcestershire sauce, diced onion, diced red pepper and used wasabi as I did not have horseradish. I would only make this again if I had fresh crab.

We made this for our buffet table on Christmas Day and I made it exactly as written. (I used creamed horseradish instead of ground.) However, when I tasted it, I could barely detect the horseradish at all, and my husband couldn't either. We added more horseradish to taste and more milk to spread the horseradish more evenly. Then the dip was excellent and we devoured it! I will use this recipe again for sure and just remember to add my changes. The blended red and green from the crab and onion was quite festive, too!

I can't rate any stars on this it was really bland... The cocktail sauce helped a little but not much. Not a great recipe at all.
