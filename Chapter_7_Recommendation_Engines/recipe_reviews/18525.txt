I have to wonder about some recipes; if people really have tried them as stated, or if they tend to not work with a recipe at all, and they just sort of guess at the quantities in these recipes and write down anything if asked for a recipe.     
    Well, my experience with this grapeseed crust was less than stellar. Firstly, the grapeseed oil never froze to any degree of hardness at all.  I left it in my freezer for 24 hours too(my freezer does work).  It stayed a cold, thick liquid.  Ok, bad for a flakey pie crust. Secondly, 3/4 cup oil was way to much oil for the amount of dry ingredients.
