I just made this for the first time tonight.  My whole family (5 kids plus me) just loved it.  The fish sauce and lime add a wonderful piquancy.  It was a bit difficult to eat wrapped in the lettuce leaves, but we all agreed that the lettuce made it awesome!  I did need to add the 1/4 cup of water. I'd like it spicier for myself...but it was perfect for my kids.

These were a little bland.  The fish oil and red curry paste gave the pork an odd taste (and I usually like both in other dishes) and my husband and I felt it needed something besides the meat mixture and the lettuce.  Immediately after it was prepared it was edible for dinner but the leftovers were not.

This dish was okay, nothing special. It was kind of bland until I loaded it up with garlic and pepper.
