These beans are great!  I only used 1/4 cup each of brown sugar and ketchup, so there was no problem with it being "runny".  I also cooked 4 slices of bacon then chopped it and mixed it in.  That way I could use more bacon, but keep the grease out.

Jackie's description of her recipe is perfect: "A quick and easy way to dress up ordinary pork and beans. The measurements are estimates, but really you can adjust anything to personal taste."  I couldn't have said it better myself.  Other than reducing the brown sugar by half, I stuck to the recipe. As hubby said, "they were wonderful." And I say this was a big payoff for very little effort using ingredients right off the pantry shelf!

Will def make again BUT was mushy.... Too much liquid between the juice from the beans and ketchup!  I think I read a review that said they made twice - 2nd time draining the liquid from the beans 1st.  Plans to do that next time!   Overall delish!

At first I wasn't sure if this would be good because the ingredients seemed strange.  I threw all of it in the crockpot on low for 2 hours, and WOW!  It was sure yummy.  I would suggest having it with some BBQ chicken or something like that.  YUM YUM!!

I doubled recipe, but only used 1/2 of the sugar.  I used old style mustard instead of regular, 5 slices of bacon and baked them in the oven for about 3 hours.  They thickened up very nicely. Great beans.  Will make again & again

Wow! So easy and yet so good! This reminds me of the way my Grandma Helen used to make baked beans for every summer picnic.  Other than cutting back on the ketchup and adding a bit of molasses and liquid smoke I wouldn't change a thing. This definitely is a great way to take a regular 'ol can of baked beans and turn them into something special without a lot of effort!

I have always made my beans in a crock pot and cook them all day.  I made these last night and while I said they were pretty good, my husband said he thought they were the best beans he has ever had.  I used powdered mustard and added some arrowroot to thicken them a bit.  I had no choice but to write this when he said today, let's make these again tonight.  Looks like a winner, thanks Jackie.

Very Good!!  I think I will cut down on the brown sugar next time because it was a little too sweet for our taste.  I used Bush's beans and they are already sweet.  Also I crumbled cooked bacon in with the beans to cut down on the grease.

These are wonderful.  My first time making baked beans and I was very pleased.  I think it is important if you are going to rate a recipe you should make it as written.  If you go about making a lot of changes and then give it a bad rating, that is terribly misleading to the system.  Off my soap box!  The only place I deviated is rather than lay two slices of bacon on top, I chopped up the two slices and sprinkled them on top. This made it much easier to serve and the bacon was nice and just crispy.  The only change I think I might make next time is to drain one of the cans of beans.  Very very good and very easy. ***EDIT***  I made this for a second time, drained one can of beans and it was just a bit better!!  A++++

Took this to a brunch and really liked it.  I put in 1T of worcestershire instead (I think it brings out a smokey flavor)  Was very easy and yummy, thanks, Jackie.  
** Made this for a second time.  This time I double it and added pork saugage like some of the other recipes. YUMMY! It was a huge hit at the bar b que!**

Great recipe! I used Bush's Best Baked Beans so I knew that it would be even better when "doctored" with this recipe. I basically used this as a guideline since I was making such a large batch of baked beans. I tripled this recipe by using three (28 ounce) cans of beans. I used less brown sugar than called for and extra mustard, Worcesterchire and vinegar since we like things more savory than sweet. This was so yummy and thickened up beautifully. I will definitely make this tasty and easy recipe again for a BBQ!

I am not a big fan of baked beans, and these are wonderful! However, they are a bit sweet, so if you don't like sweet baked beans I would reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup.

This is great as it, but it needs one additional ingredient for perfection. I reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup molasses along with it. The molasses really contributes to the flavor!

These were very easy, I put them in the crockpot for a few hours.  They were a little runnier than I'm used to, but they were good.  Thanks Jackie-

I made this in a crock pot set on med heat for 4-5 hours.  Doubled the ingredients and it turned out great!  The only thing I didn't add was the red wine vinegar but it still tasted very good, more on the sweet side.  I used the original Bush's baked beans (with the can juices) and pretty much eyeballed the measurements with no worries.  I got a lot of compliments!  Served it with a ham for Christmas.  Very good and super easy to make!

These were some of the best baked beans I have ever had.  Instead of putting the 2 pieces of bacon on top, I fried about 6 slices and mixed the cooked bacon in with everything else.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used regular white vinegar and it still tasted great!  Definitely a keeper!

Easy to make.  Great for Memorial or July 4th picnics every year.  Doubling the recipe will fill a 9x13 pan nicely.

I didn't have time for this dish to cook for an hour, so I sauteed the bacon in a pan, then sauteed the onions in the grease.  Crumbled the bacon into a pan, poured in the onions (grease and all), stirred in all the rest of the ingredients, and microwaved on high for 15 minutes.  It was still SOOOOO good.  Thanks!

I doubled the recipe, but cut the brown sugar in half as others suggested.  Cooked in the crock pot for a couple of hours without the lid so it wouldn't be so watery. I took them to a party so the crock pot was nice to keep them warm and easy to seve from.  Everybody said they were great.

Delicious! Went well with the 4th of July menu.  Used vegtarian beans as I prefer to add my own meat.  Cooked the bacon in a skillet until almost done before chopping and adding to the bean mixture to bake.

Fantastic recipe!!!!  Tastes just like my Moms!  She could never give me the ingredient amounts, because she just put the ingredients in by nature.  The only thing in the ingredients that is different is the red wine vinegar, but I feel that it gives it a twist in taste, but not enough to say “what is that”, meaning it doesn’t overpower at all. Some of the reviews referenced a sweetness, which I didn't get.  Perhaps it is the brand of beans and ketchup used.  I used Van Camps beans, drained and Heinz ketchup. 
The only thing different that I did, was prepare it earlier in the day for a dinner we were going to that evening.  I set it in the fridge, uncooked.  An hour or so before leaving I put the dish into the cold oven, then turned on the heat to 350F.  I set my timer for 35 minutes, then punched up the temperature to 375F for 30 minutes.  It sizzled the bacon almost searing the top portion of the beans, sealing in the juices.  It was a dinner party of 5 … we served ribs,  mac/cheese, bread, roasted ears of corn, and deviled eggs ….   There was only a spoon or two left of the beans …. Everyone commented on them …. I just told them they were “mommas’ beans”, which is the finest recommendation I can give them …… THANK YOU!

Very good recipe.  I did chop up the bacon into bite-sized pieces before adding to the top of the beans before baking.  Helped them to get nice and crispy.

After reading all of the reviews I thought I would give this a try even though the ingredients semed pretty ordinary.  WOW - was I wrong !!!!  This recipe was outstanding !!!!  Next time I will add more bacon only because my husband loves it but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing ( he doesn't like sweet things so I also decreased the sugar to 1/4 of a cup but I myself would like it with more )  Thanks so much for a real winner - I won't bother looking for "the" baked beab recipe because this is it !!!!!!

My Mom makes the best baked beans ever. But they have to soak overnight, and require several hours of baking in the oven. I just don't have time. Thought this recipe had similar ingredients to hers without the time investment. I was NOT disappointed. This recipe was AWESOME. My mom used molasses, so I did use another reviewers comment and reduce the brown sugar and add some molasses. I also swapped the ketchup for chili sauce. These were absolutely delicious. My Mom even asked for the recipe! Served it with a homemade mac n cheese and a spinach salad with asiago cheese, pine nuts and mushrooms. Was the best "comfort meal" I have ever made (if I do say so myself!). Mom, Dad, hubby and son agreed. Thank you!

This is my mom's recipe that she did from her head, only difference she used ground mustard, love it with the ground vs. the regular mustard.  Absolutely the best.

I really liked this recipe for baked beans. It is simple to put together and the flavor is very rich. I put all the ingredients in my slow cooker on low for about 5-6 hours. This made the flavors really blend to give it the rich taste. Delicious. good recipe thanks.

THE BEST baked beans!  I have used this recipe for several years and always get compliments on it.  Don't change a thing - it's perfect as is.  I microwave mine for about 15 minutes instead of baking and it comes out perfect.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!  :o)

I tripled this recipe for a large family gathering, and all I brought home was an empty dish.  Everyone loved them.  They had just the right amount of every flavor.  To keep them from being so greasy from the bacon, I soaked up some of the grease with a paper towel as soon as they were done.  Worked wonderfully.  Thanks Jackie...delicious.

I tweaked this just a little.....cooked 8 slices of bacon till crisp, removed, and sauteed onion and 3-4 cloves of garlic in the bacon grease..finally, I cooked about a pound of hamburger and added all of the above to the original recipe, and placed in a crockpot for 3-6 hours on low...great taste.

Very good flavor!  Made recipe a day ahead so flavors could ripen.  Served in a crockpot on low.  Also cooked it a little longer to thicken sauce.  Delicious!  Lots of compliments.

I used vegetarian baked beans and left out the bacon.  It was SO good - everyone loved it and there were no leftovers.  Also, I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I used apple cider vinegar instead. Yum!

Good recipe although I add cider vinegar instead of red wine. Anyone out there that has their mother's or grandmothers old bean pot...USE IT, I don't understand why but I swear it's MAGIC! I like this recipe but I think I could almost put anything in my mothers bean pot and they would be excellent!

Pretty good but still tastes like a can of pork & beans with stuff in it to me. Maybe if it were thicker with more meat in it that would do it for me. Less sugar works out well, I used 1/3 C. and got good results with sweetness & flavor. Next time I will try a small amount of molassis, 1/2 lb. of browned hamburger and cook a little longer to thicken it up a bit and give it that hearty, "stick to your ribs" quality that my pre-conception of baked beans ought to have.

When making baked beans from scratch, I love Alton Brown's Once and Forever Beans. But this recipe is the best I have found for turning regular canned beans into something amazing. I double the recipe, use Hormel Black Label Maple Bacon on top and cook them as along as I can - at least two hours - and end up with beans that are simply wonderful. Great for potlucks and even better warmed up over the next couple of days. Heck, give me a side of Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site and I've got dinner.

Good recipe.  One potential addition that would always be found in TX/OK barbecue:  put in a bit of liquid smoke, to taste.  I prefer the mesquite, though you might also try hickory.  It gives a unique piquancy and aroma that is very pleasing.

Absolutely stupendous! (that is a word, yes?).  Do NOT cut back on the brown sugar, as that is the key to just how delicious this recipe is.  Baked beans never tasted so good.  Don't be afraid to bake a bit longer than called for, as the bacon gets nice and crispy and the beans then really bond with the other great ingredients. Get frisky and add 1/4 cup bourbon and just look out!  I keep receiving rave reviews for something seemingly mundane as baked beans....love 'em!

Thanks Jackie for a wonderful Baked Bean recipe.  I wanted to make baked beans to go with dinner and I usually use my sisters recipe that is great and I couldn't find.  I found yours and it is so much like my sisters.  The only change that I made was that I saute the onion in the bacon grease and fried the bacon half way before placing on top of beans.  Will make this again.

Wonderful!!  I'm not sure you HAVE to have the sweet "baked beans" in a can (just in case you only have the regular p&b's on hand).  After all, the description does say you can wake up "pork and beans".
Anyhow, this recipe is awesome.  I LOVE the texture of the cooked bacon pieces. I couldn't believe the compliments I got. After all, baked beans are just baked beans...until these!

I have been using this as my go-to recipe for baked beans and always gotten rave reviews.  I am not sure why people think they are "runny"...there is no expectation on beans with that regard just give them a taste and you will see.  I do use apple cider vinegar over red wine vinegar as I usually have that on hand and I don't usually need to add much salt and pepper since I use pepper bacon and chop it up right into the beans.  YUMMY!

Yumm!  Very good proportions.  As others suggested I fried the bacon first, then sauted the onions in part of the remaining bacon grease.  I like green bell peppers in baked beans, so I sauteed about 3/4 of a cup chopped peppers along with the onions.

This is delicious. I was in a hurry so I cooked it in the microwave thinking it wouldn't thicken. I microwaved the onion for one minute before adding to the dish. I also microwaved the bacon between paper towels for two minutes until crisp, then broke it in pieces, placed it on top of the dish, and microwaved, covered, on high power for 5 min. I stirred it, and put in back, covered for 5 more minutes. I repeated this twice uncovered, for 3 minutes each stirring each time and it got thick and very hot. I let it sit a little to cool while serving dinner and they tasted great. I know they would be better cooked in the oven, but I was very impressed with these beans. My husband went back and ate all the beans that were left in the dish! Not bad for under 20 min!

I have made these many, many times and everyone LOVES them!  The only thing I have learned over time is to saute the onion first in a little (tbls. or so) olive oil.  I didn't like the texture of hard onion in the beans.  I also buy a package of REAL crumbled bacon (usually found in the salad dressing aisle) and mix with everything else.  The best baked beans ever!!!!

This recipe is really good when you add ground beef. I also used real bacon salad topping in it and cooked it on the stove top to make the cooking time shorter. My family liked it and hope to see it again.

Great Beans! As the Author states, adjust to personal taste. We use 1/2 the amount of brown sugar, small amount of Sweet Baby Rays instead of ketchup and crumble the bacon on top. Perfect for BBQ or picnic. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  After reading other reviews, I halved the amount of sugar and ketchup to 1/4 cup each.  I also crisped and crumbled 4 strips of bacon instead of two.  I threw it all in the crockpot for around 2 hours or so and it was delicious.  Not as good as my aunt's (who has some super secret recipe she refuses to spill!), but definitely close and definitely something I'll make again.  It made a great side dish for our BBQ chicken dinner.  We all had seconds!

A little runny so next time I won't add as much ketchup. Also, I recommend cutting each slice of bacon into 3 pieces so it makes serving much easier.

Wonderful taste. I used Bush Country style beans so I cut back on the brown sugar by about half. I chopped up about 8-10 slices of bacon, sauted it with the onion, stirred part of it into the beans and sprinkled the rest on top. This was a really fast dish to make. I didn't add any salt and pepper as it didn't need it.

This was a good recipe, but not great.  That could be my fault because I modified it slightly by using a 28 oz. can instead of two 15 oz. cans.  It was slightly runny.  I cut back the sugar by 1/2 but probably should have also cut back a little on the other seasonings.  The mustard seemed quite strong.  I think I would fry the bacon first, the next time, and then add it to the top.  It never got crunchy like I was expecting.  I have a similar recipe which also adds pork sausage and chopped green peppers, which is delicious.  I'll probably stick with that recipe.

I made these beans for 12 and let me tell you they were great. I mixed all the ingredients in a bowl first then added it to the beans. I did not add it all though cause it looked like they would have been to runny.They were great and we are having some leftovers for dinner tonight.  They have definetly thickened over night and I can't wait to eat them.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I adore this recipe.  On a cold winter night nothing beats a plate of bubbling hot baked beans and a side of corn bread.  The leftovers are great for lunch the next day, too.  I've never had a complaint about this dish.

Thought this was a good base for making it your own. I used ham, because I had some leftover ham I needed to use. Also switched out the ketchup for molasses, and put it all in the crock pot instead of baking. I also used 1/4 cup coconut sugar instead of brown sugar.
For the last hour of the cooking, I left the lid off of the crock pot, this allowed some of the moisture to escape, and made a thicker sauce. Will make again.

I used Bush's Brown Sugar and Bacon baked beans, added maple pancake syrup to mixture and used BBQ sauce (no Ketchup). I made this for a company potluck, so use a slow-cooker vs. oven, and everyone was asking me for recipe!  In slow cooker, cook on low for 3 hours or high for 2 hours.

This was so easy and my family loves it. The only things I did differently was a full onion (sliced thin and chopped) and replaced half of the catsup with smoky barbeque sauce. Great, simple, easy and very tasty. Thanks for this treat

I used the plain cheap canned pork and beans; no need to spend money on the beans when you're making your own sauce. I cut the sugar in half, and it was still quite sweet. I also used about 6 slices of chopped bacon that I blended right into the beans. I let everything simmer on low in the crockpot for five hours, and it was great served with ribs and slaw for a BBQ.

I really love this recipe for baked beans, and you can change the recipe to your taste. I use a small ceramic dutch oven and chop and brown turkey bacon then add onion to saute for a while and deglaze the pan with the vinegar and worcestershire sauce. Then I mix all the other ingredients in the pan, mix, and throw it in the oven. I'm making it for the third time tonight because my guy has requested it to go with our Easter ham.

These were just ok for us. The sauce never really thickened and there wasn't as much flavor as I like. I prefer recipes where you cook the sauce on the stovetop and then add it to the bean mixture so you can sample the sauce as you go. Thanks for sharing!

we use molasses instead of vinegar, but still add a bit of worcestershire sauce.  We double the amount of beans, but only use the liquid from half.  make sure to remove the little piece of pork fat in the cans, because it is very gross to bite into.  We make ours in a crockpot, for several hours, which gives it a caramalized flavor.  We add half of the beans at the beginning, and the other half a couple hours before serving.  We garnish with the bacon toward the end of cooking, rather than adding to the pot in the beginning.  Yum!

Loved it!! I made this dish at my parents home to go with hotdogs and a simple spinach salad.  Everyone raved about these beans.  Didn't have pork and beans, so I used two cans of Bush's Vegetarian Baked Beans.  Everything else was pretty much the same, except I used four slices of bacon on the top and cut them up in the beans after they baked.  Wonderful recipe! Thanks!

These are simply delicious and so easy to make! I finish cooking them with 5 minutes under the broiler. This crisps up the bacon and caramelizes the sauce. Yum!

I made these with dinner tonight and they were the best baked beans I have ever had, by far!!! I've never seen this before at www.eveything-bread.com The only thing I did different was that I used a jar of northern beans instead of the 2 15 oz. cans of baked beans with pork. I will definitely be making these again and will not be buying canned baked beans ever again!! Thank you for the recipe.

I made these tonight for dinner. Awesome! So easy, and so tasty. I cut the recipe back because there were only three of us. I did use less brown sugar than called for. I also fried my bacon ahead of time, the sauteed the onions in the leftover bacon grease. I didn't have any red wine vinegar on hand so skipped it. Just one delicious recipe that was super easy to make. Thank you, Jackie!

Very nice recipe. If you lighten up on the sugar, go ahead and add a teaspoon of molasses. This will give it a wonderful flavor. This is so simple, yet delish.

This was EXACTLY what I hoping for in a recipe to 'fancy up' inexpensive pork and beans.   I started out with a 7lb. can of 'Beans with Pork' and allowing for a larger amount of added ingredients, I and ended up with a very delicious crockpot full of beans that served my church family very well.  I baked the beans one day and reheated them in a crockpot the next day.  Thank You allrecipes.com ... this recipe is a real winner on many fronts.

So good! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a tad too sweet. The next time I made it, I used only 1/4 C sugar and it was much better, I also like to cut the bacon slice into pieces . After baking an hour, I broil it for a few minutes to crisp the bacon.

I didn't add the bacon and it just felt like there was a little something missing. Still enjoyed them and will defiantly make again but with the bacon.

This was very tasty, but the next time I make it, i think I'll cut down on the sugar.  it was a little on the sweet side.  Also, I accidentally used an extra piece of bacon, but how can extra bacon be a bad thing =-) .

Fantastic and easy.  I usually don't have time to actually bake them, so I start by sauteing the onion, then add 1/2 lb of chopped raw bacon.  When the bacon's mostly done frying, I add the rest of the ingredients and simmer.  It's terrific this way, but I'm sure it's great according to the original recipe, too. There are rarely leftovers in our house.

These beans are wonderful! I didn't change something though... instead of cooking them in the oven, I cook them on the stove and simmer them for 20 mins. I also used real bacon bits instead of slices of uncooked bacon. These were easy and really yummy! This is now our go-to grill out side recipe.

Very very good.  I used Pork & beans 30oz can and drained about 1/3 of liquid off.  I cut my bacon in pieces and folded them into the beans after they were done.  I'll make this again....many times....

Pretty good and easy. I did not add the bacon and used chili sauce simply because I was running low on ketchup I also did them on the stovetop because I needed them to be done fast. Good stuff and I like that they didn't use a bbq sauce in them.

This was truly excellent!  The only thing I'd change would be to add a bit more bacon next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and delicious! I substituted onion powder for the onion and left out the redwine vinegar. The grease from the bacon does sit on top initially, but I found that if I stir the beans before serving, the bacon grease adds wonderful flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe - it is my "go-to" baked bean recipe now.

So simple yet so tasty! Only thing is that I didn't have any red wine vinegar in my pantry, so I omitted it. Still worth the 5 stars though ;)

Super easy and good.  Even easier using dried chopped onions.  Baked beans are better made with dried onions...I don't know why.  Great recipe...Thanks!

These are the BEST baked beans I have ever made! I cut the bacon up and spread it across the top of the beans and then stirred them in after cooking.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a "T" and got rave reviews! Went very well with pulled pork BBQ sandwiches.

Hubby says these were pretty good.  I threw all the ingredients in the crock pot for two hours instead of using the oven.  I left out the vinegar as he doesn't like it, and I used turkey bacon since we don't eat pork.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this on the fly with what ingredients I had on hand. I didn't add worchestershire sauce, mustard, red wine vinegar or the salt and pepper. I'm sure by leaving those out we missed out on flavor dynamics, but it was good regardless. I also used real bacon bits instead of the uncooked bacon on top. And only cooked it for about 30 minutes due to time restraints. I was worried about it being too runny, so I drained the beans just a bit. Turned out excellent. I will make again.

Yum Yum Eat 'em Up!!! I always cook with those real bacon bits instead of uncooked bacon, so I added 2 T. to the mix. Deeeeelicious!!! Thought my husband was going to eat the whole pan full! BTW, use Van Camp's Pork & Beans. (not canned baked beans that are already sweetened)

I was looking for another side dish to serve at my son's 3rd birthday bash yesterday and thought baked beans would be an easy thing to have. Didn't really have a great recipe...so I looked and bingo I found this one, and will never look for another. I made a crockpot full (for about 20 people) and nothing was left at the end of the party. I did omit the vinegar and Worcestershire sauce..and added a can of Texas baked beans that contains chili powder and only used about a small handfull of brown sugar..I used Bush Baked Beans and they are already sweet. They were a hit and I will DEFINATELY have them again.

This was delicious!  My husband and son gave this a 5 star rating. I skipped the red wine vinager and bacon, opting to add sliced hot dogs instead. Nice hearty dish for two growing boys!! It's a keeper.

This tastes great!  I omit the bacon and it still is wonderful, so I now don't use it all.  I add hot dogs to this recipe and serve it over rice, with a salad or other vegie and call it a meal...and the good thing is, the whole family loves it!

LOVED THESE BEANS! (Sadly though - my family was singing the "musical fruit" song all night long!) I'm not a huge fan of baked beans but I had two helpings and enjoyed every bite. I like them sweet- which makes this recipe even more appealing to me.  I may cut the brown sugar back just a tad next time but everyone agreed these were a hit! Thanks Jackie!

I make this recipe practically twice a month during the summer.  I've received so many compliments on it.  However, I generally make it without the vinegar and it turns out wonderful nonetheless!

Fabulous! My husband is from NH and they love their baked beans in New England.  I have made them many times in my bean pot from scratch, but when he said he was in the mood for baked beans, I started searching for a quick replacement.  Found this recipe and it was a hit! I made it in a large Pyrex pan and cut up a pound of good hotdogs and let it bake in the oven.  I am trying this recipe out again tonight, but this time in the crockpot.  I agree that if you use baked beans in the can to cut back on the brown sugar, but other than that, this is a great recipe.

Yummy!  My boyfriend said these baked beans remind him of some that he used to eat at a restaurant in Louisiana.  My only suggestion would be to change the 1/2 cup of ketchup to 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup mustard.  I topped mine with 8 slices of extra lean turkey bacon, and it was great.  We gobbled up every last bit the next day at lunch

This was the second best baked beans recipe ever!  The best would be my mother's, but that takes all day to make, so I only make it on special occasions.  This will be my main recipe from now on.  So easy to make, had all the ingredients on hand, and wonderful taste.  I think the vinegar had a lot to do with the taste, because there was a hint of tartness, which I loved.  My son won't touch the beans, but my 4 yr old and 2 yr old daughters loved it!

Followed the recipe to a T. My guests loved it!  I asked them if they thought it was TOO SWEET, they said no! Told me to hold on to this recipe. These Baked Beans out did the other side dishes I served. Guests went back for seconds. Oh, well...guess EVERYONE has different taste on sweet. Thank you Jackie : )

I don't eat baked beans, but my friends rave about these, so I have to give it a 5!
I substituted 1/4 c. ketchup and 1/4 bbq sauce for the 1/2 c. ketchup and I also use ham if I don't have bacon (but not always).  
Love this recipe for me, because it is quick and easy.

In spite of not liking them and never preparing them before...I got stuck with bringing baked beans to a gathering,  

Made this using 2 28 oz cans of baked beans (1 of which I drained) and  1/2 of the sugar called for in the recipe.  Received so many compliments that I decided to taste them.  They were darn good.

Turned out well. Diced both onion and bacon and sauteed them together before adding them to bean mixture.

EASY GOOD. I have lost my own recipe and was 
happy to find this because I believe it is very close.
I followed this  recipes ingredients but I did not bake ,
I put in my slow cooker on low for a couple of hours
as I did with my original recipe. Also just added crumbled bacon at end. So Easy, double recipe,
freeze in a mason jar to have on hand for a breakfast with eggs.

I love the recipes (always a guide) and the reviews, so we can adjust to taste.  Halved the ketchup and I used half the amount for brown sugar (dark).  More bacon, kept everything else the same. Turned out wonderful, we will be having these again.

I decreased the recipe for 1-2 servings. I used one can of Campbell's Pork and Beans. Cut the brown sugar in half and omitted the onion since I used red wine garlic vinegar. I baked in the oven until thick, I'm not sure of the time but I didn't need to drain the beans and it was delicious! I cooked the bacon in the microwave for a minute to decrease the grease. It was a simple recipe that we enjoyed. I will make again.

We liked the flavor, but it was too sweet. Less brown sugar next time would make it a 5.

This recipe would be considered semi-homemade which is how I make baked beans these days.  I don't, however, use the semi-homemade baking recipes on allrecipes.com.  
It is a good basic recipe to follow while using some of the suggestions made by the other cooks.

Pretty good. I didn't really measure anything out, just sort of threw it together and I did add a few shakes of hot sauce and omitted the red wine vinegar. I threw it all in the crock pot and cooked on low a couple hours. Would make again.

Beans had a great flavor. I used only half the sugar and it was still a little too sweet for my taste. The reason for the four stars was mine turned out a little dry. Recipe did not say to cover with foil but I will next time.

Maybe I bastardized this recipe, but I cooked it on the stove and completely eliminated the bacon.  Just dump everything together in a pot, stir well, cover but vent to let reduce, and let it go while you work on a simple main dish.  Stir occasionally and in about 20 minutes you'll have some pretty tasty "baked" beans.

This recipe gets rave reviews whenever I make it.  I am not ordinarily a baked bean lover myself, but I really loved the way this pretty simple recipe made plain ol' baked beans taste so incredible!  Even I went back for seconds & thirds.  This dish does not last long around my house!

Simple changes to spice this dish up a notch and according to what I had on hand: Substituted Spicy Mustard for regular Mustard and Soy Sauce for the Worcestershire. Reduced the Brown Sugar and Ketchup to 1/4 cup each. Omitted the Salt [because there's enough in the Canned Beans] and sprinkled Black Pepper liberally into the mixture. Yum!!!

Good.  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 c and the ketchup to 1/4 c also.  And I increased the bacon to 4 slices.

I made these beans and served with Barbequed Ribs.  They were a perfect side dish for the dinner.  We served the leftovers with our bacon & egg breakfast the next morning.  Whether for breakfast or dinner, these beans will be a hit!  Easy and delicious.

I was looking for an easy "tweaked" baked bean recipe and found this one and made in on Memorial Day.  They were delicious!  I was specifically asked to make them again for 4th of July.  I did cut back on the brown sugar and eyeballed the ketchup last time.  I plan to cut up the bacon, slightly fry and mix in this time.  Don't leave out the vinegar, it adds a slight "umph" to this dish.  This one went into my recipe box.

I made this recipe for a cookout at my house.  I tripled the recipe but instead of adding 1 and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, I added 1 cup.  It was a real hit!  Yummy recipe!

These were perfect!  Had to use ingredients I had on hand which were pinto beans (rinsed & drained), bacon bits (real bacon kind) and white vinegar.  EVERYBODY loved them.  Threw it all in a saucepot and cooked on stove on low heat until everything else was ready to eat.  This is now my go to recipe for baked beans.  Thank you for sharing!

VERY TASTY!!  I was hungry for baked beans, but I didn't have the assortment of beans I needed to make my favorite recipe, so I thought I'd give this a try.  We both liked these a lot.  It may not replace my favorite, but it's great to make if you just have regular canned baked beans on hand.  My can of beans was 28 oz., so I scaled back the other ingredients a bit and only ended up using 3 T. of brown sugar.  The bacon on the top may have added flavor, but it didn't crisp up for me and was unappealing looking when it came out of the oven.  I might skip the bacon next time to compare.  Regardless, I will make this one again!  Thank you!!  UPDATE 11/13/12 - I made this again and instead of putting the raw bacon on top, I cooked the bacon completely in the microwave, crumbled it and mixed it in with the beans.  I would do that again next time.

I took it to a function and only a few beans were left in the pan.  A very good recipe.  I did add some cut up, sauteed onions and bell peppers and a lot more bacon.

We thought these were just average in taste and not really worth the effort when there are so many delicious canned baked beans on the market. No complaints tho as they were gobbled up by my gang. Thank you!

This was my first time making baked beans and it was so easy to do. I made them for a BBQ and by the end of the night they were all gone!! The only thing I did different (on accident, I wasn't paying attention at the store) was I bought pork n beans, but next time I will use the baked beans and use less sugar.

Used pork n beans with bacon - so I did not add any. I also softened the onion in the microwave with a pat of butter - used vidalia. These were awesome! Cooked one day ahead - then just re-heat for the big cook out!

These are just like my mom made, delicious.  I used less brown sugar and more bacon.  I took them to a cookout and they were one of the first dishes gone. Will be making again.

These were just what I was looking for on 4th of July!!! I would have liked the sauce to be a tad thicker, and it seemed like there was just a flavor missing. I can't put my finger on it just yet, but these definitely hit the spot! I will be keeping this recipe handy for when I want some BBQ Baked Beans =)

I will never use another baked beans recipe. I made this on Tuesday for a barbeque and everyone loved it! The only change I made was to use slightly less sugar and I also cooked the bacon about halfway before topping the beans with it. It was great and I will definitely make again soon.

ETA: I have made these beans several times since my original review and these beans are consistently delicious! To those who have issues with this being runny, I always "drain" the liquid from my beans before adding the ingredients. Don't know if this helps or not, but my beans are never, ever runny. I guess it may depend on what brand of canned beans you use, but I always use the store brand from Walmart and they tend to have a bit of liquid in them, so I simply drain the liquid and continue.

Delicious!  I did cut back to 1/4 cup for the brown sugar, and after making them I will also cut back on the ketchup when I make them again.

These taste just like the beans my dad made growing up. Great to have a recipe as dad just "dumped" things in. With some playing around, I've found my favorite is to use 4 slices of applewood smoked bacon and soak navy beans instead of the canned, if I'm planning ahead. The applewood bacon adds a touch of extra flavor that really makes these "pop". We like these better the next day, making them perfect for a cookout with friends.. gotta love those make ahead things!

this is a cool recipe but first i drain the beans and use about a 1/4 pound or less of seasoned ground beef(garlic powder, seasoned salt and pepper maybe some onion powder) instead of bacon also i used bbq sauce instead of the worchestershire sauce and plenty more mustard(the extra mustard gives it a great flavor)  and sugar(i love sweet beans)i omitted the red wine vinegar also i put mine in the oven for about 20 min or so. delish!!!! i may try it with the worchestershire sauce sounds good

MMM...these were so good. I used vegetarian baked beans and bacos instead of pork and beans and bacon. I think I might have accidentally put in a tad more red wine vinegar too... The sauce was thick and rich, and people couldn't get enough! A nice addition to our BBQ.

I was pinched on time and wanted a baked beans recipe I could put together easily.   This came together in a flash and I could just put in the oven and forget about it. They definitely taste like a "southern" baked bean recipe and not the molasses flavor like a northern baked bean.  I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.  Next time I think I will cook the bacon first so I can render off some of the fat.   I also added some pickled jalapenos to the top 30 minutes in for a little heat.  I wouldn't make these as my standard baked beans - but, they had really good flavor for an such an easy recipe and was well received by my husband.

My father eats baked beans with EVERY meal! My mother had started work and he was out of beans, so I looked up a recipe online that sounded like it had all the ingredients he liked. This one was AMAZING! I added 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and 1 tblspn of jarred jalepeno juice for a smoky, spicy flavor! Fabulous! Thanks very much for sharing.

These are great and super easy.  I don't know if this has already been said, but i threw in some ground cayenne pepper for some added kick.  Also listened to the other reviews and used about half the brown sugar.  Try it!

Don't change a thing.  This recipe is spot on.  We love rich, down home baked beans and these hit the spot.  My grandmother-in-law is a vegetarian and she will pick the bacon off and grab her a big 'ole heaping.  If you are looking for a baked bean recipe stop here...don't waste your time elsewhere.

I have made this numerous times and I have found that everyone has always said it was ok until I omitted the vinegar and substituted onion powder for the onions. Then they thought it was GREAT!! If you like a twang to your beans leave in the vinegar and if you like crunch to your onions leave in the onions. Thanks for such a good and easy basic bean recipe.

The prep time for this dish is so quick and easy,
and tastes much better than what you can buy in a
can or at a deli. I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup
as other reviewers suggested, and it was still too
sweet, to me. My wife, however, said they were the
best baked beans she ever had. Didn't use the
bacon and increased the worcestershire sauce to
1 tbs. Also added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes for a
little kick, and 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke. A 5 star dish
that is highly recommended!

These were soooo good!  The only problem I had is that the bacon didn't crisp at all...next time, I will probably fry the bacon separately and crumble over the top.  Great flavor though, these will be my staple baked beans recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

When I was growing up, Saturday night was always "beaners and weins". Until I tried this baked bean recipe I only ate the weiner part of the meal in the for of a hot dog. Now I love the beans as does the rest of the family. Note-- I forgot to add the mustard but the dish was still yummy. Thanks!

People (including those who consider themselves "baked-bean-lovers") LOVED this dish... Tripled the recipe for a potluck and baked it in one of those big tin roasting pans.  Perfect.

I made this recipe in the crock pot using the ingredients as listed in the recipe.  My husband loved it but I thought the dish was too sweet.  He signed me up to make it for a party with 30 guests so I plan to make it in the oven and cut down on the sugar.  Don't tell him!

Pretty decent recipe here. I liked the flavor but there was something different that the worcestershire added. Not bad at all, but no raves here. We much prefered the "simple baked beans" recipe from here. This was a very simple recipe to do and pretty tasty, just not our favorite.

I left out the red wine vinegar but other than that made the exact recipe. Beans were very very sweet. If I make again I will cut back on the brown sugar. They were good with our Bar-B-Q

This is such a good way to spice up pork and beans.  I am not a big fan of them at all, but my husband and I loved this.  Good additions to make a plain old can of beans taste so much better.

Great recipe. I had a gallon of pork 'n beans that I needed to use and a large crowd coming to a Super Bowl party. I  used this recipe and changed the # of servings. It worked out great and everyone thought they were really good.

This is the basic recipe for baked beans that I have been using for years with the exception of the red wine vinegar. To be different, I wanted to try this using the red wine vinegar as called for, but sorry to say just did not really like it. I like using cider vinegar much better in my baked beans. Otherwise, I think this is a fantastic way to prepare baked beans.

These were some of the best baked beans I've ever eaten!  The only change I made was to reduce the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Turned out perfect!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I cooked the bacon first, I used a whole pound as I doubled the recipe, and I like bacon. Then put it all in my crockpot, and cooked on low for a few hours. Better than regular canned beans.

Great recipe- perfect baked beans.  They were a TOUCH too sweet for us, so I'll cut down on the brown sugar next time, but that's just a matter of personal taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a winner.  Made it for the 4th of July cookout and everyone raved how great it was.  My son, who has hated every baked bean recipe I've made to date, actually complimented me on them and stated that it was a keeper for all future cookouts.

This was a great way to kick up those plain old baked beans. I did omit using the bacon but the flavors from all the other ingredients really gave these beans a good zippy taste. Next time I'll try it with the bacon slices. But if you're in a pinch, they taste just great without out it!

I don't even really care for baked beans and I loved this.  Hubby is a diabetic and loves baked beans but never gets to have them.  Only thing I changed was I subbed the brown sugar for 1/2 as much Splenda brown sugar and they came out "wonderful" :)

This was a huge hit with the family. Served this as a main dish and mixed shredded pork (boston butt) cooked the night before. Added extra pre-cooked strips of bacon. This was wonderful, VERY sweet. Thanks!

Fantastic recipe.  I made a simple crust to go on top of beans turned out fantastic!!Hughe success.  If you want to add a little extra zest to recipe try this crust on top of beans before baking. Cut up and crisp about 6 pieces of bacon on the stove (don't fully crisp because it will continue to crisp while baking in oven)add to bacon and bacon grease 4 stalks of chopped green onion, and 1 cup of bread crumbs. Mix together and spread on top of beans and bake as recipe requires.  Adds a delicious crisp crust to the already fabulous bean dish!!!

All the flavor of made-from-scratch beans without all the soaking and boiling.  I tossed everything in my crockpot (cutting the sugar in half since I used Bush's Beans).  I just cooked some thick-cut bacon seperate and added to the crockpot the last half hour of cooking time.  Very easy and great flavor.

Try making this recipe with several different kind of beans (well-drained).  I also left out the vinegar but added onions and a touch of molasses.  My husband couldn't get enough.  Neither could our guests!

I gave this recipe a 4 star rating only because it is confusing to a novice cook. The ingredients call for BAKED BEANS, why would you add BAKED BEANS to make BAKED BEANS...WAY too sweet. The text called for PORK N BEANS and that is what I used. Turned out terrific!

Excellent!  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped bell pepper for color.  I made 2 batches of these, one in which I experimented with draining the canned beans, and adding beer in place of the juice.  Both varieties were wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Ironically enough, I hate baked beans. lol.  But my family loves them so I tried this on two different groups over the July fourth and Memorial day holidays.  Everyone LOVED them and wanted to know the specifics.

Two enthusiastic thumbs up from my extended family!

This is sooo good.  I've made it a couple of times now, and I'm already getting requests for it when it's time for the next get-togethers.  You can prepare it the night before, then put it in the oven the next day.  I baked it for an hour and then took it out and went straight to the picnic.  YUM!

This was wonderful!!!  I was a little skeptical about the balsamic vinegar at first, and I was running low on time, so I put the beans in the microwave instead of the oven and they still turned out great :-)

This was very good.  Although beans weren't very thick when they came out of the oven, they did thicken as they cooled.  The vinegar and mustard give this dish a little kick.  I will definately use this recipe whenever I make baked beans.

Made this for a BBQ Memorial Weekend and everyone loved it!  I baked it for one hour and then took it to the BBQ and placed it in a low heat oven while the steaks were BBQ'd.  It was perfect - not to juicy and not to dry.  Got many compliments.  Thanks Jackie.  This will be my permanent baked bean recipe.

Great recipe.  I slightly browned the bacon in a skillet then sauted the onion in the bacon grease.  This was great.

I really didn't care for this recipe. Though I've made baked beans somewhat like this in the past, these just tasted too sharp (for lack of a better word.)There's no way one could sit down with a large bowl of these beans and a piece of corn bread...the taste was too strong.

Great recipe.  My son thought they were a bit too sweet, but it would be easy to cut down on the sugar.  I substituted vegetarian baked beans for the pork and beans.

This recipe was well received at a recent cook out.  Sweetness was just right.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I attended a Memorial Day party and was asked, along with another mother, to bring baked beans.  At the end of the party I felt so bad . . . my baked beans were GONE, and hers weren't even touched.  EVERYONE asked me for the recipe!!

I made too many black and pinto beans for a taco soup, so I used what was left for these baked beans.  Even though the wrong beans, it was fantastic.  It is probably better with Navy beans, which I'll do next time.

switched ketchup with BBQ sauce.  Sauteed the onions with the bacon (and doubled both).  Onions caramelized slightly which was awesome.  I put a little too much vinegar in so I let it cook for about 30 minutes and it drove it off.  I love the vinegar taste but was afraid my guests wouldn't.  Everyone loved it.

Do NOT just place the bacon on top...it will Not brown in an hour. I had to broil it before serving and it made the top greasy. Cook the bacon then add it.   The recipe was Ok otherwise.

Very tasty beans! I cut back on the ketchup but added a little molasses and some liquid smoke. Since I did not use the bacon, I didn't have to be concerned about it crisping, so I didn't have to keep it in the oven for an hour. I've found similar recipes on this site, and 35 min or so (without the bacon to cook) worked fine. You get the same or better quality with preparing beans this way then using the dry beans. Saves time and effort. Thanks for this great recipe!

These were surprisingly very good. I halved the recipe because I didn't want to make a huge batch for just me and my husband. I won't be making that mistake again. The recipe is really simple and makes a great side dish too.

I didn't actually make this but I thought I'd chime in on the "soupiness" issue. My mom makes the best pork and beans-based baked beans on the planet. She has no written recipe, she just takes a zen-like approach to it. When it comes to the "soupiness" of the finished product the one thing you need to keep in mind is that different brands of pork and beans often contain different amounts of liquid. Even the same brand can vary from can to can. Mom's able to eyeball it and drain enough liquid (or not) to compensate. It's almost a sixth sense she's developed over the years, and her baked beans always come out perfect! It's just one of those many variables that cooking throws at us and we need to learn how to adjust. Hope this helps!

These are very good! I am used to the real thing but these are a very nice change. Next time I will look for some salt pork or thicker bacon slices and cook lower and slower . I only had time to cook them for 45 minutes. Good recipe!

Great foundation recipe. I use a pound of chopped bacon rather than bacon strips. Incorporating the bacon in the beans really gives it a great flavor.

3.15.18  Tough to beat these baked beans starting with pork & beans (drained)  right out of the can.  We eat “less sweet” these days, so I would cut the brown sugar back the next time.  I typically add a little O.J. or pineapple juice to my baked beans, and today, I added some juice from my fresh pineapple.  I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings and used a small dish.  Had I used a larger one, I also would have added a bit of the fresh sliced pineapple on top to cook along with the bacon.   No complaints here, good recipe and good beans.

Good, but still too sweet even after reducing the sugar by half. I also drained some of the liquid from the beans and didn't have any problems with "runniness" like others have mentioned. Will likely make again but will reduce the sugar to my taste.

If you add 2 to 2 1/2 tsp. Of liquid smoke, it will taste good. Warning: make sure you do not get a brand that sucks. Read the ingredients.

I liked it. I may try to add some molasses...it's almost just like my mom's and I think maybe she used molasses too. But overall, this is a really good recipe. (I like to add some cayenne pepper for a "kick.") Thank you for sharing your recipe!

After I altered the waaay too much mustard, YIKES! I gave this a 4. I first increased the servings to 12 for a family gathering. I always start with half the ingredients for obvious reasons (except the bacon! :) ) It tasted like total mustard! OMG not a fan! So I kept adding more of everything else and at the end of the day the beans were gone and everyone loved them. So you can just use a teaspoon of mustard and add as you  like. Thanks for the basic recipe Jackie, I've never had vinegar in beans but that was a secret ingredient that was amazing, thanks!

Delish. Pulled bacon off and microwaved to crisp and then cut up and mixed into the beans.

Wonderful. I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I'm not sure if I'll ever need to try another recipe for baked beans because we loved these. Mine weren't runny at all and I didn't drain the beans, which were Bush's. They were in the oven for a good hour and I did stir them after half an hour.

I used to think MY beans were the best - these surpassed mine!!
A mistake I always made was - making on stovetop- not baking. I found that by baking the 'baked' beans made them thicker and flavorful- 
I did add more bacon- ( i always have cooked bacon pieces in freezer to add to dishes) 
I added some molasses 
Did not find this to be too sweet 
I did do - as others mentioned- drain and rinse beans.

Delicious. Following several reviews, I cut sugar in half. I also drained (though not thoroughly) 2 of the three cans of Bush's beans I used in my 1 1/2 recipe. I used country style mustard and cut up the bacon into small pieces. I added pepper but no salt.

We enjoyed these.  So easy using canned baked beans and just adding things you already have in your pantry.  I will definitely make these again.

Love these...I drain the juice out of one of the pork N beans and leave the juice in on the other, this helps to keep it from being runny. Everything else is perfect!

I'm not a huge fan of baked beans normally, but this came out very well. I had this HUGE can of baked beans sitting in my basement for quite some time, and I ended up using this recipe to prepare it a take it with us to a rental house down the shore we were sharing with my wifes's family for a week. Had to quadruple the recipe for the size of the can, and even with 10 people in the house we ate beans for a week. But everyone seemed to really enjoy them. Very easy to make as well. I would make it again (in a few months when I'm ready to at least look at a baked bean again....)

Everyone raved about these beans at a recent cookout.  I used a 55 oz can and eyeballed the measurements.  I cooked the onion and bacon before stirring them into the beans then topped the beans with raw bacon.  Baked for about 45 minutes until bubbly, then broiled another 5 minutes to crisp the bacon.

Very easy recipe.  I drained the beans very well.  Next time I would bake at 375 degrees in order to evaporate moist texture ( from ketchup and molasses I added) in order to have "sticky beans.". The taste was delicious.

I used to love my mom's baked beans.  She just made it with a little bit of this and that and never used a recipe.  I was never able to make it like she did until this recipe.  This is a perfect match.  

I am so glad to have this now so that I can enjoy the same baked beans I ate as a child.

I made these (a lot of these) for my parents 50th anniversary surprise party. I can't eat them because I am allergic to pork, but I had so many comments from people wanting to know where I got them. Several people told me that they were- best beans they had ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the vinegar because I forgot to pick it up when I went to the store.

I will never have canned baked beans again.  These were easy to make and possibly the best baked beans I have ever had.  I did not have any baked beans so I used pork and beans.  AWESOME!  Wish they had 10 stars.

I really like this! I did however make a few changes. I used 4 slices bacon,  drain  one  can of pork and beans of the two, and added a can of giant butter beans for visual interest; drained of course.

I followed suggestions to cut sugar and catsup in half.  Made 1.5  times the recipe, added a bell pepper and a 12 oz package of cooked bacon cut into 1/2 inch pieces.  Baked for two hours.  Delicious!

I have to say I was nervous these would be too sweet as I tasted them before baking. However, cooked down they were perfect-my father-in-law raved over them. I did use cannelini beans instead. Will definitely make again.

I just made these baked beans exactly as written, except that I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9 X 13-inch pan. In fact, they will come out of the oven in 4 minutes. I've already tasted them and they are way too sweet. I would definitely use this recipe again because they have a wonderful flavor, but I would have to cut the amount of brown sugar in half or less. I fixed them for a cookout we are attending in about 30 minutes. I hope our friends like extra sweet baked beans.

Really good recipe overall.

I wanted a vegetarian option so I started with  vegetarian beans.  Then instead of bacon, I added 1/4 tsp liquid smoke to get the bacon flavor.

I used 2 19 oz. cans Campbell's pork an beans, 1/2 the sugar, the rest of the recipe.  I wasn't sure weather to cover while baking.  I didn't have much liquid in my mix so covered after 30 min as it looked to be getting dry.  Also, chopped up SIX pieces of bacon and mixed in.  Yummy!

I've used this recipe a few times and always get rave reviews.  After a few attempts, I've decided there is a better balance of flavors if either the canned beans are doubled or the other ingredients are halved.  And the bacon?  Just about impossible to have too much!

For the ease if making this and the taste that comes out is why get 5 stars.  Quick easy and good!  Some other recipes out there that may taste a bit better, but no way are they this easy to make with almost everything already in the pantry.

I halved the recipe, and I didn't put any onions in it.. as some reviewers did, I used apple cider vinegar.  I thought it was a little too tart, maybe less mustard?  This has potential with a little more work.

These were quite tasty & a simple way to spruce up a regular can of pork&beans. I only had one can on hand so I halved the recipe & followed it EXACTLY & it was indeed a bit sweet but went well with the ribs I served with them (had I served ribs with a sweeter bbq sauce I'd cut down on the sugar in the beans). I cooked them in a Pyrex dish about half the recommended size (I think my dish is about 9 x 4.5") for the full hour and they weren't at all mushy (as some reviewers said), the sauce thickened up quite nicely, though I did use center cut bacon, which would be less fat dripping into the beans than if you used cheap bacon. I also cut the bacon into 3 pieces & laid those diagonally on top, which allowed each of the three servings when served in a small bowl a nice piece of bacon served on top.

Made these for super bowl tonight (GO HAWKS!) and they were a massive HIT! I reduced the sugar and ketchup as others recommended and omitted the worchestire sauce completely. Added 3 strips of bacon and use Busch's Homestyle beans and it was so good! Thickness was perfect, especially as the cooled off a bit. Thanks!

I made this for a cookout I had when everyone left my 9x13 pan was empty. So I made it again for my family again the 8X8 pan was empty. This seems to be the only baked bean recipe I made with no left overs. It is easy to make and tasted so good.
 I like to cut the bacon in tiny bite size so when it's done I mix it with the beans.

Very easy and delicious way to doctor up ordinary pork and beans.  I used about a 1/4 lb. of bacon cut into bite sized pieces and cooked it together with the onions before I added to the mix.

These were delicious.  I used Bush's vegetarian beans so I could take some out for my niece who is a vegetarian and add bacon to the rest.  Both were delicious, but I swear the vegetarian ones tasted just like the ones from KFC.  Yummo!

This recipe is decent. Makes good baked beans. The only issue I ran into was that I did not drain my cans of beans so my baked beans ended up being a little runny. I recommend draining the beans! But overall decent recipe :)

like others, I also cut the brown sugar & ketchup both in half since it sounded like too much. I only had 1 can of pork & beans so I substituted plain white beans for 1 can. They turned out delicious, I will make these again!

These were so easy and so good! Followed other users advice and only used half the sugar. Also, I chopped the bacon and slightly sauteed with the onion. Then mixed all together and baked. Got several compliments and will definitely make these again!

I made these baked beans for a picnic and everyone loved them.  The only thingI did  different was to cut down on the sugar.  I will make these for many picnics in the future.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were great with a few changes - cut sugar and ketchup to 1/4 c like others suggested.  Beans are sweet enough as is.. Used plain baked beans- not pork.  Put in crock pot- high for 4 hours with 3 slices bacon ontop.  They were SO easy to make- will def make again. Thanks!

I used less brown sugar and I still thought it was grossly sweet.  However, my family loved it and raved that they were the greatest and sweetest beans they've ever had....so if you like sweet beans go for it, but it's not for me....OR make sure the store bought beans are sugar free before you add more.

This recipe makes the baked beans creamy and sweet.  My family looks forward to me making them each time I cook.  I like the way they turn out thick. Terrific for picnics!!

Great recipe and very easy to prepare.  I quadrupled the onion (I like onion.)  I also cut up a few pieces of bacon and took the reserved fat to sautee the onions, then mixed the onions and bacon with the beans.  Put a couple of whole slices of bacon on top, and baked.  Excellent.

My husband didn't care for this dish and unfortunately he is the only one in the house that likes baked beans, so I am going on his opinion. In all fairness to the recipe, he thought that the beans were too sweet maybe next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar.

An easy and tasty way to dress up your standard can of baked beans.  You cannot mess this up!  I over baked mine and they were still delicious.  I left out the bacon and they were still good, but bacon would make them even better.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great recipe for someone who doesn't have a lot of time.  I left out the bacon to bring for a party for the vegetarians.  Soon everyone was eating it.  I should have made a double batch.

These were just okay. There were tons of leftovers because nobody wanted to eat them. I actually prefer just plain old canned beans to these.

I've made these twice and they are always a hit.  I follow the recipe to a "T" and throw it into a crock pot for a few hours prior to serving. They always seem to be better the following day.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these beans were interesting.  I mean that in a good way, just slightly different than any baked beans I have ever had.  I cooked the onion with a couple of sliced up pieces of bacon.  I took my toping bacon off before I served the beans.

This was just "ok" for us. My husband didn't like the mustard at all, but that is just personal preference. Also, next time I would cook the bacon a bit before putting it on top of the beans. I would sautee the onions with the bacon to soften them a bit, as mine were still "raw". We love sweet beans but these were over the top.

This is a good recipe using premade canned beans.  I gave it a four star- because it was way too sweet for me and I did cut the sugar in half.  Will make again though with NO added sugar.

What a great dish for a cookout!!! Since I only used 3 strips of bacon I fried the rest, crumbled it up and put some in the beans.  Needless to say the dish was scraped clean.

Everyone raved about these beans.  So simple to make, they have excellent flavor.  Instead of placing bacon on top, I cut it up and stirred it throughout for extra bacon flovor.

These were delicious!  I do cut back on the brown sugar a bit though.

These were good! I used Campbells Pork and Beans... next time I may use another brand. I cut the brown sugar in half as well.

These were ok.  All I really tasted was ketchup, they didn't seem any better than just plain old baked beans straight out of the can.  I did leave out some of the brown sugar, but that was the only adjustment I made.

These were really good.  They had the right amount of sweetness and taste of onion.  They could have been cooked longer if someone has the time to do so to make them thicker but they were fine as is.  I will be making these again.

Very similar to one I have made for years.  I did as others suggested and cut back on sugar to 1/4 cup,increased Worcestershire to 1 TBS, and used 6 slices of chopped bacon.

This was the best!  Only advice: I changed the ingredients to recommended measurements for 14 to serve at a party and we had a lot left over, which was a good thing, but I will cut measurements down to 10 for our next cookout for 14 people as refrigerator space is at a premium, no room for leftovers.

I LOVED the onions and bacon!  I made some changes but this is a great recipe.  I used three 15 oz. cans of pork & beans and one can of chili beans (didn't drain the chili beans).  I like the texture, flavor & color variety of two different beans.  I also partially cooked my bacon in the mircowave before putting it on my beans.  And I used extra bacon.  Excellent recipe!

My husband told me to rate this 5 stars and I completely agree.  I did alter a bit, no vinegar, 1/4 cup brown sugar because the beans I used already had some brown sugar and no bacon.  These were easy and simply wonderful!

This recipe was great.  I also am from Canada so I used the Heinz beans and I ommitted the vinegar.  I used half the sugar and added 1/4 cup of molasses as one user suggested.  Very good, will make these again - though I think I'll take out the bacon next time, I didn't care for that much.  Maybe if it hadn't been so fatty it would have been better.

These were great! If you use sweetened baked beans, 1/3 C brown sugar is perfect. I increased the Worcestershire sauce to 1 T, used a whole onion and added a bit extra ketchup and mustard. I also omitted the bacon and red wine vinegar. These are no-fail barbecue fare, and so tasty!

This was pretty good but I think it needed more bacon and omit the vinegar, it overpowered the beans. I added a bit more brown sugar to round out the flavor a bit.  Overall, pretty good recipe.  Will use again, without the vinegar and add maybe some molasses too.

At my husband's request, I was looking for a traditional baked bean recipe to serve at a BBQ.  This one was perfect and worthy of the consistent high rating & good reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was super easy and I received compliments from our guests on it.

These beans are fantastic. I am from Canada so I have never heard of Bushes Bakes Beans. I used Heinz deep browned beans and it still turned out great. I also cut the sugar in half. Great Recipe!

This was just ok.  It would pass at an outdoor BBQ.  It was a bit sweet for my taste and I would have liked a thicker consistancy.

I am not one for beans, but I made these for a family get-together and they were wonderful!  My sister, who really hates beans, took a big bowl home for supper!  I ended up eating them for supper and lunch the next day!!!  The sauce is wonderful!

Whooowee those beans were good!!!  I made these last night for a neighborhood party and they were a huge hit; the first dish to empty.  I doubled the recipe, but for the beans I used 2- 28oz. cans of Bush's Baked Beans, and cut the amount of sugar in half.  I baked these for about 1.5 hours (I got busy & forgot them) and they turned out delicious with a perfect sauce, not runny.  After baking, I added cooked and cut up pieces of bacon to the top.  I'm wishing I had some leftovers & may have to make this again this week.

I could have served beans straight out of the can and they would have been this good.  Way too sweet.

I only used half the sugar and it was still too sweet for me.  I browned the onion and cooked four slices of bacon for the top.

I wasn't that impressed.  They were a little too runny for my taste and I had quite a lot left over after my barbeque.  Probably will not make again.

I was not overly impressed with this recipie.  If a person added a few different kind of beans it would probably be much better.  I used Bushes canned beans which are flavorful enough without all the added work of this recipe. Too thick and saucy for our taste.

This just might be the only baked beans recipe I use from now on.  Even family who don't eat baked beans enjoyed them.  Not too sweet like some other recipes.

I thought this dish was wonderful!  This was only my second time ever to make homemade baked beans, and I will definitely use this recipe for now on.  Even my picky husband liked it!

These were good and had good flavor.  I cut the measurements in half and used 2 cans baked beans as the recipe stated.  The description said pork and beans so next time I will try that.  I used 1/4 cup molasses as another reviewer suggested and no brown sugar and they were still a little bit sweet, next time I will use less.

My first attempt at "homemade" baked beans...  What a success!  I actually made them in a crockpot though so I wouldn't have to crank up the oven.  I left the lid off for awhile to allow the moisture to evaporate, though the broth was still a little runny.   They were a big hit at our cookout!  Many went back for seconds and thirds! UHOH!!

My husband made these for Mother's Day, and they came out great.  Could have possible cooked a little longer to thicken up a bit, but they thickened up after they sat a while.  
Very quick and EASY recipe!

Wonderful recipe-a definite keeper!  My 3 year old, a picky eater,  helped me make this last night, and then she ate a large serving.  She asked me when we could make it again.  DELICIOUS!

Thank you so much.  It is not often I can impress my husband with a recipe.  This one, however, pleased him as well as my four children who range from age 3 to age 7.  There aren't many recipes that can achieve such high expectations.  As for myself, I haven't tasted a better baked beans recipe since my mother's, and I would put these in a race with her's any day!

My family and friends love this recipe.  I make it for all our barbecues.  However, I cook the bacon first (not crispy) just enough to get a little of the fat and saute' the onions in the fat.  It's a fantastic recipe.  Tastes like Grandma's all-day beans!

I had this recipe for my husband family gathering and it was the best bake beans I ever had, even for the kids that don’t like baked beans and they eat them. I will recommend it.
