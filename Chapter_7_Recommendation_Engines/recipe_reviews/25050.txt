SO SO SO SO GOOD!  These turned out rich and gooey and chocolatey and very much like something you would get a restaurant topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  I have never made a better tasting bar-type dessert at home.  I used the microwave to melt the butterscotch chips and butter together.  Just mix every 10 seconds at first, then every 5 seconds once the chips have softened up until it is combined and smooth.  I will make this again and again.

SO GOOD! These are delicious and VERY rich! My family loved them. I added an extra 1/2 cup of marshmallows and made sure to really grease the sides of the pan (the marshmallows like to stick). They fall apart if you eat them hot (but they are sure good hot). Let them cool completely in the pan and they cut into bars really easily. I cooked for 18-20 minutes. Keep an eye on the marshamllows or they burn.

I've used both recipes in this site and both are great! I found myself yearning for some nuts in it, though. Will add about a 1/2 cup next time - I'm going to experiment with chopped peanuts, walnuts and pecans (individually for starters).

I made this and wasn't sure how it will turn out just because of all of the marshmallows required. They melted and the only thing reason you knew they were there was due to the chewiness of the brownies!! Great! I loved the chocolate chips as well. One other thing- I didn't have butterscotch chips but I did have butterscotch syrup from an ice cream sundae so i used that and it still turned out great! Thanks

These certainly disappeared for me.  I used white chocolate chips instead of semisweet, but I (and everyone else) still thought they were delicious.  My only complaint is that they really fell apart once I tried to get them out of the pan.  Next time, I am going to try refrigerating them overnight before trying to remove and/or cut.

If you like butterscotch chips, then you'll probably really like these brownies. We all liked them, but didn't love them. When we think of brownies we think of chocolate/fudge, not butterscotch, but they were good. Easy to make.

These are the bomb!  I love the combination of flavors.  I don't usually have marshmallows on hand, but always have marshmallow creme.  I just use a 7oz tub and swirl it into the brownie batter when i add the chocolate chips.  It works perfectly every time.  I will say that these have to cook longer than 15-20 minutes even in my convection oven.  Delicious!

My husband liked them, but I thought they were way too sweet and too much choc chips, more like candy.  I also made the other version which is on this web site - has a little less sugar and only 1/2 cup choc chips and I thought were much better.

This was very rich, gooey and delicious. A great dessert to serve warm with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. I loved it just the way it was but next time I might try adding some oatmeal to make the texture less gooey and I think I might like it with a few less chocolate chips.This is one dessert that will knock you on the floor.

These were heavenly. I couldn't resist eating them. My husband loved them also. The only change i made was I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips. I will be making these again and again. Very easy!

absolutely amazing!  i had to switch the amounts of butterscotch and chocolate chips because of what i had (or didnt have) on hand.  also, i used up my stale marshmallows for this, and just cut the full size ones into quarters.  i served it with ice cream and it was truly fantastic.  i'm a dessert kind of girl, and this one is so worth  it!

Very good, rich dessert. As others have noted, you can cut back on the chocolate chips -- it's sweet enough as is. With the marshmallows, it can be hard to tell when it's done. I baked mine for 30 minutes; the edges got a little brown, but it was still moist.

Almost candy, very rich and gooey.  They don't last long in my house.  I like to make them because I don't have to use the mixer.

These were interesting and had all of the yummy ingredients, but they're not what I really think of as 'brownie'.  They're OK; I may or may not make them again.

This is favorite of mine and came from my Mother's recipe book.  I believe it was from the 60's or early 70's.  I have been making it for years and always get rave reviews.

I made these 2x, with just a slight variation.  The first time I cut up large marshmallows as I did not have any minis, (no small task I will tell ya - just try and cube big marshmallows...fun, but just a bit, uh, gooey).  The good thing about it was that the marshmallow was a little more predominate in the final outcome. The second time I used the mini's and it came out good and tasty, but if I made them again I will try and freeze the marshmallows first and see if they make little creamy pockets of goodness.  The reason I rated a 3 is that they do seem a little well, low on the wow factor, but maybe with some large nuts and pockets of goodness added we might be on to something. :0)  To be continued...?

These have been my favorite brownies for 18 years now! Growing up my best friends mother made these and I've loved them ever since. I now make these for my own kids who love them too. These are very rich, moist,and flavorful with the butterscotch & marshmallow making them distinctive. Delicious and different. (formerly Aljowa on allrecipes - can't remember my original password.)Note: my original recipe card calls for only 2/3 Cup brown sugar.

The flavor was good, but they turned out completely like a cake, not like brownies at all. fluffy and airy, not chewy or very flavorful.

Oh, dear!  I'm glad I tasted one before everyone else got to them - they were gone in a flash!  I honestly didn't think much of these when just looking at the recipe.  But the finished product was great. I made them once with a brownie mix, and again with a homemade brownie recipe for the base.  Both were wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again.  I only wish my cholesterol level would allow them every day.
