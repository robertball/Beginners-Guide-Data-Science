I made this tonight but chose to use homemade dressing. Fresh basil is key to this recipe to give it a great flavor. Don't use too much or it will overpower the taste. I also used early girl tomatoes out of my garden. Since they were on the small side I used four of them.

Very easy and tates fabulous! I pound my chicken down thin and poke it with a fork a few times before marinating. I do spice up the salad dressing a bit with fresh basil and romemary along with some minced garlic and a generous splash of white wine vinegar. I let this marinate for at least four hours. I never refrigerate the tomatoes and left off the dressing just using a little olive oil vinegar salt and pepper. Once the chicken came off the grill I topped it with the tomato mixture fresh basil and some shredded Parmesan and Romano cheese. Great served wtih "Warm Herb Garlic Bread" from this site.

I'm sorry to say that I did not use Wishbone dressing!!!! I used Good Seasons and used balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I marinated my chicken in this for most of the day and then grilled. For the bruschetta I used very red plum tomatoes that were seeded and fine diced a huge clove of fresh garlic pressed fine diced red onion some sea salt and frsh pepper fresh basil and then I added some more of the Good Seasons balsamic Italian dressing. Delicious combo on the grilled chicken! Everyone loved it. Thanks!

I made about half this recipe for two large boneless skinless chicken breast halves. Before marinating the chicken I seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper and then marinated it for about six hours. The chicken itself was very good and Hubs grilled it to perfection. I made the topping with our garden tomatoes the red onion and fresh basil. For some reason I didn t think the topping was all that flavorful. It definitely needed some salt and pepper but it lacked the pizzazz I was looking for.

ok recipe. I won't be making this again only because my husband won't eat anything with vinegar-ish taste/smell to it.

This was exceptional for a few reasons. First and foremost the ease of the preparation. I had generic zesty italian on hand marinated 1.5 hours. Grilled to perfection the chicken was so moist and flavorful. On an extremely hot summer night it was worth standing by a hot grill. The Brushetta was crisp and refreshing. This was a quick easy refreshing dinner. Second reason I will rave is that I did not feel well yet had to make a nice meal for the family. This will be a keeper in my family and I will pass it on!!

I love robust italian dressing as a marinade but had none at home...so I used my own marinade- with garlic lemon juice red wine marjoram thyme and salt. ( it's a frequent go to). Just before taking my chicken off of the grill- I topped the chicken with round thin slices a vine ripened tomato a sprinkle of garlic salt and thinly sliced strips of fresh basil. My husband doesn't like cheese- so I left it off of his..... but the rest of us had a sprinkle of parm on top of the tomato. ( The thin slices melt onto the chicken- and do not go rolling off )

This was awesome! No other words needed. Followed the recipe exactly except when I flipped the chicken put foil underneath and then the bruschetta topping on top. Absolutely divine.

Very simple and tasty. I like the fact that it had few ingredients. Easy for a large family on a budget. Will definitely be making this again. Don't have to change anything.
