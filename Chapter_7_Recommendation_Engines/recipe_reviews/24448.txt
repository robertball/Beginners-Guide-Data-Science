I have an electric oven so it took the full 25 minutes. I added 1 cup of slivered almonds. The cookie had a great shortbread flavor. Thanks!

These are excellent! I added grated lemon zest (1/2 lemon). It gave it a tinge of lemon hint, yum! I will try grated orange zest next time. These cookies do not spread out and come out like you shape them so be prettier than I was. I didn't space them 2" apart, didn't find the need. Yay! I made shortbread!!  :)

These are delicious!  I also tried this recipe with 1 C dried cranberries and 1 C chopped pecans, and liked those as well!

These are delicious, easy treats! Baked for 20 minutes and they were perfect. Be careful not to over bake as they will harden upon cooling.  I only got 61 cookies out of the recipe. These taste very much like Italian Wedding Cookies.

I baked these for my colleagues and students, and while I thought they were just alright, everyone else seemed to really like them and they were gone very quickly.

I made them to recipe, though I scaled the recipe down to only make two dozen. Though the taste was good, I found that they ended up a little greasier than other shortbread-type cookies I've made. The almond and vanilla flavors were a nice combination. The recipe was super easy, and the time for prep/baking was correct for me.

My housemate said he thought they were like Christmas cookies without the cinnamon (which for him is good because he doesn't like cinnamon), so maybe a nice variant could involve some cinnamon.

These were a good shortbread cookie. They were very dry and crumbly. They have a great flavor. I would consider adding icing to these.  The recipe came together very easily.
