The whole family liked this recipe. I made it a lttle bit more simple.  I roasted the squash till soft, sautéed onions and garlic in a little oil and butter, then added 4 cups of chicken broth and seasonings, salt and pepper to taste.  I then scooped out the squash and added it to the broth and used electric mixer until smooth and added 1 cup of half and half.  I served it with crumbled bacon. Delicious!!

The whole family loved this soup.  My husband and I especially loved it because it was not sweet.  This is the best butternut squash soup I have ever made.  I did puree it with my stick blender because I preferred that texture and wanted a thicker soup.  Also, since I own goats, I make a lot of chevre. I used that instead of the cream cheese, and goat milk instead of the cream.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

I made it this morning.  I did, however, added some fresh nutmeg, I saw Michael Smith do that with his butternut squash soup.  At the end, but before simmering time, I took my immersion blender to it, because my husband & I enjoy a nice smooth soup.

Delicious and healthy too! I added a heaping teaspoon of curry powder to this but otherwise followed the recipe.

A nice, simple recipe to work with!. However, I skipped the olive oil for baking the squash and used it instead of the butter to sauté the garlic. I used 1 tsp onion powder instead of the onion (I had run out) but I think a 1/2 tsp would have been fine. I also used a whole sweet potato instead of the carrots. And for a lower fat, no cholesterol version, I used a half-cup of Almond milk instead of the heavy cream and cream cheese; I blended it all to create a creamy texture.

When reheating this I added some browned breakfast sausage and cooked basmati rice -- a tasty full meal!

IT's a great base recipe but its really bland. I added in (lots) of garlic salt, a little nutmeg, and about a tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning and it made it awesome!

I made one substitution. I didn't have cream and I used 2% milk. I like the puréed butternut squash soup but this one is a keeper and I will make it again.

I am not a fan of pumpkin so I can easy seeing me make this as a fall forward kind of dish. I didn't follow directions to a T. I steamed the carrots whole and then cut them up when they were soft before adding them in with the onion, garlic, and butter. Also I added some other spices to it. Basil. Sage, Cumin, Nutmeg, and Parsley. Not too much of each, maybe a pinch or two. I really enjoy rich savory flavors so this seemed like a good choice to my nose. To make sure everything was blended well I took a beater and whipped it all together for about a minute. The end result was GREAT! You could taste each component all at once. It was a very pleasant experience.

This was really good.  It was thick and had some texture to it......I pretty much followed the recipe but added a touch more garlic and salt.  I used low fat half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I also added a couple of shakes of hot sauce when I served it.

This is the best tasting butternut squash soup I have ever had or made and I've made and had PLENTY! I'm raving about it right now and calling myself the "Master Chef" to my husband! I followed the recipe EXACTLY but used a food processor to chop the onions, garlic, and carrots separately during the process. It came out very chunky and I like it both ways, chunky and pureed and smooth. This was soft tiny chunks and I loved it. So did my husband and my 17 month old daughter!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was really bland.  I made it for a friend of mine who is sick and  is only eating bland food, so it worked out OK for me.  I am just not sure how to enhance the flavor.

I liked it. A lot actually. My issue with this soup has always been the sweetness so I didn't add carrot. Followed almost exactly except the seasonings. Roasted the squash with butter olive oil. Then just started seasoning with every spicy thing I had :) curry powder, chili salt and about a tonne of pepper. Required a lot of tasting but that wasn't really a chore! 1/4 cup cream cheese and slightly more than a 1/4 c heavy cream. Ran an immersion blended through it cause I like smooth. It is a watery soup but you could lower the chicken stock.

Good base recipe, but bland as written. I took a reviewer's advice and added a teaspoon of curry powder, and that helped a lot.

loved this soup, excellent flavour. I added to stalks of chopped celery, and I used light cream instead of heavy cream..
