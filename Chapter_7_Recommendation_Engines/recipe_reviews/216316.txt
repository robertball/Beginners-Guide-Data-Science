Instead of the can soup, used 1/2 package of onion soup mix (minus the flakes) added to 10 oz of water. Used 1 1/2 tbsp capers--no anchovies.  Remove chicken, deglaze pan with white wine, add the remainer ingredients and return chicken. Before serving, thicken with Wondra  Serve w/orzo.  Brown in oil then add the remaining soup mix with 10 oz of water, and a can of chicken broth.

This was really good, but I think I'm going to half the capers next time (like previous reviewer) because it came out a bit too salty for us.  I'm excited to try it again because with less salt it's going to be delicious!  Next time I'm going to try rinsing the olives as well..if it's still is too salty I may buy tomatoes without added salt.

I left out the anchovy paste and it was still very good.

The adults loved this!  The kids ate it without complaining, which is good enough for me.  I left out the olives and anchovy paste and there was still plenty of flavor.  Served with rice.

Good flavor, not the flavors my family usually goes for but it was liked by all, even the picky one.  I made the recipe almost as written.  I used 1 teaspoon of anchovy paste and 1 tablespoon capers.  Really fast to make which means that I will be making this again but not weekly.

I would either drain the tomatoes, or only use half the condensed French onion soup. The sauce did not reduce significantly in the amount of cooking time given. Still tasty.

Halved capers and anchovy paste for salt concerns. Added zucchini and mushrooms and served over penne to make it one dish meal for the fam. Have also tried it with shrimp in place of chicken, which made it a dish fit for company.
