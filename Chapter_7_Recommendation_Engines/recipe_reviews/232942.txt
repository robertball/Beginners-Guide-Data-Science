The only "change" I made was I didn't put it in a blender .  I put all the ingredients in a jar and shook it to mix everything.  Easy to make and tastes pretty good.

15 June 2016 - Used agave instead of honey and a mix of  vinegars:  white, apple cider and balsamic.  I added a bit more vinegar and agave  as it tasted a bit too oily for me.  Also used a small chunk of fresh onion.   Blended to emulsify, delicious.

This was good, but I discovered I prefer sugar as the sweetener rather than honey.

This was one of two salad dressings I made for our tossed salad on Christmas Day, 2017. It wasn't as creamy as what I had hoped, but was still tasty. Next time, I may reduce the volume of poppy seeds. It might have been just slightly on the tart side, which is easily fixable.

I AM IN LOVE!!!  This is one of the best dressings I've ever tasted and it was so easy to make with ingredients I already had on hand!

I did not have any honey so I used 1/4 cup of sugar. This is simple to make. Tastes delicious.  No need to buy expensive, prepared salad dressing from the store.

So yummy! I followed the recipe but didnâ€™t have honey and used coconut sugar instead. Loved it just the way it is!

I made this exactly as written and poured it over a big bowl of fruit salad, let it marinate and thoroughly enjoyed!   It's a wonderfully light dressing that let's the fruit shine through.

This is my new favourite dressing for Spinach salad. We love it. I used half the amount of honey and it was sweet enough for us. I make this once a week.
