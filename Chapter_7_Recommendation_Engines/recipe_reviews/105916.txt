Normally I make buttermilk pancakes, but these are so easy and good, I think I'll make them more. This recipe makes great thick and fluffy pancakes that turn a nice light brown color. They are terribly easy to make (no butter to melt)and taste really good. I just used a canola oil spray instead of the actual oil in the pan.

Very good. By the way the name sounded i thought they were just going to be simple like  "tastes like pancakes outa the box" kind of pancakes, but these were good. Will make these again. Thank u.

These pancakes were delicious--just what I was looking for with simple ingredients that are usually on-hand.  The pancakes were very fluffy and just slightly sweet.  The best part was that I refridgerated left over batter the and pancakes came out just as well two days later!

These pancakes were great tasting and super easy to make.  My six year old pretty much made them herself.  We added chocolate chips to the batter and the kids loved them.  We had a lot left over so I made them and froze them to use on a later date.  I just popped them in the microwave for 45 seconds and they were just as good as the first time around!

A little disappointed with these.  The batter looked great, very silky and the pancakes looked perfect but the taste was only so-so.  Having said that my kids really enjoyed helping out and they were pretty simple to prepare.

Delicious and very easy to make. The pancakes turned out very cakey and rather heavy than a "normal" pancake. This recipe is good and healthy but not for those who like their pancakes light and airy.

Good old fashioned pancakes.  Tasty and easy to make.  The 12 serving size made about 10 pancakes, more than enough for 2 people.
