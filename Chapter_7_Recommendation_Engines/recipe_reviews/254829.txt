Instead of rolling the chicken and then putting the marinade on, I marinaded the chicken first and then rolled it so that all sides of the chicken would absorb the flavor. This was really good. I think it was a tad bit heavy on the parsley so I would definitely cut back on that next time but that is the only change I would make.
