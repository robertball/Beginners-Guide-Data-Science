I cut this recipe in half, just in case it wasn't a hit with the kids. I followed the recipe exact. I made each kid a bowl this morning, using 1/4 cup of water and microwaving it for a minute and a half. The kids really liked it. This would be a great base recipe to play with and make it personal to your own family.

This has a pretty strong flavor, but that's just the way my son likes it. With the instant store bought ones, he uses three packets and a tiny bit of water in order to keep the flavor (way too dry for me). You can imagine how quickly he was going through the packets. Sorry, but I did make a minor change which does not negate yours - I skipped the instant milk and used whole milk rather than water to make it. Now just need to figure out other flavor mixtures like the maple and brown sugar.
