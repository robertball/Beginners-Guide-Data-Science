I didn't make the crust from scratch, used a store bought crust.   This pie has a heavy ginger taste, so next time I will add a little nutmeg and a little more cinnamon (just a personal preference).   I love the honey addition, but I have a serious sweet tooth, and next time I will add a little sugar in addition to the honey.  Good recipe, thanks.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made and eaten.  I have read others reviews who stated it wasn't sweet enough and needed to add extra sugar.  I disagree, this pie is very sweet.  I used creamed honey instead of liquid honey and maybe that made the difference, but any more sweetness and it would've been too much.  I did add in some extra all spice and nutmeg as that is my taste.

This pie was smoother than any other pumpkin pie I've  had.  My husband is british, and has never tried pumpkin pie.  He liked it so much he asked me to make it again this week - so for him I'm giving it a kid friendly rating of "5"

Tastes just like pumpkin pie, except with the fresh pumpkin flavor. I am not very good with pastries but even the crust turned out very good! I might keep that recipe for other pies. I added a dash of nutmeg, because it just goes well with pumpkin. The whip cream was perfect, nice suttle flavor that just complimented the pie nicely

This recipe seemed interesting...with the honey and ginger and all, and when i made it, it turned out perfect. H

However, I dont think it was very sweet. My normal pumpkin pie tastes very good and just sweet enough, but this one seemed to lack that sweetness.  The ginger-honey whipped cream was very good and added some sweetness, but I think I might stick to my pie with  the added whipped cream idea.

This is a great pumpkin pie.  I used the recipe to make 2 pies instead of one - which was a mistake.  Next time I will make just one fat pie!
Thanks!

This is an interesting pie. We love pumpkin pie at this house. The pie itself is fantastic, the whipped cream is to die for and the crust is good and flaky. But, the only problem was the crust. It fell apart on me. It was cold and it still fell apart. But it is worth it. This pie is deliscious.

This was the first pumpkin pie I've ever made.  It was easy and popular with my guests (even the ones who don't like pumpkin pie).  I found the recipe lacking a few spices though, next time, I'll add some nutmeg and allspice.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't use the Honey ginger cream, but will definately give it a try.  The crust was great and simple too. This is the crust that I use on all my pies now.  No waiting for it to chill is my favorite part.  This is a holiday keeper

This is such a great recipe! Some of you said it wasn't sweet enough without the whipped cream, and I worried it wouldn't taste good. But with the three-fourths cup of honey in there and the spices, it tastes very sweet I think. And I didn't have the cream to make and I love it without it!
 This is my first time ever making a pumkin pie and I made it from the actual pumkin too, not canned, and I love it!

This pie is fine-- it's not amazing. The filling didn't set up as much as I like and I baked it for an extra 15 minutes before I took it out because I thought it was getting a bit dark.

This is probably one of the easiest and tastiest pumpkin pies I've ever had.  I made one for a party where there was plenty of food and sweets and it was gone in record time.  The honey ginger cream is to die for!

My great grandmother, who left us at the age of 101 in 1980, use to make this pie but she didn't call it pilgrim pie. The crust is awesome.  I rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper and forgot to flour it so I had to do it again and it was just as flaky as the apple pie I made with the crust.  I altered the pumpkin recipe as I added 12oz of vanilla spiced old southern comfort egg nog instead of the milk and I used agave nectar in place of the honey as there are a few people who are diabetics and this has a low glyscemic  index for them.  I also used it in the dough. None of my family could tell that I didn't use any sugar or honey in the recipe and they loved it.  It turned out to be a very creamy pie I also use the pie filling and made a custard for those who don't like crust with their pies. It also turned out very good.

I didn't make the crust-i did store bought. I added some extra sugar as suggested by some to make it sweeter. Next time I will diefinitely not add extra sugar--it was too sweet. I thought that the texture was fabulous!  yum- very smooth.  will make again. honey whipped cream was also tasty. very impressed.

I served this pie for our Thanksgiving Desert and it disappeared pretty quickly.  I loved the smooth velvety texture.  I did think that the whipped cream was too sweet and will only use 1/8 cup next time.   My cousin who "doesn't like pumpkin pie" had seconds! :)  I will definitely make this again.

This pie was amazing. I used a crust recipe that my mom taught me years ago...I couldn't find evaporated milk here in Germany, so I used condensed milk. The result was still delicious. Some reviewers have stated that the pie wasn't sweet enough, but I was extremely happy with the sweetness--enough to remind you that it's dessert, not so much that your teeth hurt. Germans, French, and Australians alike were impressed with this American classic! And I'll certainly make it again with the whipped cream--the honey and ginger gave it that extra something. We also added the whipped cream to coffee for an added treat.

Great pumpkin pie... with an actual pumpkin flavor.

The pie itself is not as sweet as a lot of pumpkin pies, as has been noted by the other reviewers... however, this is with reason!  

With the very sweet special whipped cream atop it, the pie is amazing.  

If you aren't having the cream, move to a different pie recipe.  

I was impressed when I had the cream with the pie... I sampled it ahead of time and was worried, but the flavor blends perfectly with the pie... waayyy better than regular whipped cream if you're having it with pumpkin pie!

I don't usually enjoy pumpkin dishes, but this is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had.  I think it is the honey that makes all the difference.  I make it often now with homemade puree and my family loves it.

One word: DELICIOUS.  I prepared my own pumpkin puree, by boiling the pumpkin - big mistake as the puree was quite soupy.  Never-the-less, I added 5 Tbsp cornstarch and simmered for over an hour being careful not to scortch.  I added only about 6 oz of evaporated milk to the mix and added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and allspice.  I also increased the bake time by 13 minutes and HOORAY i got a solid beautiful, delicious pie! Next time though I may reduce the honey and some spices by a pinch as it was quite pungent.  Also, I used butter in place of shortening for the crust and it came out well; watch the amount of salt though.

Good pumpkin pie recipe.  It was finished off after Thanksgiving dinner. 
The ginger/honey whipped cream is a nice addition for those who
want a spoonful on their pie.

Awesome. Doubled the recipe and made 2 pies and crusts. Used half honey, half sugar because I didn't want to use all of my expensive honey in one recipe. The pie dough is very sticky so be sure to use the advice of another reviewer and roll between 2 sheets of cling wrap for better handling. Yummm!

Very cooperative crust and filling. It is a perfectly classic pumpkin pie (which I will use the recipe for in the future). There was no "wow-factor" that caused non-pumpkin lovers to suddenly like it, but that's ok. The only thing I didn't like was the whipped cream. Was too sweet and I could not taste the ginger at all. I might try cinnamon next time, but will definately omit the honey. Anyway, thanks a lot for sharing and happy thanksgiving! PS if you don't have vinnegar, use lemon juice for the crust.

I know this recipe! I've used it for years! I have made a few adjustments to improve to my liking. First off, I use about 2x the amount of spice that the recipe calls for(I like my pumpkin pie spicy and full of flavor). I also add about a tsp or so of nutmeg. I add an extra 3/4 cup of the pumpkin puree. I find that it makes the filling a little thicker and meatier in texture, but doesn't compromise the smoothness. With my adjustments, I think it turns out great. At Thanksgiving, I always make an extra pie for my brother to take home because one slice just isn't enough for him!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I was at first concerned about the consistency of the filling. I added an extra 1/2 cup of pumpkin into the mix. It just looked too watery. However, I did use a sugar pumpkin that I baked; not a canned puree. Because of this, I did have to bake for an additional 15 minutes. I did this in 5 minute intervals, each time checking to see if the center was still giggling from a liquid state. 
Also, although it was great to have the whipped topping, I believe it took away from the flavor of the pie, and preferred to taste the pie itself, which was wonderful. Over all this is a great recipe.

This pie overall is good, the sweetness suits the amount of spices added to the pie,when using honey use less condensed milk [1-1/3 cup],if you use exact it tends to become a pudding on a crust [still good] if you use sugar use all of the condensed milk. With honey:****1/2 With sugar:***** Great pie recipe if you have an older oven than 2006 the you'll need to bake it kinda longer.newer oven have better sealing.if your using a convectional oven go 5-15 degree's lower. Its better to use a oven thermometer [hand-held] than the ones that already come in the oven. The pie still settles good,no problems with it if you use the exact measurements,very good pie for starters Do this pie if your looking for something quick.

My husband and I made four pies with this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner.  Over the years I have never really liked pumpkin pie but, this recipe has changed my mind. We added a little molasses while blending the filling mixture which gave the pie a little extra kick!  This is especially good with a scoop of ice cream. Try this one!

This was such a good pumpkin pie, I changed the spices because I didn't have them all.  It must be the honey, but I will never make pumpkin pie any other way from now on!

What a wonderful recipe!  I have to rave about it all.  The crust recipe in this was amazing and I will use it for all my pies now.  The honey/ginger whipped cream was great too, my husband loved it!  This is a must make recipe!

The crust is the best pie crust recipe. Also made an apple and a strawberry/cherry pie and with both the crust was perfect. The honey really makes the pumpkin pie recipe.  I also added 1/2 cup brown sugar to sweeten it up.

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner for a family that has never had pumpkin pie, in the hopes of impressing them.  Unfortunately, no one liked it aside from myself.  Personally, I felt that the honey did add a little something extra, but whatever it was I felt that it detracted from the pumpkin flavour. I cooked the pie in a gas oven for almost an hour and a half as it did not want to set, and I pre-baked the crust (although I'm not sure that was the best idea, but it came out alright). I did not like the whipped topping on the pie at all (although it went well in our coffee!)  The recipe was alright, but I will not be making it again.

Wow!  This pie is good!  My family doesn't really like pumpkin pie, but I thought I would try to make on from a pumpkin that was given to me from a friend.  My family ate the whole pie in one day!   I used all the honey and I added about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.

I made this for this past Thanksgiving and was super impressed.  It turned out great and I loved the lightly flavored whipped cream.  I am not that experienced with pie crust making and it turned out a bit sticky for me, not allowing me to roll it.  I ended up just pressing it into my pie dish, but it still turned out great! This will forever be my pumpkin pie recipe!

On my next run through I would make the crust as well as the pie filling a little sweeter, it came out on the bitter side.  The whipped cream however was amazing, I will be using that in other recipies.

This recipe is absolutely fool-proof. The crust is the best, flakiest and easiest crust to make, and the pie filling is just delicious. I find the filling is a little much to fill a 9" pan, and instead use an 11" ceramic pan I got from my gramma. More pie for everyone!

This is awesome! We love it! We use cream instead of evaporated milk and sugar instead of honey. We reduce the sugar when using store-bought pie crust but otherwise leave the same. Thanks for this recipe!

I've made this several times and each time it gets better. If you want to use store brought pastry I would suggest wrapping foil around the edges for 1/2 the baking time depending on your oven temp. variables. I used my Jack-o-lantern from Halloween carved it up and baked it in the oven face side down in an inch or so of water, and then scooped the insides. I used a Magic Bullet to blend small batches (no need to strain) and froze 2c in each bag. Some of my batches when unfrozen seemed watery so I simmered on low for 20mins or so to get the water out before mixing in the ingredients for the pie filing. Also the honey ginger cream is a nice addition. Brings out the favors in the pie.

This pie is wonderful.  I like pumpkin puree from a can just fine, but if you want an extra treat (with a little extra effort), try baking your own pumpkins--this recipe works great for that.  I used my own pie crust recipe and added a little nutmeg, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I liked that it wasn't quite as sweet as the recipe on the pumpkin can... the honey taste was amazing!

This pie is INCREDIBLE. I baked it with the Best Pie Crust recipe on this site and got more compliments than I've ever gotten on any recipe (and I cook and bake a LOT!). Next time I will go easy on the spices so that the pumpkin flavor is more present. A must on your Thanksgiving table!

I made this pie as a "test" for Thanksgiving.  Great recipe.  I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie but the rest of the family is.  This pie changed my mind.  That being said, it's the only one I will make from here on out.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and subbed a half-pint of heavy cream the second, and both times the flavor was good but the texture was loose, watery, and slightly grainy.  I baked at a lower temperature the second time, but got the same result.

Tried this yesterday for today's Thanksgiving dinner. Got half way through the recipe opened the pumpkin and realized that OOpps it's not pumpkin puree it's premade pie filling. So I made the premade filling pie then and this one the next day. The premade was so bad we threw it away and this only was everyone's top choice. We didn't even cut open our apple pie. Made my own pie crust and tried the topping but my cream didn't whip very well. I'll give the cream another try cause I will certainly be making this again.

This is a very good pumpkin pie recipe. I like the taste of the honey in the recipe. The whipped cream is really good too.

I was very impressed on how relatively easy this recipe was. Very yummy! I used my own crust base using wholemeal flour which gave the pie an added texture. Well done. I will definately be making this one again and again

Heavenly!  It melts in your mouth, everything about it is amazing.  I really like how this recipe has the crust and whipped cream recipes with it as well.  It has been a huge hit any time I've made it.

Very yummy!  I used half honey, half white sugar.  The whipped cream needs extra ginger and honey, as is it doesn't have much flavor.

Everyone has their own personal taste. Followed the directions using fresh pumpkin and it was dang near perfect. Added a pinch more spices for my tastes. Easy, quick and the honey makes it taste like it’s from a farm stand. Highly recommend this recipe!

Nothing but rave reviews from friends, family, and coworkers. This is a very smooth and flavorful pie. You can really taste all the ingredients and making your own crust is well worth the time and effort. Homemade crust and whipping cream makes this pie incredible. Used organic pie filling and spices.

Crust recipe was nice.  Felt like there was just something a little off or missing with the actual pie.  Didn't like the Honey Ginger Cream as much as I thought I would.  Maybe it was just too much ginger?

I was really excited to try this recipe, I liked the idea of using honey with my fresh pumpkin puree. I have to say I was disappointed with the flavor. The pie came out beautiful in color and texture but lacked flavor. I'll be returning to my old recipe.

My husband and I were blessed to be able to spend Thanksgiving in the beautiful Pacific Northwest with my sister and her husband so used her always wonderful pie crust. I added a bit of nutmeg to the recipe otherwise followed it to the letter and it was an amazing pumpkin pie. This will be my go to recipe from here on out.

I am on a low carb, low sugar diet.  So I add one egg, reduce the honey as low as possible, and spray a pie tin with coconut oil, and do not use a crust.  It is a great tasting treat for someone trying to stick to a high protein, low carb, no white flour diet.

Great recipe.  Made it to the T and it looks incredible. I cooked it for 65 minutes total since  it was pretty thick in the pie plate I used and the crust on pumpkin pie tends to have issues fully baking in the center. Judge by the firmness of the filling and color of of the crust.

this recipe was fantastic, I only changed a couple of things, doubled the honey and the spices(because I like my spice). I also used hubbard squash from my garden. The crust was wonderful. I will use this recipe from now on.

I've used a frozen pie shell, so I'll comment only on the filling and whipped cream. First of all there was too much for a deep pie shell. And secondly, although I baked the pie extra 15 minutes, it wouldn't set. I had to take it out because it was getting too dark. I also added a 1/4tsp of nutmeg due to personal preference of spices in my pumpkin pie. Maybe my pie didn't set because I used rice and almond milk. Well, we still ate the "soupy" pie. I must say that it was too sweet. Next time I'll reduce the amount of milk and honey.
I did make the whipping cream, but I put a lot less honey. It was a really good addition to the pie: not as bland as plain whipped cream; more like a really light frosting. It's worth making with lesser amount of honey.

I used pumpkin butter that I made as the base for this pie and this was AMAZING! The pie was super smooth and perfectly flavored; what I should do is create my own recipe on this website using pumpkin butter as the base for pie because this was a really great idea!! I skipped out on all the spices since they were already in my pumpkin butter. After everything was mixed up, it seemed very runny (more runny than normal pumpkin pie filling) so I added about 1/4 cup of whipped cream and that did the trick! I used a pre-made frozen crust since I had slaved for hours over the pumpkin butter already...but this pie was REALLY yummy! I will definitely make it again. The whipped cream with honey and ginger was a nice compliment to the pie.

This is super easy!  We tested it out last night, and it was wonderful.  However, no topping.  I made the topping for Thanksgiving, it was good, then I added cinnimon!  This made the topping to die for!  I did use a premade crust because I have never had any luck with homemade crusts.  The only reason a 4 and not a 5.

I only used this recipe for the filling. I had a pre-made pie crust that I needed to use and I didn't have the necessary ingredients for the whipped cream.  

I ran out of honey, so I used half honey and half sugar and it was just right.  I also cut the ginger in half and added about a half teaspoon nutmeg.  

Both my husband and I loved it and since I have enough puree for two more pies, I'm sure I'll be making this again.

This pie is the best I have ever eaten!!  I love that it is a little healthier version with the honey.  It looked beautiful, as well.  The only thing I didn't do was the crust, I had already started my own recipe.  I may try the crust next time.  Definitely a keeper!

This was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!  The honey was great and the gingered whip cream made a great addition to the whole thing!!

I have always made pumpkin pie from the canned pumpkin recipe, but wanted a better pie for Thanksgiving this year. This pie was delicious! I didn't make the cream topping but just used cool-whip, it was still great. Very creamy! This will definitely be my Thanksgiving pumpkin pie every year! Yum!

Thanks for an awesome recipe! I love that this is sweetened naturally with honey. Having never made a pumpkin pie before, I was afraid that the batter was too liquidy, so I added an extra egg, which worked fine. I used a 9-1/2 inch pie pan and was glad I did because the filling would have been too much for a 9 inch pan. I baked it for a while longer than suggested in the recipe, but it came out perfectly in the end.

This is the same recipe I got from my mother. My daughter-in-law never liked pumpkin pie until she tried this one. One year, she was pregnant at Thanksgiving time and all she asked for was her own pumpkin pie. She ate the whole pie herself! My grandsons love it too!

Oh My!  This pie is good.  Fern is right!  I don't know what makes it so different, but it really is smooth and good!  The crust is by far the easiest and yummiest recipe I have found.  I will now use it for all my pies and will always make this pumpkin pie for the holidays.  I did add some nutmeg, other than that followed recipe exactly.
