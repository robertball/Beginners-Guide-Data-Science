Great "road map" of a buttercream recipe, easily manipulated to accomodate any and all of your buttercream needs whether it's for cookies, cupcakes, or decorating.  Thicker, thinner, more butter, all shortening, play with this till you get it to suit you. In this case I reduced the almond flavor by half and it was just the perfect hint of almond.  Overdo it and the flavor is unpleasant and overbearing. I wanted this frosing to pipe onto cupcakes so I nearly doubled the powdered sugar called for and addded half and half until I got the thicker consistency I wanted.

Not only good on cookies, but great on special occasion cakes.  Make it al little stiff and you can create decorative flowers and borders with this recipe.   Linda Carver-Hereford,Texas

I didn't really use shortening.. I just cut it out of the recipe and used whipping cream instead of milk.. it worked really good..

This is delicious, but do not expect it to harden on the cookies!  It remains the consistency of a light fluffy cake icing.  Colors well, and is addictive.

I have been using Wilton's recipe for icing since I took a class on cake decorating. The base of this recipe is similar, but adds flavor. The butter makes it creamier and the almond adds flavor so it doesn't taste too sweet.

I liked this recipe, I have used it several times. Although I made a few adjustments which came out way better. I used a stick of butter and a stick of criso butter flavored shortening.You would wanna beat the butter and shortening for at least 20 min. seems long but it's totally worth it. You won't taste that butter after taste! That's the main key. I used 8 cups of powdered sugar to make it thick but added more almond extract and a tsp. of vanilla extract so it wont be to sweet and lose itself in the sugar and focus on the main purpose of ALMOND BUTTER ICING!!!!! (Remember Beat the butter and shortening for 20 mins. it will taste way better! and if it's to thick for your taste and milk!)

I wasn't too crazy about this...it tasted too "buttery" and I wonder how healthy it can be with that much shortening and butter.  And it didn't harden for cookies so they all smeared when I tried to stack them and put them away.

Just what I was looking for. Easy, with just enough flavor. I used it to frost a white cake for a birthday party. It made plenty for a two layer cake, and extra to dye for contrast piping. It would be even better for decorating if you sub half the shortening for butter. I didn't add as much extract to it, almond extract tends to overpower things really easily, so I just added to taste, about 3/4 tsp. I have a new go-to cake frosting. I can't imagine using this for cookies, though, it would smear badly. Thanks DeDe!

I used a fourth of this recipe with only a stick of butter. I used 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla. It generously frosted 12 cupcakes!

i changed this recipe to fit what i had on hand, i can't comment on the original (but it sounds good!)... i used 1/2c butter, 1/2pkg cream cheese, 1/2 tsp almond, 1 tsp vanilla bean extract. mix together in blender (about 3c). add sugar, 1/2 cup at a time until you get the right consistency. i tried to add milk, but it gets grainy. sweet, with a mild almond flavor. sooo tasty! great on cake-like cookies.

Being an almond extract fan, I knew I was going to love the flavor of this icing.  It is a little on the greasy side, and I would probably opt to reduce the shortening when I make it again.  I used this to top golden cakes from this site, which also have almond extract, and the combination was amazing.

I used this recipe for cupcake frosting and it turned out GREAT!  However, since I am not an almond fan, I substitued one tsp of vanilla in place of the almond extract and it really turned out well.  As one of the other reviewers said, I can't really picture using it on cookies, as the consistency was perfect for cupcakes (or sheet cakes), but perhaps if you added more milk as you went along it would be easier to pipe onto cookies...

Nice recipe. I too used less almond extract (1 tsp). I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and used all butter, except for 1/2 c of shortening.  I iced buttersotched cupcakes with it and it was great!

I used all butter. Shortening has a flavor that I can immediately taste in any recipe (same with cooking oils) What's wrong with good old butter? I whipped it with my whisk attachment until it was light and fluffy. This made the difference! The almond extract could be reduced just a smidge. You can always add more!  Just a note about the 'drying' properties. It sets so that it isnt "messy" to the touch. It does get a dry top, but the body of it stays yummy and creamy. So, no, dont stack your sugar cookies...but I would use this recipe in a heartbeat for sugar cookie frosting.

This icing is amazing - creamy and tasty!  I started using this recipe about 25 years ago when I did cake decorating.  Now I use it on sugar cookies when we decorate cookies for the holidays.  Try it!

This is the very first frosting that I was able to make (using the instructions of course) that actually came out at the consistency I was looking for.  Thanks.  I think it it could handle a little more almond extract though.  Thanks DeDe!

Great flavor! I read where someone complained about it not hardening up, but that is nothing a little refigeration can't fix. Thanks for the recipe!

to make any frosting harden up some, you can add meringue powder to your mixture. On the back of the can it tells how much to add to your frosting mixture. I use the powder alot when frosting cookies, they don't stick together then. You can also use it on cakes.

The icing was delicious but didn't harden like sugar cookie icing should, they were very hard to store without messing up the icing.
