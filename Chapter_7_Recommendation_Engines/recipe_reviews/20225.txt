My whole family just love it!! Instead of using jar of dried beef I just use 8oz. thin slices of beef lunchmeat "Budding" and it a lot cheaper!! Not salty at all and you don't even have to rinse!! You must try it and believe me, you won't be disappointed!!!!

Just like moms, minus the pepper and her beef came out of a bag.  TIP: If you find this dish too salty, soak the beef in cold water for about 10 minutes, and drain.  Try a piece, if its still too salty, soak in fresh water for 10 more minutes.

Comfort Food!  Once I got the roux down (it took 2 tries), it was fantastic.  I added the ceyenne pepper, seasoned salt and cracked black pepper. We used the Budding Luncheon Meat. Served it on toasted potato bread buns.  I bet it would be great on biscuts!  The boys scarfed them down faster than I could serve them.  Goes down well with a BIG glass of cold MILK!

I LOVE Chipped Beef (we call it Chipped Beefy at our house, for whatever reason). This recipe is fine but it's missing the CRUCIAL step of rising off the dried beef in hot water before adding to the roux. You can always add more salt later, but you can't take it out! Pour some hot water over the dried beef and let it soak for a few minutes. Then, rinse the dried beef with hot water. In fact, rinse it twice! Rinse it with cold water after that, then squeeze and chop up. 

To avoid lumps the easy way, add the beef to the roux after it's done browning BEFORE you add the milk!. Trust me on this. I've made this recipe since I was 10. Then, add the milk and keep stirring. I think because the beefy brings down the temperature of the roux, you avoid cooking it and it becoming lumpy before it is incorporated into the milk. (which is really the only challenge with this easy recipe)

Also, at our house, we always added a touch of Dijon Mustard at the end, which adds a note of complexity to the roux. (incidentally, the more browned the roux, the "nuttier" the flavor. just don't burn it. then it'll be bitter.)

You can always let the individual diner salt, mustard or cayenne their own slice. 

Oh! And my favorite toast to serve this on is whatever is the cheapest Wonderbread-y bread that is at your grocery store. 

Now I'm super hungry for some Chipped Beefy!!

It's funny that the recipe says that SOS stands for "Same Ole Stuff".  That's the nice version but not the original.  It's really "S*** On a Shingle" and the first word isn't "Stuff".  That's what the military has been calling it since way before my time.  My mom just called it "Creamed beef" but even she knew what it was really called.  She was just too polite to use the real name. ;~}

  My mom used to make this with browned hamburger from time to time.  Now I'm the one who does all of the cooking for my wife and two kids and I seem to be the only one who loves it.  I use browned hamburger and a little minced onion and just use the fat from the hamburger to cook the onion and make the roux. Just sprinkle the flour over the cooked hamburger and onion and cook a bit.  Then whisk in the milk.  I add lots of black pepper and sometimes a splash of worcestershire sauce.  It's good over toast but even better over buttermilk biscuits.  It's basically the same recipe as sausage gravy but with beef instead.

Serious comfort food for me but it's also seriously low brow cuisine.  Add a little chopped parsley if you want to pretend it's fancy.  I was a chef in some pretty nice restaurants for years but I still love the back woods, low brow, peasant food like this.  Makes me want to whip up a batch right now!

If this recipe is too salty for you, just boil the chipped beef in a little water for a few minutes, then drain off the water, which will take some the salt away with it.

I was surprised at how easy this recipe was. At first i was concerned that there was too much beef for the recipe but it turned out perfect! It is rare to find a creamed chipped beef recipe that is thick - this is it! i would like a little more flavor but i dont know what else to add. I love the cayenne but i feel like there could be another spice that i am not thinking of. Anyway it was great and i would definitely recommend this recipe just as it is!

I figured out that I have to almost double the sauce recipe. I still only use one jar of dried beef, but with more sauce, it's not as salty. Though it is definitely something that you can make quickly for everyone to eat. We make all the time.

This recipe is G-R-E-A-T!!!  If yours turned out too salty, you probably used the jarred dried beef and should have RINSED it first.  We used fresh dried beef from our local locker.  Even my EXTREMELY picky 13 year old daughter and 5 year old son LOVE this stuff...and ask for it on a regular basis!

I used as someone else had suggested deli meat(Italian beef from Cub Foods)and it was awesome...We served over hash brown patties(for those that are not big bread eaters)...Next time I'll need to double the recipe...it was gone in one sitting.

My husband loved it, my 12 year old son declared it his "favorite meal", and we all wished I'd made more.
The funny thing is-after reading the reviews, I boiled the jarred dried beef a minute, then rinsed it off...then we all had to ADD salt (and pepper) to our portion...Go Figure!

Fantastic, my husband loved it. Just what I was looking for. I mixed about 2/3 of the milk and the rest was cream. Also a great base to add extra's to taste

You will have more flavor if  you tear up the beef into large bite size pieces, saute in the butter for a bit and then add the flour and milk.

My mom always made this when I was a little girl and I've made it for my family for years.   I start out with parkay margarine (it has more flavor than butter).  I melt that and then stir in my beef.  My favorite is to get it from a deli but that is usually not possible so buddig beef in the packages is the next best thing.   I mix that with the parkay until lightly brown.    I pour the milk into my tupperware gravy maker and add the flour and shake.   I pour this mixture over top of the beef and butter and cook until heated and slightly thick.    It is so much easier than trying to mix the flour and butter.

I have been making Chipped Beef for years and I learned from watching my mother.  I don't use a written recipe but I use the dried beef in the jar.  I cut the beef into small pieces and saute it in the butter a few minutes so that the beef flavor escapes into the butter and then I add the flour and milk.  You can also add a small amount of beef bullion granules.  This recipe is even better if you make it the day before you plan to eat it! Great comfort food!

This is a good recipe which I used except for the cayenne-I used black pepper instead. But over the years I tweaked it. Melt the butter in the pan, then put shredded dried beef in the butter. Let it sizzle on medium heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring often. It will develop a better flavor by doing that - and give it more of a chew factor. Then add the flour, stir until 'roux' develops, add the milk and (just) pepper (no salt necessary. simmer till thickened and bubbly. You can also throw in a small can of drained baby peas (or frozen) - like a half cup; and if you like mushrooms, toss some (canned, drained) of those in also. I personally like it over biscuits instead of toast.

Just seeing this listed, brought back many memories of my mom, opening up that tiny jar of either Hormel or Armour Chipped Beef.  A dish that she prepared several times a year. I too would rinse off the excess salt, tastes have changed and so has the information about too much sodium; back when I was a little boy, there was not that much processed food around and the amount of salt that was used to cure this chipped beef wasn't much of an issue--however today, that is not the case.
A great, American, comfort food item and like some of the other respondents, I was in the military and this was called by a name that doth not be listed here.

OK - if the beef isn't swimming in the cream sauce, you've done it wrong.  If the toast isn't completely covered in sauce, you've done it wrong.  If you can eat it with your fingers, you've done it wrong.  If you only put it on toast, you are missing out.  Try it over your hash browns, or scrambled eggs, or both.

S**T on a Shingle. Dad hates it as he had it every day in the service. Mom made it for us. Originally it was canned or bagged chipped meat/beef, milk gravy and toasted white bread. No curry or cayenne at all. Only salt and black pepper. And BTW, milk gravy IS made with a roux, which is just a fancy French way of telling you to cook off the butter/flour mixture to get full flavor before adding the milk. Oh and FORGET THE MERLOT! Try a cold dark beer, that will stand up to the salt in the meat. Also really good over egg noodles.

Try scooping out a baked potato, mixing the potato with the chipped beef mixture (sans cayenne pepper for me).  Then fill the potato shell, put grated cheddar cheese on top and warm in oven until cheese melts.

This was so simple and so good. I used the Budding sliced beef and it was not salty at all. My husband liked it alot. I made to much so we were going to have leftovers the next day for lunch - BIG mistake because this does not reheat well at all, The sauce gets lumpy. Very good and simple recipe / Thank you for sharing !!

To raise this dish to a higher level, sweat a couple of TBSP finely chopped shallots in the butter before adding the flour for the roux. Make using half and half and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Serve over toasted English muffins. I always soak my beef in some cold water before chopping and adding to the white sauce.

Well, I started reading the reviews and found that most of them were the same.  This is what we used to have in the Air Force and called it SOS but it didn't stand for "Same old Stuff".  It stood for "S*** on a Shingle" and most of us asked for it by that name.

Pepper wasn't in the classic recipe and if you want to keep it classic you cannot add any of the other "stuff" either.  

I have always used the Buddig packs.  If you want to try something better try using the Buddig packs of ham - substituting it for the beef.

I call it "Sham on a Shingle" and it is the only way that I make it now.

Unlike other "reviewers,"  I prepared the recipe exactly as written.  I used the dried beef called for, not hamburger or Walmart beef.  Despite the fact that the beef label merely suggested, rather than specifying, rinsing the beef, I did not do so because the recipe never mentioned rinsing.  The result was inedible because of the saltiness.  If I try this again I will definitely rinse next time.  Lisa, if the beef is to be rinsed, say so in the recipe.  Oh, and S.O.S. definitely does not stand for "same old stuff."

Spend a little extra and buy yourself Armour Dried Beef. It makes this a great Chipped Beef Gravy. Chipped Beef gravey on toast any day of the week for this bunch. The cayenne pepper is a nice touch too. I quickly run warm water over the dried beef to remove some of the salt. I try never to add salt as it seems to break down the essence of this delicious gravy.

I use 2 packages of Buddig sliced beef and add a dash or 2 of Worcestershire sauce to the cream sauce instead of cayenne.

If you would like more of the dried beef flavor, saute the dried beef with the butter to release its oils 'before' adding the flour. Makes an incredible difference and changes this 4 star into a 5 star recipe.

I grew up adding the beef as soon as the white sauce was started!  Maybe thats why it never tasted salty to me or anyone else who has ate it since its soaked in the "gravy" for a little while.  I also add lots of shredded cheese and make the sauce cheesy.  My family absolutely loves this.  Cheap and easy meal.

I usually use the packaged beef also, but I usually
saute it in the butter for a few minutes then add the flour to the pan and stir until the butter is absorbed.  Add the milk and stir until thickened.  It seems to give the white sauce a little more flavor.

This is one of my most favorite comfort foods. I made it for my kids this morning. One kid loved it, the other wouldn't touch it. I used the sliced beef in the packages like my mom did when we were little and I added in six crumbled hard-boiled eggs. Truly comfort food at it's best.

It's good over biscuits but for true trashy taste, best over cheap toasted, buttered white bread.

One of my favorite comfort foods for breakfast.  I add about a tsp of garlic powder and onion powder and some white pepper!  I also get chipped dried beef from the deli!  I sometimes serve this over homefries as well!

This is just like my Nanny used to make.  The only thing I did different is we eat ours over potatoes.  Just boil the potatoes, mash them on your plate.  Add some butter and salt and pepper and put the chipped beef over it.  That is always how we ate it growing up.  Oh, and I leave the skin on my potato but the kids like it without!  Thanks for this reveiw.  I haven't had this in ages.  Bring back great childhood memories with my Nanny (grandma).

Very tasty.  One word of caution - don't be tempted to add salt to the white sauce because the chipped beef is very salty.

My husband has been talking about the creamy chipped beef his mom served him when his was a child so I decided to make it for him.  She is no longer with us so I couldn't ask her for her recipe and I came across this one and thought I'd give it a try.  My husband loved it with the exception that he, like many others, thought it was too salty so next time I will rinse the meat.  Changes I made:  I added onion with the melted butter and I added the meat to the onions before the flour.  I used 2 cups of milk instead of 1.5 cups and I add a sprinkle of nutmeg.  My husband said it was perfect except for the salt.

One of my favorite comfort foods from my childhood.  Made more special beacuse only my father and I liked it.  We made it with Budding packaged meat when everyone else had something better to do.  When I make it now I wish I could share it with him.

While the recipe is excellent, I quite often make it using very lean ground beef.  Brown the beef in a small pot, add the flour to the beef,stir,  then add the milk to the mixture.  It will thicken quite fast and eliminates the job of making a roux. I then add a touch of wostershire sauce and some onion powder, garlic powder and salt/pepper to taste.

Mmm, we love this one now, and I grew up on it as well.  Even better is creamy egg on toast, make the same white sauce but throw in chopped hard boiled eggs instead of the chipped beef.  My 4 year old loves it!  Or a can of peas for creamed peas on toast.  Any of these options are perfect for comfort food!

I made this for my husband, after he had been begging for me to find a recipe for SOS.  I rinsed the dried beef from the jar in warm water, but hubby said it was still very, very salty, and for him to complain about saltiness is rare!  He said the SOS the Navy served was much better!  The sauce looked good, but next time I would use corned beef or something else besides the jar of dried beef.

This is a good starting point! My mom's best friend makes this all of the time and I have fond memories of it growing up:) She adds a small chopped onion to the butter while making the roux. Also Velveeta (to your liking) cubes to the white sauce and a little sherry or white wine tops it off! She also always served this over the frozen puff pastry puffs (not the sheet). Great served with peas! I LOVE this for dinner, such a wonderful comfort meal for me:) Thanks for sharing!

Followed recipe to the T and it was the saltiest meal I have ever eaten.

Hook me up to the water hose.  Liked the consistency of the roux, but once 
dried beef hit it...........it was all over.

I'm going to try it with vegetables and chicken or tuna; and perhaps 
hamburger.

Good, solid recipe - brought back memories of one of dad's specialties when I was a kid. I found the salt level fine without rinsing the dried beef, but I did make a little extra on the white sauce so that may have helped. Added some cracked black pepper, served over rice - YUMMM!

Almost exactly how I have made it for many years. Anyone from military families Know this term came from them and was simple just like this recipe is.

By the way, I did make this exactly and it was good.  I usually fried my chipped beef in the butter first for more flavor.  Good over biscuits too.  Toast is the bomb though.  In my opinion.

We have eaten this every Easter Sunday, for the past 50 years. Here’s our family’s twist. 
First we make a roux with butter, onions, Wondra flour & whole milk. A nice rich white sauce.
The chipped beef is sliced & then must be soaked in warm water to get the saltiness out. 
The hard boiled colored easter eggs are peeled and chopped & go into the white sauce when it’s finished. Serve over toast. Some pastel color comes out from the dye on to the white of the egg & it's very eastery!

I just made this for New Year's Day brunch.  I tripled the recipe and added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon dried mustard.  That is how my mom used to make it when I was a kid.  It was one of the first entries to go!  Simple and yummy.  I wish I could find dried beef without nitrates.

My mom has been making this since I was a kid, she had learned it from her mom who learned how how to make it in the Army ... I needed some comfort food today and couldn't call my mom up since she's on vacation and so I turned here. I'm so glad I found this, it was exactly how I remembered it from my childhood. My mom always used the packets of sliced beef from the deli and it always comes out great! Thanks for sharing! This was perfect for such a dreary day and during midterms!

This is your basic, old fashioned recipe for SOS. And you know what? It's still easy, and it's still pretty well received. My non-meat-loving kids really like it, and it is sooooo fast to make.

Delish!  A quick and easy recipe that my whole family enjoyed.  I could not find the dried beef in a jar, so I used the carl budig thin sliced pastrami lunch meat.  I cut it into strips and heated in a fry pan before adding it to the white sauce.  Served over thick toasted slices of challah bread.  So good, I will have to double the recipe next time!!

I remember my mom making this on occasion growing up.  I did rinse the chipped beef to try and reduce some of the saltiness.  I also used kitchen shears to cut down the time it takes to chop the beef.  This was good but not nearly as good as I remembered it.  Since the SODIUM is OUT OF THIS WORLD I probably won't make it again for another 20 years!  Personally, the USMC SOS recipe was much better tasting that was made with ground beef.

Yup, this is my grandmother's and my mother's recipe before her, although, we don't use an 8 oz jar of beef. For this much sauce, a 2.5 oz jar is more than sufficient for us, and helps keep it less salty overall. For the poster who was wondering was additional spice could be added ... the secret is always nutmeg. A SMIDGE only, not more than that, lends a nutty spice to this dish, much like it does to Alfredo sauce.   I made this tonight and served it over toast cubes.  We've also made this and served it over toasted stale rolls.  it's also quite good over crushed breadsticks.

This brings back childhood memories. I didn't care for creamed chipped beef as a child, but I like it better as an adult.

Great recipe only my family found that 8 oz of dried beef to be overwhelming.  I used one (1) 2.25 oz jar of Armour dried beef and ground mixed  peppercorns in the next try.  It was a success!!  I also took me back to my days in the Marine Corps!!

I increased the sauce as some others did and this turned out perfect! I've made this before several times, but never with the cayenne and it made a wonderful difference. I also like to put some scramble eggs on top of mine too...just another little touch that makes it better.

Upon a review and suggestion I used lunch meat and I would have to say use the dried beef it would had been much better.  The cream sauce seemed to be missing that flavor that comes with it and that may had been due to using the lunch meat instead of the dried beef. So I would maybe try this again but I would use the dried beef and maybe a tablespoon more of butter.

My mother used to make this when I was a child for us all the time since we didn't have very much money. It's my absolute favorite. it's simple, easy, and brings back memories. it's not a flavorful dish if you're looking for something fancy and awakening, but if you have the same reasoning as i do, it's just a comfort food.  And to make it better, my mom always put chopped hard-boiled eggs in hers. YUM! :)

Delicious! I haven't made this in ages and it hit the spot tonight.I used 1/2 stick butter and approx 1/2 cup of flour..be sure and cook that a minute or two to get rid of the flour taste. I then added the milk, slowly stirring and last added 2 pkgs of chipped beef that I sliced in 1/4 inch slices. Always a family favorite.

The men in the family love this but I use 4 TB butter, 4 TB flour and 2 cups of milk and 2 pkg corned beef. I heat the 2 cups of milk in microwave for a couple minutes and add milk all at once to the roux so I don't have to spend forever stirring it.

As my mom did, I add 2 coursely chopped, hard-cooked eggs.  I also add some frozen peas to make a 'full meal' out of it, and I serve it over country buttermilk biscuits.  And don't add ANY salt to this!  And to those having trouble making white sauce, you can mix the milk & flour together first (I use cold milk, or half & half) in a measuring cup and add to melted butter all at once.

DH requested I make this. I have to admit I really did not want to but glad I did.I tasted a bite off of DH's plate, it isn't bad and really easy to make. Only draw back is the sodium content. DH ate the whole thing so that was 6,564mg of sodium. I would blow up like a balloon. If you don't have a sodium problem I would suggest trying this, you may like it.

We all enjoyed this chipped beef for dinner (myself, my husband, my 5 year old son and 4 year old daughter). I rinsed the beef, but I think that I must have "over" rinsed it. I rinsed every single slice while running the rest of the beef under water in a collander. The result was that it actually ended up needing salt, IMO. This is my own fault of course. :n) the cream was great, and next time I'll be less meticulous with my rinsing. Not sure if I prefer this over Stouffers, since Stouffers is obviously easier to make, which is why it got 4 instead of 5.

This recipe is entirely too salty as written.  I had to throw it away.  We couldn't eat it.  Do not use dried beef in a jar.  Maybe package from cold cut department would be ok.

I had left over corned beef from a brisket I had made and used this instead of the jar beef.  I used the food processor and chopped it all up.  I made a double batch for 2 teenage boys. I warmed the milk in the microwave first for 5 mins that way it doesn't scald and makes it faster to make.  I also warmed the meat in the microwave for 2 mins.  I also added a pinch of garlic salt because it was too bland for my taste. While the  milk was in the microwave I made the butter flour mixture, and when the meat was in the microwave I did the toast and then put the meat in the sauce and it was done in 10 minutes.  Very easy and fast and the kids ate it all!!!

Recently, I found myself craving this recipe although I hadn't eaten it since my early childhood. My family of six wasn't exactly poor but we had to make simple meals stretch far so the 'chipped beef' was Land-O-Frost lunchmeat, the toast was English muffins, and seasoning was salt and pepper. I substituted those same ingredients again and this recipe was still FANTASTIC! Tasted exactly how I remembered! Savoring it again tonight took me back over 30 yrs., when us four kids were madly lapping it up and fighting for seconds (and thirds)! THANK YOU for the yummy recipe and wonderful walk down memory lane.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and each time it has been GREAT!  I like to add some frozen corn to mine.  It is indeed wonderful comfort food.  It is incredibly cheap, quick and easy.  I would suggest buying dried beef for this and not using the lunch meat as someone suggested.  I tried it the first time that I made it to save money, but was disappointed by the taste.  No need to salt a second time when using the dried beef right from the jar.

You need to double the recipe. The portion of roux to chipped beef is sparse. It only makes enough for two people or cover 4 pieces of toast and the chipped beef is really salty even though I rinsed the chip beef in hot water and let it boil in the roux. Next time I'll double the recipe and boil the chipped beef in water before adding to the roux.

my mom used to make this and i had been craving it! came out perfect the second time...the first time i made a big oops! didn't wash the beef off...i didn't know to do it and it was pretty much inedible. second time around i rinsed it and it came out perfect! so for anyone else that has never cooked with dry beef...be warned! rinse it first :-)

My family loved this recipe!  Such a simple classic, but it was a hit (and SO affordable for cooking on a budget).

I personally don't care for this. My husband thinks it is ok and our 7 yr. old don't like it. However, our 20 yr. old who hates everything loves it. I always loved my mom's S.O.S. Has my taste changed? I am going to ask her how she made it when I was growing up. Sometimes she used hamburger and sometimes dried beef..Thanks for sharing and I am sure this is a wonderful recipe.

I love creamed chip beef on toast but the jar of chipped beef was so terribly salty, I could not eat it. Any suggestions as to getting the salt out.

I have been making chipped beef on toast for years.  I start out with olive oil instead of butter.  More healthy.  Add flour slowly to oil, lower heat and stir until it gets slightly brown.  Add milk and several drops of Wright's concentrated Hickory Seasoning (liquid smoke).  salt & pepper to taste.  In the Navy they call it (SOS- on a shingle)

" on a Shingle" as I know it is made with a white sauce, has peas in it, and is sprinkled with curry powder, not cayenne.  Nouveau " on a Shingle" is made with a roux, Buddig roasted turkey, peas and has lots of extra hot curry added to the mix.  Probably would taste good with a cold beer--a Kingfisher beer from India.

I have never heard of dried beef in a jar, nor have I ever seen it in the store.  I have made this many a time with browned ground beef in a brown gravy instead of a creamed one.  I like it fixed that way a lot, but am turned off by dried or even luncheon meat.

This is an old stand-by recipe that I have prepared for my family for years.  I use 2 packages the Buddig beef, double the cream sauce and add just a dash of both onion powder and garlic powder, along with salt and pepper to taste before I chop and add the beef and serve over toast.  With these changes, I'd give this recipe five stars.  A quick and easy meal!

Although creamed chipped beef isn't the top notch of the culinary food chain, it's just downright simple and delicious. And, reminds me of my childhood! Great recipe and I introduced my daughter to chipped beef on toast!

The husband could not get enough of this yummy comfort food.  I used Carl Buding beef and doubled the sauce.  The cayenne pepper gave it a little heat which was nice, add more if you like the spice.  Served with veggies on the side.  Will be making this one again and again.

I've been making this dish for years, I start slicing the dried beef, them plunging it briefly into boiling water to remove some of the salt, then saute it in butter, add cornstarch then milk till ti thickens to desired consistency.  season w/a bit of white pepper... that's the authentic way to make it!

It reminded me of the frozen Stauffer's, what I grew up with. I doubled the recipe for 4 people.  I used jar beef and drained it twice. Since I drained the beef it needed a little salt.  I didn't put in the cayenne pepper. I put in black pepper instead. I serve it on toast.

We are beef farmers and dried beef is in the freezer.  This is just about the only way we like dried beef.  I was looking here for more ideas of what to make with it and found that I had already tried them all: chicken bake, creamed beef, and overnight casserole.  Our favorite way of eating creamed beef is either over fried hash browns or waffles.  I always seasoned this with a little bit of nutmeg and beef broth and seasoning powder, but tonight I will try the pepper.

I tripled the sauce and used half a pd of dried beef chipped from the deli.  We eat this when we go out for breakfast.  You can put it over scrabbled eggs, fried taters, or the most popular is toast.  I liked this better than what we get out, and everyone in the house liked it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was one of my favorite meals growing up!!! I'm not sure exactly how it was made back then, but I can only assume that it was similar to this... however the pepper (and the reviewer's suggestion of peas) turned out to be incredible additions.

Also, for my family SOS meant er, "stuff on a shingle". (The kids had to call it "dirty word on a shingle"! Hah!)

My family absolutely loved this!!!! I am not a big fan of chipped beef, as a matter of fact not at all, but my husband and my son devoured it!!! Simple, quick. The only thing I did different is instead of cayenne pepper I used lots of black pepper and a splash of Graces Hot sauce. Thank you for a delightful receipe..

MMMM!! I was so happy when I found this recipe! My mom makes this for me everytime I'm home, but she uses the frozen stuff. And since I live out of the country I'm not able to find that. So I jumped for joy when I found this one. Very very yummy! I couldn't find the jarred beef or the deli kind so I used lunch meat ham and it was delicious! I also added hard boiled egg whites on top of my toast.

Thank you for sharing!

Had a deep desire for creamed chipped beef tonight. Being just after mid-March I also had some leftover corned beef. Used it in this basic roux recipe and it is wonderful. Thanks Lisa for posting. Also my father taught me how to cook very rich so I used 1/3 heavy whipping cream to 2/3+- pure water as my liquid in making my roux. Much creamier taste and texture= richer flavor.

Very good basic recipe. Soaked the beef in water before using as another reviewer suggested and it was just right; not too salty.

Good stuff, like what mom made but w/ an added kick.  I use the beef in the plastic bag, and that works fine.  I like how salty this recipe is.  But, I'm an admitted saltaholic.  :)

This was very good and easy to make. I don't use any hot spice's so I elimated that part and instead of toast I like it over home fries.

This dish was delicious. Will make it over and over again.  I also use Lean Quisine cream chip beef.  It is great for a hurry up meal.

This is my daughter's all-time favorite breakfast.  She eats it once a week.  I use the Buddig brand Corned Beef and poultry seasoning instead of cayenne.  Over Xmas break used leftover cubed ham instead and cream instead of milk, just as good, if not better.

The recipe was great, but was a little too salty.  Later I read on the jar of beef, that if you use in recipe rinse in warm water first.  Next time I will try that.

71 years young and been eating it and cooking this as long as i can remember.  the only dif is that we melt butter and tear the beef and brown in butter then add flour. But nothing beats SOS on toast or biscuts and try it on pancakes.

Made this many times over the years.  I remember my mom making it when she would be tired and wanting to feed 3 kids.  Never heard of the beef in the jar.  I always remember my mom having packages of beef.  That is what I use also.

Soaking the dried chipped beef in warm water for a few minutes helps to remove much of the salt and softens the beef.  After soaking I blot on paper towels then use kitchen scissors to cut into small pieces and add to my gravy. I also find doubling the ingredients, except the beef, makes plenty for my family. We prefer to serve this SOS over homemade biscuits. It's great on a cold night for dinner! Pure comfort food.

Wow this sure brings back memories of breakfast at Moms house! I doubled the recipe for a family of 4 good eaters and used 2 jars of the dried beef. I made it exactly as written and was a little concerned about having too much meat but trust it, it's the perfect amount. I did soak the jars of meat in water for 5-10 minutes prior to cooking to cut down on the saltiness and served over biscuits as Mom always did. Delicious meal. Thank you so much for sharing!

Well, this cooking method will work, but it would be difficult not to have lumpy gravy. Here's the easy way to go lump free.

In a bowl, dissolve the flour in the cold milk. In a saucepan, saute the other ingredients and bring to a boil on high heat..

Lower the temperature to medium-high, then stir and add the milk/flour mixture to the saucepan. Keep stirring until you arrive at the desired thickness -- LUMP FREE!

I use one pound dried beef and get it chipped, and half an onion chopped into small pieces. Taste for salt, if to salty rinse off with hot water. Heat the beef and onion in four to five  tablespoons of butter over a medium heat, add three tablespoons of flour to the beef and mix well. After about five minutes add your milk, I like heavy whipping cream better, but then use less flour. Bring to a boil and let sauce thicken. When you have the consistency you like serve over buttered toast, home fries, hash browns, or even buttered noodles.

Tasty comfort food. This is my go-to recipe when I want creamed chipped beef. The only change I make is  to half the beef (actually used only 3 oz this time and the ratios seemed good.)

I only used two, 2-oz pkgs of Buddig's beef but kept the full amount of sauce. Even with using this type of beef it was a little salty to me, but it was still good. I thought the sauce would need something to spice it up a bit, so I also added a bit of seasoning salt and garlic powder. This was a very filling mid-morning breakfast with a biscuit. No lunch for a while! Nice and easy recipe, Lisa!

I have tried this recipe, but instead of chipped beef, I use cut up ham and it tastes so delicious!  My daughter and mother finish off their plates before I even get my plate ready, and with my daughter, that's saying something!

Came out perfect, used the thin-sliced lunchmeat,just two 2oz packages. Then toasted potato hamburger buns with a generous amount of melty butter.  Plated it like the pros on TV, added a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkling of black pepper. Paired with a bowled green salad with tomatoes, craisins, sunflower seeds, scallions, and vinaigrette dressing. Wish I had thought to take a pix before we dove in! Even my husband appreciated it - and he's not easy to please!

This is a fine recipe with a few tweaks.  I melt the butter in the top of a double broiler (on the stove top).  When the butter has melted, add the dried beef (pre-rinsed).  Cook the beef in the butter until it curls on the edges.  Remove from heat and stir in the flour.  Place the mixture over boiling water in the double broiler over med heat.  Slowly stir in the milk and continue to cook until desired thickness.  I add a Tbsp. of A1 sauce at the end of cooking.  We serve this over biscuits.

I love it!  It's just like mom used to make.  For a yummy and slightly richer variation on this timeless classic, substitute bresaola for the dried beef.  I could live off of this stuff!

I used a pound of ground beef and doubled the gravy part. As written this would only serve 2 people at my house. This turned out well. I added a cube of beef bouillon since I wasn't using the salty dried beef. I put this over biscuits and my husband loved it and was very happy with this comfort food. Thanks Lisa!

definately soak the beef first!  as everyone else said, you can always add more salt.  can't take it away!  I normally don't eat SOS because of how salty it is, btu this was fantastic!  Thoroughly enjoyed by both us!  This will be made again!

I hadn't had this since I was a kid and boy did it bring back some memories of my grandmothers kitchen.  Quick and easy but I used budding brand meat that is used for sandwiches and cut it up to add it.  Great meal when in a pinch, or just wanting something quick and satisfying.

Very good. I love the kick of the cayenne pepper. I also added black pepper (that's what my mom used) and a little bit of chopped onion.

Delicious!  I forgot and added salt so it was too salty- big boo boo- the dried beef has plenty of salt.  I halved the recipe for two people, and added at least half a cup more milk, as it kept getting thick, which stretched it far enough for 4 english muffin halves, as half the recipe alone would not have been enough.  Great quick filling breakfast!

This is the standard Philadelphia recipe and it's great except for the jar of dried beef.  Use real dried beef available from www.PhillyPretzels.com shopping cart.

I used canned venision and it turned out great. I just let the venision drain and dry while I was cooking the gravy and it was awesome. I did add garlic and onion to my rue for some extra flavor.

Loved the simplicity of this recipe. My son and I just had this for lunch served over a plate of crispy crackers. I added beef bouillon to the thickening roux and though it added an even hardier flavor.

Very great recipe. As a vegetarian, I replaced the beef with 8oz of seitan (meat substitute) and it still tasted wonderful!

This recipe was so salty I couldn't eat it.  I only used 5oz. of the jarred beef as opposed to the recommended 8oz.  It definitely needs tweaking.

Excellent! Used ground beef instead.  Browned beef and drained before adding to gravy mix.  Added salt to taste,  a pinch and a half of cayenne and fresh ground black pepper.  Cayenne added great flavor with no heat. Served over biscuits or wheat toast.  Brought back memories of my military Dad making this for us for breakfast on a cold day! :)

Good. Been making for years. I leave the cayenne pepper out and use salt and pepper and I boil potatoes, chunk them up into small bite size cubes and put in the mixture. Adds a nice texture and makes a little heartier. Still serve over toast or a warm biscuit. Alwasy a favorite with the father inlaw with potatoes

Make it just like this recipe and you can't go wrong! It is delicious! Top with a shake or two of black pepper.  

 
When my parents married in 1953, the only thing my mother could cook was creamed chipped beef on toast. So, meal after meal week after week she made it until my father almost tossed her out! Eventually, she became a fabulous cook, and the story of the chipped beef and how my father grew to hate it was a funny part of the family history. 
 

 
One day, when I was about twelve, I asked her to make it so I could taste what she had cooked meal after meal all those years before. She did, and when my father got home ready for dinner, he took one look at the chipped beef on toast and said, "Oh, no! Not this stuff again! Didn't we just have this???" She never made it again!
 

Another quicky recipe for this dish is to chip the beef into canned concentrated mushroom soup, adding only a little milk to get the right soupiness. Heat slowly over low heat to avoid scorching. Don't forget the cayenne - a bit more is tasty. And the toast must be fresh, well browned, and hot for the best effect. So tasty!

This was a standard for us duiring WWII.  We had it at least once per week.  Could be served at any meal, and was a godsend for my widowed mother with 5 of us to feed.  I was the oldest and always loved this and still make it.  It is identical to what we made but without the cayenne.  When I added this it was a definite plus.  5 stars plus.

This is so good, and so quick.  Actually you can use any kind of meat or even a can of tuna and put it on toast. I think they called it SOS in the army. I have made it many times. Love it!!!

My mother called this "chipped beef on toast". I have made this for years, taking over from my mother making this for all of my life.
We use the larger container of Carl Budding Beef, equal to about two little plastic bag packages, and cut the beef into bite-size strips. And we always add a drained can of green peas. We use fresh ground black pepper, although cayenne disappears in the cream sauce for for a better look.
There is never any of this left over with three people eating it for a meal at my house. My mother had to feed five people, and we were always wanting more!
We butter our toast before putting the chipped beef on top.

I make this but I use Cream of Mushroom soup in place of the milk, flour and butter.  Also add a dash of Worshershire sauce for added flavor.  Great served on biscuits, texas toast, or the best way is in popovers.

I've been making this for a long time.  As written, it's delicious, but I now add a splash of worcestershire, some paprika and frozen peas.  I also cook the roux a little longer until it ever so slightly starts to brown.  Sometimes we eat it over toast but more often over biscuits or baked potato.  Yummy!

This was a staple when growing up!  BTW - "SOS" comes from the Army term where this was made during the war.  It really means "Sh** On a Shingle!"  Apparently it was pretty bland!  To the lady that "boiled" the beef, no boiling is needed ... just let sit in cold water a few minutes, rinse, taste and soak once more if you thing it's too salty.  I still make this now and then when I want "mom's" food!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I've been making CCB forever. I use packaged dried beef most of the time but have also purchased it at the deli counter. I've never used cayenne pepper in my recipe, but white pepper...will definitely try this. As I said I've been making it forever...I sautee the beef in butter and add flour...make sure everything is well coated and then I add cold milk frequently stirring and making sure I have the right consistency. Even though I don't know the exact measurements it comes out perfect every time. We like it on toast points, sometimes we have it for dinner and serve it over jasmine rice or pasta.

I grew up with this recipe and I have made this recipe for 20 years or better.  I use a couple of TBSP shortning in a fry pan  sometimes 3 and brown the chipped beef from a packet then I add flour until grease is absorbed and add milk I begin with 1 1/2 cups and bring to boil sirring constantly.  As it thickens I add more milk until the gravy is as I want it to be not too thick or too thin.  But I love making this it is inexpensive and very good.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Serve on toast or potatoes.  Usually a kids favorite.

This is one of my favorite foods from childhood and one I occasionally make but my mom's recipe was 2 tbs of butter and 2 tbs of flour to 1 cup of milk and no cayenne pepper.  I prefer it with dried, sliced corned beef for even more flavor.  I've never had it with ground beef but I have friends who make it that way as learned from their grandfather who was in the military.  This stuff is really great on a cold winter day for stick to your ribs comfort food.

It is a tried and true recipe in our family.  As always there is the but....I add fresh mushrooms to the butter and saute them for a few minutes.  Instead of whisking the flour I put it in a jar with skim milk and pepper and shake rigorously.  Then strain it while adding to the butter and mushrooms.  The last thing I do is add a cup of frozen peas and a bit more freshly ground pepper.

I make this all the time for lunch. I use Buddig beef/turkey/pastrami/etc. The oven roasted turkey is really good. For some added flavor I add ~1 tsp. of soy sauce to the sauce and easy on the salt. Really good.

This was pretty unflavorable, but I did make it with non-fat milk and the Buddig beef instead of the dried beef (saving calories & fat).  Hubby said a 2 star and I told him it was very low fat so he said it's a 3 star.  But, he said, nooo, don't need to make that again.

I doubled the recipe, eliminated the cayenne, used two 4oz bags of dried beef, added 1 tablespoon of worchestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of tabasco, and 1/2 teaspoon of mustard powder.  Replace 1/3 of the milk with half & half.  That brought the recipe up to a 5 star rating!

This was a simple recipe with a great end result.    I rinsed the beef before adding it to cut down on the salt. The cayenne made it a bit to spicy for the kids so I will use regular pepper next time.

Perfect recipe although one 4.5 ounce jar would have been sufficient.  I had two jars, which meant I had 9 ounces of beef and the recipe called for 8 oz. So I added a little more butter, flour and milk. And I added a package of frozen spinach which I defrosted in the microwave and drained. It made it delicious!

Used this recipe but left out the cayenne since the kids were eating it with me. I added a pinch of sea salt and about three grinds worth of black pepper during the "gravy making" stage instead... Between me and my two kids... NO LEFTOVERS! :-)

My Grandma added sliced hard boiled eggs, and sometimes asparagus, then poured the sauce on top.  Same ingredients, more black pepper.  It has been one of my family's favorites.

I had a left over roast that I was trying to find something for and came across this. I am not at all a cook and thought to myself these are basic ingredients and I can do this. I added about 2-2 1/2 cups of the roast all cut up.  It was a little bland, being worried about other reviews with too much salt, I SLOWLY added salt and pepper.  I then also added a bit of garlic and onion.  It was truly devine!!  Funny too I just bought a new bottle of wine we had never tried before, it was a white Merlot, but after reading it was a Merlot that was recommended.  Absolutely PERFECT!!

hear me out... I gave it 4 starts just to leave a comment. I haven't made it yet as per the recipe, BUT I made it with the Buddig beef as some suggested and I have to say I have never made a more tasteless, bland, dreadful meal.  I added the cayenne and sure, it added heat but it didn't fix the dreadful taste.  Next time I will follow the original recipe and then decide how many stars. Sorry Buddig fans

Excellent recipe! I loved it. I too use the dried beef in the 8oz packets. I doubled the recipe and doubled the packets and it was perfect for 4. The original amounts were a little small. My stepson never heard of this and it was a hit.

This was a staple when I was growing, as my Dad was in the Navy.  I made it just like the recipe, only doubled the recipe to feed the family.  I was buying the frozen Creamed Chipped Beef, but this was soooooo much better.  The only thing I added was chopped hard boiled eggs on top.  This idea came from my husband when we first got married, because that was how his mother always made it.  Quick, easy & cheap meal.

This recipe is great. I took the advice of adding a little cayenne pepper and it made all the difference. A wonderful comfort food made a little better. I was snowed in and running out of most things so I took a wonderful Amish sausage, actually sweet italian sausage made by the local Amish people who live in my part of Maryland and cooked it thoroughly and then diced it into small pieces. I followed the recipe exactly and used the chopped up saugage (1 piece six inches long fully cooked) as replacement for the chipped beef. It was wonderful and allowed me to use up two heels of bread, a little light cream and one link of sausage. So all in all a great meal for one adult and a wonderful way to stretch the provisions till this February 2010 three feet of snow in the Baltimore/Washington area melts enough to go to the store again. I figure about four more days. So if you find your self needed to stretch things for whatever reason this is certainly a supply or budget stretcher. Cost of my dinner was almost $2.00 and great.

Budding meats definitely work faster and easier than the dried beef. Try it with the Budding corned beef; might provide that extra little flavor some are looking for. The SOS recipe my Grandfather brought back from the Army and that Dad still makes, though Same Ole Stuff is definitely not what they call it :)

While in the Army, I never had this version of S.O.S. (S--- On a Shingle).  By the time I joined in 1982, they had cut costs by going to cheap ground beef.  When reading the other recipes at this site for S.O.S., they are always for a large helping... one of them even says that you need umpteen gallons of milk and 20-tons of beef (not really, but waytoo much) and that 16-slices of toast are used... I ain't cooking for the entire platoon, just good ol' Sergeant Harman!  I Love this SIMPLE recipe!!!

This is great.  My husband is a huge fan of the Stouffer's frozen kind.  And he absolutely loved this.  I have a feeling I will be making this for years to come.  Rinsing the beef is the key. Remember that.

This is comfort food at its best and just like Grandma used to make.  I served it over mayonnaise biscuits from this site and everyone agreed that it was terrific.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is just like what my Mom made when I was growing up!  Delicious!  I have made this a couple of times now and have to double or triple this recipe because I like to have leftovers for the next day!  The only thing I added was hard boiled eggs because that's how my Mom used to make it!  Our two toddlers loved it!

simple, economical and tasty.  honestly, my dad used to force this stuff on me when i was a kid.  for some odd reason, i had a major craving for good old creamed chipped beef on toast one day and this looked easy enough.  the only i adjusted was to use lots of black pepper.  the whole family loved it, including my 7 and 8 year old sons!  they actually request that i make this.  and i tell you, on a cold winter's day, very comforting.  not to mention, budget friendly.  my store doesn't carry jarred dried beef, but buddig's sliced beef works just as well (and is probably less salty).  thanks so much.

Comfort food!  I also doubled the flour and butter, but didn't need to double the milk really.  It was my first time making a roux (sp?) and I think it turned out well.  I also used the Buddig beef instead of the jar of dried beef, so no saltiness problem.

This recipe calls for way too much beef. Cut it down to 2 ounces, like I did and it's a lot better.

My mom used to make this growing up.  However we used to call it "creamed peas on toast."  Try adding some peas to the mixture!  Sooo much tastier to have the juicy sweet peas along with the salty chipped beef!  YUM!

We loved this, so easy and good.  I did soak the chipped beef in water first, to get some of the saltiness out, and it worked perfectly.  Great recipe!

Totally what I was looking for, a taste from my past. I didn't add the cayenne pepper, an used shaved lunch meat not dried. Wasn't salty at all, added pepper to my portion to keep it mild for the kiddos.

This is a great recipe. I, myself, am not a huge fan of creamed chipped beef due to lack of flavor but my husband LOVES the stuff. I just added a pinch of cayenne pepper and ground pepper to the sauce and buttered the toast up. We did not rinse the beef prior to making htis, but I think I will next time as it was very salty.

A good addition to this is hard boiled eggs. It adds an extra flavor and texture but doesn't overwhelm the original recipe.

Just like my Mom makes!  I will double the recipe next time. My family is pretty picky so I thought there would be plently but they loved it and when they went for seconds  the pan was EMPTY! 
I added an extra tablespoon of flour and a little fresh ground pepper.  Wonderful recipe!

This is a great base recipe.  My alterations:  I use the canned beef but I use the 2.25 oz jar which seems to be fine.  I also rinse the beef under running water.  That takes the extremely salty taste away. Then I can add some Emeril's Bayou Blast seasoning or some hot sauce. When I add the beef I also add 1 cup of frozen peas.  I serve this over chow mein noodles instead of toast.  We LOVE it!!

This is a great fast, cheap and EASY meal. I have found the chipped beef you buy in the refrigerated section is less salty, easier to use. Its cheaper too and 2.5 oz. is plenty.

I rinsed the dried beef (from a jar) a little bit, but this was still almost too salty to eat.  Definitely rinse the beef really, really well!  Also, we grew up with creamed chipped beef that had more cream than beef;  this recipe is more like lots of beef with a little cream around it!  The flavor (except for the salt) is great, though.  Next time I'll rinse the beef very well, and cut the amount of beef in half or less, and I think it'll be delicious.

Wow--Quick and easy, with ingredients normally stocked in the pantry.  I use it for our chipped deer supply.  For some reason the deer wasn't too salty (non-commercial deer).Great comfort food!!

Zowie!!  This is one of the saltiest meals I've ever tasted.  Even with rinsing the meat, which by the way, I found that 1 (4.5 oz.) jar was plenty of meat.  It's too bad, because if you can find your way through the salty taste, it's a pretty good recipe.  I think I'll take the recommendation of a previous reviewer and use a good cut of deli meat next time.  Now I'm stuck with a second 4.5 oz. jar of dried beef.

This was one of my favorite's growing up...to combat the saltiness my mom always rinsed the beef very thoroughly before adding it to the roux..Don't worry it will still be plenty salty! That should do the trick for you!

This is a family favorite in our house. My mother in law used to put Worcestershire sauce in hers and that's how I make it. I use 1/4 teaspoon  of Worcestershire sauce and it gives it a nice flavor.

This is great stuff. I've been making it for 50 years.
Some few butcher shops carry  "the real thing" instead of those little jars, which are okay, but if you find it where they slice it to order, try it!
This is also great served over a baked potato, or noodles.

I haven't made this in quite a few years.  I don't know where it originated but my dad learned it in the army during the Korean war in '50-'51ish.  Back then it was also known as SOS but then it was short for Shi£ on a Shingle.

So, it's a good recipe but I made it a little different because it doesn't make much.

I doubled the milk, butter and flour
Used 4 2oz packs of Budding Beef lunch meat (diced)

And used about 2 pinches of pepper, crushed red pepper and cayene pepper.

It tasted amazing. Just will be tripping the ingredients next time instead of doubling.

Been in the fire department for 20+ years and we used to eat this about once every 3 shifts in my younger years until we started getting more health conscious at work! It’s okay to fall off the wagon every now and again. Turned out great and everyone loved it!!

I love creamed Chip beef but this recipe is missing a crutial ingredient: a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Makes all the difference in the world.  I’d pass on the cayenne pepper as well.

It had been a long time since I had made chipped beef and, since this recipe didn't mention that you should rinse the meat prior to cooking, I didn't.  It also doesn't mention that you should shred the beef before cooking (I did remember that part).  My old recipe says to brown the shredded beef in the melted butter before adding the milk/flour ingredients.  The bottom line is... I had to throw it all out because it was too salty.

I like salt, but this was too much.   The recipe left out a very crucial step of rinsing the beef.   The recipe isn't the least bit palatable as written.   The meat to "gravy" mixture is off too and should have more milk.   I will make again with my changes.

YUM! SUPER easy and tasty! My wife is on a low sodium diet so instead of using dried beef, which is WAY too salty, I used regular 80/20 ground beef. Still came out perfect!

"We called it SOS: Same Ole Stuff. " Haha it's an old military thing, and that's not what SOS Stands for (if you're interested, it's "Sh*t on a Shingle"). 

This is a pretty good recipe, but you want to rinse the beef real good before you add it to to the cooking sauce. Get all the crud and salt off it. You can season it later. Good recipe, makes me really nostalgic for my dad (Army) fixing it...

Family really enjoyed this. I recommend rinsing the beef first as otherwise it will be excessively salty. Only difference I made was pre-crisping the beef prior to adding to the mix, otherwise it was delicious.

This was a good basic recipe.  I cooked the beef in the butter for a few minutes before adding the flour and it really added flavor.  I don't like Cayenne so instead I added a touch of garlic powder and onion powder.   Turned out very well.

I use smoked cured beef from the local meat locker! I slice it, cook it in the butter and sprinkle the flour over the cooking beef! I then add the milk slowly.... it adds so much flavor to the gravy! Served over toast my husband just loves it! Says it tastes exactly how his mom made it growing up in Iowa!

Well this recipe I think requires more milk my opinion after making it and unsalted butter because the meat is already salted and soak the meat and water for a good maybe 10 minutes or so and brown the meat before putting it in the gravy that's just my suggested  after making this recipe it was extremely salty not enough gravy

I added more butter and Sautéed the dried beef in the butter before adding the flour. It was wonderful!! My family was mad I didn’t make more!

I make this for my friend a couple times per year and he LOVES IT. I serve it with garlic mashed potatoes and I triple the recipe so he had lots of leftovers! As others have said, you might want to double or triple the sauce recipe.

I couldn't find dried beef, wish I had read the reviews and used sliced beef from the deli but I used hamburger. My family loved it, I used a pound of hamburger and increased the gravey by 1/2 and we didn't have enough for 2 adults, an 8 yo and an 11 yo. (Maybe we did have enough but we ate so fast we didn't realize it.) I prefer the dried beef in a jar my mom used to make it with, but the people at the store hadn't heard of it and were grossed out just hearing about it. Ha ha.

I left out the cayenne,  and I soaked the beef in some water while I made the gravy to tone down the salt.  It was really good and a quick lunch but it didn’t feed four... but then we were hungry!

my moms trick was to melt the butter and brown the meat a little, then add the flour and cook a little more,  it gives it a fuller flavor, then add the milk and lots of black pepper,  we get our meat at the deli county - ask for dried beef,    good over toast, or hash brown potatoes.

Delicious!  I make a similar dish with sliced boiled eggs.  The beef is so salty you definitely do not need to add salt.  Creamy and comforting.

Please make sure to rinse the dried beef before using or this will be very salty.  Also, this suggests 8 oz of dried beef, I used one jar 2.5 oz and that was plenty of beef so I'm not sure but I think 8 oz as listed would be way too much for the sauce.

I had leftover dinner rolls and wondering how to use them. Then I thought it's been years since I've had creamed chipped beef. Perfect. Thought I would buy Stouffers, Walmart shelves were empty. Decided I would try to make this( I don't know. how to cook). Was pleasantly surprised how simple this was to make. Faster than store bought. Easy, for people like me, a non cook. Flour, butter, black pepper, and I used Carl Budding Beef, and left out salt.( Butter and beef have plenty of salt) That's it. Toooo easy.

I rinsed the dried beef under hot water and cooked the roux until it looked like peanut butter. It’s really good. It’s a better version than my Army days. I should have added a fried egg on top at the end.

I've made this recipe every since I was a teen.  My mom made this long before I did.  It is definitely a family favorite and very filling on toast or biscuits.  I also use Buddig beef instead and it is a lot better made with cornstarch than flour, creamier and doesn't have that flour taste.  We also used the name SOS but it stood for  on a shingle, lol.

I seem to be the only person who never had this growing up.  My husband requested it and I'm glad he did.
I like many substituted with "Budding" beef lunch meat. I chopped up 4 packages which was plenty. I served 3 but could have easily served more although I will double the sauce in future. 
DON'T over salt the sauce, in fact don't make any desired taste changes until after you add the chopped beef (Budding does not need to be rinsed) to the thickened sauce and only then after a couple of minutes for the salt in the beef to work through the sauce.
I served over grilled sour dough bread. I have nothing to compare it to but hubby said was great and I agreed.
Simple, cheap and fills the belly

Creamed chip beef should be made with thin sliced dried chipped beef, typically found in a jar or bag.  I don't like it washed, but if you have an issue with salt intake it would be suggested. Try cooking the chipped beef pieces in a little butter before making  your roux. Cook them until the edges sizzle. Put it aside. 
Then you make a roux.  Add the beef back in once you add your milk. I use more than a cup of milk. Add and let it thicken. Repeat until you have the amount you want. Typically 2 cups for me, with  unwashed beef. 
Also, try it without pepper or w sauce. Four ingredients  are all you really need!

Made this today.  Awesome!   I took hints from some of the other reviewers, and soaked my beef for a few mins.  I wish I would have not done that.  We do not eat a lot of salt, so I thought soaking would help with the saltiness.  It did, but too much.  I only soaked for 2 mins and we ended up having to add salt.  Next time, I wont soak.   Also, I cannot drink or eat anything with diary, so we used Almond Milk as a sub, and it worked out great.   I also slipped in a small onion that I chopped up.   Great recipe that allows for a little play.  We loved it, 5 stars from me!

My grandfather taught me this recipe (although he had a very different explanation of the name S.O.S.).  He was a WWII vet and this dish is one of the few good things he brought back.  When he finally came home he opened a bar and was well known for his hearty cooking!

So, thanks for sharing.  Making the food made me feel good.  If I'm not mistaken, he would also sometimes use deli-sliced corned beef, but your ingredients were the way I remember it.

First I soaked the dried beef to get rid of the saltiness.  I chopped up the beef so it was in strips, set aside, then started my roux.  Melted the butter with 2 T flour, whisking the whole time until it was close to burning.  This happens quick so watch it closely.  Got the nutty flavor I was hoping for.  Stirred the beef in then I added the warm milk.  Stirring and turning up the heat to get it to thicken.   Added,  dried garlic pieces, a bit of Dijon mustard, kosher salt, pepper and Lawrys garlic salt: all to taste.

My mother (Bless her soul) used to make this all the time when we were kids. Why not!? It is quick and easy, tastes great on mashed potatoes and/or toast. Last 2 times I have made it....nothing left. I recommend doubling the recipe. I made it for family that does not like ANYTHING hot (Dang, they are missing out!) so omitted the cayenne pepper in the 2nd batch. Recipe is really good, just the way it is. I use the Carl Buddig  Beef.

When I make this I buy my chipped beef from a local Farmer's Market because the beef is not as salty.  If you do use the kind from the store, you have to soak it to get the salt out.  Also,  when making the roux, I first melt the butter in the skillet and then fry the beef in the hot butter for a few minutes to crisp the beef.  I then add the flour to the mixture and stir it around.  Next I add half-and-half instead of milk and bring it to a boil.  At the end I add freshly ground black pepper.  It makes a nice, rich chipped beef dish.

Just like my mother made. Rinsed a little because it was very salty to taste. Did buy Stouffer's but my store was out so remember my mother. Made this for breakfast and sent us off to school with a hardy meal under our belts. Enjoyed making this and eating it.

Yeah it was simple great and you can add a little sugar to match the cayenne pepper heat, about a 1/2 teaspoon per serving. This is good old school SOS. Lisa well done!

This recipe is very good with the 4 oz jar of the dried salted beef.  I would double the rest of the ingredients with 8 oz of the beef.  DO NOT FORGET to soak the jar sliced beef in water for at least a half our to leach the salt out.  Otherwise the result will be so salty you wont want to eat it.  The jar sliced beef is a salted beef.  This is the best.  If you want to make it the cheap way, you can use the Budding sliced beef in the pouch.

Just like I grew up eating-  we ate it for breakfast but my father in law recently moved in and he ate it for dinner so that's what we did!   My mom and dad always added a bit of celery salt to the recipe-   (and like one other reviewer, we always used the Buddig meat-)   Yummy-    great dinner!

I sauteed chopped onions and green peppers in butter first then i added the flour and cooked it a bit to get the raw taste out. I added sherry at the very end.  This is the way my mom made creamed chipped beef. The addition of the onions, peppers and sherry really add dimension to  an otherwise bland dish.

I loved this growing up. My siblings and I always begged that our father would make it for breakfast on the weekends. I was so happy to see this recipe. However, it turned out terrible. I wish I had known that you are supposed to rinse/soak the dried beef first. I will read suggestions before embarking on this journey again. I hope to get this right, my dad's was always a crowd pleaser. Thanks for sharing this recipe, brought back good memories!

Quick and easy for a mid-week meal.  We had to double the recipe for our family of 4, but everyone liked it. To cut on time, we made this with 8 oz of deli roast beef that we diced up. Will be adding this to the rotation for quick and easy week night meals.

Flavorful, quick and easy,! I did not have beef on hand, so I substituted thinly sliced cooked venison and it came out very well...so well in fact that I plan to routinely make this substitution, using whatever fresh meat I have on hand versus the highly processed Budding or jar meats.

Added a little garlic powder, and by all means much better served over biscuits than boring white toast. Try Eskay dried beef, they make a lower sodium. It can be found where the bacon is.

Good and classic recipe, but as other commenters have mentioned, you HAVE to soak, prepare the dried beef to make it less salty.  The amount of sodium in the meat right of the jar is insane.  First batch we made was inedible.  However, since my daughter is a vegetarian, we made a batch with veggie ground "beef" and it was awesome!

Ok... fast comfort food... it is what it is.  This will never be a 5 star recipe no matter how you make it.  But I think it's a great way to use up some extra thin sliced deli roast beef (instead of the dried beef).  Add a dash of worcestershire  sauce... yummy!

I preferred the WWII version,but I also liked my sons hamburger s.o.s equally as well. My son puts a cheese slice on his toast,then the hamburger sos and finally a sunny side-up egg! He calls it ,you guessed it, bird(chicken sh-t) on a shingle ??! It's really very good and is a hardy breakfast.

I made this per the recipe, the only thing I did differently was to soak and rinse the beef beforehand, as a few others suggested.
It was very tasty as is, and I don't think I'd change anything. The dash of cayenne lends it just a tiny touch of heat, which was perfect. I will be making it again.

Just had this for the first time homemade and my hubby said it was better than Stouffer's Creamed Chipped Beef.   I call that a winner because we loved Stouffers but it is pricey and full of preservatives.  I never heard of Budding Beef before reading the reviews and was surprised to find it in my grocery store.  It worked great .  I seasoned the sauce with a little a little bit of fresh grated nutmeg as well as pepper and served it on toasted English Muffins.   Loved It!

I wish I had read reviews before making this.  It was wicked salty!  I made it with Hormel dried beef in a jar.  I'd like to see the recipe advise how to reduce the saltiness before preparing the recipe. Next time I'll know what I need to do.

One change that should be added to the recipe is the fact that the beef should be rinsed before being added. Way too salty. After I added the beef I was reading the other comments and noticed someone else had mentioned it but for me it was already too late. Please revise the recipe so this doesn't happen again!

Too salty?  Soak it overnight (or, at last a couple of hours) in water.  I fill the jars with water and shake vigorously.  The I set it aside until I am almost ready to add the beef.

I melt the butter, then stir in the beef, add the flour until all the beef is coated; then add the milk and heat.  Any way you do it, it's great

As an Army brat my dad would make this for us. I really enjoyed his and was not disappointed in how this turned out. I did add some pepper but other than that I followed the instructions as stated. Maybe next time I'll play around with the seasoning or add some diced onions.

I substitute the chip beef with mild sasuage. Just brown and crumble the sasuage first no need to add seasoning.  Add to the cream all at once ..oh it is awesomeness. And cheaper than buying dried beef less salty as well . Especial if you are watching your salt intake and cuts the calories.

This is a good recipe for cream chip beef. Although, I would and have made one small change. Instead of cayenne, I would suggest cajun. I didn't put in a "pinch" I put at least a forth of a teaspoon.

This was so easy to make and we loved it!  I used the Buddig packages of lunch meat and didn't rinse it first, like some of the reviewers suggested.  It was salty but to me, it wasn't too salty.  We can't wait to make this again!

Left out the butter, browned up the beef (used the Esskay "lower sodium" lunch meat style, so no rinsing or worrying about salt), then put in the milk, then flour. Needed an extra tablespoon of flour, though, and cooking time, to make it thicken up! Added about 1/4 tsp of black pepper (maybe a little less) spread evenly across it, to make a peppered gravy, and a little garlic. I think it came out ok. ???? Lowering the star count just because these things really should have been addressed in the recipe.

This  recipe was so easy and so good, I don't know why I didn't make it sooner! My son and I both loved it. I used sliced dried beef from the deli counter to chop up and add to the creamy sauce. The sauce cut the saltiness of the beef to just the right degree. Perfect Sunday breakfast or lunch on a chilly winter day.

One of our favorites, I used Chickenvittle's suggestion to add the beef before the milk.  I didn't worry so much about it possibly scorching and had the same great flavor.

Loved it, was great.  Right before dinner, another son showed up to eat, so I added a bit more milk, butter & flour, then 1/2 block of cream cheese to make it go further!  Will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is good--it's the same basic roux used. I add the corned beef to the melted butter, then add the flour. Then slowly add the milk. Two other ingredients are minced onions and worcestershire sauce also. After serving, I encourage people to add hot sauce!!

one of the best chipped beef recipes I've tried. To the poster: excellent job and thank you for sharing. As for those who don't like the saltiness of chipped beef, either buy lunch meat or don't salt your food... I found mine to be perfect. Super easy to cook and my one year old absolutely loved it.

It was a great base recipe.  I added onions, garlic, black pepper, beef stock, and worcestershire sauce.  I also topped with cilantro when served.  I also cut the dried beef into smaller pieces to serve easier. Next time, I will reduce the dried beef to just 5 oz. and soak it to reduce the saltiness. I would also increase the flour and milk amount to have more sauce.

My family used to make this when I was a young, and mom would add frozen peas to it. Dad had a different name for it, though he liked the SOS is still the same the phrase was S,,, on shingles.

I was looking for a low calorie meal for the two of us and came upon this recipe. It never occurred to me that an old family favorite could be low calorie LOL. I adjusted the recipe to reflect ingredients for 4 servings and the only thing I added was 2 tablespoons of Cooking Sherry (my grandfather's secret) and it was just like "home." And we used a 2 small baking potatoes, instead of bread. Total calories for each of us was 579.

To cut down on even a little more salt I used unsalted butter... I didn't think to rinse/boil in hot water when I made it but it turned out good.  :)

I had to use a bit more flour to thicken it up and I don't like cayenne pepper so I used a bit of black pepper. Easy and turned out great. My grandmother used to make this for us. I think you either love it or hate it though! I live in NC and we can only buy jarred chipped beef here which is gross so I buy it in MD from the deli (actually sold as chipped beef from a small deli). That's the only way I will make it!

Fast and easy! Kinda bland tasting, so I added a bit more butter, about 4tbs of butter and black pepper. Over all it was pretty good. Start to finish took about 10mins.

Recipe was good, BUT, if you are using jar dried beef, you MUST boil it to get some salt off or you will end up throwing out the whole thing like I did

This recipe is great for a start,  provides a nice frame work to build on.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of Smoked Paprika in place of the cayenne pepper.  I also used thin slices of deli style roast beef instead of the jarred beef.  I then boiled a 1/2 package of pasta ( shells).  I added a 1/4 package of frozen peas to the sauce and let that cook over simmer then added the pasta.  My family asked for seconds!

I really liked the flavor, instead of one pinch of cayenne I did two quick shakes of it. I also did a couple shakes of black pepper. I used 4 of the 2oz. pkgs of Buddig beef. I did NOT rinse first and it was not too salty. I used unsweetened regular almond milk in place of regular milk. I used 6 slices of Brownberry white country bread and threw them straight out of the freezer into the oven at 400 for 12 mins or so. This fed one adult and two small children. I served it with Grippos Chips. Good recipe, I haven't had this for years! Thanks for posting it!

Super easy recipe. I didn't have dried beef and my son really wanted cream chipped beef so I substituted for shaved deli ham. I added some salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and paprika (because I didn't have cayenne pepper). Served over buttered toast with fried eggs. He loved it!!

Great recipe, good quick food!  Granted, your mother protected you from where the SOS term came from.  It was originally military (this was something they could have on the go), and Same Ol' Stuff... is the nice version, they called it Sh.. On a Shingle.  I do the same thing, though, when my kids ask for the meaning on acronyms I learned in the military and used without thinking about it, so no harm, no foul :)

Great base for SOS. I sauted a little chopped onion in the butter and added one temperd egg yoke to the sauce once thickened. This makes for a rich and velvety sauce. Add a few drops of Worcestershire Sauce. For you pesto lovers try adding 2 Tbl spoons. I had some left over pesto in the fridge and it was pesto cream heaven!

I remember eating this at brunch on base when my dad was in the service. Overall, we enjoyed it! I bought the packaged lunch meat to save on cost. Next time, I would probably soak the meat in water and pat dry to reduce the salt a little bit. This is an easy recipe for a busy night!

I also grew up on SOS from my British Grandmother and loved it.  I was the only member of my team in Vietnam to go back for seconds in the mess hall and everyone thought I was crazy :)  The chipped beef is becoming very difficult to find, though, in American supermarkets, but I moved to Canada about 8 years ago and discovered a butcher that produces a very thin beef that is smoked with Montreal spice.  I was checking my refrigerator last night and found about a half pound (250gr) of beef and remembered the chipped beef on toast of my youth.  It was simple and quick and just as I remembered.  Outstanding!

We had never had this before so because of all the good reviews I decided to make it. My 2 year old ate one bite and refused to eat any more. The sauce to meat ratio is off. Needs way more sauce. The dried beef was salty, even after rinsing twice in hot and cold water.

Just like mom used to make. My youngest boy (6 yr) raved about it. It is very simple, comfort food. I used sliced, packaged, peppered beef lunch meat. It doesn't get much easier than this on a work night!

Very similar to my family recipe.  The only things I do differently:  use 3 packs of buddig beef (no need to rinse), increase butter to 3 TBSP,  add beef to butter in pan & simmer for a few minutes to add flavor before adding flour.  Also use 3/4 cup half n half & 3/4 cup of milk for richer sauce & I add black pepper, nothing else.  So good!

Everything turned out perfectly!  The butter, flour & milk ratio is spot on. I doubled the recipe, added deli corned beef and served on toast for breakfast.  I did add my favorite spices & herbs. Very easy and the whole family liked it.

Love it! However I was hoping someone could help me out, I added a 5oz jar of dried beef and and followed everything exact but the dish was way to Salty to me. How would you cut back the salt taste? It all came from the dried beef, maybe add more milk to the recipe? Thanking you all in advance ??

This is our traditional family breakfast for Christmas - served over hot split biscuits with fresh fruit salad.  My slight alteration is to chop 'Buddig' beef lunch meat (no soaking necessary) and slightly brown it in a little butter, then remove the meat from the pan, prepare the white sauce as directed and add the cooked meat back once the sauce has thickened. Season to taste - oh, and the pinch of cayenne is a fun touch!

Good recipe, however.... Instead of making a flour roux, I simply add 2 tablespoons of corn starch to a half cup of water and stir it till completely dissolved. Then I add 2 tablespoons of butter to my deep frying pan, add the shredded chipped beef which I get sliced from the butcher shop, and lightly brown it in the butter. Then add 1 and 1/2 cups of milk, and the cornstarch mixture, and stir it till it boils. When it thickens, I remove it from the heat and top hash brown potatoes or home fries with it. I add a couple splashes of hot sauce to mine on the plate. Yes...I did alter this recipe as submitted.

If you use just a tad bit of bacon fat like 1/2 tsp. with the butter, it gives this recipe a divine taste. My Slovak father made it this way.  Great served with hash browns too.

Very good recipe, i used dried beef in the jar, soak in water about 10 minutes and rinse. The gravy is really good. I especially like it on toasted and buttered English muffins.

I am not a fan of creamed chipped beef but my family really wanted it so i sucked it up and made it. It was actually pretty yummy. I used three freezed dried packs instead of a jar. Just what my store carried. My hunny said it doesn't reheat well mostly cause it gets to salty as it sits

Love this dish. It used to be made a lot at our house when growing up. My dad was in the Air Force and they ate this often overseas. I found that I needed more sauce for one jar of meat as others have said. Great overall recipe and the now my kids love it as much as I do.

Made this twice, already.  Takes me back when my Mom made it.  Very tasty !  The cayenne adds the finishing touch.

a hit in our house.
i did substitute ground beef ( hamburger) for the dried beef, had to add salt. if using dried beef, no salt needed!  still a hit in our house.

My husband said it was just like his mom used to make.  I followed the reviews that said to rinse the beef, saute with the butter and then add flour.  I think this helps the flour mix better with the half & half when it's added.  Also only used 4.5 oz of meat for a full recipe since that's how big the jar was that I bought.  That was plenty of meat.  I'll probably double the recipe next time, but just use the 8 oz of meat.

Grew up on chipped beef on toast and have been making it myself for 40+ years.  Never occurred to me to add cayenne pepper (we love cayenne pepper).  The addition of this ingredient changes plain old (SOS) into a truly tasty meal.

yum. I forgot to add the cayenne pepper but was still delicious. Simple ingredients and easy to make. Better than Stouffer's.

We loved it. Taste just like the food my mom used to make. The only change I made is I added a pinch of garlic salt and used fresh dried beef from the local meat shop. Yum!

Very nice!!! To put a little extra touch in it, try a few drops (up to a Tbsp. depending on your taste) Liquid Smoke and even add a small jar of mushrooms.  Makes a very filling and delicious meal!

Very tasty! As another reviewer said, I used Buddig Corned Beef instead of dried beef. I also omitted the cayenne pepper. I put all the ingredients in a sauce pan at once and it still turned out. I just used a whisk to mix it and it thickened up nicely. My whole family liked it including my picky husband and 20 month old son.

This is a good basic recipe for chipped beef. I added a little bit of garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper and a sprinkle of paprika. I also put in a can of LeSeur baby peas. (my mother always added that when I was a kid, and I just have to have peas in my chipped beef!) I soaked my beef a couple of times before I added it to the sauce. It wasn't salty at all.

Well not sure what's i'm missing here but this recipe was bland in the tenth degree!
I followed according to the recipe but definately not for me and I'm a lover of SOS....I'll have to keep looking. Maybe I didn't read enough of the reviews to p/u some improvements but as written, a waste of time and food...

Made this last night and it sure took me back to the good old days. This is the same way my mother made it. The only change I made was to use bacon grease instead of butter. I did splurge on the jar beef. The jar is now larger than I remember it but I believe it had the same amount of beef. I guess they want to make you feel you are getting more for the high price.We ate it on plain toast which is what my mother always used. It is a real comfort food.

Love Chipped Beef in gravy! You can get it from the Schwans Ice Cream Truck and it is fabulous! Comes in 2 trays you can either micro or heat on stove. I like to use Pillsbury Crescent Rolls and press them into muffin pans for Toast Points! That's the way my mother made it and she was from Pasadena where they do everything right!

I haven't made this in years, but reading it brought back great memmories & the recipe is right on the money!  I always added salt & pepper rather than cayenne.  This is also great on a baked potato. This is great comfort food and thanks so much for the memmories!  Think I might just go out and get the stuff to make it with this week!

My mom used to make this using a dried, chipped beef and we all loved it!  I made it using the Budding beef and was very disappointed.  The sauce was fine, but the beef wasn't.  I may try it the next time using ground beef, since the dried beef in a jar is way expensive.  That is how it was served when I was in the navy, and I always enjoyed it.

Great recipe! I used beef broth and condensed milk and added black pepper. 
I've always loved this "SOS" with any sort of beef, especially left-over roast beef. In the Marines, we called it "SOS" too, but it meant "s**t on a shingle". It was always on the breakfast menu at the chow hall! 
I do like the idea of having it with beer...never tried that. I've had oysters and beer for breakfast before down in "nawleans"! 
"Beer...it's not just for breakfast anymore!"

Five Stars: Make a large batch, divide and place desired portions (usually not more than two) in quart-size freezer bags and freeze.  Just pop in microwave for about 5-7 minutes to heat up. Great quick meal, especially served over English muffins.

I love this, I had it as a child and now and then as a quick meal.  The only thing I do different is to rinse the beef under running water for a few minutes to get rid of some salt. Awsome!

Thank you! I have been looking for a simple and tasty recipe for this dish for awhile. Having grown up in a Navy family we had a different, and far less appealing, meaning of "SOS" but always loved it just the same. True comfort food!

I just got this recipe and am going to try it Sat. for dinner. I am a big lover of this particular food but it usually is way too salty for my blood pressure. I got a few good tips here for calming the salt. But I do love the way you cleaned up that SOS name. I grew up with the original SOS name since my father was in the service. I'm giving you 5 stars because your recipe sounds better than most I've read and the tips were good. Thank you

This is so easy, delicious, and cheap. I always used the packaged corned beef lunch meat (usually store brand 3 or 4/$1.00) and always added a cup or two of frozen peas. This makes it colorful, filling and a little more nutritious-my kids used to love this while they were growing up! I probably doubled the sauce portions, though.

I've made this for years but never from a recipe...just threw it together.  I always mixed in sliced hard boiled eggs just before serving and use several drops of Tabasco sauce to add a nice flavor to it.  Definitely a comfort food on toast or potatoes.

Don't take off stars for saltiness -- just soak the torn beef in water for a few minutes to your taste! My grandma and mom always sauteed in butter 'till softened then sprinkled over the flour to easily cook a roux  before adding milk gradually while stirring and mushing to smooth the gravy. Like others here we double the sauce. Buddig's seems chopped and formed to me; real air-dried beef is almost never seen in groceries but we go online to Dakin Farm (about $20 a lb.) or Harringtons (about $25 lb) and the quality is worth it. For another savory down home comfort food go back to fried Taylor Pork roll slices on toast or fried bread with mayo!

We grew up on this! Just love it! A family favorite. I put the beef in the butter and cook for a few minutes then add the flour. We have served it over Mash Pot, Baked Pot, Biscuits and of course toast. Had it every Sunday Morning growing up. We also called it SOS, *&^% on a shindle! My father in law says he called it four skins on toast! Breakfast or dinner it is Great!

I thought I was the only person left alive still making this!  I add some cream of mushroom soup and rinse the beef well...both
help cut down the saltiness.  I am going to try it next time with the pastrami as another review suggested.

I have been making this for years using various luncheon type meats. My favorite is beef pastrami from the deli. Not over salty but very tasty. my preference is on sour dough toast. I only gave it 4 stars because the chipped beef is too salty but with  pastrami, it's a 5 star.

Comfort food from times gone bye.  My mother used to make when I was a child.  Had completely forgotten about it.  This recipe it great.  Even though it is salty, that is part of the comfort factor.

This is a filling recipe, very comforting. I use Carl Budding Beef in a packet, also substituted canned biscuits for toast. Added a sprinkle of onion powder to roux and sauteed a small chopped onion in the melting butter. My husband loves it. He had this in the Navy and they also called it SOS but the letters meant something entirely different to the guys aboard ship!

My father made this about once a week for me as a child -- almost 70 years ago.  When he was home, of course, lol.  Career Army, he called it like it was called in the Mess.  Still a favorite in my home -- and like several reviewers pointed out, better with evaporated milk.

For more flavor, melt the butter in a frying pan and the add thin slivers of the dried beef and fry until slightly crispy,  Then add the flour to coat the fried beef.  It will be dry but add the milk slowly till all in.  It thickens as it cooks.  Add cayenne as it simmers.  Also, try this with evaporated milk for extra smooth!

I make this all the time BUT make it as my mom did in earlier dollar-stretching times:  instead of bottled milk, we always use a mixture of 1/2 water and 1/2 Carnation evaporated milk (fresh from the can).  Somehow the evaported milk improves the flavor, in my opinion; then again, it may be the memories associated with it.  And, yes, this is The BOMB when served over hot homemade biscuits.

My husband introduced me to this family recipe when I met him 26 years ago.  He adds sliced mushrooms.  Once softened in the sauce it adds great flavour.  To me it's not the same without them. Definitely needs pepper and the pinch of cayenne.  It's a go to comfort food for our family!

We grew up with this similar recipe with 1/2 c flour 1/2 c butter and about 1/2 gallon milk, with a can of tuna and a can of peas served over toast topped with little soy sauce and chow mein noodles.  Delicious for an alternative to beef.  (Serves a family of 8)

I grew up with creamed chipped beef as a favorite breakfast, but with these proportions: 4 T. butter, 4 T. flour, 2 c. milk, 1 package dried beef (used jar only when couldn't find the package).  Serve over biscuits or English muffins.

good recipe - one I grew up with. Even though the dried beef is salty, my mother would add a little salt to the roux and then wash some off of the dried beef which gave the SOS a little more flavor. Yes, we called it SOS too!  on a Shingle!

I made this like SOS. It was so Quick and Easy and it was just yummy. I seasoned my hamburger,and added some salt to the cream sauce. It is so creamy too. Easy comfort food! This is a good one when you don't have much time.

Have been eating this since I was a child and making it for 25 years.  Have always used the Buddig beef, no need to rinse and doesn't have all the salt.  Serve with peas so you get creamed peas and chipped beef in one sitting.

We really liked this dish and it was very easy to make. It is a good go to meal when you need something quick. I used the cheap Carl Budding beef lunch meat since it is a lot cheaper than the little jars of dried beef. I would use more beef next time but I think the lunch meat worked great! This is a super cheap, good, quick meal.

I finally found the perfect recipe to use up the dried beef mistakenly purchased and in my pantry for too long! I doubled the sauce and had only a 5 oz jar of beef, which was just right.  Served with a packet of Marie Calendars biscuit mix, ready fast and so light and crispy, they went well with the sauce.  Green beans topped it off and between me, my husband and our 3 yr old, it diappeared quickly. Might try adding corn or onions to the sauce next time for a little color and to mix it up a bit.

This is what my dad always used to call "Hangover Food."  It was what he always made for breakfast on Sunday morning after a "liquid Saturday night."  I always rinse the dried beef in warm water and drain it before chopping it and adding it to the gravy.  This gets out some of the salt. You can get dried beef from the Amish in Pennsylvania that has very little salt and is really delicious if you live or visit there.  In the South, we usually serve it on hot biscuits.

I used the beef in a jar and it was very salty. I will rinse the beef next time like other viewer suggested. But other than that it was easy to make and I liked the cayenne pepper in it. I will try again.

This is absolutely a comfort food!  I use the Krogers brand of dried beef in the package, serve over biscuits with either peas or asparagus.  I sprinkle hardboiled eggs over the top. YUMM!  A familly favorite!

My mom always made this recipe with 2T butter,2T flour, 1 C of milk, 1/2 t salt, dash of pepper, dash of paprika and a couple drops of worschestire sauce. Also she would add peas and use canned dried beef. It was always good as a kid.

It wasn't good and it wasn't bad, just a little blah. Something definetly needs to be added to the roux.

Made it for lunch...Delicious! Some are turned off by the name, especially SOS, so I changed the name. Since the sauce is basically a Bechamel, I gave it the French name, Bechamel ébréché de boeuf sur le pain grillé.  Or, for SOS:  Merde sur un bardeau.  Now it even sounds delicious. YUM!

This recipe was SUPER easy to make and POSITIVELY delicious!! This is definite comfort food!  I used 3/4 lb. dried beef and quadrupled the white sauce and it was just fine that way, not too saucy and still plenty of beef. I followed the recipe exactly (except for quadrupling the white sauce) no salt added and two pinches of cayenne and it turned out perfectly. I also let the roux turn a bit brown so as to eliminate any "floury" flavor. Toasted whole grain white bread, buttered it also (it's comfort food remember) and cut into points. Not only delicious but nice looking too. A fresh, chilled iceberg salad and, Voila! Dinner

I have used a recipe very similar to this one for years.  Try adding 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce once the sauce has thickened.  Its really good.  My family loves to eat this over baked potatoes instead of toast!

So easy to make and this taste just like my mother use to make. I made it a little more spicier with 2 pinches of cayenne pepper and a pinch of black pepper. I also used both toast and waffle. Very yummy!

Made this today for lunch.  When I was in high school several years ago, we made this but added frozen peas.  I added them to this today, and served on hot bisquits. Is a good comfort food on a winter day!!

I've been making this for years. My only changes have been to use unsalted butter and add a couple of spoonfuls of minced onion to saute gently in the butter or a couple of dashes of onion powder to the white sauce. Add a salad and it's a quick lunch or dinner.

My hubby always nagged me to make this.  Growing up, my mom also used to refer to creamed chipped beef as SOS -- but it stood for something different (and not so nice).  Thanks to her, I was dubious that "SOS" could taste good.  But I finally caved and made this for dinner last week, and was so surprised how delicious it was!  I actually had seconds and then thirds (the third serving is because I'm 8 months' pregnant and always hungry!).  ;-)  I was actually craving this again, so I made it last night.  I had some extra English muffins, so we toasted those and served the beef over the muffins instead of regular toast.  It was fantastic.  Thank you for such a great, easy recipe!  Once the baby gets here and I have limited time in the kitchen, I know this will be a meal I'll make often because it's so simple.  Yum!

I love this recipe.  I would get this every time we went to Golden Corral and now I can make it at home.  I was having breakfast with my father one day and he said it reminds him of being in the army.  So I think of that every time I have it.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I'm no fan of thick gravies, or even beef for that matter, but I am a fan of quick and this dish delivered!  The sauce is great with some cayenne and black pepper, and could also be a nice "blank slate" for other seasonings.  We served over warmed ciabatta and it was scrumptious.  Husband loved it.

I make chipped beef for my family all the time.  One thing that I like to do is add veggies to the mix.  My husband is a big asparagus lover.  I saute some cut up pieces of asparagus in butter until tender and toss it into the chipped beef just before serving. This makes it a complete meal with meat, starch and veggies.  You can add any vegetable that you like.

This stuff is sooooo awesome... My pappa use to make this for my brother and I when we were kids. He passed away in 1998 so its been a very long time since I had it. I was so excited to find the recipe. The only thing different was he called it S.O.S too but he claimed it meant "S*** On The Shingle" LOL

This is a great crowd pleaser. I used a 6 oz package of Land-O-Frost Cracked Black Pepper Beef and doubled the gravy. I used the deli beef because the package was about 2 times as much volume as a regular jar of dried beef (for the same price).  I avoided most of the salt and saved some money at the grocery store.  I can't wait to try other beef packages.

Love the recipe but had to omit the pepper as it was too spicy. I used dried beef from the butcher (we bought a side of beef) and so I actually had to add salt to taste.  Served over mashed potatoes (or) toast Otherwise Yummy!

I used Esskay 40% lower sodium chipped beef, which comes in a bag and is found in the lunch meat section. I thought the saltiness was just right. The gravy was nice and thick, and the perfect amount for the meat. UPDATE: being on a budget, I have experimented and found that the inexpensive Buddig beef lunch meat works great!

I miss this from my childhood.  I made it with the chop beef instead of beef in the jar.  It was less salty and it tastes great on an hamburger bun.  Add a little cheese and its like eatting a hamburger.  love it.

Thanks for bringing me back to the memories of creamed beef on toast, only difference in the recipe, is I use fresh chopped beef, which I fry up first, drain and then add to sauce, then salt to taste.

This was just the way my mom used to make this. It reminded me of when I was a child and she would make it on a cold day. Now I can carry on the tradition with my daughter. thanks for bringing a piece of home back to me.

My family loved this.  Very tasty, but just a smidge too salty.  Will definitely make again!  Did double the sauce to make enough for two pieces of toast per person.

This recipe is tasty and couldn't be simpler.  I used 3 3oz. packages of chipped beef and increased the gravy recipe by half, which was the perfect amount.

This is one dish I get a craving for every once in a while.  I remember a friend of my mother's serving it when I was a kid and this one is exactly as I remembered!  I use the Buddig-style beef (2-2 oz. packages) instead of the dried beef.

My grandpa would eat this all the time when he was aboard the USS California.  Whenever my mom made this recipe, his face would light up as if it brought him back to those days in the Navy.  Everyone in my family always enjoyed this, thanks for sharing!!!

I made this tonight for supper.  It was wonderful.  The only thing I would do different next time is double the gravy.  That is personal preference though, we like more gravy to put over the toast.  Even my kids liked it.  My 7 year old son asked if I would make it again sometime because it was really good.  I also soaked the beef to get rid of the salty taste.  I will be making this again and again.  Thank you so much for posting it.

This was delicious!!  My grocery store doesn't carry beef in a jar, so I had to use beef packaged in the deli meat section (brand name of Buddig...and it's not salty!!)I also didn't have cayenne pepper, so I used plain old black pepper....served it over buttermilk biscuits and fried eggs....what a fantastic meal!!!  Even my two children (ages 3 and 5 1/2) loved it!!!  It brought me back to my childhood and my grandma's cooking!!!

When I made the recipe as is it was extremely bland. I didn't rinse the dried beef and I am glad i didn't because even with my additions afterwards the salt was perfect. To add flavor to this I used Worchestire sauce, A1 and hot sauce instead of dried cayenne. With these additions it added the much needed flavor

Great recipe!

FYI, on the lid for the jar of dried beef (Armour), it says "WHEN USED IN RECIPES, RINSE IN WARM WATER AND DRAIN." I just noticed this while opening it. I'd never have bothered to look if I hadn't read about rinsing it on here. 

I made this last night, and was surprised at how easy it was, even given the short, simple recipe. I worried that my roux wasn't thickening up enough, and stirred it forever, it seemed like, but when it came time, I added the beef and seasoning, tasted it, and could not believe how good it was. It tasted exactly like I remembered it! Thanks for a great recipe. =)

Very Simple....I remember my mom would also add hard boiled eggs cut in large chunks and peas and sometimes even corn.  Over toast it made for a hearty meal. She would use the Buddig Beef in the packages.

My six kids loved this meal.  My 4 year old said it was the "goodest dinner"  I thought it could use a little more seasoning, but the kids inhaled it.  It was hearty and filling after a chilly football and soccer practice.  I will be making this again.

My cousin used to make this for dinner sometimes and I was really happy to find this recipe.  I think it was good, a little salty, but good.  I will follow other reviewers recommendations next time and soak the beef a little to tame the saltiness a bit!

This is some serious comfort food. So easy to make. My one reccomendation is to soak the beef, because it was a tad bit saltly. Otherwise, perfect breakfast for a cloudly Sunday. Made J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits (from this site) with it.

Just like my mom taught me to make it.  I just rinse the dried beef under hot water (my mom always did it a few times, she had to watch salt intake) to remove a little of the salt.  I like it over leftover mashed potatoes or biscuits - noodles are good too.

Loved this recipe.  I did soak the dried beef in water first..  otherwise, it would have been a bit too salty.  Thats the only reason I gave it a 4 and not 5 stars.  We make this one often. Thanks!

For my hungry family of 5, I doubled the recipe and substitued 1/2 of the milk with whipping cream.  I also used prepackaged thin sliced lean beef instead.  What a hit with the fam!

It hit the spot. My dad used to make them for me, because my grandma used to make them for him.  Now I am passing it down to my little one.  Like another reviewer, I use Butt's Beef and it tasted great,, could use a little more seasoning but was very good.

My mom has made this for years, but we add frozen corn or peas for some extra nutrition/flavor and use the cheap frozen shaved ham instead of beef.  I don't know that I've ever even had it with beef.  I like it because it goes together so fast.

I couldn't find the beef in the jar, so I used beef lunch meat.  A quick and easy dinner, good on bakery bread. Cayenne adds a nice zip.   Not my favorite but my boyfriend loves it.

Yum!  I just wish mine came out a little bit thicker.  I used the super thin sandwich beef (in the plastic packages) and added a little salt and pepper!  Hubby and kids loved it!  Thanks!

Yum! Back to being a kid again for a night. This was good, easy, fast and inexpensive. I made it with the dried beef like my Auntie did instead of the hamburger. The whole family loved it. Thanks for the memories and this will become a regular for my family now. PS. Found at the last minute I was out of milk but it did just as well with reconstituted evaporated milk.

My husband has been purchasing packages of "old fashioned dried beef" - in this case .4 lbs from a small town meat market (Maple Lake, MN) - I used all the meat, but found I had to make a second batch in order to have enough sauce.  This particular meat was not too salty, and the recipe was very enjoyable over all.  Thank you!

We loved this!  I used leftover beef brisket so I didn't have the salty issues.  Just wish I would have doubled the recipe.  Not enough for seconds.

Not a bad recipe.  I would have cut back on the beef as this was a bit too salty for me, but otherwise pretty good.

This is a great recipe like some of the others i use the dried beef in the packets instead of jars.  Also I add Old Bay seasioning to it.  Anyone from the Eastern Shore or Maryland for that matter should know that little secret!

One of my all-time favorites.  I add a little cajun spice and some garlic powder.  Let everyone salt and pepper to taste at the table.

thank you for this recipe.  I had a little trouble finding it cause I was searching under "SOS".  The trouble was worth it.
