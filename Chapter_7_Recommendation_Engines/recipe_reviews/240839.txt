These were really great! (Tip: for the love of all things holy, WEAR GLOVES when making these are your hands will be on FIRE afterwards from handling the peppers. Tip#2, if you rub butter on your jalapeno-burning hands this will help).

I made these as written and fell in love. I took out the membranes and the seeds and regretted it. Once baked they weren't very hot to us. If you like hot, then leave those in for some added flavour. I used homemade taco seasoning and really enjoyed the extra flavour. Thank you SandyBreit for your recipe! I look forward to trying your suggestions on variations.

These were delicious! I used garden vegetable cream cheese, feta and monterey jack.  My taco seasoning was chili powder and cumin.  I baked them 30 minutes. The peppers were still tender and not mushy. I especially liked the bread crumbs on the top. I used panko.  Much easier to make than deep fried and I actually like these better!

All the flavor of traditional poppers, but SO much quicker.  We grow our own jalapeños, so we will definitely be making these again!  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used corn flake crumbs and it turned out great.

My wife was not a fan of these poppers. They were massively hot. Duh. They are jalapeno peppers. If you are overly sensitive to hot food, consider using a mild jalapeno such as Senorita Jalapeno or Tam Mild Jalapeno 2. We used the peppers my wife grew in her garden and they were HOT! The cream cheese mixture was good, though some, such as my wife, may prefer straight up cream cheese.

I used Italian bread crumbs and Mexican cheese along with shredded mozzarella cheese. It came out tasty. I used gloves to de seed the Jalepenos and when I combined cream cheese and cheese I put the bowl in the microwave for 5 seconds to melt it down to make it easier to spread on Jalepenos.

These were great! I used Herb and Garlic cream cheese, Asiago cheese and Panko bread crumbs. They cooked up perfect on parchment paper. Yum!

Loved these!! I did miss the crunchy ALL-OVER coating though. But I will make these again. I didn't change a thing. My 8 guests ate 60 of them in less than an hour

This was a last minute addition to the dinner menu. They were easy to make and enjoyed by all. Next time I’ll probably fix some sort of an aioli for dipping. Great, easy and tasty recipe I’ll make again!

Perfect.  Made with and without the bread crumbs.  Used a bit less taco seasoning and added minced garlic, onion powder, clack pepper, and garlic powder.    Simple, quick, loved these.

I was excited to try this recipe but found it was overpowered by the jalapeño. I seeded the jalapeños most of the way (leaving a few seeds for spice) but they were too strong. Maybe it was that I had to use a cheese blend? (It had cheddar in in though). Maybe I’ll try it again when jalapeños are out of season and weaker.

I used bacon bits instead of wrapping in bacon. I also used a little chipotle sauce in mix.

This was really good.  A perfect alternative to the fried version.  Recipe says it makes 12... I used 7 good-sized jalapenos and could have used two more!

Oh wow! This is a keeper. Make your own taco seasoning and wow your friends with these poppers.
