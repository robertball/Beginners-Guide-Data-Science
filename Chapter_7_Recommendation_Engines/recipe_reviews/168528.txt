I made only the fiesta salsa to eat with my eggs.  This was the only recipe I could find for it.  Since I've never heard of or seen tomatillos before, I didn't use them.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I may use the rest of the recipe another time.  Thanks!

YUMMY!!!!! We loved this recipe. The best layered dip recipe we've tried yet. We didn't have chipolte peppers so we used chipolte seasoning cubes ( 5 cubes to one pint of sour cream) and it turned out fantabulous!! Thank you for sharing this recipe, it is really good. We'd give it more stars if there were more to offer!
