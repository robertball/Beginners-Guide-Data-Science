This soup came out incredibly delicious. I had a ham bone that I was saving in my freezer and it worked quite well with this recipe. 
I did swap the celery with asparagus. I also used an immersion blender once the potatoes were soft and made it all into a creamy chowder consistency. This eliminated the need for the water/flour step. It thickened up quite nicely and also "hid" the veggies for my picky daughter (and picky husband). I added the cream still, along with a little shredded cheese.
I will definitely make this soup again.

I think this recipe depends upon your ham! Mine was very flavorful (and definitely salty enough). I sauteed up a minced onion with the celery, added thyme and pepper, and carrots along with the cabbage and potatoes.  I ended up not even adding the milk.  It  was delicious without it.

Used a package of coleslaw mix, and a package of sliced fresh mushrooms, and about 3/4 tsp of garlic salt and some pepper to taste. It was delicious and will DEFINITELY be making it again!!!

Great recipe but I did alter somewhat to adjust to my family’s taste.  I sautéed the celery, a small diced onion and 2 smashed cloves of garlic to butter and olive oil in a stock pot.  I added 4-5 sprigs of thyme and then added flour to make a roux before adding the ham stock, potatoes and ham.  My family isn’t keen on cabbage so I used a bag of fresh peas when the potatoes were nearly done and used about 1/4c heavy cream.  Super!!

We loved this recipe. The only change we made was to use leftover ham instead of the meat off the bone because the meat on the bone was much too fatty for us.  This  isn't your normal ham bone soup. It was fresh tasting and delicious. Perfect for a spring soup, or those wintery days when you want spring to come.

Great cold winter night soup!!! I used low sodium chicken stock, not water. I didn't use cabbage, I added navy beans... Cooked them for 1 hour before adding to stock. 
I will definitely be making this again, so good!

This turned out really good!  I had to make a couple subtitutions based on what I had on hand...I used 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion, since I didn't have the green onions.  I also used 2% milk instead of the cream (since I didn't have the cream and I was hoping to cut the calories).  My husband and two little boys loved it and even asked to have the leftovers the next day as our meal!  I will definitely be making this again.

Good base recipe.  I added 4 small chopped carrots, one leek, about 1/2 t pepper and 1 t thyme.  I sautéed the onions, leek, celery, carrots before adding the broth and potatoes and ham.

Oh! My! Goodness! This soup is amazing! My 81 year old mother can’t stop eating it! I used a bag of coleslaw instead of chopping cabbage and held off seasoning until the end in case the ham had enough salt. I may have to cook another ham just to make more soup!

Rather use Instant Pot to get all nutrients from the bone. Also used milk instead of cream made it just as good.

Delish! Instead of flour and water to thicken, I add Mash Potatoe Flakes as a thickener. If you need too, ok to add a bit more  water to the broth and ok to use some light cream.

Very good! Minor changes - used four potatoes instead of five. Used half of a  white onion diced, instead of green onions. Only had half and half so used that instead of cream. Also followed others advice to omit the flour/water and used immersion blender to blend a few of the potatoes to thicken soup, leaving most potatoes whole pieces. Just added a bit of dried thyme. Delicious!

Simple comfort food.  Used leftover Christmas ham and hambone.  Made broth the day before and threw everything in my instant pot (Used 3 potatoes, 3 carrots, 2 celery stalkd, 1/2 yellow onion, 3/4 small head of cabbage and 3/4 bag frozen corn).  Turned out perfect.  Only seasoned with black pepper.  Will make again

This is very much lacking in flavor. I had to add 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp thyme just to make it edible enough to keep the pot of soup from going to waste.

Didn't boil the ham off the bone.  I used chicken bullion and leftover ham and then I used 2% milk instead of cream (cholesterol watchers!  It was very, very good...my husband's highest praise is "it was tasty!"  That doesn't happen often!

I think this is a wonderful use of leftover ham, etc. It is essentially Easter dinner in a bowl.  I blended the cabbage and potatoes rather than create the roux.  Amazingly delicious!

Very good. Had to make changes based on what we had. Ham bone had hardly ham on it, just a lot of fat, so didn’t use it.  It up some of the left over ham and cooked in the water for about an House. Used a cut up onion instead of green onions and added carrots to soup. Also did t measure things, just estimated amounts. Still turned out well. Our ham was. It salty, so added salt and pepper. Also, didn’t refrigerate stock, just skimmed fat off. It was very good. Cooking times were very accurate. Nice thing with this type of soup is the ability to add ingredients to your taste. Thanks for the recipe. I will make it again.

Excellent way to use that ham bone.  Much lighter than split pea soup.  The only changes I made were due to the fact that I had to substitute because I didn't want to run out to the store and used what I had on hand.  I used a white onion, so I threw in a bag of frozen peas which added the green color. I only had skim milk so I used coffee creamer instead and my son and husband loved it.  I plan on making it again very soon because I have another ham bone in the freezer.

This was a good soup for using up the meat off a ham bone.  Lots of flavour but my ham/ham bone was not very salty so I added salt and pepper to taste.  I also followed another person’s advice and put in a large carrot.  Gave it more colour and extra vegetable.  I will make it again for sure, might try putting in some thyme also.

Very tasty but I had to add a lot more liquid! Once I cooked the ham bone as instructed there wasn't enough liquid to make it soupy enough.

Traditionally I will make pea soup with my ham bones but when Allrecipes posted its ham bone soup I thought I would give it a try.  It was absolutely delicious!  Even my husband loved it!  I did do some additions that weren't in the recipe.  I added a whole onion, 2 tsp salt, and a 1/2 tsp pepper.  I was confused about the green onions in the recipe because it doesn't mention them again in the directions so I was assuming they were for garnish as in the photo.  The recipe makes a lot but you will eat it all!

This soup is very good and easy to make. I made two changes. The first is that we browned the flour and then added the water from what the ham cooked in. This is something my mother-in-law when making her cabbage soup and it adds a nice flavor.  The second change was adding ham base. My soup needed a little extra ham flavor.

I had cut most of the ham off the spiral cut shank bone.  When boiled it did not leave much flavor or meat.  I added chicken broth starter to the liquid and diced left over ham.  My family raved about it.  I used a potato masher at the end to thicken just a bit but left plenty of potato chunks.  The cabbage was surprisingly good in the soup.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe because I basically had all of the ingredients, and a few extra, that needed to be used up.  I added diced carrots, and a few extra brussel sprouts I had on hand. This soup/chowder turned out  great and was exceptionally flavorful.  I would also mention that I did not do the first step which said to cook the ham bone, cool etc. as I did not have the time to do that.  I recommend trying this recipe I don't think you will be disappointed.

Easily one of the best soups I've ever made. I used diced carrots, green onions, celery, potatoes and purple cabbage and chicken broth. I didn't add flour or cream, it was excellent as it was. I will definitely be making this again. Family loved it.

Delicious!  I’ve shared with family and friends. I did what someone else suggested and added corn - a small can, juice included, and roughly mashed the potatoes when they were cooked. You could not find a better comfort food. So filling and with meat (I used more than the recipe called for from leftovers), potatoes and vegetable, it was a full dinner  meal with a hearty, crusty bread.

Going low carb so I made this with zucchini instead of potatoes,  and I used white onions because I did not have green.  Added some herbs, garlic and pepper.   So delicious!

I used canned new potatoes and chives instead of green onions because that is what I had.  I also added heavy cream in the bowls instead of in the pot since it made so much I may need to freeze some.  Really good I don't usually follow recipes this closely but it had such good reviews I'm glad I made this really good.  I usually make split pea with my ham hock my husband never eats it this he loved.

I didn't want to make any changes but I did. In place of the cabbage I used brussel sprouts and I didn't have any celery. It turned out absolutely delicious. Excellent recipe!
Thank you!

This soup is a must!  This was out of this world good, the only change was I used heavy cream, instead of light, when the hubs got my order wrong!  Next time however, I going to try it with drop dumplings.

Great soup. I didn't have green onions, used white. I also didn't have cabbage so I boosted the volume of celery. The whole family enjoyed it on a cold day.

I had to pump up the seasonings as there was really no flavor at all; husband was not too crazy about it so doubt I'll be making it again.

Delicious! I made the broth and base just as noted. All I changed was to add two carrots for color and I subbed a shallot for the green onions because it's what I had. Hubby loved this and was 'sick' with hunger while the bone cooked and while the soup cooked. Poor guy! Even though I took the advice of another reviewer and planned to just skim after a few hours in the frig, I found I still needed 7+ hours in my frig to be able to peel off the fat.

I followed the recommendations and this soup was perfect. I pureed also and it came out nice and creamy. I eliminated the flour step to thicken. I used both celery and asparagus. Froze some so I will be able to enjoy again!!

This is by far the worst soup I have ever made. Has absolutely no flavor, never thickened and I followed the directions to a tee. Do yourself a favor. Don't waste you time or energy making this soup

Not sure what happened. I followed the recipe but added more ham because the bone I used had barely a cup of usable ham. The portion of cabbage and potato to broth and meat seemed way off from the start but I kept going.  It was so bland.  I used an immersion blender and half and half rather than the flour and whipping cream.  The broth was good as a base but in the end, there just wasn't enough meat. Also, I am pretty sensitive to salt but I had to add quite a bit of salt just find any flavor. My husband added a generous squirt of sriracha sauce to his bowl and my daughter found shredded cheese to be the answer to her bowl. Also, I found it strange the directions never said what to do with the onions, I threw them in with the rest of the veggies. (For future reviews, if the onion point is fixed before I edit this, please don't hurl pitchforks at me.).

I was unable to find a lite whipping cream, so added heavy whipping cream instead.  The recipe was was very good.  Will definitely make again!

The soup is delicious!  I added diced carrots to my recipe.  I will make this every time we have ham.  Letting the  broth cool overnight was a very good suggestion as there is quite of bit of fat that gets skimmed off the top.  I added leftover ham and did not use the meat that came off the bone.

This was really yummy! I don't normally eat cabbage, but this was an exception. My 7 year old polished off three bowls. The only thing I did differently was I added fennel and used chicken stock instead of water.  I'd absolutely make this again.

Awesome soup I will make it again and again!
I made a few changes by using rice instead of potatoes and adding carrots and niblet corn.
I also omitted the flour.
