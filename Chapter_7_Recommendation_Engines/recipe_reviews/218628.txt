Well first off. It is expensive to make, and it took me about 1 hour prep time. AND "Worth every minute". I hate meatloaf. BUT this recipe was not only good. It is Great. 10 Stars. I don't care about the price anymore, This meatloaf in my opinion is "Priceless". I'm hooked. Do try this recipe.

the meatloaf was a wonderful, meaty, manly meatloaf. My husband loved it. Leftovers will be great for sandwiches.
the tomato soup topping, not so much. waste of time. my husband thought it was ketchup anyway. skip it!

My husband said it was the "best meatloaf I've EVER, EVER had!" Although, I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I had almost 1.5 pounds of ground chicken and 1/2 pound of ground country pork sausage. I cooked the (3) carrots and (medium red) onion in chicken stock instead of beef. I also added about 1/2 cup of dry oats since it seemed like it was a little too loose. And for the topping I used cream of mushroom soup with the balsamic vinegar and a tablespoon of grainy stone ground mustard. I served it topped with sliced mushrooms that were sauteed in butter seasoned with basil, oregano, garlic and worcestershire sauce. Absolutely marvelous!!

This meatloaf is very moist and full of flavor!!! As a mom to 6 somewhat picky eaters I am hesitant about trying new recipes but my husband found it so we decided to try it. The only change I made was with the vinegar. I only had apple cider vinegar but it still came out delicious. While cooking in the oven the grease did spill over so I think next time I will put it in a bigger pan. Overall it was a great recipe! I will be making it again very soon. Thanks for sharing!

My picky teenager devoured it.  It was so tasty and not hard to make with a few extra minutes for prep time.  Used  catsup instead of tomato soup.

Well, I ignored all the pre cooking, mixed everything together and loaded into a loaf pan...and it turned out fantastic.  My only changes.... added one stalk of celery, cut up...and used a Bob Evans Hot sausage.. Great Comfort dish and much easier to make without all the precook ingredients.

This loaf wasn't very flavorful. I was very surprised at the reviews that raved about it.  I prefer uncooked veggies in my meatloaf. It also cooked over and made quite a mess. This recipe is going in the trash.

Best. Meatloaf. Ever.
And I thought I made good meatloaf before trying this one...there's no going back now as this is probably the best meatloaf I've ever eaten. Ever.

This meatloaf was not only moist, but it was very tasty as well.  My family loved it served with mashed potatoes and green beans. A winner!

Have tried a number of meatloaf recipes.  This is by far the best.  I've given up my search.

Very tasty!  I like how the different meats play off each other.  Rating for 4 stars due to prep time.  This one takes a little time to put together, but it's probably worth it in the end.
