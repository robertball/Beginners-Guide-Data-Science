Great old fashion recipe,but if you want it a little bit sweeter and more modern in taste,(like the canned poppy seed) all you need to do is add corn syrup.I made a double batch and added 1/2 a cup. Adding honey also makes it great too!THRILLED with this recipe either way!

FABULOUS !!  Having many exchange students in the house over the past few years, from all over Europe, this filling reminded them all of grandma back home.  Thanks Hepzibah!

This recipe is perfect.  Much better than canned poppy seed filling.  I didn't change a thing.  I  combined the filling with crushed walnuts . I made a sweet dough and rolled the filling up in the dough to make my family's traditional Christmas poppy seed rolls.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I know longer can get fresh ground poppy seeds, and I find that the canned version bakes too from the corn syrup. This is perfect. The only difference I make is to add grated lemon zest--about 1/8 cup.

Came out awesome!  Made it last year at Christmas  for my mom and it reminded her of her granmothers' from Czechoslovakia when she was a little girl.  She lost the original recipe and couldn't believe I found one that was so good.  I even found a vintage grinder which worked beautiful.  Thanks so much! Will be making again this year!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I can't get Solo brand in Northern Alberta so have to make from scratch.  I changed it a tiny bit.  I was out of eggs so I used 4 tablespoons of arrow root flour instead.  The food processor took time to grind the poppyseed up but eventually worked well.  This is by far better than the canned.  I'm never going to miss it again.  I'm so very happy right now.

Very smooth taste, perfect component ratios.

I added a bit more sugar because I was using it with commercial unsweetened  puff pastry, used salted cream butter instead of margarine, ans skipped salt.

The cooking instructions could have been optimized, perhaps. This is what I have done to speed up custard preparation:
1)Started the oven to 150F and placed a sauce pan inside to preheat;
2) Beat eggs till foam forms and color changes to lighter yellow; Mixer helps.
3) While eggs were being mixed, I placed cream butter in a 2-cup Pirex measuring cup and melted it in microwave;
4) Added milk to melted butter and boiled in a microwave (about 2 min on high );
5) Added sugar to boiled milk and stirred to dissolve, reheated for 20 sec;
6) Slowly poured boiling milk/butter into eggs while running mixer.
7) Took  the warm sauce pan from the oven and pour ed milk/egg mixture in it, continued cooking custard on a cook top as directed in the recipe.

I use this  filling with puff pastry sheets , making a roll, or tart.

This recipe was wonderful! I like that it is a bit less sweet than some other poppy seed fillings I have tried. I only had almond milk in my fridge so I used that instead of cow's milk and it still turned out great!

A GOOD basic recipe with good results.  BUT, coming from an old Bohemi(64) who was surrounded by a family of Bohemis and the old Bohemi lady friends of my Mom at our church(St. Wenceslaus, Iowa City) you should use only egg whites not whole eggs and beaten to fluff and folded into cooked poppy seed.  And yes you do need the zest of a whole lemon.  Watched my Mom make Kolaches and Poppy Seed Coffee Cake for 30 years before she passed, so poppy seed is in my blood.

Thanks for sharing this!  We were always able to get Solo filling in Detroit but no where to be found in NW Fla.  We used the recipe as written except substituted the milk with condensed milk and presoaked the poppyseeds.

I made this to fill hamentaschen because my mom loves poppyseed filling. I only had 1/4 poppy seeds, so I halved everything and mixed in lemon worth of zest at the end. Came out really delicious!
