I give it 4 stars because when I make this by the recipe cooking the noodles in the dish, they always turn out chewy which I dont like. So now I prepare them seperately and use half the water called for then add them cooked before adding the sour cream. I also use a can of sliced mushrooms and I season the beef with garlic powder and steak seasoning before cooking! Delicious!

I was worried this would turn out like Hamburger Helper since I've never made Stroganoff with the noodles cooked into it but it turned out delicious!  My husband is just so-so on Stroganoff but he had two helpings and there's barely enough for my leftover lunch today.  I didn't have condensed beef broth so I just used bullion and that worked fine.  Also used egg noodles but just because that's how mom always made it.  Would add fresh mushrooms next time to make it extra good!  Yum!

I used egg noodles instead of the spiral pasta and to make it go further, I doubled the soup, beef broth, water, sour cream and pasta.  Was an instant hit :) Thanks!

So I was not excited when the family said they wanted stroganoff, (I don't like stroganoff, at least most of the time) But this one was a good one. Fast and easy to do. Didn't have corkscrew noodles but the egg noodles I did have worked really well. Will definitely hang on to this recipe.

My husband loved this dish. I used ground round and chicken broth since that is what I had open and added half a can of sliced button mushrooms. I cut the worcestershire in half because I know my husband isn't a fan of the taste. Easy to fix and I will make this for my husband again. He didn't even mention that it was macaroni and not the traditional egg noodles. It's a hit.

VERY Good!  Easy to make and all 5 of my children loved it!  There were no leftovers and one of my children asked if they could have it again tomorrow.  This recipe is absolute keeper!!  Only change I made was to add about 1 tsp of garlic salt and 1/2 cup of creme cheese.

I'm loving this recipe on a weeknight given the time it takes to cook and in only 1 pot!  Husband and kids were lapping it up.  Will make again soon

I love this! And everyone I've made it for has loved it. I've not had one person not get 2nd's and sometimes 3rd's (I may be the culprit on that). I usually have a hard time getting the meat to come out tender so I have tried several different cuts in order to get one that comes out tender. So far I have found one but sadly do not remember what it was. I think it was a small roast and I just cut into small strips. So far the best noodles I've used are the spirals it calls for, I like the way it holds alot of the sauce.   I have made this for someone who doesn't like the way the sour cream made it taste so I left it out and made it as just beefy noodles and it was still very tastey! I usually add a little salt and garlic to mine, and I like the flavor of the worcestershire sauce in this so a little more than the amount that is called for typically goes in.  I'm planning to make this again VERY SOON and plan to add some fresh mushrooms this time. I also wonder how it would taste if a can of the Campbell's beefy mushroom is added with it. I want to try another reviewers idea and make with the golden mushroom soup, it is one of my favorite soups!  I'd definately recommend giving this a try, you can alter it to your tastes if something isn't quite right. And will feed an army!

This was nice and easy.  Unfortunately, due to food allergies we had to make without mushroom, which is so essential for the best stroganoff!  I substituted vegetable broth, making a cream soup out of it.  Used the beef broth and then gluten free spiral noodles, which worked well cooking in the broth.  I like things pretty saucy so could have used more overall; If you like saucy I would cook pasta by itself then add to soups.  Everyone liked this.  Thanks.

This was very good. Made this for a quick lunch.  I did add fresh ground pepper to the beef as it was cooking. I used thin sliced frozen beef as used for cheesesteak. Other than that followed the recipe exactly.

For a shortcut recipe, its good and I will make again.  I precooked the pasta and added steak spice to the meat as suggested by another reviewer.  But that was just for my own preference.

I actually changed this a lot just bec. I was looking for a recipe to make quickly with the few ingredients that I had. I made it with long pasta, chicken broth, no beef, golden mushroom soup, and half-n-half instead of sour cream. Guess what?! It was still delicious, so I am adding it to my recipe box and making it correctly next time. Delicious!
