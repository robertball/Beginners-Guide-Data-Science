This was good and would make it again  but.... I have a secret.  I make lettuce wraps all the time but I use chicken teriyaki pineapple meatballs  already cooked.  You can get them at Costco and most other markets.  Just chop them up add water chestnuts, mushrooms and shredded carrots. Stir in some oyster sauce and soy sauce to taste and you've got your filling. Use butter lettuce for the wrappers and garnish with cilantro, green onions, and crispy wonton strips. Use your favorite sauce (we like sweet hot chili sauce and peanut sauce. Hoisin is good too)  it is much easier on a busy weeknight.

These are just as good, if not better, than PF Changs/Pei Wei's version.  Sure there is a lot of chopping and sure the ingredient list is long, but it's all easy stuff to chop and all of the ingredients are things I keep in my kitchen most of the time anyway.  The payoff is worth the trouble.  The flavor is really complex and delicious and there's just a little bit of kick from the hot pepper.  I served them with Bibb lettuce instead of iceberg and I also made a mix of radish, carrots, bell pepper, jalapeno, cilantro and rice wine vinegar, salt and sugar that added just the right amount of fresh.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.

Didn't use water chestnuts because of an allergy and let sit in the fridge about 2 hours to marinate... Also used romain instead of ice burg because that's all I had (recommend getting the head of lettuce).  Besides that followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.

My husband and I loved this!  It took me a long time to make it bc I made the mistake of buying chicken thighs with skin and bone...oops!  So yeah, I felt like my grandmother slaving over a hot stove for 2 hours only I was over my chopping board, skinning the thighs, then deboning them.  Ugh!! Then, my measuring spoons are plastic, so the words are half gone and I mistook tablespoon with teaspoon on a few occasions...double yikes!  Umm can you tell I don't cook much yet?  So anyhoo, even with all those challenges we both loved this cool spin on lettuce wraps.  I made it again the following week exactly how the recipe said I should and got a completely different taste...almost Middle Eastern curry-ish...double yum!  So yeah, if you fudge on the brown sugar too much or not enough, you are still golden.  I didn't do the water chestnuts, my husband is a man-child and would spit them out like Peter on Family Guy :)

I've made this twice now. The first time, strictly to finally use up some ground chicken I had in my freezer. The second time, I used chicken thighs , and -- wow!-- what a difference. They were both very good, but the juiciness of the thigh meat really added so much to the texture and flavor.

I had to modify this a bit because I strongly dislike mushrooms. (The flavor, the texture, the fact that they're a fungus...) I followed just about everything else to the letter, omitting the mushrooms and about 5 ounces of chicken to keep the vegetable ratio true to its original recipe. I used a sweet onion versus yellow because it's all I had on hand.

My hubby absolutely loved this, but was disappointed that I didn't include the mushrooms. :-P

I can't get ground chicken.   I have made this with cooked chicken chopped finely, chicken breasts that I chopped finely, and lastly with ground turkey.    This is an awesome recipe.   It is absolutely delicious.   I haven't been able to cook it for 10-15 minutes; it starts to burn at about 7 minutes.   Pans and stove temperatures can vary, obviously.   This is a wonderful, wonderful recipe.

This recipe was a LOT of work for mediocre results. Other than using cremini mushrooms and dicing the chicken quite small, I followed the recipe as written. The result lacked the bold Asian taste I was hoping for, so I added 2-3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce which helped. I also whipped up 2 dipping sauces and served with chopped peanuts. Every other Chef John recipe I've tried has been wonderful, but I will not make this one again.
Sauce 1: 1tsp sesame oil, 2T soy, 2T rice vinegar, 1T chili paste, 1tsp brown sugar.
Sauce 2: 1/3c mayo, 1tsp sriracha sauce, 1tsp chili oil, 1tsp lime juice.

OMG, so much work and so LITTLE flavor.  I make chicken lettuce wraps all the time with a fraction of these ingredients and they are always a hit.  Thought I would go above and beyond and expected too much I guess with all these ingredients.  Flat, they were tasteless.  I kept running to frig to add this and that -   Sorry Chef John, always love your stuff , but not these.

Absolutely awesome! I needed something healthy to kick start the New Year and this was a great way to go! I made some accidents along the way, but they paid off! I didn't use dry mustard because I forgot I didn't have it on hand and I accidentally used red wine vinegar instead of rice. I also used a dash of garlic salt and Simply Asia's Sweet Ginger Garlic seasoning to give it a kick, in addition to a dash of ground cayenne pepper.

Nice enough flavor, but I would not want to make a meal out of this because it seems a little rich.  Served with Thai-Style Peanut Sauce from this site, shredded carrots, diced green onions and Butter Lettuce.   Husband said he liked it, which is basically a miracle, so it is worth giving a try, even though it seems overly complicated for a wrap (see long list of ingredients and three steps in the cooking process).

Really enjoyed this recipe!  I found it helpful to cook in smaller batches (or use a very large skillet) over very high heat, with minimal stirring/scraping.  This gives the liquids enough room to evaporate and does a nice job of caramelizing everything.  Also, these wraps go really well with sweet chili sauce from your local Asian grocer (I suggest Mae Ploy).  Once again, a winner from Chef John

Wonderful!  I added some diced red peppers, and then some peanuts near the end to add a little crunch.  Thanks  for sharing it Chef John!!

Chef John does it again! I made this as our main dish as written and we loved it. The only difference I noticed is this recipe isn't salty like the restaurant's version - and that's a good thing for us. I felt like I was serving a delicious, healthy dinner. If we had gone out to eat it would have been a decadent appetizer followed by a gut busting dinner.

Twenty-two ingredients!  Although the end product was very good, I end up with lots of ingredient leftovers for one dish.  I'll make this for special occasions only.

Made this for my teenage nephew and son, they devoured all of it with iceberg lettuce wraps.  I did not have the chestnuts or mushroom caps, but either way it was very good. Small suggestion: decrease the ginger its a bit overpowering and decrease the brown sugar to half.  Also I found it easier to cook all of step #1 prior to mixing it all together.

I didn't like it but my family did.  But they have never had the lettuce wraps from PF Chang's.  I actually had to use siracha on top to give it some flavor.  I doubled the sauce recipe but it was still to dry.  I won't be making this again.  Sorry Chef John, I usually really like your recipes!

The flavor for these was excellent.  I did not grind up the chicken, but cut chicken thighs into small chunks. I would likely do it the same again, but make them a bit smaller.  As a result, however, I had to cook them a lot longer during the initial Step 3 in order to cook them through.  They were more time consuming than I anticipated.  Leftovers tasted even more flavorful the next day!

The first time I made it; it turn out fine. I made it again but I made sure to cooked it on high heat.  That made a big difference. The first time, the chicken was a light brown with a lot of juice. The second time, it was a dark brown color and no juice.

This is a tasty dinner.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the Asian wraps.  I will  definitely make this again. I only had dehydrated basil to add at the end.  I can only imagine how much better fresh basil would have been.

We thought this recipe was delicious, still I plan to adjust it a bit.  No ketchup (reminded me of meatloaf!).  I will try straw mushrooms, as I heard they are used by PFC.  I also think I'll use a bit more sesame oil.  I love Chef John's videos!

FABULOUS!!!!!  Followed the instructions to a tee, except doubled up on the delicious and flavorful glaze, Highly labor intensive, but worth it!

I've never eaten at P.F. Chang's so I had no experience to compare this to but I do a fair amount of Asian cooking and am familiar with typical ingredients so, in reading the recipe, I had a good idea of how it might taste.  
We enjoyed this dish very much and the changes I made were only with some ingredient amounts, based on personal preference.
I never use Iceberg lettuce but took your advice and you were absolutely correct about the cool, crisp, crunch of the lettuce in contrast with the heat and texture of the chicken; perfect ly played off each other!
Hubby is going to use the leftovers (less than 1/2 cup) to scramble with eggs in the morning.
Thanks for the recipe.

big hit with our guests!  easy to prepare, super flavorful and easy to make in advance if needed.   although a lot of chopping as I doubled the recipe.  A food processor will be in order next time!

This is yummy but my family agreed that it needs a bit more flavor- salt and pepper for sure and will add maybe 2 Tbsp of either hoisin sauce or oyster sauce for more depth of flavor.

I needed to use up some precooked chicken, so I cooked off the onions and my dried mushrooms (all I had, but I keep them on hand for this reason) then threw in my diced chicken and all the other ingredients.  Finished off with the basil and cilantro as instructed.  Came together great for a quick one pan meal.  Some dipping sauces and Sriracha let everyone get the flavor intensity they were looking for.  Leftovers are even better, and can be eaten cold or warmed.

We loved these.  The chopping of the veggies is no big deal but chopping those chicken thighs took a LONG time!  I don't have a Chinese cleaver but just not sure it would really chop through anyway so that's the tough part.  I may try to do a chop in the food processor next time.  We also thought we'd like some dipping sauce just because that's what we are used to with lettuce wraps so may try to look up a couple sauces.  7-5-19

This recipe turned out absolutely fabulous. I misread the recipe and bought dried shiitake mushrooms but we could not tell a difference once soaking them. Maybe a bit spongier. One thing: there is no way that cooking the chicken for 2 minutes would make it appear not raw. It took much longer than that. None of the ingredients seemed over cooked. Will for sure make this again.

I added to everything else:  baby corns, red peppers, and 1tsp of black Chinese vinegar.  Also: I used a wok at high heat and reduced the last half of the glaze.  Blow away good.

So far this is the only Chef John recipe that I have not liked enough to repeat.  It is not bad, but there is a lot of chopping involved and I do not like the flavors as much as the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken dish.  It has been a while since I have been to PF Chang's, but I remember liking the wraps more.

Really loved this recipe, the flavor was great.  I found it pretty simple to make. Swapped the chicken out and made it vegetarian by using Morningstar  veggie crumbles. Will be making again for sure!

This was actually really easy to make and it was delicious!  I added peanuts at the end when I was adding the cilantro and it added really great favour.  This was a big hit

It was good, but I don't think I'd make again. Really looking for only 4-5 start recipes.

This was delicious. I had to sub in apple cider vinegar  so I added an extra teaspoon of brown sugar also used romaine instead of iceberg.  Topped with scallions, radishes, and basil. radish added a nice spice against the sweet. Yum!

Followed recipe without any changes other than needing to cook a little longer to reach caramelization! The whole family loved this, even my 7 year old granddaughter.

I really like this recipe--way better than almost any other recipe for lettuce wraps. The only thing I would suggest is using ground chicken instead of chicken thighs. I think chicken thighs are finicky to deal with, as you really should trim the fat off before chopping them up. The texture is a tiny bit better with chicken thighs, but ground chicken is way faster and tastes just as good.

This was delicious.  I made it for a party and it was a big hit.  People noted how much chopping it was but I didn't feel it was any more than usual.  The flavor was nice and balanced not too salty.

My boyfriend and I have been on a diet for a little while and were looking for a healthy new addition to our menu.  This is AMAZING. We made a few changes; we used chicken breasts, and baby Bella mushrooms instead of shiitake, also white wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar.  We also used green cabbage instead of ice burg lettuce. And let me tell you, that is the single best switch we made. Seriously, try it! Lastly, we halved the recipe. Perfect amount for two people!

Delicious. Loved this recipe.  Tasty option for lower fat / carb meal.   A lot of ingredients, but goes  together quickly.  To save time I will prep additional  chicken with marinade and freeze several portions.  Makes an easy week night meal.  When cooking meat be sure to use a high enough heat and long enough cook time to carmelize.  Looking for a nice brown color.  Really adds to flavor.  Tip:  Tried a double recipe and got too much liquid from meat. Was boiling more than browning.  Had to pull off some meat juice so it would brown and then added sauce.  Next time will use 2 large skillets for double batch.  Have also made version using ground turkey, brown rice and corn.  Less prep time and just as tasty.

Made just as written - and as the others exclamed - a lot of ingredients and chopping.  I had almost everything already - just needed waterchestnuts and rice wine vinegar.  The waterchestnuts, although by themselves are bland - do soak up the other ingredients and become tasty addition.  Now that I have made it once - I would cut back a bit on the red pepper flakes - whew spicy - add a sprnkle of salt at the end (I used low sodiium soy)) and I think the 2 tablespoons of oil is listing in the wrong place in the recipe..... I don't think it  is supposed to be part of the sauce but rather to sitrfry the chicken mixture which was slightly oily made as written.  My husband and I made a meal of these along with watermelon for a summer day.  Just enough for him to take the rest for lunch to work the next day.  Thanks Chef John - I know I'm in for a treat when your name is part of the title! PS even  sliced up radishes as shown for garnish!

This recipe is wonderful!  My whole family loved it.  It takes a bit of time to put together the first few times I made it, but this has become a staple in my home and it goes together pretty quickly now that I have the rhythm down.  Thanks again Chef John :)

I make this a lot during the summer.  I use rotisserie chicken as a hack for a quicker process! Just cook the veggie mixture and then add shredded or chopped cooked chicken.  The sauce really is the key. Butter lettuce is a little sturdier than the Iceberg but also more expensive.  My boys can't get enough of these.

It's a bit of prep, but worth it!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was tasty with tender chicken and a nice mix of textures with the veggies.  We just used iceberg and it was a nice neutral wrap for the slightly spicy, Asian  infused mixture.   Will definitely make again!

This recipe was a lot of work with the prep of chopping up the ingredients,  but worth the effort!  The only change I made was I substituted honey for the brown sugar in both the main recipe and the glaze.  Perfect  for those looking for low carb recipes!

Never made  Chef John recipe that failed to please. I've made this twice and follow the recipe pretty closely (except I think I've used butter lettuce instead of iceberg and the shitakes always look so sad at my grocery store so I use buttons or criminis). It makes quite a bit but the leftovers are pretty good too.

I've made these several times. I've tried some shortcuts, including using ground chicken instead of chopping thighs and they were still good. I've also done them with a tube of ginger paste and that works well too. This recipe is a keeper.

I added 4 cloves of garlic to the chicken mixture,  subbed apple cider vinegar for the rice because of allergy, and subbed mustard for the mustard powder because I was out, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was excellent! I served it with a sauce modeled after the one PF Chang's serves. I mixed 2 to 1 soy sauce and water, then spooned in Chinese mustard and siracha (because I am out of chili paste), and a splash of vinegar to taste.

Fantastic. It got rave reviews. Pretty much followed the recipe. (Added cashews and an extra TBSP ketchup). Had it as lettuce wraps the first day and then over rice the second. Tasted even better the second day. Will be making it again this week end.

Excellent. All guests for dinner wanted the recipe. I followed the recipe but substituted sugar free syrup for brown sugar because of diabetics in the guests. Still turned out great!  Left overs were fought over the next day. Will absolutely do again !

The chicken had a very nice flavor. I used thighs and breasts. I pulsed them in my food processor to make things a little easier. We liked the texture. No leftovers.

This was a big hit with my family of 5. I ended up thickening the sauce with flour, because there was too much liquid. Other than that, yummy!

First, I want to thank Chef John for using measuring  cup amounts for things like the onion, scallions, mushrooms, etc. Although I cook a lot and pretty much know what a recipe that calls for a small onion, a tomato, button mushrooms, etc. means, for those just beginning to cook, it might be hard for them to determine what the difference between a 'small onion' and a 'large onion' might be. Produce really does range in size. But a cup is a cup. For the recipe itself, great job!! It's delicious.

Omitted water chestnuts and it was super delicious.  Used butter bib lettuce.....I would highly recommend that lettuce.

This was amazing and much better than the restaurant version.  Everyone in my family loved it, and no one ever seems to agree on recipes.  I did use chicken breast meat, even though Chef John said to use chicken thigh meat. I don't like the fat content in chicken thigh meat and the dish was still delicious, moist, and tender. I will definitely be making this one again and often.

Loved this, and surprisingly the kids did too!  I added shredded carrots in with the chicken mixture and sliced up some radishes to top with.  I didn't have the basil, but I think the cilantro on it's own was fine.  Very flavorful!

Wow, we loved these! I took the easy route and chopped everything (including the chicken thighs) in the food processor. I accidentally spilled too many red pepper flakes but it made it a spice level that we like.

This is one of the tastiest things I've ever made!!  Once you've got the prep done it goes really fast! Don't leave out the water chestnuts, they add SO much texturally, a really awesome crunch! My boyfriend and I make this all the time and fight over who gets the leftovers!

I made this over the weekend.  I followed the recipe 99% of the time.  The only thing I had to compromise on was the mustard.... I didn't have dry mustard on-hand so I used prepared horseradish mustard.  Even with a variation on the mustard the recipe resulted in a flavor that is just like the restaurant version.  I also made a sauce for it made of peanut butter (+/- 1 tsp., hot water to thin it, soy sauce and a few drops of tabasco.  Mix to taste.)  Everything was great!  Thanks for sharing an awesome recipe.

Only thing I added was a little more brown sugar (about 1.5 TBS) This recipe is supposed to serve 8, but that doesn't include one big guy and a teenage boy! lol I did let it sit for a couple of hours. I may add some chopped Bok Choy next time. This was a huge hit, we'll be having it again soon, thanks Chef John!
