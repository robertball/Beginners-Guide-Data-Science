I made this recipe. My family yelled because they were so happy (I think). They didn't eat much of it though because they were too excited. I have a crazy family!

My whole family actually rates this pretty high with the changes that I made. I first baked just the fish sticks at the temp on the box for about half the time the box calls for. This allows them to crisp up a bit before adding the soup. Then I poured over the soup mixture. We used cream of mushroom and Nature's Seasons instead just because of taste preference. Then on top of the soup I put tator tots instead of french fries. Then some shredded cheddar on top of that. Baked the whole thing at 400 for 25 minutes. Came out really good and the tator tots stayed crisp being on top. The whole thing is still a casserole consistency but not overly soupy at all the way I made it.

If I could give this recipe a 0 I would. It was mushy and gross. My kids wouldn't eat it.

After reading all the reviews I made this dish with an open mind. I warned my husband that it may be good or it may be bad. I can say it was not horrible but I will not make it again. Since I have eaten fish sticks for many years prepared the way the directions read on the package I am used to eating them like that. The sauce the cream of celery milk mayo and curry made on the top of the fish sticks and french fries might be better if used as a dipping sauce for the fish sticks instead of they way the recipe calls for. Like I said earlier it was not horrible but I will not make it again.

This was pretty good. I used cream of mushroom soup and I added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.

This recipe was really good. The curry powder is very important don't skip using it. Think of this dish as a casserole not as fish and chips. It's not crunchy it's creamy. My family really liked it.

This tasted good but the texture was lousy. My "crunchy" Van De Kamp fish sticks turned out to be a goopy soupy mess. They totally disintegrated! I would not make this again. The fries and fish sticks would have been better if I had just baked them on a cookie sheet.

My whole family like this one! We hardly ever use curry so this was a nice "spice" to change the bland into something delicious. Thanks!!
