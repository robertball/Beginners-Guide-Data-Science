This sauce was great for our St. Patty's Day dinner. I didn't have any mint jelly so I substituted black cherry jam and it was wonderful and tangy!

I just loved this & didn't think it could get any better! Kudos to Great Grandma Murphy! Being a mustard fan I took a small amount & stirred some in & it was like heaven! I will keep & use this often!

Too much of a ketchupy taste for me didn't care for the combination of ingredients. I also tried it with lamb as well as with the corned beef and didn't like it with the lamb either.

Superb. I read the reviews saying it used too much tomato sauce so I started with half a cup. It needed some more however so I added a good slurp of tomato sauce. This will be a sauce I use for many meals. It would be great with Lamb or with Turkey even. Try it; you will love it.

I agree with the other reviewer in the fact there was too much ketchup. Other than that this was a good sauce.
