The first time I made these chops they were okay, but with a couple of tweaks, these pork chops are terrific! The second time I prepared them, I seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. I also cooked the chops at a lower temperature (medium high) to prevent burning. Finally, I served them with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce found here on allrecipes (1/2 cup orange marmalade, 1/4 cup Dijon mustard, 1/4 cup honey, and 1/4 teaspoon hot sauce). If you're using a thick cut pork chop, I suggest pounding it to make it thinner or placing the thick pork chops in the oven to finish cooking after browning. All in all, this recipe is a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing.

My family's been making pork katsu as long as I can remember, so here's a tip since the recipe doesn't mention it: pound the meat! It makes all the difference in texture and tenderness. Serving tonkatsu sauce is a must as well.

Incredible!!! I've been wanting to make this using the Panko crumbs which I've never used!  I finally bought Panko crumbs on line and I will NEVER NEVER EVER go back to using regular breadcrumbs!!!!  I've been expermenting with these crumbs now whenever breadcrumbs are called for and these Panko crumbs ROCK!!!!  Thanks submitter!  Update: Since discovering Panko crumbs I found a recipe for chicken on this site called Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce - It is also a 5 star+ recipe and the Tonkatsu sauce is also great with these pork chops.  I've actually had these in a Japanese restaurant with the sauce!

I've been looking for a good katsu recipe, and came across this one last year which I have now made close to a dozen times. This is so good, that I haven't had to modify it too much. Suggestions to try though: Add a splash of sesame oil to your deep frying oil for a blast of asian flavor. Make sure the meat is thin, less then a 1/4" thick is good. If thick meat, lower the temp of the oil to prevent the breading from scorching before the meat is cooked thru. Season your meat before coating and breading. Use powdered garlic and ginger instead of fresh minced since they are easier to incorporate into the egg or into the panko. Use fresh crushed Tien Tsin Chili pepper (little red asian pepper) added to panko for added heat (caution: a little adds a lot of heat). Tonkatsu sauce (or any sauce) is critical for this...I use store bought Bull-Dog Vegetable & Fruit Tonkatsu Sauce (can order online if not at your local asian market) instead of making my own which I can't get to taste as good as this.Enjoy!

Very tasty recipe...marinating and tenderizing (pounding) before making it helps.  Also, the CUT of meat you use is KEY.  If it is dry, you prob used cheap meat.  In Japan we have HIRE (white meat) and ROSU (dark meat) - even good quality white meat will be super juicy.

Of course this dish does not stand alone - you NEED sauce! The Japanese do not eat this without sauce...it would be the unthinkable.  Please try authentic Tonkatsu sauce, or...if in a pinch, some A1 steak sauce.  Don't try it w/out some dressing, otherwise it is pointless to make it.  :(  

Served with thinly sliced lettuce salad, mini tomatoes for presentation...great.  Lettuce reduces...er compliments the greasiness of the fried meat.  Also, if you have non-meat lovers, the same technique can be used for SHRIMP.  Very tasty...but be sure to cut the tail to prevent juices from flying, and make incisions along the body to make the shrimp stand straight after frying.

Fat-concerned folks: please fry panko in oil...then do like 'shake and bake' - then...bake...similar results...not AS tasty but definitely easier on the waist.

This tastes great! As many reviewers mentioned, it is important to lightly coat the chops in four, egg then the panko so the coating will stick. Do let the coated chops sit for the optional time before frying as it really helps the coating stick! I didn't pound out my chops (forgot) but as they were only slightly thicker than 1/4 inch (maybe about 1/2 inch) I just cooked them at a lower temperature for a little longer. I seasoned the flour with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also added a little hot sauce (splash or two) to the egg mixture and left the panko plain. Serve this with 'Tonkatsu/Katsu' sauce from this site, it's great!

This recipe was enjoyed by the entire family. Served with a tangy tonkatsu sauce & rice, there were no leftovers. Looking fwd to making them again, but i'll get more panko next time.

Yum! I just made this for dinner and paired it with katsu sauce recipe that I found on this website too. My family loved it so much. In the process of cooking I added flour with seasoned salt, pepper and garlic powder. Egg mixture was not enough for the 8 chops so I doubled it as well as the panko crumbs with red pepper flakes. After dipping the chops I let them rest in the freezer for an hour or two. Then I fried it in hot vegetable oil with a splash of sesame oil. Have my fire set on low then fry each side for about 5 minutes until golden brown. The only thing that I regret about is I forgot to season the chops with garlic powder and ground ginger, I'll do that again next time though. Thank you Shin98 =)

This is a good recipe. The garlic makes it a little more interesting than plain panko breading, but you're still going to need sauce. If you like bold, spicy katsu like I do, I suggest the Tonkatsu/Katsu Sauce by SOIFUA on this site. Thanks!

Crunchy goodness. I made a sauce for the chops using soy sauce, woosie sauce, and ketchup. Served over white rice with scallions. Wonderful! Thanks for sharing.

Loved this.  I used 4 pork chops and kept all other measurements the same (based on 8 servings).  Whipped up the Tonkatsu/Katsu sauce from this site as well.  Delicious.

I really enjoyed this recipe...my only critique would be to start the oil at a lower temp.  I didn't pound out the pork chops so to get them cooked all the way through, the crust was almost burnt.  The crust however was wonderfully crisp, it gave the meat a nice crunch.

I love this recipe, I would make it twice a month. What helps me a lot too with the preparing is using about 2lbs of the pork scaloppini this is already supper thin and the frying time is fast. My family love them both ways with or without the tonkatsu sauce. We eat it along with hot white rice, finadenni sauce and kimichee. Yum!

Oh YUM! To be honest- this is my first experience frying something for real- in a frying pan.  It was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The secret may be in the thinness of the pork chops.  Also- we put some tonkatsu sauce on them once served.  But some we just put a little lemon juice on- both were delicious! Served over a bed of rice with a side of fresh steamed broccoli.  I will make this recipe OFTEN.

I am now in love with Panko bread crumbs!!!  I really didn't think they would make much of a difference, even after reading the other reviews, but, WOW!!  They are so light, airy, and crunchy - so much better than regular bread crumbs!  This recipe over all was good, but I do think that it is missing a little bit of something.  I served the pork chops with sweet and sour sauce, which complimented them nicely, but it would have been nice to have a little more flavor in the actual pork chops so the sauce wouldn't be necessary.  My husband said to definitely keep this recipe around!

I used tenderloin pork and I pounded the pork into a thinner cutlet and then did the coating. They were excellent. I plan on making them again.

I'm trying this right NOW! I have 3 chops that I've de-boned and cut down into 9 equal size pieces. Then starting with the smallest pieces, lightly pound flat. Working up with the larger pieces, pound to same thickness as the smaller one. Marinade with soy sauce, hoisin sauce and a little Chinese 5 spice for half an hour. Then follow along with the rest of the directions. Will be served with lemon basmati rice, buttered carrot coins and leftover turkey dressing.   I will tell you later how it turns out.

These were very good, I agree with others that you need to add a little more seasoning either to the crumbs or the eggs. I first dipped the chops in the crumbs and then eggs and back in crumbs. This made them perfect with a light coating, the family really enjoyed them...thanks.

This was ok, but definitely use THIN cut pork chops, otherwise your panko will burn before your chops are cooked.  Also, could use some extra seasoning either on the chops before dipping, or in the panko.

I did not follow this recipe to a T, but my family gobbled up every bite.  I had 2 huge boneless, skinless pork chops (from Costco) that were about 1-1/2 inches thick, so I sliced them accordingly and that's what I used.  I first dipped them in parmesan cheese, then egg and then the Panko. They turned out great and my son ate more than I expected.  I made some tonkatsu sauce, which I did not care for.  Would probably make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Just made them tonight. The few changes I made were I used duck eggs (I know...kinda random) which added to the richness of the coating. I also allowed the meat to rest in the egg/milk bath for about 30 minutes with some additional garlic added. After the resting period I quickly breaded and sear fried in oil which I had added additional garlic and shallots. The chops came out super moist and tender with a savory crisp coating.

A few tweaks and this recipe is awesome. First add a tsp of oil for each egg in your egg wash, this will prevent crust from separating from the meat. Second spritz the panko crumbs with water 5 minutes before use, this will result in a lighter and crispier crust. Third the oil should be at 350, if you don't have a thermometer drop a piece of panko in the oil if it immediately rises to the top it's around 350. Lastly add a layer of flour before your eggwash. Also tenderize and season your meat before breading

The only reason I am giving this 4 rather than 5 stars is because I used a couple of the tweaks from other reviews. I dredged the pork chops in gluten free all purpose flour first. Instead of panko I used cornflake crumbs in order to keep the recipe gluten free and I added seasoning to each step of the dredging.
This was fabulous. My family raved and pork chops are generally a hit or miss in my house. They came out super juicy and flavorful. Will use this recipe again!

Great pork chops. I did the double dip and let them set about 10 minutes before pan frying. I used canola oil to fry them.  I used garlic powder in place of fresh minced garlic. Dipped them in Dynamite Sauce from this site. Great dinner.

Solid simple tonkatsu recipe.  I probably would have added a little more salt (could just have been the sea salt I was using was a bit on the light side).

We enjoyed this recipe by borrowing others' suggestions for seasoning, but it would have been bland as written.  Also, I needed considerably more breadcrumbs & egg mixture to coat my pork chops; also had to lower the temperature to avoid burning.  So, while I think the recipe could use some work, I'm really happy with the idea and we did enjoy the meal.  Probably won't make this often due to the calorie count, but it was a fun change from our usual. Thanks for sharing.

Overall I thought this recipe was ok. I think I should have used a thinner slice of pork. I had a difficult time getting it cooked thoroughly. However, the texture was great :D. Classic panko crunch

Even though the egg mixture is already seasoned with salt and pepper, I also seasoned the chicken separately with garlic salt/pepper prior to dipping.  Like others have said - pound the meat!!  The egg mixture wasn't enough for my 4 chicken breasts, so I had to double the mixture.  Ate it with the Kikkoman brand Tonkatsu sauce that you can find at most markets.  Yum!

LOVE IT!! We make this all the time. Everytime we go to a Japanese restaurant one or both of us would always order tonkatsu and pay at least 12 bucks or more for it. This taste just like the ones we had at the restaurants and cost hardly anything! We use Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce recipe for the tonkatsu sauce. This is one of my husbands most requested dinners now.

I added an extra 1/2 tsp garlic to the egg mixture and used cayenne pepper instead of black. I first dipped the chops in plain flour, then the egg mixture and just one dip into the panko crumbs. Very tasty.

I don't know why I just didn't like this dish. It was simple and easy and deliciously crunchy and panko always cooks up beautifully but it needed more spice. If I make this again, I will add alot more garlic and extra spices to give the breading and meat more flavor.

These chops were juicy, crunchy and easy to make. I thought they had good flavor on their own - there's plenty of tasty stuff in the egg wash. I let them sit for 10 minutes as the author recommended - maybe that made the difference. And I took other reviewers' advice to make a tonkatsu sauce (kind of funny one wasn't included when you look at the name) for dipping. Found one on another site. Thanks for another staple pork chop recipe.

Made twice and find the breading is much soggier than I would like. Also, easy to burn. Will continue to tweak as I really like this style pork chop.

My husband went wild over these! He loved this dish. I made my own tonkatsu sauce to serve on the side. I had to double the egg wash to do all 8 pork chops. The coating was so crispy and light. Very very good. I am not into pork so I'd prefer chicken but I can appreciate a quality recipe when I find  it. Thanks Shin98 for sharing this delicious dish with us.

Upon eating this the 2 and 3 time they didn't like it as much.  My family just loved this.  I doubled the milk/eggs mixture and then had plenty to double dip.  Also we just needed 1 thin pork chop apiece, with the coating its plenty filling.

The breading fried up very nicely.  I ended up using almost three times more of the egg mixture than was called for and about double the panko.  I will definitely be making this again.

this was my first recipe with Panko, will experiment some more with them. pork chops were good, but i needed to double the egg & crumbs to double dip 6 thin chops. i used white pepper & ginger powder in the egg. will certainly add more seasoning next time,since it needed more flavor. i served with fried rice & broccoli with asian sesame sauce.

Easy to make.  Turned out nicely in a "Cool Daddy" fryer.  I thought it was a little bland but family thought it was very tasty.  I'd like to try the Panko on some other recipes.

This was good, but it didn't knock our socks off.  FYI - The oil should be hot, but not REAL hot. You will never get these fried to "moist but done" if you have the oil too hot. A medium heat oil allowed the 4-5 minutes frying per side.  Anything hotter got the Panko too brown, and the inside was still showing some pink (which is a no-no for pork).

These were just okay. I used chicken. It needs more spice and seasoning. Maybe some ginger or teriyaki. I may try it again with a different approach.

This was very good! I ended up using plain breadcrumbs as my Panko flakes had been in the pantry for some time and smelled stale,I'm sure it would be even better with the Panko. The only thing I would do different is  to be a bit more liberal with the seasoning. But very easy and tastey.

I used non gluten panko and it was excellent.   I'm definitely adding this to the menu rotation.

I found the cooking it on medium high heat burned it. I tried it a second time and I cook fried it for about two minutes on each side on medium high but then turn the heat down to medium and still came out nice and crunchy in 10 minutes and well done on the inside

This tastes awesome! One of my favorite outputs from an allrecipes recipe! I did some modifications though: (1) I tenderized the pork first by pounding it; (2) I also did small cuts on the meat (I watched this tip in another video elsewhere); (3) I dipped the pork in flour before dipping in egg and panko breadcrumbs; (4) I added another egg since 2 eggs for the egg mixture wasn’t enough. I also made some tonkatsu sauce to go along with it. I used the recipe for the sauce from this site’s “Ashley’s Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu sauce”: 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce; 1/4 cup ketchup; and 2 tablespoons soy sauce. I adjusted it a little to my taste. Aside from the sauce, I added some broccoli slaw as a side. My husband loved the whole thing!

Make sure you use thin pork or chicken and if using thicker swine or poultry, bake after golden brown to finish. Due to the fact panko is very light and will burn quickly.

This dish is so delicious! Although I did season the pork chops with garlic salt and pepper before I breaded them. I love how crunchy the panko turns out. Definitely makes the dish! Don’t forget to make the sauce..

Double-dipping in eggs and Panko bread crumbs produces a wonderful crust on the pork. My family loved it! A definite keeper.

Tasted good, but I could not achieve the golden brown texture that the image shows, though, the problem could be my cookware. I also would recommend cooking less than 5-minutes on each side and flip to check the color regularly. As others have mentioned, a sauce enhances this dish. I served with Sriracha and a sweet vinegar cucumber salad.

I love it. Very simple, I did add a bit more Garlic than called for, and of course, took my aggression out on my chops with my meat tenderizer and then viola! Fried em over medium high heat and served them with traditional Katsu sauce, Jasmine rice, and steamed Broccoli :)

Only way to cook boneless Pork Chops now!
Crisp and flavorful not at all greasy or dried out. Leftovers served on crispy Garlic Toast with Lettuce & Tomatoes next day. Fantastic!
HATED the TONKATSU Sauce recommended. Unedible for our taste. But upon further research I have discovered totally different versions of this sauce, (that verify that the recipe I used & suspected would be odd,) & I look forward to trying them instead next time.

This was okay.  I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder.  I dredged them once, let them sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes, then dredged again and let sit another 30 minutes or so.  The panko really sticks to the chops that way!  I required one more egg to be able to finish all the chops.  I served this with katsu sauce, which really made the dish.  These were good, just not really the WOW dish I was expecting to serve.  I will probably make them again, but tweak it to suit my tastes a bit more.  Maybe marinate in some soy sauce or something.  It just needs something more to give it the boost from a good meal to a fantastic one!  Thanks for sharing the recipe- I love the concept :)

Depending on the type of pork chop, I suggest tenderizing the pork chops. Also, on my first attempt, the bread crumbs were too thin so I made sure to evenly coat the panko crumbs. Lastly, adjust the amount of vegetable oil basked on thickness of pork chop so that you get a better coating of panko without burning it.

Yummyyyy!! This is not that healthy, because it's being deep friend, and let's face it... that's not so good. But it's so yummy it's worth it! Just maybe not everyday. I once read that onion tends to cut down oil, so when you're eating something oily you should eat it with onion, so i sautee some onions with soy sauce or some other sauce and we eat that with this too... Or i try to add onion to a salad we're eating and then hubby and i try not to talk directly to each other for the rest of the night. Hehe. Looove love! =)

Yum! This was a hit. It was easy to make. Instead of minced garlic, I used garlic powder.  Also, as others have stated, you need more eggs. The panko made it so crispy and delicious.  I will def make again!

I made the recipe as it stated except I used olive oil. I thought it was very easy to make, the crunch was great, the taste ok - bland for me, but better once dipped in a spiced peanut sauce (the stores did not have the sauce mentioned). I think it would probably be best if more spice were added to the cutlet before dredging. I read that authentic variations on tonkatsu include sandwiching an ingredient like cheese or shiso leaf between the meat, and then breading and frying; In Waseda, Tokyo, a restaurant serves a tonkatsu with a bar of chocolate sandwiched inside. Authentic recipes also call for all purpose flour dredging before dredging in the egg and panko. That makes sense to me because the panko is thick and dipping it twice (as the recipe here calls for) makes it too thick really - especially if you let it sit for a few minutes as the recipe calls for and if too thick, it will fall off the chop after cooked. If you are new to cooking, I would start out with your thickest chop and cut it open before removing from heat to make sure it is done because cook time will vary - pork and eggs are not things you want undercooked. I doubt I will make this again.

I thought these tasted great!! But, the egg mixture and the panko crumbs were only enough for 4 of my pork chops. Maybe I did something wrong, but it came out fine and that's all that matters! :)

This was excellent.  I made the recipe as stated and it turned out deliciously!  I dipped pieces of pork chop into Mae Ploy Sweet Chilli Sauce and was in heaven.  This is seriously good food.  It's fairly simple and straight-forward, too.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Very good, here is the recipe for the sauce that I used:
1/2 c ketchup
1/4 c worcestershire sauce
1 Tbsp grated ginger
1 Tbsp garlic powder 
4 Tbsp mirin
2 Tbsp soy sauce
pinch of chili powder

I didn't add any sugar, but maybe that's what it was missing... hope this helps =0)

I really enjoyed this recipe. Like a lot of the other reviews stated, the sauce makes the dish. I enjoyed the crunchiness of the pork chops. It reminded me of a Japanese restaurant I went to a few years back. I have been searching for that flavor for a while and I am glad that I found it.

It was good but adding garlic makes the mix really hard to stick to the meat, so I had to add 2 more eggs.

This recipe is just okay. I loved the panko crumbs, but that doesn't make the taste. I used the Tonkatsu Sauce recipe aforementioned,and my husband LOVED the sauce. We just found that it was bland.
If the recipe had included the sauce I would have given 4 stars.

Finally I went & bought some panko crumbs to try this recipe. I am converted! They are so good!!! The panko crumb coating was lovely & crisp & light. However I thought the actual pork was rather bland. A sauce with this dish is a must.

I make this all the time.  The panko definately adds much more crunch and texture than regular bread crumbs.  Make sure that your pork is sliced thin otherwise the outside will be "really done" and the middle will be still pink.  Nice idea, thanks for the post.

Absolutely wonderful! A nice change from your typical "shake and bake" style pork. We served it with teryaki dipping sauce and steamed cauliflower, snap peas, and carrots. Will definitely make again!

Good!  These chops were crispy and crunchy and moist.  Cut into strips and served with sweet and sour for my kids and they ate them up!  I agree that the batter needs some spicing up but a great starting place and a good kid friendly mid week meal.

Very simple...some panko fell off during the second egg dip. Must do both dips in panko only one is not enough. We served with asian noodles which were not very good.

This was a nice recipe, had a really good crunch due to the panko crumbs.  Needs a little bit more seasoning, other than that it is great!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe:)

Wonderful and so fast!!!  I had never used Japanese bread crumbs before, (they can be hard to find!) but they will be a staple item at my house from now on!

Came out quite good - however, I had to make the egg wash 3 times - that second dip really sucks up a LOT of the egg.

Wonderful!  They were a little bland, however one would kind of think that in looking at the recipe beforehand.  I chose to saute the garlic in the oil before adding the chops - which were breaded with seasoned Panko crumbs (garlic powder, pepper, salt and onion powder).  First time I have worked with Panko and would def use again - sooooo much better than breadcrumbs.  Chops came out juicy and delicious - and for that I say THANK YOU!

Just okay for us.  Tasted like a regular pork chop.  An oriental sauce of some type might help.  Would probably not make again.  Sorry

Mmmmmmmm!  What a great recipe!  Btw, I used garlic powder instead of garlic.  Thanks!
