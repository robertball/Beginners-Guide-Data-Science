We have a tradition of having shepherd's pie and angel food cake for Christmas dinner. It is easy to make ahead, and it's well...shepherd's and angels, get it?
But I wanted a more flavorful festive recipe. After searching through a couple dozen, I chose this one. It's healthy, delicious and had all the wonderful aromas and flavors of a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. I had some left over mushrooms, and I mixed it with the meat. 
This will be my Christmas Eve Shepherd's pie for years to come! Thank you very much.

This total comfort food for me!!  This recipe was deelish.  My husband ate leftovers of this for days (which is hard to get him to do).  I made this almost like the recipe states..except that I didn't use the white potato.  I used about 4 LARGE sweet potatoes that I boiled until soft..mashed with some butter and a little bit of sour cream.  This made  a LOT of mashed sweets, but I had a little cooks treat while the casserole was baking.  I sauted the onions, garlic, and carrot in some oil..then removed and browned the ground turkey..added the cooked vege's back in and added some corn and peas.  I also added about 2 cups of chicken broth and then let this cook for a little bit.  I then added a slurry of cornstarch to the turkey mixture and let that thicken.  I added poultry seasoning, salt and pepper, some parsley.  This turned out really well and I'm sure that I'll make this again.  Its relatively healthy and tasty and sure to please.  I bet kids would like it too :)

This is absolutely my favorite dish I have tried on AR thus far- and I've tried and loved a lot! Only made a few changes based on what I had- I left out the carrots and peas, and used one egg in place of the substitute. Also, I had no browning sauce (nor did I know where to find it) so I left that out. My husband raved about it! And has asked for it every night since. So, thanks for sharing Christine M! This will become a regular in our house!

This was a little bland for my taste. I made some homemade cranberry sauce to go with it and that helped a bit. I also thought the ground turkey got a little dried out after all that cooking and would have prefered piececs ofleftover roasted turkey. Overall a good base, but not spectacular.

This is really tasty! I made it with chicken breasts sliced up really thin.  I did not have the browning sauce so I didn't use any. I served cranberry sauce on the side. Yummy and healthy!  Thanks for posting.

Christine - thanks for the great recipe! I made it for dinner tonight, but everything smelled so good that I had to sneak some early. I made this with shredded chicken because that's what I had. I also put in lima beans because they're my favorite and seemed perfect for me. Tonight when I eat for real, I'll be serving with some cranberry sauce. I can't wait!

Not going to lie- I was a little scared of this one! I wasn't sure that the ground turkey would go good with the sweet taters, same with the sour cream and egg in the sweet potatoes. But it turned out really good!! I used a cornbread stuffing mix, and added mushroom and extra onion. It was so yummy, I will deff be making again!!

Delicious!  I didn't peel the potatoes, and didn't have a few of the ingredients, but I made it anyway!   I had never made mashed potatoes with egg and sour cream; we liked how light and fluffy these were!  We will be making this again!

We did enjoy this dish but it was a little dry. I also didn't like the amount of dishes it took to prep this. I used a frozen small mixed vegetable blend instead of the fresh carrots which had the peas and corn already in it also. The nutmeg sprinkled on top of the sweet potatoes was a nice touch though.

SO YUMMY. All that was missing was a side of cranberry sauce.  i used canned vegges and did not have celery or browning sauce and it still came out great. best recipe i have even got from this site.

Different and good! I used a real egg, ground turkey breast, Jameson's sodium free chicken soup base instead of canned stock, whole wheat flour and the rest was the same. We were skeptical, but it's a winner! I love the idea of Shepard's Pie and Angel Food cake on Christmas Eve!! Can't wait to start that tradition. Thanks for sharing:)

Great Post-Thanksgiving treat!  Perfect for all the leftovers and very little work. Adjust for whatever you have, i.e. corn and beans vs. carrots. Serve with the extra cranberry sauce and the last piece of pumpkin pie!

Great recipe! I would have never thought that sweet potatoes would work for a shepherd pie, but it's awesome. The only thing that was missing was a crunch, so I added french fried onions pieces as a topping. That made it a keeper for sure. Also, I didn't have browning sauce so I used some of the dry beef soup mix.

This is a great wintery comfort food.  It takes some time and care, so it is a good recipe to make with a partner.  If you are cooking alone, chop and measure all ingredients before you start cooking.  You could use a casserole dish that's a little bigger; the ingredients were really packed in.  I wouldn't let it sit so long next time or I would let it sit in the hot oven for 30 minutes.

Quite a bit of work but a tasty dish. Turned out a bit dry so I added some turkey gravy and the left overs disappeared!

I made this for dinner last night and it was so good that I had to write my first review about it! What a yummy comfort food type meal- its like Thanksgiving in a casserole! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was quite the lengthy process putting it all together, but worth it in the end.

very good! skipped the egg, white potato, and sour cream in the sweet potato top, otherwise made as prepared. My son (20 months old) loved it, the sweet potato top really is a nice compliment to the dish. Will make again.

This was pretty good. I found the texture and flavor good but not fantastic. I've made a healthy vegetarian version which is just as good. I didn't have the browning sauce of worcestershire so perhpas it would have been better with those added. It did make a fair amount and looked good out of the oven.

Great recipe. I wished my mashed potatoes would have seeped into the vegetables a bit more.  I had a lot of mashed potatoes leftover.

I like things just a bit outside of the box and this recipe hit that button for me, so I just had to give it a try.  We thought each layer was very good on it's own and together they all played well.  We really enjoyed this holiday inspired twist on an old favorite.

Added 2 cups broth instead of 1/2 cup and just added enough corn starch/ water to thicken. . Added mushrooms at the end. I did not use stuffing mix to make gluten free.

Loved this. Used leftover turkey from Christmas dinner.

This was pretty tasty and easy to make despite the longish ingredient list. Made a few changes based on what I had on hand- I did only sweet potatoes for the topping and no celery but used a bit of celery salt, didn’t have browning sauce or peas. Subbed green beans for peas. FYI I wasn’t sure if you were supposed to pre make the stuffing or not - I didn’t so added a tad more chicken stock than called for and it ended up fine. Will definitely make this again.

This was good, but giving 4 stars because I think it could have used a bit more of the "gravy".  Next time I will make more as I prefer it to not be quite so dry.  I used leftover cut up turkey rather than ground turkey.  I liked the flavor a lot.

I thought that this turned out great.  For a time saver I used jarred gravy, but otherwise as stated.  It will be great for hot lunches at work this week!!

I'm giving this three stars because we liked the taste.  However, if I were to make it again, I'd make alot of changes.  First question:  why all the pots?  Why cook the sweet potato and the russet potato separately, and then, in step 3, put them in a bowl together and mix?  I don't get that.  So, you've got three pots there, then the pan where you cook the turkey, then the casserole dish that you bake it in.  I'm not a new cook - been cooking over 40 years, but I don't care for recipes that are this labor-intensive.  Next time I make it, I plan to buy some fat free turkey or chicken gravy, add it to the cooked or ground turkey, then assemble as directed.  Done.

This was awful! It sounded good, but what a waste of time and raw materials!  I really couldn't eat it!  It took forever to put it together and what a disappointment.  The directions are very confusing!  I don't usually comment on recipes, but I had to this time.  I used leftover turkey, chopped up. Overall, wished I had never wasted my good stuff on it.

I made a few changes to this so it would be a little more calorie wise. I liked it, but it was a bit bland so I kicked it up with chilies and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.
