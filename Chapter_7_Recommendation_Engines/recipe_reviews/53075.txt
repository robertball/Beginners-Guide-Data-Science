I have used dozens of recipes and never felt so inclined to write a review. I have been a vegetarian for 18 years, so I substitued the ground beef with Morningstar Crumbled Grillers...once you add all of the spices and other ingredients, you can't even tell the difference. My husband loved it...he ate the entire pizza by himself. The only thing I would suggest is that you use your favorite salsa, as much of the flavor comes from this one ingredient. This recipe is a new staple in our house. Thank you.

I made this last night for my boyfriend's dinner, and he loved it.  The only other thing that I did was double the meat, onions and refried beans; I made a double layer of this filling, and added 1 more tortilla to the top.  (3 altogether).  This really came out wonderful.  Thank you Jimmy for a wonderful recipe!

I could have sworn I had tortillas in the freezer so when I realized I didn't, I decided to just use regular canned pizza crust for this recipe. I used ground turkey, baked the crust for ten minutes and then added all of the ingredients. It was a hit with my family Jimmy and thanks!!

Delicious and easy to make.  One bit of advice: don't add the garlic and onion to beef and then drain your fat.  You pour off a lot of the flavor of the garlic and onions that way.  Saut√© your G&O's first, set aside on plate then add beef to pan, brown, drain and mix together with G&O.  Great dish!!

great recipe. i skipped the pie pan and first poked holes in tortillas so they would not puff and toasted them in the oven to crisp up. then made pizza's and baked on cookie sheet until cheese melted. added a little cilantro also to toppings. reheated very well the next day. next time i will add more of the bean and meat mixture.

I didn't think this was anything like Taco Bell's Mexican pizza; I thought it was WAY better. Apart from adding a litte fajita seasoning to the meat, I made this as stated, and it turned out great. Quick, easy and tasty. Thanks, Jimmy!

really good imitation of taco bell's mexican pizza and so much healthier i'm sure.  I used ground turkey, black beans, and fajita sized tortillas instead and they worked fine.  I baked the tortillas for a few minutes in the oven first just to crisp them up before layering the beans and meat on.  Great dish!

This was really good. I cooked my tortillas some before I put it all together, but I didn't change any seasonings or ingredients. I noticed a LOT of people suggested using taco seasoning, but I can't stand that stuff and much prefer the simple seasonings in this recipe. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was quite good!  I used a whole pound of hamburger, so I also added another clove of garlic.  We did not top with jalapeno because we're wimpy!  I especially like the tomato on top.  Great recipe!

Sounds Great!  I will try tonight also.  I like thin and crispy pizza dough so I'm going to brush the tortilla's with olive oil and bake for 5 minutes at 400 before adding other ingredients.

Love this Pizza!!!!  Have made it twice now.  The 2nd time I made it I put the flour tortillas in the oven, on the rack, for 3 minutes each side.  This makes for a nice crunchy tortilla.  I add homemade taco seasoning to the beef mixture.  I assemble the tortillas putting on the salsa and cheese. I use Pepper Jack cheese, in place of the Monterey Jack since it has jalapeno peppers in it.  I then place the onions and tomatoes and bake another 5 minutes. By doing it this way I cut back on the cooking time by 10 minutes.  This has been added to one of our favorite list.

This was delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I really loved it -- so much better then Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza -- which used to be one of the only reasons I would go to Taco Bell. Next time I make this dish I think that I am gonna bake the bottom tortilla for a few minutes before I layer the beans and meat -- I woulda preferred the bottom tortilla a little crisper :)

We have Mexican night once a week and I was looking for new recipes. This recipe fit the bill perfectly. The combination of seasonings made the meat so flavorful! I will definitely be using this combination instead of pre packaged seasoning from now on.

The only thing that I had an issue with on this recipe is keeping the layers together when trying to eat it! Next time I am going to try a thin layer of cheese with the bean/meat to see if this will help.

easy to make and delicious! A bit messy when eating so have some napkins ready.  The best part was I made both but before the last oven step I wrapped one in aluminum foil and froze it, I took it out about a week later and baked it at 350 for 40 mins and it was great.

I thought these were great.  I left out the ground beef because I didn't have any, so we made our vegetarian style.  I sauted the onion and garlic in some olive oil, along with some green pepper.  And I added all of the spices meant to go in the beef, into the refried beans instead.  Didn't have any Monterey Jack cheese, so we just used extra Cheddar.  I sliced an avocado and some tomato with a little lime, and ate the mixture over the pizza, along with some sour cream.  Was so good!  Thanks for the super easy and yummy recipe!

This is a general hint. When you cook ground beef with any onions and garlic or anything else and drain the "grease" you also drain all the juice from the onions and garlic. Brown the beef THEN add any thing else and cook for a few minutes.

I make this but I cannot use tort. so I put all on a plate & micro until cheese melts & use all for a dip for corn chips. AND, I put a dab of sour cream on each bite. I also use velvetta cheese sometimes instead of other cheese.

Could be good for a person with munchies, though the seasoning is a bit unimaginative.  Has no sort of relation at all to pizza.

I tried this with both flour and corn tortillas and they are both amazing!  I too baked the tortillas before filling.  I brushed them with melted butter and baked at 350 for about 10 minutes, until slightly browned and crisp.  I used my normal "go-to" taco meat seasoning: 2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne, 1/2-1 onion (depending on size), 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp oregano, season salt and pepper; we like spicy in our house. I topped it with lots of cheese, diced tomato, green onion, black olive, taco sauce and a dollop of sour cream; taco sauce because I think salsa would make it mushy.

This is delicious!  The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because I use Taco Seasoning I with my ground beef, and I use a can of black beans, drained, rinsed and pureed in the food processor with a can of Rotel (green chilies and tomatoes).  Thanks for a great creation!  I appreciate its versatility. :)

This was great. I did use more ground beef than called for and added sour cream to the finished product, but otherwise I followed the recipe. It was good and very easy. I thought it might be dry but it turned out great. My husband loved it too.

This was a really good addition to change up our tiresome taco meals. I ended up using too much of the refried beans so I will cut back next time. Didnt have fresh salsa on hand so I used enchilada sauce and I thought that is what made it. I will probably not change that. Great recipe!

Good food Jimmy! Very easy to make, very good combination of ingredients.  My 12 year old and I enjoyed the recipe.  I would like to try it with a crisper shell/crust.

I did as others did and crisped up my tortillas in a skillet (or oven if you prefer) and it gave it more crunch similar to the Taco Bell version.  Yummy, yummy

Loved this!  Quick and easy and oh, so good!  Loved the seasoning of the ground beef.  I cooked a full pound and used the remainder for burritos.  Black olives are a good addition to this. I used a 9x13 dish instead of pie plates. Thanks Jimmy!

Very simple, quick, and tasty recipe!  I did do it a bit different.  I came to allrecipes to figure out how I wanted to heat my previously frozen black bean burgers (recipes from here also) and the Mexican Pizza was a featured recipe and the lightbulb went off!  Basically, I subbed the black bean burgers for the ground beef, spices and refried beans.  I did make two layers with 3 tortillas, and the end result was a very filling lunch that my husband and I split and really enjoyed!  Finished it off with a quick broil and parsley (no green onion on-hand).  Awesome - thanks!

I tried this tonight and everyone liked it! I lots of crushed garlic and organo, and little bit of red pepper flakes . I also toasted the two bottome shells in the oven while it was preheating so it was a little crispier. Nice and easy!

Thanks for a quick and tasty recipe! Much better than what you get at Taco Bell!! I did change it up a bit by using Taco Seasoning I and making 2 pizzas on a cookie sheet instead of using pie plates. Very quick and tasty! I love how the tortilla's crunch up around the edges! It was also VERY filling. Will def make again!

Yum! I enjoyed this Mexican twist! A fun way to eat your basic burrito - we really enjoyed this! It's easy to adapt to your own taste preferences, or to adjust based on what you have on hand. I didn't realize I was out of refried beans so I just mashed up a can of white beans...worked just fine in this!

I love recipes like this- easy, comforting and has you thinking, why didn't I think of this? I used ground turkey breast and uncooked flour tortillas- yum. If you can find these, I recommend them for dishes like this- it was like thin pizza dough!

This was incredible.  We wouldn't change a thing.  It was a nice change to regular pizza or just fixing tacos or burritos at home.  Very good flavoring.  Although it would save time to use taco seasoning, I preferred to use the ingredients listed (since the packaged seasoning gives me headaches).  Very good!

This is a keeper.  My hubby gave it 5 1/2 stars and said to make it again next week for him!  I thought I should have browned the meat just a tad less because it ended up dry after the cooking.

Really good.  I doubled the recipe but did not double the beans and tomatoes.  There were definitely enough beans in one can to make four 8" pizzas.   I only had two tomatoes which was fine also since most of the tomato taste comes from the salsa anyway.  They tasted great and were very pretty.  Thanks Jimmy!

As a "scrounge-the-pantry" recipe this is pure genius and it was good.  But for a plan-ahead and buy ingredients recipe it could use a little tweaking. I did not like the way the tortilla suggestion went at all. They soggified. Immediately. But it's a great base and next time I will use the tostada shells for some crunch. It needs crunch, everything was the same soft texture.

Made this after church today almost exactly like the recipe.  The only changes made were that we used 96% fat-free tortillas, low-fat Mexican blend cheese, fat-free refried beans, and low-fat sour cream.  I also added a 7.5 oz can of sliced mushrooms.  It was awesome!!  You couldn't tell it was diet.  Will certainly be making this again soon.

We LOVED these! Made as written, except for using WW flour tortillas. Served w/ 'Black Beans with Pico De Gallo' from here and it was a perfect match! I will be using this recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

Awesome recipe!  For a healthier version, I substituted with ground chicken, low fat cheese, fat free beans, and low fat tortillas (5 WW pts a serving).  Hubby said this recipe is in the top 10 (and I cook a LOT!)! :P

Yummo!  Like some of the others, I used ground turkey breast instead of ground beef.  But other than that I followed the recipe exactly!  What a keeper!  After just one bite my husband  declared it "Delicious!"  It's super easy to prepare.  I'll make it again and again!

5 stars strictly based on the fact that the 4 kids ate it and there were NO complaints. Only changes were to use taco seasoning and taco sauce for the salsa. Thanks so much Jimmy!

Definitely a hit with the teens in the house!  I had to sub smashed black beans for the refried beans, and needed about twice the amount of salsa on the top of the pizzas.  I also crisped up the bottom tortillas directly on the oven rack before using.  These are something I will be making again.

I made a couple of changes just to make it lower in fat and a little healthier. I used a prepared whole wheat pizza crust instead of the tortillas.  I also grilled and shredded a chicken breast and seasoned the cooked chicken using the same seasoning in the recipe. I served low fat sour cream and prepared salsa on the side.  I used the cheeses as suggested because that is too important to the flavor to scimp on.

This was just ok. I was making tacos and used some of the meat to try this recipe. I think the shells really need to be deep fried, like at Taco Bell.

Excellent basic Tex-Mex recipe!  Wouldn't change a thing, except to add a little liquid (like beer or water) to the ground beef while it is browning, and use a potato masher to break it up while it is cooking.

Pretty good dish.  Easy to make with basic ingredients of tex mex dishes.  Turns out much nicer in presentation than a burrito that could be made with the same stuff.

This was really good.  However, I did combine this recipe with another mexican pizza recipe as I chose to use corn tortillas instead of flour.  Just fried them for 15 seconds on both sides then layered and baked for 10 minutes.  Really Good.  Thanks for sharing :)

I followed the recipe AND the suggestions to crisp up the tortillas in the oven first, and to increase the beans and meat by about a half. Made two versions, one with ground beef and one with shredded chicken breasts as I was cooking for six. Both were excellent and everyone enjoyed, although I must of bought some mild jalapenos because we all thought it could have had a little more heat, but that may just be our family's preference. Served with sour cream and more salsa. Will make again. Posted a photo of the only two pieces that were left over!

This was delicious! I made a couple of changes - by choice and lack of ingredients. I used ground turkey instead of hamburger, jalapeno refried beans and had to leave out the chili powder because I thought I had some in my spice cupboard but didn't. I mixed the beans and meat together rather than layering them. Added some diced avocado on top - fantastic! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this tonight and we really enjoyed it.  I stuck to the recipe, except I had an extra tortilla, extra beans, and extra salsa, so I just added another layer.  It was more like Mexican lasagna because it was so thick.  One piece was plenty for each of us and there is more for tomorrow night if it isn't too soggy.

Ok I blew it and used 7 inch tortillas so we ate with a fork.  I did cook the tortillas in the oven first - 3 minutes each side and bumped the ground beef to 3/4 pounds - bumped the seasoning accordingly.  Mixed 3/4 of the can of beans into the cooked ground beef to skip the first step. Just spread the warm meat mixture on the prebaked tortillas and added the toppings and baked!  The seasoning is perfect (please don't use taco seasoning out of a packet!) and can't wait to make them on 10 inch tortillas so they will be thinner!  Hubby loves them and they will become a regular!

This turned out great and only because of the suggestions of everyone on here. The best thing I did that made this recipe great per suggestions was brush the tortillas with olive oil and stick them in the oven for approx 5-6 minutes at 400 degrees to crisp the tortillas. I also sauteed the onion and 2 (instead of 1) cloves of garlic. I did all the seasonings the recipe asked for and did everything else per recipe. The family really enjoyed it. I would definetly make this again!

This recipe needs more love!  It is such a great change up for our weekly "taco" night.  My husband LOVES the Taco Bell pizza, and my kids will actually eat this, so it's a win all the way around.  It is super easy and it doesn't use a lot of expensive ingredients, so it's affordable to feed our crowd.

I cooked it longer at a higher temperature to make it more crispy (personal preference).  But, the recipe, as is, is excellent!!!

pretty darn good. i made one with black beans and one with refried beans, both were good, but refried was better. I also sprayed some butter on the flour torts and baked for about 10 minutes to get crispy, kind of hard to cut, but i think it added to the dish. I did one with salsa and one with enchilada sauce...we didn't prefer one over the other. good, like all others said, tastes like taco bell mexican pizza. yum

The beauty of this recipe is in the simplicity.  It is a tasty treat in a short amount of time.  I really enjoyed this and it took me back to my Taco Bell eating days.  And it was as simple as swapping out different salsas to cater to the younger, less spicy crowd.

Excellent Mexican Pizza recipe! The layers held together perfectly; it sliced like a dream after sitting only 5 minutes, and the flavor was awesome. As my other half said - it's definitely a keeper!
We made ours with quinoa instead of meat - just cook 1 cup water with the spices and 1/2 cup quinoa like rice, then let sit 5 minutes and fluff like couscous - then use as a direct substitute for the meat. Texture is near perfect for ground meat, and lots of protein, too!
There were no leftovers.

I made this per recipe and I have to wonder if the spice quantities have changed on the website. The meat mixture was inedible, the spices were far too heavy for this amount of meat. I can't believe we are the only ones who had this issue with the recipe. I would definitely make this again with a few changes - mainly I'd use 1/10th of the spices. I made the second pizza with no meat at all, just beans, and everyone loved it. Served it with sour cream and guacamole.

My family enjoyed this recipe!  It's very similar to Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza, but without the crunch!  Will use 8 tostado shells in place of the 4 tortillas next time for some added texture.

This was really good!  My kids usually don't like beans but they didn't even notice the refried beans and they really liked this.  We left out the green onion, jalapeno, and tomatoes on top as the salsa was enough.  Make sure you poke holes in your tortillas or they might puff up!  Great recipe!

After reading some of the reviews I pre-baked the tortillas (on a pizza screen until just slightly crispy) and then made the "pizzas" on the same screen (a large pan would work too) and  doubled the meat (I used ground turkey).  Will do it the same next time.  This was loved by the whole family.

Totally Yum-O!! I turned mine into a Mexican Lasagna using the Floured tortillas, added cream cheese to my meat filling a little of my salsa( I had a fresh salsa) and a little of the juice that it made. I also use Queso cheese in between my layers I used Refried Black beans mix them with a little sour cream and salsa to make them pliable and heated a little and started layering... I will be making this again!!

This was an excellent and easy recipe.  I had half a can of refried beans left over.  The recipe didn't specify how much to put on each tortilla.  I guess it's a personal thing.  I also put a bit of shredded cheese on top of the meat layer. So tasty!

I made this last night for my husband who is sort of critical of this type of dish...but he loved it and took the leftovers for lunch today.  I followed the recipe as written and it turned our perfect.

I made this for the family last night, I added a layer of nacho cheese sauce and drizzled some enchilada sauce on it, it turned out awesome. I will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe Jimmy.

The meat is really good for this.  After making 1 round of the pizzas we just made big taco salads with the meat and beans.  So easy and delicious.  You wouldn't think the flavor of the meat would be that good since it is so basic but it really does have great flavor.

10 STARS!This recipe was AWESOME! Even better than I had anticipated. Family LOVED it! I followed the recipe exactly except each put on their own J. peppers at the table, due to personal taste in "heat".
This will be added to my favorites - Thank You!

This is pretty good. I used morning star crumbles because i don't eat ground beef. I used 8 in torillas and didn't use green onion cause i didn't have any. Tastes similar to taco bell. I will be making this again.

I love this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except for using green peppers in lieu of jalepeno peppers, which I didn't have. The tortillas had a nice crunchy edge from baking in the oven, and the filling had a great spice to it.  Plus, this was so easy to prepare.  This is also great for customizing.  Just prepare the tortillas with the filling, and everyone can put the toppings on as they wish.

Really awesome!  I wouldn't omit the sour cream though, and I serve it with extra salsa as the flavours can get overpower for some.

Yummy! I think I did these injustice by using packaged taco seasoning to season the meat because I was in a pinch for time but they were very tasty anyway.  I think they would be even better following the seasonings provided.  Can't wait to try them the way they were intended! Thanks for the recipe Jimmy!

This was really good! I used ground turkey and had cooked / seasoned that the night before, then made this after getting home from work. Really simple and very tasty! My husband raved about it. The only other change I made was to use some canned tomatoes and green chiles instead of salsa because I was out of salsa. I will definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this a lot and my picky husband did too.  I changed it to suit our tastes (skipped the jalape√±o and green onions on top b/c of my picky children) and used picante sauce instead of salsa.  Still came out muy excellente!

This was amazing.  If nothing else, the spice mixture makes for a perfect taco seasoning.  I used ground turkey for mine, but the seasoning tasted exactly like the store-bought packets of seasoning, without any of the extra stuff they put in the packets (maltodextrin, sugar, etc).  I made the recipe as stated with the exception of the jalapenos because my 5 year old isn't a fan.  In their place I added some sliced black olives.  You can seemingly add anything to this and it'll be great.  Super recipe.  It's definitely a keeper.

Wonderful recipe! The entire family loved it! I didn't realize until I was assembling them that I didn't have re-fried beans so I mashed some canned black beans to use instead. I also added a small amount of cheese to the first layer. Just enough to act as a 'glue' to keep the layers together for my kiddos.  I don't think that adding taco seasoning to the ground beef is necessary. If you try the beef alone, it may taste like it needs something extra. However when all the ingredients are put together it's great and not lacking on flavor! I will definitely make this recipe on a regular basis. Thank you Jimmy!

Yummy! Like others I used what I had on hand for this dish; ground turkey, which was great! Also, I used a packet of taco seasoning with an extra dash or two of cumin, green onions, jalapenos, black beans, Mexican four cheese blend, homemade salsa and sour cream. My daughter and I enjoyed enough to put in the monthly rotation. Wonderful for a weeknight dinner!

Snaps for Jimmy! What a great idea with so many options. I opened the fridge and used things i had. I left out the beans cause I dont like them and used chicken cause i do like that. I put shredded chicken on a tortilla topped with cheese and baked it. Then i topped it with green onion, cilantro, tomotoes and sour cream. A quick and easy dinner, thanks so much!!!

Good! Only thing I did different, I got some grape tomatoes and roasted them in the oven. With avacados on the side, it's a good mexican dinner.

Instead of ground beef, I used black beans and added a shredded carrot, 1/4 cup corn, garlic, and more onion to the mix.  It was AWESOME!!  I'll be making often.

I was very impressed with this, even though I wasn't able to use most of the delicious ingredients. (picky husband!) I hadn't been sure that each pizza would be enough for a meal but it definitely was! I plan to use this tortilla/pizza concept again, using many different ingredients. Thanks, Jimmy!

**Delicious**  I used a lower sodium taco seasoning mix instead of the ingredients listed in the recipe just to save on time and measuring.  After I put the refried beans and meat down I added a layer of shredded cheese and then added the tortilla.  I baked it for 10 minutes and added another layer of cheese and returned to the oven for 3 minutes to melt the cheese.  I cut it in quarters and left the top plain so the family add their own toppings.  Thanks Jimmy!

When you want Mexican food fast, and easy this is the recipe to use. I have used this recipe several times and it's one of our favorite. The only thing I do different is that I fry the tortillas. I know more like a chalupa, but I love the crunch. Better than eating out.

Very good!! I didn't have tortillas so I used taco salad shells and baked them flat instead of in a bowl. You can bake them first if you want it crispy or you can use them right out of the bag. It tastes just like Taco Bells only better.

These were really good and a different twist to our "ordinary" taco night. I layered tortilla (skipped beans since I really don't like them) the taco meat, cheese, tomatoes, green onions, then top tortilla. Baked them on a cookie sheet until the top was crispy and then cut them up in pizza triangeles. My 2 1/2 year old called it yummy taco pizza! Served it with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.

This was delicious.  Easy to make, too.  I dirtied a skillet and 2 pie pans for this.  It only made 4 servings, though, as a main course.  I used a little less cheese and I sauteed the jalapenos in with the meat and onions.  I only used 1 large jalapeno.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good! I used taco seasoning for the meat (I was in a time crunch) and I didn't have tomatoes or green onions, but used diced chilis & it turned out great!  Next time I will be prepared and have all the ingredients!

This was a good recipe. Way better then Taco Bell. I made a few changes though. I didn't use refried beans because we don't like them. What I did was take some black beans and smash them up, then mixed them with a little enchilada sauce and thats what I used instead of the refried beans. Also I just used a pack of taco seasoning on the meat. I added some black olives with the green onions, tomatoes, and didn't use any jalapenos, also put some enchilada sauce on the top tortilla just to make sure it wouldn't be dry. We ate them with sour cream and avocado on top and they were the best.

We loved this!!  I am a huge fan of Taco bell's mexican Pizza (minus the beef) so I was glad to find a recipe that comes close online...the only difference?  This one is MUCH better!  I use ground turkey and its SO good!  One pizza serves my husband and I both.

This recipe got such rave reviews from my huisband that he wanted to eat for 3 days in a row including taking it in his lunches! I can't speak highly enough of the recipe. Old El Paso Fat Free Refried Beans are the best for this. as is Cheddar cheese on one layer and Monterey Jack seperately on another. Just don't be skimpy on the cheese. I'm going to try it with chicken or shrimp next! WAY TO GO JIMMY!!!

I'm sure this will be even better when I have higher quality ingredients (I don't reccomend the walmart-brand refried beans-- they're beyond bland) and also have the tomatoes on hand, but as I made it, we really enjoyed it. About the only thing I changed was using an anaheim pepper instead of jalepeno, along with adding more garlic. This was surprisingly easy to throw together, especially if you mix the refried beans in with the meat/onion mixture-- makes it easier to spread that way.

This recipe was better than i thought it would be. I picked it because it appeared to be very easy. It was very easy to make and tasted pretty good. I would not give it a 5 as a perfect. Very few recipes get this but i think it deserves a 4. The only thing is the tortillas weren't really that crisp after it was done so the pizza was kind of droopy but it was still good. Very good idea how it was put together.

very good.. will definately make this one again. I used whole wheat tortillas since that is what I had on hand. Black olives would be great on this too. I used taco sauce since I was out of salsa... I am sure fresh homemade salsa would be great on it... quick and easy... thanks Jimmy..

Good blend of flavors in this recipe but not what I was expecting in the finished product. I tried this recipe thinking it would be simular to a fast food chains recipe for mexican pizza but was not it. I did like this recipe for the ease of preparation for on busy weeknight meals. Next time I think I might try frying the tortilla in oil to make it crispier and adding some cilantro and guacamole to the mix  yummm..Thank you for this recipe Jimmy! I will add this recipe to our monthly menu.

Easy to make and turns out looking like a million bucks.  I didn't have a pie plate for the recipe so I just cooked it on a pizza pan and it turned out great.  Will make again!! Oh yeah and it was pretty tasty.

I really liked this because it's like others have said - I already had all the ingredients in the house.  I agree with another reviewer who stated to add a small amount of liquid into the ground beef mixture.  I used 95% lean meat, so not alot of fat or juice, and the seasonings made it dry, but with just alittle water, it was fine. I didn't use the pie pan - we just fixed them on cookie sheets and they came out great.  Thanks!

This recipe is easy to adapt to your family's taste. I did subtitute green bell pepper for the jalapeno peppers and removed the green onions. I omitted on half of a tortilla the refried beans and salsa for my eldest son. All the family enjoyed it. The only drawback is that it is quite long to prepare, but I must admit I added water (about 3/4 cup) with the spices after cooking the meat and allowed to simmer. I think however that this step worth the extra time it as it increased the flavor.

I signed on just to let you know this recipe was the best. If you are in the mood for a mexican pizza from Taco Bell forget it this was way better. I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks

What a great, fun recipe with delicious results! This dish has a beautiful presentation - very colorful and festive! I didn't have any salsa and used bottled enchilada sauce instead - the blend of spices of vegetables was very complementary. Will be my meal next year for Cinco de Mayo! Thanks!

The only changes I made was that I baked the tortillas a little first, also only cooked the onions with the meat, added the garlic with the seasonings. I also added a little cheese on top of the beans and meat to hold it together. Turned out great!

Fairly quick, easy, tasty and economical recipe that‚Äôs much more reminiscent of a Burrito Pie than a pizza. If I make again, I‚Äôll chop the tomatoes, jalape√±os and green onions together for a sprinkle-on topping and put it both over and under the cheese.

Good grief, this was good!  Used tomato basil tortillas and followed the recipe exactly (except for using 1 pound of hamburger meat instead of a half)!  Super delish!

Great, easy meal! We made only one change. Instead of adding spices we just added taco seasoning mix then cooked as instructed.

So, so good! We both really enjoyed it. I was even "instructed" to make it again two days later. I call it Mexican pie because it resembles a pie much more than a pizza. This is a keeper.

To the person who said this had no relation to pizza..... it is Mexican -- Mexican pizza's have these ingredients. Can't imagine how that could be confusing.

Good idea although next time I will use more spices. The seasonings in this recipe were mediocre and bland as we prefer more heat and flavor.

Outstanding! Ha Taco Bell who?!?! Will definitely make it again. Only difference was I hardened the tortillas in the oven first and didn't measure any of the seasonings.

My mom used to make something like this when I was a kid, from a recipe she got at work from a friend. I decided to try it myself. It's rather easy to make, just a little messy with all of the components. I can think of ways to sub ingredients to ones taste or what's in the fridge and still keep with the Mexican flavors. One change I made was subbing about 1/2 package of ground Johnsonville sausage for the ground hamburger. I decided to save some time and baked them in my NuWave oven. I would have liked them a little more crisp, but the texture is similar to what I remember as a kid.

Quick & easy. We didn't use the jalapeno because I thought the beef with the spices was strong, but DO USE THIS or chilies.  It was mild which was a surprise. Will make again.

Delicious.  My husband liked it so much, we're having it again tomorrow.
I halved the recipe, meaning it should serve 4, but for a main course, it only served the two of us.  I added more cheese, more salsa, chopped chillies instead of sliced and more of them but it still wasn't overly spicy/hot. Perfect.

Turned out great. I added alittle cayanne pepper as well. I made my own flour tortillas and instead of making 2 pizzas i used a deep dish pie plate and did 2 layers.. I sub the refried beans for black beans because I didn't have any refried beans and put alittle cheese on top of the beef and bean layers as well as on top... Very good and quick!

I changed the recipe to create a vegetarian version using Frieda's Soy Taco meatless taco filling and Weight Watchers Mexican Style Blend Cheese.  It was great!

Excellent meal, just needed a little more heat I think.  Not sure just how to add it, but I'll try something next time. Recipe is great as is,  whole family likes it.  I should have paid better attention to the portions, this makes a bit to much for 3 people, hopefully it's good for leftovers.  If you like hot stuff, add a some more heat to it, otherwise follow the directions and remember portions...
Thanks again.

This was very yummy and easy to do. Im afraid that my kids found the salsa too hot. Next time I would just leave it off and save it for dipping with for Adults.

This was alright. I used homemade non-fried re-fried beans (which unfortunately turned out bland, and I only realized this after eating the pizza), skipped the sour cream & jalapeno peppers & green onions, used all extra old cheddar as my cheese and used pie dough to make the crust instead of tortillas. I used a seasoning blend that contained the spices in this recipe (along with a few others). We weren't crazy about this pizza.

Awesome pizza. Love being able to control the salt content. The flavor is excellent, even better than something I can buy from Taco Bell. After the first one, I added a bit of Taco Bell sauce poured over the meat, and sprinkled on a few diced tomatoes before adding the top layer tortilla.

I don't think I'd call this a pizza, but it was a fantastic casserole! I didn't have refried beans, so I just mashed up a can of black beans instead. Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

This was good but not great.  I feel like it was missing something but can't put my finger on it.  I would pre-crisp the tortillas for sure.  I pre-crisped mine but should have let them go a little longer because the bottom still came out a little soggy.  Over all not too bad!

This was excellent.  It was so easy to make, and it was a good way to change things up for "Mexican night."  My husband said it's the best meal I've made in a long time. Thanks, Jimmy!

This was really good.  I used leftover roasted chicken.  The seasoning was just right.  I could prepare each family member's pizza with the 'toppings' that they like.  Everyone thinks this is a winner!

We really enjoyed this. Hubby said it was better than the Taco Bell pizzas he had growing up. Pretty much followed the recipe except for using ground turkey and adding a little extra cheese. Thanks for a new favorite!

I attempted to make this dish a little healthier by using chicken. The chicken made the dish a little bland. Next time I will spice it up using hot sauce for a kick. I also toasted the shells in the oven for 3 minutes each side. Maybe I'll break down and use beef next time.

This was a fun recipe! I used ground turkey instead of beef to make it more health conscience. Covered the top tortilla with homemade taco sauce, then diced tomatoes, cheese and green onions.

Very filling and good.  I would have been happier if my tortilla ended up a little crispy.  We used ground turkey breast instead of beef and I cut back back a little on the cheese, served with hot sauce and sour cream.

I would give this 3.5 stars if they would let me.  This was easy to make and put together.  My only complaint about the dish was that I was expecting the bottom tortilla to get crisp with the cooking spray on the pan and it actually got soggy with the beans.  This would be a great busy night meal.  Thanks for sharing.

Yum! A great recipe! I replaced the  seasonings with the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site, to taste. Also, I used veggie meat crumbles in place of the meat and it was very tasty! Next time I will crisp the tortillas up in the oven before spreading heated refried beans over them. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these for super bowl. Was a great hit! If they sit out on table to long the edges will dry out, so you might want to cover with cheese completely before baking. Otherwise great!!!

I made this for dinner the other night and it was great.  I made a few changes, instead of using salsa for the top layer I spread the top tortilla with red enchilada sauce, and I used the package taco seasoning for a quick shortcut.  A good recipe, and quick too!

Made some slight modifications...used turkey beef, taco seasoning instead of all the spices, no jalapenos to keep it mild, no salsa only fresh veggies.  Nice change from tacos or burritos.

My 7 year old daughter prepares this and I just brown the beef and put it in the oven.  She loves it, and so do I.  I use the pillsbury pizza dough and just layer the ingredients on top of the dough and bake it.  It's an awesome recipe and have added it into my regular rotation as "fun food".  Anytime I can get my little one to eat protein makes me happT.

This was ok.  I also added a third tortilla shell (as some one earlier had mentioned) and used more refried beans.  I didn't like the flavor of the ground beef.  Next time I'll just use a package of taco mix for the ground beef layer.  But it was interesting at least.

Nice, fun recipe.  I didn't think the ground beef was necessary -- I like a previous reviewer's idea of using refried beans with sausage already in it.  We added sour cream and more salsa to our servings.

This was so tasty! It had a nice combination of flavors. It had a similar flavor of a burrito but a nicer presentation. I omitted the jalapeno peppers for the kids' sake, and we had sour cream on the side. Will definitely make again!

This was really good!  I added some water to the ground beef and spices and let it simmer.  I also left out the jalepenos just because they are too hot for our family.  My picky 5 year old asked me to make this again.  A keeper!

I used a gluten-free pizza crust mix instead of tortillas and baked it at 425. It was delicious!  Even my mom who normally doesn‚Äôt care for things that are out of the ordinary (like gluten-free) throughly enjoyed it.

Good, except making it by just baking burrito shells in over for only 10 minutes ended up with them being soggy. Reheated leftovers and they were REALLY soggy the next day. We tried grilling them on the skillet the next time we made it and pretty much same result. Good otherwise.

I didn't add the jalapeno peppers and used Bush's vegetarian beans instead of refried beans.  Also I used a whole bag of Boca crumbles to keep it vegetarian.  Three of us ate 3/4 of it for dinner.  Serving it to 8 people would not be very filling, but it would be fine with other food added.  I will be making it again.

My family loves these. I follow the recipe exactly. I recommend some taco sauce to put on the very top but other than that, these are perfect.

I‚Äôm a pretty new cook, so this was super easy for me to make and follow along. I made it as is because I like to try the recipe the way the person intended it and then think about what I would do next time.

I used leftover shredded chicken from taco Tuesday and followed the rest of the instructions. The salsa made the top tortilla a little soggy but other than that my family loved the idea! I loved using all of my leftovers from taco night with less hassle. We topped our pizza with tomatoes, onions, peppers, olives, avocados, cilantro and Greek yogurt (sour cream). I forgot the lettuce.  Definitely will make this again!

I don't know if I did something wrong or I used the wrong tortillas or salsa or something but my tortillas were SO soggy when finished.  I even let it bake an extra 5-7 mins to let the tortillas get extra crispy before topping it and putting it back in the oven.  The leftovers especially were practically inedible.  Although the concept and flavor are great, I will not make this again.

Great quick and easy recipe!! My husband, teenage son and I really liked it, and I will definitely be making it again. I read the reviews, and toasted the bottom tortilla before assembling, and baked it on a cookie sheet. We had all the usual taco toppings to put on top. I doubled the recipe, but no need. These things are huge!

Pretty good, and quick to make on a weeknight.  Toasted the tortilla first in the oven and then added everything.  I didn't have any refried beans and didn't seem to miss them either.

This was delicious. The bottom tortilla ended up kinda soggy or I would have given this 5 stars. Next time I will put the tortillas in the oven with no non-stick spray and with no beans or anything on them, just to get them to crisp up a bit before adding everything in layers. I ended up putting some crispy chopped lettuce on top to give it some crunch.

Very flavorful, a touch spicy with half the pepper, and no jalapenos. Taste somewhat like layered enchiladas, but more meat and a different flavor.

Great recipe, only thing you are doing wrong is using flour tortillas. If you really want the best Mexican pizza experience get corn tortillas and fry them in a shallow pot of oil then fill em up with refried beans and beef and top them and put them in the oven. Muy delicioso!  May I also suggest putting some taco sauce on top of the pie before the cheese and stuff and putting it in the oven.

It's a great meal on a budget and extremely easy to make. I want to give it a 5 for convenience, but it didn't really taste anything all that special. I'll be making this again, but only because of how easily I got multiple meals out of it

Very good idea! I substituted the beef for ground turkey and actually piled everything onto one tortilla (made two "pizzas"). Stilled turned out very well this way!

What a fun idea for a quick and easy Mexican-style dish. I didn't add cumin to the meat because I ran out, and added less chili powder per personal preference. I also didn't read the recipe right and used a whole pound of ground turkey. However, that was no biggie...I ended up making three pizzas on large size tortillas and could've easily gotten four out of the amount of meat and beans; they ended up being filled pretty thick. Instead of adding veggies and salsa on top (picky eaters), I just put the cheese on like the instructions and we ate with salad and dunked the pizza pieces in taco sauce, nacho cheese and sour cream since that's what we had in the fridge. I had watched the video and they used a baking sheet, so I lined a big jelly roll pan with parchment and baked that way. The tortillas were perfect, not too soggy and slightly crisp. Thanks for the dinner idea!

We used smaller tortillas because they fit the pie plate better and it allowed us to make one pizza for each person that was personalized with toppings.  My son enjoyed it so much that we had it two nights in a row!

OUTSTANDING!! We love Mexican food, I swear the big birthmark on my leg is the shape of Mexico, I love Mexican food so much. LOL. This came out far better than Taco Hell's (that's what we call it) Mexican Pizza. The only thing is, my fam will have me make it again.....and again....and again. Great recipe.

It has been about a year since I made this one, but I remember how much we enjoyed it. Prepared it "as" but with shredded baked chicken in lieu of ground beef and the addition of a bit of cotija cheese for texture. I agree that the salsa can really make this dish sparkle. Used the brownish rather hot salsa from La Finca in Davenport, IA.

I made this as directed and we thought it was delicious. I also like that it was easy to  make. I think next time I would add tomatoes, black olives and lettuce after baking. You could personalize this recipe any way you like.

Delicious!!  Used fresh salsa from grocery and a little cheese on the inside too. Added avocado once out of the oven.  Salsa made it a little soggy even after the 6 mins at 350 so I broiled it on high for about 6 mins until the cheese toasted a little and that did the trick! I also used 8" wheat tortillas and then if fit in my cake pans.  Also used 3/4 pounds to make 3 total pizzas for my family of 4 and it was more than enough for everyone to have 3 pieces (2 was enough for me with all the toppings!) and I have a 12 and 15 year old. Everyone loved it-thought the jalape√±os were a must!

Easy to make and fun to eat.  Much like Taco Bell's pizza.  Next time use taco seasoning in the beef, and green onions on top layer (not yellow onions).  I think 8" tacos in an 8" pie plate would work fine.

This is so quick and easy to put together and tastes delicious. This will be going into our regular rotation. I love how you can make it as hot as you want by adding more or less jalapenos. Thanks for this one.

Excellent! Both my husband and I enjoyed it as an alternative to tacos. As many others, baked bottom tortillas for 10 minutes prior to adding other ingredients. Will definitely make again!

On a recent trip to Puerto Vallarta, my wife and I and our Kelowna, BC friends had a little cooking contest at our VRBO condo.  Each of us had to make dinner - and the rest of us would vote on it - the winner, of course, getting the most votes.  On the first night, Lorne made tacos - and they were fine.  I made Jimmy's Mexican Pizza on the next night - and they were a hit!  So much so, that the women refused to cook on their pre-designated nights!  (they knew they had no chance).  Bottom line - don't change a thing!

Made for a dinner meal. It was good but seemed more like an appetizer. I doubled the meat and it made way too much for 2 people.  Should have cut the recipe in half.  One "pizza" would have been perfect.

The presentation is on point! It's what drew me to this recipe. It's packed with flavor and the flavor is out of this world. The only thing I did different was add in about 1/4 cup of jalapeno juice when I cooked the burger. I am very pleased with this recipe. I'm going to have to do it again, and very soon.

Easy to make this pizza, we didn't have the refried  beans as listed in the receipe but it still turned out very flavorful.
My toddlers thought it was fun to eat which automatically makes this a winning dinner option.

I made this recipe for  super bowl. Followed it exactly except eliminated onions and chili powder.  Everyone loved it!  Perhaps I will try to cook the first step ahead of time. Thank you for sharing Jimmy.   Next time I may add ground chicken breast.    ---Cyn Alp

Made this on superbowl sunday and it was a hit. Substituted the slasa for green chili and it was awesome. My suggestion would be to use some black olives, and yellow bell peppers on top. 

Thanks for the recipe

I made this for my boyfriend, and he really enjoyed it. He asked that I rate it 4 stars, stating that "Four stars IS good!" I hate to be THAT person who changes the recipe up, but I did a tad. First off I used ground turkey, and added a little extra salt. I also fried my flour tortillas quickly in bacon grease I had in a cast iron skillet on the stove before putting them onto a baking sheet. I then layered the beans, meat, salsa, cheese, tomatoes, green onions, and jalape√±os on top without an additional tortilla, as I was trying to save a little on carbs. I put a dollop of sour cream into a ziplock baggie, cut off the tip, and piped the cream onto the top in the shape of a heart. Yep, I'm a cheese-ball. He thought it was cute though. Served it with a beer and it was a hit. It was also extremely easy and kid-friendly (if you make sure you make it mild), so if _I_ were to choose a rating, I'd probably boost it up to 5 stars for moms out there. I'll definitely make again. Thanks, Jimmy.

Spices made the meat way too dry.  Needed cheese in the middle to help hold it together.  Don't try to crisp the tortillas first, end result will be a tostada.  Very messy to eat.  This reminded me of a taco enchilada casserole.  I won't make this again.

It wasn't bad but it was not at all like a pizza.  The recipe could definitely be improved by adding a little cheese with the meat when it goes into the oven the second time so the bottoms and tops meld together more cohesively.  I'd lose the paprika, reduce the cumin some (too dominant a flavor), reduce the chili powder some, too.  Also, replace the salsa with some homemade pico de gallo, and finally, forget the green onion, garnish with cilantro and finally chopped serrano peppers(optional). Oh, and increase the oven heat to 450 for the last ten minutes.

Great recipe... however, I and most of the western US and probably all of Mexico would call this a 'Quesadilla'... maybe a New Mexican Pizza - because all of New Mexico uses ground beef in their recipes.

The pizza was a little dry for my taste because of the beans and the meat. I will recommend to add more sauce or sour cream to it.  Overall was very tasty and my husband loved it!

I make this about 3 times a month, sometimes more. I love it! Tip for vegetarians missing the taste of Taco Bell, use Morning Star Farms Crumbles and season like regular taco meat. Even your meat eating friends will eat it that way. Also I have a toaster oven instead of a regular oven and the instructions work just fine for it, no need to adjust the time or temperature.

This was so good; my husband loved it! I did add 1 pound of hamburger instead of a 1/2 pound, just made it more hearty, still had a strong flavor with the original measurements of spices :) I really liked having the fresh veggies on top :)

Good, but does not serve  8 unless you aren't very hungry!  More like 4 (each person gets 1/2 of a "quesadilla")

I really liked this recipe! The only thing I changed was the salsa and I added 2 tortillas (whole wheat healthy kind) on top and bottom. Also instead of regular salsa I toped it with black beans and corn salsa (recipe is on here too) ! So fab !

Delicious!  I love Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza but find this even better!  Made this for my family tonight for dinner and it was a hit! I used one of the Pico De Gallo recipes on the site here in place of the tomatoes, onions and jalapenos for an extra kick.

Even my picky husband liked this.  I only had 3 tortillas so stacked them up on my pizza stone.  I thought a little heavy on spice, but hubby didn't.  It's all gone.  No leftovers.

I put a bit of shredded cheese and salsa on top of the ground beef; otherwise I followed the recipe. While I was making it, my husband asked what happened to making pizza. As he ate his third piece, he stopped asking. They loved this--and everyone really loved the inclusion of the refried beans.

I am vegan vegetarian.  I didn't use (veggie) meat, just the refried beans with a little taco seasoning and the sauteed onions.  Otherwise, I did the recipe using Daiya monzarella and cheddar imitation cheese.  It was AWESOME!  I used to like the taco bell mexican pizza, but their crust was a little sweet??  Anyways, if you toast the tortillas first by spraying a little oil and putting them in the oven, you can get it nice and crispy.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

I found this recipe a few months ago and it has become a family favorite. I love that the recipe only uses a small amount of meat, but still makes 2 pies, enough to feed my household of 4 adults. Very economical and still delicious.

I like this recipe because it shows to put the second tortilla on for the first bake time. We upped the time to 15 min so the tortilla would be a little more crispy, but the flavor was DELICIOUS!

This was wonderful. We even used ground turkey, but thought the spices made excellent flavorings for a bland meat. I did prebake the tortillas to crisp them up, and mixed my refried beans (made from the Refried Beans without The Refry from this site) in with the meat instead of layering them separately. We'll have this one again and again. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent. As per other reviews I cooked the bottom tortilla about 5 minutes first. I also used one pound of hamburger between the two. Came together quick and easy. Great weeknight meal.

I used large whole wheat tortillas that I crisped in the oven before assembling everything. Used a full pound of beef, and pepper jack cheese; I left off the jalapenos. Everyone enjoyed this recipe a lot. These would be great even without the meat.

made this for dinner last night and it was soooo good! tasted just like taco bell, but better because i knew what went into it. i just baked them on a cookie sheet (with foil) instead of a pie pan and it turned out fine. will make this again and again!

My boyfriend liked this so much he took the 2nd one with him to work when I wasn't paying attention. Will definitely make again--love the idea of making them in pie pans and its easy to substitute your favorite ingredients, or what you have handy!

This is very good, very quick and easy. My kitchen challenged husband made it when I was out with back pain. It turned out great. We didn't have green onions or tomatoes, so we skipped those. We also only had mozzarella cheese so we used that.
I definitely recommend using sour cream as topping, if you like sour cream. Also, I think next time I'll put some corn in with the meat mixture.

We will make this again, it's a great last minute dinner.

Soooo good! I used ground turkey, lessened the chilli powder so as not to be too spicy, whole wheat tortillas, and left out the refried beans. I added some extra cheese and some olives here and there and it was heavenly!

Delicious, easy, and amazingly filling. My husband and I both loved it! Followed another reviewers recommendation and stuck the bottom tortillas in the the oven while it was preheating. They came out deliciously crunchy! Good stuff!

Great recipe! Will definitely be making this again! Make sure not to put too much salsa on them or it will overpower.

Delicious! The only thing I would change is to go easy on the salsa next time. I used a bit more than the recipe to avoid it drying, but a lighter "sauce" would have been better.

My husband loved this recipe!!! He could not stop eating it and when it was gone he was SO sad, I did bake the bottom tortilla for 5 min to have it crisp it up a bit!!! You must try it, you can customize to, make it more spicy if you want

I used to LOVE Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza before I became a conscientious consumer.  Now I won't go near the place, but this recipe gives me that taste I have been missing.  The first time I made it I found the bottom tortilla was too soft, so now I put just the bottom in the oven for about 3-4 minutes before I spread the beans and meat on it.  I have tried it with beef and turkey and both are equally delicious.  The only other change I make is to use taco sauce instead of salsa under the cheese.  I am so happy I found this recipe!

I really wanted to give this recipe a 5 star review, but I made exactly and is lacking something. I cook a lot of Tex-Mex, I usually add sour cream to the beans if canned, cook beef in the ingredients, drain and add more of what have been drained off, never use salt if using something canned. This is actually a very wonderful recipe just missing something. FYI: Not on just this recipe but anything asking for green onions, keep the stalks, plant them and cut your own as needed, or freeze. Thank you Jimmy, I did enjoy!!

Even though I made a few changes due to what I had on hand this was an excellent flavorful dinner. My husband loved it ! I used only mozzarella since that's what I had. I also didn't have any green onion or sour cream so I dolloped guacamole on top. To cut a few calories I used 1/2 the amount of re-fried beans. Great recipe..

Very good. Read other reviews before making this. I used a whole pound of ground meat. Also baked the bottom layer tortilla for a few minutes first to ensure it would not become soggy (not sure that needs to be done).

If I change ANY part of a recipe I normally won't review it because it isn't based on the original.  But since I am a vegetarian, the only thing I changed was using Morningstar veggie crumbles instead of ground beef and put the tortillas in the oven to crisp them up a bit before putting it together.  This recipe was easy and absolutely delicious.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thank you Jimmy!

These were ok but there was something missing.  I added jalapenos but I still think it needed some more heat.  Also, I wanted the tortillas to be crispy but they werent.  I would def make these changes if I made this again!

Very yummy & easy to make. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is b/c it's a little spicy. I used one pound of ground beef and it made 3 pizzas. Delish!

delish! I didn't have green onions or the jalapeno's and just used regular cheddar and it was still great. My son love them. I'm sure they'd be even better with the other ingredients.

I've had this one to try for a long time, glad that I finally did. I used ground turkey and whole wheat flour tortillas and added some lettuce to the top. Great easy dinner.

This was delicious and so easy to make! Instead of 10-inch tortillas, I divided it up among smaller, individual-sized tortilla rounds so I could take leftovers to work for lunch.  The seasonings used for the ground beef are a revelation to me -- definitely going to become my new taco seasoning from now on!

I made this the other night and LOVED it.  The only thing I did differently was to add the tomatoes, some shredded lettuce and fresh cilantro after it was done cooking.  I can't wait to make this again!!

Pretty good! Made this for a quick dinner tonight. While my fiance and I both enjoyed our pizzas, we each had our "gripe" (if you can even call it that!) about them. For me, it was the sogginess (but an easy fix, nonetheless). For my fiance, it was the beans - he likes them in some things, but often times he doesn't (I keep trying...). Even tho I used a very SPARINGLY small amount on his pizza, that's all he could taste lol! In all fairness, I did change Jim's recipe quite a bit. Instead of plain 'ol refried beans, I used a can of lime and chili flavored ones that I had in my pantry (and I didn't use even 1/2 the can!). I substituted 9 oz. of beef chorizo for ground beef, Queso Chihuahua for montery-jack blend cheese and (jarred) pickled jalapeno slices for fresh. I think next time I'll a) omit the beans alltogether (from my fiance's pizza!) and b) pre-crisp my tortillas on my pizza stone FIRST. I will still use my 9 inch round pans to bake my pizzas (worked great!). My tortillas fit in them perfectly! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jimmy! This is a great standby to add to my regular menu rotation. :-)

So when first looking at the recipe I was not that impressed, but I was looking for an easy mexican meal thingy for when I'm pressed on time.  Made it first time, doubled the meat and skipped the green onions because I didn't have any, and it was amazingly good. Even the next day my husband and I were fighting over the left overs.

Great.  Just like Taco Bell, but much tastier!  I omitted the paprika and substitued oregano and after my ground beef was cooked and seasoned, I added 1/2 cup salsa and 1/4 cup sour cream to make my lean ground beef moist.  So quick and simple.  You just can't go wrong with this meal.

I had this meal on the table in 45 minutes, which is always nice! It came out really good and I used chicken instead of beef.  My pizza ended up tasting mostly like enchiladas, but I didn't mind! Plenty of leftovers and it was easy to make.  Next time I make this, I may put tortilla chip crumbles on before the cheese to make it crunchy.

Made this a little healthier by using lentils instead of ground beef and using whole wheat tortillas. Tasty mix - reminded me of 7 layer dip.

These are great! They are thicker than the typical TacoBell Pizza, but I found if you layered the thinnest of beans and meat and then spray a small amount of cooking spray on the top tortilla first round in the oven, it crisped up more! Its the closest you will get to a TB Pizza without frying. thnks for the recipe

This was very delicious and perfect for a cold evening! I only had green onions so I used those while cooking the meat and omitted them as part of the topping. Next time, I am going to put salsa on top if the meat mixture before adding the last tortilla. It seemed too dry for me. I might cut back on the Cumin as well. My boyfriend loved it and is taking left overs to work tomorrow. Something he never does. I paired this with a homeade Mexican Rice and it was so good! Much better than going out to eat. Thank You!!

This was really good! I'm not sure how an earlier reviewer managed to only dirty one dish, because I had quite a bit of clean up, but it was tasty! In my opinion, waaaay too heavy on the refried beans, and I love refried beans. I didn't use quite the whole 16 oz can. I think a thin coating on each tortilla would have been plenty. Also, next time I will try it with my usual taco seasoning next time (taco seasoning 1, this site) instead of the seasonings listed-didn't do much for me. Also, the meat seemed kind of dry after draining the fat when I added the spices so I added 1-2 T water to mix it in. Since I only had 1 pie plate, I cooked them seperately...the first one I did with the salsa on the tortilla, the 2nd one I tried without the salsa on it to see if it was less soggy and it didn't really seem to make much difference. Of course, the second one also ended up with much more refried beans too, so that one nust was not as good all around. Great recipe and I will be making this again, although not as a weeknight meal...a little to messy for that I think. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this was so easy & good! I thought it wouldn't feed 6, so I used a whole pound of hamburger (mixed in a little chopped jalapenos) & added an extra clove of garlic - didn't double the spices though. I also sprinkled some of the cheese on top of the beans & added another tortilla before the meat (using 3 all together). It WAS way better than Taco Bell's Mexican Pizza in so many ways & we all really enjoyed it!

I made this a couple nights ago and like someone else said, I used taco seasoning but...I won't use taco seasoning again I think because it tasted too much like my mexican lasagna I make except with beans. :) I'm going to stick with the recipe next time and NOT put taco seasoning in. It is too strong for this I think. Other than that though...we all loved this Mexican Pizza. Very yummy!

This was good...I was trying to find something to make with limited ingredients since I had a bare kitchen. I omitted the veggies, and put in ketchup trying to please my kids because they don't like g onions, tomatoes and such, but they didn't like it. My husband liked it, and next time I will make it per the recipe because if the kids aren't going to eat it, I might as well make it right. They'll just have to have quesadillas. :) Thanks!

Thanks Jimmy, for an easy recipe, now in rotation.  As another reviewer, I attempted to add a middle layer, but I think if I were to do it again, I'd bake them in separate intervals (the middle layer was a too soft) -- hence, for my own preference, I'll stick with the recipe as is written.  Although... I did add all the seasonings to the cooking meat for a richer flavor.  MMMMmmm...

This was a tasty meal that my family enjoyed.  Like another reviewer, I used the lime chicken fajita meat in this because I didn't have any ground beef at the time. It worked very nicely.

These were so good. I used some leftover lime chicken from the "Lime Chicken Soft Taco" recipe on this site. Also homemade refried beans and homemade Pico de gallo. Sooooo good and super easy. My husband ate two all to himself! Thanks for a great and easy recipe. I will be making this alot.

Easy and yummy. This is a great recipe to play around with. A little messy and hard to cut, but that didn't bother my kids..lol
A fun easy week night dinner. Will make again. Thx!

My 5yo son loved making this with me, and he loved eating it too! We made two pizzas.  One for dh and I, and one for the kids so we could adjust it according to what they like.  (ie. ranch dressing instead of salsa--can you believe it??)

This recipe is fantastic!  I used ground chicken instead of the beef. My husband ate the whole pizza, no leftovers!  Next time I will top it off with shredded lettuce, salsa, and guacamole.

I made this recipe for my husband and two kids ages 5 and 2 1/2.  It was so easy to do, and tasted delicious.  To save some time, I used taco seasoning for the meat instead of the seasonings listed.  If you like Taco Bell's Mexican pizza, this is better.  I am adding this to our Mexican night rotation.

This was awesome! My 12-year-old made it for us and it was great! Next time we will make it with taco meat because the meat was a little dry, but otherwise, two thumbs up!

This was very good...and very filling. I didn't have any green onions, so I put avocados on instead for a little green. I made 3 of them.....we will be having it for leftovers for lunch tomorrow (warmed over in the toaster oven)
