I tried this recipe because I had all the ingredients and a dehydrator. I think the directions need a little help - for instance, it never does mention draining the almonds. I let mine sit on paper towels while I prepared the other ingredients. My mixture was still pretty wet and very loose. The recipe also doesn't mention how much "batter" to use for each cookie. I used a small cookie scoop to form mine. I needed to line my dehydrator trays with parchment paper (poked full of holes) or the "batter" would have fallen right through. My cookies were completely dry at the 12 hour mark. I probably won't make these again. Rather than a strawberry flavor, I mostly taste the raisins - the very dry raisins. They almost have a burn taste to them from the drying process.

These were pretty good. Kind of just tastes like dried strawberries and raisins. I love that they are healthy and easy, so I would like to play with some modifications to improve the flavor a bit.

I've made these cookies twice. The first time I used blueberries and currants since that's what I had in my cupboard. They were really good. So, I made them again with strawberries and raisins and they were even better. I want to try this recipe with cashews instead of almonds. Great snack for everyone. People are a bit put off when they ask for the recipe and find out they take about 24 hours to prepare!

These are delicious used cranberries in place of raisin.
