***PLEASE READ IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH CRUMBLY, GREASY FUDGE!*** I've used this recipe probably 50 times, and I've had it not turn out twice.  The first time I used generic marshmallow cream.  I don't recommend using any store brand ingredients in this fudge.  The second time I used an enameled cast iron french oven, and it didn't turn out that time, either.  Every time I use my calphalon, it turns out great.  Also.....work fast!  The faster the better.  Don't start timing until the mixture is at a full, rolling boil and then reduce the temperature slightly so that it doesn't scorch.  Stir the entire five minutes and have the chocolate chips measured out ahead of time so you can dump them in as soon as you turn off the heat and stir like mad.  Get the chips fully incorporated and pour immediately.  It never fails!

Absolutely incredible fudge! It is perfectly smooth, creamy, chocolately, and all-around enjoyable. Try putting the marshmallow creme in the microwave for about 15 seconds before adding it to the pan; it will come out of the jar much easier. Though the cooking experience would have been less stressful with one, a candy thermometer really isn't necessary. One tablespoon of butter is just the right amount, and boiling the mixture for around 7 minutes instead of five can assure that the fudge will solidify. Some found that the recipe was a bit too sweet, so taking out 1/4 cup of sugar can tame some of the super-sweetness. Finally, using 2 cups of the semisweet chips and 1 cup of the milk chocolate chips instead of the other way around can make an even richer fudge (especially for those dark chocolate lovers like me). It is THE BEST fudge recipe around, and I am sure that I will make it again and again for years to come.

This was my first time to make fudge and it turned out great!  Many people at my dessert buffet said that it was the best fudge they had ever had.  It was so creamy - not grainy at all.  I have to say, though, that I messed up the first time I tried it.  Because I had the marshmallow creme in the very bottom of the pan and I got the heat too high too fast, I burned the marshmallow creme into hard brown chunks!  The second time, I kept the temperature at low until it was mixed up well and then I turned the heat up to medium and boiled it.  That worked like a charm.

Basically, this represents a terrific, 5-star fudge recipe; I would tweak the instructions, though.  First, cook for 6-1/2 minutes, because at 5 minutes, it really needs to be kept in the fridge to maintain the right texture.  If you DO prefer the super-creaminess of the 5-minute cooking time, then it will be far less "melty" if, after refrigeration, you cut it into squares and let the squares "air-harden" on racks or trays until the sides are not tacky.  (Obviously, this is kind of a pain, so I go with the 6-1/2 minutes!)  And finally: This is too much butter.   1 tablespoon works well, and the butter can actually be left out completely if you like.

OMG! You really don't need another review to tell you how creamy this fudge is! I do want to offer you some tips in making fudge as it was passed along to me and it does make a difference. Do NOT substiute butter for margarine. Margarine has a higher water content and it will disturb the balance in fudge making. As well, you should also use whole evaporated milk. I found using 2%, 1% or fatfree evaporated milk, I don't get the absolute best results as i do with whole evaporated milk. I start out stirring until well blended on low heat first so that the sugar is completely disolved. This will prevent grainy texture. I've also been told not to make fudge in high humidity or rainy days as the moisture causes the fudge not to set as well which i guess i find that to be true today as it is raining and humidity is slightly high. Therefore, i do find this fudge is too soft. They say making fudge is very moody. This is the best recipe and will be a keeper in my family.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Coincidentally, a recipe very close to this is on the back of the Marshmallow Fluff jar.  My daughter and I made it last night.  The secret is to use a candy thermometer to be sure the fudge reaches the soft ball stage (234 degrees).  Ours didn't reach temperature until well after five minutes boiling time, possibly because we kept the flame low to prevent burning.  (Using a double boiler, as someone here suggested, is a great idea; we may try that the next time we make this.)

My mother used to make fudge every Christmas, and although I wanted to carry on that tradition the traditional fudge recipes were all so hard, and never seemed to turn out well. I tried this recipe last year, and not only was it quick and super easy, the fudge tasted spectacular! I made 3 kinds (just like Mom!), chocolate fudge with nuts, chocolate mint fudge (added mint extract) and butterscotch fudge with pecans (used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate). My family loved all three kinds, but the butterscotch was rated the best. Thank you Kelly for sharing this recipe! Now I can carry on the tradition of delicious fudge for Christmas.

Chocoholics Beware! This stuff is highly addictive! Sinfully rich, decadent, and creamy are just a few of the words that come to mind when describing this fudge. It's so good and so easy to make.  I did cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup and used a non-stick pan which I highly recommend. Bring this to a boill slowly, stir constantly and you should have no problems. I lined my 8x8 pan with Reynolds non-stick foil and it came out perfect. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I made this for 3 years now - let me tell you - THANK YOU AUNT TEEN - she rocks whoever she is.  everyone loves the fudge - i have made a couple changes over the years (sorry auntie) but try this:

instead of 1/2 cup of semi-sweet - use 1 cup 
(it removes some of the buttery/greasy)

nuke the mallow for 10 seconds first - it will come out of the jar easier!!!

and my absolute favorite addition is this: replace the semi-sweet with gharardelli chocolate choclate chips

HEAVEN - 

thanks again! this was great!!! and i agree with everyone else's ideas -must cook longer than 6 minutes until nice brown and YES LOW HEAT - med heat got out of control (i have gas stove) and got really greasy 

happy holidays!

I just made this for the first time last night. I've never made fudge before and I think that this is a very good one to begin with. It was really very easy and firmed up just like it should. I kept it on medium heat the entire time, stirring from beginning to end. I started the 5 minute timing right when just a couple bubbles tried to come up when I stopped stirring, and when I stirred then, you could 'feel' and 'hear' far more bubbles that were not visible to the naked eye, more under the thick surface. I think if you wait to just 'see' the rapid boil before starting the five minute time, you will overcook it, getting the hard result. Takes a little bit for it to start 'boiling' and you have to stop stirring from time to time to check for the first telltale bubbles. This was smooth and did not have a gritty sugary texture, not bad at all.

NOTE: To those who think it's too sweet so they cut back on the sugar then wonder why it comes out soupy, be aware that sugar is the structural element. It's the process of heating the sugar that makes fudge solidify later on. Fudge, by its very nature, is very, very sweet. If you don't like sweet candy, make something else - don't complain about the recipe. That said...Excellent fudge, smooth as silk. There are some distinct advantages of this recipe, most notably that the cooking is timed, rendering it possible to make without a candy thermometer. No need to watch that thermometer for what seems an interminable length of time while the mercury rises sooo slowly. I had trouble with the result being crumbly the first time I tried it. I couldn't get out of my mind all the glowing reviews praising the creaminess, and figured I must have done something wrong. The only thing that could have accounted for such a big difference was my fluff, which was a store brand. So I tried this again today with the REAL marshmallow fluff. SUCCESS! This time the result was perfectly, unbelievably creamy. For those who had trouble with crumbly, oily, or dry fudge, the most common cause is heating the sugar mixture too rapidly, meaning at too high a temperature. Before you begin, know that fudge is a process. It appreciates patience. Put your burner on medium-low, no higher. It will take a little longer to achieve the rolling boil, where you begin your 5 minute timing. Patience pays off big time!

Excellent!  I have made this recipe many times over.  A heavy gauge pan and a wooden spoon are a must with this fudge.

I took the top reviewers suggestions and used Jet Puffed marshmallow creme in this recipe and Nestle brand chocolate chips, NO store brands. The kids chose chopped peanuts to use in this recipe and I used a quality brand vanilla extract. I did not stir the peanuts in with the vanilla, I sprinkled them on top after I poured the fudge into the 8x8 pan. Following the top reviewers suggestions on how to prepare it, it was very simple. This is THE perfect fudge--it set up beautifully and the taste was excellent. This was a great recipe for my kids and I to make together, we had a blast. Six thumbs up from the kids and I!

I've been using this recipe for 35 years.  I normally make between 15-20 batches per year, depending on available time and requests from family and friends.  I originally got the recipe from the back of a Nestle Semi Sweet Chocolate Chip package.  It normally turns out great.  However, if you don't boil it long enough you'll need to eat it with a spoon.  If you boil it too long it will hard and crumbly.  

The best advise I could give anyone is to continuously stir and scrape the sides of the pan while cooking to avoiding scorching.  The other is to use a solid and heavy pan for cooking it to help hold the heat once you remove it from the stove and start adding the chips.  Too thin of a pan allows it to cool too quickly and it will begin setting up before you have all of the ingredients blended. 

The original recipe said to bring to a full boil and boil for 5 minutes.  From testing it with a candy thermometer that 5 minute boil time equates to the 234 degree soft ball stage.

I've used every type of chip and cooking candy I could find over the years, and usually had good results.  The only one that I considered not acceptable was made with cinammon chips.  It tasted almost like pumpkin pie filling.  If you like mint try adding a couple of drops of mint oil or mint essence when you stir in the chips.  

My latest experiment is with Heath packaged milk chocolate and toffee.  It makes a wonderful fudge.

One thing I've never been able to accomplish is making a batch of this in

This was amazingly good and easy. I browsed a ton of the reviews and here are some of the tips I used that made it so easy: pre-measure everything and have it all lined up and ready to go. Butter the sides of your saucepan. Reduce the butter to only ONE TABLESPOON (trust me on this, you don't need any more!). Zap the Fluf in micro for 12 seconds and it comes out much easier. Don't use generic Fluf. Use best quality chocolate chips...you are making FUDGE---this is not the time to buy generic, you want to taste quality chocolate! If you can, use a candy thermometer to make sure the sugar mixture reaches 234 degrees. STIR THE ENTIRE TIME! I cooked this in a heavy stainless pan on LOW and it came to a boil in a few short minutes (maybe less), then I started timing right at a full boil and it took about 5 1/2 minutes. Keeping it on low stops the bottom from burning, but it still boils mightily, that's for sure. Once it reaches 234 degrees, follow the recipe directions, BUT WORK QUICKLY. (It was a light brown color, btw.) Dump your chocolate in and beat like crazy to get it soft and shiny. Then add in your vanilla and nuts (if using). Again work as quickly as you can and beat like a maniac....you definitely need upper body strength for this one!

I can not for the life of me see how you get 48 servings from an 8x8 pan of fudge.But needless to say, I doubled this recipe and lined a 9x13 baking sheet. I dont cook the marsh. creme with the sugar and milk mixture. I added marsh. creme at the very end (will help keep fudge creamy and not dry it out), mixed thoroughly, then removed from heat and added choc chips. The put in fridge to set. This is probably the smoothest, creamiest fudge I've made. Note: If your fudge is too firm, dry or hard, you may be over cooking the milk/sugar mixture. It is important not to boil longer then 7 minutes, start timing it as soon as it starts to boil and try not adding the marshmellow creme until the very end!

**please read before you start!**  I just officially became an allrecipes member JUST to rate this fudge. It did not turn out - same problem a lot of people have had, and I think I know why.  The fudge seems to go great until you add the chocolate chips, then it seizes and becomes greasy and crumbly.  I just made another fudge recipe from this site with similar ingredients but much better results. The difference? The fluff was NOT mixed in during the heating stage. Only heat the evap. milk, butter and sugar. Bring to soft ball stage on candy thermometer, then LET COOL TO 125F, then add the fluff and flavoring ingredients (in the case of the other recipe it was PB.   I don't have the money to go out and buy the extra ingredients to try this one again, but based on the great success of the PB fudge, I'd say that's how to fix this one.  Now, what to do with the lump of chocolate crumble I have...?

I know it can get confusing reading through all these reviews, wondering who is right and what modifications really are needed ... But I made this fudge five times in the last couple of weeks, so here's the down low. 1) Make it as indicated; there is no need to tweak ingredients or the order to have good fudge. 2) Make it several times. That's what it takes to get familiar with how long it has to cook. The problem is, some of us have different definitions of what a "full boil" is, so you'll need to figure out for yourself what that is (is it when you see some bubbles? Lots of bubbles? The MOST bubbles?) and then start timing. If you cook too long, it ends up hard and crumbly and somehow less tasty. If you cook too short, it will be squishy. I wait until I see a moderate amount of bubbles (I've done it 5 times, so I kind of know by now how it should look), then cook for about 5.25 minutes. Really, experience is going to be your best friend here.

I made this fudge today and I must say it is quite tasty. However, the appearance of the fudge leaves something to be desired. It is really greasy (oil is oozing from it) and rough in texture. I am a seasoned cook, so I know I followed the recipe correctly, I am just wondering if this has happened to anyone else?

Never use Ghirardelli chocolate chips in this recipe.  I've made this at least a dozen times, and the only 2 times it didn't work were the only 2 times I used Ghirardelli chocolate.  For some reason, the mixture separates when using Ghirardelli chocolate chips. Grease puddles on the top and the fudge never sets properly.  Otherwise, this is a perfect recipe.

This fudge tastes just like professionally made fudge.  The trick is to heat the marshmellow cream slowly.  I started at low heat and increased to medium as it warmed. You constantly have to stir it too (don't stop for a second). If you follow this, the fudge will set and your pot will come out sparkling clean! Also can add less butter as it was oily in areas.

This fudge is so delicious and so easy.  I made it with 6 T of margarine instead of butter, and also with 1 cup of mini marshmallows instead of the marshmallow creme stuff.  And I used generic semisweet chocolate chips.  So it was very inexpensive, but still very, very good.

There are a lot of misleading reviews here, and the recipe is a bit unclear.  FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT SURE WHAT A FULL BOIL IS, READ:

**The first time I made this recipe, I literally waited until the liquid came to a VISIBLE, FULL BOIL.  DO NOT do this!  Start the 5 minute timer right when you see the tiniest, eeniest little bubble trying to come through.  THAT'S when you start the timer.  And while the 5 minutes is counting down, you won't see a FULL boil.  If you do, then you are going to have a really hard, lumpy mess once you put the chocolate in.  Trust me on this!  Oh...and I use a gas-flame stove, not an electric one.

This is my absolute favorite way of preparing fudge.  I use all semi-sweet chocolate and it turns out delicious.  Definitely make sure to boil for the full 5 minutes or the fudge will not set properly.  Even if this happens, it's just as delicious eaten with a spoon. (I know because I've made that mistake many times).  On the back of the Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Cream jar was a recipe for "Fantasy Fudge" that is almost identical to this one and tastes great!!  Thanks Kelly!!

Been making this for years and I have been told many many times that it is the best fudge the consumers have tasted. I use a variety of nuts and sometimes none at all for my nut allergic friends.
The only tip I have and I believe this is important. Do not add all the chips at once. That is why you get the oilyness. It is cooling the mixture too fast and de emulisifies the chocolate. I don't think de emulisifies is a word but you get what I mean. Add about a third at a time and get them thoroughly stirred in before you add more. This will keep the butter and oil or whatever is separating from doing so. I had the same trouble when I first started making chocolates but as I have become more experienced I have learned.

For me, this fudge will only turn out if I add the marshmallow creme at the end, with the chocolate chips. I made several attempts at this with cooking the creme, and every time the fudge seized up. However, when I added the creme at the end, it came out incredibly creamy and delicious.

The first batch i made was good.  I cut it in half, but accidentally used the whole recipe amount of evap. milk.  It turned out soft, but so good, at room temp.  Then the 2nd batch was crumbly.  As was the 3rd.  This was my first day to make fudge ever, and i cant figure out what makes fudge crumble.  Did i heat it too much or over cook it or what?  Anyone know why..  Im trying to duplicate my late mother in laws fudge for my hubby.  He says this taste is good, but crumbling makes it hard to eat.  Not pleasing to the tongue.

I seem to have the opposite problem of everyone else; my fudge was very thick and not at all pourable.  I snapped a wooden spoon in half trying to mix in the vanilla.  I just "pressed" in into a pan; it tastes all right, but the consistency is not great.  Even though it's easier not to check for the soft-ball stage, I think it makes for a better fudge if you do.

I love this recipe and it is a holiday staple in my house (great for gifts). I found (quite by accident) that it is even better with 2.5 c. mik choc chips and 1.5 c. semisweet. I have made it both with and without nuts and like both versions. 

My only caution is to be careful when adding the chocolate to the heated mixture. If the mixture is too hot and the chips get to warm too fast, the chocolate won't temper and the fudge will never set. Unfortunately this happened with my last batch and I had to throw the whole thing away (a sad and relatively expensive mishap). When it works though, this fudge is a real winner!

The BEST fudge recipe I've ever made!  It's creamy (not too stiff) and fudgy (not that semi-sweet chocolate chip flavor) and best of all it's fast (about 10 mins), easy, EASY and virtually fool proof (me usually being the fool).  I can't recommend this recipe enough!  Be careful with the heat though, I found med heat just barely too hot and it browned a bit on the bottom even with constant stirring.  Also I've noticed it gets grainy or tough if you cook it too hot, bring the heat up slowly and simmer it (at least that's what works for me).  Also, I don't use foil, just spray the pan with some Pam and it works great. Thanks for sharing this recipe and for those wondering - try it! Try it! Try it!

The fudge tastes great but was very oily and a bit grainy in texture.  Isn't fudge suppose to be smooth and creamy?  I know this has happend to someone else, does anyone know what I might have done wrong.

I admit I've been cooking with Allrecipes for a while now and I've never left a review. In this case, I felt I had to! I was truly scared to try fudge at first, but my boyfriend loves it and I thought I'd surprise him with some after a long day of training (he's a Marine). Wow. This was great. I followed the advice of some testers, and the way to make this creamy, in my opinion, really depends on these things: 1. Premeasure the chocolate chips so that you can mix them into the cooked mixture as soon as you pull it from the heat. 2. Pour immediately into the pan--the faster you pour, the less mess as you're putting it into the pan, which means a smoother, prettier top. 3. Cook for six and a half minutes rather than five. 4. Stir CONSTANTLY. I usually ignore this, but I just put on some good music and jammed while stirring for six minutes. It was fun!  Thanks, thanks, thanks for this recipe! I'm looking forward to trying some variations!

Good fudge. The key in making this fudge is when to start the 5 minute timer. If you wait 'till the pot is at a full boil the result will come out hard and the chocolate chips will not have time enough to melt before the fudge starts to set up. If you start the timer when the first "ploop" of the boil breaks the surface, the result will be a fudge, when cut in pieces, that you can dent the side of the piece with your fingers but is not sticky at all. I used the microwave to substantially melt the chocolate chips. Maybe it wasn't necessary but I wasn't taking any chances with the recipe fouling up while I was experimenting around with the boil time.

TERRIBLE!!!  Once I put the choc chips in, it turned into a crumbly mess that looked and almost tasted like dirt.  I called my mom (the candy expert) becuase I had made fudge with her so many times, and after going over the recipe, she told me that it was becuase you arn't supposed to heat marshmellow cream.  It carmelizes the sugar too quickly.  So I used her recipe the second time and it turned out perfectly.  I seriously can't believe that this recipe has such rave reviews with such a horrible mistake written into it like that!

I am so disappointed! I read all of the reviews and instructions-  I timed and measured everything precisely- yet, I too,ended up with something that looked like cookie dough once I added the chocolate chips! It never became smooth after stiring and stiring, so I thought I'd put it in the pan and see what the end result tastes like.  Well, it didn't pour-- so I pressed it down into the pan the best I could and waited for it to set in the fridge.  All I ended up with was big oily looking puddles on top of the grainy cookie dough looking mixture. I wish that someone could explain what is going wrong for those of us who had similar problems with this recipe. Because those of us that have failed are getting the same results.

The milk chocolate chips are what make all the difference in this recipe. Delicious, creamy and smooth! I made a mint chocolate version using mint chocolate chips for the semisweet and a few drops of peppermint extract instead of vanilla. I also wanted to use up some marshmallows so rather than buying a jar of creme, I used 16 large marshmallows which is equal to 7 oz. of marshmallow creme (mix the mallows in at the same time as the chips). Sprinkled with crushed peppermint pillow candies, it was pretty to look at as well as insanely delicious.

This is a great recipe!! I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips, and microwaved the marshmallow creme for 10 seconds as suggested by another individual. The key is to stir constantly, and I started with the heat on low and VERY VERY gradually turned the heat up to medium. The boil time was definitely greater than five minutes. Also, make sure you have everything you need at hand and prepared (such as the pan) before you start!!!

I had none of the problems reported by others. The chocolate didn't burn, and when all the ingredients were combined, it poured into the pan and firmed up in a couple of hours.

However, this candy does not taste like fudge to me, which is why I didn't give it a high rating as a fudge.  I had just finished making a batch each of vanilla walnut and penuche fudge the old-fashioned way (thermometer, no marshmallow, cooled before beating, etc.), and those candies (rich and creamy) are what I wanted in a chocolate fudge.

I knew this wasn't an old-fashioned chocolate fudge recipe, but it had gotten so many rave reviews, I couldn't resist trying it.  Knowing that the quality of the chocolate would make a difference, I used good quality milk and semi-sweet (100% cocoa butter chocolate with real vanilla) that I chopped and weighed (6 oz/cup).  I ended up with a creamy, firm chocolate candy that has a strong chocolate chip/candy bar taste.  It's good for what it is, but it isn't chocolate fudge.  This candy reminds me more of the chocolate candy made by combining chocolate chips and sweetened, condensed milk than it reminds me of real fudge.

So for anyone wanting an easy, creamy, chocolate candy that's cut into squares, this is a good recipe.  But I prefer true chocolate fudge made with unsweetened chocolate, and for my part, the extra effort required to make true fudge is worth it.  

I won't be making this recipe again.

I've made this fudge twice this week and Irish cream truffle. They are both pretty good. The first time I made it I paid attention to the reviews and got a candy thermometer and waited until soft ball stage( rec 238 ), which is WAY over the five minutes of boiling. It set up almost the minute the chips melted and I couldn't stir very well. Now granted it tasted good, but it looked weird, not at all glossy or "fudge" looking. Texture was strange. So today I decided to follow the directions word for word. GUESS WHAT?? Came out perfect!!!!! Soft, creamy amd wonderful!! I have been on a fudge kick since our local fair last week and wanted to find a recipe to compete. This is SO close to fair fudge!! Thanks for the wonderful recipe. And from now on I'll follow the recipe first before I make adjustments!!

Awesome, easy recipe.  This is the 2nd time I've made fudge (1st time was several years ago, the result being a horrible mucky mess that terrified me from attempting fudge again).  

After reading all the wonderful reviews for this recipe, I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did!  I was worried that I cooked the marshmallow/evaporated milk mixture for too long, but my end result was delicious.  The fudge set quickly and was a smooth and creamy treat after it cooled.

I used Fluff as it was all I had even though Kelly recommends using marshmallow cream instead and it was still delicious.  I made it plain (without nuts) and added a little extra vanilla. Use a 9x13 pan if you want your fudge chunks to not be as thick as they will be in a 9x9.

The handful of negative comments for this recipe complain the turn-out is too sweet or doesnt have a good taste. For sweetness, use 1c sugar instead of 1.5c if you dont have a sweet tooth (of course I don't understand why then you are making fudge!) and as for the flavor...fudge is made almost entirely of chocolate chips/bars.  

The better tasting chocolate you use, the better your fudge will taste (Hello, common sense!).  I taste-tested different brands of morsels before cooking with them.  It just doesn't make any sense to use Star Market morsels in your fudge (even though they're cheaper) if you think Star Market morsels taste like dog pooh!  Guess what your fudge is going to taste like!

Great recipe and easy to make. I used "baker's' sugar, which is very fine but not quite like powdered sugar. This sugar dissolves much faster which keeps the recipe from burning while trying to get the sugar to melt.

I've made this fudge every Christmas for the past four years. It gets rave reviews by all. The recipe will turn out perfect if you start the 5 minutes when you see small bubbles forming in the fudge, NOT when you see a full boil. Also if you microwave the marshmallow creme for 20 seconds you can get all of it out of the container.

This summer I visited San Francisco and bought fudge at Pier 39 that costs $14 a pound. This fudge is WAY better,I will never buy fudge again after making this recipe and unlike many other reviewers, I have made fudge several times in the past so I have a frame of reference. In regards to the sweetness of the fudge, it's all a matter of preference,I personally hate dark and semi-sweet chocolate and actually used two cups of chocolate-vanilla swirl chips and one cup of milk chocolate chips and subbed pecans because I hate walnuts in sweets. Everyone loved the fudge.

Very easy and most EXCELLENT.  Already have passed on the recipe to two friends who insisted after tasting it.  A couple of things:

1) Add marshmallow with chocolate chips.
2) Use less than medium heat to bring to boil.
3) Use 1 cup sugar (instead of 1 1/2).

This is exactly what I was looking for.  Simply outstanding.

Sorry to say, but I didn't have any luck with this recipe.  I followed it to the letter but it came out hard and dry.  I won't be making this one again.  UPDATE:  Ok I was wrong.  There is an important distinction between marshmallow fluff and marshmallow creme.  When I actually followed the recipe and used the marshmallow creme it came out beautifully.  So easy to make too.  Thanks!

awesome stuff, just make sure u got a large enough sauce pan, cuz this stuff really expands as it approaches the boiling point, then shirnks again.  Althought they were really good, they werre a little too rich for my tastes (i followed the advice of someone to replace the semi-sweet with double chocolate.  It also took more than 5 min to it, if u plan to make more candy in the future, invest in a candy thermometer, it really helps when you're making fudge and the such (stop at 240 like the other person said)

o and since the fudge seems to become firm really fast after u add the chips in, after refrigerating it, if u want them to turn out into a nice even fudge, put it in the oven (mine was set at 350) for a while and repress it.

Personally I will never make these again because it took alot of work, it's taste great, but way too much work was invested in it for me.

I had not had any success with candy or fudge in the past so I was a little nervous about this.  I read past reviews and compensated a little.  First of all, I made a double batch.  I softened and melted the butter a little first, then added the sugar and milk and salt.  I added the marshmallow last in order to avoid any graininess from undissolved sugar.  I used ghiradelli double chocolate chips and accidently added the wrong amount.  I added 3 cups of the Ghiradelli double choc and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips (this was a double batch).  But it came out great!  Perfect fudge!  Delicious!

This is the best fudge I've ever had--not too sweet, perfect texture, and so easy to make! I used peanut butter chips to make peanut butter fudge. Poured chocolate fudge over peanut butter fudge in cupcake wrappers, and--OH MY GOSH! Good stuff!!! Made some with pecans, too--very yummy ...

This was the first fudge recipe I had ever tried, and I messed up.  It turned out like taffy.  

But it was my fault.  I tried again and followed the directions to a "T" and OH MY GOD!!!  The best fudge I have ever had.  I have people asking for the recipe, but I don't want to give it out.  :)

All I can say is OMIGOD!  This is the best fudge I've ever had...and I'm an expert!  I had to make 3 batches in 2 days just to keep up the demand from friends, kids, and family.  You can't miss out with this one.  A+++++!

I'm sorry, but I followed the directions exactly and i've now had a tray of gummy chocolate in my fridge trying to harden for three days.  I spent $35.00 on ingradients to make this and all I got was mush.  I'm very disappointed.

WOW! Ok, I can't stop eating this fudge! I love the chocolatey flavor and the creamy texture. The only improvement I will make next time is adding even more chopped walnuts (personal preference). Yummy! Oh, and this is going to show up in my kitchen all year long, not just Christmas! No way I can wait a whole year for this fudge! Thanks for sharing, Kelly!

Very dry and crumbly 'fudge' was the end product. I don't think I did anything wrong....going back over the reviews I see now that many folks had the same result. Followed the recipe to a T, with fresh ingredients and quality chocolate.  I will be leaving this off my Christmas trays.

This is the first time I have ever made fudge and this recipe worked beautifully.  The fudge turned out FANTASTIC!  If you're a first time fudge maker, TRY THIS RECIPE!  I did use generic Marshmallow Fluff (if you live in Maryland and care to know, I used Weis supermarket brand) and I used Giant brand flour and it still turned out wonderful and NOT GREASY.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and let the mixture boil over five minutes (it was probably more like seven minutes).  I did have some of the mixture stick to the pot, but I think this was because I didn't stir it at the beginning- so stir, stir, stir!  Also, Attilaskitchen is right- measure ALL of the dry ingredients ahead of time, it makes it SO much easier and the chocolate melts right away so it's faster too.  Hope this helps!

What great fudge you can make with this recipe! This would be especially good for someone who doesn't have a candy thermometer, since many fudge recipes require one. I was able to whip this up in about 45 minutes. It took a while for the mixture to come to a boil. Whatever you do, do NOT put a lid on the mixture to speed up the boiling process. If you do, your mixture will probably burn and scald - making for a very "toasty" fudge. Also, be sure to stir the mixture even before you reach the steady boil to insure no burning will occur. I used a 7.5 oz. jar of marshmallow creme (Fluff brand), the recipe calls for 7 oz., but this was fine. The mixture of milk/semi-sweet chocolate chips really helps this fudge and gives it a nice taste. My fudge was set after about an hour and a half in the fridge, and was not too cool to eat right away. Thanks to the aluminum foil, I was able to remove the fudge for cutting and I still had a clean dish underneath - gotta love that! :D I cut the fudge into triangle pieces, but I have also used small cookie cutters in the past (use metal ones for a better cut). I didn't have any nuts, but I suggest using walnuts.  My only problem I had was that my fudge came out a bit bumpy/chalky on the top. I think that it needed a bit more butter to make it just a bit more smooth. Overall, this is a great recipe for both the beginning and experienced chefs alike. :-)

I just made a double batch for Christmas (I make ahead and freeze) and it is the best fudge I have ever made (I'm typing this while licking the cooking pot clean!).
I followed the directions exactly and brought to a boil and mixed while it slightly boiled for a full five minutes. Creamy and smooth.
Be sure to measure the vanilla, chocolate chips and nuts ahead of time. That way you can just pour them in - mix well. Just wait until my son finds it - this fudge might not make it to Christmas

Great recipe,I followed the directions very carefully.I also took the advice of someone else and had all my ingrediants measured out ahead of time. Make sure it's medium high heat if you have a gas stove,and boil it the full five minutes while stiring the whole time.Turned out nice and firm and I added pecans delicous!

This was the first time I made fudge and it turned out perfect, all 4 batches. I read several comments and took some notes before I made it. I followed Kelly's recipe exactly like she wrote it only I added the first list of ingredients to the stainless steel pot before I turned on the burner so nothing would burn. I stirred constantly and had the 2nd set of ingredients pre-measured so I wouldn't have to stop stirring for too long to measure ingredients and chance burning the marshmallow. I also kept the burner on medium low the entire time. It was great fudge and was very creamy and extremely easy. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful. I don't think I boiled it enough though because not all of the sugar melted. I was afraid I would scorch it. Next time I'll try to be a bit more brave in boiling it.

It's important to double boil this mixture otherwise you might burn it. Otherwise, lovely fudge, and very simple to make. Very tasty.

I made this yesterday almost exactly to recipe, the only change I made was using 1 cup milk choc. chip and 2 cups semi sweet chips. I also put it in a foil lined 11x7 baking dish to chill instead of the 8x8. And I added more nuts, about 3/4 cup. This was my first attempt at making fudge because I always thought it would be difficult. This stuff turned out awesome and was so easy to do. Now I'm in trouble because I'll want to make it more often. Thanks Kelly and Aunt Teen for a great recipe.

Yummy! This fudge is DIVINE!!! I must admit... I'm not  a fan of fudge. It has never floated my boat, I guess. But boy is this stuff good - creamy, chocolaty and sinfully rich (like a high-quality fudge should be)! It's funny how I stumbled upon this recipe. I have a hectic schedule during the week and most of my recent weekends have been busy as well. Still wanting to make Christmas goodies, I've been on the lookout for easy to prepare recipes like this. I must say, Aunt Teen's recipe didn't disappoint. :) I will definitely make this part of my regular holiday rotation - or even for an indulgent snack every now and then. And Kelly's directions were spot on. My only regret is that I didn't warm my jar of marshmallow fluff in the microwave first (this simple step would have made my life a LOT easier lol!). NOTE: Be sure to allow your ingredients to come to a full boil and THEN start timing (and constantly stirring) after that. This will ensure a smooth, creamy texture as opposed to a grainy one. The latter happens when your sugar doesn't completely dissolve. Thanks for sharing your Aunt's recipe, Kelly! It appers I'm not the only grateful reviewer on here. :-)

I make candy boxes for friends and family every year for christmas, this is the first year i decided to add fudge to them. I don't like how sickly sweet most fudge is, so i made a few alterations. I wanted a really rich chocolate flavor so I only added a cup of sugar and used 2c of dark chocolate chips and 1c semisweet chips and didn't add nuts (personal preference). Other than that i followed the directions exactly. It turned out to be creamy, smooth and oh so chocolatey! I cut them into 1 inch squares, dipped part of a pecan half in white chocolate and stuck it to the tops and then drizzled white chocolate over the tops and placed them in mini cupcake liners. The presentation was beautiful! I'll be adding these to my candy boxes every year!

I would have given this 5 stars, but, like most recipes for fudge, this one is tempermental as well, even if you follow it exactly.  I've made it twice, once it turned out hard and dry, the second time, it was smooth and creamy. It's hard to say what the difference was between the two batches, but I suspect cooking time is the real key.  Knowing when to start your 5 minutes I think is the real issue - when my best batch turned out, I started timing not at a full rolling boil (which would have scorched my pan) but when there was a good number of bubbles visible.  Following other suggestions, I cooked it for about 6 1/2 minutes, not 5, and it turned out perfect.  Note - I used a candy thermometer on both batches and neither one reached the 'soft ball' stage on the thermometer. The temperature of the pan is difficult to guage too, I was working on a gas range with a setting of only about 1 1/2 on the dial and it was almost too hot.  Fudge is a tricky process, even for an 'easy' recipe, so just keep trying if it doesn't turn out, and keep a note of what you did before so you can make a little change or two next time.  Remember the final flavor of this recipe depends heavily on the brand of chocolate you use - buy the best you can afford for the best taste.

I omitted the semi-sweet chocolate chips and added 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter to make peanut butter fudge.  It tasted exactly like a peanut butter cup.  This fudge is very creamy, extremely rich and surprisingly easy to make!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Thank you Aunt Teen!  This is a fabulous fudge recipe.  I would not change a thing.  Very simple to make.  This will be "my fudge recipe" from here forward.  My family loved it too!

I made a ton of this to give away as Christmas gifts, and I was a little nervous because it was my first time making fudge, so I read up a little bit on how to get fudge to turn out just right...and my fudge came out PERFECTLY!  This is such a great recipe, and I suggest finding the fudge-making tips on this site.

I tried to make this in hopes that I could use it for Christmas.  I followed the recipe, but the fudge was hard as a rock.  I wonder if it had anything to do with the weather or humidity.

Very smart to cook it in a metal bowl over a boiling pan of water. It's like a mini-double boiler set up and makes for an easy clean up!

This tastes really awesome.  However you must let it sit for a day or two to get the really creamy taste.  I found it tasted better this way and so did everyone else.  This is a keeper.  Thankyou for this recipe.

This recipe works even better if the marshmallow creme is added after the sugar and evap. milk are cooked.......add at the same time as the choc. chips.

Great recipe!  I brought it into the hospital for the nurses where I work.  One of them called me and asked to fax the recipe right over!  I agree that it was a little oily at first, but I left the pan in the refrigerator for 2 days before cutting and the oil evaporated.  I will definitely make again.

Really good! I haven't made fudge in years because it can be so difficult, especially here in Mississippi where the humidity can really mess up your batch. I did wait until a relatively dry day, and it turned out great. I really like the combination of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips.

I had never made fudge before and this was a simple and delicious recipe.  I cut the butter in half, only using 2 tbsp per some reviews saying the fudge was greasy.  I cooked for 6.5 minutes per some reviews and I also added the marshmallow cream with the chocolate chips off the heat.  Everything worked well and turned out fantastic!

Yum! The only downside for me is that it becomes a gooey mess if it doesn't stay chilled. I wish the texture was more firm. Next time I might try cooking it 6.5 minutes instead of 5 like others have suggested.

The flavor was good, but it looked a little dried out.  If followed recipe and as others noted, it hardened quickly in the bowl after removing from stove.

Very yummy fudge! You have to make sure you keep stirring or the sugar will caramelize on the bottom of the pan (I made that mistake), but even with the mistake, the fudge was incredible! I can't wait to make it again!

As reviewer Gingerachele (that may be spelled wrong), I followed the recipe but let it boil a minute longer as others recommended.  The minute I added the chocolate chips it turned very thick and heavy but still manageable.  I put in the fridge for an hour and when I took it out, the fudge was extremely dry and crumbly.  One thing I noticed is that it was already burning on the bottom even before it started boiling at medium so the whole time it was boiling I could see brown 'strings' of caramelized marshmallow and sugar.  I won't be trying it again...

This fudge was pretty good! The texture was great. Take the advice of others and have the chips measured out ahead of time. You want to mix them in as soon as the pan is removed from the heat. I used a whisk the whole time, as well as a nonstick pan, which I really recommend. I don't like my sweets to be overly sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4, and I'm glad I did! It was plenty sweet with just that. Also, for fudge, I think this recipe came out a little too "milk chocolatey". Next time I'll reduced the milk chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups, and increase the semi-sweet chips to 1 1/2. Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe here and read the reviews people put on. Some of them told me to use less butter and to cook it longer. I tried what the reviews told me to do and it turned out horrible. After that, I looked into my mom's ancient "Toll House Heritage Cookbook", found a recipe called "Creamy Chocolate Fudge", and decided to try it out. It worked out perfectly! The fudge was creamy but not too soft and chocolatey without being too overloading. Today I went here to compare the recipies on and add my recipe. When I compared it, it was exactly the same. This is easily the BEST fudge I have ever tasted/made. Two thumbs up. :D

This recipe can't be ruined!  I used a jar of marshmallow creme that was 3 years old and separating.  I left out the salt.  I used some Swiss chocolate that had red peppers in it, some dark and white chocolate swirl chocolate chips (both of which I didn't like) and some dark chocolate that was turning white.  Quite a list of left overs.  The fudge turned out wonderful!  First time I ever made really good fudge.

WOW! This fudge is AMAZING! It is so creamy and smooth, and not overly rich either. I followed the recipe exactly, but I took other reviewers' advice about the cook time. After I started timing I stirred constantly for 6 and a half minutes. The mixture looked a bit like gravy. Be sure to have the chocolate chips, nuts, and vanilla measured and ready to go because once you get to that step, you need to work fast. For the nuts, I chose to use walnuts, which were excellent. I was kinda concerned after I combined all the ingredients and was about to put in the pan to cool because it wasn't "pourable". It was like a big chocolatey marshmallow glob, but it was fine. Just smooth it into the pan with your spoon. Thank you so much for this fantistic recipe. This was my first time making fudge and this will be my go-to recipe for years to come. :)

I found this recipe a few years back and have made it every Christmas with killer reviews!! I made it for neighbor treats this year and they love it! The BEST (and easiest!) fudge recipe I've found, I adore it! I've never had it turn out bad, perfect every time! It is pleasantly creamy, melts in your mouth and has no graininess that other fudge recipes tend to have. It is a tad on the over-sweet side, but you can fix that easily by altering the ratio of milk chocolate chips and semi sweet chips...I add 1 & 1/2 cups of each and the sweet factor is perfect! I know the first time I made this recipe, I was a little worried about not needing a candy thermometer to make for sure it was properly cooked. Just make sure you continually stir while the sugar and milk mixture is on the stove...Don't start timing until it begins to boil slightly (you won't get a raging boil with this...just start timing after the first sign of bubbles). Stir constantly and let it cook around 6 minutes to ensure the sugar is completely dissolved and you're good!

I have never been so pleased with a fudge recipe as I have with this one.  No brainer.  Follow the directions and you will NEVER have another gritty piece of fudge.  Yes, it is rich but soo good.  I make it for Christmas and Valentine's.

Thank you Kelly for a good recipe.  I think the mixed reviews come from what one expects their fudge to be like.  We have two other fudge makers in our family.  My Moms is very sweet/milky/firm and my sisters is light in texture almost fluffy with a mild chocolate flavor.  Everyone likes it different.  I've made this one for 3 years now after trying several recipes and I'm hooked.  This is a dark, rich, firm but creamy texture, not-to-sweet fudge. I have similiar mods as others (1/4 less sugar, chip ratio) but will also try adjusting to make it a bit softer with more moisture in it. It sometimes can be a bit firm for my liking but I suspect it is my cooking variation. My experience with it is don't overcook it-even a minute-and work very fast as soon as the chips go in.  This is a wonderful recipe-hope this helps. Good luck.

Really good  fudge, however I add my marshmallow fluff AFTER I boil the butter, sugar and evap milk for 4-5 mins. I took a cookie/candy platter to work for sharing with co workers and everyone asked for the recipe and some begged me to make more :)

This Fudge recipe provided me with a great holiday gift for my parents who don't need any more material things.

I did not use the aluminum foil the second time making this, because I discovered it stuck to the bottom of the fudge! Buttering the pan works better for me.

I cant rate this recipe on taste as I have tried it twice and both times it sized up on me. I added the chocolate chips and the first time it immediately went crumbly and would not stir too a smooth consistancy.  The second time I tried melting the chocolate to see if that would help, but got the same results.  With all the great reviews it is dissapointing to not be able to make it, i am sure it is something I am doing and would love to have suggestions.  I am actually a very good baker and can follow a recipe with not problems, this is frustrating to me, so any help would be appreciated.

my first review - i thought this fudge tasted fabulous (i did 1 1/2 cups milk and semi-sweet chocolate rather than 2 cups sweet). my only complaint is that it gets terribly soft at room temperature. any ideas on what to change? we've been eating it out of the fridge (which is divine), but would love to have it at room temperature.

great recipe, thanks!

Excellent fudge. I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13-inch pan (foil sprayed with a non-stick coating, of course). I had some SKOR candy pieces on hand, so while the fudge was hot, I pressed a thick layer onto the top of 50% of the fudge--received rave reviews from my testers, although they liked the plain too. The fudge is so dark, it is hard to believe that the chocolate added is mostly milk--next time I will increase the amount of milk & decrease the amount of semi-sweet. Also, I might add a bit of butter extract next time to give it a more buttery flavor.

The fudge was very delicious indeed.  When I first removed it from the pan it was very soft and pulled apart with the foil.  I then sprinkled the fudge with confectioners sugar and used wax paper to mold it.  I then pressed the leftover walnuts onto the top, covered the whole thing with aluminum foil and froze it.  Frozen, the fudge held its shape and remained the consistency I was familiar with -- and was delicious.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

All 4 batches of this recipe turned out great. I never made fudge before but was surprised at how fast and easy it was and delicious. I agree with others that you need to keep it refrigerated. I had everything pre-measured so it was ready to add and I didn't have to stop stirring for very long and chance it burning. I cooked it on medium low the entire time and used a steel pot and it turned out perfect. Thank you for sharing your recipe, it was wonderful!

After cutting the fudge in squares, wrap them in multi-colored cellophane wrappers and give them away as gifts. Your friends will be very happy. Just make sure you make lots and lots of this fudge so you'll have enough for yourself.

The only drawback? Extremely difficult to stop eating it.

We give this one a five because it tasted great. But, maybe ours deserves a four because apparently, Joe screwed up the easiest recipe ever.  Our fudge liquified on contact with room temperature air. But after intense refridgeration, it was absolutely YUMMY!

I have always held off on making fudge because I thought it was too labor intensive.  I tried this after reading the reviews, and it's absolutely wonderful.  I have made it for gifts, bake sales, and just because my kids are craving it.  It's definately a "keeper!"

My daughter and I made this today, and it was wonderful!  It's one of the easiest fudge recipes I've ever used.  I doubled it (used 13 oz. marshmallow cream) and let it boil about an extra 1-2 minutes (due to doubling).  I believe the doubling made it take a good while to get the chips all melted, but it was delicious, easy, and fast!  I will definitely use it again and again.  Oh, and I only did nuts in 1/2 of it.  Mine was not in the fridge anywhere close to 2 hours before it was firm; might have been due to all the extra stirring while trying to melt the chips!!

Simply amazing fudge. Easy to adapt to your taste, like I prefer dark chocolate so the first time I made it I used 2 cups of dark chocolate chips and 1 cup semi sweet, it came out really good. The second time I wanted to add some peanut butter, I searched the internet for a chocolate peanut butter fudge, everywhere I saw the recipe called for cocoa powder and I knew it wouldn't be chocolaty enough, for me at least, so I wanted to adjust this recipe and see. so this is what I did, 1 cup evaporated milk, 2 cups granulated white sugar and 1 tbsp. butter, on medium low heat brought to a rolling boil stirring often. once it got to a vigorous boil, started the 5 min timer, (used a 10 oz bag of large marshmallows, nuked with about 1/4 cup light caro syrup on 50% power for 1 min.) turned the heat off at the end of 5 min,(there were lot of bubbles still) whisked in the marshmallows, 1 tsp vanilla and then added the 1 1/4 cup peanut butter already measured out and whisked until smooth, then poured in 1 and 1/2 cups dark chocolate chunks, 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped pecans and mixed well, poured into a foil lined 9 inch square pan( which the fudge filled completely) and chilled in the refrigerator before cutting up. It was creamy deliciousness thoroughly enjoyed by me and my company. It didn't have that finely crystalized texture of a typical fudge but if you are into the creaminess and that sinful combination of chocolate and peanut butter, you'll be in heaven.

I have been using this recipe every holiday season for the last 4 years.  It's perfect as written, even  at high elevation (6550 feet).  My neighbor starts bugging me in mid-November, reminding me that he LOVES this fudge and needs it to complete his Christmas!

I made this recipe for Christmas '12 as a first time fudge maker and it turned out great.  I had my mix at a full rolling boil for at LEAST 7-8 minutes, constantly stirring.  The mix turned difficult after I dumped in the chocolate chips, so I just added a little more evap. milk.  It came out like a dream!  Not gritty,greasy or crumbly.  Totally smooth and I didn't even use a candy thermometer.  I just used my plain stainless steel pot and an 8x8 glass dish for chilling. Definitely trying again with peanut butter next time!

I don't know what might have gone wrong with this recipe.  I made it EXACTLY as stated, waiting until full boil, stirring constantly after that for 5 minutes, etc. and it still came out dry when I went to put it into the pan.  I wasn't even able to add the nuts because I couldn't stir it after I added the chips because it was so stiff.  Will attempt to make it one more time and see if it turns out.

WHATTTTTT???!!!!! Very YUMMY fudge recipe!  I had to change it because I only had certain ingredients on hand.  I used half a container of marshmallow creme, and all semi-sweet chocolate chips.  After I stired in the chips and vanilla I added crushed Heath candy bar.  WOW!!! very good.  Was smooth and delicious, mine did not come out greasy as others had.  Im not sure what would have caused this, maybe an overgreased pan?  Very good recipe, will keep and make again with different mix ins.

I have made candy of many kinds for years, and I have never had a recipe fail on me like this one. Determined to defeat it, I tried a few times, thinking I must have messed up a step. No matter how careful I was, this fudge always turned into a greasy mess. I've read some reviews that said to put the marshmallow cream in after heating, which is in line with other recipes I have succeeded with. Also, I wonder how many failures are happening at altitude? I had to relearn how to make candy when living over 5000ft.

I am not a candy maker, or at least thought I was not, because my previous attempts at fudge were unsuccessful to put it mildly.  I can do cookies, cakes, pies, breads, muffins ... but just thought I would have to leave the candy making to someone else.  That was BEFORE I tried this recipe this morning.  Oh My Goodness is all I can say.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it is perfect.  I used a very heavy pan to reduce the chance of scorching, used a rubber spatula spoon to stir, and heated up the ingredients very slowly on low heat to start with until it was smooth and then turned the heat up to wait for the boil.  Stir constantly, have everything ready, and you will not be disappointed.  I am going to make another batch this evening using peanut butter chips.  Thank you for a wonderful fudge recipe and showing me that I can make candy, I just needed the right recipe!

This recipe is great! This was the first time I've ever made fudge so I was nervous about messing up, but it turned out great. If your a newbie like me I only suggest you take her seriously when she says 'large' saucepan. I used a medium sized one not expecting the marshmallow to expand so much, leaving me with a sticky mess to clean up. Still tasted great though.

I make a very similar fudge that gets raves every year.  However, I use 1 1/3 cup white sugar, a pinch of salt, and 1/4 cup baileys irish creme or kahlua, and up the nuts to a full cup.  Make sure to boil for 5 minutes at a full boil and it comes out delish every time.  I also use raspberry liqueur instead of baileys, omit the nuts, and switch to 2 cups semisweet chips and 1 cup milk chocolate.

I followed the recipe for this EXACTLY and my fudge turned out horribly. It got hard and crumbly and grease seeped up out of it. I tried to sop it up with a paper towel, but after I put it in the fridge more seeped up and congealed.  I had thought with 1371 reviews and 4.5 stars I would be fine, but the problem is mine: I should have read more of the bad reviews to dodge potential issues. I think the major problem was that I added the chocolate chips all at once, and tried to stir by hand instead of using my stand mixer.   Those of you who made this and made it work, I salute you. After this recipe bombed, I had enough marshmallow creme to try again with the recipe on the side of the jar, and it turned out perfectly.   Sorry, Aunt Teen. I think your fudge recipe just isn't for me.

Its a good start, but if anyone tries to make this as directed exactly its going to turn out like a solid crumbly brick every time.   Someone should really alter this recipe, theres hundreds of reviews on here about this issue.   Things that can correct this issue are simply less chocolate chips ( 2 cups instead of 3 ), or perhaps less sugar then directed.   If you dump 3 cups of chips into this directed mixture it will be hard in about 10 seconds.  I broke my wooden spoon trying to stir it the first time.  Cook time/temp does not alter this.

After making another fudge flavor on this site, I learned to not use white sugar, but to use confectioners instead. It came out perfect and smooth. I'm giving these to the teachers and for the daycare as gifts.

Too sweet.  I think this would be better with all semi-sweet chocolate chips. It was creamy, I'll give it that.  I've been making fudge like this for years and have found that you don't want to overcook it.  When "boiling" it, I turn the burner down to med-low and only boil for about 3 minutes.   That's just what I've found works for me.  I made a mint version, adding 1/2 tsp. pepperment extract and sprinkling mint chips on top.  I think I'll stick to my usual "fantasy fudge" recipe though.

This turned out fantastic - so creamy and delicious! I had never made fudge before and was a bit nervous, but after following suggestions from other reviewers (stirred for 6 1/2 minutes from full boil) pre-measuring the ingredients helps too - you need to be ready to dump the chocolate in as soon as it is time and stir like crazy then pour :) I added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract when I added the choc chips and also dusted the top of the finished fudge with crushed peppermint. Yum! It turned out so delicious!!! I made it to give away but am going to have a hard time not eating it all!

If you don't have marshmallow creme, don't despair. I found that it was just too darn expensive, so I bought mini marshmallows. I combined the sugar, , milk, butter, and salt and brought it to a full rolling boil, and boiled it the full five minutes. I turned the heat down and added 7 oz. of marshmallows, stirred until they melted, and added the chocolate chips and vanilla (DH doesn't like nuts) and beat it very well. It turned out very smooth and creamy and delicious- and cheaper than with the marshmallow creme!

Second time I've made this and both times someone has told me it is the best fudge they have ever eaten. Make sure and follow the directions"full boil for five minutes" or it won't set up right and  "stir constantly" or it will stick and burn.

I'm sure the fudge will taste ok if only the directions were given in full. When I followed this recipe to a T the first time the mixture turned grainy and hard when I added the chocolate.  After researching on what should be done I've learned the following:   1st: bring the sugar mixture to a boil over medium heat and let it reach a temp of 234.  Use a thermometer.  2nd: Mix the marshmellow creme in after the sugar mixture is taken off the heat.  3rd: Cool the sugar mixture for at least 15 min until it's no more than 110* before adding the chocolate.  Mix vigerously untill the fudge looses it's gloss, then pour into prepared pan.

This was my first time making fudge, and it turned out absolutely amazing. I read the reviews by other people, which were very helpful. I boiled it for 6:30 and 234 degrees, using a candy thermometer. As soon as I got it boiling, I turned it down a little bit to make sure that the marshmallows did not stick. Success! I was delightfully suprised. They say "don't trust a skinny cook", but this one won't be staying skinny for long if she keeps this up...

I've tried a lot of fudge recipes and this was by far the creamiest and best tasting! I also made peanut butter fudge by replacing the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips. You can make rocky road by adding nuts and mini marshmallows in at the end. I also did butterscotch (it ended up being the favorite)by replacing the choc. with butterscotch chips. I will be making this every year for the holidays!!

The creamiest, most delicious fudge.  Made this as one of my Christmas goodies, and am so pleased with the results.  I did make changes because there was soooo much sugar-- in the marshmallow, in the chocolate chips, plus an entire cup of white sugar.  First, you can skip the milk chocolate chips for convenience-- it turns out great with all semi-sweet.  Next, decrease sugar to 1/2 cup.  Last, I used 2 1/2 cups semi sweet chips, and one square of unsweetened chocolate to keep the chocolate flavor strong without it being too sweet.  Delicious!! Mine came out dark and creamy.  Heaven!

This makes surprisingly wonderful fudge.  I use the store grand generic chocolate chips, but you can't tell.  Just make sure that you bring the liquid to a FULL BOIL before you start the five minutes.  Otherwise, the fudge won't set correctly.

Five stars! I'm not exactly an experienced baker, but even I got this perfectly! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used ALL semi-sweet chips. (I accidentally bought all semi-sweets, but with all the sugar, it completely balanced out the taste. Sweet but not overdone sweet!) I also simmered all ingredients on low till they nicely melted, then raised just to medium to boil for 5 minutes only. I didn't have a candy thermometer, but I don't find you need one. I could tell it would have been too thick if it boiled any longer.

 Tip: I agree, nuke the marshmellow until it's almost melty, around 20 seconds, it pours out much nicer and less sticky! Stir constantly and pre-measure your chips and nuts, it's easier because it thickens FAST once you add in the chips. At that point you need some elbow grease, but it comes out a nice texture in a couple minutes, add your nuts and vanilla, stir, and it pours cleanly out of the pot! One swipe with a damp paper towel around the pot, and the pot is clean, you're ready for batch two: no messy cleaning in between! Easy!

I was amazed by how nice and easy this recipe was, even for beginners like me who never made fudge before! Thanks Aunt Teen, my family loves it!

**GET A CANDY THERMOMETER**I made fudge yesterday without a candy thermometer - ruined...flaky and gritty.  Picked one up today and made another batch - smooth and creamy.  Ingredients are too expensive to screw up an entire batch.  I think the candy thermometer was less than $3.  Just a note:  It was about 6 1/2 min. into a rolling boil until my fudge reached 235.

This was good, but it could be better. First of all, way too much butter and sugar, all you need is 2 tbsp of butter and 1 1/4c. sugar. Also, I would suggest taking the advice of another reviewer and using 2c. semi-sweet chips and 1c. milk chocolate. Lastly, boil for six minutes instead of 5.

Not only is this fudge delicious, it is one of the easiest holiday recipes I've made this year!!  I made two batches - one with walnuts and one with a cup of chopped dried cherries instead of the nuts.  Both taste great!  

To help make everything come together stress free, I used a double boiler (in my case a metal bowl over a pan of boiling water) to melt and heat the ingredients.  I let the evaporated milk, butter, sugar and salt melt together before adding the marshmallow, then let the marshmallow combine with the milk mixture and heat for 5 minutes before adding the chocolate.  I let the chocolate melt as I mixed it in while the double boiler was still on heat.

This one is a keeper - there is nothing better than a recipe that makes it seem like you slaved over the stove for hours and have some remarkable confectionery skills.

Ok....I read all the reviews and suggestions and followed them ALL to the 'T'.  What I ended up with was a huge oily MESS in my pan!  So what gives?  Is it my pan?  Is it my chocolate?  I really want to make fudge this Christmas, so if anyone can give me some advice, I would certainly appreciate it!

Sorry, Aunt Teen, but this turned out to be  one pan of pretty expensive crumbs.  I read several of the reviews and even bought a candy thermometer.  I heated the mixture nice and slow until it was just at soft ball stage and followed the recipe from there.  The minute I stirred in my chips, I knew something was amiss.   It got too hard, too fast.
Now, I am a skilled baker, but this was my first (hopefully not my last) attempt at fudge.  I really thought it was pretty foolproof, especially with the thermometer.  I would rather have undercooked the fudge, but you simply can't tell until it's too late.  The only thing I can think of that went wrong was that I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips.  Oh well, time to buy some ice cream and put these crumbs on top!  I will not be attempting this again.  My next try at fudge will be with a traditional recipe.  Good luck to everyone!

This is the best fudge recipe!  It's better than many others that are much more complicated!  My few changes: I add the marshmallow creme after mixture boils. I also use equal portions of the chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups each semisweet & milk chocolate).  I think this gives it a better chocolate taste without being too sweet.  Also, you MUST use a heavy saucepan for this.  And be prepared to move quickly when adding remaining ingredients to the boiled sugar mixture.  Otherwise, it will start to set and won't have a smooth texture.    **I always make 2 batches - one with nuts and one without.  Instead of using chopped nuts, I will put one pecan half on the top of each piece so that it is easy to differentiate between the two.  (Add the halves just after pouring into pan, pressing the pecan gently into the fudge and spacing about 1 inch apart.)  I am careful to make the batch without nuts first to avoid any cross contamination for those who are nut allergic.

TRY THESE FUDGE FILLED COOKIES!!!! You gotta try this recipe: Make the Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies (find on this website) as directed but don't bake it just yet! Make Aunt Teen's fudge as directed but don't let it harden all the way in the fridge. Now you are ready to assemble...Put a little bit of the cookie dough on the sheet and then put a little spoonful of the fudge on top of that and cover it with some more of the cookie dough. Make sure you close up the sides so you can't even tell that there is fudge in the middle. Bake as directed. These cookies are AWESOME. They have a fudgey suprise in the center that no one is expecting!!!! I made this one up myself :) you gotta try it!!!

This fudge was easy to make and very creamy.  I followed someone else's suggestion and used 1 C. semi-sweet chips, 1 C. milk chocolate chips and 1 C. dark chocolate chips.  It tasted great.  Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe.  For those that have the mixture bind up in the pan, or the chips cook instead of melt, it could be the pan.  I went through 9 batches of ruined fudge last year before I realized that my stainless steel pan retains too much heat, and even though you remove it from the burner, the temp stays consistent for too long.  I tried once more in a non stick pan, and it was like magic.  Also, try 1/4 of buttershots or kahlua.  Yummy!!

Okay, conclusions I have reached after making the fudge twice [without vanilla, nuts, or a candy thermometer]:
(1) The types/amounts of chocolate and sugar are all a matter of preference. I thought the original recipe (with 1 cup milk and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate) was fine. My friends, however, thought that it was too sweet and couldn't even finish one piece.
(2) When I followed the advice of some reviews and reduced [halved] the amount of butter used, the fudge became dry and hard. When I used the suggested amount of butter the fudge was much more pliable and soft. I think I also detected a slight buttery taste, however. What appears to be grease seems to unfailingly appear on the surface of the chocolate but I wouldn't recommend blotting it. That seems to dry out the fudge.
(3) Like some other reviewers, I found that the fudge became somewhat crumbly and grainy after mixing in the chocolate. I guess it sets extremely quickly, although I'm not sure why. I just ignored this and pressed it into a pan lined with foil. After an hour or two in the fridge, it looks fine and tastes delicious :) [Despite, again, the original crumbly and greasy texture]

I picked this fudge recipe out of all others due to it's popularity and rave reviews.  I followed the instructions to the tee...and it was very simple to make.  I hate to say this, but I was disappointed.  I was hoping it would have a more creamier texture and lighter taste.  It was very, very rich and chocolately and one small piece is plenty.  It tasted like a handful of chocolate chips and I was hoping for something a little more..."less-homemade-tasting", if that makes any sense.  The family did like this, but it never got finished.  Thanks for the recipe though! :)

This fudge was perfect! I poured it into an 8x8 aluminum foil pan, and immediately afterwards, I inserted two cardboard pieces to divide the fudge into three equal parts. Before chilling I pressed nuts into one column, in another I pressed in miniature marshmallows, and in the third I added oreo pieces.

This fudge recipe has consistently turned out perfectly! I DO use a candy thermometer that is properly calibrated. Also, use a HEAVY sauce pan! If using electric heat, I would not advise using a setting above MEDIUM, if that! The milk/sugar/marshmallow creme can easily scorch. If you find this recipe too sweet for your particular tastes, try switching the chocolate chip measurements to 2 c. semi-sweet and 1 c. milk chocolate.

This is truly a great fudge!  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it was too sweet for my taste, although my family liked it.  The second time I made the fudge, I modified the recipe to use 2 1/4 c of semisweet chips and 3/4 c of milk chocolate chips and cut the sugar to 1 1/4 c.  It turned out fantastic!!  Thanks Aunt Teen :)

I was disappointed in this recipe.  After following the directions exactly, I was left with a pretty dry fudge (not really creamy).  I wasn't going to try this recipe at first due to the marshmallow creme (I don't like using it....) but the large number of good reviews convinced me to try it.  Right after putting (it didn't "pour") it into the pan, there was some puddles of grease on top.  I've had better luck with simpler recipes I've found on this site (my fave being Chocolate Walnut Fudge).

I can honestly say that this is,THE BEST Fudge,that I have ever had!! I have tried alot of fudge recipes in my life,but alot of fudge that I have tried is either bland,or really dry tasting.Aunt Teen's Creamy Chocolate Fudge is so quick and easy to make. I have also used a 13x9 inch pan when making this,and it has ALWAYS turned out so good!! Thank You for sharing this recipe,it is so good and people have told me that this is the best fudge,that they have ever had!

I had to give 5 stars, since I submitted the recipe!  Wanted to thank everyone who tried it and liked it, and even those who didn't.
Quick note, make sure to use marshmallow creme, not Fluff.  The marshmallow creme I use is in a small plastic container w/ a red lid.
I have also switched the recipe out, and replaced the semi-sweet chips w/ peanut butter chips, and left the milk chocolate chips, it was really good.
I still make this every year for Christmas, and just came on line to reprint the recipe, since today is fudge-day.  Enjoy & happy holidays!

What a great fudge recipe.  I've been looking for something like this for some time now.  There's no danger of it becoming a soupy mess, and no danger of it being grainy and undissolved tasting.  Everyone I've served it to has raved about it, and I even forgot to put in the vanilla!  The only other modification I made was to only use 1 cup of sugar as opposed to the full amount because I didn't want it to be cloyingly sweet. Yum, yum!

I'm usually terrible at making fudge..but this was PERFECT!! You don't have to be an expert chef to make it. My husband and everyone loved it...This recipe is a keeper. I made another batch and substituted a whole bag of peanut butter chips for the semi-sweet morsels..and people loved it. Just a good peanuty taste. Enjoy!!

This got lots of positive comments at Christmas time get togethers.  I like a darker chocolate fudge, so I used bittersweet (not unsweetened) chocolate, and Baker's German Sweet Chocolate.  Also, if you lightly toast the nuts (pecans in my case) before adding to the mix,it gives them a richer nuttier flavor.

At 41 and a single mother I decided to "make" my Christmas gifts this year. I'm not particularly a cook and I certainly had never made fudge before but the reviews were so good I thought I'd try it… THEY TURNED OUT GREAT!!! I made 6 batches and all are just beautiful and I am proud to give them as gifts. I made one for myself and that made it all the harder to give them away, I wanted to eat all of them. I did try the Kahula idea, maybe I should have replaced it for something else but it made it a little thin. Thank you Aunt Teen and thank you members for helping me learn to cook!

Awesome fudge! I have given it to a lot of people and they all love it. You can also change the recipe around too. I made a rocky road batch and added 2 cups mini marshmallows and one cup nuts and I have made a version where I put half of the chips as butterscotch chips. All ways are great!

Simply the best!  I made some for my husbands company picnic.  A few others made some fudge too. At the end of the day they were taking home leftover fudge but Aunt Teen's fudge was gone. Thanks Kelly and Aunt Teen.

The taste of the fudge is wonderful.  The only thing that I don't like is that you almost have to keep it cold or it melts in your hands quickly.

This fudge was really hard to make, and it was crunchy not smooth like good fudge.  It was also too sweet.

Just made this recipe :) Twice! This is how I did it......bought a pk of 4 baby loaf pans (foil ones to use as gifts). I made one batch of fudge and used 1 pkg of milk choc chips. Poured equally into each of 4 foil baby loaf pans. Then made another batch and used 1 pkg of peanut butter chips. Poured equally on top of the choc fudge. Now I have 4 gifts of chocolate peanut butter layed fudge! :) Thanks for a great recipe! :) -Sharon

I made my own marshmallow creme, using 40 large marshmallows (or 4 cups small marshmallows) and 4 tsp of corn syrup. I use a double broiler and mix until melted. Then I used this recipe as listed. I let the mixture stay at a rolling boil for about 6 full minutes, I also used 3 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips instead. It balanced out the sugar much better. Thanks for this recipe,  it was a great guide!

I used granulated sugar, and the fudge didn't set, had a bit of a wet sand texture in some areas of the fudge, and a bit too sugary like I was eating pure sugar.

Granted, this is my first time making fudge, so I am sure there is a lot that could go wrong. Any tips?

Loved this recipe!! The fudge comes out perfect and very creamy. I have to leave it in the fridge or else it gets too soft, but other than that, it is the most consummate fudge I've eaten so far!

Perfect recipe!  I tried this recipe a few different times, in a few different ways, and it works best to cook it for 5 minutes just like the recipe says.  You do have to get it to a full boil first and keep it on medium heat, stirring constantly.  For my first batch, I took it to the soft ball stage on a low temp like suggested by reviewers, but it yielded drier fudge.  I was also worried about stirring during the 5 minutes because many fudge recipes say to lower heat and stop stirring while the fudge is simmering to prevent sugar crystals forming too large.  Other recipes also require you to let the fudge cool to a certain temp before you stir due to sugar crystals.  After much research and trial and error, I learned that the marshmallow crème prevents the sugar crystals from forming too large and so you don't have to go to all the trouble you would in a different fudge recipe to keep it from getting grainy. One thing I did that made the job much easier, was to put my chocolate chips in my stand mixer.  Immediately after the ingredients on the stove are done, add them to the stand mixer with the chocolate chips.  Then mix until the fudge is smooth, creamy, and has a dull appearance (not shiny), about 5-7 minutes.  Then add the nuts and vanilla (I omit the nuts, just a personal preference) and stir until incorporated.  Using the stand mixer was a life saver!

Got 2nd place at a company bake sale with this recipe! The only thing I changed was replacing the milk chocolate with more semi sweet chocolate since I don't like milk chocolate, and it still turned out great!

This is the first fudge recipe that has turned out well for me.  I followed the directions exactly and it is delicious.  I measured everything ahead of time to make it easier during the cooking/stirring process.  This is my new favorite fudge recipe!

This is my go to chocolate fudge recipe.  It always gets rave reviews wherever I take it. The ONLY change I make is I don't stir the nuts into the actual fudge itself.  After I pour the fudge into the prepared pan, I press shelled pecan halves in rows over the top. When it sets, I cut the fudge so each piece has a pecan half decorating the top.  Makes the presentation much nicer, and if there are non-nutlovers eating the fudge, it is easy to just take the pecan half off the top. :)

I was very disappointed in this fudge. I picked it because of the ratings and because my candy thermometer was broken. I don't know how it got good ratings. The one star is because it tasted like chocolate. As other reviewers commented, the mixture turns so thick in a matter of seconds after the choc chips are added that you can't even stir in the vanilla. It is not because I over cooked it. I set the timer for 5 min from the start of boiling. Followed directions exactly. I stuck it in the fridge overnight and it was a chocolate brick in the morning. I had to stick it in the microwave to soften it enough to cut it. It was breaking apart. I have made fudge before and this never happened. I will buy a new candy thermometer and stick to my other recipe. I will never make this again.

USE HALF THE BUTTER, 2 TBSP ONLY!!  Ok, so I've made this recipe a few times now. Once it didn't turn out, the other times it turned out fantastic!! The key is to only use 2 tbsp of butter, not 4 tbsp as stated in recipe. That's it! I tried making it the first time exactly as the recipe stated, that's when it didn't turn out right. The other times I halved the recipe's butter and its been PERFECT ever since. My family are fudge lovers and this is my go to recipe now as we ALL love it!! Best of the bunch, as long as you half the butter or you'll get greasy fudge that bleeds liquid butter through the top.

read a lot of the reviews -and followed regular instructions except I used 1 1/4 c sugar, 2 tbs butter, 2 cups semi sweet, and 1 cup milk chocholate, cooked in heavy stainless steel pot, and after the mixture came to a rolling boil, cooked it for 6-7 minutes.  Best fudge I ever made.
I just want to thank the other reviewers for helping make this a successful 5 star dish.

I read many of the reviews and some folks were concerned about the fudge being over sweet. My grandmother made fantastic fudge but she always used unsweeten chocolate in her recipe. 
Hers did not include the marshmallow creme which is very sweet plus the addition of 1-1/2 cups of sugar. My suggestion would be to use unsweetened chocolate or at least the majority. She also never used milk chocolate..........just her preference.
I haven't made this yet but it sounds fantastic. I am a professionally trained pastry chef so this is just my suggestion for over coming the sweet issue however, I don't recommend reducing the sugar or any other ingredient as it will change more than just the flavor. Culinary is one thing and changing ingredients is ok however, it doesn't work that way in the pastry side. Ingredients are based on weight and changing any ingredient will alter the recipe and could end in failure if you're not professionally trained in the formulations required.

THIS RECIPE WAS ORIGINALLY ON THE BACK OF NESTLE SEMI-SWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS. I FOUND IT THERE YEARS AGO AND USE IT ALWAYS UNTIL IT WAS MISPLACED. I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT HERE

really creamy and decadent! did as others suggested and cooked fro 6.5 min. also did just under 1c of sugar and did half semi sweet, half milk chocolate chips. used 1 T butter and topped with crushed candy canes (no nuts) for christmas. i made this fudge every year for the holidays and it's always a hit. i think the significant reduction of sugar may have contributed to the slight greasiness of the fudge this last time i made it, but it still turned out delicious and not too sweet at all.

This is the first time I've made fudge with MARSHAMLLOW CREAM, I usually do it the old fashioned way. I followed it to the T, aside from a little different mix of chocolate chips, and I"m just not impressed. It just  tastes like a big soft chocolate bar-not the distinct fudge taste that makes me sacrifice calories during the holidays.

I have made fudge so many times over the years. I needed to use up 7 oz marshmellow jar I had on hand so I google this one.  This recipe is very similar to my recipe except I use reg. marshmellows ect.  I think the combine 3 cups of chips is too much.  (2 cups) 1 cup milk Chocolate and 1 cup semi-sweet chips is a better tasting. Also, I use a good pinch of salt 1/8 teaspoon instead of 1/4 teaspoon! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious and ridiculously easy. I plan on trying different flavored chips and add-ins (nuts, coconut, etc) to alter the end product. 'Keeper' for sure!

This is a great, simple recipe for fudge that saved me when my candy thermometer broke.  I prefer more semisweet chocolate, though, and altered the recipe a bit to favor that over the milk.

This was my first attempt at making fudge and this recipe came out amazing!  While I waited for it to set, I read through some reviews and was nervous as I used margarine in place of the butter and used fat free evaporated milk.  Neither of these effected the recipe though - contrary to other reviews.  The fudge was super creamy and set up perfectly.  A new batch will be needed very soon!

Comes out perfect everytime! I follow this recipe to the letter. I cut the fudge up in small squares and place each square in mini cupcake liners that relate to a season/holiday. I already bought shamrock liners and will be making them for a St. Patrick's Day party!

Turned out wonderful!  I used dark chocolate chips (instead of milk chocolate) and semi-sweet chocolate chips because I don't like m chocolate too sweet.  I also omitted the nuts out of personal preference.  Cooked according to the written directions (just timed it, did not use a thermometer) and it turned out creamy and rich...not gritty at all!  I also used the store brand of marshmallow fluff, because that's all my grocery store had at the time.

I used to make fudge for a living, and never had a batch turn out as bad or as hard as this recipe.  I never used 24 ounces of chocolate in one batch before either.  I was perplexed ... but then I realized I had cooked the slurry up to temp 238 degrees and it barely melted the chips I used.  Now here is the good part; I didn't want to throw out all that chocolate so I was trying to decide how to re-work it.  (I had never done that before either.)  My daughter told me that the fudge was wonderful tasting and she would eat it all, but maybe I could re-melt it somehow?  I got out my trusty double-boiler and melted the fudge adding small amounts of whole milk.  In time it re-melted and I decided to add Cherry Oil flavoring to sweeten the Dark taste. (I used 2 cups semi-sweet and 1 cup milk chocolate.)
I then got an idea to work Cherry Craisens into the fudge to give it a softer chew and maybe add texture and flavor as well.  It worked.  My daughter said it's the best tasting fudge I've ever made.  So I will be trying this recipe again and under cook the sugar and milk just slightly.  The flavor is there, I just have to make sure to follow every step more carefully.  See my picture for my results.  Thank You Aunt Teen, 45,000 plus candy makers can't be wrong.  :)

BEST FUDGE EVER! I have hardly ever had luck with making fudge, so I decided to try this recipe since it had so many great reviews, and now I see why! This is by far the best fudge recipe I've ever tried, and one of the only ones that has worked. I added broken/smooshed candy cane pieces on top of the fudge, it was amazing.  Thanks Aunt Teen!!! :)

Fantastic! This rivaled my girlfriends much sought after fudge whose recipe is a family secret! She was impressed with it as well. I stirred the 6 minutes and it turned out fantastic three times! I gave it to many friends and they all wanted the recipe. One batch I did not stir it the entire time and it wasnt as smooth as the other two batches. Thanks!

Overall this recipe was pretty easy to follow but I did read the other reviewers suggestions like having all your ingredients lined up and ready to go. Also, using my good steel calphalon pan. I didn't use a candy thermometer but I followed the directions carefully. On another note, I did confirm that this recipe actually originated from the DIAMOND WALNUT  brand. It's the exact recipe and it's very old too. THANK YOU!

The best thing I did before making this fudge was reading lots of reviews to gauge any tweaking before attempting to make my first fudge.  The only changes I made to actual recipe was I omitted the nuts.  Two things I would emphasize: (1) measure out everything before (because you can't stop stirring) and (2) stir constantly for 6 1/2 minutes (like I read in other reviews) after you bring those first 5 ingredients to a boil.  After 6 1/2 minutes, I removed from heat, added chips and vanilla and stirred until smooth.  My fudge came out smooth and pretty!  I even sprinkled crushed peppermint candy cane on 1/4 of it to experiment.  It was a highlight this Christmas with my husband and kids!  I plan on adding peppermint extract to it next year (along with the crushed peppermint on top) and give it away as gifts!

I saw the "greasy and crumbly" reviews before making this so I was extra careful to follow instructions perfectly. I measured everything ahead of time and stirred constantly. Unfortunately, my results were "greasy and crumbly". Isn't fudge supposed to be one of the easiest things to make? Oh well.

Easy-peasy--good for beginners.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out fine. One thing to keep in mind is that you must make sure the ingredients are almost fully melted and combined BEFORE you boil it for those crucial 5 minutes!  This means that yes, you will be cooking it (and continuously stirring it) for more than five minutes.  Also, it may look greasy and crumbly BEFORE you put it in the fridge for 2 hours, but it should be fine once it sets.  Anyways, I deleted a star because, while my family seemed suitably impressed with this fudge, I know we've all tasted better melt-in-your-mouth homemade fudge at the yearly x-mas party.  We have one of those friends who always makes this legendary fudge (i don't have the courage to ask for her secret recipe--her baking is like, her one claim to fame) and I'm sorry, but her fudge is just better than this! I suspect she uses a recipe with sweetened condensed milk, so I plan to try something with that next time.

My first time making fudge. I was confused because I put all the ingredients into the pot then turned on medium and it never came to a boil so I turned it up to high (while stirring) and the mixture started to brown on the bottom. I am not sure how you get it to boil on medium or if I was suppose to turn it up. Either way they turned out fantastic. I cooked stirring on medium till melted then high to boil for a couple minutes. Stirred over heat for 10 minutes in all.

This is the best fudge I've ever had.  It was a little more work than the "quick" fudges that are so popular right now, but it is so very worth it!  The flavor is phenomenal.  One caution is that I had some trouble cutting it into cubes right from the fridge; I had to let it sit at room temp about 20-30 min before I could cut it without it shattering.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly except I skipped the nuts and after it was in the 8 x 8 pan I crumbled 4 large Reese peanut butter cups and sprinkled them on top!  It is incredible, I will be making this again.

Delicious! I have never made fudge before so I was nervous, but everyone told me that it was the best fudge they've had for a long time, perhaps ever. This will be my new Christmas tradition! I didn't check for the soft ball stage or anything, I just followed the directions. Put it on medium heat and once it starts boiling wait five minutes. I whisked the evaporated milk/marshmallow cream mixture constantly the entire time and actually got quite a burn from a popping bubble. I didn't mix the walnuts in, but waited about a minute after I had poured it in the pan and sprinkled them on top. By this time, the fudge has started to set so I just took my hands and pushed them in with gentle, but firm pressure. I saw little brownish chunks in the mixture as I was whisking (probably from burnt sugar) but I kept at it and the finished product was very creamy, completely sinful and perfectly formed! Thanks!

I have never made fudge before.  I have eaten perfect, smooth, creamy fudge, AND yucky, gritty, hard fudge.  This recipe made some of the best fudge I have ever tasted.  My husband agreed.  I couldn't believe I made it!

LOVE IT!!!! I tried this for the 1st time last week and its so easy BUT it came out a bit tacky. I tweeked it a bit on my 2nd go and its PERFECT now! here is what I did...I almost doubled the amount of fluff then what is posted (about 12oz). That was the only "real" change to the original recipe.  I then kept the heat on low until the mixture was well combine and not lumpy followed by turning the heat up to med-high.  I used the advice by another reviewer and stopped stirring until i saw "real" bubbles not air bubbles.  Once i had my boil i stirred like the wind for 7 1/2mins constantly tasting so that can judge if it were getting to hot and scorching the sugar. Once the time ran out i removed it from the heat thru in the chips and stirred till my arm felt like it was going to fall of and the mixture was as smooth as silk!  Alittle something special that I did was insted of mixing in a peanut butter or mint to the entire mixture I melted (for my peanut butter batch) reeses pb chips and piped it into the fudge once it was in the pan...this way it didnt spread thru out the entire thing and allowed for perfect balance (not to mention it made it look like i got it from a fancy candy shop when you cut it into pieces).  I really think the key is the amount of time and temp that you cook it!!!  Hope this helps

My family has a delicious fudge recipe passed down for years, ironically it is called "no Fail fudge" but it fails almost every time! This recipe is wonderful!  I made 2 batches back to back (nuts & no nuts) with 5 small children helping me & it turned out perfect!!  I will make this my new fudge recipe from now on!  Next time I would flip flop the choc chips (2 cups semi & 1 cup milk choc). I also used 1 cup of nuts as a personal preference.  Turned out perfect!  Thanks!

i ve been obsessing over getting fudge right (as in not grainy) ive tried at least 5-10 recipies over the years and this is the only one that yielded smooth melt in your mouth fudge that ive been dreaming about-(i started boiling out in a dutch oven and used a thermometer to achieve exactly soft ball and let the ingredients cool to 180 before i added the chocolate) i must admit i did a few substitutions and these are thay- for anyone wondering if you can make this recipe non dairy- yess you can, i used non dairy creamer instead of condensed milk, margerine instead of butter and only semi sweet chocolate chips. fantastic!

This was awesome! Keep scraping sides of pan while cooking to ensure no crystals form; that's what causes grit. I used a haet safe silicone spatula. PERFECTOOOO!!!!

I made this on Monday and by Wednesday it was gone, even after attempting to hide it in the garage (it's cold out there)!  TOP NOTCH recipe, and I have failed other methods and was really hoping that this one would work...and it did! It's FOOLPROOF.  The last one I tried & failed had you using a candy thermometer.  I wound up with a dry, grainy mess.  Aunt Teen's came out so creamy and perfect.  It was addicting, and everyone in my house could not keep their hands off of it.  I will definitely be making this again VERY SOON (as soon as I buy more ingredients!)  Thanks for submitting this!!!

We followed this recipe exactly, including tips from other reviews... even used a trusted candy thermometer.  The mix appeared nice and creamy at 234 degrees, then we immediately added the chocolate and vanilla at which point it started looking gritty.  We poured it out into the pan and chilled in the fridge like it said.  End result - gritty, flaky, unedible garbage.  We verified we did as it said to do, and now can't figure out what everyone else is doing differently to make it turn out so "great".  Clearly something went wrong, but we'll never waste our ingredients trying this again.

Had their been a minus I would have used it.  Im afraid their are positive than negative reviews on the mess of a recipe due to the 30+pages of adds you have to skip through to even get to the point you can review.  I dont profess to be a great cook, but have followed the recipe on fluff for years and sometimes good sometimes not.  Thought I would try this.  What a mess, I followed the recipe exactly and used a candy therometer to boot.  I have a pan of chocolate, hard,sawdust.  Ill be lucky if the pan is ever usable again.  I read some review similar to mine but decided to give it a try.  Beware this recipe is a minus 10.

I have made this recipe for several years, and it is just the best recipe I have yet to find. I feel bad for those who tried the recipe and it didn't turn out. I can only say that I could not make decent fudge for years and that there is definately an art to making it.  This one is a keeper for sure, it is simply the best.

After reading such mixed reviews I was wary, but decided to go ahead and try the recipe.  I think the key is to add the marshmallow creme AFTER you finish boiling the sugar/milk mixture as the recipe I have used from the back of the marshmallow creme suggested.  It came out perfectly and was very easy.

I'm not sure what happened with mine.... I followed the recipe to a "T", and when I put the chocolate chips in, it got so thick immediately that I didn't even get to add my vanilla and nuts! I had to throw the nuts on top and press them into the fudge. To top it all off, YUCK--it doesn't even taste like fudge. I can't understand why everyone is rating this so high. I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe. :(

This fudge is very creamy and very tasty!!  I would recommend the two following things to do: first, use a heavy-duty aluminum pan; second, measure out your chocolate chips in a large mixing bowl along with your chopped nuts.  Than pour your hot mixture over.  My chocolate chips didn't "cook" and melted very nicely and the mixture as easy to stir that way too.  Husband really enjoyed this!!  Thanks, Kathy, for sharing.

This is a perfect recipe for fudge I have been using for a few years now.
Be sure to buy a good quality of Chocolate, or else you get a waxy feel to it. This beats all the evap milk,eaglebrand, etc recipes I have tried. And makes great gifts when packaged with some pretty colored plastic wrap and ribbon.

This was my first time making fudge and I picked this recipe based on it's popularity and because it was supposed to be easy.  Well, it's popularity was well founded and it was as easy as touted.  I am not sure why some people had trouble with this one; I followed the recipe cooking instructions to the letter and it turned out just perfect.  At first I thought that it might not be firm enough, but after it sat in the fridge for two hours I pulled it out and cut it into pieces, then I put it back in the fridge overnight and the consistency was perfect; creamy and firm. 

I also decided to change the recipe ingredients because of some of the user comments.  Instead of using 2 parts chocolate chips and 1 part semi-sweet, I used three different types of chocloate chips, in three equal parts:  Regular chocolate, Belgian semi-sweet, and dark chocolate chips.  This made it very rich and not cloyingly sweet.

The milk chocolate and semi-sweet blend makes the difference on this recipe!

Never having made fudge, I chose this recipe for the ease of preparation (and no candy thermometer).  The results truly are 5 star, no graininess and a great fudge-y flavor.  I cut the pieces very small to fit in mini foil cups -- the perfect portion to satisfy a sweet tooth.

I have been making fudge for over 30 years and this recipe is the best.  I didn't add nuts, because my husband doesn't like them, but I bet it would make it even better!  Thanks.

This was also my first time making fudge and I was a bit nervous after reading about how tempermental fudge can be.  I had no problems with this recipe.  This fudge was sooo yummy.  Everyone at the party I brought it to raved about it.  I am a beginner cook and often have to try recipes 2 or 3 times before getting them right.  This recipe was easy and delicious!  Thanks Aunt Teen!!!

This was my first attempt ever at making fudge. I turned out perfectly! I like it rich, and I dislike nuts, so I made it with 1 cup dark chocolate and 2 cups chopped milk chocolate (instead of chips). I also substituted 7 oz. of marshmallows for the marshmallow cream b/c they're less messy. I didn't have any issues with dryness - it's creamy and rich. My mom and husband were amazed at how rich it was - we are always encountering fudge that's too sugary. So good!

I gave this recipe 2 stars because it tastes pretty good although it is EXTREMELY sweet, however after boiling and stirring till softball stage (I used a thermometer) I poured the chocolate chips in and it turned into a stiff batter and did not "pour" into the pan at all but had to be dropped in and pressed flat. This is my first attempt at fudge and I followed the recipe exactly yet it is not soft and creamy at all. :( I noticed that many people claim to have gotten extremely soft fudge and I had to boil mine for a little longer than 5 minutes to acheive the right temp so maybe it doesn't need to be exactly soft-ball stage?? Any Hints would be welcome.

I made 8 batches for Christmas presents. It was just so easy to make. I used to make my mother's, but this is even better and sooooooo easy. My husband is not much on sweets but he LOVED this fudge so much and brought it to work, and they went crazy over it. He said it was gone in no time. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, this will be a family favorite for years to come. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS ONE!!!!!!!! :)

This was my first attempt at making fudge, because when I was little my mom attempted fudge many times and could never get it right. I was scared to try it!

Well, this came out beautifully! What a great recipe! It was the perfect consistency and the flavor is terrific! I am going to give some away to my in-laws for Christmas just to show them who the REAL cook in the family is! Thanks for a great recipe.

This fudge is wonderful!  It is so easy to make!  I will be making this fudge from now on.  Make sure you use real butter and only 2/3 c. evaporated milk.  Do not use the whole can or your fudge will not set.  
My family loves this fudge!!!  Thanks

I think the combination of milk chocolate and semisweet chips is what makes this recipe a winner. I have made a recipe that uses semi sweet chips that was good and when I tried it with all milk chocolate, it didn't taste right, but the combination of the two works well. I was used to my old Fantasy Fudge recipe that adds the marshmallow creme along with the chips after the boiling period, so I spaced out and did this one the same way and it turned out fine.

Ladies... (and gentlemen) we have a winner!!! Oh my goodness, this fudge is so absolutely creamy & smooth!  It's perfect.  The only thing I did different was to make it in a 9x13inch pan & I omitted the nuts cause the hubby doesnt like them.  It made 40 1-inch squares & they are going very fast!  Will make this for our memorial day cook-out.  Thank you Kelly (and Aunt Teen) for a great recipe.

Its a great recipe, everyone in my family LOVED it. I did mess up a second batch though, first one turned out great the second was way to hard so I think it got too hot considering I cooked it right after the first. Just thought it might help to know since some people were saying there's was hard too.

This is one of my very favorite recipes for fudge.  I often use Ghirardelli's "double chocolate" chips instead of the milk chocolate chips for a very rich dark fudge.  I often use a pan a little larger than the 8X8 in the recipe so that the fudge does not end up so thick.  This fudge is so very rich and delicious.

This is amazing!!!  The only suggestion I have is: Make sure you stir while boiling CONSTANTLY.  Next time I will add just a touch more evaporated milk to make the end result creamier, and I can tell you, there will be a next time.

I think with a few tweaks, this would be an excellent fudge recipe. I can see how it might be too sweet for some (but every tooth in my mouth is a sweet tooth, so I think it's great!). Otherwise, the richness and smoothness/creaminess of the fudge was right on. However, the consistancy of my fudge was not firm enough, probably because I was trying to cook a few other things at the same time so I neglected to make exact measurements and stir as much as I probably should have. It took a long time for the first set of ingredients to blend, and I brought the mixture down to lo heat to blend the chocolate chips in. Right now, after a few hours in the fridge, it's at the consistancy of canned fudge (like for icecream) but I put it in the frezer and it seems more like the somewhat firm fudge that I'm used to. Make sure not to add too much evaporated milk.

Smooth, creamy, easy to make recipe. Tasty recipe which was well liked. The only thing I did differently was not line my pan with foil. I never do for fudge. I just grease the pan with butter. I had no problem getting the fudge out. I also saw no need to refrigerate.  I found I needed to cook the marshmallow mixture on medium low. Even though I was stirring the marshmallow/sugar mixture constantly with a wire whisk, it was starting to burn on medium. Both times I made this fudge, I thought something was wrong after I added the vanilla and nuts. The texture changed rapidly and it seemed to be watery as I poured it into the pan. However, it set up beautifully. If you like a nutty fudge, make sure you put in more nuts. I followed the recipe as is the first time and there were not enough nuts for me. I used one and half cups for my second batch and that was so much better. Great recipe. Thank you!

this recipe turned out fabulous! i was hesitant at first due to a few reviews stating that the fudge was too soft. maybe those reviewers did not let the mixture come to a full boil before counting the 5 minutes? regardless, it was easy and great consistency, will make again!

This was a very easy recipe to make with good results.  As suggested in previous reviews, I brought the heat up slowly stirring constantly and that worked well.  Also, following suggestions from other reviewers about the recipe being too sweet, I put in 2 cups of semi-sweet to 1 cup milk choco chips.  I don't care for the taste (a little bitter, not sweet enough for me) but my husband thought it was good.  Next time I will try the recipe as it is written.  I put the batch in the freezer instead of the refrigerator for about an hour and it firmed up very nicely. I will definitely try this recipe again with modifications.

I made this for a Christmas party at work.  I lovedit, but others thought it was way too sweet. I only added the walnuts to half of the fudge, so maybe that had something to do with it.  Very good overall

I'm afraid I followed other people's recommendations and this turned out to be a huge disappointment...  I am a great baker and don't mess recipes up much, but this one was a flop.  I think I'll stick to my mom's recipe.

Great recipe!!  I sprinkled little candy holly leaves & berries on it when it was still warm and then put it in my outdoor fridge to set.  (I was a little nervous when I brought it in because it was almost frozen and had turned a light brown color, BUT once it thawed it was dark & looked BEAUTIFUL).    Not greasy at all & soooo delicious!  I got wonderful raves & I will make this for all occasion gifts.  Thanks to you Kelly & your Aunt as well!!

Every year I try to make fudge and every year it never sets, it's always runny.  Until this year... this is by far the EASIEST and most problem-free recipe I've ever tried.  I followed it exactly as it was and used cookie piece pecans.  YUM!  My only complaint?  It's too rich, you can only eat a very small piece at a time!  :)

I made 3 different fudge recipes the same day and this was the only one that looked and tasted like I had bought it at a fine bakery!  Don't rush the chilling process as you want it as firm as possible before slicing for a neater presentation

Horrible Fudge Recipe! I have tried numerous recipes and this one takes the cake. I have a professional oven and 5.5 minutes on my stove might be way hotter than a standard kitchen stove top and wow di dit ever turn out bad. I think if there was some guidance on the temprature then maybe it might have worked but 5.5 minutes could be anything to anybody!

Really good. Usually when I try to make fudge, it's either grainy or doesn't set up. This set up in 2 hours. And it's very good.

This recipe was great! The consistency was very smooth, my family and friends raved over it. I like milk chocolate and I changed the type and measurements of chips. I used 2 cups of White Chips and 1 Cup Milk Choc Chips. I loved it!!

This was the first fudge recipe I ever tried, and it's been my go-to recipe for Christmas treats for the last five years. I generally make two batches, one as is. For the second batch, I swap out a cup of milk chocolate chips for mint chocolate chips and put some crushed Andes candies on top. I love this fudge - it's great for beginners, very forgiving and super delicious. Make sure to line the pan with parchment paper to make removing and cutting it a cinch.

Great Fudge with a few modifications. My sister & I made this several time adjusting the recipe till it came out perfect each time. In the original recipe the flavor was a little bland. We altered the amount of about of chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups for each semisweet & milk chocolate. The fudge was a little dry so we increased the butter to 6 tablespoons. We used a digital thermometer and cooked the mixture to 230 degrees.  Also, lightly butter the sides of your pot before you begin so the fudge won't stick.  We doubled the recipe with no problems. We made 20 double batches of the fudge for a concession stand & each batch came out perfect. 

We made a Chocolate Mint variation that is fabulous. Use 1 cup each of Nesley chocolate mint chips, semisweet & milk chocolate chips. Add 1/2 cup of crushed Thin Mints (or a knock off brand)  and when it is poured in a pan top with more crushed cookies.

Best fudge ever! My boyfriend knew I wanted fudge, found this simple recipe and in two days I ate the entire batch, AWESOME!! He didn't change a thing, he has made this fudge multiple times and it always comes out perfect, this is the fudge you can't buy in a store, it is so creamy and perfect.

It tastes good.  But I am not sure if it would have been better to cook syrup without marshmallow cream.  I cooked all together with cream as required but I saw the cream blended and then got flat as I was sterling constantly for 5 minutes.  I noticed the other fudge recipe on the marshmallow jar recommending to put the cream with the chocolate chips at the end.  So, I would try changing the procedure next time to see if that will make the fudge more airy.

OK I love this recipe.  It is super creamy and melts in your mouth.  It almost has the consistency of very soft caramels!  I adjusted the recipe based on other peoples recommendations by using 1 tablespoon butter instead of 1/4 cup.  I cooked it for 7 minutes instead of 5.  I used melted marshmallows instead of marshmallow fluff because it was all I had.  I am going to try it with the fluff tomorrow when I can get to the store - I will update this review then!  My son said he thought the vanilla was a bit strong but I use real vanilla and not the imitation  so that may have been why.  I will cut it to 1/2 teaspoon and see if that helps.  Personally though I like the vanilla flavor!  One suggestion - have your pan ready as this stuff sets up fast!

I'm not sure if I did it right...usuall fudge is set and you can cut it and maintain squares. It didn't set in the 2 hours and it is very soft to the touch after 7 hours. Is it the Marshmellos cream?  Is Marshmello cream actually marshmello fluff?

I follow some people's advice and used only 1 Tbsp butter and cooked for 6.5 min.  Heating the jar of marshmallow for 15 sec in a microwave was a really good tip.

BEST FUDGE EVER, people.  I had given up hope of making fudge again.  I had tried many recipes and even the "easy" ones were flops.  This is the magic. Firm but creamy, rich without being gritty or chalky.  This is the holy grail of fudge.  Word.

Soooo good and very easy.   I toast the waluts first, otherwise they make my mouth sore  The last batch I left out the walnuts and swirled in some peanut butter just before pouring onto foil lined pan.   I love peanut butter fudge.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Delicious with or without the nuts.  However, I suggest 6T. butter instead of the 8T.

This fudge is fantastic! I made it without the nuts and it was rich and chocolaty. I would suggest boiling on a heat lower than high, so that the mixture doesn't burn. This will in turn make the heating time longer, maybe 7 minutes as others have said. Will make again!

1550 other reviews have probably said all I could say about this recipe.  It's dependably good every time I make it.  I don't add nuts to fudge but it doesn't effect the end product.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing Aunt Teen!

I made this recipe for my son's last day of school party and it came out perfect.  It was not grainy, it firmed up nicely for me.  After reading several reviews this is what I came up with.  I kept the mixture on low until everything was completely melted and kept stirring.  After everything thing was melted I went to a medium heat for 2 minutes then to high.  After it was at a rolling boil I kept stirring for 61/2 minutes.  Added the vanilla then 2 hours in the fridge.

Outstanding fudge. So easy that even this beginner couldn't screw it up. The evaporated milk and marshmallow cream make sure the fudge doesn't crystallize.

This is some seriously delicious fudge! I've made it 3 times in the past two weeks and it's always turned out perfectly. The first time I made it I didn't have evaporated milk so I used half heavy cream and half milk and still turned out great. Used only 1 tablespoon of butter. I boiled it for 6 1/2 minutes as recommended by others and it set up nice and firmly. I'll definitely be making this all year round!

My first time making fudge and this was a great recipe!  I found a few others that looked iffy, but this one worked like a charm... just what I wanted out of fudge.  The first time I made it, I used 2 cups of milk chocolate and 1 cup of white and it was lovely.  This time, I used 2 cups of semi sweet and one cup of white mint candy melts... it's in the fridge now, so I have to wait to test it, but it looks and smells divine, and the spoon tells me this will be a winner!

Using a candy thermometer like someone suggested did not work at all! Time it for 6-1/2 to 7 minutes and it was perfect. Used toasted pecans. Very yummy!

Great fudge! This was my first try at fudge and it turned out delicious. I made one batch following the recipe exactly. It turned out the perfect consistency. I also did one peppermint batch by adding 1 tsp. of peppermint extract along with the vanilla and then sprinkled crushed candy cane on top. This was my favorite!

This is my second review of the recipe, after having it not come out so many times I finally decided to try the recipe on marshmallow jar itself; it was SO much better. Look up the recipe for "fantasy fudge". I think the problem is that these instructions call for the marshmallow cream to be cooked with everything, then you add the chocolate. This causes the mixture to seize up and become hard to work with, it also ruins the texture (crumbly and greasy). The marshmallow jar instructions call for the marshmallow cream to be added LAST (after the chocolate)!

If you do try this recipe, add the marshmallow cream last, and as I stated in my previous review, do not use ghirardelli chocolate chips (use nestle)!

First time making fudge ever, and it turned out AWESOME!  I'm thinking I'll use someone's suggestion next time and cook it a minute or so longer to make the rest of it more firm, but it's SOOOO rich and creamy.  :)  Used 2 tbls butter instead of the 1/4 cup since others said it was greasy.

WOW!!!  I had never been successful with fudge until now and it is sooooo good. As good as any Ive ever had before. I followed the 1st reviewers advice to stir like crazy and work fast. Otherwise, the only thing I changed was left out the nuts and added a pecan half to each square while the fudge was warm.Thank you so much for this recipe.

I read some of the tips, reviews and such.  I followed the directions but added 1 minute to the boil time, evened up the ratio of chocolate, half and half on the semi sweet and milk chocolate chips.  I also added 3/4 cup of Heath Bar pieces.  It turned out awesome and I WILL be making this again and for Christmas presents.

NO MORE FUSSY FUDGE! I've made fudge in the past and always had trouble keeping the temp right, undercooking and it was too goopy or overcooking and it was just a chocolate bar.  DH requested fudge this year so with apprehension I searched AR for the highest rated fudge I could find, figuring if it was rated highly it must be tasty AND easy, right? Even WITH those expectations I didn't expect anything THIS easy and THIS tasty.  Absolutely foolproof, delicious, and I'll be giving it a go with flavor variations too. Could not recommend this recipe more highly. Thank you, "Aunt Teen!"

Rave reviews from coworkers.....but..........Kuwait version
Forget the marshmallow creme. Just get the bag of marshmallows from the candy aisle. Enjoy a snack of the left overs since you don't need the whole bag.
The evaporated milk is the NET. WT 170g for the conversion. One call later to a friend to figure the conversion. 
Check the candy aisle for milk chocolate since there were no chips available. They had a kilo block dark chocolate for the semi sweet chocolate. 
Now I know why my shopping trip took over a half hour for a basket of stuff! Cooking overseas can be a challenge.

I think it was this fudge that I didn't quite make right, I think I added the marshmallow cream too early.  They turned out like caramel chocolates!!!  SOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy!
(Note: don't line the pan with wax paper, just put some cooking spray.)

Very delicious. Really, but I HAD A HORRIBLE TIME COOKING IT. I 100% know its me and I really can't figure out what I did wrong. I don't want to be mean LOL because I know i
m doing something stupidly wrong. I don't have a thermometer so I know its most likely the fact I don't do the soft ball test so when I added my chocolate it burnt. It did taste good and firmed, and I really wished I did it right.

Nice, simple fudge recipe.  Followed the advice of others and cut back the butter.  Next time I'm going to try add-ins!  So yummy!

Followed recipe and made one batch of chocolate and one batch half semi sweet chocolate chips and half butterscotch. Both were good but the butterscoth was to die for. Perfect fudge recipe!

really very good - no need to wait till vacation any longer. I happen to like a milk chocolatey flavor so i used a little less semi sweet and more milk chocolate the second time I made it... but overall it is an excellent recipe....

OMG this recipe turned out great. I did use a hand mixer real quickly to smooth it out before adding the nuts. I will be making this ever year.
Thank you!

One of the key reasons fudge doesn't turn out is due to temperature problems.  Make sure you time the five minutes.  Don't guess.  Also, make sure it is at a FULL, ROLLING BOIL, and not just starting to bubble.

The "secret" to this fudge is in the chocolate chips.  I have played around with different types of chocolate, milk, semi-sweet, and bittersweet.  Try adding some bittersweet ones if you do not like sweet fudge.  I found that the combination of chocolates makes this fudge absolutely outstanding.  I recommend Ghirardelli.

Thanks for the recipe!!

Good, rich fudge.  I attempted to double the recipe, which I do not recommend.  If you want twice the fudge, make it twice.  The sugar did not cook down enough and you had the slight sugar crunch.  Still got compliments on the taste though.

Great flavor.  Super easy to make.  Made this twice.  The first time followed the recipe exactly and the fudge was a bit grainy, but still had good flavor.  Second time made it with mint chips & chocolate chips and the flavor was great.  This does melt in your mouth!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very smooth and tasty.  I made one mistake. I forgot to add the third cup of choc chips while the mixture was still in the pot.  I added the semi chips after I had poured the mixture into a pan.  Fortunately, the mixture was hot enough to melt the chips.  Would you believe it all turned out so smooth...foolproof fudge and very easy to do.

I got a lot of compliments and raves about this fudge this Christmas.  This was my first year making fudge so it took me a couple of times to get it perfect.  The first batch I followed the recipe except that I don't think I cooked it long enough because I wasn't sure how the marshmallow mixture was supposed to look at a full boil and was afraid of scorching.  It came out much too soft but I let it dry out on a cooling rack and it turned out a little softer than normal but very creamy.  The second time I waited longer until it was very obviously boiling and then started the 6 1/2 minutes another reviewer recommended.  This batch turned out perfect!  I gave a mixed goody tin to a ton of family members and they couldn't get enough of the fudge! Will absolutely use this recipe again for years to come, maybe trying butterscotch as well!

Delicious!  This is the first time I ever made fudge and it turned out beautifully.  I used a non-stick pan and I did microwave the fluff for 15 seconds to help get it out of the jar.  Then boiled it for a full 7 minutes as was suggested in another review.  I even added the little sprinkles on top like the picture.  I brought it to a party last night and the reviews were awesome ("this is just like my grandma used to make!").  It's all gone and I'm going to have make more for Santa - he wants fudge with his cookies this year.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and took others advice decreased sugar by a 1/4 cup and cooked it for 6 minutes, constantly stirring it. I was able to stir the chips in, vanilla, and nuts without any problem. It poured easily into my pan and leveled easily. It set up perfectly (guess it was my lucky day!) and I used a cheese cutter, the one with a wire to cut the fudge. My only problem was that it was still too sweet and not that rich chocolate taste. Maybe next time, I would either cut the sugar more and either add some unsweetened cocoa or chocolate pieces.

I have had trouble over the years making a tasty fudge. I have probably tried about 8 different recipes and all not coming out right. This one HITS THE BULLS EYE! Eureka! Finally someone got it right. Easy, delicious, no gritty consistency, just pure heaven. I added some finely chopped nuts. Everyone who has tried it raves over this fudge! Definitely use a hot wet knife to slice. Store in fridge. Aunt Teen rocks!

Eh, I wasn't impressed.  I've eyed a similar recipe on the back of Fluff jars and was always skeptical about boiling the marshmallow crème.  I believed the fudge would end up tasting like burnt marshmallows.  I've made other types of fudge using Fluff and it is always added after boiling.  How can one boil marshmallows and not end up caramelizing them?  However, I saw all the rave reviews and figured I must be wrong.  I was not.   I had no problems with the fudge setting up (I used a candy thermometer to make sure I was at the softball stage).  The texture was smooth and creamy, but I could definitely taste the caramelized marshmallows.  I did not find this flavor appealing.  I think adding the Fluff after boiling would've made for a better flavor.  I don't know, maybe most people like the taste of caramelized marshmallows in their chocolate fudge.  I certainly do not.  I decided to call it s'mores fudge and crumble some graham crackers on top.  The kids ate it; I stuck to the good stuff.

Absolutely fabulous! I followed the recipe to the letter, and it's perfect.  As good as any fudge I've had anywhere.  The only thing I did differently was that I lined the pan with parchment paper instead of foil, and it worked perfectly.  The fudge came out of the pan with no problem at all.  Thank you for our new yearly holiday fudge recipe!

After seeing such high positive ratings for this recipe, I was disappointed with the way this fudge came out twice.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  The first time it came out crumbly and grainy.. I read more reviews and followed some other's advice on stirring for more than 6 minutes.. both times it came out hard and crumbly.. I've made many different kinds of fudge and they never came out this way.  I ended up making the fudge recipe on the back of the Fluff jar and it came out perfect and creamy!

You really have to work fast once you add the chocolate chips because it hardens up too fast.  I had to spread it into the pan not pour it.  It didn't look very pretty at all.

At this point, I am frustrated. Maybe it is because I used a stainless steel pan, but even on low heat it scorched. So, I'll try again sometime and try to review once again. Stainless steel pans are a pain.

this is so good! when i read through the comments i was a little worried about how mine would turn out since i have only made fudge once before and it was a lot easier fudge recipe. but mine turned out great! just remember to keep stirring! and if it seems like the marshmallow fluff is burning a bit, don't worry mine did that and the finished product was still delicious.

I've made this fudge at least 100 times....however, twice I used marshmallow creme and I can say the fudge comes out much better when using marshmallow fluff....I actually began making this recipe and a peanut butter with fluff (which both called for marshmallow creme) because marshmallow creme is not readily available here in Maine...I only seem to find it during the Christmas season.  I get so many compliments!  Love it...

AWESOME! I used to get exhaust stirring the fudge and struggling to get marshmallow fluff in the chocolate when removed from the heat - family recipe. This version is every bit as creamy and yummy but with a waaaay easier method of making it. This IS my new way of making fudge...THANK YOU!

My favorite fudge recipe... I put all kinds of chips to create a variety of flavours. I have found it freezes well ...that is if it lasts long enough to end up in the freezer. :-) The white chocolate and Oreos are my favorite with a cookies and cream type flavour. Try any kind of chips .. you won't be disappointed!

Such a great recipe, smooth and not so sweet maybe because I did mine with 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cups of mint chocolate chips, and I used pecans.  If you like a pepperment patty...then this is what you want to do it was soooo amazing!!

I put the marshmallow in the microwave for 15 seconds before adding it, and it came clean out of the jar. Instead of 2c milk chocolate an 1 c semisweet chocolate, I switched the amounts. Great fudge.

Recipe was good but the directions could have been written better. For example, In the beginning you should prepare the chocolate chips, chopped nuts, and vanilla so it is already ready when your milk-marshmallow mixture is done boiling. I found this out the hard way. I had ended up chopping up the nuts and getting the other ingredients ready afterward and the mixture cooled too fast and didn't mix well. The fudge didn't turn out as good. It is a Great recipe, but instructions should be fixed and more descriptive.

The first time I made this fudge, I followed all the other reviewer's advice of less sugar and less butter. My fudge turned out dry, crumbley, unedible and had to be thrown out. The next batch, I followed the recipe exactly as stated and my fudge turned out perfect! That's what I get for not following the original recipe the first time like I usually do!

I had never made fudge before because it always seemed too difficult.  I made this for the first time for a family Christmas Eve dinner.  It's always a competition to see who can bring the most popular dish and this fudge was a big hit!  I used just under a cup of marshmallow crème, used Ghirardelli chocolate and made sure I was constantly whisking the mixture.  I followed the directions to a "T" and didn't change or substitute a thing other than the pan.  I didn't have an 8X8 square so I used an 8" spring form pan.  I sprayed it with cooking spray and didn't line with foil and it worked out perfectly.  I will definitely be using this recipe in the future because it was so easy to make and the results are fantastic relative to the time and effort required.  Great recipe Kelly!

This was the first time I ever made fudge and it turned out awesome!   I didn't have semisweet chocolate chips but was able to convert baking chocolate squares.  I also added raspberry extract to mine instead of the vanilla as an experiment. (which turned out great) Great recipe for first time users!

This was the first time I've ever made fudge - by the way it turned out, you would think I was a pro. Absolutely perfect - wouldn't change a thing!! (oh...but I found I had to cool it longer than 2 hours before it was ready to serve.)

Could not be easier - fool proof!  Have made several times, decreased sugar to 1c, everything else is the same.  Made dark chocolate by switching chip ration to 1c Milk/2c Semi Sweet, made Peanut Butter with 3c PB chips, White Chocolate with 3c White Chocolate, layered them, added nuts and have left them out.  You just can't go wrong with this one!  Thanks for such a killer recipe!

This was AWESOME!  I'm in love!  I added toffee bits in place of nuts and it was UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I cooked it to a temp of 238 and it worked out perfectly.  It seemed to take longer than 5-7 min.  But I'm glad I waited till that temp was reached.  Thank you for sharing!

A great recipe for a creamy fudge... made it without nuts since my friend didnt want any in the fudge...but it was very rich I think it would have been better if there were some in the fudge. But very tasty!

This is a GREAT fudge recipe, very easy to make and delicious!  I made a couple of small changes.  I reduced the sugar to one cup, and used and equal ratio of milk chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips (1 and 1/2 cups of each).  I stir for exactly five minutes and it's perfect!  I've made it a couple of times already and this will definitely be a go-to when I need something sweet to bring someone and don't have a lot of time to make something more elaborate.  Thanks for a great recipe!

A big,sugary, gross,non-firming hot mess.  I even cut the the sugar in half and it was still overwhelming.  Tried a version of fudge with condensed milk and turned out perfect. Would not recommend unless you like ultra sweet syrupy fudge.

My rating is for a decreased sugar amount - otherwise it's too sweet!   I've made this many times and as other reviewers have said, it doesn't matter what type of chocolate you add, as long as you add 3 cups.   You don't need to add much sugar (that's all that fluff is). I find that it's very sweet even with all dark chips and only a cup of sugar. Even my roommate who hates dark chocolate says it shouldn't be much sweeter than that.   Also, even if you decrease the amount of butter you put in, put it in! Otherwise the fudge will not fully set and will "sticky" and viscous.   If you're afraid of putting hot fudge in the refrigerator, make a heat sink: put ice cubes (1-2 trays) in a larger pan and stick the tray of fudge on top of it. This helps it set well, and makes certain that it is hard enough at room temperature.

It was great. I had to use Hershey's bar milk chocolate, for I didn't have milk chocolate chips. It called for 2 cups, so that is 16 oz and each bar is 1.5 oz. So I used 10.5 bars. I only had nine. So I used a 1/4 of semisweet and added a little sugar. It was PERFECT! I loved it.

This was great. My whole family loved it.  I will be making this every year for christmas.  I also used some mint chocolate chips for one of the batches and I couldn't stop eating it.

Fabulous and delicious! I prefer milk chocolate, so I used a bag of Guittards milk chocolate chips with a dark candy bar to top off the measurement. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I can't tolerate sweet food much so I tried to make this not tooth-rotting by using in place, 1/2 cup unsweetened chocolate, ended up needing to add 2 tbsp sugar to not make it so bitter, ended up really being creamy and because of the cocoa powder, it was slightly dark chocolate-y

My 1st time making fudge and this was really, really good!! I added marshmallow and pecans. I put the marshmallows in the dish and stuck it in the freezer while I prepared the fudge and poured it over the cold marshmallows. I will make this again for sure!

It's only good for it's addition of the marshmellow creme. It really all depends on the quality of chocolate you use, NOT on how good this recipe is. I tried to melt all the sugar, but it took 3 hours to do so on low-medium heat (any higher, and the concoction would burn and leave brown bits floating around, which is not pretty to see). When the sugar STILL hadn't been completely melted, the end product was grainy. However, since I used Guittard chocolate chips (which are superb for cooking or baking), my fudge came out as a success, even with the grainy texture. I just convinced everyone that it was grainy because I put crushed chocolate candy pieces in there. Anyway, this recipe doesn't really work, but it IS creamy thanks to the marshmellow creme. But it won't make a smooth end product. The taste is stellar, but the texture is not. Also, if you use Nestle Tollhouse or Hershey's or even Godiva's chocolate chips for this recipe, you'll come out with an average fudge dud that'll only taste like chocolate chips. NOT good. Use imported chocolates, like Guittard or Callebaut, and you'll be able to convince people that you bought this fudge from a good chocolate store.

I actually tried this after always having my fudge turn out grainy (no matter what recipe I tried) and this was not grainy.  It was easy to make and set up perfectly.  I used good quality chocolate chips but I felt it tasted too much like the chocolate chips--wasn;t quite what I was after, but it was good.

This turned out great. I stirred the entire time it was boiling to prevent the marshmallow from burning. I agree with some reviewers that any fudge recipe with chips and marshmallows doesn't really constitute as REAL fudge, but cooking it without takes a lot of skill and this recipe turned out creamy and delicious without all the hassle. Thanks Aunt Teen!!!

This is my first review ever, but I really feel this fudge is the best ever! A few changes we made were: cut the sugar to 1 cup, 2 cups semisweet, 1 cup milk choc chips, no nuts. We added a little strong coffee at the same time we added the vanilla to make the chocolate a little darker in flavor. Wasn't sure about whether to cut the butter as others suggested, but decided not to, loved the result and wouldn't change this. Also you can add crushed candy or sprinkles to the top to make it look fancier. We boiled it to just barely soft ball stage (testing drops of mixture in ice water as we went) which at low boil took around 7-8 minutes. This was perfect! Made 6 batches total to give out for the holidays.

This is great fudge!  It was a snap to make, too!  This was my first attempt EVER at making fudge and I have to tell you, it was SOOO easy!  I followed some other reviewers tips and used only 1 TBSP butter and 1 1/4 C sugar instead of what's called for in the original recipe.  I took the fudge into work today for our Christmas party and it's ALL GONE!  And this recipe made a LOT of fudge!  Everyone kept asking "Who made this fudge?"  Since I'm only 22 and everyone I work with is 30+ it made me feel good to be a part of the "big girls" cooking group!  =)

THANKS, AUNT TEEN, FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!

I've reviewed Aunt Teen's fudge before.  But I have to pay homage once more.  It is the most dependable, rewarding fudge recipe I've ever used. Cooking the marshmallow creme makes a much richer, more finished taste, less raw than fudge made by adding marshmallow creme after cooking the sugar and evaporated milk.  Moreover, from this recipe was born my own embarrassingly well received Maple Walnut fudge.  To make it, substitute white chocolate chips for milk and semi sweet chocolate chips, substitute dark brown sugar for white sugar, increase the salt to 1/2 t.  Add a T or so of Mapleine (imitation maple flavoring, or other maple essence of your choice) instead of vanilla.  Add a cup of chopped walnuts.  It is to die for if I do say so myself.

This is a great recipe, I made this along with the Eaglebrand peanut butter fudge. This came out a little thinner than eagle's version, but it set up beautifully. I did use a candy thermometer and a regular large pan (not bottom heavy)... turned out fine. Thank you so much for posting this recipe...time to experiment

This fudge is soo good! So rich, creamy, and great chocolate flavor! I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate together, so I make a batch of this fudge and the Creamy Peanut Butter Fudge by Josephine and I layer them in a 9.5x11 caserole dish. INCREDIBLE. makes thick, peanut butter chocolate fudge goodness!

I'm about to make my third batch today - yes, I am making 4 batches of this in one day to give as gifts tomorrow. I thought the recipe sounded easy and mostly everyone seems to have gotten good results.  My results have been spectacular thus far. The first batch, i used 2 c of semi-sweet chips with 1 c of peanut butter chips...probably a good choice since the burner was on a little high and the marshmallow got a little "toasty".  The next batch I lowered the burner a little more and still had a small issue with the marshmallow but you'd never know it.  I used 2 c semi-sweet and 1 c of the crushed Andes mint chips and substituted a tsp of peppermint extract for the vanilla. YUMBO! I am about to make the plain chocolate batch and plan to use 2 c of the semi-sweet and 1 c of the milk chocolate chips.  I do have some butterscotch chips that I may use in the 4th batch, not sure yet.  I do expect my 3rd and 4th runs at this recipe to be as tasty, creamy and smooth as the first two.  It sure beats the microwave fudge recipes that are out there as far as texture and taste go and the end results are sure to impress anyone who is lucky enough to be on the receiving end of one of these little pieces of chocolate heaven!!

I went with the 1 TBSP of butter, bad call.  This tastes nothing like Mom's.  This tastes simply like a 8 x 8 block of melted chocolate chips.  It's missing all the dimensions of fudge. I will not try to remake it and go with the original fantasy fudge recipe still not mom's but much more fudge like ;)

I swapped out 2 cups milk chocolate for 2 cups butterschotch bits and got a great response.  Like others have said cook for longer than 6 minutes, and I would also suggest not using the full amount of sugar, it was a little too sweet.  I chilled over night covered in foil and thought they were too moist, will try cutting them and letting them sit out before boxing up.

This fudge was quite a hit! All the scores except for two, were 5's. It was so creamy and the flavor just right. It was so easy and we didn't change a thing!

Extremely rich, but so easy to eat!  This fudge was very creamy.  I used 2c semi sweet chips and 1c peanut butter chips, leaving out the nuts.  The fudge had a great texture- I agree, it is good enough to sell!  I think I'll try more flavor combinations, but this is THE fudge recipe for me and my loved ones ;)

EASY!  I had tried to make a similar recipe but it turned out awful.  This was very simple and thanks to the others who suggested cutting back on the butter & sugar.  I also did 2c semi sweet chips and 1c milk choc. chips...perfect.  Lastly, cooked for 6 min.

Had difficulty with this recipe.  I followed it exactly and when I added the chocolate chips, the fudge "broke" and got grainy.  Adding room temperature chocolate to a hot mixture does not sound like it will work.  The fudge turned out okay (edible and generally enjoyed), but certainly not smooth or creamy.  It was dry and grainy.  I will be looking for a new recipe.  Any thoughts on this issue would be appreciated

I cannot rave enough about this recipe!! It was stupendous--I really was impressed. I'd never made fudge but my boyfriend asked me if I ever thought about making it... so I looked around Allrecipes and found this one. It was perfectly creamy, rich, sweet, and not in the least bit grainy. A tiny square was enough for a dose, so it lasted a while and it kept well. I did half walnuts, half no walnuts and both were delightful.

Excellent recipe!!!! I did not add the nuts (we do not like nuts in fudge in my house) and used Mexican vanilla. 
If I made this as often as everyone wanted, we would all weigh 500 pounds LOL

I had been looking for a good chocolate fudge recipe. I was making fudge for a bake sale and I found this recipe. It had good reviews so I decided to try it. It was so simple to make and came out perfect. I made it just as the recipe stated and thought it turned out wonderful. I sold every piece and even had one girl come back and ask for the recipe. She said it tasted just like the kind of fudge you buy at one of the fudge shops. Pretty good compliment. Thanks Aunt Teen.

I was very, very, happy with this fudge. I used it as a base recipe for a confection I made over the weekend. To this fudge i added unsalted peanuts which i roughly chopped. Then, after the fudge had cooled in the fridge for a day, cut it into squares and then dunked them into melted Marshmallow cream and then rolled the fudge chunks in graham cracker crumbs. This is going to be my go-to fudge recipe for the holidays. Smashing!

I made this recipe and have never made fudge before.  I used walnut pieces and it was great.  Everyone said it was great fudge.  I did read the comments and started cooking the mixture slow.  I also microwaved the marshmallow creme for about 20 seconds.  It made getting out of the jar easier.  My daughter doesn't like nuts so I made a second batch without nuts.  It was very creamy and chocolatey.  I prefer the nuts.  It helps take some of the sweetness out.  Thanks for a keeper!!!

This was some of the most delicious fudge I've ever made.  I used more semi sweet chips than chocolate.  I will be making this every year... at least as far as my family is concerned.

I got rave reviews on this fudge! It is so creamy! This was my first time ever to make fudge and it's pretty fool proof. As other reviewers mentioned, heat the marshmallow jar for 10-20 seconds before hand and don't put it on the bottom of the pan (it will burn if it's on the bottom). I boiled it for 7 min. one time and it came out to stiff and then 5 minutes one time and it took a lot longer to set - some other reviewer said to stir constantly, but as a general candy making rule, you don't stir while it's reaching the stage you want (soft ball, in this case). The second time I made this fudge I used white chocolate and butterscotch - yum!

THE BEST! My husband just loves fudge and said how great it was. I've made it with and without nuts since my husband is a "purist" and doesn't like anything in his fudge, and both were wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly as written and didn't have any problems. This is so much easier and faster than traditional fudge like I'm used to making! Now I'll be making fudge more often! Thanks for the recipe!

EW! i printed this recipe off for my mom to make. she is an AMAZING fudge maker and uses one of her favorite recipes every year. i gave her this recipe to try somethign different, she made it, and it turned out very poorly
she patiently stood over the saucepan stirring, and even used a candy thermometer, and this fudge came out DRY DRY DRY DRY DRY. i can shake the pan in the fridge and stuff is actually crumbling around! i tasted a bite and it was so overly bittersweet that it sapped the life out of the milk chocolate. she followed the recipe to a t.  obviously something went terribly wrong!

The fudge tastes much better with Ghirardelli chocolate (milk & semi-sweet). Boil it for 3-4 minutes though or you'll have a brick! It doesn't taste as waxey (compared to Nestle Toll House).

I have no idea why anyone could ever NOT love this fudge unless it wasn't made correctly. I have tasted countless fudge recipes and this one is hands-down the creamiest, most UN-gritty, yummy fudge I have ever tasted. I have been making it for the past 12 years and have never had anyone try it that didn't LOVE it...weird, it must be that people are using different types of chocolate chips?? I always use Nestle and like I said, it is fabulous!!! Enjoy!!!

OMG this is absolutely to die for.  There have been over 7 guests to my house since I made this yesterday and not one of them has not had at least three pieces.  Everybody said well just one piece until they tasted it.  Not one of them have had just one.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is a keeper and so easy.

This fudge is great using just milk chocolate and another cup of nuts.  DO NOT OVER COOK OR IT WILL BE DRY!!!  I make 5 or 6 batches every year.
Very, very, easy to make.

This is the worst fudge recipe I have ever made.  I have no idea where the good reviews came from.  I'm an excellent baker and this fudge came out crumbly.  It is not smooth fudge.  If you like crumbly fudge, this is the recipe for you!

After reading a bunch of previous reviews of this recipe, I decided to give it a test run because I wanted to incorporate fudge into my holiday season gifts. I followed others' advice regarding putting the marshmallow fluff in AFTER boiling the milk/sugar/butter/salt and used a candy thermometer to watch for 234 degrees F. I also took the advice about decreasing the sugar by 1/4 cup. It turned out well! I used 2 cups of semi-sweet morsels, and 1 cup milk chocolate morsels. It's sweet and creamy. Not a traditional old fashioned fudge, but a good treat in and of it's own right.

I hae been making this reccipe for 2.5 years now and it is always a hit.  I add a bit more of the semisweet chips as they are my favorite and everyone always loves it.  I also don't add nuts.  I found it best to make in one of the "throw away" bake tins as cutting it into pieces can sometimes be a pain.

This was easy and delicious!  I buttered the bottom of the foiled pan to prevent the foil from sticking in the fudge and used slightly less than the 2/3 cup of evaporated milk due to the pre-portioned amount in the 5-oz cans, which didn't seem to cause any trouble.  I will definitely be making this as a regular desert item.  Thanks Kelly!

This is awesome!! We make this every year for christmas now. I am quilty of making changes, but only slightly...we do 1 1/2 cups of each choc chips if we are making it with no nuts...It is richer that way.  Fabulous recipe! I'm just looking it up to make it again :)

Excellent recipe that makes delicious fudge very quickly and easily, esp. if you don't have/don't want to bother with a candy thermometer. I followed other reviews and added the marshmallow creme & the rest AFTER boiling the sugar, milk and butter for 5 minutes. It turned out great. I added white chocolate chips on top to make it pretty looking. I gave this fudge as a gift and it was a big hit! I will definitely make this again!

Loved the creaminess of this and it is very chocolaty.  You do need to be careful not to scorch it, as others have said.  I scorched it a little but it didn't hurt it.  Next time I will fix it like traditional marsh. creme fudge, and add the marshmallow creme & the rest after boiling the sugar, milk and butter for 5 minutes.  Due to a cool kitchen (cold weather) the fudge set up fine without refrigerating it.  Also I put it in a buttered oblong dish and didn't need the foil and it came out fine.  Thanks, Kelly from Susie

This fudge was very creamy and delicious.  I followed other reviewers advice on adding the marshmallow fluff after I removed the pan from the heat and right before I added the chocolate chips.  Also, I used mini chocolate chips.  I made a batch with nuts and without and preferred it without.  Also this recipe worked well for peanut butter fudge by just using peanut butter chips instead of chocolate - however then I recommend a little less sugar.

This was easy to make and the end result was great!  I made it for Christmas and it was a hit.  Everyone raved about it, and I have requests already to make it again.  The only thing I did was used less sugar (1/4 cup less) and it was still perfect flavor and sweetness.  This will definitely be made over and over again.  Thank you for sharing!!

This fudge turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipie exactly. My mom always used to tell me that the key to great fudge is to stir it from the second you put it on the heat until you have added the choclate and nuts. I was especially careful to do that with this recipie to avoid the marshmallow cream from burning. I also started out on low and turned the stove up to medium in small increments. It set nicely after two hours and had a lovely, rich flavor. I will be throwing out my old recipie and replacing it with this one.

I usually follow the recipe on the marshmallow creme, but I also usually end up with grainy fudge. I used this method instead this year and the fudge was amazing. I also followed other people's tip and used 2 cups semi-sweet and 1 cup of the milk chocolate chips. SO GOOD AND CREAMY! My husband took some to work and it was gone long before the other treats there!!! :)

My first attempt at fudge and it was a huge success!  Texture and taste was perfect.  My husband thinks it's too sweet but I think it's perfect. I followed the tip of microwaving the marshmallow creme for 15 sec and starting off on low heat to melt first.  I can't wait to make this again and I'm going to try butterscotch chips.  Thank you so much for the great recipe.  *Update* This doesn't taste as good with the butterscotch chips, it is too sweet.  Stick with the original recipe!

Having never made fudge before, or candy for that matter, this was SUCH an easy recipe! I made it for my Thanksgiving get-together and made it the night before. I was SO worried about the difficulty level and if it would come out OK, they turned out FABULOUS. I decided to go with Ghirardelli chocolates (I personally find the quality to be much smoother and creamier). All in all EVERYONE loved them and it made so much fudge! Creamy, smooth and yummy, the 2 types of chocolate REALLY DO make a difference (and I've eaten a lot of different fudge in my life!!). Great for parties and great to put in gift baskets.

This did not turn out well for me at all.  Everything went fine until I added the chips and then it got dry and crumbly.  Adding the vanilla helped a little, but it didn't "pour" into the pan at all.  I had to press it into the pan and although it set up quickly and was creamy and not grainy, the top was not smooth and it had a ton of grease pooling on top.  I even reduced the amount of butter I used by half as suggested by other reviews, so I don't know why it did that.  After it set I started to cut it and decided that since it looked so bad I would try to salvage it by just rolling it into balls to serve as truffles instead.  I rolled the balls into cinnamon and powdered sugar and even dipped some in white chocolate with toasted chopped pecan sprinkles on top and this saved the whole pan.  The fudge did taste good, but I have used other recipes that don't require a candy thermometer and they have turned out much better than this one.

This is truly an amazing fudge recipe!!  The first batch I made turned out HORRIBLE - But only because my "little helper" (my husband) added the vanilla BEFORE adding the chips when I wasn't looking.  The fudge immediately clumped up and the batch was ruined... (Although still tasty according to him.)  After tossing him out of the kitchen, I proceeded to make another batch and it was indeed flawless!  It's not sickening sweet like many fudges can be... Very creamy, easy to cut and a cinch to remove from the pan.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love this fudge recipe! I tried it with dark chocolate and milk...was real rich. Then I used 1 cup of milk and 2 cups of semi sweet chips and to say this fudge was popular with my family would be an understatement!

YUM!  perfect and creamy!  fantastic!  I think the key is to stir until the cows come home after adding the chocolate chips.

This was the very first time I ever tried to make fudge and talk about well received! Every person who has tried this has said it's the best fudge they've ever had! I substituted dark chocolate chips for the semi-sweet chips and it turned out WONDERFUL! I didn't have any vanilla extract on hand, but it is marvelous just the same. Thank you SO MUCH for such a wonderful recipe!

So easy and quick to make! This fudge was pretty good (not awesome...) and it disappeared soon after it cooled, however, it seemed to taste just as if I were eating the baking chocolate chips. I reversed the amount of semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips because the first time I made it, it was way to sweet. Definitely continue to make this until I find a better recipe. Works great as a gift!***Update: Try the Old-fashioned Chocolate Fudge on this site, a little extra work, but worth it!***

YUM! I always use regular marshmallows in fudge because they are waaay cheaper and not sticky-messy like the creme. I use a kitchen scale to measure out the 7oz or whatever amount)  I used all semi-sweet chips since I prefer dark chocolate.  And I will make this again...in about 5 minutes! One lucky kid got to lick the spoon so I have to do it again to make things even! Thank you for sharing this simply perfect and perfectly simple recipe with the rest of the world.

I made this fudge last Christmas, and everyone who tried it loved it.  I'm always being asked to make it again.  If you follow the directions, this is a completely fool-proof recipe.  I did make one change to the recipe.  I switched the amounts of the semi-sweet chips and the milk chocolate chips. The fudge comes out not too sweet, and you can actually taste the chocolate and it is not super sweet like most fudge is.

This is a good fudge, but not what I was looking for. A bit on the sweet side, but cream added to fudge tastes a lot better than marshmallow creme, which is called for in this recipe.

Not a big fudge fan but wanted something chocolaty, very easy. I used 1/2 pkg large marshmallows instead of creme (did'nt have any) forgot the vanilla, and more milk than semi, and some butterscotch to make 3 c. turned out just just fine.

Very easy, and very yummy! This is the first fudge I've ever made, and everyone who tried it, loved it! Creamy, sweet and fudgy.  Update: 12/08 - I have to update and say that this recipe isn't foolproof. I tried it again this year and it totally broke on me - grainy, disgusting and separated (huge pool of oil). Although it did set, the flavor was definitely not as good and the texture was completely off. I don't know what I did differently than the first time I made it, but beware. It can go wrong.

At the risk of sounding redundant, this fudge is DELICIOUS!!! Since my small can of evaporated milk only contained 5 oz., I added 2 tsp. of heavy cream to bring the liquid up to the required 2/3 cup.  I used Kraft's Jet-Puffed marshmallow creme, as that was all that was available.  Next time I might try adding 1 more tsp. of heavy cream and a bit more nuts.  Do try this--it is decadent!!!

This was the best fudge I have ever tasted.  The first time I made it I messed it up by adding a whole cal of evaporated milk.  I ended up using as a chocolate fondue and served it with bananas, pineapple, graham crackers, marshmallows, and pound cake.  It was amazing! The next time I followed the directions and it was perfect!! I already have a ton of ideas for next CHristmas on how I will make different variations of this.  A Rocky ROad version, maybe broken pretzels into it,  incorporating peanut butter somehow, etc.  Not sure how it will work, I will update my review then I guess.  This was my first time making fudge and I got such rave reviews people thought it was my specialty.  I will hold on to this recipe forever!!

I made it again this year and it was all gone in minutes.  It is amazing!

This fudge is excellent.  I had to make a couple of changes because I was missing some ingredients and it still worked out great.  I didn't have the milk chocolate chips, but I did have some Hershey's kisses so I chopped up one cup of those and added them to 2 cups of Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I kept the sugar ratio the same, and it was a nice amount of sweetness.  I poured part the mixture into mini silicone muffin pans (so easy - just pops right out!) and petit four tins and they look great.  A nice addition to my Christmas repertoire!

Excellent - I accidentally threw in about 1/2 white chocolate chips before I realized it was supposed to be semisweet. It was too late once I realized my error so I continued and finished off the with semisweet... they are still wonderful and creamy.

This was an EXCELLENT fudge recipe!  So much better than the traditional one on the back of the marshmellow fluff jar.  It's very creamy and tastes like fudge you would buy from a fudge store on vacation!

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!  A GIGANTIC hit with everyone!  One of the best batches of fudge I've ever made!  The only suggestion is to put the marshmallow creme (Fluff) after you've started warming the sugar and evaporated milk--it helps with preventing the burning on the bottom of the pan.  Thanks!!

Thanks very much for contributing this fudge recipe. My grandmother used the same recipe and I have wonderful memories watching her make it and licking the bowl afterward. She made the fudge every week for her bridge club during the 1960's. Noone in my family had the recipe. Thanks again. It is delicious and the best!

Made this recipe 3 times in the last week.  Store was out of marshmallow creme, so I substituted mini-marshmallows.  First time I used a whole bag, but then I later found out the equivalent is 2 cups for 1 jar, so I cut down on the next batch.  The 5 minutes was hard for me to go by, so I used the cold water test and cooked to the soft ball stage.  Once I boiled too long and it turned out wayyy too grainy.  Also substituted peanut butter and chocolate chip mixture for the plain chocolate... thought it wasn't chocolatey enough that way.  All in all, a great recipe.

This fudge is very good, and easy to make.  After pouring the fudge into the foil lined pan to cool I ran a spatula under the faucet and smoothed the top of the fudge for a nicer look.  I then  sprinkled nuts on the top and patted them down lightly.

This fudge is the creamiest I have ever had. When I make it and bring it into work, it is gone within minutes. I always get asked this recipe, which I am glad to share. This is the best fudge for the holidays

i have never had luck making fudge... even the nofail kinds failed. This was fabulous. I browned some chopped almonds in butter and added and tastes great. I like my fudge a little thinner so I spreaded it in a bar pan. Now the only prblem is will I eat it all before I can share it?

I'm sorry, after all the rave reviews I thought that this would be fantastic.  It tastes like peanut butter mixed with confectioners sugar.  Yuck.  Will not be making again.

This recipe is great!! This was the first time I ever attempted to make fudge, and it was so easy and tasted so good. It's also quick, which is nice when you are making a lot as gifts for people. Thanks for the recipe!! I am so glad it was the first one I tried.

I have never been asked to bring anything for Thanksgiving until this year as I am notoriously a lousy cook. So, I said I'd bring fudge and then frantically looked for a recipe and found this one. It turned out amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and have a new status around the table...

The first time I ever attempted to make fudge, it was great!  I used chopped macadamia nuts, and even people who don't normally like fudge loved it!  I'm going to make another batch or two for Christmas gifts.  Very easy to make, great recipe I'll definitely keep!

This recipe was awful.  It was too sweet. It didn't firm up and was a loaf of gooey mush, even after I tried freezing to solidify it. I took it to a party, and it was the only thing that nobody ate.  I wanted to try something new, but I'll go back to my traditional fudge recipe and throw this one away.

Awesome! Very easy to make. Tried crushed candycanes on it -- the hint of peppermint with the chocolate was a very good combination. Very sweet, and addictive. :)

For a holiday twist, I put mini candy canes in a ziplock bag and crushed them into small bits with a hammer. Spinkle the candy canes bits on the top of the fudge before it sets and lightly press the candy canes into the fudge.  It looks great at Christmas time and the taste of chocolate and mint is a wonderful combination.

AWESOME!  The BEST fudgey you will EVER have!  It is so simple to make that you feel like you didn't make it right, until you taste it!  I have made this recipe 5 times in the last month because my husband pleads for it!  My neighbors think I am a Fudge Goddess!  If you want attention, make this recipe and give away the fudge!  You may need to open up a fan club for yourself!

I completely messed up this recipe.  I think the interpretation of a full boil is different for each person and I took it as more of a boil than meant.  When I added the chocolate chips, the mixture instantly turned into crumbs that were not workable AT ALL.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  I will go back to the recipe I have that uses a candy therm., that is a tangible thing I can work with.

This is a really easy recipe.  As has been mentioned the total cook time (waiting FOREVER for this stuff to come to a rolling boil on low heat) was more like 30-45 minutes (including the 5 minutes once it reaches boiling point).  I decreased the butter to 2 tbsp, as I was concerned about it becoming greasy and grainy.  The mixture **was** grainy and very oily when I first put it in the pan, so I dabbed the top with paper towels until ithad a smooth, matte appearance, and it turned out EXCELLENT.  Thick , dense and smooooth! Yum!  I used  Ghihardelli chocolate, and macadamia nuts.  This was exquisite! If you have never made fudge before,(and even if you have) this is the recipe for you!

This is a really good recipe, but just so all of you know, It is much much similar to the recipe on the back of the Marshmallow Fluff jar that you buy in the grocery store. When I bought the jar I had seen the recipe on the back and followed it and the fudge came out PERFECT!

The flavor is marvelous. However, judging by some of the other reviews, it would seem that it's my fault that my fudge wasn't as creamy and smooth as I would have liked.It set up good, no oily mess that others talked about, but just not creamy. The top of it lacked the smooth semi-glossy appearance that I expected. It was kind of grainy looking, but didn't taste grainy. I followed the instructions to the letter. Of course, what's the definition of a full rolling boil. Did I start the timing too soon or too late?
Maybe I'll try this again and use a candy thermometer.

This is pretty good.  I am not a fudge connoisseur (other things, but not fudge) - I wanted something else to give for holiday cookie plates that was less labor intensive!  I used toffee chips in place of the nuts as suggested by another reviewer.  The issue for me is that I'm at altitude, and that screws up everything when it comes to boiling and stuff.  I knew I'd have to cook it for more than 5 minutes, and got out my candy therm. to cook it to soft ball stage, but I didn't cook it to that temp as I thought it would be too hard (after doing the cold water test 14 degrees sooner).  Glad I didn't.  Anyway, I made this and butterschotch fudge (virtually the same recipe except for flavor of chips) at the same time.  The butterscotch only called for 2 cups of chips vs 3 - and I liked it better.  Maybe cooking it to 220 degrees with 3 cups of chips was too much - it was a little hard (smooth and creamy, but quite firm).  Plus it's so dry in Colorado that the stuff dries out in a hearbeat.  Anyway, at 5400 feet I had to boil it for 12 minutes (versus 5 in teh recipe) to hit 220.  I will try it again and let you know what I find out.  Hope this helps.

Although this forever stained one of my favorite pots, I love this recipie and will make it again. Had a real hard time finding mashmallow creme in LA - went to 4 grocery stores. But I was so pleased with the results. I didn't use nuts, I used toffee chips in mine, and that worked out great. Will make this again this week for the holiday. Thanks Aunt Teen and Kelly!

This was my first attempt at baking candy and Aunt Teen's recipe turned out AMAZING! The fudge was rich and creamy and took no time at all to whip up. Very easy, this is going to become a holiday tradition in my family (The Jersey Shore comes to Texas Hill Country).

Fabulous recipe.  I had no idea fudge was so simple to make.  I left out the chopped nuts and it still tasted great.  Does anyone know if using semi-sweet or darker chocolate chips will yield the same delicious results?

I made this fudge today and I will admit chocolate lovers will like it but it just tasted too much like melted chocolate chips to me.

I've never made fudge before and made this for a bake sale at my sons school. It was gone in minutes and everyone raved about it! I'm not telling anyone how EASY it is to make. Let them believe I slaved over it!

WOW!!!! This fudge is the BEST!!!! It is SO easy to make and tastes amazing! My family cannot stop eating it! If you are thinking of substituting margarine for the butter...DON'T. I made 2 batches and the one with margarine had separated and was different shades of brown but the one with butter was smooth and creamy!!!!

FIRST TIME I EVER MADE FUDGE. I WAS VERY SURPRISED AT HOW EASY IT WAS AND MY FAMILY JUST LOVED IT. I HAVE A 5 YR. OLD AND I LITERALLY HAD TO KEEP IT OUT OF HIS REACH SO HE WOULDN'T EAT TOO MUCH. THE ONLY CHANGE I WOULD MAKE IS TO ADD 1/4 CUP MORE NUTS TO BLEND OUT THE CHOCOLATE. THANKS SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE.

This is a really good fudge recipe.  I especially like the fact that it is so easy to make and requires no candy thermometer. I followed the recipe as it and it turned out wonderful. I do recommend storing the fudge, after it has cooled, in an air-tight container.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made two batches...the first was perfect and delicious!  The second came out like a giant blob of chocolate-glue!  Oops.  Be careful about the heat at which you melt the butter and fluff etc.  I think that's what went wrong with batch #2.

My first time making fudge and I discovered it kind of scary when I dumped the chips into the heated mixture which become an instant blob; however,I kept stirring frantically and the mixture eventually smoothed out. I couldn't find the marshmallow creme in the store so I just melted marshmallows in the microwave and added one cup to the mixture. 
 My first batch produced the tastiest,smoothiest texture even with all this issues and I thought the sweetest was just right, but I didn't dump in all the sugar anyway. I am going to make 2 more batches tomorrow. Thank you so much for sharing! I have to lock the frig to keep everyone away!

Fantabulous!!!  The best fudge I have ever eaten.  I do change one ingredient, however.  In order to cut down on the fat, instead of butter or margarine, I use Smuckers Healthy Baking, a butter substitute consisting of apple puree, which can be purchased at any supermarket in the oil section.  Adds no flavor!  My friends really entjoy this fudge, both for the flavor and for the fact that is lower in fat than other fudge.

I just wanted to say that this recipe is great!  I decided I was going to make fudge, and wanted to look for a new recipe, and I found this.  It is very quick and easy (once I decided that white sugar was regular granulated sugar and not powdered sugar)  :), and the fudge tastes great.  Thanks so much for posting it!

I am a horrible cook.  I try and fail.  But when I tried Aunt Teen's fudge recipe it came out as perfection!!  I now have requests from all my coworkers to make it again.  They said it was the best fudge they've ever had. One of the girls who doesn't really like fudge tried it and said it was so good that it tasted just like a hershey's chocolate bar.  I will make this all the time!!

This recipe is truly "idiot-proof".  I made 2 batches for Christmas and I was afraid it was too much, but it didn't last long at all.  Now my father-in-law is my new best friend! The milk chocolate adds a wonderful creaminess to it.

Aunt Teen is the god-dess of fudge!  I had an urgent special request for fudge and no CLUE how to make it-I was afraid it would be hard to make.  But this recipe was delightfully simple, fun, and the fudge itself was WICKEDly good!  Thank you for posting this one, Kelly!

I made a batch of this in the past and at that time I thought it was good, but I forgot to review. 
This time around I made some changes, as my sweet tooth has changed. I guess old age does that?
The changes I made: Only used 1 cup sugar instead of  1 1/2 cup and added 1 cup frozen little marshmallows at the very end before folding into the prepped pan.  I have been looking for a Rocky road fudge & couldn’t find one that suited me. So I altered this recipe as I knew I had liked it before altering it. 

These changes did not alter the texture, its creamy & melts in your mouth.

Mom used to make the recipe off the Marshmellow Cream jar back in the '70's. For this recipe, I used a 12 oz. bag of semi sweet chocolate chips, 3/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of Stevia blend.  Turned out great!

I make fudge every Christmas and I tried this recipe this year. It turned out wonderfully. I will be making this recipe from now on. I send fudge in my Christmas cookie boxes so I make a lot. I doubled the recipe and used a 12x9 pan. Same cooking time. I used all name brand ingredients. No generics. Not sure if this makes a difference but with something like fudge I do. Wow a beautiful pan of fudge. I also used 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips. This fudge is so creamy and perfect. Not gritty and didn't break apart while cutting. It cut very nicely and I didn't have to waste a square of it. Thank you Aunt Teen. This is my new recipe.

This is my first attempt at making fudge. I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the directions exactly. I added toasted almonds and the result was a heavenly semi-firm fudge. The toasted almonds really added to the flavor of the chocolate. I used store brand everything! The second time I made it I only used 1 tablespoon butter as recommended by others. I think I may have cooked the sugar mixture at a little lower temperature and for a minute or so longer than the first time. The result was a less firm but deliciously creamy fudge. Both times we loved it and so did the friends we shared it with.

I used 2 C semi-sweet and 1 C special dark chips, as I prefer a less sweet chocolate and I upped the salt to 1 tsp.  I did heat the marshmallow cream for 30 seconds to make it easier to get out of the tub. A batch perfectly fits a 7.5x11.5x.5" disposable pan that I lined with plastic wrap so that I could wrap the ends back over the fudge to prevent drying out.  Next batch I am going to use some dark chocolate/raspberry chips... then maybe a white chocolate/peppermint chip...

Be sure to bring to full boil for the 5 mins, stirring constantly (I used a silicone whisk) to make sure the sugar is dissolved and you do not get a grainy candy.

My first try netted  a clumpy oily mess. I added the chips 1/3 at a time as one reviewer suggested however it still cooled too quickly. My second try I did not remove the pan from heat I just turned off the burner and left the pan on the stove. It worked as I was able to mix everything and was still able to "pour" the mixture.

I made this for a Christmas get together a couple of weeks ago and we all loved it! I have made it 3 more times since then for every gathering we've had, can't go wrong with this. I've followed the directions exactly except a few people mentioned boiling for 6-7 min instead of 5, so I did that and its turned out great every time! Also this was my first time ever making fudge! Feeling like a pro at it now!

This Fudge is to hard to make and did not turn out that creamy. The users that suggested adding the Marshmallow Cream last may have it right. I watch after the fact some video's, they did not boil with the Marshmallow cream it was added, after. It's not bad fudge, it's not creamy. More candy like.

I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a rock hard lump of brown stuff that crumbled when I tried to cut it.  I have no idea what went wrong.   : (.

I made this recipe the first time without reading any reviews and got grainy crumbly greasy fudge. Then I read some reviews. So I tried it again. I made sure the marshmallow mixture was at a full boil for 5 min and that I had the chips ready to mix in right away. I was starting to get a similar result. Then it occurred to me that chocolate can behave like this when it gets too hot so I poured it into a cool bowl. It seems better, but not creamy like the recipe says. It's still chilling so I can't comment yet on the finished product. A little disappointed!

My first time making homemade fudge! 
Looks great and my family loves them. I'm not much of a fudge lover but this recipe was soooo easy. Remember start heating up slowly, stirring constantly. You can play with heating it medium to medium low .  Stove tops vary so start out medium low so you don't overheat and burn it. Great and easy recipe. Thank you so much Kelly for sharing your wonderful recipe!

I think this is the best fudge I've ever tasted, and not just because I made it! ?? It was my first attempt ever at making fudge, and I followed the recipe to the letter, without any candy thermometer, and it came out perfect. I used chopped unsalted peanuts because I really don't care for walnuts. I really didn't even time the boiling, as you can tell when it's ready to add chocolate when the mix turns a slight yellowish colour whilst boiling. Thank you Kelly!

I made this for Christmas and was very worried because I have never made fudge before and my mother in law is very picky when it comes to fudge. I followed what other reviewers said and waited until it started to bubble and then let it boil for 6 minutes stirring constantly. It turned out great! My mother in law ended up eating all of it throughout her stay with us! It was so easy that I will definitely be making it again!

Yummy and delicious fudge! I ended up making quite a few batches of this to give away as Christmas presents. I paired mine with the saltine toffee cookies also found on this site. I followed the recipe to the T. No complaints at all! In fact I got rave reviews!

Yum Yum.  Just like the fudge my mom used to make.  I added vanilla snowman marshmallows on top to make Rocky Road fudge just after spreading it in the pan.  It turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

tried this recipe tonight, swapped for a whole bar of unsweetened bakers chocolate and a whole bag of ghiridelli milk chocolate chips and WOW. Greatest fudge ever. At first I thought I burned the marshmallow mixture but it turned out absolutely amazing! the swap for the unsweetened and milk made it absolutely perfect!

This is the first and only fudge recipe I've ever used and have never had a need to try another. This one works perfectly! Despite other people who have suggestions to use only name-brand items and time things carefully, I can assure you that I have always done the recipe "off-the-cuff" so to speak, and it always turns out a winner. Easy enough that I made it when I was still in high school and relatively new to the cooking/baking game and timeless that I'm still making it by this recipe into my 20s. God forbid All Recipes goes down and I can't find this recipe again with a Google search. Can't wait to make it again this week.

I have made this fudge many times and it turns out creamy smooth and wonderful.  The only thing I do differently is that I cook for a full 7 minutes instead of the 5.  My family and friends request this fudge every holiday season.

I am neither a successful nor experienced candy maker, but this fudge turned out wonderfully. It's easy to prepare (watch the video for helpful tips) and is creamy and delicious. If I can make it work, anyone can!

I have been making the fudge from the back of the marshmallow cream jar for years and always thought it was the best, but decided to make Aunt Teens fudge because of all the good reviews.  Although similar, from the recipe on the jar you put the marshmallow cream in last and Aunt Teen's recipe you put the marshmallow cream in the beginning and let it cook.  Do it her way.  This year, I made my old standby from the back of the marshmallow jar,  and then I made fudge by following Aunt Teen's recipe exactly and it came out great, except was a little soft so I made it once more, this time I let it boil 6 minutes stirring constantly and at the end added marshmallows to make a rocky road fudge and it was the BEST!  It was a little harder to spread in the pan and you do have to work fast, have everything ready to throw in.  At our family gathering the rocky road fudge was the first to go, followed by the other aunt teen recipe fudge.  I still have some of the fudge I made following the recipe from the back of the jar.  You can't go wrong following this recipe.  Putting the marshmallow cream in the beginning and letting it cook for about 6 min will make all the difference. I kept the fudge out on the table and unlike the fudge from the recipe on the jar,  the rocky road fudge did not soften.  Everybody loved it. Do Not put the marshmallow cream in last, believe me it makes a huge difference.  It tastes like the type you would buy at a state fair.  So Good!

I ended up with greasy, crumbly fudge. This may be because I didn't read the reviews before buying for this recipe and got a store brand marshmallow cream. It may also be because I was cooking with gas or doubled the recipe. Basically, what i have is inedible.

I did as the top reviews suggested: I had everything out and ready to go so I could work fast. I added 1/4 cup less sugar (I may try half cup less next time), added the fluff in to the pan LAST (microwaved it for 15 seconds first so it was easy to extract from the bottle) and I did not scrape every bit out - I avoided the bottom of the pan as I was afraid of crystallized sugar where the heat was highest. It turned out lovely, creamy and sweet.  Don't omit the salt, it brings out the flavor and helps to temper the sweetness. PS: I cut it when it was very cold, using a cold knife that I kept cleaning with cold water so the squares cut beautifully!

This was good and I got lots of compliments on it, but doesn't taste as rich or creamy as fudge you'd get from a fudge shop.  But it's still delicious nonetheless!  I added some chopped and dried maraschino cherries which was a delicious addition!

Very easy to make, and with very little effort this fudge turned out really well! I followed some of the other reviews and used about 1/8 cup (about half) of butter, and I switched the milk chocolate with the semi-sweet. It was really delicious. It's not fudge as I knew it, but it was still really good, a little chewy which was fine and wasn't over powering-ly sweet. I served it at a family dinner, very popular!! :) Definitely give it a try!

So good and easy too my four year old "helped" me make this and it still turned out great. It set much faster then the recpie stated, but it could be because i did not have a 8x8 pan i used a 9x9. I think i prefcer the 9x9 thickness.

If satin were edible, it would be like this! This fudge is delicious! As other reviewers said, you have to work quickly! Measure out everything you'll need before you start throwing things into your pot. When the recipe says stir constantly, they mean it! While I was waiting for the mixture to start boiling, I didn't see any bubbles on the surface. I didn't realize that the sugar on the bottom of the pan was cooking away underneath. So even if it looks like it's not boiling, stir your sugary-buttery-marshmallowy goodness to prevent burning. Add the chocolate and vanilla quickly and pour immediately into a pan, as this starts cooling and hardening right away. This made plenty for my holiday cookie tins! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this fudge for Thanksgiving--it was the first time I'd ever made fudge, and it turned out great!  Does anyone know why fudge recipes always have you add vanilla at the end? This recipe turns out better if you use really good chocolate chips; try something other than Nestle if you can afford it.

I have never made fudge before. I took some of the most common suggestions and it was the bomb! It was perfect. I doubled the recipe, but only 1/4 c. of REAL BUTTER for the whole amount. I used one 12 oz can of evap milk less 1/4 cup, 3-12 oz bags of chocolate chips (used 2 milk and 1 semi sweet)made sure I started on low heat and stirred CONSTANTLY. I waited until it was bubbling with small bubbles rather than the beginning big bubbles before I started timing my 5 minutes. It worked perfectly for 2-8 X 8 pans.

I made this for the first time today and it will be a challenge to have a piece now and then as I have a sweet tooth, big time. When it comes to self control it just seems to go out the window.

Awesome recipe and easy to use (This was my second time ever making fudge...) Also easy to change up. I swapped the chocolate chips for Andy mints chips because my fiance wanted chocolate mint. I also dropped the butter down to 1 tablespoon as recommended by other reviews. Next attempt will include swapping the chips to vanilla and the extract to maple :D

First time fudge maker, so happy to say it was a success!  I did cut butter to 1 Tbs as others had suggested.  I used 2 C of semi-sweet chips, and 1 C of peanut butter chips because I belive that peanut butter makes anything better.  Chips were store brand, as well as the evaporated milk, and they didn't give me any problems, but I did stick with the Jet puffed marshmallow.  Boiled for 6.5 minutes on medium low, and my fudge turned out firm but not crumbly.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions!

I love this basic recipe, but I use a couple of tweaks on it: double the recipe but nix the nuts, use a half cup less sugar and a handful more chocolate chips, then fully stir in at least 3/4 c. peanut butter. This is how I make my mother's favorite fudge from her childhood, just like my grandma made! Also, have everything measured out in advance, including a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil and very lightly sprayed with canola oil. After you pour the fudge onto the tray, cover it in plastic wrap and run over that with a rolling pin for a smoother presentation. Be sure to remove the plastic wrap while it cools.

Update: I use unsalted butter, so I add a bit of salt to this (it seems to me to need it),  and still add peanut butter in place of the nuts and using less sugar than called for, otherwise it comes out far too sweet. This time, I had no marshmallow fluff on hand, so I put big roaster marshmallows into our food processor with the evaporated milk until it measured enough for the marshmallow as called for, and it worked fine. 

This deserves the five stars for being inspirational for what comes out to be perfect fudge, and apologies for these changes, but I have to tweak it for it to not to go to waste in our house. The method described here for making is fairly spot-on, except for the thought of moisture in the air that can mess with fudge cooking time, much like cheesecake works.

Finally, parchment paper works fantastic for the rolling method!

Great fudge recipe, it is now my holiday staple.  I also use it as my PEPPERMINT fudge, but adding peppermint extract (1 teasp. and then putting andes peppermint chocolate on the top!)  Winner either way!

This is the best fudge ever. Whenever I make it for anyone they  love it and sometime I'm asked for the recipe. The secret in making my Aunt Teen's Creamy Fudge even better is to use Ghirardelli chocolate chips.

Pretty good, however I followed the instruction of fellow raters and boiled for 7 minutes and it wound up WAY too dry and crumbly, so if I make it again, I will be sticking to the 5 minutes in the recipe.  I was incredibly disappointed that it didn't turn out purely because of the cost of a jar of fluff that I wasted. Having said that, I will give another try down the road.

This is the fudge my mom made when I was a kid. 
She used Marshmallow Fluff for many things including with peanut butter in sandwiches. I agree with the cautionary note to use the real stuff and not a store brand. It's wonderful!

I have made this recipe exactly as written about half a dozen times in the last year! Always a hit! I let the mixture boil for a full 5-7 minutes and never stop stirring so it doesn't burn at the bottom. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS FUDGE!

This recipe was so good.  I left out the nuts because I didn't have any and I forgot to put the vanilla in somehow.. It still turned out perfect.  I think I will leave the vanilla out next time, and there will definitely be a next time, because it wasn't needed the first go around.  A great fudge recipe.

This fudge is AMAZING. It was easy to make, tastes delicious and doesn't take long at all!
I did, however, make a few changes.
I used all milk chocolate since I'm not a fan of semi-sweet or that "dark chocolate" taste. I also boiled for 7 minutes and started my timer when I got my first few rolling bubbles on the side on medium-low (more on the low side, figuring low & slow is best).
The only reason I knocked off a star was because it definitely doesnt taste like traditional fudge, but more of, well, if I had grabbed a handful of milk chips right out of the bag! (which isnt bad either).
This definitely did the trick for my midnight chocolate fix, so bravo for that!

**i did microwave the mallow cream just a bit (12-15sec) to make it easier to get out of that jar. I also might add either white chocolate or peanut butter next time so I dont feel like I'm just eating chocolate chips.

DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

First time I've ever made fudge; this was an awesome recipe! I was shocked at how easy it was to make. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the texture - it was a little to creamy for my liking. It was still awesome though.

Had a difficult time getting all of the chocolate to melt into the mixture.  I ended up leaving some of the chips unmelted because the mixture was beginning to separate.  It set, but did not have a nice smooth top as I'd hoped for.  It did turn out tasty and I couldn't find any remnants of the chips when I cut into it.

Just made this fudge as Xmas gifts for my family, it turned out PERFECT. Best fudge I have ever had! I went ahead and cooked for six minutes like other reviewers suggested. I decided to add some variety by topping one batch with Heath bits and the other with peanut butter. I am in LOVE with this recipe, super easy and delicious!

This fudge is fantastic!! I have never made fudge and I didn't know it was this easy. The only thing I did different was instead 2 cups milk chocolate chips, I did 1 cup milk chocolate and 1 cup butterscotch chips. This stuff is delicious.

the first time i made this recipe it turned out great, i must have had beginners luck because now i cant figure out what i am doing wrong, i have read the reviews and have tried everything it keeps coming out really oily, i have a thermom and make sure it gets to 234 before i remove from heat, ive tried adding the marshmallow creme after, still doesnt come out right

I loved this fudge! the only problem I had was that, after it was set, it was really gooey. had to be kept cold or else you had to eat with a spoon. I'm not sure I did, but I would have like it a bit firmer. Tasted great though!

I have made fudge numerous times in the past and this is the first fudge recipe I have tried that has not turned out. I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I did differently was use a candy thermometer to soft boil instead of timing it. The fudge turned out greasy and disgusting and the whole lot went right into the trash.

Oh why oh why did I test out the recipe before making it for 6 mini loaf pans for Christmas gifts next weekend??? My family is stuck with an 8 x 8 pan of fudging goodness - I have to give some away because we are powerless to the strong urges we are having to sneak into the fridge for 'just a taste'....this is the best. Fudge. Evah!!!!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!!! We used Nestles - I wonder in Ghiradelli or Hershey's would taste even better??

Excellent!  I followed the directions to the letter (without nuts) and it came out perfect!  Surprisingly it was not as sweet as I anticipated - still plenty sweet though.  The medium-low heat is certainly the trick.  It took longer than 5 minutes - I eventually got out the candy thermometer - but the results are worth it!

Delicious and creamy fudge, i followed the instructions and it turned out beautifully. The one thing i changed is that i didn't add in the nuts, simply because my husband prefers any candy without them. I will make this again!

Great, easy recipe that will turn out some delicious fudge, but I'm still on the hunt for a "to die for" recipe. To me, this tastes like that really great fudge that your friend made and brought to a party, but NOT that "to die for" fudge you had at the Boardwalk/Shore/Apple Hill/local treat shop. Might make again. but not if I can find something better. Will look for a recipe that doesn't use the marshmallow cream and see if I can make the "real" stuff and get the texture right.

SUPERB!!!  I follow the directions exactly minus the fact that I used all 60-63% cacao dark chocolate (Guittard and Ghirardelli) instead of the semisweet and milk chocolate.  It will be my go to fudge recipe!! Thanks!!

This recipe is to die for. I tried chocolate and I reworked it to make peanut butter fudge. Just subbed all 3 cups of chocolate chips for 2 cups of peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter. I left the vanilla and the amount the same. It was amazing. I'll be making this recipe every year now.

I have tried this recipe twice and was SO disappointed with this fudge!  I knew there was a problem when I poured it into the pan and grease started pooling on top of it.  After it cooled it was crumbly and hard.  I used a candy thermometer and tried to get the temperature to 234, which is standard for fudge, but it takes WELL over 5 minutes.  After 2 failed attempts, I went back to the recipe on the back of the marshmallow fluff jar just to prove that I CAN make fudge and it was as creamy as ever!  Although the texture was terrible, the taste of this fudge was very good...not SUPER sweet and a nice blend between milk and semi-sweet choc.  Unfortunately, I'm throwing in the towel on this one!

This recipe turned out perfect! I did one batch with nuts and another substituted about 1 cup of mint chips for the milk chocolate chips. Both came out wonderful. I started counting the 5 minutes of boiling as soon as I saw the first bubbles coming up to the surface and the fudge turned out great, not too hard, not too soft. Mine took a bit longer than 2 hours to set. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy recipe, but I thought the final product was a bit crumbly.  It was edible, but not the best fudge I've ever tasted.  Will definitely keep searching for that "perfect" fudge recipe.

This fudge came together quick and easy.  I did find the flavor improved to a true fudge flavor after three to four days!  Next time I will make it the week before I need it.

My first time making fudge. I made it with milk chocolate chips and after it was in the pan it looked blah so I melted some white chips with marshmallow fluff and put in a swirl. It looked nice. I ate a couple pieces last night, it's very rich. My boyfriend took it to work this morning and it was gone really fast. Already have requests for the recipe and they said it was the creamiest fudge they'd ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

wonderful!! i've tried many other fudge recipes and this came out perfectly...i did increase the boil time to 6 1/2 min and did vice versa on the morsels b/c i like darker fudge but otherwise i followed exactly and it's so creamy, not at all grainy...BEAUTIFUL RECIPE!!!

This was my first time making fudge - And this recipe turned out beautifully.  I made one batch chocolate and one that I added shredded coconut to.  I do not have a candy thermometer but to make sure I cooked it long enough I time about 7 minutes from when it started boiling and I was stirring it the entire time.  The boiling marshmallow and sugar mix started to turn a golden color and thats about when I removed the pan from the heat and quickly stirred in the chocolate chips.  Creamy, rich and delicious!

Recipe was easy yes, and it turned out for me....but I just didn't like this fudge at all. It just didn't seem like "normal" fudge to me...not the melt in your mouth taste of home made fudge.  It seemed too dense and heavy or something, kind of like store-bought icing in a jar, but more solid & set.  I much prefer fudge made with icing sugar. This was my first fudge made with marshmellow creme, so maybe that was the part that ruined the flavour for me.  I was very disappointed with it and will not make again.

I don't have much experience making fudge, but this receipe was very easy and the results were great.  Very smooth and creamy.  I think the trick is to keep the heat low, cook slowly and stir constantly.  Will definetly keep this recipe!

I have to say, this fudge is fantastic. I give quite a lot of candy gifts at Christmas and try different kinds of fudge. I have tried this one before, but thought I would go ahead and rate it. There is no reason to change anything in the recipe, unless you omit the nuts, other than that, it is great. For those who were not successful with this recipe, you have to have a lot of patience when making fudge, if it was crumbly, you overcooked it.

This was a flop. I don't fail at too many recipes and I take reviewers opinions to heart. I followed everyone's advice but this came out greasy, although it smelled delicious. Oh well. Maybe I'm just not a candy maker.

Nice a creamy. I cooked for 6 minutes but I think it would have been just as firm at 5 minutes. Added walnuts and raisins so I am sure it made it a healthy treat, right :).

Easy to make.  I made for Thanksgiving and my brother and nephew are still talking about how good it is.  I took others advice and cooked for 6 minutes. Let sit at room temperature before cutting, otherwise it's really hard to cut.

I did take the advice of others and boiled it for 6 1/2min. turned out great both times I've made it. I also used all 3 cups of the milk chocolate chips,,mmmm even better.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is good fudge. Mine was greasy. The butter came to the top and I couldn't work it in. That is the reason for 4 stars instead of five. Even with that it is still worth making. I will definitely keep working on it until it turns out perfect...why?? Because it is GOOD!! Use the suggestions of having all ingredients measured before hand. I also use Guittard chocolate chips. They are yummy and creamy before the fudge. I think the brand you use makes a difference on the fudge. 1 other suggestion...make it in two pans....hurry and freeze one for later or you will eat it all.

Yummmmy!!! I made this just like the recipe except I only used 1 cup of sugar and it was perfect for my taste.... I put in the frig for several hours before I cut into squares.  I shared with friends who said it was the best fudge they had ever eaten!! That's quite a compliment for the first time I've ever tried to make fudge!

This is the best fudge I have ever had, hands down! I usually don't even like fudge that much, but I could eat this whole pan. It tastes very milk chocolate-y, almost like eating a chewy Hershey's bar. If you want it more subtle, I would say add more semi-sweet chips and less milk choc chips, although I love it the way it is. Anyone that says this isn't a good recipe must have had a problem. I followed the recipe except used 1 tbspoon less butter, as I read in reviews. I also mixed the cream mixture before heating. My stove must be different, it took forever to boil, I had to put it a little over medium. It turned out perfect! I will absolutely use this again! Thanks for the recipe!

This fudge is the easiest I fudge I've ever made.  I have made 5 or 6 batches.  I wish I could say it was all for the holidays but a lot of it never made it out the door.  I almost wish I had never run across this one.  I received so many compliments.  Thank you Kelly for sharing!!

My family went nuts over this recipe! I followed the recipe as stated but made a few minor adjustments. I stirred the marshmallow mixture on a low heat from the very beginning until the very end and it came out to be a total of 18 minutes (11 minutes until it boiled and 7 minutes while it was boiling). This was my first time making fudge and I'm positive it will not be my last.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and I did not care for it. The fudge was crumbly and dry immediately after making it and the next day it was so dry. (I've made many different fudge recipes so I'm not new to this - and this was my first fudge disaster.)

So this was my first time making fudge. I love creamy fudge. I don't like nuts and that is what everybody always puts in fudge so I decided to try my hand in it to make it without nuts. After reading some of the reviews and working with what I had, I ended up cooking it like this... I used store brand marshmellow cream and made sure not to put it on the bottom of the pan so it wouldn't scorch. I was sure to use a heavy bottom pot aswell. Since I didn't have any milk chocolate chips I used a 12 oz. bag of milk chocolate hershey kisses. I also have a gas stove and cooked it on low to med. heat. I like thin fudge so poured it on a 9x13 with no/low sides. My husband loves it and he doesn't even like fudge! Turned out AWESOME and will make it again for sure! Thanks for a great base recipe!

This is a super easy and great fudge recipe.  I used all semisweet chocolate chips and I thought it turned out fantastic!  I will definitely use this as my go-to fudge recipe.

I used 2 cups 60% ghirardelli chocolate chips and 1 cup semisweet chips to tone down the sweetness that fudge normally has. Yum!

I read a lot of the reviews on this recipe before making it.  I was a bit concerned about my pans as I use LeCreuset cast iron pans and one reviewer said not to use them.  However, let me tell you how amazing this fudge was.  First of all, my husband absolutely devoured it and ordered me to make a second batch for him to take to work.  The batch I took to work for our Christmas party was the ONLY one completely eaten up, and I even had ten requests for the recipe!  I've made several variations of this recipe, including one with no nuts, one that was 3/4 chocolate and 1/4 white chocolate on top, and each and every time, it's a smashing success!  This is now my standard recipe.  LOVE it!

I made this recipe for the first time this year and it will now be my new fudge recipe. I usually made the Fool-proof fudge by Eagle brand only for it's simplicity. This one is creamier, smoother, and just plain tastes better. It's more time consuming than the easier one but it's not difficult by any means. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This was my first time making fudge. I did read some reviews and cut down on the sugar to about 1 1/4. I also used an even amount of milk/semi-sweet choc. chips...1 1/2 cups each. Everything else I did according to the recipe. I stirred slowly and frequentley while waiting for it to boil (over med. heat) and then once it came to a boil, I set the timer for 5 minutes. I did use a 9X13 pan b/c I didn't want super thick fudge.It came out perfectly and I didn't have any problems with crumbling or frosting-like fudge that some people have mentioned. Very good! I gave it 4 stars only b/c I did make a couple changes from the original recipe.

I had high hopes after seeing all the photos, but it flopped for me. Don't know if I did something wrong, but it came out crumbly and greasy.  Like some others it stiffened immediately with adding the chocolate chips.  I tasted it and was disappointed, could only taste the marshmallow.  Will stick to making fudge the old fashioned way.

This is a great fudge recipe.  For a little kick, soak the nuts in bourbon or rum for a few hours before adding to the fudge to make a bourbon-nut fudge!  My family and friends LOVED it!

This fudge recipe is fantastic and not too difficult. Just make sure you have everything ready and are fast when adding the chocolate and add-ins. I made a butterscotch pecan variety that came out awesome! The basic recipe is also fantastic. I also tried White Chocolate Chips and added Candied Cherries, it looks very festive and is delicious as well.

I was so excited to try this fudge, but I just threw away 2 bags of chocolate chips, evaporated milk, sugar...So disappointed. I followed the recipe, and even read through a ton of reviews to avoid any issues. Since I don't have a candy thermometer, I cooked it for 7 min instead of 5, stirring constantly, removed from heat and added the chocolate chips and what I got was an instant hard crumbly mess. I could't even stir it to incorporate the chips. I would honestly be too afraid to waste my time on this recipe again...

I made this fudge for my husband to take into work the other day and all 20 men loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little more chopped walnuts. It disappeared in minutes. They all said that it was the best fudge ever, even better than their grandmothers. I don't know about that but it was very good. I will make this every year for my husband along with the Peanut Butter Fudge IV by Myra. The men all love that also and both recipes are so easy and quick to make. For the peanut butter fudge I use Chunky Peanut Butter. Everytone LOVES it.

This recipe was so easy to make.  After it came to a boil, I continued to cook it on medium-low heat for a full 7 minutes, constantly stirring it.  I had everything measured beforehand so everything came together very easily. I used 2 cups semi-sweet and 1 cup milk chocolate. I also decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup. It was very creamy and such a breeze to cut after it was refrigerated for 2 hrs.  I don't like fudge. Fudge is usually too rich for my taste. But my husband loves fudge and he said super good and gave it 5 stars.

Hmm, I hate to leave any kind of negative review because most people seemed to have raving success with this fudge recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and mine didn't turn out that great.  It was crumbly and not very creamy.  Overcooking maybe?  I'm not new to candy making and I've never had too much of a problem before.  I'm going to be trying it again, but the reason I gave it 4 stars is I'm not the only person who has followed the recipe to a T and still not had it turn out.  It seems a bit tempermental.

So, I was a bit nervous about making this after reading do many conflicting reviews! I prepared my kids that I would be focused and stirring for awhile, so let me be! I made this recipe as listed other than reducing the butter to 1 tsp. Everything else I left exactly as written. I no longer have a candy thermometer, and since I tend to be an undercooker, I got an idea of the temp. with my meat thermometer. Once I knew the temp. was up to 200 degrees, I stirred another minute and everything came out perfect! I suggest not changing anything, just try it and then tweak it if need be. I honestly think it i perfect the way it is! Thanks for sharing. And, fudge is supposed to be sweet, that's why you cut in small pieces for serving!

WOW! This is so rich, just like fudge should be. I bought the brand name marshmallow creme and had all my ingridients ready to go as previously suggested. I did not add nuts because I do not care for them and it turned out wonderful.

I made this yesterday for my son's Christmas party at school, as soon as I got in the door of the classroom, one girl looked at them and said: 'Oh, those look so good!' indeed they are, my mother wouldn't quit taste testing them for me so I said, 'I'll  make you more this afternoon!' and I am. My only critical saying would be that you could add more nuts to the recipe. Everything else is JUST fine.

I don't make a lot of fudge but know we don't like sugary fudge.  This is great; very smooth and I used mostly special dark morsels. It is a hit at our house.  Thanks.

Excellent recipe, I've used this one for several years now at Christmas time. Mine always set up perfectly using the directions as written and I wouldn't modify that. I double the amount of nuts and that's the only change I make. Delicious!

I followed the directions exactly and it still came out greasy and  not creamy at all. I must have messed up something along the way. I will not be making this again because it is just way too sweet. It doesn't taste like fudge at all, it tastes like chocolate chunks.

Kind of hard, but I tasted a piece out of the fridge.  It should be softer and more fudge-like at room temp.  The only change I made was I half-n-halfed the chocolate chips.
Came back to give it the extra star, was perfect at room temp and the first thing everyone ate in my Christmas goodie tins.  One coworker asked me if she gave me back her tin if I would fill it with this fudge.

Big gloppy mess!  I have made fudge for years!  I couldn't find the recipe I usually use and tried this one.  Big pot of burned mess!  I will keep looking.

Made this last night for Christmas gifts.  I used "The Perfect Brownie Pan" (as seen on TV) so that all the pieces would be the same size.  It came out beautiful!  I let my husband & kids try a sample and they all agreed it was fabulous!  I wrapped each individual piece in wax paper and then re-wrapped in foil then put into a container & placed it in the freezer.  I hope it'll still be creamy by Christmas!

This was my first time making fudge and this recipe helped make it a complete success!  You do have to be very attentive to the temperature starting low and increasing slowly as I can see how it can scorch easily and also be sure to keep stirring.  I started out with a regular pot and moved it quickly into a teflon coated non-stick one and this helped eliminate the chance of burning.  Also it poured nicely into the pan without any chocolate left stuck to the bottom.

yum. i think i will upgrade to ghiradelli or cadburys next time - the comments about waiting for the rolling boil and 6 minuets at boiling point made all the difference between batch 1 and batch 2.

I altered it a bit by having equal parts milk chocolate, semi-sweet, and butterscotch chips.  It was only my second time making fudge, but it turned out delicious and perfect!  I took some to work, and it was gone by lunch!  It was very easy, and I highly recommend it for that and how good it tastes. :)

Wow, this is rich!!! :)  My kids love it.  It was very easy, if you consider a lot of stirring easy.  I haven't made fudge in over 10 years and mine turned out great.  The only change I made was to use a cookie sheet instead of an 8 x 8 pan.

Amazing Fudge! I made this twice and both came out delicious. The first time I just did chocolate (skipped the nut's cause we dont like them) and the second time I did the same thing, but added a big spoonful of peanut butter! So good, loved this recipie, will be using it from now on.   SUPER CREAMY!

This recipe was SUPER easy but I must say that it's just too sweet for my taste.  I think if I made this again, I would use less milk chocolate and more semisweet to make it a little less sweeter.

I have never been  able to make good fudge, this recipe came out perfect. My advice is to take your time. Start cooking on low. Then when everything is melted and mixed, I turned the heat to med. It took awhile for it to get to boiling. It was a gentle boil and not a rolling boil. Also i used another reviewers advice and used ghirardelli chocolate. This does come out a milk chocolate fudge. I would recommend using more semi-sweet if you want it to be more bittersweet.

I could not pour this into the pan - it was way too thick!  I had to press it into the pan.  I used less butter like others suggested, but it still was oily on top.  The texture isn't what I'd call creamy.  It's kind of crumbly.  Maybe I shouldn't have used a candy thermometer, because after 5 minutes, it was only at 225 degrees, so I boiled it for an additional minute.  It still wasn't up to temperature, but I was afraid to overcook it.  Maybe I still did??  I used 1 1/2 cups each milk and semisweet chips and it is incredibly sweet.  I should have followed others' suggestions and cut back on the sugar.  I tried spreading peanut butter on a piece to see if that would cut back on the sweetness, and it sort of does.  Does anyone know if the texture is better at room temperature?  By the way, I agree with the other reviewer that said they are more like intense chocolate squares rather than fudge.  Not sure if I'll try this again.  I also made the creamy peanut butter fudge.  I hope that one turns out better.

Super Easy. Use candy thermometer!!!! Everyone loved it. I started with one batch and ended up making 5 (over christmas holidays)!!! I suggest using ghirardelli chocolate chips!! This is going to become a family tradition recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I read alot of reviews before atempting this and I used all name brand products. This fudge turned out so creamy and delicious. We added a thin layer of peanut butter on top after it cooled and then put reeses peanut butter chips on top of that! Awesome! Will def be making again.

YUM! Would've given it 5 stars except that I followed another reviewer's suggestion and reduced the sweetness (used only 1 cup sugar, and switched to 1.5 cups each of semi-sweet and milk), and I think it would've been too sweet otherwise. But this was my first time making fudge and it was SO EASY and it came out perfect. Great recipe!

My friends and Family loved this fudge. They hated me for making it but, they loved the fudge. It was very easy to make. I left out the chopped nuts and I accidentally put in 1 more cup semisweet chocolate than was recommended. My mother told me to make the same mistake again the next time I make it.

I was missing a few ingredients, but they still turned out great! I replaced the marshmallow creme with a bag of marshmallows (minus a few) and the evaporated milk with plain 1% milk.  They set up super quickly, and taste great! Not really 'fudgy', more just intense chocolate squares, but that's probably because of my modifications.  I liked this recipe, and will try again with actual ingredients to see if they turn out more like fudge.

I was always scared to make fudge... I guess I was under the impression it was difficult. This was SO easy to make and came out absolutley fabulous! I followed the recipe just as stated and it was chocolatey, creamy and delicious! This will be a staple recipe for us during the holidays! My husband couldn't believe how good it was! I let him think I slaved over the stove to make it! LOL!

This was really good fudge. I made it at Christmas time for gifts and everyone loved it. I like the fact that it is a darker chocolate fudge since I absolutely LOVE dark chocolate and am not a big milk chocolate person.

Not that this recipe needs another review but it was VERY easy and great. I have made it 3 times since Christmas..and EVERYONE loved it!   Make sure that you wait until the mixture is boiling before counting down the 5 minutes! After the 5 minutes, the mixture will be nice and caramelized with a great candy smell to it!

This was my first time making fudge and it turned out PERFECTLY!   It was the biggest hit of all the holiday treats.  I ran out of chocolate chips so I substituted chocolate almonds and Rolos (it was all I had!) and it made it absolutely delicious.

I used part of this recipe with another friend's mum and it came out great. Used 2 cups sugar and milk instead. I heated the milk and added 2.5tbsp of expresso coffee to it. Cool it then added to the mixture. Gave it a bittersweet taste for those who doesn't want it too sweet.

This fudge is so good, it was smooth and very creamy.  My father-in-law can't get enough of this fudge and keeps telling me it is the best fudge he's ever tasted.  He just bought 3 different kinds of fudge while on vacation and said this fudge is way better.  He has requested more.  This recipe will be replacing my old one for sure.  The only thing I did differently was I also added half a Hershey's bar to the mix of chocolate chips.  I also lowered the heat once the mixture started boiling.  This fudge was good with or without nuts.  VERY, VERY GOOD!!!

This is the first time I have ever made fudge, & it was awesome!!! so easy & very good. I did use more nuts then called for, but we like alot of nuts in our fudge. I dont usually eat alot of what I make & I think I gained 5lbs from eating most of this fudge. Thanks Aunt Teen for a great recipe that I will use for many years!!

Perhaps I cooked mine to long, but I had my candy thermometer and it never hit soft ball...and it's one of those that you see on food shows. Anyways, after mine started looking dark, I went ahead and took it off the heat and added the chocolate chips and vanilla. It immediately stiffened where I couldn't stir it. I actually saved it by adding in several tablespoons more of evaporated milk, and stirred it until creamy/smooth. Still haven't found the perfect fudge recipe for me yet, but I'll try this one again.

Absolutely delicious! I have made it many times and it comes out perfect each time. Sometimes I had put peanut butter chips instead of the semi sweet, which also tastes great. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW, this fudge was so easy and tasted amazing. I cooked it without using a thermometer and it still turned out fantastic. I let the chocolate boil for about 7 minutes before pouring it into the pan. Also cooking on a lower/medium temperature is very important for maintaining a smooth, creamy consitency. Made it for my German family who had never eaten fudge before. It was such a hit! I did use more darker chocolate than the lighter, and reduced the sugar just a bit. This was such a lovely recipe, I will be making it again and again :) Thanks from Freudenberg, Germany

This fudge was very good, but VERY SWEET.  It was easy to make.  I boiled it for 6 1/2-7 min.  I left it in the refrigerator for about 6 hours because I was making other things and forgot about it.  When I got it out it was difficult to cut, but I finally got the job done.  It is very creamy and did I say SWEET?  I will make this again.

Yumm-o. The reviewer who directed stir for 7 minutes was right on the money. I also reversed ratio of milk choc to semi sweet choc and added more pnuts.

Yummy! This was my first time making fudge and it turned out awesome! The flavor is fantastic. I won't make fudge any other way. For a seasonal flare I topped it off with crushed candy canes. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

After reading the reviews I was nervous to give fudge a try (I'm a newbie at 'candy' making) but the directions were super easy to follow and it turned out fantastic!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, other viewers said it poured out of the pan??  Mine was like wall paper paste.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I bought every ingriendient today so I knew it would be fresh.  I mixed constantly for 7 minutes - maybe too long.  I used vanialla that I bought from Mexico, so I'm not sure if that's the issue or the length of time.  Also, I had to pour tons of grease off the pan.  I'm not sure if it's the butter or the vanilla.  It's in the fridge now, so I guess will see what it taste like, because it doesn't look pretty.

This was my first try making fudge, I am not a big fan of fudge but i thought i would give it as a holiday gift to a friend. I was scared to death i was going to mess it up because i didn't have a thermometer. They turned out great! I cooked the marshmellow mixture on low until well blended and cooked it for 7 minutes on medium.  I read some reviews and changed a couple of things. I used 1 1/4 cup sugat and only used 1 tablespoon butter. in the madness of trying not to mess up the recipe I forgot the salt and it still tasted great. What leftover fudge was not gifted is gone and they are wanting more. thanks 4 a great recipe

I'm always looking for a creamy fudge and I think I finally found it!  Very good.  Definitely use a very sturdy spoon for when your stirring in the chocolate chips because it gets pretty firm.  I didn't put in the nuts because I have picky family members, but I did use Heath english toffee pieces and it was awesome and you still get that "crunch."  I also think it makes the perfect amount too.

Not a fan of this fudge.  I am in Arizona, so I don't know if the dry climate has anything to do with it, but it came out dry.  I cooked it for exactly 5 minutes and after adding the chocolate chips, it got very stiff, very fast and was difficult to add the nuts and had to press into the pan, not pour.  I was planning on making two batches of this, but probably not going to now.

I only had 1/2 the amount of marshmallow creme so I added an additional 2 cups of mini marshmallows. Even though the conversion if you use marshmallows only is, 7 oz. marshmallow creme= 2 1/8 c. marshmallows. So this tasted really good even though apparently I added way too much of the marshmallows!!!

This is absolutely delicious!
It reminds of the Fantasy Fudge recipe on the back of the marshmallow creme jar.That is the one mom always made. I think I like this version better though and will make this every year!

I read lots of the reviews before using this recipe. It tastes very good, but it got thick very quickly and I could not pour it out of the cooking pan. I had to press it into the 8 x 8 pan and it separated a little. Not glossy on top at all. I consider myself to be a pretty decent cook and rarely have dissapointments. I made it twice and both times by the time I got the chips mixed in, it was quite stiff. Difficult to add the nuts. Tasty however.

For some reason, I had a really hard time getting this up to soft ball stage.  I had to turn up the heat to get the temp up, but also risked burning the mixture.  I gave up after it hit about 210 because I saw it started burning in the corners of the pan.  I proceeded with the recipe, which has a great taste, but non-fudge consistency.  It ended up being more caramel-y (which is just fine if you like caramel like I do).

I have loved fudge from my childhood but dince tasting it as an adult I've not liked it anymore.  Last year my children requested fudge so I came here to find one.  I tried this one and realized I still love fudge, as long as it is the right kind.  I just made 3 batches today.  One I experimented with by changing the chocolate chips to white chocolate chips and using clear vanilla.  Absolutely FABULOUS!!!  I just followed the recipe to the letter except I did not refrigerate the fudge, just left it out on the counter.  Thanks Beth.

I actually "butchered" this recipe. I didn't have any milk chocolate chips on hand, but instead used Hershy Bars. Turned out great. Was making it for a customer and they loved it!

Yum Yum. I was craving fudge one night. I had never made it before so I got on here and found this recipe.  Glad I did.  I found it very easy and very tasty.  My family came to visit the next day and ate all the rest of it.  So good I made it for my Xmas goodies packages I sent out this year.  Big hit.

I really don't like giving bad reviews, and I probably did something wrong. Because, when I added my chocolate chips, the fudge hardened up, and was crunchy and crumbly. Oh well, I may try it again and melt my chocolate chips first or something. If anyone else's turns out like mine, you can add a little milk and some Golden Grahams cereal to make it like indoor smores. My Mom liked the "fudge" when I added those ingredients.

I made this for the first time about a year ago using a candy thermometer, and the whole thing separated and was a mess.  I tried it again this year, without the candy thermomter, and followed the directions EXACTLY, and it came out PERFECT!!  Totally creamy, melt-in-your-mouth fudge!  Very easy when I followed the directions, I will definitely be making this again!
12/10/09 Edit: I tried making this recipe again, and my fudge came out too crumbly and dry.  I think I cooked the milk/sugar/marshmallow creme mixture too long.  I just want to point out that this recipe produces absolutely delicious fudge, but the recipe is very finicky!  You must follow it exactly!

I used this recipe for my first ever attempt at fudge. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well. I did not have any issues with a finished product that was grainy or oily as reported by some reviewers.
My fudge had a firm, smooth and dense texture. I used a candy thermometer to ensure the marshmallow and butter mixture reached the soft-ball stage then I immediately removed from the heat, added the chocolate and continued to stir like mad. 

I stired constantly with a silicone "scraper/spatula" throughout the entire process and I used a nonstick pot.

I will make this again and experiment with other flavors. Thanks!

I have tried many homemade fudges and they all have something lacking but I was never able to put my finger on it. 
When I tried this recipe I was surprised by how easy it was to make. The fudge itself only lasted a few days because it was SOOO delicious. It really tasted like the kind you buy in the store for $5/slice. I gave it away as gifts so I cut it into small bite size pieces, wrapped it in wax paper and twisted the edges like candy. I filled a bowl and it looked perfect!

I read a ton of the reviews and followed them to a tea, and this still did not set. I am so sad. I was planning on taking it to a friends this weekend and it is basically the consistency of icing. I boiled for over 5 minutes, etc., etc. It is really creamy, but TOO creamy. Oh well, different recipe next time!

I can't believe it... it worked! I followed the directions exactly except for one substitution: I used 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of Andes mint chocolate pieces. YUM! It tastes like the fudge version of a Thin Mint. One word of caution: when it says "stir constantly," it really does mean stir constantly. I brought mine to a rolling boil, but had to reduce the heat slightly because it was starting to burn. This just added a slightly caramel taste to it, and it worked out in the end, but next time I'll know the reduce the heat immediately. I boiled mine for exactly 5 minutes and it turned out fabulous! Thank you Aunt Teen!!

2 rules about fudge given to me by my mother: "real fudge" does not contain marshmallow cream and does not need to be refridgerated. i don't care so much about that though - as long as it's good. this recipe got so thick that i couldn't spread it well in the pan and then it had pools of butter on top. i was not impressed at all.

I made this 3 times. The first time I assumed that 2/3 cup Evaporated Milk was a full can. It didn't set. Second time: I followed the directions as stated and it came out a bit crumbly. Now the third time after reading about how to prevent this from becoming crumbly, it worked! However, DO NOT BRING IT TO A ROLLING BOIL! I boiled it to where it was giving off little bubbles and when it got a bit to hot, I took it off the stove for 30 seconds and then back on again. I only cooked it for the 5 minutes to. I must say that its really good fudge!

This is now my go-to recipe for fudge!  It is wonderful.  I was always nervous about making fudge, but it turns out perfect every time!  I have already passed this recipe on to several others who are equally happy with it!  Love it!  Thanks for taking the mystery out of making great fudge!

This recipe is so easy to make and turn out so good! You'll never be able to eat a piece of someone else's grainy, dry fudge again. Layer with "Creamy Peanut Butter Fudge" for peaut butter/chocolate goodness!

This was the first fudge recipe I've ever tried to make -- and I found it so easy and  so delicious that I won't even bother with any others.  Very easy to make, although watch it when it comes to boiling (so as not to burn).  Extremely delicious that all the people at work love it when I make it!

Amazing! My fiance said they tasted like "real" fudge! I had a hard time boiling the mixture as it started to brown on the bottom. I think next time I'll just be more patient! The recipe said to boil for 5 minutes, but I swear it took about 15 minutes to boil! Very, very, very good though.

this was my first time making fudge, and it will probably be my last.  I followed the instructions, and it turned out like a rock.  I obviously over cooked it, but didnt even know it. Fudge is not as easy as it appears.

The only reason these are getting 4 stars opposed to 5 is because they so didn't turn out, but I think it was my doing, and I could tell they would've been great had I not done something wrong, which I think I added to much evaporated milk, so the fudge didn't set to where they could be cut into squares, so we ate it with spoons.  It was thick and gooey, very tasty, just not properly settled.  Like i said, I'm pretty sure it was my doing.  I'll have to try again!!! Update... One year later... Again I made this for Christmas, following the directions to the T, and PERFECT. I had accidently used the entire can of evaporated milk the last time, which is why it hadn't set, but this time I used the correct amount and it turned out wonderful, and so easy to make!!! 5 Stars!!!

This fudge is incredibly good and very easy to make.  In my experience, it's also pretty forgiving and will still come out if you don't follow the recipe to a T.  If you're a guy like me, even if you can't cook, just get together 10 bucks for ingredients, someone with a stove to use, and 30 minutes of your time.  That's all you need to amaze your roommates, make your girlfriend feel like a princess, and her friends think you're a prince.

I loved this Fudge recipe! It set up so well. It wasn't too hard or too soft. I've had trouble with the consistancy of other recipes.....tastey, but requires a soup spoon. This one is a winner! Everybody loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't deviate. I will be making it again next year!

Nice fudge but going the quick route (using sweetened condensed milk instead of sugar and evaporated milk) does bring the same results.
It also makes for a no-fail recipe.

Ok I some how really messed this one up.  I think I boiled for WAY too long!  The flavor was really great but my fudge was rock hard. I couldn't even cut it hardly.  I used the 1 cup chocolate chips and the 2 cups semi-sweet like someone else had suggested.  Coming out w/ a more dark chocolate like taste. I still gave the recipe a 4 because flavor and ease of making were there.  My fault as just boiling too long.  I'll try it again another time.

I've made this fudge many times and it's still my fav! Recently I made it twice and it didn't mix together as smoothly or have that nice sheen I'm use to.  The only thing I did differently was use the store brand marshmallow creme - won't be using it again.

This fudge was wonderful.  I used sucralose instead of regular sugar and it turned out so good!  I didn't have marshmellow cream so I just used 6-8 marshmellows.  This was so easy and I didn't need any thermometers.

I make this fudge every year with very few alterations and rave reviews.  It is very, very rich.  I substitute crushed candy canes for the nuts and 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp mint extract for the 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  It's wonderful for Christmas!

I've made a lot of fudge and this one had such good reviews I thought I'd try it to compare. It was dry and crumbly, and tasted like a dried out, sugary version of the chocolate I used to make it. I was very disappointed, and I can make other fudge that takes less time and has a much better consistency and taste.

I use this recipe every year.  It is by far the best and is very easy.  Very consistent.  It comes out the same everytime I make it.  It is creamy and not gritty like most fudge recipes are.  I give it away as gifts and everybody asks for the recipe.

This has to be one of the easiest, most fool proof and most delicious fudge recipes out there. I've made it the past 2 years over the holidays as gifts and it always gets rave reviews. Some of the batches get different flavors (kahlua, chambord, creme de menthe), but they all come from this recipe and I haven't had a batch yet that hasn't turned out. Highly recommend this recipe for making fudge.

extremely creamy and good. i made this the top layer over the "worlds best peanut butter fudge" also found on this site and used reese's cups cut in half to garnish the top. it made ALOT and it didnt take long to disappear!

edit- make sure you cook it long enough....ive made it quite a few times with GREAT results, but once i think i underdid it and it was very greasy.

This was my first attempt at making fudge and I was a bit nervous as to how it would turn out. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was simple to make and came out perfect! Great flavor and great texture! I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was. This one will have a place in my archives!

I brought this fudge recipe to a gathering and put it next to another. This recipe put the other to shame. My fudge was so creamy and seemed to last in the mouth longer. Mine was eaten up and the other stayed.

This is super easy! Made this for a cocktail party and no one could get enough. Used 1/2 of the marshmallow cream and 1/2 small marshmallows, gave it more texture.

This was my first time making fudge and I'm keeping this recipe.  I made it twice in the last two days.  Once for Chrismas gifts and again for the family.  The second time I forgot the vanilla and it still turned out delicous.  The other thing I love about this recipe is that it was incredibly easy.  This one's a keeper!

This is pretty much foolproof, easy to make except for all that constant stirring....made my arm hurt but it was worth it.  I like the combination of milk chocolate & semisweet.  Will definitely make again!

This is an easy enough recipe to make, but it basically just tastes like chocolate chips--not traditional fudge. After making it, I decided it tasted too amateurish to bring to work or give as gifts. No offense to Aunt Teen or anything. Just not at all what I was expecting after reading all the good reviews.

This recipe is fabulous!  I was even able to use my marshmallow creme that had turned a little sugary and the fudge still came out smooth and creamy!  I've been experimenting between using different combinations of semi-sweet, milk and some white chips as well.  Every batch has been perfect!  This is now the family favorite!!

Very good fudge, I doubled the recipe as I make a lot of candy trays for the holidays, worked great.  This is  a nice, soft fudge.  I prefer nuts in my fudge but most people don't so I made the big batch without and will make a smaller batch with nuts.

Terrific!  We made a half recipe because it seemed like the original might make too much for us.  The only hard part about it was trying to measure 1/2 jar of the marshmallow cream - we tried putting some in a measuring cup and microwaving it for 15 seconds, but that didn't do too much to it.  Because it looked like we had taken out about half the jar, we just put it all in the mix (looked to be about 1 c.). It came out really yummy!
Next time, which will be soon I'm sure, we'll make the whole batch :^D !!

This fudge is amazaing. I even convicec my grandma to try this recipe instead of the one she had been using for years. She switched. To make things a little different now and then I will use flavored chips (ie raspberry, peanut butter, mint etc) in  lieu of either the milk cholcolate or semi sweet. Just depending on how flavorful you would want your fudge to be. I always get asked to make fudge for get togethers. Everyone loves to see what combo's I can come up with.

Great stuff!  layered it with "Easiest Peanut butter fudge" for a two toned delight!  Easy and a BIG hit!  Quadrupled recipe - ALL was gone it two days - had to make more.  Compliments EVERYWHERE!

i didn't read the reviews before making and my marshmallow creme mixture also scorched a little...but you can't taste it at all! just be careful not to heat too high. only substitution was about 6 squares of semi-sweet baking chocolate because i ran out of the chips. decadent! i can't stop eating it.

This was so simple to prepare and it came out so delicious. My family said it was the best fudge they have had. It came out creamy not grainy and very rich. It is definitely a keeper. No one knew it was my first time to ever make fudge ;)

Great taste and easy to make. Just follow the recipe exactly and you'll do just fine. Except that you will have to make more and more and more and more to please your friends and family. This fudge certainly fills the craving for something chocolate!!! It is sweet and so, so, so, so, rich.

Both my husband and I suddenly got a craving for fudge, and based on the many 5-star ratings I decided to try this recipe.  It was easy to make, but to me it tasted chocolatey, but not fudgey--more like chocolate chips than fudge.  While smooth, mine seemed to be more firm than that of many other reviewers.  I would probably look for another recipe the next time I make fudge.  2/19--I am ammending my review because I thought the fudge was much better the second day and didn't taste just like chocolate chips.

I made two batches of this fudge.  The first, I think I cooked a little long, so it was harder.  The second time, I cooked it less and also let it firm up in the fridge for only 15 minutes.  I also have made this with marshmallows (28 full size marshmallows was the equivalent of the marshmallow creme) and I did half milk chocolate chips and half peanut butter.  The peanut butter/chocolate mix was to die for!  Great recipe to experiment with.  I plan to make this as part of my Christmas gift baskets next year.

These turned out wonderfully!  They were really easy.  The only minor complaint I had was that they were difficult to cut once they came out of the fridge.

I really liked how this recipe turned out.  Very easy, perfect fudge.  I made it without nuts.  The second time that I made it I tried to put down one layer of origial recipe fudge and then mixed in a bar of dark chocolate.  It was still good, but the top layer was harder than the bottom layer.  The third time that I made it, I substituted 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract for the vanilla and sprinkled crushed candy canes on top. (idea from similar recipe on this site)  It turned out amazingly as well.  All in all, just a really good fudge!

This is out of this world!!!  The only thing I did wrong was heat the milk/butter/marshmallow/sugar mixture too high, so it scorched a little, but it still tasted fantastic!

My husband loved it, and he is a fudge-ahololic.  I made these changes for my altitude and weather: shorted the sugar by 1/8th of a cup, boiled for 4 minutes, and used all semi-sweet chocolate.  Came out moist, not too soft, and smooth - not gritty at all!

I tried this recipe for the first time, and I was a bit nervous about it. After reading almost all of the reviews I was concerned about overcooking it and burning it. I started out on the lowest setting for five minutes, and worked up to the medium setting running each setting at five minutes. I stirred constantly, I did not stop at all (except to check for boiling). Someone said that it would even start to boil before the bubbles actually appeared (meaning that the bubbles were below the surface and couldn't really be seen). So I'd stop, put my ear down, and listen for bubble sounds. Once I started hearing bubbles and seeing bubbles appear to the surface through stirring, I started the five minutes. I may have even *undercooked* it a little bit, but not by too much. Since it probably wasn't hot enough, the chocolate chips made it a little stiff but not too hard like some other people have complained about. I used 3 tbs. butter, 2 cups semisweet and 1 cup milk chocolate chips like some people have suggested. It came out perfect. A bit rich but that's better than too sweet. I'm going to make this again before Christmas.

I splurged and bought good chocolate, and I think it made all the difference. I also made a butterscotch fudge with pecans. This is a very flexible recipe, so I can't wait to try additional variations.

This was my first attempt at fudge.  I used 2 cups of white chocolate chips and 1 cup of butterscotch chips.  I must have done something improperly  since the mixture went dry and crumbly when I added the chips.  I didn't want the entire batch to go to waste especially since the flavour was wonderful, so I added the rest of the 300mL can of evaporated milk as well as 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  Then I reheated the mixture  over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it was smooth.    It then very easily poured into the pan.  After 2 hours in the fridge it has turned out quite nicely. It's soft, but not too gooey and tastes great.  I'm going to try it again and hopefully it'll work out the first time!

This was my first time in making fudge and it was a hit.  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I waited until it boiled and then timed it for 5 minutes.  It was a little stiff and I ahd to press a little in the pan, but after refrigerating for 2 hours it was still soft and delicious.  Will definantly do this recipe again!

This is my first time making fudge and it tasted great. The recipe is really easy. I did follow some posters' advice to use 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate, 1 cup milk chocolate and 1 1/4 cup sugar. It came out just what I wanted. Thanks!

I too followed this recipe to a "T" and it turned out very very dry. As soon as I added the chocolate, I could hardly mix it. Once it cooled  I tried to cut it, it just crumbles.

This is the first time I made fudge. WOW!!!! What an easy and delicious recipe. I thought fudge would make a good Christmas gift for people at the office. I made a test-batch and it was the best fudge I ever tasted. I doubled the recipe and followed the instructions exactly. It only does take 5 minutes of boiling time. I also added Heath bar pieces to the top of one pan - a very nice touch!!! Thank you Kelly for sharing this terrific recipe. I've already emailed it to my sister!!! Happy Holidays!

I loved this recipie!  It came out creamy and rich, thick and chocolatey, but not too sweet, which is the case I find with many chocolate fudge recipies.  Overall, the best chocolate fudge recipie I've ever made! (and if you know me, I've tried quite a few!)

The best fudge recipe I've ever made!  It set perfectly, cut perfecctly, and stored perfectly.  Forget all the different advice on fudge making - follow the directions exactly.  I left out the nuts as I'm allergic.  The second time I made this, I used white chocolate, and it was far better than any other vanilla fudge recipe I've found so far.  An easy versatile, fantastic recipe!

This has been the ONLY fudge recipe in our house since I first discovered it almost two years ago.  It is not THAT different from recipes I have used in the past, but I think the difference in cooking the marshmallow creme may be what makes it so good.  It is easy to make, sets up perfectly.  I beat it when it is finished cooking until the sheen is gone.   I don't put it in the refrigerator, yet it gets just the right 'firm' almost immediately and can be cut into small squares. It is delicious.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My first successful fudge baking experience!  It was easy.  I also couldn't get the temperature high enough so I let it boil for 8 minutes.  I used 1 cup milk chocolate chips, 1 cup dark chocolate chips and 1 cup of semisweet chips and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  No nuts.  It was great.  I will make for a hostess gift at Thanksgiving.

This fudge was very smooth and creamy and popular with the children who taste tested it. However, I prefer a richer, more chocolatey fudge, and I found this one reminded me of a Hershey milk chocolate bar. I am an amateur fudge maker and I plan to keep testing recipes till I find the perfect fudge.

I heeded the advice of many and reduced the sugar to one cup and it was plenty sweet.  I also reduced the butter to half a stick as also noted by some and only a small amount of oil rose to the top which I blotted off.  I also added one ounce unsweetened chocolate to make it darker chocolate and used one cup of chopped honey roasted almonds. I used a candy thermometer and boiled at medium for 12 minutes from the first bubble and that was 230 degrees on the small electric coil burner in a 8 inch heavy saucepan, afraid to go 238 degrees which is the soft ball stage after reading about those who got grainy fudge and in light of going way over the 5 minute directions.  I lightly buttered an 8x8 glass pyrex dish and it did not stick at all and the fudge was about one inch thick.  The fudge tasted just like 'fudge store fudge'!  I am not sure how this would have turned out boiling for only 5 minutes as the candy thermometer only came up to 200 degrees.  Use one of those dough cutters for cutting as they do in the fudge shoppes.  This is a revised review as I did not wait long enough before I cut into it and thought it was not firm enough,(too anxious) but in fact came out perfect after the 2 hours in the refrigerator.  This recipe is a keeper.

I bought some fudge at a local fair and wondered what made that recipe so great.  Hers was sweeter and creamier than the kind I make and I wondered what her recipe was.  She wasn't sharing.  I think this recipe has to be it!  It has something to do with the milk chocolate/semi-sweet chocolate chips, probably.  Usually I use just semi-chocolate chips but the milk chocolate adds something extra.  It seemed strange to me to add the marshmallow creme at the same time you add the evaporated milk, but I did it anyway.  Make sure you cook it on low-medium heat because it started scorching on the bottom.  This is a great recipe.  I'll definately use it again!

This fudge recipe is great! My friends and family request a batch for all holidays and parties.  Don't add any more milk chocolate than the recipe instructs or the fudge will be too sweet.

If you're looking to make fudge for the first time, like I was, this is the recipe for you...I doubled the nuts portion using pecans as my nut of choice, turned out great. Will use again for any future fudge making projects.

very yummy.  i like pecans.  This time, I conservatively doubled the amount of nuts.  I think there were just enough after doubling.  Next time I will do a heaping double of nuts.  I used margarine and could not tell a difference.  I made two recipes one by just spray the bottom of the pan and the other by using the foil.  Both worked well.  I also made one with just choco and the other with butterscotch.  Butterscotch was everyone fav.  Both Yummy, though.

This was extremely easy to make!  I was looking for a recipe similar to the one my mother used to make.  This was close...but still not quite as creamy.  You DEFINITELY need to use a sturdy wooden spoon when making this!

Aunt Teen made my Christmas very Merry.  I make baskets for all my clients and put some of her fudge in each one.  I received so many phone calls asking for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exact except added a little more vanilla. 
Thanks for the recipe.

My first attempt at making fudge and it worked perfectly.
The suggested alterations I used were to add the marshmellow with the chocolate chips, to cook the milk mixture on low medium heat and to stir constantly.  The second time I made it I cut back on the sugar but my husband said it was better the first time!
Next time I might use better grade of chocolate.
Great recipe; I got rave reviews.

Absolutely the best and very easy!  I chose the right recipe for my first fudge endeavor. The key apparently is in the 5 minute boil. My second batch I made was with the new Nestle Swirl chips - great tasting. Thanks Kelly for sharing your Aunt's recipe.

Last year was my first time to try making fudge and I used this recipe.  It got such rave reviews so I used this recipe again this year.  A real winner.  If you want a creamy fudge that is easy to make then this is your choice.  My co-worker and I both tried different recipes and this one won hands down.  Thanks Kelly for sharing.

This is the easiest, most delicious fudge!  It's very rich so I put it a little larger of a pan to make it not so thick, other than that I wouldn't change a thing!  Definitely try it out; you'll love it and so will everyone else.

This recipe is great as is, but is also an awesome base recipe for anything you could want.  This year I made a peppermint fudge and an espresso fudge using this as a starter, and the stuff flew off party trays like there was no tomorrow.

I thought it was too sweet the first time I made it as a thank you present for some friends. It tasted too much of just sugar than the chocolate, so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, and it turned out great!

I'm sure the recipe is delicious, but I must have cooked it too long. It was hard as a brick!! I'll try again though and rerate the recipe if it turns out better.:)  Ally
12-05 Made it a 2nd time. I had the SAME problem even though I used a candy thermometer and heated the fudge to 234 degrees. It still came out dry and hard, edible, but NOT fudgy.  Oh well! I'll try to find another recipe. I have an excellent PB fudge recipe that always turns out. Sorry! This one just doesn't cooperate for me! Ally

This fudge is really great. I used black walnuts for my husbands taste and also added two tablespoons of peanut butter when I added the chips. I kept it refrigerated. It is great for gift giving around the Holidays.

This fudge is AWESOME! MY husband loved it when I dipped some bite-sized pieces of banana into the fudge and let them sit in the fridge to harden.  He also is a peanut butter addict and would spread peanut butter on top of the fudge and eat it that way, too.

Followed recipe to a "t" and the mixture was overly thick and unpourable.  Couldn't even stir the nuts it was so thick. Had to press mixture into the pan.  Texture was wrong, though flavor was good.

I never made fudge before.  My 13 year old and her friend and my 9 year old made this last night. It came out fantastic.  My husband who is on weight watchers told me to get it out of the house before he ate more than he should.

This fudge was awesome!  It takes a little time to make, but well worth the wait.  It was very creamy and well blended.  I didn't think it was too sweet.  I used Ghiradelli chocolate squares because I didn't have any milk choc. chips.  Was very good!!

This has been the 3rd year in a row that I have made this recipe. It is awesome! I recieve multiple requests for "my" fudge during the holidays. This year I made 4 batches and still ran out. If you don't think this is the best fudge recipe out there, you did something wrong! This fudge rocks!!!!!!!

Very creammy and melts in your mouth! best fudge I have ever made, and eaten. If your all relaxed and you sit and enjoy eating a piece its almost zen like. I don't know what people are talking about when they said it started to set in the saucepan, must of been doing it wrong. Creamy the whole time right down to the last piece. I could eat it everyday.

It turned out great! I am known in my family as the one who can't make fudge. HA! I did it. I was a little concerned after adding the chips that it wouldn't be very creamy, because it started setting up very quickly after adding them. I did turn out nice and creamy though. I think next time, I will cook it for a shorter amount of time and perhaps add fewer chips. I can't wait to try it with different flavored chips, like peanut butter or butterscotch. Thanks!

WOW! This is absolutely the best homemade fudge I have ever tasted. I have tried to make homemade fudge maybe twice in my lifetime, so I'm not an experienced fudgemaker, so I was pleasantly surprised when I made this fudge and it turned out perfect! Kudos to Aunt Teeny and thank you Kelly for sharing this scrumcious recipe.

Quick and easy. This fudge was a definite hit.  The only change I made was to use 1-1/2 cups each of milk chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips.  I will definitely make this again!!

Easy & Delicious.  I have never been able to make fudge, it never hardened or tasted like a solid chocolate bar.  

This recipe came out perfect the first time.  You don't even need a thermometer.  The clean up is painless too.  Everyone in my family and even the neighbors devoured it instantly and raved about it.  They always want me to make this fudge.   I don't know who liked it more, the kids or adults.

This was very creamy and smooth.  My family enjoyed this (I am more of a Peanut Butter Fudge Fan) very much.  Next time I think I will layer this with the Creamy Peanut Butter Fudge recipe found on this site and then have the best of both worlds.

As a first-time fudgemaker, I was a little apprehensive, but the fudge turned out fabulous!  My family said it was just as good as the fudge we go crazy for every year at our state fair!  Thanks for the awesome (and easy!) recipe.

This is sooooo good. Comments here say it is my best fudge ever! I did not have any semi-sweet chips so used all milk choc. chips and cannot imagine it being any better. It is sweet, but that is what fudge is meant to be in my opinion.
It is not a diet food, but this is not a diet season! I will make it again, no question.

I tried this twice, following the directions exactly and while the result was flavorful, it was just firmer than I thought it should be.  I will keep searching for a soft, creamy chocolate fudge recipe.  Thank you for the recipe.  I am glad others had better success than me.

Too chocolately for me!  This fudge was quick & easy to make - and tasted it.  However I didn't follow to the letter - I used 2 c. Ghiradelli double chocolate chips with 1 c. semi-sweet chips.

This fudge is excellent. VERY easy to make and delicious. Though it's pretty much the recipe off the back of the marshmellow fluff jar..with a few modifications. Also, I don't add the marshmellow fluff until the very end..and mine always turns out creamy and smooth. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful fudge!  I made it twice, the first time as written but cooking it for about 6 1/2 minutes and it turned out great.  But, since I love darker chocolate, I decided to use 2 cups of semisweet chocolate and 1 cup milk chocolate (plus 1 cup of nuts) the second time and it was even better!  As for the appearance of the top of the fudge, I noticed that the glossiness of the top disappeared the more I spread it in the pan but it couldn't be helped.  Also, don't rush the cooking by turning up the heat-slow and steady is the trick to making really creamy fudge!

This is a really wonderful fudge!  Some may find it a little too soft, so just cut down on the evaporated milk a little.  Otherwise, it is so smooth and creamy.  My family and coworkers really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing!

I tried this out for my first fudge attempt, and I do have to agree that it was very easy to do.  I forgot to buy nuts, so my fudge was pure chocolate - a little too sweet for my tastes. I took it to work and it vanished in less than an hour, so I assume everyone liked it!
thanks Kelly!

This is the second year that I've made this fudge for Christmas.  It is the best recipe ever. All my friends have been reminding me how much they liked it, and asking if I am going to make it again this year.  

UPDATE:  8 years later this is still my top Fudge recipe!!!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe, and so very easy.  I made a small pan for a family gathering and they were begging me to make two more pans the next day for those that didn't get to have some before it disappeared. Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm by no means an expert on fudge but it certainly does taste scrumptious to me! Very easy and I'm definitely glad for my non-stick t-fal pot. :)

I made this fudge for a get together.  Everyone loved it! By the end of the night I had seven different people ask me for the recipe.  This fudge recipe is a keeper.

This was GREAT, I used one modification, only because I bought heavy cream for another fudge recipe, and used it instead of the evaporated milk.  I got so many compliments.  This was so super creamy.  I gave it out at Christmas, and everyone wanted more.  Thank you for this one.

I had never made fudge before and I'm not a great cook, but I had the super mom bug bite me this Christmas and decided I wanted to put together some Christmas baked cookies for our friends and neighbors.  I was really terrified but this recipe was soooo easy and the fudge came out terrific.  I'm telling you if yours didn't come out right you're doing something wrong, because if I made this..anyone can!

WONDERFUL!!!  EASY!!!  TASTY!!!  Tastes just as good (maybe even better) than the Mackinaw Island fudge my parents send to me.  Before I made the fudge I was a bit skeptical but since there were so many rave reviews, I tried it.  It is creamy, tasty, and great!  As for it being sweet; isn't fudge SUPPOSED to be sweet?!?!  Next time I make it I'm going to experiment and use some peanut butter chips.

I first attempted an old fashioned fudge recipe and when that sugared and didn't set I moved to this.  It was easy, fast and delicious!  My children love it and I love it, a great Christmas gift.

I have tried lots of fudge but this is by far the best. And so easy to make! Not a bit grainy. Just be sure to use good sugar like C&H not the store brand. Thanks again Aunt Teen!!

Think this would have been great...I boiled and stirred for exactly 5 min and as soon as the chips hit the pan, bam! Instant chocolate glue. Wish more people would put temperatures in the recipes, especially for beginners like me.

If I didn't know this wasn't the old fashioned type fudge I would have bet money it was.  I have always made fudge the old way because I never thought these recipes with marshmallow creme and choc. chips ever tasted close to the real thing.  My hats off for this one, I had so many compliments on this, no one could believe this wasn't my usual fudge....Lori from Kansas

Really good flavor.  My husband loved this and ate most of it himself.  I prefer a more harder type, this is really soft.  But overall good.

I must have done something wrong because my fudge looked like brownie batter and it got really thick really fast! I used real butter also and it had alot of melted butter standing on the top. Are you supposed to use margarine? I will try it again, because of all the positive comments here.

Excellent. No need to tweak the recipe. Just follow the instructions, including stirring for five minutes after it starts boiling, and you will get a great fudge. I discovered this recipe two months ago and have made it at least ten times. The reviews have been wonderful!

Delicious and creamy. I read several comments regarding the sugar and butter reduction as well as the cooking time increase BEFORE I made it. Thank you to those commenters.
This was my first time making fudge. I'm excited to make it in the future for parties, etc.

Perfect! Don't start 5 minute timer until it's really rolling or just boil 6 1/2 minutes as soon as it starts to boil. I've made it 4 times & it's just great! Thanks

My husband loves fudge, so using some of the suggestions in the comments, my husband said this was very good fudge.  I will be making it again.

Used peppermint oil instead of vanilla, and added crushed peppermint on top.  Will definitely make again, loved it!

I made it just as the recipe stated only added 1/2 tsp of peppermint extract and rolled it into bonbons, some coated with crushed candy cane, others cocoa and jimmies. Just like I remember my mom making all thise years ago.  Delish!

Very easy.  I did two batches. First one with walnuts and I may not have boiled it long enough as the fudge got super soft when left out (no substance).  The second batch with almonds and that turned out way better (I made sure I boiled it longer). With both batches, I added double the nuts

This is hands down the easiest fudge recipe that I have ever used. It never fails. If you like dark chocolate like I do, you can use 2 cups semi sweet and 1 cup milk chocolate. I make it both ways. They are both delicious.

I have been using this fudge recipe every year during our family Christmas candy making day for the past 7 years or so. It is the creamiest fudge recipe I have come across and quite frankly I have stopped buying fudge because I haven’t found a fudge that I like better than mine (due to this recipe)! I follow the recipe to the “t” and it is THE best fudge recipe.

Followed the directions exactly, then added a layer of white chocolate with crème de menthe to Christmas it up a bit.
It kicks proverbial gluteus maximus.

I'm a chef and there are a few ways to mess this easy recipe up.  First, do NOT add the marshmallow fluff to the sugar and milk. Simply place the marshmallow in with the chocolate.
(I do micro the fluff for 20 seconds to help it get out of the jar, and I also slightly micro the chocolate.)

You can use less butter. 1 to 2 tablespoons max.

You can vary the type of chocolate. I like even amounts of semi and milk chocolate.

Here's where most people go wrong.  You need to bring the milk and sugar to a slow, very slow, boil. People are putting the burner too hot. (med is the max you should use) and/or boiling it too long.
When the mixture begins to boil, (a few bubbles) start the 5-minute timer. I check the temp with a good digital thermometer.  When it hits 230 degrees Fahrenheit lower the burner heat to low. 

I slightly heat the milk first and slowly add the sugar. I stir constantly. My fudge comes out perfect every time.

Researched all the suggestions and decided to not add the marshmallow til the end of the 5 minutes mainly because my other fudge recipe is done that way and also cause many suggested it on here.  I cooked it for 5 min 30 seconds.  Used only the name brand marshmallow fluff and choc chips.  Had everything pre measured out and ready to add and stir.  My last step was the choc chips and it instantly became stiff and crumbly and dry.  Pretty much inedible and super dry.  I am not a novice baker and have made plenty of fudge.  Pretty upset at a waste of time and money *sigh*  Perhaps if i had started off with the marshmallow creme in the  pan right away but i dont know :(

After looking for that perfect fudge recipes over the years, I finally stopped when I found this one. As far as I’m concerned, Aunt Teen is an expert in fudge making. I estimate I’ve made this recipe at  *least* 25 times, and each time it has turned out delicious. I follow the recipe exactly as written, but I use quality ingredients, a heavier pot and a wooden spoon. Also have all of your ingredients ready, because you have to stir this constantly on med-low heat so it doesn’t scorch. Wait for it to get to a moderate rolling boil, then start timing your 5 minutes, otherwise it can be too soft. The ratio of milk chocolate to semi sweet is perfect (and for those who say it’s too sweet..it’s fudge..it’s supposed to be sweet!). I do store it in the fridge, because it is a softer, creamier type of fudge (some reviewers have suggested cooking it an extra minute or two, but I’m afraid that might make it dry). I cut it in 1 inch by 1 inch pieces and keep it covered with plastic wrap. Whenever I have a chocolate craving, this stuff satisfies perfectly, especially around Christmas. I compare all fudge to this recipe—including stores who make it and sell it, and most of them don’t compare to this stuff. Aunt Teen—you rock!

This fudge is great! My advice is to have your chocolate chips premeasured so you can just dump them right in. This doesn't last longer than 3 days in my house. Even my friend who swore to me she hated fudge loved it. It's a keeper!!!

This is the only fudge recipe that I use. I make loads of it for Christmas and give it out as gifts. I get compliments about how good it is, so of course I will keep using this same recipe. Thanks for sharing. It's fanfudgetastic! That was corny, but that's who I am.

This is a delicious fudge recipe. The only fudge I have made before was cream cheese fudge and it needed to be refrigerated. This is quick and easy! I made it on Christmas Eve in the morning and gave it as treats that evening.

I made too many modifications to make a fair assessment of this recipe but it really got me started towards a wonderful pan of fudge.  I used dark chocolate chips and semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate.  I also added a large handful of mini-marshmallows to melt with the marshmallow cream.

I brought the ingredients to 236 degrees using a candy thermometer and then added the chocolate chips.  As I started stirring, the whole thing seized up into a solid mass . Didn't turn out at all. I think the key is the add the marshmallow cream after bringing the fudge to temperature because another recipe on this website (The Original Fantasy Fudge) worked perfectly.

We love fudge, but this recipe was meh. It came out perfect, we just didn't care for the taste. I popped the fluff for 15 minutes. I stirred the ingredients on low for awhile until everything was uniform. Then I started increasing the temperature to low medium until it started boiling. Once it started boiling, I continued stirring for another 6-7 minutes. Next time, I'll omit the chocolate and try just plain vanilla fudge.

This was my first attempt at making fudge ever - and it was perfect!  Delicious, creamy, and easy to prepare!!  Give it a try, but don't forget how important the timing is.  Have everything ready to go, don't stop stirring, chill and enjoy!

This was my very first attempt at fudge. I followed others suggestion and used only 1 tbsp butter and waited to add the marshmallow creme until after boiling the evaporated milk, butter and sugar for 6 1/2 minutes. It came out the perfect texture and very creamy. However, it tasted more like melted chocolate chips than fudge.

I made this exactly as written except swapped the amounts of milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It was very thick when I put it in pan and so was hard to spread.  It turned out very hard and difficult to cut.  The top was beautiful but when cut, there were many air pockets.  NOT smooth at all!!  Tastes wonderful and I ended up just breaking it up like pieces of chocolate bar.  Tastes great, but why did it not turn out soft and smooth like other fudge I've made??  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Just. Not. Good.

I don’t understand why all the high reviews. I followed the directions precisely, read all the tips, and used high quality ingredients. Yet, it turned out hard, crumbly, grainy, and overly sweet. Blech!

I  have made this TWICE in the last 3 weeks and it is a perfect, easy recipe, and you don't need a candy thermometer! As other reviewers have stated, brand name marshmallow creme is key! 5 minutes timed boil on medium low to medium, then stir in marshmallow, 2 teaspoons vanilla, and nuts, if desired and Voila' !

This is the only fudge recipe I will make. It's so creamy and perfect! I have even changed it up a little and added a 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter after pouring into the pan, then I swirled the peanut butter in and YUM! I mostly stick with the original recipe because it's sooooo good, and everyone who eats a piece loves it. Thanks for the awesome fudge recipe. I will make again and again!

won't be looking for anymore fudge recipes- this is a keeper! the only thing I did differently was I used a double broiler and didn't bring it to a boil- just stirred it for almost 10 minutes until smooth. And I added peanut butter chips right before I poured it into the pan for some peanut buttery goodness. But I'm sure without those steps, it would've turned out just as good.

Great recipe!!! I accidentally  forgot to buy evaporated milk.  Luckily I had a can of coconut milk so I sub'd it in 1:1!!!! Turned out perfect and there's no coconut taste at all!!! I couldn't be happier with the results!!!

My husband wanted to make fudge so I did some research and found this recipe.  I read all the reviews and jotted down changes others made.  First batch we used a candy thermometer as some recommended and cut down to 1 T butter.  The end result tasted good but wasn't the creamy texture we were hoping for.  I think it was over cooked.  So, we tried again, this time following the recipe more closely.  The only change we made was we used 3 T butter and we did microwave the marshmallow cream for about 10 seconds to make it easier to get out of the container.  We didn't bother with the candy thermometer but instead waited until we got a good boil and set the timer for 5 minutes as the recipe suggests.  This resulted in a much better, creamy texture.  It held it's shape perfectly when set and cut.  Would highly recommend!

It is very good, but not as good, in my opinion, as the good old Hershey's recipe.  This one does get properly hard, much better than the Hershey's, but it doesn't have quite that deep fudge flavor that is so special.  It is good to have a recipe that I can count on getting hard!

We made this with 3 cups of bittersweet chocolate chips since this is what we had on hand and it turned out excellent.  We crushed candy canes and added it to the top right before we put it in the fridge.  Our guests raved about it.  This one is a keeper!!

Good flavor, but agree with others...too greasy.  Will cut the butter to 1 Tbsp next time.

I found this recipe years ago, and it's the only fudge recipe I will use. It's perfect! I get so many compliments when I make it and give it away for the holidays. Thank you for sharing the family recipe.  *Tip: Be sure you pre-measure everything you will need and get it ready, because once you start, you have to constantly stir and won't have time for measuring. If you stir and work quickly, you will have perfect fudge every time.

I didn't have marshmallow cream  so I substituted miniature marshmallows.  Also used only semi-sweet chocolate.  Have made this for years, but lost the recipe & didn't know how much sugar/milk.  Its wonderful.

I've been on a fudge quest and this one is a winner!!!
I didn't have milk chocolate chips, so I used hershey kisses which I warmed in the microwave.  I also had to put it back on the stove to melt all the chocolate and it still came out GREAT!

I've made this twice, the first time was perfect, but the achieving time turned out greasy and grainy. Everything was done the same, except for the condensed milk. the second time we only had sweetened condensed milk, so I used that. the next time I make this I will use regular condensed milk and update if it turns out smooth like the first time.

This is the first time I've made fudge, and the results were excellent. If you don't have marshmallow creme on hand, you can substitute 16 large marshmallows and 2 tsp of corn syrup melted in a double broiler on high. Once the marshmallows are all gooey (it's ok if a few mallow chunks are left over) the rest of the recipe may be followed as written (although you may have to transfer the mixture into a medium pot to get it to boil).  I stirred constantly for 7 minutes while it boiled and the results were perfect. This recipe fit well in a 9x13 inch pan. I'll definitely be making this again and again.

Great recipe. I doubled it and put crushed Oreos on the bottom of the 8x8 dishes.  I had everything in the pot before I turned on the heat and just kept stirring with a whisk. When there were a couple bubbles I started the 5 minute timer. Not oily at all.

Third time is a charm. I tried making this most of the day. Wish I would have read the reviews before attempting to make this recipe. I tried using the recipe on the back of the marshmallow jar. It was so greasy and felt it seized up soon as I added the chocolate. Had the same problem with this recipe. So, I can back and read several of the reviews. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. 1) don't use too big of a sauce pan 2) it does not take that much butter, I only used 1 1/2 tbl of butter. 1/4 is way too much. 3) this time I did use a Candy thermometer to see how long it look me to get to 234 F, it was about 7 minutes on number 4 dial on my stove top.

Outstanding! This was my very first time ever attempting fudge, and it turned out perfectly. My end result was SO incredibly creamy, it tasted so delicious and the texture was as smooth as could be. I was worried by what I was reading in other reviews, so here's what I did - I only used 1 TBSP of butter. I started the timer for 5 minutes the second I saw small bubbles trying to form under the surface. When the timer was up, I removed the pan from the heat, THEN added the marshmallow fluff and remaining ingredients. I also used Guittard brand chocolate chips (mostly milk chocolate). The result was perfection.

I give a full five stars because it's EASY and not just  melting chocolate chips and calling it fudge.  The marshmallow creme is a good addition.  You can make this with any type of chips. I've done butterscotch, white chocolate, and dark chocolate.  Don't over cook the marshmallow creme though.  It will burn easy.

Really good.  Easy to make.  Followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. Just have the chocolate ready to go. Once your at that point,  move fast to the baking pan, chocolate starts to harden very quick.

After looking over many of the best and worst reviews for the recipe, I will tell you how mine turned out so well. I definitely will save this recipe to make again!
I doubled the recipe. As others suggested, I started heating the evaporated milk, sugar, and butter BUT NOT MARSHMALLOW CREME over a low-medium heat until the sugar was completely dissolved (I used 2.5 cups sugar instead of 3 to cut down the sweetness, and 3 tbsp butter instead of 8 to to cut down the greasiness). I then stirred it vigorously, once it began to boil, for 6 (not 5!) minutes to ensure the fudge would solidify adequately. Then, immediately after removing it from the heat I added the marshmallow creme and chocolate, later the vanilla. The biggest issue I had was melting the chocolate completely: I was stirring as hard as I could for 4 or 5 minutes to fully incorporate the chocolate and creme. Next time I will partially or fully melt the chocolate before adding to the fudge. It definitely helped me, as others suggested, to have ingredients pre-measured well before adding them in: a delay of a minute or so is enough to ruin the fudge.
The results are amazing, the texture smooth and the taste delicious and very sweet. The chocolate flavour really stands out (so make sure you choose a high quality chocolate) and it also has distinctly marshmallow-y taste. Others cautioned against using generic marshmallow creme, but mine turned out fine, probably because I added it in later with the chocolate chips. After

Fantastic - tell you the truth I was going to make a different recipe within here same thing fudge but many made comment it didn't really taste or harden like fudge.
Well let me tell you - this was my first batch while I'm a big gourmet cook - I am not a baker but I needed something for a party and of course they asked me for a darn dessert! 
It was such a hit - easy to make (though the fluff is like cement to get out:) but wow - just great tasting and perfect.  Made it at about 9:30a.m. and it was ready to roll with us at 6:30.  I did add sprinkles due to it being a Christmas party and will be making it again in a couple days for our own Christmas get together.  You won't go wrong with this recipe.

This will go in my recipe book as the best chocolate fudge.  The combination of the milk chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips is what makes this fudge so great.

This is the only fudge recipe I've made for years.  If you get this out of the latest Allrecipe magazine, DO NOT cook for the 6 to 6-1/2 minutes.  Stop at 5 minutes and it will turn out creamy and smooth.  I've added raisins, craisins, & nuts some years.

Ive been making old fashioned fudge my whole life and never had a problem, so I decided to try this recipe since there were so many great reviews. What a total failure and what a waste of money! I followed the recipe to a "T" and had all my ingredients ready ahead of time. Now I have a big glob of sticky mess in the pan that would never set up and to top it all off, it doesn't even taste very good. Ugh...what a waste!

Good flavor. Horrible consistency.  Made it three times.  Two times I timed it and the last time I used a candy thermometer.  Not greasy, but crumbly.

This was the first fudge I have ever made.  Based on the comments I halved the butter.  I also used Aldi brand ingredients.  I turned out great.  My family can't believe I can make fudge.  I was shocked by how easy this recipe was to make even for a beginner like me.

Very creamy. It set well.  Very rich. I read a lot of reviews, and read boil and stir for 5 minutes, for 6 minutes, for 7 minutes- from when little tiny bubbles form and others start timing when reaches a boil. Confused, I settled on halfway between the two and cooked and stirred for 6 1/2 minutes. Very very good. No problem with graininess. Have to confess that I made it as white chocolate fudge, not regular chocolate (I needed to make pink camo colored fudge with swirls so did white.) Still wonderful, and it was a little light brownish colored (I can rate flavor and creaminess.) Reading other reviews I will try next time adding the marshmallow creme after the chips to see if it's any different. Easy and a keeper!

This was first time making fudge, I grow up with a mom that was a jack of all trades.

I did however choose to not to use nuts since my daughter has nut allergies. I will be making more for the holidays.

Awesome and easy. I opted to use less butter...1 tablespoon. Also...didn't have quite 2/3 cup of evaporated milk so I topped off with heavy cream. No idea if this changed anything. As far as cook time...I used a digital thermometer and cooked to softball stage...around 338 degrees. Once the mixture came to a rolling boil, I reduced heat and did not touch it until it hit temp. No stirring at all. Don't touch it. Once at temp, removed from heat. Added chocolate and stirred vigorously until the sheen was gone and the fudge started to kinda set in the pan. Pour into a buttered glass dish and waited impatiently for it to cool and set completely. Everything seemed to turn out quite well. Next time I make this I'm going to sub out 2 cups of the chocolate chips for 2 cups of peanut butter chips and see what happens.

This is a wonderful recipe. Be careful not to scorch your marshmallow mixture though.  I recommend stirring constantly until you reach a full boil being sure to scrape the bottom and sides and turning the heat down to medium once you reach a full boil then stir and scrape about once a minute for the 5min cook.

Made this twice, we love dark chocolate, so we only used Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips the first time (no milk chocolate).  The second time  we use 2 cups Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips and 1 cup semi-sweet, Nestle brand.  The second time it was quite a bit better and smoother, which is due to just having the experience or due to the quality of chocolate. (probably both).

Turns out great every time! I've been using this recipe for years. My friends say that it's the best fudge they've ever tasted. Follow the directions, and don't use generic marshmallow creme.

If you would like PB fudge, just skip the chocolate and add 1.5-2 bags of Reese's peanut butter chips and 1/4 cup of creamy pb.

Easy and good.  I didn't  refrigerate  it.  I  did  let it  sit  out  overnight.  By morning  the grease from the chocolate  chips  was gone.  It was perfect.  Did also  increase  boil  time  to 7 minutes.  Perfect firm smooth fudge.  No grainy texture.

This recipe is AMAZING! However, I would not recommend leaving it in the fridge over two hours. It was really hard to cut. Also, try to flatten out the foil when you place it in the pan. If it's wrinkly, then some small pieces might get stuck on the bottom of the fudge.

This turned out wonderful.  It was smooth, not grainy, and set well.  I tried to ruin it by leaving it on the stove to boil for a "minute" which turned out to be who knows how long.  I suddenly remembered and stirred frantically, it was boiling and no idea how long.  Who cares, it turned out great.  Clearly it's foolproof.

I've made this several times and have had excellent results every time.  Nice soft, creamy fudge. 
If you have problems with it not hardening it could be that you are heating it to quickly.  I use a hard-anodized pot, on my electric stove, with the burner turned on to about 3 1/2-4, and I just patiently wait for it to slowly heat up and start boiling.  I do this every time and it hasn't failed me yet, even when I use the store brand marshmallow cream and evaporated milk.

I made 4 batches of this fudge. The only changes I made were the flavors of the chips used. I made the chocolate fudge as written, Chocolate fudge with pecans, Creme de Menthe using a mixture of chocolate and mint chips and butterscotch fudge using butterscotch chips. This is, hands down, the best fudge I have ever made. The recipe is easy to follow and it is delicious. Everyone that I gave it too begged me for the recipe! I would definnitely make it again!!

I don't understand I followed the directions to a T. I usually make fudge the old school way and I never had a problem. I wanted to try this method to see if I could save time. 

It was all fine then when I put the chocolate chips into the mixture it all of  a sudden got too hard to even stir. The texture immediately looked grainy and greasy. 
What did I do?
I don't get it.

Christmas came and we had so many yummy cookies that I did not make this fudge.  Now the blizzard is here and it seemed the perfect time for some fudge.  I had almost given up making fudge because I kept getting dry fudge with a grainy texture even with different recipes.  I risked a double batch and was not disappointed, it turned out great.  I followed the recipe exactly... EXCEPT I let it cool at room temperature.  I do not know if that made a difference but based on other advice I found on the internet I decided it was not worth cooling it fast and risking the wonderful smooth texture I had when it was warm.  I will totally make this again!

It looked smooth and glossy- like it was going to be perfect....but alas, as others said- it never solidified, even after overnight in the fridge and was too creamy to even get out of the dish.

My first attempt at making fudge and it couldn't have been more perfect! My daughter and I made it to give to family and friends for the holidays. I made it exactly as written however I did double the recipe and put it into a 9x13 glass pan. As always I look to the reviews for tips and suggestions. The ones I found useful were to zap the marshmallow cream in the microwave for 15-20 seconds and to boil the fudge for 7 minutes. The fudge was easy to work with and came out solid yet creamy and delicious. I cut it into very small pieces as a little goes a long way. My mother was the best at making fudge but unfortunately she passed away very unexpectedly last year. We never got her recipe but I do remember her telling me if I could find a fudge recipe with marshmallow cream that would be the best. Thank you for allowing me to continue the fudge tradition for my family!

Very delicious, smooth texture, very rich. Reduced the amount of butter to 3 tablespoons, but could have reduced that amount by 50%

Great texture!  Very smooth fudge.  I mistakenly bought all semisweet chips because they were in the wrong location in the store but it still turned out amazing!  Lots of compliments from friends and family on this fudge.  I made sure to follow other reviewers advice and waited for it to come to a full rolling boil before starting my 5 minute timer, and I stirred it constantly for those 5 minutes.

I made my own adjustments to this version.....I used milk chocolate chips and honey peanut butter with a tad bit of flour to thicken it for peanut butter fudge.....and then i really got creative and did butterscotch chips with the honey peanut butter and a tad bit of flour to thicken it for peanut butterscotch fudge......ooooooweeeeee it's very good but rich :-)

This is the best fudge I ever had. I have never made fudge before in my life, actually I thought I did not like it, because the stuff I used to eat made me choke. This is so good that I don't want to share it. I want it all for myself.  I will be making another batch before Christmas, that one I will share. 
P.S. I made a double batch the first time

very very easy to make. Incredibly smooth/creamy.
I substituted dark chocolate for milk chocolate and got what I would call a truffle fudge. SO good!

This recipe gave me a lot of grief. Since I have a tendency to over/under cook fudge, I blame myself and not the recipe. The first go, the fudge hardened and crumbled the minute I poured the chocolate. It set instantly. I recooked it after cooling with the remaining evaporated milk. After heating on low for a long time, I allowed it to chill. It didn't hold it's shape well and it  was too sticky. The third time I cooked it on low even longer and let it set. After chilling and cutting, I allowed the pieces to air dry for 24 hours. It was not fudge texture (more caramel texture) but I received numerous compliments from family and teachers at my daughter's school. My BIL said it was by far the best chocolate fudge he ever tasted. His grandmother, who loves fudge as well, really like it too. Personally I'm not a big fudge eater. Since those 2 had the equivalent of about 2lbs of fudge (using 4 different recipes), I'll trust their judgement that my failure was indeed a success.

I followed the recipe exactly and out it to be EASY and turn out perfectly.  It was forming as I put it in the pan and was smoothed out easily.  It manages to be firm, but soft, and SO creamy and delicious in my mouth.  I will definitely make it again.

These are the best....easy and so creamy!

I did add 1T of  Karo syrup as another reviewer had mentioned. I made 2 batches, one with nuts and one without. Also I used what chocolate chips I had on hand, dark chocolate and semi-sweet.
Delicious and I am giving these as presents for Christmas.

It was creamy thanks to the marshmallow, but it just didn't have an "OMG" taste when you first taste it. Not bad just...nothing special. It was not greasy, but I can see how after refrigeration it can get softer.

I've been craving these fudge squares for about a week now, today I finally got the courage to make them after reading all the reviews. I started at 10 PM lol and it didn't take too long to finish it was super easy. I saw alot of people mentioning heat to high or seeing lumps so I kept my burner set at 4 about low/med heat. I followed all the directions, i didn't have trouble stirring except when i put in the chocolate chips it got a bit thick but it was perfect i just used more strength.  I didn't really time myself in stirring I usually wing it, but when it looked nice and creamy . I might have taken them out of the fridge about 30 min too early i only cut the top but the center was still stiffening, either way i cut them up and placed on a plate in the fridge again to serve tomorrow afternoon. Great recipe, no problems, no burning, no tweeks,   but i think next time ill add only 1/2 tsp rather than 1 tsp i am not a  vanilla fan.

The best fudge ever!  I've used this recipe for years & it's always a hit.  It's also easy to make.   One tip...have the chocolate chips & nuts measured & ready ahead of time.

I made it. It's great as always. I've been making it for years. I first got the receipe off the label of "MARSHMALLOW FLUFF" manufactured by Durkee-Mower, Inc., Lynn, Ma.. It's always been on their products label and is adjusted to the size container purchased. It's "NEVER FAIL FUDGE".

This is the best fudge. Finding the 'boil' is the tricky part because it boils on the bottom of the pan. When you see the pockets of air on the bottom, start your time and stir like mad!

I've made this a number of times.....never had a problem with it, it was delicious!  I've used store brand chips and  marshmallow crème that isn't a name brand, don't use any special pans, have NEVER used a candy thermometer, or done anything that isn't as written in the recipe.  Can't imagine why anyone has any trouble with it not coming out right..it's super simple!!

Wow, I can make fudge!  Took other's advice and boiled it for 7 minutes and only 1 1/4 cups of sugar.  Tried it out on 4 friends and they all wanted the recipe.  Also used a 9 X 9 pan.  Think the 8 X 8 would make it really thick.  This is the perfect fudge recipe.  I am a fudge Goddess!

I've never made fudge before and decided based on the reviews, that I would give this a shot. This fudge is AMAZING and the reviews are as true as they're written! I cooked it EXACTLY as the recipe called for and IMO there's really no need to tweek anything. If you follow the instructions, they're right on point. I used Hershey's milk chocolate chips and Hershey's semi sweet chocolate wafers since my family loves Hershey's. I used both Hershey bags entirely since they are 10oz bags (smaller than standard 12oz) which was only slightly more than what the recipe called for and it worked out perfectly! The fudge was rich and creamy and tasted wonderful, not too overwhelming. I will definitely make this again but probably try a different chocolate next time to change up the flavor a bit. Thanks Aunt Teen!

I cooked it a little too long but everyone loved it.  They were fighting to take the leftovers, and that doesn't generally happen with my lack of cooking skills!

Made this with my kids for Christmas.  Easy to make and delicious, but omitted nuts because my kids don't like them.   I like nuts, though, so added some spiced pecans by pressing them into the top one section of fudge after I poured it into the pan.  The spiced pecans gave it a Mexican Chocolate flavor that was outstanding.

Crumbly? I took the advice of only using name brand products and still got crumbly fudge. I've made this recipe for at least 5 years and never had this problem and I've always been cheap! Solution? I added my vanilla just as the chips melted and it was perfect! I then added nuts to some batches. It was the same smooth, thick, creamy and not stiff like it was. You don't have to get the expensive stuff to have good fudge. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's always a favorite and I'm now getting orders for it. Perfect gifts!

This is an excellent recipe.  I usually use the sweetened condensed milk recipe from Borden, but it's not really the "creamy" fudge we enjoy, so I decided to try this one.  This is much creamier.  I do not think it's too sweet as others have mentioned.  It was delicious!  This will be my new go to recipe for fudge.

I think this fudge would of better if the marshmallow cream was added last, along with the chocolate chips. I found this fudge to be greasy and very hard.

Best fudge recipe I've ever found. Simple to make and delicious. I've made this several dozen times and its always turned out right. I cant add much to whats already been said in the other comments other than this: the mixture rises and increases in volume during heating. At a certain point it deflates back to its original volume. That's when I take it off the heat and add the chocolate and vanilla extract. It's always right around the 7 minute mark once I start timing. I start the clock once I see three or four bubbles per second form in the mixture. Medium heat. Also be prepared with a very sturdy spoon when you mix in the chocolate.

BEST FUDGE EVER! Made it for Thanksgiving, everyone loved it. So chocolately and creamy! A little more evaporated milk is fine though. Put most of the jar in by accident and turned out delicious! I'm a major chocolate obsessor and I'm telling you, this stuff is revolutionary! :D

The fudge is delicious. I made it twice. My only complaint is that if left at room temperature, the fudge gets too soft. Almost like a very thick peanut butter consistency. I cut these into squares and wrapped them as Christmas goodies for neighbors and co-workers. I had to keep them all refrigerated until I handed them out. Although I really liked the flavor, I think I'll try another recipe that stays firm even in room temp.

This was the first time I made fudge. I made sure everything was set up, measured, and easy to access. I followed most of the directions and used the same ingredients except the nuts. The only thing I did different was to let the butter melt before I added the marshmallow cream. I didn't have a candy thermometer, just started the 5 minutes timer when I started seeing bubbles, stirring it constantly with a rubber spatula. After cooking and spreading in the pan, chilling it for more than 2 hours gave the fudge a good firmness. It turned out creamy and oh so rich in chocolate. I ended up making a second batch right after. Both turned out delicious. Got lots of compliments when I gave them as gifts at the office.

6-1/2 mins at a rolling boil worked perfectly.  For my second batch I added about 1/2 tsp mint extract, and it was not as good as my first batch without the mint. This has become my 14-year old daughter's treat of choice for her friends at Christmas.

I cooked the ingredients maybe longer than the 5 minutes because I wasn't sure when the full boil happened as it had been bubbling, maybe 6 to 7 minutes. It had thickened up a decent amount, maybe I overcooked it? It would have helped if the recipe gave a description of what the consistency should be. Once I added the chocolate chips it immediately crumbled and was in pieces, I pressed it into a pan. Will see how it turns out but it tastes more sugary than chocolatey. Disappointed!

EXTREMELY disappointed in this :( I followed everything exactly, read all the suggestions and tips too and nothing could save this. It never hardened and is just a gummy chocolate mess. I put so much energy and money into the ingredients, I even looked up ways to try and salvage it and tried a couple, but nothing worked.

This was my first time making fudge and it came out perfect :) I couldn't find the Fluff brand marshmallow creme so I bought the Kraft Jet Puffed instead. After reading the reviews I decided to keep the amount of butter the same but used 1.5 cup Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips and 1.5 cup Ghiradeli 60% Semi Sweet Chips instead of 2 milk and 1 semi sweet. I let the pan heat up slowly as I stirred the first ingrediants together and then once it hit a boil I stirred like mad for 5 minutes. Once I poured the chocolate in and then the vanilla it was nice and smooth going into the pan. I let it set for an hour and a half before I tried it. It was set enough that it was easy to cut and get a square out but smooth and melty in my mouth. I had to get a glass of milk, lol. If you are looking for more of a normal fudge taste I would keep with the chocolate the way the recipe states to because with even just doing it half and half like I did you can really taste the semi sweet. It is delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly.  As I stirred in the chocolate chips, it became quite difficult.  I put it in the refrigerator to firm and ended up with crumbly fudge.  I was hoping for creamy smooth fudge.  What a disappointment!  I will be using my old recipe from now on.

I wasn't sure if I was doing this recipe right. I started the five minute timer when I first saw medium size bubbles break, and mixed like crazy while scraping the sides of the pot with a spatula. I pulled it off the heat and threw in the vanilla and it splashed in the heat like crazy, then had only a minute to add the chocolate and have it melt before it became nearly solid. I dumped it in the pan and spread it to the best of my ability, and popped it in the fridge. It turned out really creamy and tasty. I think I will invest in expensive chocolate next time instead of chipits.

This is my second year making this fudge.. just follow the directions exactly as written EXCEPT - I highly recommend roasting your walnuts before adding.  It really does make it just that much more special.

Ok so in my opinion , I found that this recipe is eatable but it didn't give me the melt in your mouth, creamy result I was hoping for. It wasn't overly sweet, equivalent to Hershey's chocolate, that I liked. But just tasted over cooked, and I followed directions to the letter.  Just my opinion.

Grainy crumbly oily mess. I am an experienced baker but have never attempted fudge. Tried this recipe using the tips from other cooks. When I added the chips it began to seize and was difficult to stir. I think I should have pre-melted the chips and maybe that is why it seized up. I pushed it into an 8x8 pan, sprinkled candy sprinkles on top and pressed it in to absorb the oil. Refrigerated it, removed it from the pan, and tried to cut it with a sharp knife. Some pieces crumbled and it did not taste at all creamy like fudge is supposed to taste. I guess I will stick to Rachael Ray's recipe which is not real fudge but at least it is smooth and creamy....not an oily grainy mess like this is.

Took another poster's advice about cooking to 6.5 minutes, and the fudge came out greasy and crumbly.   Perhaps this is why the poster also recommended cutting the butter.  Next time I will try sticking with 5 minutes.

Lesson learned: When a recipe comes with a 4plus rating with 1000plus reviews, just follow the directions:)

This is amazingly creamy without being too sweet.  I made without nuts the first time and with toasted walnuts the second time - both were wonderful and vanished fast!  This is the only recipe I'll use for chocolate fudge!

Delicious fudge!!! I omitted the nuts because I don't care for them. And I used 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate and 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate. Gradually bring to a boil and stir constantly to avoid burning. Yum!!!

I have made this twice and it turned out perfect and delicious! Tips I took from others:
1) add the marshmallow fluff into the pot last in step 2 so it does not burn
2) measure the chocolate chips beforehand, put them into a microwave-safe bowl and melt down a bit before adding them into the pot
3) added a full cup of chopped walnuts.
I poured the mixture into a foil lined 9" round cake pan and put it in the fridge to cool. You can store the fudge in an airtight container in the fridge but it will not last long!

This is my first time making fudge, and I took the advice of many others to use only 1 tbs of butter instead of the full 1/4 cup. I also began on low heat and increased to medium once my first ingredients were entirely melted.  Needless to say, it's in the fridge right now and setting up nicely!

Tasted great. Not sure if I did it correctly though as when I went to slice up the fudge for holiday gifts, it was rather messier than I would have expected. But for my first time, I was pleasantly surprised. I did wait to add the fluff until after the mixture had boiled and gone to the hard ball stage, as someone else had pointed out in an effort to keep the fudge silky.

You will not find a better recipe for fudge. PERIOD! I am a fanatic when it comes to fudge. You will not see me pass a fudge shop with out at least trying a sample of their recipe. This particular recipe is better than any plain chocolate fudge that I have ever had. GREAT Submission!

Followed the tips in the reviews and made this fudge for my "fudge loving" Father-in-law for his Birthday. 
EXCELLENT fudge--he told me that he recently tasted some fudge that tasted exactly the same, only that fudge cost the buyer a pretty $50 for the same amount this recipe makes. :) Would definitely recommend this recipe!

This is a great recipe!  My favorite type of fudge, though, is chocolate-peanut butter.  To make this, I put in a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (2 cups) and 1 cup of smooth peanut butter (I use JIF).  Give it a try...it tastes awesome!

Excellent. We tried bringing the mixture to a soft ball stage (240F) and found it almost to be too hard to cut at room temperature. 230F was perfect though! Excellent texture either way. 230 just helps cutting

I am not really a big fudge person, but this recipe is amazing! I definitely ate more than I should have! I followed the instructions completely. It was super easy and fast. It was creamy and smooth, I can't wait till next Christmas to make it again.

This fudge turned out soooo good.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I had trouble with was getting it to boil.  I'm not sure if it was the type of pot I used but the bottom kept burning.  I actually had to throw out the first batch of milk and marshmallow creme. For the second batch, I  continually stirred the milk, marshmallow creme etc since it never boiled and it turned out totally fine.

This was my first time trying to make fudge and it turned out wonderful! My husband loved it, and I can't wait to make more! I tried what other reviewers said and cooked it for 6.5 minutes instead of 5. Turns out very creamy! Yum.

I've only made fudge a handful of times, but this is the first time I've ever made smooth, creamy and tasty fudge!  I didn't add any nuts, but I did add some instant espresso for more of a mocha flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

Everybody loves this fudge. I have to make and hide a second batch as my boys and their buddies can't keep their hands off it. My Mom used to make this or something similar-I know she used Fluff and anything with Fluff passes muster in New England. I do omit the nuts, as I do from most everything these days because of food allergies and I like plain fudge best anyway. I also mix up which chips I use-seldom use milk chocolate and replace with 60% cacao or Hershey's dark chocolate. You could also use butterscotch. Whatever I use no one objects and it all disappears.

Came out thick and grainy. When I made fudge before it was smooth and flowing. Most recipes on the evaporated milk can or marshmallow jar that are similar to this all say to add the marshmallow with the chocolate after boiling the other ingredients. Maybe that would work, but I think I'll stick to Carnation's very simple sweetened condensed recipe.

This recipe is on the back of Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Cream---it's called Fantasy Fudge and it is delicious. You can even use peanut butter in place of the chocolate morsels--or let your imagination run wild--:) it's easy and always a crowd pleaser.

The first batch turned out perfect. As a topping I crushed Andes mints and put them on top so it would have a chocolate/mint topping.   The second batch was terrible. I think I added too much chocolate at once and didn't stir fast enough, so make sure to add the chocolate a little at a time and to stir fast.

I made this several times last Dec and am making several more batches this year.  It's sooo good and really easy to make.  I have found that I prefer a firm fudge and so I store this in the fridge.  It gets too soft if left out at room temp.

Tastes great. But good luck cutting this into bars. This goopy thick blob once you cut into it sticks to the knife making clean cut bricks impossible. Used all name brand ingredients and followed the instuctions to the "T". Good luck all you beginners at cooking like me.

Followed this recipe to a T-Even used a thermometer to ensure we'd reach soft ball temp, and still ended up with a crumbly mess. Very disappointed, wasn't this supposed to be fool proof, and easy?

I have never made fudge before and this was super easy.  I followed the directions just as they were written and it turned out wonderfully.  I would probably switch the milk/semi-sweet chips around though, but that's personal preference.

Very good! As all melted chocolate recipes make sure you have all your ingredients pre-measured out and you wont have a issue. Also make sure you stir constantly as directed. Very happy with results followed exactly with the nuts!

Very good fudge. I've made it twice so far, both batches turned out amazing. If you like darker chocolate, I would say feel free to use much stronger chocolate chips (the last batch, I used 2 cups Ghirardelli's 60% cacao chips and about a cup of their milk chocolate chips plus a teaspoon of peppermint oil, and it turned out even better than the first time). I would also recommend not taking the fudge off the heat before adding the chocolate chips. It just does not seem logical to me. The chocolate melts much better over the heat and, from what I've experienced, heating it more is not detrimental to the final product. Overall, very sweet, but still very good and easy fudge.

I sometimes put crushed candy cane on top for a minty chocolate flavour and added colour.

I made this recipe again 2 days later with a candy temp & I got the same results; crumbled & never became smooth

so sad.  i followed recipe (cooked for 6 min instead of 5) but obviously i did something wrong. it was hard to mix after adding chocolate chips.  i was able to add the nuts and vanilla, but by that time, it was a big lump of chocolate.  it's in the fridge now, but it is very greasy.  i'm sure with all the great reviews...i did something wrong.  :(

Oh WOW!  I've tried some different fudge recipes for a few years now trying to find the one that makes me feel like an expert baker and this is it!  I cant believe how great this recipe came out and I followed the recipe exactly (didn't use nuts though).   I sent a plate to work with my husband and everyone in his office was raving about it and saying how great it was.  He came home with an empty plate.  Every bite I've had of this has tasted perfect and I'm going to make some more tonight to give as gifts tomorrow.  This is definitely going to be my traditional yearly fudge for years to come.   Thanks so much for sharing!

I made this the other day and it was amazing!!! the texture was lite yet creamy! After reading the other reviews, I decided to let the mixture boil for 6.5 minutes instead of 5. I made other minor adjustments: I added 1 cup of nuts instead of 1/2. For the nuts I used hazelnuts (my favorite). Also, I added 1/2 o.z. of orange liquor.  The liquor was added right before I stirred in the chocolate. I will be making this again for the holidays. I may even experiment with dried fruit like cranberries.

This was amazing!!!  I followed the recipe and only stirred for 7 minutes instead of 5.  This was a huge hit at my party, I had to print the recipe out for everyone there.  I literally made this in less than 30 minutes (including prep time)!

Awesome - this is my most frequently used fudge recipe.  I love the combination of the milk and semi-sweet chocolate.  I always use a candy thermometer when making fudge, so it always turns out the correct consistency.

After trying this fudge recipe, I stop looking for another one. This recipe does yield some sweet fudge, to me it's a little too sweet due to the marshmallow creme and the chocolates, so I've been using only 1C granulated sugar and substitute the milk chocolate with dark chocolate. One time I went with all dark chocolate chip, and it turned out perfect for me.

I am so happy with the way this fudge turned out!  It is melt-in-your-mouth-good.  I bake all the time but this was my very first fudge.  I read at least 20 reviews, starting with the most helpful.  I used a large heavy bottom Calphalon.  I started on low and kept it there until everthing was smooth (I have a glass top  stove and set it on 2). I turned it up to 4 (med-low) and slowly brought it to a boil. Stirring the entire time, it turned light brown as it began to boil, not a hard rolling boil, just a consistent bubbling.  I let it cook like this for 6.5 min.  I took it off the heat and poured in the chocolate and started stirring like crazy.  I used 2 cups Guittard milk choc ad 1 cup Guittard semi-sweet.  I really couldn't stir for very long because my arm was so tired.  Lastly I added 1 tsp. organic vanilla.  What a great recipe, thank you Aunt Teen.  I will definitely make it again.

I had the same problem that another reviewer had, I added the chocolate chips and the fudge turned all crumbly. I think my mistake was cooking it too long. My husband recently relocated the family to his home town where the altitude is 7600ft. I cooked it longer due to the lower boiling point at higher altitudes. I also used my candy thermometer, got it up to 220 degrees but I should have just followed the directions. Maybe adding the marshmallow creme after the cooking was complete would have helped too. I tried a peanut butter fudge recipe last week from the Jif website and it turned out great, it calls for adding the marshmallow at the end with the peanut butter.

easy recipe and delicious fudge. My only advise would be to cook for 6 minutes after coming to a full rolling boil unless you like a super creamy fudge. After six minutes, i was worried because i needed to spoon it out of the pan as it was too thick to pour however after setting it was perfect

I made this fudge for our church fair....added some chopped walnuts.  The next time I make it, I will be sure that all the chips have melted.  It was delicious even though I got a whole chip here and there, and I can't wait to make it again!

YUMMY!  Never made fudge before but I have eatten enough to know that this fudge is WONDERFUL!  I let it sit overnight and it was good but a little sticky.  As it sat out Christmas day it hardened a little and it was soooo good!  Do NOT change anything with this recipie!

I made 2 batches and it was great! Very easy to make and very nice in consistency and taste! I took it to work for a taste test prior to sending it to my hyper critical Mother. Everyone loved it. Don't cook all the way to soft ball or it will get a bit tough to stir. Overall a excellent fudge! Mom will be getting some to make up for this years "other" not so great gift. :)

I wouldn't recommed cooking to soft ball stage as another reviewer suggested.  I did and it was very hard to stir the chocolate, nuts, and vanilla in.  Also, it was very crumbly.  The flavor, however, was great.  Follow the recipe on this one.  :-)

This was  the best fudge recipe I have ever used.  It was so creamy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and the only change I made was using 2 cups milk chocolate chips and 4 cups semisweet because that is what I had.  I kept the heat on medium the entire cook time and started the five minute timer when it was a full boil just as the recipe calls for and it was perfect!

Very good!  this was my first time to make fudge and so I followed the recipe exactly.  I do believe that maybe next time I will use less sugar as others suggested but I am quite please with my first timer results!

I was so looking forward to making this tonight but as soon as I added the chocolate and mixed it in it went very stiff and crumbly in the pot, I couldn't get it out of the pot to put into the dish... not sure what I did wrong but very dissapointed. If anyone has an answer as to what I did wrong PLEASE let me know.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I stirred like crazy when it was time and did not have a problem with greasy fudge. However, I misread the directions and used 1/2 c. butter instead of 1/4 c. It had a greasy film on top but once it was set it was perfect. No grease. I omitted the nuts in this batch but made a second batch with nuts and using the right amount of butter. It set up just as well and tasted just as good. However, the blind taste testers thought the one with the extra butter was slightly better. Go figure. I recommend using a flat bottom whisk (used for beverages sometimes).

This recipe was exactly how I like fudge. It was so creamy and chocolaty. I have never been able to make fudge to where it "sets" but this time it worked! I may have not stirred it long enough though because I had to keep it in the fridge or it would become slightly messy around the edges. But no big deal. I will try again to see if I can make it perfect.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Amazing, Here are my changes...1 1/4 c sugar, 3 T butter, all semisweet chips.  Tried to cook to softball stage on my thermometer (could be broken) and never got there after 7 minutes so I stopped.  I would not suggest going further.  Scooped into pan (didn't really pour in).  I would certainly follow the All Recipes fudge tips!  This recipe turned out amazing, so smooth and creamy.

Delicious! Made the fudge as directed, except didn't add any nuts. Make sure to have the chocolate chips measured early on, so you can put them right in.

Fantastic fudge! This is the second time I've attempted fudge, the first did not work out so well. I invested in a $5 candy thermometer, well worth the money. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

this was my first time to ever make fudge.  It turned out great!  I did use 2 cups semi chips and 1 cup mild chocolate chips and reduced sugar by 1/4 cup and only used 3TBS butter.  They came out PERFECT!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This fudge is fantastic!   I'm not the best cook in the world, but I found this recipe very easy to make.  I was getting tired of dropping $20 to $30 in a fudge shop every time my wife wanted some fudge.  This stuff is just as good as any fudge shop I've ever been to and it's WAY cheaper.  I don't really like nuts, so I just leave them out.  It's so creamy and smooth!  MAKE SOME NOW!!!

I just poured this into the pan and I can tell already it is going to be a winner.   I am amazed how easy it was and it is not a runny slop mess like other recipes I end up using as ice cream topping.    The next batch I plan to use mint chips to make a minty fudge.    Thank you so much for this recipe I am singing to the world that I can make fudge I can make fudge!!!!

I have never made fudge before and I followed this recipe to a "T" and it turned out GREAT!!!  I pre-measured everything and didn't boil the marshmallow mixture for a second over 5 minutes.  It set up perfectly in the fridge and is super smooth.  I will definitely be making this again!

I thought this fudge was very much too sweet and too light in color and turned out too crumbly even using a candy thermometer as was suggested by one person.  Maybe I just didn't have good luck this round but I don't think I will try it again becauase it was just too god awful sweet.

This is a good basic fudge recipe, however, using an 8x8 pan the fudge came out way too thick. Also, next time I will double the chopped nuts.

This fudge was way to sweet.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out smooth but way to soft to be fudge.  It tastes like chocolate icing.

This fudge is creamy and melts in your mouth!  It is more of a milk chocolate fudge which we prefer.  Will definitely make again.

Very Easy! I decreased sugar to 1 cup with no problems. I made a few batched - one batch with 2 tsps peppermint instead of vanilla and added a thin layer of melted white chocolate on top with crushed candy canes - it was my fav!

this recipe tastes good, while cooking and right afterward. However, it just is not firming up enough to cut into squares. I worked quickly, but alas. I may try freezing it a little bit to see if I can get it to just harden to cut up into different pieces. But it certainly tastes good!

First time making fudge, and it turned out fantastic.  I've made several varieties now, just toying with the ratio of milk vs semi-sweet chocolate, and also with nut variety.  So easy and delicious.

I've made this for 2 different Christmas parties and both times it received RAVE reviews! I left out the nuts and instead sprinkled finely chopped candy canes on top. Excellent! Leave it out of the fridge for a couple of hours before serving to achieve the perfect texture.

I love this recipe, it is easy and delicious when it turns out. I made two double batches last year and had great reviews, I made it this year for my Christmas baskets and it did not turn out, it was greasy and all I taste is the chocolate chips.  I know it turned out this way because of an error I made. I will make it again because I know how good it is.  Thank you for a great fudge recipe!

This is my go-to, never fail fudge recipe!  I make pounds and pounds of it to give as gifts at Christmas, and it always gets rave reviews.  The only change I made is reducing the sugar to 1 cup, but I have reduced the sugar in every fudge recipe I have tried, as I like it just a little less sweet.  This is a recipe I have used for several years now and have already started making fudge this Christmas season.  Yum yum!

WOW! I made this fudge yesterday at a Christmas cookie party and it was a big hit! It was my first time making fudge and I could not believe how easy it was. I followed the recipe except I started on low heat and gradually raised it. They were PERFECT! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I did this recipe as said and had no problems. It was my first time too, and I was a little worried. Just sprayed my wooden spoon with Pam before taking out the Marshmellow cream. Added all that to the pan and put it on Med heat stiring the whole time with a few breaks. Once to a boil I already had the chips measured out and dumped those in off the heat and stired away. Poured in to a pan lined with foil only not greased and popped that into the fridge. Couldnt wait too long so i stuck some in the freezer to enjoy faster! YUMMY.... Rich but thats how fudge should be :) Thanks

The taste of the fudge is excellent, but my fudge didn't firm up!  It had the consistency of really thick frosting, even after an overnight stay in the fridge.  I melted it back down and added flour to it to thicken it up.  Delicious otherwise.

This was the best fudge I have ever made! I sent it out on cookie plates to my friends and neighbors and it was awesome! Everyone loved it. And my husband who said he didnt like fudge loved it! I will keep this recipe forever! It was so easy to make. I would just note that you better make sure you have the heat turned off, and if you have propane even remove the pan from the burner before you add the chocolate chips. I could smell them burning a little as I added them into the pot. I put chopped pecans in my fudge! Wonderful, Thank you for sharing this!

Never had it not turn out.  5 min after a full boil... super creamy.. and maybe a tad soft after the refrigerator but just fine. My entire family was dying for the recipe.. Even better than fudge you buy at a fair.  I even forgot the vanilla the last time and it tastes fine... we will see how it holds up later.  I will try putting less butter, but I don't think a 1/4 is much... just did another recipe that had almost 3 times as much... yuck.  Hope I never lose this recipe. Always a great gift at the holidays.  Everyone will rave!  Thanks for posting!!

I did this without the nuts. It was great. I thought I had burnt the chocolate, but it pretty much was perfect. Definitely will use this recipe again

This is a very forgiving recipe - my store doesn't carry marshmallow cream so I just used 7 ounces of marshmallws (about 30 large), which didn't melt very well at first so I had to boil it for longer than 5 minutes, but it still turned out fine! I used store-brand chocolate chips and you can really taste it - next time I'll definitely be using a higher quality chocolate. However, great texture and easy instructions.

Utter disappointment. I followed this recipe to the T. I stood diligently stirring constantly and when I went to add the chocolate chips, it was so thick I had a hard time stirring it. I couldn't stir it to the stage of smoothness b/c it was so thick/crumbly. I had to throw the whole thing away...waste of time and money. Much easier and better tasting fudge recipes out there.

This fudge was good, but not as good as other fudge I've had (Mackinac Island, Wisconsin Dells). It wasn't as creamy/rich/smooth as I had hoped. Still had a nice chocolate flavor and was dense and easy to bite into. I received a lot of compliments from my guests, and would make again.

this really is the best fudge I have ever had. AND I have never recieved more compliments :) I also did mint (used mint chips in place of milk chocolate) and peanut butter (used reese peanut butter chips in place). Mint wasn't as moist but the regular and pb were all the rave!!

This fudge is amazing! My husband made it with some help from me. This was our first time making fudge and it came out perfect. It was very creamy. I don't use name brand. Personally I think generic is just as good. We didn't use a timer. We just went by watching it. I do agree with the fact that once you put in the chocolate you wanna get it mixed up and in whatever dish you will put it in. I recommend a 9x13 because the fudge won't be as thick and will cool faster.

This fudge was really good. Better than many that I have bought at chocolate shops. It does not have that fake chocolate taste like many fudges I have made. It would also make a very good fudge icing. VERY good!!

This recipe, for the effort that goes into it, is amazing. At first, after mixing in the chips, I thought it just tasted like melted chocolate chips and was worried that it wouldn't turn out to be more than just a giant chunk of cold chocolate. I couldn't have been more wrong, though. It turned out to be creamy and delicious. Definitely curbed my craving for fudge. I didn't add the nuts (my own preference), but everything else I did exactly as the recipe states. 5 stars, most definitely!

Very good. I've also made up a few variations of this recipe (maple, mocha, toffee, cherry, etc.).   I've learned through trial and error that it gets grainy if you let it scorch.

WARNING: This recipe is sweet to death!!! I wasn't thinking at all the first time I made it.  Then I realized the chocolate chips are sweet, the marshmallow cream is sweet and why do we need to put sugar?!  But it was too late :(.  I made another batch without any sugar and put 1 cup milk chocolate chips, 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips. Then load 3 quarter cup almond, guess what?! It is sweet enough and didn't change the creaminess.  Why do we have to put so much sugar when it is NOT necessary!!!

This fudge was creamy and delicious! I am allergic to nuts, so I used heath toffee bits instead ... simply amazing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the second time I made it, it burned and I followed directions perfectly. Because it was so scrumptious the first time around, I gave it another shot and haven't had trouble since then!   GREAT FOR FUDGE BEGINNERS!!!!

I used to have MY fudge recipe and lost it years ago.  I have never been satisfied with another recipe until this one.  I omitted the nuts and used a disposable foil pan.

WONDERFUL recipe!  SO easy and cheap and decadent!

First time I have made fudge and this came out so good!  I followed the recipe exactly and having the chips/nuts measured out before the mixture comes to a boil helps a lot.  As in any candy making, stirring often is a must so that it doesn't burn.  I can't wait to experiment with other flavor combos like mint, orange, and pepperment!

This fudge is phenomenal!  I followed the recipe as written, and it turned out beautifully!  Who knew it could be so quick and easy!  I took the time to measure all of my ingredients beforehand to have them ready, so that I didn't have to stop during the cooking process.  I will definitely be using the recipe for years to come!

I've made two batches. The first I changed the ratio of milk chocolate and semi to equal parts of 1 1/2c ea. It turned out great!! Loved it. Next time I tried 1c milk to 2c semi. Not good! It came out grainy and the tasted wasn't nearly as good. I don't understand why such a difference. Maybe bc there's less fat in the semi vs the milk chocolate or possibly there was a slight difference in the total cooking time? My mom used to say to never make fudge on a cloudy day, which it happened to be :) Anyway, I'm going to stick with the equal parts of milk and semi. Hoping to have another great batch bc it was a real winner!!

Delicious flavour, but I followed the advice of others and cooked for 6 1/2 minutes and the fudge was hard and crumbly. I would suggest sticking with the 5 minutes that the original recipe suggested, or maybe trying 5 1/2 minutes...

I made this fudge yesterday and it turned out perfectly!  I followed the instructions as they are written, I didn't change a thing.  As advised by other reviewers, I waited for the mixture to come to a full rolling boil before I started my 5 minute timer, I also turned the heat down a little during that time.  The fudge set up beautifully and was ready to cut after the 2 hours in the fridge. This recipe is a definite keeper!   Thank you!

Mmmm!  I made this dairy-free by simmering 1 1/3 cups rice milk until it had reduced to 2/3 cup "evaporated" rice milk.  I used Earth Balance for the butter and used 3 cups of dairy-free semisweet chocolate chips.

Delicious!  We're trying very hard right now not to eat it all too quickly - it's quite tempting!

Fast and EASY! You canot ask for a better fudge.  I cut the butter to 1 tbsp like others have said and slow boiled for 6.5 min.  Also a few variations that turn out great are to use 3cups of butterscotch chips, or add a few drops of mint extract to the chocolate ones.  YUM!

I made this recipe yesterday morning!  It was really good.  I stirred it from the moment it got onto the stove and it seemed like it took forever to get it to boil.  After about 6 hours in the fridge it was hardened on the top, but when I took it out of the pan it was still very soft.  I cut it up anyways and put in on a plate and put it back into the fridge.  I didn't have milk chocolate chips, so I used 3 cups of semi chocolate chips.  I think I will try a larger pan next time to get thinner fudge pieces also.  My husband and kids all enjoyed it and I will make this recipe again.  I think I will try white chocolate chips and try doing a peanut butter one also.  Thanks for this recipe.

True to the name - this fudge is creamy and delish!  Recipe requests were made after tasting.I omitted the nuts but other than that followed exactly.  This is my choc fudge recipe from this point on!

Great recipe with some tweaks.
1) Get a good quality silicon spatula, you'll thank me later.
2) Get good quality German Bar Milk Chocolate. I like Milka brand, and              Extra Dark Chocolate. Mix the percentage you like.
3) Use whipping cream instead of can milk.

Very smooth and tastes wonderful.

I could not resist trying this recipe after seeing how many rave reviews there were for it. It exceeded all of my expectations! After reading some of the reviews in which people tried various combinations of milk vs. semi-sweet morsels, I went ahead and used equal parts of each. I think it was perfect and it was a huge hit!

My mom made this every Christmas when I was a kid!  I used it most recently to try to duplicate the filling in the chocolate turtle empanadas from On the Border restaurant.  When you bake or deep fry it in empanada dough it gets gooey and pretty close.

I've never made fudge before and this came out perfectly. The only change I made was to use 1 1/2 cups each of the semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips. It was so smooth and rich and creamy.  Easy to make too!  Thanks.

This fudge had a great consistency, and a great taste. I didn't have a candy thermometer, and  I only boiled it for a minute or two. It did not affect the outcome. Next time i would use more semi sweet chips, just as a personal preference. But it was definitely easy. It actually had a better taste the next day. I would recommend this recipe.

This was an easy to follow recipe. I mixed it up a bit. Instead of semi-sweet chips, I used the Andes baking chips.

This was my first attempt at making "real" fudge. I was a bit worried that something would go wrong, but was very pleased with the end result. Everything cooked up perfectly and the fudge was fantastic. Creamy, smooth, and not to rich as to keep you from enjoying it again and again. I will make this over and over. Thanks!!

Fast and nearly foolproof, a very reliable staple for a confirmed choclate lover. I do boil a little longer then called for time simply to firm it up more for easier packaging for my over seas boxes. All of the military persomnnel who have recieved it state that it arrives in great condition but doesn't last long!

While this recipe did turn out creamy and smooth and was easy to make - it does just taste like chocolate chips. I don't feel that it tastes much like fudge and I won't make it again.

Yummy, Yummy!  This was great!  I do have to say that quality of chocolate that use makes a hudge differance in how the fudge tastes. I will definately be making this again every christmas. I think that I may try using peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips to see how that turns out.

This was quick, easy, and came out perfectly.  My three year old helped me make it.  Definately a keeper, and I think the recipe would take add ins well.  Next time I'll use more dark chips than milk chocolate, but that's the only change I'd make for our personal tasts.

This was my first attempt at making fudge and it came out very well.  I made it without the nuts though b/c I don't like them in chocolate.  Any "greasiness" that others mentioned was from the vanilla and absorbed into the fudge as it cooled.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

After trying another recipe and having it fail miserably, I was very relieved after making this fudge. It is the perfect consistency, smooth & creamy and the perfect flavor..rich but not too sweet. I've found the perfect fudge, thanks!

Absolutely amazing. I have never made fudge before and was hesitant thinking I might burn it or it might turn out grainy. This was perfect. I did alter it a little. I didn't have marshmellow cream, so I added about a cup of mini marshmellows and allowed them to melt. I didn't let it boil for 5 minutes (thought it might burn) but made sure the consistency was creamy. Instead of nuts, I added mini marshmellows. Turned out great and was so proud of it, that I gave some as gifts to neighbors.

This didn't work at all for me, but so many others gave it such rave reviews I have to think I overcooked it.  I should have tested with a candy thermometer, and the fact that the lid on my vanilla was stuck firm at the last minute didn't help at all!  This ended up very greasy, although, as someone else mentioned, some of the "grease" did seem to absorb as it cooled.  However, along with being dry from overcooking, the flavor just tasted like chocolate chips ... think I'll go back to my old recipe next time.

YUMMY!! I've made several batches already-giving packages as gifts. Everyone loves it. I've made a batch with one cup of MINT chips in place of the semi sweet chips, and it was very yummy!

So good and so easy to make. I don't have a candy thermometer, so I just guessed at it, and it turned out perfect. Smooth, creamy, and chocolatey. Yum!

This recipe was delicious! I used a little less sugar and butter as suggested and it turned out great. After being in the refrigerator 2 hours, it was very hard and would take out sooner next time. Definitely for the chocolate lover!

I haven't found a fudge in years that I really liked. I finally have found it now. This recipe is so easy and so good. I gave it away at a birthday dinner last night. I will be giving it away for xmas as well. Thanks for this recipe.

This is my 3rd year using this recipe and it receives TREMENDOUS reviews each and every time.  It's creamy, rich,and chocolaty, what's not to love.  I finally broke down and gave the recipe to my Mom due to the overwhelming requests I get to make it each year.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have never attempted to make candy before and this receipe was so easy.  The fudge is soooo creamy absolutely no grit at all.  Plus it's not so rich to where you can only take 2 bites.  The only thing is to make sure you don't leave the fudge in the frige more than the 2 hours because I left mine in over night and it's really hard and kind of greyed. But this is a GREAT RECIPE!!

REVISED:  I made this fudge the other day without key ingredients... stuck in a snow storm and I thought it would be ok.  Wrong.  I had to throw it out.  I'm stuck in another snow storm and made it as directed - MUCH BETTER.  Thank you so much!

This recipe is creamy but I would like it a little softer and not quite so firm. This probably is a good recipe but, I guess I am not a big fan of milk chocolate in fudge.

I made this over the weekend and it was SO good.  It was so creamy and didn't have that gritty texture you often get with fudge. I made one batch plain and the other batch I added mini marshmallows and walnuts.  My husband is not a big sweet eater and he even enjoyed this!I will definitely make this again for Christmas!

THIS IS THE BEST FUDGE EVER!!!  Everyone who has rated this bad obvisiouly did something wrong.  This recipe is so easy to follow, I made my very first fudge using this recipe - I didn't have a candy themometer either.  It was very rich and creamy and perfect. I will make this fudge every year for christmas.  This should be locked away and kept a secret because it's so good, but I'm glad people like to share!!

This was my first time making fudge by myself, and I was so worried that it would turn out horrific, but it didn't. I slightly burned it (I think maybe from not using a double boiler), but since I substituted crushed peppermints for the nuts, you couldn't really tell. :3 I took some to work, warned everyone that it was my first batch of fudge, and it was still gone in a few hours! :3 I was so happy! Thanks for this recipe. I'm going to work at it some more to get it just right!

This was amazing! I did have to boil it longer than 5 min. to reach the right temperature though, so keep an eye on that. It set quite well and my bf said it was the best fudge he's ever had! It's very rich and has a nice deep fudgy taste.

This recipe is wonderful and easy! I used equal amounts of milk & dark chocolate, only because that is what I had, and it still turned out a hit! I was worried because I was not sure if the marshmallow, milk, sugar, butter mixture was a full boil. I only saw small bubbling, but I interpreted that as boil and continued to stir for about 7 minutes and decided to go for it. 

I topped my fudge with white chocolate chips that were green striped and red striped for a more Christmassy look. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!

I thought this was just ok; but I did get good comments on it.  I am really not a real fudge eater.  I probably would like it better with nuts and raisins; but I am the only one that would like it that way in our family, so I don't do it - LOL!

Wow! What a great recipe! I had never made fudge before and decided to give it a shot. This fudge came out creamy and smooth even though I messed up and added too much milk. While cooking i realized I had doubled the milk called for, so in a mad dash I threw in more of the other ingredients to compinsate. It still turned out PERFECT! We thought it was a bit too sweet the first day, so I took half the batch to work to get rid of some. By the second day the sweetness had died down and everyone ate it up! I will be making this often!

I made this fudge last night exactly by the recipe.  It almost taste's sinful.  My husband says it's habit forming and he's not a big sweet eater.
This will definately go in my Christmas tins this year.  I think I will try using more semi sweet or dark chocolate next time.  (just because I love dark chocolate) Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first fudge recipe that I have made and I think it is AMAZING! My family loves it and eats it up all the time. By the way, it's my third time making it and each time has been successful. The only thing is that when you're stirring make sure you stir the edges the whole time otherwise it will burn. This happened to me the second time I made it but it still came out delicious! :D

I took others' advice and stirred in the marshmallow after boiling.  Used 1 cup butterscotch, 1 cup milk chocolate, and 1 cup semi-sweet chips.  Very versatile.

This fudge was REALLY REALLY rich. The 6 year olds I gave it to couldn't even finish one 1 inch square! It also seemed to dry out quickly. This may be a good recipe to add peanut butter to.

I followed the recipe exactly and love the result!  So easy!  Next time I will try using dark chocolate chips or peanut butter chips as others have tried.  This is a keeper - just follow the recipe.  The texture is so smooth and creamy!

Good fudge recipe.  I used equal parts semi-sweet and milk chocolate and the fudge turned out fabulous as I like a richer, darker chocolate.

I have been using this recipe for several years at Christmas.  I usually make at least three batches. It ALWAYS comes out perfect.  Everyone loves it and I get lots of requests for the recipe.  I don't cook the marshmallow cream, I add it with the chocolate chips.

This is the third time I made the recipe, and it seems to get better every time.  I did make one change this time.  Instead of two cups of milk chocolate chips, I put in 1 and 1/2.  Then I put in 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter.  The fudge is out of this world.  I'm going to take some of it to a party tonight, and keep the rest for us!

This is the best fudge I have ever had in my life. Since Im not a big fan of nuts I didnt add them and added toffee bits on top of the fudge and it came out perfect. The texture is perfect and it doesnt stick to the foil either. Great recipe.

The best fudge I have ever made.  It just melted in your mouth.  It was smooth and moist just the way we like our fudge to be.  Thanks for posting this wonderful fudge... I will use this for years and years to come.

I enjoy adding candied red cherries to chocolate fudge for that chocolate covered cherry flavor.  ALWAYS A HUGE HIT THIS WAY!!!!

This is the first fudge recipe I have tried.  After reading MANY reviews, I decided to try it.  Some other reviewers had problems with the fudge going hard really quickly so I decided to melt the chocolate before mixing it with the sugar & butter mixture.  I also added the Marshmellow creme when i added the chocolate.  I have always been told that you don't boil Marshmellow creme because it will crystalize.  So, I would definetly recommend not boiling the marshmellow creme.  The fudge mixture turned out fine.  I thought it tasted like chocolate chips. I like creamy fudge and this was not CREAMY fudge.  Overall, the fudge was okay. I will keep searching for the perfect fudge recipe.

This truly is a GREAT fudge recipe.  Easy, too, for us novice cooks.  I switched the proportions of semi and milk chocolate chips, since we prefer dark chocolate around here.  I plan to make this for everyone *next* Xmas!

I agree with Cookinginflorida.  I felt that the fudge turned out too hard and tasted a bit too much like chocolate chips.  Not really what I had hoped for.  With all of the great reviews, I thought this recipe might be provide an easier way to make old-fashioned fudge.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.

This was the most amazing fudge ever.  Very creamy and not to rich.  Cooked exactly as instructed and the texture was perfect.  I also used this recipe for peanut butter fudge by replacing the 3 cups of chocolate chips for 3 cups of peanut butter chips.  Will make again next Christmas.

I found this recipe 4 days ago, tried it for the first time 2 days ago and have made 2 batches today!! This is my first time making fudge and it was perfect! Everyone raved about how rich, smooth and creamy it was -- tasted much better than store bought ones! I made 2 batches today to give to my kids teachers. Thanks for sharing this great recipe :)

I followed others' advice: microwave the fluff 15 seconds, boil the mixture 7 minutes to make sure it firms up, and switching dark and mild proportions.  I forgot to add the vanilla, so that might have impacted my impression.  It was the easiest fudge I've made.  I've previously had a hard time getting the consistency right, so I was happy that it turned out so well.

It was very creamy and had a nice firmness to it. I think I will add a bit of cocoa to the next batch and a dash of salt. It wasn't as strong of a chocoalte flavor as I like but the texture is worth expirementing with. I used unsalted butter but I may use regular butter and leave out the salt. This should help bring out the chocolate flavor.

This fudge was extremely tasty, and it was so easy to make!  I followed some reviewers' advice and used 2 cups of semi-sweet and 1 cup of milk chocolate.  Well, actually, I used 1 1/2 of both since I didn't have enough semi-sweet.  Either way, it turned out nice and smooth, just perfect!  I love how it wasn't too sweet - I dislike overly sweet things...  I got rave reviews from all my friends.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  I will definitely be making this again.

Do not get turned off by other reviews, just follow the recipe exactly and you will not have any trouble.
Also great if you use Raspberry fluff, and baking raisins.....So Simple.
Give to all the teachers, etc. for holiday gifts. They will love it

I gave this 4 stars but think that is being generous. I read all the reviews and tried to get it "problem free" NOT bloody likely. I too had the problem of when I added the choc chips they COOKED, not melted. the mixture is toooo hot to drop in chocolate like that,it cooks it not melts it. Not sure how so many others say it came out perfect. BUT was not going to  be beaten as soon as I realized what happened I put it back on low heat to try to melt the chocolate, by doing that I think I saved my ingredients. I also had to use 2 cups of marshmallows as marshmallow sauce is not available here in the UK. It never actually poured into the pan it was more like brownie type of consistancy, but now that it is cooled, it cuts ok, a bit crumbly, but is exceptable. Next time I think I will let the sugar mixture cool just a bit OR melt the chocolate in the microwave first then add it to the mixture. so all in all I didn't get the creamy part of this fudge.

Best.Fudge.Ever

This has become my standard fudge recipe over the years.  Stays soft and velvety.

Update: Still awesome. I'm writing this because I'm always surprised to see negative reviews of this recipe, claiming it doesn't turn out due to the recipe. It's not the recipe. Here's the story of how we recently messed up: We had to make it twice this year because my sister accidentally used sweetened condensed milk the first time. She knew something wasn't right while cooking it and ended up throwing it out. It wasn't until I went to get out ingredients for a second batch that she realized her mistake. She's a seasoned baker who made this recipe for years, so nobody is immune from mistakes!

WOW! This is the BEST recipe for fudge that I have ever made! The funny thing is...I used to make this fudge 10 or more years ago and I lost my recipe! I had gotten my recipe from the back of a milk choc. chip bag. Last year I looked on allrecipes to see if I could find the recipe OR one like it. I found some, but they just were'nt the same! I have printed it out and keep it in a safe place!!  Thank you for sharing!!

This is the best homemade fudge I've ever made!  My husband even loves it, and he's not a sweets type of guy.  As my kids and I polished off the first tray, we were pulling out the ingredients to make more!

This was very easy to make and turned out really sweet and creamy. I used macadamia nuts and everybody who tried it loved it. I will try this one again, but next time I think I'll leave out the sugar. The mashmallow makes it sweet enough. Other than that, GREAT!!

This recipe was my very first attempt at fudge and it was so easy and turned out SO good (very creamy and just the right sweetness).  Even my neighbor, the fudge expert, gave me the thumbs up.  Thanks for posting this recipe!!

I made this fudge for Christmas and was very pleased!   The fudge was incredible!-- Very creamy, delicious and received rave reviews from family members!  I will definitely make this fudge again.

I used all milk chocolate chips  (rather than milk chocolate and semisweet)because that was all that I had at home.  Next time I will try the recipe with both milk  chocolate and semisweet chocolate chips.

Wonderful! I was looking for a traditional fudge recipe, but made this instead, boy am I glad I did! This disappeared instantly in a large group of people with 6 other candies to choose from. Super creamy and delicious. I can't imagine what went wrong for some of the folks who had difficulties with this recipe. This is my new fudge standard.

This is a great recipe! It was my first time making fudge, so I was very nervous, constantly adjusting the flame. It came out great, not grainy at all. The second time, I made a double batch in a 9 X 13 pan and was much more relaxed. The second batch came out great as well.

We liked this one. I tried it first when it came out of the refrigerator and wasn't crazy about it, but then we allowed it to warm up to room temperature, and it became really rich and creamy. It was a little sweet for our taste; next time I'll reduce the sugar, but I will definitely make this one again.

Like others, I followed the recipe exactly and it had the consistency of cookie dough when I added the chips. I've made fudge before and never had this problem. I'd like to know how it looked for others - maybe if you add the chips after the mixture has cooled a bit, but the recipe doesn't call for that. Maybe that has something to do with it. Anyway, it was a waste of money for me.

I, too, have never made fudge before.  This recipe worked perfectly for me and I followed it exactly as written.  It was incredibly easy and turned out perfect.  I can't wait to bring it to work tomorrow.  I was also very surprised at how easy it was to clean up afterward- I thought it was going to be a mess!

I tried this recipe a few years ago with really poor results, and decided to give it another shot due to all the really great reviews it keeps getting. This time, it was fabulous, so I suppose my last problem was user error! Delicious fudge and really easy to make.

This was my first time making fudge and it turned out great. I was a little worried when I was pouring into the pan, because it looked like it was going to be crumbly. I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours and cut it and my family loved it. Great gift idea for the holiday as well. Thanks for sharing!

Turned out great and I never cook. It was creamy and delicious. I think I will try reversing the amounts of chips next time. It seems fool proof.

Thank you for making me a fudge maker!! I have tried several batches and NEVER could get it right.  Followed your recipe to the T and I DID IT!  Great taste. Light and starts to melt in your mouth as soon as it hits it.  I kept my candy therm. on hand.  (Just to make sure I wasn't cooking too fast!) Well, for anyone making this DO NOT follow candy therm.  Did not reach 240 degrees. I was skepital.  Went ahead and took off to stove and YEAH HA it was terrific! Thanks!

It had a great flavor- but I had the same problem as a lot of others I read. It didn't hold up. Even after days of freezing, adding corn startch and other things!

I don't even like fudge, but this recipe was awesome! We made it as written, and even substituted peppermint extract in another batch. The recipe was so easy that the kids (2 & 7) made it with a little help!

I followed the recipe, though I probably cooked it for six minutes rather than five, but as soon as I added the chocolate it got really hard and stiff.  It didn't pour into the pan, I had to mash it in, and then after sitting it was really hard and crumbly.

I've made this recipe almost every year, and I only had it flop once (and from what I understand it was more likely the fault of the weather conditions than the recipe). This fudge is awesome, fairly easy, and everyone loves it.

Kelly this recipe is amazing and so easy - Elizabeth proof (confectionary is not my strong point in the kitchen).  I made a trial batch as this is to be my father-in-laws christmas present (I made it without the nuts to see the "raw" fudge as I will be making this in rocky road, nut medley and plain chocolate) My husband despises fudge, I was chopping this up and he had some - with no idea of what this was.  "What is it, it is fantastic?" When I said fudge his response "that cannot be fudge it is too good!"  Thank you for an awsome recipe.

This recipe came out perfect.  The fudge was not grainy. (I had feared using sugar in the past.) I closely followed the recipe and had no problems whatsoever.  The taste is creamy and rich; the texture is firm, yet smooth.  Very good fudge recipe.  This many people can't be wrong!

I love this recipe... the first time I made it I accidentally used 2 cups dark chocolate and left the milk chocolate out. I loved it so much I've never added it.  Try using a bittersweet goumet chocolate (I use 70% Valhrona) and I guarantee it won't taste like a hershey's bar.  I've also tried melting 7 oz mini marshmallows and it works fine. This is my perfect PMS food.

I made this one during the holidays and (UGH!) gained 5 pounds. It was really easy to prepare and can't wait till Christmas '05 to endulge in some more.

This turned out very well and was really easy to make. The texture is wonderful; creamy and smooth. I used all semi-sweet chocolate instead of the milk chocolate (so it wouldn't be too sweet) and was very happy with the result.

This turned out great; it firmed up nicely, was very creamy and had a perfectly smooth texture... but my goodness was it rich! I could only eat a bite or two before I'd had enough. 

I will make this again, but next time I may reduce the amount of sugar! Thanks!

i made this fudge last afternoon, and it was definitely a hit at home! my boyfriend, who isn't really fond of chocolate, ate a few pieces.

The recipe is not too sweet, it's just the right amount of chocolate!

thank you so much! it was fantastic!!

WONDERFUL!  I am not a fudge person and I loved this.  The milk chocolate chips really helped smooth out the flavor and this got tons of rave reviews from friends.  Thank you so much, this one is a keeper!

I love this fudge recipe but I do use 1 cup of peanut butter chips and 1 cup of the milk chocolate chips instead of 2 cups of the milk chocolate chips. This way it was not as rich as yours but thank you for sharing this fudge recipe. My family loves it I gave it away for Christmas. I also have shipped some to my neice who was serving in Iraq, she loves it.

After two batches of failed fudge using a different recipe, I found this recipe.  I quickly and easily produced a batch of perfect fudge!  It was smooth, creamy, and delicious!  All my Christmas company raved about it.  Now if I could just figure out how to remove the calories. . . ;-)

For the 3rd year, my teen daughter has made this for a Christmas treat for her friends.  It is simple and consistently good.  The fudge is rich and creamy but not too soft.  It's now our "house" fudge recipe.  Thank you!

Very good and super easy. I did as some other reviewers suggested and cooked it at a full boil for 6 mintues but I found I had to cook it on medium heat in order to reach a boiling point. Thank you!

I just thought this was okay.  I think I like the traditional fudge much better.  I may make it again because of the ease but I kind of doubt it.  Sorry.

Flavor was good, but the texture was not like fudge. It was too soft. Still looking for the perfect fudge.

This is very good.  Very creamy and sticky texture.  Best to keep in fridge or it gets too sticky.  I added 1 cup of nuts.  Will probably make again, it's very easy.

I followed the instructions and alls I came up with was pieces of burnt evaporated milk from the boiling and a watery substance. I use the Emeril ware and I don't understand why this didn't turn out. Glad I did not double it!

First time fudge maker.Very easy.I made a double batch and I stirred it continually even before it came to a boil and quite a bit after adding chocolate to incorporate air.For this amount of fudge I needed to put it in a professional bakers half size baking pan (I bought it at Walmart).

This has a very good flavor.  However, I think I cooked it for a bit too long, as my fudge ended more solid than creamy.  I used toasted almonds in this fudge, which added an excellent flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.

I never made fudge because it seemed to difficult. This was not only easy but the best fudge I've ever had. I used a bar pan instead of an 8X8 like someone suggested and I'm glad I did. It's not so thick but definitely creamy. I sprinkled pecans on top instead of mixing into fudge. Thanks for the recipe! It's terrific.

This was okay, Mine turned out really hard, so it just tasted like a chocolate bar. I covered it too.  I thought it would be softer.

This fudge is soooo good.  It is creamy and delicious, but I couldn't get it to set.  Reguardless, it was super good with spoons!  Thanks for sharing it, Kelly!

FANTASTIC!!!  I forgot to add the butter until the end so it wasn't included with all of the other ingredients while boiling.  Not sure if it made a difference or not.  This was the first time I ever made fudge and I will continue to use this recipe and only this recipe in the future.

Very pleased with this fudge. Everyone really liked it. I used a high grade of chocolate and it made a big difference. I only gave it a 4 star rating because I know there has to be a grander recipe out there, though I have not found it.

I made this last Christmas and it was awful. I followed the directions and it never set up. I tried to deep freeze it and after 24 hours it was still runny. Its flavor was ok, but not much good for anything unless its gloppy, runny icecream topping. I was really wanting this to work and so dissapointed when it failed. I don't think I will make this again, but if I do I will let you all know if it turns out.

This recipe was fantastic.  I followed it exactly and and it truly deserves the 5 star rating.  I could hardly wait the two hours suggested to cool but I did.  It is still a little soft so I'm hoping a few more hours in the fridge will make a difference.  I really want to thank you for this awesome and easy fudge recipe.  My son wanted to know if I could make it more often.  I will be that's for sure.

This recipe is ridiculously simple and delicious!  Is there a way to make a dark chocolate version that's just as smooth?

Even people who claimed to not like chocolate desserts couldn't keep away from these.  They melt in your mouth and are so easy and fast to make.  They were a hit and I'll make them every Christmas!

This was the first fudge I tried and WOW what a great recipe.  We had some other fudge given to us at Christmas and it was much more sugary.  This is smooth and hard to resist!  A real keeper!

This is sooooo easy to make and yummy.  Everyone was impressed, wanted the recipe!  I hate to let them know that I didn't put my heart and soul into it.  A child could make this fool proof fudge, and will be making it over and over again!!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I've made several batches, all turning out perfectly chocolatey and creamy -- like fudge from the Jersey Shore!  Not kid friendly only because no fudge is -- too hot when boiling.  This is a keeper!

I really like this recipe.  Never made fudge before so needed something easy and was really hoping for sucess.  I got both!  I used almonds and was a huge hit.  This fudge sets up nicely.  I didn't ever have to worry about it getting too soft when out.

This is literally the best fudge I have ever had.  When I am out in the world and I buy fudge somewhere, I always think "this is good, but not as good as this recipe".  I am going to try making this and pour the fudge into Christmas cookie cutters to give as gifts...hope it turns out.

What a wonderful recipe!  Not only was it quick & fast but my 12, 13, & 14 year olds have made it with great success.  
I made it for thanksgiving as a new desert & it was gone that day.  We enjoyed it more then the turkey.  LOL  Then my kids made it.  Now it's time for Christmas & I had to print a new copy for my recipe book.  Thank you!!!!!!!

Easy to make and reminds me of what they used to call "Fantasy Fudge".  I have never had the Jersey fudge, but it was better than my other recipe from last year.  Thanks.

I just joined Allrecipes due to this very recipe!  Just made fudge for the very first time.  Its in the fridge chilling now.  The consistency is excellent and I'm sure it will be wonderful once its set.  From first taste I question if it will be as good as Jersey shore fudge.  Either way, I'm sure I won't be disappointed!  Yummy!

Easy - Very good. I have made this a dozen times over the past 3 years! I haved used all milk chocolate chips too and it sets up fine. Also try adding 1/4 of a cup of diced dried cherries - it flavors the entire batch of fudge! A doubled batch does not work well and do add the vanilla at the very end of the texture will be "off."

My family and friends could not stop eating this fudge.  Everyone said it was soooo rich and yummy!  It was my first time making fudge and I found it rather simple.  A definite keeper.  Just make certain to have LOTS of milk near by!

This is by far the creamiest fudge ever. This recipe was my first attempt at making fudge. My hubby (a true fudge connoisseur) liked it so much that I've made it 3 times already. It's so easy to make.

THIS WAS A WONDERFUL RECIPE, MY WHOLE FAMILY ENJOYED IT AS WELL AS FRIENDS. IT MADE GREAT HOLIDAY GIFTS IN GLASS CANDY DISHES WITH LIDS. I PUT A WHITE PAPER DOILIE ON THE BOTTOM OF EACH CANDY DISH I GOT FOR A BARGAIN AT DOLLAR TREE! WOULD BE GREAT FOR VALENTINES OR NEW YEARS GIFTS TOO! EVERYONE THOUGHT THIS WAS CREAMY AND GREAT AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF I FORGOT THE VANILLA AND I HAD A KID IN THE BATH INCIDENT WHILE I WAS MAKING IT AND IT STILL WAS GREAT! I WILL MAKE SOMEMORE TODAY BEFORE I START MY GET IN SHAPE PROGRAM FOR THE NEW YEAR!!THANKS KELLY!

This is the creamiest fudge I've ever had! So easy to make also. This will be a Christmas candy staple for years to come.  Thanks Aunt Teen!
