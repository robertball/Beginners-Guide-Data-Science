These took longer than sugar cookies and only the dogs would eat them after all that work.  Made good dog treats for a while though!

This recipes is  spot on. Use a little ingenuity if the dough is too thick or too thin. Great NYC bow tie recipe.

This recipe was good. Make sure you take the cookies out just as they are turning brown.

Oh, and these are not suppose to be sugar cookies...so, not surprisingly, they are nothing like sugar cookies.

These were really easy to make.    It was still sticky so I didn't twist them.    They were delicious.

I don't know how anyone rolled the dough. Way to sticky to even handle. Followed everything to the letter.
