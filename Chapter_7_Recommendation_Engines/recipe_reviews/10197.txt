This recipe is great! I dries hard like it should. But i actually added another cup of powdered sugar to get the consistency i wanted. (as is it comes out runny) I also added a tsp of vanilla instead of the lemon, and it still came out good. I will definately use this recipe again and often!

I used this icing to put together a gingerbread house (made with real, heavy gingerbread) and it worked wonderfully!  It hardens quickly so your house will stay together, but you need to keep it in an icing bag or covered so it doesn't dry out in the bowl.  Oh, I also left out the extract, which doesn't change the icing at all except for the taste.

I used this icing on rolled sugar cookies with great results.  Yes, it was a little runny, but rather than adding more powdered sugar, I just used my pastry bag with a small round tip to pipe the icing over the top of each cookie, creating a beautifully finished look when dry.  The icing took a few hours to dry completely, but was indestructable after that.  Stored/froze well and tastes yummy; the lemon adds a nice flavor!

This is a good recipe.  If it's coming out runny it's because you're not beating it enough.  I let my mixer go for 5 minutes and beyond until I get peaks. It's shiny and tastes good too.  By the way, did you know you can actually freeze royal icing?  Just thaw and beat again and it works great.

This was a great icing recipe...I was looking for a keeper to use with my sugar cookies (The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site by the way are the BEST...)  This recipe worked GREAT with the pasteurized egg whites that come in a carton from the egg section, I was making cookies for my daughters pre-school class so regular raw egg whites were out of the question.  I did add a 5th cup of powdered sugar as I wanted a stiffer icing.  Worked and dried beautifully...thanks!

As others have mentioned, it's a bit runny. If you're using it as gingerbread house glue, don't put it on too thickly, or else it takes very long to dry (just like real glue)! I'm thinking that it would be best to use this icing mostly as glue and then maybe a fluffier icing for decorative iced accents. As far as decorating gingerbread cookies, though, it worked quite nicely! You can dip them in it (like someone mentioned for biscotti) or decorate them with it, or both. I posted a photo of my cookies and the initial stages of our very-sloppy gingerbread houses in my Cook's Photos.

This is a great recipe.  I used 1/2 cup pasteurized egg whites from a carton. If your icing is too thin, it's not because you do not have enough powdered sugar, it's because you need to beat this type of icing for A LONG TIME.  I beat mine for about 5-7 minutes on high to get to a "flooding" consistency and about 8-10 minutes for "outlining" consistency for decorating cookies.  Just keep beating...it will thicken up.  This is a meringue icing...JUST BEAT IT!!  ;)

Recipe is quite misleading - I ended up using over a pound of confectioner's sugar to make it stiff enough to pipe onto gingerbread people to adhere decors on.  Maybe if I were to ever use this recipe again, I'd use just one egg white and take it from there.  I had a LOT of waste after adding all that sugar to stiffen it up.

I was just shy of 4 cups of icing sugar, but I had already cracked the 4 eggs needed to make a whole batch.  I didn't want to waste them, so I added them all anyways.  At first the icing was really runny, but it started to harden fairly quickly after I applied it to my gingerbread cookies (Eileen's Spicy Gingerbread cookies from this site).  Even using your standard ziplock sandwich bag to apply the icing it went on smoothly.  I was quite impressed with this recipe overall!
I used rum extract (artificial) instead of lemon, but I think next time I may try the lemon or maybe almond or vanilla.  Two thumbs up!

This was my first time using Royal Icing.  I found this icing very easy to use for spreading as well as piping.   Used vanilla extract and it tasted great.  Took several hours to dry completely so they could be packed away.  Used to decorate pumpkin cut-out sugar cookies that were then mailed to my husband Saudi Arabia.  Cookies held up very well in shipping.  Definitely recommend.

This icing is really simple and good. When I made it, it was a little runnier than I had expected, but the taste was still fantastic.

Add about 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar if you're looking to use this icing as a glue. It will hold much better.

This worked great, didn't take too long to make, spread very easily, added some food coloring and it make the perfect little xmas gingerbread cookies! Lemon complimented the ginger. Good recipe.

I think the mixed results for this recipe are due largely to to undefined size of egg. There is a big difference between small and jumbo size eggs and all the sizes in between. This recipe probably works very well with small eggs, but if you are using larger eggs you should take the increased volume of egg into consideration and either reduce the egg count to 2-3 or plan on increasing the sugar content.

This recipe is to close to regular icing.  It didn't hold up my Gingerbread house.  If you are making a gingergread house, your icing recipe should call for cream of tarter.  It is the key to turning your icing into cement quickly.  Learned this the hard way, hope it helps!

This recipe was awesome!! I haven't worked with Royal Icing in years, and the last time I used it was after someone else made it. I whipped the dickens out of the egg whites and they were nice and airy when I added the confectioners' sugar. I was concerned at first because the batch was really really thick. But after I piped a few cookies, I watched out the batch did the glazing affect and it was pretty cool to see that it smoothed out as it harden. I think the lemon was a nice touch, but am thinking of using this again with a different flavor or extract. And going to attempt using a sugar alternative the next go around to see if I can make this sugar free. Thanks so much. This is a keeper for me and my future cookies.

Great glue and icing for our gingerbread house!! I read other reviewers thoughts and used 3 large egg whites and 4 cups of confectioners sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and a dash or two of cream of tartar. PERFECTION. And the first time too!! (to pasteurize egg whites- slowly stir the egg whites with a whisk over a double boiler until they are warm to the touch but not too long!!)

The first time I made royal icing, it was definitely very runny, but here is the secret!!! The longer you beat your egg whites, the thicker it will be. The solution is not to add more icing sugar! Eggs whites will eventually turn into a thick foam, like shaving cream. You don't want your egg whites that thick, but just keep beating them! Trust me!

This recipe served me well as I had no meringue powder to work with. I found it took a really long time to dry, though. I used it to frost the melted snowman cookies which it was perfect for, but I couldn't see using it for anything like a gingerbread house.

We used the frosting for cut out sugar cookies.  I found the easiest way to use this is to put the icing in a ziplock bag and cut a very small part of the corner off.  It is much easier (and less sticky) to spread the frosting around.  This way, the sprinkles are the only really messy part of decorating!

This is a good recipe.  I do cake decorating and it's a variation of those which use merengue powder (in place of the egg white in this one).  Because I had a can of powdered egg yolk in my cupboard, I used that in place of the fresh egg white in this recipe.  I figured I may as well try. (water is added to the powder to create the white)  I made half a recipe of the frosting and it was plenty for my 4 doz. gingerbread men.  Just a tip; make sure to cover the bowl when not using the frosting and also use a moist cloth to put the tip of your bag in when not frosting the men - the frosting will start to harden and it will be difficult to use.

Easy recipe to use for decorating!  I opted for vanilla flavoring instead of lemon, and also made some with mint extract.  Next time I need to get a peppermint extract instead of the mint extract (A mixture) though because it tasted like toothpaste!!

The rating for this recipe was so good I didn't even bother reading the reviews--and I was super disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and it's just as runny as the reviews say; and was pretty useless for making a gingerbread house (which is what I was making).   I tried several times to construct my house with it, but the icing slid right down the sides and didn't even come close to filling in the natural nooks and crannies of the gingerbread--maybe some better bakers than me know how to make gingerbread houses with perfectly straight-edged pieces that would hold together with this icing. And you definitely can't do any decorating with it.  I suggest using Royal Icing III by Veronica. It was the perfect thickness to be manageable while still setting fairly quickly.

AACCKK!  Not sure what we did wrong but this came out SUPER runny and was incredibly hard to work with.  We were hoping it would be a thicker toothpaste-type of consistency to use in assembling our gingerbread houses, but it was so thin and runny.  What a mess!

My eggs must be grade F lol because my icing turned out very runny. It was fine though since I didn't use it for gingerbread houses. We used it to decorate gingerbread cookies.

First time followed amounts and had to add a lot more powdered sugar. Second time halfed the egg whites and simply kept adding sugar till I got the thickness I wanted. Love how fast it hardens.

I had to alter this a little bit to make it thick enough. I used 2 egg whites, whipped really well, then added 3+ cups of powdered sugar.

Perfect icing for my gingerbread men.  Like other reviewers said, it made a TON of icing.  I decorated probably 50 gingerbread men and didn't even put a dent in the icing.  Easily 1/3 it or 1/4 it.  I also used a pasturized egg white product from the refrigerator section near the eggs, so I wouldn't worry about the kids.  It worked quite well.  It may have been more runny because of this - next time I will make it thicker.  Hardened up perfectly though!

Great recipe.  Makes way too much if you are decorating Gingerbread Men.  Use the smallest decorator tip you can find because the icing is runny.  (We used a 3, next time I will try a 1 for the small sized cookies.)  The icing dried nicely and we loved the addition of the lemon extract.  This will be our standard icing from now on!!

I thought 4 egg whites was too much -- I used 2 egg whites and came out great.  It was perfect for our gingerbread house and held the pieces up well.  Doesn't taste good though - good for something like a gingerbread house where you just need it to be more strong than tasty.

This is a nice icing for cookies. I tried to make it for assembling a gingerbread house but even with adding cream of tartar to hopefully thicken it it was still to runny. I will keep this recipe for cookies.

This was my first time making royal icing. I followed the recipe exactly, but substituted the lemon juice with vanilla instead. The result was a very runny consistency so I ended up having to have more confectioner's sugar until I got a workable consistency. I used the icing to pipe my sugar cookies for a birthday party. In the end, my cookies came out beautifully and everyone enjoyed them. However, I would definitely suggest adding more confectioner's sugar to thicken up the icing.

This turned out great.  I was in a really big hurry so I didn't measure anything.  Just threw the three ingredients in and mixed it up until it was a smooth consistency.  I thought I had made the icing too thick but it turned out perfectly.  We constructed 4 gingerbread houses with about 3 cups of icing.  The icing took about 5-10 minutes to set up and hold pieces of the house together.

Wonderful! This icing was nice and thick and perfect for our gingerbread men! It was so thick I had to spoon it on and spread it with a paintbrush. It dried quickly too! It was drying as I used it and I think it was completely dry in about 5 hours or so. It was PERFECT for making tye-dye effects too!

This is a great royal icing. It made excellent decorations for my gingerbread men. We used other types of extracts to give our icings different flavors (like vanilla and almond) and added more sugar to make the icing stiffer so it didn't run when we put it on the cookies. Definitely add more sugar if you're putting it on gingerbread houses!

So easy and so perfect!  It dried quick enough and stayed hard, unlike other cookie icing recipes I've tried.  I was only planning on doing some piping on the cookies so I reduced the recipe by half.  I used vanilla extract since I didn't have the lemon, and used 2 egg whites and 2 1/2 C of the powdered sugar, as per one of the reviews.

Excellent frosting: spreads nice, dries fast, won't crack or melt. 
You can make interesting variations by adding food coloring and/or different extracts like vanilla or almond. Thank you!!! :)

Great recipe! I used powdered egg whites which worked well. I had to add some powdered sugar to thicken it for piping and finishing my gingerbread house but used it "as is" to spread on sugar cookies which my kids added sprinkles to. Will def use this again!

After using up the store brand icing that came with the gingerbread house, I needed to make a quick icing to finish up the house so I chose this recipe but replaced the lemon extract for vanilla and it was fantastic!!!  The consistency was perfect, I did add just a little bit more of the conf. sugar but it was great to work with, not runny at all, just thick enough to spread!!  Thanks for the save!!!

This is a great recipe!!!! I made it two different ways: the original--and I'll be sticking to that.
But I also made anise cookies and wanted to frost them, so instead of using lemon extract, I substituted black liquorice liquor. It came out great!!! Thanks for the post!!!

This icing was exactly what was needed to decorate our soft gingerbread men and also for decorated sugar cookies! I don't care much for lemon so I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract to the icing for a nice flavor. The kids used spoons to pour icing on the cookies, then the decorations. It did harden nicely and the cookies ended up looking almost too good to eat! Thanks for the recipe Diane!

WAY too runny -it came out of my icing bag like water. Be prepared to either add one less egg white or a lot more sugar. I used this recipe to make snowflakes for a cake and after adding a lot more sugar to the icing, the snowflakes turned out fairly well. I would use this recipe again, although with more sugar.

This recipe turned out great! A tip I learned from cake school, never use plastic while making royal icing as it breaks the icing down. Also just beat at high speed. It will stiffen in about five minutes!

I realised that I left my meringue powder at my parents' home and was at such a loss, until I found this recipe that is :) I used vanilla instead of lemon for my Valentines Day sugar cookies, worked great!

For this recipe I added 1/4 tsp baking powder and mixed again at high speed. If it dries out too much just add a Tlb of milk.

Used this for icing sugar cookies and it worked beautifully. I used vanilla extract, as that is what I had on hand, and it was delicious. This will be my go-to sugar cookie icing.

Worked like a charm.  The addition of the lemon extract adds some flavor that other royal icings lack.  Now, if I could just get some patience and decorating skills.......

Finally found the recipe I have been looking for!  I knew it had egg whites but wasn't sure what else and yet its so so so easy.  For my tastes I used vanilla extract, but I loved the consistancy, how easy it was, and the flavor.  This is the one for me forever!

This ended up being the perfect consistancy for "dipping" cookies to adhere sprinkles or sparkling sugars, but if you wanted to pipe this it would need a considerable amount more powdered sugar.  It was waaaay too thin for a piping bag.  It doesn't specify what to do with this icing after making, but I always believed true royal icing to be a much, much thicker consistancy.

For gluing together gingerbread houses I had to use a total of 6 C of confectioners sugar, and I probably should have used 7. I can see how this would be good for making a hard glaze on sugar cookies, but it didn't work for us as a glue.

This was my first time making Royal Icing. I made lingerie shower bra/panty cookies and the icing worked very well. I painted the cookies with a silicon pastry brush and the icing smoothed out without a problem (no brush marks). I piped dots around each cookie without any issues. The icing was a little runny at first but once you let it sit it'll thicken. Also I kept a damp cloth over my icing bowl when I was not using it to keep it from hardening.

This icing was great on my gingerbread cookies for Christmas...it dried quickly.  The only thing I would do is add another 1/2 to 3/4 cup confectioners' sugar after beating the mixture at high speed.  After making my first batch of icing, I saw that the it was a little runny; by adding the extra confectioners' sugar, it stiffens it up some. It had a nice light lemony taste to it to, which went great with the gingerbread cookies I made this past year.  Also, if you are adding food coloring to the icing, I would add a little more confectioners' sugar after doing that as well...thanks, and I will keep in my recipe box to make in the future! :)

This recipe was super easy.  I used almond extract instead of the alcohol and used the frosting to decorate individual brownie bites with a ganache frosting I made (also from this site).  I'll definitely use this again!

My 11-year old prepared this and it came out excellent.  We used food coloring to make differenct colors and then iced our "Busia's Cutout Cookies" from this site.  When preparing, the icing will have a distinct lemony flavor. However, when the icing hardens much of this goes away.  That is good, because the lemony flavor was just a bit too much for my 8- year old son.

This recipe does super!! Definitely sift your sugar before mixing! I used 1/2 cup of pasteurized egg whites and 2 drops of almond emulsion instead of lemon. I mixed up everything by hand first, then put it into the mixer for 5 minutes to soft peak. Then, for piping outlines I used it straight. For flooding I added a teaspoon of water. I used gel food coloring. I agree with the comments that if your consistency is wrong then you did not beat it long enough. Cover your bowl with a damp cloth when not in use because the icing will dry quickly if you do not cover it.

I've used this recipe a lot and love it. We've used it to decorate sugar cookies for both Halloween and Christmas and also for gingerbread men and houses. I followed the recipe exactly for the sugar cookies. For the gingerbread, I used vanilla instead of lemon extract. Just for personal taste preferences. :)

I've found that to get it strong enough to hold heavy gingerbread houses, I needed to let the mixer go for about 6 minutes after I added the sugar to the eggs. For "flooding" a sugar cookie, it needed to mix for more like 4 minutes. If it's coming out too thin and taking a while to get hard, it's because it needs to mix longer. 

As others said, it's best to keep what you aren't using in a ziplock bag or another airtight container or it will get hard.

I wanted to make Christmas cookies with the kids and found this one. This was great recipe. I read reviews and used one less egg and beat it for a long time. It was delicious and easy. I was a little afraid that I would mess up or not like it because of the raw egg, but I ate WAY to many cookies over my Christmas holiday.

I would half this recipe...as it makes A LOT. I found I had to add a bit of water to loosen it & then a bit more powdered sugar & it was the perfect thickness. I also skipped the lemon extract & used vanilla which tasted great!

it was good. Yes rather runny but hardened perfectly after being left on for a few hours. I made my own powdered sugar by putting it in the vita mix it worked very well. I also used it on sugar cookies and added sprinkles. Yum we all enjoyed them

This was an easy recipe and hardened perfectly.  Just refrigerate and use later if you don't want the extra to harden.

I give this a 5 stars for decorating sugar cookies....it is runny if made as instructed and can't imagine it would be good glue for a gingerbread house.

I used this as a base and made some modifications.  I had 3 egg whites left over from another recipe so I planned to use 3 cups of confectioner's sugar (1:1 ration for you math people).  However, I found it a bit runny so I added another 0.5 cup to get to the consistency I wanted -- plus, I didn't want to wait forever for the icing to dry.

I also added almost one cup more powdered sugar as this was for school and I thought it would hold the houses a bit firmer while it dried. Used the pasteurized egg whites, worked great. Used vanilla in place of lemon since I had it on hand. Two thumbs up!

I didn't have any trouble with this recipe. I followed the recipe, except I used vanilla extract instead of lemon. It worked fine, and I didn't have any problems with runny icing. Maybe it's because I beat the egg whites for a long time? 
Well, great recipe. Tasted great, too.

Exactly what I was looking for to drizzle over persimmon cookies!  I've made it a couple times, but substituting vanilla or orange extract for the lemon extract.  Hardens up nicely overnight!

I cannot get over the consistancy of this icing!  I was like marshmallow!  And the shine was perfect!  I'm using it to glue my gingerbread houses together so I added an extra cup of sugar.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe for cookie decorating. I did need almost 6 cups of powdered sugar to make it the right consistency for a piping bag. Tasted great, but do make sure to cover it between uses/colors so it doesn't harden.

I have never reviewed anything here but this recipe changed that.  This is perfect iciing.  We just constructed our gingerbread house with it. I have always been a disaster with piping icing but this stuff made all the difference. It went on easily and smoothly and is drying quickly as I type.  

I had to come back and add, I did leave some of this covered (laid saran wrap over top touching the icing so it wouldn't dry out) and when I came back to use it later is was much more runny and more difficult to use.  So my advice is to use it as soon as you make it.

I am an utter cookie decorating novice and had a few technical problems decorating my gingerbread stars (filled my piping bag WAY too full, had Royal icing up to my ELBOW!) and husband wanted to know how much I'd had to drink before I decorated them but the icing is easy to make and made even my wiggly splodges look pretty good!

I actually really liked this icing a lot.  I used it to glaze gingerbread people.  The only thing is that it makes a TON TON TON of icing.  I didn't think ahead and just made the whole recipe.  I could have cut it by 1/4th or even 1/8th and still had a tad of leftover icing.  One tip I have is to just use 1/2 of the vanilla extract.  I was not looking for a "flavorful" icing- just a pretty one that would be very decorative and not detract from the flavor of the cookie underneath.  This is it.

Fantastic.  Maybe a little less yummy then just plain powdered sugar and milk, but so wonderful the way it hardens and stays on!  No need for wax paper between cookies :)

Excellent recipe for decorating cookies.  It is a little runny, but works great with a small decorator tip.  After storing all my cookies together in large containers, the icing stayed in place! No chipping!  I will use this recipe every Christmas.

I found this recipe to be outstanding.  It was easy, quick, and the perfect consistancy for what I was making.  Thank you Diane for sharing this icing recipe, I will use it often.

So easy and turned out fantastic! I used vanilla extract instead of lemon. One batch was more than enough for all of our Christmas cookies!

I used 1/2 cup of Bob Evans Egg whites to have a safer frosting. I needed to add more powdered sugar 1-2 cups more. But it worked very well with my heavy homemade gingerbread. The house held together but didn't last long because it was too delicious.!

This recipe was super easy to make and dried hard like it should- I will use it again in the future if I plan to transport my cookies and need the decorative icing to dry super hard fairly quickly. There is another recipe that I like the flavor of better, but it doesn't harden quite as fast or as solid.

The recipe as-is is extremely runny. I used a piping bag and it dripped out of the tip as soon as I picked up the bag. I ended up using 4 cups confectioners sugar, 3 egg whites and 1 tsp of lemon.

I made the icing exactly as written. I was concerned about the egg whites thickening in our very humid weather but I kept beating them until they were thick and thick. I’m a novice decorator but I’m pleased with my first attempt and learned a lot. I used it on the Thick Sugar Cookie recipe on this site, which is fabulous by the way.

"Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it..."

When I first made this icing it came out so runny I  was ready to try another recipe. Then I read the comments... beat it!
A world of difference!  After that it was right. 
However, you need more lemon than this to flavor. And don't restrict yourself to lemon. I tried other flavor extract and some food coloring to make Independence Day treats. Mccormick has a great coloring and flavoring guide. 
Also, be sure of the amount you need, because the base recipe here @ 4 eggs is way more than you need. I didn't adjust and now I have Royal Icing sitting in my freezer for weeks and weeks...

Great recipe! You MUST beat it enough or it will be runny!  We also added about 3/4 sugar more to get the right consistency. Sets up fast!

This was our first attempt at royal icing and it was a success. I’ll make one change next time: either use fresh lemon juice or reduce the extract. The lemon flavor was too antiseptic.

I made a fourth of this recipe and it still came out - for extra measure I put in a splash of cream of tartar. Perfect for quickly icing ginger bread cookies :)

This recipe worked great, it only got a little runny when I added way too much food coloring on accident, but the gel colors i used never changed the consistency. also i added almond and vanilla extract in addition to the lemon in an attempt to make it less sweet, although it came out fine.

Don't use this recipe.  The directions are very poor, and it's missing the cream of tartar.  Should beat the eggs with cream of tartar until firm and fluffy, then add the sugar.  I followed the recipe and have soup, not icing.

This recipe worked well for decorating gingerbread cookies. Mixing a long time on high speed is the key to thickening the frosting. I used 1 teasppon of vanilla (instead of lemon extract) and  added 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar. “Adding a small amount of cream of tartar when you're beating egg whites—usually 1/8 teaspoon per egg white—speeds up the creation of foam and helps stabilize the structure of those miniscule air bubbles you're whipping up.” [from Allrecipes]

This was my first time ever making icing and it came out amazing! It worked so well on cookies. But at the beginning it was a bit too runny so I beat it a little more and it got thicker! So if it's too runny don't add sugar just let it beat a little longer. It also did take a long time to dry, but over all it was great!

For years, I've used a royal icing recipe that requires meringue powder, which isn't readily available at grocery stores in my area. This recipe uses egg whites instead, and it dries just as hard and is every bit as tasty as the other recipe. It's a keeper!

It was awful. I added tons of extra powdered sugar and beat it as long as I could and it was still runny and wouldn't not keep anything together on for gingerbread houses. It was a disaster and ruined our gingerbread houses. My kids were super disappointed. This is NOT like royal icing I've used in the past. I'm pretty annoyed.

Very good recipe.  As other reviewers stated, you do not need to add more powdered sugar to get the frosting to the right consistency.  You just need to beat it at high speed until stiff peaks form, at least 5 minutes.  I even doubled the amount of lemon juice to add more flavor and the icing did not turn out runny.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Better than store bought,great consistency, used it to decorate Christmas cookies. But go easy on the lemon extract, used only 1/2 tsb but got some after taste that I didn't care for much. Used McCormick pure lemon extract.

I made about 4 separate batches of this while doing gingerbread houses this season.  I followed the recipe exactly and just let the Kitchenaid run until it was think.  Dried quick and hard.  Excellent for decorating.  We actually put our houses together with compound chocolate as it dries even quicker but this icing was awesome for decorating.  
Fortunately, we keep chickens because I used a lot of eggs!
Merry Christmas everyone.

Nice and easy. Worked well even without lemon extract. I put a few drops of lemon juice in. Not sure if that's a proper substitute but I didn't encounter any real problems.

This was my first time making royal icing, so I was a bit nervous. I was extremely happy with how it turned out! I actually found that I either 1) added too much sugar or 2) beat the icing too long as I would have liked this icing to have been a bit thinner. I subbed in maple extract and it was amazing!

Just tried this recipe for googly eyes. Perfection! I just used the whites of one egg as I didn't need a lot of icing. I added powdered sugar and a few drops of lemon juice until I reached the proper consistency. I probably needed less than a cup of powdered sugar. As others suggested I mixed it for several minutes. The eyes came out great!

This recipe was easy enough to make, however I did not care for the taste of it. It tasted of sugar only and had no other flavor.

Ok, so it took way to long to dry. It's been 2 days and it still isn't hard. I did add water to some of it, and some vanilla extracr.Other than that it was ok. Piped nicely. PDoesn't taste the best, but that's royal icing in general.

This was a good thick glue for our gingerbread castle.  It hardened fairly quickly and didn't drip.  I used pasteurized egg whites in the hope of reducing the (slight) risk of bacteria, because we intend to leave our castle out for a day and then eat it.  I'm not sure if the pasteurized egg whites make it any safer, but at least the recipe worked well with them!

Followed recipe exactly (used almond ext).  Beat on high in my stand mixer for 7-8 minutes and yes it is a little 'wet' but not runny at all to the point of being unable to work with.  This also dried quickly.  I made a log cabin with pretzels and it held up well,  no waiting around for it to dry so I could continue and no runny mess.  Again beat on high and you want stiff peaks :)

This recipe tastes great and is a hit with my kids.  If it is too runny to use, you haven't mixed it long enough.  It will stiffen up the longer you mix.

I don't think I have ever made this before .....but it worked perfectly...i did beat it a bit longer then I was likely supposed to , to get the consistency and thickness I was looking for .  Couldn't cover the cookies the night I made it so placed in a container with saran over the icing like another person recommended and I completely avoided any Harding at the edges over the three days it took me to decorate the cookies... Highly recommend.

this was my first attempt at royal icing. This recipe is so easy. I will always use it from now on. I only made 1/2 the recipe as I only needed enough for gingerbread men. I had more than enough and it was so good that I decided to make another batch of gingerbread to use it up.

Recipe turned out just fine as is.  I ran it in the mixer for several minutes, and it piped out just fine.  Did get a bit runny after a few minutes when my hands warmed it up, so I popped the bag back in the fridge for a few, and then it worked fine.  Still remains to be seen how it dries.  I live in a low humidity area, so maybe that is why it worked for me and not some others.

This recipe worked wonders for me ... as written. I used it as a glue to make flip flops. Connecting very small flowers onto Pez candy. It held like a charm and tastes great too. It was also my first attempt at something like this so I was thrilled. I see tips in other reviews to tweak the consistency which I'm sure will be helpful. This one is going into my keep for life recipes and I plan to use it for gingerbread houses next winter!

I had to add a lot more powdered sugar and then some corn starch to make it thick enough to glue together graham cracker houses.  But in the end, it worked marvelously.  Just like an edible cement.  :)

This recipe was really easy to make. Like everyone else said, it was thin, however adding more icing sugar thickened it up  nicely, and the original consistency was great for flooding sugar and gingerbread cookies.

I made this recipe at last minute to top and perfect my lemon pound cake and I guess what people say to always come prepared is true. I halves the recipe and still had left overs and the icing wasn't quite thick enough for me but the one thing that really went wrong was I used regular sugar and not powdered sugar. I guess if I let it sit for a couple of hours it would be less grainy but that's the only real problem, it's a great simple recipe and definately worth making again

I used this recipe on some sugar cookies to "glue" some skewers to the back (for making cookie flowers) and it worked like a charm.  I did only make 1/4 of the recipe (1 egg white, 1 cup of sugar, and a dash of fresh lemon juice) and it made enough for me.  Thanks!

I give this four recipes only bearing in mind now that you can easily add however much sugar is needed to reach the consistency you desire. I was in a hurry and merely didn't think about adding more confectioner's sugar, and this turned out entirely too runny to pipe. Substituted vanilla for the lemon extract, and it was very delicious! I'll definately try this recipe again but with more sugar.

I used twice the amount of icing sugar, and it came out perfect for icing gingerbread men. The original recipe was pretty thin, but from suggestions here, i just kept adding the sugar till it was perfect.. The into a ziplock to use for pipping and perfection! Tastes great too.  I'm actually gonna use some of the thinner stuff to ice the sugar cooking i'm making.

Used for the "glue" while making an easter edible treat! Worked fantastic...I didn't have lemon extract so I used orange...yummy!!! Easy to work with and hardens nicely! Great recipe!

Perfect for "painting" my gingerbread cookies.  I halved the recipe and it was still way too much for 25 gingerbread cookies (completely iced).  I used vanilla instead of lemon, although I think lemon would be delicious.  I don't need to find a different recipe.

Royal Icing is such a pain in the you know what to make. The consistency has to be perfect and I can never seem to get it right! Mine was too runny to put in a decorating bag, so I just dipped my gingerbread cookies in it, then sprinkled with red and green sugar. Looked great and dried nice and hard! Royal Icing can dry out on you, so just cover the bowl with a damp paper towel so that doesn't happen.

So quick and easy! My 5 and 6 yr old had a great time making this. We used it to construct our mock gingerbread house from graham crackers.We subbed vanilla for the lemon extract with good results.

Sorry, I also found this runny.  My happy faces quickly turned into blob expressions.  Used vanilla extract, 1/2 t, and liquid food colouring--and even added an extra half cup of icing sugar due to previous reviewers' comments.  Since I used this to ice chocolate chip cookies for a preschool potluck, it didn't really matter how blobby they looked.  Kids liked them all the same.

It worked okay, but was waaay runnier than I expected. I found it hard to decorate with unless I was making large areas of solid colour. The recipe should mention this.

Perfect just like it says for making my first gingerbread house. I was looking for a recipe that did not require merengue powder. I will use this recipe every time! Thanks!

This icing is very easy to work with - I used it with a group of 7 year olds and had hardly any accidents or mess, and it dried hard enough to resist the most brutal of droppings. (The quantities suggested did seem to make more than I was expecting, though.)
