Use Yukon Golds (cut them in eighths) or new/reds (cut them in quarters).  Put them in a big ziploc with the oil.  Add salt and crushed BLACK pepper -- lots of it, if you like spice.

Forget all the herbs -- they conflict.  Add about 4 tablespoons of lightly chopped rosemary, or 2 tbl. of dried rosemary.  Throw in the garlic, too, more if you like garlic.

That's it -- salt, pepper, oil, garlic and rosemary.  Shake the bag, and let it sit on your counter for a while, shaking occasionally.  No more than 10 minutes, with a few shakes.

If you prefer basil, use basil instead of rosemary.  If you prefer spicy, shake some hot sauce into the bag.  You get the idea.  Keep it simple.

Then bake.  Then enjoy.

Like others, I used red potatoes and, as a time-saver, left the skins on.  To keep it low maintanence, I cooked at 350 (while other dishes were in the oven) for about 45 minutes.  In the last 10 mintues, I broiled them to get them crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Reheats well.  Delish.

Delicious and easy.  I make these all of the time, but have started to use only a few spices and herbs - at this point, I feel the outcome is best when only garlic powder, salt, ground black pepper and chili powder is used.  Sometimes I'll add some rosemary, but most times I do not.  Thanks - love these!!!

Instead of measuring out all the different spices I just used about 1 1/2 tsp. to 2 tsp. of Herbes de Provence which has many of the spices listed here. I used Yukon Gold potatoes (always!).  Placed the quartered potatoes in a gallon sized ziploc bag.  Added the oil, garlic, Herbes de Provence, salt and some fresh ground pepper.  Shook up and poured out on to a cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  Baked as directed.  Beautiful result.  Thanks!

I made this and used only the  olive oil , garlic, basil, parsley, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper and it was AMAZING!!! I also baked it at 350 for about 50 mins, and the potatoes were perfect, not too mushy, not too crunchy. Delicious!

These are my favorite roasted potatoes, I make them all the time. They are tender, delicious and pretty too. One note of warning - I found that 475 was too high, I bake these on 425 for about 35 minutes.

Fantastic recipe!  I doubled the recipe with no problems.  I did microwave the potatoes (in their jackets) to reduce cooking time.  Skip the peeling!  The skin adds nutrients and interest!

Use Yukon potatoes cut in 8ths or new/reds cut in 1/4s. Put in lg plastic bag with oil. Add salt and BLACK pepper. Forget the herbs-they conflict. Add 2T dried rosemary, the garlic--more if you like-- thats it salt, pepper, garlic, rosemary. Shake the bag and let it sit on the counter for no more than 10 min  shaking occasionally . If desired subsitute basil for the rosemary.
 Then bake.,   You get the idea. Keep it simple

This is a great recipe, each time I make it I vary whatever spices I feel I want to use, it's very versatile! I normally like to cut up the potatoes and then boil them for about 5 minutes or so and then put them in a pyrex dish and bake for 20 minutes, it makes sure they are soft and and the roasting makes them crispy. The get eaten up every time!

These potatoes are great.  I often roast potatoes with just olive oil and rosemary, but these were so much better.  I did all a little fresh cracked pepper to the mix and some onion wedges.  Also, mine burned.  I will probably turn the oven down a little the next time I make.  These are a definate do again though.

Good but this needed a little tweaking.  The potatoes took longer than 20-30 minutes to cook through, nearly 45 minutes.  Also, at 475, the outsides ended up burnt before cooked through.  To fix this, I dropped the temperature to 425, covered the pan with foil for the first 20 minutes then removed.  The steam from the potatoes helps them cook through without burning.

Delicious - there's nothing like oven roasted potatoes to compliment a grilled steak dinner!  This was quite a mix of herbs and at first I thought it would be a bit much, but overall it was very tasty and the red pepper flakes gave it a nice "kick".

I used about six medium red potatoes (peeled) for this recipe.  I didn't have thyme or dill weed, but they still turned out just beautifully...so delicious!  The amount of red pepper flakes was just right for us, but I can see where it might be a bit much for some.  You may want to start with half the amount the first time you make it and then add more then next time to suit your tastes.  I think this recipe would adapt to any combination of seasonings you like.  The cook method is the key -- high temp for a shorter time (and flip them over a few times, too).  They turn out moist and soft on the inside, but nice and crispy outside.  I used the non-stick foil to line the pan -- no clean up at all...yippee!  Thanks!  We love this one! :)

I have done this recipe with red potatoes which seems to be traditional, but I truly like it better with the russets!!  I don't peel them though, before I cube them.  The skin seems to help with crispiness, plus thats where all the nutrients are in the potato.  Also this time I used Lipton's Savory Herb and Garlic soup mix instead of the spices called for.  At about 425 it took 30 min. to crisp them up after stirring every 10 min.  My husband could not stop "mmm-mmm"-ing through the meal (served these potatoes with a delicious London Broil).  This is a great, tasty, quick side dish and healthier than mashed potatoes or loaded baked potatoes.  Also, line your pan with foil and spray with nonstick cooking spray - cleanup will be a breeze and the potatoes won't stick.

My husband and I liked this (the small one I had I liked) but my kids were less than enthused. I served it with homemade ranch. I wish I weren't on a diet....I would have loved to have a couple more. This would be really good with a horseradish-bacon dip.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years. I thought I had invented it! Ha, what did I know? I chop the potatoes, put them in a plastic bag, add the olive oil and seasoning and shake it up. It's so easy and a good way to use those clean plastic fruit/veg. bags from the store. I also add chopped onion, garlic and instead of all the herbs Janet listed, I use a few basics and add Cajun seasoning. Spicy and so good. Really you can add what your family enjoys.

These oven roasted potatoes come out perfect for serving to family or guests.  I have been making these for years, and my family always asks for them as a side. I skip the dill weed and marjoram since my family prefers it without. I also add fresh, course ground black pepper. I use the minced garlic from a jar (seem to run out of fresh garlic) and top them with a sprinkling of paprika before baking for a nice roasted color.  They are so easy to prepare and I always line the cookie sheet with heavy duty foil so clean up is a breeze.  These go great as a side dish with any kind of beef, pork, chicken and even fish.

I maded these as is and found they had too many conflicting spices.  The next time I threw the potatoes in a large ziploc bag and added olive oil, salt, pepper, fresh chopped rosemary and crushed garlic.  I let them sit and marinate while I prepared the rest of the meal and then baked them.  Prepared this way I'd give them 5 stars.

I never make potatoes for dinner (except for mashed sometimes) because no matter what the recipe, they turn out flavorless...
  NOT THESE POTATOES!! These are delicious!! I love anything with lots of flavor. Because there are so many spices in the oil the potatoes get nice and covered in them. I CUT THE POTATES SMALL. I get about 8-10 pieces from a medium potatoe. I'm a big fan of more surface area and less inside area. When cutting the potatoes small I cooked them for 20-30 minutes on 400. I also did not have Marjoram, so I skipped it. I made them for the first time Tuesday night with Chicken (Spicy Garlic Lime- OUT OF THIS WORLD) and I'm making them again tonight with Steak. These are easy and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Enjoy!!

I hesitated before making this recipe because of how many ingredients there are.  I am so glad I did!  Very yummy! This is my new 'go to' roasted potatoes recipe.  To save time, I pre-mixed the dry ingredients (making several batches) put it in a large shaker type spice container so I can whip them up in a jiffy!

I agree.  Keep it simple.  Olive oil and rosemary, bake at 350 for 50 min to an hour (usually am baking these with a chicken, so perfect to do in same oven at same time).  They are easy and perfect.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I combined four red potatoes, 1/8 cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons of dried rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper in a ziplock bag.  After shaking the bag for about ten minutes, I cooked the potatoes spread out on a baking sheet for twenty minutes at 475 degrees F, turning the potatoes every five minutes or so.  They turned out delicious and perfectly roasted.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again and again.

Loved these. Used red potatoes that I halved and then quartered. Baked for 50 minutes at 350 and then broiled for 10 minutes. Perfect! Thank you. **Update. Made again exactly to recipe (except used sea salt) and baked for 1 hour at 350. Used Release foil and no sticking! Delicious!

These are terrific potatoes!  Even my 13-year old whose diet consists mainly of Mountain Dew and Doritos loved them!  I added a bit more oil and 2 tablespoons of dry grated parmesan cheese to the herb mixture.  I'll use this one often!

This was pretty good.  I took the reviews suggestions and covered with tin foil for half the time, used 1/4 olive oil, and marinated in ziploc bag for a couple of hours.  I didn't have a few of the uncommon spices but it was still good.

I use red potatoes and also add an onion, halved and sliced thin. The onion gets very sweet. I omit the crushed red pepper flakes and dill and use rosemary. I bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour. Excellent. My family loves them.

EXCELLENT!  The only thing I did different was to leave out the red pepper flakes.  The roasting time was perfect and we really enjoyed the seasonings.  I will be making this again.  Thank you JMRYGH for sharing your recipe!

turned out great.  To get the potatoes nice and crispy, heat pan and then sprinkle with olive oil so it is sizzling hot.

So, the potatoes are in the oven. My girlfriend and her housemate found the bowl with the olive oil and herbs, and started wiping it out with chunks of baguette. "What IS this?" they asked, and it was GONE. Remember this for your next olive oil/herb recipe.

I've found this works best with waxy potatoes (red skin works perfect) and instead of using the combination of dried herbs, use a single variety of fresh (I prefer a sprig of chopped rosemary or some minced sage). This is my go-to recipe for roasted potatoes, but when I have the mentioned fresh herbs on hand my wife always notices and asks what I did different.

I would have to disagree with many of the other reviewers who thought all the spices counter acted each other... sure you couldn't just taste one spice... but it was the combination of all of them that made these potatoes taste so good... i cubed mine fairly small baked for 30 minutes at 475 and then finished them off with the broiler for a couple minutes to get them really night and brown... overall very very good recipe... if there is a spice you don't like then take it out or experiment with your own but as is... is really good

We just made these tonight and WOW were they delicious!!  I followed the directions, with the exception of exchanging the marjoram for sage because that was what I had on hand and chili powder for crushed red pepper to have a milder heat for my kids.  We will be making these again and again!  Another plus, besides the taste, would be that these were so quick to throw together.  I made them with Idaho potatoes, and left the skins on.  Try them - they don't disappoint!

I guess it depends on your preference.. My husband couldn't get enough of these and my son and I couldn't get past the kick that the crushed pepper gave the potatoes. But it was easy to make and smelled WONDERFUL while cooking.. ***UPDATE*** I made these again a few days later and left out the crushed pepper and everyone Loved them. THANKS!

I can't even believe how outstanding these were and how easy. I followed the instructions including baking temp to a tee and it was well received by everyone. I have to make these at least once a week. Nice and crispy soft on the inside. This is everything a roasted potato should be. Also, the kitchen smelled amazing with all the herbs. Thanks for sharing it's a keeper!

Great Recipe... we loved them!  I also added a sprinkle of parmasean cheese and bread crumb just before I placed them into the oven, which helped the edges have a little extra crunch!  Will make again.

Okay...all I had was 4 baking potatoes and we wanted fries. Since we are watching our cholesterol this seemed like a good idea..and they are great. I cut my potatoes like fries used whatever spices I had in the pantry (crushed red pepper, celery salt, garlic powder, Tony's and some lemon juice and a little kosher salt) cooked for 20 minutes on a non-stick pan, flipped and cooked for 20 more, they were perfect. LOVE LOVE LOVE them, better than french fries!! Use a ziplock bag to coat your "fries" its much easier clean up!

I first made this dish last winter as a last-minute side for dinner.  My boyfriend who loves roasted potatoes, really enjoyed these.  I find myself preparing these every month or so, I don't even have to "tweak" the recipe, it's perfect and savoury just as it is.

First of all, IMHO, it doesn't make sense to give a recipe four and five stars and then explain how one has completely altered it. By leaving out the herbs in this recipe, it's no longer this recipe.

That said, I tried the recipe as is and thought it was okay. I think the dill was a little overpowering, and it would have been better without it. I'll stick with oil, salt, pepper, garlic, rosemary and sage on my potatoes though.

Used a mix of red and white potatoes.  No measuring really needed just start tossing in the ingrediants, came out amazing.  Great switch from mashed or baked potatoes, flavorful, and a little crunchy.  Big hit for family dinner.

Added Rosemary like others and found that they took just a little longer to cook than 30 minutes. I peeled Gold Yukon potatoes (I have never tried them before!) and can't wait to try them with Reds as well. A keeper recipe for sure.

I can't wait to try this.  I just saw a recipe similar to this on Sandra Lee, but she used a combination of sweet potatoes, red potatoes, and Yukons, all cut in the same size, so that there would be good variety of color.

Yum! Used other reviewers' suggestions to simplify (salt, pepper, rosemary & oil) and roasted my potatoes for 30 minutes at 425. Microwaved for 3 minutes before tossing them with oil/seasonings to get the cooking started. Love this method and will definitely make again!

This recipe is easy and tastes great, but be careful not to overspice. If you use 1/4 tsp of everything it still tastes fabulous and if you omit any spices altogether it's fine also. This is one very easy way to cook potatoes that looks and tastes complicated!

These potatoes are really good!  I was just making for two so I used 1/2 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp parsley, 1/4 tsp red pepper, 1/2 tsp italian seasonings and 2 potatoes peeled and cubed.  I cooked them at 425 for about 30 minutes and they were perfect

It was super east to throw these together and they came out great. I like potatoes with the skins on, which is very lucky because I happen to be somewhat lazy... and with this recipe it works. I added extra crushed red peppers flakes because I love spice. If you don't like things with too much kick you can go lighter than the recipe calls for. So simple and tasty I will be making this recipe again.

Delish!  I pretty much followed the recipe.  I used fresh thyme instead of dried and cayenne pepper instead of crush red pepper.  We try to eat healthy and I don't normally make potatoes as a side item, but there are fabulous!!

These were great and easy to make.  I had all the ingredients, which is suprising.  Next time I will leave out the red pepper flakes because they were too spicy for my kids.  I chopped up some fresh carrots and added them too...delicious!  They took longer than it said in the recipe (about and hour) and still didn't get crispy the way I like them, so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes.

I was actually a bit disappointed in the recipe.  I used russet potatoes as it was the only kind I had.  Then I used the recommended amount of oil plus another generous helping, added salt, black pepper, three cloves of garlic, and some dried basil.  They had good flavor but I had a huge problem with them in the oven.  Baked these at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or so like a reviewer suggested.  These potatoes were stuck to the bottom of the pan after 10 minutes or so even with all the extra oil I added, so I would check up on them probably every five minutes and give them a good toss.  Additionally, the garlic that I minced up got burnt in the process; they do give the potatoes a nice aroma though so next time I might leave them whole.  Needs so tweeking but with modifications, this could be a really easy and delicious recipe.

Nice change of pace from the mashed potatoes we always have!  Was quicker to prepare than I thought.  Didn't have marjoram but followed everything else (except for used garlic powder instead of minced), and threw in an onion.  Used the ziploc bag trick and it works like a charm.  Used 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/8, per advice of other reviewers, potatoes didn't dry out at all, took full 30 minutes to bake.  Used release foil and they didn't stick (however, since I used extra oil, I probably could have done one or the other).  Very tasty result, the only thing is these are really spicy with the red pepper flakes, I think I'll only use 1/4 instead of 1/2 of a teaspoon next time.  These look very attractive, I can see why another reviewer said they would be perfect for company!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very delicious!  I used new potatoes and quartered them and they actually cooked rather quickly........in about 30 minutes at 400 degrees.  I had to turn down the oven to 350 at the end because my entree wasn't ready.  Also, be sure to keep an eye on the potatoes and turn them often so they don't burn.

These were very good.  I cut the potatoes into 1 inch cubes and baked them at 400F rather than 475.  They took 30 minutes.  I found that the potatoes stuck to my pan so next time I will line my pan with parchment paper.

Amazes me that so many people loved this recipe. My favorite food is potatoes but I threw these away. The cooking instructions were correct - mine were done in 25 minutes. They were about 1 inch cubes. I would have given the recipe 2 stars for that if I were at least able to eat the result. For me, the spices were much too strong. I couldn't taste the potato - just an odd peppery mix that lingered.

These were great.  I cooked them at 400 instead of 475, because I was making something else at the same time, and cooked them for almost an hour, but they turned out terrific.  A good and easy and flavorful side dish.

I make these all the time and vary the type and cut of the potatoes - white, red, yukon gold - quarters - large cubes, etc. and the main ingredient after the olive oil is a tablespoon of dried onion soup mix - I then add basil, oregano, garlic (powder) and when they are ready to go in the oven I use salt and pepper to taste.  I also prefer to cook for 1 hour on 350 - less heat in the kitchen and they come out just great - always make twice as much - cuts down on a side for tomorrow.

we liked these (including pregnant lady and 15 month old).  i used little reds cut into 8ths and didn't add enough olive oil so they stuck to the pan -- next time i'll use more spray.  also i did mine at 450 or about 40 minutes, stirring twice.  yum, thanks!

Very nice and easy potato dish.  I knew this was going to be good, so I mixed up extra herbs.  Next time, all I'll have to do is mince some garlic, add some olive oil, sprinkle on some of the herb blend, and it'll be ready for the oven.  Works for me!

I agree with other reviews here- keep it simple. Salt, pepper, and some rosemary or basil. I use a bowl to toss it in because I try to avoid plastic! Turned out great. What a wonderful side dish. 
NOTE- this also works great with sweet potatoes!

I've been making these potatoes for years as an accompaniment for scrambled eggs. They're a perfect side dish to virtually any main course. My mother-in-law always requests these when she visits. Although any variety of potato will work, I generally use russetts, scrubbed well and diced into bite-sized pieces. I throw the diced potatoes in a big bowl, add desired amount of canola oil, stirring to coat evenly, and simply just season to taste with sea salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders, parsley, and a healthy dose of Montreal low-sodium chicken seasoning (sounds odd, but I truly love the flavor it imparts!). Bake on a parchment-lined baking sheet at 400 degrees for 20-22 minutes, and you'll have yourself some tasty taters!

Delicious, but I do agree with the reviews that said 475 is way too high.  I used small red potatoes, quartered, and set the oven to 425.  I thought they would take about 35 minutes, but they were thoroughly cooked before 25 minutes were up.  I shut the oven off and just let them sit in there until the rest of dinner was ready.  I used granulated garlic, dill, oregano, basil, parsley, salt & pepper, and thought the taste was wonderful.  I may try 400 degrees next time.

I tried this recipe the other night and my wife loved them. I followed the direction pretty well to the letter except I added i/2 tsp onion salt and baked them in a convection oven @ 425 F. A definite saver.

This is always a hit at our house. I keep it simple like a lot of others suggested -- just salt, pepper, a little garlic powder, and a little cumin. I shake it up in a gallon sized ziplock or in a bowl with a lid. The oven temperature and bake time is perfect. It's such a versatile recipe, good with breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

Used unpeeled russet potatoes and a similar, but store bought spice mix. The cooking instructions were right on. Roasted them for 30 minutes and they came out perfectly brown and crispy.

I made these roasted potatoes last night. Verdict - good and I may make them again with a tweak or two.  First of all I made them as written.  There are a lot of seasonings, but they do seem to work well together.  Next time I would cut back on the crushed red pepper, or omit entirely.  With the amount stated in the recipe expect some heat.  Also I would add on an additional 15 minutes to the cooking time, after 30 minutes they were not done to the desired crispiness that I was expecting.  All in all a good recipe. Thanks.

Simple, delicious and crisp! Used preheated, oiled, cast iron skillet and left out the Italian seasoning.

I made these tonight and OMG so fantastic!    I took others suggestions and modified the recipe a little.  I used 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon each of salt, pepper, chili powder and a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of  dill and 1/2c of olive oil.  I also cubed the red potatoes very small and while in the oven I rotated them every 10 minutes.   After 40 minutes I removed them from the oven and with a slotted spoon transfered the cooked potato mixture to a casserole and sprinkled Kosher salt over the top and mixed the potatoes a couple times.  OMG, I have to say, this was so, so easy and so, so wonderful!  We ate this up so fast, I was asked to make this a couple times a week for our sides from now on!  thank you for posting this delish recipe!

I didn't like this recipe at all.  Everyone has preferences for spices, and I liked the spices, it was the way the potatoes were prepared.  It took way longer than what it called for.  I should have followed someone else's advice and boiled them first to soften them up a bit, and then roasted them.

Amazing. These taste like some potatoes we eat at a favorite Portugese restaurant - but way cheaper and super easy! Be sure to stir them often though - we had a lot that stuck. I will definitely make this again!

I cooked way more potatoes than I thought we would eat.  They were a huge hit and all got eaten!  I used small red potatoes that I halved.  I also used my Pampered Chef stoneware pan.  They browned beautifully without having to be turned over.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

These are delish! I threw in some baby carrots, peeled and halved a few shallots, and tossed in half a head of garlic (cloves peeled). The shallots and the whole garlic cloves taste so sweet and mellow when roasted. This is a fabulous dish and lots of room to modify the spices to your own liking. The spice was nice. But really, try eating whole roasted garlic cloves and you add a whole new dimension to flavorful roasted veggies.

My husband and I loved these potatoes! This is the best recipe. After reading the reviews, I made 2 changes. 1) I used 1/4 cup olive oil. 2) I put the potatoes along with the oil and seasonings into a ziploc bag and shook until all the potatoes were evenly coated. I also left out the marjoram because I didn't have any. My husband said this was one of the best recipes I have gotten from this site.

I used quartered red potaoes for this, and added 2 Tbsp. butter. (I think they brown/taste better with some butter). Baked at 350 for about 1 hour, and boy, did they ever smell delicious! Conflicting herbs, nothing... I would say these were some of the best tasting potatoes I ever ate. Even inspired my appetite to come back, albeit fleetingly. My husband absolutely raved over this recipe. Thank you, Janet.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Made it over the thanksgiving holiday and they were a huge hit.  I found that by adding 3 tablespoons of butter, it gave it more flavour.  Also, the potatoes tended to stick to the pan, so make sure its greased well, or put extra oil on the potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe!

There were too many spices on the list, I chose to simplify and I used 2 Tbsp evoo, and 1 TBSP Emeril's original essence, and 1 1/2 TBSP grated parmesan cheese.  Not sure what they would taste like w/ all the listed seasonings, but I found the way I made them to be fantastic, plus I didn't have to bother measuring all those spices.

FANTASTIC recipe...easy...and very yummy!!  I turned the oven down to 375 and baked longer so that the potatoes cooked all the way thru and crisped up.

I use this recipe as a base for roasted vegetables.  I add mushrooms, onions, red or green pepper, baby carrots, zuchinni and roast away.  I've gotten to the point where the potatoes are incidental to the recipe - I only put in 1 or 2.  I also line my pan with the "release" foil, for practically no clean up.

YUM! Liked these so much I've made them twice within the last 3 days. Used previous reviewer's advice and put foil on cookie sheet then sprayed with Pam. I did use closer to 1/4 cup olive oil and did use Extra Virgin-had no problem with burning.  Added good handful of onion, which really added to the flavor, used garlic powder instead of minced, and cut both the dill weed and red pepper in half. Used russet potatoes, did not peel, and cooked for almost 25 minutes. Since I did use the Extra Virgin olive oil, I stirred the potatoes every 5 minutes. The flavor of these potatoes is very addicting to me-I keep snitching from the leftovers. Flavor is even better the next day.

i'd just like to suggest (for those of you who have had a problem with it cooking) that you bake for that time, and if it isn't browned yet, you turn the oven to broil. watch it CAREFULLY, making sure it doesn't burn but browns perfectly

I have friends begging me to make these anytime I have a dinner party.  They are so tasty and easy to throw together.  I always add a 1/4 cup of grated parmesean cheese.  I have made them several times and the last time I used little purple potatoes...they looked beautiful and tasted great!

These were good, but I was disappointed the potatoes didn't have better flavor with all those spices. I think perhaps sticking to just garlic and rosemary would be better and simpler. The other spices combined are just too overpowering. I turned the broiler on for the last couple of minutes for crispier edges.

This recipe is perfect for company.  Not only is it delicious, but when they walk in the house the smell will make their mouths water.  If you are missing a few of the spices, don't worry, it will still turn out great!

These potatoes were great and brought rave reviews from the guests I served them too. Next time I make them, I will first roll the potatoes in the olive oil and then sprinkle the spices on. These are quick to prepare and very tasty. They eliminate the need for making a high calorie gravy. This is a definite keeper.

Left the skin on, still yummy. Half of it was stuck on the tin-foil though, will spray veggie oil on first next time. Very easy and tasty side dish that goes with everything!

Made as written, except left our salt, and cooked at 375 for an hour to accommodate the pie I was also making.  Used russet potatoes and ate them like potato wedges with ketchup.  Yum!

This is a nice, simple, general purpose roasted potato recipe that offers a lot of flexibility for variations. I have made this with different types of potatoes, and with or without sauteed onions added, and it has produced good results each time.

Tasty and very easy! I skipped the marjoram, used a teaspoon of granulated garlic instead of a tablespoon of fresh minced, and halved the thyme (because all I had was ground). I really liked this mix and will use it again. ETA: Years later, I still make this recipe fairly regularly (although I usually use red potatoes now, since I have them on hand more often). In fact, in a household in which most people don't even *like* potatoes, this is one of the only potato recipes I've made more than once, and pretty much everyone enjoys it; I, for one, *love* it. I don't think I ever got around to trying it with marjoram, but is still seriously delicious.

I rarely come back and write a review on a recipe, but I thought this one deserved it. When I was reading through this, I noticed quite a few comments saying to skip all the herbs, just do a simple salt, pepper, olive oil, garlic mix. While I agree that results in very good potatoes, follow the recipe. You won't regret it. This blend of herbs is AMAZING. Everyone loved them (served to 12 people with a variety of taste preferences).

Made these for dinner tonight.... they were easy and very tasty. I was worried they would be too over powering with all those herbs but they weren't. They were just flavorful and yummy! I didn't include the red pepper flakes because my husband can't take the heat... maybe next time I will just add a pinch!

These were perfect!  I set the oven for 450 and I also put the oil and spice mixture in a ziplock bag and coated the potatoes that way.  Perfect seasoning- not too overpowering.  Thank you!

Delicious recipe!  Did not measure seasonings out exactly - just eyeballed it when I sprinkled them into bowl.  Only one I didn't use was marjoram due to not having any.  Also left skin on potatoes, coated pan with a little olive oil to help prevent sticking & set temperature for 425.

I've always had a hard time making cooked, crispy oven roasted potatoes...until now!  The key is to cut potatoes in small bite-sized cubes, high heat & consistent turning.  Be sure to season well...to the point where you think you over-seasoned.  I used lots of salt, pepper, garlic powder and an italian blend seasoning.  I put all ingredients in a ziploc bag and shook it up.

I love these potatoes! I follow the recipe exactly except bake them at 425° instead of 475° for 30 mins. This is just my preference, but I also added "herbed butter" when the potatoes are done cooking. The herbed butter is 3-4 tbsp of room temperature butter mixed with italian seasoning (the same stuff on these potatoes.) When the potatoes come out of the oven, I put the potatoes in a bowl, mix with the herbed butter, and then serve. They're delicioussss that way & then it's 5 stars. Give it a try- but regardless these are awesome! Thank you.

Pretty good, though not spectacular.  I dislike dragging out a ton of spices, especially if the end product isn't fabulous.   This was pretty good, though not spectacular.  I prefer to use s&p and rosemary, or the onion soup mix.

I didn't have marjoram and have a family member who hates dill so I skipped these two ingredients and still turned out with AWESOME potatoes. I lightly greased my pan with PAM because it's been my experience that potatoes stick and these lifted from the pan perfectly.

LOVED this recipe. I left out dill because it seemed weird with the other herbs and I omitted parsley because I didn't have any and I didn't use the crushed red pepper because I wasn't going for spicy. Super delicious!

Followed recipe exactly except omitted red pepper for my little ones. Turned out good. The dill seemed a little strong, might cut it back next time. But, will definitely make them again.

Great!  Made just as per the recipe.  If you don't like spicy, go with 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, but as-is they weren't too spicy by any means.

Fantastic!  Just the right amount of herb flavour.  Followed the recipe exactly (minus the marjoram, we didn't have any) and I baked it on a cookie sheet at 350 for 50 minutes.. Perfection!

I added quartered mushrooms, zucchini, and red onion. Baked them covered for 1 hour and then baked an additional 15 mins for some crispness.  I also used red potatoes unpeeled and quartered. Made this for mother's day dinner and 12 people raved about them so can I put in more stars?

Great basic recipe with ingredients that I always have on hand (I have never used marjoram). I have made this many times, and this has become my go-to recipe for roasted potatoes. It tastes great and turns out every time. Thanks!

These came out great. I didn't have any dill, so I added more basil. Also I halved the amount of olive oil to reduce the fat content. Delicious.

I made these a few weeks ago and my fiance won't stop bugging me for them now.  I agree with some of the other reviews that you don't really need all these different spices.  I used a few tablespoons of vegetable oil as that's what I had and shook the potatoes in a freezer bag with garlic powder, black pepper, rosemary, crushed red pepper and seasoned salt.  Potatoes came out perfect!

These potatoes are very good! I really liked the blend of seasonings. I did not have any red pepper...but I think it would have added to the mixture quite well. I baked these at 425 for 35 minutes and broiled for 10 minutes. Good recipe!

Great base recipe.  Add whatever spices & herbs you like and roast away.  I even used Tollhouse Salad Blend with extra garlic powder, salt, pepper, basil, parsley and lots of red pepper flakes.  Fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly except I left the skin on the potatoes.  I used 4.5 potatoes just to be sure I had enough.  When I mixed the spices/oil together at first it didn't look like there would be enough, but once I mixed in the potatoes it spread over them all well.  It was even actually a little bit two spicy so I would use maybe a fraction less of each next time.  When I went to turn them, they stuck to the pan a bit making me wonder if I should have used a little more oil.  They tasted great and otherwise were very easy!  I will make them again :)

Before baking, I sprinkle with shredded cheese.  Gruyere is best, but the standard cheeses are good too.  I also use Yukon Gold potatoes, leave the skins on and make slices about 1/4 inch.  I melt butter in a wok and add some onion and minced garlic from a jar.  After a few minutes, I add whatever's around and fresh, but prefer fresh dill.  Salt and pepper.  Don't need more than that.  I put the potatoes in the wok and mix until they're covered with the butter and herbs.  Pour into a baking dish and sprinkle with shredded Gruyere, if you're so inclined.  It gives a flavor a little like French onion soup. I bake them for more like 50-60 min.

These were really good. I (almost) made them as directed; I thought we had marjoram, but it wasn't in the cupboard (I searched Google for a substitute, and they said to use oregano, which was already in the seasoning), I used 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and I did not measure out the oil. I added just enough oil to coat the potatoes I had, because the amount of oil you use will change depending on how many potatoes you cut up. We always line the pan with non-stick aluminium foil for an easy clean-up and fewer potatoes stuck to the pan. Here in Canada, they used to sell "Shake n' Bake" for potatoes (they still sell it for chicken) until about 5 years ago; ever since, we have been looking for a substitute. This is the closest we have come to recreating our old favourite! We found there to be too much of a spicy after taste with the red pepper, so we might reduce that next time, but overall a wonderful recipe. Making it at home is better than a mix anyhow, because you can control the salt content, and there are no preservatives. With a few tweaks here and there, we should be able to recreate our favourite potatoes :)

Really nice! I got compliments on these. I followed the recipe exactly, only I didn't use the marjoram or the dill weed because I didn't have them. The 20 minutes was the perfect timing. They were delicious--thanks for the recipe! Update-- I also tried this by doubling the recipe, coating chicken and potatoes, and baking everything in one pot--- delicious!!

Great recipe.  We make these potatoes once a month or more.  No changes necessary...make just as the recipe states.

This is as simple as Junk Food...but far more delicious & nutritous!  We have made these jems strictly by the recipe, and we have done them without the Thyme. We like them much better without as Thyme seems to over power the other flavors. We also prefer the crunchiness of Sea Salt rather than table salt.  And, we always use Mini Yellow or Mini Red potaoes..President's Choice. They are cremey & soft inside but nice and crispy on the outside. The bonus is there is no cutting & certainly no pealing (cause that's the real nutritious part) required!   Great recipe..but with a couple tweaks it is simply Amazingly Fabulous!  Happy Roasting!

I have made this recipe several times.  When camping I have made this on the stove top stirring till cooked and browned nicely.  I use 1tbsp fresh herbs for the dried if possible.  I have also used Yukon Gold potatoes even better then just plain white potatoes.  Always a hit at my house.  Thanks for a great recipe for potatoes.

It sounded like too many  herbs to me so I cut it down to rosemary, thyme, and parsley, with some crushed garlic.  I was really looking for techniques, anyway, not flavours, as I've never roasted potatoes before.  They turned out wonderfully crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside.

Great recipe! I used the Pampered Chef Garlic infused oil and roasted on a baking stone, so no turning required. Yummy!

I've never had leftovers when I make this, even my son who doesn't care a whole lot for potatoes eats them up. I followed the suggestion of some and set the oven more around 450. I sliced the potatoes about 1/4 inch or less- less will make them crispier. Mmmmm!

Everyone loves these potatoes!  When I make them, I make up an extra batch or two of the seasonings to have on hand for the next time I throw these together.  For some reason, it's very time consuming to open all of the jars!

I took other reviewers' advice and seasoned it to my liking after adding 1/8 cup oil to a zip-lock bag. I used plenty of kosher salt, pepper, and several shakes of hot sauce, then topped them off with a bit of garlic salt. I cut the un-skinned potatoes into cubes, baked them at 400 (my oven is hot) for 25 minutes. Also, I stirred them about every 10 minutes. Be sure to spray the foil with non-stick spray or they'll stick! Thanks for the recipe, it's foolproof for any tastes or occasions. **Update: Add in carrots and just keep an eye on them if your potato pieces are thick.

I first found this on here in Oct. 06 & neglected to review it . We love it ! I sometimes just mix everything up in a large ziploc bag (you can be selective with the herbs if someone has a definite dislike of something ). Then I just let it all sit until ready to roast . I think we are going to try that with precooked potatoes soon & then grill them after an hour or so in the bag in the frig. We shall see how it works !

I throw in some grated parmesean cheese, too. These are the most versatile potatoes, both for cooking time and flavoring. Make them often in my house!

One of my favorite sides to make!!! So quick 'n' easy and the whole family loves them.  The three most common ways I make these:  1. Nothing but the EVOO and One package of Lipton's Dry Onion Soup.  2. EVOO & Penzey's Northwoods Seasoning (coarse salt / sweet paprika / black pepper / thyme / rosemary / garlic and chipolte) And, finally:  3.  EVOO, minced garlic and onion (We also grill them this way, too!).

This is my new favortie way to prepare potatoes! I didn't have all the herbs that the recipe called for.  What I had in the pantry was thyme, basil, fresh garlic, oregano, rosemary, salt and pepper and olive oil.  I let the potatoes "rest" on the counter mixed with everything in a ziploc as one reviewer suggested.  The last 10 minutes of cooking I sprinkled a touch of brown sugar over the potatoes mixed them up and put them back in the oven.  The brown sugar is a great contrast to the salt and herbs!!

I almost always love roasted potatoes, and these surprised me by how much better they were than any other recipe I've tried.  I had run out of olive oil so used melted butter instead, and I doubled the red pepper flakes since we love spice!  I served them as a game day snack with sour cream on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

These were so good.  We really enjoyed the touch of heat that is in this dish, with the red pepper flakes, as well as the combination of the many herbs.  I did double the olive oil & cover the potatoes with foil for the first 20mins to make sure they got cooked through; then uncovered for the last half of the baking time.  At the end, I broiled them to get those nice browned edges.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, Janet!

I omitted the dill weed and added some Creole seasoning.  Next time, I might add some Parmesan cheese.  As recommended, I put everything in a Ziplock and mixed it together.  I also lined a roasting pan with foil and sprayed it with Pam which helped greatly with the clean up (otherwise, I would have spent much time scrubbing the pan).

Terrific!  I did increase oil based on other posters' recommendations, omitted the marjoram (I didn't have any) & red pepper flakes, and did not peel the potatoes (wanted the nutrients and am too lazy!).  Family inhaled them, no leftovers!  Will make these again for sure.  Thanks for sharing!

These are just terrific. As a general note, omitting the salt in the recipe, and then sprinkling fleur de sel just before serving makes them even more attractive, and- due to the comparative lightness of the sea salt- helps the seasoning stand out. Very, very good.

Janet, these potatoes are delicious!  The great thing about this recipe is you can alter the seasonings for your taste. I used all the spices except the marjoram and dill.  Somehow I missed them on the list, but the potatoes had the perfect amount of spice.  I loved the addition of the red pepper, they gave the potatoes the perfect kick.  Thanks again for sharing, these will be repeated often!

These were good - I cooked them for about an hour at 325 while I cooked something else, and they were very forgiving to the temperature change.  Easy to make, prepped them ahead of time, went great with Christmas dinner.

Amazing! Turned out great. I didn't use a cooking spray and it did stick to the pan; had to turn many times. Cooked for a bunch of my boyfriends friends and everyone loved it.

Very good.  I left the skin on the potatoes.  I also soaked the potatoes in ice water (to remove the starch) and dried them before putting them in the mixture.  I put all the spices in a gallon-size Ziploc bag and then shake it up.

Did what other reviews have suggested and cut out all of the different spices and stuck to the basics. Garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper. Awesome.

I agree with the previous reviewer that the oven temperature is a bit too high. Next time I make these, I'm going to try 425 or a bit lower. The potatoes cooked pretty fast (I used red potatoes). The recipe is really great though! Everything that I could want from roasted potatoes. And they weren't too dry either. Great side dish!

the recipe was good - however cooking at 475 was too hot - in less then 20 minutes, I had burnt potatoes.  I would suggest 375 or 425 (deg F) instead.

I orginally reviewed this recipe back in March of '05. I just wanted to update to say that I have been using this recipe at least once a month ever since. It is so easy and has great flavor. I will even use this recipe when entertaining and my husband is grillling a nice beef tenderloin. One of my favorite finds from this site.

Try lining your pan with "Release non-stick" foil. It is so much easier to turn the taters and all sides get nicely browned. Major yummy stuff : )

Great sidedish recipe.  It's easy to whip up and taste great!  The whole house smelled like I had been cooking for hours...but they really don't take long at all.  It's already a quick recipe, but when we are really in a hurry and don't feel like boring convenience food we use those ingredients on canned whole potatoes.  Just take 1 can of whole potatoes, all the spices from the recipe (about half of the measurements though), and fry them in 2 tbsp olive oil and 1/2 tbsp butter till they are browned.  Either way you make them they are a great tasting sidedish for a rushed night.

These were absolutely delicious!  Excellent room temperature or warm!  We subsituted a 7 spice blend we had instead of the other spices and added a little chili powder.  I would make sure to cut the potatoes into pretty small pieces, they are much tastier with lots of crispy edges.

I make a these often, they are sooo good.  I like to cut down on the basil & red pepper (a sprinkle of cayenne, for the kids sake), but I add white pepper & paprika.  Anyway, these are equally as good on the grill in a foil packet, stirring IS essential otherwise they will stick.  Thanks Janet!

These potatoes are incredible. They are spicy and flavorful. I make them every time I get a craving for roasted potatoes. I emailed the recipe to my best friend and now she makes them all the time, too. You simply must try it!

Excellent!!!!This was my first attempt at roasting veggies and they turn out wonderful. Served it to friends as a side to Roasted Chicken. Easy and very tasty. You can add other veggies in addition to the potatoes for variation.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper but I wish I hadn't. Turned out fabulous otherwise as written. I put everything into a jumbo freezer zip bag and do the shake and bake thing.

I reduced the amount of olive oil and still found it to be a bit much. Also a little too spicy for my taste! But overall a great dish to go along with chicken.

My husband made this last night for a dinner with our friends and they loved it! 5 big potatoes for 4 adults and 1toddler and everything was gone! We did not have all herbs, so we just used Italian seasoning and added chopped onion too. Will defenitely make it again! Thank you.

These are some of the best potatoes I have made, I use 1/4 cup of olive oil and a teaspoon of everything else. Makes for better coating of the potatoes and they brown more evenly. Sometimes I sprinkle the top with Parmesan cheese cheese. Simple and wonderful this dish!

I was looking for a quick, simple way to do something with the bag of potatoes I just bought. This recipe is excellent with so much flavor! I modified it by adding a chopped medium onion and a small bit of lemon zest. I was a big hit with my family.

This is quite good, similar to other recipes for roasted potatoes, all including dicing or quartering the potatoes and using olive oil with a variety of spices.
3-9-13:  Better than other recipes that call for a lower oven temperature.

This is a good receipt and the instructions are accurate in regards to temp.  But you must keep in mind the size you cut your taters and if you are baking skin on or off.  I usually start out with mine on 475.  After 8 minutes, I turn the oven down to 450 and I turn the taters over.  After another 8 minutes, I turn them over again and reduce the heat to 400.  Everyone is different and their oven is different.  The main thing you need to do, is keep an eye on them, turn them frequently.

This was a big hit at my friend's 4th of July cookout. I used garlic powder, salt, pepper, basil, oregano, and thyme, along with the olive oil, put it in a bag and shook it for a while. Then, I also put it in the oven for 45 minutes on 350 degrees and then cranked it up to broil for 10 minutes. Wonderful crust. I love reading the comments on here, to get really good cooking instructions. These were even good cold the day after the party and my husband and I quickly gobbled up the leftovers.

A nice, simple companion that will work with many meals.  I boiled the potatoes for a little bit first, so as not to have them spend as much time in the oven.

These are nice with a bit of parmesan cheese sprinkled on top as well.

We
loved these potatoes. I substituted some herbs the recipe calls for and
used what I had on hands. And I used more garlic and olive oil.

excellent!!  7/13/2016 I just wanted to update... I've been making these for years.  I do find the simpler the seasoning the better.  S & P, garlic powder & onion powder & wala!  Also... Sometimes I'll cube an onion & toss that in with the oil

This has become one of my go-to recipes for quick and delicious oven potatoes.  They work for any meal, and my family is fond of them for breakfast. Often I will substitute ¼ tsp. of garlic powder for the fresh garlic if I don’t have it on hand, and of course 1/8 tsp. of pepper because the recipe doesn’t call for any. Thanks for sharing!

Great flavor combinations with these herbs.  We used small red potatoes and followed everything else as stated.  Easy and quick side dish to any meal!  Thanks for the post!

As the top reviewer did I also omitted the herbs and kept it simple. I used 6 cloves of garlic and 2 teaspoons each fresh cracked black pepper and kosher salt.I used 6 small sized yukon potatoes cut into wedges.I combined it all in a gallon size ziploc bag for 10 minutes.During the 30 minute cooktime (this will vary depending on your oven so keep an eye on em') I turned and squirted on a tablespoon of olive oil twice to keep moist.Excellent side dish with my ribeye steak !

Easy, delicious and you can use various seasonings to switch it up.  I no longer buy the fries in a bag since making potatoes this way.  I find they are the most crispy on a silpat and they never stick.  Perfect every time.  I let my kids choose the seasonings, everyone gets to create their own variety.... and we try new things.

Thanks for sharing JMRYGH!  I'm sure this recipe would be delicious as is but after reading many reviews, I tweaked to my tastes. Did the following:  Peeled & Diced Russett Potatoes & Chopped Baby Carrots in halves. In Ziploc Coated with: 2 parts Extra Virgin Olive Oil to 1 part Wesson Oil. minced garlic, sea salt, fresh crushed black pepper, rosemary, dill, a dash of lemon. Put a big 14" Chef Todd English Green Pan in the oven & preheated to 475 degrees.  Tossed the veggies in ziploc bag really well and added to heated pan. Heating the pan helped to sear the bottom layer (I had a full pan of diced & had to do something to quicken the cooking).  I'll try the exact recipe next time!  I always wanted to try these type of potatoes! Yummy

Recipe is great as written. Twice I've had to add more olive oil b/c my potatoes were too dry. Seasonings are wonderful. Easy to prepare and reheats well also.

Be sure to spray/grease the pan well and stir the potatoes every 10 or so minutes. I also removed the potatoes with 15 minutes left, put them back in the mixing bowl (which still had a bit of the oil/spice mix left on the sides and bottom), mixed in some defrosted frozen broccoli spears until the broccoli was coated, put it all back in the pan, and roasted the last 15 minutes. It was very good! Next times I think I'll try decreasing the temp to 450, though.

Most, or all, of these herbs are in a regular Italian Seasoning mix. The only other ingredients needed are fresh garlic, red pepper (if desired) and s & p to taste. Excellent!

Not bad, I did not have marjoram or dill so I left those out.  I did not like the thyme flavor either, but hubby loved these.  Easy to fix.

Great recipe :)I was a little disappointed that when they came out of the oven they weren't very crispy. I cooked them for 30 min. and they were a little too raw still. I also added half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the mixture. Overall, very sound side dish :)

these are great for a side dish when you don't have a lot of prep time. My husband loves the seasoning. Even if it's just for nights when it's just me and my son I cut the potatoes into "fries" and do them that way :)

Made these with russet potatoes...I don't recommend since they get all mushy.  Taste was good so will make them again using red potatoes.

I kept the skins on and used a regular potato.  I used the exact measurements of spices and it was AWESOME!!  I followed the advice of another reviewer changing the temperature to 425 - mine were done at 25 mins.  You won't be dissapointed.

these were good! I used red potatoes and I had to make it without marjoram and dill weed (didn't have any). Maybe it would have been SPECTACULAR with these, who knows? I think next time I'm going to broil for a bit too. The potatoes weren't crispy enough.

I also added Rosemary and left out the dill weed b/c I didn't have any.  Definitely put onions in there b/c they taste awesome.  Be sure to put something down so tha tit doesn't stick to the pan.  I had to cook this for about 45 minutes as well.

This was a great guide for roasting potatoes.  Sometimes I vary the different spices.  But, as long as you coat the potatoes well and give at least one stir while cooking they turn out great every time.  I also like to leave the skins on and they turn out very well.

Great recipe! These potatoes were very tasty, especially with the chili flakes for a bit of kick. I did find that they nearly burnt at 475. I would definitely go with 400 or even 375 next time.

Have making these for years.  Rather than using all the spices, which one does not have all the time,, just use what you have.  I usually just put in a plastic(ziploc) bag with the oil, shake the potatoes, put in the pan and shake cajun spice on top and roast until crisp

This has become a staple side dish at our house. We omit the red pepper flakes and do a few potatoes for our young daughter, then add them in and do ours. My husband eats his plain, I like mine with sour cream. Delicious

I made these last weekend for a party of 30--Wasn't sure how they would turn out.  I used red potatoes and followed the recipe--They turned out fantastic--I received so many compliments and people were upset there wasn't more--Will definitely make these again.

So easy and super yummy! Tossing the potatoes in a ziplock bag was the way to go. I did bake at only 425 and they came out perfect!

OMG these were soooo good even with all the spices (didn't use dillweed because i didn't have any). I cooked mine at 450F and they were cooked to perfection! I must say though my batch was quite spicy.. which isn't for everyone, but i loved it!

These potatoes are amazing! I just had my first dinner party and I served these along with baked chicken. I rarely put so many spices on potatoes, but I am glad I did! Anyway, here are a few changes I made... I omitted the dill weed, and added rosemary to compliment the spices on the chicken, and it turned out really well for me. I used red potatoes and did not peel them to keep in the nutrients, as others have suggested. Also, I followed the suggestion to lower the cooking temperature/time. I baked them at 400, then broiled them for 5 minutes to make them crispier. They tasted even better as leftovers the next day! This recipe is a definite keeper.

Excellent recipe!! Next time I'll cut back on the red pepper flakes jus a tad. They seem to hide the herbs just a tiny bit. That said, if you looking for an easy, tasty side dish, go no further you found it. ...and the bonus is the wonderful fragrance that fills the house!

i loved my version of this, but the recipe calls for way too many herbs. i pared it down to two herbs plus seasoned salt and garlic and OMG, it was sooo good. i also turned the broiler on for the last 5 minutes to get some good browning to the potatoes.

Absolutely great recipe.  I just used olive oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper and some chili powder.  I also par-boiled the cubed potatoes before tossing them with the oil and seasonings.  They were ready and delicious in 20 min. at 475 degrees.

I love this recipe; I make it often.  I quadruple the garlic and finish the dish under the broiler to give them a crisp coating (as other raters suggested).  I usually double the recipe for left-overs.

Great recipe, but don't use russet potatoes.  It took me almost an hour to bake them and they got stucked to my pirex.  I had to add a bit of water half way through cooking time because they needed more moisture in order to bake. Next time I'll use red potatoes.  I made a lamb recipe from this website and it was the perfect complement.  My guests were very amazed with the whole meal.  Thank you for the recipe, will do again.

Awesome recipe! I quartered unpeeled potatoes to save time, then cut down on the red pepper a bit and added some black pepper instead. Also added 1 tablespoon of Worchestershire Sauce, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and a bit of Rosemary for extra flavor. Tossed it into a 9x13 baking dish and put it the convection oven at 475 degrees. Stirring ever 10 minutes for 30 minutes to be extra crispy. Now I will make it every Saturday along with brats. MMmmmm!

These are delicious!  I love the spices and the perfect crispiness on the outside, but soft on the inside.  I served this at a dinner party and everyone was pleased.

I really enjoyed these.  I used red potatoes, and the only change I made to the recipe was to use 2 TBS of olive oil.  The cook time was right on with the potatoes I used.  Make sure to use a lined cookie sheet and coat it generously with non-stick spray.  I put a little ranch over them this time, next time I'll sprinkle them with cheese the last few minutes its in the oven.  Very yummy!

Great dish with good flavor and easy to make!  I even mixed in fresh brussel sprouts to the pan which made a good addition.  I made the mistake of dumping all the ingredients in a bag and shaking it up but too much of the spices stayed in the bag.  Had to scrape it out so next time it's a bowl.

i used 4.5 (one was small) yukon potatoes, cut them into smaller pieces w/ skin on, added them to a ziploc with the oil and the spices, and then mixed. i actually just used penzey's seasoned salt, which had all of the spices listed in this recipe, but unfortunately, i used way too much -- 4 tsp. it was quite salty (my own fault for just adding up the other quantities on the original). next time i'd use 2 tsp. and go from there. despite being too salty, they were fantastic and the original recipe is probably perfect.

These were good, but there is just way too much going on with all the herbs. Sometimes less is more. I say pick a few of your favorites and forget the rest. I'd say 3 stars, but my fiance really liked these, so 4 it is.

So delicious!  Even though I doubled the recipe, the kids gobbled them up until they were gone!  I only changed one thing- I did not peel the potatoes.

These are great and oh so easy.  I've been making them for months now and they come out perfect with red or white potatoes.  One change I made is using 2 t. of italian seasoning blend in place of the herbs.  I keep the salt, garlic, parsley and red pepper the same.  I also roast them for an hour in a 400 degree oven stirring every 15 minutes...

I tried this recipe and it turned out great. I didn't have all the seasonings though, so I used what I had in the prescribed quantities which was the garlic, thyme, oregano, chili pepper and of course, the salt. After reading about the sticking, i also greased the baking pan, so it wouldn't stick. To increase the fibre, I left the skins on on some of the potatoes, and peeled the rest. After cutting the potatoes, I also let them sit in some boiling temperature hot water for 5 minutes after reading a comment from one of the reviewers. I loved the idea of using olive oil. I didn't feel guilty eating this at all ;-)

These potatoes were excellent. They were a bit on the spicy side for me, but my husband literally moaned and groaned over them. He said that I could make them again anytime. They went great with the whole roasted chicken recipe submitted by INDRIANI.

Made these while on vacation in San Diego this past weekend. Paired them with Garlic Ranch Chicken (from this site also) and they were great. I did what the most helpful reviewed suggested... I used yukon/gold potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper, minced garlic, and about 1/2 the amount of basil/oregano/dill weed. 
I'm making them again this week. They do reheat well also, we ate them for breakfast the next morning with our eggs. They work out good as breakfast potatoes.
The only bad thing about them is they are so good you want to eat way more than you should!!

I also used red potatoes and baked them at 350 for about 50 minutes. Like others suggested, I put the potatoes in a large bag with the olive oil and the herbs for about ten minutes before baking. My husband and I loved the spice, taste, and texture of these potatoes that we ate every one--something that rarely happens.

A family favorite! I usually double the recipe and make no other changes except to cut the potatoes into smaller dice so that they brown nicely. Great accompaniment to any main-dish meat! [Edited: Just tried a new twist. I used part cubed red potatoes and part peeled, cubed yams, plus a sliced red onion. YUMMO!]

I make this recipe all the time. At least every other weekend. The only difference is, is that I let them marinate in the spices for about 1 hour in a ziploc bag. Then I grill them in a grill pan so they don't fall through the grill grates for about an hour till tender. I have also put them in the oven like the recipe says in the winter time and they turn out great!!

My husband loved these.  They were a little spicy for the kids, I'll probably cut back on the red pepper next time and add salt.

This is my favorite potato recipe, by far! I served it with vegetarian "meat"loaf.  The potatoes come out crispy and PERFECTLY seasoned. I used sea salt instead of table salt and excluded the dill (because I didn't have any). This is the first recipe I've ever tried where if no modifications were made, this recipe would still turn out perfect! Great recipe, Janet! Thank You for sharing!

Heavenly aroma, and an even greater taste. I used red potatoes, sliced and diced into bite-sized pieces, coated in half a cup of EVOO, generously added black pepper, rosemary & garlic blend. The key is to let the potatoes sit in the oil as they are roasting. You wouldn't believe how crispy the underside gets and how fluffy the inside becomes. 450F for 27 minutes. Mmmm.

We made these potatoes one night and liked them so well that we fixed them the next night again and then put potatoes on the grocery list so we can continue to fix them regularly!  We used red potatoes.  This is a very easy and tasty recipe.  The best.  I think they would hold in a hot oven for a long time.

They were good but the family prefers the olive oil with Lipton onion soup mix. I did not have marojam, next time I'll cut back the dill. Also, the recipe did not call for the pan to be covered with foil and the next time I will cover because some of the potatoes were drier than otheres. I also had to substitute Idaho baking potatoes because they were all I had in the pantry.

These were fantastic!  I was out of oregano and didn't have any marjoram so I substituted 1 tsp. of Italian Seasoning and they came out great.  Will make this one again and again.  Thanks.

These potatoes were tasty.  I didn't have minced garlic, basil, marjoram, or dill weed, but I did use garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and even Mrs. Dash, along with the other herbs and spices.  I also used more of the herbs than was stated in the recipe (otherwise the potatoes would have been bland and I like well-seasoned food!)They were easy to make, and I would make them again.

We loved this recipe, and it is just SO easy.  My potatoes stuck to the pan really bad, so make sure to turn them frequently and use lots of non-stick spray.  DELICIOUS!

Delicious. I knew I wanted to make roasted potatoes for supper tonight, but wasn't sure what spices to use. This recipe was a great guideline to work with.  I added more salt and pepper, and extra EVOO to prevent drying. Will definately make again.

Amazing!  We go to a local buffet occasionally that has these excellent roasted potatoes, and my wife and I always wonder how they make them and if we could make potatoes like that ourselves.  The last time we were there, I decided to try searching on this website for a recipe.  This was the first one I tried, and it may well be the only one I'll ever use.  The potatoes came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside - exactly the textures I was hoping for.  My wife and I both agree that they are even better than our favourite potatoes from the buffet.

I should mention that I didn't use all the spices listed in the recipe; I just used Italian seasoning and a pinch of salt.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and placed everything into a zippered bag so they could be shaken.

Thank you for an excellent recipe - it will certainly be made again here!

Really good, much more tender/less dry than I expected, and the flavor can easily be adjusted for individual tastes. (For anyone wondering, it works fine if you cook them at lower temps to match whatever else you're cooking.)

Very good and my kids loved them, too (I was worried about the crushed red pepper, but it was fine).  Had to cook them a bit longer than stated so they'd be crisper, though.  Next time, I'll try parboiling them first.    
The leftovers made a very tasty side dish the next morning; I pan fried them with a bit more oil -- yum!

A nice alternative to traditional roasted potatoes using dried soup mix.  The high temperature produced a crispy outer surface with a tender center.  If preparing this dish for children unaccustomed to spicy foods, omit or decrease the red pepper flakes.

I love roasted veggies.  I reduced the potatoes to just three and added about 20 baby carrots.  When there were only 5 minutes left to roast it all, I added 1/2 a cup of frozen peas.  This variated it a bit, adding taste and color.

This was very easy to make and is really flavorful. Up until now, my husband only ate "mashed" potatoes. He said "these are good.They actually have a lot of flavor". Just a tip: you can customize the flavor of these. If you don't like things too spicy, adjust the amount of cayenne pepper;if you love garlic, add more!!!

Made these several times now and think they are rather simple to make tasty. I put all the spices into a large ziplock bag, pour in the oil and potatoes and then shake and pour out onto a baking tray and fire 'em into the oven. However, if you cook them in a large glass baking tray and 'chuff' them (knock them about in the glass container so as to bruise them - this makes them more crispy and tasty) in the style of the Naked Chef - you'll be a culinary superstar. And yeah, double the spicy spices if you are so inclined.

THESE WERE GREAT! Everyone loved them...I personally added extra pepper flakes b/c I like my food spicy, and I also added extra minced garlic with some garlic powder sprinkled on top of the potatoes before putting them in the oven.
I would advise you add some grease spray onto the foil, as I noticed while cooking, the potates begin to stick and when you try to mix them around they just tear the foil.!

This was very yummy!  Good flavorful recipe.  I love all the herbs.  The only thing I would change next time would be to omit the red pepper flakes and use black pepper instead (like another reviewer) because it was too spicy for me, even though I reduced the amount.  Just personal preference.  I used skin-on yukon golds.  Good and simple!  Cooked in the specified time too.  Served with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan.

Really easy! I like to do this with red skinned potatoes too. Sometimes I'm lazy and just pour the oil over the potatoes and shake seasoned salt or other premade seasoning mix onto them. If you're cooking something else in the oven at a temperature lower than 475, you can do these as low as 350, they just take longer and aren't quite as crispy-brown.

My guy is a big fan of roasted potatoes!  I agree that the mix of herbs is different but quite good.  I did cut back the dill to 1/4 tsp and for anyone who had trouble with these sticking to the pan, make sure you are using olive oil, not extra virgin, the real stuff burns less at high heat.  I also baked these at 450.  Overall, pretty good! Thanks!

I used little Yukon potatoes instead of big potatoes, and I left the skin on.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  They weren't very crispy, but these potatoes taste great!  My husband and I loved all the spices.

This is my absolute favorite way to make potatoes, except I make them with red potatoes and fresh herbs instead.  Sprinkle Parmesan Cheese over them!  You will love these taters, I promise!

Very good! I used quarted red potatoes. Just enough spice and heat, and they were nice and crisp on the outside.

Couldn't be easier!  I used 2 pounds of red potatoes and left the skins on.  If you need these in a hurry, you can put them in a baking dish and cover with foil.  They will cook much faster but the result will be softer, creamier potatoes, instead of crisp, browned ones

I served these for Easter.  I substituted new, red potatoes, quartered and used four fresh garlic cloves, crushed.  I cooked along with my ham at 350 degrees for an hour.  Superb!

I really like the idea of this dish and I think the next time I make it, I will not follow the recipe so closely. Rather, I'll modify it to better accustom our tastes.  As the recipe stands (following it almost exactly) we didn't enjoy it.  First of all, the dill, a spice we typically enjoy, overpowered this dish as well as the TBLS of garlic. Unlike other dishes that go bad, (that you remove from your recipe box) I'm keeping it and just play around with it until I find the right spice combinations.  Thanks Janet.

My husband and picky 6-year old loved these, and so did I.  I followed everything exactly except I added only a tiny bit of olive oil.  Turned out great.  Maybe cut down a tad on the red pepper flakes, or absolutely no more than the recipe amount (husband and son thought it was a tad too spicy

I was so happy with the flavor of this recipe. I used red potatoes cut into wedges and it was fantastic. After reading the reviews, I generously sprayed oil on some foil and baked them on a cookie sheet. NO STICKING at all! Even my picky husband loved them. This is a definate keeper. Thank you Janet.

A great way to use up extra potatoes! I used peeled baby potatoes. Next time I won't peel them. I used 1/4 cup of olive oil and will do so next time as well. I didn't have all the herbs and spices so I just added what I did have with a little extra added. We're garlic lovers so I added 1 big tablespoonsful of garlic puree (delicious!) and some garlic pepper. I didn't have any red pepper flakes so I used just a dash of standard Indian hot chilli powder. Even a few dashes of hot sauce would substitute nicely for the red pepper flakes I think. The tiny bit of zip this adds is well worth it. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe.  These were as good as any oven roasted potatoes I've ever had.  I did bake them about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but I cut the potatoes in large wedges and didn't peel them.  It's a definate keeper.

I made this recipe last night for my family.  It was absolutely delicious with all the spices coming together.  I did not use traditional potatoes since I didn't have any on hand, but used the smaller assorted colored potatoes (purple, white and yellow), and it turned out so fantastic.  This is definitely a keeper of a recipe and thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

I didn't have the energy to peel the potatoes. So I just chopped them and followed the recipe from there. The skin made them taste great, just have to wash them really well prior.

I made this last night and it came out Delicious!! I didn’t add as many spices as it instructed. I did: sea salt, garlic salt, basil, pepper, & chili powder for that extra kick & EVERYBODY Loved it! Instead of 45 minutes I BAKED my RED POTATOES at 475 covered in Foil for 30 minutes then I mixed them around and left uncovered for 10 minutes on BROIL & it gave them a slight crunch factor not soggy??. MY NEW FAVORITE POTATOES RECIPE.

All five of my picky eaters loved these!!! I’ve made them twice this week and never have any left over. :) The only thing I modified was cutting back a little on the red pepper flakes (my boys are little and can’t handle a lot of heat).....but make sure you do incorporate them because they do make a big difference in the mix of flavor!

These were pretty good. I had a bunch of potatoes to use up and wanted a quick, easy side for dinner. Followed the recipe as is. Found the flavors a bit strong (little bit too many/much spice(s)), but otherwise delicious!

I've never roasted veggies so no changes to recipe - in fact I added some big cauliflower heads the last ~10 - 15 minutes of roasting - and it turned out better than I had anticipated - this year I was diagnosed type 2 diabetes and had to make some healthy choices for this year's Thanksgiving feast - these were a hit - we rotisseried the turkey so I made aus jus with the diced giblets instead of the heavy gravy and those stuffing muffins (also from this site)   - sure helped with portion sizes too! but with these roasted potatoes, the buttery mashed potatoes were not missed - and the next day my BS was 162!!  not bad at all considering - thank you very much for sharing great recipes and healthy choice ones as well -

This was yummy and easy. I cut up and threw in some rope sausage (like polska kielbasa), made some broccoli, and called it an easy weekday meal.

I used russet potatoes cut in long wedges.  I used all the spices in the recipe except the red pepper flakes - I'm sure they'd be good but I have little kids.  I added more oil than recipe said and a few tablespoons of freshly grated parmesan.  I added some roasted granulated onion.  I needed a finishing salt at the end, so maybe adding more salt into the spice blend would be good as well next time.  I baked single layer in 425 oven, flipping every 10 mins, and at the 30 minute mark even the thickest wedges were done.  This is simple and very good - thank you for the recipe!

It was so easy and taste good. I used red potato but still good. I think any potato can be used.

I had to cook them about 50 minutes at 475F. I loved the seasoning however my spouse rated them as just okay. She disliked one of the spices but could not tell me which one.

Delicious!  Made it exactly as the recipe stated (other than cooking it for less than 5 hours - used a meat thermometer and it took about 4.5 to get to 180) and everybody in the family loved it.  My picky daughter cleaned her plate and asked for more.  We finished one chicken tonight and will use the second chicken to make chicken fettuccine alfredo tomorrow night).

I found that the herbs were way to over powering for the amount of potatoes it says to use. The second time I made the recipe I only used 1/8 of each herb and then it was awesome!!

Agree with some of the reviews - a few too many spices going on with this. That said, i had never tried crushed red pepper with potatoes before and it was amazing! Def will try again with a couple less spices (will keep garlic, basic, thyme for sure).

This was VERY good!!!  The only thing I did different was I convection baked instead on the same temperature then I added splashes of lemon juice 15 min before it was done.  I got many many compliments and is definitely a keeper!!!  Thanks for sharing!!??

Made using Russet potatoes and cut into fry-size pieces.  Put in bag with oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper and then baked for the required time then broiled until brown and crisp.

Great herb combination!  Follow the recipe, and stir often so all sides are browned.  Yukon golds work well, and the flavor is great...475 makes the potatoes nice and crispy.  Perfect with a grilled steak marinated in olive oil, a little soy sauce and Montreal steak seasoning.  Add some extra EVOO to the spices and toss in a few dozen baby carrots.  Add a side  salad, and you've got a great meal!  Any leftovers?  Wonderful as hash browns with eggs for breakfast.

We weren't impressed. The seasonings were okay, but these were too spicy. We like spicy food, but this spice didn't seem to work well with the seasonings. If I were to make it again, I'd leave out the hot pepper seeds.

These are just amazing! Have made twice now and looking forward to the next time...I use fresh herbs as much as possible. I also use whatever kind of potato I have available with skin on and cut into same smaller size pieces. Thx for this recipe - it's a keeper!

I don't ever rate recipes...until now!  This is amazing!  I made it with a turkey sloppy-joe recipe and will definitely make this again!  Although I didn't have all the spices, substituted in rosemary, doubled it and baked for 45 minutes, it turned out GREAT!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

unbelievable! i didn't have marjoram and i used chili powder instead of flakes and it was amazing! no need to read the reviews to see what modifications need to be made, because none are needed, the temp and time is exactly right for crisp skin and soft insides.

We have made this so many times, and it's never failed. We just use whatever herbs we have on hand - sometimes more than is listed here, sometimes less. I stopped measuring the herbs, and I think they've gotten better because I know what we like more of. I've also started using a bit more salt than is called for, and always kosher salt. They really are a great side to have with just about any protein.

This is probably the best recipe I have ever found online. I am usually disappointed when I try new recipes, but this was a great exception! I did not have any garlic or red pepper flakes, so I just used the salt and other herbs. The potatoes were absolutely delicious. I plan on making them this way at least once per week from now on!

Not bad, rather hot though. I was not impressed. Maybe if they are fried instead of baked. They took about 40 minutes and weren't completely brown. I cooked them in 450°F heat. I also added Rosemary and left the skin on like other reviewers said.

Not a bad side.

Nice reecipe! I put my own touch on it by adding in chopped zucchini and placing the potatos and zucchini in a ziploc bag adding the olive oil and herbs there. It made it much easier to coat all the veges with herbs and oil.. Very tasty side dish to a well cooked steak ;-)

My husband loved these!  I enjoyed them, too, but they were a little bit too oily for me.  Next time, I think I'd use a little less oil--and I'd put them under the broiler so they would crisp up. Don't forget to stir them up  once in a while as you're cooking so you get all sides. :)

These are great!! I made them at Christmas and everyone raved about them! Don't listen to the other review saying that there are too many herbs and you should go more simple, follow the recipe to the T and you won't be sorry!! Making more right now.

So easy and you will most likely have everything on hand already (which I love).  These have a bit of a kick because of the red pepper.  Very good.

Turned out a bit dry for me and a tad too spicy. Will add some water & lemon, and reduce the red pepper flakes by half next time. Great base recipe to tweak with according to your liking!

Made this tonight to go with Chicken Picatta.  The only complaint I got is that I didn't make enough!  I didn't have red pepper flakes or parsley, so I added rosemary.  Definetly making this again!

I made this for Christmas dinner and changed a few things. I parboiled the potatoes first by putting them in cold salted water and then bringing them to a boil, removing them immediately and then mixing them with the ingredients for the recipe.  I added red onion, chives, and chopped shallots and garlic to the mixture as well and I think they came out good, except the crushed pepper flakes were a little too strong.  They were good and I do NOT think they needed the extra ingredients I added.  Next time I will make using half the crushed pepper flakes.

Very good!  Followed the instructions as is aside from the marjoram because I realized I didn't have any.. with just an extra dash of the crushed red pepper flakes.  I also had these in the oven for about 10 minutes longer.  Definitely will make again...goes well with steak!

These are a great side to any meal. My family loves roasted potatoes and these do not disappoint! I thought the seasoning was a little spicy but I don't do spices very well (for myself) but my teenager sons and husband LOVED these. I made them with the Herb rubbed sirloin tip roast from this sight. A Great meal for all!
Enjoy!!
PS. I had left overs and reheated for breakfast with eggs for a great morning meal too! 
In this age where every penny counts...
don't waste leftovers!

Super fast preparation and very tasty.  The red pepper flake really added a nice kick.  Thank you for the recipe!

Good but a bit on the herby side. I omitted marjoram, dill weed, and pepper flakes (don't like spicy). I added a bit of butter in the end. Overally, good side dish.

Followed the ingredients, but used a combination of Yukon and New Reds.  Forgot the minced garlic, so I added granulated garlic and more kosher salt after I spread them out on the cooking sheet.  I also added a full teaspoon of smoked paprika and substituted the red pepper flakes with my Firey chili pepper blend.   So far it is absolutely incredible. and the coloring from the extra virgin olive oil and smoked paprika make you want to try it by just looking at it!  Brian

I've gotten rave reviews on this recipe.  I now use it for other vegetables and just reduce the heat a little.  Excellent for almost any veggie.  I leave the red pepper flakes out since the rest gives all the flavor you could ever want.  It's a keeper.

the dish is pretty good, easy to cook, you can personalize the flavor. I took somebody's advice and only added garlic power, salt, pepper and some thyme. It turned out to be pretty good.

DELICIOUS!  My hubby and kids love this.  I make this a few times a month now.  (Oh, I never have dill week or marjoram so I just leave those out.  And we don't like it spicy so I just use a dash of crushed red pepper.)  Oh, and DON'T peel the potatoes...the skins are great on them!

These were SO GOOD. I didnt have the marjoram and used ground red pepper instead of crushed. And YUM these were great. I dipped them in sour cream. My cooking time was a bit off but thats to be expected depending on how thick you cut your potatoes.

I have made these several times now.  I use either the suggested spices or have even used the premixed McCormick Vegetable spices...the premix is saltier.  I too have cooked them at 350 and as directed...depending on time.

I love, love, love this recipe, and I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for one thing...the combination of herbs and the measurements given by the recipe tends to be too overwhelming especially for my family.  (I will take it one way or the other...)  I have made this recipe several times with some minor adjustments.  I, too, cut the temperature to 425 and I gauge the amount of time based on when I think the potatoes are done (generally 30-35 minutes).  I definitely use red potatoes with the skins on b/c they crisp up so nicely.  I cut the herbs in half, especially the red pepper since I have small kids.  Overall, the flavors, the way the potatoes get crispy and tender at the same time...make this a 4 star recipe.

I made it omitting dill, basil and marjoram. It is fantastic... My husband thought I baked these out of a bag :) but like suggested, I baked them at 425 for 35 minutes... They are perfect. The garlic is the key!

This recipe was really easy. I thought it wouldn't be enough oil for 4 potatoes but it really was. The spiciness was good as they seemed to get spicier when reheated. Would also make great breakfast potatoes.

Very easy to make and taste great. You can put whatever spices you have and will come out delicious. Will make again very soon. I've used red potatoes and regular ones too. Both great.

I love this recipe. My family likes really spicy foods so I added jalapeno slices and onion wedges to the mix. I always make more than needed because the teenagers love to heat them up as snacks.

This is always an easy go-to potato side dish for us. I don't like to cube the potatoes, but rather make 1/4" thick half-moon slices. They roast up faster that way! :) All those herbs make a flavorful coating to the potatoes and they always come out a crispy and golden perfection. Thanks for the recipe!  :)

My local COSTCO carries a three pack of Ottavio olive oil.  The three bottles are infused with basil, garlic and roasted pepper.   I used 1/3 of each for the olive oil which spread the flavor ALL OVER the place!   I also cut down on the number of herbs used that we do not care for, but included garlic and basil even with using the infused oil.

Awful. These herbs definitely conflict eachother. Basil and Oregano do not belong. Too much Thyme as well. I actually rinsed my potatoes off in water and seasoned them with my own mix of herbs de provance instead.

This recipe was so quick and easy.  My husband couldn't get enough.  The only thing i will do next time is use less red pepper flakes.  It was a bit too spicy for me but overall it was yummy.

I made these using small new potatoes which I scrubbed but did not peel.  They were a big hit!  I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I added a bit of chili powder.  I think I might add more the next time just to bump up the heat a little.

Very good, and easy to make. The herbs are lovely, and if you don't have one, or don't like one, they can be switched without detriment to the recipe. The red pepper flakes add a nice touch of heat,, but not too much. Thanks!

I used Yukon Golds and mixed everything in a ziploc bag. I also added a little extra cayenne and used fresh basil..Delicious! My husband and I enjoyed it for dinner, and then for lunch the next day.

Wouldn't change a thing!!!  I prepared it as directed, and I was a little worried that the herb/oil mixture would not be enough, but it covered all the potatoes wonderfully and the taste was amazing!  Even my 9 year old loved it.  Would definitely make again.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I disagree with using that much herbs in them... the flavor isn't that wonderful. I would stick with more simple like garlic, salt, pepper... YUM!

Love these!  I too, found the red pepper too spicy, but my husband loved it.  So here's what I do: put all of the ingredients except red pepper in a plastic bag, mix the potatoes and herbs, remove half of the potatoes, then add 1/4 tsp red pepper and mix the remaining half again.  I separate the non-peppered potatoes from the peppered ones on the baking sheet.  So we're both happy.  I also cook at 350 for 45 minutes, as a previous poster said.  They cook more evenly that way.

I don't really  cook and these were my first baked potatoes. This was so easy and so good!  I didn't have all the spices, just parsley, minced garlic, red pepper flakes (put less than suggested), thyme, and olive oil.  Used baking potatoes and left the skin on, and marinated overnight in the fridge.  Baked at 375 degrees for around 50 min on baking sheet and didn't need to cover.  It was crispy outside and soft inside.  Very yummy!

Perfect!  I cooked at 375 for about 45 min. I broiled them the last 10 minutes to make them crispy.  I also added a little bit of salt and pepper.  I loved all the different herbs on them.  It made for a very "pretty" presentation.  The garlic was delicious.  Thanks

Pretty good and simple.  Make a good side-dish but I would use a little less chili pepper flakes next time.  I love spicy but these took away from the flavor.

Mine didn't turn out as crispy as i thought it would. The herbs in the oil smelled great before it was cooked, but once the potatoes were done, i thought the flavors won't absorbed in the potatoes.

Excellent recipe! I have made roasted potatoes many time with this recipe and they are always delish! I use red potatoes. Sometimes I do not measure exactly- just throw round about amounts of the spices with the potatoes- and they are very good!!

Very easy and tasty too! You can do many things with this recipe to adjust for different tastes. I made it as it called for first, then played with it other times. It's a good one for your recipe box.

My husband says this is his favorite way to have potatoes, like french fries without the frying.  I tried using fewer spices and all the spices listed and we like the entire mix.  We also now prefer cutting the potatoes in wedges (as shown in the picture, but not as described in the recipe) which makes it easier to have a crisper outside and softer inside.  I also scrub the potatoes well and leave the skin on.

I really love this recipe. It's a nice way to use potatoes. It's different for me, because I make a lot of mashed potatoes.

Super easy and very versatile. I made these as a side dish for something that was already really seasoned. So, I kept these simple--a little garlic, pepper, salt, and some parsley. One thing that worked out well was lining the serving bowl with a paper towel. It just helped to draw any excess oil off before they hit the plate. Really great reheated for leftovers too!  Thanks!

We enjoyed this very much.  I did add a bit to much red pepper so it was a bit to spicy but overall the flavor was very good.  I did not use dill or marjoram since I didnt have any so instead I used some italian seasoning.

My family loved this. I added 2 T melted butter and cooked this at 425 degrees for 35 mins stirring once and then broiled it for 3 mins. It turned out so crispy and delicious. I also used about 8 small potatoes that were left in the bottom of my potatoe bag. Thanks for the recipe.

I used red potatoes since that's usually what I have on hand (and prefer), & left the skin on, but otherwise made as is.  I happen to like the big variety of herbs (regardless that certain 'experts' think we should all like something w/less stuff).  The ONLY reason I dumped this down from a 4 to a 3 is just because I didn't like the way they cooked.  The flavor was good, but I just didn't like them baked on a pan like that.  I've made similar wrapped in foil and was curious what baked on a pan would be like -- and I found out and didn't like it near as well.

Lots of flavor, wonderful. Used 1 1/2 # small white potaoes,cut in half and unpeeled, used cayenne (1/4 tsp)instead of pepper flakes, and it still had some nice spicy heat to it. You don't miss the butter with this recipe! Thank you.

I have simplified this recipe as follows: a couple to three TBSP of olive oil, some herbes de provence (eyeball it) and some salt and pepper. Bake 350 (convection oven) for about an hour give or take. Depends on how crispy you like it. I was also cooking rempels meatloaf and asparagus and garlic (can't remember the exact recipe ) at the same time.... These are the best oven roasted potatoes I've ever eaten,, so good.

I followed the tips from some of the previous reviews -- cut down on the spices, used black pepper, garlic, rosemery, and salt, preheated the pan with a little oil so the potatoes get crispy. Absolutely easy and delicious!

We really enjoyed these potatoes.  Followed the recipe using red potatoes and baked 350* for 50 minutes.  Perfect!
Have made several times and my family keeps asking for them.

Awesome!  I used what I had on hand, which is the only reason I differed slightly from the recipe, and they were great!  I used red potatoes (with skin), and rosemary instead of dill to avoid going to the grocery.  YUMMMMmmmmmm.

I always use this recipe as a guide for making fresh herb potatoes. I take red potatoes and cut them into 8 pieces. Then grab a bunch of fresh herbs from my garden: rosemary, thyme, oregano. Toss together with the oil (usually about 1/4 cup), crushed red peper, salt and minced garlic. I follow the cooking time and they turn out great. I think any combo of herbs would be excellent, dried or fresh.

Plenty of spice without adding red pepper flakes.  The potatoes wanted to dry out before they were finished cooking, so I covered with foil.  Really easy recipe with great flavor.

These were easy and delicious.  I looked them up at the last min and added whatever spices i wanted.  The recipe is so versatile.  I did not add the redd pepper flakes due to the 3 young children i have.  I also added baby carrots to it and they tasted wonderful as well.

Excellent potatoes! The first time I made these I left out the thyme because I didn't think I liked it. The second time I made them I used all the herbs called for and they were even better than the first! I always use SEA SALT which adds to the flavor, also. EVERYONE LOVES them. Thanks for sharing!!!!!

These potatoes are fabulous.  My whole family really enjoys them. I used Italian seasoning with a bit of extra garlic powder instead of all the smaller amounts  of all the different spices.  A hit every time I serve them.

These ended up getting burnt and stuck to the baking pan, but if you spray it with cooking spray first it should be ok.  They were good!

These potatoes were really tasty.  I didn't have dill weed and I added some fresh chopped parsley and fresh ground pepper at the end, but they were delicious.  We ate them along with Lentil Soup with Ribbons of Kale and they went together perfectly.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe. On the spicy scale, I would give it medium. So, if you're sensitive, you may want to leave out the pepper flakes. I didn't have marjoram, so I left it out. And, I had to add more oil. It wasn't enough to coat well. Enjoy!

Excellant!  Really loved the flavours, but I did leave out the marjoram since the store didn't have any in stock.  I added extra garlic and only cooked them at 350 because of the roast in the oven at the same time. They didn't come out crispy but it didn't matter. Will definitly be making these again, big time hit!

I only rate recipes that I truly make over and over and this is one of them!  You really have to try this one!  I do double the ingredients except for the dill. (double potatoes) Wonderful aroma and delicious flavor. Thank you Janet.

I followed this recipe exactly as written except for 8 people (therefore doubled).  It surpassed my expectations!  Everyone loved them.  I cut te potatoes in large chunks instead of cubes, but the ingredients were all the same as written.  The crushed red pepper flakes add a nice zing.

I will definitely make this again and again without hesitation.  It took approximately 30 minutes and I turned them over every 10 minutes or so.

Very good!  I probably used a few more potatoes and cut them into wedges instead of cubes and placed them around a roast I was making.  I also omitted the red pepper flakes.  Will use this recipe again!

Very good and easy to make. If I'm in a hurry I microwave the cut up potatoes for about 15 minutes before I bake them. Cuts the baking time substantially. I also add cut up red and green peppers, 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of freshly grated parmesan cheese. These are a big hit every time I make them - which is frequently!

I've tried this recipe twice and omitted dill weed both times simply because I didn't have any, and cut them into wedges. I baked them for 20 minutes at the suggested temperature. My family loved them!

These were nice.  I added 2 tsp of italian seasoning and the salt and pepper to 3 tbsp of olive oil.  Also, I lowered the oven temp to 450 and baked about 45 minutes.  Yum!

Great potatoes! I mixed and matched spices depending of what I had at hand - fresh basil and fresh rosemary instead of dried basil, marjoram and thyme. I used baby red potatoes, halved and with the skin on (more fiber!). They came out perfect. I will definetely do this recipe over, and over and over again!

Everyone always likes these. I also throw some baby carrots in there too. The variety of spices makes the final spice mix pretty flexible (if you're missing 1 or 2, you can substitute with what you have on hand.)

I used the basic instructions, but cut way back on the seasonings. I added fresh rosemary leaves, kosher salt, and freshly ground pepper for my seasonings. This light touch was perfect for my family. I did everything else as directed (including another member's suggestion to boil the potatoes 7 minutes first), and they came out crispy, and nicely browned, but still moist inside.

We really liked these and will definitely make again.  I thought they were pretty spicy but my husband said they were perfect.  Our 3 year old wasn't as impressed because they weren't "french fries" although she would eat them if they were dipped in gravy.  I guess you can't please everyone.  =)

I usually add spices to oven roasted potatoes, but I never used all of these at once.  Afraid that minced garlic would burn leaving it bitter, I used garlic powder instead.  I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne in addition to the red pepper flakes for an extra kick... yum.  Thanks for the amped-up version of an old favorite!

Love Love Love These!!!  My husband always request these healthy alternative to french fries.  They're also good with pearl onions... I slit them so they are a little more tender inside.  Thanks for this great recipe!

It's wonderful how something so simple ends up being so delicious!  My family gobbled these up quickly.  I only used 1/8 tsp. of red pepper flakes, and it was gently spicy---perfect for our taste.  I think without the red pepper flakes this would be just another herbed potato dish, so I'd advise keeping the red pepper flakes in the recipe.  We do not like dill, so I didn't add it.  I made this side dish with Beer Butt Chicken from this website, and they were perfect together! Also had some sweet steamed carrots with it and had a well-balanced meal.  I will definately be making this one again.

These were only O.K.  Wouldn't make again not because they were horrible but because I've had better.

These were okay.  Nothing special.  I think I like them the way I normally do them just throwing in various spices like garlic, pepper, and especially rosemary.

I made this for a group of 60... what a hit.  I skipped the dill as I am not fond of dill, and reduced the red pepper flakes as children were also eating it.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  I have many requests for the recipe.  Thanks so much!!

We really like these.  I am generous with the spices and I do not peel the potatoes.  I mix the spices in a small bowl.  Separately, I put the cut potatoes in large bowl and stir them with the olive oil (more than 1/8 cup) to coat.  Then I put the spice mixture in the bowl with the potatoes and stir until thoroughly coated.  Put them in the oven until they are crispy.  Very tasty!

This was extremely simple but didn't taste like it.  I didn't have dill weed so I left it out and it was still 5 stars.  I used baby gold potatoes and didn't peel them.  It was a huge hit -- I served it with pot roast.

yummy, this is a keeper.  I didn't use the crushed red pepper flakes and added more salt.  I put all ingredients in a ziploc bag, mixed by kneeding and added the potatoes to coat.  I used red potatoes and didn't peel them

I just made this for company on Saturday and it was a big hit.  Used Marjoram, Italian blend, Garlic powder, Red Pepper flakes, salt and dill with olive oil over potatoes and baby carrots.  Huge success, absolutely delish.  Will definitely make this again.

I love using a lot of spices so this was for me.  I used baby potatoes and a little extra garlic.  Nice flavor, good presentation, easy prep.  This will get added to my "dinner party recipes" file.

I would leave out the red pepper flakes the next time because we don't like spicy... but the flavor of the herbs was excellent. I also added carrots and onions.

Delicious. I used 6 potatoes because mine were on the small side, and I used sage instead of marjoram since I didn't have any of the marjoram. Other than just a splash extra olive oil, I kept everything else the same, and they turned out great. Ate them with vegetarian baked beans.

These were easy,easy,easy and sooooo good.  I only used the spices I had and left some out. I cut back on the red pepper as someone else advised.  Everyone in my family loved them.  This will become a standard in our house.

So many good reviews and my question is why?!  I really didn't care for
this recipe at all.  Nothing great about these potatoes and the
leftovers were awful the next day!  I'm giving it 2 stars because my family did eat it, but I honestly think they were being nice....I will not make again, sorry....

We served these potatoes with grilled tenderloin steaks - they were a really good combination. I can see serving the potatoes for a breakfast sidedish alongside eggs and bacon as well. They were very easy to prepare, but we had problems with them sticking to the cookie sheet. Next time I'll spray the sheet with Pam or put down a layer of aluminum foil to avoid the sticking. We threw in a handful of chopped onion and left the skins on the potatoes - both just added to the flavor. We will make this one again.

WOW these were great.  I used fresh basil & oregano because I had it and didn't use the thyme or marjoram as I didn't have those, yet they still tasted wonderful.  Oh and I used a fresh chili instead of the flakes.  Was minding 3 girls aged 8 - 15 and they really enjoyed and didn't complain about the chili. Served with the Cola Pot Roast on this site.
Will definatley be using this as my standard potato recipe from now on.

I did not have marjoram, thyme, or red pepper flakes (added some hot sauce); turned out delicious.  This side dish is really pretty w/ all the herbs coating the potato; the skin (did not peel) was crispy, while the potato was soft.  Serves very well with meatloaf (lightly dip some of your potatoes in ketchup... it tastes like fried potatoes mom serves on Sunday mornings!)

Yummy! I added a little more olive oil, salt and pepper than what was called for and they were terrific.

Very tasty, even if I am missing an herb or two they still taste great. Can cook along with meat or poultry for an hour at 365 degrees or so.

These potatoes were good, nothing special though.  I cooked mine for about one hour at 350 degrees to ensure doneness.  They smelled great while cooking, but the taste was pretty ordinary.  None of my guests were ooohing and aaahing over them.  If you need an easy side dish in a hurry, this the recipe for you.

I love having things I can throw in the oven and forget about while I am entertaining. These were so easy to prepare and very easy to cook. Next time I might throw in some other vegetables to roast with the potatoes.

Made for a BBQ the other night and it was good.  I will be the first to admit that I did NOT follow the recipe exactly...I tinkered with the spices in order to suit our tastes...(mainly reduced amounts). I saw some reviewers say that the spices were overpowering so I figured I would tinker the first time.  Thanks for the post.

I love this recipe!  I was glad to find it because I was getting sick of mashed and baked potatoes.  The flavor was great and it made the kitchen smell amazing. I added a little garlic powder to the spices and used Kosher salt.  Even my picky daughter gobbled them all up.  Definately a keeper.

These were great.  I added some onions and carrots and broiled it for a few minutes after baking.  I didn't measure the ingredients but put in what felt right to me.

These potatoes are really good!  I served them with Sloppy Joes II from this site and a salad for lunch and my husband had 2 helpings!  I did make a few changes though.  I omitted the dill weed because I just don't like it, and I also didn't have any marjoram on hand, but I did add 1/2 t of rosemary.  They turned out wonderfully!  I will be making these often!

Woo-wee these were good.  I actually made one and a half of the recipe, but I only added enough garlic and salt for one recipe, and it was perfect!  This is an awesome recipe and I will definitely make it again!!!

If you want a little more spice, try adding Old Bay seasoning (I found it near the fish aisle in my food store.)  My husband adores these potatoes!

I used baby red potatoes which got a bit charred in the roasting pan.  Truth be told, I didn't turn the potatoes as the recipe said.  I also think less time is needed for roasting baby red potatoes which I cut in half.  Otherwise, even though it was charred, it was still awesome!  I'll make this again, make sure to turn the potatoes and roast it for a lesser amount of time. Maybe 20 minutes.

This is by far the best and easiest roasted potato recipe I have found.  I also roast carrots and onions together with the potatoes and wow!  You could do eggplant, zucchini...the possibilities are endless!

These are very good!  The main thing to get from the recipe is the general technique/oven temp/cook time.  You can really use plain vegetable oil and any seasonings you like and get good results.  Really recommend using Yukon Gold potatoes!

These were good, nothing out of the ordinary.  Tasted like roasted potatoes that I've made myself before by throwing stuff together.  I like a lot of flavor in my food.

Absolutely love this recipe. I make it often, because my husband truly loves potatoes and it is his favorite!   I don't change any of the ingredients.  My daughter also got this off the internet and made it for us, not knowing that it is one of our favorites.  Big hit!  Thanks

They were very good, but i found that they needed something but i don't know what.  Maybe i'll use all butter instead of olive oil maybe that will help, but we will definitely be making this recipe again.

Yummy!  Everyone loves this dish!  My husband doesn't really like potatoes, and he loves this because there's so much flavor!  They're so easy to make, too... it's definitely a new favorite.  I usually add all of the herbs, but sometimes when I don't have all of them, I just add what I do have, and they still turn out great.  The garlic and red pepper flakes add a little kick to them, though, so if you like that, they're essential!

Excellent recipe!  I used red potatoes with skins, par boiled them and seasoned them overnight.   They were ready to throw in the oven the next day and they cooked to perfection!   A big hit!  Thanks Janet!!

So easy and smells so good cooking!  I used the ingredients listed but didn't peel the potatoes.  I chose to put them in a glass casserole dish so they would come out soft (not crip) to conform to blend better with my meal.  Everyone loved these, and my 2-year-old ate every bite.  Thanks for this great recipe, it will replace my traditional pan fried  recipe!

Sooooooo good!  Made these several times and everyone just loves them. Instead of baking them in the oven, I put them in a foil pan and cook them on the barbecue grill.

use fresh herbs... parisenne potatoes work well, if not white potatoes leave the skins on... 
Add a bit more oil, 
Excellent accompaniment to any meal.

Had this last night.  Very good.  Very easy.  Had no dill weed on hand, but spices blended nicely.  Think I will try this again with breakfast, instead of hashed browns.

I made this one evening for dinner company. It was moist and tasty - everyone loved it! I would probably substitute red new potatoes if I made it again, though. They hold their shape better and are perfect for dishes like this.

This recipe is very versatile. I’ve used it many times, always adding whatever herbs and spices are complimentary to the main dish for the evening. Couple of tips. One is that after taking the potatoes out of the oven, if you put them on a cooling rack for about 5 minutes, they will not get soggy. Also, I like my potatoes crispy so will usually bake them a bit longer. Just watch for the amount of done ness that you prefer.

I made the recipe mostly as instructed except had to use Garlic powder instead of minced garlic because that was all I had. Also, omitted marjoram because I didn't have any. 
Was still excellent! Company loved them too they asked for recipe to take home.    New favorite for our household.

It must be the combination of the marjoram with the other herbs that folks aren’t liking. I don’t have marjoram. So, I just used all the other ingredients, and they turned out stellar! I made these once before with the proper amount of potatoes. This time, I only had three medium-small potatoes. So, I threw in some cauliflower to make up the difference.

These are AMAZING and so easy!  I used red potatoes because they are a family favorite and changed the seasonings to match our preferences.  The best thing about the recipe is the cooking method-you can change the flavor with different spices, but the cooking method is the key.  I did lower the temp to 425 and cook for 35 minutes.  Fabulous!!

Very good recipe. Has just enough spice with the red pepper flakes. Some say they thought it had too many herbs and they would clash but I don’t find that to be the case at all. Excellent flavor!

This was super delicious. I didn’t have any marjoram or basil, so I used everything else. I also added a 1/2 tsp of onion powder. This was amazing even with the missing ingredients. I can only imagine how much more flavorful it would’ve been with them. My picky eating pre-teen requested it for her lunch the next day after tasting it. Love it love it.

Absolutely delicious and super easy!  I am allergic to onions, so it is nice to find something I can fix without having to remove the onions and try to substitute something else for the onions.

Been making it for years except I toss the cubed potatoes with the dry herbs first, let it stand for at least 20 minutes then add and toss with olive oil.    On the side I saute yellow onions and green peppers and toss with the potatoes after they come out of the oven.  I've also added diced ham chunks of Italian sweet sausage (hot is good too ) on occasion.  Those wonderful, versatile potatoes! Yum.

Simple and delicious! My only suggestion is check the potatoes after the 20 minute mark. I waited too long after 25 minutes in oven.

I have made this more times than I can count. The only difference being, 375º oven for 60 minutes and I ‘flip’ the potatoes every 15 minutes. Put the cubed RED potatoes into a bowl, drizzle with Olive Oil and seasonings, stir to cover the potatoes (and sometimes baby carrots), put into oven safe baking dish.

While this is ‘Italian’ in seasoning, I also use Tex Mex or Greek seasonings, depending on what the main course is. 

Oh, and Sea Salt and fresh Cracked Pepper is a must.

Very good and hubby approved.  I skipped the oregano and the red pepper flakes (since I didn’t have any) and used a mix of baby potatoes, halved.  Baked on the 2nd rack from the top at 425.

I minced some fresh garlic ahead of time and stored it in the fridge until it was time for the potatoes.  In all of my excitement of mixing the rest of the spices, I had forgotten about the garlic. I would make this again, only add the garlic and hold the red pepper. Maybe add some parmesan or Romano cheese.

I made it by the recipe but cut Russet Potatoes in thin circles. The potatoes tasted good but were not as crisp as I would have liked for them to be. Next time, I will leave off make sure that each potato doesn't overlap with another one and leave off the red pepper flakes because it was too hot for my taste. Very few points on WW so it was a winner for me! I will make them again!

I will continue to use this recipe as a template, but I used different herbs and seasoning, as well as adding minced garlic and sweet onion. I also added 1/4 cup water after the first 10 minutes. This allowed for browned, but softer, well cooked potatoes.

I made these potatoes the other night with a prime rib. The potatoes were so tasty. I used small round potatoes and cut them in half. I also added onion powder, garlic powder instead of minced garlic, a bit of parsley and dry mustard. They turned out awesome.  I picked this recipe because of the reviewers comments. So thank you to everyone who took the time to review this recipe.

So easy and delicious, but takes time, probably because  I made a 5 lb bag of potatoes in a larger Roasting pan and adjusted the amount of ingredients accordingly. Also added Thyme and Rosemary- you can add any spices you prefer.  When adding liquid also added 10 garlic cloves halved. Excellent dish!!! Family and friends loved it.

Am having fun with this recipe.  I'm an inexperienced foot-dragging sort of cook so recipe play is something new.  Have made it four times, making slight changes each go-round.
475 was too high in my oven, causing pieces on the sides of the pan to burn a bit, so I reduced it to 425 and increased the cooking time from 20/30 to 40 minutes.
Have used all the spices with each attempt, subbing garlic powder for minced garlic a couple times, deciding the bottled minced garlic was as good, not better.  
The red pepper flakes made it too spicy for husband so I left them out altogether and added ordinary ground pepper to my serving.
The fun part came from adding big pieces of one each green, yellow and orange bell peppers, one cabana pepper and a large sweet onion.  The fourth time I reduced the potatoes to about three,  thereby changing up the proportion of potatoes to veggies so reduce starch.
One time I added cherry tomatoes I had on hand.
At my cooking time/temp the peppers and onion are softer than some folks might prefer but the potatoes are cooked through.  Really dislike half-cooked potatoes.
Doubled the oil and spices to accommodate the veggies.  There was too much bulk for a cookie sheet but my giant lasagna pan with 5" sides worked perfectly.  The potatoes wanted to stick and burn, despite interim stirring.  Lining with foil, sprayed with cooking oil made cleanup easier.
On the 4th attempt I added a couple cups of large white mushrooms, just washed and halved.  Didn't know

Delicious,  picky hubby even loved them. The only alteration I made was swapped out the red pepper flakes with Paprika since hubby can't handle spicy things.   Used the leftovers for breakfast bowls  the next day with poached eggs.

I followed this recipe exactly except that the baking was done in a NuWave oven that has a max temperature of 425 degrees. At about 20 minutes, the potatoes were done and plenty browned, but did not at all have a crispy outside. One thing I did do differently was to add the oil and all of the seasonings to a gallon zip lock bag. When I got them mixed together, they  were thick and paste-like. So I spread them out in the bag and coated both sides of the bag before adding the potatoes. This made it easier to coat all of the potatoes  than trying to mix them in a bowl. The resulting potatoes were tasty, but the outside was leathery rather than crispy. Next time, I may try broiling them to crisp them, but if this is necessary, it should be included in the recipe. By the way, the insides of the potatoes were perfect. I just wasn't happy with the lack of crispness.

Loved this recipe. It's been a while since I made roasted potatoes so I came around to this recipe and it's just right! I supplemented different herbs that I had vs. some in the recipe which I lacked. I also used a "secret" ingredient seafood seasoning "old bay"

You can't go wrong with potatoes in my opinion.  I thought these were great and will definitely be making them again. The only thing I didn't put on there was the crushed red pepper, just because I can't handle anything very spicy.  I did leave them in a little longer than I should have and the smaller pieces where crispy on the outside but that wasn't' the recipes fault.  Family loved them.

These were so tasty, even my kids said this recipe "is a keeper."  I reduced the red pepper flakes (I used crushed red pepper) to 1/4 tsp because we are wimps when it comes to spicy food.
The pan was hard to clean so I will use foil next time.

Perfect as written. Lovely savory combination of herbs. My grandchildren loved nibbling the coating off the potatoes, and ate the potatoes as well. Don’t increase the oil or potatoes at center of the pan could get soggy. I made plain roasted potatoes tonight and my husband reminisced over this recipe I had made earlier in the week.

We like spicy food, salsas, etc. and this was too hot. The red pepper flakes totally overpowered the herbs. I'l  make it again sans the pepper flakes.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It smelled and looked delicious going in the oven and even baked up beautifully.  However, I didn't love the flavor, and I personally didn't love the  way they were so crispy and really brown outside and still so soft inside.  I have another favorite potato recipe that bakes for longer at 400.  I think I'll stick with that  combo for my potatoes.  As far as the spices, I don't know if it was just too many different flavors going on or what, but the flavor was just really odd. I used a fraction of the red pepper and still thought they were randomly spicy without much flavor.

These taste pretty good- it's hard to go wrong with roasted potatoes- but I thought there were a few too many seasonings used. None of the flavors conflicted, but it was kind of an overpowering flavor combination for such a simple food. I did like the kick of the red pepper flakes, something I think you don't often see in recipes for this sort of dish.

If you like your potatoes with a little kick...you will love this!  Easy and good.  And the spice is a nice change from what I normally have.

I mixed in carrots, onions, and bell pepper and baked it for 35mins in a 220C oven. Great recipe for roasted veggies, made for a great side dish to our Christmas ribs.

It was ok. I used red potatoes. Had to add more of everything otherwise it would have been dry & tasteless. The better recipe is found in the Lipton Savory Herb dry soup but I didn't have that so I tried this instead. It was ok, nothing to rave about tho

I've made these with various themed herb mixes (Italian, Mexican, Cajun) and all came out very well. I added a couple of tablespoons of butter to the olive oil to add flavor and help to brown them up a bit more. This is a great basic  technique that can be dressed  up or dressed down depending on the meal you're planning.

Great recipe! Very easy and adaptable to personal tastes. I used foil and an oiled baking rack and didn't bother with "turning" potatoes and they turned out. Just make sure you don't dice potatoes smaller than grates of rack!?

Used 1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of minced, omitted dill weed,  used 8 baby red potatoes quartered instead of 4 large, roasted the full 30 minutes.  My whole family loved it, even the picky eater.  Very healthy, with only 1/8 c oil!

I can't believe I'm writing this, because I LOVE spices, but this recipe had too much spice! Otherwise, it is your basic recipe for oven fried potatoes. Perhaps I didn't care for the particular combination of spices in this recipe? I can't quite put my finger on why, but I just didn't really like these.

Stupid easy, and it takes 5 minutes to prep this.  I've actually mixed about a half-cup of this spice blend and stuck it in a jar for easy shaking.  The potatoes really are at their best when flipped halfway through. Also, a very simple recipe for me & developmentally disabled sister to make together.  She has added this to her "I can make this now!" repetoire, along with a a gift of a metal glove for cutting (highly recommended--I actually wear them on both hands).

     I've also made this adding sumac (kind of a lemony zingy spice from your middle eastern markets (sumac is to DIE for on poultry, fish, even eggs).  
     My third try was with cumin, coriander, turmeric, freshly ground sea salt & black pepper.  

I like potatoes.

Great for breakfast with eggs and bacon.  I like to cook them at 450F for the first 30-40 mins then finish at 475F they seem to get a little better done and have a  nice golden brown finish that way.

Definitely a crowd pleaser.  If you're short I time, may I recommend microwaving potatoes (red or gold) whole with skins on and then place on baking sheet.  Use the bottom of a glass and smash the potatoes.  Brush on herbs and olive oil, bake at 350-375* for 30 minutes.  Perfectly baked and super yummy EVERY TIME :)

Great recipe!  We are not dill fans, so left that out.  Came out great and will make again.  I used Yukon gold potatoes and cut the pieces really thin.  Thank you for a great recipe!

The best potatoes!
My husband loves them and he is very picky 
I leave out the dill and red pepper flakes and use white potatoes from my garden. The most wonder flavor.

I made some changes because I didn't have all the herbs on hand - so I only used green herbs and salt and olive oil. Amounts are just right. Added savory and rosemary, left out dill weed, garlic, parsley and red pepper. They were amazing, thank you for a great base recipe!

I recommend spraying your pan with olive or canola oil before putting cut potatoes on.  I like the taste but because they stuck to the pan they really didn't brown as shown in the video.  I will make again but adjust the one part.

My family loved these potatoes.  I didn't measure the spices or the oil but otherwise I followed the recipe. I used baby Dutch Yellow potatoes. They came out nicely browned and tender.  I'll make this again!

Didn't use all the spices but def used the method!  Cut them in wedges, used garlic, salt, pepper and basil in with the olive oil.  Cooked the wedges on convection and they were done faster than I expected  Will make them again.  Thanks!

I added dry minced onion. Also I cooked them in the microwave oven. Takes about 15 min in high, turning the potatoes every 5 min. Very soft and flavorful!

I loved this recipe with my modifications- Instead of the spices listed above, I used minced garlic, rosemary, pepper, & salt as my spices. After cooking to about 25 minutes at 475 degrees, I broiled the potatoes to give it that nice crispy finish!

I love these potatoes. I do add rosemary and either garlic pepper or lemon pepper, but following the original and it's still 5 stars, I just prefer a bit more umph.  Sometimes I'll decrease the salt in the initial prep and then when hot out of the oven, sprinkle of kosher salt.  I also use red skins or fingerling potatoes.

By far the best roasted potatoes I have ever made (confirmed by my husband). Possibly the best roasted potatoes I have ever had anywhere! I used a bag of the small buttercream potatoes. I left out the parsley and red pepper as they are not my preferred flavors. I also cooked them until they were crispy which ended up being about 45 minutes. Everything else I did exactly the same. 
Delicious! Thank you for posting the recipe!

These were really good! Better than plain old French fries. I really like the herb combination. Served with Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter, salad, and Fabulous French Loaves.

Great recipe! I didn't actually have the rhyme and the dill but the end result was still delicious. I ended up sprinkling some shredded mozzarella on top after pulling the tray out of the oven. It melted on the potatoes in a matter of seconds and made both the taste and the texture more interesting.

Great recipe! This made my kitchen smell like I had been cooking all day. What a wonderful change from the regular potatoes I cook all the time. I will be keeping this in my recipe box.

Great tasting potatoes.  I made as written with the exception of roasting at 375 for 45 minutes and not peeling them.  They were so good that the family requested I make them for breakfast the next day!  I served this with Lebanese stuffed onions and Chef John's 5 spice carrots for dinner.

So delicious & easy! If possible substitute the dried herbs for your own garden grown herbs & add fresh chives. It makes ALL the difference! This will definitely be a go-to recipe for dinner!

This was easy and tasty. The only thing I would change is to reduce or eliminate the red pepper. It was a bit too spicy for me.

I have made this twice with perfect results - beautifully browned and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  I followed the recipe except used herbs de Provence in place of the herbs listed.

I made 10 pounds of these potatoes for Easter. Everyone loved them! I used new red potatoes. I didn`t have marjoram, but it wasn't missed. I made them in the roaster oven so the ham could be in the oven. These are going to be my go to potatoes when we are hosting a group.

This is a great recipe and so easy!  I used Italian seasoning instead of all of the individual items and then I added the dill weed and parsley.  I added a little butter to them at the end.

Tasty.  Loved all the herbs but skipped the red pepper.  Plain nonfat Greek yogurt makes a great "sour cream" for them.

My husband asked for roasted potatoes with more flavorful seasoning than the rosemary potatoes that I usually fix. These really did the trick.  I cut back on the olive oil a bit and they were very Weight Watchers friendly.

Less is more! I tried this recipe exactly as written and found the combination of flavours a bit overwhelming. In subsequent attempts I decided to limit the seasoning to only one or two herbs and made a few other changes as well: 
- I parboiled the potatoes for about 6 minutes in rapidly boiling water;
- In "phase 1" I coated the potatoes in half olive oil and half butter, seasoned with salt and pepper, then roasted for about 30 minutes at 375 degrees;
- In "phase 2" I added a bunch of fresh rosemary (leaves coarsely chopped) MIXED with about an 1/8 cup of olive oil, a large clove of garlic put through a press, and a TBSP. of red wine vinegar, stirred into the hot potatoes then continued to roast for another 40 minutes at 375 degrees, stirring occasionally;
- I've found that using a heavy cast-iron fry pan for the entire process enhances the browning and crispiness;
- This recipe also works GREAT on a BBQ and the flavours are even further enhanced.

This has become a favorite for us as a side to almost anything. I usually use less olive oil, and it still comes out nice and crispy with tons of flavor.

This is a great, healthy and easy recipe. I do find that red potatoes are best. I sprinkle some paprika over the potatoes too. It doesn’t alter the taste but it looks good. Also, if you don’t have fresh garlic, garlic powder will do

This was a great recipe... The potatoes were delicious... I left out the crushed pepper as my guests comprised of finicky kids... Gladly they were a hit... I did cook them at a lower temperature (400) and monitored it after I turned them 20 minutes later.

Very good! So easy to throw together and toss in the oven if you are roasting something else for dinner. I baked at 400 F due to another item in the oven but they were still done after about 35-40 minutes. I added pepper and onion powder to round out the mix and also left the skins on. They had excellent flavor and were gobbled up. Definitely follow the directions and turn them a few times while they are in the oven so they get browned all over.

I used red potatoes and carrots and felt the end result was a little dry. I think I roasted them a bit too long. But definitely worth trying again. The overall flavor was very good.

Followed the advice of some of the others.  Along with the potatoes, used the oil, salt, parsley a little of the red pepper and then some regular black pepper and garlic powder.  Also cooked at closer to 400 degrees and just roasted a little longer.  Excellent.  Will definitely do again.

I made this recipe as part of Christmas dinner. I followed the recipe but reduced the temp to 350 degrees and cooked with my corn pudding for 1 hour 15 minutes. Perfect. Crispy but not dried out. Definitely keeping this recipe.

Very good. Made the recipes exactly as described. I did think it was lacking a little salt. I think next time I'm going to finish these with a little parmesan cheese.

It just doesn't get any easier than this. I use all different kinds of different herbs and spices and potatoes and just vary depending on what I'm eating with it. I have some in the oven right now for my hubby's lunch tomorrow and just used garlic Mrs. Dash on russets and I know he will love them!

so easy to throw together and everyone loves it! I leave out the dill weed because it seems like it wouldn't taste good with the other herbs, but maybe I'll try it some day just to see if there's something to it.

These potatoes are delicious with a nice zing.  I didn't change a thing on this recipe and I'm glad I didn't.  I roasted them for 40 minutes because we like them crispy on the outside.  They were nice and soft on the inside.  I let them marinade in a ziploc bag for a few hours for maximum flavor.  Definitely will make them again.

Yum! Left out dill and marjoram, didn't have any, added baby carrots as per another review and this turned out awesome! No leftovers which was kind of disappointing....

This was good with the herbs mentioned, but we change up the herbs and most of the time use less variety.  I leave skins on too, and roast them quite long... I like when they get nice and crispy.

My husband said tonight after dinner "Well, you've found the perfect recipe for these potatoes!"  I didn't have any marjoram and probably used a lot more crushed/ground red pepper than most people would ever use but we like spicy:)  they were so yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

They are very good. I didn't add the dill only because I didn't have any. My husband said these are gourmet potatoes. Awesome

Very good - made these with the Parmesan Sage Pork Chops (used tenderloin) and they were great together.  The red pepper flakes add just a little zip which was just about perfect.

I squirted a dash of lemon juice on the raw potatoes and it gave it a nice summery kick. Make sure to do a light coat of non-stick cooking spray on the pan or else it gets pretty messy. Overall we loved this- quick & easy, the perfect accent to almost any meal!

Absolutely LOVED these potatoes! My boyfriend asks me to make these again and again now :) The rich smells and the taste of the combined herbs are amazing. I usually make these when I'm planning a Mediterranean menu but really anytime is good :)

My husband and I loved these potatoes.  I cut out the dill, marjoram, and pepper flakes.  I also used red potatoes cut into slightly smaller than 1/4ed cubes.  I think there were still too many spices and will experiment with fewer next time.  I did like that they cooked so quickly at 475, so I would still do that the next time.

Very good! I used red new potatoes and baked them at 450 degrees for 25 minutes. For herbs, I used garlic, basil, marjoram, dill weed, salt, and red pepper flakes. I loved the flavors! I will definitely be using this recipe when I want potatoes!

I made this for guests along with Chicken Cordon Bleu II and Prosciutto Wrapped Asparagus. They were top-notch! I sliced a little Parmesan over them during the last 10 minutes. Neither I nor my guests thought the herbs clashed at all.

I am giving this a 4 star rating because my husband and son loved them and gave them 5 stars. My daughter and I, however, found them to be too spicy for us and gave them a 2 or 3 star rating. If you like spicy, these are for you. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I baked them at 425 for 35 minutes.

I thought these were pretty good.  They didn't 'wow' me, but I would make them again.

I didn't have any problem with the potatoes sticking.  I used garlic salt instead of minced garlice as it was all I had.  I added a bit of red onion and cut back on the spices.  I stuck with salt, pepper, garlic and a little basil.  They turned out great!

Lovely! Absolutely delicious. I used  baby potatoes with the skin on, halved or quartered. The crushed red pepper added an unexpected spicy twist. Did not have any marjoram available, but I added some rosemary and dry mint to the herb mixture. Very easy, will definitely make again.

Leave the skin on half of them. Makes them healthier and taste better. Great recipe!

These were really good. Luckily I had all the spices on hand. I only used half as much red pepper because I don't like things too hot and it was just right. 
My husband liked them also. It's a simple recipe and doesn't take much time. They were done in about 20 minutes. I will def. be making this again.

Very good and easy.  With the 1 tsp red pepper flakes, they came out slightly hot for my family's taste - would half the red pepper next time.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I usually make this for special occasions or when I have company coming over. My whole family loves this recipe. I have also started using this herb mixture in my mashed potatoes too, and it is AWESOME. I make 5lbs of russet potatoes, add 1/2 cup of butter, 1/4 - 1/2 cup of milk (to consistency), and this herb mixture and they are the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. We make those about 2-3 times a week...lol. Thank you SOOOO much for this WONDERFUL recipe.

After reading many reviews on this recipe, I was excited to try it. I followed the recipe except I didn't put in any dill weed and I baked it at 350 for 50 minutes. I thought they were a bit bland. I really don't understand how some of the reviewers think it has too many different spices and needs to be toned down a bit. I personally think it needs more of something. Maybe more salt. But I think I will make this again.

These have a good flavor.  I did over bake them.  I should have taken them out of the oven at least 10 minutes sooner than recommended.  Some of them were a little too burnt for my liking, but that was my fault.  I will make them again and watch the reduce the baking time.  I like the combination of spices on these fries.

Wow, these are better than I guessed they would be! I used 6 medium red potatoes and I left out the dill and marjoram because I read a lot of reviews stating that there's too much going on. Well they were awesome and really, the next time I would add even less different kinds of spices and I know that they would be just as good. I do like what the red pepper adds :) Oh, I did add a bit of black pepper and we ate them w/ ketchup. Baked at about 425 in my toaster oven since it generally gets hotter than my regular oven. Definately a keeper!!!

DELICIOUS! What a fast and easy side dish to make. The only change I make is I do not peel the potatoes as the skin really makes a big difference tastewise when it is left on. Sometimes I also sprinkle in some grated parmesan cheese. I cook them for 30 minutes, tossing them every 10. I make this at least once a week and will continue to do so. Yum!

Made these last night based on the reviews.  Instead of adding a large amount of spices I kept it to only the Rosemary and of course added lots of chopped garlic and olive oil salt and pepper.  I was making a roast so just added the sliced Yukon Gold's with skin on right onto the same baking dish as the roast and baked them at 375 for just over an hour.  Turned out very nice!  I put them back in after taking the roast out at 400 just to crisp them up.

These were great!!  Super easy and tasted good.  I would check the potatoes often as I used the times on the recipe and they were about 5-8 min overcooked.

Usually, when I make roasted potatoes, I do a similar process, but, only use Rosemary,salt and pepper. I do like a wide variety of spices, but, I think this was just too many varieties in one dish! Thanks anyway!

Didn't have a recipe for oven roasted potatoes, found this one, read reviews and decided to try it for my church ladies group.  Didn't use marjoram..turn out to be a HUGH SUCCESS!!  Several ladies asked for recipe.

This was good, but I felt it was a little overkill on all the spices it used--talk about pricey! I didn't add the dried parsley because I didn't have any. It smelled great baking too, and makes a LOT of potatoes, we'll be eating this all week!

I just took these out of the oven.  I try to always make a new recipe by the directions first. Although these are tasty, there are herbs that I don't care for here.  I will probably try these again with different herbs.  Also, I had a problem with them sticking a little. If I do make these again, I will use different herbs.  I also just mixed everything up in a resealable bag and let them marry for a little while.  I am serving these tonight with the Chicken Cordon Bleu II from this site. Also, a new recipe and will let you know about that one later. 
Thanks for the recipe.

This has become a staple recipe. So good. For three people we cut up 4 potatoes (on the small side). I no longer measure the spices, I just shake into the ziplock, and I leave in the oven for 15 minutes to get a good brown sear, and then I flip them over for another 15-20 minutes. Rave reviews from everyone.

Very Good! I used all of the spices. My husband really likes dill. I made these with a lamb roast for Easter and everyone loved it. You can cut back or cut out the red pepper if it tastes too hot.

Very good - next time i will leave out the red pepper - sneaky spice.  I might just add a pinch of black pepper and maybe add some celery salt.

I took a note from CHEFSINGLEDAD and passed on all the misc stuff.  This were crisp yet very tender. I was skeptical about the seasoning thinking that two much would stick to the potatoes, but w/ the evoo it was perfect.  Topped w/ sweet paprika and thyme right before baking.  My meal had a latin theme so they were a bit spicy, but not a bunch.  Only a bite or two left and I used 12 potatoes w/ skin.

Made a couple of times & it tasted the best when using my roaster. When baking the potatoes tasted blah, but using the roaster they were much better. Will only make if using my roaster. I roasted for 60 min & added marg to the pan.

This recipe was great for a weeknight side dish. I had two potatoes that I had planned to bake, but then saw this recipe, so I changed my mind. I was glad I did. My husband loved them and asked me to make them again.

This is the perfect side dish for those freezing, winter evenings when the snow is caked thick on the deck.  The potatoes smell delicious and taste absolutely wonderful!  I decreased the the thyme and omitted the red pepper.  I add a tad bit of seasoned salt at the end.

Wonderful--and I don't even like oven roasted potatoes!  You can change seasonings to your taste--but I loved them all!

My favorite way to make potatoes when I don't have time to bake them or I'm feeding a crowd.  If I don't feel like measuring everything, I'll throw in some of whatever spices will go with dinner, or just fresh rosemary.

This recipe is really good but alittle too spicy for me. Next time I will only use 1/4 of a tsp. of the spices. This recipe is a keeper!

There is no need to peel the potatoes if they're organic, just scrub and proceed with recipe.  The potatoes were cooked perfectly in 20 minutes.  I didn't need to adjust the recipe at all and my husband loved them!

Great recipe, I make it often.  I use all the spices and a little rosemary.  I think the mixture of spices make the potatoes taste great.  I don't understand why people change the recipe to have completely different spices (i understand changing some), if you do that, then it is no longer this recipe, one should then just create their own recipe for allrecipes.com.

These were very quick and super tasty.  I used half a Tablespoon of each of these fresh herbs from my garden:  garlic chives, basic, oregano, thyme and a clove of garlic and about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  These were even better the next day as leftovers!

These potatoes are awesome!  The only thing I would do differently next time is to leave out the red pepper flakes.  The red pepper definetly adds a little kick - which my husband loved, but I could do without.  Awesome!!!

Well, I'm giving this a four because I left out most of the spices. Just did minced garlic, dried minced onions, salt, pepper & a dash of rosemary. My hubby hates herbs...but we all enjoyed these potatoes. I followed other reviewers advice & put it all in a ziploc, let it sit for 10-15 min & baked. They were great! Thanks

I have made these potatoes several times.  I leave out the marjoram and red pepper because I don't normally have those on hand.  They come out very good.  The whole family likes them.

Very good alternative to the usual. I didn't have dill or marjoram, so I omitted both. I'll add more salt next time, too, but I'll definately make again.

I didn't add garlic (husband hates it) and roasted the potatoes probably around 40 min while cooking other things in the oven. Turned out really nicely. These can be modified to taste but the basic recipe is very good and can be served with a number of different types of cuisine. I agree with other reviewers that they also reheat well. Thank you.

I made these potatoes for Christmas dinner with my fanily...they were a hit!  Everyone loved them, and before long all 10 lbs. of potatoes were gone!  I will certainly make these again! (P.S. These are so easy to make, the "hardest" thing is peeling all the potatoes).  Enjoy!

Great, simple recipe!  I deleted the marjoram & dill simply because I was out and they still tasted great.  I also added to the cook time about 15min. so they were nicely golden.  A perfect crowd pleaser for potato fans!

Delicious!  It even smelled so good before I cooked it.  Very good.  My 11 months old son love it as well.  I might skip out on the pepper flakes next time for my baby's sake.

This was so quick and easy. Can use what ever herbs you have on hand. It was a bit spicy for me, so next time I will cut back on the red pepper. But my husband loved it.

Very easy, very good. Next time I will leave out the dill (son's request) and just put a dash of the red pepper flakes (husband's request). I thought they were fine.

WOW! This recipe is awesome, even without having all of the ingredients - I didn't have any marjoram. I've used the Lipton dry onion recipe from the back of their box and I thought that was great, but this was even better! I just made it and sampled a few pieces - I can't wait to call my husband to the dinner table! I will do this again and again, thank you.

My husband really loved these thus the 4, I would have given them a 3. They just weren't crisp enough for me on the outside, and even with all of the spices they seemed bland. If I were to do it again, I would probably not pre-heat the oven, use a little more oil, and add some more kosher salt, black pepper, and maybe even some rosemary.

Excellent!  Just made these tonight with Slow Cooker Pot Roast (from this site) and whole baby carrots.  In reading the reviews, everyone has a varying opinion on the amount of spice to use.  In my family's opinion, this recipe AS LISTED, is barely enough to even flavor the potatoes.  Like others, I too would say to use more or less spice depending on you!  Very good basic recipe -- have fun changing it up.   (P.S.  Also try using sweet potatoes.... SO SO good and better nutrition)

Very tastey!  The blend of spices is awesome, and my potatoes always come out looking so professional.  Everyone is always impressed.  I make extra batches of the spice blend and have it ready whenever I need it!  It's so easy.  I usually go easy on the red pepper flakes because not everyone likes their food spicy.

Delicious! They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right variety and amount of spices and seasonings. I recommend that you cut the potatoes into pieces instead of just putting a whole potato in the mixture.

Did not care for these too much. Too much going on with the spices. Just needed a recipe to use up some extra potatoes. Had to put a ton of ketchup on them for them to be edible.

These are really good but too strong on the spices.  Next time I would not add the red pepper flakes and might try just a few spices as mentioned in the other reviews.  Good, but have a glass of water handy!

These were YUMMY! I served them with the Salsa Chicken from this site. I loved the dill on these, and if I make them again, will probably increase that. Thanx for sharing this recipe! Good stuff :)

Excellent recipe. I usually make a double batch. The leftovers make great potato soup or hashed browns.

These are the best tasting potatoes I have made. Brilliant. Wouldn't change a thing. I think the spices do wonders and the high temperature of the oven crisps potatoes beautifully. I am certainly bored of the same garlic-rosemary ones. This recipe is the best. Thanks a lot.

This was tasty, easy and delicious when paired with grilled chicken breast & fresh steamed broccoli! I modified the recipe a bit: only used 1 tsp. garlic powder & 1 1/2 tsp. italian seasoning instead of the fresh garlic & all those herbs. Kept everything else the same. Great recipe, thanks from Seattle!

I was making for large group. Fixed potatoes, cooked them and put in refrigerator for next day warming. The next day, they had turned black and were not able to be served.

Another perfect recipe from allrecipes.com.  Simple, easy to prepare, and delicious.  I prefer a little more olive oil than called for in the recipe.  Too, I slice the potatoes instead dicing.  The red pepper flakes are a nice touch.

I used small red potatoes and prepared just like the recipe except I didn't have any dried deal weed. I thought the potatoes were really tasty but dry so I used a little butter. I will make these again.

These are SOOOOOO GOOD!  I didn't have all the ingredients so I just used basil, thyme, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. I also used nugget potatoes and baked them at 400 F.

I thought these potatoes tasted wonderful. They had such a nice flavor from all the different seasonings yet they didn't taste "herb-y" if you know what I mean. They went great with the "Rempel Family Meatloaf" recipe on here.

These were delicious! They are a perfect side dish for just about anything. I also added some frozen seasoning blend (diced onion, pepper, and celery) to the recipe which gave it extra flavor. My husband and I gobbled them up!

excellent! I used the small golden Dutch potatoes from trader joe's and it was sooo good! the consistency was perfect. I also used half an onion (sweet hawaiian from TJ's) and layed foil on the pan. I also lowered the temperature to 400. I will definitely make these again! thanks :)

Very nice, the high temp makes them nice and crispy.  I only selected the herbs that my family liked and added some extra garlic, they were a big hit.

Easy to make and a great recipe to experiment with.  I have made it exactly as written and I've changed the spices around depending on the rest of the meal.  They have always come out great and the versatility is a real bonus.

These were very good and I loved how easy they were to make. I had to double the recipe. Be careful about doubling the amount of oil, or the potatoes will be mushy. I also left out the red pepper flakes as my in laws are very sensitive to hot spices. The flavor still came through. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to cook my potatoes for much longer than the 20-30 minutes.....closer to 45min.  Eased up on the red pepper flakes because of the kids.  It was very yummy!

fantastic recipe! i omitted marjoram and dill weed since i didn't have them on hand, but it still turned out tasteful and crispy! it also has a beautiful presentation. I will omit the red pepper next time because it's too spicy for me. This is an excellent side dish. I ate it with baked parmesan salmon. Delicious! Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good -- I used butter instead of olive oil. A mistake in my opinion. I also used season salt for lack of red pepper flakes, and they were quite tasty!

Very good!  I added a little extra olive old and threw in some baby carrots.  I did have to cook them longer for a nice crusty edge on the potatoes.

So simple, how didn't I think of this?  Omitted red pepper out of personal preference, and used red creamer potatoes.  Fantastic

I'm surprised at the great reviews here.  I guess our taste buds were just a little off here or something.  The combination of herbs here came off tasting really weird.  I know it's not my spices...i order from a very good company.  Perhaps it was just the combination that didn't do it for us or something.  I'm not going to waste the numerous herbs and spices to try these again.  Sorry.

Easy, easy, easy!  
I was a little concerned about all those spices together but they worked well.  I substituted black pepper for the red pepper to cut back on the heat.  I also increased the oil to 1/4 cup.  (It didn't make the veggies too oily.)  
I made this with russet potatoes, yellow onion and baby carrots the first time:  YUMMY!  The second time I made it I added a yellow squash, and a zucchini to the mix.  Also YUMMY!  
Next to try would be celery and mushrooms.
I did turn down the oven to 400 because I was roasting it along with Mediterranean Lemon Chicken, also found on this site.  Just cut the potatoes a little smaller and they'll get done.  My hubby loved it!
I highly recommend this recipe.

When these were cooking it smelled like I was making greek food and I thought "oh, great...this isn't going to go with the turkey", but the potatoes were an even bigger hit than the turkey!  My husband doesn't like spicy foods at all, so I thought the red pepper flakes might not be a good addition, but I added them anyways and he (along with everyone else) absolutely loved them!

I think it's the garlic that makes these potatoes great.  Plus, they're a little spicy.

These are great. I have been looking for a recipe for roasted red potatoes for a long time. These came out crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and very flavorful.

Although I didn't have a few ingredients like the basil, marjoram or red pepper, I substitued it for Rosemary, garlic/garlic (from Tastefully simple), pepper and added canadian bacon on top, it was FANTASITC.  I will make again and again.  I gave some to the neighbors to try, they now have this recipe and they LOVE it too!

Yuck! Obviously it must just be me based on the other reviewers. I kept looking back at the recipe wondering if I had done something wrong, or omitted something by accident. I'll be sticking with my Lipton's potatoes for now.

I made these potatoes last night with Orange Roughy Italian Style also from this site, both were great. I added 1/4 cup of grated, dry romano cheese to my mixture.  I had a little problem with my potatoes sticking to the pan, but they tasted wonderful!

WHHHEEEWWWWEEEEEEE!  Those are some spicy potatoes!  And we like spicy!  A lot of water was taken at dinner tonight.  Dh and ds liked these potatoes.  None were left.    A little too spicy for the rest of us though.

Great recipe.  Try without red pepper flakes for a less spicy dish.

I tossed in whatever fresh vegetables I had in the refrigerator.  This was such a hit.  My husband and I are already talking of when I'll make it again.  Yum, yum.

I used garlic powder instead of the marjoram (didn't have any) & onion power instead of red pepper flakes. I've been making these for years! Let them cool a little after removing from the oven as they are very hot. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow these were good!  When I make them again, I might omit the red pepper flakes-- just depends on who I am making them for.  The adults loved the heat, but the kids didn't.  The blend of herbs is wonderful!! I took this to a Thanksgiving family dinner and was asked for the recipe several times!!
Thanks for a great new side dish!

I am a person that can only cook if I have a recipe and just to throw things together doesn't always taste good.  So glad that I came across this recipe, it tasted awesome (didn't have all the spices but it was great)!!!!  Definitely will be making again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Good mix of flavors, but my potatoes stuck to my glass roasting pan.  Next time I'll spritz with non-stick spray before adding the potatoes.

Incredible...I made a few modifications (no thyme or marjoram and a bit of cayenne in place of red pepper flakes), but they were a big hit!

I have to figure out which spices I like together, but it came out really good. I'm not used to all the flavor I guess. I'll definetly make again and try different combinations of spices to find which ones I like. Thanks Janet

These were pretty good.  Lots of garlic, but that's okay with us.  My husband did say, "They taste like they belong with breakfast."  But I think that's because they're cubed.  Next time I make them I'll try them sliced or in sticks.

WOW - these were so good.  My family loved the full flavor.  I also added a bit of rosemary (my 12 year old said he didn't like the "sticks")  But I love Rosemary!  This is certainly a keeper.

Very good, and flavorful! Make sure that you flip the potatoes while they are cooking so each side gets browned.

Awesome!!! I don't eat potatoes very often, but these were so good, I could not resist. I used rosemary in place of oregano and basil, only because I was all out! It is a perfect blend of spices!

Good, but had to cook about 15-20 minutes longer than called for. Varied the spices to suit my (and my families) tastes and it still turned out great.

This method of cooking potatos turned out great!  I have to admit that I didn't follow the directions as far as the spices I added. (I took another reviewer's advice and used a package of onion soup mix because I was in a hurry) I will try this again and follow the exact recipe since they were such a hit with both my husband and I.

Excellent mix of spices blended together. My two year old loved it, so did my husband. Will do it again, following it to the T. I used a potato peeler to peel my potatoes, so it wasn't much work!

Very good potatoes. Very tender on the inside, but not mushy on the outside. Herbs blend well together. Use the same cooking directions, but mix up the herbs used. (onion soup mix works great too) Great results every time!!!

loved it. added more spices than the recipe called for bc i dont think potatoes can have too much flavor. also spritzed butter spray at the end to brown and give it a buttery flavor.

I made this for the third time tonight, and I have to change my previous 4-star rating to a five-star rating.  These potatos are just so good, and all of the herbs are delicious.  I did add Rosemary, which made it taste even better!

Not sure about these potatoes.  I thought the spices were too overwhelming.  My hubby liked them though.  I think I will stick to simple pepper and rosemary.

I tried this recipe for the first time yesterday, and it was terrific, maybe the best potatoes I've ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I left the skins on the potatoes and roasted them in a pan with a duckling I was also cooking.  The pan drippings might have added a little extra flavor, but I'm sure that even without them, these potatoes would be first-rate.  And they're so easy to make--the same measurement for nearly all the spices--I love that!  I emailed this recipe to my boyfriend, who's out of town.  He really likes roasted potatoes, and he's going to love these.  Thanks, Janet!

I tried this for Easter Sunday and the family loved it! I used red potatoes and par boiled them first in their skins. Unfortunately I slightly overcooked them so they were a little dry. Will definately try them again. A nice healthy alternative to traditional roast potatoes.

Very Good!  I thought that the red pepper made the dish a little too spicy for me and 2 yr old sone (my husband thought it was perfect).  Next time I think I will lessen the amount of pepper or omit it all together.  I also reduced the amount of potatoes and added in some baby carrots so that I wouldn't have to prepare a separate vegetable.  Came out great.

This is a really cool recipe and I happened to have all the spices on hand! Needed a little more salt for my taste but overall, very good! Served this with my steak dinner!

This is a great recipe for a change of pace!  Spices go together nicely. If you don't like spicy omit red pepper.  Couldn't eat these every night but Great when in a mood for "seasoned" potatoes.

Hate to be the black sheep here, but I wasn't terribly impressed with this recipe. I love spice, but this was a bit overpowering and I'm not talking about the red pepper. Hubby thought it was pretty good though.

Wonderful!  I cooked until a little browned on the outside -- about 25-30 minutes.  They were perfect with out grilled cheeseburgers!  Thanks

I doubled the oil and herbs and added two bone-in chicken breasts and some baby carrots and made a delicious meal out of this recipe.  It was great!  I used baby red-skinned potatoes and did not peel them.  I also skipped the dill weed since I didn't have any on hand.  Very tasty!

We found these very good.  Not to be a master of the obvious but they taste strongly of the herbs and even a bit spicy (probably the red pepper flakes).

THIS IS A KEEPER!  I've made this twice - once as directed - excellent!  And once with just salt and pepper and seasonings of my choice - also excellent.  Making oven roasted potatoes can take a long time - but at 475 (I use 500) they are done in no time so this is a great recipe to use if you are doing grilling or something on top of the stove and don't want to wait 45 min. or more for potatoes.

These potatoes were great!  The only thing is, I did stir them frequently, but the continued to stick to the pan.  But they were a very tasty side dish!  Easy to make, too.

Awesome!  Lets just say, I wanted something to snack on, so I made these in a jiffy, forgot about them (they were in the oven for an hr) and they still tasted great.  I made two servings and I ate them all myself!  Anyhow, I used powdered garlic, vegetable oil, onion salt and left out the dill, red pepper flakes and parsley since those were what I had or didn't have on hand. I also left the skins on. I will definitely make this dish on New Years with the Rib Eye Roast I plan on making.  Thanks!

This was a nice spin on potatoes.  Tossed in some baby carrots, did them on the grill instead of in the oven, and added extra crushed red peppers for a nice zip.  Can't wait to try them with fresh herbs next time.
