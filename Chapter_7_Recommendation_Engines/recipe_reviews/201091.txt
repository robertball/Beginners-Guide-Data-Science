Made as directed, but added 1 cup of shredded cheese to the top and broiled it off towards the end. Next time, I might brown the hamburger lightly, omit the soup mix, add onion and garlic, and add 1 can of cream of "your choice" soup.

This is almost exactly like one of my very favourite childhood meals; the only difference is that we don't use a pie crust and top with mashed potatoes and cheese instead of hash brown potatoes.  It's warm and filling and nice and onion-y.  Definitely would recommend, either my family's way or the one listed here.

The idea it's self is what got me to try this.
Yes like the other's I added my favorite things mushrooms feta and onion garlic with a splash of fresh grated ginger.
But the idea with the frozen hash browns and the pre frozen pastry was great for me to use up the few hash brows and last pastry shell.
Thank you so much for your recipe

This was easy and tasty but it was not quick.  It took much longer than 40 minutes to cook.  I had to feed my kids something else because it wasn't ready in time.

Quick and good.  I would add more cheese and take it easy on the pickles.  I also added a little mustard in with the ketchup.

I made this because it was the night before grocery shopping and I had all the ingredients on hand. Defiantly use salt and pepper to taste. If you do not the end result will be very bland. I also recommend sprinkling with cheddar cheese the final 2 minutes of baking. I baked for 1 hour. Over all, this dish was okay.
