I did make changes. First I saut√©ed the onions in garlic butter along with portabella mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce. I could not find sweet onion soup so I just used beef broth along with the extra liquid from the onion/mushroom. I used a sweet red wine in place of the water.

Very easy, quick and good! Hardest part is slicing the onions.
