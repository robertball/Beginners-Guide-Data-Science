Have made this twice...once as a light dinner with a salad and the next time at Christmas brunch. It’s simply amazing.....and the leftovers are even better!

We loved it, it's in our rotation now.  I did use the riced vegetable mix so I had a little color from some peas which i have always enjoyed in risotto.

I didn't have a 16 oz frozen cauliflower rice but found a 12 oz bag in the store's fresh produce section so I went with that and cut the liquids back 25%.   The fresh riced cauliflower never really "absorbed" any liquid, I had to simmer 15 minutes and there was still chicken broth left.   I also didn't have an immersion blender so the final product was thinner than I wanted but WOW the flavor!   I would cut the liquid back another 15% if you don't blend.  We used the liquid as a steak sauce.   Great flavor!

Well, that didn't go as expected.  It was stringy and had a bitter taste from all the parmesean cheese, and there was a fair amount of "left over" cream in the bowl that was not absorbed.  IF I make it again, I would chop the mushrooms first and either use a different, creamier cheese or 1/2 the amount of parmesean.   My family ate it, but were not bowled over--even with bacon in it.   The sticky mess it made in my pan and on my dishes was not worth the results. :(

Great flavor. Didn’t get thick so I’ll reduce the amount of liquid next time.

Big thumbs up.  Everyone was so reluctant to eat it because of the cauliflower and they all were scraping their bowls.  Yummy.  I didn't have chicken broth and just used water.  I cooked it down for about 15 minutes instead of 5 per the instructions.  I used 6 slices of bacon.  The store didn't have a 16 oz bag so I used two 10oz; one was herb flavored and the other was garlic flavored.  This will be on a regular rotation!!  Way to go Dads That Cook.
