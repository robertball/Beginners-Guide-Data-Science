My husband and I really enjoyed this dish (and I almost followed the recipe - ha!)  The only real change I made was to leave out the bbq sauce and we each put our own on our plates.  The cilantro was a nice, fresh touch, also!  My legally-bound-by-marriage food guinea pig is sometimes skeptical about my food experiments, but this was met with hearty and resounding, "This is pretty good."  (And no sense of surprise in his voice.)  He mentioned that it might be fun to put the filling in tortillas or even pair it with eggs for a fun brunch dish.  I thought about adding mushrooms, but I forgot.  Oh dang.  Guess I'll just have to add them the next few times I make this :)  Thanks for a great recipe.  This one is actually going in the "make again" file, because 1.  It's easy.  2.  It's pretty tasty and 3.  Did I mention it's good AND easy?

I think I'll try it in a mini phyllo cup as an appetizer first.  I'll be back!

The 5 star rating is because my husband is raving about this one.  Our small town grocer did not have andouille sausage so I used hot Italian sausage (which is really more flavor than heat).  I "picked" the chicken meat off a rotisserie chicken the night before, so this was pretty easy to make if you're a quick chopper.  I did back the BBQ sauce down to just 2 cups (16 oz.).   Choose your BBQ sauce wisely as this will heavily impact flavor.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce which worked well.  I did forget to buy the fresh cilantro but it was still very good.  Served with plain mashed potatoes to balance the intense flavors of this dish.  We plan to serve leftovers as a filling in some Cuban bread brought by a friend from Florida who pays the "Cuban Bread Toll" when she visits.
UPDATE:  Have made this successfully several times to my family's delight.  However, the last time, it was not up to par.  Here's what went wrong as a cautionary tale:  I used boiled chicken rather than rotisserie chicken so the chicken sort of disintegrated.  Also purchased honey flavored Sweet Baby Rays by mistake instead of original Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce which made a surprisingly unhappy difference.

THIS DISH ROCKS!!  I didn't have  red  onion  so  I  used a yellow  and didn't  have  a  yellow bell so I  used  a orange and  I  used  chicken broth  in place of water. Otherwise all was the same  and  I'm  not lying....it  rocked! I  will make it  again and maybe  for  my  next  church  meal.

Loved it! I used some spicy breakfast sausage and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. This will absolutely be a regular in our home

I had some fun with this recipe. In the end the name "Angry bird" fit perfectly. I just used andouille chicken sausage. I only had green peppers so I chopped up 2. I added a handful of baby corn. For bbq sauce, I buy Outta the Park. So I used about 10oz of their hot & spicy. Then put all the pan over jasmine rice. it was hot and very tasty.

I've  made this recipe many times. First time I  made it  I  couldn't  find  Andoulli  sausage  so I  used  Chorizo  sausage  and  it  is  fantastic . I made it with  Andoulli  once and could not  compare to how great it is with  Chorizo.  I would recommend  Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ  sauce  with this recipe. Served it with rice and on hoagie  buns and either way it was great. Highly recommend  this recipe to anyone that likes a kick in your dinner.

Our book club hostess served this and all 10 of us loved it.  It was very tasty.  She had rolls and provolone cheese to make it a sandwich.  It was a huge hit!!!!

I just made this last night for my boyfriend and we loved it!  I used a honey barbeque sauce and we put the final product in a tortilla with some monty-Jack cheese.  So good!  I only used half an onion and only two whole peppers.  This is fantastic!  Next time we're gonna put it in a calzone!

Followed the recipe but added some baby corn as another poster suggested.  Yum!  However, it was REALLY spicy! Wow!  I think because of the Andouille sausage.  Next time I make this I will use a less spicy sausage and for me the recipe will get 5 stars!

Pretty good.  Not great and probably not something I'll make again.
