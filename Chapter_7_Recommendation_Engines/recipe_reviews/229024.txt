Great, large batch recipe for the end of summer tomatoes.  I did change up the order of operations a little by par boiling the tomatoes for 2 minutes, dipping them in ice water and sliding the skins off (long process for 25 lbs!.  Then I halved the tomatoes and threw them into the large cooking pot to simmer and start to break down.  I used my immersion blender after about 30 minutes of simmering, to break up leftover chunks.  I then took the tomatoes and put them through my food mill to strain the seeds.  The strained marinara was then seasoned with the spices etc and the onions.  It has been cooking down for about 2 hours and has probably another 3 hours to go before canning.  Thanks for a large batch recipe!

I read my "New" Allrecipes stir things up magazine yesterday and couldn't wait to try the Tomato Harvest Marinara Sauce! I had 25 pounds of fresh picked Plum Tomatoes and followed the recipe using the tip from Sara, to skin the tomatoes first. I cut up the tomatoes before adding and divided the tomatoes between 2 five quart stainless steel pots. I used a 1/2 pint jar of homemade tomato sauce instead of water in each pot. I used the spices called for but doubled the quantity. I put the first pot on with the spices to get it started while working on the second giving it time to simmer the flavors incase I needed to adjust the spices.  I used 2 3/4 pound sweet onions and 10 garlic cloves chopped fine, cooked as directed. I divided the onion and garlic evenly in each pot. It is now simmering on the stove until thick enough to can, which I don't think will take more than an hour because of the tomato sauce instead of water. Great Recipe, a lot of work, but of course worth every minute. Yield is definitely off, I am hoping to get 6-7 Quarts, no way this will make 10.
Love the New magazine....on to finding another recipe!

Nice recipe!!   But about the canning part; never boil the rubber rings.  Wash them well and pour previously boiled water over them just before you start to fill your sterile jars and lids. If you boil
the rubber seals they might/probably will crack and become useless to your canning efforts.

The taste was nice, but I am giving this 2 stars because the amount it yields is way off, unless the sauce is supposed to be super thin. And after checking other recipes, this one just doesn't add up. Tomato sauce will average about 6-7 lbs of tomatoes per quart. Anyway, nice sauce but it was a lot of work for a much smaller yield than I was expecting!

It is 
imperative to add the lemon juice to raise the acidity and you must can at proper time and temperatures to maintain safety.  Things can always seal but does not mean they are safe.  Please read safe canning guidelines before anymore attempts to can to keep you and those you are feeding your product to safe!

I just opened one of my jars of marinara (and I made three batches) to make a meat sauce and have to say I am badly disappointed. I'm sure the lemon is necessary, but is the amount necessaryt? its flavor is over powering and very bitter. The sauce looks great and even smells good, but the bitterness of the lemon ruins it for me. It also leaves a bitter taste in my mouth long after eating it. Now I have 15 jars of marinara I can't do anhything with. I've researched other recipes and none of them call for as much lemon juice for a quart jar as this one does. The most I've seen has been a teaspoon.

This came out well and was pretty straightforward. I used beefsteaka nd plum tomatoes (whatever the garden offered) and added a little wine and red pepper flakes, along with some fresh herbs from the garden - sage, basil, oregano and parsley. Next time, I would use more garlic.

Great base recipe. I used 12 pounds of tomatoes. I blanched the tomatoes before pureeing them. The sauce was thin at first but as it cooked down it thickened up. And yes it did take a long time to thicken. Worth it though. I skipped the canning because I don't know how to :/ Sad for me. After the sauce thickened I added extra spices and made a really nice spaghetti and meatball dinner.

I really like this recipe but I did make some changes. I blanched and skinned my tomatoes and used very ripe early girl and san marzano tomatoes. I cut them into and I had enough juice from them that I didn't add water. I also didn't saute my onions and garlic . I chopped them fine and put them in the tomatoes. I didn't have bay leaves so I used 2 T. Italian seasoning instead. Instead of the lemon juice I used citric acid that is used for canning tomatoes 1/2 tsp per Qt or if you use pints use 1/4 tsp.  Very happy with the results.

There was way too much water - it's not needed with the tomatoes. Also lot of unnecessary work with the food mill. Blanching and draining before cooking the tomatoes is a lot faster and less messy.

The BEST marinara sauce I've ever had! I used fresh basil and oregano, and lots of fresh garlic, and added more onions (almost double). I used three pots at once to SIGNIFICANTLY cut down on the reducing time, and combined at end to meld the three pots. 13 lbs of canner tomatos made about 4 quarts. We had some the same night we made it for dinner and my husband LOVED it. Total winner!

Definitely a labor of love it took a long time but it seems to be worth it. It made a really great base red sauce.

To clarify Sunny's comment, there are no separate rubber rings used in canning this sauce. Those are 'old school.' The rings referred to in Step 5 of the directions are screw-on metal rings (the outer rings that fit over the flat metal jar lid) standard with all two-part lids for Ball and Mason canning jars.

I have used this recipe for three years now, canning myself plume and San Moreno summer tomatoes.  I’ve learned to cut back on the lemon juice to control the acidity.  The amount of lemon juice called for overwhelms the favor of the recipe.  I use this sauce as the base for several different tomatoes soup recipes and for marinara sauce. Excellent flavor and consistency.

The sauce I had, after following every direction exactly as written, was tomato water with a slight taste.  I had to spend more than twice the time boiling it down to get any kind of texture and eventually had to add more spices and some crushed tomatoes.  It just wasn’t edible in its original form, even by my other two friends who will usually eat anything.  We tried and tried to figure out why our attempts had gone so wrong compared to those who love it but I have to believe many times people were fixing it to their own taste and then reviewing on the basis of their finished product.  Two comments about the canning process: it is no longer advised that you boil lid liners as the new materials don’t require warming prior to placing into the bath (in fact, Ball and other experts have said there is a potential to disrupt the seal from boiling them first) and I agree with so many of you that the lemon juice was a distracting additive, even as I put in less and less into the jars.  Tomatoes never need help as far as acidity, certainly not this type!  A shame because I WANTED to love a recipe that looked so simple-

I found this to be very simple but I didn't can it. As a single I find I waste tomato sauce that is canned.   After it cooled down I ladled it into small one serve baggies and froze what I need.  That way I can just take it out, thaw it in the microwave and put it with my fave pasta.  So in the time it takes to cook the pasta I have my meal.  I don't waste any sauce anymore!

I'm making it right now and also used peppers from my garden. Has anyone tried including mushrooms? I realize you can add those when you put meat or sausage in the finished sauce but wondered if it was ok to add now for flavor? I prob won't can it but give it to friends and neighbors to eat now

Hit the wrong key, wanted to say we really like this recipe and I will make it many more times. The amount is off ( made less than the 10 quarts) but the taste,  consistency is outstanding. When it came to putting in the lemon juice I was hesitant but followed the recipe. Slamming sauce.

I thought is was  a great recipe. However, like many others have stated, the yield is not nearly what is posted in the recipe if you let it cook down to a nice thick sauce. I cut back on the lemon juice as many others suggested. I also added some finely chopped green peppers that needed to be used. Overall, this turned out great! Time consuming...but very tasty!
