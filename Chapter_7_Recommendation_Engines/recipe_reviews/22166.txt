LOVE this recipe. It took a long time to prepare but was well worth it! GREAT dish for company. Served it with pickled red cabbage and pine nut couscous. Absolutely fabulous presentation - colorful and amazingly tasty (to an adult palette). Take the time to marinate this overnight. Didn't have any apricot brandy - next time will definitely add. I suggest doubling the amount of dried apricots - delicate flavor got a little lost. Crusted mixture on top is sooooo good - even our refined guests were grappling for their fair share.

Excellent! I allowed it to marinate overnight and the flavors mingled nicely. I also added some fresh rosemary which gave the dish further complexity.

Taste was good.  A little complicated to make.  The recipe called for apricot nectar but apricot brandy was mentioned.  I was not sure where to use the brandy.
