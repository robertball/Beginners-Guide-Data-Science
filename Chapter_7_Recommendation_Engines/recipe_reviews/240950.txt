I was very skeptical about this recipe and didn't want to waste 3 cucumbers so I scaled the recipe in half. This was definitely different but good too. I know the mint is traditional for this specific recipe but I didn't love that part. I'd probably use a different herb next time but that is just me. This turned out far better than I had anticipated and is one I'd definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Way too much salt.  Even rinsing it before cooking could not remove enough of the salt to make it edible.

I ve never made anything like this before so I follow the instructions exactly except I use fresh mint instead of dried. I think perhaps the directions are missing a step to rinse off all the salt from the cucumbers. It just said to drain off the water so that s what I did but 2 tablespoons of salt soaked into the cucumbers made it inedible. It was way too salty. I will try this recipe again and rinse all the salt off. Perhaps I m missing something?
