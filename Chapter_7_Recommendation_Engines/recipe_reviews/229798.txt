I tried this recipe with several substitutions of things I had on hand and it was wonderful!.  I baked the halved pears in water, drizzled with agave nectar(instead of honey).  When making the syrup, it was not thickening, so I used a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with a small amount of cold water to thicken it. Then I served the pears on nonfat plain Greek yogurt, drizzled with the syrup and sprinkled with some granola cereal (did not toast it). The syrup was not very sweet, but it made a perfect compliment to this dish.

I made it with honey and water.  I didn't have apple juice.  I also didn't make the syrup.  I just drizzled a little more honey on the whole thing.  I did use vanilla yogurt.  The granola got over toasted.  I may skip the toasting next time.  After all that it still tasted great!  The pears were hard before baking but soft and sweet after baking and adorning.  They tasted spiced even though there were not spices added at all.  Super yummy and felt like a treat without all the sugar.  A great healthy dessert.

Be careful when toasting the granola. I peeked at mine at 7 minutes, and about half was already burned. You might only need to toast it for about 5 minutes or so.

We boiled down our syrup to less than 1/4 cup, but it never really thickened. Perhaps we should have added cornstarch like another reviewer suggested, or else we should have skipped the "syrup" and just used honey like another reviewer did. My husband laughed that we were just pouring apple juice on everything. We weren't very impressed with this dish. No one wanted seconds even though we'd made extra. It just tasted like warm yogurt with pears. That's it. I would have enjoyed a plain bowl of yogurt with granola in it much more than this.

Easy and delish!  I didn't have apple juice, and used agave to bake, not honey.  Added a splash of vanilla and maple syrup to the reduction. Used soy vanilla yogurt to make this vegan. Highly recommend this recipe!

Excellent! We simplified by skipping the granola and instead sprinkling mint on top. Delicious!

I alter the recipe by skipping the apple juice (it doesn't need any extra sugar) and use plain yogurt to add a nice flavor contrast to the sweetness of the pears and honey (again no need for extra sugar in vanilla yogurt!)
