I compbined two recipes and came up with the best chicken breast recipe ever!  I followed the recipe to a tee, except for adding 1/4 tsp. horseradish and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  I thought the recipe would be too lemony, but it wasn't.  I ended up with the most moist, juicy, and tasty chicken breast I've ever made and it was so fat free.  Just don't overcook!  6 min. on one side and 8 on the other.  Tasted like really good steak!

I'm a firm believer in trying a recipe "as is" in order to rate it fairly. That being said; this is about a 4 1/2 star in my book. Now, being that I am an experimenter, here's how I made it into a 5 star (for me, anyways) the second time around: used fresh ginger (about a 2 inch piece, grated), added 3 cloves of garlic (minced or pressed), added two chopped green onions, added 1Tbsp. of brown sugar, and 2 tsp. red pepper flakes. Wow!!! Talk about some great Asian flair! DH loved this recipe! Wonderful with any cut of chicken, used leg quarters the second time around. Thanks, MelindaG for a keeper!

I originally found the flavor of the soy sauce to be overwhelming, so now I use 1/4 C. soy sauce and 3/4 C. lemon juice.  Delicious!

This chicken was FANTASTIC!! Super quick and easy to make but with a nice, distinct flavor. I only let marinate 30 mins and it was still moist and delicious...cant wait to try it again after marinating overnight

I baked the chicken at 350 for about 8 mins each side and it worked well.  Grilling would probably make it 5 star for me.

This is an excellent basic recipe. I didn't have the ginger, so I left it out. I added two tsp. of brown sugar, and, as someone else suggested, I added a dash or two of garlic powder. I also just cut the liquid ingredients in half, because I didn't need a full recipe. The marinade could be made with pineapple juice and then the brown sugar might not be needed. Would be excellent to brush on skewered vegetables.

This is a delicious recipe.  I think this recipe would work really great with grilled chicken wings.  I plan on making wings this way in about a week.

This was delicious! I, too, just left it in the marinade for half an hour, and it was great. This is definitely a keeper. It's quick, easy and tasty. Everyone liked this one.

This is quick, easy, and delicious.  My kids told me to make it again which I don't hear all that often.  I used 2 fresh lemons using a quick technique of rolling the lemons, cutting them in half and then using a fork and twisting so the juices come out easily.   I marinated it for 2 hours.

I've made this at least 10 times this summer - so easy and it tastes amazing! I tried it with lime juice instead of lemon but didn't like it nearly as much. Also did it on the Foreman grill but it wasn't nearly as good as on the charcoal grill. I marinate it for about 24 hours, and the flavors just pop in your mouth. Even my 19 month old loves it! Thanks!

This is the best marinade I have ever used for chicken. I have added garlic, simply because we like it and increased the ground ginger or used fresh, grated ginger if I have it. I have used it for drumsticks, wings and breasts. If I marinade breasts in the sauce, I add a bit of olive oil. My family and friends love it, I have given the recipe out over and over again. Thank you!

This is so easy, and has a wonderful flavor.  I'm making it tonight for the second time in a week.  This time I'm trying it with drumsticks.  This tastes like there was a lot more that went into the marinade than just 4 simple ingredients.  Very nice dish that is low in fat also.  I will be making this often.

This recipe certainly was easy, and lo-cal, which is what I was looking for. I did add 1 tsp. of minced garlic. It seemed to need it along with the soy/ginger combination. I marinated it a few hours, which made it flavorful and tender. So easy, inexpensive, and delicious!

I used someone else's suggestion of adding 1/4 tsp horseradish and 1/4 tsp of garlic powder (actually I used more...like 1/2 tsp) to what's already listed and OMG perfection! This was the BEST chicken I've ever had.

So Lemony! My new summer staple.  My son loves Rosemary, so i switches the ginger for Rosemary.  Fresh lemons give it such a great lingering tang. Thanks!

Absolutely loved this. I marinated the chicken overnight meaning to bbq it when home from work but my son put it in the oven uncovered for over an hour and it was golden brown, moist and yet still very flavorfull with some sauce remaining in the dish. I can't wait to make it again...and maybe I'll try bbq'ing it this time.

Pretty good chicken. I used about 1/4 cup soy sauce, a shake of garlic powder, a tablespoon of sesame oil, and grilled thighs and drumsticks. The fresh lemon (I have Meyers) was a nice change and good mix with the soy sauce. Thanks!

Since the breast halves were thick in places I pounded them in the thickest parts to make more uniform thickness; marinated about 3 hours.  Meat was tender and juicy and they cooked quickly on the grill.  Be sure not to overcook!  The soy and lemon made for an excellent taste and was not overpowering, but I did add a little olive oil.  Will certainly make again.  Plan to slice leftovers for a salad tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing.

I tweaked this recipe slightly.  I ran out of lemon juice, so I used 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup lime juice.  I left out the ginger and used bonesless skinless strips.  They were a hit!

We'd expected the lemon to be a bit overpowering; and it wasn't!  Really very nice; am actually trying it tonight on lamb; the chicken was tender; mosit; and flavourful; really can't go wrong with this.  If you don't like soy sauce as much as my hubby especially does; add a little brown sugar to cut the bite of the flavour; or use reduced-salt soy sauce rather than the regular stuff.  Try this if you've got extra lemons and don't know what to do with them all or are stuck for what new to try with your chicken!  Wonderful!

Umm I'm not quite sure what to rate this. I made two minor adjustments in adding 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper. But the amount of lemon juice and soy sauce was TOO much I think w/ or w/o me having added these ingredients. So IF I ever make this again I will cut both in half. I still can't shake the overwhelming taste out of my mouth! (Also I made this over the stove, not a grill)

Sorry!  Really disappointed because it sounded really good and easy!  But we all thought was a really bad chicken breast recipe!  Followed it exactly!  Won't try it again!

This recipe was a little too simple for my taste. I marinated it for 30 minutes but it was lacking something. The meat wasn't that presentable either-the soy sauce made it quite dark. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I am always trying to find new ways to cook healthy and this one is a keeper.  My husband, who is not a fan of plain  grilled chicken even loved this dish. This is not plain at all and the marinade is perfectly done.  I did make a little extra for basting because I love a lot of juice.  My daughter, who is a light eater, asked for 2nds!  I personally loved this dish and can eat it every week.  I made sure I basted the chicken a little bit more than probably required during cooking and it was so juice and flavorful.  I even put a little Dijon mustard on the table for dipping, which my husband loved!  Next time I make this dish I am going to make even move marinade and sauté some peppers and onions with it!  This is a great dish for the whole family to enjoy!! :)

Not bad, nothing special but was okay for a quick dinner.  I did add a little garlic powder & olive oil.  Grilled it on my Sanyo indoor grill...thanks to the COLD weather here in Michigan.

Just tried this as I needed a quick meal for my swimmer..I followed recipe using fresh chicken breasts, before putting in the oven (we were out of gas for BBQ) I mixed up some garlic salt, pepper, and a few other spices, rubbed in in placed a lemon slice on top and baked for 30 minutes.. came out perfect. My picky eater said it was the best and wants me to make it again..

I loved the flavor of this!  I cut the recipe in half because I was only cooking 2 pieces of chicken and used a little less soy sauce than it called for.  I also marinated it for 24 hours then grilled on the BBQ.

I have used a lot of different chicken marinades...and this one is one of the best I have had!  I only marinated for 3 hours.  It was really flavorful.  I can only imagine what it it would like if I had let it sit overnight.  This will be a staple in my recipe box!  Only change I made was to use fresh Ginger instead of ground.

This chicken was perfect. It was juicy, tender, and had awesome flavor. Just if you have your grill on medium high they will cook in 6 minutes. I almost burned them because I was going to wait about 7 minutes.

Didn't have enough lemon juice, so I did 1/2 lemon and 1/2 lime juice. I also added 1tsp of ground ginger to the marinade. Since I don't have a grill, I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours and broiled it for 7-9 minutes on each side (top rack of oven). The chicken is very juicy and flavorful but does have a lemon tang to it. Those not fond of sour foods might not care for this too much.  Next time I will be adding some brown sugar to sweeten it up a bit. I will be amking it again!

This was pretty good, turned out very tender & surprisingly juicy.  I did use half the amount of soy sauce & added a little brown sugar.  My husband who can not stand chicken let alone white meat chicken actually said it was yummy.  I give it 4 stars only because it still could've used a little less soy sauce but it was good, fast, tender & juicy.

Tasty, but definitely too salty for me. I used low-sodium soy sauce, and not the full amount at that.  I poured in several tablespoons of Mirin, a Japanese sweet rice cooking wine, to help counteract the salt and a little of the tartness of the lemon. (And I love lemon - I made lemony, garlic rice to serve with it.) I made those changes based on tasting the marinade before the chicken went in. Since I wasn't able to cook it the day I started it, it marinated about a day and a half, which blended the flavors quite nicely and also  helped reduce the saltiness. I'm also glad I used a bit of fresh ginger, rather than powdered; I almost always use a fresh ingredient or herb when I have it. The saltiness of the original recipe would rate it a 3. To those who would say you can't truthfully rate a recipe unless you make it exactly as written, I say if you taste a recipe going "wrong"as you prepare it, I believe in making slight modifications so you don't have to throw out and waste food. Otherwise, I agree; if you start making major changes before trying it, how can you accurately rate something? It's really a different recipe! Submit it to All Recipes as you prepared it!

I loved it and so did my hubby. He's not a big fan of salty things but loved it. I did add a few extras. I added teriyaki sauce and onion power, ground ginger, grated the garlic, added brown sugar and sesame oil with a splash of hot sauce. Then butterflied the chicken. Grilled for 10 mins. Came out wonderful

I am gluten intolerant so I substituted Braggs aminos for the soy sauce.  I also made a 1/2 recipe rather than a full one since I was only marinating 2 chicken breasts. The chicken was moist and had a nice flavor.  However, next time, I will probably use fresh ginger instead of ground ginger to allow the flavor of that spice to come through more clearly.

Easy, cheap and good.  Both my husband and i loved it.  We had it the first day next to rice.  The next day I used the leftovers and made a chicken sandwich for my husband and tossed the leftover chicken on some greens for me....it was an awesome salad.

I love this marinade as did the whole family!  I'm using it for the second time tonight.  It's perfect for when I'm not so sure what to make for dinner because I always have these ingredients on hand.  I like it just the way it is but tonight I"m going to try some of the other recommendations and add some brown sugar.  I also thought about pounding the chicken breasts before marinating them then bread hem with panko and pan fry for some fabulous chicken sandwiches

We prepared this recipe as specified. NO changes. The boneless chicken breast pieces were allowed to marinate in this sauce for three hours. The resulting grilled chicken breast was very flavorful, but somewhat salty. I intend to use this recipe again, but I will find a way to reduce the soy-based salt content. Maybe I will substitute orange juice. Maybe some white wine. Also may add some oil, since it turned out slightly dry towards the end. Overall, very tasty!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used only 1/4 cup of soy sauce instead of the 1/2 cup it calls for and it came out so good! My family LOVED it! I will definitely be making this again, thanks for sharing!

I prepared this recipe as written. I marinated chicken overnight and grilled on both sides approximately 8 minutes to ensure no pink. Taste was superb! All of the ingredients blend together greatly and do not overpower each other.

Not bad but not great. 1st grilling recipe of the season....the lemon was a bit much. With it being salty and slightly tart. I would have toned it down some more if I had realized it in the beginning but didn't. While my family said it was good, they didn't eat every much of it. This one is in the middle. If I can adjust it to our liking, I'll make again.

The marinade was excellent. I did however make a few changes/additions. I added 1 1/2 TBL brown sugar, couple shakes tabasco,   & couple green onions. I only marinated it for about an hour and it still turned out very good and flavorful. Next time I'd like to try an "all night marinade" for this recipe. Thanks Melinda for the recipe!

This is good if you like the flavor of soy sauce.  We ended up slathering it with guacamole since none of us cared for the recipe.

Very easy with tons of flavor.  Served with sweet potato fries and asparagus.  If salt is a problem for you use low sodium soy sauce.

Easy and everyone loved it.  I used a tsp of fresh ginger, marinated it for an hour and grilled it on a grill pan on the stove top. Yummy.

This was delicious!  Juicy and very tasty. I have a problem with dry chicken breasts but this was perfect. I just added fresh chopped garlic to the marinade. Baked it at 400 for 10 minutes per side because here in Maine everything is frozen so we can’t use the grill. Lovely. Thank you for posting

I would never make again. I went light on the low sodium soy sauce and madequate up the difference with lemon juice.   Extra ginger and pepper.   After 18 hours marinade, cooked on the grill, all you can taste is salt and soy sauce.  We couldn't get through it.  We love our soy sauce and salt.....but way to much.  Hade to make a different meal.

Super easy start - I actually did 1/3 c each of lemon juice, soy sauce and olive oil.  Added minced garlic, rather than ginger, just for my kids.  Will try ginger next time.  Marinated halved chicken breasts almost 2 hours, then grilled.  Great flavor!

Very good. I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts. Marinated it for about 4 hours. Would be good longer, too.

This has become a go to recipe for my boyfriend and I. We make it at least once a week. I often add some garlic, and whisk in a little olive oil, which helps it not so stick to the grill.  Definitely recommend trying this one.

Easy Grilled Lemon Chicken Haiku: "Very lemon-ey. An easy punch of citrus. Good over pasta." I don't know if I would've liked this chicken on its own as a stand-alone entree, but it DID greatly complement AR's "Spinach Toss Spaghetti w/ Tomatoes & Garlic."

I made this recipe exactly except that I halved it.  I don't know if you really would need ALL of that marinade if you were marinading it for hours since I flip the bag periodically and let the chicken get coated well.  The base of this marinade (soy sauce and lemon juice) tenderizes chicken unlike any other one I have found.  I sometimes marinade with garlic vs the ginger and it works just as well.  It was my first time using the ginger and it was awesome.  I used the George Foreman and they all came out perfectly cooked.  Light in calories but Heavy on flavor!

We loved this!!  We did make some small additions to the original recipe, though.  We added one large minced garlic clove and one tablespoon Mrs. Dash "table blend" seasoning to the marinade.  Even our kids loved it, and they're pretty picky.  Thanks!

I used to use Soy Sauce and wine to marinade in, but this turned out to make the chicken even more tender. The only thing I would change (if your diet will allow) is to baste the chicken with butter and keep the grill at about 300° F. Great recipe
