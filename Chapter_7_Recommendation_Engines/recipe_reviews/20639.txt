Everyone loves the punch my family usually serves for any kind of family get together, but for my wedding reception in June, I wanted something different.  I decided to use this recipe and was very glad that I did.  It was a huge hit.  Now whenever we have a family get together, everyone wants me to make this punch.  I recieved numerous emails from his family asking for the recipe.

Excellent punch!  The almond extract really makes it different and refreshing.  I added gingerale for fizz and pineapple sherbet and it only enhanced the punch.  Also, try spiking the punch with amaretto instead of adding the almond extract.  Delicious!

Wow!  I discovered this recipe about 2 years ago when looking for something new to make for a friend's bridal shower.  What a hit!  The mother of the bride asked for the recipe to make for the wedding.  The caterer loved it.
Now, I make it for all special occasions.  I have tweaked it and add either ginger ale or other lemon-lime soda to it.  Great fizz and wonderful taste!

This is more like orange pineapple juice than punch. Tasty, but the lemonade and almond extract flavors do not come through.

great punch...a little sweet but great with the food for the bridal shower! I used sliced strawberries and oranges and it was very pretty. I will make this again. Very pleased with the taste and look.

This is a great punch recipe! I made this for a large birthday party and had several people ask me what was in it and ask for the recipe.  It is a nice change from the same old punch that seems to be at every event I go to. Be sure not to forget the almond extract! It really adds another layer of flavor and gives this punch it's unique and yummy flavor!
