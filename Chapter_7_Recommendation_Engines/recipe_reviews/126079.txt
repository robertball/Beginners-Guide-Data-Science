I used regular vodka instead of vanilla flavored.  So not as sweet as other reviewers stated.  Big hit at my family reunion and barbecue.

It was a hit at our luau themed party over the weekend! When word hit that it was almost gone, there was a mad dash for it!  Just to warn you...the alcohol sneaks up on you on this one:)

This was a good start for my new years punch.  I added a bit more pineapple juice, peach schnapps, and the peach nectar as the vodka was a little strong for my taste.  I served it in a pretty glass urn with lots of peaches floating on top and it was gone by the end of the evening.

Very sweet, but the flavors blend very well together. It was a hit at the horse races this past weekend!

I made this for my memorial day barbeque and everyone loved it. As the previous reviewer said it does sneak up on you.

This is a really tasty and very sweet summer drink.  I love the flavors together.  The vanilla is a nice touch.  Next time I will blend it a la daiquiri to make it more refreshing.
