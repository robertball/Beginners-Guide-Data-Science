A little too greasy for us following the directions. I cut the oil/butter by half and tossed the croutons with the mixture with a light coating of season salt to make up for the taste difference. Instead of pan frying I baked them on a cookie sheet at 350 for about 15 minutes and thought they came out better the second time. Great for snacking and salads.

These are 10x better than anything you can buy at the store.  I usually tend to eat them before putting them on the salad.  They turned out great.  Can't wait to make again.  Thanks for the post.

So very superior to the purchased variety, that the modest investment in time is amply rewarded.

Really an easy exercise in cooking, and the result is absolutely delicious, in both taste & texture.

Throw the roasted garlic away? No way! Pop it in your mouth, or spread it on some toast.

Didn't add the "ghee" although I did think of adding regular butter, but they were very good without either. I used 2 tb of olive oil and .5 tb of rosemary infused olive oil. I then added dry Greek herb seasoning to the oil mixture. I tossed the bread(used a day-old baguette, no need for toasting) in and baked them on a cookie sheet at 350 for maybe 10 minutes.

I thought these were really good.  I think when you fry the bread in the oil/ghee mixture you need to have the temperature pretty high or the oil will just soak into the bread and make them too greasy.  I am making a Caesar salad from scratch so who wants to add store bought croutons when you go to all that trouble.  Thanks for this simple recipe.

This was my first attempt at making croutons and they were awesome! And so easy too. I'm going to try making a bigger batch next time so I can use them in salads throughout the week.

These turned out really good.  I had to add some garlic powder and salt when frying b/c the 5 cloves I used to make the garlic oil was not strong enough for our taste.  Next time I will use more than 5 cloves.  I also experimented with my 2nd batch and just added the oil and salt to the bread cubes and baked them that way without frying afterward.  These also turned out good but not quite as yummy as the fried ones.

Great croutons, are very munchable as a snack. I added savory, dried parsley and some dried chilies...not spicy but oh so yummy. The oil and butter together is the key, and I don't clarify the butter first or strain the garlic and spices out, or fry the bread...just sautee and brush on! Flip bread pieces once and brush again, it takes about 30 minutes at 300 degrees...I love these croutons!

Great recipe but I did change it up the second time…and I’ll never go back to the original. I used 1 stick of melted butter…to the butter I added a tbsp. olive oil and the garlic. Put all the cubed sourdough bread in a large mixing bowl and slowly pour the butter mixture over the bread, be sure to mix the bread while doing so to ensure all the bread is covered. Once it’s all covered, I lightly sprinkled McCormick’s California Style Garlic Salt & Garlic Pepper on the bread…only put as much as your personal preference. Lay the final product out on a cookie sheet, one layer thick and bake in the oven at 350 F for 20 minutes…broil them for an additional minute or so…only toasting them to your preference. YUM!

Great general recipe. I reduced the ghee amount by 1/2 as others did, and added a sprinkling of 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese prior to baking. Came out wonderfully crunchy and the kids were eating the croutons right out of the oven until I had to stop them!

made this "as is" and thought it was good but a tad too hard and dry. You really have to watch them as they can burn very easy on the bottoms when cooking them in the oil. used the same recipe with fresh french bread cut into 1 inch squares and did not dry them in the oven.  they came out not too crisp and just a bit chewy.

Excellent!  The key is the toasting.  Also, I did not squeeze the juice from the garlic as my husband doesn't do well with garlic.  You could still taste it but it wasn't overpowering.  Cooked the garlic only half the time because it got brown too fast.  Had to make more because we kept snacking on them!

These were good, but I found them too hard (texture-wise). I prefer my croutons to have a little give to them. Store-bought croutons have to be hard so they keep for a long time, but I find them more satisfying when they're not so hard. I would skip baking them first if I made them again.

These are pretty good, but I think that I need to go back to the croutons that are only toasted in the oven.  I have a tendency to turn my back on things on the stovetop and they subsequently burn, so not the best recipe for me.  I do much better with things I don't have to watch like a hawk, and I've had success with croutons that are baked.  However, I do like the idea.  I didn't do the garlic and oil thing bc I bought chive oil yesterday, so I used that instead.  The ones I didn't burn were pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  Made only half the recipe because I was using a mini baguette.  Instead of toasting in the oven, I toasted on the bbq while I did the chicken for the caesar salad.

I thought these were too greasy and too much work for the reward.  For now, we will keep buying croutons at the grocery store.

I think the trick to this recipe is baking the cubes before you fry them which most other recipes don't suggest. I had a little too much garlic oil so I won't make so much next time... Everyone loved the croutons.

Way, way, way too much oil/ butter.  I've been doing this for years just tossing the bread cubes in a couple of tbsb oil and using garlic powder then baking in the oven.  Not near as fattening and so good.

i used an 8 oz sourdough bagette for this.. used 3 large garlic cloves and 1/4 c of olive oil.. sauteed up the garlic and then mashed it into the oil.. didn't remove the chunks.. threw in the bread crumbs to soak up all the goodness.. then put it in a ziplock and added season salt, black pepper, and italian seasonings.. shook around.. baked at 350 for a lil over 20 mins.. it was so done at 19.. but it still came out good.. ty for something to start with as this is my first time making home made croutons

I simply browned them in the skillet with butter, olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, grated Parmesan cheese and salt after baking for 17 min.  They turned out great!
