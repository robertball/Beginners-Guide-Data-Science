Pretty simple recipe. I used brown rice, sea salt, and a bit of garlic powder for some flavor. Depending on what you plan to use for filling, I'd recommend seasoning up your crust with something that'll accent your filling. This was the first time I ever made a rice quiche crust and was skeptical but ended up pretty pleased.

I love the idea of a healthier and easier quiche crust. I used reg white rice. To get 1 cup I boiled 1 1/3 c water, added 2/3 c raw rice, reduced heat to low, covered and simmered for 25 minutes. Next time I will just use leftover rice. I did not use the butter but I did add some spices. I was worried the rice wouldn't form a crust without egg in it as others I have seen. It stayed together just fine. For the filling I beat together 4 eggs, 1/2 c milk, 1/4 tsp pepper, 2 c broccoli florets, and 1 c ham. I baked this at 375 for 20 mins. Then I added 1 c shredded cheddar, baked another 10 mins, and then broiled on high until golden. The crispy parts of the rice crust became very hard when reheated for leftovers (actually hurt my teeth) so I don't recommend making this with leftovers in mind. I made garlic parmesan toast as a side but I think a spinach salad would be great. I will definitely make this again for an easy clean out the fridge dinner.

I love how the quiche soaked into the rice. This is a fantastic and easy recipe, far simpler and cheaper than regular crusts.

Great idea! I cooked 2 cups of rice then mixed in 3 T of butter, added salt and pepper. It was a little sticky at first and wouldn't mash, so i used flour and pressed it out with my finger tips!

Wish I'd known about this before. I will never make pie crust again for a quiche. I used regular rice instead of instant because the nutritional value is much better. I've made it several times, and it works well with brown, jasmine, and basmati rice. I added some herbs to the rice instead of butter and salt. If you like a little spice, chili powder is great added to it.  I put a layer of shredded cheese in the bottom, and it kept the filling from soaking into the rice.  The first time I made it, the rice sticking up past the filling got a little crisp during baking. It depends on how high your filling is on the sides. The problem was easily solved with some aluminum foil.

Great idea!  I did change this up a bit. Used jasmine rice made in a rice cooker with just a little salt and pepper. I had some trouble mashing down the rice-it kept sticking to he spoon- so I started dipping the spoon in water every once in a while-then resorted to clean, wet finger. That worked he best.  Might not have had the problem if I followed the directions. It did turn out really well, though!  I just added my usual quiche ingrediNts. Today it was  eggs, leftover ham, onion, bell pepper, spinach, and cherry tomato sliced in half. The eggs soaked into the rice and cooked nicely. Everyone loved the texture.  Will definitely be using this method of making a quiche from now on!  Thank again!

I only have long grain rice which I made as I normally do using chicken broth, butter and salt.  I made a one portion serving of ham and veggie quiche in a Pyrex 1 cup bowl using the amount of rice needed to make the crust in that bowl.  I liked the rice crust for this, it almost made it like baked (fried) rice.  Thanks!
