This made GREAT turnovers!  I followed the recipe exactly as directed, EXCEPT, I had no butter on hand, so I used a stick and a half of margarine instead.  It is a sticky dough when you remove it from the fridge.  To remedy this, only roll half the dough at a time, and use a medium-heavily floured surface to roll it out, keep your rolling pin floured well also.  If it doesn't work out well on the first roll, knead the extra flour in that stuck to it, then try again, it will be easy to work with then.I made small turnovers, about 4" across when unfolded.  They baked nicely at 350º for 23-25 minutes.

I live in Lafayette, LA.  I've had sweet dough pies all of my life, and love them.  For those who are expecting a flaky crust, this is not the recipe for that.  Sweet dough isn't supposed to be flaky.  If it were, this recipe wouldn't be called Cajun Sweet Dough...it would be called Turnovers.  This is a very authentic recipe.  Absolutely wonderful!!  Thanks for sharing! :)

This crust is not flaky, so if your looking for fluffy turnovers dont use this. The crust is real tasty.

This crust was almost like a sugar cookie, sweeter than I expected.  It was very tasty though and worked really well as apple turnovers because it held its shape very well and didn't have a bunch of filling leaking out. Refridgeration is a must though, because the dough is very soft.

OH MY GOD!! IT'S WONDERFUL!! THE PERFECT DOUGH FOR TURNOVER and maybe also for cookies! so crispy but also tender inside, you don't feel butter at all, very tasty and perfect! I follow the recipes exactly and they come out perfect! I fill them with apple briefly cooked with cherry jam, nuts, brown sugar and marsala, but you can fill it with everything you want, such as chocolate and nuts, figs, custard and so on..I will definetly use it again and again!

Wonderful results! Thanks so much, I have put it into my special recipe book "for good". My cousin's gift of Gravenstiens from her tree became delicious cinnamon scented apple filling. For the dough I reduced the sugar to 1c. (no problem), other than that, just as written. It was firm enough, not sticky when done, then chilled it 3 hrs. Let it warm up for 1/2 hr. before forming the hand pies and "pop tarts" (used a simple Wilton tart former). Not mentioned here is to pierce the tops to vent steam if you're making hand pies, prick with a fork if making smaller turnovers. I finished them with an egg wash and sugar sprinkled on top. Delightfully tender and soft but held their shape well, not crumbly, even my picky 7yo loved them.

OUTSTANDING!  Native Louisianian,and I love this.  Tastes like a mild sugar cookie.  We made tiny pies using the top of a large glass to cut circles, 1tsp. fig jam for the filling, fork crimped the edges and sprinkled with sparkling sugar after egg white brush.  Y-U-M!

This dough is awesome...! It's a little hard to work with, so don't try to compare it to others, but it's worth the extra effort. I made tarts, mini pies and turnovers using this dough and they all turned out great! Dough is forgiving on cooking time thank goodness. I filled with berries, pumpkin, mincemeat, lemon and even chocolate. All fillings worked...! I fridged my dough overnight then let in sit out for about an hour before rolling.

Really yummy!  Added a bit of pumpkin spice and filled with pumpkin pie filling.  Cinnamon and sugar sprinkled lightly over the finished product made it extra sweet and delicious!

Great snack to get in the Thanksgiving spirit! =)

I love this recipe, so sweet and soft. Fluffs up nicely and I put any thing in it and taste great. Just followed the direction of putting together. I just 350 and check for browning. After that, all is great.

I was pretty disapointed with this recipe. The other review was right, it is more like a cookie. I was also frustrated trying to figure out how long and how high to bake it. I am not an expert baker so I had to guess. Maybe I need to roll the dough out thinner. I also found it difficult to roll- it was very sticky even after chilling for a long time.

I liked this recipe as a cookie but for a turnover, I don't know, I find it a bit sweet. This could have been my filling choice, though. I'll make it again as tea cookies but not for turnovers.

For most of my life I disliked pie crust. Dry, somewhat tasteless...a sad ending to a piece of pie. Then I tried Julie's recipe. It's amazing!! I use it for anything pie, anything turnover. You can't go wrong! Everyone is wowed by it..even my Mom who was happy with her crust. It's little like sugar cookies. Thank you for sharing it! :D

It tastes good. I read the reviews so I realized the crust would not be like a pie crust. I followed the recipe with the exception of I baked longer to get golden tops. They were great that night. But those I stored in closed Tupperware were soggy the next day. Like wet bread. They were completely cool before I closed them up. Any tips on storage to prevent the soggy-ness?

This is a great sweet dough recipe. I used it several times. I am giving it four stars because it always comes out different each time. I am not sure if it's the humidity or the time I beat the dough.

My dad requested cherry turnovers for breakfast so I decided to try this recipe. I was in a hurry to make it and completely messed up the instructions. Instead of creaming the butter and sugar in a separate bowl, I accidentally mixed everything together. This resulted in very crumbly dough, but I was able to salvage it through the addition of extra milk. I filled the dough with cherry pie filling and then drizzled a simple glaze over it after baking. My dad said that he didn't like the taste of this recipe at all, but most everyone else thought that it was good. I would probably not make this again as I don't feel that it is worth the effort. Thanks for sharing.

I can't rate this because I haven't tried this yet - but for anyone that has not tried sweet dough - this is wonderful (do not confuse this with sweet breads). The dough has a wonderful sweet flavor to it. I've never had it with fig - though I remember my grandma's fig preserves...soooooooooo good! My grandma used this as a pie crust and baked it - then filled it with a rich chocolate custard filling. I'm glad I saw this recipe. It brought back so many memories of my childhood.

It taste pretty good but The amount of time it takes to prepare and the amount of time it takes to chill prior to rolling, cutting, filling, folding, and baking isn’t really worth it.

It's a very good recipe. It does taste like a cookie. It also doesn't create 30 pieces if you're really using 3 inch square. I found it very difficult to get to that number. However it tastes good. I would agree with the people who said that you have to use a lot of flour when you're working with it. Also make sure you put the turnovers on the very top rack. Mine burned because I went to the middle rack.

I use this recipe all the time. Makes a great pie crust. Portions are large. Yummy taste, not too sweet. Two thumbs up.

Great recipe. I added a bit more milk. Dough needed to be worked with a bit of flour after refrigeration. As mentioned by others it's not a flaky dough. I left my dough thick to create a  sweet shortbread like topping  over a caramel apple cobbler. 
Everyone loved it. I will use this recipe again.

The recipe is very good. I made cherry turnovers with this recipe and shared with a neighbor to test. She willingly sacrificed herself to test any other recipes!
