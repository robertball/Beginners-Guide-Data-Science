This recipe turned out well. I only used 15 cookies instead of the entire package. I put a 1/2 cup of the cookie crumbs in the pudding when I added the cool whip and the rest I sprinkled on top of the cups and then added the gummy worms. I used a food processor to crush up the cookies.

This was quick and good. I had a 5.5oz box of instant vanilla pudding so I used that with 3 cups milk (followed the boxes instructions) and then used about 1/2 C crushed cookies in the pudding and about 3/4C crushed on top. It was definitely less than a whole box of cookies and maybe still too much.  I'm not sure if it was the extra cup of milk or the fact it didn't have other ingredients like cream cheese in it but my pudding didn't really "set" very well. This was fine though since it was just for the kids and they didn't notice. Maybe next time I'll try with the 2 cups milk and still less cookie crumbs.  Thanks for the quick, easy and tasty recipe!

I made this for a Halloween party and added Rounded cookies for tombstones. I added just over a bag of Oreos because I chopped most of them too finely with a food processor. Once I chucked them up a bit more it went much further. I put them in cupcake wrappers and then realized they’ll probably get soggy, but I’m hoping for the best.

I doubled the recipe and made for a neighbors party. I arranged in a trifle dish and had a nice amount left over for a medium bowl to keep at home. I took the trifle dish home EMPTY!! It was delish!!

It was very good although next time maybe I will use a little less frozen whipped cream and use a little more crunched cookies. I used Oreos and used a butter knife to take out the filling so I just got the cookie. Also using Oreos you can experiment with different flavors. If you don’t have gummy worms you can use 2 flavored gummy lifesavers and break them in half so they look like gummy worms. Overall , it was very good but could use a little less whipped cream.
