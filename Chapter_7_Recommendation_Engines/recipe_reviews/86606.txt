This is was a great jumping off point for me.  I would have never thought to use bleu cheese.  However, since you got my creative juices flowing I added 2 chopped apples with skin on, 1 cup crushed walnuts and 1 3/4 cup plump craisins and fresh cracked pepper.  It was yummy!  It was a huge hit at a recent pot luck and everyone was asking for the recipe.  Definitely make it again!

I didn't change anything - Normally I make coleslaw a day or two in advance but I wouldn't suggest that for this one unless you are looking for a VERY strong blue cheese taste. It was great a few hours after making it - the next day it was strong (ok for me but maybe not for others!).  Thanks submitter!

I felt this coleslaw was a bit overpowering with the bleu cheese. The longer it sat the stronger it got too.

This is a very tasty slaw but you really need to like bleu cheese to enjoy it.  I followed the recipe as written but went a little heavy on the cheese since I really like it.  I don't think the sour cream adds much to the flavor, in fact I think it reduces the tang of the bleu cheese. Next time I will cut back or eliminate that ingredient.

This was pretty tasty, but i was hoping for something more similar to the slaw served at J.Alexanders. This is good base, but I will keep trying!UPDATE: I think it would make a difference if you use a highquality blue cheese... all my store had was Treasure Cave, which is mild. Also, next day my cole slaw was not at all runny, I think the key is really draining it well of the cider mixture.

Halved the recipe, and it turned out pretty well. I was a little concerned that since the mayo, sour cream, and blue cheese were equal quantities, the blue cheese might dominate the flavor, but it doesn't.  You certainly can taste it, but all flavors complement each other well.  Nice change from the basic mayonnaise-based slaw.

Followed the directions with the exception of the onion.  I let this sit overnight to gain the full flavor.  Excellent!

This was awesome.  I decreased the amount of the vinegar mixture and added extra blue cheese and some seasonings. Other than that, I followed the instructions and it was a total hit; twice!! Will make again and again.

WOW!  I've never had a better coleslaw in my life!  I added a few more bleu cheese crumbles since I'm a bleu cheese fanatic.  This recipe will be made all throughout the summer.  It was a hit at our company picnic!

Delicious salad!  I stayed pretty much to the recipe although I reduced the sour cream to about 1/4 cup as others had suggested.  I also added 1/2 chopped apple (I used Honeycrisp) and about 1/3 cup roasted salted sunflower seeds.  Everybody loved this salad and it's a recipe thats a keeper!

I really enjoyed this coleslaw.  I think it tasted better after it sat in the refrigerator overnight.  The sauce absorbed into the coleslaw more.

This really didn't go over well. It was disappointing because we like Blue cheese. My husband said his taste buds were confused.

Used way less vinegar and sour cream, added lemon juice and green onion.  Suppose you could say that I combined recipes from this site... :)  LOVED IT!!!!, will definitely make again. Honestly, the best "doctored" cole slaw I've ever eaten.

I love bleu cheese, but this wasn't a crowd pleaser for us. I would consider using it as a slaw on a burger, but not again as a salad.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and we loved it!! I made it and the Restaurant Style Coleslaw from this site and I couldn't decide which was better. They are both awesome, but the blue cheese is especially good for a change of pace!

I served this with buffalo chicken sandwiches.  We actually ended up putting the slaw on the sandwich as it just helped to round out the sandwich.

Oh my lord this was amazing. And a surprise to the palate of our guests. Expecting a normal coleslaw and hit with the blue cheese! Fantastic. 

Tip: If you don't like your coleslaw runny (it's pretty runny) add more coleslaw mix. For us it was perfect!

This was great! I used double the bleu cheese but kept everything else the same. Served it with Best Beef Dip Ever found on this website.

I made this recipe as written, scaled down for 4 servings. My husband and I liked it a lot as it is, but didn't get as much of a bleu cheese kick as we both desired. Next time I will let it marinate longer and possibly reduce the mayonaise and sour cream. It's really good as it is though! We'll definitely keep it in the book for future yumminess!

I had my heart set on a good blue cheese cole slaw like a nearby restaurant serves.  This hit the spot - sort of.  It's not as creamy as I like and I think there's too much vinegar.  Tasted good the first night, but after a night in the fridge it was swimming in an inch of dressing at the bottom of the bowl.

This recipe was the hit of the party I took it to. I tripled the recipe, and the only thing I would do differently is make the mix on the side and add it sparingly. I had too much of the liquid and had to keep pouring it out as the coleslaw got eaten. This a a great one!

Really good. The only thing I did differently was to use regular onions. It definitely benefits from sitting in the fridge overnight. Thanks!

This is delicious.   It is way too much dressing for 16oz of cabbage though.  I shredded an entire cabbage and there was plenty to cover.  I took this to a dinner party last nite and one guest said "this is amazing cole slaw".   If you like cole slaw and blue cheese, you'll like it!

I followed the recipe exactly and I found that there was too much dressing and salt for my tastes. Next time I make this I will cut back on the mayo and salt. The slaw is definitely edible (the flavors meld really well). Just my personal taste, but it was a bit saucy. I WILL make this again!
