OH MY GOODNESS!!!  This dressing really is that yummy!  I always get rave reviews when I make it, and everyone asks for the recipe.  My husbands eyes light up when I tell him that we are having out Southwest Chicken salad for dinner with this dressing.  It is way better than anything you can buy in the store.  We do add a little less honey like others have stated.  You can add a little more lime if you want it to be a little more tangy, or a little more vinegar for more of a vinegarette flavor.  One time I put about 4x the vinegar (on accident) and it still tasted great.    We just put the whole thing in our Vita-mix blender in the order it is written and blend it up - it turns out great that way, and you don't have to chop everything.    For our Southwest salad we do 1-2 heads of lettuce, 2 cobs of raw white corn kernels, 1 large can of black beans rinsed, 1 bag of Montery Jack cheese, 1 red onion, grilled chicken breast, and 1 bunch of cilantro.  We have also added tomatoes and avocado if you like them.    Thank you to the poster of this recipe, you did a great job!

This is delicious. I almost didn't review this because I had to leave out the ginger. Ginger has a strong distinct flavor so I feel a little strange about reviewing with such a big change. My husband hates ginger.  I decided to go ahead and review though because it is so good even with out the ginger. I am not  big on sweet dressings so I cut down on the honey a bit just do to personal preference. I have not been able to stop thinking about it. Wonderful flavor!
(update 6-2011) I just finally made this with the ginger and it is even better! Unless you have a ginger hater, put it in!

Followed the recipe exactly - was a huge success!

I marinated chicken with cilantro, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and garlic prior to grilling.  Served chicken over a bead of salad greens.  Drizzled the dressing over everything - was a huge success!  Will definitely make again.

Four stars only because there are some necessary changes. As suggested by several reviewers, I switched the quantities of lime juice and honey so that there was a total of a scant 1/4 c. honey and just over 1/3 c. (three fresh limes' worth) of lime juice. I also added TWO bunches of cilantro. I have never had the original restaurant version that this recipe is attempting to duplicate, but I would argue that it is still just a tad on the sweet side. I think I'll try only 2T of honey next time I make it, but I WILL be making it again as it's really good. It is also really great mixed with a little ranch dressing for a cooler, more soothing dressing if some don't like the peppiness of this one.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very good
as written, but it was a little too sweet for my taste.
Made it again and changed the honey to a 1/4 cup,
the lime to a 1/3 cup, left the rest as written, and it
was perfect, to me. This has a very unique taste,
and is so much better than anything you can buy in
the store. Five stars and highly recommended!

AWESOME!! made this dressing and mixed it into a huge bowl of romaine, black beans, monterey jack cheese, avacado, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, and sliced chicken breast for a party and it was a big hit! Everyone loved it. I will definitely make again.

I had trouble deciding whether to rate this 4 or 5 stars because I had to change it slightly, but in the end it came out great! 

Most crucial change: it NEEDS a generous pinch of salt to bring all of the flavors together.

Also, I ended up doubling the recipe, but I just doubled the lime juice and other ingredients without needing to double the olive oil or cilantro (I ran out)--just added an extra little bit of each.  Good to keep in mind for those of you looking to lower the fat content or if you don't have enough cilantro.  It's still great!

Other changes: I used sugar instead of honey because I didn't feel like using up my honey supply.  This worked very well.  I didn't measure the sugar but just added  more until it tasted right.  And I don't have a food processor, so I chopped everything as finely as I could and shook it up in a jar.

Delicious!  If the cilantro chopping didn't take a year, I'd make it all the time!

I really liked this. Definitely do NOT leave out the ginger. I was skeptical so I added it last. I couldn't detect it, but it made all the difference. I prepared the recipe exactly to start with. This was also too sweet for me; I will start with a couple Tb. next time. I haven't had Friday's dressing, but with about a 1/2 tsp. of sesame oil, it tasted like my local J. Alexander's dressing...yum! I also preferred this with double the cilantro...can't get enough cilantro! Thanks for sharing this!

Delicous!! I am an avid Cooks Illustrated fan, they wrote recently about the flavor packed in the stems of cilantro - I used the whole stem and leaves(big time saver) Just perfect. Unlike parsely, cilantro stems are not bitter.

I always end up having cilantro go bad in the fridge after using half of it for another recipe.  I have now found a use for the leftovers.  This dressing was perfect.  I love anything with lime so I doubled the lime juice and reduced the honey.  The cilantro was not overwhelming at all.  I served it on a salad of romaine, stir-fried chicken marinated in lime juice and soy sauce, sauteed mushrooms, avocado, green onion, almonds and cheese.  My husband raved over it.

I was actually looking for a good cilantro lime marinade for chicken when I found this.  With very little tweaking, this makes an excellent, perhaps the best cilantro lime marinade recipes I've ever tried. I think the ginger makes the difference. For two chicken breasts, I tripled the garlic and halved the vinegar and olive oil. Followed everything else exactly.  Marinated them for about 1-1/2 hours, then grilled stove top.    
Served with avocado mango salsa & lime jasmine rice from the spicy coconut shrimp recipe from allrecipes.com. Easy, delicious & fresh! 
Tip for grilling chicken:  start at medium-high heat, sear chicken for three minutes each side, then turn down heat to medium low. Don't exceed 7 mins. total per side for thick breasts, 5 minutes for thin ones, & always allow to rest covered with foil for ten minutes before slicing. Chicken continues to cook while resting without drying out! No need to make multiple cuts into the breast to check done-ness, which besides ruining the appearance, releases all the juices and results in dried out chicken.

we LOVED this dressing.  I served it as a side with carne asada tacos.  I made it as written, but probably added a bit more cilantro.  We served over romaine lettuce with queso fresco crumbles and homemade fried tortilla strips.  It may look like dark green pea soup, but it was excellent! Update, this is also great as a marinade for chicken!

I was looking for something 'vegetable' to go with our Mexican meal and this was AMAZING. What a perfect dressing...I can't get enough. Mixed with salad greens, avocado, black olives, crunched tortilla chips, frozen corn soaked in water to thaw and a bit of Monterrey jack cheese. Would be good with chicken on top, but I don't eat meat. This is my new favorite salad, and cilantro is SO good for you.

FABULOUS!  This is just like the J. Alexanders dressing they serve on their Thai Kai Grilled Chicken Salad!  YUM!  I substituted 3 Tbsp. Blue Agave instead of 1/3 cup honey and kept the 1/4 cup (on the full side of 1/4 cup) lime juice and 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar.  I also cut the olive oil to 1/3 cup just to cut some calories.  Did everything else just as written and it was awesome!  Serve on a salad of romaine, head lettuce, green and red cabbage --- all chopped fine, red pepper finely chopped and grated carrots---green onion if you like.  Throw on a few store-bought tortilla strips and some grilled chicken and you will have the best and healthiest salad ever!

Delicious!  Great blend of flavors. I used double the amt. of cilantro because I had so much and we love it. I may make it with less honey next time just to try a less sweeter version.  I even planted some cilantro plants so I can make this all the time.  My new standby recipe!

if you love lime and cilantro - this is IT. Yum, yum, yum!  My mods were no jalapeno, only because I didn't have it. 1 heaping tsp. minced garlic, 2 tsp. minced ginger, 1/2 cup lime juice, keep honey ration the same. 1/3 cup packed cilantro. Result = perfect amount of sweet to citrus balance while not over powering the cilantro.

I have searched and searched for a good salad dressing recipe and have finally found it!  I absolutely love that it's shelf stable and not made with mayo or yogurt.  I will make time and time again.  Love it! LOVE it! LOVE IT!!

The hubby doesn't like cilantro - at all - and I didn't tell him it was one of the ingredients listed.  He loved it! I've made this using the Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken and the Chili Lime Chicken Kabobs both from AR and equally as good served in a salad with this dressing.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the submission Lin!

Great dressing!  I have been looking for a dressing like this for a while, and finally found a good one.  Based on other reviews, I only added 2 t. of honey.  I didn't have a fresh jalapeno, nor fresh ginger root, so I substituted jarred pickled jalapenos and about 1/4 t. of ginger (dried spice) and it worked just fine.

I made this dressing following the suggestion of others to decrease the honey slightly and increase the lime juice slightly (basically rswapping the measurements for the two). I also used ground ginger instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand, and culantro instead of cilantro because that's what's growing in my herb garden.  I put it on a Mexicali salad sprinkled with crushed blue corn tortilla chips.  Delicious!  After my husband finished his salad he continued dipping the tortilla chips in the dressing.  He wants to use this on Mahi Mahi next.  Definitely will keep this recipe in my frequent use pile.  Thanks for posting!

Good as is but too sweet for our tastes; a bit more bite and it would be wonderful.  Next time we will add less honey and more lime juice/vinegar.

Oh. My. God. This is soo good. I did everything according to the directions except I used half of the jalapeno, and reduced the EVOO to 1/3 cup. I made this as a marinade for chicken, but it tasted soo good just after I dipped my finger in to try it out! I definitely will make this again! (Oh! And I used 1 whole bunch of cilantro -- which I think is about 1/4 cup packed anyways!) Yum-o!

This was way too much honey for me. Next time I'll only use a spoonful. The flavors were great though--salty, sweet, sour, and spicy!

This really is amazing dressing.  The cilantro is not overwhelming; in fact, it doesn't even seem that prominent a flavor (but I love cilantro, so the more the better for me).  I think I accidentally added slightly more sweetener than called for, so I added more lime juice to cut it down.  I did use agave syrup because my honey was crystalized.  This is fantastic dressing; a nice change from my usually vinagrette.  I will make again for sure!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was perfect. Very flavorful with a sweet and spicy hint. I didnt need to change anything with the dressing. I poured it over a fajita style salad. Def. was a big hit!

Excellent recipe.  To the person who indicates that it doesn't keep and that it was sour, I would disagree.  It keeps just fine.  The jalapenos I used were not 'zingy' enough, so I added approximately half of a small habanero.  I also added approximately just a little more than 1/4 cup of kumquats (quartered and seeded.)  I used blood orange infused olive oil and only half the amount it called for.  I would add less honey next time I make it.  I did a taste test with colleagues and all agreed that it was something they would eat/use, especiall over fish, pork, steak even.  I highly recommend this one and don't be afraid to add your own touch! =)

This is delicious! I only used 1/4 cup of honey, and upped the lime juice (not sure how much I actually used, I started with 1/3 cup, and continued to add until it tasted right to me). I served this over a green salad with tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and carrots, sauteed chicken breast and a mix of black beans and corn. Delicious!

This dressing was amazing!  I followed the recipe, except for decreasing the honey to 1/4 cup (per other reviews) and it was perfect! Topped a salad with romaine, bl. beans, corn, tomatoes, red peppers, and red onion. It was delish!! Thank you, I will be making this regularly!

This recipes was amazing!  Like the others, I reduced the honey to 2 TBS and instead of EVOO, I used vegetable oil so that it would impart less flavor.  I also left out the jalapeno because my daughter doesn't eat anything spicey.  Awesome as a dressing or a marinade.

I hate to do this, but I have to review it.  I made this yesterday for my husband and I.  I cook a lot of Mexican food and am always looking for a great recipe.  

With that said, I prepared this recipe EXACTLY as stated.  I feel if you are going to review the recipe, you need to follow it to the letter.  Period.  This had potential, but it was SO sweet!  I really think having more of a 90% oil/vinegar mixture to a 10% honey mixture would have been better.  1/3 of a cup of honey is a lot.  I also found the ginger to be overpowering.  Will not put in next time.  

I would next time make this like a vinaigrette.  Maybe add a little dijon mustard.  Also jalapenos (seeded) would be nice.  To make it really over the top you could add sour cream and mayo, for a creamy salad dressing.  Yummy.  Will try that next and update with my results.

I have had salad 4 days in a row just so I can use this dressing! Highly recommended - only revision I made is cutting back on the honey (only because I don't have much of a sweet tooth).

Great taste...I think it's just a bit too sweet to be five stars, but I'll cut back on the honey next time. Served this over roasted chicken breasts and greens.

It had very interesting taste (in a good way of course). I didn't remove the seeds from the pepper because I love spicy food. I used ground ginger and didn't measure out the ingredients (just dumped them all in my blender), so mine turned out a little bit thick (less honey and oil, more lime juice, vinegar, and cilantro). I had this dressing with salad (black bean, corn, lettuce, tomato, avocado, red onion), but I think it will make a really good sauce for grilled chicken main dish. (I will try with my leftover dressing!)
***Edit: So with leftover dressing I made cilantro-lime chicken sandwich. Basically mix what you would use in salad (tomatos, avocado, red onion, black bean, etc) with the dressing and bit of mayo and add shredded/chopped chicken breast. Mix well until well coated. Toast 2 pcs of bread and put shredded cheese (I used cheddar) on both right away so it melts a little and put the sandwich filling in between the pcs of bread. Very yummy and my brother asked for a second! Freeze the leftover dressing so you can make this quick sandwich!

My husband bought a bunch of cilantro and since it doesn't keep well I went on line looking for recipes and found this.  The only ingredient I didn't have was the jalapenos so I went ahead and made it.  It sure looks vile but what a flavour!  I now go shopping for cilantro with this recipe in mind and try to find ways to use the left overs when I've made the salad dressing.

I didn't have ginger root (in fact, I have no idea what it is!), but this has become my new favorite dressing! I served it over a salad of: salad greens, green onions, tomatoes, a can of rinsed black beans, and corn. The salad was also topped with marinated/grilled chicken strips and seasoned/grilled tortillas (I brushed soft tortillas with olive oil, sprinkled a fiesta seasoning on them, and grilled them for 3-4 min each side, then cut them into strips). This is an amazing, light, and summery meal! Thanks for the great dressing recipe :)

Very tasty. A little too sweet, and didn't care for the olive oil flavor. I made again with a bit less honey and substituted grape seed oil for the olive oil, and it was great!

This is a WONDERFUL dressing. Like others, I decreased the sugar (I used 2-3 tsp of white sugar instead of honey) and used 1/3 cup olive oil instead of 1/2 cup. I served it with taco salad and intend to use it as my go-to dressing for this!

This dressing is fantastic! My husband absolutely loves it and so do I - I didn't have any jalapenos so I substituted three serranos and it worked just fine - will definitely go with jalapeno next time but we were still very satisfied with the result.

I really dislike the taste of cilantro, so I went light with it in this recipe.  I also decreased the amount of honey, like so many else have.  What a great flavor!!  I will definitely make it again.

AMAZING dressing! I brought this dressing to top a SW style salad and when the attendees there found out I made it, they hounded me for the recipe.  They ALL raved about how delicious and fresh it was.  Tastes even better the next day!  I found that 1/3C honey is too much and only added 2 tsp or so but that is just my personal preference.  The ginger gives it a nice kick.  I didn't have Balsamic so I used Red Wine Vinegar instead.  Fabulous recipe!

The dressing was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll cut the honey down to 1/4 cup.  I didn't have fresh ginger root, so I used 1/2 tsp powdered ginger.  Juice from 2 large limes did the job too.  Overall, a nice, light dressing.  Would make a good marinade too.  Thank you Lin!

I LOVE this recipe; I use it for salad dressing, marinade, glaze on fish anything really. Recently I added 1/2 a nice ripe avocado and pureed - yummy! Made it a little creamier, and helped keep the dressing emulsified. Try it!

I was looking for a low-fat alternative to ranch or a mayonnaise-based cilantro dressing for my Southwest chicken salad, and stumbled across this recipe.  I decided to give it a try, and boy am I ever glad I did!  It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy!  I'm a sissy when it comes to heat, so I was a little hesitant to use the jalapeno, but am glad I did.  I took all the seeds out, and it gave the dressing the right amount of heat for me.  In fact, I think I might even be brave and leave a few seeds in next time!  This is definitely a keeper for me, and I will be making it over and over again!

So delicious! Used two cloves of garlic, 1/4 C honey, and about 1/4 C olive oil. Was plenty sweet (almost a bit too sweet) and perfect amount of oil. I thought the full jalapeno would make it too spicy, but not at all - it was perfect. This dressing is SO flavorful and would work awesome as a marinade or even as a substitute for pesto. Took about 5 minutes to throw together. Made a salad with spinach leaves, corn, black beans, grated cheese, avocado slices, and grilled chicken. Drizzled the dressing over the top and fiance said "best salad I've ever had!"

This dressing is wonderful, my husband and I really loved it, so I gave it 5 stars for flavor and ease.  However, I made mine a day in advanced so naturally put it in the refrigerator to keep.  It solidified  to a pudding consistency.  I tried blending it and it just separated...nuked it in the microwave for a minute on low power, re-blended, and it came back to its original state :-)  Just a heads up if you plan to refrigerate.

This was very good, even though I did alter it a lot for lack of the correct ingredients.  Instead of lime juice, I added a bit more lemon juice than what it called for.  I also didn't have ginger root or garlic cloves on hand, so I put in a little bit of ginger and garlic powder instead to taste.  I also left out the jalapenos and instead placed peperoncinis on top of the salad, which was very good with tomatoes and peppers.  Overall, my family said it was different but that they loved it.  The next night when we had salads, my father requested the same salad dressing again over all the storebought kinds we have!  Thanks for a great recipe.  :)

Love it!  I was looking for a marinade to use for steak but now that I've made it I can't "waste it" as a marinade - it's THAT good!  I didn't have honey so I used light corn syrup inplace and it's awesome, can't wait to try it again with honey!

Excellent!  
Will also be using this as a sauce for the pan fish we catch on vacation.  I didn't minced the ginger and that was a big mistake that I'll never do again since ginger is fiberous.  Look forward to using this for entertaining.

Holy cow this is fantastic!!! I doubled everything except the honey. It was absolutely delicious! Wow!!

Update: I have made this several times this week. Everyone is raving about it. Follow the recipe exactly except try 2Tbs of honey first then add more to your taste. I wish I had found this recipe years ago.
 Unbelievably good!

Wow! I mixed 1 cup of quinoa (cooked according to package directions), 1can black beans, finely diced tomato, diced avacodo, red onion, corn, and added the dressing (about 3/4 of it), for an amazing black bean quinoa salad. This dressing is spot on and will be a staple. Maybe a tad less honey next time. Love this though!

I can be added to the long list of folks that love this salad dressing. So very delicious! I made some for a friend with young children and omitted the jalapeno and it was still a hit. For myself and my family I added like 1/4 t. of crushed red pepper flakes because I didn't have a jalapeno. Was just over the top wonderful!

Amazing! I was looking for ways to use up some freshly squeezed lime juice that I had on hand, and I'm SO glad that I found this recipe. This dressing took my simple, ordinary lunch salad over the top. I'm going to make main dish salads with grilled chicken for dinner tonight, just so I can use this dressing again. Yum!

This is the best dressing I have ever had!  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used powdered and it was still wonderful. I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  My mom does not like cilantro at all but she loved this dressing and asked for the recipe!  This has become my new go-to dressing.

I made this dressing tonight and it was great. For anyone who doesn't have all the ingredients on hand like me, this is what I used and it turned out fine: I didn't have jalapeno so I used dried chipotle chili pepper, I didn't have fresh ginger so I used candied ginger, and I didn't have olive oil so I used rice bran oil. I hope this is helpful to people who don't have all the ingredients and doesn't want to make a trip to the market

I rarely write reviews but once I tried this recipe, I had to let everyone know how delicious it is! I followed the recipe to a T, except I used less honey (1 tablespoon) because I like my dressings a bit more on the tangy side. SOOO good!! Def. don't skip the ginger...in my opinion this makes the salad. I can't say enough about how great this is. I couldn't stop eating salad because it's so good. THANK YOU for this recipe, as it will now be a staple in my house. :)

Wow, what a wonderful dressing recipe!  Made it today to have on our taco salad...  I replaced the honey with 2 packets Truvia, and used half the oil and replaced the other half with fat free sour cream.  It was delicious!  Definitely a keeper.

Very good dressing. Used it with the Southwest Salad that Heather suggested. YUMMMM. It is a keeper.  I made some homemade Guacamole and put it on the salad as well. Just kept getting better.

Excellent! I had a southwestern salad at a local restaurant, and wanted to make the salad at home. I searched for a recipe closest to the Lime Cilantro Dressing served with my salad, and this is the BEST! I made my own Southwestern Salad, with Lettuce, Grilled Chicken, Black Beans, Corn, Tortilla Chip strips, and this dressing. I have served this to guests, and they have raved about it! This dressing is EXCELLENT!!!!!

just cut the amount of honey in half if you like less sweetness, throw everything in the food processor, grind, and voila! deliciously perfect dressing! I served it on a spinach, grilled corn, sunflower seed, red bell pepper, and avocado salad. Yum!!!

This dressing was FANTASTIC! We used it as a dressing on a grilled chicken salad overloaded with yummy veggies (everything from yellow bell peppers to fresh corn) and it was unreal. I could eat that every single night! My only change would be to make a lot of this! Maybe double or quadruple the recipe as this made only 3 servings in our household. I didn't use a full 1/3 c of the honey but I also didn't measure.. just put a huge helping to what I think would measure maybe 1/4 cup. It was so fantastic though! Thank you for the recipe!

This is most excellent! I made it last night and my husband brushed it on portobello mushrooms, steak and chicken - grilled them outside and it is delicious on all of them.  Wonderful on a bed of spinach too!

Just made it. Husband does not eat jalapenos nor ginger. Substituted ginger and jalapeno for red peppers instead.  Delicious! I think no matter what is substituted, it is a winner :) Thanks for this recipe!

loved this recipe.  Did decrease honey like some others did.  Also decreased oil to 1/4 cup.  Added extra garlic and full tsp of ginger.  Also increased fresh lime juice to 1/2 cup.  Best dressing I have ever tried.

Wow, this was soo delicious and easy! I couldn't find my balsamic and forgot the ginger (oops!), but this was perfect regardless. I also put in a tad less honey and it was just simply amazing. Used my immersion blender and made in the cup that came with it, so clean up was a breeze! My boyfriend was asking for salad again the next day- definitely a good sign :)

Just wonderful. Used it over baby spinach, tomato and onion salad(all I had on hand). Spinach is a bit strong for the strong flavors of the dressing so suggest milder greens. Looking forward to having it with chicken. Yummmmm. I made this again with just a tiny bit of the jalapeno seeds left in it and it phenomenal!. This dressing can go where no dresssing has gone before!.  Would love to try it on shrimp fajita or fish tacos. TY so much for sharing with us.  Update-made this tonight with bottled jalepeno slices, all I had. just grand! Served over bed of arugala, chicken, charred corn, red onion and julienne red pepper. Super delish.

This stuff is AMAZING!! Since everyone seemed to think it was too sweet, the ONLY thing I changed was to reduce the honey to 1/4 cup (instead of the original 1/3 cup). I used a portion of the dressing to marinate salmon fillets, which I then cooked on a skillet. When they were done, I drizzled a little more of the dressing on top. Let me tell you, I felt like I died and went  to heaven when I tasted it. Thank you!!

Very tasty!  Sweet, but not overly sweet with a definite bite from the jalapenos and then with a tanginess from the lime.  A very welcome change from the every day ho-hum bottled dressings.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Lin!

I wanted to love this - really I did, but for my palate the taste of balsamic vinegar and olive oil were far too prominent.  I followed the exact recipe but it didn't meet my expectations.

I made this recipe as written. All I could taste was the over powering taste of olive oil. I will try this recipe again, but did throw it out the first time I made it. I refrigerated it for a couple of hours. I will try it again because I love cilantro and lime. Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the salt.  I didn't add any initially. On the first tasting I realized that it definitely needed salt - I added sea salt from a grinder.  But then it still needed more- not really a salt fan I then used Mrs. Dash salt free Carribean citrus.  This did the trick!  OMG I ate a whole bag of salad and threw it on my chicken also.

This was delicous dressing and so easy to make! I needed a dressing to go on top of our Tri-Tip Southwestern salad and this was perfect! It is a bit sweet but I have a sweet tooth so it didn't bother me. I highly recommend trying this one!

I made this as close to the exact recipe except I flipped the honey & lime juice measurements (only because I prefer tangy to sweet). It was amazing! Thank you! I'll try the vinegar suggestions next time too!

Great cilantro dressing!  Made it last night and brushed it on grilled chicken and everyone loved it.  The ginger really makes the dressing don't omit it!  My friend asked what was in it and when I said ginger he said "wow I don't even like ginger and its amazing.  I did add a a little zest from the lime, a pinch of cumin and 1/4 cup of chopped onion and it really made the dressing.  FYI this is on the sweeter side so use less honey for a less sweet dressing!  Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe except for cutting back the honey to 3T and used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 canola.  It was excellant.  I poured it overa slaw of green cabbage, carrots and red bell pepper.

It was a little sweet and next time I will use more lime than honey. I marinaded the chicken in some of the dressing before grilling, tossed the salad in the rest and drizzled a little on the cooked chicken. Fabulous. Thanks Lin for sharing. Will make this again and again! My family raved about it

Pretty tasty stuff!  I did increase the lime juice to 1/3 Cup, decreased the honey to 1/4 Cup (I actually used Agave Nectar instead) and I only put in a couple pinches of salt.  Nice, light dressing :)

Very good! My boyfriend love it and I plan on making it again. It's good to make when you have leftover cilantro and don't know what to do with it.

Just made this dressing minus the jalapeno and substituting candied ginger since I didn't have a useable root in the house...DELICIOUS!  This will be on my favorites page, for sure!

The recipe was great, though we didn't have fresh ginger and used powedered instead (tst! tst! Our mom shook her head. Always use fresh ingredients, dear! Always!) And also reduced the amount of honey to about 3 1/2 tbsp., since we are all into tangy (otherwise, it would have been too sweet, hence the rating). Everyone used the dressing for dipping spicy chicken wings at dinner and they loved it! Thanks for sharing!

Just made this tonight since my husband found it looking for something to make with all our extra limes from a weekend gathering. Great dressing and for a couple who hates eating salad, it made us want more. As suggested, I cut the honey to a nit less than 1/4 cup and added more cilantro. Such a tasty dressing with a great balance of tart and sweet. Add a bit more salt if you think it's a bit lacking in something - completes the flavor.

Great recipe but I had to omit the cilantro because I didn't have any.  I ended up adding some chipotle powder instead of the cilantro to impart some tex-mex flavoring.  I also had to replace the fresh ginger with powdered.  Still ended up really great for a taco salad but I'd want to try it in the original recipe as well.

I wish I would have cut the balsamic or omitted it altogether. It was strong and made the dressing too sweet. I'm hoping it will balance out when I put it on lettuce, but as is, it's too sweet.

This was an amazing dressing! I tasted a salad at a restaurant that I wanted to recreate and found this recipe to go with it. I made it for my family and they loved it. My step-mom even made it and took it to a friends house to use on fish tacos and salad. It is very easy too!

Sooooo delicious and refreshing on a summer time salad!!!  I have even made it without the peppers, and it is still wonderful!  I love tossing it in a salad with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, corn, black olives, black beans, grilled chicken, and crushed up tositoes.  Perfect for lunch or dinner on a hot day!

This was delicious! I made a few adjustments since I was missing a few ingredients: I used 1/4c brown sugar instead of honey, 1/4tsp ground ginger instead of fresh, omitted the balsamic oil, and added a some extra cilantro. We put it over a salad with warm chicken - delicious!!!

LOVE IT!! I've made it several times and the base is so solid that no matter which ingredients I tweak, it always turns out great. I make it in double and triple batches and keep it in mason jars. Mine keeps for days, sometimes weeks if I add an extra thin layer of olive oil to the jar. I tend to go heavy on the greens: cilantro and jalapeño and add generous garlic and ginger. It's an amazing flavor pop as a salad dressing or for grilled meats and fish.

I added more garlic and it was delicious- I used it as a marinade for chicken and also portobello mushroom caps, both of which we grilled.  So many compliments by all!

Wished I made a full batch the second I taste-tested it! I used slightly less honey, and it was great on spring mix. Went well with burrito bowl.

The reviews are accurate. This is a great and easy to make dressing.  I used an entire bunch of cilantro (top or leaves only).

My family loved this dressing.  I have made it twice once with parsley instead of cilantro.  Great both ways.  I used it as a marinade for the chicken I served with the salad too.  Next time I have to bring a salad to a party, this is the dressing!

Made this up to use up some cilantro and just tried it on a plain lettuce salad. Can't wait to try it tonight with leftover steak, avocado, black bean and corn and all the other fixings on a salad. I had lime olive oil and Serrano honey vinegar. Yum!

Made this to go with a summer kale salad listed on AR.  I'm always apprehensive when trying a new recipe.  I took a lick off of the lid of my blender.  Unbelievable taste!!!! After I poured it into the mason jar, I had to have a spoonful.  Then I put it on our shrimp/fish tacos I served tonight.  This will be a standard dressing in my house.  Also I do not like to change the recipe, but I did not have fresh ginger, so I substituted it with 1/2 tsp of regular ginger.  I cannot thank you enough for submitting, and I will be using fresh ginger next time.

We had it on grilled shrimp and beef, as well as the sauce for a bagged coleslaw mix.... Huge hit!

So full of flavor.  I brushed the boneless  skinless chicken breasts with this dressing as they cooked.  Served the chicken with soba noodles and spooned the dressing over the noodles and the chicken.  What a great taste!  Thanks for this yummy recipe!

This "Cilantro-Lime Dressing" is excellent! I made this recipe only because it had such a high rating. I personally don't like jalapeno peppers (they burn my mouth) and my husband usually refuses to eat raw garlic in salad. Also, neither of us likes sweet foods, and this recipe has a lot of honey. It was sweet, and I will cut back on the sweetener next time; however, this recipe is a keeper! Thanks Lin.

I used extra balsamic and less oil.  I didn't have a jalapeño so I used a sprinkle of cayenne.  It's very good. I'll make it again and hopefully I'll have the jalapeño to stick to the recipe. It made me want more salad.

I just made this dressing and it is delicious! I followed the recipe, except I used a little less than 1/3 cup of honey. I put all the ingredients in the blender and it turned out great! Used it on a kale salad. I will definitely try using it as a marinade on chicken.

Just tried this, and it's delicious!!! I served it on spinach with grilled chicken and it was perfect. I used powdered ginger because I didn't have fresh, and it was still wonderful, better than my usual vinegar/olive oil + spices recipe.

Tangy and fresh flavoured dressing.  Have used it on many different salads. Does not keep well overnight, so use it all at once or make less if required.  Very good.

I guess I should have read the reviews- you don't taste cilantro and lime as much as you expect. It is sweet. It looks pretty and you can work with it, but I probably won't make it again.

VERY GOOD DRESSING!!  It goes great with chicken cut up on top of the salad. Even better when you can use the lettuce and cilantro fresh out of your garden. Add some cheddar cheese, avocado slices, and cran-raisins and you have just as good if not better than any restaurant salad! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great dressing! i served it with a "mexican- style" salad consisting of romaine, jicama, roasted corn, black beans, purple onion, pepitas and black olives.  I added a whole avocado into the blender with all the other ingredients which gave it a creamier texture and beautiful color.

A great recipe! Thank you! I make this often. I love it and it's not too sweet for me, it's perfect! I sometimes make it with safflower oil in place of olive oil for a lighter flavor. I use 1/2 tsp dried ginger in place of the fresh ginger. I suggest that you really tightly pack your 1/4 cup with cilantro leaves. Delicious!

Yummy, Lin! Great dressing.  I halved all the wet ingredients and kept the everything else the same.  I used a Vitamix and ended up with a creamy green dressing for two.  Perfecto!

Yowza.  How is this stuff so amazing?  I upped the ginger a bit, reduced the honey quite a bit, and otherwise was faithful to the recipe.  It's got a kick!  We both LOVED this and cannot wait to have it again.  It's the perfect thing to do with leftover cilantro.

Amazing!  I only used 2 tablespoons of honey and it was still fairly sweet.  I also added a little more cilantro and vinegar and found it was perfect.  Overall it keeps really well in the refrigerator for a few days!

Got me at lime and cilantro. I like to make a recipe as close to as written as possible, at least on the first try. I don't use honey, but decided to by some i used a very small amount and glad i did. I made a chopped salad with corn,black beans,green onion,radish and added Cotija cheese and avacado. Added chicken to my husbands. We both liked it wish i would have doubled it but will make again. I also think i added a bit more lime. Like it tangy.

Absolutely wonderful just the way it is. I made a nice southwest chicken salad, and this was just the dressing recipe I was looking for. Very much like the stuff I had at the restaurant. I will be making it again for sure!

Tasty but way too much honey . Use about half the amount the recipe calls for so you can enjoy the flavor of the salad too. Thanks for the recipe Lin , please stay out of tgi friday and the like its over salted/sweetened junk food.

This was delish!  I've been looking for a salad dressing anywhere that is light like the summer one at Qdoba.  This hit the spot.  I broiled some chicken breast only seasoning with salt, pepper, chilli powder, and garlic powder.  Then, I put it over a bed of spring mix, salsa, and cheese.  This turned into a wonderful EASY dinner that you don't feel guilty about getting seconds!

This is delicious on a southwest salad, but it's even better on a chicken mango avocado salad. 1 cooked chicken breast or thigh, 1 ripe mango (I used a Manila), and 1 ripe avocado cut up on a bed of greens. This dressing does magical things to a ripe mango in salad!

Very tasty. The flavor improves with age. At first taste (after 10 minutes) it was eh. But we loved it the next day for a dinner salad. Amazing on a southwestern salad. This is amazing with black beans. The second time I made this recipe, I doubled it. Next time, I will use less honey maybe 1/4cup instead of 1/3. I do like things less sweet, especially salad dressings, so make to suit your taste buds.

Wow. I tried hard to resist eating by the spoonful! This is a recipe that can truly be altered according to your  preference and still come out amazing. Due to  allergies, we substitute agave for the honey. I made this dressing for a Mexican themed birthday dinner for our teenage son. All 10 teens present ate up their salad and some asked for seconds. (even the non salad eaters!) I added a bit extra garlic and used up the remaining cilantro that I had on hand (1/2 C packed) I also used a full teaspoon of fresh ginger. 
We used the remaining dressing to marinate chicken tenders which were outstanding.

It's important to note that the first time I made this dressing I followed the instructions to a "T" except for the honey substitution. It is delicious either way!
I want to add that I agree with the reviews about it being sweet. If you use too much it can be overbearing. A little goes a long way!

This is so yummy.  I'm not really into hot either but I did half of the jalapeno and it was fine.  The lime and cilantro tame the jalapeno.  I don't know how long it would last in the fridge so I was so sad when I had to throw like half of it away when it eventually turned :(.  It makes a lot...about what you get in a store bought dressing size.  Highly recommend...going to make again very soon.

Very nice dressing, the only thing I would change up next time is increase the cilantro (I love that stuff) and the jalapeno because I like the spicy/sweet combo.  This would also work really well as a marinade.  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious! Tastes similar to Cafe Rio's awesome dressing!  Only change was that I used dried ginger instead of fresh ginger root.  
I tossed together with Romaine lettuce, 1/2 cup corn, 1/2 cup black beans, 1/3 cup black olives, 1 chopped Roma Tomato, 2 tablespoons shredded cheddar, and topped with crushed tortilla chips.  YUMMY!

Awesome dressing!! I cut down a little bit on the jalapeños, garlic & honey ( just personal preference ) , but this is one of those dressings that you can tweak to your liking and it'll still come out great! I put it over a mix of greens, kale, raisins, chicken & feta. Great dressing for a healthier salad!

This dressing was perfect!  I served it with a salad of marinated chicken, veggies,  corn and black beans.  I didn't have a jalapeno, but used a similar portion of canned green chilies I had on hand.  This reduced the spice too if you prefer a more mild dressing.  I will definitely make this again!

This was great with a green salad topped with grilled chicken.  This dressing will also make a fantastic marinade for the chicken.  I was also thinking about using this as a dressing for a corn, black bean, and avocado salad.  There are so many things you can do with this dressing!

Really good.  I made with half a jalepeno because I was worried it would be too hot, but will use a whole next because it was not spicy at all.  Otherwise made as written.  Next time I may cut down on the honey because we like things less sweet.  However, this recipe is excellent as written.

Great recipe. But I would have to agree on the honey. A bit too sweet. I will make again but maybe cut the honey to 1/8 or 1/4 cup verses 1/3.

Made this several times now, it is the best cilantro lime dressing ever for multiple purposes.  As many other reviewers have said, the amount of honey called for is a bit much.  I only use about a tablespoon or so of either honey or agave nectar.  I use a little less olive oil if I want to use it as a meat or fish rub, a little more if I want it as a marinade, it's very flexible.  For a dressing for green salads, I also tried adding a squirt of dijon mustard, this helps to emulsify the mixture better, makes it a tad "creamier."  Just reduce the amount of vinegar if you do, and use red wine or rice vinegar, so it doesn't compete with the flavor.

WARNING: when cutting & handling the jalapeno be careful and wear gloves as I burnt my fingers so bad when slicing. Back to the dressing...Absolutely DELICIOUS! A local restaurant of mine has a tequila lime dressing that has cilantro in it and I've been looking to replicate it! This is as close as it gets. I might try adding (boiled) tequila to it and see how it comes out, but Lin's recipe is still scrumptious. It really adds a kick to your every day salad, and is a great change from normal every day (sometimes boring) dressing! Yum :)

This is the first recipe I've tried, after having a similar experience at a local restaurant.  I'm sticking with this one, absolutely delicious, simple to prepare, and makes our chicken salad mouth watering.  Thanks so much!

This dressing is soooo good! It reminded me of a mojito! I used only 1/4 cup olive oil and it was fine. I also used about five cloves garlic and a cup of cilantro. It is a sweet dressing so the honey could go down a bit but I liked it sweet. I put it on a chop salad with lettuce, quinoa, chicken, avocado, more cilantro, black beans, cheese, and other odds and ends. So delicious!

I thought this was a good but not great salad dressing.  It would make an excellent maranade though.

This is a great dressing, but it was too hot for our tastes. I used it for salad, maybe for meat it would be totally great. Next time I will reduce jalapeno.

Fabulous on Fish Tacos! Extremely easy to customize as I don't think it's possible to make a mistake with these great ingredients. I omitted the honey and ginger and used rice vinegar instead of balsamic. I used about 2 tsp. of Jalapeno Tabasco brand sauce instead of the fresh pepper and used extra cilantro and lime juice. Excellent! Just use what you like and taste as you go along. (Keeping in mind what food you are trying to compliment, of course.) Will do this again and add the ginger and a bit of honey for a chicken marinade.

since i have just had this for the third time in two days, i am going to say that i loved this.  i followed the recipe to a T which is rare for me. if i did have to change one thing though, i think i would cut back on the olive oil next time, or perhaps add just a bit more balsamic and up the ginger just a smidge for personal preferences.  thanks so much for the post Lin!

This dressing is delicious! I made it as is, except I added some ground cumin. Made a nice salad with pinto beans, romaine lettuce, tomatoes and avocado. It reminds me of the Santa Fe salad at the cheesecake factory. Thanks for sharing this great recipe :)

This recipe is delicious and tastes pretty exactly like the dressing from Friday's.  I worked there and knew it well, and this is just as delicious.  It's supposed to be sweet and tangy; that's the beauty of it.  The only difference I made was to use powdered ginger instead of fresh because I did not have it.  Other than that, this is perfect as it is.

An awesome dressing.  Used a little less honey and ground ginger instead of fresh.  Grilled up some chicken, pineapple and shrooms - using this as a marinade.  Then put all that stuff on a salad with black beans, tomatoes and shredded cheese and topped with this dressing.  We will be having this again and again.  Yummy!

I used this dressing with 1 head of shredded cabbage, a cucumber, and red & green bell peppers to make a delicious coleslaw that went really well as a light side dish for a big Mexican dinner. I made it the day before and that gave the dressing time to marinate the cabbage. Keeps very well in the refrigerator.

Amazing! I could dip bread in this, use it as a marinade for chicken or steak, and eat it by the buckets-full. It hits all the notes- sweet, spicy, sour, tangy, and most of all: delicious. My mom likes to call me for dressings and I'm happy to pass this one along. Food processor makes all the difference, I might save an old bought dressing bottle and fill it with this instead next time. I put in about three times the ginger on accident, and eyeballed everything, and it was wonderful. Thanks!

I cant give this 5 stars because i didnt use all igredients called for.  I am not a fan of ginger so i didnt use that.  I also do not like sweet foods so i left out the honey.  The dressing was fanstastic but I felt it needed more of a "bite".  Maybe my jalepeno wasnt spicy enough.  I added a tablespoon more, or so, of balsamic vinager.  I added kosher salt to taste.  Delicious!! I cant wait for dinner to have a full salad with this dressing.  I honestly dont think any honey is necessary at all.  Balsamic is plenty sweet on its own.  Next time i make this (and there WILL be a next time), i will use the seeds from the pepper.  Everytime I make my own dressing i wonder why I dont do it more often.  This is far better than any bottled dressing ive had!!

Really really yummy!  The only thing I left out was the ginger because I didn't have any.  I had this on a plain lettuce and tomato salad and it was SO good!  Can't imagine how good it would be on something even more delicious.  The best homemade salad dressing I have tried so far!  Thanks for the recipe!

We liked this a lot. I don't think I used quite enough jalapeno (I used the jarred rings--8 of them total--and would go with 12 next time). I didn't change the amount of honey, because I like a sweet dressing, and it is there to augment the heat of the jalapenos. I did reduce the olive oil to 1/3c. instead of the full 1/2c. because it just felt like a LOT of oil to me, much more than my usual dressings, and I would do that again. It blends into the most wonderful green color! I served it over a spinach salad with sliced up Blackened Chicken from this site. Thanks, we'll have this again! (Probably with onions in it next time too!)

This was the best dressing I have ever had.  That's the honest truth.  I reduced the amount of honey to less than 2 tablespoons because I felt the amount listed was way too much, and I also redused the amount of olive oil, but other than that, I followed the recipe as listed.  It makes the plainest salad interesting.  I used the leftover dressing for some leftover spinach (that's it!), and yum, it was SO good.

Loved this!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and only added 1/4 cup of honey.  I also put in some fresh garlic shoots and a little dried red chile pepper.  The result was eally zingy and delicious!  We ate it on shrimp taco salad.

This was very good. I made it as is wanting to know what I was starting with. I did use ground ginger so used less than recipe calls for. Also used dry cilantro- about 1 Tbsp. I would agree to use less honey (next time I will try 1/4 cup) and leave the rest as is. I did make fresh salsa and seasoned my chicken with fajita seasoning. We both loved it!

I did not like the taste of raw garlic in this, I thought it was too sweet, and I think significantly more ginger would have been good. I think I'll try it again with these adjustments.

I really liked this dressing but the next time I make it I'm going to follow another reviewers suggestion and increase the lime juice to 1/3 cup and decrease the honey to 1/4 cup. For me, the honey taste seemed to overpower the other flavors.

So very tasty.  Tangy and spicy.  I am not a huge fan of ginger but this recipe wouldn't be half as good without it.  I have made it both with and without cilantro and I find it makes for two unique yet equally delicious dressings.  I am now catering all my meals around this dressing.  Grilled chicken sanwich with CLD, Haloumi cheese salad with CLD, the options are endless.

Excellent flavor but too sweet. The combination of the honey and balsamic vinegar is a little strong on the sweet side. I would either reduce the honey by about half, or use a different vinegar, such as malt vinegar.

Follow this excellent recipe as-is, but make sure to measure. Recipe is exactly right as described. I’ve made this several times, and I tend to throw too much cilantro and jalapeño into the blender (due to laziness); it’s not hard to taste-test and balance ingredients if you neglect to measure too.

Way too sweet as written. Not 5 star worthy unless adjusted and most the reviews recommend changes. I will have to try to salvage it with more vinegar, salt, something.

I made this as  directed and it  was wonderful! I initially made it to drizzle on  pulled pork tacos and for jalapeno poppers from the grill. But it really can be used for so many other things: shrimp, salmon, oysters, pork chops...yum!

Love this dressing!  It was so good.  I changed it a bit but I think it would have tasted delicious as is.  I love garlic so I added 2 or 3 extra cloves.  I didn't have ginger so I used ginger powder instead.

The base ingredient mix of this recipe is nice; however, we found it too sweet for our liking. Next time I make it, I will do as others suggested and use 1/4 honey, 1/3 cup lime juice and double the cilantro.  We like things a little spicy so I will add in more jalapeño as that background heat was really nice. Good recipe, you just need to adapt the measurements to your liking.

Great recipe, I made and then I made it again. I did not like the balsamic vinegar or how sweet it was. 
This is what I changed and it is terrific!
2-jalapeño, 2-clove garlic, 3/4 - ginger, the juice of 1 1/2-2 - limes, 1 1/2 -2 tsp white sugar, 2-tsp white wine vinegar, 1/2- salt, 1/2 - cup of cilantro leaves, 1/3-1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil or same amount of avocado oil. Then mix as above. Love it, thank you

Looked this up after eating a wonderful Salad dressed with something like this at a high end Mexican restaurant in Asheville.  I subtracted the balsamic, eliminated the ollive oil, and substituted a more neutral (grapeseed) oil to allow the delicate lime/cilantro to stand out. Why would you want to use balsamic on a Mexican inspired mixture? Also I added coriander (fresh ground) since coriander and cilantro are natural together. Came out light and fresh just like I had on my salad. Almost better.

Delicious!  I made this to go on a cold shrimp, black bean and rice salad I made and it was a hit.  It came out quite spicy, but I love spice, so I loved it.  I omitted the garlic and used red wine vinegar instead of the balsamic (since I didn't have any) and it turned out still very delicious.  This might be a bit too vinegary and spicy to just go on a green salad (in my opinion), but would be amazing as a marinade for any kind of meat, seafood, or shellfish or on a pasta or cold rice salad (like how I used it).  This one's a keeper!

Followed this one right to the 'T' and was amazing!  Was afraid of the jalapeño, but had the perfect amount of bite... I don't like heat, but this was great!  The only think I would do is reduce the honey to half... was really good, but want to see if I can reduce calories and it was pretty sweet.  Not a bad sweet, though!  :) Used this for healthy bowls, using spring mix, black beans, grilled chicken, corn, avocado and it was perfect.  Can't wait to make it again!  I should also mention that this was my very first time make any sort of dressing, and it was easy and delicious!

I made this fresh tasting dressing according to the recipe. Very good blend of tastes. I drizzled it over Chef John's Grilled Jerk Pork Tenderloin and topped it with queso fresco. Delicious!

I first came upon this recipe when my husband brought home a bundle of cilantro and I was searching ways to use it before it went bad.  Now I buy cilantro for this recipe first, then search other ways to use the left overs!  Either with or without jalapeño, it’s good either way.

I personally have never had a problem with it not keeping .

I gave this 3 stars as it is  because it's way too sweet with that much honey, but I cut the honey back to 1 Tbsp and it's 5 stars.  I make this and toss it with coleslaw mix and serve it with fish tacos--delicious!!

Too sweet for my tastes. Made the recipe as written with a 1/3 cup of honey, dressing is very sweet. Might try again with less honey. But, don't think I can eat as a salad dressing, trying to use as a chicken marinade now.

I left out the jalapeno and salt. I threw everything into my food processor and it came out delicious. This is my new go-to recipe for salad dressing. I highly recommend this! It'd even be a great sauce to eat on top of some meat.

The recipe calls for too much honey. Even when I used less it was too sweet, hence I did have to use more salt and lime juice. Also I used two jalapenos as they were smaller and with one I did not even feel a kick. Nice base recipe to play around with. Thanks!

Served over home-grown romaine topped with grilled chicken, Monterey Jack cheese, sweet corn off the cob, grilled tomatoes and homemade croutons.  My husband ate two plates!  So tasty!  I cut back on the honey as suggested and will definitely make again only next time I'll kick it up with by not seeding the jalapeno!  This is so easy and so, so delicious!

I have never tried it at TGI Friday but I thought the honey sounded like too much.  I make other vinaigrette dressings with similar proportions, but not that much honey.  So I started out with only a scant 1/4 cup and it was still too sweet for me.  I ended up adding a little more balsamic vinegar, garlic and salt and it was very tasty!  I will definitely make more.

This dressing is amazing.  I made it as shown the first time and the honey dominated the flavor.  I made it again and used Agave Nectar instead of honey thinking it would compliment the flavor profile.  I also reduced the amount to 1/2 cup to let the jalapeno flavor come through a little more.  It was absolutely perfect!  I can't keep it in the house long so I make a double batch each time now.

I added a little Stevia, but not much. Double the recipe for three people and add an extra garlic clove and more ginger to cut the bitterness normally remedied with the sugar. This was a bit too salty, so I will use less next time. Great dressing.

Fantastic! I'm always looking to replicate dressings I enjoy but cannot happen because I am gluten-free and dairy free. All the ingredients in this recipe I normally have in my house so it was super easy to whip up and was ready in less than three minutes. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves cilantro lime dressing! How's good on top of char grilled mahi mahi too!

This is the best cilantro-lime dressing I have made. I did decrease the honey to 1/4 cup and doubled the cilantro. I also used 1/4 cup ground ginger as I didn't have any fresh ginger. It was fantastic. I used it on a mixed green salad with grilled chicken,  fresh pineapple, red onion, and candied pecans and cherries. Delicious!

This is delicious - I plan on making this a lot and eating it on EVERYTHING!! I did some adjusting with salt and lime juice but basically stuck to the recipe. You have to let it sit a while for the flavours to marry. I marinated tofu in the dressing and served it on quinoa, black beans, tomato, cucumber & red onion. Also mixed it with some vegan cream cheese and used it as a dip, and ate it on its own with potato patties.I could seriously drink this stuff. Just go make it already!!!

This dressing/marinade is one of the many outstanding recipes on this site.  It is delicious and so versatile.  I made it as directed except I didn't have fresh jalapeño so I used canned.  I used it with  Mahi Mahi fish tacos, first marinating the fish for about 20 minutes and then grilling it on my stove top grill pan.  I then drizzled it over the fish, purple cabbage and pepper jack cheese in a slightly fried corn tortilla. Delicious and pretty presentation.  The next night I used it on a grilled chicken salad, first marinating the chicken tenders for about 30 minutes and then grilling them. Drizzled more dressing on top of the chicken and salad greens with pimento olives, cucumber, grape tomatoes, avocado and crushed tortilla chips on top.  This dressing would be great on Cole slaw or cooked with shrimp, garlic and butter.  Thanks for the recipe.  Husband loved it and it will become a regular in our house.

I omitted the garlic, and I didn't have balsamic vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar instead.  It's lick-the-plate delicious.

I had some avocados and tomatoes that were about to be over ripe, so I whipped this up to dress them with.  Only had jarred jalapeño slices, no fresh.  Added 1/2 tsp of Dijon mustard to keep it from separating.  This is my new favorite go-to dressing!  It tastes so fresh!

I made chicken and cheese falutas and used this dressing for the salad to go with my Mexican dinner.  Yum, everyone liked this, its a keeper.  I didn't change anything, except made it for 6 servings.  It's light and fresh tasting.  This will be my go to dressing for Mexican and Latin American dinners.

First dressing I've ever made! I was impressed, though it is slightly too sweet. I just eyeballed when adding the honey, so the fault is my own. Great flavors, I'm excited to try more recipes!

I made it as written.  I put it on the salad right from the blender.  It was not very good; it was runny and lacked depth.   A couple of hours later after the flavors had time to meld and the dressing allowed to thicken, it was delicious!  Will definitely make it again!

So full of fresh flavor! I would suggest only making what you will use right away though. I adjusted amount to make about 4 servings because of previous comments that it does not keep well. Glad I did, because I did have a little left and since it was so good I kept it, and when I went to use it a day or two later, it really was not the same.

The jalapeño is just too much. I will omit it completely next time. Otherwise a good dressing.

Easy to make, but a little too sweet in my opinion. Next time, I'd only add half the amount of honey for which it calls. We ended up adding more vinegar and ginger to balance out the sweetness. I would have added extra lime if I had it. I also added some sriracha to my food, which helped to combat the sweetness. It went really well with sriracha!

Absolutely delicious! Although I did take heed from previous posters on the honey/lime ratio. I used only 2 tablespoons of honey and lime, then after processing I added a bit more lime juice to suit our taste. I used the 10 ounce pre-packaged shredded slaw and gradually added the dressing until I got the mix I wanted. I ended up using almost all of the dressing.

I was trying to reproduce a salad dressing that my husband loved from Trader Joe's.  This is it! Perfect, and delicious! Well worth the work put into it. I tripled it, but probably should have made even more.

This dressing was good! I've been looking for a good cilantro-lime dressing to make myself since I found out I have food allergies and can't really buy dressing from the store anymore. Little too sweet for my taste, but I will be making again and will probably lessen the amount of honey and up the lime juice as others have suggested.

This was great, made it just as listed, was a little bit sweet when you taste it but once it is on the salad it was great. Used it with the Chicken Fiesta Salad on this site and my wife asked when we could have it again. Great dish.

I just made this and had to come straight back and give it a 5 star review.  I thought the jalapeno was going to make this too hot...nope.  I loved it.   I forgot to pick up fresh ginger...i used a little powdered.  I bet the fresh is even better.

I had to use a balsamic reduction so I used only 1 teaspoon instead of 2. Also, I used less than 1/4c blue agave nectar instead of 1/3c honey. Possibly my modifications were a mistake because I thought this dressing was too sweet. But, otherwise, had great flavor!

Good - little oily but may just be because it hasn't sat for at least a day yet. Replaced 1/2 of lime juice with lemon juice and half of olive oil with black truffled olive oil. Nice savory taste and the Himalayan sea salt is always more impressive to my senses than any other salt yumm

I made this dressing tonite not sure of what to think.  WOW!  This dressing is awesome.  We drizzled this dressing on our tacos and what a difference it made.  A light, tangy, and refreshing twist on tacos.  I will make this again soon.  Great job, Lin!

I have made this recipe twice now and both times I loved it. On the picture however, the dressing is a light kind of yellow with green flecks. Mine is very green. I do not mind that I was just wondering why? I cut down on the honey just a tad and will add an additional jalapino if mine do not smell hot enough. My husband is not a salad lover like me so I cut up cukes, tomatoes, all colors bell peppers and avocado and just pour the dressing over it. Delicious!!!

I was hesitant to use all the listed ingredients (jalapeno and ginger) because I was worried it would be a clash of strong flavors. But I made it as the recipe instructed... maybe the honey mellowed them out. I was flavor packed but not spicy. This was awesome on a chicken salad. Thanks for the recipe!

I think I've died and gone to salad heaven! I can't believe that something this delicious came out of MY food processor! It is seriously good. I drizzled it over shredded green leaf lettuce, sugar snap peas, Vidallia sweet onion slivers, chunks of mozzarella cheese and black beans. (Oh, I cut the honey in half in order to better taste the lime juice.)

My version came out very well, and three days later the flavor hasn't changed much at all. My limes were stingy, so I may have gotten two tablespoons of juice from them. I also cut down the balsamic a bit and used a couple pinches of sea salt instead of table. Instead of fresh jalapeno, I used pickled, and supplemented the lime juice with jalapeno brine (2-3 T) & lime zest (1-2 tsp). Barely used a tablespoon of honey, if that. May have gone a bit light on the olive oil, too. It doesn't matter. It tasted great. 

Maybe if I'd gotten more juice from my limes more honey would've been needed, but as it is, 1/3 cup seems far too generous for my taste. You could probably replace the lime juice with pineapple juice (but add some zest, maybe?), omit the honey entirely, and have a similarly delicious dressing.

This was excellent.  I used agave syrup in place of honey (in the same proportion) and it was awesome.  This recipe could easily be tweaked to personal preference and still be great!  I'm going to make this often

My goodness...I will never buy dressing from the store again. This was beyond delicious! I used as a marinade one night for chicken breast, and a dressing a few nights later (with red pepper, onion, fresh jalapeno, grated cheddar) and WOW again! My 3 year old drank/licked the remaining dressing off of her plate.

I didn't initially make it with jalapeno (I didn't have any on hand at the time) but I know it would be fantastic, and will definitely make it with all ingredients next time.

I used this dressing for the chicken I used to make lettuce wraps.  It was delicious.  We really enjoyed it and I will be making it again and again throughout the summer!  Will try it for grilling as well.  Would be great to marinate chicken/fish/shrimp!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This dressing is really fantastic. I took the suggestions of so many others on here and used 1/4 honey and 1/3 vinegar. The sweetness was perfect. I chose to leave out the salt, and I also halved the oil (personal preference). The recipe still came out great. I will definitely make it again.

I LOVE this recipe! I first tried this for a Super Bowl potluck so I would have something healthy to eat and it was the one dish everyone was raving about. They even asked for me to send them the recipe which I did of course. I did make a few substitutions: 1/3 cup lime juice and 2 tablespoons honey, plus a good amount of salt to really bring out the flavors. 

I served it over a salad which included crunchy romaine lettuce, frozen corn (thawed), sliced olives, avocado, jicama, tomato, cotija cheese and a little extra salt and pepper in the salad (in addition to in the dressing -it just makes for a more full flavored dish). 

If you're wanting some protein or to make this for a meal, try adding some chopped, cooked chicken breast (I prefer BBQ-ing a chicken breast with just olive oil and salt and pepper, letting it cool for ten minutes and then chopping and adding to the salad). You could also add some tortilla chips for extra crunch. 

I've since made this recipe numerous times and I LOVE it more every time! Definitely added as a regular recipe in our home.

I'm eating it of the food processor right now!  It's very delicious!  I just made a few changes to my taste: added a bit more salt and doubled the cilantro (used the whole bunch)   This will go over a grilled chicken and romaine salad with tomatoes, avocados and english cucumbers.  Thanks for my new favorite - and super easy to make - salad dressing!!!

This is a wonderful dressing! I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fabulous~ my husband loved it~ it's a keeper!  I only used fresh ingredients and a local strong honey... I will use a bit less honey next time... I also used sea salt and it really brought out all the flavors. Bravo Lin!

Fantastic dressing!  Used 1/4 cup honey as suggested by others.  Here's the salad I made with it: Romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, corn, black beans, shelled edamame, sliced red and yellow baby bell peppers, sliced olives, shredded cheddar cheese, and crushed baked tortilla chips.  I also added just a bit of some Southwest Chipotle dressing to give it a little kick.  YUM!

This was a great dressing, tasted just like one we had in a Mexican restaurant.  To me, it was a little too sweet and thick with the full 1/3 cup of honey, it was better with just 1/4 cup honey.  I will definitely be making again!! Thanks for sharing!

I do not like cilantro but was looking for a light dressing to accompany a salad I was making for 20 friends we had invited over for a luau.  Only changes I made: doubled the recipe (with the exception of jalapeno, afraid it would be too hot for some... wish I would have added more since I would have liked a bit more of kick) and used ground ginger instead of fresh.  I will also add this was my FIRST time making homemade dressing.  It was wonderful.  Got several requests for the recipe!

I'm not a huge fan of cilantro...or lime for that matter, but was making this for company.  Much to my surprise, I LOVED it, and so did everyone else who tried it!  Three people asked for the recipe immediately after tasting it.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Fantastic dressing!  Lovely bright flavor and very fresh tasting!  I will decrease the amount of honey by half next time, as it was a little sweet for us, but loved this recipe!

I wish I could give this more stars!  This was THE BOMB!  I love the depths of all the flavors in this dressing.  I look forward to eating another salad just so I can eat this...is it okay to eat salad for breakfast? I will for sure make this again!

Delicious as a salad dressing!!  We love very spicy foods - so I doubled the jalapenos and left in the seeds.  I will make it a bit hotter next time and put only about 1/4 the honey.  I used 1/2 the honey and it was still a bit too sweet.  Nonetheless, it's hard to find spicy salad dressings and this was awesome!!

After having a weekend Fiesta themed birthday I found myself with extras of this and that.  My husband wanted just a salad and I suggested a Mexican version of a taco salad.  So I put everything together but then we realized we didn't have any Mexican-style dressing in the house.  My husband answered a call and 5 minutes later I came walking out with the dressing.  I went straight to allrecipes (where I knew I could find something) and found this recipe.  We had the items on hand and in no time flat I had a dressing!  He was impressed.  Not only that I found a recipe, that we had everything and that I made it so quickly.  But that it was awesome!  He LOVED it and said "It's a keeper!"  thanks to Lin and allrecipes (once again) for always having something new to impress my family with.

Great dressing.  I usually don'e make salad dressing but this sounded so good I had to try it.  I took it to a dinner party and got rave reviews. OF course the oil will sink to bottom if you leave it in the fridge too long.  I used more cilantro then it called for because my husband loves it.

Everyone loved this.  I left out the jalapeno since it was the only ingredient I didn't have and I didn't want to go to the store.  I also used only 1/8 cup of honey so it wouldn't be too sweet.

Luv it!!!   Like a lot of the reviewers, I cut the amount of olive oil and honey in half and added extra lime juice.  This is a fabulous use for all the cilantro I get from our local grower.

This is very good!  I used it on a Mexican salad recipe that I've adapted from this site with black beans, fresh corn, and red bell peppers.  I made it exactly as listed and would not change a thing.

This is a great recipie.  Since I am a sissy with peppers, I didn't add quite as much jalepeno as it said. It was great over a salad that has warm sweet pork in it. (ie my attempt to mimic Cafe Rio's sweet barbacoa salad  : )

This dressing is amazing! We make this weekly for ourselves and also make it for our guests.  Every guest leaves with a copy of the recipe.

We top the salad with London broil or chicken.

Very good dressing - I used 1 teaspoon of honey, otherwise made it as written.  I served this over a mexican salad with chopped romaine, black beans, mexican rice, crushed tortilla chips, shredded sharp cheddar and garlic marinated shrimp. Soooo delicious!  I made the whole batch and just for 2 salads we used 1/2 of it.  I will make this again!

Fantastic.  Because my son was coming to dinner and doesn't like cilantro, I substituted parsley and threw in a few fresh basil leaves.... simply divine!  I used it over a salad made of romaine, grapes, cantelope and shrimp... lovely!

Used jarred nacho slices of jalapeno, dry ginger powder, and bottled lime juice. Also, switched the lime and honey amounts.  This was so good I wanted to get a spoon and eat it like soup! I even used a poor quality olive oil so I imagine it will be even better next time with a better quality oil.

This dressing is fabulous!! I used approx. 2 tbsp less oil, and 2tbsp more lime juice, as I love the lime taste. Used on spinach salad with goat cheese, tomatoes and walnuts. Yum yum!
