This is really outstanding.  I have made it multiple times and have modified it to be slightly less rich.  I add an extra sweet potato (5 total), cut the butter to 5 T., use just 1 T. of vanilla, add an extra egg, and omit the 1 c. of pecans from the dish (I still use the 1/4 c. pecans on top).  It is great as written, but it is still really rich & flavorful with the cutbacks.

If you leave out the eggs there's no reason to put this back in the oven.  Beat the potatoes while they're hot with the other ingredients and take the dish straight to the table.  I used milk rather than cream, as it was what I had on hand.  The maple flavor really comes through!

I have been looking for a awesome sweet potato casserole recipe and I have now found it.  I think it is the maple syrup that makes this crazy good!  I did not make any changes to this recipe - it does not need any altering in my opinion!  I fixed this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it and begged me to bring it again for Christmas.

Delicious!  Substitutions were made, however.  Walnuts for pecans, milk for cream, and honey + a splash of molasses for maple syrup.  I imagine pecans and maple syrup would have made this to die for.  Oh, and I cut down the total sugar + honey to 2/3 cup, but it still came out nice and sweet.

OK, I'm a nurse and should know better than to recommend this outrageously unhealthy dish, but it tastes so  divine, not only am I recommending it but am giving it 5 stars. 

 When I served it at Thanksgiving, it got rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I left out the pecans as we have nut-haters in the family, though.

Your body won't be happy if you serve this very often but your taste buds will be very happy!

I made these for a work potluck. It turned out great just remember to not over cook the potatoes and to let them cool before shredding.

Tired of my old standby sweet potato casserole, so searched for a new one for Thanksgiving, and gave this one a whirl. Can you say awesome choice? Intense flavor of vanilla and maple made this dish a real standout on the table. Enjoyed by all, and I will continue to make this one for years to come. I used organic maple syrup from Vermont.....

This is such a wonderful recipe. I made a few minor additions. I added 2 teaspoons of maple flavor extract and I melted marshmallows on top. They did not last long at dinner. They have been requested for Christmas already. This one is a keeper!!!

A wonderful recipe...not too sweet, and delicious. I especially appreciated the hint of maple. Very nice alternative to the overly sweet stuff.

These were some of the best sweet potatoes I have ever had! They're sweet, but not overly so and the nuts add a nice texture. Will definitely be making this again!

Delicious!  I left out the pecans because we have a nut allergy in the family.  But aside from that I made no changes and thought this recipe was amazing!

I made this recipe for my first Thanksgiving. The taste was excellent but the consistency was a little questionable. I did everything exactly as written, in addition to adding 1 tsp of cardamom, inspired by another recipe on this site. I will probably reduce it to 1/2 next time. I think the problem in the consistency was because I baked it in a loaf pan (no other pans) and stirred it in the middle of cooking because I was worried about how long it was taking. Oh well. Still a great recipe!

This recipe is truly amazing. I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes but my husband is so I thought I would try this recipe out. I was surprised at how much I liked them, not to mention my husband. I cook them all the time now and they are consistently amazing.

These were delicious.  I added an extra sweet potato to thicken it up a bit.  They were simple to make and tasty.

This is delicious!!!  I substituted condensed milk for the cream (to cut down the fat and it's what I had on hand) and real maple syrup (we make our own) but followed the recipe exactly other than that.

Was wayyyy too sweet and it wouldn't harden. It tasted like maple sweet potato syrup. It tastes even MORE sweet after it cools down. Tried it twice. Not doing it again.

Let me just add to the many great reviews this recipe has received! It's beyond delicious. Tastes to me like pumpkin pie filling, only better. I'm thinking of having it for dessert. It doesn't even need a dollop of whipped cream, since the cream is inside!
I used yams, which are the red-skinned variety. Sweet potatoes are light tan on the outside, and are not as sweet as yams. Following the advice of previous reviewers, I made a few changes to lighten it up a bit. It is still not healthy by any stretch of the imagination. Used 5T butter, increased sweet potatoes to 5 and eggs to 3, cut brown sugar to 1/4 cup, used only 1T vanilla, omitted the pecans in the dish (still used the ones on top) and omitted the maple syrup drizzle on top. Also used light maple-flavored syrup. My husband has demanded we not lose this recipe! Thanks JENNYWRITES!

The pecans and maple syrup really add a nice touch to basic mashed sweet potatoes. I thought that adding the brown sugar would be too sweet being that the maple syrup & sweet potatoes are sweet enough, so I made it without. Then realized it needed that extra touch of sweetness, added the brown sugar and it was just right! This recipe was such a hit at thanksgiving! Everybody went back for seconds and ate all the left overs. thumbs up!!

Made this for Easter and it was a hit!  I will definitely make this again.  I made it one day ahead, covered and refrigerated it overnight.  The next morning I let it warm up on the counter for a couple hours, then baked it as directed.  Delicious!!

Absolutely fabulous. A tad bit too sweet, Leave out the brown sugar. Can be made the day before, baked the morning of (for an early dinner), put a lid on it and a few towels to keep it warm. Less food to juggle. Permanently added to the Christmas & Thanksgiving menus!

I made this for my fiancee before we started dating...I think I hooked him on this little number- paired with blue cheese and bacon stuffed tenderloin (marinated in merlot) and steamed snow peas.  This is the best sweet potato recipe I have ever had.

I used 2/3 cup of cream and it turned out fabulous.  I make this for dessert sometimes.

This was wonderful!! My husband hates sweet potatoes but he loved this. It was super easy to make...after baking the potatoes the skin just falls off. It was sweet but not overpowering. I make this with Caramel Apple Porkcops also on allrecipes and it is a new favorite. I used regular pancake syrup and it tasted great.

Good picture.  We made this last Thanksgiving and it is definitely going to be made again.  I think it is going to have be an every year item because everyone asks for it.  Easy and good!

This was a hit.  For people who rated it low because it does not "harden" - it won't because there is too much liquid in it, but it is delicious. Did a few things a tiny bit different: used an extra sweet potato, did not pack the brown sugar, only used about 1/3 c of syrup, and didn't add nuts and syrup on top.  Was a great addition to the Christmas buffet - my dad's favorite dish!

I have one that doesn’t like pecans, so I didn’t use the pecans inside, and only sprinkled on them on half of the top. I will definitely be making this again. Oh, and instead of brown sugar, I used Brown Swerve.

Had to change this a bit because of lack of ingredients on hand, instead of one cup of heavy cream used 5oz of evaporated milk. Used macadamia nuts instead of pecans. Didn’t use salt because nuts were salted. And this turned out amazing. My guests loved the way thus turned out. It was worth the time & effort.

Didn't have any nuts, so did without.  Took longer in oven , I just baked until no longer 'jiggly'.
We ended up having seconds ( and thirds!),  AND his mother asked for recipe!

I didn't put marshmallows on top like in the picture. I think that would be too sweet.

Wonderful!  I never added the butter (by accident) and it was fabulous!  The combination of the maple syrup and vanilla made it so delicious that I never even missed it!

If you want to guarantee that everyone in your family has a full belly just make these.  I made them last year and they are AMAZING! Almost as good as sex they are so darn good!  This year I will boil sweet potatoes though as they took way longer to bake in the oven than the directions call for.  Also, peeling them after they were baked was a huge mess. Totally worth it, though.  This year I will peel, cut, boil the potatoes to cook em. This recipe is AMAZING!
