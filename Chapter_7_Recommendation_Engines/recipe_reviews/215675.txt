Having European parents, I grew up eating lots of German food. I'm not the biggest fan, particularly when it comes to any type of sausage but I just tasted this and it's absolutely delicious! I didn't have kielbasa in the house so I subbed with bratwurst and added some caraway seeds to the mix. Cooking wise, I did brown my wurst first and then added my potatoes and the rest of the ingredients. No layering here, just threw it all together.  The combination of flavors is everything one would expect from a good German dish and I know this will definitely go down as a family favorite. Thank you DJ!

I liked this quite a bit, but my husband was less fond of it. I do have to admit that we used vegetarian faux kielbasa (my husband is a vegetarian), and that provided most of the flavor, so using real kielbasa would almost certainly make some sort of difference.  I will certainly try this again using real kielbasa for myself, but I think I'll only use half of a cabbage. I got the smallest cabbage I could find at the store, but it was still too much for me personally. I love onion, though, so I'll use a whole one next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a decent meal. I always like the combo of beer and kielbasa!  I only used about 1/3 of a head of cabbage, and it was more than enough.

Very good. I added 1 tsp of minced garlic. In the place of reg. salt I used seasoned salt and garlic salt. I used only 1 tsp of italian seasoning. I also used 2 bottles of beer.

This was really good. I used coors light, and it worked just fine. Also I replaced the italian seasoning with just plain old sweet basil. I really like cabbage, so I may just boil cabbage alone next time in a bottle of beer!

I thought this was really good. I threw in a little celery to make up for the carrots I was lacking. Also, I sauteed the kielbasa chunks until slightly charred and threw in a splash of chardonnay just for the hell of it. I layered as described in the recipe and did not stir. Also, I do not like the after taste of Italian seasoning so I threw in seasoned salt rather than regular, some parsley and some basil. Yes, I know I changed it....All recipes are a great place to start and make it your own.

This dish was okay.  My husband is a cabbage fan and just said this was okay – not wonderful.  He didn’t really like the Italian seasoning.  My son loved the kielbasa and potatoes.  Kielbasa always tastes good cooked in beer, and the vegetables were good cooked in the beer too.  But I think the onion would be better in large chunks instead of chopped.  I doubled the carrots, onion and red potatoes and thought it didn’t look like enough beer in the pot, so I added another bottle.  But in the end, I think one bottle would have been fine because even the cabbage (only half covered in the beer) cooked up great with the lid on the pot.  I did not layer the ingredients; I just mixed everything together except for the cabbage which I was trying to keep in the quartered chunks.

This was a big hit with my family. I was worried because I don't like the taste of beer, but the flavor combination was great. My picky eaters did not eat one item (carrots for one, onions for the other), but that did not deter them from enjoying the rest of the dish. I doubled the recipe, and the only problem I had (due to doubling) was the cabbage took longer to cook.

This was really easy to follow and it turned out better than I expected.  I used garlic salt and pepper instead of just salt and pepper and I had to use two bottle of beer because I had a larger pot I was working with.  I went with chopped carrots also that was different than the directions.  My total for the meal came to 6.75 and it fed two adults, and three toddlers.  And there's enough for lunch tomorrow for myself and two toddlers.  Great recipe and great savings!

Very good recipe! The cabbage kinda stunk up my house but it was worth it. I live in Texas so I used Shiner Bock for the beer. Turned out really well. My husband thought it was missing something so he added horse radish. It gave it that extra little kick that it seemed to be missing. I will make it again but I will probably put a thin layer of horse radish over the cabbage next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I only had Italian sausage links on hand and browned them in the pot first. I took them out and then  I added a little chicken bouillon to the beer and omitted the potatoes and basil.  I couldn't put basil flavor together in my head with this combo.  I was thinking more Oktoberfest-fest.  Everything went back in the boiling liquid and I sprinkled garlic powder and onion powder to the mix.  I did lay the cabbage wedges on top and seasoned again. Put the lid on and simmered as directed. Yummy served with pierogis and applesauce on the side.

The key to this is to used a spicy sausage.  The first time I served it I used turkey polska kilbasa and my family didn't like it at all.  I added some spicy sausage and it became a hit!

We really enjoyed this recipe! Easy and tasty. We are vegan, so we subbed No Evil Foods' Italian sausage, The Stallion, for the sausage in the recipe and loved it! We also were able to use our own cabbage, carrots, potatoes and herbs from the garden. :-)

Much to my kids dismay we will definitely be having this again.lol I did brown my keilbasa first and I used yuengling lager. I didn't really layer just threw it in the pot I do think enext time I would break up the cabbage a little. Over all it was exactly what I expected.

This was a hit! I made a couple of adjustments. Layered in the crockpot and cooked on high for 3 1/2-4 hours. Used garlic salt, russet potatoes (peeled and thickly sliced), and Brussels sprouts instead of cabbage ( should've halved). The sausage was half turkey smoked sausage and half hatch green chile smoked sausage. With the exception of the garlic salt and cooking method, the adjustments were because it's what I had on hand. I'm sure the recipe would've been just as good as written.

Made this last night. It was easy and the flavor was awesome. Just used Budweiser because that's what we had. I added a little malt vinegar at the end. I would make it again!

Really good! Had to stir it up and cook for an extra 10 mins to get the cabbage to not be crunchy, but ther than that, really easy, delicious recipe. And it is important to make sure the potatoes are on the bottom. They need to soak up that wonderful beer and it makes them sooo tender!

I used a 12 oz German Pilsner and it was enough liquid to cook everything.  If you cover the pot, the rest gets steamed from the simmering beer.  Great meal.

We loved this! I didn't expect to like it, but hubby really wanted to try it and I was surprised at how great it was! The only change I made, was I added one crushed chicken bouillon cube to the beer. Thanks for the great recipe! I'll be making this often.

I was going to make this recipe as written, but I did not have any beer or cabbage at home. I added some vegetable broth instead of the beer. For the cabbage I substituted a can of Sauerkraut (including the juice) and added some Caraway Seeds to it instead of the Italian Seasoning.

This I've made 2x and trying my 3rd but each time it has been fantastic, I did have to cut the cabbage smaller and move it down half way through the cooking because the cabbage was not cooking.

I have made this three times slightly experimenting. The first time was as written but I didn't have beer and used chicken stock; it was good. Second time I made it as written but with a hoppy dark beer; we did not like the strong after-taste of the hoppy beer. Third time was PERFECT. Used an american cheap beer and the taste was EXCELLENT. The only other change I made was cutting the potatoes smaller and putting them on the top so they steamed and did not get mushy. I also made this in the oven instead of the stovetop. I bought a 24 oz beer, used 12 ounces for this and 12 ounces for beer bread. Both finish in a 375 degree oven in 50 minutes. My Polish partner LOVED this and we will put it in our monthly rotation (a high honor at our house).

Second time making it and the whole family loves it - side of crusty bread and butter for dipping in juice is mandatory!  Great, simple recipe full of fall goodness!

I really enjoyed this.  I searched on recipes with sausage and cabbage and found this one (as I had sausage and cabbage and not much else in the fridge).  I didn't have an onion, but I did have a leek, so I used that.  And I only had some partially cooked frozen potato in the freezer, so threw those in too. 

I should have read all the reviews first, because I just didn't think 1 bottle was enough, it probably was.  But I used 2 bottles of Stella Artois, has a nice flavor.  I'll for sure make this again!  Thank you!

So easy and extremely good! I use slightly less of the seasonings than the recipe calls for. Leftovers are even better.

I replaced the kielbasa with bratwurst and the onion with leek, but the result was amazing and probably would have worked just as well in the original form. People who don't normally do onions or leeks were raving about the recipe, and I have requests to do it again.

Used Sam Adams Boston Lager (regular Sam's). It had a bitter flavor throughout. Followed the recipe completely in a dutch oven and took almost an hour longer to cook through. I'll try again with Bud or something else very light, and re-visit this review.

I used Samuel Adams' Cold Snap, browned Italian sausage, yellow potatoes, red cabbage, and a sweet onion with carrots and celery. After this was finished cooking, put all of it into a serving dish and thickened the broth to pour over. Very good!

Sorry but I did not like it.  I used an amber ale beer and I wonder if that was the problem.  I will not make it again.

I loved this dish, I have to say the Italian seasoning just didn't sound right so I left it out completely. I did use the salt and pepper and added Mrs. Dash with Garlic.  YUM!  I used a bottle of Blue Moon for the beer.   I read other reviews and used only half of a small cabbage and it was plenty for the two of us and enough for lunch the next day. Also based on other reviews I just put all the ingredients in one big plop.  My husband loved it and said we need to have this more often.  Winner Winner Sausage dinner. :D

Hubby, daughter-in-law and I liked it , however little ones didn't care for it. Adjusted recipe for six people and it called for 1lb of sausage which wasn't enough. I recommend even for 4 people to use 2 lbs of sausage. I also added stir-fry vegetables to it because potatoes, carrots and cabbage wasn't enough for us.

My husband and I thought it was worth the effort.  It was a terrific dinner and it's a keeper.  Great meal when you are short on time.  Next time we are going to add 1/2 lb extra of keilbasa.  We ate it with Dijon mustard and crunchy bread.
Loved it.

Wonderful.  Took some advice from other posters and added 2 tbs horseradish, then added celery salt and onion powder.  Will definitely make again.  Used Moosehead lager. I was shocked that this didn't require any other liquid other than the bottle of beer.

Absolutely delicious!  Made only a few small changes due to what I had in the house.  Didn't have any cabbage so I had to omit it (sadly!).  Also, cooked in a skillet rather than a pot.  Had to add about 10 minutes to cook time to make sure the carrots cooked completely.  Will definitely make this again.  Used Yuengling Lager for this round, would like to try something darker next time.

My fiance and I LOVED this! Used a bottle of Yuengling for the beer, left out the salt since the kielbasa already has enough. I used about half a head of cabbage. Everything turned out perfectly. Give this recipe a try, wonderful comfort food!

I didn’t see any other reviews mentioning this, but my veggies were NOT cooked after 45 minutes simmering. The potatoes were still basically raw. If I’d let this simmer at low heat it would have taken 2-3 hours, and at that point I may as well have put it in the slow cooker. Tasted good but the cooking instructions need work.

Good, I added a lot of spices and it was really good. Most recipes don’t have enough flavor for us so I add a lot of spices from my cupboard and my herb garden.

It was good. I used Dos Equis Lager. I added 1 bell pepper to this recipe. I think something was missing. If I were to make again, I think I would add sauerkraut. It could use a sour, tangy element.

Love the flavors in this recipe. I live in Texas and my go to beer is Shiner Bock. I also used Opa's Country Style Sausage, another Texas favorite. Hearty soup that will stick to your ribs.

Great recipe and very tasty.  Made as directed but added some caraway seeds.
