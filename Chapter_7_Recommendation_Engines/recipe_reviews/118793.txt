Yum!!  We used this recipe for canning, and it worked great... very quick and easy.  We added a little more sugar to the second batch, but the overall recipe is terrific!

This turned out wonderfully! I doubled this and used just a tbsp. of lemon juice to tart it up just a little, instead of doubling it. The smell of the peaches cooking is just divine. This will make a wonderful gift for Christmas. EDITED: BTW, this doubled filled four and a half small Ball jars.

This is a very good recipe. I have been hunting for a starting point for peach jam. My suggestion is to add a little detail to the recipe instructions. Specifically, I used really tiny peaches, so 7 wouldn't work of me.

Yum- thanks for this. We were using up fresh peaches from our tree.  I used splenda in lieu of sugar and threw it in the fridge for an easy waffle/pancake/toast spread.  Delish!  Thanks!

I think this would've been better with fruit pectin.  The gelatin made it resemble jello, but it tastes great.  Not overly sweet like what you find at grocery stores, and the peach flavor really comes through.  I split up my batch in tupperware containers and froze the extra.

Love this!  Very, very simple recipe to do.  My 4 y/o daughter made it with me.  It turned out great!  I didn't mash our peaches to mush because I wanted our jam chunky.  Turned out great!

This is OK.  I agree with another reviewer - too much gelatin.  I guess you could try using less gelatin to see if that makes a difference.  Overall, it will be used but I wouldn't make this again without making changes.

This spread is delicious.  I ate it on or with just about everything for 2 weeks straight!  I had to cook mine almost twice as long as the recipe says, but that's my only "complaint."  The flavor is wonderful.

While I enjoy the fresh peach flavors, the gelatinous consistency is not very appealing. It reminds me of gravy that has cooled...it's just weird. I will try another recipe next time.
