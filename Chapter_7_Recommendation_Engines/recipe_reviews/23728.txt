Good....but not great.  I did add some seasonings...and rosemary as another reviewer suggested...it does taste a bit bland.  I will try to spice this one up a bit.   Thanks for the post.

My entire family loved this recipe.  I have Celiac's disease, so I used a gluten-free flour mix instead of all-purpose flour.  I also used bouillon cubes in boiling water instead of chicken broth (since store-bought chicken broth has gluten).  It turned out delicious!

Very delicious and easy to make.  The only thing I would cut back on would be the onions, I found that using 3 onions made my 9X13 pan overflow.

Try adding a little salt and pepper to the chicken.  That should help bring out more flavor.  Salt is the kind of chemical that enhances any flavor.       That's the reason it is used in baking.  Great recipe!

After I cooked the chicken in the oil and before I threw in the onions and mushrooms, I drained out most of the oil left in the frying pan, except for the drippings and a tiny bit of oil. The directions didn't say whether to do that or not, but I didn't want oily sauce. It worked out great. This is a really good recipe! Served with mashed potatoes. Yummmm

The addition of Mozarella is delicious, but chicken is missing something.  Maybe a good marinade of some sort.

My whole family loves this!! Like others, I use less or no onion and more mushrooms. I also like to thicken the sauce as we serve angel hair pasta with it and a loaf of crusty bread. Excellent!!

Good flavor, but nothing but runny broth. No idea what the other reviewers are referring to when they mention "sauce".

Yum! Cooked how the recipe stated but probably didn't use a correct creole seasoning, I used regular seasoning that I made for fried chicken & this came out great. We love our onions & mushrooms, so it didn't seem like to much. Great marsala flavors mixed with the melted cheeses was a great flavor profile. Will make again :)

Oops! I forgot to put the mozzerella on at the end; cooking with wine doesn't mean just using it in the recipe! But, the sauce was fantastic and the chicken very flavorful. I didn't have any cajun seasoning on hand so I used McCormick 1 step lemon herb seasoning. A very easy recipe and a lot of fun to make!

I made this last night and my husband and daughter really enjoyed it.  I only put 2 onions in and it was more than enough.  My daughter is gluten free so I used gluten free flour, but you would never know the difference.

I made this for dinner with friends.  I followed the recipe, but added salt and pepper to the chicken as it browned, and put a few sprigs of fresh rosemary on top of the chicken before the cheese.  It was tender and tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

My family loved this!  We love mushrooms, so I used a little more (6 oz. pkg shitake), and only used about 3/4 chopped onion, because that's all I had on hand. I made it with 4 thin chicken breasts and 3 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and there was plenty of sauce to go around! Served it with roasted potatoes and vegetables. Very tasty!

My family loves this dish.  I am gluten free so I use g-free flour instead.  I also used Old Bay instead of Creole seasoning because I had it on hand and a cayenne pepper to replace the Creole seasoning spice.

I have to give this three stars because I did change a lot of the steps and ingredients. I didn't have any Marsala so I used a white wine, instead of three onions I only used a cup, and I used baby Bella mushrooms. I served with mashed potatoes instead of pasta and DEFIANTLY let the onions and mushrooms cook for more than 10 minutes to soften and get delicious. This was a knockout for my family, we all loved it and wished there were seconds. We will defiantly make this again!
