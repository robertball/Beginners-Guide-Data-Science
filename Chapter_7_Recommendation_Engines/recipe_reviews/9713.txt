I went looking specifically for a fudge brownie recipe, and this one interested me because of the pecans.
I made a double batch to take to a party, and it was a big hit.
The thing is, I made a mistake, in melting all of the chocolate, instead of leaving the semi-sweet into chunks, but that was probably a "great" mistake, as this turned out to be the best and fudgiest brownies I've ever had!!!

Ah, the quest for the perfect brownie!  Admit it, it's never-ending among serious chocoholics, now isn't it? 
This recipe gets a 5 star rating from me because the end product smelled fantastic coming out of the oven; it had a crackly top (just the way I like it); it made a nice, thick brownie; and best of all it was chocolatey, fudgey, through and through.
I threw in some hazelnuts and white chocolate bits that I had leftover from another recipe and was pleased with the result.

Really nice recipe! I made it as-is the first time through, except with chocolate chips as I was out of block chocolate, and it was really good.  The second time through, I decided to deepen the chocolate flavor a bit, and added 1/3 cup cocoa powder to the flour.  It was sensational. Thanks for a keeper!!

I am only giving this recipe 4 stars because of the bitter flavor that the brownies have. I made them following the recipe exactly. The brownies were fudgy and chewy like promised but the over powering bitter taste of the unsweetened chocolate ruined them for me. I will make them again but next time I will use less (or no) unsweetened chocolate. Thanks for the recipe, once I get the ratio of chocolates down this will be a keeper!!

These turned out alright for me. The only problem was the oven time. It needed a lot longer to cook.

I have searched high and low for the perfect brownie recipe and this is definitely it.  Absolutely perfect!  I used all semi-sweet chocolate squares.  Well done, I need search no more!

This was very good, I am definitely more of a fudge brownie person. I used walnuts instead as my husband doesn't care for pecans. I also took the other reviewers suggestions to add cocoa, although it probably isn't necessary. I live in Denver so the cooking time is at least 8+ minutes longer, and even then it required a fork. I might tweak this a bit to work for high altitude, but other than that a very good simple recipe!

I made a few alterations to this recipe, but the brownies still turned out great.  I didn't have pecans, so I substituted walnuts.  I halved the sugar (which I always do with dessert recipes whenever possible) and put 1/2 the semi-sweet chocolate called for.  I also mixed cocoa in the unsweetened chocolate/butter mixture to give it a richer chocolatey taste.  Mmm, mmm, good!

My young guests were floored with these brownies. I omitted nuts and sprinkled with confectioners sugar. Baked in reynolds aluminum star shaped cups and muffin cups.

Great recipe! I won first place in the local fair with these! I would suggest doing something to make them less bitter though. Maybe cut out the unsweetened chocolate and sub for cocoa or chocolate chips, or maybe more semi-sweet chocolate.

These are, as my hubby put it, "the best brownies I've ever eaten!"  So good, chewy and fudgy, and SUPER easy.   I used semi-sweet chocolate chips (Ghiradelli) instead of choc squares bc that's what I had on hand, so about 1/3 cup melted with the butter and about 2/3 cup mixed in with batter.  Baking time was exactly 25min for my oven.  Soooo good, thanks Belinda!

Maybe I didn't make them right but for some reason they did not come out as I expected. You could barely taste the chocolate at all and were more of a very light brown color on the top. Will try adding more chocolate squares next time. The fudge consistency was absolutely perfect though. Very soft and chewy....not cakey at all.

We loved these brownies!  I omitted pecans b/c we don't care for nuts in our brownies.  Also, I only had 2 oz. of semi-sweet chips so I had to use the other 2 oz. as white chocolate!  Delicious!  If you like a fudgey, rich brownie try this one!

the whole fam loved these.  and they were relatively simply... ty for sharing such a great recipe,  I do change the chocolate ballance by melting both types of choc and then adding milkchoc chips.  i also use about 2 tables spoons ish of cocopowder.  i don't like pecans in brownies much so i add choped walnuts.  once again a double batch didn't servive a family dinner.  it is a great recipe and verry easy.  have fun and enjoy...  ps. if i could i would give it more stars. :)

Also, these brownies were flat but served with homemade ice cream and became a hit. I would not make again. If I did I would have to add baking powder/soda. Also, to mask the flatness I added small squares of chocolate to the top and it melted perfectly. Lot's of chocolate!

These are awesome!  I followed others idea of adding cocoa, I added 2 T cocoa to the flour mixture, then added 2/3 cup dark chocolate chips as I didn't have any semisweet chocolate.  Loved them, chewy, soft and delicious!

I am a brownie fanatic, and love to cook and bake. I have tried many different brownie recipes, and for a solid chocolate brownie, this is by far the absolute BEST I have ever tried. I have good willpower when it comes to sweets, but not with these. I literally eat a whole "strip" at a time. Warm with Freench Vanilla ice cream on top...too yummy for words:-)

These brownies turned out nice and chewy and rich. Next time I probably won't use as much unsweetened chocolate or maybe none at all. I didn't mind them being not so sweet but my BF prefers them to be sweeter. I also added some cocoa powder like a lot of other people suggested.

I alter this a bit but its wonderful either way. I skip the nuts and make it with dark chocolate chips. Then i use 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c virgin coconut oil, it has a mild sweet coconut flavor. I also use baking coco instead of the squares. You just follow the directions on the container to make it equal the 2 oz unsweetened chocalate. Needless to say these are always a huge hit.

The batter was very light and they were not fudgey at all. I did use semi sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened choc. squares. But my husband thought they were good despite not being fudgey.

I was hoping this would end my search for a great brownie... They came out flat! In the recipe there was no mention of any baking powder or soda... The flavor was OK but the texture was not that of a chewy brownie.

These brownies are tasty, but I didn't find them to be at all fudgey.  (Perhaps I did something wrong...)  I made the mistake of placing the batter in mini muffin cups; not having any oil in them, the brownies came out very dry and cake-like and it was impossible to peel the paper away from them.  I prefer gooey brownies, so this recipe was not ideal for me.  But it's good if you like more cake-like brownies!

These are super fudgy, like eating straight brownie batter. That's not a bad thing, but I'd like more "chewiness" to my brownies. I think baking powder to raise them a bit would help. I used dark chocolate instead of unsweetened, and I thought the sweetness was just right.
