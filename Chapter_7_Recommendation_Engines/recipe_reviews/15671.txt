I'm not a fan of rum but these are superb! You will make about three batches of rum balls with the white cake that you have to bake. I also used more white cake crumbs than the recipe calls for (about two cups each batch). I had more luck (less mess) when I let the dough sit in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes before I rolled them into balls. I rolled mine in chocolate jimmies, cocoa, coconut, crushed candy canes. So easy and  very tasty

These are a hit every time I make them although I do typically vary the recipe slightly by taste or by occasion...I've made these with pumpkin, chocolate, carrot, you name it cake and decorated them just as many different ways. Thank you for a great base recipe its def. a keeper :)

We loved these! I've made a few different rum ball recipes but i think this will be the one i stick with from now on. The only thing i changed was to use butter cake instead of white and i added a little cocoa powder. They were wonderful!

These are the BEST Rum Balls. I did add more rum so I needed to add more cake and chocolate. Very yummy!

I used day old doughnuts instead of cake and left out the nuts.  I relized I forgot to get cream so I used the egg nog in the fridge.  Also, I added a little bit of cocoa powered to the mix to even out the color.  It's pretty good, everyone liked them.

i'm sure it was somehow operator error- but I wound up with very soggy, wet rum balls that didn't even really taste all that good. I even added extra cake crumbs thinking it would dry it up, but no. A total waste of ingredients.

Good recipe worked pretty well, used more chocolate, chocolate cake and put a marshmellow in the centre! Really yummy!

I have always used vanilla wafers to make my rum balls, but I didn't have any so I tried this recipe. It turned out pretty well! I highly suggest adding the rum to taste, in case you want more rum flavor, and then add the cream a little at a time for the correct consistency. I used condensed milk because I didn't have heavy cream, and I also added some unsweetened cocoa powder for more chocolate flavor. 1 cake makes about 3 batches of this recipe, so I had some to play with. I made one batch substituting pumpkin for the chocolate and bourbon for the rum. I rolled the balls in coconut. YUM!!!

Didn't buy enough chocolate sprinkles to decorate rum balls; so mixed in additional ground almonds.  This made them look even more festive.  Everyone loved this recipe.

These were good, but I agree with the other reviews that I probably needed 2 bottles of chocolate jimmies and the mix was a little dry, so I added a tablespoon more rum for additional flavor and moisture. Good and not difficult though!

I am an excellent baker and I found this recipe to be terrible.   I always follow the directions as written the first time unless multiple reviews agree on a change.  The texture was mush even adding more cake.  I will search for a better recipe.

The alcohol oozed out of them in container and turned coating to mush such as crushed candy canes and jimmy sprinkles.
