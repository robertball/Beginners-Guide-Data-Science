I thought this was a great soup.  I added dumplings to it to make it even heartier.  Next time I will probably omit the spinach and add dumplings, celery and potatoes.  I also found that I had to add some salt to it as well.

I thought this soup was really bland. It was like a really bland minestrone. I added a can of white beans and substituted chicken broth for the water. It was quick and easy to throw together, but I think it needs more flavor.

This soup was so quick & easy to make. Perfect for a week night dinner! I added a little extra chicken bouillon for some more flavor.

My boyfriend loved this recipe, and he never comments on food.  I thought it was good, and I especially liked the spinach.

I omitted the spinash (not a big fan) and added corn and green beans instead. It tasted great. Just like Campbell's soup but better.

Made as recipe listed, ... just too sweet for me between the tomato juice and the carrots. This was tasty when I added a lot of salt and fresh pepper

I substituted chicken broth for the water and also sautéed diced celery along with the chicken and onions. I served it with grated Parmesan on top.  I might add a few more green veggies with it next time.

I have made this soup several times and the family loves it. I use a little less water and add a little salt and pepper. Whatever is left  I freeze for later. I ate this soup for a week straight everyday for every meal and lost 10 pounds.

Very good soup.  And my husband agreed. He is not a fan of a totally vegetable soup, but liked this one with chicken.  I had some rotisserie chicken from Costco, so I used that. Thanks to other reviews I added bullion and a can of white beans.  And used V-8 juice as per the recipe.  We did not find too tomato-y.  This is a keeper

I needed this recipe to use up the leftover deep fried, Cajun spice injected, turkey breast and leg portion that had been in my freezer for 10 months.  I also read the reviews so added 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp ground black pepper.  Also as I didn't have any tomato juice I made up the 8 cups of liquid with a 4 cup box of organic vegetable broth, a leftover cup of canned chicken broth then added some pre-made up Tomato Purée (from a can of Italian Basil Tomato Paste) as well as a can of tomato sauce, then maybe a cup of tap water. The final change, as my wife is gluten sensitive, was to use GF corn based Tubetti Rigati by Pasta d'oro. The chopped Spinach added the needed vegetable for nutritional balance. The result was wonderful.

I made this the other day and made some changes. I'm vegetarian so I used vegetable broth and I found some chicken substitute and didn't use the spinach. I tried it and thought that it was too much Italian Seasoning, I would reduce it by half. I'm not much of a soup person and I personally didn't like this so much, but that's but because of the recipe. I did have fun making it though!
