I tried this drink and really liked it but way too sweet for me. Instead of using the condensed milk, I used regular whole milk...loved it.

Thanks for the recipe! I haven't had tea like this since I was in Japan, the taste is pretty much exactly the same, and brings back some great memories. I'm not much for sweet drinks so I used whole milk, and added honey, tasted, added, etc. until I was happy with it.

Loved this tea. I used a Ceylon black tea instead of the standard Orange pekoe. Very nice way to use some of an opened can of sweetened condensed milk. I most definitely will make this again. Thanks Tao for submitting this.

Perfect for my no-good-very-bad-day. I used fat free sweetened condensed milk but I made no other changes. Using the martini shaker, smart idea! That was the coolest idea. Really. Excellent milk tea. I'd like to try this with fat free half-n-half next time and see if it's just as good.

I had all the ingredients on hand so I decided to make this. It is very soothing and delicious. It reminds me of the bubble tea I have had at the Mall but minus the bubbles!

Thank you so much for posting this! I absolutely love milk tea! It was delicious - I halved the condensed milk and the honey, but I think it was still a tad to sweet. Then again, I always like things a little less sweet.

Sweet enough, and strong enough that when your ice cubes melt, you'll never notice a change in flavor!

I enjoyed this very much. I remember having it as a child when we were stationed in Guam. My parents had been in stationed in Japan and I remember my mom making this for me. It was lightly sweet and still had a nice little kick flavor of tea. Nicely done Tao. I know can't wait to make this for my kids. I did use decaf tea for that is all I use. And it was wonderful. Thanks so much.

Tasted great--my family loved it.  I'm not even sure I got the proportions right because I was in such a hurry, but I'll definitely try it again.

This tea makes me so nostalgic! I didn't have ice ready, so I served the tea hot instead. I also substituted condense milk with evaporated milk (condense milk is too sweet), and I used English black tea instead of orange pekoe. Usually recipes call for sugar, so the honey was a great addition.   I will definitely make it again. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it immensely. Thank you for the recipe!

Wow, it was better than what I had expected.  Perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness.  An excellent formula.  I used the exact recipe and directions. I made enough to fill my pitcher.  Tonight I am cooking Asian.  Thanks for sharing.

Definitely too sweet, but a good jumping off point. I had 1 mug as per recipe, but modified my 2nd mug by skipping the honey, putting 3 teaspoons sweetened condensed milk rather than 4, and topping it off with 2% milk to make up for the creaminess the 4th teaspoon would have added.

I guess orange pekoe tea is just a medium grade black tea, but I thought it meant orange spice black tea. It's good with either! I used the full amount of honey and sweetened condensed milk.

Excellent tea!! thank you for sharing. For those who had a tough time finding Pekoe tea, it is found under the Lipton brand in Asian supermarkets. I added boba to the tea and it tastes even better than what I can buy at the tea shops!!

I had to play around a bit with the amounts of ingredients. The ones given were way to sweet! I found if you put less condensed milk, then it's pretty good.

I really enjoyed this drink. I used sweetened condensed milk, but am anxious to try with regular milk, as suggested by other reviewers. I used black tea bags as opposed to orange pekoe tea bags, as that's all I had!

Very good if a bit too sugary. This doesn't make very much however, and I made this for my class, so I had to make this recipe x 8. For one person I would recommend maybe making two servings.

At first I wasn't sure if I liked this so much but it grew on me.  I made a lot so there was leftovers.  I enjoyed it more the next day after being refrigerated for a day.  I don't know if I was more in the mood for it or it actually got better sitting there but I did like it quite a bit the second day.

I could not find the pekoe tea so instead, I just got a random black tea. The black tea was not strong enough, I was so disappointed. However, an idea came to me. I boiled the tea leaves in water for a while, then I left it on med-low heat for half an hour. The taste of the black tea was so much stronger. It made a huge difference! Then I added all the other ingredients and it was perfect. It really reminded me of the milk tea I had in Hong Kong. Thanks for sharing the ingredient!!

I didn't have Orange Pekoe tea, but I tried it with some vanilla macaron tea, it worked out wonderfully.

**Edit: After finishing my first tea and going to clean out my cocktail shaker, I realized that a lot of the honey solidified and never made its way into the drink! Since then, I've made the drink a bit differently, adding the honey (2 tsp max) and the sweetened condensed milk to the shaker, then the (warm) tea. Mix that up, then add the ice and shake to chill. Now I do see what the other reviewers were saying about the sweetness. 2 tsp honey is enough for me.

Original post: I thought this was excellent! I'm surprised that many of the reviews say this is too sweet as I actually think the sweetness is quite understated. We happened to have some lychee coconut jelly on hand as well as some of those big straws, so I cut some up and added it in.

This is an excellent drink. It almost tastes like that orange cream candy.

I love sweet stuff so this sounded like a good recipe.  FAT FREE SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK ruined it

Deffinately didn't turn out as I expected. I thought the honey was a little overpowering and the sweetened condensed milk was a bit much. But I think with a little tweeking, I can find something that suits my taste.

My boyfriend and I love honey milk tea. He likes his mild and I like mine sweet. For his, I used less sweetened condensed milk and a larger amount of water and tea. He said the flavor was just like the tea he used to have with his friends in China.

First I tried just the honey and tea, which was too sweet for me; then I tried just the sweetened condensed milk and tea which was still a little too much, so I used a tablespoon of sweetened condensed per cup of tea. Still not quite like the delicious stuff from a shop, but pretty doggone good!  :)
