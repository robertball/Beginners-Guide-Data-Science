What a simple wonderful recipe. It was a favorite at the party I was catering for and definitely chosen to be repeated when I cook for family and friends on Xmas Eve. It does not specify what type of onions to use but I figured Red was the perfect flavor to better the recipe.

It's a rare occasion indeed when Hubs rates any recipe 5-stars and he did on this occasion.  So do I.  It was an interesting and unique change to have a cheesy potato dish that wasn't in a cheesy sauce.  And the lemon/rosemary flavors gave this such character and such distinction from other, similar, potato dishes!  Beautiful to look at and just as good to eat.   I baked this in an au gratin dish which made it particularly stunning.

These are great and easy! The only change I made was to reduce the cheese from 2 cups to about 1 1/2 cups. I found them to be extra yummy with tabasco sprinkled on top once on my plate, but that of course is just a personal preference. Will make again, and maybe add some parmesan or bacon bits next time just to experiment.

These are amazing.  I didn't have lemon so I didn't use that, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Made sure to all plenty of salt after reading other reviews and they turned out so good.

Nice, simple recipe. Too much butter for the amount of bread crumbs, and not enough topping to cover. Does need a little salt. It was good, but I like the Cheesy ranch ones better. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, what's not to like about this recipe?  Cheese, rosemary, potatoes - yum!  We thought these were delicious!  I chopped up 2 sprigs of rosemary, putting one in the potato mixture and one in the topping.  I also used only 1/2 tsp. seasoned salt and since I was running low on cheddar cheese, I replaced some of it with parmesan cheese.  This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious, and very forgiving. I had to change my oven temperature for another recipe and they turned out just fine. I used fresh Rosemary instead of dried, since I have it growing in my kitchen. I loved the hint of lemon zest - it really brightened the flavor and worked well with the Rosemary.

Made the recipe exactly as directed.  The bread crumbs were nearly to the burnt black stage by the end of the suggested cooking time.  My potatoes were almost overdone.  There was no rosemary taste in the potatoes and they needed additional salt.   I will probably make this again but with some major adjustments.  UPDATE Made this a second time but halved the recipe because I only had 2 potatoes.  I reduced the uncovered portion of the baking time to 10 minutes and the texture was much better.  Not so overcooked.  Still not much rosemary taste.  I think it needs to be sprinkled on each layer too.  But it was good and not burnt this time.

The potatoes were good, but I wasn't super excited by them. They need more salt.

Expected more flavor from these potatoes, but they still were good.  Presentation was very nice, but the flavor just did not really jump out, pretty mild.  If you have a bold-flavor entree, this might be the side dish for you.  I was just a little bit disappointed, but it's still a four-star recipe.

I made these tonight as a side dish to a prime rib.  I actually cooked a couple slices of bacon, then cooked the onions and garlic in the bacon grease.  I then crumbled the bacon over the top of the potato layers.  I loved the tangyness the lemon peel gave it too.  My husband loved it!  Definite keeper recipe.

I decide to make this with Easter dinner. Usually I try out a recipe first before serving it on a holiday, so I was pretty nervous. Due to distractions, I got behind time-wise and with less than an hour until dinner, I decided to use my trusty microwave. My only change in the ingredients was using lemon juice, since I had no fresh lemons. I just added the juice to the garlic/onion mixture before adding the potatoes, then partially cooked the potatoes for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. I transfered them to the casserole dish, layered with the cheese and bread crumbs per the recipe then microwaved it, covered, for 25 minutes on high. As the crescent rolls baked, I popped the potatoes in the 375 oven for 5 minutes, but I don't even think it was necessary. It was particularly crunchy along the sides, and not everyone might like that, but we do. My family raved about this dish and demanded I make it every Easter.

This was fantastic! Better than potatoes augratin, and easier too. Didn't have rosemary, so used Italian seasoning--excellent! If you need to speed things up a bit, pop the diced potatoes in the microwave for five minutes or so before combining everything. This will definitely be one for company dinner or for potlucks.

Wow, Yum, Wow.  I knew this would be good.  I just guessed on the proportions because I didn't need to make a giant amount. I kind of halved everything, and it all worked out.  I will definitely make it again.

The only change was leaving out the onion altogether because I didn't think I'd like that flavor with this.  But everything else as is, except a shorter cooking time.  The potatoes were done after 40 minutes and the cheese had gotten over-done.  The crumb topping was way too much.  Between those two issues, I did not like this as much as I could have.  I tried it a second time, cooking the potatoes for 20 minutes before putting the additional cheese on top, and only about half the crumb topping, and really, it still just didn't quite do it for me, and I couldn't taste the rosemary.  It was OK, but there are other things I like better, such as plain butter & rosemary, or as BizzyBee said just another recipe - I'm thinking like the Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake.

I followed the recipe exactly, but can't figure out what went wrong, the potatoes were hard. I even left them in the oven longer and would never get soft.  It was so weird, but not sure if I can blame the recipe.

I admit I was not expecting much out of this recipe. We all know simple is often better, but there is such a thing as *too* simple. Don't let that fool you, though! This was WONDERFUL! It went perfectly with our grilled steaks and was divine topped with steamed broccoli. Several at the table even squirted ranch dressing on it! It is so great as written but I do plan to play with it a bit, adding things to make it a main dish. I think it would work with beef tips or chicken chunks mixed in along with broccoli or perhaps a frozen veggie medley.

i made this last night; i only used a dusting of parm cheese in between the layers...delish!!  i eyeballed the breadcrumbs and butter; cooked covered for 40 mins, then about 7 mins more with the foil off.  worked out perfectly.  you really have to keep an eye on something like this so it doesn't burn. i had to keep it 'warm' while waiting for other things, but that made the corners nice and crunchy.  just how i like it! thanks for the post Jacqueline Thompson Graves!

I just made this for a family brunch yesterday.  I used red potatoes instead because that's what I had on hand.  Everyone enjoyed the dish, and several even noticed the lemon peel addition.

I made the mistake of not adding enough cheese, and the dish came out dry. The potatoes still had a nice herb flavor to it though. I felt that the breadcrumb topping was a bit much for my personal taste, so I will cut that down if I make it again.

I chopped my onion rather than slicing so all my family would eat this. This took about 20 minutes longer to cook than stated for me and I ended up covering the potatoes again as the topping was getting a little too crispy. The end result however is something we all enjoyed. Many thanks Jacqueline.

These were fine, and that's about it.  I followed the recipe all the way.  I wish they were creamier.  Definitely a better cheesy potato recipe out there.

These potatoes were delicious and really easy to make.  For such a small amount of lemon peel, you can really taste the flavor.  If you don't like lemon, definitely cut the amount because a little bit goes a long way.  I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious! I served mine with sour cream on the side, just because I thought it needed a little more creaminess. Was a simple and delicious addition to our Christmas dinner.

My husband has asked that these become part of the regular recipe roster. Crunchy, cheesy, tasty potatoes.
