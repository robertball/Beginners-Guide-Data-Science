This is a delicious soup.  I used chicken broth and still added a bouillon cube, which gave a richer flavor.  Cut back 1/2 on the red pepper since my husband doesn't like too much "hot" and added 1/2 lb of scallops as well.  Didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried in moderation.  I used a good quality rather dry white wine as the sherry adds enough sweetness.  Thanks

I made this last night- it was fantatstic. I added fresh chopped clams, extra cod and a can of sweet corn. I kept the cilantro to a minimum because I am not a big fan, and the stew still had unbelievable flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

To all reviewers who were confused how people could have such vastly different opinions on the same taste.  Everyone is different.  It takes all kinds to make life interesting.  We are not all born from the same mother or cut from the same cloth or shaped with the same mold.  Viva La Difference.  It's just like lamb.  You either Hate it or you Love it.  Very rarely is there an indifferent.  I just happen to know the one man in Washington state who stands in that middle.  LOL.  Anyway.  I am going to go and make my own fish stew recipe right now.  I will post it when I am satisfied with it, and I am certain that there will be people who think there is too much of this, not enough of that, and what the heck were you thinking making this waste of food product....   It's all good. XD

Ditto the other reviewer.  I'm not sure what the difference is between mine and those who "loved it", but I do know one thing.  Any recipe for fish stew that has SIXTEEN ingredients raises a red flag.  Good fish stew is an incredibly simple recipe. With all due respect, this one ain't simple, it has too many ingrediaents and when I made it, it was not good.

This was a delicious fish soup recipe! I followed the recipe for the most part...but added more of the ingredients listed as well as added others. I added some extra seafood: shrimp, crab legs, shelled clams as well as canned clams, octopus (my husband likes it), extran white fish as well, and an extra can of stewed tomatoes. I also added a little more water to make it more soupy and simmered uncovered on very low flame to ensure that the liquid stayed more soupy and not stewy. I added the seafood and cilantro after the hour simmering for about 10-12 minutes. It turned out great and I served it with crusty french bread and lemon wedges on the side. My husband said he wants this for his birthday now!! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks "Dlish"...is was Delish!!

I'm not quite sure what was different between mine and the other reviewers on here, but no one liked this at all.  Even before adding the fish, the smell was not appetizing.  Too bad, I was really looking forward to this.

This was EXCELLENT! I made a few changes, not many but some. I used 6 cloves of garlic, 1 can of Rotelle tomatoes and 1/2 can of stewed tomatoes, 1 can of College Inn chichen broth and added water to bring it up to 2 1/2 cups,2 pkgs. of Wyler's chicken boullion, 3/4 lbs of shrimp cut into 3 pieces, 3/4 lb talapia, 1 can minced clams, a sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes, sprinkle of dried thyme and Italian seasoning. I also diced up 1 baking potato.I used a pretty good Chardonnay and creme sherry. All the other ingredients remained the same. my husband loved it.

I was hugry for something a little mexican tasting, so used the zesty mexican tomatoes and substituted diced bell pepper for carrots.
I always use less oil, sprayed w/olive oil pam and about 1 tb oil.
left out the crushed red peppers r/t the spicy tomatoes. My husband never moaned so much during a meal!
It was very good, a hint of heat. Could add more at the table if you wanted.
The broth was phenomenal! Served w/brown rice to add to the bowl.

I was really concerned about the amount of alcohol in this soup because if something tastes like it has too much wine then my kids do not like it.  I should not have worried.  I cannot believe how fast my family ate this!  I had to use diced tomatoes instead of stewed so I am sure that did create some difference but it was still great.  The main thing I did differently was sub half the shrimp with a large can of whole baby clams.  I used the broth for the clam juice and just dumped the clams in after it had finished cooking.  That worked perfectly since my youngest does not like shrimp and pulled it out.  More for mel

Delicious! I upped the red pepper flakes to add a little more kick. I used cod fillets which I cut into small pieces and I used a whole pound of shrimp.  Overall everyone loved it.

Tried this on Sunday, and threw in some chopped up lobster tails that had been in the freezer too long and cod and shrimp.  I thought it was out of sight.  I went a little heavy on the red pepper flakes but the end result was fantastic.  I will do this one again.

This is a fantastic soup, and deceptively simple to make. We altered some ingredients as follows: 1 can RoTel Diced Tomatoes w/ Habaneros for 1 can stewed tomatoes, 2 cans Bar Harbor Fish Stock for water, 2 tablespoons Better Than Bouillon No Chicken Base for chicken bouillon cubes. Used sea scallops rather than fish but only because they were already in the fridge. We also had some left over fresh Italian parsley which we chopped and added with the cilantro. If you like a soup with some kick, the Habaneros give it to you and the fish stock gives an added depth of flavor. This is a top shelf soup recipe for us, and plan to enjoy it often! Thank you Dlish.

I've never tried making a fish stew, but in searching for new and interesting diet-friendly things I found this. Super scrumptious -- so deliciously flavorful, and with just the right amount of spiciness!!! I used tilapia for the fish (had 3 lbs. of it in the freezer), plus added a can of whole baby clams along with the juice. I didn't have sherry, so just used the white wine. Other than that, followed the recipe as written. 

Read all of the reviews (mostly all positive) and can't quite understand the one that claimed there are too many ingredients for fish stew?? I guess we all have our own tastes, but this is restaurant-quality IMO.

I've been making this soup for a few winters now and it's really great, wonderful blend of flavors.  

It bugs me when people review a recipe but make tons of changes; that being said the ONLY thing I changed was instead of adding red pepper flakes, I used Old Bay Seasoning instead. (I live just a few miles from the Chesapeake Bay, so we have to add Old Bay to anything seafood!)  I simmered it for more like 2 hours so the flavors really blended.  Delicious!

This was ok, but just kinda boring. The only thing I did differently was to add a shrimp-flavored bouillon cube. Maybe our taste buds were just having an off day but we weren't that impressed. Thanks anyway.

THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT!!!  Thank you!  Used cod and shrimp rather than clams; veggie bouillon rather than chicken.  Added some Cajun seasoning.  Let it simmer for an hour before adding seafood.  I'll definitely make it again!  Although there are a lot of ingredients, it's not hard. :) Oh, so savory!

I am making this for this evening ... it is cold and rainy here today ... I will serve it with hot bisquits ... however, I intend to prepare it emphasizing the 'stew-like' quality vs. 'soup-like' quality and serve over white rice ... I have miscellaneous small pieces of fish in the freezer ... so I will use them this way and add shrimp ... my mother made something like this ... we loved it ...

I will report in tomorrow as to the outcome!!

UPDATE ...

Okay, I made it!!  And it was utterly fantastic ... of course, I made a few slight alterations ... which is not always the best thing to do to a recipe ... but I did ... used a bit of bell pepper, clams in the can vs. clam juice (wanted stew not soup) ... used red vs. white wine ... wanted a richer stew ... used various fish and shrimp vs. white fish ... otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee ... we absolutedly loved this stew ... it was wonderful ... served over white rice ...

excellent recipe!!!  Had to substitute a few things because I didn't have them at home.  Used chicken stock instead of water, added 7 oz more tomatoes, omitted clam juice and sherry, omitted cilantro.  Added 8 oz frozen reg, green and yellow peppers.  Used 1lb frozen calamari, shrimp and scallops.  turned out delicious!!!

My whole family loooooves this recipe.  No changes needed.  The cilantro is what makes it different and delicious for us, so if you don't like cilantro, I wouldn't recommend this to you.  I wouldn't use dried cilantro, either.  It just has a completely different flavor.  I signed on to Allrecipes just so I could give this a 5-star rating.

I love this recipe! I make it every year as part of our Christmas dinner. I add a bit of Mexican flare to it by adding a couple chopped chipotle chili's swith adobe to it. I also add lobster, clams or mussels, octopus and crab adjusting the quantities of the other ingredients as needed, it's a bit more expensive that way but totally worth it for a special occasion. I don't and wouldn't change anything else about it.

I liked it! Good Flavor. Not a huge fan of Cilantro but when I choose a recipe, I like to follow it to a tee the first time. Next time, LESS (maybe NO) Cilantro for me.

This is one of my favorites and hubby too. We are getting a spell of cooler temps and I thought this was good to take the chill off!

Great stew! Used tilapia and sherry instead of white wine because that's all I had and it still came out great.I also added one additional chipotle bouillon cube to kick it up a notch.

Simple and delicious! I used wild alaskan rocksole, scallops and shrimp. I also added okra and corn. I also added 1 C sherry in addition to the white wine.

LOVED it!  Followed the recipe exactly as stated and it was a big hit, even with our 9-yr-old!  This will be a cold-weather staple in our house for sure!

This is a ridiculously good soup. The only suggestion I would have is to cut back on the red pepper, it was a tad bit spicy. Like another reviewer, I added a can of corn and it was amazing! Used a pound of tilapia for the fish. Yum!

This was very good!  I didn't have shrimp in my freezer so I used clams, scallops and fish and it was still great.  Next time will definitely add the shrimp.

Loved it. Just added a little more of the veggies plus some parsnips. Next time might try some creole spice old  bay seasoning instead of pepper flakes.

This is such a nice hearty stew, goes great with a good dark beer.............. I added some scallops as well baby clams to give it more of a seafood taste. Couldn't find any Sherry (unless you count my sister who had quite a lot of fun teasing me when we were shopping and I told her I needed it) so I just used a nice Pinot Grigio, also used Mexican cilantro......... has a stronger flavor which I absolutely love. Added some cornstarch to thicken it up just a smidge and a good amount of Cholula hot sauce to give it some heat instead of using the red pepper flakes, my friend went back for seconds AND thirds............ will make this again and maybe add mushrooms next time

Made in an Instant Pot using the saute' function for the vegetables.  We used chicken broth rather than water an bullion and red rather than white wine.  Used the pressure cook setting for 14 minutes followed by keep warm for 1 hour all with the lid still sealed.  Turned it to saute'-low to add the fish, shrimp and cilantro for 5 minutes.  Flavor was excellent!!

Even my wife, who is a very picky eater, gave it a thumbs up.  Some changes I made to the recipe: go easy on the red pepper flakes, about 1/4 tsp, use home-made chicken stock instead of the water and chicken bouillon (too much sodium).  When it was finished, it had the consistency of soup so I thickened it with a flour paste.  I'll make it again when we have guests and serve it with French bread or home-made biscuits.

Very good. Added scallops as suggested by one reviewer. Next time I will cut red pepper in half. Too spicy for my husband. If still too spicy will leave red pepper out. But other than that he loved it.

Have made this several times. Always good. Changes: (1) add 2 red potatoes cut into small chunks; (2)substitute chicken broth for the water; (3) add 1/2 teaspoon of creole seasoning in addition to the red pepper flakes.

It was very quick and easy to make and very good although I forgot the carrots.  And I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.

I'd probably reduce the red pepper flakes next time.  I like a little bite but it was a little too spicy.  I'll make again.

I had to make a few changes based on what is available and affordable where I live. The major change was to replace the clam juice and sherry with fish stock. I used a Knorr 'gel' diluted in the water.  I also eliminated the chicken bouillon cubes since I used the fish gel. Used parsley instead of cilantro. Next time I will consider adding a little fish or oyster sauce.

We really enjoyed this - in fact I noted down on the recipe: "Excellent - one of my better efforts."  Will difinately make again when the weather gets a little colder.

I love soups and have a vast collection of favorites but this one is now at the top of the list - for both me and my husband! My only adds were a can of minced clams and juice (instead of the bottled), a chunked-up leftover grilled salmon fillet, and some Italian seasoning.  Cannot wait to make it again next weekend!!

Absolutely delicious!  Very easy to make.  I used frozen Cod and canned Salmon with canned whole Clams, canned Oysters, and Shrimp.  I did not use water, but instead used Boxed Chicken broth and I did not use bouillon cubes, but instead used "Better than Bouillon"  Instead of white wine I used Sherry.  Very quick and easy wonderful dinner!

This was delicious! I used some frozen haddock, which was perfect for this soup because it is a firm, flavorful fish that melds perfectly with the other flavors of this stew. I also substituted two cans of minced clams with the juice for the clam juice for added texture and flavor. My husband and I enjoyed every drop of this delicious, perfectly balanced soup. I toasted french bread in the oven to a very crisp, crouton-like state and floated it in the soup. Will make this regularly.

This recipe was great. I added a tsp or so of Old Bay seasoning and 1 16oz can of navy beans(drained)when I added the fish(I used cod)and shrimp. I also threw in the fresh celery leaves from the celery stalks. Yummy!

Great starter recipie. I never follow recipies to the t. I sliced 1 lemon ,shelled the shrimp and crab legs and 1lobster and started my base with those shells in water and chicken broth. Only used canned plum tomatoes and crush them with my hand and dice a large herloom tomato. I used clam juice and a bit of fish sauce one pinch of cayenne(my on wont eat any fish anyways). It always comes out different depending what seafood is fresh but its always good and sometimes i just drink the wine and dont even put it in.

I rolled with the punches and use a couple ounces of Marsala and the rest Chardonnay. I omitted the clam juice and shrimp because I had a 1 year old over for dinner. I used pollack (since it's 1.99) and emeril's rub for 30 mins on the fish. Everything else but cilantro and carrot (didn't have any) and added mushrooms and diced yellow pepper and it came out great. For the people that didn't like it just empty your veggy crisper into the stew and add some spice and everything will be fine. This was a nice framework for the canvass we cook on, enjoy!

I used this recipe and we all loved it. I added one can of clams and instead of water I used carrot juice and replaced the stewed tomatoes with 1 1/2 fresh diced tomatoes. I used ground red pepper as I wanted it to blend out. Great stew! I also had fresh zuccinni sitting on the counter so I added it and replaced the carrots with it. My kids of course ate something else like chicken, cheese, ramen and baked potatoes.

I hate when people change the recipe and then complain about the original recipe but... I was looking for a fish soup that wasn't a cream base. This one was a great starter. I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't use the wine or sherry or the clam juice, just added extra chicken broth but I think those additions would be great. Not much of a cilantro fan either. I subbed salmon for white fish. I added Old Bay Seasoning instead of the red peppers too. Thank you for getting me started!

Loved this!!!  I'd never made a fish stew before and this was easy and tasted terrific.  The only thing I changed was the following: added 12 littleneck clams, 1 large, peeled and cubed russet potato, and 2 extra chicken boullion cubes (mostly b/c I know I prefer a saltier taste).  Thank you so much for sharing!

My husband, a restaurant owner and self-avowed food critic, loved it!  Had two bowls and asked how I made it.  That never happens.
I did add more wine, used mahi-mahi and added potato chunks toward the end.  The flavors were perfect!  A very hearty stew.

I stuck to the exact recipe and it turned out suprisingly good! I knew it would be good, but it was REALLY GOOD! My dad brought the pot to the table when there was no more left and wiped the pot with a piece of bread! It says 6 servings, but it's really more like 4. If you're feeding 4 or more, you should probably double up.
