Ok, this was really good, but I made a few changes after reading some other reviews. I added a minced garlic clove, and threw in a little red bell pepper with the green to add a little color, and sauted along with the onion in a tbsp extra virgin olive oil before adding the ground chicken. When I added the chicken, I put a splash of garlic powder and oregano, salt and pepper in it. Then added the soups and the fat free evaporated milk. The only thing I would have done differently to the finished product, was throw in another layer of noodles. I did substitute some cheddar cheese for half of the mozerella also, just because I didn't have enough. Turned out very tasty indeed! Not bland, and very colorful! Enjoy!

I really liked the chicken lasagna recipe, but I added spinach and used baked chicken that had been chopped up as opposed to the ground chicken.

This recipe is a good base, I made a few simple changes though, due to my husband's dislike for mushrooms. I changed the cream of mushroom soup to cream of broccoli. Also we really like peppers to I changed the peppers to 1 each of orange and green peppers, and riccotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I also added minced garlic to the peppers when I fried them up. I also added garlic powder to each layer of the lasagna. The changes made it a very rich and filling lasagna.

Thumbs up from picky husband - and that's saying something!  I used broccoli instead and green pepper, two cans chicken instead of ground chicken.  It's a keeper - thanks!

This was okay, It needs something though. I even added a ton of fresh mushrooms and that wasn't enough. I don't think I would make it again, it is all too much one color, just blah.

This was delicious.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and sauteed a little fresh garlic with the onions and peppers.  I also added mushrooms and used 12 oz. of cottage cheese instead of the 8 oz.  My husband actually asked for it two nights in a row.  Great recipe! Thanks!!! :o)

The first time I made this it was "ok" But the second time I spiced it up while cooking my chicken I added minced garlic. Then when I was layering it I added some mushrooms, garlic & onion powder and it made a big difference!!!! Now it isn't so boring.

This was very good. I also used spinach in it as well to add some more color and texture.  My husband raved about this...said it was better than my regular lasagna!  He hasn't stopped talking about it since we've had it.

My husband and I gave this dish 4 stars. I used all the ingredients listed but I did add chopped spinach and different seasonings. Next time I would add the cheese for the top on 15 minutes before it is done. This taste much better the next day.

This was a great dish for when you want something different.  My daughter & husband both loved it.  My picky son would try it, but the rest of us loved it.

Excellent. Added sliced mushrooms, chopped fresh kale, and Italian seasoning to meat/soup mixture. Used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.

If I think of this recipe as a casserole, I like it just fine, but I didn't think it was very lasagna-like.  I used shredded chicken breast, mushroom and garlic soup, half red and half white onion, ricotta rather than cottage cheese, and added about five cloves of minced garlic, a tablespoon of garlic Alfredo sauce mix, Romano cheese, and a bag of frozen spinach.

The measurements in this didn't seem to make sense - 1/2 cup of sauce didn't even spread to cover the bottom of a 13x9 pan, and it didn't do so on the other layers, either, nor did the cottage cheese. I used the shopping list creator from this site and got the ingredients from the recipe exactly, didn't have extra veggies on hand, and it definitely needed some. I seasoned the chicken with garlic, lawry's, onion salt & celery salt, and the dish still seemed bland. Next time I'd definitely throw in spinach, peas, corn, carrots, or all of the above. I'd also add more cream soup to make more sauce. With some tweaks, could be a very good dish.

My fiance ate this up rather quickly- He went back for thirds and then the next day finished it off completely! To me, it was just okay.  I'll definitely make this again for him.

My boyfriend loved it, however, I thought there needed to be more contrast of flavors.  It tasted pretty bland to me even after I added fresh garlic, spinach and used the cream of mushroom w/ roasted garlic soup.  Thanks for the recipe anyway.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  These isn't that much layering like other typical lasagne recipes, so assembly and preparation is quicker.  I used ground turkey and it turned out great!

I made this tonight and it came out great!  I implemented a few changes suggested by other reviewers and I am SO glad I did.  I made this lasagna with 4 layers instead of just 2--it required 12 cooked lasagna noodles.  When I cooked the ground chicken, I also cooked with it half of a red pepper, half of a green pepper, and half of a red onion.  I did season well with garlic, black pepper, oregano, bail, italian seasoning, a bit of cayenne, and just a few red pepper flakes, and a splash of worchestershire sauce.  I also used regular evaporated milk in the sauce.  I then followed the layer directions, just with additonal layers.  Adding the two additonal layers DID require that I use 16 oz of cottage cheese as opposed to just 8 oz, but it turned out so much better with the extra layers--more like lasagna should be.  The cooking time and temp remained the same.  350 degree for 1 hour.  All in all a delicious meal!  My hubby LOVED this!

This was such a flavorful dish!  The bell pepper added a lot of good flavor.  After reading other reviews, I added half a box of frozen spinach, some minced garlic, salt, and oregano while I was browning the chicken.  Worked great with the ground chicken.  My 3 year-old and 17 mo-old loved it, too!  My husband and I are trying to watch our weight, so I used 98% fat-free soups and fat-free cottage cheese.  It still turned out great - couldn't even tell it was lower in fat!

This was great! I added fresh baby spinach for color and extra nutritional value. I also used no-boil lasagna noodles to cut down on the prep. The hubs loved it!

This might have been okay with turkey or beef, but the ground chicken was awful.  There really does need to be fresh mushrooms in this dish as well.

I found this quite bland.  I should have added spices to pick up the flavor.  Too much liquid.

Delicious and different.  I usually have tomato sauce lasagna and this was a great alternative.  I really cranked up the garlic, a couple fresh cloves and I topped with parmesan.  Also prepared it in a slow cooker. Crowd cleaned out the dish, the best review that can be given!  Also added colour with zucchini and mushroom.

I made a chicken lasagne and used this as the inspiration, changing many of the ingredients for example I used diced chicken breast rather than ground meat, and added mushrooms to complement the soups. I found the sauce quite runny which is saying something as I left out the milk (forgot to buy). Will probably make again, but not next week.

This is such a easy and tasty recipe, I added some crushed red chili and garlic and ginger powder. Also, added Italiano seasoning. They have used cottage cheese and mozzarella but I also used Ricotta cheese.
