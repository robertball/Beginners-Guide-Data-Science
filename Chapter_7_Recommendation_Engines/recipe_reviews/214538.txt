This was excellent!  We don't keep pina colada mix on hand, so I opted to use a combination of coconut milk and pineapple juice for the mix...and I kept forgetting to pick up pineapple juice, so in the end, I opened a can of crushed pineapple and use some of that juice.  A few of the pineapple bits poured out and I liked the result of teeny bits of fruit on the finished product.  My only other change was to use a Portuguese Saloio Bread, kind of dense, chewy, tiny hint of sweetness, and that paired beautifully with the pina colada flavors, as well as being a great "French toast" bread!  I did experiment by sprinkling a couple of the dipped slices of bread with some shredded coconut before pan-frying, but some pieces burned a bit, so next time I'll just have toasted coconut to offer as an additional topping.  Wonderful summery breakfast idea! Thanks, laughingmagpie!

This recipe is a keeper!  As a pina colada fan, I loved this and found it to be a new and exciting way to make French toast.  The bananas seemed a little out of place to me and I think I would prefer garnishing it with pineapple and most definitely coconut,  but hubby thought they were just fine with the bananas.   I only used 6 eggs in the egg dip because 8 just seemed like a lot, but I measured everything else the same.

Fun! I added some pineapple juice and creme de coconut to the egg mix. I also made a "syrup" with the left over pineapple juice, coconut cream with some cinnamon, nutmeg and a splash of lime that I boiled until thick (ended up using a little corn starch to make it real thick like a glaze).

Another idea for this to make it really even more tropical is to use Hawaiian sweet bread in place of the French bread. Mmm!

I love pina coladas so this is the perfect french toast for me. If you want the rum, just add a little rum extract to the mix. Yummy.

Made it according to the recipe and family really enjoyed the "something different" aspect!  (As for the topping - I toasted the coconut and liked the tiny bit of crunch.)

This didn't have much taste.  Will not be making again.  I followed the recipe and this one just didn't work for my family.  But do give it a try because your family may like it better than we did.

I halved the recipe, and it made 7 slices.
Mods:
Half-cup measuring cup, filled 1/3 with coconut cream and 2/3 with pineapple juice
Same measuring cup mostly filled with milk
Whatever bread I had in the fridge

Iollowed SisterSarah's suggestion and made a syrup, which saved this recipe from being rather bland.  The syrup was approx. 1 cup pineapple juice, 1/2 cup coconut cream, dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, lime juice - boiled down
I tried to add corn starch, but I forgot to mix it into a slurry first, so I picked out the beads that formed.
I should have made the syrup ahead of time to allow it to cool.

This is a very good french toast recipe.  The pina colada flavor did not come through as strongly as I'd hoped though, so next time I will play with the ratio of milk to pina colada mix.  But overall I was very pleased with the results.  DH loved it!  A fun twist on french toast.

I think next time I'll replace the milk with more pina mix, the flavor didn't really come through...

I cut the loaf of soft Itallian bread into thick slices the night before and let it dry out on the counter top.  Only needed 5 eggs and used 1/2 cup each of milk & mix (next time will use more mix).  I addeed a few drops of coconut extract and a few chunks of canned pineapple with about 2 tbsp. of pineapple juice.  Put it in the blender for a a really smooth batter.  Served topped with a slice of bacon and a pineapple ring - a definite keeper!

What a delightful change of taste for french toast. It has a very subtle taste of the flavors of the pina colada mix. This only needs fresh fruit for a topping and not syrup. I got 20 slices of Texas Toast from this recipe. I individually froze and stacked it back in the bread sack for a quick breakfast treat. Magpie - so glad you came up with this recipe.  UPDATE:  I originally made this in June when it was a personal recipe.  I have since made it 3 times.  It freezes well and heats up great in the toaster or the microwave.

Absolutely delicious, just as written! The bananas are a great touch, and add to the tropical flavors. I wasn't at all sure about this one, but having tried it, I'll be making it often ... and it's EASY!

Something else that will make this a 6 star is using coconut pancake syrup. You can make your own (recipe was on this site) or purchase from the grocery store.

OK this is my recipe and one thing to make it right is To make sure you buy a good quality pina colada mix. NO value or store brands. Please. Or adjust the recipe to suit flavours.

I really loved this recipe! I didn't use any pina colada, but it was still the greatest french toast I have ever had. Since the banana slices on top made it taste a lot better i would definitely not recommend skipping this. I also put some powdered sugar on top, because it looks great and I like some extra sweetness.
