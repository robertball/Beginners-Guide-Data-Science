Fantastic recipe! I used chicken breast tenders and doubled the recipe to feed 4 people. I grilled the tenders for 6 minutes each side in my Panasonic CIO, and the temp was right at 165 degrees. They were moist, flavorful and so so good! I served this with Asian Coconut Rice (also from this site), and sauteed zucchini, carrots and onions. My husband kept saying "this is a do again!" Consider that high praise!

Really quick, easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and we all enjoyed this. I made a side of roasted julliened carrots and green onions that I roasted on auto cook 4 with a little sesame oil. When they were done I tossed them with a mixture of soy sauce and sweet chili lime sauce and served it over couscous. Such a good dinner! I'll be making this again for sure!

Fabulous!  Two in the family were angry about the cilantro and lime in the marinade until they tasted the finished product.  The author was immediately forgiven and they asked for seconds.  The chicken was moist and tender and packed great flavor.  Served this with waffle fries and fresh fruit.  8 out of 8 thumbs up!

Absolutely loved this recipe. The chicken was juicy and moist. Followed the recipe as given. Any leftovers were just as good cold the next day. The only suggestion would be to buy boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cut them in half. This recipe is definitely a keeper

Excellent recipe from my friend Brian.   Out of necessity I had to sub in dried cilantro and I sped up the marinate time by using a vacuum sealer marinate tray.   The chicken was tender and flavorful and juicy!

Made as written,  marinated  overnight.  Great grilled chicken recipe.  I did not use the sweet chili sauce although i am sure it would have been delicioius.  I  sliced for salads and sandwich wraps for lunches.  Will definately make again.

This recipe was really tasty.

I cooked it in a pan, stove top and at the end threw in mushrooms to saute in the sauce.

I added a side of steamed asparagus and dinner was served!

I marinated overnight, used skinless boneless thighs and it was awesome! Grilled 3-5 min per side.

I sautéed the chicken in a pan. I used half sweet chili sauce and half chili garlic sauce. Added a little soy sauce at the end to thin out the chili sauce. Pretty tasty.

I made this tonight with Coconut Lime Rice...it was an outrageous combination.  We will definitely be having it again VERY soon.  We didn’t want to stop eating.  I sautéed some zucchini and grated carrots in Coconut Oil to accompany the meal.

I used chicken tenders and was intending to grill them on my BBQ, but as things turned out (you know how families roll), I ran out of time and light and used stovetop.  Still the chicken was flavorful and yummy.  I marinated the chicken for about five hours or so before cooking, and for small pieces of chicken that may have been just a touch too long.  But still it was great! 
 Thanks, bd.weld!

My husband, my boys (11 and 13) and I all really enjoyed this dish!  Based on another reviewers recommendation, I served it with the Asian Coconut Rice recipe from this site, and really liked the pairing of the 2!  We all had fun trying toppings of cilantro, lime juice (that combo was my fav) and the sweet chili lime sauce.  All were great!  The chicken breasts I used were large, I think I would use smaller breasts or tenders next time to allow more flavor to soak in.   I marinated for 6 hours, but will try overnight next time.  I cooked it on a stove top grill, but took longer.  Will try regular grill next time.

5/31/2019 - This is our 2nd time making this recipe and now updating it from 4 stars to 5 stars as the flavors just meld together so perfectly!  This recipe is so easy to whip together and delicious! The first time we made it, the flavors didn’t come through enough for us, but my grill master thinks it was his fault on the charcoal grill 2 years ago as he was rushing (too much smokey type char flavor). Finally made this recipe again last night as I had cilantro to use up and was short on time. Followed exactly as written and it’s a hit in this house! Squeezed a little lime on top of the chicken at the end, after brushing on the sweet chili sauce makes this recipe even better. We served with arroz verde (leftovers) and grilled broccoli. Thanks for the recipe bd.weld!

Delicious! I was so excited to eat that I initially forgot to top it off with the sweet chili sauce...I remembered after I took a bite, but before I took the photo! LOL
With or without it, this recipe is a winner. I made no changes and this turned out great. Thanks, Brian for a yummy dinner!

This recipe was so easy to get together and had fabulous flavor!  I marinated it all day while I was at work  and cooking on the CIO made for a quick weeknight dinner. My chicken breasts were a little larger, so, mine cooked about 8 minutes per side.  They were so juicy and the flavors complemented each other perfectly.   I will definitely make again.

This was a fantastic chicken recipe that is full of flavor and so moist. It even made my non liking cilantro hubby ask for this again.  A keeper for sure!
