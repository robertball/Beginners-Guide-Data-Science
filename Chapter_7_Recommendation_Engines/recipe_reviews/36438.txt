I HAVE STARTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT RECIPES THAT VERY FEW OR NO ONE HAS TRIED. I HAVE BEEN PLEASTLEY SURPRISED. THIS IS SO GOOD. I DO WATCH HOW OFTEN I EAT THIS WITH THE CALORIES BUT MY TEENAGERS LOVE THIS AND EAT IT THEN BURN IT ALL OFF. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT MAKING SOMETHING THAT IS SO HEALTHY FOR THEM AND HAVE THEM EAT IT TOO.

This Granola has great flavor, but using all the measurements provided, it came out kinda sticky. I made it side by side with the almond maple granola, which came out great, but the muesli never really dried enough to be crunchy, it just browned, still staying soft. Next time I'll use less honey. I'm going to salvage this batch by adding raisins and/or chocolate chips, roll it into half serving size balls, and take it hiking as serious-energy trail mix!

Yes, this is granola. No, I will not rate it lower because the submitter calls it "muesli". It's a good, tasty, basic granola recipe. I'd suggest using at least two baking sheets. I made half a batch and had to divide it between two baking sheets to get it to bake evenly. If you want chunky granola, don't stir during the last 40 minutes or so. This is great served with yogurt and berries.

This is not muesli, it's granola.  Muesli is not cooked.  Looks like a good granola recipe, though

The "coating" for the recipe can be played with. I've used brown sugar as well a sweet corn syrup in place of some of the honey. I've also tried other grains. Comes out great every time.

We have a restaurant that I always order Muesli at for breakfast.  This recipe tastes just like it.  Excellent taste and very easy to make.

I used wheat bran because I didn't know where to find rolled wheat and I didn't feel like figuring it out.

I didn't have some of the ingredients on hand so left them out (rolled wheat, sesame seeds, wheat germ) and I increased the pumpkin seeds to 1/2 cup. I used 1/2 cup honey and 1/4 cup turbinado sugar (mixed sugar with dry ingredients), and added 1/2 tsp of salt to cut the sweet. I microwaved the oil/honey mixture for 20 seconds instead of dirtying a saucepan, and it mixed just fine into the dry ingredients. Then I baked on two parchment paper-lined sheets at 250 for about 2 hrs, stirring every 30 mins. It smelled amazing! After taking it out I let it sit on the pans to harden up, then broke it into chunks and added dried cranberries. Delicious, great with Greek yogurt!

Yummy recipe that easily customized to your taste. I am surprised more have not tried this recipe. Its super easy to make and can be modified with whatever nuts, seeds or dried fruit on hand. I have made it several times changing the spices I add to the honey mix. Great as a cereal or with yogurt.
