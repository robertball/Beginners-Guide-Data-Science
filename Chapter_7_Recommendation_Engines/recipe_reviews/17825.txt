I have to say these cookies turned out all right for me. I used a 9 oz box of mix, but the same amout of the other ingredients, slightly more water. And they were good, moist. They did fall apart if you tried to eat them right out of the oven, but let them cool, and they were fine.

The most delicious, moist, and easy to make peanut butter cookies ever! During the Holidays I put an extra touch to them by adding a Hershey's kiss in the middle of them while they are still warm.

Great cookies! Was looking for an easy non dairy cookie and this is it. Used jiffy pie crust mix (9 oz ).

These are great!  They DO require some skill (and patience!) so I see why people have botched the recipe.  You need to be careful when adding the water, very slowly, and do not overmix.  Allow to cool for quite a while.  They remind me of old-fashioned pie crust, with the pie included.

the pie crust mix makes this cookie way too bland and tasteless.  remove it from the ingredient list, as well as the water, and add an egg.  and you have a nice healthy cookie.  You can even refrigerate the dough for a spell, to make it easier to ball.

Add a generous tablespoon of mayonnaise (my elderly country aunt's go-to flavor enhancer for bland baked goods). Splash of vanilla and a tablespoon of table sugar sure don't hurt, either. Use half milk, half water and add a splash at a time. Don't overmix! Let cool! I use crunchy peanut butter and sometimes put a pinch of oats on top. They're pretty and don't spread much.

Definitely dry and fall apart even after 5 minutes on baking sheet.  Not recommended at all even if you are stuck.

I have been baking peanut butter cookies with this recipe for years! They do fall apart if you eat them while they're still hot, but once they cool they are just fine. I add a little extra touch to them during the holidays, by putting a Hershey's Kiss on top of them while they are still warm.
