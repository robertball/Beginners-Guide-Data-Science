This is definitely not your "run of the mill" BLT! And to say that is really saying something because I've had a lot of them in my lifetime! Combining bacon, lettuce and tomato is just as classic a combination as peanut butter and jelly in my book. But, perk it up with the addition of creamy guacamole and this combination of flavors and textures takes this classic to a whole new level. I used a thick cut smoked bacon, crisp iceburg lettuce, tomatoes seasoned with cracked black pepper, and, "Guacamole" by Bob Cody from this site. I also added a little Hellman's light mayo to take it over the top. Perfect for a quick and easy lunch or weeknight meal and great paired with tomato soup!
