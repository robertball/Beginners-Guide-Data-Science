My father hadn't had anise cookies, so I surprised him with these cookies. They were a hit with him--thank you. I used the royal icing 1, to frost them but added black liquorice liquor, instead of lemon extract.

Wonderful recipe...however,I divided the dough and rolled and cut the dough for baking.
They became soft, puffs cookies. Delicious!
