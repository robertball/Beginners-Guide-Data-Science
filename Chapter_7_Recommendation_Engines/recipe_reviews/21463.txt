This looks very nice after you bake it. It really looked beautiful. However, it was VERY sweet. Next time I will use 1/3 of the amount of sugar it calls for- if any. I suggest you add sugar little by little until it is just sweet enough for you, then bake.

I would rate this even higher!!!  I have never made a more beautiful and perfect souffle although I must admit I used some of my own instincts since the cooking instructions were not very clear. I did use a 1/8 cup less sugar as others suggested.  When I mashed the carrots they were still lumpy so at the very end, before pouring the carrots into the casserole dish, I put it all in the blender and blended it until smooth.  I think that made all the difference in the world.  It rose beautifully and did not fall. Can't wait to have company to show this dish off.  Thanks submitter!

Really, truly fantastic!  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, pureed the carrot mixture in the food processor and sprinkled a small am't of cinnamon and nutmeg over the top when it came out of the oven.  It came out fabulously well--light and airy, yet buttery sweet and delicious.  I served it with coconut crusted chicken and the meal was superb.

This receipe can be made diet friendly by substituting the sugar with 1/4 Cup Splenda Sugar Blend for Baking, and the stick of butter with 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  It works great, and saves a lot of calories.

This might be one of the best things I have ever tasted.  Took others advice and used about 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  Steamed the carrots and mixed everything in the blender.  Tastes like sweet potato or pumpkin pie filling - only brighter.  Thank you for sharing.

This was the 1st time I had made a souffle and it was perfect. I did what one reviewer suggested and blended everything in a food processor to smooth out the carrots, but I did not reduce the sugar and it turned out just fine. I will make again!!!

I have my own recipe for Carrot Souffle which is similar except that i use small ammts of spices (cinn, nutmeg or allspice).  I also have used canned carrots or eggbeaters and 1/2 c. sugar and it always comes out beautifully!! It is a most requested recipe. (a processor is key)

Great recipe!  This is a new favorite.  I only use 1/2 cup of sugar and I also add a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg.  These are so yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!  First souffle and it was a breeze.
I made it SAVORY by NOT adding vanilla and sugar. Instead I steamed the carrots with 1/2 a leek, and 2 garlic cloves.  When the cooked veggies were cool enough, I added everything (but the vanilla/sugar) AND 1 t black pepper and 1/2 C shredded Italian cheese into a food processor.  When fully blended and smooth, into the oven it went.  Cooked up nice and tasty!  I'll definitely be making this one again!

I was just in the south and had carrot souffle for the first time.  I came home and made this recipe.  It was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and only put in half of the sugar.  Enjoy this easy souffle

I agree with the other reviews...this is absolutely wonderful!!  I am on a special diet of no sugar, white flour or red meat and this was to die for!!  I followed another review and used applesauce for the margarine and 1/3 cup of splenda for the sugar, added some cinnamon and nutmeg and almost ate the entire bowl myself!!  It really does taste like pumpkin pie filling!  Can't wait to make it again!!

Great recipe! I cut down on the sugar and made this for my teething 15-month-old who didn't want to eat any veggies (or anything for that matter). The little bit of sweet did the trick - she loved it!! Thanks a bunch. This one is a keeper!!

This is a fantastic recipe. I added a  little of the water the carrots were boiled in (and saved the rest to boil rice in later so we still go the nutrients) to the blender to blend the carrots. I cut down the sugar and since we like a lot of cinnamon in my house I used a lot and this was a HUGE hit and trust me, I actually hate cooked carrots but this was more like a carrot cake taste wise.  It will be made often in my house.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Very yummy! Very easy.  Didn't know if I should peel the carrots so I did.  (I know some people don't)  Think  I will steam the carrots in the micro next time though.  Should have thought of that first..Will make again, and I think I will try to make this for Thanksgiving.  Seriously, getting sick of the same ol' stuff at Mom and Dads.   Pushing 40 and don't have a tradition of my own to add to the holidays,this may just do it!  Thanks!

Tastes just like the one served at the big cafeteria restaurant.  Sift some powdered sugar on top and you have a near perfect clone!

This tastes very close to Piccadilly Cafeteria's Carrot Souffle.  Since I am trying to cut calories where I can, I used Brummel and Brown Spread for the margarine.  I also used 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup Splenda.  I used my food processor to chop baby carrots before cooking, and then I used it again to puree and mix everything before baking in the oven.  I may cut the sugar a little more next time since I have become accustomed to less.

Baby food for adults. I cut the margarine to half, used only two eggs and cut the sugar to (I think) 1/4 cup. Sprinkled cinnamon only on top. Used a blender for smooth carrots. Baked beautifully.

Great texture and flavor.  Used whole wheat flour and still seemed great.  SO SWEET!  I have a mega sweet tooth and even then felt that this was overwhelming.  Cut sugar in half!

This souffle is delicious and custardy. I cut the recipe by half since I was only cooking for two and I thought it was a great new way to prepare carrots as a side dish. I cut the sugar by about a third. I'll be making it again and sharing with friends and fam who are bored with the normal carrot recipes.

This is a good dish for my youngest teen (13). She loved it. My other 2 teens wouldn't touch it and my husband took a tiny nibble & that was it.  I enjoyed it with the rest of the dinner but not by it's self.  I always had another bite of food at the same time on my fork -- that made the taste better for me but I give this recipe 3 stars & a place in my recipe box for my daughter & that's where it ends.  If you aren't a carrot lover, you probably won't like this dish.

This was delicious. I wasn't sure what to expect and was skeptical of the eggs rather than egg whites. I'd never made a souffle, but I understood it's egg whites that makes them rise. Nevertheless I made it as written only sized down to 4 servings. It didn't rise very high or look like pictures I've seen of souffles, but it was still beautiful and I love that it doesn't really taste like carrots. Maybe I'll try egg whites next time.

Great recipe!  My only adjustment was to cut the sugar back, as suggested by others.  My 13 month old loves carrots, so this was a great way to do carrots in a new way for him.  I got good reviews from my husband too....he doesn't usually say too much, so that's a good thing.  These re-heat really well too!

This recipe came out even more delicious than it sounded.  Everyone wanted a second helping--though it's probably a little too sweet to ask for a third.  Did I mention how delicious it was?!

Super tasty, like a yummy dessert... or the inside of a pie.  Great way to tease the kiddos into eating something 'healthy'.  Less sugar next time (so I can enjoy more of it) :)

Great souffle. I made this last night and my husband and son both loved it. I took some suggestions from other reviewers though. I used 1/3 c white sugar and 1/3 c brown sugar, and also added.1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I put all the ingredients in a processor until nice and smooth. I looked wonderful, smelled fabulous, and tasted even better! Thanks submitter and reviewers.

Made this carrot souffle last night. Served it with roasted turkey breast. Everyone said it was 'Delicious' and all that was left by the time I ate were a couple tablespoons.

Oh my God, this was soooo good. I was totally impressed.  Followed recipe exactly and the taste was sweet but not too much.  So easy since I put everything in a food processor.  Made in individual ramekins.  This will definitely be one of my new favorites !!

Pretty eggy and without as much carrot taste as I had hoped for. Still very good though, about 1/2 cup of sugar is plenty.

This was good, but a bit eggy for my taste.  My husband is begging me to make it again, though, so I think I'll just use two eggs next time.

Tastes just like Picadilly's.  Only problem was that I had to increase the cooking time by about 15 minutes.

This was really good-I should've doubled as it was the first dish gone!
I did whip the carrots at the end and it puffed up beautifully.

This is a favorite dish of our family for the holidays. While the dish is still hot, I sprinkle powdered sugar on top. It makes this fabulous, crunchy topping.

This tasted more like carrot flavored sugar than anything else.  If you're going to make this use no more than 1/4 cup sugar.

I was hoping for more of a carrot flavor, but this came out light, fluffy, and eggy.  Took the suggestion of topping it with cinnamon and nutmeg - this did give it needed flavor.  Unfortunately, I also took the suggestion of using just 1/4 c Splenda.  Minimum of 1/2 c sugar is needed to make this dish taste right.

I get Carrot Souffle every time my husband and I go to Picadilly.  This is just as good.  I used organic unsalted butter instead of margarine, cutting it down to 6T instead of 8.  It had a buttery richness.  I replaced much of the sugar with Organic Zero by Wholesome Sweetners (a granulated sugar with no calories, artificial ingred., glycemic index or bitter after taste).  It was beautiful, delicious and easy.  I used my Rival electric wand to puree the carrots, stir the eggs and combine ingredients together.  I took it over to my 90 yr old in-laws house for dinner tonight as a side along with a meat and potato type meal.  It was enjoyed by all.  My husband especially liked it.  I'll be making this one again guaranted.

I made the recipe as written and by time I had finished, I realized I did not enjoy it with the amount of sugar specified. Perhaps if your crowd is more into sweet veggies, it's probably a nice way to trick them into getting something like carrots on their plate. But, that said, I thought this was kind of gross by time I finished adding the sugar and spices didn't really help things. I did find, however, that I really enjoyed the buttery carrot taste of my mixture before I had sugared it up to high heaven... so I think I will likely use this recipe's technique in the future but limit my added sugar to maybe a couple of tablespoons, and skip out on the desserty spices altogether. That said, I was also the only person (of the three of us eating that night) who didn't like the dish, so maybe it's just personal preference. Three stars for technique and a really different spin on veggies! :) Definitely worth considering for a holiday dinner.

I made this for friends last night, and it turned out great. Everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added two teaspoons of vanilla instead of one. I'll definitely make this again! I didn't think it was too sweet, as others are saying, but maybe I'll try cutting down on the sugar next time, just to make it healthier.

We were skeptical of this recipe - never had it, much less heard of it.  Nonetheless, it was TASTY and simple to put together.  I cut the butter to ~1/4 cup, and cut the sugar to ~1/3 cup.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I halved the recipe, using only 1 egg, and 2T of sugar, and pureed it in the blender.  It was quite good - tastes like sweet potatoes, but still too sweet.  I'll omit the sugar completely next time.

This is a dessert in my house, but one I don't mind serving as a side dish for dinner. I put all the ingredients directly into a blendtec blender to mix it well. The better it's mixed, the better it tastes.

This recipe is delicious but I rated it with only four stars because it's too sweet. I cut the sugar in half based on the other reviewers but I think I could've cut it further. Next time I'm going to try using 2 tablespoons of sugar instead and see how it tastes.  I also used an immersion blender to get a better consistency.

My souffle did not remain souffle. :-(  Nevertheless, it still tasted great and the family also enjoyed it. Like other raters suggested, I added maybe 1/8 - 1/4 cup less sugar and it was perfect.  Now if I could just figure out how to keep it from falling 5 min after out of the oven, I'd be golden!

This was very good.  I took the advice of several reviewers and drastically reduced the amount of sugar that it called for.  I added the sugar after mixing all of the other ingredients and then added just a little bit...probably about 1/4 cup. I also added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.

This was so delicious, I could have eaten the whole thing in one sitting! I had a 16 oz package of baby carrots, so didn't chop them before boiling.  Also did 1/4 c. white and 1/4 c. brown sugar (instead of 3/4 c. white).  Add cinnamon and slightly more vanilla extract than suggested.  Also I added ingredients to food processor to puree before cooking.  A perfect side for Thanksgiving (or any night!)

I followed the recipe exactly and don't feel it needs to be done any differently. It was excellent. It did not rise, but it didn't matter because it was so delicious. I am not very fond of carrots but this recipe has me sold. My husband likes carrots so I wanted to try something to enhance it and this was the recipe for that.

This was delicious. I used half the butter called for and it still turned out great. Next time, I'll use half the sugar too, that way I can eat it without the guilt. Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't really care for it. It didn't rise, tasted eggy, and didn't really taste like carrots.

Stayed true to the recipe- hubby devoured it.
Cutting a little sugar as others have suggested would be good, but if you like carrot dessert, mmm, this is the way to go;)

Loved this-made it just like the recipe stated and it turned out perfect.  Served it with Pork Loin and Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Green Beans and it was wonderful.  Everyone at the party raved about it.

My first perfect score.  Hardly any effort and tasty.  I didn't know that carrots could be so light and fluffy.  It is a sweet dish.

This is excellent! I followed the advice of others by reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and adding some cinnamon & nutmeg.  Really delicious.  I noticed the written recipe says to bake 45 minutes while the bit above the recipe says 1 hour.  It looked done after 45 minutes but turned out to still be pretty wet in the middle; next time I will bake it for the full hour.

Perfect option for something a little different at the table!  This was pretty easy to make, I did boil the carrots a bit longer than 20 min, to get super mushy.  Then I was able to blend it all with a hand mixer.  I put in a pie dish, so pretty for Thanksgiving.  I will definitely  make this again, I may top with marshmallows next time.  I don't know it will ever beat out sweet potato casserole, but again, very good and a good option!

This turned out to be pretty good!  I did use 1/3 cup each of brown and white sugar.  It took longer thanI expected to get the carrots mushy enough to blend, but I did then use a blender to mix it all up.  Kind of a messy recipe, at least for me!  But turned out delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

My diners from age 9 to 94 all LOVED it. Reduced sugar to half cup, added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, puréed in blender, sprinkled paprika on top before baking.  Served with filet mignon, russet potato stacks, roasted asparagus.  Giant hit!

Every time I make this, guests go crazy for it. After boiling I use a food processor to mash and mix the rest of ingredients. I have tried adding spices, but they seem to take away from the simple deliciousness. I make this well in advance and let it come to room temperature or even refrigerate it before serving, which tapers the carrot flavor which my family finds more palatable. It is great for breakfast, brunch, or dinner side. You can even serve it as dessert if you sprinkle it with powdered sugar.

We have officially switched from Sweet Potato casserole to Carrot Souffle for the holidays!   Even the skeptics in the visiting family have been changed and now this is their favorite dish on the table.  It's sweet like SP casserole but not as sweet (you can also adjust it to fit your taste).  We also like the texture much better than chunks of sweet potatoes. A huge favorite and going to start cooking this for my little boy and girl on a regular basis!

AWESOME!!! Cut the sugar and use brown sugar instead of white, or a combination of the two. Add some ground cinnamon and allspice (about 1/2 tsp. each) and a dash or two of nutmeg.

we loved this - light, fluffy, and perfect for fall/winter.  i shredded the carrots in a food processor, then steamed them since we like it to have a little texture.  also cut the sugar back to 1/3 evaporated cane sugar. very delish!

It looks and tastes more like a squash pie more so than carrot anything.  

After read several reveiws, I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 tbspoon of brown for top, 2 eggs instead of 3, and a cube of butter as called for but left the vanilla out.  I used 1 tspn cinamon and 1/2 tspn allspicen as well as freshly pulled carrots from the garden.

Even withouth the vanilla, it tastes quite delicious and not overly sweet. 

The next time I make, I'll use about 1/2 cube butter instead of full cube and cut the white sugar down to 1/3 cup and finish with a sweetened glaze drizzle.

I don't even really like carrots, but this was SO good.  I made it for Easter brunch and normally I try things out before serving them to guests, but I didn't have time so I took a chance and it came out great.  It was really simple - I did take others advice and cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used a stick blender to puree everything before baking.  I wasn't sure if it was cooked enough at first because in a lot of the pictures it looks brown on top but that must be other spices or sugar added because mine was bright orange, but it was definately done.

Very very nice.  Way too sweet.  I cut the sugar down from 3/4 C to 1/2 C and it was still way too sweet.

Mine also turned out soupy but I think it's because when I food-processored the carrots, I added some water to help with that process.  So if you Cuisinart the carrots be wary of adding water.

In general the dish was a success and I would definitely try it again with less sugar and less water.

Why is this even considered a souffle??? I baked it and it is so heavy. Nothing at all like a light and airy souffle... It tastes okay, I too cut back on the sugar and also used spelt flour and pure cane sugar. I also shredded the carrots prior to cooking and mashing.  I am just not certain about considering this a souffle...its more like a baked carrot custard or quiche.

This was great - light and fluffy. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and added a dash each of nutmeg and cinnamon. Like others, I mixed everything in the food processor and that got rid of lumps (next time, though I'd pulse so it doesn't become too smooth). The perfect accompaniment to chicken.

The was excellent! Like most people I used less sugar and a bit less butter. I did not add cinnamon and nutmeg. People said it made it taste like sweet potatoes, if I wanted sweet potatoes I would have made sweet potatoes! I think it's sad when people give a lesser rating when they change recipe or don't have correct ingredients on hand. People are nice enough to share recipes with us, so be nice! I will make this again and again.

This is so yummy I can hardly stand it!!  I was very limited on veggies but had lots of carrots so I thought I would try this.  I used 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar and added a little clove and a little netmeg.  Everyone LOVED it!!  I will make again and again!

This recipe was very good. I did reduce the sugar and butter and added a little nutmeg and cinnamon. It was delicious, still sweet but not too sweet. Thank you for the recipe. I will be making it often.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  At first I was not sure at all about a "carrot souffle" but just one taste and I was hooked!  For my variation I used half the recommended amount of sugar and used a natural raw sugar and added cinnamon.  It is naturally sweet but not so much that you can't used it as a side dish...  Truly amazing recipe!

I think I need to mash the carrots up more, but this was easy.  I was able to make most of it with a baby in my arms.  I liked it and I'll probably make it again.

I fully expected to mess this up, but was extremely pleased at how well it turned out. We ended up eating the souffle as dessert. I can only compare it to sweet potatoes, though that really doesn't do this dish justice. I look forward to the next potluck party - I'll be the talk of the room! Thank you, Louetta.

My husband and I loved this!  I wasn’t sure he would eat it because it’s made of cooked carrots. I read the other comments and wanted to cut the sugar. I used brown sugar Swerve. I think I only used about 1/4 cup or less. The carrots have a natural sweetness, so it was really tasty!  I will make this again.

Our family enjoyed this recipe and it was a great way to use our home canned carrots. Our change was to reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.

I made this, according to the recipe...no tweaks!!! it was really bad. The key to a great recipe is, it's great with NO tweaks. Terrible...very eggy...it was just not good. I read reviews...so many added nutmeg, all spice, cinnamon, brown sugar...AND THE FOOD PROCESSOR...A BIG BIG BIG DEAL!! I should have followed their tweaks! But, I read one reviewer that said...she added garlic and leeks, etc. That is NOT Carrot Souffle, that's another recipe!!Smh...Lol

Sweet? yes. Use a blender or food processor? yes. Cinnamon? yes. Try half carrots, half parsnips. This is sooo good I make the full recipe for 2 people so we can have it at lunch the next day. Or breakfast.

This was very good, although I made some changes suggested by other reviewers. I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar and reduced it by half. I also added some cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Finally, I mixed everything up in my food processor. It didn't rise very much, but still turned out flavorful, delicate, and was the perfect amount of sweetness. I'd definitely make this again.

This worked great after taking other reviewers' advice. I swapped applesauce for the butter with great results. I also used only 1/4 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet. I didn't even bother mashing my carrots, they just went straight into the blender with the applesauce. Then I put all the eggs in at once and quickly blended again (in an attempt to prevent scrambled egg bits). After that, I added the sifted dry ingredients and blended again. It turned out perfect!

Great way to use up excess carrots! My husband and I loved it. As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/3, added 1 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.

I made something similar-- warm carrot pudding-- and nutmeg pairs very well. Pumpkin pie spice or Allspice would probably be good too!

Great flavor and I really had a hard time believing I was eating carrots. I took the advice of several reviewers and cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup which, I believe, helped a lot.  In addition to this, I used a blender to really puree the carrots and mix the ingredients which i think was crucial.  

I would have to say the only change I would make would be to pick a different baking dish.  I used a 2 Qt rectangular pyrex but think a deeper, smaller dish would have been better.  

All in all a crowd pleaser and a side I will definitely be making again in the future!

I’ve made this a couple of times now and each time I followed other reviewers’ advice and cut the sugar by a third or half. It’s a huge hit and even my 1 year old likes it. Shhh... don’t tell him it’s carrots!

I make this all the time and it’s delicious!  I did reduce the sugar and did as another reviewer suggested and substituted 1/4 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. 

Recently I started a low carb, ketogenic diet. Even though carrots aren’t really low carb or keto, you can eat them in moderation. I decided I wanted to make this for Easter Sunday and here’s how I modified the recipe in case any one else is trying to cut the carbs. I substituted 1 tablespoon of coconut flour and 1 heaping teaspoon of almond flour for the 3 Tbsp of white flour,  and then added an extra egg. I also used 1/4 c of granulated Swerve sweetener and 1/4 c of Sukrin brown sugar substitute for the white sugar.   It turned out beautiful, and it tasted awesome!!  Now, I can eat this “veggie dessert” guilt free and my scales won’t budge!

Wonderful. Only change I made was using 1/2 cup sugar vs the 3/4 cup it called for.  Glad I did because it would have been way too sweet if I followed it as posted.  Could possibly cut back sugar even more. Would like to try again and make changes other posters tried  (brown sugar topping, cloves, cinnamon,  or other tweets to make it more savory) all in all, a wonderful recipe.

I only make 1/2 of this since I cook for two. I use brown sugar instead of the white (only 1/3 of cup), I use 2 brown eggs, and put in real butter.

I would've never thought that a pound of carrots would make such a delicious souffle.  It was fluffy, moist and delicious.  Like others, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, but forgot to put in more spices (like allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg), which it could use.  When I make it again, I'll do that, but I think it's great as is.  Definitely use the food processor, it makes a huge difference in the smoothness of the finished souffle.  By the way, I made this for my Rosh Hashona dinner (non-meat carrot Tzimmes) with Lamb, and Noodle Kugel.  Even my picky hubby loved this!

This is SO delicious! Family members who won't eat carrots not only ate this, but came back for seconds. Given the sugar in it, we also ate it separately after a meal as a dessert. I will be making this again tomorrow!

Made this today and with less the sugar as suggested and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. The hubby thought it tasted like pie filling. Will definitely make again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it fell before I could serve it. Not sure what I did wrong, bit still tasted good.

Excellent flavor, great presentation and pretty easy.  Watching calories, so I substituted applesauce for the oil and cut the sweetener back to 1/2 cup - 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 Splenda.  I've served it several times and got lots of compliments.

I did not read any of the reviews before making this. I had leftover short cut carrots, about 4 oz, and decided to do a test run. Cut all the ingredients by 3/4. Since I am nursing a post surgery right hand, I couldn't mash so I used my mini prep to mash the carrots. Well, let me tell you, I can't wait to make the full recipe. I agree with another poster that using a food processor would give it a better texture than mashing. Very delicious! And I too sprinkled a bit of cinnamon over the top.

This was awesome my husband kept asking if I was sure it was carrots.  I used 1/2 c sugar (next time will probably try even less and possibly brown sugar) and added about 1 t cinnamon.  Also pureed after parboiling.  Was almost like a dessert.  Might even try some nuts on top.

Excellent! This is my second time making this recipe. The first time I made the recipe as stated except I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Right out of the oven the dish was a bit too sweet. It was great for me and my family since we are all sweet tooth but, I wouldn't serve it to other guests with this much sugar. The leftovers however were absolutely perfect- the sugar settled and it didn't taste as sweet. The second time around I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon - also delicious and more palatable for guests who don't have a sweet tooth. This is a perfect dish that I will continue to make for many holiday dinners to come!

Very easy to make I used carrots that were already cut, next I will get the organic carrots and use less sugar. It was my first time making it and I love how  it turned out. I put a little brown sugar on top. 

I also used 1/4 of cup of truvia and the rest regular sugar and it still had a great taste.

I make this dish often.  I always use the food processor for mashing the carrots and blending prior to cooking.  It makes for a very smooth texture.  This sweet recipe is a great way to have veggies for dessert!

I added cinnamon, nutmeg and pureed everything in a food processor as well as cooking my carrots in a crockpot for 8 hours on low (once) and 4 hours on high (once).  Raves!!!

My first soufflé ever (75) and it turned out very well. Too sweet though and I will decrease sugar(Splenda) next time. Combined in food processor as some reviewers suggested.

I LOVED this recipe with some tweaks. I wanted a side dish instead of dessert, so I used someone's comment on making it savory: omit the vanilla and sugar completely and steam the carrot with garlic and leek (I used green onions instead of her leek). I used a hand mixer to mix everything, it left some chunky carrots but everything was so soft that it really didn't matter. Use a processor or blender if you want it really smooth, but I didn't find it necessary.

Wonderful delicious way to get good carrot vitamins, or use carrots that have lost their cosmetic beauty but are still healthy.  For "anti-carb" folks like me, it's fine to cut the amount of sugar in half.

Made this as written tonight. One child didn't care for it but the other child and adults did. While this was delicious, the sugar content made it more of a dessert than a side. I will be cutting back the sugar next time I make it. Also, I used a bag of baby carrots and boiled them for about thirty minutes. I despise trying to chop carrots. I used the boiling time for laundry and prep on other dishes. I will not move this recipe into my regular rotation, but I will definitely make it occasionally to mix things up a bit.

Awesome!! My new favorite side. I followed some previous suggestions. First off, I used 1/3 white and 1/3 brown sugar. Added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Used my immersion blender before adding flour and sugar mixture. Turned out perfect! Even my picky 5 yr old and my picky hubby loved it!! Would make a great side for a holiday meal, but easy enough to make anytime.

Made this for Easter today ! Was a huge hit with the family. Everyone who likes carrots tried it & absolutely loved it. I will definitely be using this recipe again. The only changes I made was, I made this for 12 instead of the basic 6 servings. I left a few lumps instead of blending it completely smooth. Also I used 1 cup of sugar instead of the 1 1\2 it called for after reading the other reviews. It was a sweet dish but not over powering dessert sweet when I cut back just a bit.  We give this recipe A+++ definitely a 5 star keeper ! Thank you Louetta, keep up the great recipe posts !

I just made the carrot soufflé for the first time, and I just took it out of the oven.  It  looks so good, I had to take a picture right away and post!  We haven't eaten it yet, but if it tastes half as good as it smells, I am happy!

Delish! After reading the other reviews I went ahead and cut the sugar to 1/3cup. I also boiled the carrots until fork tender then put them in the food processer. I added the butter, vanilla, & sugar. I cracked the eggs into a bowl & tempered them. After that I added the eggs to the mixture in the food processer as well as the rest of the ingredients. It was so easy, and yummy!

I was inspired to find a recipe after my roommate had me try some carrot soufflé she'd brought home from a function. Best decision ever! I had all the ingredients on hand. I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar because I didn't want it to be too sweet. It came out perfect!

Big hit in our house.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar as others recommended; I have a serious sweet tooth and it was plenty.  Next time I will use less butter.  I think I lost some of the "pound" of carrots in peeling, so it ended up a bit too soft and delicious (and unhealthy :)  Will definitely be making this frequently as a side--it was easy to put together and baked perfectly (and I'm at altitude).

I personally think it is a little too sweet for my tastes, but I make it all the time because my husband and daughters LOVE it.  It is the only way I can get my youngest daughter to eat carrots.  I do use canned carrots, as opposed to fresh, because they take less time to heat and mash to a smooth consistency.

I made this recipe last night for some dinner guests. I wanted something that would pair nicely with blackened salmon and wild rice for a variety of textures. Surprisingly the carrot souffle received the most praise.People loved it!  I wasn't pleased that the souffle didn't rise like a true souffle, but the taste was wonderful.

This is my first Souffle I've ever cooked OR Eaten. It came out very nice and my brother and I enjoyed it. I did what another reviewer said and cut the sugar a bit and also added a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar. Next time I'll try it with the full amount of sugar to see the difference. Great recipe!

This was wonderful.  I used 1/2 the amount of sugar and butter. I cooked baby carrots for about 40mins and then pureed it with the butter.  It came out perfectly smooth.  Might try a little more flour as it wasn't as firm as I would have liked.  Will definitely make again with these modifications.

Incredible. I'll use 1/2 Cup sugar next time but even as written it's not overly sweet. The only substitution I made was brown rice flour to fit our dietary needs. No spices needed but I'm sure they would work well. As soon as my husband tasted it he was taken back 30 years to a dish his mom used to make. He hasn't figured it out yet but it wasn't carrot souffle :) I'll make this again for sure.

YOWZA was this sweet!  Next time I will cut way back on the sugar. I got mixed reviews on this one. Overall good, just sweet. Another comment I got was that this was more of a carrot casserole, not a carrot souffle.

I have made my Carrot Soufflé for years, its always a hit!!! Using canned carrots is no tastier than fresh. Actually so simple to make.  I only use 1/4- 1/3 cup of sugar. I add some nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice.  Kids think they are eating cake!   DishyGal

I love this recipe.  When my children come home from college they ask me to make this.  Like the other reviewers I too decrease the amount of sugar.  However, I leave out the  salt and add 1/2 tsp of coconut flavoring.  Try it, you'll like it!

I tried this recipe just as it says and I thought it was delicious.  I read some other reviews and next time I might cut back a little on the sugar. This dish is very appealing to the eye as well.

I was doubtful about trying this recipe, but I made it and thought it was quite tasty. My husband, who also was doubtful, liked it as well.
