This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I prepared it using rock shrimp and it speed up the process since I didn't not have to peel or devein the shrimp.

Yummy!  I've made this three times and everyone loves it.  We like it spicy but if you don't you'll definitely need to ease up on the peppers.  Also, I measured all ingredients precisely and I found that there was not sufficient flour to thicken into a gravy.  I added a small flour and water mixture just before adding the veggies so that I had the right consistency. (This is no problem for me as I'm more of a 'throw it all in without measuring' kind of cook anyway, which was is just what I did after the first preparation)  I found that it took me longer than the estimated times, but maybe the estimate assumes vegetables chopped, ingredients measured and waiting, etc.  Also, instead of fish stock, I just took the shells from the shrimp I was already using and made shrimp stock and used that.  Maybe it's better with the fish stock but I thought this was delicious and time-saving for me.  Give it a try!

Outstanding! Good luck finding fish stock at the store, so I used vegetable broth instead and it was great. I love New Orleans style cuisine and this fit the bill. I found myself adding a little extra flour and a little cornstarch to thicken the gravy. Thanks Sylvia.

It took a bit more time but I made the fish stock with my shrimp shells and tails. I flavored the stock with onions, celery, garlic and bay leaf. I did notice by the time I came to adding the beer that I was going to have too much liquid for the amount of vegetables and shrimp and my sauce was already a nice thickness, so I left half the beer out. I did coat my shrimp with my favorite creole seasoning and let it marinate before adding it in. I served over a bowl of creamy Southern grits.

Wow, was this fantastic!  We live in Texas and eat alot of Cajun/Creole food and this recipe was amazing.  Super easy, quick and once again fantastic.  A must try. I just wanted to add we added more hot pepper to make it a little spicer.  We have spicy taste.

This was alright.  My hubby absolutely loved it, and I will admit that the shrimp was quite good.  I had to substitute jalapenos for the hot red pepper, and I added the spicy carrots from the can of jalapenos.  It was good, nice and spicy, but maybe I'd like it better with the red peppers.  Color can make a world of difference!

Not as good as I had hoped.  The "gravy" did not form so I used a little cornstarch.  Then it was very thick and had little taste. Maybe a more traditional roux would add depth to the flavor.  Will try again with a darker roux.

I thought this was very good although spicier than I thought it would be. Next time maybe I'll only use 1/2 a green pepper - the man didn't like that so much.  I served it with dirty rice which was a great compliment.  Thanks!

Really yummy. This is the first time that I ever made a roux. I screwed it up a little so it was a little lumpy, but I just kept whisking until it went smooth. I added hot chili paste to the veggies after I cooked them, and I added crushed red pepper flake in the roux when i added the salt and pepper.  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it thoroughly.

This recipe is delicious...I have cooked it quite a few times both for family and guests. It always wows. I had to play with making the roue, but I think I now finally have it right. I will make this one again. Bernadette

Very good indeed. Only changes: I used week chicken stock, because fish stock cubes aren't available in my neckadawoods, and the shrimp I used were frozen-shelled, so I couldn't make stock with the shells. I also upped the butter to 1/4 cup to match the flour, because the proportions in the recipe seemed odd to me. Served it on steamed white rice. Very nice meal.

The only flavor this had was the red pepper flakes.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.

I added a whole cup of flour with the bacon drippings for the roux and it took a little over 30 minutes to get that beautiful mahogany color.  Will definitely make again.  Great flavor.

Instead of fish stock, I just took the shells from the shrimp I was already using and made shrimp stock, seasoned w/onions, celery,  green pepper and salt & pepper. then strained through a fine mesh strainer.  Served over cooked white long grain rice.
