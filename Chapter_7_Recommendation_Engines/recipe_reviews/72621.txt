Wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  It was sooooo good.  I let the chicken marintate in the yogurt suace for 24 hours and it came out so moist and juicy.  Also, to the sauce I added a splash of tabasco and garnished with a sprinkling of chili powder for some extra zing (I like spicy food).  The cinnamon tasted so interesting in the sauce.  Next time, I think I might try peach yogurt and serve it with a peach-mango chutney or something of that nature.  Thanks so much for recipe, chef single dad!  You rock!

Had been looking for a recipe 'Chicken with strawberries and cream' for year. This was the closest I found. I followed the recipe and then served with rice and a dollop of sour cream. PERFECT.

This was an excellent recipe!  I mashed freash stawberries into vanilla yogurt and I found that it really helped to bring out the flavor.  Give the sauce lots of time to thicken so the flavour becomes concentrated.

Incredible recipe. Definetly let this marinade for a day so that you can truly enjoy the flavor. This dish is easy to prepare and will make you look like a better cook.

Was certainly different, but it tasted strongly of cinnamon.  I scaled the proportions for 2 chicken breasts and followed the directions exactly.  I marinaded it for 3 hours because that's all the time I had.  I didn't omit or change anything.  Looked really pretty, even though I forgot to slice the chicken at the end.  I did drizzle some GLAZED balsamic vinegar on top because we like balsamic, but I'm not sure I'll make this again.  Both my husband and I gave it 3 stars.

This is very good chicken recipe! I cooked it according to the instructions, and used the "Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes" recipe as a side dish.

Mad props on the wonderful yumminess of this recipe.  Very easy for a cook of my novice skills, this was a wonderful dinner that was nicely complemented by a strawberry spinach salad.

All you could taste was the pepper. It was almost inedible. I wouldn't make this again. I feel like I must have done something wrong because of all the positive reviews, but I triple checked everything before adding it. I'm a bit obsessive that way.

Nice flavor, I was surprised because the cinnamon and strawberry yogurt neutralize the acidity of the balsamic vinegar. I did marinate for 24 hours which I do think is needed to get the right flavor.

This recipe was great. I did do things a little differently though. I cut the chicken into smaller strips and I didn't scrape the marinade off of the chicken when I cooked it in the pan. I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray instead of using oil. The marinade sort of caramelized on the outside of the chicken and was delicious. I set aside a cup of the marinade to make the sauce out of, since I didn't feel safe using the marinade that had been with the raw chicken. In a sauce pan I cooked down some fresh cut strawberries and chopped fresh mint, then added the cup of reserved marinade to the sauce pan. I cooked this over moderate heat for around five minutes. I mixed 1 Tblsp of flour with some cold water and added that to the sauce to thicken it  up. I put more chopped strawberries and mint along with a sprinkle of lemon juice over the chicken and sauce once it was plated. I think it was a little spicy for my taste and I will use a little less black pepper next time around.

The sauce was too thick and general kind of gross.  I guess I should have anticipated this because I do not like recipes with cooked dairy products in it. Not making again

I halved the marinade, and substituted lain yogurt for half of the yogurt. Also, I added no sugar. In other words, because of what others had commented, and because my husband is not wild about sweet sauce on meat, I made this significantly less sweet. I also cut the pepper in half as I'm not a fan of a lot of pepper. It came out completely delicious. The strawberry flavor goes great with the marinade and the chicken. We enjoyed it with salad, rice, and baklava for dessert.

Good stuff! This was a very different tasting dish and my fiance and I really enjoyed it. If anything, it was just a bit too candy-ish for our taste, but definitely worth trying. I wonder if using plain yogurt with real strawberries would change the flavor up a bit.

Good but a bit sweet for me, however my guests couldn't stop raving about this dish and took the recipe with them. I served this as the main dish with the "Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes" recipe and some fresh strawberry salsa, garlic bread and salad for lunch and it was a HUGE hit!  Everyone kept talking about the wonderful arromas coming from the kitchen while just prepping these dishes.  Also, my guests kept talking about how it was such a fancy looking dish just for lunch.  Next time I'm going to pretend like I slaved for hours to make this.  =)

I made this recipe twice.  The first time there was too much pepper in it for me.  The second time I only used 3/4 pepper and it was phenomenal.  I used the variation mentioned in the introduction about marinating it for 24 hours first in the sauce.  My family loves eating a bite of chicken with the sauce on and then a bit of the strawberry slice.  It's a great flavor combination.

Delicious! I did change the yoghurt to plain & only 1 cup, used fresh strawberries too.   For a spicy tangy taste use chipotle salsa.  I went very light on the cinnamon too based on other reviews.  Instead of olive oil, I suggest butter (think strawberries foster!) and brown sugar instead of light.  A lot of changes but worth the result.

Great flavor!  However, I think it would be just as good with half the sauce... there was A LOT.  Will make again, for sure!

The most delicious sauce EVER.  I used a strawberry-basil balsamic vinegar that I found at Target, so mine may have been even better because of this.  I cut the recipe in half, but used only one Yoplait Greek 100 Mixed Berry yogurt for the yogurt part.  I also added about 1Tbsp of extra white sugar after reducing it and cooked that in.  I literally wanted to just lick up the sauce after I reduced it.  Instead of just serving it on the chicken next time, I think I'm gonna made rice so that I can get as much of the sauce as possible!

This recipe was very easy to follow, and turned out great.  The only changes I made were used dried parsley and dried mint instead of fresh.  There was a lot of sauce/marinade left over, so next time I think I will use more chicken.

Substituted plain Greek yogurt for strawberry yogurt, and very expensive strawberry balsamic vinegar for standard balsamic. Marinated chicken overnight. My husband insisted this was the worst meal I've prepared in years (30). We did enjoy a good laugh over dinner though...No left overs saved tonight!

I followed the recipe exactly except I let the chicken marinate in the sauce for 24 hours like other reviewers suggested and it came out perfect! My husband LOVED it and didn't even want to save his other piece for work because he wanted to eat it all in one sitting. Thanks for the recipe, we will definitely make this again soon!

WOW!  The recipe sounds a little odd but it's really good!  I ended up having to hold up dinner awhile so I ended up cooking the chicken on low for an hour, and gave the sauce a chance to really thicken, it was really good!

Really was not very flavorful and bland.  I marinated for 8 hours, even cut in really thin strips for better marinade penetration. Would not make again, since neither my husband nor I liked it.

I loved this!  I didn't have enough balsamic vinegar on hand so I used half balsamic and half red wine vinegar.  The only things I would do differently next time is not use quite as much pepper--the amount seemed to take away a little from the other flavors.  Also, the marinade makes so much, I would half it.

Tastes good - looks ugly. I only used 2 of the 8 oz. containers of yogurt because it seemed that 4 would make an awful lot of marinade. The look of the yogurt combined with the dark brown vinegar made a very unappetizing color of sauce. I would never serve this to guests because of its appearance, but I have to say it tasted very good.

Wish I could give zero stars. I’m pretty sure that’s a typo on the amount of pepper. A tablespoon completely ruins the entire dish. (A teaspoon perhaps?) I just spent a day marinating the chicken in the yogurt mixture, cooked the chicken today and the amount of pepper has made this dish disgusting! What a waste. :(

I used the exact ingredients, however, I marinated wings in it, then just baked the whole thing. One of the stranger things I've made, but when your 3 year old asks for strawberry wings, you figure something out, and the kids were more than happy with them.  They actually turned out better than I expected. Will make again.

It was so bright and light.  Our picky eaters gobbled it up and asked for more!   Definitely a new "go-to" dish!   To make our post-workday life easier, we started the marinade the night before.  That way, we just had to get home, pull it out of the sauce and cook it up.  Fantastic!!

This was....very different. The flavor was unexpected and at first, I didn't think I liked it. But it snuck up on me, and by the time dinner was over, I was wishing there was more.

There are better ways to incorporate fruit yogurt in a savory dish.  I didn't really care for this recipe.  I'll try to finish it by making a spinach salad or maybe adding some basalmic vinegar onions and mushrooms and stuffing it into a pita with some spinach.  Just not a fan.  The reviewer who noted that it was too pepper-y are right on.

This recipe was HORRIBLE.  The strawberry yogurt came out all artificial/chemically smelling/tasting.  I couldn't stand the smell, much less actually eat it.

Very Good. I thought it was a bit spicy due to the cinnamon but my husband loved it. I needed the fresh strawberry's to cool the spicy taste, but it was very very good. I will make it again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This wasn't BAD, but don't know that I'd make it regularly. It seemed a bit 'sweet' to me.  Quite gourmet, though.
