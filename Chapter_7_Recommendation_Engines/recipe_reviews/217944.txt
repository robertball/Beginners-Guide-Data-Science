I love Kale and I use this method often.  I eat a lot of Kale, and unless its fresh from the garden (usually after the first frost), I tend to cook it for around 15 minutes to prevent it tasting rubbery.  First if I have a large bunch of kale I'll thinly slice a whole bulb of garlic, because I love garlic.  If I add the garlic first, it burns, so I cook the kale for a good 10 minutes before adding the garlic.  To cut down on oil, I'll cut up the kale and then rinse it off in the strainer.  I use the water left on the kale leaves combined with a dash of oil to saute it.  And finally I add some salt and pepper.

This was the first time I cooked kale. I was given two bunches of it. I wasn't sure what to expect because I had never eaten any either. I followed the recipe to the tee. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I also loved the simplicity of the recipe. I made it as a side to go with Italian meatballs and penne marinara. I sauteed mushrooms also. My family LOVED it. The combination of the mushrooms and garlic kale together was awesome. Everyone enjoyed it leftover the next day.

I use this all the time but slight variations- if you steam the kale first it takesm more of the bitterness out. Also, I like to sauté until crispier, and add red pepper flakes for a little heat!

GREAT TIP for GARLIC LoVerS!!  Smash garlic cloves only ( do not chop )  Add olive oil to warm pan (med low) add smashed garlic and watch closely sauté garlic until just when it starts to turn brown.  Remove garlic with slotted spoon to cutting board and chop it after it cools.   Add the kale to pan and turn up heat just a bit. When kale almost done add garlic.  Garlic won't burn this way!!!!  Yummy recipe!

I used this recipe for the first time I cooked kale (tonight).  I'd never had it before so I wasn't sure what to expect, flavour-wise.  I put this as a side dish with oven-baked chicken legs and it turned out very nicely.

Warning to any new to kale: it's rather bitter and has a similar taste/testure to spinach.  

This was incredibly easy and flavourful so I will *definitely* make it again.  Next time, I will make a couple changes:
1. 6 cloves of garlic, added AFTER the kale (when you add garlic first, you risk burning and wrecking the flavour; it is MUCH tastier when added in the last 1-2 mins when cooking it by sautee).  Like some others, I just prefer more garlic.
2. Adding some salt or sugar to offset the bitterness.  I may try steaming (as others suggested) by putting the kale in a microwave-safe dish with a little water for a few minutes (I need to buy a new steamer and I keep forgetting).

Only change I made to this recipe tonight was adding a bit more oil, because I cooked it in a large skillet instead of a saucepan for the larger surface area.

Excellent!  It was easy and fast.  I prepared it exactly like the instructions and then did a sqeeze of lemon over it as I served it.  Yum!

This was great, and so easy!  I don't mind eating the stems (the part of the stem that contains the leaves, not the bare stalk part), so I just chop the leaves and stem without removing the leaves.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! First time eating kale, and I am in love!  I ended up adding about a half cup of chicken broth, and covering to let the kale steam for a few minutes.  I think this really let the garlic flavors get into the steam also, as the broth condensed!  Totally delicious!!

This was so so yummy and so easy!! I did throw the kale in first and then the garlic, like one of the reviewers suggested. I loved it and will definitely make again.

Good!  I used about 1/2 cup chopped onions, and sauteed them for about 5 min before adding the kale (2/3 bag of pre-chopped kale).  With the kale, I added about 1/2 cup water and let the kale steam with the lid on the pan.  After it softened, I drained it and added the garlic, a little sea salt, fresh ground pepper, and squeezed about 1/2 a fresh lemon over the top and cooked for about a minute or two.  I removed it from the heat and added about a cup of canellini beans and some freshly shredded asiago cheese.

**odd note!***

Along with this dish I made a Caprese salad, which included a balsamic reduction made from 1 cup balsamic vinegar brought to a boil with 1/3 cup honey, and then reduced the heat and simmered about 10 min until the sauce was reduced to about 1/3 cup.  This sauce accidentally seeped into the garlic kale and was AMAZING on it!  I will definitely make it that way in the future!

I liked this easy kale recipe. At end I added about 1 teaspoon water, covered and let it steam about a minute. Flavor variation: instead of olive oil, brown a couple slices of good quality bacon, chopped. Proceed as in recipe leaving the bacon bits in for flavor and texture.

I was nervous as I'd never had Kale before, but we all loved this.  Unfortunately I let it sit too long and it did get a bit crunchy, but we still enjoyed it.  Definitely tastey at the 10 minute mark when I tested it.  I used 2 tablespoons of Avacado Oil (Olivado is the brand name) in place of olive oil.  I also used my garlic press for the 4 cloves and added them in the last 3 minutes of cooking or so.  Very good.  My picky almost 7 year old ate his entire serving.  We will definitely be making again!

Easy, minimal ingredients.  Use triple washed, bagged, chopped kale for ease of use.

I usually steam kale or throw it into a stir fry. So this lovely quick and simple recipe made a nice change. "Do I like kale?" my husband asked looking at me suspiciously over the top of his glasses. After eating it cooked this way he had to agree with me that he does. I will be cooking kale this way again just adding a few grindings of black pepper. Thankyou Demara.

This was delicious!  I took the suggestion of steaming the kale in a pyrex bowl/lid in the microwave for 3 minutes before sauteeing.  I also chose to use bacon grease rather than olive oil, salt & pepper to taste, and I cooked it in a cast iron skillet. It was awesome and not bitter at all!

I added more garlic & put it all in after sautéing the kale for about 5 minutes in bacon grease.  I added sea salt, kelp powder and creole seasoning.  I also added shrimp and chicken broth and steamed an additional 10 minutes.  I know that's a lot of changes, but I love it!

An awesome way to get your veggies. I used someone's suggestion and added a little sea salt and some parmesan cheese. It definitely could have had an extra something though. I will be adding to it next time, but not sure what yet.

As written, this recipe was OK but not great.  When cooked as directed, the kale (very fresh, organic) was tough and unpleasant to eat.  When I realized this, I took the tip of another reviewer and added water and cooked the kale another 15 minutes until it had softened enough to enjoy.  If you cook the kale only until "bright green and wilted" you will be eating a very chewy dish.

COOKED THIS RECIPE YESTERDAY. AND IT WAS AMAZING!! THE GARLIC REALLY GIVES IT A KICK! TRY BLENDED UP THE GARLIC,  THAT REALLY BRINGS OUT THE FLAVOR IN THE KALE.

As is, I give this 3 stars.  It was a little bland, so I finished it off with a little drizzle of olive oil, a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, and a couple of grinds of sea salt and black pepper.  With those additions, it was delicious.

This was my first time cooking with kale, so I was really just looking for some basic cooking instructions in this recipe. The preparation in this recipe is perfect. I am really just learning to cook, so a "bunch" of kale doesn't mean a lot to me. I used about 1.5-2 cups and it was not enough. The kale really cooks down, so I would probably double that amount the next time I make this. I didn't have quite the same ingredients, so I ended up doing this a little differently. I heated up 2 TBSP of olive oil and tore the leaves from the large stalks as described, and cooked the kale for about five minutes. Once the kale began to get slightly tender I added a crushed, dried, chili pepper, and about 1 TBSP of minced garlic (jarred, pre-minced), and let that cook for five more minutes. The texture was perfect and the flavor was amazing, with none of the typical kale bitterness present.

I love kale, and this is a nice easy recipe for it. I add a little soy sauce for a bit more flavor and saltiness, but otherwise prepare exactly as the recipe states. Just made this again last night; yum!

I had to cook the kale for about 15 min. before it wilted enough for it to be chewable even after adding chicken stock and covering it to help steam it after the initial 5 min of sauteing.  The garlic helped the flavor (which I added after 5 min like others suggested) but in the end my family didn't like it though I felt it was ok.

A great way to make kale tasty. I ended up adding a litttle bit of water and covered the pan for a few minutes until the kale wilted. Had it with grilled shrimp. Yum!

Ive found that the trick with kale is to boil it to get rid of the bitter taste first. Unless u like the bitter taste then enjoy.

After hearing so much about kale I decided to cook some. I really like it. I just added a little sea salt for flavor. I aslo added a little water because it started to burn and threw in some crushed red pepper.

I am still learning to love kale. Using 6 cloves of garlic, a little salt & pepper, and cooking slowly seems to help. Don't let your greens turn brown- it makes them chalky. Next time I'll try steaming them, as suggested below, to reduce kale's bitterness.

This was good!  I did sprinkle a little white sugar on it at the end.  I learned that from a Chinese cook.  It takes the bitterness out.  I just do it to taste, like salt.  The garlic turned out so delicious!  We did it just as described in recipe- no slicing or anything.  My hubby's been begging for roasted garlic and this garlic was the next best thing!  Thanks for this recipe- printing and saving now:)

Sorry to the creator of this for giving it so few stars. Maybe it's scrumptious to kale-lovers. I'd advise those who haven't yet determined whether they like kale yet or not to make a very small batch. If you don't like it but you want to consume kale for health purposes, you can throw it in a blender with apple, banana, avocado, spinach, a little water and ice and (if you like things a little sweeter), some honey or stevia. This recipe is even delicious if you DON'T like kale.

Used 1/2 bag prewashed cut up kale. Sauteed it with a little oil and water for 10 min. before adding minced garlic. Then cooked for about 10 more minutes. Added 1-2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, then a dash of lemon juice. Yum, yum!

I thought this recipe was quick and simple but had alot of flavor. I can't help but feel like there is something missing though. On my next go around I will try adding some spices that might brighten it up. All in all very tasty though.

Oh my gosh!!  I've never had kale before but my friend was telling me about these kale chips that her brother had made, so i thought I'd try it.  They were fabulous!  Highly recommend!  I wanted to try this recipe with the other half of the bunch and I am so glad that I did!!!  This is my new favorite thing!!!  Thanks for this recipe!!  Easy and delicous!!   I used some canola spray also but nothing is actually necessary!  It's fabulous!

Delicious and easy!  I sauteed the kale in a non-stick pan with about 1t of oil, then added 1t garlic powder (I was out of garlic) and about 1/4c chicken broth and put a lid on it.  I cooked it for about 15 minutes on low heat, but I think the length of time you cook it is a matter of personal preference.

I cooked Kale this way but added a little twist that I use with broccoli. I use half olive oil and half butter for the fat, and I saute garlic and rosemary together, then toss the kale in and let it wilt for about 5 minutes, and I think I will try adding the lemon as well for a Mediterranean flavor, next time.

So incredibly easy and really good!  I sauteed the kale first, then added the garlic as suggested by others. If you massage the kale a little before adding to the skillet, it does make the leaves more tender and you don;t have to cook it very long at all.  A sprinkle of Parmesan cheese is a wonderful addition at the end.

VERY garlicky, but very good. I added salt and a bit of pepper. Would also be good with a bit of Parmesan cheese.

First time I've ever had kale, this was delicious!  Only thing I did different was to cook it with my chicken.  Cubed the chicken, cooked it in olive oil and garlic, threw in the kale near the end.  Also seasoned with Mediterranean seasoning.  Great recipe for 21 Day Fix!

I made this tonight and added some fresh spinach as well!  It was very tasty!  I also added some sea salt.  I think next time I'll add the red pepper flakes for some kick.  I didn't have any today.

This is my first encounter with cooking kale. I had some in our fridge and had tasted a leaf raw and it was very peppery. A few days later I tried it again (same area on the leaf) and it had mellowed out to being a strong broccoli-stalk like flavor. (I have read before that many lettuces turn bitter after/during the hottest part of the summer and they mellow if kept in the fridge 2-3 days before consuming). I was drawn to this recipe because we love garlic and I thought it might help us to acquire a taste for including kale in our diet.  I cooked it exactly as specified in the recipe. My husband loved it, the kids and myself forced ourselves to eat it. IMO, it wasn't horrible, just very strong and not something I could eat on its own as a side dish. I had made fried potatoes with bite-size meat, so stirring about 2 T. of this kale into the mix made it easier for me to tolerate. The only reason I'll make it again is because we have a tortoise who eats kale, but doesn't eat as much as what comes in the bundle. I can't bring myself to toss out the 'extra' so we'lll keep trying. It's healthy at least!

This was our first attempt with Kale. Used lots of garlic because I wasn't sure of the taste. It does take some getting use to but the extra garlic helped..

SO happy I tried this simple alternative to 'something green' for New Year's : ) - I used the pre-washed, bagged kale, steamed it a bit first, then followed recipe (crushing the sliced garlic and letting it sit out for a bit first - read that is somehow the 'healthiest' way to cook with garlic?) I was fully prepared for bitterness, but this was excellent - just a simple garlic taste (with a touch of salt that I added at the end.) Given how healthy kale is, I can't wait to make more of this!

I seriously love this recipe. So simple, but sooo good. I always end up eating most of my portion while I am cooking the main dish. I follow other reviewers' advice and steam the kale first for about 5 minutes, until it is bright green. I also add a bit of salt at the table. They're also good without salt, but with is even better!

I bought a large bag of kale and have been trying to get myself to like it by trying different recipes. I thought this looked simple enough. I thought 1 bunch was vague, so I measured out 2 cups and then halved the olive oil and garlic. It made 2 small servings. I also sliced instead of minced the garlic which is easier. I thought this kind of tastes like spinach, but still has a slight tough and crunchier texture. I also added a small pinch of salt. I may make this again, unless I find a recipe that just softens it up a tad more.

I add about a cup of chicken or beef broth to the kale as it cooks so that the leaves soften. Cook about 15 additional minutes covered.

My family loved it. My son is finicky and I'm trying to get him to eat more vegetables, so it was a win. I used avocado oil instead of olive oil and added about 1/2 -3/4 cup of chicken stock.  Will be making it again.

I sauteed mushrooms in butter first, then added a bit of olive oil and the kale and cooked for probably more like 7-10 minutes. I added a splash of chicken broth after about 5 minutes to steam in a bit more flavor. I sprinkled garlic & pepper seasoning.

Kale can be gross. This makes it great! Using fresh from the farmer's market helps, too. Sliced some "baby 'bella" mushrooms and added after the garlic and let them start giving off their liquid before adding the kale. Will make again.

Loved it. I did add a little more garlic to it because we LOVE garlic in my home. :-)

Yes kale is bitter so those of you who don't know it.. youknow it now :) This is a very simple recipe but a little water should be sprinkled onto the leaves...just a bit along with a sprinkle of salt. Also the pan should be covered once the leaves are added.

I grow kale but have to work to like it.  Making the garlic crispy in the oil then adding shredded kale and only stir frying it until bright green made it actually good tasting.

The garlic browned nicely, but a little overcooked.

 You can never go wrong with sautéed vegetables.

This is how I cook all my greens (except collards); it's very Italian! Spinach and escarole are so tender and full of water that a simple sauté takes only a few minutes. Kale and chard can be tougher, so I use the steam-and-sauté method. Sauté  the greens in the olive oil and garlic until they wilt down a bit, then add a little water and cover. I add salt and pepper when I add the water. When the greens are tender, uncover and let any remaining water evaporate.

Nothing new here...but a nice way to cook greens in general. Doesn't need too much oil, maybe a little less than called for, butter works well too. I recently learned about massaging Kale first...AND IT'S TRUE. It WAS less bitter, it DID reduce in volume...my new favorite thing to do to Kale to overcome the bitterness. I'll eat more as a result. Could add Red Pepper Flakes if you like heat (cook it in the oil before adding the greens). A little Kosher salt and ground black pepper during the cooking process adds flavor. I pulled the garlic out of the oil and added more later as suggested.

I thought this was pretty good! I did add some sauteed onions, which I think only helped the flavor! I added a pinch of salt and a pinch of garlic powder but overall this was delicious.

The recipe needs one tablespoon, or less to your taste, of balsamic vinegar (or any other vinegar to your taste) This will cut down on the bitterness.

This is the first time I have ever cooked and/or eaten Kale. This recipe was quick and the flavor delicious. I did add a pinch of sugar, kosher salt, and a little lemon. Personally, I need to cook the kale for at least 10-15 minutes because my husband and I both prefer a texture more like spinach.

Cut off the stems. Massage with a little olive oil first. Then steam the kale for 8 minutes.. Let cool,  follow the recipe and add a shake of sea salt, Parmesan cheese and lemon juice at the table.

I like this recipe but I make it with a slight variation - after making it as the recipe states, I squeeze a small lemon wedge over the cooked kale and add a splash of soy sauce. I could eat it every day!

This is the first time I have ate or cooked kale, we are believers! I used baby kale and baby spinach bc I didn't have enough baby kale. I did not have to steam or massage salt into leaves bc the baby Kale is tender and not the slightest bitter. I used a hot heavy cast iron skillet and added bacon drippings and added 4 cloves smashed garlic to pan over medium heat. Cook until slightly tan and remove from pan, this infuses drippings with garlicky goodness, then I added 8 oz of sliced mushrooms and caramelized. Then I added 5 oz  Kale and 8 oz spinach, bc that is what I had on hand, I  sautéed greens until wilted and sprinkled liberally with coarse kosher salt. Last 5 minutes I grated 4 large garlic cloves, this allows the garlic time to cook some of the raw flavor out, mellowing slightly, yet not so much you miss that garlic flavor you crave. Once I added the greens to serving bowl I squeezed a lemon wedge over to give the greens a little brightness. We devoured, devoured them! My husband was rooting thru the fridge for left-overs, and asked that I make this side dish regularly. We are now Kale converts! :)

This recipe is so easy it's very difficult to make mistakes.  The amount of garlic is probably okay for most people but I doubled it as we enjoy a stronger garlic kick.  It's made so quickly that it's a great side dish to prepare at the last minute when meat is resting and/or other dishes are in their final stage but don't need attention.  And of course there are few foods which have more good things for you than kale.

Very good, I do feel it needs salt and pepper though.  I don't normally write 5 stars if I feel it needs changes, but I think this was written "healthier" and salt was omitted.  I would make this again!

Garlic Kale Haiku: "Easy, super-fast! I'll eat kale most any way, just needed some salt." A simple and fool-proof method for preparing this healthy and quick side dish. Just needed some salt, and in my case, a splash of hot sauce. But I like a little torch in all my food. Thanks for the recipe, Demara!

Very good and quick to make. There are several varieties of kale and some may be more bitter than others. I have the real curly kind and don't find it bitter, but it is surely a matter of taste. I picked this very young and tender out of my garden and plan to try to stay ahead of it this year.
I saute'd mine in the same pan that I had fried hamburgers in earlier and the meat drippings and bits of stuff just added to the flavor. I also used chopped garlic that I got in a quart jar at the grocery store. It seems to keep forever and it is a time saver.

This is one of the simplest ways to prepare kale.  I've done this forever.  As for the garlic, if you want a stronger garlic flavor, mince the garlic.  For a milder taste, crush it and remove it when finished cooking the kale.

I've been making this for quite some time.  I usually add red pepper flakes, or at least set a shaker on the table so each person can use whatever amount they want.  This is so delishes!

We often have spinach prepared this same way - kale prepared like this tasted very much like the spinach. I made the recipe just as written and came out great!

Really enjoyed this dish.  Love that it has such few ingredients and tastes so good.  I did add sea salt and fresh ground pepper, but that was the only change I made.  Thanks for sharing, I will make this again.

this was quick and simple, though the "bunch" of Kale was difficult to measure... I just used about 2 cups. I also didn't need to cook it that long, maybe 3.5 minutes instead of 5. It worked out well, and I enjoyed it, though my husband wasn't a fan.

Thanks for sharing.  Preparded 1 pound of kale per your recipe and added an onion.  Additional cooking time was required...but...The results were worth the wait. 

Since I'm cooking for 2,  I reserved some to make soup by adding kielbasa, carrots, onions, cannoli beans, potatoes and chicken stock that I already had on hand.

It's no use.  I keep trying because of kale's health benefits but I just don't like it!

I make spinach this way a lot. Had never tried Kale, I'm so glad I did. We loved it. It didn't wilt away the way spinach does.

Just a pinch of Sugar In The Raw and a bit of Salt is all i added. I used a garlic paste because I did not have a fresh clove. It came out almost bitter sweet and buttery. I paired it with simple lemon chicken. AMAING!

This was my first experience with kale. Thank you for this quick and easy recipe; it showed erased my trepidation about trying to cook with it. My only complaint was that it was still very crunchy. Since it was my first time cooking with it I'm not sure if that is how kale is or if it wasn't cooked long enough.
