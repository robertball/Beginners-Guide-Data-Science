Interesting!  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I had to wing it w/the caramel.  While mine didn't look/coat the best, it tasted good.  The licorice and pretzels add an interesting twist to the usual caramel corn, though, I can't decide how I feel about the Twizz; it varies from bite to bite...  THANKS for the recipe!
