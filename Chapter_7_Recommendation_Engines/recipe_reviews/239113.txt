This is an easy way to enjoy a butter tart! Not as pretty as a traditional tartlet, but so quick and easy with no fuss of rolling out a pastry. I followed the recipe exactly, and while it's tastes like 5 stars there are a couple things I would change. First, don't mix the raisons into the filling. I found I had to spread the raisons around to get them even and it started to tear the pastry! Just sprinkle the raisons on the crust before pouring the filling on. If you're using a non-stick pan, overhang a layer of parchment paper so you can lift and cut the squares without cut marks in your pan. Otherwise a fantastic treat, thanks to Billy Boy!

Tastes good, make sure to put extra butter in bottom layer as it is crumbly. Do not overcook top layer as sides get hard.

Very, very tasty and fast. I added 1/4 sp salt to base and topping as I used unsalted butter. Increased vanilla to 1 tbsp. I reduced the flour to 1 1/4 cups as it was a bit crumbly last time. Line your pan with parchment paper for easy cutting and clean up. Great treat for hockey game watching!

I did not care for this recipe. Not very buttery for butter tarts.

This is a NICE alternative to at traditional butter tart, top with whipped cream or ice cream for dessert!
