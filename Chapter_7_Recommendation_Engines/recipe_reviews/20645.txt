Really quick & easy to make. Much better than the premade stuff sold in the stores! I modified the recipe by using 3 large apples. Didn't bother to peel or shred them--just chopped and cored them. (Came from my apple tree, so I didn't have to worry about peeling. Extra fiber!) Adjusted the amount of water and sugar to taste, but used the full amount of cinnamon called for. After the apples had cooked, I pureed the mixture  in the food processor. **Used this applesauce in "Baked Oatmeal," which is also on this site. Used applesauce instead of the oil called for.**

This is really easy to make.  I used macintosh apples, and cut them into chunks instead of shredding them.  I scaled the recipe to make 8 servings, and used only 1 tsp. of cinnamon, instead of a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe calls for way to much cinnamon. I served this with vanilla ice-cream, and the tart apples with the sweet ice-cream was heaven!  Kind of like apple pie without the crust.  Great recipe!

Wonderful. Followed suggestions of previous reviews. I omitted the sugar and added a dash of nutmeg.

Soooooo quick and easy!  I had always thought applesauce was harder to make fo some reason, but this recipe makes me never want to buy applesauce again!  Only thing I did different was to eliminate the sugar; next time I think I will cut down the water too, as mine was a tad too watery.

This is a wonderful basic recipe:  I tripled the batch, didn't use as much cinnamon as called for, and probably only a tablespoon total of brown sugar.  I think the amount of sugar needed depends on the sweetness of the apples, and preference, of course.  I also chopped the apples instead of grating them...I liked the texture like that.  I will definitely make this again!

I've always used regular white sugar when making applesauce in the past.....so this was a pleasant surprise in using the brown sugar.  I, too, would decrease the amount of cinnamon in the future ---- but overall this was a very easy and tasty recipe.

Kind of a pain in the butt to shred the apples, and wayyyyy  too much cinnamon.  I will never make it this way again.

I added an extra apple and cut the sugar by half. When it was soft I used my immersion blender to smooth out the lumps. I stirred this through warm vanilla custard which the kids thought was great. All gone in one evening!

My children will not eat soft apples and who would? I noticed soft spots on  apples I bought 4 days ago, so, I had this recipe in my folder and decided to make apple sauce. I had about 6 rome apples (baggged) and cut them up into chunks. I followed the recipe accordingly and was going to triple the cinnamon and sugar. Instead I used 3 TBLS of sugar, 2tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 cup of water. At first I thought it was too runny but I cooked it in a non stick pot on low for 2  1/2hrs. I stirred occasionally and it turned out grrrREAT! My children love it!

I too thought this recipe called for too much cinnamon and sugar. The first time I only barely reduced the sugar and cinnamon. This helped a bit but the cinnamon flavor was overwhelming the apple taste. 

So this time I had to increase to 12 apples so 6 times the recipe. I added 4 tsp Cinnamon (rather than 6) and 16 tsp (didn't have a TBSP available) of brown sugar. I also only added 6oz of water instead of the recommended amount. For the apples I used the "Zesting" side of the grater I believe it's called. This gave it the consistency of applesauce without having to use a blender. 

Side note: if not planning to serve warm... I left this in the fridge overnight to chill in the pan just to the right temp and consistency before putting it in containers.  

It came out great! Everyone loved it!

This was my first ttempt at making applesause and I will never make any other recipe.  THis one is great.  However cut the cinnamon in half, but kept the brown sugar to what the recipe said.  Also just cut apples to chunks and used immersion blender. When you make this, use more than two apple though, because it will disappear quickly. This last batch I made, I used 12 apples, and we have already eaten half. You can also freeze some.

I didn't think with such few and simple ingredients that this would be that great but read the reviews and gave it a go...The sauce was awesome!  I cut the apples into pieces rather than shred; added an extra apple for 2 servings and used about half of the water the recipe called for and in the end used the immersion blender and served with pork chops.  Really great applesauce, great easy recipe!

Very good! Did need to cook it longer, almost twice as long,  and still seemed like the apples were not tender, so I put in blender for a few pulses. This helped, but still not as smooth as would have liked. Great flavor and very fresh tasting compared to jarred. Will make again. Maybe use different type apples next time.

Very straight forward - quick and easy. I used my magic bullet - just chopped and put pieces into it with the water. I halved the sugar after reading other reviews and it was still plenty sweet.

My husband wouldn't even let me puree the cooked apples at all... they went straight from the pot to a bowl and topped with ice cream. Thanks for the recipe, I will be using this pureed when my baby is a little older.

This recipe is definitely one of my favorites.. I use Fuji apples and slightly less cinnamon than the recipe calls for.  Occasionally i'll throw in a banana and use this in oatmeal, on waffles, with pork chops, on chicken or just eating alone. :)

This is a great simple recipe. I recently made it for a person recuperating and it was a big hit. I also added raisins to it and served it warm with some whipped cream.

Way too sweet and I cut the sugar in half.  Maybe my apples were sweeter than most.  I guess I will serve this as dessert or topping on Pancakes.

So simple and makes for some outstanding apple butter when you chuck it in the slow cooker for the night.

This was delicious, especially the next day. I like chunky sauce so I chopped the apples into very small pieces, and I use Fuji apples for all my baking. Generally, to save time, I will chop the apples, stir in lemon juice and cinnamon, and place in air tight container in fridge for several days. Then when I am ready to make apple muffins, or apple sauce, I can do this quickly. Love anything with apples!

The only thing I changed is that I cut the apples into a large dice and then mashed with a potato masher when they got soft.  I loved it and from now on will only eat homemade!!!

I tripled the recipe,, but still cut back the cinnamon to half a tsp, and didn't add any sugar.  We used our orchard apples which are plenty sweet and juicy.
  Also, no need to peel the apples, why through away all those nutrients and fiber?  Shredding seemed like too much work,, so I cut into small chunks, then used an immersion blender in the pot after they softened up.
 Tasted yummy,,, wayyyyy better than any store bought sauce,, and wayyy easier to make than I ever thought that apple sauce would be.

I followed the recipe exactly, however, the submitter of this recipe should have said what -size- of apples need to be used. I used 12 small apples from my aunts tree and multiplied the recipe accordingly... and ended up with apple cinnamon syrup. Now if I can only figure out what to do with the syrup... .

I had no idea applesauce was so easy!  I used a dash of nutmeg and only 1 tbsp brown sugar.  Also, instead of shredding the apples, I just cored/sliced them and simmered them with water and spices, covered, until soft.  Then I used a potato masher to break them up into smallish chunks, about 1 cubic cm.  The texture was great, the taste was great.

BEWARE: this recipe makes only enough for one big helping or two smallish helpings.  People *will* want this when they smell it cooking, so make enough!

My husband didn't like the texture of the shredded apples, so next time I will use the food processor for a smoother sauce.  Plus it was too time consuming to shred the apples, especially when doubling the recipe.  The apples also took longer than I expected to get mushy, about 25 mintues, but I did have the heat rather low.  Overall, I liked the recipe and will probably make it again.  The apple sauce was a nice side to the pork chops I made.

very simple and very good. I didn't shred the apples, I cubed them and that seemed to work out great.

This was delicious. We went apple picking so had more apples than we knew what to do with- this was perfect. SO much better than anything store bought. I used 6 apples, and eyeballed the amt of cinnamon. I initially used less water than was called for, but ended up having to add water, so I think that the proportions in this recipe are good. I used only about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar for my larger volume, but mostly because I was serving it to my young kids before bed :-) This was great- we will definitely make again.

the absolute only thing I did different was add a dash of lemon juice to stop some of the browning of the apples.  This is a great and tasty recipe!

Easy tip - don't bother shredding the apples! Just peel and chunk them as you would for a pie and when they start to soften use the potato masher!!  Depending on your apples and how juicy they are, you may need to add more or less water.  I used the full amount of cinnamon and sugar and the applesauce turned out absolutely delicious. Try it on top of bran flakes in the morning (still add your milk) for a wonderful-tasting healthy fibre-rich breakfast!

I like this recipe because it is really easy and great. I have made this twice already and it is much better then the boddled stuff.  I have been pealing and cubing the fruit and cooking it per the recipe and after it is cooked, I have used my stick blender blend up the fruit and make it into a sauce.  I could have used my food presessor first to great the apples but this has been easier then having to clean up all the mess from the prossesor.  I used two apples and two peaches the first time I made it and last time I used three apples and a pear.  My one complaint is that there is too much cinnamon. It didn't seem to be as strong last time I made it but this time was pretty strong in the cinnamon department.

This recipe calls for FAR too much cinnamon.  When eating the sauce you can actually feel the light grit from the cinnamon in the sauce. My kids like it well enough,  but did ask if it was apple butter before tasting it.

I am that person who can not even fry an egg without causing total destruction. Or at least I was until this Thanksgiving when I was assigned the impossible task of making Applesauce. I do not even like apples, so you can imagine my disposition to this job. A friend recommended this website, and since this is the only applesauce recipe, I decided to give it a go. Maybe because this Thanksgiving was spent in France with people who have never celebrated the holiday and have never eaten warm mushed apples, but it was an absolute hit. The host of the party, an actual French chef, begged for the simple recipe and I have since made the dish for 4 other parties. It is simple, fairly healthy, and quite delicious. And now people think I can cook!

The applesauce was very tasty...the only drawback for me was that it turned very brown due to the cinnamon & brown sugar, and my pickyish six yr old wouldn't eat it.  But our 99 yr old Pop scarfed it up, saying "Well this is just plain good!" as he sopped it up with a biscuit...CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT I GUESS!!!

Absolutely delicious topping to my ice cream, and my sister loved it all by itself.  I followed one of the suggestions to mash the apples rather than shred them, I found the chunks gave it a good texture.  I used 3 small apples rather than two but other than that I followed the recipe.  For my half of the recipe I added some chopped walnuts for an added crunch and it was delicious.  Thanks so much

I trippled the recipe (used 6 granny smith apples). I just peeled, cut and cored them (I didn't shred them). I mashed them with a potato masher. I used half the cinnamon and half the sugar. Turned out yummy!

I just made the best apple sauce ever... although I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I only put a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 tsp.brown sugar.Also,I just chunked the apples,simmered them in a covered pot for 1/2 hour over medium heat, then I removed the cover and cooked another 15 minutes on low.

I used rome beauty for this recipe. For some reason, even though I used very low fire, the water kept evaporating. I ended up have to add totally a cup of water til it was actually done. I halved the sugar because I love the sweet and sour taste of the apples themselves. Cinnamon and apples = match made in heaven. LOVE IT!

Perfect ratio of apples to liquid.  Resulted in just the right consistency of sauce.  Used four granny smith, and 1/2 cup of apple juice instead of water.  Also, tossed in a handful of cranberries and only 1 tblsp of brown sugar.  Followed the advice of others and chopping the apples rather than shredding them.  Mashed them up with a potato masher.

This did not work for me at all.  The water kept evaporating in the pan, so I had to keep adding more.  After 30 minutes, apples were still not soft.  Probably won't try again, but thanks anyways.

I had 8 apples I needed to get rid of and this recipe seemed perfect for it. Easy to cook, simple ingredients. I chose to cook the sugar with the whole lot rather than add it at the end.  We laid it over granola for dessert and it tastes like apple crumble. The kids will take the leftovers for lunch this week.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe tastes very good, but it's entirely too sweet and rich to eat a bowl of it... I would recommend it as a tart filling or ice cream topping... or add a little butter and chill and use as appple butter...

Holy moly! Why haven't I made apple sauce before? The only thing "bad" about this recipe is it didn't make enough...lol. I used about 3/4 of the amount of brown sugar called for and it was just lovely. And the smell of it while cooking is heavenly. I just peeled and chopped the apples small. Next time I will be making much more.

Excellent!  Easy to make.  I was too lazy to shred the apples, so I diced them.  I used honeycrisp apples, which are already sweet, so I only added one teaspoon of brown sugar.  Using a potato masher gave it a nice chunky texture.  This is a keeper!

Sooo delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (except for shredding the apples. I will use less brown sugar next time (but I guess it really depends on the sweetness of your apples.)

It was a huge hit with my family. It tasted just like apple crisp. The only thing I did diffrent was I cut the apples up in chunks and mashed them up when fully cooked. It make a bit of a chunky apple sauce which is what my family likes. I will be making it again real soon. It's gotta be the best recipe I have tried by far.

I have made applesauce many times, but this is a different approach. Usually I boil the apples first, then pulverize them; this recipe basically reverses that sequence. Instead of shredding the apples, which sounded painful, I used my food processor. Raw apples (with peels) and a wee bit of water were food-processored until they looked like applesauce, (but tasted grainy); then I simmered it for about 45 minutes to soften the texture. I probably could have simmered it for a shorter time if I had removed the peels - but my mom always told me to eat my apple peels.  One caution, if you do opt to leave the peels on: Make very, very sure you remove all the little stickers. Picking tiny bits of sticker out of boiling applesauce is not very fun (take my word for it).

This is the first time I've made apple sauce. Instead of shredding the apples, I used my food processor, which made it less messy, and way easier than shredding. I also used brown sugar splenda rather than brown sugar. The taste is very good! I highly recommend this recipe.

The best apple sauce I ever had! I only had one apple and so to make up for the other I used a pear. Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Thanks for a great one!

Tasted great!  However, I think there is too much water (should have read the other reviews first).  I changed the measurements and made it for 10 servings (using 10 apples) and I think the recipe called for a little too much water.  Right amount of sugar and cinnamon for me though!  :)  Will make again, but just cut down the water.

This was SO easy! I didn't grate the apples, I just diced them up. I would also recommend using a food processor or blender to mush them up. I used a potato masher, but it was still a little chunky...which I like...I loved being able to use the apples we have in our yard and not having to pay the price for organic apple sauce!! YUMMO!

This is a GREAT method. Really easy and delicious. Like others, I would definitely recommend cutting the cinnamon down by at least half and the sugar could really be cut down if not cut out completely. Will make many more times with those adjustments!

EXCELLENT!!!  This was an easy recipe to follow.  I put 3 cored apples in the pan with water and cooked until soft.  I then put the apples in the food processor for a smoother sauce.  I added the brown sugar to taste and added cinnamon also.  I just wish I used more apples.... next time!

Simplify.  Quarter, core, throw in blender, turn on = applesauce.  Can flavor in blender or toss in pan to cook in flavor and/or thicken.  I have made small & large batches in this manner.  Saves hours when canning.

Plenty sweet with no sugar at all.  But I sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top to make it extra-sweet.  I also used half the cinnamon.

I thought this was delicious and so simple. I played with the measurements a bit because of other peoples reviews but I ended up in the end adding the same amount as it called for in the recipe. I did triple the recipe as well. My best advise is to add the ingredients a bit at a time until you find the flavor that you desire.

Lifesaver! I am a mother of a 3 year old and anyone with kids knows how finiky they can be with food! My daughter just asked for an apple, so I cored and sliced it for her the same way I do many times a week only to learn that today she "HATES CUT APPLES!!" So now with a screaming kid and quickly browning apples I turned to this recipe for rescue. What a miracle! It's amazing what a great applesauce can do to a tantruming child! I topped it with some sliced banana and my daughter was in heaven! She ate the whole batch and still wants more! My new dilema: explaining that there is no more!

This was easy to make, much easier than I would have thought!!  I altered it slightly.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 tsp, and I still think it was a little sweet.  I used macintosh apples, what I had on hand-plus they are my favorites!!!  So I was expecting a tarter sauce.  Next time I will leave the sugar out altogether. I also decided to increase the water, and raised the heat to high.  It made the apples cook very quickly.  Then when the apples were tender, I drained them.  Then I put the whole thing in the food processor and added a little more cinnamon. ********1/15/08 I just made this recipe again to use in an applesauce cake.  I omitted the cinnamon and sugar completely, and added strawberries when I simmered the apples-used Red Delicious this time.  It has a great natural sweetness to it. This is a great recipe to play with if you like applesauce!

Used 2 Granny Smith and 1 regular sweet apple, recipe's 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup water & 1 tbsp brown sugar. Turned out fine.  

Considered adding more water in the beginning but was glad I didn't as apples released water on heating, it's easier to add water mid-way than having to boil away too much water.  Apple sauce on tart side but that's the way I like it.

This was so yummy! I made extra to use in my spice cake. I will never buy a jar of apple sauce again. It was so easy to make. I followed the advise of another reviewer. I left the skins on, cored, and cut into to chunks. After the apple were soft then I puree the apples. I also used the Pampered Chef Cinnamon plus. Next time, I will use a little less sugar.

My daughter does not eat store bought applesauce. I had a recipe that called for applesauce, since I had apples on hand thought I would give this a try. I daughter ate so much of it I barely had enough for my recipe. *4 apples made just over 1 cup

This apple sauce is AWESOME!  I just eyeballed the water as many reviewers thought 1/4 cup was too much and added brown sugar to taste.  Sooo good.  I topped some stuffing filled pork spedinis with this apple sauce and it made the dish!  So good warm or cold.  I plan to make another batch tonight and serve it over vanilla ice cream with carmel sauce-Mmmmmmmm!

I made this with local York apples.   I didn't find it to be overly sweet at all.  I also increased the cinnamon (personal preference).  This apple sauce was excellent, everyone in the house loved it.  I also used it in a BBQ sauce recipe...it was perfect.  Can't wait to make it again.

VERY delish. I reduced the amount of cinnamon and sugar, and drained some of the water off before putting in the blender for a few quick blends. It's really up to your own personal taste how much cinnamon and sugar you use...I had chopped up the apples instead of shredding them, leaving the applesauce chunky - PERFECT for my 16 month old learning how to use utensils! Very good on vanilla ice cream or all by itself.

I made this recipe in bulk - I used 3 bags of small pink lady apples, 250g brown sugar and 650ml water and a 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon. I loved it but the hubby said to reduce the cinnamon even more (but he's a Brit who likes everything plain). Also stores in containers very well for weekday lunches!

I just made this  today after apple picking this weekend I have a lot to use up. I loved the directions for this  and the ingredients. But I did  go by other reviewers and  decreased the water cinn. and sugar. just added it little bits at a time til it tasted just right. I used 6 apples different varieties as they were almixed together in the bag. Thanks for the original concept. Will be making this again

It was pretty good, however I did change it slightly by using 6 apples instead of 2. I imagine it would have been way to sweet for my sister and I otherwise. Next time I am going to try using slightly less cinnamon but otherwise this was great, thanks :)

Loved this apple sauce! I've never used brown sugar in mine and found this to be so much better than white sugar. My apples were very juicy so I only needed a tad of water. A huge hit at Easter Sherice and thank you!

After I started heating the apples I realized I had no brown sugar. I substituted raw sugar instead and it worked quite well. Only a little sprinkle is needed.

This was simple and delicious. My 2 year old son ate the whole bowl. I cut the sugar down to 1 tablespoon because the apples were sweet on their own and we normally buy unsweetened applesauce here. 
Great way to use up my overripe apples.

This is extremely delicious. It's quick and easy to make. I made it with ten apples and it yields 3 x 250 mL, which I canned.

I just love apples and cinnamon together and this was a perfect recipe! I recommend not to use too sweet apples so the mix of sour and sweet compliment each other. Yummy!

We found the cinnamon overpowering! And adding so much brown sugar made it way too sweet even for kids.
But it's all a matter of taste. My family likes to eat healthy and this actually was a fail for them. Suitable for those who want very sweet desserts perhaps.

We love lots of cinnamon, so we really liked this.  I used white sugar instead of brown (didn't have brown) and lemon juice instead of water.  Turned out beautifully.

I used this recipe for my pears. I have a pear tree and a multitude of pears even after supplying family & friends. I used a ratio of 2 pears to 1 apple. The pear sauce is delicious. Then I made batches adding the apples. Voila - Apple Pear Sauce. I also pureed the cooked fruit, let it cool, packaged it and froze it. It tastes just as good now as when I made it last year. Pears are ripe, here I go again.

Yum. I used this recipe to use up some crab apples we picked. Because of how tart the crab apples are it definitely needed the sugar, but I could see using less for other types of apples. I used the full amount of cinnamon and wouldn't change it - then again I usually add more cinnamon than a recipe calls for. We've eaten this on its own and added it to our oatmeal in the morning for breakfast. Delish.

this was ok.  it took way longer to cook than i thought.  i diced the apples up really good, thinking it was mash and cook faster, but it didn't help.  i think if i had sliced the apples instead, that may have helped it mash better.  but after simmering for a good 20 minutes, they were still a little crispy.  i might try again, if i had some extra apples laying around.

Yummmm!  I used three medium fuji apples and less brown sugar.  maybe approximately 1-1.5 tbs.  I diced the apples instead of shredding them and when they were soft, I put them in the blender so it was more of an applesauce consistency.  definitely will make again and could probably add even less brown sugar b/c it's still pretty sweet.

This apple sauce was so delicious! I didn't know that apple sauce was so easy to make! We used crab apples instead of regular cooking apples and it made the taste more tangy, strong and sweet. We'll be using this recipe again in the future.

Perfect recipe for a chilly fall day!  I cubed the apples with the peel left on and used a potato masher during the cooking to smush them down.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This apple sauce was amazing.  My 3 teens loved it and wanted to know when I'm making more.  I tripled the recipe and also added a bit more water.  It tasted amazing and went very well with our roast pork dinner!

This was the firsttime I ever made apple sauce! I used three small apples, peeled, and chopped them. However i had a hard time cutting them smaller, but having some kind of grinder, so I useda spoon first, then decided to use a fork. With the fork I Pushed hard dowbn in it, and cut diffrerent ways. However it was hard cutting in a bowl, so I put in on a cutting board, and would scrap the apple pieces with the fork to make them smaller. I put in back in the bowl. I used 1/4 cup of water, 1 tablespoon of cinamon, and 1/2 cup brown sugar, then i boiled it on the burner. Since I used the burner I ended up with trhe right amount of water. However I might want to warn you that if you haven't done this before the cinamon can turn your applesauce really brown. Mine was that color. It was a great recipe! Thanks!

I scaled this recipe to use 24 apples so I could can the sauce. There was way too much cinnamon and brown sugar. It came out very sweet, like I could use it for apple pies. Next time I'm halving the cinnamon and using a little less brown sugar.

My Mom always made homemade applesauce the same way. In the fall when the apples on the tree in our yard were ready she would make huge batches of this and can it. I make it the same way and it's truly delicious. Much better than store bought applesauce and kids just love it. You don't really need to shred the apples. Just slice them and cover the pot while cooking over low heat, stirring often. When the apples are mushy just mash the mixture with a potato masher.

I had some apples that weren't going to get eaten but I didn't want to throw them away.  I prorbaly used more apple than the recipe called for and I used brown sugar instead of white.  This was the best tasting applesauce I have ever eaten.  Now I don't have to throw away apples.  I can make this instead.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This was fabulous, the only change I made was I added a little more sugar since the Granny Smith apples I used were extra tart. It is by far the easiest and tastiest applesauce recipe I've made. Thank you for submitting it!

This recipe was a great guideling, as I was putting up a few bushels of apples I was not exact in my measurments, but love the brown sugar.  I only used enough cinnamon to cover top of apples in stock pot, and added a dash of nutmeg, came out great!  Thanks

It's a very nice recipe that's nice and sweet, but I must say one teaspoon is far too much cinnamon!  A dash or two, perhaps, but not that much.  People were telling me that my applesauce looked like applebutter!

I would have given this 5 stars but when i doubled the recipe it was just a tad too much cinnamon. It did taste delicious once it chilled for a while though. I will make it again, just use a little less cinnamon.

Very simple to make and so delicious. I added some mango chunks for the extra tanginess and it worked out great! I transferred the fruit to the slow cooker and after an hour, I mashed them up with a hand mixer. Yum!

Easy and delicious.     Like a few other reviewers, I cut back the cinnamon to about 3/4 of  a teaspoon.      This recipe can be expanded upon to suit your tastes.   I added raisins, a little bit of spiced rum, and a touch of vanilla extract.    It was a great topping on ice cream and cereal, but also delicious eaten alone.

I changed this up a little, but used the same 4 ingredients. I used 9 apples and 1 cup of water (which turned out to be the perfect ratio!) I kept the 1 tsp of cinnamon the same and reduced the brown sugar from 3 to 2 tbsps. I cooked it longer too, about 1.5 hours. Absolutely delicious! 3 stars because I think the measurements were way off if using only 2 apples!

Easy and delicious!  I simply cut and peeled a mixture of freshly picked apples, modifying the recipe only by deciding no shredding required. .it was just spicy enough and not too sweet. A hit.

Wow, agreed that I'll never have to buy apple sauce again.  Kids loved how fresh it tasted and loved the cinnamon flavor.  I didn't have to add any sugar.  The natural sweetness of the red apples was enough. Will definitely make again and again

This is a perfect apple sauce in record time!  I have not purchased any since finding this recipe.  (I also make this without the brown sugar to use in my homemade dog biscuits.). Thank you for sharing such a quick way to enjoy apple sauce!

I added an extra apple. Yo make it stretch a little further. Was easy and tasty. Took a little more time than expected to cook the apples down. So I had to keep adding a couple of tablespoons here and there. I had honey Crisp and macs. So the hc probably wasn't the best apple. But it was a last minute thing I decided to make, and all I had on hand. Still was delicious.

Very Nice! There was a bit to much cinnamon and brown sugar, but other than that it was perfect! I loved the texture and the overall flavor. Good job!

Great!  I used Granny Smith apples (sliced thin w/ the Presto Salad Shooter), pie spice for the cinnamon, and, after cooking 'til soft, pureed about 3/4 of the apple mix  so there was a mix of pureed apple with some chunks.

I used 4 small apples and kept everything the same and it turned out sweet like apple pie filling. I did not find it watery- I actually found it heavy because I shredded the apples. I did not core them before shredding so I had something to hold on to while doing it. I would make again- and try serving warm under ice cream as suggested.

Great basic recipe.  I wanted to make stewed apples, but was unsure about proportions and timing.  This recipe worked very well - I was careful about how much water, and used a small measure of cinnamon sugar, finishing with a slight squirt of lemon. Used my potato masher for a bit of a mash, since I wanted chunky, stewed apples.  It was delicious with the sour cream biscuits from this site.

I loved this recipe!  We doubled the recipe and chopped one batch and shredded another.   Chopped was way better!  We also let it simmer for an 1 hour and 45 minutes.  We used about 3/4 the cinnamon it called for.  Everything else was great!

I peeled and chopped the apples instead of spreading them.  It worked just fine.  I canned it and was able to enjoy it all winter long.

This is the hardest applesauce to make ever. It took hours to make and it even burned my pot although I added much more water. The cinnamon is also way too much. It doesn't taste very delicious so I will never ever make it again.

I bought a batch of apples that ended up being mealy and no body wanted to eat them. This recipe was perfect, I had about 12 of them, cut them in small chunks, leaving skin on, added 3/4c water, figuring I could add more if needed, and just eyeballed the cinnamon, prob about 3 tbls (we like cinnamon so I wasn't afraid of over doing it).  Perfect use for unwanted apples, I thought about throwing in some pears, but next time. The family liked it, and the apples were used up - that was my goal.

Great, easy recipe as is.  I chopped/minced the apples, then used a hand held blender at the end to give it a smoother consistency.  I made a huge batch and quadrupled the recipe.

I leave the cooked apples as cut and cooked, chunky, apples like the inside of an apple pie.  More adult like.

What is the fascination with using an immersion blender?

Yutes, it's wasted on the wrong people.

Good recipe. I will def peel the apples next time, and putting it through the food processor was a great idea too. I added half of the sugar but next time I may put only like 1/2 tbs in as at 1 and a half tbsp it was pretty sweet. I only added a dash of cinnamon to mine

This was a very easy and quick recipe. Used 3 McIntosh apples, added more water by a tablespoon and took the advice and used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. Used about 1 T of brown sugar when done.  It only took about 10 minutes to cook and I did not need to puree at all, the apples cooked down to a pleasant texture.  Very tasty treat, Will make again!

This recipe can be adjusted to one's taste. I start with one tablespoon of sugar and add more if I need it. I also add about 1/2 a teaspoon of lemon juice to give a little more flavour. As is, the recipe is a little too sweet.

Excellent Recipe!! Really easy.  I used granny smith's and actually added only a quarter of the brown sugar asked for.  It cut the tart sweetness of the apples. My two year old loves it.

This recipe calls for way too much cinamon.  I made 6 servings, which called for 1 tablespoon.  I would suggest using 1 teaspoon.  I might make another batch and omit the cinamon, and then mix the 2 together.

This was fantastic!  I shredded the apples like what was suggested in the recipe.  I saw that some people had problems getting it to get soft, so i upped the heat for about 15 min to medium, and let it bubble.  I also added in the brown sugar and let it cook with the apples for the second half of cooking.  I served in a bowl with some fat free redi whip on the top, and it was fantasic.  Definatly will make this again!

I added Red Hots to give it some extra kick and color.  I added the candy about 10-15 minutes after it started cooking so it could melt completely. It was wonderful!
Also, after I cut the apples into smaller chunks (about 1/2 inch cubes), I ran it through a food processor to puree it a bit.

Great taste! However I  ran into the same issue as some of the other reviewers. I don't know how thin some of you shredded you're apples but using a normal grater size and an hour of cooking I still wasn't able to get the apple to blend well. I eventually turned off the stove let it cool down a bit and placed it in my food processor. I doubled the recipe and did not modify anything. It was such a basic and simple recipe! When I make this again I would defenitiy scale it a lot bigger then double so that I would have some leftovers after two people had some. I am looking forward to using this recipe again soon and experimenting with different types of apples.

It was very simple to do and I had everything on hand. I didn't add the cinnamon and only added a little brown sugar as I don't like it to sweet. I also put it in the food processor as I don't like it chunky. All in all a good recipe and both my daughter and I enjoyed it. Will make this again for sure.

Absolutely yummy! I did add a bit extra sugar to make it more to my liking but other then that it was easy and a million times better then the store bought apple sauce.

I made this recipe and took it to my sisters place and everyone loved it.  I have had several calls for it.  I think I added just a little more sugar than called.  Awesome taste

This was excellent applesauce! Very easy and very yummy! My 7 year old ate it like crazy.  She even brought some for her teacher and she said it was the best applesauce she'd ever eaten.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! I did cut the cin. a little. Also, I'd probably double the recipe to serve 2-3 people. My 4 year old hit the nail when she said it tasted just like the apple pie filling from Mcdonalds,(although much better for you!) Thanks!

I really loved this recipe.  I took the advice of several others and only used half the cin.  I will be making this again, maybe with Splenda next time?

Definately 1/2 the cinnamon and spare the water.  Very tasty but a little lumpy for my toddlers - nothing a little food processor couldn't fix.

My family LOVED this!!  It kinda tasted like apple pie!  Had to scale the recipe to serve more, because 2 wasn't enough.  VERY GOOD!

Excellent as a starting point for the  apple sauce. I did not need to add any sugar, although I suppose it depends on which apples you use whether you need it or not, scaled it for 3 and halved the  cinamon.
Overall though EXCELLENT.

Much easier to make than the apple sauce recipes that I remember.  I used Rome apples which I think make the apple sauce a little drier tasting, so I ended up using about three times the amount of water.  I also used a hand blender after adding the brown sugar to liquify some of the chunks.

This is SO easy and tastes great!  I've made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit with everyone.  I did go a bit easy on the cinnamon.
