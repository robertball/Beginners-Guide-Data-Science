I used butter in place of the vegetable oil and omitted the walnuts. (I could see how those would be good in this bread, it's just noone in my house likes walnuts but me. I know, weird.) This smells wonderful and the ingredients come together so easily. I love the combination of strawberries and bananas.
This recipe makes one large loaf.

EDITED TO ADD THE NEXT DAY: If I were to make this again, I would leave out the spice. I couldn't taste the banana and strawberry flavors over the spices. The spices aren't a bad addition, I just thought this would be better without.

I really wanted something different.  I always make banana bread.  I made some changes.  I was afraid of the banana overpowering the strawberry like one reviewer mentions; so I used one small banana and a heaping cup full of smashed strawberries.  No spice or nuts.  Then the only other change I made was to add vanilla to the strawberry mixture before folding.  Very delicious and moist.  I gave the banana-berry bread a 5.

Unfortunately the strawberry flavor was not really as apparent as I had expected.  This definitely is more a banana muffin.  A very good, very flavorful  banana muffin. I followed the recipe as written only omitting the nutmeg as I'm not a fan. The subtle hint of cinnamon rounded out the flavors and the vegetable oil guaranteed moistness.  The chopped walnuts provided interest, texture and crunch. I baked this recipe as muffins, 375 degrees, about 18-20 minutes. When cooled I drizzled then with chocolate ganache I had leftover and I'm telling you, it was decadent and wonderful - just perfect for these perfect muffins.

I used frozen blueberries instead of the strawberries since I had them in the freezer.  I added just a bit more flour to compensate for the extra liquid.  Turned out delicious!

This turned out well. It was moist and tasty.  I decreased the sugar using 1/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white-still plenty sweet. I omitted the nuts as well. I would definitely make this again!

This was sooo good! Took the advice of reviewers and 1. replaced the vegetable oil with applesauce 2. replaced sugar to 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar 3. cut up the strawberries and left them as chunks instead of mashing them. Amazing!

I've used many recipes from this sites, but this one prompted me to write my first review here! I absolutely love how it turned out. In fact, I can't stop eating it and the loaf is almost gone even though I just made it yesterday. I did make some changes only because I didn't have every ingredient listed: I used whole wheat flour, flaxseed meal with water as egg replacer, 1 cup frozen blueberries in place of the strawberries, and sunflower seeds in place of the walnuts. I put in a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and kept the nutmeg even though I'm not a big fan of this spice, and I'm glad I did since it really enhanced the flavor for me. I also used only 1/2 cup of sugar (evaporated cane juice) and doubled the mashed banana since I love banana flavor. I baked it at 350 for an hour and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe - I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was hard to rate. As a bread (loaf) it didn't work out at all. The mixture tasted awesome before I baked it with the flavors of banana and strawberry--yum! But when I baked it, it was so dense the outside baked up and crusted to quickly and was very hard midway into the bread. Tasting it, it didn't taste the way I was expecting, I believe the amount of cinnamon should possibly be cut in half that the recipe amount calls for and nix totally on the nutmeg, you can't taste the strawberry and barely the banana, but totally could taste the walnuts. Having said that. I had already made a 2nd batch before the loaf came out of the oven and decided to make muffins....well this recipe is prefect for muffins, bakes in half the time, was light, airy and the flavors were better, even though I still feel that the nutmeg should be eliminated and cinnamon reduced. I think I'll try this again the muffin way with ingredient adjustments because I did follow it to a T. I would have liked to taste the fruit in this. Great muffing recipe, not so good bread loaf recipe.

Yum-Yum...I put this in a muffin pan like another reviewer. Turned out great. What an easy delicious bread. I encourage you to try this. Also, try different berries or fruits.

This turned out SO good! It was so moist and a nice sweet taste to it. I did make it without the nuts, not really my thing but I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

Great dairy free recipe.  My son is allergic to dairy (and nuts) so I omitted the nuts..I made them into muffins instead of the loaf pan and it took about 45 minutes to bake.  The outcome was tasty and super moist..tasted like it came from a bakery!  I may add extra fruit next time since it was hard to distinguish the fruit flavors..will try it with fresh blueberries next time.  Definitely a keeper in my household.

I always use whole wheat pastry flour and EggBeaters for quick breads to make them healthier and this was no exception.  I also used 1/8 tsp ground cardamom and a packet of crystallized lemon (True Lemon)for the cinnamon and nutmeg and I used vanilla sugar which I always have on hand.  Lastly, I used toasted chopped pecans for the nuts.  I made three mini loaves and one is already gone, right out of the oven.  This is a keeper and I'm sure just as good as written.  Thanks!  I'll be making it over and over now that strawberries are everywhere.

love it! very cake like, and delicious
UPDATE: I've made this recipe a number of times. It's my go to when I have strawberries and bananas to use. Its best when the bananas are super ripe, it really brings out the flavor. I just quarter the strawberries and let the mixer mash it up into the batter. You end up with strawberry chunks which I think helps keep the strawberry flavor in tact. I've made it with and without nuts, and with and without nutmeg. I like it with nuts and nutmeg best. Its very moist, and a runnier batter than you'd expect, and it really takes a long time to bake.  Will try the muffin pan next time.

This recipe is nearly identical to a recipe that I found in my 1989 Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book! It's in the oven right now, though the cook book adds orange zest, which sounds like a perfect addition!

Very good. As I didn't have strawberries on hand, I substituted 1/2 cup of craisens. It's a nice combination with the walnuts. It will compliment the rest of our breakfast nicely.

Though they sounded great, they didn't really hit the spot for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I feel that it turned out too bland.  It was also a little too moist on the inside; soggy almost.

This was very good and easy to make. Don't really need to change a thing for it to be 5 stars, but next time I will probably add more banana.
