Great taste.  I used boneless chicken breasts and after reading the reviews, I marinated the chicken in the lemon & mustard sauce for an hour.  Next time I might try cooking the chicken with the sauce and spices and leave off the bread crumbs to see if it has even more of the tangy flavor.

This was sooo tasty. I agree with another reviewer who said it would be even better to marinate the chicken for awhile longer.. next time I will try that. Nice and easy, quick and light.. I was able to reduce the amount of butter in this by 1/3 w/o any negative effects on the meal. I will keep this in my recipe box

I made this suculant chicken dish last night.  Wolfgang gave it a 5 stars and ate 3 peices.  I thought it was the most flavorful chicken I have ever had.  I made it with skinless chicken breasts and it turned out mouth watering!  Afterward during our post dinner activities, Wolfgang screamed out "lemmon zest!" .... so all in all, I'd say the chicken was a hit"

With a little modification, this was great!  I replaced one tablespoon of the mustard with wasabi mustard, marinated for two hours, and doubled the bread crumbs -- so when I turned it over, I recoated the soggy side with more.  This was so fab!  Definately a new family favorite.

I used English mustard for a hotter taste,& marinated the chicken for 2 hours in the lemon/lime/mustard. I sprayed the pan with oil instead of using all that butter. The taste was scrumptious, although I did find the coating alittle soggy. With work, this could become a favourite.

This was AWESOME! I marinated my chicken in the lemon,lime mustard sauce for two hours and it tasted fabulous!I also used the leftover marinade right in the pan with the chicken after I coated it with the bread crumb mixture.It went perfectly with garlic mashed potatoes and french green beans.I will definitely keep this in my recipe box!

I added some water to the left over marinade, boiled it and thickened it a little to make a sauce for the chicken, which went down well. I tried this with Dijon mustard, which was delicious. But next time I will try with English mustard for a hotter taste. I will also marinade it for longer. Great recipe, and destined to become a family favourite

My husband went wild over this dish. He says I can make it as often as I want. I add a bit more Lemon Juice for a little bit more of a bite.

this recipe was a hit with my husband and parents.  it's not too mustardy and the lemon gave the chicken a nice tang.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked at 350 for 45 min.  my dad and I are on Weight Watchers and we easily fit this into our point allowance for the day!

I tried this following the directions as given. The taste was good, but I was disappointed that the chicken didn't brown and have a nice crispy crust; it looked rather bland and didn't make a great presentation. I think the next time, if I ever make it again, I'll use my standard chicken coating method (dredge in flour, dip in egg/milk mixture and then coat in the bread crumb mixture, which, of course, would include the herbs and lemon and lime zest from the original recipe and then pour the mustard/lime juice in the baking pan. I think I'd keep the chicken pieces on a rack in the baking pan so they wouldn't get soggy.  We ended up using the leftover chicken in a "make it up as you go along" chicken casserole, that was very good, the next day.

This was excellent!  I followed the ingredients exactly except added 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper and used panko crumbs.  I warmed my pan up in oven (375) with the butter in it until the butter was hot and put the chicken skin side down and turned it after 22 minutes and let it bake for 20 more minutes then turned on the broiler for about 7 minutes ... Yummers ... it's a keeper! thanx

This was a very tasty dish. There was a lot of fat from the thighs so I think less butter would work but it gives good flavor. I omitted the breadcrumbs and seared the skin side of the thigh before placing it in the oven skin side down and then flipping. The skin was crisp and delicious!

I liked the taste of this, but I think the recipe needs a little tweaking.  Like a lot of others, my crust became soggy.  I think next time, I'll brown the coated chicken (I used boneless, skinless thighs) and bake it in the oven without the butter.  I also doubled the curry, and added some other spices.  I really loved the taste of the citrus and mustard together.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  This is one of the tangiest chicken dishes I've ever made.  It was just superb.  It goes very well with mashed potatoes and Cheesy Creamed Spinach Casserole (also here on AllRecipes).

The best!  However, I used boneless breasts and they were tough.  Won't do that again.  The flavor is wonderful.

Loved it!
The only change I would make next time would be to leave the chicken in the mustard/lemon/lime mix for about an hour or so to really get the citrus flavor into it. It was delicious!

It turned out pretty good. Two things I'd do if I made it again:
1) use a lot less butter. Half of this amount would have been plenty. Thighs have a lot of fat, so it was a bit greasy. Actually 1.5 T of butter and 1.5 T of olive oil would have been good.
2) I baked these in my large cast iron skillet. I would have heated it more on top of the stove so that the chicken sizzled when I put it into the pan. The coating didn't get crispy. The lemon citrusy taste was really good though. 
3) I didn't have curry powder so I substituted garlic powder and it was fine.

This chicken was very good. My family really liked it. The only change I made was I used 8 chicken thighs instead of 6 because there is definitely enough sauce and crumbs. I also am not sure that you need the 6 tablespoons of butter. I think next time I will use less. I sprayed the pan with cooking spray so it wouldn't stick so will cut back on the butter next time. Definitely a keeper.

Yummy! I made this recipe with skinless, boneless chicken thighs and marinated them for an hour like other reviewers advised. Didn't have enough lemons and limes so I added the juice of 1/2 an orange to equal about 10 Tbsp of citrus juice. Since the thighs didn't have skin I just coated them with the bread crumb mixture, drizzled a little melted butter on top and baked them in the oven. It wasn't necessary to brown them in a pan first. The chicken came out juicy with a really nice citrusy, curry flavor. I might add some garlic powder and cayenne to the crumbs next time but I will certainly make this easy, flavorful dish again! Served it with brown rice and sauteed green beans. Very very good!

Tasty enough if you like a soggy coating.  Marinated in citrus juices & dry mustard for two hours.  Didn't use butter; lightly coated pan with olive oil.  1.5 cups crumbs, doubled spices & zest.  Re-coated both sides of chicken prior to 'turning.'  I wouldn't serve this for company.

I think this could be a great recipe if done differently. I've made this twice using the recipe as is. It came out soggy both times. If I make this again I will leave out the butter entirely or only use it to grease the pan. But as written you bake in an half inch of butter then flip and continue which leaves the crispy outside washed off into the butter. No point in putting the crispy stuff on the outside if your going to soak it off.

As the other reviews have mentioned...this does come out soggy in the pan. I have cooked it on a rack in the oven w/ great results.  I do still cook it on the stove too because I get lazy & would rather dirty one pan instead of a sheet pan & rack. I know that's wierd!  This method is awesome on prok chops baked in the oven. No more shake-n-bake in this house. =)

It was fairly simple to make, but the taste was pretty boring.  I made it for a group of my friends, and while none of them hated it, none of them really liked it either.

Recipe wasn't too bad.  The flavors of mustard and lemone and lime juice was nice but it doesn't get into the chicken much.  Would probably marinade it for longer to increase the flavor of the chicken.  Over all not bad.

Hubby liked this recipe, I'm not sure it's my "cup of tea". Funny, I read the reviews saying too lemony and my complaint is that I couldn't taste the lemon. I'm not giving up on this recipe though, I think I might marinate the chicken with the lemon and mustard for a couple of hours next time and see if that improves the lemon flavor for me. Otherwise, hubby enjoyed it, he said he could taste the lemon, so maybe it's just me.

Used two lemons and 6 limes to = 3/4 c. Doubled all spices except salt. Marinated in bag 3-4 hrs. Used no butter but instead sprayed baking dish. Was not soggy.  Like someone else, boiled the rest of the marinated then I thickened it with remaining breadcrumbs then added apple cider to create the right consistency.  The next time I made it, just boiled the marinade only and poured it over the chicken.  It was equally as good.  I did have to bake it an additional 15 minutes after turning, for a total of 45 minutes after turned.

I only marinated my chicken (I used breasts) for 15 minutes and this still had plenty of kick.  After reading some of the other reviews, I opted to spray each piece of meat with a non-fat butter spray after I had coated them in the crumb mixture.  It definitely wasn't soggy.  They turned out well and I will make this again.  However, the leftovers weren't very desireable because they were soggy!

As much as I like citrus w/chicken we found this to be too much - needs something to balance the acidic flavor.  The topping became soggy and needed more seasoning than the recipe calls for.  Edible, but not a dish I would make again.

I made this recipe last night, & it was very good. However, I agree with other reviewers who said that the chicken would benefit from being marinated in the citrus juice - mustard. The other problem I had was losing the flavorful breading mixture when I turned the chicken after the first 20 minutes because it stuck to the bottom of my skillet. I wonder if dredging the chicken first in flour might solve this.

My fiance loved this recipe.  I had my oven at 400 degrees to help crisp the chicken up a bit.  Super easy and really moist.  I will definitely make this again.

The dish was tasty, however there was way too much marinade for the chicken.  You could cut the juices and mustard in half and still have enough for coating the chicken thighs.
Everything else was great, and the chicken came out excellent.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The chicken was nice and tender. The only thing I did differently was change the oven temp. to 400 to get the outside nice and crispy. The 350 temp was way too low for this, at least in my oven.

This was a very tasty recipe.  The curry was a nice addition, and not to dominating.  I didn't really taste the lime.  Also, the breading can fall off easily, so be careful when turning them and keeping them out of their own juices would help.  I liked the pop of the lemon with the zest as well.  Overall, a good recipe and a nice change to the typical baked chicken recipes.

This has become my “go to” recipe for Greek Lemon Chicken.  I follow the recipe exactly except I marinate the chicken in a gallon bag with the mustard, lemon and lime juice for a few hours before baking. 2 Lemons and 2 limes give a perfect amount juice to match the recipe. Thank you for sharing!!!

Delicious recipe. Pretty quick and easy to make. I used boneless thighs, spicy brown mustard, and panko for the breadcrumbs. It only took about 30 minutes to bake and I didn't flip them over (I tried and all the breading came off so I left the rest alone). My kids loved it too!

Prepared the recipe as directed, and it was quite flavorful. The only thing is that for me the crumbly coating seemed to fall off mostly. Next time I will put less butter in the pan and see if that helps.

This was good but I used some alternative ingredients. Chicken breast instead of thighs, I used garlic, salt pepper, oregano and basil in the bread crumbs and I baked it in a high speed convection oven for 35 minutes. Outside was crispy, inside was juicy. But the recipe inspired me!

Very good - got raves from everyone.  I've used all lemon or all lime from a bottle, depending on what I have on hand.  Turns out great.   In response to another person's comment about decreasing the butter.  That happened once and it wasn't as good - a bit dry.

Great flavor, even without the lemon zest.  I only had chicken tenderloin pieces on hand, and used Japanese Panko breadcrumbs.  Next time I'll use regular breadcrumbs, as the mustard/juice mixture wasn't thick/tacky enough to support the large Panko crumbs.

I listened to the reviews that suggested to marinate the chicken for an hour before breading. I also sprayed the top of the chicken with I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter before turning over. It was de-lish. Like a spicy fried chicken.

I marinated the chicken thighs all day and used only 2 tbsp butter before baking. I think next time I will make extra sauce to pour over the top after it is done in the oven. Excellent flavor and very moist. I made it with jasmine rice and sweet potatoes along with sour dough bread. Yummo!!

Very tasty chicken! Instead of bread crumbs I coated the (skinless) chicken thighs with flour and crushed pretzels. Used the leftovers in chicken pot pie. The citrus juices gave it a nice kick.

Right now this stands to lower rating simply per my method of cooking: George Foreman instead of the BBQ.  Will try again with bone-in chicken.  A bit dry with skinless boneless.

This recipe is great! I left it the way it was and it turned out fabulous...and fierce. Like Richard Simmons. Don't be scared to try it because it is awesome!

This was really great.  I lightly coated the chicken with the lemon-mustard mixture and used a coarse ground mustard.  I had a lot of the mixture left over and I should have just thrown it out or made a dressing out of it.  When you add the rest of it to the pan, it makes the bottom of the chicken soggy.

Thank you for a great chicken recipe.  I used boneless chicken breasts and marinated them for 4 hours.I also cut the butter to 3 T. as suggested. This is a keeper.

I left out the curry powder and added cumin and Penzey's Tuscan Sunset spice mix instead. I also didn't use as much butter - probably about 4 T. I also turned the oven to 400 degrees and cooked the chicken 20 minutes on each side. It crisped up really nicely.

I marinated it overnight and i did not use breadcrumbs. The chicken still came out a little dry, but i used breast tenderloins, since theyre little chicken strips and it made a great apitizer that everyone loved.

This was pretty good, but the flavors were a little too strong for me. Chicken was nice and tender though!

the spices in the coating were GREAT together--i was a little worried about the curry but it blended well...all the coating remained behind in the pain after baking however...all in a lumpy soggy pile. (AND i had browned first!) i think maybe it should have been baked at a higher temperature.

GREAT!!!  We had everything but the lime, so . . . we replaced the lime with "Mikes Hard Lime" beverage and the "curry" was replaced with a spice blend. It was GREAT!  Thanks

Great recipe that will be a staple in my home now.  Chicken turns out very moist.  The only thing I do different is I use olive oil because I don't like to cook with butter.
