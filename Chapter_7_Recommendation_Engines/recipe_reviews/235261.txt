A smoothie has to have some thickness and texture, and this recipe calls for no frozen fruit or ice, so in that respect, it’s not really a smoothie to me, just a fruit-yogurt drink.  I did add quite a bit of crushed ice which didn’t dilute the flavor it too badly, used vanilla Greek yogurt and  pomegranate-blueberry juice (both what I had on hand) and was quite happy with the taste.  As I always do with smoothies that have oatmeal, I first ground/pulverized the oats in the blender and then added the rest of the ingredients.  Pretty good, but it does either need frozen blueberries or ice IMO and at least for me, I'll cut the cinnamon in half if I make this again.

Okay, this was interesting. It was not quite thick like other smoothies I make. It tasted like blueberry yogurt juice. Only changes I made was using frozen blueberries and cutting the amount of sweetener in half and it was plenty. Not a smoothie I would make again, as it was too thin for my taste and I am just not a fan of smoothies with more than a couple of Tablespoons of yogurt. However, it's healthy enough to get me through the afternoon. ty

I tried this recipe and I too found it on the thin side for my taste. I used a cup of frozen blueberries and a frozen banana to thicken it. I also used raw honey to sweeten. For a change up you can substitute cranberry juice for the pomegranate juice.

It was ok, I added some ice cubes and that helped A lot with the texture.
