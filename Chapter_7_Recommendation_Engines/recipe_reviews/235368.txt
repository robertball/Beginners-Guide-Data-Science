I made this and the pork was so flavorful and delicious. I also like that it wasn't too complicated and used ingredients that I typically have in my kitchen. Mmmm Mmmm.

This was delicious.. I never have cooked with brown ale before and I like it very much. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory BBQ sauce. Will definitely make this again next time pork is on sale
