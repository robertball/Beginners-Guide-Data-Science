This is awesome! My mom has been making this forever, but she never put the beans or shredded cheese in it, that's something I'll have to try (and instead of Catalina Dressing, she always put mayo with a splash of lemon juice), and she adds bacon (lots of crispy fresh fried up bacon all crumbled up, yum!). This salad has got to be the best in the world!

YUMMY! I dont need to say anymore. I woulden't change a thing, except I substituted some of the tomato for salsa for more of a kick.

Excellent! We needed to bring a salad to a Mexican-themed dinner. This was perfect! Everyone raved about the taste, and it was VERY easy to throw together. TOTALLY making this again!

My daughter made this to go with my birthday dinner (fried chicken, this salad, mashed potatoes and gravy, and corn... YUM!). The flavors are fabulous together! The only modification I suggest is to double it!

Not only is this salad visually stunning,  it tastes Incredible ! ! O M G!! I only had Bushes mesquite baked beans in the house so I used those. And this IS after all a Mexican salad so I used queso fresco in place of the cheddar. The tortillas chips with a hint of lime settled right into the nicely as well:) Now I can't remember the time when I bought Catalina dressing, if ever, but man did it go Fan fricken tastic in this super Summer salad!!! Please!! give this salad a go at your next get together,  potluck,  bbq. This IS a keeper!! Thanks so much LWoods111:)

This was an excellent pot luck salad. My only complaint is that after a couple of hours the fritos get mushy so it needs to be served promptly.

I found myself in a pinch for a side dish to go with a Mexican casserole, and I had almost all these ingredients on hand (was missing the avocado).  My son and his wife LOVED it!  I did, too!  I have made it twice since and will serve it again tomorrow--I'm hosting a work party with 20+ guests and it will be the main side to go alongside the entree!  YUMMO!

Have eaten this salad on numerous occasions but I have never made it myself.  Needed a salad for a dinner and searched for a Mexican themed salad.  Received  many compliments for this salad.  Was a hit so have saved this recipe for the future.  Easy to make.

I enjoyed this recipe. Tried to upload a photo, but it wouldn't let me for some reason. I made this as an appetizer to our main course, Creamy Burrito Casserole. I didn't measure my torn romaine lettuce; I just bought a 10 oz. bag of Hearts of Romaine, and used the whole thing. I also substituted shredded cheddar cheese with shredded Mexican cheese. I didn't rinse or drain the ranch style beans; just dumped it in. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. (I try to take the easy approach on most things.)

I admit, everyone loved it! However, next time, I plan on adding 1 more cup of cheese, 1 more cup of corn chips, and at least another 1/4 cup of Catalina dressing.

However, this combination is spectacular! Wouldn't want to add anything else to this. It did take me about 35 minutes to make; I made it while my casserole was in the oven.

This recipe is also good enough to just be dinner. Both my roommate and I agreed we would enjoy making just this and having it for dinner one night. Thanks so much!

The Catalina dressing is a nice change from the typical dressing used on taco salads.  I’m not a Frito's fan and if I made this again, I would go with plain corn chips.  Very easy to toss together and quite filling as a meal.

I am puzzled by the photograph.  It looks like crumbled feta or goat cheese mixed in with the other ingredients.  What am I seeing?  I plan to made the recipe as written this week.  I'll rate high in anticipation of being informed and pleased.  Thanks.
