I make these all the time with Tommy Bahama light rum and Sprite.  The Sprite makes it light and refreshing.  The grenadine makes it look like a Shirley Temple.  So good by the pool!

Tasty, though a bit sweet. I used Captain's Tattoo Rum.

Used Bacardi Rum, Rose's grenadine and Pepsi-Cola; itasted a bit like medicine.  I added more cola, but it didn't help.

This is a little sweet, but it IS smooth and tasty!  I did cut back on the Coke that I used for thisw drink.  I'd make this again.  Thanks for the idea of this!

I have always loved cherry coke so was happy to find this recipe. The sweetness from the grenadine and rum was balanced by the sting of the carbonated coke. Yum!

Really good and easy to make.  I use half as much grenadine and diet cola.
