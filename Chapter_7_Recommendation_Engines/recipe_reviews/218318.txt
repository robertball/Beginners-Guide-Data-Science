I recognized this as a slightly modified Weight Watcher recipe, so I thought I would give it a try.  While the butter spray shaves off a fat gram or two, I found that the breading never really gets crispy or golden brown like a true parmesan chicken.  By comparison, I still prefer frying the chicken in a hot skillet with a small amount of olive oil until the outside is golden and crispy (about 3min per side.)  Transfer to a baking dish, top with sauce and cheese and bake until the chicken is done and the cheese is melted.   Also, you can use Italian seasoned bread crumbs rather than using plain and adding seasonings.

I made my own marinara sauce and I doubled the spices in the breading as well as added garlic/onion powder. I did not use butter-flavored spray, either. I used a mixture of butter and extra virgin olive oil and I browned the breasts in the hot skillet before laying them in a baking dish and finishing them off. My family liked this meal very much, it was a nice change from spaghetti sauce with ground beef or sausage. They actually asked me to make this again soon. Next time, I'll make an extra breast for my husband as he wanted seconds and there wasn't enough for him to have another.

My picky (REALLY picky) 7 yr old LOVED this recipe.  I recommend choosing a thick and robust spaghetti sauce for best results.  A few changes I did was to use 1/2 c. italian seasoned breadcrumbs and 1/2 c. panko breadcrumbs.  I baked the chicken on parchment paper to help it stay crispy and for the non-stick benefit.  It was crispy when done and the entire family loved this recipe, it is going into our regular menu rotation!

Really great recipe, we made the chicken without the sauce, and without the mozzarella cheese, but just substituted extra parmesan for it and it was very good!

Do quick and easy. Dinner done within 45 minutes. I added a little sugar to the sauce and used chicken tenders. I was out of mozzarella cheese, so I had to use mild cheddar instead. It was delicious and my family loved it.

I followed advice of first browning in the pan and I also added garlic powder and extra Parmesan (we are big Parmesan lovers) and it was very tasty!

I really liked this recipe. I added a bit more of each herb as well as using seasoned breadcrumbs (since I read some reviews about how the recipe wasn't booming with flavor). I also added some garlic and onion powder which I think really made it for me!

TIP: Whenever I make any sort of breaded chicken I always use the leftover breadcrumbs to make a "breadcrumb bed" for the chicken chicken to sit on. I find it helps crisp it and it's flips/is removed from the pan without losing a side of breading.

Really delicious. I added a bit more of the dry herbs by accident and it worked out fine. Used panko crumbs and olive oil spray. Only issue was it didnt brown, but I stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes before adding cheese and that helped. Served this with Trader Joe's Tomato Basil marinara.. yum

This was great, I used seasoned bread crumbs so didnt season as the recipe said, I will season it next time for sure because there wasnt enough in the crumbs. Great dinner, family loved it. Making again this week! Thanks for the recipe
