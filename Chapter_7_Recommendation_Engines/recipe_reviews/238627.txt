Awesome, simply awesome!! I did modify it a bit. I added 18 cubes of ice, 2.5 cups of milk, same sugar (but added natural cane sugar), and tossed in 5 frozen stawberries. Blended it until smooth. It tastes awesome!

I've made it twice already. The first time, I used peppermint extract and the amount of sugar that the recipe calls for. It was way too sweet and I couldn't finish it. The second time, I used a third of the sugar and vanilla extract. It was still too sweet.

I was so surprised at how good this tastes for milk and ice. It's so creamy! I used 6 ice cubes, 1 cup of milk, 3 tablespoons of sugar and a tablespoon of vanilla extract. This will probably end up being my go to recipe for milkshakes from now on!

I normally don't have a sweet threshold but this was sweeeetttttt. I also needed a bit more ice- I added about 24 pieces. Next time I will try to put half the sugar. Very good though and also adaptable!

All I did different from this recipe was I added probably 10 or 20 more ice cubes than the recipe called for and I didn't measure the vanilla extract. This ice cream was really good and was exactly the taste I was craving.

I modified it using sweet condensed milk and Lactaid milk and added more ice cubes to thicken. It's really good!!!!!! I may try it with strawberries the next time!

I added some mango and only added 1/2 cup of sugar. It was still too sweet. If I make it again i'll add even less sugar.

This was so much better than I thought it would turn out. I did however change some things. I used 15 ice cubes, 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract, 3/4 cup sugar and 6 frozen whole strawberries. It was very yummy. Next time, I think I'll use 1 tsp of vanilla extract. It's what I intended to use this time but wasn't paying attention. It made 2 - 3 milkshakes about 16 oz. I used 20 oz glasses but left room for whip cream.

I used 14 cubes instead to thicken it a little and plan on making it again in different flavors. Works great when I don't have ice cream around!

This was great! Threw in some frozen bananas chucks and an additional half of banana frozen and six ice cubes. 1 tsp of peanut butter, dash of vanilla extract, 1/8 cup of light agave and 2 cups of milk.

This was OK, but didn't feel it had the creaminess of using ice cream, and felt it probably only needed half of the sugar listed.

I have made this several times. I have to do less ice and less sugar because otherwise it leaves bits in the bottom of the little blender I use. I use slightly less milk but I like to add more vanilla for more flavor.

More ice is right, I needed 24 instead of 12. Also used unsweetened creamy cashew milk instead of whole milk. That dropped my total calories to 57.5 per serving (or 230 calories for the whole recipe). Don't feel like I'm missing out on any sweetness at all. I was also craving chocolate so I added 1/2 tsp baking cocoa, nom.

This milkshake looked very creamy and delicious but unfortunately it was way to sweet! Once I added the sugar there was no taking it back, I tried adding more milk and then fruit but nothing seemed to balance out the sweet taste. I will not make this again but if you are determined to try it I would use a third of the sugar maybe less.

Super easy and quick to make! I did make a few tweaks, I added 1/3 cup of sugar instead of what was recommended and that alone was sweet enough so I can't imagine how sweet it must be at 3/4 cup. I also added a few more ice cubes and Hershey's chocolate syrup for a chocolate shake. Yum! Will make again.

Fantastic!  Quick and easy for a fast snacks for the kids.  Used 1/2 ice and 1/2 frozen strawberries, extra vanilla, vanilla almond milk and even added a scoop of organic superfruits powder.  Thank you for the great recipe!

It's really good but I recommend cutting the sugar amount by a half or just using 6 tablespoons, I thought it had too much sugar and tried it first instead of the original 3/4 cups and it has a great amount of sweetness. 
(Edit)
Ok , So it was a bit different since I split the batch in two since my blender wasn't very big and had mostly only used 3 tablespoons and it was really foamy and lovely.

This was really good. I took the advice of others and doubled the ice and only put a little over 1/4 cup of sugar. O also added strawberries and a banana.

Great idea but for me it was a tad too much sugar, too little ice, and too little vanilla. I used 1/2 cup sugar, 3 cups of ice and 2 cups of milk and it turned out perfect

Ok this is my first time making it and I don’t have a blender so i made it in those blenders that you make smoothies with and it turned out great. Um for that i cut the recipe in half and it didn’t  turn out thick how I wanted it but if I do it again and I have time I would keep it going a little more to see how it goes but it was great!

Wasn't great. I had high hopes for this milkshake seeing the reviews, I have been looking for a no ice cream milkshake for a while now, but Unfortunatly this was disappointing. Much to sweet for my liking and didn't look anything like the picture.

I used half the sugar and added half a teaspoon of honey. I also made the vanilla milkshake, poured half into a cup and mixed it with cocoa powder, then poured the vanilla on top. Next time I’m making a neopolitan and adding a strawberry layer!

I added only 2/4 cup of sugar and I also added 5 frozen strawberries and a half bottle of chocolate syrup.  It was very good. You might want a full bottle of syrup though. over all wasn’t very creamy. Also recommended freezing it for 15 minutes for a better texture.

Just made this and instead of vanilla we did nestle chocolate and it's super yummy, makes enough for two large glasses!

Since there are 4 servings in the recipe, I found that adding more than a dash of vanilla was necessary for getting the right flavor in the milkshake.

Great recipe when you are craving a milkshake and don't have ice cream!  I only used 1/2 cup sugar and threw in some strawberries and we loved it!

Its amazing and delicious. I thought it wouldn't work but I was shocked at how good it was. A little to sweet so I recommend using a little bit less sugar.
