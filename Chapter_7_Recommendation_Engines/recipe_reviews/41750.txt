It was the first time I had ever cooked ham in a bag and it was truly excellent. I did not cook it for 2 hrs at 350, I slow roasted it at 200 for about 6 hours and the flavor went all though the ham. I was afraid it could be dry because of the length of time slow roasting but it was not. I also had marinated the ham in the bag with all the ingrediants over nite prior to baking. Again, it turned out great.

Mmmmmmm!!!!  This is the first ham I've ever made, and I made it for Christmas dinner, along with scalloped potatoes, baked dill carrots, corn pudding, rolls, and salad.  It was just myself, my brother, and my dad, but we all thought this was the best ham ever!  It was cheaper than a fancy store bought ham, and tasted better.  In addition to looking gorgeous, it was sooooo sweet and tender, it was falling apart.  The glaze is also really simple to prepare.  The only problem I had is I kept making holes in the oven bag when I was cutting the diamonds into the unbaked ham, so I'd recommend doing that BEFORE putting it in the bag (I thought I'd save some dishes), and be careful with the toothpicks not puncturing the bag when you put on the pineapple!  Also, buy the biggest oven bag you can find.  Our ham took about 45 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said, and it was also 10 pounds.  I think it's important to use an oven bag because it keeps the ham nice and moist.  The glaze didn't reduce like I thought it would, but I put it in a bowl in the refrigerator then took off all the solidified ham fat (eww!) on the surface and it was a great sauce!  This is definitely a repeat, thanks for the recipe!  I've wanted to have a ham like this since I was a little girl...

Wow, I made this recipe today and have NEVER heard anyone rave about how juicy a ham was until today.  I used an 8-lb. butt portion, and scaled the recipe to 18 servings.  I placed the dressed up ham in the bag with the juices the night before and just took it out the next day an hour before oven time.  I baked it at 325 degrees until it reached 160, about two and a half hours.  I let it sit for about 15-20 minutes in the bag while I finished the sides.  I basted it twice during baking, but didn't need to.  Tip:  prepare the ham, i.e., score, pineapples, cherries, etc.  Then place the empty bag in a pan, and then put the ham in the bag, and pour juices over.  Once the ham is in the bag, you can't move it without the toothpicks piercing it!  This ham needs no sauces to cover it ... it stands on it's own, and that opinion was unanimous.  Try this, it's terrific and easy cleanup is a bonus.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  This will be my standard method of preparing ham from now on.  I deviated from the recipe somewhat in that I forgot to buy oven bags at the store.  Therefore I scored my ham, mixed the marinade and poured it over my ham, uncovered in a roasting pan.  I had a 15 pound semi-boneless ham and therefore cooked it for ~ 2 hrs and 45 minutes.  I probably basted it 3 to 4 times while it cooked.  It turned out fantastic.  I did wait to place my pineapple slices and cherry halves on during the last hour of cooking, as I was afraid they may burn if placed on the ham sooner (since I was cooking mine uncovered). To me this recipe defines the traditional holiday ham.

This was good, but I was a bit disappointed with the flavor.  I didn't use an oven bag so that I could baste the ham, but it still did not have as much flavor as I would have liked.  The most flavorful of course was the bottom part that was cooked in the glaze for the full 2 hours.  I liked but will find a way to keep more of the glaze on the ham.  Thanks for the post.

This is the best tasting ham I have ever made or tasted that anyone else has ever made! I have never been able to make great ham and I have finally found the perfect recipe! EVERYONE LOVED this and there were NO leftovers! I followed the recipe exactly and my children thought I was a genius because they have never had ham like this. The cherries make it delicious and beautiful!

Made this ham for Easter Sunday and got rave reviews from the family.  I did a 9 pound shank and cooked it at 300 degrees for a little over three hours, basting every half hour or so.  (I didn't use the oven bags because they're a pain in the butt in my opinion).  Even without using the bag, this ham still came out very tender and not at all dried out.  I took the advice of some other members and tried bringing the leftover juices to a boil with some cornstarch but my "gravy" didn't thicken up... not sure what I did wrong.  It still tasted great when poured over the ham.  Overall very pretty and even more tasty!  Thanks Rita!

This is overall a really tasty recipe.  I tried recipe this 2 ways to see which is the best.  The first time I did not use the bag and I did not use the Cherry Juice.  I substituted the Cherry Juice for Pineapple Juice..  also  I cut way back on the maple sryup (only half) of what the recipe calls for. I basted the ham quite often until it was done...  It was so good. Since I read so much about cooking the ham in the bag I tried it that way and followed the recipe exactly how it was written.  The ham was to sweet and it had a reddish tint to it from the Cherry juice.  The bag was a hassle and the juice just sat at the bottom.  I am glad I tried it both ways. I will not use the bag again for this recipe.

I have made this receipe for several years now, Christmas, Thanksgiving, potlucks...  I do not change a thing with regards to the ingredients, except I throw in the juice from the pineapple too.  I place the scored ham in my crock pot, put the pineapple rings and cherries on it and pour the prepared sauce over the ham and cook it for 6-7 hours. The end result tastes as great as it looks!

This was so wonderful! I marinated the ham overnight with orange juice, pineapple juice and ginger ale.  Then put in a deep roasting pan and cooked halfway covered tight with foil and with all the marinade.  Then i added pineapple slices halfway and cherries, and cloves. Then put brown sugar over the whole thing and finished cooking for the remainder of time, and of course basted frequently! It was soooooo good and juicy, my family loved it for easter, it was so moist it melted in our mouths! thanks

I'd give it two stars, but the ingredients were expensive, and the sauce has a peculiar aftertaste and not a very pleasant aroma.  I started with an excellent spiral ham that would have done well on its own.  However, this recipe had rave reviews, so I thought I'd try it.  The genuine maple syrup and honey were expensive, but I had high hopes.  It would have been better to baste the ham rather than to bag it, as the top ended up dry and the bottom is soaked in an expensive and odd tasting concoction that includes orange juice, maraschino cherry juice and ginger ale.  You have to be careful with the bag and the juice level, or you'll end up with a carbonized sugary mess in your oven.  I also made the mistake of using Diamond party toothpicks (food-safe no-run color) which did bleed into the pineapple rings (gross - thanks Diamond!)  I'm going to have several friends and family over to try it, and hopefully we will like it once it's cooled down a little more.  Just a horrible, expensive mess in my view that ruined a perfectly good ham and a cup of genuine maple syrup and organic honey.

This was my first attempt at making Christmas dinner and I am so glad I trusted this recipe.It was perfect!! The only thing I would change next time is to put pineapple and cherries on halfway through cooktime, they were falling off and soggy. I did not use a bag and basted every 15minutes or so which was so worth it.Yummy!! This recipe is a Christmas keeper.

All I can say is WOW. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I made sure to score the ham well so all the juices can really go into the ham. Everyone said it was juicy to the bone and it wasn't overly sweet. I will definitely use this recipe again!

disappointing. The ham never soaked up the liquid - at all  - and none of the flavor seemed to "stick".

DELICIOUS!!  Made this for Easter and my friends and family said it was the best ham ever.  I did a few things different to make my day run a little easier.  I followed the recipe but I prepped this the night before and allowed the ham to soak up the juices over night.  Then I removed the ham and juice from the oven bag in order to bake it in my electric roaster.  I basted about every thirty minutes.  AMAZING!  This will be our official Easter ham from now on!!!!!!

I hate ham but made it for Christmas anyways.  This is the first ham I ever made and it was delicious!  Everyone raved on how good it was, they were telling the truth because there were hardly any left overs!  I bought the cheapest ham I could find and it still was incredible! I let it marinate overnight in one oven bag and transferred it to a new one in the morning.  I am not a good cook and have burnt jello before, so for this to turn out great says something for the recipe!  Thank you Rita!

I used Rita's ham for Easter (my first time cooking a ham)-everyone raved!  I cooked exactly as stated in the recipe.  I used an 8 lb ham for 2.5 hrs.  Used a larger oven bag so as not to rip, and also cut the ends of the toothpicks shorter so they wouldn't poke through the bag.  Will definitely use again!

I made this for my family for Easter dinner...FANTASTIC!!!! We just loved this ham, moist and out of this world flavor! I will be using this recipe for my hams from now on!!! I also made gravy from the ham juices by mixing a little corn starch in water and adding it to the juice and cooking it in a saucepan until it was just the right consistancy, out of this world gravy, good on everything!

This was wonderful!  I would have liked to have more pineapples so I'd suggest maybe buying a second can.  If you don't open it, you can always open it later.  Also, I reduced the left over sauce and added about a table spoon of corn starch (mix it with a little water first!).  It made a nice sauce to serve with it.  I prepared this for a dinner party of 15 people with sides and I still have enough to make bean soup today.  I'd definitely recommend this!!

I have used this ham recipe for 4 years now and I will never change it. I have been asked to make the ham every year, as everyone says it is the best. I make it exactly as directed, and reccomend not making changes.

This is my go to recipe for holiday ham.  the picture looks just like my grandmas and it tastes like it too! I don't use the oven bag - just cover it tightly with aluminum foil and you get a similar result. I made a sauce from the glaze plus drippings by placing them in the a measuring cup and popping it into the freezer for 15mins, skimming the fat and then added some pecans and cherries to the sauce. Delish!

I didn't have the gingerale but there was more than enough liquid. After baking, the ham didn't appear glazed. It was very tasty the next day. The meat didn't absorb the flavor until my husband sliced the whole ham and let it soak in the juices. The next day, the ham was delicious. We ate ham for 3 days and it was good each time. I would make it again. I will try to have the gingerale next time to see the difference.

I cut the recipe in half, cooking a 6 pound uncooked ham, and it was fabulous!  I used a Smithfield ham and let it soak in cool water at room temperature for about 3 hours.  Then, I followed the recipe (in half) and cooked the ham for 3 hours at 325.  It turned out so juicy and delicious.  The cherries also turned into a lovely candy-like consistency.

OOOOOOHHHHHHHH is this good.  My family ate and ate this great ham.  We were not sure of how many people would be here-so we bought a whole ham that weighed 17 pounds.  Used the recipe as is and had plenty of sauce.  I did open the bag after 2 hours and brushed the ham with the sauce.  Took longer because of the size-but it was so moist and tender and tasty.  I will never make a ham any other way.  I also followed the advice of using the sauce for a gravy.  Just add corn starch and boil. This was so great it deserves a five plus plus stars.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was fall off the bone moist.  Very sweeeeet.  The cooking bag is genius.  I'm not a big marachino cherry fan, and it does have some of that taste.  Next time I will leave the marachino juice out of the marinade.  Made for a great Easter dinner.  Thanks!

I have been making this ham recipe for the last three years - in the past we have purchased very high end, spiral cut tavern hams, and let me tell you that I now purchase the lowest per pound priced hams and cook them in a bag using this recipe and they are by far, the best hams my family and friends have tasted... very moist and flavorful!

Awesome recipe!  Used this recipe to cook my first ham and everyone loved it.

I took other reviewers advice and marinated it over night in an oven bag.

As an old single guy... I'm always looking to find recipes that are easy, healthy and meet the needs of the time. This recipe was all of that and more...I used a non-precooked country ham so increased the baking time by an hour...reached the 160f ,took it out of bag, let it set and voila...you'd think i knew what I was doing . Delicious !!!!

I guess I have to join the bandwagon on saying that my ham did not absorb the juice. Other than that, my ham came out very tasty and I loved it. I used a spiral cut ham and removed the oven bag half way to see if the juices would evaporate in oven. Afterwards  just used glaze packet that came with ham and added some of the juice from the recipe and used them combined to keep ham basted. Will definitely use this recipe again.

First time using this recipe and while I didn't see it as being very unique at first glance I'd never used a bag for ham before and this had a few additional ingredients in the sauce.  And it was AWESOME!  I'll do it this way every time with no changes.  For newer cooks, ham is one of the easiest things to cook – just don’t overcook and you can’t go wrong.  This was really easy – prepare the ham with the pineapples and cherries first, put it in the bag and then pour over the sauce.  I did two 8Ib hams at once at 375 for just under 2 hours.  I carved one and put in the slow cooker, adding all the sauce left from cooking, for about an hour on low until we hit the road to see family.  Reheated upon arrival for about 30 minutes on low.  It was perfect! Can’t wait to eat the leftovers!

I made this ham for Christmas.  I have to say that this was by far the best ham I have ever made.  In fact, it was also the best ham that I have ever had!  This was the first time that I have had people rave about the ham.  I went a little further and let the butcher bone, score and tie it for me so that it would be easy to cut.  I will definately make this again.  Thank You Rita!!!!!

This is the best baked ham I have ever made.  Everytime I make it there is not a bite left. Definitely, use an oven bag and put pineapple and cherries on before putting it in the bag.  Then put in the bag and pour the glaze over.  Thanks for the great recipe.

YUM, YUM, YUM.  I used this for our family xmas party.  Rave Reviews from everyone.  The best ham I have ever had.  This was also the first ham I ever cooked.  Had a 20lb ham took about 5 hours to cook.  All I had to do was make the sauce put it and the ham in the bag and forget about it. If you want to impress, this is the recipe for you.

This was scrumptious!  I thought it might be too sweet for my husband, but it was perfect!  I didn't have any honey, but I couldn't tell any difference by leaving it out.  I also didn't drain the pineapple juice.  I added to the orange juice.

I found this ham to be dry compared to my usual Ham recipe; it didn't realy baste inside the bag and you couldn't manually baste it because it WAS inside the bag.  Also, it took longer than 20 mins. to prepare and the bag split when i tried to put 1/2" slits in it. It was also quite difficult to get out of the plastic bag when done.  In my opinion, not worth all the extra trouble.

Not bad.... My mom's preparation is similar to this, but instead of purchasing a whole ham, she takes ham steaks, marinates them (same recipe as here), studs with cloves and then tops with crushed pineapple (no cherries). On the rare occasion she does bake a ham, she'll add pineapple rings and cherries. My only gripe (has been for years), is that all of the commercial hams available for purchase these days are smoked. No matter what glaze you slather it with, the smokiness is so predominant, it overpowers everything else. :( This didn't seem to bother my dinner guests in the least. Of an almost 7 lb. bone-in ham (butt), I had barely enough leftover for sandwiches the next day. According to my parents, I am the Easter ham queen (hooray!). Try this - even I can't mess this up lol! Thanks for sharing, Rita! :-)

I have been making this ham since 2004 and it is absolutely a hit at Easter time. My guests love it and it is a very easy recipe to follow. Thanks for sharing Rita's recipe.

I love making this ham.  I make it one of two ways:  One way is to boil the ham for an hour.  Carving it then placing it in a pan a pouring the glaze, pineapple and cherries over it.  I also add cloves for more flavor.  Every single piece of ham is nicely coated with the juices and very moist.

The other way is like this, except I don't use an oven bag and I stick the cloves in.

Ok first let me tell you that I joined the site just so I could rate this recipe.  Absolutely delish!!!  I followed the recipe to a tee except I marinated the ham over night.  This was my first time to cook a ham and it was to die for.

Loved it!! The only thing we did differently was not using a bag. So, we just waited until the last 1/2 hour or so to add the pineapple and cherries. It made the most wonderful gravy!

This was delicious.  Had 20 people for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was included the pineapple juice (just hate to throw it out).  I cooked it Wed and cut it up and then saved juice and put it in crock pot for Thanksgiving only because oven not big enough for a ham and turkey.  The family requested I make it again at Christmas.

This ham had a good flavor but after 2 hours the temp had only gotten to like 70, after almost 3 hours it was just over 100 and realizing it was already fully cooked we ate it.  So I'm thinking there is no way the temp would get to 160 in just 2 hours cooking it at 350 but after 2 hours it probably was warm enough to eat.

I have never made a ham before so I was pretty freaked out, but I wanted to prepare Easter dinner for the family and the in-laws.  I decided on this recipe based on the reviews.  I got a 9 pound bone in butt portion ham (the free one at the store) and didn't adjust the recipe, just kept it the same.  I did use the oven bag, although it was annoying.  I kept having the urge to baste but couldn't because of the bag.  And the ham does just kind of sit in the juice, so you are wondering the whole time how the juice will soak into the ham when only the bottom is sitting in it.  It did turn out very good though, and it looks really nice with the pineapple/cherry decoration.  Everybody gave it great reviews.  The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is that it didn't have that "wow, this is over the top!"  factor, but it was very good.  I will probably use this again.

This is the first ham I have ever cooked.  This recipe made it so juicy & tender, it about fell off the bone.  Everyone loved it and asked what I had used.  Definite keeper!!  It's easy, it's juicy and it gets you(the baker) rave reviews.  Thank you for submitting this.  I will use it from now on!

I promise you I am not making it up when I say, this is the best baked ham recipe, period.  I had a family favorite for years and I have changed it to this one.  Everyone thought I was a genius when I made this ham and it's better than grandma 's!  (I didn't use the cherries cuz I don't like them.)

I am a vegetarian, but I made this ham for my family on Thanksgiving. I scored and marinated it in the mixture overnight, and cooked it in the morning. Everyone said it was delicious! There was more than enough liquid to cover the ham, and next time I will add the pineapple and cherries before placing it in the oven bag.

I have made the ham two years in a row now for Christmas dinner. It has quickly become a tradition. It's juicy and flavorful! I love the pop of color the cherries and pineapple bring to the table.

This ham was good! I did not use the bag. Instead I used a roaster and basted a lot. Love all the fruit juices. I marinated it overnight to ensure the juice went all the way through.

Made exactly as written. The ham did not absorb the juices. The most flavorable pieces were the ones sitting in the juices. On the plus side, at least the ham wasn't dry. Too much trouble for a mediocre outcome & a waste of of semi-expensive ingredients. Glad I didn't make this on a holiday.

I loved the glaze, but the meat was SOOOOO dry.  I had used a spiral cut, and would not do that again.  Might even consider using same glaze, but different roasting method.

Made this for Easter this year. I followed all directions, with the exception of I used a uncooked butt ham in a aluminum pan and put it in the smoker. Ham was 6-7lbs, smoked it for about 7hrs 45 min, at 225, with Hickory chips. Turned out Great!

This is a great recipe- I am Jewish and never made a ham before- if I can do it, anyone can!  I generally followed the recipe, but i just added a bit of pineapple juice as suggested by some others - i also cooked it for 5 hours at a temp of approx 250 (sometimes raised to 300) and basted consistently.    I also made some gravy from the excess liquid by adding some cornstarch, also suggested by other reviewers.  Result = YUMMY!   Thanks Rita!

I have made this several times and it has always been a hit.  No more dry hams when you use the bag.  I prefer to let meat rest for at least 30 min prior to slicing.  I have modified the recipe and no omit honey and OJ.  Too sweet and strong of a citrus taste with it.  Kids love the slight taste of cherry.

I am not a fan of ham OR maraschino cherries but my family is.  When I found this recipe I thought what the heck. I made it as per instruction and as I was almost done cooking it I remembered we didn't have apple sauce, my hubby and kids prefer eating ham or any pork with applesauce but we went ahead w/o it.  OMG!! The ham was sooo good they didn't even miss the applesauce.  There is no need to change a thing!  This is how I will be making ham from now on thank you posting this.

Followed the exact recipe. It was my 1st Easter ham and I'm not the best cook (getting there), so my guests were a little scared, but when I popped this out of the oven it smelled wonderful and looked beautiful... taste results: OUTSTANDING!! Loved by all!

All I can say is WOW! This ham was the best ham I've ever had! I made this for Easter dinner I followed the recipe to a T, except I put it all together the day before and put it in the fridge over night so I wasn't having to mess with putting it together on Sunday morning.. This will be the way I make ham from now on! Thanks for a great recipe!

I did this recipe for Christmas dinner.  It was a big hit.  It was very moist with just a hint of sweetness.  I scored the ham outside of the bag first. Much easier!  I let it sit in the bag with the juices a day before I baked it.  This was my first baked ham and everyone said it was a definite do-over.

Wonderful!!!  We aren't even big ham fans but this was just great!!!  

I will say though that there was too much juice.  The recipe said that it will absorb it, that didn't happen in my case, the ham produced more juice and I ended up with more than I started with.  Next time I'll cut juices some.

I just loved the glaze to this ham.The
ham came out nice and moist with the
meat falling off the bone.We wanted a
ham we could slice.I had an uncooked ham.Next time I will not cover the ham.
When you cover the ham it ruins the glaze.I will only cook the ham for 3
hours.If you want to thicken the glaze
just mix 3 tbs.Of cornstarch with water.
you may add more cornstarch until glaze
is the consistency of German Chocolate Cake Frosting.Remove from heat let glaze
cool.The glaze will thicken more as it cools.When the glaze is cool spoon over
ham and use a basting brush.I will definetely be making this glaze again.

I used a 3 1/2 lb. spiral ham, so scaled the recipe down to 6 servings, and put it in the oven for 45 minutes.  THE best ham I've ever had.  After the meal, I put the leftover ham in a baking dish, then poured the liquid from the bag over the ham, and stored it in the fridge overnight.  The second night's meal was even better...the meat picked up more of the sweetness of the sauce.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I used a smaller ham about 9.63 lbs. and marinated it overnight. I did baste the ham while inside the bag using a turkey baster. I stuck the baster thru the slits in the top of the bag. I also added the juice from the pineapple and added more cherry juice for extra flavor. I had some issues with the cooking bag. About 1 1/2 hours into  cooking somehow the bag seared itself to the bottom of the baking dish I used and it came apart. The juice was all over the dish so I removed the ham from the bag and covered the ham with tin foil and rubbed brown sugar on the top of the ham. It turned out delicious! Very moist and flavorful. I will not use the cooking bag again, but I will definitely use this recipe for ham again! The juice made a wonderful gravy too!

This was absolutely the best ham I have ever made!  I prepared this recipe yesterday for a small house party.  I followed the directions pretty much exactly, except I attached the pineapple slices and cherries to the ham before putting it into the cooking bag.  It was so easy!  I was busy with the party and didnt even peek until the two hours were up and it was time to take the ham out.  I let it rest for about 20 minutes and then carved it up.  SO GOOD!  Will be making this again for sure!

First Ham, first Thanksgiving with the in-laws, and what rave reviews! The ham was super tender and tasted great! It was a little too sweet so next time I will add less cherry juice, but what a wonderful and easy recipe.

We LOVED this ham. I made it along with a turkey and fixings for Thanksgiving. It smelled wonderful and looked beautiful. Our ham was only 7 1/2 pounds but I kept the rest of the recipe the same. Everyone thought it was peculiar to use ginger ale but all doubts were banished once we tasted the ham. I have been asked to make the next Thanksgiving meal and this will be high on the menu.

I made this ham for Christmas Dinner and everyone LOVED it!  It used the of the least expensive ham in the grocery store (bone in - not spiral sliced) and it came out fabulous.  So good that now I've been asked to bring the ham for Easter dinner!

I'm sorry but this recipe didn't work out at all for our family. Unfortunately it ruined a $23. spiral smoked ham. No one liked it and I had such high hopes for my New Years dinner. I should have cooked the han the way I usually do. Sorry.

After reading all the reviews, I was really looking forward to trying this recipe. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I followed the directions exactly and the liquid did not get absorbed into the ham. The ham sat in the liquid and the top actually got a bit dried out. After using all of those ingredients, I thought the ham would be sweeter but it was not. It seemed like a waste of ingredients to me. Sorry!

ham didnt pick up much of the flavor but i think that was my fault, i bought a smoked ham cuz thats the last one they had and i think that was the problem. BUt since the sauce was good, i just carved the ham and dipped the pieces in it before i served them on the plate. that worked out good. interesting concoction (im a rookie ) but it was delicious.  hubby liked  :P

Hmmm, well the sweet mixture didnt add any flavor that I could tell. I spent about 7 dollars on the honey, maple syrup ect to make the mix and I feel that it wasnt worth the money. :(

This recipe is great and EVERYONE loved it!  After reading several reviews, I did the following: marinated the ham (11 lb butt) in the bag overnight, added the juice from the canned pineapple, did not cook in bag since bag was leaking.  Cooked it at 325 for 1 hour covered with foil, added pineapple slices and cherries after 1 hour, raised the temp to 350 for rest of cooking time, basted every 20 minutes.  The ham was very flavorful and juicy.  I will definitely make again!!!  Everyone said, "thank you Rita!".

Just cooked this for Christmas Eve dinner.  Followed the recipe most of the way, except I did not add the cherry juice.  I had a 24lb ham, scored my ham and marinated it overnight in all the ingredients except the cherry juice.  Then cooked it in my 18 quart cooker basting it every 30 minutes.  Came out perfect.  We also used the left over juice to make gravy, everyone was over stuffed and raved about the ham.

First time experimenting with a ham and will never buy another honey baked ham. This was awesome!  Didn't use the bag, scored it diamond shape and used whole cloves as well. We did a 20# ham cooked for 6 hours to 147 temp and basting with this recipe about every 30 minutes. I did have to tent it. Used the ham bone to make red beans and rice....Oh Yea!

I made this ham for Christmas. It was easy enough to mix up the ingredients and pour them into the baking bag along with the ham. I rate it with only two stars because 1) my ham didn't asborb any of the juice and 2) the ingredients are kind of expensive. The ham still tasted good; it just didn't have any of the flavor from this juice/glaze concoction.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!!! I make it every year for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. My family demands it because no other ham comes close to the juicy delicious magic that is this ham!!! I tend to add a little extra ginger ale and orange juice to cut the syrup and honey a bit. In the roaster, in the oven bag, either way comes out GREAT!!!!

I made this for my first ever attempt at Easter dinner and it was a huge hit! I made it exactly as is and everyone raved. Definitely a winner!

Such a good glaze for the ham! I think the carbonation from the ginger ale, really bumps it up! I've never had so many positive remarks, as I did last night, at Easter dinner - I, however, did not add the cherries or pineapple. I grilled sliced pineapple separately.

I have enjoyed making this recipe for Easter for the past 3 or 4 years!     It caught my eye a while back because Rita was my grandmother's name, and she always made a stellar baked ham. Since then, I go back to this recipe every year; each time I make it, my friends and family say that it's the best ham they ever had!  The only thing I add to it is to nestle whole cloves in some of the diamond shaped slices before cooking. You have to like clove flavor in order to do this, but I think it adds just the right kick.

I absolutely love this recipe, I mad it last year for Thanksgiving and it was a great success with my husband! He's a very picky eater and not afraid to let me know when somethings not good.  My ham turned out wonderfully Can't wait to make it again this year once again for my family!

I made this for my big Easter dinner.  It was a huge disappointment. The ham did not soak up any of the juice or flavor.  The bit of ham that sat in the liquid tasted a like Gingerale or a Shirley Temple.  The ingredients were so expensive too.  I would have been better off to just cook the ham as indicated by the package it came in, as use the glaze it came with.   Perhaps it would have been better with pineapple juice instead of gingerale as some reviewers did.  I think I'll stick to my grandmother's brown sugar glaze recipe for ham.

I usually will read reviews of a recipe before trying it.  It seems to me, that the two that were negative, that those 2 people might not have followed the recipe as they should have. Most reviews were very positive and I plan on trying this sweet ham recipe this Easter.

I have never made a ham before, but my husband requested one for our first Christmas together.  He wanted a sweet ham so I decided to give this recipe a try.  It was so easy.  We had friends over for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Two of us don't even like ham, yet we found ourselves taking seconds.  I am going to prepare a ham for Easter using the same recipe.

The flavors worked very well.  But the recipe says that the liquid would be absorbed by the ham.  None of mine did, but that was fine.

This was the first full sized ham I had ever cooked and came out great.  The only difference is I used sugar free maple syrup because that's what I use.  Great flavor and everyone went back for seconds and even thirds.  I'll be making this again for Christmas.

This was a very good recipe for ham - made it exactly as the recipe called for, with the exception of swapping out plain orange juice for pineapple-orange juice, and I did not add the cherries.  I think cooking in the bag kept it nice and moist and everyone commented on the good flavor.  The only thing I missed when compared to a honeybaked ham was the crusty brown sugar exterior.  Next time I try this, I might rub some brown sugar on it when it comes out of the oven then put it back in under the broiler for a few minutes.  Otherwise a very good ham.

Very nice!  I really liked the flavor of the finished product. There is only 2 of us so I used some of the left over to make egg, potatoe and ham breakfast burritos and it even tasted awesome like that.  I will be using this ham recipe for now on.

I absolutely hate candied ham so I'm going off of what everyone else said. I cooked the ham in a bag, which did cause a few extra holes. I also used toothpicks to hold it up off of the ham. It smelled absolutely wonderful and was gone immediately. My brother-in law actually took the bone to get off the last tidbits of meat. Several people asked for the recipe and I'm asked to make this every get-together now.

I recently used this recipe for Easter. It was a little last minute because I'm used to buying hams that come with a glaze packet and this one I got as a gift so I didn't realize it didn't have one until the day before Easter. I found this recipe and saw that I had most of the ingredients on hand so I gave it a whirl. I didn't bother with the oven bag {b/c I didn't have one lol}. I didn't have any ginger ale so just used the pineapple juice from the can of slices. I also studded the ham with whole cloves for a little spice. Followed the recipe for the sauce otherwise. Baked @ 200 degrees for 6 hours and basted a little bit during. The results were amazing!!! Even those who normally don't like ham loved this one. The ham didn't absorb all the liquid despite what the recipe says, though. Next time I'll use cornstarch and make a proper thick sauce but this time we just used the leftover liquid as a kind of dipping sauce and it was delicious. Thanks Rita you saved the day and maybe made it a little better!

Great ham! I added some of the pineapple juice to the mix and made it a little sweeter. I didn't bake it in a bag, I just baked it in the oven with tin foil over it for two hours then, I left it uncoverd and baked it for another 6 hours. I always get the ham with the fat on top of it, that way it keeps all the jucies of the ham inside without drying it out. Love the ham and so did my family. It is something I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and made no modifications.  I made this ham for my immediate family, and they all agreed it was way too sweet.  I found another ham recipe that is not as sweet, so we won't be using this recipe again.  It is a great recipe for those who enjoy really sweet ham.

THE BEST HAM THAT I HAVE EVER MADE!! I marinated the ham for over 24 hours in the oven bag with the pineapple & cherries already attached. I'm not really sure how much of a difference in the taste that makes. I did score the ham like the recipe says before marinating it. Before I put it in the oven to bake, I basted the ham one time right in the bag. Then I tied it up again & never touched it til it was done. Thank you so much Rita for sharing this excellent recipe!

This is a GREAT recipe!!!  My family LOVED it; it was so easy, I've become the "go to" person forholiday hams!!
Thanks so much for making my family's holiday meals special (unless I found a suitable baked ham dish, my daughter was going to boycott all holiday meals; Thank you Allrecipes.com for saving holiday meals/family gatherings from this horrendous threat of boycott!!!  LOL) )

I had been looking for a recipe like my mother used to make.  This wasn't it but it sure was good.  As usual, I followed the recipe to the "t" as it isn't fair to rate it if you have to change it.  My boyfriend loved it!  Mine didn't look as pretty as the picture but it all goes to the same place, right?  Looking forward to making this for the holidays.

The finished product looks great but even after marinating overnite, it did not enhance the flavor of the ham at all. The ham was a cooked high quality black forest ham and the sauce tasted just like a sweet sauce.  I am not sure what everyone was raving about.  Sorry, but I will not make this again.

Very good ham! I made this for the first time last thanksgiving and everyone loved it! and a couple times since! I like using Just orange juice without the ginger ale and i also make a little hole in the bag so i can baste while it is baking. It is so juicy and not to sweet! thanks for the great recipe!

I downloaded this for thanksgiving 4 years ago and I've been asked to make it again every year. This has become my signature holiday ham. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was a very good ham.  The sauce is very sweet, which makes it stand out from other hams.  We made a gravy out of the sauce and had it with mashed potatoes.  My family loved it and we only had a few leftovers.

This was my 2nd attempt at making a ham dinner.  (The 1st try, I won't even discuss!) If I had only found this recipe sooner! This was so moist. (And wonderful presentation too!) I didn't change a thing, other than the size of the ham.  I used an 8lb semi bone-in ham.  I still left the cook time for 2 hours though.  Some reviews stated that it didn't taste as sweet as they expected.  I used a smoked ham, and quite enjoy the flavor of the ham itself.  I was glad that this didn't over power that taste of the smoked ham, it kept it moist while cooking.  I did serve the juice as an "Au juice" as suggested, and it was wonderful as well.  I will use this recipe every time I have to prepare a ham! Thank you!!

We enjoyed the ham very much.  I used a smoked shoulder cut of meat.  Usually I boil the ham for about an hour and then put in in the oven and then prepare a glaze.  This recipe was so much easier.  I was a little concerned with the amount of ingredients but the ham was delicious and not at all salty.  We will difinitely used this recipe for our ham from now on.  So little time involved.

My husband and I had Christmas dinner for our parents and family in our home for the first time this year. This recipe will become our tradition for our Christmas dinner. All 11 of our guests loved this ham. I caught my husband smuggling some into the fridge early for his lunches because everyone kept picking at it.

This Ham is wonderful!! I have never cooked a ham before and made this for Christmas Dinner. It was great. I didn't use the oven bag though and put in a large casserole dish and covered it loosely with tin foil. It was still easy to clean up and tasted great. This is going to be our traditional Christmas Supper. Thanks a bunch.

Super Yummy!  This is going to be my "company ham recipe" now.  Thanks!  I also thickened the juices up with a little cornstarch to make an excellent "gravy".

If you love a sweet glazed ham, this is a great recipe!  It also made a wonderful gravy when cornstarch was added to the sauce at the end.  Thanks for the tip!

I cooked this for Easter dinner. What a smash! I did baste it the night before and the next time, I'm going to cook it at a lower temperature and for a longer time to get the juices in the ham. Although, it was just fine the way it was! I did cook it for about 1/2 hour more. My family is picky and all of them loved it. I served fresh buns, cheese scalloped potatoes and candied carrots. I am going to make this exact menu for a dinner party. There is no thought to any of it!

Wow! I made this for Easter dinner and was absolutely thrilled. I was a bit hesitant about using a baking bag as I thought it wouldn't get that nice browned look, but one taste of the results and all reservations were gone. Easily the moistest ham I'd ever had. I was also wondering if it'd be too sweet, but it really wasn't. Use the sauce (the consistency of an au jus) to pour over the ham. I was thrilled to find a recipe without cloves as my husband isn't a great fan of that spice. I used a 9-pound shank portion (the free one you get at the store!) and found that the 2-hour cooking time (or perhaps even a tad bit less) was just perfect. Yes, a bit time-consuming with the scoring and decorating, but all good things are worth the extra effort. Our meal was total Allrecipes...I served this with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad, Creamy Au Gratin Potatoes (with a slight modification), asparagas (OK, just steamed), and Moist Carrot Cake from Koribear with Cream Cheese Frosting from Sugar. Fantastic!

Made this for a couple of Christmas dinners for the family and its great.  Flavor is sweet and tangy and it keeps the ham quite moist which is not an easy task.

I have a lot of cooking experience, but this was my first time making a ham in the oven.  The ingredients are fine, but if you follow the cooking directions you will have a dry, tough ham - which is exactly what I had for my Thanksgiving meal yesterday :C.   After researching and talking to people who have made many good hams, my advice is DO NOT just put it in any roasting pan with the juice, tie it off, make a couple vents, and let it bake like the instructions tell you to do here..  if you want to make this, I suggest putting the ham and juices in an oven bag, fold the top closed but leave  the bag untied, and stop to baste the ham the entire time you cook it(google how often to baste based on size of ham etc.

I think this recipe was ok...but after using it twice, I think it has too much liquid.  It creates a watery diluted glaze that doesn't give much flavor to the ham.  If I used it again, I would cut back on the OJ and gingerale and add more brown sugar.

Great recipe. We used two cans of pineapple to completely cover the 13.5 lb ham. We cooked the ham in a large baking dish and covered it with foil the night before and then carved it up. We placed the sliced pieces of ham is the juice over night and reheated the next day in the baking dish in the juice at 350 for apprx 1 hour checking at 30 minutes and moving any pieces that were still cold into the warmed juice . Everyone said the ham was so delicious =)

I made this one year and it was so sweet and yummy. I got a lot of compliments.
But the years after I tried, I felt like the ham wasn't sweet. It still tasted salty. Does anyone have a recommendation on what I might be doing wrong? Kind of sad I cant get it right.

Delicious!  Did a few things different than the written recipe.  I brought a butt half (Cooks brand) and I marinated it the night before.  I did not use a cooking bag but put the marinade at the bottom of roasting pan and basted twice.  Served it for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.

Made for Thanksgiving 2017 and what a hit with the family.  I used a spiral ham as I am usually a last minute shopper and that was all that was left.  Still turned out really good.  Moist and juicy.  Will use again and again.  Thanks for sharing  this recipe!

Have to admit, I didn't follow the recipe as written for ingredients  but certain that if I had there  would have been a 5-star result... I used what I had on hand [don't like maraschino cherries and no ginger ale on hand]: fresh pineapple chunks; whole cloves inserted all over the ham at about 1-inch apart; passionfruit juice (yes passionfruit!!!); and the rest of the ingredients as written in the recipe. I did follow the instructions as directed. The result was the most juicy, tasty ham I've ever made! It uncharacteristically disappeared and received more rave reviews than my turkey at Thanksgiving this year. And that says a lot!

I followed the recipe exactly, and the ham did have good flavor and it looked GREAT!
But that sauce was expensive, and NONE of it was absorbed by the ham - in fact, the ham rendered down and I ended up with more sauce that I started with.  It was a spiral ham, and I put the spiral cut end on the bottom to give the BEST chance for absorption, and I did score the other end to help with this also, it just did not work.
We had a LOT of leftover ham (there were just four of us), so I put up the rest for the freezer in zip lock bags.  A few slices of ham and a couple dippers of sauce in each bag - it should freeze well and preserve well this way, and it kept me from just pitching all that sauce!
Next time, I will use pineapple slices and cherries on the ham, but the sauce will just be the envelope of glaze that comes with the ham.

I have made this ham twice now, once for Easter and the other for Thanksgiving.  The ham was such a hit during Thanksgiving that it overshadowed the turkey that was being served and I had practically no leftovers of the ham.
I let my ham sit in the juices overnight in the bag and I also found that the ham does not bake completely at 2 hours so I have been giving it an extra hour and it is just fine then.
I also used the juices for gravy and it was DELICIOUS 
This is definitely a keeper and a new tradition has been born!

This is a great recipe! a dded some cloves and prunes and prune juice to the sauce. my grandmother requested the prunes - it may be a Brazilian thing. I marinated overnight and did not cook in the bag. I cooked it slow and low and basted every 15 minutes. it was beautiful! My other grandmother said it was even better than a Honey Baked!

I didn't have orange juice to subbed apple juice instead and omitted the ginger ale because we also didn't have on hand, and used the pineapple juice from pineapple, otherwise used remaining ingredients as called for in recipe. I did place in 225 degree oven for 5-6 hours, drained juices into pan and added corn starch to thicken, arranged sliced ham into roasting pan and poured on glaze adding the pineapple slices and cherries at that time and placed in 325 oven for 35-45 min.  don't have a pic, wish we did it was picture perfect!!! moist and delicious, saving this recipe will for sure use again.

I made this but did change one thing. I've never been a fan of pineapple and cherries on a ham. First of all I omitted the cherries completely. After I had sliced the diamond pattern into the ham I placed it into the bag. Then poured the juice mixture over it and basted it slowly a few times. I used two  large cans of unsweetened crushed pineapple and spread that over the ham. Sealed the bag and put it in the oven. After it was finished baking I carefully opened the bag and basted it a little more. Then closed it back up and let it sit a bit on the stove top. The pineapple was so tasty with the juices mixed with it. I made sure that everyone got a good spoonful of the pineapple with their ham.  I've made this several times and it always disappears. Never have any leftovers.

I roasted a 9.5lb bone in ham at 325 for 2 1/2 hrs. It was DELICIOUS. I did let it marinate in the bag in the sauce overnight, after being dressed with the pineapple and cherries. I basted only once, but I think it would've been fine without! It was a big hit and I will definitely make again! Thanks!

I made this for Christmas dinner with high hopes. I followed the recipe as written but the ham was dry! How that happened when it was halfway submerged in liquid I don't know. I tested the ham with my meat thermometer and took it out as soon as it hit 160*, so I don't think it should have been overdone but it just wasn't good. I'll be using it for soup and ham salad but not eating as is.

My 13-yr-old son made this for our family Easter meal.  He followed the instructions exactly, and it turned out great!  Will definitely make again.  Be sure to have a large oven bag on hand!  I didn't read through the whole recipe and had to run out and get one.

Only changes we made were to cover the ham with foil (not using an oven bag), pineapple/orange juice, and using tart cherries instead of maraschino. Really delicious and juicy ham.

I made this recipe for Easter.  I did not have Marichino Cherries in the jar I had to use canned sweet dark cherries because I had send my husband out for them and that is what he came back with.  Lesson Learned.  I had some tough critics over for Easter, my in-laws and my parents.  They raved about my ham... loved it.  Thank you for such a great tasting ham recipe.

2-18-09. I wanted to make a ham before my daughter left for Japan w/ the Navy. I'm so glad I made this recipe. If you like a ham on the sweet side this is a great recipe to try. Everyone loved it. I've never used a bag before; easy clean up, and it helped get all the flavor through out the ham. I'm using this recipe for Easter also.Update. I did make this for Easter. It's wounderful!!

I made this last night for New Year's Eve when we were having about 20 people over.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was FABULOUS!!  There was nothing left and people were asking for the recipe.  Putting it in the oven bag really keeps it moist.  Really delicious.

This by far exceeded my expectations. Altho I realized the recommendation for the biggest bag possible for 10lbs+ hams was greatly benificial. the 11lb ham barely fit in. When it came out my family loved it. Thank you for this excellent recipie. It was fast and easy to prepare and very good when done. My family loved putting the extra away and using it for breakfest sandwiches the next day.

This was easy and delicious.  The only change I made was that I forgot to get the cherries and just added some of the pineapple juice instead.  I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it - even the picky kids!!

Wow!! This was my first attempt at baking a ham. My Hubby and son just love ham so I wanted to try it. What a recipe I got the highest of praises! Thanks Rita it was awesome. I marinated it over night, but ended up not using the bag because the tooth picks busted it. I Basted it every half hour and also used a flavor injector. It cooked for about 2 and a half hours. Yummy!

This was my very first ham and it turned out awesome.  This was so easy and I got rave reviews at my son's birthday party.  I didn't have pineapple rings, so I used chunks and it looked almost as pretty.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I first made this for Christmas and couldn't believe how moist the ham turned out. Everyone loved it. The only change that I made to the listed recipe recipe was adding the pineapple juice from the sliced pineapples to the glaze.

i made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge success!!
I put the pineapple on the ham before putting it in the bag.
I also poured the juice over the ham instead of it just laying
on the bottom of the bag. It came out juicy and tender! I will
be making this every year!! I just remembered to write a review.
great and easy recipe!!!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out really well.  I got lots of compliments on the cherry flavor being good as opposed to the traditional pineapple flavor.  I'll definately use this mixture again.

The first ham I ever made, and it was delicious!!  I made it for Thanksgiving and my family was fighting over who was taking the leftovers!  I did marinate the ham overnight and also sliced the ham and let it soak in the juices when it was done.  Other than that, I followed recipe and it turned out fabulous!

Ham tasted great, but the top got dried out.  Not sure why, as I used the bag and there was a lot of liquid in the bottom.  I think it might be better to bake covered in foil and baste the ham instead.  I had a lot of juice left over!

Wonderful!! I omitted the syrup and added whole cloves to the ham. The ham was tender and delicious. I used the left over juice to make gravy and everyone loved it.

Delicious!  I cooked this in my roaster oven and it turned out great!  Easy to make with little clean-up.  Everyone enjoyed this!  I will definitely make this again and again!

Man oh man. Was this ever yummy! We LOVED this recipe. We didn't have pineapple rounds, just tidbits, so we just put the chunks in the bag with the sauce, and the ham so the flavour still was there. It worked just fine. We will deffinetly be using this recipe again. Thanks for sharing it!

I used this recipe for a holiday dinner and it was a huge hit!  I'm not a very experienced cook so I liked that this was a simple, straight-forward recipe.  It was one of the best ham recipes I've ever had.  I highly recommend it!

Well, what can I say?  This was a lot of ingredients for not a lot of payback.  The ham sort of just sat in the juice (in the bag) and in the end, it tasted like....ham.  The bottom of the ham was dyed pink, but the ham did not taste at all like the sauce....and you couldn't baste it because it was inside the bag.  It was my first ham, and in the end, everyone liked it....but it did just taste like ham.  As an aside, cooking the ham inside the oven bag did keep it very moist and juicy.

I give it a *** instead of * because I did improvise the first go round, so that may be why we didn't eat any... but I truly didn't change that much:  Actually, didn't change the glaze at all, and that's what we didn't like.

After reading the reviews before making this, I was cautious as to having there be too much liquid. So, I didn't use the full amount of ingredients that the recipe called for. I was told that this was the best holiday ham the family had ever tasted.

Don't know how relevant this review is b/c i changed things.  i did not use a cooking bag.  Then i cheated somemore and after the first bit of cooking, turned the oven down to 200 for about 2 hours, then shut it off without opening for the rest of overnight.  This was a 31 lb. ham! i liked the moistness, the lack of the salty taste i associate with ham, and the tenderness from the pineapple enzymes. Thanks, Lysa.

This ham turned out OUTSTANDING! I used a 16 lb ham, didn't change anything else, and I also used my digital meat thermometer; therefore I am not sure if the cooking times were accurate - I just let it go until it beeped.  It was delicious, our whole family loved it.  Even the leftovers were yummy! Our kids want it to be our new Christmas Dinner tradition!

Thank you Rita for this wonderful recipe! My baked ham was a total hit. I made a ham once before and it came out dry. But with your recipe, the ham was tender and sooo moist. My family loved it so much that I'll be making another one this week just because everyone wants more!

I just used the sauce portion of the recipe, and it does make a lot.  Very good, but not the best baked ham I've had.  Needs more spice or something.  Ham was very moist.

I tried this on a small, boneless ham from Omaha steaks.  (I don't think their hams are as good as their steaks.)  I marinated it overnight in the bag with the glaze; by morning there was lots of extra liquid in the bag and it looked watery.  I baked it in the bag, and loved the no-mess preparation.  I was not excited about the taste of the ham, and found it hadn't picked up much flavor from the glaze. (It is impossible to baste it while it's in the oven bag.) Whether this was due to the extra liquid in the bag or just that the ham itself wasn't that wonderful, I don't know.  I would have to say the recipe wasn't at fault, probably something I did.

I made this ham for Easter dinner and it turned out wonderful. I halved all the ingredients for a 5 lb. ham and loved using the cooking bag. Made cleanup real easy and the ham was very moist and flavorful. I let in sit in the bag for about 10 minutes before carving. The ham was not overly sweet despite all the sweet ingredients that are added to the bag. I will make this again.

It's easy and excellent tasting.  Leftovers are even moist.
