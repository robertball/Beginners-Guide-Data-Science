I'm not much for measuring things out, but I made this last night by eyeballing everything when I needed something quick and easy and it turned out great!  My modifications: 1) I whisked all the ingredients, plus salt, pepper, and basil, together in the glass pot that I was going to bake the chicken in, thus I had one less dish to clean.  2) I used an entire lemon, because I love on obscene amount of lemon.  3) I used less honey.  4) Instead of basting, which is too much work for a quick and dirty dinner night, I just stabbed the budgeezus out of the chicken with a fork and covered the pot to keep the juices in.  This way it only took 30 minutes to cook.  It turned out lovely and lemony and it required very little work!  A+

I marinated the chicken breasts with the mixture rather than using it to pour over, using a little more olive oil than called for, because I grilled them over charcoal rather than baking them.  This locked in the moisture as well as the taste of the marinade.  Sometimes  skinless breasts can be relatively tasteless or overpowered by the marinade, but this ended up being a nice balance of the flavor of the moist and tender chicken and the flavors of the marinade (although Mrs. Spunky Buddy thought it was too lemony-tangy).

I love this recipe.  The flavor is great and it's SOOO easy!  I modify it slightly, I use chicken tenders (they cook up quicker) and I cook it stove top rather than baking it.  I also double the sauce, and serve it with rice which I also spoon the extra sauce over!  Thanks for a great chicken recipe!

Sorry, but we didn't care for this. It was easy, and I liked all the ingredients that went into it, but once cooked, it didn't have much flavor.  Also, 45 mins is way too long for chicken breasts. Thirty minutes is usually perfect.  The chicken would be much better if it was marinated in the sauce for several hours and then grilled instead of baked in the oven. The baked chicken didn't have much color to it and therefore didn't look that appetizing. Another change I would highly recommend is doubling the liquid. It could also benefit from salt and pepper.

Oh my goodness!!  This was delicious.  I didn't bake it. I used the ingredients as a marinade and marinated the chicken pieces for about 8 hours.  I also added a small amount of black pepper and a dash of salt. I heated a skillet and browned the chicken on both sides adding a little marinade as it would become dryer. I did not need to add additional oil or butter to the pan.  They honey gave it a nice caramelized glaze.  My husband loved it.  I am making this again tomorrow night!

Made this as written and it was definitely tasty, but the honey didn't add much sweetness and I found the sauce to be rather sour (even though I love sour, lemony things).  The honey will burn if you don't have the chicken packed tight in the baking dish, so I don't recommend making a single serving like I did.  A bit of salt and pepper, garlic powder, and a touch more honey could turn this into a fabulous dish.  Will make again!

I like lemon chicken and this was OK.  I have other recipes that I like better.  For me I think it was the honey - it was just too sweet for me.

Simple, yet elegant in flavoring.  Used rosemary infused olive oil, otherwise followed recipe to a T.  A keeper.

Me and my wife both liked it. However, I did modify the recipe through rubbing a little bit of sea-salt on both sides of chicken breasts.

This had a very good flavor! My chicken turned out pretty dry. I will watch it closely the next time a cook it.

Bland.  I'll use the leftovers in something else; but, as is, it's not oregano-y or lemon-y.  I had my hopes up, but this didn't do it for us.

I am by no means a professional cook, and this was really easy and good. I'll definitely make this again.

I'm vegan so I didn't taste it, but my husband and 2 young daughters loved it.  My picky eater asked for seconds.  I made the recipe exactly like it was written.  Thumbs up all around.  Whenever everyone in the family is happy, it's gotta be good.
