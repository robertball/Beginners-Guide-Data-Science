Whew! This is a sweet moist cake! I would try next time making half of the sugar mixture you poke into the cake. It has great flavors with the brown sugar and cinnamon in the cake. It even looks like a yummy honey bun. Small slices! Enjoy!

I expected it to be better. it was alright, but it wasn't great or anything. just average, if not less. it was really mushy and it was too sweet. maybe a good dessert for young children, but it's overall too milky.

Deliciously decadent!  Great to bring to brunch gatherings.  Never had a complaint just request for the recipe. For the icing, I used almond milk in lieu of milk and added a bit of vanilla paste.

Where did I go wrong??? Made according to directions and I think it could be good if you left off the glaze.  It saturated the cake and turned most of it to mush. Really disappointed.

Sorry but just tasted like a sugar bomb.  Made it as written but definitely won't make it again.  Gummy and waaay too sweet...and I'm a sweet freak.

Pretty good, I only used 2 cups of sugar in the glaze, it was more than enough. Most important, easy to make.
