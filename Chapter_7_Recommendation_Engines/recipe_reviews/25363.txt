My family loves this recipe.  I did take the advise of other cooks who recommended increasing the milk to 1/4 cup and adding a teaspoon of some sort of seasoning (I've used Bruci's on one occasion and Italian Seasoning on another) to give the gravy some oomph.  I haven't had a problem with the chicken getting dry, but I make sure that the meat stays covered by the gravy by giving it a stir every once in a while throughout the day.  It's possible that by putting the chicken into the pot while the meat was still frozen had something to do with the retention of moisture, too.  The recipe can be made in half the time by increasing the temperature to "high" and cooking for 3-4 hours.

Loved  this recipe and made a few changes to make it my own.  I used White Zinfandel instead of just white wine & Used Two Cans of Progresso Cream of mushroom soup.  The next thing I noticed is that it had a ton of sauce so I added 1 cup of Brown Rice and 1/2 cup of Shelled Edamame.  After tasting it I felt it still needed a little something so I added 1/4 cup of Shredded Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago cheese blend.  YUMMY!!!   This is gonna be a winner for us! THANKS!

My whole family loved this.  I doubled the sauce recipe and it cooked til the chicken was so tender that I just shredded it and mixed it real good.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  I also browned and seasoned the breasts first in garlic oil.  I will definitely  make this again.  Tracy Sue

I changed this a bit, doing something some slow cooker people might not like: adding an extra pan.  I browned my chicken first (5 pieces) in a big SS skillet.  Season with your favorite spice blend (I used a mix of Lawry's & Mrs. Dash).  Brown on med/med high heat, and then transfer to SC.  I then added about 2TBS butter, and a cup of chopped fresh onion (omit dried).  Drop heat a bit and sautee that about a min or two and add a carton of fresh chopped mushrooms (omit canned) and sautee some more.  Increase wine to about 1/2 cup and add to deglaze pan.  Get wine roiling pretty good, scrape bottom, and add spices (parsley, salt, garlic, pepper, etc).  I then added 2 cans of 'cream of' soup (I had mushroom and chicken in the pantry).  Stir that and let simmer for a few min.  Drop heat to low, increase milk to 1/3 cup, and add to mix.  Stir to incorporate, and then pour over chicken in slow cooker, moving things around to get good coverage.  Cook on low or high as directed, though I think 4-5 hours on low should be enough since you've already browned the chicken... caveat emptor: be aware of how your slow cooker works.  I liked this served over rice with a side of English peas.  Some things I might try next time are adding a few TBS of capers, and/or switching to pearl onions added with mushrooms after deglazing pan.  If you don't mind the extra pan and just a little extra prep time, I think this really works.

this is a great basic recipe! very yummy, but i made lots of modifications because we had a snowstorm & i couldnt get to the grocery. i used value pack chick thighs, about 9, bone in, skin removed. 1 can each cream of chick, cream of mush. 1 pk fresh mushrooms, half cup white zin, & one quarter cup chick broth. thats it. i didnt brown the chicken but i seasoned it with lots of pepper, seasoned salt, onion powder & paprika. i wouldve added diced onion if i had any. served over egg noodles, it was creamy & super yummy! will def make again. (I wrote this review a while back, but i have made this dish over and over since then. take time 2 brown the chicken, its worth the effort. fresh diced onion is key. but the best tip i discovered is 2 add half a pack of powdered ranch dressing mix into the liquid ingredients.) screw u culinary hags & grads. Shut up & eat it!

We loved it.  It was so easy to make and to tweak.  We had company coming so to make a little more I added a can of cream of chicken to increase the sauce, subbed about 1/4 cup sliced green onions for the dried minced onion (because that's what I had), ommitted the milk (because we were out - and didn't want to open a can of evaporated for only 1 T.), and used 1.3 lbs. thawed chicken breast tenders, and 3 partially thawed chicken breasts.  We served it over Jasmati rice and it was delicious!!  It served 4 adults, 5 children (ages 2-6), and I had the leftovers for lunch today.  Mmm, so good.  I'll definitely be putting this in the recipe box.

This was very bland.  Needs more onion, garlic, etc.  Also, you may want to thicken the gravy as it was very runny. After reading some reviews, I made this a second time using dried onion soup mix and it was extremely salty.  So I made it a third time and added 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 T. worcestershire sauce, double the mushrooms, and before serving, I removed the chicken and stirred in 1 cup of sour cream to the sauce and served it over rice. Even with these adjustments, my husband and I agreed it still wasn't a keeper.  Three strikes and this recipe is OUT!!!

Read numerous reviews, and this dish turned-out as I'd anticipated--including 'watery' sauce (due to accumilated condensation from slowcooker lid?).  It's not 'exciting/awesome' in flavour, but is a very nice chicken recipe with the chicken actually tasting like chicken(!), and not ingredients used to make the sauce.  I  doubled recipe to 8 breasts which I cut into 1-2" wide strips due to limited amount of cooktime I had before dinnertime.  Added two sliced garlic cloves, a cup of chopped onions, and cooked on high for 3 hours.  Very tender meat, very watery sauce, very tasty chicken.  Next time I'll add sliced carrots for additional texture & color without altering the overall taste of dish by much; if at all.

This recipe is great!  I added fresh garlic and basil to mine, and deleted the onion.
The garlic really brings the flavor out in the other ingredients much better.  The
first time we had this over rice, then with the leftovers I chopped up the chicken and
served it over a spinach pasta.  It was really yummy both ways!  Thanks!!

This was a great recipe! I decided to change things up a bit...I used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 T milk, 1/4 c white wine, 1 tsp parsley and salt & pepper. Then I sauteed 1 vidalia onion, 3/4 c sliced mushrooms, 1 clove minced garlic in a little butter. Placed over chicken in crockpot for about 3 hours on high. I took the lid off of crockpot about 1/2 hour before serving so the sauce could thicken a little. Served with rice and grean beans! Very easy and delicious! :o) Will definately make again!

This is delicious and is officially in my dinner rotation!!!! I cut 3 rather large chicken breasts in 1/2 & upped the seasoning a bit: 1 fresh diced onion instead of dried, 1 tbsp dried parsley, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1/4 c milk, 1 shallow tbsp Onion & Herb Mrs Dash, & 1/4 tsp each of salt & pepper, as well as soup, wine, and mushrooms as directed. I browned the chicken in a little olive oil & garlic powder first (was SO worth it!), cooked on low for 4.5 hours, & left uncovered for one hour of that time to thicken the sauce. Next time, I'm going to omit the extra salt & just going to let it sit covered the whole time b/c I'd prefer to have more sauce; it was delicious & thinning it out just a bit wouldn't hurt a thing! Chicken was so tender, reheats well, and is a hit with mashed potatoes on the side -- sauce makes great gravy for the potatoes!

I have been making this dish for years. Used to use cream of mushroom soup but now we use Campbells Golden Mushroom soup and a can of whit zin or white wine.  You can also do this on the stoptop instead of slow cook.  I also do this with pork chops and golden mushroom soup and a can of red wine,  I serve both with mashed potatoes or the chicken one is very good with rice pouring sauce over rice.  Yummy

I followed this recipe as it read except that I added minced garlic and the 1/4 cup of milk. It turned out great. I am having to make things in a slow cooker until my new oven arrives (heating element went out) and even my daughter who swears she hates crock pot food loved it.

We thought that it was pretty bland. In the end, we had to cover it with garlic salt. I'm not a salt adder but it was the only thing that helped it out and made it edible. Maybe you need Cambells Cream of Mushroom because my all natural organic cream of mushroom soup(usually very yummy) didn't do the trick. The sauce was very very runny. I tried to thicken it up. Not a good idea. It was too watery and not enough flavor to thicken with a good taste. I hope you all have better luck. I'll move on to the next recipe.

I was not very happy with the way this recipe turned out. I followed the directions exactly, and I thought it was very bland and the chicken breasts in the slow cooker is just not a favorite of mine. They have a much different consistancy when they start to shred. I think dark meat (legs and thighs) are the best in the slow cooker. Also, i cooked everything on low for 8 hours and it was overdone. Again, white meat is just not the best in the slow cooker. The darker meat stays more moist.

I don't know where I went wrong, I made as directed, and it was just really, really bad.  I gave it 2 stars because it was convenient to make, and not quite inedible, but I will not make again. Sorry :(

First time making this dish in the crockpot, I usually make it in the oven.  I sauteed mushrooms, garlic and onion in a tbspn of butter and added to mix.  It came out great, probably could have used @ teaspoon of salt, but was still delish.  I will make this again.

This was good for as easy as it was. I took other's advice and upped the milk a bit, but my sauce was quite thin, so I wish I hadn't done that. May try again for a quick weeknight meal. Thanks!

I made this with apple/grape juice (because I didnt have wine or plain apple juice) and it turned out fab! My chicken fell apart, and it was juicy. I used garlic powder, salt, pepper for season. Served with dill mashed potatos and corn. The mushroom sauce worked AWESOME as a gravy. Even my kids loved it!

We really liked this dish. I agree that it need's some additional seasonings. I added some dried rosemary and smoked paprika. Also made this using home made cream of mushroom soup (Dianne's recipe). We served this over whole wheat pasta.

This was pretty good. It was really easy. I left out the can of mushrooms and used chopped onion instead of dried. It was a little bland for our taste, I think using sour cream instead of milk would have made it taste a little better.

Tried this one. Took the advice of spicing it up with white wine & also made sure to mix in the rice with the soup so it wouldn't be hard. The taste was kinda bland like chicken & dumplings. My husband keeps joking about how I made him that "gourmet" chicken.

Just okay.  Pretty typical slow cooker chicken recipe - even with additions suggested, really bland.

This is a great base recipe, but needs more spices, I also used 1/4 cup of milk.  At the end I added rosemary to add more flavour, and I used fresh onions and garlic, I served it with a salad.  I think next time I will flour and brown the chicken first

This recipe came out wonderful. I like to have more broth or gravy than not enough, so I doubled all the ingredients (soup, milk, wine, spices).   I read alot of the other reviews, and based on those, I used good thick boneless breasts, cooked on low for 6 hrs, then took the lid off for an hour and the sauce thickened up nicely.  I also added 1/4 tsp of Thyme to the spices.  I didn't add much salt since the cream of mushroom soup is pretty salty already.  I served with a wild mushroom rice pilaf, and the chicken was fall-apart tender!!

This was really tastey! I did sautee fresh mushrooms ,minced garlic, and onion in a pan before adding to the crockpot. I doubled the soups and liquids because we love gravy. I used frozen chicken tenderloins and it was great. Served it over bow tie pasta along with crusty bread!

My Husband hates mushrooms, so I left them out, and then he loved it. As did my parents. I also used frozen chicken breasts and cooked it 8hrs. I think it could use some color though (since I left out the mushrooms). I will probably add some parsley or chives to it next time.

This came great but I changed a few things.  I used 3/4 cup white wine, fresh onions, fresh mushrooms, fresh garlic, 1/4 cup milk, and added some cayenne pepper and about a 1/2 cup of sour cream right at the end.  I left out the salt because the cream of mushroom soup has so much salt in it.  It came out delicious!

I liked this a lot. It was really easy. I did change a couple things. I used crushed garlic, pino, chopped green onions and instead of parsly I used two bay leaves. Lots of flavor.

I made this recipe kind of…I used the same ingredients plus some. I used Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken Soup (1 can each), doubled the Wine and Garlic, added ½ cup Chicken Stock (we like sauce a lot and it was the perfect amount for 4 chicken breasts!), ½ tablespoon Dried Thyme and a dash of Paprika. At the end of the cooking I added a dash of Heavy Cream to give it a little more richness. It was awesome!!!

Not great, not horrible.  We had it the first night and had enough for leftovers, but it just did not appeal to us.  Maybe a bit bland for our taste.  Easy to make, though...

I was a little worried about this recipe. I read that people either loved or hated it. I really didn't want another failure on my hands...so I made a few changes. I also added a dash of nutmeg and more salt and pepper. I added frozen chicken to retain the moisture and let the soup mixture soak into it for 3 hours in the fridge before starting it. Lastly, once the chicken was cooked, I removed it, and stirred in 4 teaspoons of flour. Whisked to a gravy and served over rice. Husband loved it!

My husband and I loved this!  I added a few things from other reviews I had read.  I used a little garlic, 1/2 cup of wine, 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup with the Cream of Mushroom, added a little thyme and paprika and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also used a whole onion instead of dried onions for flavour.  Served with egg noodles and it was delicious!

This recipe was really good with some modifications! I didnt uses mushroom soup because all I had was Cream of Chicken. I doubled this recipe and added two diced shallots, one tablespoon of minced garlic and I used someone else's suggestion of using a half packet of ranch seasoning. I used onion powder because I had no minced. I also used a 1/4 cup of milk and used two large chicken breasts. I also used a package of sliced mushrooms instead of the canned. Very yummy and great on mashed potatoes! Will def. make again!!

It was OK but nothing special or interesting. Will not make this again. The color was so bland as was the taste. Soupy taste despite the addition of other things to make it better tasting.

My 7 and 9 yr old kids loved this. I took others' advice and used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of chicken; doubled the wine and added a teaspoon of Creole Seasoning from this site; it adds flavor without salt or pepper. Cooked recipe in crockpot for 3-1/2 hours on high and served over brown rice with peas and corn. The few leftovers will be eaten for lunch tomorrow. Great for family of 4 with lunch for me and the kids, and also for hubby, next day. Thanks! Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is definitely a keeper, especially since my 3 year old and 6 year old loved it and cleaned their plates!!  I also changed it a tad.  I used 1/2 cup of white wine instead of 1/4 cup that it called for, and used Lipton Recipe Secrets Savory Herb with Garlic ( instead of the garlic powder, parsley, onion), half a packet, mixed with 1 can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery.  I added 2 small cans of mushrooms, since we like shrooms, and used chicken tenderloins about 7 or 8, and let it cook on high for about an hour and a half and then on low for about 2 hours, added frozen peas the last half an hour and, wala, it was great.  I made mashed potatoes as a side and I did thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch at the end.  It was very good.  It was not salty at all either.  Would highly recommend, especially for kids that are picky eaters.

Great Recipe!!!  Easy to put together, and it tasted great.  My two girls loved it.

Need to find a way to make the sauce a hair creamier to put over rice.  But, otherwise, it was spectacular!!!

My chicken was dry and sauce was watery. I thought it was a bit bland, too. I'll look for suggestions to do it up a bit.

Not so good. This came out too runny and bland for my family. I added the extra milk as others have suggested and it made it entirely too runny - maybe it's just me though since it seems like others have had better luck. Also...even with added seasoning ( other than what is called for ) it still came out too bland. I won't be including this in our rotation. Now off to find other slow cooker recipes....

Excellent! Made this last night for a family get together meal.  To cook the chicken faster, I cut it up into strips.  I didn't have any dried onions, so I cut up a medium onion and used that.  As well as fresh mushrooms and fresh garlic.

Thank you :)

I liked this dish, but it was very modified from the original, it might qualify as a new recipe. I cut out the mushroom because both my husband and I hate them, I used two cans of soup, added a TBS of Worshire sauce, 1/2 cup of white wine, 4 red potatoes, one packet of onion soup mix, and 1TBS of Red Pepper sauce. This was tastey!

This sounds wonderful...but it doesn't say how much chicken! And if I add frozen chicken and need to add 60-90 mins. because it's frozen, how much frozen chicken? Help! I'm guessing 4 breasts to serve 4 persons, but it would help to be explicit in the recipe. Thanks.

really easy. My wife and daughter who are picky eaters enjoyed this meal. Added some sherry to give it more taste, and added fresh mushrooms at last hour to retain consistancy.

This was a good recipe.  I liked it using cream of chicken which seems to have more flavor.  I'm not a fan of slow cooker chicken yet.  Texture seems to be dryer but maybe I haven't yet perfected the right technique.

This is one of my family's favorites that I have been making for a while since I found this recipe online.  Finally decided to share my favorable review.  I do add fresh minced garlic and extra mushrooms...but that is just a personal preference.

I should have listened to the other reviews. It was tasteless.  I added real onion, sweet chopped red peppers and more pepper to give it a kick...it was still bland  Even cooked on slow in all that soup and wine...chicken was actually dry!!???

My whole family didn't like this recipe.  I made as stated, but used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I have to agree with the other users who said this was watery(not creamy) and bland.  The sauce was unappealing to look at, it looked like it was curdled with cooked chicken juices, it didn't taste too bad, but it is nothing to rave about or make again. Sorry!

My family loves this recipe. When my sisters house burned down and her kids wanted a chicken dinner at their motel I made a couple of changes to make it an easier meal for them. In the bottom of the crock pot I put 1cp of brown rice and added 2cups of beef broth to the mixture. This truly made it a one dish dinner and is how I will make it from now on. Her kids were ecstatic with their chicken dinner.

This recipe rocks. I doubled the sauce because I wanted more gravy. I used the seasonings to taste though because of the reviews I read about it being bland. I adjusted salt, garlic, onion powder, parsely and such until it suited my taste. I also added a chicken boullion cube. I didn't use any wine though. I used grape vinegar (again, to taste) and it came out beautifully. I served over rice for my husband and myself and over mashed potatoes for my daughters. Nice recipe.

i thought this was great but i changed it up a bit - i used onion soup mix, cream mush soup, cooking sherry, chopped onion, celery, fat free half n half, couple cans of mushrooms and chicken.  put a little nutmeg and lots of black pepper.  also added parmesan cheese at the end of the cooking.  it was a big hit in our family!

One of the best chicken slow cooker recipes ever! Followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will not use salt as the soup provided enough salt.

This recipe turned out well.
 I sauteed the chicken somewhat first along with fresh garlic and shallots.I doubled the parsley and wine, also adding 1/2 can of Cream of Chicken soup and a pinch of Herbs de Provence. Towards the end, I added a package of fresh Crimini mushrooms. Served over rice, with peas and carrots on the side. I might make it again... it was a very convenient meal.
Thank you, K.

Yummy!! And so easy! I wanted a little extra sauce so I used a can of cream and mushroom and half a can of cream of chicken along with the wine. I used a garlic and herb seasoning along with fresh garlic and minced onion.  I served it over egg noodles and there was nothing left!  I'll make more next time!

Excellent recipe! I followed it exactly and cooked it on low for 5 1/2 hrs. It was just right. I have had trouble in the past using chicken breast in the slow cooker because it would become tough and dry but this was delicious. I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was terrific. I served it over rice. The sauce was really good with the touch of wine, and the chicken was falling-apart tender.  My husband gobbled it up and already asked me to make it again.

I have tried this recipe a number of times and can't get it to work out.  I love mushrooms and I thought this sounded good.  No matter how I adjust the cooking time, the chicken always turns out dry.  I've tried it in the crockpot and in the oven with no success.  Unfortunately I have to remove it from my cookbook.

Sorry...didn't like the recipe.  I found it had no taste.  I read the other reviews and even followed some of the suggestions made...like adding fresh garlic and basil and it still was pretty bland.

Excellent flavors, and easy to make!
I only had a whole chicken in the house- so I mixed everything together then put the whole chicken in the crock pot, and scooped some of the sauce on top. It still worked great- and the chicken fell right off the bone. I used vermouth and cream of chicken soup (also because that was all that was in the house) and cooked it about 7 hours on low. Made a wonderful gravy out of the sauce, that is so good poured on rice (even without the chicken!)  Thanks for a great recipe that I can make to eat throughout the week.

This gets 5 stars because I followed some of the other posts and did some simple upgrades:) I added a can of cream of chicken soup and used the 1/4 cup of milk like others suggested. Instead of a teaspoons of garlic, parsley, and minced onion I accidentally did tablespoons (which I would recommend and will continue to do myself). I also recommend adding some fresh mushrooms, carrots, celery, and chopped onion. I browned the chicken with olive oil and seasoned it with pepper and Lawry's. When I added the chicken I also added the broth it created. About a half hour before serving I added a cup of brown rice. All-in-all liked this dish a lot and will be making it again.

We've tried this recipe twice now. The 1st time using whole breasts over white rice. Last night, we were in a hurry, so chopped the chicken into chunks and served over linguine.

Both times, I browned the chicken in garlic oil 1st, for better flavor. Then, I sauteed some mushrooms & onion and used the wine to deglaze the skillet. To make it more filling and appetizing, also added chopped carrots and celery. We Did up the milk to about 1/4 cp and added a pinch of Italian Seasoning.

One of the reviewers suggested mixing in a dollop of sour cream right before serving. We tried this the 2nd time around and it tastes good either way.

Good basic recipe, but it really needs to be jazzed up a bit. I used fresh mushrooms and "real" onion in mine. Next time I will try more spices. Came out kind of bland, but I am not giving up on it, the chicken was so tender!

Pretty good for how easy the recipe is.  I used sauted fresh mushrooms, onion, and garlic.  At the very end I took the chicken out and stirred in about 1/4 cup of sour cream to thicken it up.  I then turned to high for a few minutes and cooked with the lid off.  It seemed to work to thicken and gave a good flavor.  I put the chicken breasts in frozen and it was perfectly done in about 6 hours.

This recipe was a little bland but it was ok. I added an extra can of cream of chicken soup to the mixture to make sure the chicken was covered the entire time. I also added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning to add a little extra spice. The chicken was very tender but I will add more spices next time to give it more flavor.

I liked this recipe very much, but it was a bit bland so I made a few changes.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms with some garlic in a little butter, and instead of the dried onion I used fresh shallot.  I added some basil and cracked pepper.  Great served with rice or couscous.

My family loves this recipe.  We love using the sauce over rice.  The only adjustment is that we don't use the wine and I may use slightly more onion and spices than called for.

This was absolutely wonderful. I added dried mixed mushrooms which were a very nice addition. My sister, who is a chef, always recommends dark meat for slow cooker recipes so will be trying dark meat chicken parts tomorrow.

This recipe was...eh. The smell was fantastic while cooking, but the end result was lacking. Good points: The chicken itself was tender, the smell was good and its easy cleanup. Bad points: Taste was bland and slightly bitter, presentation is not very attractive, texture of the sauce is off. It's not thick, but it's almost..slimy. I followed the recipe exactly. This recipe could probably be made better with some tweaking, if you're up for it.

Using lemon juice instead of salt gives it extra flavor.

I was pretty disappointed with this dish. I made it as written, except for doubling the mushrooms. The sauce has very little flavor and the chicken was dry. I'm definitely going to try this again, though, with modifications!

I don't know why there are any complaints on how bad this recipe is. It was very good. And it's perfect for 2 people. I left it in the slow cooker for 9 hours on low as that is just how long I am at work. I added 1/2 cup white wine, a sprinkle of Kosher salt and cut up a clove of fresh garlic, everything else exactly as it was called for, served over Jasmine rice and the chicken was sooooo tender and there was just enough sauce for the 2 of us.

I was out of cream of mushroom so substituted cream of chicken.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as written and it was given thumbs up by all.  My teenage daughter even went back for seconds.  I served it with rice.  I will definitely make this again.

I was a little scared after reading some of the reviews, but everything turned out great!  I really liked the consistency of the sauce - not quite a gravy, but not exactly a broth.  I did use a little more wine than I should have since I had some left over and wanted to get rid of it.  This left too "winey" of a taste so I knocked some of it out with some chicken bouillon.  I also used real onion along with the minced and real garlic.  It was great over some bowtie pasta!

This was a good starting point but I did take a PP suggestion and eliminated the seasonings and opted to use Lipton Onion Soup Mix instead and I added 2 large garlic cloves minced into the soup mixture.  I also sliced up fresh mushrooms and added those to the bottom of the crockpot with a splash more of wine and some dots of butter.  

Oh and I didn't have Cream of Mushroom soup on hand but I did have a Chicken Dijon on hand so we used that.

The chicken was so tender and the sauce was nummers!!  This is a keeper!

This was a really great base recipe to play with! I made some changes, only due to what I had on hand, but we liked it so much, that I think we'll continue to have it that way...First, you definitely need to double the ingredients for the sauce. I used one can Cream of Chicken, one can Cream of Broccoli (that's all I had), doubled the other ingredients (minus mushrooms), added 1/2 packet dry onion soup mix (as others suggested) and also added a bag of mixed frozen veggies for the last hour of cooking. The chicken was melt in your mouth (perfect for my one year old) and when served with baked potato and salad, was a filling meal! Other reviewers also suggested serving over pasta, and we may try that next. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, but there are so many recipes here that call for "cream of..." soups and I'm never blown away by any of them.  However, this is the best one we've tried, thanks to the wine.  I used a large full breast (2 split pieces) and cooked on low for 5 hours instead of 8, just to get a less limp chicken.  This will be made again.  Thanks!

I love this recipe.  It's now a family favorite.  So easy too.  The only thing I do differently is that I throw in half a package of dried onion soup mix in place of the onion.  It adds a little extra flavor.  Sauce is good over noodles.

This recipe is a keeper.  Literally took 5 minutes to throw in the ingrediants.  My 2 yr old and 11 month old loved it, as did I.  I accidently dumped in all the mushroom juice instead of draining, so I just ommitted the milk and it was wonderful.  Thank you for a quick and easy recipe.

Great recipe!  I used partially frozen chicken breasts in mine and they were extremely tender and juicy.  I added minced garlic to mine and it had great flavor.  The sauce was incredible over rice.  I had a good bit of sauce left over so I froze it for use over rice for another dinner.  Thanks so much for a quick, delicious meal!!!

The sauce came out great - I loved it on the rice, but the chicken was really dry.  I threw in frozen chicken breasts and cooked them on low for 6 hours, I guess that was too long.  I was disappointed that the flavors didn't seep into the chicken though.  You definitely have to eat the chicken with lots of sauce on it.  THen it's pretty good.

Excellent dish! One of the best slow cooker chicken recipes I've tried (and I have several favorites). I added 1 TBS of dried onion soup mix for additional flavor, and used 1/4 Cup of milk for more gravy. The gravy was sensational - I served over mashed parmesan garlic red potatoes and served with green beens and bacon bits. What a wonderful dinner. So easy, few ingredients and a great flavor. Chicken was tender, too. Definately a "keeper"! Thanks, K!

Husband and I loved it. I used one can of cream of mushroom soup, added I small tin of mushrooms, used a half of red pepper, one onion diced instead of dry. I used one gravy stock  and parsley and thyme stock to give it some flavor . I used chicken filleted thighs and  browned the thighs in olive oil., chopped about 6 cloves of garlic. It came out delicious at the end I added some garden peas and shredded the chicken  and put over mash potatoes. Well definitely make again.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and one of his friends. I modified it a little bit based on the reviews: browned the chicken in a pan with olive oil, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. I had to omit the parsley because I didn't have any :( And then added french onion soup mix, extra fresh mushrooms, and swapped the dried onions for 2 fresh scallions. I also used cream of chicken soup instead of the "herb" one. They LOVED it. I was a little nervous because I just started using my crock pot so I'm new to this whole thing...but it was pretty easy and turned out delicious! I served it on spinach pasta because I didn't have any brown rice as planned. Definitely will make this again...and might try new versions!

I thought it was okay.  I followed the recipe to a T but then I noticed the sauce was really watery so I added cornstarch and that was NOT a good idea I was left with a thick sauce so leave it as is if you think it's too watery. Overall good but it was still bland.  But the bf didn't notice it was canned mushroom I did of course so I would use fresh next time probably fresh everything.

I've made this recipe twice.  I use fresh mushrooms and serve over rice. I get what my husband calls "the pancake effect" when I eat this.  Its good for about half of my plate, then the rest kind of sickens me.  It is very rich/goopy and I can only eat it in small doses, no thanks on the leftovers.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I read others' reviews of how the chicken came out bland and watery, and lo and behold, my chicken came out bland and watery. I added a ton of seasoning, fresh basil and chopped garlic, fresh mushrooms, chicken broth, and sliced onions and I wasn't thrilled with the results. I also used chicken thighs instead of breasts. I don't know, maybe I need to modify this recipe even more (2 cans of cream of mushroom next time?)

This was a pretty good meal for a fast, slow cooker recipe to make in a pinch, but it definitely needs some changes.  I added 1/2 cup of light sour cream and used the reduced fat/reduced sodium version for the cream of mushroom soup.  Even with that, I thought that the sauce was still too salty.  Sauce was pretty watery as others have mentioned.  Served it over wild rice with a small amount of sauce and it soaked up the sauce nicely, though.  I used fresh chicken and cooked it on high for a little under 4 hours.  I was surprised and disappointed by how dry the chicken was.  With some changes, this could be a good one to have around for a fast meal.

Not bad, but for me it needs a lot more flavor. I even added a pretty good wine to bring it up, but it was still fairly insipid. It needs more garlic, and probably cream of some sort. Maybe a little mustard. I'll try it again, and try to tweak it.

This is an AWESOME recipe. I followed just as is, and it turned out great! I made this dish for my parents, husband and kids, ages 7 and 3. Even the kids gobbled it up! Got lots of compliments and YUMMY noises too! What's even better is that it cooked while I was at work!  Great recipe!!!

Not too bad, but I have to agree with some of the other reviews.  This recipe was a little bland and runny.  I cook in the slow cooker all the time and my chicken is never dry, but it was with this recipe.  Oh well, not a keeper for me.

It smelled really good in the slow cooker but it just wasn't tasty and didn't do it for my family. Leftovers went untouched.

I wasn't quite sure about this recipe after I got it going in the crockpot.  The smell of garlic was overwhelming even for us- and my husband and I both love garlic.  However, it did turn out very good, especially for something that you just dump into the crockpot to cook!  I will definetely be making this again.

I used 5 boneless breasts so I wanted to increase the amount of sauce.  I doubled the sauce using 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic.  I used dry sherry since we didn't have any white wine.  I kept all other sauce ingredients the same except omitted the milk and added about 1/4 cup light sour cream.  Just before serving I sprinkled some shredded parmesan over the top and took the inner pot out of my crock pot and placed it under the broiler for a few minutes.  The result was pretty good although don't think I'll make often.  I served with white rice and roasted carrots.

Was great!! Added a cup of sour cream and reminds me of chicken stroganoff. I cooked it for 8 hours which made the chicken very dry and it came apart very easy so next time I will cook it 2 hours less.

Eh, it was ok, not amazing and not bad.  A little bland overall, but it could easily be jazzed up with some spices and/or maybe sherry.

I enjoyed this more than my husband. My measurements may have been off as I tend to guestimate everything. I found this very tender but a little bland. I will look for another similar recipe in the future

Easy!, I love easy! We served it over egg noodles. Disappointed that the flavor of the wine was non-existant, I would recommend adding a little more. While it was good, I have another recipe that is very similar that we prefer.

I was a little afraid of this recipe after reading the reviews.  I did double the garlic and added a bit more wine than the recipe called for.  I tried to thicken the sauce and was a little successful, but not as much as I would like.  The only thing I didn't like that although the chicken was very tender, it was a little dried out.  I can never understand how something cooked it liquid can dry out...but it did a little. I do think I will use again...thanks for the post.

This was delicious and easy!  I used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup.  I omitted milk, but added a bit more white wine.  I used a hard to find white wine: Due Uve (1/2 Sauv Blanc & 1/2 Pinot Grigio).  I cooked it for 6 hrs then warm for 1 hr.  Husband really liked it.  It was also great next day as leftovers.

I've made this twice and will again. The first time I prepared it exactly as submitted. The second time I was out of white wine and cream of mushroom so I substituted red wine and cream of mushroom roasted garlic. Tasted just as great!

we really enjoyed this recipe.  I took other reviewers' advice and used fresh mushrooms and onion. added a teaspoon dried thyme and an extra can of condensed chicken soup, along with the mushroom soup.  I doubled the quantity of white wine. I added some chopped fresh garlic also (word of warning,dont add a lot of garlic, like I did (4 big cloves) as it overpowers the dish and we are garlic LOVERS).  Sauce consistency was perfect over rice. Will definately make this again.

5 stars for easy and soooo tasty!  I used the 8 serving recipe and used one can mushroom soup and one can cream of celery.  Also used fresh mushrooms and onion, and added frozen peas for color at the very last.  Excellent comfort food!

I made several changes to this recipe and it turned out delicious!  I substituted garlic salt for garlic powder, onion powder for minced onion (I didn't have any minced onion) and I used 6 chicken drumsticks instead of breasts.  I also chopped up a few potatoes and put some baby carrots in to make it a complete meal.  I added a little water to the mixture so that in the end it had a gravy consistency that is perfect with rice, noodles, or mashed potatoes.  Great flavor!

A very tasty dish! First, I sprinkled fresh-ground pepper on the breasts and browned them quickly in a skillet. I knew the sauce would be liquidy, so I omitted the milk. Then, about 20 minutes before serving, I removed the breasts and skimmed off the fat. I whisked 2T. flour with 4T. milk and whisked it into the crockpot juices to thicken a bit, cooking on High for about 15 minutes. Then the breasts went back in till serving time. I served the dish over egg noodles---yum!

My initial reaction when I tasted this dish was to give it only 3 stars, as I found it very bland.  However, I recalled another recipe with a mushroom sauce that our family loves and added 2 ingredients that made all the difference in the way this dish tastes to me.  I added 1/2 tsp. tarragon and 1 tsp. Dijon mustard at the end of cooking which I thought made it taste wonderful. Next time I make this dish I will add them with the other ingredients at the beginning.  Other than these additions, I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out very tender. I rounded the dish out with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I really liked this recipe. It made a terrific gravy that goes great with mashed potatoes. 
I made 3 changes which made this recipe more appealing to my family. 
#1 Fresh mushrooms are a must!
# Like other reviewers, I replaced the dry minced onion with sm. amount of dry onion soup mix.
#3 Added one can od cream chicken soup for more gravy.
 Thank you for an easy recipe on a busy day.

Have used this recipe numerous times and love how quick and easy it is to prepare-----then just let it slow cook all day.  I make rice in the rice cooker the last 30 minutes to an hour, so there is no last minute prep, except for a salad, or pre-prepared slaw (in the bag)!  An elegant meal that tastes like hours to prepare!!!!

This recipe was really easy to make. I however, didn't cook it as long as it says on low. I only had it cooking for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours on low.  It came out perfect, the chicken was very moist, but when I walked in the kitchen it didn't give off the great smell I thought it would.  but it is a keeper.

Super easy to put this dish together-a big plus. I jazzed up the spices a bit, but it still wasn't a hit with my guys.  Needed some peas to be added or another veggie for some color.  Next time I'll pass on this one.

I thought this recipe was great! The chicken was so tender and moist that we didn't need knives. I used fresh minced onion in place of dried, added a bit of crushed basil and browned the breasts in a little butter before putting it in the pot. This is a keeper

I could see the potential for this recipe being bland so I took steps to prevent that from the start.  I used about 4 garlic cloves minced.  I added a tablespoon of Italian herbs rather than parsley.  I used a whole envelope of onion soup mix and added a teaspoon of Tobasco.  The result was wonderful.

This recipe was so good! Of course I made some adjustments per other readers recommendations. I browned the chicken breasts first sprinkling Italian seasoning on each side. Then I diced a small yellow onion and sauteed it with fresh sliced mushrooms and minced garlic in olive oil, adding Worcestershire sauce at the end to caramelize the veggies. I chopped up celery and added all of the veggies and chicken to the slow cooker. Next I mixed together cracked black pepper, two cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of white wine in with the chicken and veggies. I cooked the meal on low for 4 hours and added capers and a small jar of artichoke hearts in halfway through. I served the dish over jasmine rice. Delicious!

I tried this recipe today and it came out great!  Instead of regular cream of mushroom soup, I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  I added about a teaspoon of galangal, and upped the milk to an eight of a cup.  I served it with wild rice, and we soaked up the gravy with the rice.  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was easy to make and very flavorful. I used minced fresh onion instead of dried and added some diced carrots, celery, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones. Since the soup had salt, I did not add any extra salt, but I took the advice of other reviewers and added a teaspoon if Mrs Dash. The chicken was tender and tasted great and there was plenty of sauce to ladle over rice.

Good. I did season the chicken with season salt, black pepper, and garlic powder first, dipped them in flour, and then gave it a quick sear (about 2 minutes) on each side before adding it to crockpot. Since I was cooking it in the crockpot on high for 3-4 hours I wanted to make sure the chicken was done and wanted to sear some of the flavors in the meat. I also added sauted fresh garlic cloves to my crockpot and a chicken bouillon cube.  To thicken my sauce I added some corn starch about 20 minutes before it was done cooking.  I served this with a dollup of sour cream. This was good.

I made this recipe today and it was incredible. I put 7 breasts frozen in my slow cooker and added a whole chopped onion, 4 garlic cloves chopped, a pound of fresh mushrooms, salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, a huge  can of cream of mushroom soup, all I had was dry vermouth so I put in a half a cup.  I let it cook for 3 1/2 hours and it was perfect. It actually was like a stroganoff. So creamy. I made some pasta with it. It was so Yummy. My husband devoured it. It's a keeper

Used fresh garlic and minced fresh onions plus button mushrooms.  Didn't add milk as I knew the button mushrooms and onions would emit fluid, thickened up with a bit of cornstarch.

This was ok - but nothing amazing. I'm not sure that I would make it again. For the record I did make several adjustments, but which would seem to improve it: 2 cans of soup, fresh mushrooms, more milk, fresh onion, more spices...

My mom made this dish for her and my stepdad. I'm vegetarian, so she put some of the mushrooms and sauce over some rice for me and it was awesome. They loved the chicken, too, so this recipe's a keeper.

I made slight variations to the recipe such as chopped onion and 1 glove minced garlic. I also did not add the mushrooms as I didn't have any in the pantry. The soup had a good amount of chopped mushroom so didn't miss. Cooked the frozen breasts on low for 5.5 hours and they were perfect. My family that the chicken was very good. Thanks.

A top ten chicken recipe...with a few revisions...
I used evaporated milk in place of regular. We're not big fans of mushrooms so I omitted that and used cream of celery soup. The biggest revision was the use of  half a package of Leek soup mix in place of any onions (husband doesn't like onions). It came out so flavorful! If anyone felt this was bland try it with the Leek soup mix!

With a few modifications this turned out to be one of those meals that taste even better on a cold and snowy night! I don't like to waste boneless breasts on a recipe such as this for two reasons. Number one, they're too expensive and number two, bone in chicken adds so much more flavor to the dish. I used whatever pieces I had and nicely browned them before placing in my slow cooker. I used fresh mushrooms and because I had a lot of chicken, used several cans of both a "healthy" cream of mushroom soup and a roasted garlic mushroom soup. I also threw in a package of dried onion soup mix. Didn't see any need for the milk. The chicken was falling off the bone tender and the sauce was amazing. Served this over egg noodles. Thanks so much "K"!

This was good, with some changes by me and I took some ideas from other reviewers. I used the combination of mushroom soup and chicken soup and added red cooking wine instead of white wine. We like the flavor of the red wine and mushroom soup. I added the dry onion soup mix and a can of mushrooms. I used four large chicken breasts and layered the soup on the bottom, then two breasts, soup over those and two more breasts and soup over the top. I
sprinkled some oregano on top. My only mistake was using the whole package of onion soup and it was a bit too salty, next time I will use half a package or perhaps just the dry onions alone. We loved the dish and I served noodles with it. Will make again.

I made this tonight, but with some altercations (and it was good!).  I didn't have all the herbs, but I had a packet of Lipton's golden onion dry soup mix.  Used 1 can of Cream of Chicken & Mushroom and a can of Cream and Celery (so you get a bit of everything).  I added a 1/2 cup of chardonnay.  No water or broth, the gravy came out thick, which is what I like (add broth to make it thinner).  I put it on a bed of StoveTop stuffing with a side salad.  YUM!

I made just a few slight changes to the original recipe as suggested in some of the reviews. I added fresh garlic and fresh mushrooms. I was actually not all that impressed with the outcome. I had expected a lot more based on the reviews. I chose to cook on low for five and a half hours, yet the chicken was quite dry and the sauce or gravy was just okay. I will probably make this again, but more for a family meal rather than having guests for dinner.

Easy and tasty.  Husband thought it was a 5.  I followed some of the comments already posted.  Cut up the chicken into cubes.  Doubled the gravy (using cream of chicken soup as the double).  We like spice, so added pepper and crushed chili pepper to the chicken.  Used marsala wine, 1/2 pkt. onion soup mix, fresh garlic, fresh mushrooms, and 1/2 pckt peas, as substitutes/additions. Skipped the milk and any additional salt.  I found it a tad tangy by itself....put it over angel hair pasta and topped it with parmesan cheese.  Will make again.

I did not plan ahead so I wound up making this in my pressure cooker. It was fairly tastey but missing something.  I think that was my fault so next time, I will make this in a slow cooker to give the flavors a chance to meld properly

HONESTLY SPEAKING THIS RECIPE SOUNDS DELICIOUS, I NOTICE SOME VIEWERS CLAIMED THERE CHICKEN WAS AT NO FLAVOR AND OR DRY TO MY OPINION, USE CHICKEN THIGHS AND REMOVE THE SKIN FROM THE CHICKEN DUE TO THE HIGH OIL CONTENT THE SKIN OF THE CHICKEN GIVES OUT, NEXT IF YOU WANT YOU CAN PIERCE WITH A FORK SOME AREA'S OF THE CHICKEN SO THE SAUCE CAN SEEP THRU THE CHICKEN, TO ADD SOME KICK TO THE CHICKEN IS TO RUB SOME OF THE GARLIC POWDER ON THE CHICKEN, AND SALT AND PEPPER, BE LITE ON THE SALT  DUE TO THE MUSHROOM SOUP GIVES OUT SALT FLAVOR ALREADY, OR TO BE SAFE USE LOW SODIUM CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP!! GOOD LUCK OUT THERE!!

Good & Easy recipe...As per other reviews, I used fresh onions and mushrooms, omitted the milk and added a handful of shredded cheese on top towards the end!  With the wine - gives it a flavor similar to Monterey Chicken!  Yummy!

Absolutely outstanding!  I used Marsala wine in place of the white wine, and a package of onion soup mix for the onion.  I also used a can of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup.  Served it over Light and Fluffy egg noodles.  The chicken was so tender you didn't even need a knife.  Maybe sprinkle some chives or parsley over the plated dish for some color.  Try this!!! You will not be disappointed.

Overall this was a good dish.  I used Masela wine and no milk.  I sub. breast with bone in thighs and legs.  To thicken I used 1 TBS. cornstarch with water 1 hr. before it was done. It ended up being to thick and I had to add ab. 1/4 C. more wine and cooked another hr.  Shreaded the chicken and b/c I was out of egg noodles, I served with med. shells. My b.f. gave it four stars and said it was like beef stroganff with chicken.

I really liked this.  Used can of mushrooms, chicken halves, soup, garlic powder, salt, pepper, MARSALA wine and fresh chopped onion and other necessary ingredients. I also added dried parsley and quartered red potatoes.  The starch really helped to thicken the sauce.  I might play with seasonings a bit next time. But overall really good.

I noticed reviewers either loved this recipe or did not care for it at all.  I did not love this recipe.  The ingredients sounded good; however, the flavor just missed as well as the consistancy, not very attractive.  Will not make again.

There is nothing WRONG with a recipe that tastes bland!  (Unless maaybe, that is really ALL you plan to eat). Be creative and plan your menu:  Something bland; something spicy; something sweet; something sour; etc.  Everything will balance out for a good taste treat.

Easy and delicious!  I put frozen chicken breasts right in the crockpot and covered them with the sauce.  I also substituted Marsala cooking wine for the white wine.

This is very good.  My husband absolutely loves this.  I only use 2 chicken breasts though.  I also by an 8 oz package of cut mushrooms and I sautee them in a little butter before throwing them in.  My husband loves mushrooms, so extra is good.  Last time I made it I accidentally put in tablespoon of onions and parsley and it was still very very good.  Have made this several times now and will make it every week!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms, also, and I shredded the chicken in the crock pot.  The bonus is that the next day, I added the leftovers and the cooked rice to some chicken broth, and I had a very filling and very good soup.

I was disappointed, this dish wasn't as good as I expected.  It is ok, but the chicken doesn't take on much flavor and you basically have to try to get as much of the sauce in your bite as possible.  It is an overall ok recipe and defiantly eatable, but don't make it for company, it's not that impressive.

This was delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 pkg of dry onion soup.  I omitted the milk and used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup since I used 6 chicken breasts.  I didn't have white wine so I used marsala.  I also added shredded carrots and sliced onions 1/2 hour before serving.  Since the sauce was runny, next time I will thicken it.  This is very tasty and very easy!

OH MY GOSH,,This was so good!  I loved it!  The only thing I did different was I used a larger can of mushrooms because they didn't come in 4.5 ounces where I shopped,,,I used 8 ounces.  I noticed I had plenty of sauce so I cooked up some rice and used it as a side dish.  Totally delicious.  Will absolutely make this again.

This turned out pretty salty. I used the dried onion soup mix that other reviews called for, so maybe that's why. The chicken was VERY tender, though. I'll make it again.

This was a great throw together when I had no idea what to make. I used cream of chick, garlic salt and italian seasoning (all I had)and didn't add any milk in the beginning..put a half soup can in at the end and it was awesome! The sauce was sssoo good over rice...I'm going to do it with pasta next time...maybe some kind of garlic and pepper pasta.

Oh my God, this was delicious and filling with the angel hair pasta. I've used stems and pieces of mushrooms instead of pieces which worked out okay for my only tweak. I used cooking white wine instead of the real deal which worked out fine too.  I would make this again!

I made this with chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I added extra garlic and used freshly minced onion.  I left out the wine and it was still yummy.  I will try it again increasing a few of the original ingredients and adding some corn and Italian cut green beans.  Can't wait!

Excellent base recipe! I call it a bass recipe because there’s so much you can do with it! Like others, I put my own spin on it. 2 cans cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of chicken, 3/4 cup white wine, upped the spices. I always brown my chicken first in onion and minced garlic. First time I made it I did mushrooms, carrots, onion. This time I doubled the veggies and used cauliflower and red pepper. I always add red pepper flakes for an extra kick. First time I served with fettuccini, this time quinoa. You can not go wrong with this recipe! Everyone inhaled it!

I made this today and it was pretty bland and the sauce runny. I read reviews on the modifications but decided to try as is. My husband eats just about anything and he said it needed more flavor.  It wasn't until I cut up my chicken, added more sauce, salt, pepper and mozzarella cheese did it taste decent. Won't make again without modifying.

Delicious meal, quick and easy to prepare, and inexpensive too.  I've made this several times now, and a couple of times added a bit of grated cheese for a change.  Also I use chicken thighs instead of breasts as I find they tend to stay a bit juicier in as a slow cooker.

It smelled heavenly! I live 3 flights of stairs below and I could smell how good it was going to be at the first flight of stairs! 

I added a full cup of RED wine, instead of the 1/4 cup white wine suggested in the recipe, doubled the milk and the herbs, and added fresh mushrooms in addition to the mushroom soup. I added 2 extra chicken breasts. I did use frozen chicken. I was worried that the frozen chicken would not be marinated in the center as 4 chicken breasts were frozen in one clump in the package, but it wasn't an issue. I simply separated it 1 hour prior to the timer going off.  I cooked it for 6 hours on high, instead of the 4 hours on high.

I paired it with a quinoa and barley mixture (cooked in a rice cooker with salt, olive oil, and vegetable broth) and broiled broccoli florets tossed in fresh minced garlic and olive oil with some salt. My friend doesn't like mushrooms and she didn't even notice the mushroom sauce and said it was very good and that she loved how the chicken just came apart and was so tender. I did pick out the added mushrooms for her.  :-)

I too tweaked the recipe.  I browned the chicken breasts in olive oil with salt, pepper and mixed spices.  I then browned half a fresh onion, chopped along with a pound of baby bella mushrooms.  I added half cup white wine, one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  Mixed all of these ingredients together in crock pot then added browned chicken breasts.  Cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours.  Smells wonderful cooking -- haven't tried it yet!

My family loved this. Caution there's enough salt without any of the salt in the recipe. I spiced the chicken with no-salt seasoning to add flavour, browned the chicken and used the drippings in place of milk.

This was easy and basic. I followed the recipe and thought it came out pretty good. I served it with some chicken and mushroom rice. My boyfriend thought it was the best thing I've ever made, but the flavors just weren't that exciting to me.

I increased the milk to 1/4 cup and added a clove of garlic and a bit of thyme, I shredded the chicken to reduce the sauce and  chicken was very moist but lacking flavor.  When I heated the leftovers I added pepper, italian seasoning and cloves, really made a difference on the flavor.

Boring,  Needs to be kicked up for sure!  Next time I'll be sure to make a few changes.  I made mine with the wine and it was very dissappointing.  Chicken was super tender, but would be better if dark meat was used, like chicken thighs.

This is the first recipe that I have been disappionted with from this website. I think I might have put too much wine in the recipe. The flavor was just okay. My husband thought it was alright, but I couldnt keep the leftovers because the smell was making me sick. I know most people enjoyed the recipe, but I really didn't.

Delicious.  The recipe calls for breast "halves", which was a bit confusing to us.  We doubled the recipe and used 4 breasts - the recipe as written didn't have nearly enough sauce...

Chicken was a little dry as others said .   I will try it again with boneless skinless chicken thighs.  The sauce was good with a little tweeking.  Marsala wine, fresh mushrooms, onions, garlic, and parsley.

I think I overcooked this.  We thought the chicken had a weird texture.  The sauce was ok, but probably just not for us.
This was incredibly easy to make!

My husband and I though this was just OK.To be fair I substituted chicken broth for wine since we don't use that but it works in all my other recipes. It was missing something though and maybe it would have been better with cheese. Plus it seems way to close to the Awsome SlowCooker Potroast on this sight and I like the sauce way better with beef than chicken.It was really easy though and I might make this again when I have no time.

This recipe had a wonderful flavor. My whole family loved it. I made the mistake of thinking this dish could serve as a whole meal. It definitely cannot. Next time, I think that I will make pasta to round out the entre.

Very good. I added a little bit of sherry and thyme and served it over whole wheat noodles. I will make this again and again.

Oh yeah.  This one is smokin'!  Great stuff.  As slow cooker recipes go, this has to be a five; It's easy and delicious.  I used thighs and even threw in some gizzards.  I prefer dark meat, but no doubt this would be excellent with chicken breasts too.  The sauce was absolutely fabulous.  On high, mine was done right at three hours.  By the way, I doubled the sauce so there would be plenty, because I used eight thighs and the gizzards.  Thanks for a winner!

Quick, easy, and delicious.  The chicken ends up unbelieveably tender.

I used breast tenderloins and fresh mushrooms. Overall it was tasty and I liked how tender the chicken was.  It was too salty so I will use less onion mix and salt next time.

Very good & so easy to make.  Cooked on low for most of the day & the chicken was so tender.  Also sprinkled with paprika.  Added a little sour cream during the last 1/2 hr. of cooking time.

I LOVE this recipe!  Being a busy newly-wed I have fallen in love with my crock pot, so this recipe is a favorite of mine.  I've made it a couple of times when I've had people over, and it's always a hit.  Even with a friend who doesn't like mushrooms!!  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Served with a baked potato and vegetables - yummy!

This was really simple to put together & when we came home a few hours later it smelled great!  Pretty tasty too!  I had to thicken the "sauce" and served it with mashed potatoes.

This was only the second slow-cooker thing I've ever made. I made it exactly as described (cooking on Low for 5.5 hours). The sauce wound up watery for me, but this was mainly because I used frozen chicken and the ice added a lot of liquid. I found the recipe to be fairly salty, so others may be advised to look for low- or no-salt ingredients for this. And, to be picky, the flavor didn't seep into the chicken too well. On the upside, the chicken was fork-tender, and the sauce was very tasty, especially when it thickened up as warmed-over leftovers. Overall, it was pretty tasty and easy-to-make dish. I might just make it again sometime.

This recipe is just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that it tasted a little bland.  It just felt like it needed a little extra something.  On the upside it is extremely easy to make, but I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I kept it low carb, but I think it needs either rice or noddles, otherwise it just tastes like soggy chicken.

I give this 4 stars. Because I give it 3 stars and my husband gives it 5 stars.  That averages out to be 4 stars.  I found it to be a bit reach.  Funny how some raters found it to be bland.  Maybe because I added a couple pinches of rosemary.  Used fresh onions and mushrooms as well.

My family loved this recipe.  Like the others, I doubled the wet ingredients and I also shredded the chicken and served it over egg noodles. Also, I added sherry instead of white wine (didn't have any)and it turned out great. Will make this again.  Yum!

Delicious! I doubled the sauce recipe for 4 chicken breasts served over rice, and the amount was perfect. As per other reviewers, I also used Marsala wine instead of white, and substituted 3/4 package of dry onion soup mix for the onion stated in the recipe. This was truly delicious, and looked beautiful served on a bed of rice. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This was very good.  I, like others, also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and I added about half a can of cream of chicken soup.  Toward the end of cooking, I removed the chicken and added a mixture of cornstarch and water to thicken the gravy.  I served it over buttered egg noodles and everyone in the family loved it.  I'll definitely make this again.

Awesome recipe - my husband loved it.  I made some of the changes that some reviewers noted.  Used Marsala wine, fresh mushrooms, minced garlic.  I doubled the soup - my hubby likes extra sauce.  It is a little runny but I guess it's a matter of preference.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

This was great! I used 5 chicken thighs in place of the breasts, left out the mushrooms, and used 1 tbsp of onion soup mix in place of the minced onion. I put in about 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/8 tsp of pepper but if you like it salty you should add more salt. After taking the chicken out of the sauce, I skimmed the fat and strained the remaining liquid, then brought it to a boil on the stovetop and whisked in a paste of 3tbsp flour and water. It was fantastic, especially served with mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe with chicken thighs instead of the breasts.  It turned out really moist and tender.  I also added half a package of onion soup mix, some thyme and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  The gravy was a little runny but that was probably from the water produced from the fresh mushrooms.  This recipe is a keeper.  Very easy to make.

Great recipe.. I baked this in the oven instead of slow cooking it.. Also used one packet of dry onion soup mix.... in place of the onion suggested. Baked on 350 at 45 minutes and it was terrific!! My boyfriend loved it. Definite keeper!!!

This was so easy!  A big hit with my husband who doesn't normally like chicken breasts because they are too dry.  I used frozen breasts and added a bit of water at the end to dilute the salty flavor of the soup.  Will definately add this to the list of favorite dinners.
