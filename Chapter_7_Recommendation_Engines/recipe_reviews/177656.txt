I used homemade marinara in this recipe and Stove Top Savory Herb stuffing. I chose to make one big loaf out of this recipe in my Perfect Meatloaf pan. My meat loaf was done in an hour-twenty minutes. I served this with extra marinara on the side. My family LOVED this meat loaf--my husband ate what everyone else did not. NO leftovers. He did suggest that I add a half pound of ground pork next time and then it would be the "perfect" meat loaf for meat loaf sandwiches. As is, no complaints here.

This was another of those recipes I turned to when I needed something to make with mostly pantry staples and a few odds and ends left in the fridge before I headed out of town on a trip. I knew when I read through it that it would be a great start but would need embellishing.  I added fresh minced garlic and fresh parsley, and used some pizza sauce for the meat mixture. I put a good sized "stick shaped" piece of mozzarella in the center to make it extra gooey and cheesey. For the sauce poured over the loaves I used a small, specialty jarred sauce with artichokes, mixed with some tomato sauce I had put up from my garden. Topped it all with some freshly grated Parmesan, baked it at 350 degrees, uncovered, 45 minutes, and served it over spaghetti tossed with garlic, olive oil and fresh chives.  Hubby and I really enjoyed this quick and easy dish--a cross between  spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna and meatloaf!

These are really good. I used the string mozzarella cheese sticks and just wrapped the meat around them and that worked out well. Served it with spaghetti and garlic bread sticks. My family gobbled it up.

This was a HIT!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't make them individual servings.  I made up two loaf pans instead.  We froze the leftovers in individual tubs (with the vegetables and pasta I made as well) and had our own healthy frozen meals for whenever we wanted them.  We're out now; so I'll have to make some more. :)

These have great flavor and were easy to prepare, I did use shredded cheese rather than a slice (all I had. Baked them on foil lined sheet but should have sprayed with pam they stuck a little, after baking put them in the rest of sauce and simmered 1/2 hr served with pasta and garlic bread everyone want's them again. thanks for a simple and tasty recipe.

This turned out to be a hit. It's a wonderful recipe for little ones who can be picky eaters, and you can modify the recipe to sneak some veggies in for them.  My husband also called this the best meatloaf he's ever had...and he's a tough customer.  I did make some important changes: I used a whole container of tomato sauce, rather than just 2/3 - to make it extra moist. I also used 1 extra egg.  For more flavor kick and nutrition, I added chopped brocolli, and a1/2 cup of chopped garlic, as well as minced garlic.  Also great served with some hot sauce for the grown ups.

Used ground turkey instead of ground beef and 3/4 of a string cheese in the center. Just OK.

Meh. These were "allright." Neither my hubs or I were all that impressed (sorry!). Surprisingly, I felt these were terribly bland. My hubs' complaint was twofold - too much green pepper and more than one serving per loaf (this recipe yielded 6 mini loaves, but each one was at LEAST two servings worth). I think scaling this down a bit and omitting the bell pepper would have worked much better for us. A lb. of ground beef will EASILY yield 4 larger loaves or 6-8 smaller (single serving) ones. With sides, there was just too much food for two people to eat! NOTE: If you have string cheese on hand, use it (it works great!). Cut each stick in half. You'll only need 3 sticks  total(assuming you follow this recipe exact). If you make 4 loaves, use 2 sticks or if you make smaller loaves, just cut each into thirds. Served with mashed potatoes, green beans and garlic butter crescents, this was "OK" meal. Thanks anyways, Campbells! :-)

I didn't make the as "make-ahead" meat loaves.  I baked and ate them the same day I made them.  The kids really liked these, but my husband and I were on the fence.  They were a little on the dry side and a little too much like a huge meatball, instead of a moist meatloaf.  I actually think that making these into small meatballs and cooking them in a slow cooker in the sauce would be a better idea.

This is a wonderful meatloaf recipe.  My entire family enjoyed it, even my daughter who doesn't like meatloaf.  Will definately make again.

I actually messed up and left the sauce out of the meat mixture.  Since I had already formed the "meatloaves", I just poured the sauce over the top of them.  DELICIOUS!  Served with pasta.

This is fantastic.  I did not have any bread crumbs so I have often used whatever "flake" type cereal I have on hand.  I used Honey Bunches of Oats for the bread crumbs. (rolled them) I subbed eggbeaters  (equivalent to 2.5 eggs) , put in a tablespoon of italian seasoning, 1 TBLS of minced garlic, sautéed the onions and this dish was excellent.  I also made the whole pan instead of mini loafs.  My meatloaf pan was too small so I put mine in a bit flatter but bigger dish.  350 for 65 minutes.  Mine probably took less time than the others due to the flatter baking dish.  (oval casserole shape)  Highly recommend this recipe.

I really liked this.  I did make a couple of changes, based on our preferences and what I had available.  I baked this as one single meatloaf (took about 1 hr and 20 minutes at 350), used half vension and half beef, shredded cheese, Stove Top whole wheat stuffing, and sauteed the onion and green pepper before combining with the other ingredients (DH doesn't care for crunchy things in his meatloaf).  I wouldn't hesitate to make this again, with or without my changes.

It was good, but nothing spectacular. I would recommend adding more veggies (mushrooms, carrots, etc) and dicing them. Still fun, ESPECIALLY over angel hair pasta

This recipe is great.  Try adding 6oz. of pepperoni. I cut the pepperoni in small pieces put paper towel in a bowl then microwaved. Then I pressed papertowels on the pieces to remove all the grease, then mixed with all the other ingredients.
