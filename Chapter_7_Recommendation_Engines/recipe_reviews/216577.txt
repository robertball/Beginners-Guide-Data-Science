Very easy to do! I made it directly in a 9 x 13 glass dish sprayed with Pam - served out of the dish fine. Not a stron coffee flavor at all. Hardly any for that fact. The overall favor was more vanilla-like - mostly took on the vanilla wafer favor. Everyone at work raved and ate he whole thing. Very good and would make it again!!

This recipe is definetly a keeper!! I have made it several times in a spring form pan. For the crust I used 3+ cups of nilla waffers, 1 cup of butter, and  1/4 cup of sugar.....I bake it at 325 for 1 hour and 10 minutes and then let it sit in the oven for another hour!! "This is the best cheesecake that I have EVER had!!", has been said to me more than once when sharing this cheesecake with family and friends!!

I don't even like tiramisu, but I did like this cheesecake, and so did my famliy. I made half a recipe and used 50 mini vanilla wafers (25 for each layer). I used light cream cheese and light sour cream. I baked it in an 8-inch square pan for 39 minutes. I would make it again!

This is a good recipe and it is pretty simple. I used brewed coffee rather than instant and I made my own whipped cream using heavy cream, powdered sugar, Kahlua, and coffee. The baking time was a little longer than expected but all in all it was great.

i love and use this recipe all the time. It is so easy and delicious. If you don't have instant coffee you can just use strong regular coffee.

This is my go to dessert recipe! Sooo good!! People always ask that I make it and I never have leftovers. I sprinkle chocolate shavings on the top with the cocoa powder to dress it up a bit.

This is so good! I made it for my grandparents 60th anniversary party and it was a major hit! The only thing I changed was adding twice the amount of instant coffee.

WOW, delicious!  As others did, I halved the recipe and used an 8 x 8 pan.  I used a glass Pyrex, and just greased with shortening.  It served fine.  Didn't bother with the foil lining.  I baked at 325Â°F for 40 minutes.  I didn't fuss with the instant coffee.  I just made a strong coffee in my French press.  I used some coffee to brush on the wafers, and used a tablespoon of coffee in the bottom layer batter.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa to the bottom layer batter to give it a richer color.  I used Neufchatel cheese, light sour cream, and light whipped topping.  Didn't matter, it was DELICOUS.  It's a keeper.

While the cheesecake was easy to make and set well, my family and I thought the flavor and texture were pretty off. The two layers of Vanilla Wafers made it less cheesecake-like than I had hoped. Overall, I would not make this recipe again.

This was very easy to prepare and pretty tasty.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan for 40 minutes.

Used ladyfingers instead of vanilla wafers. That kept the texture soft and silky throughout. Excellent.

WOW!  This was hit for my family!  I accidentally left out the sour cream and still tastes amazing!  I did add about 1/4 cup of espresso to my cream cheese mixture, as well as a few tablespoons of dark rum.  Came out great!  Highly recommend!

All my mom could say was mmmmmmmmm... the whole time she ate it. Enough said just from that. I halved the recipe though and baked the cheesecake in a 8x8 in pan. It is now in my personal recipe book!:))

Made the recipe but doubled the amount of coffee and added 1/4 tsp cocoa powder to the bottom cake layer.  It was delicious and weâll definitely make it again.

was skeptical about how it would taste at first as it was fairly easy to make. needless to say, it was a success! I love it, so does everyone who loves tiramisu! this recipe serves a lot! could probably get by with half of this.

This recipe would get a full 5-star rating but I did change a few minor things and therefore can only give it 4 stars.
What I changed was: the coffee - I just made a strong decaf brew instead of making instant and then I put a healthy amount over the wafer cookies and added 2 tablespoons to the first mixture (next time I think I will add a bit more as well as add it to the top tier). I also added some coco powder to the bottom tier  to give it a little bit of coloring. 
When I baked it I put it in a spring form pan (which added to the cook time) and I cooked it in a water bath to help it from potentially splitting. Once it was done I turned off the oven and cracked it open to let it slowly cool down for an hour before removing it from the oven and allowing it to finish cooling to room temperature. Using this method I had no splitting on top at all.
The flavor of the cheesecake is so cool. As I mentioned earlier, next time I will add more coffee to the bottom tier cheesecake to bring out that coffee flavor a bit more since the only place I could really taste it (Which was amazing!) was the bottom layer of wafer cookies. Over all though, the flavor was spot on and it had me wanting to go back for more (despite it's richness). I will definitely be making this cheesecake again!

This was easy enough to make and was delicious. Like others, I brewed a strong coffee and used that. I also used about a 1/4 cup of Carolina Cream (rum with cream flavor and bourbon...itâs what Kahlua wants to be when it grows up!) I cooked it in a glass Pyrex and didnât bother with the foil. Next time I will reduce the cooking time to 40 minutes and let stand in the oven with the door open. Not sure if reducing cook time will help with the splitting on the top. Sprinkling with cocoa powder and shaved chocolate helped to cover it.

My family did not like this at all. We love cheesecake and tiramisu but the vanilla wafers really took away from the greatness of the two desserts. Kinda made the cake taste "cheap". Just an opinon. Others may enjoy this though.

This was an easy recipe but it lacked the creaminess of the usual tiramisu.  The flavor was good though.
