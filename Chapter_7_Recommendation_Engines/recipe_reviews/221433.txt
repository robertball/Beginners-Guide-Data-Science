This was very good and very easy.  I made enough for 45 people and everyone enjoyed it.  My only change - My altered servings called for many many Roma tomatoes, peeled.  I drained a #10 can of diced tomatoes and it worked perfectly.

I'm glad I picked this recipe in a hurry last night. I usually will not choose recipes that have not been highly rated by many people and choosing a recipe with only 1 rating is not normal for me. So I had to give this recipe a review. 
The rice turned like a classic Mexican rice. I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so I puréed a 12 oz can and used about 3/4 of the can. I also added a little extra cilantro and next time I will also add green chiles.  This one is a keeper.

I haven’t made Mexican rice in awhile, so maybe my memory is foggy, but I’m not sure I’ve ever made a Mexican rice recipe quite this good.  Rather than trying to grate a tomato, I simply blanched it which made the peel come off easily, then just chopped it up very fine. Scaling this down to two servings meant I had to improvise on the tomato sauce – I wasn’t about to open a can for a mere tablespoon or two.  For those who might find themselves in the same situation, I used half the measurement in tomato paste and water instead and it obviously worked out great because this was simply delicious.  Worth seriously considering for your go-to Mexican rice side dish.

I love this! I've used it so many times! For those of you wondering, the Roma's equal about 1/2 a cup. If you use crushed tomatoes, drain then, and strain them they work perfectly! I live in a seven person  family, three of the kids barely eat anything (especially green things and veggies) but they love this!

This was used as a burrito filling and was delicious! I added some kidney beans.

It was not spicy, so add cayenne or a hot pepper if you like it spicy.

So delicious. Why don't I make flavoured rice more often! This recipe has surely reminded me of that. Oh so good, easy- even when I screwed up a few things (accidentally threw the onions in with the tomatoes and had to pick them out so some onions weren't blanched prior to adding remaining ingredients, sautéed garlic with onions right off the bat...) I was making a big Mexican themed dinner and screwed this up a little- and it was to die for! I added 1 extra tomato for good measure as some reviewers had stated it was dry- I think like any time you make rice like this- better a little more moist than dry- watch not to over cook....for those reviews that said it was too dry, don't think it was the recipe....I also halved the jalapeño
for my guests as they don't like it so hot, and that was a good call.  It sat in a warm oven for about an hour afterwards while I finished everything else, was so good!! Delicious!

This looked pretty in the dish but turned out dry when served at a Mexican-themed party.  Not sure what I would do differently next time....

I've tried a few Mexican red rice recipes and this has been my favorite by far. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It was amazing. I wanted to eat the whole pot. =)

This recipe was easy to create and loved by my whole family. I really like using fresh ingredients. I used 2 medium jalapeños, 3 sprigs of cilantro and one extra Roma tomato. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. The rice was pleasingly "hot" and very tasty. I highly recommend!!

This is definitely the best Mexican style rice I've made to date! It was very simple and quick. Although, I thought peeling and grating the tomatoes was ridiculous, I grated my fingers more than I grated the tomatoes - so next time I'm just going to peel them with my hand peeler and pulse them in a food processor until they are chopped very fine.

I've made so many different recipes for rice & this has to be the best by far. The rice was perfectly cooked through without being mushy at all or too firm. The only alteration I made was add 1/2 c of chopped green bell pepper & 1/2 c of chopped red bell pepper to the onion mixture. Wonderful!!

Great rice recipe. I used Pato tomato sauce instead of regular for a little extra kick. I also don't usually pick recipes with a low amount of ratings but I'm glad that I tried this one.

Very, very good! I added some cumin in for extra flavor, and instead of using roma tomatoes and tomato sauce, I used a can of diced tomatoes. I almost thought I would have to much liquid, but it turned out great! Also I used Uncle Ben's Original whit rice and let it simmer for 20 minutes, so probably for the time use whatever the rice you're using says. Maybe add taco beef next time to make it a mea. :)

My family liked this much more than I did. The flavor was good (I omitted the cilantro because gross), but it definitely needs a little more water and more cook time. It was very crunchy.

It was good and pretty easy.  I've never grated tomato before, next time I would probably just use canned tomatoes as grating made a bit of a mess.

I have been making this rice for years whenever it is Mexican night. It is excellent. It is better if you make your own broth but the others will do. One warning: you will get hooked on this!

I finally found a recipe that duplicates the rice I am served in Mexican restaurants!  I followed this recipe exactly and measured everything. It turned out wonderful! I served it with Pork Carnitas, refried black beans and hot corn tortillas.

I made for a Mexican potluck and all loved it. I used a box of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and sauce. Because I used brown rice it took about an hour and 15 minutes and extra chicken broth. Otherwise the same. Just enough spice!

Excellent and easy. I, too, did not grate the tomatoes. I diced them finely, and this was an excellent side dish. I'll be making this again, without the heater!

I tried making it following the recipe, but it didn't have enough liquid to get my rice soft. I ended up adding a can of tomatoes and a lot more water to get it to cook properly.  I used brown rice instead of white, so maybe that was why.
The taste was good. I didn't use cilantro because I'm one of those people who think it tastes like soap.

Very good. Didn't use a whole jalapeño just some slices of pickled jalapeño which was good as my husband and I found it  spicy enough.

We used a mild salsa instead of the hot peppers. We also like beef in our rice. Other than those changes, easy peasy and delicio!!!

I used the canned diced tomatoes and canned chopped green chilis. I made the recipe for 20 and used one 4 oz can of chilis. I made 1/2 the recipe, placed covered in 250 oven and made the second half. Both pans were moist and flavorful. I will be making this again trying different additions to change it up.

This rice is great!  I switched it up and used a can of rotel rather than the Roma tomatoes and it was still really good.  I seasoned with lawreys, pepper and a little cumin.

I am new to cooking so please understand if I can do it anyone can!  I made this recipe as listed and my entire family loved it.  We are all Mexican food lovers so this recipe was an amazing find.  Next time I will increase the garlic a little (just because we love us some garlic ;) but this is really delicious & easy to follow.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a well balanced dish. I followed the instructions, except I used 2 teaspoons of canned peppers instead of fresh. The flavor is good. The fresh cilantro adds a nice bite, but not too over powering. Made it for a teachers luncheon.

Made this on a whim to accompany our tacos. It was delicious. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have any. Otherwise made as directed. My whole family loved it, and we agreed it tasted just like the rice at our local authetic Mexican restaurant. This is a keeper!

I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used roasted canned tomatoes. I also didn't have jalapeños so I used some crushed red pepper and cayenne. The recipe tasted delicious! Thank you! I am saving this one.

Very good and easy to follow recipe. I left out the Roma tomato only because I forgot to grate it and when I realized this I was to far into the cooking process to stop. Even without the tomato it was still a very delicious and fluffy rice. Will make again.

I made this exactly as the recipe states with the exception of substituting a 1/2 cup of diced tomatoes in place of the Roma tomatoes. This turned out awesome! Will be making this quite often.

This  was very good.  The only problem I had was with the instruction to grate the tomatoes and discard the skin.  I was not able to grate the tomatoes.  Instead I just diced the tomatoes very small and used all of the tomato except for the core and seeds.  This rice came out delicious and just what I was looking for.  It was a little on the spicy side (no complaint) because the pepper I used was on the larger side.  This is just the side dish I was looking for.

Simple recipe to make.  Fresh cilantro gives it a strong flavor.  Grated Roma tomatoes did as well.  Will make this recipe again.

This is hands down the best rice dish I've ever made. I followed the recipe as written (minus cilantro) and found it very flavorful, moist and just the right amount of spice! I will definitely make this again and again!

We really enjoyed this rice.  I did make changes though.  In order to make it a one pot meal, I added a pound of browned hamburger.  No fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes and added some green pepper which I cooked with the onion.  My rice needed to cook a little longer than 15 minutes, I think 18 would probably be good.

Loved this rice!!! Reminded me of the Mexican rice at restaurants back home (we are currently stationed in Germany). Thanks for the recipe!!!
