This is good, although because of a garlic allergy I use sauteed onion instead. Salt is not needed because smoked salmon is quite salty. Celery is a good addition to this recipe or even a few peas.

This recipe was delicious!  The longer the soup simmers the more it will take on the smoked salmon flavor - great for cold and rainy days!

Wow! This was absolutely divine!  I am vegetarian, so I used veggie broth instead of chicken, and smoked tofu instead of salmon. In fact, I think it would be equally as delicious without the smoked tofu / salmon. The roasted garlic really gives this its special flavor. By the way, I had to roast the garlic more like 35 or 40 minutes rather than 25.

This is a great recipe that I've made twice now to rave reviews. I make a similar soup that uses ham instead of salmon, and both are now part of my regular rotation of favorite soups.

Great soup! Quick and easy. Salmon is really expensive where I live, so I just cut up some smoked ham instead. Also delicious!! Will make again.

I love this soup, and sometimes make it with other smoked fish, like smoked trout or bonito.  Or mixed seafood for a nice seafood chowder.  Might I suggest for those who are vegetarian or Vegan, use a head of cold-smoked garlic instead of the smoked salmon.

Excellent! All I changed was the onion, I used a whole medium onion rather than the 1/4 cup that was suggested. Aside from that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was AWESOME! thanks for a great recipe!

Very good! I made a few tweaks based on personal preference, but nothing big. Less potatoes, less broth, minced garlic (un-roasted), and a diced celery stalk. When I added pepper to taste, I used black and white pepper with several shots of hot sauce. Thank you for the easy and tasty recipe!

Very good, worth making again--and great for leftover Salmon.  I love the green onion paired with it.

I made this without the salmon because I didn't have any, but just the smell of this simmering on the stove is enough to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  What is it about the smell of roasted garlic that triggers that little smile and desire to give yourself a hug?   My BF was sick and wanted this over his usual chicken noodle soup.  Not sure if there is a better compliment than that.

Made this exactly to recipe.  It was ok, awfully rich - it may be the cream, which I don't normally use. I doubt I'll make this again (there's too many other recipes to try!)

This soup was easy to make and tasted good. My husband ate 3 bowls of it! Next time I will leave more pieces of potato and onion intact, and I will make a double batch!

I know this would be good with smoked salmon, but I used 2 cans of kippered herring and it was very good also.

My family and I were skeptical about how good this would be, but this just became my favorite soup. Every ingredient added its own little thing to the flavor without overpowering it. It was fantastic.

Used milk instead of heavy cream, and just used one box of Campbell's no-salt chicken broth (although I added about 1/3 tsp of salt afterward). Didn't have thyme so I used basil instead, and blended everything so it was all nice and smooth. It was amazingly delicious.
