Using several of the suggestions, I went with the oven bag and turned the heat down to 250 degrees. I placed everything in a turkey sized bag in my roaster (with a little extra water and chopped celery), and after 3 hours, I removed the orange slices. I then added the cabbage, apples, margarine, caramelized onions and several cubed potatoes to the pan and cooked for another 3 hours. There was plenty of liquid in the bag, and everything tasted GREAT. Excellent recipe!

OG 04/01/06 review: This recipe was really great and easy!  When we got up to our new cabin the stove wasn't working correctly so I cut the water down to about 1/4 cup or less, and did it in a crock pot for 8 hours on Low.  Turned out magnificently!  The orange wasn't discernable as a separate taste really (I'm not in the Fruit and Meat camp normally), but imparted a more complex flavor that is indescribable.  I only wish I had tried cooking the cabbage with the apple, but I barely remembered to cook the cabbage, the room smelled so great!  I served it with mustard.

2007 addendum: Did this again in 2007, rinsed smaller brisket (3.25 lbs.), used included spice pack plus a little more pickling spice, one orange, one onion, celery salt (just two shakes) and 1/4 cup water in the 4 quart crock pot since it is about the same as cooking in a sealed oven...maybe a little moister so you have to cut the water down due to the practically sealed environment.  Again I used about 8 hours as the rule, but took it out in 7.  Turned out swell again this year!  But I must say, please, please get the more expensive cuts without all of the salt, etc..  Otherwise it tends to run a little salty.  This year I added a granny smith to the cabbage.  It was heavenly!  The prep for this is so simple because there's no dicing, just slice ingredients throw it all in the crockpot (shears minutes off wrapping in foil) and plug it in, but don't forget to turn it on!

A great simple recipe for a very tasty Corned Beef and Cabbage.  The only thing I did differently was to use a Reynolds Oven bag instead of aluminum foil, and the beef turned out very succulent and tender.

I never would have tryed this recipe if it where not for all the rave reviews.  One word...YUMMMMMMM!
Very tender,moist and easy.  I doubled the liquid and used beef broth rather than water.  Didn't have enough pickling spice in the house, so I came up with my own concoction of Mustard Seed,Caraway Seed, Whole Coriander and Allspice Seeds, Hot pepper flakes, tumeric, a crumbled bayleaf and Afew Black Peppercorns.
My entire family voted this tops and I will never boil Corned Beef again.

This was excellent!  My 'St. Patrick's Day' guests were IMPRESSED indeed. The meat was tender and flavorful, just PERFECT!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I cooked two 2.5-pound briskets in Reynolds Oven bags at 250 degrees for 5 hours.  The house smelled heavenly and there was no mess to clean up.  I loved the flavor of the cabbage and apples prepared separately (be careful not to overcook them).  This was an easy, ELEGANT YET EARTHY dinner that I served with tiny Yukon gold potatoes, Irish soda bread and Ruffino Chianti. We finished up with individual frozen green grasshopper tarts.  Thanks 'originalsyn' for this great corned beef recipe!

I am not sure how the previous user could only score this one star. I made this recipe on 03/11 for my husband  and we had 2 guests for dinner. I made the recipe as is listed. It said serves 8 with 5 1/2 lbs of brisket. THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT!! I even served baby red boiled taters with it. We just could not stop dipping that fork into the meat platter. It was moist and cut like butter. My guest commented cabbage had a great flavor not "saurkrouty". This is a keeper that I will make again soon and not just for St. Paddy's day.

Fantastic!  Such a difference from regular boiled corned beef.  And we absolutely loved the cabbage and apples-  I carmelized some onions and added a few teaspoons of apple cider vinegar, then added the cabbage, apples and water.  Divine!

This is a great recipe and easier than boiling.  I use a rack and apple juice instead of water.

This is excellent flavor and easy to make.  Substitute Granny Smith because that's what I had on hand. Also made a sauce of low fat sour cream and horseradish with a spoon of Dijon.

Excellent.  The best corned beef I ever cooked.  Very tender and tasty.  So much easier than my past recipes of boiling on the stove.   I found the cabbage very plain.  I would use the juices next time to cook the cabbage in.  One year later now......... I used the juice to cook the cabbage in still not enough taste for us.  Next year I will try opening the foil and adding the potatoes and cabbage in the meat for the last hour.  The corned beef was excellent again.

"You are adding oranges to the corned beef?????" was my husband's question and his next comment "I like it boiled - I am not sure I will like it with oranges!"...5 hours later, I could not stop him from eating it and telling me "this is the nest corned beef you have ever made!"  THANK YOU for recipe and the added reviews that gave me the idea to: use an oven bag instead of the aluminun foil (it is hard to keep the foil well sealed- may be this is the reason for one of the comments that the recipe had ended too dry - no way with the oven bag!) I follow the recipe as indicated otherwise, and the meat was so flavorful, not salty and it melted in your mouth! Thanks to the person who suggested serving with a sauce made of sour cream, horseradish and dijon mustartd - great combination. I served with boiled red potatoes which I peeled only a strip to prevent them from bursting during the cooking, and I used a 1/4 cup of this water to boil the cabbage and the apples - which end up adding such as food flavor to the whole siddings.  I can understand now why this recipe got such "wow!" reviews - here is to the lady who so generously shared this recipe, and a big "WOW!" to your recipe! Update: I have been making this recipe for some time, and for those who are worried about the time to cook a different size of beef - the formula is 50 minutes per lb. and it is great.

I tried this recipe tonight.  It is excellent!! I used a roasting bag.  I pressed the orange slices and diced onion on top of my corned beef.  I also added chicken stock instead of water. I added a little brown sugar into the cabbage and apple.  The corned beef drippings in the roasting bag turned out soooo tasty that I added about a ½ cup to the cabbage and apples.  I also made a sauce with sour cream, Dijon mustard, horseradish and a little bit of mayo to pour over the corned beef. My family also added the sauce to their red potato wedges that I baked as a side.  Thank you for this recipe.  It’s our family favorite now.

Since trying this recipe 3 years ago, we no longer just have this on St. Pat 's Day! It has become a staple to our dinner choices. I make it in my clay cooker, and it never shrinks. I do add about 1/4c. of cream to the cabbage at the end and a pinch of nutmeg. Other than that this recipe is just perfect!

Well done.  I just was not in the mood to boil this St. Patricks, so I gave this one a try.  I tucked everything in very tightly within the foil, and then packed it into a oven bag.  Deep rich flavor, my family loved it.  The apples added to the cabbage really help set off the salty flavor of the corned beef, and in its own way adds a uniquely Irish-American quality to the meal.  A great new tradition for my Irish (plus plenty of others)-American home.

Another 5 start review~!  I use recipes from this site all the time but this is close to the first time I've ever felt compelled to review.

In short, cabbage hating hubby loved verything including the cabbage.
Visiting Italian guest said "Hurray for the Irish!"

I did the following:  Used my largest lasagne pan, added apple juice instead of water per suggestions.  Covered corned beef etc, tightly with several layers of foil.  After 3 hours I removed the oranges and piled in the quartered cabbage, apple wedges, whole onions, carrot chunks and new potatoes.  Sealed up again with foil and left it go for about 2 hours and everything was done to perfection!

I also will never boil again.  Thanks so much to the submitter for this fabulous recipe!  Loved it!

This is my 10 year old son's FAVORITE meal.  The corned beef is very moist and flavorful - just remember to adjust the cooking time if your corned beef isnt the size of the one in the recipe- 50 mins per pound seems to work well.

I never thought I liked corned beef outside of a reuben sandwhich until I tried this recipe. I served it up with cabbage and apples and garlic potatoes and it was delicous. The aroma that filled my house would make any guests mouth water. I won't bother looking for another corned beef recipe, you can't get much better than this one.

First time making corned beef and cabbage and what a hit it was. Until this recipe, I was not a fan of corned beef.  My husband thinks this was "incredible" and wants more St Patty's days during the year.  I made a slight change, opening up the foil and adding carrots and potatoes(removed oranges) then resealed it for the last hour+.

I've used this recipe for the past 2 years to feed about 85 people at our church supper and it really brings RAVE reviews!  People who usually don't like corned beef like this ---- and those that do like corned beef say it's the best they've ever eaten.  I think that tightly sealing it in the oven enhances the flavor. (Boiling on top of the stove method tends to "wash" out the flavor!)

Other than not using the celery, I made this per the recipe. The corned beef was exceptionaly tender but it didn't taste as good as I expected. It didn't taste like corned beef is suppose to taste... It was good but not what I expected.

Oh WOW! This was INCREDIBLE! I followed the directions exactly and didn't even bother to make the cabbage since I knew my family wouldn't like it and this was the Best Corned Beef I've ever had/made! My Hubby said I had to make it this way from now on. And the smells in my house while this was cooking was wonderful! Like others I was alittle scared about the orange but it didn't taste like that at all, it blends in well w/ the pickling spice, my only complaint was that I didn't need to cook it for 4 hours but I knew that my oven tends to cook at a higher temp anyways so at 3 hours I doubled checked the beef to see how it was cooking and it was already done. ***UPDATE*** I make this every few months now and everone loves this. I even have a few Irish poeple who request this dish when they come over for dinner. DEFINATLY give this recipe a try. I have not had one person who didn't like it.

My past experiences with Corned Beef has always conjured up images of bland, over-boiled, chewy shoe leather.   This recipe is nothing like that.  If you like the boiling method, stay with it.  The beef in the baking method will taste nothing like the typical boiling method.  Boiling/Simmering "washes" out the flavor/salt in the corned beef, whereas the baking method intensifies the "corned" flavor.  I will never go back to boiling ever again.  
I  followed another review's lead and used apple cider rather than water; I also added some whole black peppercorns and a couple of whole cloves.  My corned beef was only a mere 3#, so I baked it for just under 3 hours.  I had no problems with the meat drying out - make sure your oven is calibrated, or use an oven thermometer.  Next time I might follow another reviewer's lead and use a roasting bag rather than foil.

Excellent. The only thing I would change is the cooking temperature. I lowered mine to 250 and cooked it about 5 to 6 hours. Also, it was a 3 12 lb brisket.

Wow.  I covered my brisket with the pickling spice then let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Wow!  Will not ever boil another corned beef. I can only give this 4 stars, since the timing was way off on the stove-top items.  Ended up with mushy apple, and not done cabbage (I took it off the heat after looking at the apple.) The meat was amazing.

My mother in law said this was the best meal I had ever cooked her and that she had never had corn beef this delicious.  She was ill with cancer and died soon after.  I will never forget making her a ultimate meal finally.

I TOO HAVE been making corned beef the EXACT SAME WAY for years and I can even tell you WHERE the Recipe came from   ..."THE BROOKLYN COOKBOOK" by Lynn Stallworth.  It is a compilation of Jewish American recipes.. I was looking for a new recipe and saw the pic of the corned beef w/ oranges and just about fell out of my chair.....same layout of meat / vegies...foil and even the same pan!!!!!!

I made this recipe with a few changes - I didnt have a roasting bag so I used foil.  I didn't really have the time to do it all start to finish on a weekday so I prepped at night and cooked it the next day (no problems there except maybe the pickling spice had a little more time to "do its work").  I used the apples I had on hand and I baked my 3.5# beef at 250F for 5.5hrs instead.  It came out a little dry I think but I've never had corned beef before so who knows.  My husband loved it and asked me to make it again instead of boiling the beef.  The fruity taste worked well.  I wasn't big fan of the taste of the beef but I don't think that had anything to do with this recipe so I'm rating high.

Wow, this was the best.  My husband and I have been looking for a great corned beef and cabbage recipe for 13 years.  Neither one of our families made this tradiditional St. Patricks's Day meal, so we have tried many different recipes.  This one is the best!  We'll definitely share this one with our friends.

The corned beef was point cut and about 4 lbs and it had to cook about 6 hrs (I set my oven at 250.)  It was juicy and tender.  Use some of the juices for the cabbage, and don't forget the apple, as it also helps to give the cabbage a nice flavor.

This recipe is a gift to corned beef lovers.  First, it solves the mystery of what's in those little spice packets (that mine didn't have included), then it added the perfect complement of oranges, onions and celery steamed in with the spices to create a wonderful, flavorful meal.  Thanks to ASTAARA's review, I chose to drop the temp down to 250 degrees as I, too, was using two 2.5 lb. flat-cut briskets.  Covered tightly in foil, it cooked for 5 hours.  I used my crockpot to boil baby red potatoes, carrots, parnips and boiling onions and added a little of the spices to the water.  The cabbage with apples was wonderful too!  I don't make this meal often, but today's results have set the standard as high as it gets.  Thanks!

I love this recipe!  Never tried baked corned beef before.  Made it last year for a St. Patty's Day Dinner and everyone was wowed!  Much better than boiling it!  I really liked the cabbage too.  Adding the apple to the cabbage gave it a very rich flavor.  This will definitely be a tradition at our house.  Thanks for sharing it.

Used a point cut corned beef, and this was a huge hit.  Cooked it in the Le Creuset and was sorry I didn't tin-foil the top to retain moisture.  The cabbage cooked with apples was excellent too.  Found I needed to actually cut little bits of the orange and layer it on the fork with the meat to get the "effect", but what a fabulous effect it was.  Easy, delicious and got raves from the other diners - thanks so much!

I made this for St. Patricks Day and it was EXCELLENT!  It took five hours .  My family was worried because I wasn't making it the same usual way (boiling) and they loved it.  They only want this recipe used now.

Wonderful recipe. I used this recipe for the corned beef served at the senior living facility where I work. I used 2 ten to thirteen pound briskets and cooked for about 8 hours. I drained the wonderful liquid off and chilled and reserved till the next day. Covered the corned beef and placed in the cooler, to be sliced the next day. Because I was cooking for 40 people I did everything in the oven. Using the reserved juices I did carrots, potatoes and cabbage in separate pans. The corned beef was tender as can be. The veggies were fantastic. The residents would like it on the menu again. That alone is a big compliment. Thanks for sharing.

Simple and very good.  I threw all the ingredients into the crock pot and let it cook.  I cooked the cabbage separately on the stove top.  The apples were a nice touch.

I am jumping on board with everyone else - EXCELLENT!  Followed ingrediants as listed.  I used a crockpot AND a foil bag in it - best cornbeef we've ever had!!!!!  Orange added a nice taste but my husband couldn't place the taste when I asked him what the secret ingrediant was.  I'm normally thankful that I only have to eat this once a year, but I'm 0making another next week while CB still on sale!!!!  Only thing I might change is a bigger piece of meat so that this time wehave leftovers!!!!

Worked great, needed a little more cooking time to fit my schedule so Ilowered the temp to 250 and baked for 6 hrs.  Stir fried a cole slaw mix with the apple for a crew tht doesn't care for kraut.  Everything was very tasty.

Followed this recipe exactly, using reynolds cooking
bag instead using aluminum foil. This turned out to be by far and away the finest corned beef I have ever had. The meat was not only flavorful, but it literally melted in your mouth.

Finally!  A corned beef recipe that doesn't cause the beef to shred when you slice it.  Even my picky kids loved it!  Can't wait to make sandwiches with the leftovers.

I made this for St Patty's day dinner, very yummy. The oranges give it a kind of fruity undertone. I used a cooking bag and lowered the temp to 275 for about 4 hours. I sliced the leftovers for Reubens the next day, great!

My family loved this. I also took some advice and used the cooking bag, 250 for 3 hours with orange slices and celery, xtra water. After 3 hours removed the orange slices and added the rest including the caramelized onions and potatoes, for another three hours, excellent.

I will never, ever boil my corned beef again.  EVER! It smelled delicious while baking all day.  I made a 4 lb.   piece at 250 degrees.  I added apple juice instead of water in both the beef dish and the cabbage.  The apples were a nice touch.  I started out with bacon fat instead of margarine.  Personal preference.  Gives it a nice smokey, meaty taste.  I made boiled potatoes on the side.  I threw a little bit of apple juice in that water also.  Enjoy!  You will not be disappointed.

Let me add my rave review, just in case 37 positive ones were not enough.  If you are thinking of trying this out, don't hesitate...run to the store and get what you need!  We all loved it, such an improvement over rubbery boiled corned beef!  I used the slow cooker method and cooked it for 8 hours on low, but it was probably done in about 6.5 hours.  My brisket was only about 3 pounds to start, so I didn't use as much pickling spice.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing...spectacular!

I haven't made this recipe YET, but I plan on making and serving it for St. Patrick's Day supper.  I've been a member of Allrecipes for almost 5 years and this is the first time I've seen a recipe with so many 5-star ratings.  

Last night I used my "old" recipe and boiled a corned beef.  It had a delicious flavor but was dry and chewy.  I'm throwing out that old recipe and replacing it with this one.

This recipe is a keeper! I was looking for something a little different than just boiling the corned beef. This was definately the best corned beef I have ever made. Very tender and exceptionally tastey. I added chicken stock to the cabbage instead of the water for a little more flavor. My family loved it.

Very Good! I cook and demonstrate for a living, so I am always cooking different things for my two guy roommates, then they tell me what they think. They said this was better than they have ever had, and loved the slight essence of orange that this recipe has. I will make it again!

Excellent recipe.  I will never boil corned beef again.  Wrapping in foil and cooking it in the oven preserves all the good flavor.

This was my first attempt at corned beef and I couldn't be more pleased with the results. I don't like to boil meats do when i saw this i had to give it a try. This is the only way i will serve corned beef. The cabbage was great too, the sweet really set off the saltiness of the meat. Served with boiled red potatoes...fantastic.

I am so disappointed. I followed this recipe exactly and was very excited about it after reading the reviews. My piece of corned beef was 2.79 lbs. I started cooking with plenty of time, even though I figured it wouldn't take the 4 hours recommended for the 5+ lb. piece the recipe calls for. I checked after 2 hours and it was not nearly done, cooked it an hour longer and checked again. After cooking for almost 4 hours, I took it out, sure that it must be done and tender. Everything else was ready, but the meat was tough. I ended up having to put it in my pressure cooker and cook it for more than 30 minutes longer before it was tender. The flavor was good. I liked the subtle hint of orange. I won't use this recipe again though... back to boiling my corned beef.

My husband was disappointed with the flavor because of the orange. He wants his corned beef to taste like traditional corned beef and this recipe does not. Unfortunately, my not-quite-sure-I-like-corned-beef guests didn't brag on the flavor either. Therefore everyone at the table was a little disappointed at the end of the meal. I won't fix corned beef this way again. I did give it 4 stars because I had everyone rate it at the meal and then threw out the teenagers' ratings!

I have always boiled corned beef, but never again!  This turned out to be the best I've ever had; and my family couldn't stop eating it.  I used the aluminum foil method, but will probably try the cooking bag next time because it just sounds easier.  My husband doesn't like fruit of any kind in his main meals, so I left out the orange.  I followed the recipe for the apples and cabbage, but replaced the apples with cubed red potatoes, cooking the potatoes first for about 10 minutes.  Then I added the cabbage wedges and cooked it about another 15-20 minutes until it was all tender.  DEELISH!!!

This looked wonderful. I made this for St. Patrick's day. Everyone else enjoyed it, I didn't. I gave it two stars because I just didn't like the orange peels, very strong flavor. Although the cooking method was a great Ideal. I used a turkey roasting pan with lid. I added two cups of beef stock, celery, apple and baked for three hours. Then added potatoes next to the meat then covered with a whole head of cut up cabbage. I will make this again, just without the orange.

Wow! I agree with everyone else  - best tasting, most moist corned beef! I did what HeyChelle suggested and threw it all in the slow cooker since it was too nice outside! Did cabbage & apples on stove top - yum! Thank you!!

WOW!!! This recipe is sooo good. The only way I will cook corn beef now. This was so moist and full of flavor you couls cut it with a fork. My son said do not cook corn beef boiled anymore, this is the only way he will eat it and he loves the leftovers(if there are any) in sandwiches. The only change I made was the cabbage, did not use the apples, just boiled it and added butter, so good. Thanks for a great recipe.

So much better than the boiled corned beef and cabbage.  I added more water to the cabbage to help it not stick to the bottom of the pan (last year this was a problem).  I also had no problem with foil, but I do see how an oven bag would make things easier.

Just for  your information, we met a man who was born and raised in Ireland, and he said that he never heard of corned beef and cabbage until he came to the US.  Very intersting.

This recipe was excellent, very different than how I have ever prepared it in the past.  I give it five stars because the flavor was wonderful.  The only problem I had, was that my corned beef was considerable smaller than called for in the recipe, so it was just a bit dry.

This recipe is awesome.  The meat was so tender and delicious!  The orange gave it a very subtle twist.  I put chopped potatoes in the last hour and they were great.  The cabbage with the apple was good too!

This was delicious.  I did my 2 1/2 pound roast in an oven bag for 2 1/2 hours, and used apple juice instead of water and it turned out great.  It did have a salty kick to it, but it wasn't over powering.  We liked having the sauce from the brisket to serve with the cabbage also.  I was worried about running out of water with the cabbage and apple, but didn't need to be, but we weren't huge fans of the mushy apple.  I think it toned down the cabbage during cooking but should be left in the pot rather than served.

I made it for St.Patricks Day this year...and I will NEVER boil corned beef again. Everyone loved the flavor of the meat...I can't say we could really taste any orange flavor but maybe it helped to keep it moist. The apple and cabbage combo is great - but not everyone agreed about that one. I'll be making this every year.

I'd said I wasn't making corned beef and cabbage anymore because it always came out blah, but read all these reviews and gave it a try.  Used a flat cut corned beef, so it was very lean and used apple juice for the water. Also, cooked at 250. Very moist and so much more flavorful than the boiled stuff!! My 21 month old couldn't get enough of the meat! Now we'll be having a good old Irish meal on every St. Pat's!

Wonderful! Cooked it in a roasting bag: 4 hours at 275 for a 5.4lbs brisket. Otherwise, I made it exactly by the recipe. Everyone loved it (although the kids were crazy about the cabbage). My husband and I thought the cabbage had a nice subtle flavor that complemented the corned beef perfectly. I'll be making this again . . .maybe even before next St. Patrick's Day!

I was about to banish corned beef and cabbage from my vocabulary after being disappointed time and again with traditional recipes. This recipe will replace any recipes I currently have. It was excellent! I used the large oven bag and baked at 275 degrees for about 5 hours. I added baby carrots in with the cabbage and cooked red potatoes on the side. I also mixed up the sauce recommended by one of the revewers (sour cream, dijon mustard, horseradish, and mayo). The meal was a hit with my entire family. Thanks for a great recipe!

The other reviewers nailed this one square on - it is far and away the best corned beef I have ever cooked.  I used the cooking bag method rather than foil and it kept the meat moist as could be.  The only change I made was that I poured half a cup of beer into the roasting bag before sealing it instead of half a cup of water.  Guests agreed with my husband and me that it was the best they'd ever had.  I will never cook it any other way again !

This recipe is so yummy!  Very easy to make.  I prepared the dish the night before so that I could come home at lunch to throw it in the oven.  The meat was incredibly tender.  We had no leftovers!  I will make this again.

After reading the reviews, I decided to try corned beef this way. I had three packages, so with one I followed the directions and wrapped it in foil, one I put in a baking bag, and one I boiled in the traditional manner. I was very disappointed with the foil and bag versions....the meat was dry, even though I set the oven at 250, and the citrus left rather an acrid taste to the meat. In the future I will stick to the tried and true boiling method. It surprises me by how many people seem to like this version.

This turned out incredibly well. I substituted margarine with butter, and the cabbage turned out just fine. I probably could have cooked the cabbage a little less than the 30 minutes the recipe calls for.

Something went wrong with this recipe! I used a package of uncured corned beef from Whole Foods which already had the pickling spices included in the package. I followed the directions exactly, omitting pickling spice and the result was SO salty that we couldn't eat it. I would love to know what went wrong.

Oh my goodness I have been making Corned Beef and Cabbage the same way for years always in my Crockpot. Well I don't think I will ever go back to my Crockpot. This was the BEST EVER!!!! And it was like she said prep time wasn't to bad at all.  I made one on Saturday to take to my friends house she made one as well in a Crockpot although hers was good everyone said mine was better. Anyway it was a big hit. Thank You so much for this Recipe. I will be saving this one. CJ Sacramento, CA

Okay, so I didn't follow this recipe exactly but I did use all the ingredients. The end result...THE BEST CORNED BEED AND CABBAGE!!!  I actually boiled the beef to stay true to the culture and the "boiled meat" thing.  I put enough water in the pot to cover my brisket along with the orange, celery, onion and added carrot for a classic mirepoix.  I used the pickling spice packet that came with my 4-pound corned beef and also added an extra tablespoon of pickling spice along with a heavy pinch of salt.  I used 2 heads of garlic simply split horizontally into halves and added that as well.  Brought to a boil and left to simmer for about 5 hours.  Once the corned beef was done I wrapped it in foil to rest, strained the liquid and boiled red potatoes and carrots in the same liquid to infuse all the flavors.  I make corned beef all the time but it has never turned out this good.  The orange really did something special to this dish.  AND THE CABBAGE!!! So simple and soo satisfying.  The only thing I changed is I used a braeburn apple and used the stock from boiling the beef and potatoes to cook the cabbage.  I usually boiled the cabbage in the liquid in the past but no longer will I do that. I'm gonna go make a killer rueben with my leftovers now.  Thanks for the post!  I'll try preparing it the way the recipe is written next time.

I was dismayed to learn the fruit I bought for this recipe was consumed by a household member as a lunch, so had to do without!  Even without the citrus, the corned beef was very good. I cut up Yukon Gold potatoes and added them to the bag to roast in the oven and be flavored by the meat.  Yum.  Instead of using 1/4 c. water to steam the cabbage, I used 1/4 c. vegetable broth to add flavor since I was apple-less!

I only made the cabbage part - for the corned beef, I used the "slow cooked corned beef for sandwiches" recipe from this site.  I followed another reviewers recommendation and added carmelized onion with the cabbage & apple and cooked it with the braising liquid from the corned beef.  I thought the flavor, including the apple, was superb.  However, my husband would have reviewed this at only 3 stars since he prefers cabbage to taste like cabbage.  His comment was to leave out the apple & onion and not cook it with the broth.  So, next St. Patty's day - he'll get plain cabbage.    All that said - this is a really tasty cabbage recipe.

Awesome recipe!  Had dinner for three couples and they all raved!  Only 2 small pieces left from 5 1/2 pounds of corn beef.  As others suggested, used an oven cooking bag and carmelized onions with the cabbage.  I don't really like cabbage but had seconds of this recipe.  Yum!

Yum-O, The meat was so tender and we enjoyed the subtle undertone flavor of the oranges.  We didn't eat the apples with the cabbage (weird texture) but they gave the cabbage a delicate flavor we enjoyed.  The meat was even better the next day.  This is my "new" CB recipe.  Thanks!

Excellent way to prepare corned beef.  Used a Staub pot instead of foil and baked in a 300 oven for about 6 hours.  Rubbed some extra pickling spice and added couple cloves of garlic to the pot.  Cooked vegetables separate and added a bit of water to the pot.  Delicious!  Will never boil corned beef again.

I will never boil corned beef again.  I made exactly as directed, except for using the roasting bag instead of foil.  Cooking the cabbage with apple makes a nice flavor, and it's even better if you put a little juice from the meat on it.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  I only cooked a 2lb briskett, and 2 hours was perfect.  I also used a roasting bag, but I'm sure the foil works well, too.  This was very tasty and tender....good stuff!

use everyones advice and used a cooking bag.  Great recipe, the oranges gave it a nice flavor.  Since cooking it in the oven gives the meat a more salty favor than my health can handle, I will probably try in it a crock pot for a while, then finish in the oven like I used to do.  But I will use the oranges in the oven again.

I made this last year for our St. Patrick's  Day party.  I didn't even get to try it because it went so quick, but it got rave reviews from everyone.

I fixed this recipe for a St. Patrick's Day party at my church last year and everyone loved it.  The best one I've ever tried.  The meat was flavorful and tender and sliced up beautifully.  The apple with the cabbage is wonderful.

Delicious. I used to cook my corned beef in the crockpot but  not anymore. THis is my new favorite way to cook it. The flavors blended nicely.

Dh dind't like that the apple got mushy on his cabbage but it added a nice tasts and made the cabbage sweet. I would try to get around the mushy apple and cook my cabbage this way too.

Thanks

This was delicious.  I took the advice of others and cooked it in an oven bag at 250 for 5 hours.  After 4 hours I opened the bag and took out the orange slices and put in the cabbage.  I forgot the apples but it was great without. A definite keeper.

I had never made corned beef and cabbage before. This was an easy recipe and tastes great too. I cooked mine in a roasting bag at 250 for 5 hours. After 3 hours, I opened the bag, took out the orange slices and added the apples and the cabbage. I loved the flavors!

It was okay, but I like the corned beef with Guinness recipe just as well, and I don't have to deal with the orange and celery.

I made this corned beef for St Patty's Day and it was really good!  My husband loved it.  The only problem i had was cooking time - my roast was only 3.5 lbs, so i wasn't sure how long to cook.  I erred on the side of too long and it was a bit dry, but that was my fault not the recipe.  Also, the cabbage with apples was really good!

Absolutely great recipe. Corned beef went so fast I swear the platter never hit the table. Apples mixed in the cabbage is a nice touch, does make a difference. Did try a few changes. Used an oven bag instead of foil, and added apple juice instead of water to both the bag and the cabbage. When corned beef was done, I basted with a glaze (1/2 cup light karo syrup - or honey - and 2 tsp of prepared mustard), put under broiler for @ 2 minutes, rebaste and another 2 minutes, just until carmalized...be careful not to burn. Served with remaining glaze, a side dish of horseradish and a side of 1000 Island dressing. Oh, make sure you do a big brisket. Leftovers are just as good if not better, especially for Reuben sandwiches.

I always dreaded St. Paddy's day, hated cooking corned beef and cabbage, having leftovers no one really wanted.  I read the reviews and they all sounded so good I tried it.  No leftovers!  My husband said it was the best he ever had.  And my dad said it was really good.  Most times the food is just "Alright!"  This is going in my recipe box forever.  I'll never boil again!!!

WOW!!!  I've never been a huge fan of Corned Beef, but since my husband loves it, I cook it for him.  This was amazing.  I will NEVER again boil my corned beef!  I followed a couple of the other reviewer's tips and used a turkey sized oven bag and apple juice instead of water.  I didn't use the apples in the cabbage...it just didn't sound good to me. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe...I now love corned beef as much as my husband does!

This St. Patty's Day I told my mother I was going to do the cooking and try a different way to cook the corned beef. She looked at me with horror on her face because she is the boil queen and really doesn't like to change the "TRADITION". Well I like adventure and variety, She also told my dad who is a chef and his response was, "It is going to come out to dry". Well, my mom loved it, hubby and my nieces, my dad isn't home from work yet but I can't wait to show him my "DRY" corned beef and cabbage (haha). It wasn't dry by any means. I made two separate pan fulls and I have approx a half of a corned beef left and we were feeding 5/6 people. I made it with another recipe call "foil wrapped veggies" which went great with this. Thank you for the great proven wrong recipe.

This is the best way to make corned beef - so easy and delicious!! Everyone loves it! We serve with "Champ" mashed potatoes (potatoes with whipping cream and butter and green onion) and the "Irish Soda Bread" recipe off of this website. A great holiday meal and tradition. Thank you!!!

Great!  We loved the flavor the oranges gave to the corned beef and the apples were a nice addition to the cabbage.

Fantastic.  So tender it fell apart. And great flavor too. Will not cook corned beef any other way. Leftovers are great for sandwhiches.

Very good; the orange slices certainly added a good flavor!  I do, however, prefer the boil/simmer method of cooking corned beef, as with the roasting method the meat is much more salty and didn't seem as tender...But I am glad we tried this! (Just a thought: can one use a roasting bag instead of foil?)

This was okay--especially liked that it was tender--but it just didn't have that corned beef "zing" I was looking for.  Might try it again but the real keeper on this sight is the corned beef for sandwiches.

Husband thought it better than boiling it. I think it is better boiled than this recipe. Felt the meat was tough (and I cooked it less than the time called for), the flavor is okay, the prep is easy. Rating a four as an average between my husbands rating and mine.

This was fabulous.  My husband said I never had to put the meat in the "hot tub" again.  The consistancy and flavor are so much better than the traditional slow cook method in our opinion.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. This is very good corned beef. Both my wife and also thought the cabbage was good. I don't think it's a 5 star recipe, but certainly a 4.

This was GREAT! I used a 4.8 lb Boars Head Brisket. I cooked it in heavy duty foil for 4 hrs at 300 degrees. It was wonderful. Even my Irish neighbor loved the flavor of this dish. My hubby wanted thirds. I did not realy alter the recipe very much. I used 2 oranges, and I didn't use the remaining butter for the cabbage. I also took the peels from the cooked apples and discarded them, and stirred the cooked apple into the cabbage. It is very important that your foil is very well sealed, so that the brisket is not dried out. I prefer the heavy duty foil for doing this. Good Luck!

We make this all the time, not just for St. Patty's and we LOVE it!  I also use the oven bags to make this and it is so tender and delicious.  We love to serve it with Diane's Colcannon, also on this website...try it together, it's a delicious combo!

Excellent recipe,I'll never boil a corned beef again.Only made a couple of changes.Rather than a foil pack,I found that an oven bag was easier and instead of a 1/4 cup of water I used a 1/2 cup of dark beer.

I tried this recipe because of so many great reviews but it wasn't what I expected.  The meat WAS very tender but the whole dish had a different flavor than I remember.  My mom used to make thas  and called it Boiled Dinner  and I hoped for this flavor--I guess I should have tried one of the more traditional recipes.  Sorry.....

Really good done in a crock pot.  The orange gives it a real kick.  If you put the cabbage in the meat juice instead of water, you don't even need butter or margarine.

The BEST corned beef and cabbage. I used the cooking bag for the oven. Also I followed the recipe exactly and the broth from the meat, fruit and veggies was just delicious. Also, if brand names are allowed I purchased a Boar's Head
corned beef and it was the most lean product. The entire dinner was fantastic!

I took the advice of others and used apple juice instead of water and cooked on 250 for 6 hours.  I also used the apple juice with the cabbage.  This recipe was so delicious that I will never boil corned beef again.

All of my life I have had "boiled" corned beef.  This recipe is delicious!  The corned beef turned out very tender.  Me and my family loved it!  The apples in the cabbage was good, but something seemed to be missing.  Will try different things and let you know what I find.  Thanks for the hint about cooking at 250, I think that made the difference.  I will never boil again.....

This was my very first time making corned beef. What a wonderful and delicious result! The hint of orange was great. Didn't have any apples, so just did plain cabbage. It didn't matter, everything was absolutely yummy. My mother would be so proud to see me cook this meal. Thanks BETHRACHEL!

Awesome recipe! I used apple juice instead of water as another reviewer did. I'll never use just water again! The next day left-over corned beef, I boiled again for an hour in apple juice and added fresh cabbage. Even better!!!

very good.  I cooked two smaller brisket tips, poured the enclosed pouch over them, used celery salt as I didn't have celery and baked at 250 for 6 hours.  The cabbage was wonderful.  Got raves on this and will make again.

I made this for my family for St. Patrick's Day and they all loved it!  I don't eat any mammal, so I didn't have any, but I have to say that I was tempted to try it.  I actually had to make this again a couple of days later since it was all gone and they were clamoring for more.

This was, without a doubt, the best corned beef dinner I have ever made.  And, I was not the only one to say so.  Each of my guest were very pleased and complimented me on the meal.  I did not follow the cabbage portion, I cooked it the old fashioned way in the same water I used to cook a small piece of corned beef, but I have to say I really, really thought this recipe the best ever.  Thank you.

This is an excellent way to make corned beef.  However, I use a large cooking bag instead of Al Foil and it comes out fantastic every time.

It was so good. Something a little different than the usual corned beef and cabbage. The orange added great flavor. I also added garlic and a couple of carrots. I used apple cider instead of water. I will make this again!

We only used half the seasoning package, but the flavor was still a little strong, as was the citrus from the orange, and not really to my personal liking.  The cabbage and apple was really good and complimented the meat.

I liked the flavors a lot, but the corned beef was drier than I would've liked.

This is another good recipe for corned beef and cabbage from this site!  The corned beef turned out tender and so yummy cooked with the celery, onion, and orange.  I cooked red potatoes and carrots in the other pot a little before adding the cabbage and apple.

I cannot fathom how anyone could not rate this a 5 star or even mess it up to get lower rating results.  I switched to this recipe about 10 years ago and have not looked back.  I have never had a complaint, everyone drops dead over it and my picky eater kids ask for it several times a year.  It's so easy and its just FANTASTIC. My Irish born secretary says its SO much better than traditional methods of cooking and asked for the recipe.

I will concur that turkey roasting bags work best, substitute apple juice for water with both the meat AND the cabbage, and I throw in 1/2 tablespoon of extra pickling spice. I usually cook at least two roasts at a time and ALWAYS, ALWAYS use the point cut!!!

I followed the recipe to the letter and I although the meat came out very tender, it was not the flavour I was after. Thanks for sharing though.

This seemed a strange recipe but had such good reviews that I decided to chance it. Oh my goodness, it was wonderful! The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful.
I added 1 tsp of sugar, 1 Tblsp of cider vinegar and a sprinkle of dill to the cabbage and it was the best I have ever made, in 36 years. 
I'm doing it this way from now on.

After reading the review I expected this to be the last Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe to try. I did not think the recipe was that great. I used a roasting bag and the meat was tender. The oranges made the dish bitter. Disappointed with the end result. The cabbage was good!

This was the best Corned Beef and Cabbage I have ever had and my family agrees(ever my husband). I usually make it boiled. But this was so moist and flavorful CB & C.  I cook it in a aluminum foil bag (I made with heavy duty foil).Than my corned beef did not come with the pickling spice.So I added 2 bay leaves, 10- whole peppercorns, 8-whole allspice. I followed  the recipe exactly, except the last hour I removed the oranges and added the cabbage with the meat. I did not use the apple or margarine. I cooked sweet potatoes separately. It added a real nice touch to the corned beef and cabbage. Surprisingly the corned beef didn't have a real orangery taste. This was So........Delicious! . I will defiantly be making this again and not just once a year.

I made this last night for St. Patrick's Day, and it was a hit with my entire family, including my uber-picky husband and 9 year-old son.  VERY easy and  very yummy.   I cooked it in my crock pot on low for about 6 hours, threw in some potatoes for the last three hours, and it came out beautifully.  This is joining our regular dinner rotation, by everyone's request.
