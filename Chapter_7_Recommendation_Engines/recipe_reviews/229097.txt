This was amazing! Thank you for posting.  I read all the reviews and took a chance by reducing the amount of water to 6 cups and doubling the cornstarch.  It was less of a soup consitency and more of a chicken pot pie consistency which is exactly what I was going for.  This made it very easy to travel with.  Also, I dont see how this would fit into a 9x9.  Even with 2 cups less of water I had to use a 9x13.  Everyone loved it and it went fast.  Thanks again.

Perfect for a cold night.  Great comfort food.  Instead of water and bouillon, I used homemade chicken broth.  Sauteed the chicken instead of boiling in the water to give it more flavor.  For 2, I cut the recipe in half and used individual casseroles.  Cut biscuits in quarters and topped the chicken mixture.

Did not thicken enough added at least twice the corn starch the re up called for and it was not as thick as it should have been. It had good flavor but next time I would use less water and more corn starch.

Your idea is good, but a couple of things.  Just cook the chicken breasts with water just to cover, add celery, onion to the water and simmer slowly until done, maybe 40 minutes  Never season chicken you are simmering beforehand...waste of time.  Use chicken stock (which is unsalted) instead of water.  Remove chicken and dice/pull.  Strain stock, add salt/pepper and veges.  Low heat for another 10 minutes, then thicken and add biscuits to top... bake abt 15 minutes.

READ THIS BEFORE TRYING!!!!! As stated by pretty much everyone else, if you follow the original recipe you will have “soup”. I decreased the water you start with and added  extra veggies (three in some spare green beans for good measure), so I could use a 9x13 (even if you followed the base recipe it’s waaaaay too much for 9x9). If you add extra potatoes, and simmer a little longer, you only need to add a little corn starch because the potatoes thicken it up nicely. I made it to that point and was pretty happy with what I had concocted; two containers of biscuits cover 9x13 perfectly. What I did not do was adjust the baking time and temperature. At 15 minutes the biscuits where golden erring on the side of browned. Looked BEAUTIFUL! So I pulled it out and told everyone to get ready, as this took waaaaay longer than advertised. As I start to serve, I see the biscuits are doughy, and not fully cooked. So, refusing to give up after that much time and effort, I flipped them over and popped them back it (ant 15 degrees less) for 9 minutes. It was delicious! But UGLY!!! Heed my warning. I am actually going to redo this one, record my changes and post it. The flavor is fantastic after all the changes, but if you have to read 15 reviews and pull from all of them to get your recipe right! then it’s not a recipe....

Tasted good but as other reviewers said, way too watery. It was basically a soup, and I doubled the cornstarch. It also made a lot more then would fit in 9x9 dish.

This was a hit! I did not boil chicken. I did saute onion, celery and garlic and poured on top of whole chicken breasts in my 9X13  pan. I added poultry seasoning and sage. My kids LOVED this dish. The butter, garlic and parsley added to biscuits made them come out crisp on top and really good! I did bake my dish without biscuits so they would not burn and added them the last 25 minutes.  Takes longer for them to bake then normal.

I was really expecting the liquid to turn thicker like a gravy. I'm not sure why I thought that. It was still completely liquid. The flavor was good. Because it was so liquid, I cooked the biscuits separately. Once they were cooked, we put some of the chicken mixture over the top strained. Then we ladled some of the liquid over the top. Not much. The best part for me was the biscuits. I would have never thought to add something to give them extra flavor. They were very tasty!

This recipe tasted good, it just didn't turn out like I expected. I doubled the amounts for the soup because I wanted to make it in a 9x13 pan. I think I may have added too much water or not enough cornstarch, or maybe it was the recipe itself, because the soup didn't thicken up at all. I ended up straining most of the broth out and just putting the veggies and chicken in the pan with a little of the broth. (Although I did save the broth I strained out and am going to freeze it for later use, good homemade chicken stock.) Then when I baked it, I used grands biscuits, and they started getting too brown on top before they were cooked on the bottom. So I had to take the biscuits off and bake them, doughy side up, on a separate pan. I don't know how to solve that problem. Sorry, I probably won't try this recipe again, it tasted good, but it just didn't turn out quite right.

Excellent taste; however, the stock is too watery.  I will try with less water.  May try with homemade biscuits.

So good! And easy to play around with. I added extra cornstarch until I reached to perfect thickness.

I should have read the verse made this.  It was wonderfully tasting! I would decrease water though and increase cornstarch. I’ll make it again!

I made this vegetarian style and it was really good!  Even my picky 12 year old liked it.  
My changes:  replaced chicken with 3 Quorn Chik'n Cutlets, 6 cups of water (8 was too much liquid), 9x13 baking dish (even with 6 cups would be too much for 9x9), 3 non-chicken bouillon cubes, and baked for 17 min because I used Grands original biscuits.  
Flavor was a little bland, but extra salt & pepper fixed that.  Next time I will use 3 tablespoons of (vegan) butter to brush on the biscuits, omit the Quorn cutlets, add extra seasonings, and I'll make homemade vegan biscuits for a super yummy and easy vegan dish.
