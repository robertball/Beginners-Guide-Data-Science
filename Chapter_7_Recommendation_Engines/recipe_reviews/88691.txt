I put the ingredients in a lightly sprayed pyrex bowl on a trivet in the cooker. This stops the oatmeal sticking. It never fails for me and I have been using my cooker for years to make oatmeal this way. I don't add salt.

It was lovely to wake up to hot oatmeal, but given my adaptations, I don't *need* to make this again, but might.  I was using steel cut oats (granular in appearance / not rolled flakes) so I used the box ratio of 4c water to 1c oats.  Plugged in at midnight. Awoke 7:00 a.m. to hot, creamy oatmeal. Required a stir to get rid of foamy layer, but not much loss in "cling-ons."  *Note to self, use a crock pot liner for zero loss.*  I stirred in  salt and fat free 1/2 1/2, served a bowl with lite butter and Brown Sugar Splenda.  VERY creamy, but a tad gluey. The chewy nutty texture from steel cut oats was lost; more akin to what microwave instant oatmeal is like. I ate a bowl, buttered a loaf pan and poured the rest into the loaf pan and chilled, wrapped. Next several mornings, I sliced a piece of "loaf" into a shallow dish w/ butter/sugar, and into the microwave it went for 1-2 minutes. Hot bubbling oatmeal followed, topped with a bit more 1/2 and 1/2, which was delicious. It stayed fresh for days and days that way.

I boiled the water added the dry steel cut oats and covered with lid.Wait 4 minutes then I turned off the stove and went to bed. In the morning the oatmeal is ready to be quickly heated (add the cream and sugar at that time) this is easy for those who don't have a slow cooker!

Tasted great, but I had to play with the ingredients a bit.. I found that 4 c of water for 1 c of oats was perfect. With 3 c water, the oatmeal had dried up by morning, and with 5 c it was too watery.

I think that the wide variety of results on this recipe can be chalked up to crock-pot differences.  To avoid a cooked on mess, your crock-pot needs to be 2/3-3/4 full when you turn it on. The recipe as written would fail miserably in a 6 qt cooker. Also, due to the long cooking time, use 20-25% more liquid than the oat container calls for.  I wouldn't use instant oatmeal here.  Try Old-Fashioned or Steel-Cut oats.

I have a 6 qt crock pot and I used:
2 cups old-fashioned oats
1 cup steel cut oats
8 cups water
3 cups milk
4 Tbsp butter
1/2 cup brown sugar (should have used more)

I cooked on low for 8 hours and stirred.  The result was creamy and delicious and there was just a little stuck in the corners.  This made a lot, but for the rest of the week I'll just portion it out and add a little milk before re-heating.

I wondered how people were cooking their oatmeal in a big slowcooker and finally found the one piece of info that many people were missing. Use the slowcooker like a bain-marie (water bath)! Inside my slowcooker I put a crock of some type (I use a corningwear pot or a 4 cup pyrex measuring cup). I put all of the oatmeal and water/milk per the recipe into the corningwear pot and then add water to the crockpot AROUND the corningwear pot to about halfway up the side of the corning wear pot. I don't put a lid on the corningwear pot. I put the lid on the slowcooker and put it on low overnight which for me is usually about 6 or 7 hours. In the morning the oatmeal is perfect and just needs a stir. Nothing has ever been stuck to the corningwear pot and because I didn't put the oatmeal into the slow cooker itself I don't have to clean the slowcooker. I just empty the water and wipe it dry.

i read the reviews before i made this, and decided to add 2 tablespoons of butter to keep it from sticking to the crock. it either worked, or my slow cooker is not suceptible to sticking. i cooked it on low overnight, 9 hours, and it was fantastic. i made it again the next night with chopped apple added before cooking. if you do this, make sure to reduce the water by about 3/4 of a cup.

Here's my secret to this recipe:  Use a small dip size crockpot (about one quart), and keep on "warm" setting overnight - I was lucky enough to find a crockpot that small with that setting - it works just great; no sticky, overcooked oatmeal.

I'll never make oatmeal the "regular" way again!  Don't worry about it sticking to the sides a little, just stir it well first thing in the morning, then add your mix-ins (raisins are excellent) and let it sit for a half hour or so, it's great.  Wonderful left over.  I don't use the cream, just add milk to taste (doesn't take much!) to individual bowls.

Delicious! Perfect. After reading all the reviews -- and not having any steel cut oatmeal on hand, just regular old fashioned Quaker Oats -- I made a heavenly breakfast in my 3-qt slow cooker. The key was the 3:1 ratio of liquid to oats. I used 4 cups water and 2 cups milk to 2 cups oats. I added a cut-up Granny Smith apple, pinch of salt, and 1 t. real vanilla. Cooked on low all night (approx. 8 hrs) and am enjoying it now with nothing but brown sugar added. I'll be cooking oatmeal this way from now on. No sticky cooker, by the way -- I sprayed with oil first and it rinsed out in a flash.

I loved this recipe. With my crazy morning schedule, I was so glad to have breakfast finished & not have to worry about cooking.  Soooo easy & can flavor it any way you would like. It was definately very creamy. I thought the leftovers were even better. Soo yummy with splenda, low cal maple syrup & bananas &/or cinnamon.

The end product is excellent, but the losses from sticking to the side need to be addressed. You end up with 3 cups of usable oatmeal and about a cup of stuff stuck to the sides anbd bottom of your slow cooker. I went with 3 1/2 cups of water to see if that helps, and it still wasn't enough to prevent the sticky stuff on the sides. I have been told by someone else to try this with 4 cups and a cup of low-fat milk. That's a lot of moisture, and if it turns out to be the solutuon, the original recipe at 3 cups is way off.

For taste and texture this recipe is tops, and I will keep using it and trying to fix the sticking problem. The end product is really tasty!

Stove top version: Bring water to a boil add the "dry steel cut oats" (We love those). Boil for 4 minutes, stir, cover with lid, turn off the stove, leave on the burner, and go to bed. In the morning the oatmeal is ready & can be stove or mic heated. (add cream & sugar at this time) this is easier then a crock pot for me.

This was GREAT!! I have busy mornings with soccer on Saturdays so this was great! I put in steel cut oats (1c) and multi grain oats (1c) and old fashioned oats (1/2 c).  with 8 cups of water.  I also added 2 or 3 diced apples and cinnamon.  I added 2 tbs of butter and I also sprayed the crockpot with Pam....no problems sticking at all.  I will definatley make this again! Love it!

After reading all the reviews, I think the problem is with the individual slow cookers! Mine only has slow cook/warm settings.  It wasn't clear in the recipe what type of oats, but I used old fashioned oats.  This is what I did to address the burning/mushy problems: I sprayed the slow cooker with Pam, added 1T. I Can't Believe It's Not Butter to mixture and cooked on warm for 10 hrs.  I also adjusted recipe by adding cinnamon to taste and a capful of vanilla extract but also mixed fat free half-and-half and brown sugar in the night before to cook all together overnight.  The only thing I added in the am  was 2 sliced over ripe bananas. It was so creamy and  it was a great bananas and cream oatmeal!! DELICIOUS!!!!!  I'm cooking another batch now for my morning breakfast.

you're right when you say this is the way oatmeal is suppose to be! I love it! I even love the sticky parts. My moms always used to stick to her pots when she made oatmeal and it was my favorite part! YUM!

This was pretty good. I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and a few tablespoons of butter to keep it from sticking. It did still stick on the bottom but most of it was ok. Maybe if it was cooked for a shorter period of time that would have helped. It was still a nice treat to wake up to in the morning.

I've made this a few times, and have found that 1cup of steel cut oats, 2cups of water and 2 cups of milk and 1tablespoon of butter makes a wonderful, creamy oatmeal.  Then just add whatever you want in the morning.  Hope this helps!  It is a very good recipe and it is very worth having breakfast all ready when you wake up!

The problem of sticking to the crockpot is easily remedied by spraying the pot with Pam first.  Duh! And to the people who insist on putting butter into the oatmeal (not in the recipe) I ask, would you put butter into a bowl of Cheerios?  It's cereal, not a casserole or side-dish.  I really like cinnamon in my oatmeal and it is actually a very good additive to help with arthritis pain relief and really boosts the taste of the oatmeal.  This is a good basic recipe.

I took others advice, and used much more liquid.  I used 2 cups old fash oats, 4 cups water, 3 cups milk, a little salt, 3 tbsp of butter, set on low for 8 hrs.  Although there was no waste, I found it to be a little mushy so I then stirred in 3/4 cup quick oats and let sit for about 20 min. It really gave it the texture that I was looking for... I left out the br sugar.  When I served it, I topped the bowl with cinn, sugar, dried cranberries, a touch more butter and walnuts ~ YUM!  Can't wait to serve it for Christmas am!

I used my SMALL crock pot.  I added the old fashioned oats, water & some cinnamon  & left it on low for 8 hours.  Gave it a stir, added about 1/4-1/3 cup 1% milk and 8 packets of sweet n low.  This is also a good time to add any fruit or nuts, if you like.  THEN, I added in one packet of single serve oats to get the right consistency.  I put the lid back on, popped the toast in the toaster, prepared my mug of coffee and the oats were perfect!  The addition of that little packet of oats made all the difference!  I'll be making this often!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

My oatmeal turned out AWESOME!  I do have to point out that the recipe really works best with steel cut oats and a crock pot that has a "warm" setting. Even low is too hot and causes the crusted on mess. I also advise using a crock pot liner, I always use on whenever I fire up the slow cooker, I hate scrubbing it! I omitted the salt, and used skim milk and added brown sugar/fruit/add ins after it was done.

After reading some reviews, I heeded the advice of Gill-G.  She suggested 2c oats, 2c milk & 2c water.  I also cooked it on the "warm" setting.  The result was perfect, creamy oatmeal & no burnt edges.

10 stars.  So convenient to cook this overnight and have it ready in the morning.  Eat by itself or add fruits and nuts before serving.  Caution, it will stick to the crock,  spray with Pam or better still use a liner.

I too had to play with this recipe. The first time I made it, it stuck to the sides of the cooker and was too thick. It must depend a on the type of cooker you have.  What works for me is 4 cups of water (or 2 cups milk and 2 cups water), 2 cups of oatmeal.  Cook on "keep warm" for 8-10 hours.  

Sometimes I add raisins, cinnamon and brown sugar.

I use only groats (the hull taken off the whole oat) and not the steelcut.  I put it only in a 1 1/2 qt.
slow cooker.  The water will be 3/4 the way up the side.  It comes out very soft and lovely.  If you don't have it between 1/2 and 3/4 full (in case you are using a larger crock pot) it won't cook correctly and you will be disappointed.

I should have heeded previous reviewers' advice and not attempted this, but it's so tempting to have piping hot non-instant oatmeal ready for you first thing in the morning. I tried.  No luck.  It's just as many other reviewers stated.  A gluey gloppy mess, accompanied by crusty stuck to the side *burnt* oatmeal (and I sprayed the heck out of the crock pot w/PAM before I loaded it).  Don't waste your oatmeal (or your time cleaning the crock pot!).

To those of you who are going to try the recipe - please be aware that time and consistency a great deal depends on the temperature that YOUR slow cooker is working at on different settings. 

I sprayed the inside of my non-programmable 4 QT slow cooker with olive oil, and put in 2 cups of old-fashioned oatmeal and 8 cups of water. Dropped in little piece of butter, set my slow cooker on "Keep warm" setting and went to bed about 11 PM. I woke up at 6 AM, checked the slow cooker, and was not happy with the consistency - it seemed watery. I stirred the oatmeal, and I switched the setting to "High". After 1 hour on high setting I stir in some low-fat milk. 

The oatmeal that you get will be very soft and creamy - but I like it that way. I put only three stars, because there should be a note in the recipe itself that you need to try the recipe a couple of times to do it right. I would think that those with programmable slow cookers could set it on 3 hours high, or 5 hours low, and then it would switch to the warm setting automatically. My slow cooker is not programmable, and I can either have it on HIGH for, say, 1.5 hours in the evening and then switch it to "Keep warm", or try longer cooking time - not 7 hours, but 10 on "Keep warm" setting.

I used a liner, and added fresh cut strawberries. I didn't need the salt. It was the most delicious oatmeal recipe I have ever eaten!! Thank you so very much for making my mornings brighter.

This was a great way to make oatmeal. I was unsure about making it beacause of all the people who had problems but mine turned out great. I used my Little Dipper since I only had rolled oats and not steel cut.  I put a liner in, added a half cup of oats and one and a half cups of water and let it cook overnight.  11 pm to about 9 am.  When I lefted the top the oatmeal was creamy soft and wonderful. I will make this again and again for mornings during the week when I am running out the door for work.

This oatmeal reminded me of the oatmeal my Grandmother used to make after I scraped it off the bottom and sides of the pot.  Cooking it over night was way too long.  The oatmeal clumped and stuck to the sides and bottom, so the next time I prepared it, I sprayed the pot with PAM, cooked it in a slow cooker for 1 hr. 15 mins on high.  Stirring every 20 minutes.  Added 1 cup of 2% milk instead of half and half, 1 tsp. sugar and 1/4 tsp. salt and cooked on low for another 20 minutes.  Let cool.  Divided it into individual bowls, put it in the frig and heated it in the microwave the next four mornings.  Excellent oatmeal!

I made this in a little bitty 2 quart crock pot and upped the recipe a bit so that the crock pot would be a little over half full because the crock pot instructions say not to cook less than half a crock of food.  I could imagine having problems making this recipe in a normal sized crock pot without scaling it up substantially!  As it was, my oatmeal was done after 3 hours even though I cooked it on low.  So it was a flop as far as that goes, but the result... The oatmeal was so creamy and delicious, even though I used milk instead of half and half and cinnamon sugar instead of brown!  It was honestly the first bowl of oatmeal that I've truly enjoyed.  The leftovers reheat well too.  I'm going to try making it with ice cubes instead of water to see if that will slow down the cooking process enough that it will actually take the entire night to cook.

Stars for being good, brief and helpful. I tried this with hulled barley, and had an excellent result, as well. A cup and a half of hulled barley, a sliced up apple, a handful of raisins, a bit of butter, and four cups of water.  Cooked on low. In the morning we stirred it up to mix the goodies, served with a bit of milk and sugar, as desired.  Very tasty and satisfying.

I made it in my one quart size crock pot, exactly as WIRSCH suggested, on the warm setting.  She is spot on!  I stirred it, added some dried cranberries and brown sugar and gobbled it up!  I was halfway through the bowl before I realized I hadn't put any milk on top -- and I didn't care! Next time I'll put the cranberries in with the oatmeal, and maybe some chopped apples and cinnamon, or top it with some chocolate chips!  This came out nice and creamy, and it was cooked exactly right! I am frankly tired of the hype about steel cut oats, I don't like them as much as regular oatmeal, but I kept reading that that was the only kind you could use for slow cooker oatmeal.  Well, the powers that be were dead wrong about that, and I'll never go back!

Well, it WAS creamy. My husband frequently has to be at work at 6 am, after I've had to work until 10pm the night before, so we liked the idea of using the crock pot. Although after reading so many problems concerning the crock pots, we decided you all were using pots that are too large. We cooked ours in a 1-1/2 qt. crock pot, following the recipe. We weren't happy with the texture. Maybe next time, we'll use a little less water overnight, then add a little more cream in the morning. We really like the idea of it so we're not going to give up on it.

It didn't burn, that was the first thing I looked for when I came downstairs to have my oatmeal soI thought GREAT! I did put Pam on the 1 quart cooker. I used 2 cups water, 1 c milk, pinch salt and 1/2 apple~~no brown sugar. It was too gummy. I did use regular oatmeal not steel cut oats; however the original recipe doesn't specify steel cut oats either. I won't be making this one again. The concept is great as who wouldn't want to come out to the kitchen and have breakfast all ready. Anyone know of a non-mush way to do this? I consider the "creamy" term "gummy".

Okay, this is a great idea and my kids love it, but I've made a few modifications that make it "really good." First of all, I use 1 cup of old-fashioned rolled oats and 1 cup of steel-cut oats. I use 8 cups of water. Peel two apples (I used Braeburn) and add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and about 4 teaspoons of butter. (The first time I made it, I melted the butter and swirled it around the crockpot to help with the sticking everyone mentioned -- and it didn't stick. But, the second time I made it, I just added it in with everything and it STILL didn't stick.) I think my crockpot runs really hot, even on low, because it was done after 4-5 hours (and was overcooked/mushy/gluey the first time when I cooked it 8 hours). My kids absolutely LOVE this and I'm so glad I found something healthy to prepare for breakfast that doesn't require a lot of work in the morning!

Four stars because it's an interesting use of the crock pot! I don't know if it's a factor of my crock pot's temperature or the kind of oatmeal I used (old-fashioned, not quick or instant) but we had none of the problems described by other reviewers. This recipe made enough for 3 people to eat for breakfast. We left out the half and half. It was very smooshy, almost lost its chewiness, which seems to have been traded in for the "creaminess" (so it loses a star). My daughter loved it, with enough sugar and maple syrup. I would make and eat this again, because it's nice to wake up to hot cereal (the slow cooker factor!).

Ok so i read all the reviews before making this and really wasn't actually convinced it would turn out ok but hubby was away and the kids wanted oatmeal!!

Wow it was fabulous!!! super super easy and turned out great, i made a few adjustments as recommended and cooked it in a large (ish) slow cooker that was at least 2/3's full.

I used 1 cup or old fashioned oats
       2 cups water
       2 cups milk (2%)
       2 tbsp butter
       1 tbsp cinnammon

I sprayed with butter first, popped everything into the slow cooker and left overnight, I cooked on low for 4 1/2 hrs and then my cooker automatically switched to warm until we got up the mext morning.

I gave it a quick stir and added 2 tbsp of sugar and 1 more cup of oats, mixed it all up and the kids loved it!

I had no problems with anything sticking to the sides or bottom :)

I will definately be making this again, i think i'll either reduce the liquids a little or add more oats at the start to get the perfect consistancy (but adding an extra cup of oats in the morning was really no problem).

This is a nice easy recipe good for busy mornings.  I bought one of the new crockpots about a year ago.  It tends to run hotter than I'd like, so I cook this recipe on the warm (not low) setting.  When I tried it on low, it came out too mushy.  If you like your oatmeal on the thick side, try using only 2 cups of water.

The recipe probably should state "steel cut oats."  There are some bad reviews but it appears they did not use steel cut, and I can see how anything else would result in a big mushy mess.  I forgot to put these on last night, so I put them on at about 3am on high, and after a few hours I turned them down to low.  The flavor is amazing!  I used half water and half half&half.

Followed recipe as written. Used tiny crock pot, turned on warm overnight as suggested by others. Used old fashioned oats, and they all had dissolved. Yes, creamy, but no oatmeal texture. Made it on the stovetop. Much better.

Mine turned out beautifully. Instead of 1/2 and 1/2, I used low fat milk (for less fat) and some flavored kefir for more flavor and added creaminess. My picky boys ate big bowls--the first time ever w/o prodding!

I really didn't care for this recipe.  I was so excited to find one that you make the night before and wake up to a healthy, flavorful breakfast, however, I didn't find that with this recipe.  Yes, it is definitely creamy, even two days later, but the flavor was lacking.  I found it very bland and too creamy.  The texture of the oats is completely lost in the slow cooking process.  I think I could have gotten past the texture if it had more flavor.  Even after adding what I consider a lot of brown sugar, it was still lacking.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

Spray cooker with cooking spray before putting ingredients in and no problem. Can add any dried or fresh fruits to it. I like raisins added just before serving but some like them soft.Experiment with spices too or add canned pumpkin.

This was really easy!  You HAVE to have your crockpot at least 2/3 full, otherwise it will burn and dry out.  So I tripled the recipe, and it served 6 people comfortably.  People really liked this!  It was REALLY creamy, and I used old-fashioned oats.  Next time I'll try steel cut to add some texture.  This is a great breakfast to prepare if people are getting up at all different times in the morning!

I added apples and cinnemon/sugar too so it was ready to eat in the morning.  Yummy!  Almost like pudding!  I could see putting it on top of ice cream even!

Following others' helpful advice, I used about 1 1/2 c oats w/ about 3 1/2 cups of water and cooked on "keep warm" overnight...it was perfectly smooth and creamy! We added baked apples, cinammon and brown sugar when done.

This was fantastic!  I threw the oats and water into the slow cooker when I got up on Christmas morning, and cooked them on high for 3 hours, until everyone arrived.  Then I added the salt and cream, stirred, and served.  I let everyone add the amount of brown sugar or fruit that they wanted.  This was hearty and thick, and so creamy!  Yum!

Made the recipe as is and it is a win win!  Breakfast is ready when we get up, everyone can add their favorites, whether that is fruit, more brown sugar or syrup and clean-up is easy.  Loved the thick and creamy results.  I used Steel Cut Oates, better for healthier eating.  Also sprayed the crock with no-stick spray for easier clean-up.  i have made it other times with 1c. heavy cream instead of 1/2 & 1/2 but can not say it was any better.  Thank you to KARENSFIXINS!

I loved this easy oatmeal recipe!  It tastes so much better than the usual way.  I used gluten free oatmeal, and had no problems with sticking.  Love it topped with fresh fruit!

I think next time I'll use a little less water and  add some vanilla, and another time cinnamon and apple!
Thanks for this yummy breakfast!

maybe it's just me - but i thought it came out like gruel. i followed the directions and it came out like paste - and i do not like that texture. the flavor was also lacking. i may play with it and see if setting on warm rather than low would help to not over cook it - any suggestions?

I followed the other reviewers' advice and cut the water back to 2 1/4 cups.  It really is creamy and delicious, especially when you add a packet of Splenda and some cinnamon to the bowl.

Family Loved the recipe! I made it a few survings more then stated and filled the slow cooker. Variation: (1)I added cinnamon and chopped apples (2) Didn't add the half and half, just milk to taste. My son (1.5 yrs) loved it.

I finally have a good way to cook my steel cut oats without getting up early and waiting an hour. The pyrex dish inside the crock pot trick works very well, keeping the oats moist and the dishes residue-free.

The first time I tried to make this, it turned into a gooey, gummy mess.  Then I realized I have one of the new crockpots which in my opinion cook way to hot and ruin food.  So the next night, I tried again and set the crockpot to the warm setting.  Perfect!  Very handy for busy mornings.

I have never made crock pot oatmeal before and I was given steel cut oats to try. This recipe turned out so good that my 8 year old is requesting oatmeal again! I added a little bit of cinnamon and some dried apple to the mix and let it cook over night. Instead of using half and half cream, we used non-fat milk and it still turned out yummy!

I'll have to try again. I used my mini crock pot as suggested and added raisins - again as suggested by another reviewer. What a mess! Turned purple and tasted like raisin mush. I must have not had the proportions of liquid to oatmeal correct either. The sugar cooked out of the raisins and formed a crust, a purple crust, on top. Was rather bizarre. I will try again though because I do enjoy a hot bowl of oatmeal on a cold morning but don't want to wait for it to cook.

Coach's oatmeal is the best we have found for this. At least an hour at the porridge setting in a Sanyo rice maker. The titanium coated bowl makes clean up a snap---just let the remaining oatmeal dry out and it peals right off.

I made this last Christmas eve for breakfast at my daughter's house.  It was such a hit I'm taking it again this year.

absoutely lovely.  Used steel cut oat so I followed advice of others and directions on container and used 4 c water to 1 c oats.  Thanks to several of you easy clean up because I used a crock pot liner.  It was creamy, but still had a slight chewiness.  Cooked to perfection overnight.  So nice to wake up and have it be all ready for me.

I have tried this with several different fruits. Its a good recipe. I have the problem of the oats sticking on the sides. My husband wakes up first, so he has been adding more oats upon waking, so they will be ready when we eat breakfast. I've tried several things to avoid the sticking. None have worked yet.

Great taste and super creamy. The basics of this recipe are good but the execution needed lots of adjustment based on your individual crock pot. I used 1 c. steel cut oats, 4 cups water, 1 c. cream. Sprayed my crock pot with Pam and poured the 3 ingredients in, gave it a stir, set it on low, and let it cook for 4 hours. I checked it at 4 hours and to my surprise, it was done. Thick and creamy. A little stuck to the sides but not too much. I turned off the pot and let it sit over night. Super thick and creamy and all that was stuck on the sides had come off. Just added some milk and put in the microwave for a minute then add your toppings.

I added butter and more water and it turned out terrible.  90% of it was burned to the sides and the rest was a watery mess.  I am so sad.  I had such high hopes for this one.

I definitely didn't realize what a difference it would make to cook the oatmeal overnight. It was much creamier and had a great flavor. Not to mention how great it was to wake up to breakfast. I just had to give it a quick stir to mix it all together. I do think I will use a crock pot liner next time. My crock pot runs a little warm, so by the time I woke up some of the oatmeal had burned and was stuck to the crock pot. It made a lot, so I still had plenty left over.

I was VERY disappointed with this recipe.  I did as the recipe instructed, and in the morning had stuck oatmeal on the sides of the pot and a watery MESS in the center.  Don't know if anyone else had this happen, but will NOT make this again.!!!!!!

I really wanted this to work but didn't have great success.  The recipe doesn't specify the type of oatmeal and I think that is the problem.  I used quick cooking, put it in my small (dip sized crock)on warm for about 7 hours.  I used milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and added a couple of tablespoons of butter. (I found that combination in a similar recipe from a slow cooker cooking site) Mine didn't stick to the crock but the texture was way too mushy for our tastes (tapioca like).  I might try it again using regular oatmeal to see if I had better luck. It would be great to wake up on a school morning to a hot breakfast ready to go.

I don't usually make my oatmeal with milk (milk products). In the morning I had a sloshy-sour mess. I almost tossed the pot, what didn't cook burnt to the sides.

I really wanted this to work. Unfortunately, this was a disaster in our crockpot. Most of it was stuck to the sides and the middle was sort of a runny mess. Maybe this recipe is entirely dependent on your crockpot. I guess I'll go back to baked oatmeal.

I used fat free half & half and that could be partly the reason that my oatmeal had little flavor and a soggy texture, like it wasn't really cooked.  I put my slow cooker on warm all night as suggested.  I'm going to try this again on the low setting next time just because the oatmeal was expensive and hard to find.  I don't want to waste it. I am really disappointed with this recipe.

Awful, awful, awful.  My kids love oatmeal, so I was very excited when I found this recipe.  Anything to make hectic morning less hectic, right?  I was very disappointed this morning when I lifted the lid of my slow cooker, only to find half of the oatmeal crusted onto the sides & bottom, and the other half a soupy mess.  My son looked in and said, "Mommy, where are the oats?"  I'll stick to making oatmeal the regular way.

I probably did this wrong though I followed the recipe exactly, because I ended up with a load of crusty...stuff stuck to the side of my slow cooker and  mass of gelatinous goop under it all. I may try it again, but not for eight hours.

This was good, but some of the oatmeal settled to the bottom and and stuck there.  I'll continue to check back to see if anyone has any recommendations to avoid that.

I used a one quart crockpot and followed the recipe with one modification (butter) and it turned out very watery and plain; I added another cup of oats and two tablespoons of cinnamon. I also put all of the ingredients in at the same time with two tablespoons of vanilla

Made it as written w/half steel cut and half reg. oatmeal. As recommended by another reviewer,I used a water bath in the crock pot on low for about 8 hours and that worked great - no sticking at all. However, the texture was completely off-putting. Apparently, neither I or my husband like oatmeal that has a tapioca-like texture. It was almost slimey.

I cook this on "WARM" not LOW.  Low burns it in my cooker.

Variation:

no sugar or salt
add peanut butter last half hour of cooking, and turn to "LOW".
Also, It's real good with evaporated milk.

Way too much liquid!  it was so soupy and mushy.  I thought it seemed like a lot (especially since the back of the oatmeal container called for less than HALF the amount of water the recipe called for).  I only put in 2cups of water and it was still a soupy mess.  It tasted great, and i will make it again, but with MUCH LESS WATER.

The flavor of this wasn't bad, but the texture was strange to me.  It was very soupy, and nearly all the oats had been turned to mush.  Sorry, I will not be making this again.

I liked this but have made a few additions of my own.  Add tapioca, it smooths out the pastiness of oatmeal.  Instead of cream I used water and added powdered milk.  It is great with added peaches or apples and a touch of cinnamon

Hi, I just finished eating this oatmeal for brekfast.  It was very creamy and delicious.  This is what I did.   I used one cup of oatmeal, two cups of water and a half cup of milk.  As well I threw in 1/4 cup of raisins and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I started it on warm and went to bed around eleven.  Halfway threw the night I checked on it and found it was sticking to the sides so I added another cup and a half of water turned it to high and went back to bed.  Around seven I turned it to off and stirred it a little then went back to bbed till nine.   My husband and I both thought it was very creamy and I love waking up to our usual Sunday breakfast already cooked.  Thanks for the great idea.

This just did not come out the way I was hoping.  It was pretty gluey and not tasty at all.  Not even after adding the brown sugar (EXTRA brown sugar) and cream.  I think I'll stick to cooking it on the stove from now on.

This isn't what I thought I guess. I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Oatmeal and 3.5cups of water in a 1.5lt crock overnight on low. Still had a soupy consistancy after 9 hours. Nothing I could add cream too since it would have been way too liquidy. My 7 y.o picky eater liked it with butter and brown sugar added, my husband just liked having a hot bfast ready for him at 6am so he ate it without issue. My 5y.o wouldn't touch it. Taste was fine but consistnacy was  ??? I'll need to tweak this more because a different recipe wouldn't make sense since its just water and oatmeal overnight. Less water at the beginning I would think if using the g/f oatmeal.

I was a little nervous about this after reading some of the reviews but...It was great!  I sprayed the crockpot with Pam and used 2 cups milk and 1.5 cups water (used milk to make it little richer I didin't have half & half)with the 1 cup oats (only had quick oats) chopped up an apple and about 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Went to bed and 7 hrs. later had a great hot breakfast for 4 boys who all leave for school at different times. Poured some milk on top with brown sugar.  They loved it~Thanks for a great recipe!

Definitely use steel cut oats and 4 cups of water. To keep it from sticking to the crock pot use a crock pot liner (they are like oven bags but made for the crock pot, you can find them at walmart near the ziploc bags).  I add cinnamon and a peeled and diced apple to mine and in the morning brown sugar and milk on top into individual servings. It's really nice to have hot oatmeal without the hassel, especially steel cut oats.

My kids love this, even the one who hates oatmeal.  We use steel cut oats and 4 cups of water instead of 3.  It comes out perfectly.  I do wish I could stop it from sticking to the sides though.

Delicious, creamy, and easy! I eat this for breakfast at least once or twice a week. Rather than use half and half, I use about two tablespoons of real maple syrup and 2/3 cup of brown sugar, added in the morning, to make homemade maple-brown sugar oatmeal. Of course, I like my oatmeal sweet. It's easy enough to add/subtract the sugar and syrup to your taste! A thousand times better than Quaker!

I cooked it on the warm setting overnight. In the morning I added golden raisins and chopped apples. I cranked it up to high for about 30 minutes and voila, really awesome oatmeal.

I love how this turned out! I added 2 cups of water and 2 cups of low fat milk to 1 cup of Quaker oats. I then chopped up some green apples, threw in some raisins and added a tsp of cinnamon. I cooked it in the crockpot overnight on the low setting and in the morning I threw in 1/4 cup brown sugar, bananas and some honey. Yum!!! There was some burnt oatmeal on the sides but nothing was crispy or bad tasting.

If you like oatmeal that's not quite as creamy as this, use whole oats and 1/2 cup more water. It perfect!!! After 10 hours on low, it still has some nuttiness! Try it!

I made this last night. After reading all the reviews, I added 2 Tbsp butter and made a 1-1/2 batch, hoping to avoid the sticking! No such luck. The oatmeal was okay, but I had to use a lot of elbow grease to clean my crockpot! Also, I didn't add the 1/2&1/2 as it was extremely creamy on its own.

Well...the reviews prompted me to cook this for 4hrs and on "warm" for another 4.  It was still a bit too 'goopey' [?]- "Please, sir, may I have some more?"  We will try this again with different times and maybe some apples and cinnamon.

Very good, I made a batch over the weekend.  It lasted me all week long.  I place it in the microwave every morning with a pat of Margarine and a Tsp of Brown Sugar.  After it is warmed up I add 1/2 of an apple.  I am trying it with 1/2 peach next week

I have no idea what I did wrong with this one. It was slimy and soupy. It could have very easily been my error just not sure what I did wrong. I have had great with all the other recipes I have tried from here. If anyone has any suggestions I am open to try it again.

Because Oat meal cooks so fast I did not make it with oat meal.  Red river cearel needs a long slow cook.  And this methed of cooking is great for it. And I also add a little more water. And some spices like cinnamon.

It's so easy!  I'm not a morning person, so I love a breakfast recipe that I can do the night before.  It's a great base recipe -- you can add whatever you like.  I added cinamon, turbinado and raisins.  It does stick around the edge of the crock pot.  Since my inside comes out for washing that's not a deal breaker for me.  I suppose you could grease the side a little bit if it's a problem.

I grease up my crockpot with butter and don't have a problem with it sticking. I have made this several times now and really like it.. I didn't have half and half last time and I used milk and it was just as good. I also add cinnamon & fresh nutmeg.. It is nice to wake up to a hot breakfast..

This oatmeal really was creamy like tapioca! I used a 4 quart crockpot with a liner. I used old fashioned oats and three cups of liquid (half fat free milk & half water). I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla. I turned the crockpot on low at 11pm. I woke up during the night and switched the crockpot from low to keep warm because I was paranoid it would burn. At 7am the oatmeal was very creamy! It wasn't hot so we had to heat it a bit in the microwave. Maybe next time I will leave on low all night. I added a tsp of brown sugar and a splash of sweet cream flavored coffee creamer to my bowl and it was delicious!!!

This recipe is a staple in my house... perfect for those days when we need to get out the door early. The texture is creamy and the taste is perfect. We have tried any number of add-ins including: raisins, apples, cinnamon, and berries. I will never go back to fixing oatmeal the old way.

When I woke in the morning my oatmeal was a big pot of burnt mush . . . would not recommend doing this recipe the way it is stated. My oatmeal went in the garbage and I then had to make it the old fashion way.  Other reviews recommend using a different method to cook it and it seemed to work great for them.

Well I loved the idea of this recipe. But it didn't work out for me at all. My oatmeal was a gushy mushy mess in the morning. I only cooked it for 6 hours. But it could be my crockpot cooks a little hotter. I don't think I'll make this again. Sorry

Oatmeal takes minutes on the stovetop or microwave so why would you use a slow cooker? Because I have to make 10-20 cups at a time.  This recipe was incredibly helpful and saved me time.

Leave out the half and half or milk until you are ready to serve,  if adding dried fruit you can add it before. I made this 3 times now and I found I had to cook on low for 2 hours and have it stay on warm, other wise it will burn.  This is your plain jane recipe  so add what you like. Once I added diced apples and lots of cinnamon for apple pie oat meal. Another time I added Craisins and maple syrup.

Not a fan, I used 4 cups of water to 1 cup of oats.  The entire oatmeal had hardened on the sides on top, maybe my slow cooker runs hot.  I'll give another shot with some tips from other reviewers about using a separate container in the slow cooker itself.

5 stars for it turning out like the recipe instructed, 2 stars for my personal taste.  Looked and tasted like wallpaper paste.  Threw it away and cooked it the old fashioned way.  I should have known  better.  You can't cook oatmeal for 7 hours and expect different results.

Waking up to a hot breakfast on a cold. Morning is great! I played with the recipe. I sprayed the slow cooker with non stick spray and this worked.  The best ratio is 1 cup of steel cut oats to 4 cups liquid. I used 2 cups milk and 2 cups water. I set it on low and the timer for 6 hours.  My slow cooker keeps it warm after that.  This results in a lumpy oatmeal, which is my favorite. If you like creamier texture, put the oats and liquid in at dinner time and let it sit cold. Turn it on at bedtime.  I added brown sugar and maple syrup at bedtime  for extra flavor.

Turned out to be a liquid mess. Not recognizable as oatmeal in any form.
I will not make it again.

Made this work a work potluck a few weeks ago.  Turned out alright, but had to add a few extra ingredients to kick it up a notch. Added some dried blueberries and cranberries.  Also used a slow cooker liner.  Super easy cleanup!

Only takes about 5 hours in my little slow cooker with only one heat setting, so I plug it in when I get up in the middle of the night. Otherwise it gets too done around the edges. Very good breakfast food!

I used 3 cups of almond milk for the water and coconut  brown sugar to replace sugar and 2 tbs maple syrup for sweetness. cooked on low for 7 to 7 1/2 hrs. My husband loved these !! he didn't want fruit in his oatmeal the way I do so this is perfect to have done for him, and I can have mine and both happy!

Made in mini crockpot this a.m using regular oats (not steel cut) Left out the half and half  and added chopped peeled apple, fresh craisins.  When finished I sprinkled a few chopped walnuts to top it off.  Only took 3 1/2 hrs. Perfect.  Will never make on stove top again.
Yummy and great on cold winter morning in burbs of Chicago.

It was too soupy for my liking but it was nice to have warm oatmeal ready. I probably won't make it again following the recipe exactly.

It was awesome to wake up to this. I lined with parchment paper to avoid sticking  as described in reviews. Worked great. My add-inns were apples, some molasses . We each topped with our choice of : chia seeds raisins or almonds , butter or half and half. Will make again :)

I personally didn't like the texture of the oatmeal, too slimy.  However my husband seemed to like it.  I think it depends on everyone's personal taste and texture of oatmeal.

I did not care for this recipe. My 3 year old granddaughter who loves oatmeal and eats up to 3 bowls at a sitting wouldn't even eat it.  It was like a bowl of glue. No flavor.  I used the recipe like reviews said in a separate casserole dish in the crock pot with the original recipe.

Yummy and easy. What more can you ask for. I used the Splenda brand brown sugar with good results.Even had some left and took it to work to share for breakfast with the gang...they loved it.
