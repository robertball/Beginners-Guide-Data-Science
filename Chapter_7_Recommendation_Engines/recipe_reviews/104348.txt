Very good. I used Smirnoff citrus vodka, as that was all I had on hand. I also used fresh squeezed orange juice. Just like a creamsicle, only all grown up. Delicious. NOTE: I shop mostly at Fred Meyer/Kroger and they also carry their own brand of fat free half-n-half.

Before I could decide whether or not I liked this, it was gone!  And that happened quickly.  Guess that speaks volumes.  Can't say that this tastes like a Creamsicle, but  it was good.  At first it tasted a bit "boozy" to me but after the first few sips that wasn't an issue.  I guess you get used to it.  It's creamy and smooth, and just a little orange-y. I think if I have this again I'd have Hubs do something to make it even orangier.  He used regular half-and-half but beyond that, stuck to the recipe as written - equal parts of all ingredients.  He even liked it, and he's strictly a classic gin martini kinda guy!

Land O' Lakes makes the fat-free half and half in this recipe but I'm not sure if it's available everywhere. If you can't find the fat-free version, it's also just as good with regular half and half or cream, just more calories.   Also, I would suggest this drink not be made in batches.  The cream will separate a bit and make it less visually appealing after it's been sitting for awhile.  Best to make them as you're drinking them even if you're serving more than one. Also, you can double the orange juice for more of a cocktail and less of a martini if you want to go a little lighter on the alcohol. Lastly, I almost always use Simply Orange or fresh squeezed orange juice for this recipe.  It really does make a difference in the flavor vs. a reconstituted O.J. Hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as I have.  :D

Very refreshing.  The only change I made was to add extra orange juice. I thought it did taste somewhat like a creamsicle.

I made this last night using vanilla vodka.  My DH and I thought they were very good and we would make them again.

It was thick with the cream, but it really did taste like a creamsicle.  I could only drink one because of the richness, but the flavor was right.

Great recipe.   We used three times vodka (skinny girl citrus), juice of four oranges and a slash of heavy cream and a dribble of triple sec. So we actually reinvented the recipe. Good nonetheless we loved it and hopefully you can read this message! Love it !

I was excited to make a batch of this for a girls' night... Unfortunately none of us thought it tasted like a creamsicle, and we ended up not drinking most of it...

These were good, but I thought needed a little more orange flavor.  Doubled the orange juice and it was great for my taste.   Thanks!

I started making this 25 years ago. At the time, bartenders didn't know how to make it. It is simply a Harvey Wallbanger with "heavy" cream and Sunny Delight. Be careful, this is one drink that will sneak up on you!
