Awesome! I crumbled the Fritos as suggested, so it wasn't soggy. It was defitiley a different way to prepare a burger. Interesting blend of flavors.

My mom used to make this recipe when we were growing up also.   I love it.   I do alter it a little bit though.   I add green olives and slowly simmmer the burgers with the tomato sauce.    Delicious!

Mistake in "Ingredients": So sorry, I accidentally wrote "browned ground beef" in the ingredients section. The patties are to be formed with "raw" ground beef and cornchips---not browned.

I added onions into the meat mixture. The texture was nice.. and I liked the flavor. I served this on homemade rolls.
