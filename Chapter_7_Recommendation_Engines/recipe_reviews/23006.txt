I was nervous making these b/c there is a pricy restaurant we visit every blue moon that makes honey butter popovers...and its the only ones we like.  I wanted to duplicate them but was worried if this recipe would be "the one."  These turned out great! They were hollow, light and fluffy.  I made some honey butter from this site, melted a few TBLS of it and brushed it over the hot popovers.  Yeah!! I am very pleased with the result and would make these again! Be sure to grease the muffin pans well! Thanks Christine!

I've struggled to make just right popovers for years.  I had finally given up, until I found this recipe.  Turned out beautifully!  I like to make the batter in the blender, making it very easy to pour into the muffin cups (but be careful not to overmix).  And it's easily scalable to 4 or 8 popovers.

I've been making popovers for over 20 years and this is one of the best recipes.  I really prefer the cold oven recipes over the other.  One thing you just MUST remember about baking popovers:  NEVER use the paper liners.  The batter must be able to rise up the sides of the muffin cup.  A paper liner hinders this.  Thanks for this recipe.

If you want what is essentially a pancake in a muffin cup then this recipe is for you.  Otherwise, forget it.  This recipe WILL NOT give you popovers.  More like poopovers.

You can't get any easier than this!!! What a great recipe. These popovers were nice and tall and the flavor was perfect. I did check them at 25 minutes and they were done. Thanks for the easiest popover recipe ever!

very delicious! Only thing was that they stuck to the muffin liners and they were done at 25 minutes.  Made a cinnamon sugar butter spread for them.

30 minutes is way too long.  My husband really liked them even though they were crunchy.  I will try again and cook for 20 minutes.

I used this recipe and it was perfect and easy to do. I fill mine with a cream puff type filling of vanilla pudding with whipped cream folded in, fill popovers and dust with powdered sugar

These were great!  I scaled the recipe down by 1/3 to make 4 popovers.  There were still a lot of lumps in my batter because I was trying really hard not to overmix it, and it turned out beautifully.  I knew I shouldn't open the oven before the 30 minutes was up because I didn't want them to fall, but I couldn't resist.  I gave in and opened the oven to find beautifully golden brown popovers 7 minutes early.  Two of them were hollow and puffed up beautifull while the other two were lopsided and still had a bready bottom.  I filled the two hollow ones with a small scoop of ice cream (it fit perfectly!) and put them into the freezer for dessert.  The other two, less pretty ones, were eaten right away.  I may try to add a little sugar to the batter next time - just a personal preference.

Mmmm, just like my mom used to make. I didn't realize how easy these are. My only tip is be sure to grease the pan (like everyone says). I used a cooking spray and still had to go around them with a knife to get them out of the pan. I think actually greasing the pan the old fashion way (rubbing the cups with butter) would have worked better. Will be making these again and again.

I made these last night and they turned out great.  I have a convection oven so I baked them at 425 for 20 minutes with the convection fan on.  They were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I am very happy with how they turned out.

Let me say this upfront, I have never eaten a popover.  That being said, i felt like these were a bit flavorless and tasted like an eggy pancake, but with less flavor.  I ended up throwing them away.  They were really cool to tear open, nice and airy on the inside.  I just won't be making them again.

Made this after watching the Yorkshire Pudding Popovers Video from the side bar. Used only 2 eggs,  added 1 Tbs. chopped chives and 1 tsp. Thyme to the batter. Buttered a muffin pan and put 1/4 cup of batter into each of the wells. Baked in PRE-heated oven at 220 C until golden. Made exactly 12 popovers.

These are the easiest things to make ... I've made them twice now, one recipe with the 3 eggs that are called for, and once with just 2 eggs. The 2 egg version turned out much better - they puffed higher, had a better texture, and didn't burn as easily. Also, both batches baked in only 22 minutes. Great recipe

These were okay, but the Joy will always have the best popovers--these were not light and airy enough for my taste.

I added a dash of vanilla extract to the recipe. My Popovers REALLY popped! I turned on the oven light with 5 minutes left, and they were 5 inches out of the pan! I'm glad I peeked, because they would have burned if I left them in even another half a minute. Great with honey butter!

So fluffy and addicting. I definitely recommend creaming some butter and honey to spread on these, as well as adding a bit of vanilla extract to the batter.  Next time, though, I'm going to more thoroughly grease the muffin tin, possibly putting a smidge of butter in the bottom before adding the batter and though they weren't burnt at 30 minutes, they were somewhat overdone so I recommend reducing the time by a few minutes.

This was my first attempt at popovers.  These were very good.  I used a 12 muffin tin but only had enough batter to fill 9 cups three-quarters full.  I sprayed the tin then added a little melted butter to each cup before chilling and baked for 23 minutes.  I served with honey butter. Yum.  Next time I think I'll add some vanilla.  :-)

Surprisingly easy to make, perfect partner to a bisque type soup (mine butternut squash). Was hard to tell when they were done so mine were a little burned but no less well received.

These were very simple to make and delicious.  I thought that popovers would be a lot more difficult, but not with this recipe!

This is a fabulous recipe! I used the hot oven version someone posted earlier ( and thank you, by the way ) So I lightly sprayed my muffin pan with Pam and chilled it, poured in the batter and baked in a preheated 450 degree oven for 20 minutes. Perfect ! Tall and crispy and gorgeous...very impressive. Oh, I also cut the salt back to 1/4 tsp. 
Enjoy !

Excellent!! I loved them. I baked a rib roast, so my oven was hot. Varied the recipe as follows for hot oven...450 degrees for 20 minutes...baked in cold muffin tin lightly greased with butter flavored Pam. I wouldn't heasitate to try in cold oven...perhaps for breakfast treat. Thanks.

These were very fast and easy.  We added a powdered sugar glaze to them and they tasted a lot like doughnuts.  This will definitely become a family favorite.

These are so easy to make and so good! Perfect warm with melted butter with a main dish, or with cinnamon and sugar or honey as a dessert. Next time, I will consider adding some flavoring. Wonderful! A terrific change of pace. I don't know why more people don't try these!

I tried a more complicated recipe first and got perfect results with this one!  No adjustments needed. one note, I tried using evaporated canned milk in another attempt and it was a fail. Regular milk is a must. I used whole the next time yum!

This is a super easy, basic popover recipe.  I made it for the first time tonight as a test and they came out as described.  I lrft them in for 25 minutes and pulled them out.  They are not the hollow kind but rather quite full so fyi.  I'm going to try and add some cheese or something next time to give them a bit of a different taste but all in all...these rock.

I made two batches about an hour apart, so the oven didn't have time to cool completely between. The second batch puffed up much better, and I think it was because the oven was already kind of warm. The taste was great, though much better hot than once they cooled off.

These tasted great!  I threw in a little garlic butter just to give it some umph.  Very basic/plain as is.  I noticed all of the recipes are, so I don't count off for that.  I think I would just prefer them to puff up a little more.

They hardly rose at all, and I followed the directions precisely. They had no hollow middle; it was just a big, somewhat fluffy, tasteless muffin (with a crispy outside). :( Guess I'll keep looking.

Not as puffy as traditionally made popovers, but this is SO much easier than those traditional popovers. This is something that can be made with any dinner. And attention dieters! You can have a roll with dinner that's not dense and hi cal with these popovers!

I made these for breakfast and could not get over the 5-minute prep time.  Wow!  I think I cooked them a little too long - they stuck in the pan and I had to sacrifice the bottom.  My boyfriend didn't like them, but he ate them plain.  I had them with raspberry preserves, and popped leftovers in the oven for breakfast the following day.  Delicious.

Hmmm...they looked beautiful, rose well, and tasted good, but...The flattened almost immediately unlike another popover recipe I have. And, the outer crust wasn't very crisp as I like. Got a limp, soft consistency right away. No, this isn't the popover recipe I'll be keeping. Sorry!

My 12 yr. old son loves to make these...so easy and almost foolproof! We did have a small "deflation" disaster once, he opened the oven to check on them about halfway thru baking, and they sunk. Still tasted great though! We make them Italian-style, with garlic, basil and black pepper in the batter, and a sprinkle of grated cheese after baking. Molto bene!

These were excellent!  I used Pam to coat my muffin tins.  I made 8 out of this recipe.  I can think of so  many ways to use this recipe.  I served them lastnight with butter to go with vegetarian chili.  Yum!  My husband said it tasted somewhat like yorkshire pudding.  So easy and delicous!  Only 20 minutes though in convection oven.  I may even lower the temp next time to 400 - 425.  Thank you!

These tasted excellent and turned out beautifully. I cut the recipe into 1/3 and it made 3 popovers which was the perfect amount for my boyfriend and I since we had lots of other food to eat with it. I debated on making yorkshire pudding or buns to have with my roast beef dinner but I opted to try these instead. What a great idea. They tasted just like yorkshire pudding but not as greasy, yet they were enough like dinner rolls that we didn't need any extra bread with our meal. I tried spreading butter on top as well as dipping in gravy and they were fabulous both ways. I will definitely make them again!

These popovers were wonderful and easy.  They do not come out real large like a restaurant popover.  They have more breading on the inside rather than being hollow.  Everyone loved them with the honey butter that I whipped up to put on them.  Next time I will try maybe doubling the recipe to see if they come out larger.

Tasted really good, but if you don't have your butter on your knife when they come out of the oven, they are too soggy.  I just don't know how to fix that problem.

These are so easy to make and we enjoyed them with soup. I will make them again, but I won't use cupcake liners. The  pop ups stuck on the bottom and just wouldn't come off.  Easy fix, not a problem! ;-)

I made it and they were great despite me putting 3/4 cup flour instead of 1 cup. They were  probably a little more eggy than usual but delicious nonetheless. Very very easy. Will make again

Great recipe.  I had my doubts about putting them in a cold oven and then turning on the heat  but it works.  After 30 minutes I opened  my oven door to find perfectly formed popovers.

This really is not a fair rating because, it could very well be that the pop over's did not rise because, after I had made them & they did not rise very much at all, I checked the expiration date on my baking powder...it was 2014.  That being said, the popover's were delicious, just a bit dense because they did not rise but a tiny bit.  So, today I threw out the old powder, replacing it with a brand new container & will make them again.  I also made them with GF flour since I would not have been able to eat them had I not.  So, to be continued after I make them again!

Followed the directions exactly and they popped very well.  I had been using a similar recipe, with the comments my popovers came out better than ever.  Will use again

No changes--this recipe is great! I did use custard cups that are larger than cupcake size, which meant that the there were fewer. The sight of them, with their big chefs hat pouf was  amazing to me!  I am planning a couples bridge  get together, and I plan to serve Maryland crab soup with these popovers.I would like to have sent a picture, but they vanished right out of the oven!

Will these work with silicone muffin cups or are the metal muffin tins needed for the cold?

These come out great every time! If you let the milk warm up a little or put it in the microwave for a few seconds to take off the chill, it makes a non lumpy batter, and they are delicious!

I added a little bit of romano cheese- which was a little too strong, next time I'll try regular parmesan. I'm glad I found this recipe!! I LOVE popovers! and have been looking/experimenting for years trying to find a recipe where the popovers actually "pop"!

I found this recipe some years ago and it is a family favorite.  The old recipe didn't suggest chilling the pan - I am lucky enough to own 2 popover pans that I feel really add to the product.  As well the baking time was 25 minutes which is right for me.  As well you sprinkle the popovers with a mixture of 2 tablespoons granulated  sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  I'll try the chilling and the honey butter next time.

Not bad but not great for me.  After 30 minutes in the oven they were dried out and way over done, 23-25 minutes would have probably been ideal.

Perfect!  These were SO easy and so good.  I ate them plain, on their own, for dinner. I used a silicone muffin pan and greased the pan with butter, baked them for 22 minutes, and they were picture perfect.  Great recipe, planning on making them again tomorrow!

An addition: This is my go-to recipie for any meal.  I even like them cold the next day.

Put muffin pan in freezer while making cold batter.  Then put in cold oven and bake at 450 for 27 min.  Don't peek.  I not longer have "pop-unders" but get great pop-overs every time.

Can't go wrong. Super easy, delicious and totally customizable. I like them with plain butter and lots of it, and a hot cup of tea on a Sunday morning. After reading another reviewe about honey butter...I'm gonna have to try that tomorrow! Sounds fabulous.

Easy to make, but I found that the thirty minute cooking time was too long. I greased my muffin pan as recommended, but the popovers came out too brown and were very difficult to remove. They were hollow on the inside, but over-cooked and a bit hard. Any suggestions?

I do not know if I didnt make these correctly, but the batter was extremely thin with large lumps and the popovers came out tasting like baked eggs. Sorry - but I was not a fan.

I didn't follow the original poster's recipe exactly, but even so I'd recommend not using paper liners (they stuck to the popovers like glue).  I added a pinch of sugar and they came out very nice (at least the tops did - LOL).

These deflated within minutes of being taken out of the oven! and they practically shrunk to half their size after deflating.. resulting in very small popovers. I'd say, don't hesitate to fill the popover molds completely full. Can anyone help with that? Should I add baking powder to this recipe? Plus, I added 1/2 tsp sugar for 3 popovers. Insides were like a solidified cooked custard; which was nice, but still seemed a bit bland so I'll try with 1 tsp of sugar next time. Definitely need to add some more to this recipe.

I never had a popover before, so I was a little nervous baking these.  I wasn't sure how the batter was supposed to be, but I just eyeballed it and baked them in 6 ramekins rather than the muffin tins.  They were very good served with jam or the "Cinnamon Honey Butter" that I also got from this site.  I loved how easy they were to whip up!  They are a nice change from your everyday biscut, and I love that they can be served as breakfast, with dinner or as a dessert.  Thanks!

Wow!  What a great recipe!  I like these with jam as a change of pace for breakfast.  I have been making the recipe as 8 larger popovers and they have come out perfectly every time.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!
