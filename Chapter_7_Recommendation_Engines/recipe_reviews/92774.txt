This an insult to any Spaniards...considering I myself am Gallego. This soup come from Galicia which is a region of Spain right next to Portugal. Kale is the staple here not spinach. I suggest finding an authentic recipe.

But I did make this to taste it and it is  very good....it's just NOT caldo gallego by any means.

Sorry, my friend got this recipe while she lived in Puerto Rico, I assumed it was Puerto Rican.  I didnt mean to insult anyone.  I am truly sorry.

I still love the soup!!  I do the broth, onion, ham. chorize, garlic and potatoes the night before.  Put in the fridge and take the grease off the top the next day and add the beans and spinach.  The flavors all infuse together and make it extra yummy.  That is the is trick!

I've now made this soup several times and it is one of my husband's new favourites...with good reason.  It is substantial enough to have as a meal served with some crusty bread.  I add a few drops of liquid smoke to it and it's a nice complement.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is a recipe that has been in my family for years. Although it isn't actually from Puerto Rico but from Spain (Galicia, Spain to be exact, hence the name Caldo GALLEGO), the recipe is extremely accurate and very delicious.

The soup did not tase bad. But it is NOT however Caldo Gallego. I am from Galicia Spain where this dish originated from and grew up eating this dish. There are many more ingredients that were omiited like salt pork, kale, pigs feet,chicken,and beef. This is more of a quick fix version with not nearly half of the authentic taste.

We loved this soup! I sauteed the meat and onions before adding to the broth and added 1/2tsp black pepper and 1/4tsp cayenne pepper. Healthy and satisfying.

It was so delicious and easy to make! My boyfriend loved t so very much and it was big enough for us to both take leftovers to work. The only thing I did different was that I put a bit of hot sauce in the soup. I will next time put just 4 to 6  cups of chicken broth and then 2 cups of water just because it was just a little bit too salty for me. The ham and chorizo already has its own natural salts I don't think I need to add anymore too it. But it was still great!!!

We loved this soup! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. The chorizo I used was so spicy it gave the whole pot of soup a kick. I will definately make it again.

I thought this turned out very well. I only had ham, so I added extra. I'm sure the sausage would have added more flavor to the soup, so I made up for it a little by adding some black pepper, garlic salt and a bay leaf. The other change I did was to hand mash some of the potatoes in the soup to make it a bit thicker, as my husband doesn't like lots of broth. Nice, yummy soup. Thank you Pam.

This is a great soup.  I did make one slight change to it, as I had trouble finding Spanish Chorizo: I browned 1 pound of Mexican Chorizo and drained it.

This is an easy recipe and it's very good. The important ingredient is the chorizo sausage; otherwise it would be just some kind of minestrone. Cut the recipe in half if you just want a few servings, because it does make a lot of great soup.

The flavor was good, but I noticed the leftovers were extremely greasy, even after skimming the fat from the broth, so we could only eat this the day I made it.

This was surprisingly tasty.  I had some chorizo and some fresh spinach that I needed to use up and searched for recipes using those two ingredients.  Thankfully, I decided on this one.  I thought at first it would be just blah, but it was actually very good.  It wasn't very pretty the day after since the potatoes kind of fell apart, but it still tasted great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family is from Galactica and immigrated to San Francisco. I was raised on this soup. My grandfather or grandmother would make a pot and freeze it in containers. He would have it for lunch with his sandwich and for dinner prior to salad and the main course.

It's a good base and I would make again. My mom used to make this soup regularly sans the chorizo and adding cilantro, garlic, cumin, spinach/kale and paprika. It's a family favorite and my mom always does things her own way.

Very good.   I did add splashes of Worcester and sherry along with some leftover veggies from the holiday.   Tasty.  The chorizo makes it.

I was really excited about trying this recipe, but must say I was disappointed. I didn't like it and neither did my husband. It was "edible" but I will not make it again.

This was lacking something but it was certainly due to the fact that I omitted the ham because it was the only ingredient I didn't have on hand. So, I added some sazon, which fixed it right up and it tasted delicious! Great taste for very little effort and time.

Very easy to make and exceptionally flavorful.  I used a turkey brat in place of the sausage and I had some seasoned pork roast leftovers I added.  My husband is a very fussy soup eater and he took seconds.  I definitely will make this again.
