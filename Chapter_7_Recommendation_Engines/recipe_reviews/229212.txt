This was an excellent recipe! The only thing that was tweaked was I added onions, jalapenos, and tomatoes to the meat while it was cooking, and a garnish of cilantro. Sour cream is a must.

Wow! Just what I was looking for! I added a can of undrained Rotel to the meat and omitted the water...Other than that....followed recipe, and it was GREAT! Going into my meal rotation. Thanks for this one!

I'll admit to using ground Johnsonville Italian sausage instead of ground beef because I had it and it was still awesome!!  I added in some green and orange bell peppers because I needed to use them and it came out fabulously.  I also *may* have thrown in some cottage cheese along with the shredded cheese (okay, I did.  And it was great.)  My husband wanted to take the leftovers for lunch which NEVER HAPPENS!  I've made different variations of this for a while now and I can say that it's a fairly quick weeknight meal and the fact that it's so versatile is truly my favorite part.  I've even added black beans when I didn't have ground beef and made it vegetarian.  You know it's a keeper when your out-of-town friends request it every time they come visit :)

Excellent. I love anything Mexican. And this was super easy.  Helpful hint: mix retried beans right in with the taco meat and layer as directed .  I added salsa to my meat mixture as well.

It was easy and popular with the taste testers in our family.  I found it to be just average in taste but you can't beat the simplicity of preparation here! All in all, a good simplistic recipe for a family meal.

This turned out really good! My 11 year old boys gave it a 10 out of 5!   I used chicken instead of beef.  I diced chicken breast and put it in the slow cooker with chicken boullion for 3 hours, drained the juice and shredded the chicken.  Then proceeded per the recipe.

Mixed tomatoes in with meat sauce as well as garlic salt & black pepper.
Used low sodium taco seasoning.
Mixed the can of vegetarian refried beans in with meat sauce.
Added a little more cheese for the cheese layers.
Since I was making dinner for only 2 people, I sectioned off the leftover food into squares for individual servings.

I made more then a few changes but worth it. I added 2 cans of rotel tomatoes, sliced olives, a small can of enchilada sauce, half a jar of taco bell mild taco sauce and I added the beans to the meat sauce. Let simmer for it is a little runny. Then I did crisp up the tortillas in some oil constantly popping the bubbles just so they don't get to soggy while cooking. I did add extra seasoning because the taco packet is not enough for us but turned out awesome! Will make again!

Liked this recipe but wow, it made so much! Should have cut it in half for family of 4 but didn't so I froze half of it. Everyone enjoyed it. Very filling. I added refried beans as many suggested. Might make it again. It was a good recipe and it doesn't really matter if, like me, you get confused with the layering;)

Turned out great!  Topped it with lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.   I used the mild taco sauce the first time I made it.   I think a nice change would be to use the Taco Bell hot or fire sauce next time.

Delicious and easy-to-make! I added a layer of sour cream after the ground beef mixture in the first layer, and added a 10 oz. can of tomatoes with chili peppers to the ground beef mixture. We love olives, so we put sliced olives over the cheese at the very end. Sliced avocados and cilantro at serving time added a nice touch, too!

I had to tweek this as usual with most of the recipes I make from this site due to dietary restrictions,and a gluten intolerance.I ended changing the ingredients up by using sliced colby jack cheese to replace the flour tortillas. I added black olives,1 can of Rotel Green Chili tomatoes, ditched the refried beans for organic black soy beans,and made some avacado guacamole along with sour cream,and made my own taco seasoning from Allrecipes website. Very yummy and settles cravings for Mexican style food!

I have made this for years, using fresh spices and home made sauce instead of mixes and jars.  You can adjust flavor better when you put your own spices and sauces.  The mixes are one note and bland.  I Serve the beans on the side because not everyone in my house likes them.  All have lettuce, olives, sour cream etc for toppings.  The tortilla can get mushy so the toppings can add some texture.  Everyone enjoys it.  But...  this is a casserole, not lasagna.  Lasagna is a type of pasta.  Just because it layered does make it lasagna.  But it is yummy.

Love the concept. Easy to make. I made it in a round dish and used a little more meat than it called for, but it turned out delicious. Topped with sour cream, lettuce & tomato added to it's enjoyment. It's a new family regular.

This is it!  Kaja's famous Soft Taco Casserole!  Mix the refried beans with a little water for spreadability.  Make sure you have more salsa, cheese and sour cream for serving and just in case; you want to be sure you can do that final broil at the end.

Entirely awesome!

It was great!  I used another all recipes, recipe for enchilada sauce as the taco sauce ingredient.   Turned out wonderful!  My family devours it every time.  At least 6 times now.  I add shredded lettuce and sauce on the side.

This is super easy and delicious. I used ground turkey instead of beef and only had a pound not 1.5 so I added corn and peas. So good.

So easy and delicious! Even my 5-year-old loved it! I did add some sour cream on the side for dipping!! This is definitely added to my recipe box!
