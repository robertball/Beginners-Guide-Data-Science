I didn't have dry milk powder so I substituted the water with milk. The bread turned out perfect. It could have been cheesier. I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Maybe I will try it next time with small cubes of cheese. Very good and very easy.

Excellent cheese bread. I used extra sharp cheddar. Be sure and use yellow instead of white though for that cheesy yellow color. Fantastic warm from the bread maker. Toasted with over easy eggs on top for breakfast is to die for. My rose too high and collapsed on top too so it wasn't really pretty but still very tasty. I use yeast in a jar measured by 2 1/4 tsp. = 1 pkg. yeast. Maybe I'll only use 2 tsp. next time. I will make this again.

Wow!  This was yummy.   No bread machine here, so I used my KitchenAid mixer, proofed the yeast with the sugar and then mixed in the rest. I forgot to add the butter and used 2 T of buttermilk powder in place of the powdered milk, which I didn't have.  I also added about a tsp. of dried minced garlic.  Rolled it into a rectangle after rising, sprinkled with cheese, rolled up jellyroll style and curled it into a spiral in a 9" cake pan.  Brushed with olive oil after it rose and baked till done.  Big hit with the family - it came out tasting almost like a croissant and was light and flaky and moist.  I plan on trying this again but with bittersweet chocolate instead of the cheese a'la French chocolate bread.

I have been searching for this recipe ever since purchasing a loaf at an Amish Bakery. According to the ingredients listed, I think this is it! This Cheese Bread has a wonderful home baked flavor with splashes of mild cheddar cheese that is to die for! I make a snack out of this bread, and is good served at room temperature, or slightly warmed in the microwave to bring out it's wonderful flavor even more!
The only difference I can see is that the Amish bake their's in the oven opposed to a bread machine, and sprinkle the top of the loaf with cheddar cheese before baking.

I probably did something wrong (a little too much water or too warm maybe?) but mine flopped.  The middle caved in, it was way too crumbly and I was not crazy about the taste.

My seven year old brother loves to help me cook, and this one was a real winner with him. I think it works best with sharp cheddar rather than just regular cheddar.

This is a really delicious bread.  It is a nice change of pace from just plain white bread.  I use sharp cheese and it adds even more zing.

This was pretty good, but I did make a few minor changes.  For one thing, I had no milk powder on hand.  So, I replaced the warm water with milk for added flavor.  I also added 2 tablespoons of garlic powder for some extra flavor.  The dough was not coming together at all, so I had to add quite a bit more milk to get it to work.  It did make too much bread for my machine, so it rose over the top, then caved in in the middle, since it had no where to go.  I would recommend maybe using the dough cycle only, then finishing the bake in the oven.  It had a nice taste to it, and I may experiment with it again.  It went great with a hearty bowl of chili!

This bread was really good!  I used 2 cups all purpose flour, and 1 cup high protein flour.  I also used about 2 cups of co-jack cheese total, some of which I sprinkled on top prior to baking with italian herb blend.  I mixed the dough in my food processor, then kneaded by hand for about 4 minutes.  baked at 350 for about 35 minutes.  will def make again.

Tasty, soft, moist.... this recipe is a real winner!  I followed the first reviewers advice and used 2 tsp measured yeast instead of the 2 1/4 that would normally equal one packet.  I also used 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of 1 1/2 (by accident, the cheese poured too fast!).  What turned out was some of the most wonderful bread I've ever baked, in a bread machine or by hand.  This just might turn out to be my favorite pregnancy craving, even over my husbands chocolate chip cookies (don't tell him that!).

This bread didn't rise very high but had a good flavor. I added 1 tbsp of dill seed for a little extra flavor which we really liked. I prefer cheese bread recipes in which you roll up the dough jelly roll style around the cheese. It's just cheesier tasting and looks better that way.

I made this using my stand mixer and it was a huge success.  I used 1 3/4 cup white extra sharp cheddar in the dough and sprinkled 1/4 cup on top before baking.  Lovely crumb, moist and flavorful.  Thanks, Heather, this is a keeper!

The flavor of this bread was great, loved the cheesiness.  But the texture wasn't great.  Don't know if I did something wrong.  I made it the way I make all my bread-mixed/kneaded in the bread machine, formed into a loaf, rose, and baked in the oven.  It rose nicely, looked and smelled great . . . but I had trouble getting it to fully cook in the middle.  When it was finally done, the texture was very heavy and dense, chewy almost doughy in the middle.  That said, I'm expecting that it will make pretty good toast today, seeing how dense it is.  Maybe this is one that needs to bake in the machine.  Or maybe the cheese just makes for a denser bread.  Not sure-I liked the flavor enough to try it again at some point.  I've baked a lot of bread and just am not sure what happened with this one!

Very nice taste but the loaf's top fell in my machine. I am unsure it is my bread machine, since this is the second loaf that has fallen in my new machine. Very tender, probably not good for sandwiches and hard to slice, but great with lots of butter.

Followed directions exactly and it came out beautiful.  Looked like a store bought bread.  I am going to make another loaf today but leave out the cheese because I think this would be a wonderful white bread.  Now I have two ways to make bread with one recipe.  Thanks Heather

This recipe was ok.  I had to use mild cheddar cheese because it's all I had.  I added quite a bit extra but it still wasn't very cheesy.  I will try it again using sharp.  I do not have a bread machine but it worked great just using the kitchenaid.  I made a round loaf and cut a couple slits on the top and it made a very pretty loaf.

This is the best cheese bread we've ever had.  We just got our bread machine so were just experimenting.  Our machine is for 2-1lb loaves and I tried making it in 1 pan but it rose too high so split it in half and put them in regular loaf pans and baked them in the oven.  I used medium cheddar and thought it was very cheesy.  The toast was excellent!                Penny

Definetly will make again.  With the leftovers, I toasted it, spread it with butter and sprinkled it with some garlic powder to make a cheap and quick garlic bread.  Very good!

This bread is delicious! I didn't have milk powder so I replaced the water with milk as mentioned by other reviewers. I also increased the amount of cheese to about 2 cups.

This bread was not only very easy to make but tasted wonderful.  I substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and upon the advice of another review used grated sharp cheese and added some chunks of sharp cheddar as well.  I will definitely be making this bread again!

I let this rise three times and baked it in a round for 45 minutes or so at 350. I used finely shredded sharp cheddar. Following another reviewer, I cut a cross in the top of my loaf before baking. The bread turned out fine, but I don't think the taste is anything too special. Maybe it's good toasted. My husband said it tasted like a Cheez-It. Not exactly the result I was going for.

It sunk like a stone and was very dense and chewy. It may be my fault as I used 2cups LIQUID MEASURE of cheese, when it may have meant dry measure. I made a two pound loaf, therefore scaled up. Flavorful, will probably try again using dry measure

I've made this twice now and for the most part it was wonderful. The first time we made it, my husband requested more cheese so the second time I put a full 2 cups and it was, essentially, perfect. The only problem we're having is one another reviewer had as well; the recipe as written makes more than our bread machine can hold, making it overflow. (We simply opened the machine and poked it back down before it got too high but the final product did end up with one end that looked a little weird and undercooked. We cut off that part and threw it away.) 

The second time I tried putting a little less yeast but suspect that by adding an additional 1/2 cup of cheese I didn't do much good in reducing the size of the finished loaf, as it was bigger than the first try. Clearly, I need to work on this and figure out what I'm doing wrong but the bread itself was scrumptious.

While we will definitely make it again, I'll probably fiddle with the recipe (or more likely use the allrecipe calculator to adjust the serving size) until I can figure out the right measurements that won't make quite so much.

I followed the recipe to the letter. Put in my breadmaker., which I know was working just fine as had just used it for 2 honey oatmeal loaves.  It mixed things so so....raised....but overflowed, and next thing I know is that I have stinky burnt cheese smoke filling the house.  the cheese must've floated on top and then kept things from properyly mixing.  This was a total disaster, and may have ruined my bread maker.  Makes me learly to try anything new or from the internet again....don't waste your time with this recipe unless you are going to bake it the old fashioned way.  It should've never been listed as a bread machine recipe!!!  I'm VERY disappointed!!!

This is a winner at our house.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have sharp cheddar, so I subbed medium.  Also I used the dough only cycle and then shaped the loaf and baked it in my oven at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes.  It had great texture, color and flavor.  Perfect with soup.  Thank you!

Super yummy.  My 1st loaf came out dense and really rich... second time it came out really light and fluffy.  On my first try I wasn't really happy with it but after the 2nd time I LOVE it.  I used old cheddar but it wasn't a really strong cheese taste.  I think I might do the dough in the machine & then take it out and bake it in the oven with more cheese sprinkled on top.  We had it with soup both times and it was lovely.  And leftovers are great toasted for breakfast.   Oh - also forgot to mention I used best for bread whole wheat flour for the loaf - no white flour at all.

The texture of this bread is so soft! It is really moist. I only had provolone cheese, not cheddar cheese, so I threw in some powdered Parmesan cheese and garlic salt for flavor and it was good. The crust had a lot of flavor, too. My family and I ate the loaf within minutes. I highly recommend this bread.

This is a delicious cheese bread.  As suggested by other reviews, I add another half cup of cheese to 2 cups and I cut the sugar by half tablespoon to 1 1/2 tbsp.  It is absolutely delicious and tasty and it stays soft too the next day. Will definitely make this again.  Cheers for this recipe. Thanks, Heather!

I made this twice, because the first time I accidentally let it rise too long. I made the dough by hand and used my bread machine to bake it (for 60 minutes) - my bread machine tends to make misshapen loaves, I hate having the paddles baked in, and I live in a studio apartment with no oven. I also made a 2 lb loaf (16 servings). I replaced 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat bread flour and added 1 teaspoon vital wheat gluten. I also used 1 cup milk (whole milk) instead of dry milk powder in place of 1 cup of the water. I had to use more flour than called for, as the dough was very sticky. I'm not sure just how much I added, as I incorporated it as I was kneading the dough, but at least 1/4 cup, no more than 1/2 cup. I also buttered the loaf pan. The loaf has a moist crumb with good texture and flavor. The cheddar flavor is definitely noticable, I'm not sure why some can't taste it. Definitely use sharp cheddar like the recipe calls for. This bread makes great toast, we like to butter it and sprinkle some garlic salt on it.

This is pretty good bread. I (as many others) did not have powdered milk. So, I replaced the water with warmed milk and left out the powdered stuff. I also used 2 cups of sharp cheddar. YUM! I didn't bake in the bread machine. I used the dough cycle, formed into a loaf, let rise about another 40 minutes or so, then baked at 350 for about 30 minutes and brushed with some melted butter. It was very good!

Really easy to make and delicious.  I used the bread maker on the dough cycle and then transferred the dough to a loaf pan and let it rise for 15 minutes and then baked it in a moderate oven for 25 minutes.

This is really tasty! The only thing is that you can't really taste the cheddar. Maybe next time I'll use extra sharp white cheddar. But this was my first recipe to use a bread maker with and it turned out really well! Thanks

WOW!  What a hearty loaf!  It wasn't pretty, I'll admit, but it tasted amazing.  A thick slice warmed up for about 30 seconds in the microwave makes for a terrific breakfast.

I had to used mild cheddar and a Mexican cheese blend.. Would have preferred sharp. I must have had my water too warm because it rose too much and got a little droopy in the middle. Tasted good but next time I'll use lukewarm water and maybe 2 teaspoons of yeast. And sharp cheddar for sure.

I made this, adding a small amount of parmesan, and  fresh mozzarella, along with the cheddar when my machine beeped for add ins. I also added garlic powder and italian seasoning.  I was amazing!  I will make this again. Oh, I also did not have powdered milk so I just used all milk, no water.

We were amazed with the flavour and how cheesy it was.

If someone doesn't have a bread machine, it can still easily be made.  Let the dough rise, punch it down, and let it rise again.  Bake at 200c (fan assisted) in a greased pan.  (We plaited the dough and placed it on a cookie sheet.)  Bake for 30 min.

I make bread all of the time and this is one of our family favorites, I do not make it in the bread machine instead I mix it in my kitchen aid mixer and then let it rise once and then I flaten the bread out after it rises, spread with grated chesse and roll up and put in pan, let it rise again then bake for 20 minutes or so at 350. When it's done baking it has swirls of cheese throughtout loaf.........yummmy.  It is a snap to make and always turns out so well, I make three loafs at a time and our family of four has them all gone in two days.  Perfect with pasta!!

This turned out great! I used milk in place of the water & dry milk powder, and I used a Mexican blend of cheese instead of just cheddar. My family loves it, and I'm definitely making it again. Add garlic, olive oil or butter, and parsley, pop in the toaster, and you've got a delicious garlic bread!

I agree with JennyLynn1. The insides were still doughy and not done. Toasting it was a good idea.  Also used as a garlic bread. I'm going to try it again. Maybe my yeast was not good.

This bread is wonderful!  My family ate 1/2 the loaf within 5 minutes of it coming out of the oven.  Very moist.  I used an entire block of sharp cheddar cheese (about 2 1/2 cups).  I didn't have enough white flour so I used 1/3 wheat flour.  I don't have a bread machine, so I was doing this the old fashioned way.  It didn't rise until I warmed the oven up a little and then it rose over the top of the loaf pan.  I cooked it at 350 degrees in a solar oven (GSO) for about 45 minutes. Next time I will let it go for about an hour, but I am still experimenting with bread in the solar oven.  Will definitely repeat!!

This bread was good.  I used the bread machine to make the dough, added maybe 1/4 c grated Asiago in addition to the extra sharp cheddar and sprinkled cheddar on top of the loaf before baking.  Loaf rose very quickly so only let rise about 30 min.  Baked at 350 for about 25 min and had to cover with foil halfway thru since it was getting too dark on top.  Good consistency and taste for sandwiches - I might try to make sandwich/burger rolls next time.

I was surprisingly disappointed with this bread. I followed the recipe exactly. The texture turned out fine, but the taste was very bland. Even buttering it didn't help. I'm going to try it again, but I think I will increase the cheese and add some roasted garlic or something to season it. Not bad overall, just not great.

My family LOVED this bread!  It made a nice large loaf, one of the best to come out of my bread machine!  Thanks for posting, will be making again soon.

Absolutely delicious! Soft like Wonder bread! I did add a little more cheese to finish the opened package I had. It fell, and looked like an accordion, but sooo good! I will make it again! I don't care how it looked. It will not let me add the photo. It said it is the wrong size, so I cropped it, but still no go.

My husband said it was the best bread I’ve ever made! I didn’t have milk powder, so I did 1/4 C milk and 1 C water. I make the dough in our bread machine and then bake it in the oven 350 for 30 min. Perfect light crust and soft inside. So good!!!

Only make the dough in the bread machine.  I have NEVER been successful with making cheese bread in the machine.  It ALWAYS sinks on me.  Set your machine on "dough cycle" and put all the ingredients in except the cheese.  When the dough cycle is complete, put dough on board and manually knead the cheese in.  Place dough in greased load pan and let it rest/rise for about 50 minutes.  I lightly brushed some butter on top, and put it in the oven (375 first 10 mine; 350 for remaining 35 minutes)  It came out perfect.  Family almost couldn't wait for it to cool.  It was beautiful!

Very nice bread with a good rise.  Instead of the shredded cheddar I used half inch cubes so we got those nice pockets of luscious cheese.  This was a real winner at home.  Will do again.  Oh I also adapted to the knead and oven as I don't use a bread maker.

Followed it beautifully except I added half a cup of ground flax seed and sprinkled cheddar cheese and course sea salt on top and did it all by hand. AND it was enough to make two nice loaves! Lovely. Thanks Heather! It's my new staple bread recipe xoxo.

It fell on me for some reason, tasted great the end that didn't fall. I will try again with less yeast maybe that will work better...I made rasin bread the other day and it was fine but raised a bit to high also and dented the top of the bread... this time it raised and knocked it back down sinking it into itself..

I make this recipe with beer instead of water - I pour a can of beer in the bread machine pan and let it set at least 24 hours to take out the carbonation and alcohol. I use two cups of cheddar - and a 1/4 cup milk, then set the bread machine on "dough" - I bake it in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes, and split the top at the 15 minute point to pour on some more cheddar.

Had to adjust portions for a one pound bread maker but other than that use ingredients exactly as stated. Turned out very soft and tasty. Would definitely make it again, in fact I might go and do it right now!

Just made this bread in the bread machine because my oven is on the fritz....i followed the directions, but reading what others said, i cut the cheese into little cubes, and mixed it all with the dry ingredients before adding it to the water/butter in the bread pan...i also added 1 tbs of gluten....when the cycle was almost over i looked inside and boy that bread had risen over the top of the pan....it looked like abe lincoln's top hat....i cut the end piece and it was so big that i made a sandwich from that one piece cut in half!...awesome taste, not extremely cheesy but you can taste the cheese....i'll def make this bread again, with a bit less gluten....

This is really delicious!!!  I gave most of my first loaf away and it was a huge hit with everyone I gave it to.  I'm going to make a second loaf soon to enjoy myself!
