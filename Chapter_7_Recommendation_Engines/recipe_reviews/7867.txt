Nice recipe - deep, dark chocolate and good and moist.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt to make the flavors "come alive." That addition, along with the coffee, ensured a very chocolatey chocolate cake. Baked this as cupcakes, about 20 minutes.  I would not hesitate making this again - very pleased.

The BEST chocolate cake, period.  We used Caroline's Chocolate Fudge frosting as a topping and it turned out awesome.  Next, we'll make this into cupcakes... so rich and delicious.  Can't taste the coffee... but whatever it does, it worked!  Highly recmmended!

UPDATE: We made these into cupcakes... actually used half-recipe, and it made enough for 1 full pan of cupcakes.  Cooked for about 15 minutes or so... they came out P-E-R-F-E-C-T.  Didn't top them with anything, as they were very rich and delicious as they were.  It's so cool to say you made something so good from 'scratch.'  Of course the guys at the poker table look at you kinda funny when you tell them that... but that's their issue, not mine.

I make this Chocolate Cake often, and get tons of
complements and request for the recipe. I worked in a Bakery for almost 9yrs. and I have to say, I know cakes and this one is awesome!!! Tip- Best baked in a Glass Cake Pan. Make it soon, you'll be glad you did.

This recipe is completely unsuitable for cupcakes, which is rather misleading considering the photo shows cupcakes.

They didn't raise correctly (and I didn't open then oven) and the coffee flavor seems to somehow create an intensified burnt flavor at the bottom of each cupcake. Oh and the liners could not be pulled off without destroying the whole cupcake. 

So while this make work in layer cake form, its unsuitable for cupcakes and seems to be a generally unstable recipe.

Very disappointing.

This cake turned out perfectly...although it took longer to bake than 30-35 min.  I was worried the outer edges would get too baked before the middle did...so I lowered the temp to 325f and cooked for 20 min or so longer and perfect!  I topped with a cream cheese frosting(not from this site)  and it was amazing.  The cake is not very sweet so a rich frosting makes it wonderful.

Wonderful recipe.  Where we live, cake mixes are very expensive and so this is a great, quick way to have cake.  It's not too sweet, so it's very versatile.  Put frosting on it to make it more sweet or just sprinkle powdered sugar on it to make it more "coffee cake" like.  I've made this many times and usually am asked who brought me a cake mix from the States!  Thanks so much!

I made this chocolate cake in Colorado, and attempted to make it into cupcakes. It was edible, but didn't raise right, fell in the middle of each cupcake as well as in the middle of the square cake (made with the leftover batter). It did have an unusual flavor from the coffee, but I would definately add more flour if you are in a high-altitude area. I probably won't attempt this recipe again, thanks anyway!

I rarely give a low rating, but there is a problem w/ this recipe - it has way too much liquid in it - batter is runny and overflows in two 9 inch cake pans.  Cake doesn't rise and can't be removed from pan.  We ended up w/ crumbs.  The good part is they tasted great!  We had them w/ ice cream on top so it didn't go to waste.  I wouldn't try this recipe w/o significant adjustments - such as using 1/2 cup of milk - i like the coffee in it and the taste is great, but it needs a major makeover.

This cake was awesome! It was so easy to make! I was very worried about the coffee, because my husband does not like coffee, but he couldn't taste it at all. I already have requests to make it again. Great cake!

I think you left something out of the recipe, namely SALT!!!  I just made this and yes, it did rise up fluffy but it's taste was lacking.  I looked up Hersey's recipe and their's has salt.  Sorry, but this is NOT the world's best chocolate cake.

This cake is delicious. I felt the middle kind of bubbled a little bit, don't know why, kind of a rectangular pattern in the center. It didn't fall. It was very moist and I used a powdered sugar, melted butter recipe that I got on All Recipes. It tastes like homemade fudge. I would definitely make this cake again. The coffee enhanced the flavor of the cake and cut the sweetness of the frosting.

This cake seemed to lack flavor, and had too much baking soda in it...as there was a hint of it left in the cake. I won't be baking again.

I made this for my niece's birthday and everyone loved it. The cake was very dense but very chocolately. I followed the suggestion about getting the best coco available. I will make this again and again! I used buttercream icing but I may just sprinkle powdered sugar on it next time if I do it as a pound cake.

My grandma came up with this recipe.  I used this recipe when I worked as a baker at a restuarant, and one time a man ate a slice and liked it so much he bought the whole cake.  I'm serious.  It felt very rewarding.  This cake is the absolute best when topped with peanut butter icing.

This recipe was so easy and turned out beautifully!  I wanted a recipe that I could use to show my teenage son how easy it to bake a cake WITHOUT a instant mix and this recipe was the ticket.  We baked it in a lasagna pan because we don't have cake pans and it was done in 35 minutes.  We also used butter instead of shortening and it was moist and very yummy!  It was great with homemade chocolate icing and there is none of the cake left as I write this review!  My son won't be asking me to pick up a cake mix anymore!!!

Like some other reviewers said, mine didn't rise properly. I made it as cupcakes, and they all caved in the middle. I also couldn't get them off the paper lining, they fell apart when I tried. The taste was nothing special, but seeing as I used half whole wheat flour and half regular, I won't rate based on that. I won't make it again.

My daughter has gestational diabeties so I tried this recipe using splenda and it exceeded my expectations for a sugar free cake.  I am looking forward to the next time I make this using regular white sugar after the baby is born.  Thanks for sharing your mom's recipe!

I halved the recipe and used a loaf pan, and it still turned out perfectly.  Very light and moist!  Will make again and again.  Oh, I also used instant coffee and it worked/tasted just fine.

Wonderful recipe. The cake was moist and delicious. I used butter instead of shortening though as my hubby likes his cakes rich.

This is a wonderful chocolate cake! Moist and fluffy; we don't even frost it and it gets gobbled up quickly. Hits the spot when you need a chocolate fix!

The submitter is right, this is the best chocolate cake I have ever had, or made. It has a great moist crumb and is very tasty.

I followed this one perfectly and it smelled wonderful. Mid  way I looked in the glass without opening the door and the centre had sunken down :(

This was a wonderful find! My mom has high cholesterol and I wanted to make a birthday cake she could enjoy - and not only did she like it, but the whole family too! Thank you!

SO GOOD! I am looking for that "special" cake, the one my son can say as he gets older he has to have for his birthday because it's mom's special cake. It really is awsome and i think the coffee is the "secret" ingredient.

Baked this recipes as cupcakes and it turned out delicious! I didn't have any vanilla (and didn't realize it till I was already in the process of making the batter), but it tasted fine without it. I made a very basic icing of powdered sugar and water and then sprinkled coconut flakes on top. Very tasty!

these were AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly as it is and everyone loved it! You can't really taste the coffee, but I wouldn't take it out. The only problem I had was that it was really hard to spread icing because it was really moist and feel apart easily. My end result didn't look that good but tasted delicious!

This recipe was very good.  I didn't have a problem with the cook time...took 33 minutes for 9x13 pan.  It had a rich chocolate flavor with a very slight hint of coffee.  The texture was a little on the dry side.  I made it for my dad for Father's Day....he's extremely picky, but he loved it and went back for seconds and thirds!  I used the Mocha Icing recipe from this site, which upped the coffee flavor even more!  Thanks!

Fantastic, moist, not too sweet and smells absolutely wonderful. Dusting it lightly with powdered sugar is also fine, so icing wasn't so important to us (less fat/calories). My family loves this cake, so it's a definite keeper. BTW, for those Americans who live in Germany: the closest I can get to having American all-purpose flour is  sifting together 1 cup 405 flour and 1 cup 550 flour (or a 50/50 ratio for other recipes).

This cake was very good, but it just wasn't the best I had.  I was expecting more coffee taste, and I didn't taste it at all.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I did frost it with vanilla frosting also.  It was moist, rose up nicely and was very easy to make.

Unfortunately I tried to bake this in a glass loaf pan which turned out to be too small, and the cake rose too high, didn't cook all the way through and then sank.  So when it was finally done it was burnt on top and gummy at the bottom.  It was still pretty good, though, so I'm going to try again and then maybe change my rating based on how it turns out.

This cake is really nice.  It has a nice height to it.  The ingredients are simple, and the cake has a very nice crumb.  The top bakes up with a crispy sweet coat.  My batter seemed quite thin, and I wound up baking the cake for an hour instead of the 30-35 minutes suggested.  We ate it plain, but to give it an extra kick frosting it would be scrumptious.

I just made it today a couple of hours ago.  It is delicious!!!  I made the 13x9 like the recipe.  I dont think I waited long enough to get 2 pieces (Ummm-couldnt stop at one), so it came out a little crumbly but it sure is good!!  I cook with droste cocoa and I think that makes it just a little richer still.  This would be good enough to take to a potluck.  It will be interesting to see how long this cake lasts around here plus it will be nice to have something yummy and somewhat wholesome with my lunch at work.  It will be a popular recipe with all us chocolate cravers here!!!

This cake has wonderful flavor.  I will definately make it again.  I made it into two 9 inch round but I may have filled them too high, I had a spillage problem.  I made a layer cake with chocolate frosting.  I put a coconut almond mixture between the layers and pressed the mixture along the sides.  It made it look REALLY pretty. Thanks a bunch, a definate keeper.

Excellent chocolate cake!  Light, fluffy, & moist.  Not too rich or bitter, yet not too sweet.  It got rave reviews at my house and I will definitely be baking it again! I used 2 9" pans to make a layer cake.  p.s. please suggest a good chocolate frosting to complement this cake

I've tried many different recipes for chocolate cake, none come close to this one. Cake is moist, with great texture. I usually sprinkle powdered sugar over top in place of white mountain icing.

I've made this twice already. I used this recipe for my four year old's birthday. I made cupcakes instead of a whole cake and they turned out great. While I mixed shortening, sugar, eggs, chocolate and vanilla, I mixed the dry ingredients together in a separate bowl. I then added the dry alternately with the milk. (that's just the order I've always used to make cakes) and I added the hot coffee last. I took the tip from another reviewer and added a little salt after I tasted the batter. It made 42 cupcakes at 350 for 15 minutes. The cupcakes paired well with butter cream cream cheese frosting. I only needed 30 for the party but cupcakes freeze well so they will make a nice treat later without the waiting. :) Thank you!

Delicious, so moist and easy. This was my first "from scratch" cake. Followed the recipe exactly. My cake did do the "rectangle shaped" thing in the center that some others mentioned, but the center never dropped and it was easily covered with frosting, so it wasn't really a drawback, just kind of weird.

The best chocolate cupcakes I have ever made.  I only made half a batch and came out with 12 cupcakes.  Baked for 20 minutes. I only used 1/2 coffee and 1/4 milk.  Oh and I used butter instead.  I used meringue buttercream frosting from this site to go on top and everyone loved them.  Thank you.

Never made a scratch cake before and I must say this was AMAZING!!! Only change I made was I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and did add a sprinkle of salt. Moist and light, I have to say this is probably the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Thanks for sharing!

When I baked this cake, it started to "goo" and bubble in the middle and then fell. To get the inside done, I had to overbake a little and the outside got a little dry.I had cleaned my coffee pot, with vinegar that morning, and maybe that was the problem,but a good flavor. Will try again

This cake was pretty good, I agree with other reviewers, that icing is what really helped give it flavour. I would try it again with more chocolate and maybe replace the coffee with something else. I couldn't taste it anyways. Baking time was closer to 45 minutes and I ended up with 1 round cake and 4 cupcakes! But, it's still nice and moist like other readers said. I'll try it again with some substitutions. I wouldn't say it's the best cake I've had, but it was good.

This recipe was easy to make and it was very fluffy.  The taste, however came out so bland for me, I decided not to use it.  Seemed like too much sugar, and the coffee gave it a strange undertone.  Will not use again.

This is good...it is fluffy, but not overly chocolatey and it has a different taste.  Nice with frosting, nothing to write home about. I'll keep looking, thanks though

What a delicious, moist cake! We loved it! I made it with sour cream chocolate frosting - great combination and easy to trim fat using skim milk & egg whites(cake) and fat free sour cream (frosting). Every little bit counts! Definitely rises really well so don't overfill your cake pan! I left about 1/2 inch in a round 9" cake pan and had so overflow. Would like it to be a little more chocolately - but we are raging chocoholics! Will make again every time I make chocolate cake but will add chcolate chips to the batter!

OK, I tried this cake again and it was great. It reminded all of us of my mother-in-laws cake that was much more involved to make.  I had to keep a close eye on the baking time, because I over baked the first one.  Everyone raved, I finally got it right.  Thanks for the recipe.

An AMAZING chocolate cake!  Rich, moist, fluffy and flavorful.  You really cannot taste the coffee, but it does something mysteriously spectacular in there.  I was concerned that the dry ingredients might not blend well if added separately so I mixed them together in a small bowl and added them to the sugar and eggs mixture alternately with the liquids.  Simply fabulous and EASY.  This is the only chocolate cake I will make from now on.  Wow!!!

I cook a lot, but never had much luck homemade deserts...until now. This was excellent. I made it for my daughter's birthday and she loves it. It rose really high, wasn't too sweet. Turned out really well. Thanks.

Very quick and easy.  Made a few changes - used a round 8 inch cake tin and had to bake for 1hr 10min, and used 1/2 cup boiling water and 1/2 cup Tia Maria in place of coffee.  It rose well, was moist and tasted great.  Next time I'll split it and fill it with raspberries and cream but this time I didn't ice it, it great as it was.

Absolutely delicious! I used a cocoa frosting for an extra chocolate boost. Baking time closer to 45 minutes.

Because there are only two of us and we were craving chocolate cake I was looking for a "scratch" recipe that I could cut in half.  This was it!  A delicious cake with great flavor and texture!  Will definitely make again.....often!  Thanks!

amazing flavour, deep rich chocolate taste with a hint of coffee, yumm...
For me, it didn't rise but this could have been easily my fault. maybe i mixed too much, or delayed putting it in the oven, i don't know. however, this is a way better cake then any other.

This Chocolate cake recipe was WONDERFUL!  I've never made such a moist cake until now.  I wanted to keep the cake light,  so instead of icing, I sprinkled powdered sugar on top.  The batter was not as thick as I was used too,  but it was not a problem.  The only adjustment I had to make was the baking time.  I ended up baking it for about 45 minutes.
This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you!!!
