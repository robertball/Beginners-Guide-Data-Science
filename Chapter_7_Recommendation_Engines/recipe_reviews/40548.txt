This was great.  Though I did not use wine, I used a can of tomatoes.

My Husband and I really loved it! I have already past the recipe onto my brother, sister and my mom! I did make a few changes that people had suggested though. I add fresh minced garlic while cooking my chicken and use red wine vinager in the place of the white wine. Some additional italin seasoning and crushed red pepper seeds added into the sauce and it was Wonderful!!! I was a little worried but I Really liked it!

Loved this recipe!  It's a delightful, attractive meal from an unexpected combination of ingredients.

Pay attention to the white wine you use in this recipe.  Different vintages with imbue this dish with different flavors, allowing for a unique experience each time.  

As one reviewer did, I added crushed red peppers for an extra zing.  I also use diced, canned tomatoes to bring done prep time and cost.  Use seasoned diced tomatoes for a slightly deeper Italian herb flavor.

This is now a constant on the meal rotation!

Simple.  Delicious.  I didn't have any white wine so I used red wine vinegar.  I used 6 roma tomatoes from my garden, and served over low carb penne rigate.  Perfecto!

We really liked the way this pasta came together.  The only thing I changed was adding some crushed red pepper becuase I was in the mood for something spicy.  It turned out really tasty!

This recipe is delicious there is a lot of flavor and anytime you have bacon and chicken together its sure to be a hit.  At the advice of others I added about a tsp of minced garlic to the chicken.  I also used about 1 1/2 cups of chopped grape tomatoes.  Instead of using wine I used chicken stock.  Will definetely make this again.

This recipe makes the most of a few ingredients. The bacon (get it nice and crispy so it doesn't get as soggy in the end) really gives the chicken a tasty flavor.

This recipe was a huge success.  I sauteed the chicken with garlic and used crumbled bacon.  My husband loved it.  The chicken and bacon are a great combination.

This was really good, I'll definitely make it again. Even my picky little guys ate it up.  I used crumbled bacon, adding it after cooking the chicken.  I also added 1 small chopped onion and 1 minced clove of garlic with the chicken pieces to give them more flavor since I didn't have the bacon grease.

What a great tasting dish!  It was also very easy to make.  I also used canned tomatoes.  It was nice to see a recipe for chicken and pasta that was a little different!

This recipe had a great flavour, but I thought it was a little soupy. I managed to thicken it up with some cheese and let it sit in the fridge and then reheat it to soak up the liquid.

I love this and so did my 82 year old mom. We're a diabetic family so we didn't use the wine but tried a can of diced tomatoes with juice to make sure there was enough liquid. It worked out great and we'll have it regularly.

This was pretty yummy. My husband took three servings. I didn't have time to simmer so I served it and it turned out pretty well still. I think the leftovers will probably get soggy, though, since the sauce wine right to the bottom of the pasta.

Very good and I made it almost exactly.    I used italian style tomatoes and pureed them (the only way my family eats them)  it was a bit soupy, so I added 2 TBSP of tomato paste.  Sauted a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  Next time I think I will add a smidge more wine and some salt & pepper.  I used bow-tie noodles and I think that this dish really needs a different pasta that can hold the sauce.  Like the radiatore that the recipe recommends.    Very nice change from the sweet sauces.  I will be making this again

This dish is both interesting and delicious. I only added half the bacon because it became soggy in the wine and I enjoy my bacon very well done. I included cloves of garlic as well. It was a great meal for dinner and even cold as a late lunch the next day.

This was *very good*.  I used diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added some red pepper as per earlier suggestions.  YUM!  There was only two of us and it's all gone!!!  We'll definitely make this one again.

I may have only given this three stars myself, but since my very picky hubby went back for seconds, I've decided to give it the extra star.  It was kinda bland and the pasta didn't help that at all.  My hubby and I also didn't like the tomato peels - the tomatoes cooked down nicely, but next time I think I'll either peel them first or use canned.  I also didn't cook the chicken in bacon drippings since my bacon was left over from BLTs the night before.  I just used about 1 tbsp of butter, but I wonder if the flavor would have been better with the bacon drippings or overpowering?

This is a good base recipe but in my opinion needs a few changes otherwise it's kind of boring. I give this 4 stars based on the additions I made: added 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 small onion chopped, a handful of fresh mushrooms, crushed red pepper, fresh basil, dried oregano (instead of generic "italian seasoning"). I've made this with both fresh tomatoes and a can of diced tomatoes and it comes out good. I would use canned unless you have GOOD fresh tomatoes, which are often hard to come by.  Also I would not cook the chicken all the way and then simmer for 20 minutes, the chicken would be rubbery by that point. I cook the chicken halfway then it cooks the rest of the way by simmering.

Great, simple recipe. I left out the wine and used canned, crushed tomatoes instead and it still came out tasty! Next time I'm going to try using pancetta instead of bacon.

Very tasty recipe!  I only strayed from the recipe to add a small Vidalia chopped, used a 32 oz can of chopped tomatoes (cuz I don't have time to chop fresh), 2 tsp Italian seasoning, and 5 garlic cloves.  I will be making this again!

This was a success! I am giving it a 4/5 because we made a few adjustments to the recipe as suggested by others.  We used linguine pasta and cooked it towards the end not letting it sit.  We added diced garlic, onions, mushrooms and a few red pepper flakes.  We also used 1 1/2 cans Italian diced tomatoes.  Our 11 year old daughter liked it so much she wanted to lick the plate.

This was a good recipe.  I used fresh tomatoes from the farmers' market and took the suggestion of other reviewers and added some garlic along with the chicken. I also added fresh basil to the finished dish. I cut down on the amount of bacon called for, too.

This dish was very good and had a lot of flavor.  I did make a few changes: I used 3 strips of bacon, instead of white wine I used chicken broth and 14.5oz package of thin spaghetti.  It had tons of flavor and everyone loved it!

Amazing taste, Sunday delight.  I used light red wine, and a couple hints from others. Red Peppers, mince onions.

As other reviewers suggested, I used 1/2 red wine vinegar & 1/2 white wine instead of all white wine.  I also used 6 roma tomatoes (for 6 servings) instead of 2 large regular tomatoes.  I added 1/2 lb of fresh sliced mushrooms & 3 cloves of garlic too.  The recipe turned out good, but I thought it would've had  more flavor.  It took me a long time to cook and crumble all the bacon and the resulting taste was weaker than I expected.  But overall a good recipe that can be easily tweaked to your own liking.  :)

I am not proficient in the kitchen so this could have been user error, but mine was so watery. I made it a second time, followed directions exactly except! cooked bacon and saved to sprinkle at the end (not cooking it with everything to get soggy) Liked it better. Just my thoughts!

This was tasty and it deserves at least 3 stars just for being something easy to throw together at the last minute from pantry and fridge staples. Anything to make the dinner hour easier is good in my book. However, I have to say that I didn't find this special enough to come back to it again. I felt like it needed a bit of a flavor boost.
Still, a solid three star recipe.

I prepared my bacon in the oven (did the whole package.  added it in at the very end assembly. Added orgeano, garlic and red pepper flakes.  Cooked chicken in skillet with a little olive oil.  

Felt the dish was a bit dry and added a little more olive oil before serving.  Added real Parm cheese.  Love, love, love.  Even the 2-year-old ate his fair share.

We loved it. I used a can of tomatoes, drained, instead of the fresh ones. It's not really tomato season anymore. Next time I might add two cans because one didn't seem like quite enough. Also make sure to add some salt and pepper. Oh and add minced garlic to the chicken while it's cooking in the bacon grease. In my opinion everything could use a little garlic. Over all though very simple and very good.

Loved this dish!  It was quick and easy to prepare and my family (including my picky eater) said to make sure we have this again.  I did follow the advice of others who review this and added a can of diced seasoned tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes.  I also found that served at room temperature this can pass as a pasta salad.  My friend had a picnic and was carrying out the macaroni salad when she tripped and dropped the whole bowl on the ground.  I had this dish in my fridge and we served it as the pasta salad.  No one knew it was a main dish and everyone wanted the recipe for the "pasta salad".

This was ok..the chicken got a bit dry. I added tomato paste to it which gave it a good flavor. The bacon was soggy after adding it to the dish so I didn't like that at all. I will not make this again.

This is a very good recipe! As soon as my bf took one bite he feel in love. I did add 8 oz of whole mushrooms. I thought there was a little to much bacon. Would probably cut in half (but bf thought it was perfect). Will make again! TX

To be honest, I had some doubts going into this recipe due to the lack of spices/ingredients but I must say that I was wrong. This dish was super easy to make and filled with flavor. I am so impressed with this receipe. I LOVED it. I can not wait to make it again. PS:  I used spiral pasta because I could not find radiatore.  Perfect....

My husband practically licked his plate!  For just the two of us I cut the amount of pasta, bacon, and chicken in half but left the wine & tomatoes the same so there would be enough sauce.  So, If you want to make the 6 servings, I would double the wine and tomatoes.  I also doubled the Italian seasoning, added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper for some heat, and added a couple cloves of minced garlic when I sauteed the chicken in the bacon grease as suggested by other reviews.  The sauce was still a bit too runny for our taste at the end so I added a little corn starch and it thickened right up and stuck to the pasta better.  YUMMY!

My family and I did not like this. It is so dry and lacking flavor. I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on mine to make it good. I also don't like when you have to put crispy bacon in a liquid and it gets all soft. Soggy bacon is not good. I did make it with bow tie pasta, but that was the only change.

This dish was awesome.  I took the recommendations of people and it turned out great.  Defintely saute your chicken in garlic and onion to give it more flavor.  I also used canned diced Italian tomatoes.  I also sprinkled the pasta with fresh parmesan cheese.  The only thing is that I think I would do different next time is I would make a double batch of the sauce.  We had a lot of extra noodles.  I will defintely make this again and again!

I wasn't as excited about this dish as the others who have written about it.  I felt it needed more flavor.  I did not use wine as I did not have any but instead used chicken broth.  I also used petite diced tomatoes as others had suggested.  It was OK.. I had to add more seasonings to it- Salt, pepper, garlic and cayenne pepper.  I think if I do this again I will use wine and real tomatoes.  If you have the ingredients on hand and are looking for something to throw together than I would suggest it.  I would not go out of my way to make it again.

I added an onion, but that was it.  It came out great. With my son allergic to dairy I am always looking for pasta dishes that are not cream/cheese based this one fits the bill and is very yummy!

Didn't like it at all, no real flavor except for the wine, no texture, it needed a sauce to mix with it, maybe a cream sauce or something.

I used 1 can of diced tomatoes.  Listen to one of the users and used red wine vinegar instead of white wine.  It was sour so I had to put some sugar on it.  It was good, except a little sour.  Only thing is that kids loved it.  I used basil, thyme, and rosemary instead of Italian seasoning.  I seasoned the chicken with cornstarch, soy sauce and garlic powder, and also cooked the chicken with minced garlic.  Will definitely try with white wine next time.

This came out very rich and with a stew like consistency. I did change a few things, like sauteing onions and garlic in the bacon grease first, before adding the tomatoes.  Very tasty!

So easy and so good!  Most ingredients I already had on hand, except the wine.  I repaced it with sherry and it still came out delicious.  I also used 5 roma tomatoes and added some fresh minced garlic in with the chicken.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Oh, I also used 1 T. Ital seasoning instead of 1 t.  I'm from the south and used to extra seasoning!  Will be made again and again!

Easy enough to make. Radiatore pasta doesn't seem to exsist in my town, so I used Bowtie pasta, which was probably too big of a pasta. But the dish turned out well. I'll probably make it again.

The ingredients in this recipe don't work well together.  The bacon gets soggy and the wine is out of place.  I will not make again...
