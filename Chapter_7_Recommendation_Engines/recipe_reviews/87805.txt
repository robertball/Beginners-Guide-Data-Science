We thought this was quite good -- a nice change from so many of the crockpot recipes that use canned cream soup as a base. The combination of spices and herbs sounds strange, but combined to make a nice, rich, herby flavor. Used the listed amounts of all the spices, w/a few exceptions: I replaced the tbsp of garlic powder w/onion powder (since I used 2 lrg cloves of fresh garlic crushed in my garlic press). I also seemed to be out of basil & oregano, so used nearly a tbsp of Italian seasoning. Also used more than 1 cup of broth, but less than the whole can, since I was cooking 6 chops inst. of 4. I cooked on low for 8 hours -- smelled SO delicious when I got home from work, and my husband wondered what smelled so great when he got home. The sauce was great over steamed rice and the meat was tender and flavorful. Even the kids liked it. All in all, a very easy, tasty recipe -- I will make this again. Would also be good w/a small pork roast.

We loved this recipe! It has a mediterranean taste to it. I doubled the liquid and it cooked in half the time with 1 inch chops. My teenager boys loved it! The gravy was excellent over rice and steamed veggies.

I thought the meat was super tender and flavorful.  I sauted the garlic in the oil first before mixing it with the rest of the spices.  I also browned the chops in the same pan that I sauted the garlic in before adding to the crock pot. Plus I added extra chicken broth.  Great served with long grain wild rice.  Will definately make again.

My daughter says this should be given 5 stars.  I tend to agree.  My husband loved it as well.  The only thing I changed in this recipe was to cook it on low for 8 hours instead of 'high' for 4.  I also added 2 cups of chicken broth instead of one.  The chops were extremely tender and very tasty.  This will be made again.  Thank you!

Loved it!!The best recipe I've found on this web-site in 5 ys. I agree it tasted mediterranean. I doubled the chicken broth, used garlic salt instead of powder, added green beans the last half hour, used pork loin chops, & served it over Basmati rice.

This recipe tasted great and the pork chops were so tender they ended up falling apart. The only down side was it was a little oily for me so next time I will reduce the oil. I also added a little balsamic vinegar to the mix for extra flavor. Overall very good and I will make it again.

These chops were great. They were so tender, you could cut through them with a fork. The spices/herb were strong, but very yummy. If you are at home while cooking these, it would be beneficial to baste or turn the chops every few hours. The bottom side of our chops were much more flavored than the top side.

This recipe was VERY good!  My husband isn't a huge fan of pork chops but I am and was looking for something easy to do with them yet still being flavorful.  This recipe fit the bill!  Most ingredients are those you would most likely have on hand in your kitchen and it doesn't get any easier than this.  The pork chops literally were fall apart tender.  I used thick chops and cooked them on low for 8 hours.  EXCELLENT!  Thank you so much for the great recipe!

What a wonderful crock pot recipe! I used six pork chops (medium thickness) a complete can of chicken stock, and all of the spices called for. (okay... maybe a bit more!) I did use onion powder instead of garlic powder. Cooked on high for 5 hours. I removed the pork chops and covered to keep warm, while I made a gravy with the liquid. I strained the liquid through a mesh strainer to remove the garlic and large spices, mixed together with a corn starch and water mixture. It made a WONDERFUL gravy that I served over the pork chops along with steamed rice and peas.  EASY recipe that I will absolutely make again and again!!

Good, for a crock pot recipe.  I find it hard to get the perfect, "fall-off-the-bone yet not too dry" texture that I like - I think crock-pots vary so it's diffictult to gage.  I do not reccomend "basting" as the recipe calls for, as that defeats the purpose of using a crock pot - you do not want heat to escape until the very end.  This was good and easy, but not the best way to cook a flavorful pork chop.  Do it, if you need something easy.

This flavor was definitely something different, strong but good combination. My two toddlers gobbled it up. I put in minced garlic and onion powder instead of garlic powder. I put the chops in the crock pot at 9:30 am on low. At 2:30 pm I added one cup of brown whole grain rice, and by 5 pm the rice had absorbed the juices nicely. It gave the rice a nice flavor, and the pork chops were the most tender I've ever made. Good solid recipe. :)

I am not a big fan of pork chops but these were really good! They also got my husbands approval which is always good. I didn't use the oil and added a few more spices. I did use about 2 cups plus of broth because I had 6 chops. Cut up some onions and celery and let it go. Very good will use again they were very tender and not dry at all!

Delish! I used way less oil than the recipe called for and instead of pork chops I used the meat off a pork roasting joint.

By far the best porkchop I have EVER EVER tasted!  I am not a huge pork fan and have steered away from porkchops most of my life...but these were AMAZING!  They smelled absolutely heavenly while cooking and we all couldn't wait to eat at dinner time!  When it was time to serve them, they fell right off the bone!  Could barely scoop them out of the crock pot without them falling apart!  My father-in-law and fiance raved over these porkchops forever...saying that they were the best they have ever tasted as well!  I cut slices into the raw chop and sprinkled with garlic powder, salt, and pepper and pan fried for a few minutes on each side in a tablespoon of vegetable oil to just brown and get some flavor in the chop.  I also did add a little Italian Seasoning instead of just Oregano, as well as a bit of onion powder to the liquid mixture.  We saved the juice that the chops cooked in and froze it because it was so good we couldn't just trash it...will probably try and experiment with it cooking something else...or just maybe add it to the mix next time we cook chops.  Will definitely be making these again...in the very NEAR future!

These were truly phenomenal.  I didn't have garlic, so replaced both the garlic powder and the garlic with garlic salt.  Replaced the poultry seasoning with some crushed rosemary, a dash of nutmeg and some freshly ground black pepper.  I also added some whole shiitake mushrooms which came out almost tastier than the meat!  Once the pork chops were cooked, I removed them from the slowcooker, added a bit of cornstarch mixed with cold water and cooked on high for a minute or two until thickened.  Sauce was delicious over whole grain rice!

I made half this recipe for Hubs and me last night.  I used bone-in pork chops and first browned them in a little oil.  I didn't use any additional oil.  I removed the chops to the slow cooker and deglazed my pan with the chicken broth/seasoning liquid and poured it over the chops.  I saw no need to cut slits in the chops, so I skipped that step.  I cooked these on low for 6 hours.  I strained the cooking liquid and thickened it with a cornstarch/water slurry.  I then added a tablespoon of butter and I had a delicious gravy to serve over the chops.  This was very good and one I would definitely make again, in part because Hubs couldn’t stop raving about it.

I've never been a fan of porkchops until I tried this recipe.  The chops are moist and super delicious.  I added all the ingredients to the slow cooker the night before and stuck it in the fridge.  Pulled it out the next day and turned the slow cooker on low before leaving for work and came home to a wonderful smelling house and delicious dinner.  The only change I made to the original recipe was to add an extra cup of chicken broth to keep the chops covered. Would definitely recommend!

Tried this recipe today after reading through many of the reviews.  It was really good.  I agree that need to use very little oil.  I used 1/2 chopped onions instead of garlic powder - used fresh garlic.  I used two cans of chicken stock because many stated it dried out and mine had to cook for 8 hours.  I sauted my garlic and onions last night and mixed everything together in the crock pot and put in frig overnight.  Cooked on low for 8 hours and was perfect.  Used the liquid to make brown rice and that was absolutely worth making the recipe for what it did for that rice.  Easy recipe and very flavorful. This goes in the lineup! - Sandra

Really Really Really nice! Really!  I followed the directions to the letter except I used bone in pork chops, which came out, deeply flavored and falling off the bone tender.  Even my dog tore up the trash to get at the bones!  Yes, there is an oily component to the sauce, but this is where the flavor is delivered in a big way.  To sum up - super easy, fantastic flavor and in an instant has been put at the top of our list.  To think, I was only looking for something to do with my crockpot.  what a great surprise!

I love the rich flavor and the lack of canned soup! The meat was so tender it didn't require a knife.

Happened upon this recipe quite by accident when I discovered that the pork roast I had defrosted was actually 2 pork chops... Since I only had 2 I cut the seasonings in half but used the same amount of broth and oil. I have been searching for YEARS for a recipe that would give me tender, juicy, pork chops and not just a chewy, dry mess. I have not been successful until now. These pork chops FELL apart, cut with a fork, and were SOOOO juicy and flavorful. It was like heaven in my mouth. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the oil. Combined with the fat from the chop that cooked down it was just too rich in the oil department. I will definitely make this again, will probably be my go to pork chop recipe, but I will either decrease the oil or leave it out all together and will half the spices again because it was just enough flavor to not drown out the pork like some other reviewers stated.

WONDERFUL! Both my husband and myself enjoyed every mouth full! I did brown the thick bone in pork chops in some of the olive oil that the recipe calls for before placing them in the slow cooker. Other then that i did everything as called for, i did use roasted garlic from the jar instead of fresh bulb garlic.  I also cooked up some angle hair pasta and used the suace that the meat cooked in. I cooked mine on low for 6 1/2 hours.  The meat was falling off the bone as i placed it on the plate i wouldn't cook it any longer then that, I will definatly be making this wonderful dinner again! Thanks for sharing

These were absolutly fabulous!  My husband has disliked pork chops his entire life but agreed to at least try these pork chops.  He absolutly loved them!!!  I have never seen him enjoy a meal so much, they were so delicious. I followed the recipie exactly except I used thinner pork chops in which I had to reduce the heat to low after 2 hours.  They turned out so great I will use this recipie over and over!  Thank-you!

Thanks so muh for a great recipe! I was wanting a recipe that did not use creamed soup as a base as my husband does not care for creamed soups.This was it! We loved this recipe and it made the best Gavey for the mashed potatoes that I served it over.I used hot cayenne and it made it super! I did use 2 cups chicken broth as suggested by other viewers. That was the only thing I did different. Will definately be making this recipe again!

I try never to review a recipe unless I made it as written, but I just couldn't bear to put 1/4 oil in this so I substituted white wine.  Everything else I did was as written but I doubled the sauce so I would have extra to put on the roasted red potatoes I made.  It smelled really good while it was cooking, and even my 5 year old said that!  It was very tender when finished, but the juice it was cooking in was blah and thin.  I then had to start doctoring it up.  I tried thickening it, but that didn't help much.  I added salt, tried a little more wine, and nothing I did made it great.  My husband and I both didn't really care for it, but still ate it.  I would have given this 2 stars, but since I changed the recipe I gave it some extra credit.  I won't make this again.

AHHHHMAZING.  I only tweaked a few things (out of necessity).  I never measure ingredients when I am cooking...just eyeball them.  Also, I did not have poultry seasoning or garlic or garlic powder.  I used what I had, which was chicken seasoning and minced garlic (along with the other ingredients).  I also added a little bit of lemon juice after it had cooked for awhile.  About an hour before it was done, I threw in some rice.  OH MY GOODNESS.  The rice soaked up all the delicious liquid. This is some of the best pork I have ever had!  I will definitely try this with chicken as well.  Thank you for sharing such an AHHHHMAZING recipe!! :)

This was very easy to make and tasted Great. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, The only difference is I used 1 cup of water with 2 chicken bullion cubes and since these were VERY thick boneless pork chops, I cooked it on low for 8 hours. It was falling apart with your fork. I served with rice and a veggie and it went well with the rice. I'll defiantly make this again! THANKS!

This was a great recipe for pork chops. With the leftover sauce in the crock pot I whisked in some cornstarch & a little flour and it served as a tasty gravy! I served it with mashed potatoes, so the gravy worked out perfect.

This was one of the worst recipies I have tried. The porkchops came out very dry, inedible. In retrospect, it would have been better to cook them on a low setting for about 6 hours.

I made these tonight for dinner and they came out very dry.  We loved the marinade though.  I think it was my error for the dryness so we will be trying these again.  Also I will double the marinade, it soaked up all of it, and there was none left to put on top of the chops.  My 2 year old loved them though!!

I always try the recipes on this website that have 5 stars.  I've never been disappointed...until this recipe.  I cannot believe the rave reviews it received.  The spices in the recipe did not mesh well together.  The pork chops, which I thought would be moist, were very dry.  They fell apart, but that made the texture even worse.  I will not make this recipe again.  Very disappointed...

I followed the  recipe as written and the pork chops were dry and very stringy. My only thought was perhaps I used pork chops too thick. I would like to give it a second try with thin, bone in, pork chops.

Needed a quick recipe that would also create tender pork chops for my Dad. Not only did it do that, but tasted great as well. Doubled the chicken broth, which in turn, used the sauce on the rice that I used as a side dish. Both Dad and I loved it, which from my Dad, is a feat in itself. Will definitely make again.

Very easy to pull together ingredients, and they add a nice flavor to the pork. Be sure not to cook too long though, it will dry out the chops

Surprisingly good. I was worried at first because I do not care for a few of the seasonings used but still followed as written and we really enjoyed it. Cooked on low setting for 6hrs.

This was really good.  I cut the olive oil in 1/2 as other suggested and substituted crushed red pepper flakes for the paprika.  I also sliced an onion laid the chops on top of them and also on top for more flavor.  I used boneless pork chops and the meat was fork tender with a really savory flavor.

I love crock pot cooking and had high hopes for this recipe because it's so simple. Unfortunately, it just didn't work for me. The chops were very tender but the spices totally overwhelmed the sauce and chops. I didn't even care for the smell while it was cooking. Sorry, I really wanted to like this!

Okay, I took all your advice, I doubled the sauce recipe, subbed onion powder for garlic powder and cooked the pork chops on low heat for 6 1/2 hours.  The only good thing was the aroma in the house when I got home.  Why cook pork if you can't taste the pork? All I had was tender meat that tasted like spices. I would try this recipe with less tender cuts of beef or wild game, but I found it inappropriate for pork.

This is a very easy recipe and very tasty. I scooped out some of the sauce and reduced it to serve with the pork. I also used regular pork loin and cut it into three pieces and cooked for 6 hours on low.

I am not the biggest pork chop fan but they were on sale and the family loves them so I picked this recipe and ....wow! This is such a good recipe. I even had seconds! The flavor is just so wonderful and it is so easy to make. I wouldn't change a thing! I will be making these again soon!

This was very easy to prepare but I did not like the oily taste it had.  I would recommend leaving the oil out altogether and using 2 cups of chicken broth.

I am not a fan of pork chops - boneless or otherwise. Usually they are just so dry tasting to me. This recipe however', is anything but! It was so good! Flavorful, juicy, fall apart tender. For 6 boneless pork chops I used 2 cups of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of white wine. Everything else was as written. Served over brown rice with a side of veggies for an over all low fat dinner! Yum!!

Made this today for Father's Day - used full can of broth and 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice. Don't use dried basil but just before serving, added fresh chopped herbs from the garden - thyme, flat leaf parsley, basil, garlic chives and regular chives. Served over brown rice which absorbed the delicious sauce.  The pork was beyond tender and am keeping this as a dish I will serve again.  Delicious!

This recipe was excellent!! The pork just fell right off the bone. I cooked mine on LOW for 8 hrs instead of high because I had more time. This recipe was so simple just the way slow cooker recipes should be. Definitely will be made again!

These were lovely, falling apart.  Nice change from using a Cream of soup base.  For the leftovers, I did chop the meat and add in a can of Cream of Celery soup and just a smidge of milk.  Served over noodles.  Was even great as leftovers.

Loved how easy and delicious this was! I prefer slow-cooker recipes that require very little prep work, and this was a great one. Hubby loved it, and he usually doesn't really like pork chops.

These are some of the best pork chops.  My husband normally doesn't like pork chops.  He says they are too dry, but I made these in the crockpot, from frozen and they were great.  He asked when I planned on makeing them again.  I'm so happy because I love pork chops and usually only had them when we went out since he felt so strongly about not liking them.

We really enjoyed this. I had a couple more chops than recipe calls for, so i increase the liquid and seasonings just a little (by eye) and it was delicous.  The meat was so tender, it fell apart if I wasn't careful lifting it out of the crock pot.

An excellent, easy dish. Instead of 1/4 cup of oil, I mixed all the dried spices and herbs and mixed about a tablespoon or so of olive oil to make a rub that I put on 6 thick-cut boneless pork chops. I used 2 cups of chicken broth made from Better Than Bouiillon and skipped the garlic cloves. 2 hours on High and about 2 hours on Low. Outstanding! Might do better just doing 4 hours on Low next time. Very delicious. I will use this mix for other meats for sure.

Made these for dinner tonight, the aroma through the house was wonderful.  They were a hit.  Things I did differant is I floured and browned the chops then discarded the oil, made my own poultry seasoning from allrecipes because I didn't have any. ( good recipe too). Also didn't add the fresh garlic and used chicken base mixed with water for chicken broth. I did double the liquid and ended up with 2 cups gravy after I strained it. Very good fork tender chops. served them with mashed potatoes, peas and carrots. Yummy

This recipe was great! For extra tenderness and a little different flavor, I added a can of cranberries and some cognac. I cooked both boneless and bone-in chops on low in the crock pot for 6 hours. They were wonderful and tender...a big hit with my guests! Thanks for this delicious recipe.

I was hoping to find a recipe that made moist, tender pork chops and this one is great!!  We have already made it twice with a few tweaks below to suit my families taste! 

-gently infuse EVO w/crushed garlic in pan 
-after preparing raw chops, sprinkle lemon juice over them and let them stand for 5 minutes per side
-lightly brown in same pan garlic was browned in
-add to crockpot 
-halfway thru add some butter and lemon juice and

The pork chops turned out very good, nice and tender, I cooked them on low for 8 hours.  However, I did double the chicken broth, only used a splash of olive oil.  Also, next time I will cut down on the oregano to 1/2 tsp - I found it to be overpowering.  So with minor changes this recipe is a keeper, love that I can make pork chops in the slow cooker!

Didn't like it at all!   Way too herby flavor for me, such a dissapointment considering all the great reviews. Ended up rinsing off the left over meat, shredding it & adding BBQ sauce for pulled pork sandwiches.

Made recipe as directed and it was tasty, yet the pork chops were a bit dry. They were super tender, however, which is a nice switch from grilled pork chops which can be tough. As a family we decided that a little dry is preferable to tough. Thanks for the recipe; will make again!

I put my pork chops in the slow cooker right after church yesterday and had them cooking all day long.  They were very good...just missing something.  Maybe a gravy of some sort.  We had them with mac and cheese and green beans.  Both of my picky kids ate them..they said it as really good.  I think again, just missing the gravy.

Surprisingly bland.  There really wasn't a lot in terms of taste considering all the spices and the amount of time the pork is in them.  Probably won't make again, there are better things to do with pork than this recipe.

I actually had to double check this recipe for the amounts of spices seemed too much. I read some of the reviews and since everyone agreed that it was way too oily I cut that to half the amount. Still was way too much, next time I think I will only add about 1 tbsp. The pork chops did turn out nice and tender, still a bit bland for the amount of spices but maybe the oil amount took away from them flavoring the meat. I will try again though since it was super easy to do and I had all the spices.

I did not have dried basil or poultry seasoning so I used thyme and a little rubbed sage and greek seasoning in their place. Also used hot paprika.I had two chops and cut the oil to 1/8 cup and made the rest of the sauce to the recipe- made plenty of sauce- cooked on medium for 6 hours and shredded the meat and served on rice. Incredibly good. I know a lot of readers may not like the changes but it I appreciated the original recipe but just didn't have all the ingredients!!  Thanks for sharing.

The pork chops were very tender, which we loved.  However, for all the spices the recipe calls for, we were surprised at how bland the pork chops were.  They were ok, but not great.  I probably wouldn't make them again.

Very yummy says my 10 year old and if she likes it, it has to be good.  I used about a tablespoon of oil and more chicken broth to make gravy after cooking.  Added 1tsp of onion powder.  Cooked 3 hours on high and 1 on low.  Served with rice covered with the gravy.  We will be fighting over the one leftover chop!!

Finally a pork chop recipe that comes out tender and juicy!  Delicious, herby taste and the meat just fell apart.  Changes I made:  Added half a large onion, chopped, and an extra clove of garlic.  Used a can of chicken broth instead of just a cup.  Just a dash of olive oil instead of 1/4 cup since many reviews said that it came out too oily.  I also cooked them 8 hours on low because I was going to be gone for longer than 4 hours but tested them after 6 hours and discovered they were done.

These were delicious!!! I doubled the recipe and browned the chops before adding to the slow cooker. Even my kids loved these, and they are pretty picky. :)

Thanks for the great idea! I used my cast iron dutch oven to brown and braise and it was wonderful! I didn't measure any of the ingredients. Just coated chops in flour and added seasonings then browned in about 1 T oil. I used homemade chicken broth-about two cups-and braised covered at 350 for 1-1/2 hours. Note to myself: be sure to serve with plenty of homemade rolls or rice to mop up sauce-yum!

Awesome flavor, a break from the typical chops.  Extremely tender.  Next time I will put the sauce over rice as it was so tasty.  Thanks for this easy recipe!

My family enjoyed this very much.  Like some of the reviewers I cooked 1 inch chops for approx. 8 hours.  I was surprised that mine came out somewhat dry.  I added a 1/4 cup of white wine to the liquid as others suggested, and I would recommend doing that.  Not sure what to do to prevent the meat from being dry?  Good recipe, will make it again.

I am quite impressed with this recipe, although I did change a few things the second time I cooked it.  I cut back slightly on the paprika to 3/4 tbsp as I felt 1 tbsp was somewhat overpowering.  I've never added the poultry seasoning - just a sprinkle of montreal steak spice in lieu.  I felt it needed more broth, but rather than add two packets with two cups of water, I simply added one packet to 1 ¼ cups of water to avoid the extra salt.  And I added more minced garlic rather than garlic powder.  Fresh sliced mushrooms and finely chopped onions topped off this recipe.  Once cooked, I thickened it slightly with cornstarch – goes great with mashed or riced potatoes.

Very good recipe - made the house smell terrific all day.  The only thing I would change is to use a little less olive oil.  Otherwise, very tasty and I will make it again.

Awesome recipe. I cut it down for a two chop meal. The house smelled amazing within a half hour. One nice little addition I threw in--I tossed a few chunky chopped mushrooms in with near to an hour and a half left. They were awesome and perfectly cooked. A real nice accent--served it up with some oven roasted fries and veggies. The fries were great in the seasoned juice from the chops. Really. Top notch.

They were good, but too much paprika!! I used twice the amount of chicken broth and half the amount of oil. Next time I will use half the amount of paprika.

The reason this is five star is because the amount of work is so small for such a great payoff.  The taste is excellent (don't add the oil or reduce significantly because you don't need it and it doesn't really need any extra salt).  The meat turns out very tender and it is so easy.  My kids and husband, I am feeding 5 boys, like it best when I make a gravy out of the sauce (just make extra sauce, a quick roux and add some milk) and serve it up with mashed potatoes, corn, carrots, etc.  Also great with rice and vegetables.  As other reviews mention you can change it up a lot with good results.

LOVED these... even my rarely-meat-eating toddler. I mixed all of the ingredients together in the slow cooker and placed in the fridge overnight to marinate, then starting the cooking in the morning. They were delicious! Will definitely make again.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! This was one of the first "real meals" I made for my husband and it is already a staple favorite. I usually double the recipe to cover the "family pack" pork chops I buy, because leftovers are our best friend. I don't have garlic powder or poultry seasoning so I just throw in an extra garlic clove and use 2 tsp each oregano, basil, and season salt, almost 2 tbsp paprika, 1/2 cup olive oil, as well as about 1 1/2 cups broth. I also add splashes of balsamic vinegar to taste (or smell, rather), as another reviewer suggested, and my personal theory is that it's the balsamic that really makes the dish. It's fantastic!

Great flavor and very moist. As suggested by others, I decreased the olive oil to 1/8 cup, increased the chicken broth to 2 cups, sauted the garlic in olive oil, and used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. So easy and didn't bother basting, just turned the chops over half way through the 4 hours. Wonderful new recipe for our household. Thanks, ERINVDIX!

We all enjoyed this recipe very much! I simmered everything on the stove top (I used a whole can of chicken broth)for about and hour, then added slices potatoes and cooked another 1/2 hour.  The flavor was great and the pork cutlets very tender!

I used a 2.5 lb. center cut pork loin roast well trimmed of fat. I did not add any oil, only the chicken broth and other ingredients, cooked on low for 8 hours. It turned out great, very tender and flavorful. I did add cornstarch to the sauce to slightly thicken it.

I definitely make this again, it was a very tasty., moist, the chops fell off the bone. The only thing is 4 hours on high is too long. I started it on high and then turned it down to low for the last 3 hours. I think it could be done totally on low. I also wrapped a large sweet potatoe in foil and put it on top the chops with about 2.5 hours to go and it was so tender and moist!

Surprisingly good for something so simple!  My fiance was doubtful about the whole idea of slow cooker pork chops, but he was converted.  I added extra chicken broth, half a chopped onion, two teaspoons onion powder, juice from half a lemon, and one teaspoon of paprika instead of three.  I also browned the pork chops in some butter before adding them to the slow cooker, and then deglazed the pan afterwards using more chicken broth and adding that as well.  
Cooked it on low for six hours and it was terrific!!  Very tangy, savory, yummy, and delicious.  So tender and flavorful.  Be sure to adjust the salt and pepper before serving -- using bone-in pork chops also helps.  Will definitely make again.  Fiance ended up licking his plate!

I was looking for an easy slow cooker, pork chop recipe.  This is it for sure.  I had a lot of the spices in kitchen, except I was out of basil and poultry seasoning.  I substituted Old Bay and I have to say it was so good.  My boyfriend and I loved the results.  One thing I do not understand is why it is difficult to find thick cut pork chops anymore?  Most every grocery store I have been to have thin cut.

Delicious! I think there was too much oil, and I think the spices may have been too much (there was a slightly bitter aftertaste). Still, they tasted wonderful, and I will be making these regularly. Next time, I will use a little less oil, increase the broth to compensate, and maybe add some brown sugar to offset the bitterness. Perfect with a starchy side! I also would skip the basting process. I was out of the house the whole time, so I couldn't baste it, but I think that might be why they didn't dry out like some people are complaining about. Leave the lid on - don't let the moisture escape!
As the recipe is posted, I give it 4 stars. Some very minor adjustments make this a 5-star recipe that I would serve to company.

Made this today and I really enjoyed it. Very flavorful and easy but I cooked on it on low for almost 7 hours and thought they were a little dry.. Will absolutely make this again, though, just not cook it for so long.

I made these tonight and what an easy, delicious recipe!  I followed the directions as stated, using boneless pork chops, and they turned out great.  They do have a mediterranean flare, but not too powerful.

This was great. I coupled it up with a Portobello mushroom gravy to top it with. Chops were so tender they were like butter. Just a little hint, try grilling the chops with mesquite first with a 1 1/2 to 2 inch chop T bone type, I used this dry rub for 8 hours before putting them on the grill,
    3 tablespoons sweet paprika, preferably Spanish
    1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
    1 tablespoon coarse salt, either kosher or sea salt
    3/4 teaspoon sugar
    3/4 teaspoon chili powder
    3/4 teaspoon granulated garlic or garlic powder
    3/4 teaspoon onion powder
    1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground cayenne

Tonight is the second time I made this. My husband and I absolutely love it. I did alter the recipe slightly by using 2 cups of chicken stock and added pepper. It's wonderful to have pork chops that fall apart. This is a new favorite!!

Easy and excellent.  I did alter by using less of the seasonings.  I added a large onion diced in larger pieces.  Very, very good.  My husband love it.

We made this the other night exactly as stated and our family loved it.  Our family though likes to have creamy sauces so next time we are going to add some cream cheese to the mix and possible a little parmesan and fresh mushrooms. This is one of those great recipes that you can eat as is or change it up very easily for a different taste

VERY tasty! First, I adjusted the amount of liquid because I was making twice the amount of pork chops. They were all boneless and at least an inch thick. Second, I tweaked it a bit just because I had some veggies that needed to be used before they went bad, so I added some baby carrots and an onion and layered the chops on top. Third, there were some mentions of the "gravy" being too thin, so before I added the meat, I dredged them in some seasoned flour (just salt & pepper)to thicken up the liquid as it cooked. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I thought there was too much oil. It made the gravy part a little greasy - but that's easily fixed. Next time, I'll just not double the amount of oil. Additionally, this is SO easy to prepare! If you don't have poultry seasoning, just add some rosemary, thyme and onion powder. I cooked it on high for about five hours and they came out deliciously tender. Will definitely make again - with less olive oil! :-)

I followed the recipe almost 100%....only one thing I changed was opt out of garlic powder and add one more garlic clove since I prefer to use fresh ingredients.  So, I think it is still fair to give this recipe rating.  We are only 2 people in our house, and I used 2 thin pork chops and added lots of veggies.  So, I kept exact amount the recipe calls for (4 servings).  I added 2 carrots (peeled but not cut), 2 stalks of celery (cut in half), 1 large onion (sliced really thick to keep its shape), 1 potato (roughly chopped).  I thickened soup and poured on pork shops.  To give a plate more color, I cooked fresh green beans and broccoli as well. Served with brown rice.  My hubby loved it and told me to keep the recipe! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and the pork chops came out so dry and tough to eat. I didn't want my husband to eat this when he came home from work. No way I am making this again!

Love this, but a few changes. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Deleted garlic powder, doubled fresh garlic, added finely chopped shallots, carrots and celery. Just before serving removed chops and added corn flour (1 tbl spoon to 1/2 cup of cold water) to liquid in crock, whisked the liquid added back chops and cooked another half hour. Severed with brown rice mixed through with mixed vegetables.

Flavor was okay and the meat shredded easily enough, but it was terribly dry. I have yet to make pork chops that didn't turn out dry. This was my last stab at it. Goodbye forever pork chops!

Fantastic! I was looking for something a little different than my husband's barbecued pork sirloin steaks (though those are always great as well), and ran across this recipe.  I alternated sauce and steaks to ensure some of the spices would be trapped in between.  When they came out they were falling apart and full of flavor.  

I took all of the meat out of the crockpot after cooking and emptied the remaining contents (unstrained) into a sauce pot and added water and flour to make a gravy which was served over garlic mashed potatoes.

A HIT!  My husband, father and daughter cleaned their plates and came back for more.  All that was left was a few cups of gravy which I froze on request for some future dinner.

I have this cooking in the crock pot right now.. Can't wait to try  it out.. I did brown the chops in a skillet first and then sauted some onions and garlic in the drippings and then deglazed the skillet with the chicken broth and added the rest of the ingredients to the skillet and poured it over the chops in the crock pot. I did not have any poultry seasoning so I used sage but I had all the other ingredients called for.. I will probably serve this with red new potatoes, fresh purple hull peas and home grown tomatoes.  Yum.. My mouth is watering all ready..Smells good and looks good.

Update..This was so good. We are having it for left overs tonight.

Fabulous! This was soooo easy and sooo good.  The only changes I made were that I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used thyme and sage and instead of canned chicken broth, I used the broth I in the freezer last time I boiled a chicken for a recipe.  I think it was 2 cups, but that worked well because the juice covered the chops. I don't have much time in the morning, so I prepared the chops in the crockpot and put them in the fridge the night before.  In a seperate bowl I put all the flavorings.  In the morning I just poured the flavorings over the chops and turned it on (med for 8 hrs). Definitely will use this recipe many more times.  I think next time I will trim most of the fat off the chops so there will be less grease.  I like adding the olive oil though because of flavor and the health benefits.

Fantastic!

Very seldom do I try a new recipe and adhere to the ingredients, but I did with this one -- and I wouldn't change a thing! The seasoning was perfect, and because of the types of ingredients (those with "color"), there was no need to brown the chops beforehand to get the desired coloring -- mine looked exactly like the picture accompanying this recipe.

Definitely a keeper recipe for me!

this was excellent! i did find it to be a little on the oily side so i tried to thicken it up with some cornstarch which did not really help. but it was still very good. even the picky 3 year old i watch gobbled it down. the sauce also made a great gravy for mashed potatoes.

very good recipe and different from the normal soup based recipes.  However I think I cooked my chops a little long because they were a bit dry.

These were ok.  They tasted good but were not memorable.  Couldn't use the cooking liquid for anything as it was just too oily but for a weeknight-I-have-no-ideas-and-love-my-crockpot kind of a day, this works.

Made this for a luncheon, and was not allowed to leave until I printed out a copy of the recipe for my two lunch companions. I seared my meat before placing it in the crockpot. I did not have poultry seasoning, so I used sage and thyme. This is going to become one of my regulars, thanks so much for a great recipe.

Smelled great when I came into the house after work, but it was sooooo dry.  This was my fault, as I made it and set it on low and then worked all day.  When making this recipe, if you follow the actual cooking time and basting instructions, it would probably be delicious.  Unfortunately, I use slow cookers so that I can come home to dinner, not so that I can stay at home and baste.

Five stars for sure.  Delicious, incredibly easy.  My husband gave it a thumbs up.  I didn't even include poultry seasoning because I was out of it and it was still tender and yummy.  I thickened juice with cornstarch for a gravy and served with mashed potatoes. Will definitely be making this again.

I  just didn't like this at all. It had a weird taste that doesn't appeal to me at all and even smelled bad to everyone in the house as it was cooking.  Not much flavor and there were alot of ingredients in this one!   I am looking for meals for  my picky family and I just assumed I would like it (I am not picky.. if its good i will eat it usually) and they'd be the tough ones to please but even I don't like this.

This recipe was "OK".  The meat didn't really have a ton of flavor, but the meat was so tender, it was falling apart when I tried to get it out of the slow cooker.

I made these for my dad and he absolutely LOVED them. They were tender and flavorful and paired with some mashed potatoes was a great meal :) I skipped the paprika and added more chicken broth so I could fully submerge the pork chops in my small crock pot. But other than that I didn't change a thing! Great recipe.

I loved that this recipe was so easy and I had all of the seasonings on-hand and the chops were very tender but the end result had an odd taste to me. I am still looking for the perfect slow-cooker pork chop recipe!

I used all the ingredients as listed BUT I used 8 boneless chops and placed them in a 9X13 pan.  Poured the mixture over top and baked in the oven, covered with foil, for 1 hour @ 350. For the last 10 minutes I cranked up the heat and removed the foil.  Yummy even from the oven and much faster if you come across this recipe later in the day!

Good stuff.. I had to toss in some onions and mushrooms too though.

Cooking time is pretty long here though.  I turned to low after hrs and ate it at 3hours and the pork was starting to dry out.

This Recipe is real good.... I sauted the garlic and chops together before adding to the slo cooker. I thickened the gravy afterwards with 1/4 cup flour mixed with 1/2 cup of cold water. Turned out Fabulous, Porkchops were a lil dry, but they were pretty thick. I just shredded them with the gravy and served them with the honey roasted red potatoes from this site. YUMMY

Tastes great and the chops are tender. I used Greek seasoning because I didn't have any poultry seasoning and it still works fine.

I decided to make pork chops in the slow cooker thinking it would be moist and tender, when they were done they looked wayyy too oily and greasy and the smell was not good at all. I didnt even bother trying a bite.

These were so tasty!  I may not ever make pork chops any other way.  And my house smelled fantastic...enough that while I was sitting on the front porch with my neighbors, they commented on the wonderful smells emanating from the house.  Made the pork chops on Monday night, it's Thursday and I am using this recipe to do chicken breasts.  The only changes I made were : I had no garlic (how does that happen!?) so subbed garlic powder. Also did not have poultry seasoning so I used a french herb roast rub that I had. I poured the olive oil into a pan and added all the herbs and browned the meat before I put it in the crock pot. I did not add any salt because I prefer to let people salt their own food, but it definitely needed it so I added it to my chicken tonight. Hopefully it turns out as well as the pork chops!  Sure smells great!

COOKED AS WRITTEN :) Very good everyone liked it. I combined some pork steaks with the chops both turned out the same. I mention cooked as written because of the number of people that don't try the recipe as written and make changes, because it doesnt fit into their concept of a recipe, that ultimately alter the end result making it an entirely different dish.  Going through the recipe. The additional powdered garlic seemed like it would be too much but it is not too much and is correct as written. It is not necessary to substitute with onion which would alter the end result.

Fork tender and tasty, but too much oil!  Next time I would reduce the oil to 2 tablespoons. I had a stalk of celery to use up, so I cut it in quarters and tossed it in for flavor. Thickened sauce with a slurry of cornstarch. Served with mashed potatoes and peas.

My family and I really loved these pork chops.  I did make a few changes.  I use a little less oil and added an onion into the slow cooker with the pork.  At the end my gravy was runny so I made a rue in a pan with canola oil and flour then added the gravy and simmered the pork chops a little while longer.  It was wonderful on top of egg noodles.  Thanks!

Really good slow cooker recipe. I let mine cook all day and the pork chops just fell apart. My kids all liked them as well. I did add more than one cup of chicken broth but that was really the only change I made.

This made very tender pork chops.  When I was assembling them, I thought the amount of spices was extreme, but I followed the recipe.  The spices worked great.  I did use a 15 oz can of chicken broth rather than a cup - it covered the chops a little better in my crock.

This recipe is excellent.  I thought it would be too much garlic,  Surprisingly, the garlic is not overpowering.  The pork is tender and delicious.

I rate this 4 stars because I modified it. I used one cup chicken cream and one cup of beef broth instead of 2 cups of chicken broth, I used less olive oil than what is written here and I added some potatoes in the mix!! I must admit it was simply delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!  Two thumbs up for the great recipe!!

I would rate this a five but my husband wasn't a fan of the seasoning. It was a little bland, even with all the spices, but the meat was so tender and yummy (and easy!). I added half of chopped onion, a chopped stalk of celery and a chopped carrot stick and frozen beans because I had them on hand. I put in a cup and a half of chicken broth after reading reviews. I also turned the pork over about half way through. I served this with stuffing and salad and it was pretty good.

Very tasty.  To use the excellent broth, I removed chops when done, and added cube of vegetarian bouillon and another cup of water along with potatoes, onions and carrots for an hour at high.  Then returned chops to warm and had entire meal that everyone loved.

Good recipe.  I added less oil than called for and enough broth to cover the chops.  I added extra amounts of the called-for seasonings near the end of cooking, and added cornstarch to thicken.  I cooked thin chops on low for 6 or so hours.  No wow factor with this one, but easy and good tasting.

Extremely tender! My brother said that we could do away with our knives :-) I didn't have poultry seasoning, so i substituted it with brown onion soup mix. We're having the leftovers tonight and this time I'll team it with spicy brown rice. Thanks for a gr8 recipe!

Super easy to make, very tender, very flavorful. Even my husband likes it and he is very picky when it comes to pork. My 4 year old also likes this dish. I served it with rice. Thanks!! I didn't have garlic powder so I used dried minced onion and 4 garlic cloves instead of 2. I also used bouillon powder instead of the poultry seasoning.

Pretty good recipe - I thought it was a bit oily, though, even though I added only a quarter of the oil suggested.  I don't really think any oil is needed at all.

My hubby and I loved these.  They were a nice change from our regular slow cooker pork chops.  Nice flavor; very very tender.  Only change I made was to leave out the oregano.  The basil was enough for us.

This was super simply to put together and turned out fork tender and delicious.  A few reviewers I noted had tough chops - be sure you are using thick cut shops - it makes all the difference in the world.  Thanks for sharing - these were fabulous!

Loved it!!  Great taste and very easy.  I will reduce, and maybe eliminate, the oil next time.  Thicken the liquid with some corn starch for gravy.  It goes great with some mashed potatoes or rice.

I rarely make pork chops b/c most of the time they are dry and my family hates that.When I found this recipe i thought I would give it a try. It is truly wonderful. When it was done they were so moist and tender that they almost fell apart taking them out. I have since removed some ingredients since the first batch only b/c the spices prove to be a little to strong for my kids. I use all ingredients but the poultry seasoning and oregano.

Good recipe but of course like any good cook I made my adjustments. I marinade the chops overnight with a pork rub (instead of the poultry seasoning) and the olive oil and garlic. Then in the morning I browned them and throw it in the slow cooker and sautee onions in the same pan and throw in the slow cooker. I had the basil and oregano but I had a nice herb mix seasoning so I used that instead (really you can play with all the herbs you want and never go wrong)Then I added the chicken broth (no exact measure, just enough to cover the chops in the crock pot) and added the paprika and very important I added half can of tomato sauce. Paprika alone don't do it for me for the color and consistency of the sauce so to me is very important to add the tomato sauce. The pork chops turned out yummy!!

Was delicious!  I added an equal amount of onion powder as was called for the garlic powder.  I did saute the garlic prior in olive oil which was suggested by an another reviewer.  In addition, I used extra chicken brother as was suggested.  I served this over white rice and it was a great hit!

This dish had great flavour and smelled wonderful.  I used less than 1/8 cup of olive oil and I will omit completely next time.  I used a whole can of chicken broth and thickened the gravy at the end to serve with potatoes.  Next time I will add onions and whole mushrooms.  I cooked as posted - 4 hours on high using nice thick boneless chops.

My husband said these were "incredibly tender". I liked them too, but think perhaps one more ingredient would have made them superb. The only change I made was that I used 1 full can of chicken broth, which freed me from basting, since they were totally submerged. Once done, I removed the pork chops and added corn starch to make a fuller gravy.

This is a fantastic recipe full of flavor!  Guests just love it too... and so does my husband!  This is on my tops list of meals to make.  The pork chops just fall apart.  

P.S. The current representative picture doesn't look anything like the end result...

Was looking forward to these chops because of the ratings. And, as others suggested, I halved the olive oil and doubled the remaining ingredients -used 5 chops. Made way too much sauce.  Cooked on low for about 11 hours (because work day). Pork was very tender, but we didn't care for the flavor.  Sorry, but won't be making these again.

I doubled the chicken broth as mentioned previously here and added some carmelized onions (about 1/2 cup).  I also saute'd the garlic in the olive oil as also was previously mentioned.  I thought they turned out great, very moist and flavorful.  Mine cooked in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours and were just fine.  I served these with brown rice.  I did not test these on the kids, they had already eten at Grandma's, but I think they would like them.

Great recipe!!!  I first tried these delicious pork chops  at a friend's house and had to ask for the recipe.  It's super easy and a great meal to prepare for guests.  Every time I make these pork chops they turn out juicy and yummy.

Good flavor and the meat was very moist, falling off the bone.  I liked the flavor.  The broth seemed a little greasy and I would use less oil next time.

I double the marinade for this recipe because it takes that much to cover the chops completely in my slow cooker. My husband says that these are the best pork chops he's ever had. I like them too, but I still prefer smothered pork chops. It's a nice change though.

Thicker the cut, the better. Otherwise it will dry out in the slow cooker. Also, I tried to stretch out the cooking time using the low setting. That didn't work very well.

I love this recipe.  I like it better without the poultry seasoning and either put the fresh garlic or garlic powder, not both.  My husband doesn't usually say a whole lot but loves this!

Delicious!  I used 4 bone in pork chops, hoping that the bone would help keep the moisture and not dry it out.  I also used a whole can of chicken broth and cooked on low heat.  YUMMY!  The combination of herbs sounded weird at first, but tasted great.  I would definitely recommend!

Try this only if you like an herbal flavor to your chops.  They turned out tender, but my family did not care for the flavor at all.  I would not recommend you try this on children.

This recipe was a hit for the 6 firemen at the firehouse. I am in charge of cooking on shift and decided to try this recipe. Well 4 thick pork chops wouldn't cut it so I made 8 1/2inch thick bone-in pork chops. Following the instructions and altering a bit made a great meal. We wouldn't have rated it a 5* but it was a GOOD recipe.

Followed the recipe, but did add balsamic vingear. Loved it as did my wife who usually finds these type of meals slightly oily, but she loved this one.

My husband LOVED this. It was so tender and I mixed sour cream into the drippings for a gravy type sauce. My slow cooker is super fast, so after an hour on high I checked it and it was already looking done... so I had to turn it to low for the remaining 3 hours or else it wouls have been too tough... and it turned out perfect!

This is a fantastic recipe,especially with fresh herbs (so easy to grow).  Next time I'll thicken the sauce (maybe with cream) to go over pasta or rice. Easy and very delicious even as is.

I did the recipe exactly as shown, and it looked great when I pulled them out.  With the first fork into the meat, I thought "awesome!, coming right apart without a knife".  But then I took a bite and realized it was too dry.  I might try it on low for a few hours next time because the flavor is really good and this is too easy to get it to work somehow!

Best and easiest slowcooker pork chop recipe I have had yet. I added a sliced onion or a little extra flavor as well. Since I wasn't home all day, I started it early in the morning on low and it was perfect and tender when I got home 8 hours later.

We really enjoyed this meal. We did add fresh green beans and carrots for the last hour. Served it with Jasmine rice. Leftovers did not last the next day. We will certainly make this one again.

There was one thing i changed about this recipe. i could not find any thick cut pork chops at the grocery store, but they had porterhouse chops on sale. so i bought those instead. fast forward to the second time. thick cut pork chops are on sale at the grocery store. make it a second time. Guess the first time was a happy accident. cutting the bone out of the porterhouse style chops is the way to go. They have more fat so they absorb more flavor, and are juicier, more flavorful and delicious.

Turned out pretty darn good. I had thinner cut chops so I cooked on low for four hours and didn't baste. After complete I took the remaining liquid and transferred it to a saucepan and reduced it on high heat. Poured over the chops and a bed of basmati rice. My four year old had 2 servings.

Fabulous recipe! I did use 2 cups of chicken broth, but only so I could use it to cook some frozen broccoli & have some left over to make broth. Other than that, I didn't change a thing.

Easy and flavorful!  I usually only cook 2-3 thick chops, so I adjust the ingredients downward a bit.  I like to add 1/4 cup of Marsala wine and some sliced mushrooms (for the husband) into the broth.  My crockpot cooks overly hot, so I usually cook these 2 hours on high then finish up on low or warm for another hour or so.

The first time I made I was cooking for a recovery home and made 16 pork chops with four times the recipe. The second time I made it I doubled the recipe and made it with a 2 pound pork loin. Both times it turned out great. The first time I made it I cooked it on low for 8 hours woth medium cut boneless pork chops. It was so tender you could cut it with just a fork! When I made the pork loin I cooked it on high for 3 hours and low for the last 2 hours. As it was cooking I basted it with the sauce. I will definately be using this recipe again and again. Both times I served it over rice. I highly recommend this dish!

The pork chops came out wonderful! Very tender and could be cut with a fork. My only con to this meal, was it seemed as though the oregano overpowered the taste of everything else. So, I will make this in the future, maybe cutting back on the oregano.

Easy and tasty!  Next time I'll leave out the oil because I don't think it is necessary.

Turned out great my fiancé  loved  it !! I just cut olive in half and made up the difference with balsamic and put half a cup more of chicken broth. Also added cornstarch the last 10 min. Served over rice and snow peas.

I made this and it was simple and delicious. I don't like to cook so I made Brussel sprouts with it and a bag of Cajun rice (pre- packaged). It was a great meal. It was done on time. My only change was I didn't add garlic powder cause there was already garlic in the receipt so I used onion powder and I reduced the amount of oil just a little and I increased the chicken broth to 1&1/2 cups so I didn't have to baste it. Will make again for sure!

This was very, very tasty and tender! I agree with one review to go lighter on the oil. Also, need to be careful which poultry seasoning is used as it could make this slightly too salty coupled with the broth. Will make again!

This was such an easy and delicious way to serve pork chops!  I wish I had thickened the sauce to use as gravy.  I will definitely do that next time.  I didn't measure any of the ingredients..just sort of eyeballed them.  I can't wait to try this on a small pork roast.  Thanks for the new "pork go to"!

This recipe is amazing - so tasty, tender and easy!  It will become a regular in our family's menu plan.  I cooked on low over 8 hours and doubled the chicken broth, as others recommended.  I'll cut the olive oil in half next time, as it was a little too oily.

I've written a review for a recipe before and I have used several from this site. These pork chops are amazing!! They are tender, flavorful and absolutely succulent. The only change I made to this recipe was to add onions. I made pasta from the leftover  juice as a side dish. This recipe is a must try!!

My 10 month old daughter LOVED these pork chops, and so did everyone else! I made  the recipes as is, only I browned the chops and I cooked them in the oven at 200 degrees for four hours. Will make these again!

The sauce in this recipe is delicious. I ended up only needing to cook them for about an hour and a half, but that may just be a glitch in my crockpot. My very picky kids loved it and actually raved about the sauce, asking me to cook EVERYTHING in it. I'll be saving this one for sure.

I loved this. Made it using garlic salt instead of garlic powder. And doubled the chicken broth/stock. (used 2 cups instead of 1).

I used thinner cut chops, since that is what I had on hand. I used 7 thin chops. It did not take 4 hours on high, only about 3 hrs.

At the end, I added some corn starch and cold water (2 TBLS corn starch with a small amount of water) to thicken up the gravy. I let that sit in the crock on high while I finished the rice & sides.

Served over Basamati Rice with roasted broccoli as a side.

It was an easy delicious meal. A good change of pace to my usual pork chop recipe. I will make again.

Although my husband did comment that he thought the meat was dry...and then I told him it was pork chops and he said, "oh ok. That's why". (He had thought it was a chicken dish)

this was very good.. i took some suggestions by MAINEMOM and used the 2 cloves of garlic and subbed onion powder for the garlic powder.. only 2 tsp.. for the dried herbs i used the 1 tbsp of italian season as suggested and then reduced the poultry seasoning to 1 tsp.. left out the olive oil.. doubled the chicken broth (bouillon).. sprinkled a bit of kosher salt and some pepper over it.. used almost 3 lbs of bone in, thinner sliced pork chops.. it was delicious.. ty for the recipe

OMG, I made this for diner tonight and it is awesome!!!  The pork was so tender and had tons of flavor.  It is now one of my favorite pork recipes.  It does have a lot of spices in it, but very easy to make.  When I first saw it, I almost did not take a look at it since it had so much in it.  I am glad I went a head and read it.  It didn't even take me 5 minutes to prepare.  It is a must try.

This was a huge hit at my house. Followed the recipe exactly but I wasn't home to baste the chops. No biggie, still delicious! I hate pork chops usually but my husband lives them so I caved. I served this with mashed potatoes and veggies. I used the powdered pork gravy mix but instead of water used the drippings from the slow cooker. Amazing! The family loved it and I thought it was pretty darn good too.

Very tender and tasty.  I used onion powder instead of garlic powder, but used 4 cloves of garlic. I also used more chicken broth to cover the chops and added half more of the dry ingredients.  I was at the pool and did not want to come in and turn the chops!  I removed the chops when they were finished, placed the liquid in a saucepan, boiled for a few minutes and added a cornstarch water slurry to thicken. Served with sweet and sour green beans and garlic mashed potatoes.  Yummy!

I think it is excellent! As I do not have a slow cooker, I used an oven-proof ceramic pot instead. Also, in this country there is no ready-made chicken stock so I made some using a chicken cube. I followed the rest of the instructions to the letter and it came out perfect. The meat was indeed very tender, excellent for Mother who has just turned 93!
Thank you very much for the recipe! Cristina

I increased this recipe by a half since I had 6 pork chops. I used bone in chops. They were excellent!  I served them with buttered noodles and broccoli rabe. Fell off the bone! Yum!!!

My family fought over these, and there was none left over. I doubled the recipe for 10 chops and it turned out absolutely perfect. The only thing I left out was the vinegar (my husband doesn't like it). The chops were so tender we had to take them out of the crock pot with a spoon because they were falling apart. Best pork chops I've ever had.

I tried this recipe out of sheer laziness.  I only started making pork chops a year or so ago and while the recipe I have been using is fantastic, it is labor intensive/time consuming.  That just wasn't in the cards today.  I had all of the ingredients on-hand for this one (which suggests that we would like them) so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  It took all of 3 minutes to whisk the seasonings together and throw everything in the crock.   I must have heard at least 10 times how delicious they smelled while they were cooking and the end result was no different...SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  They were super moist and fell apart while fishing them out of the crock.  

I pretty much stuck to the original recipe  - I was out of oregano so I substituted Italian seasoning and cut the basil in half, used Old Bay Seasoning as the poultry seasoning and 2 tsp minced garlic rather than mincing fresh cloves.  My husband absolutely LOVED these and they were oh-so-easy.  

I served the chops with a long grain wild rice medley boiled in a mix of 1/2 water & 1/2 of the drippings from the crock pot, as I was unsure of how strong the seasoning would be. The rice had a nice flavor and was not overly seasoned.  I might even try making it with 1/4 water & 3/4 drippings next time.  Recommended cooking time was spot on for my Rival Smart-Pot crock pot (I think it's a 5-qt).  

Thank you for sharing this recipe - it's nice to find another yummy pork chop recipe that doesn't turn out like a rubber dog toy!  :)

This is a terrific recipe for pork chops. Easy and full of flavor. What I loved most is that I followed the recipe exactly as stated and I didn't need to make any adjustments - perfect as is. So often the reviews written on a recipe list changes made to make it "better" resulting in a completely different recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe. It's very easy to make and best of all the whole family enjoyed it.

This is my go-to recipe for pork chops in the crock pot because I always have the ingredients on hand! I have probably made this recipe 10 times. :) The pork always turns out extremely tender. I usually use a little less olive oil because I've found it doesn't need quite that much especially with the chicken broth. I usually cook it on low for 6ish hours instead of on high because I am not home and it never dries out. It is great served over mashed potatoes or rice with the extra sauce.

We were VERY disappointed in this dish. The ingredients sound good, but they just don't mesh as well as expected.

This is the first recipe Ive ever rated......and what a great one to get me started!!!  I made this with 4 thin sliced chops cooked on low for about 6 hrs and it worked just fine but Id prefer a thicker chop next time so they don't completely fall apart. I added chopped onion to the mix as well(I love onion). After cooking the chops I removed them and added fresh snapped green beans to the gravy and cooked on high for a cple hours.....served everything over chicken rice. The secret is the gravy here and will use it to slow cook veggies, chicken, and whatever else comes to mind!!! Thank you for enticing my taste buds! yum!

This recipe smelled fantastic. It was really tender. But, for all the spices and flavors that went into this recipe, it came out REALLY bland. I was hoping for more flavor. On paper, this looks great. In the crock, it looked tasty. On the plate, where it really counts, it came up lacking.

Just made these tonight.  Oh my goodness, the recipe was great, I used the same slow cooker as in the video as well.  I did double the recipe and made 7 boneless pork chops.  Took some of the scraps and made a mushroom gravy out of it and it finished it off to make the best pork chops ever.  My family said:

1) You got to make this more (13 son that rarely eats meat, and he another half pork chop);
2) These are the best pork chops I have ever had (husband);
3) When I have friends over, this is what I want you to make (16 year old daughter);
4) Perfect, melt in your mouth, beautiful and rich (18 year old daughter).

Thick cut pork chops are so expensive, so I bought a 9 pack of regular cut.  I have an old round slow cooker, so 6 of the chops were submersed in the liquid, and 3 were half submersed.  It was still really good.  My husband said it was well seasoned, which he almost never says!  And he said it was a keeper.  (I also used the entire can of chicken broth.)

I made this tonight exactly as written and they were amazing!! It was so tender and tasty. I have never been able to make pork chops that were not dry and trust me, these are NOT dry! My family absolutely loved them and even my pickiest eater ate two of the pork chops himself! The only change I made to the recipe was to double it because there were 8 of us eating. The house smelled incredible while they cooked. I will definitely be making this again, and again, and again! Like one reviewer said they are so tender that you can cut through them with a fork and that was true! This is a must try recipe. You will not be disappointed! Thank you Erinvdix for this great recipe!

Turned out great -- will keep this to make again regularly as it is an easy family dinner. I used smoked paprika and it was awesome. 
Also -- it came out looking cooked and pretty (with all the paprika and spices). Not like some other slow cooker recipes where the meat looks pale and boiled. Nice easy recipe.
And I used a very cheap thick cut chop and it was moist.

The only good thing I can say is that they did smell delicious while they were cooking, on the other hand that only added to the disappointment! These looked very unappealing and tasted worse. It somehow managed to taste oddly herby yet bland at the same time. The chops themselves while easy to cut through were dry and tasteless. Tried to rescue it with some tomato paste, cumin, worcestershire, cayenne etc. but to no avail. Can't really understand all the great reviews.

I also think this recipe has earned its 5 stars. I caramelized some thick onion slices and the pork chops, deglazed the pan with a little white wine and added all that to the slow cooker along with extra broth. Made gravy and served it with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus.

These were heavenly. I cooked them for about 5-6 hours on low, and did the 2 cups chicken broth instead of just 1. It was so moist and tender, and the flavor was perfect. The husband loved it too. Will definitely make this again soon!

I decided the other day to get a Crock Pot--since I had never had one and I thought it would come in handy for summertime stuff when you didn't want to have the oven on.  

I tried these last night, did the recipe exactly as stated, and they were absolutely the worst pork chops I have ever had.  Completely ruined 2 perfectly fine boneless, center-cut chops.  Thank god I wasn't serving this to guests as I would have been mortified.  With over 500 reviews I was expecting something orgasmic.
 
I certainly would not recommend them.

#1, they were as dry as the Sahara.  They were tender, I will give you that, but that was it. The meat was completely void of any moisture at all.  

#2, I question the cooking method.  4 hours on HIGH?

My husband and I both loved these! I love using my slow cooker in the summer so it doesn't heat my house up and this was a perfect recipe. I did leave out the olive oil simply because I didn't have any and it was still delicious. Served it with a side of asparagus. Will use it again and again.

This recipe was great! The chops were tender and moist, and full of flavor. I'm allergic to paprika, so I used 1 tablespoon of onion powder instead. I cut the amount of oil in half and doubled the amount of chicken broth.  I used regular cut chops and slow cooked them for 6 hours on low. This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this for the first time today and we found it super tasty! If you like spicy, it's a great dish. Easy, too! I can see that doubling the liquid and cooking it for 2 hours would work just as well.

Loved this recipe, and it was super easy.  I thought it was a bit oily though, so I would reduce the oil next time--maybe just to one or two tablespoons.  I also didn't have poultry seasoning so I subbed 1 t sage and 2 t savory.  I served it with couscous and collard greens.  For the greens, I cooked them in some of the extra sauce from the pork chops.  I will definitely make again!

Since this had good and bad reviews, I decided to mix up the ingredients and taste it before I threw it in the crock pot with the pork.  I'm glad I did!  I poured it out and tried something else!

I have never been able to cook pork properly. It always comes out dry and yukky. I tried this recipe hoping it would be different and it was DELICIOUS!! Even my hubby who knows his way around a pig loved it. I didn't change much because everyone was raving about it. So I added more broth and I had to improv the spices because I was out of poultry seasoning. But it was amazing. So tender. Will definitely be making this one again! Thank you!

My 4 year old had 4 helpings!! My husband thanked me 3-4 time more than he normally does. He didn't add anything to his plate (usually he adds some kind of spice). I started with frozen pork chops, cooked it on high for 4 hours in the sauce. I was worried that not doing it on low for 8-10 hours would make for tougher meat. But it was soooooooo tender, fell right off our forks. I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and ommitted the additional salt & pepper. I also used Mesquite chicken seasoning, cause it was all I had on hand. And I used 2 cups of homemade chicken stock. I served it with rice & green beans. The sauce went great with both sides - I wish it had been a bit thicker, but the rice soaked it right up. I WILL make this again. VERY easy and was a hit with everyone!

I loved this!  I made it almost exactly like the recipe says with these changes: I used a whole can of broth instead of 1 cup to make sure the chops would be mostly covered while cooking and I think my chops were probably a bit thinner than the recipe wanted and were also bone in, so I cooked on low for 5.5 hours and when I went to take them out they were falling off the bone... so yummy and I love how simple and low calorie this is.

My family loved this.I read through the reviews and made some changes. I browned the pork chops in the olive oil first. I doubled the chicken broth. I also cooked it on low for longer the first time and high for the recommended time the second time. The first time was awesome and the second time was just good. My family doesn't really care for pork and other than the occasional ham or bacon, I was looking to add a couple of easy options. This is a delicious one with no leftovers!

Had to add an extra cup of chicken broth due to wanting to cover pork chops in crock pot. Made a nice gravy for the mashed potatoes I served with it. Was a BIG hit with the family!!

OMG this was a hit with my picky family too! I added fresh sliced mushrooms to it. I served it with rice that I cooked in chicken broth then poured some of the liquids from the pork over the rice! Wonderful I will make again

I made this and my husband and I both agreed that it was, by far, the best recipe I've ever used for pork chops. They just fell apart and they were SO very tasty.  My son and his fiancee' made it and agreed that it was amazing.  It's simple to make. The only changes that I made was that I didn't add paprika because my hubby doesn't like it, and I used a chicken bouillon cube in place of the poultry seasoning because I didn't have any on hand. I highly recommend trying this recipe. Delicious and easy!

Delish & tender!  My 16 year old son said he prefers fried pork chops so this is definitely more of an adult meal but I will make again when wanting something a little different.  I used 8 pork chops, the whole can of chicken broth & also through in some dried onion flakes along w/ the other ingredients. Also, I just used a couple tablespoons of olive oil & cooked on low for 7 hours. I thickened the sauce & turned it into a gravy w/ some mashed potatoes. The spices were perfect! Thanks for sharing.

We absolutely loved these!  I had no oregano so I left that out.  Still turned out great.  I thickened the sauce so it was more like gravy and served the chops over rice with the gravy poured on.  THe chops were tender and the flavor was great. My husband does not like chops and he really liked these.  Absolutely Delicous!

EDIT- Second time around these did NOT come out great.  We ate them without turning the liquid into a gravy.  They were still tender, but felt pretty dry in the mouth.  I think these definitely need a gravy.

Wow what a treat!  The pork comes out very tender and the sauce has an amazing fresh herbal flavor.  I added a tablespoon of flour to thicken it a bit but I think it would come out great without it.

Followed recipe except used pork roast cut into pieces. It does smell great while cooking but we found it to be very bland. Not sure what would help.

This is an excellent dish.  The only change I made was to decrease the amount of olive oil to 2T.  Next time, I would omit it completely.  The pork was fall-of-the-bone tender and even my young children liked it.  Made a quick roux to add to the drippings to make a delicious gravy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These are surprisingly great. The only things I did differently were chili powder as I had no paprika in the house and less garlic.

I love this recipe!  I don't have oregano so I tried Italian seasoning last time.  My husband thinks it was a little too flavorful so if you aren't into very strong spices, I would cut the amount on some of them.  I personally loved it.  I'm making it now and I left out the Italian seasoning this time so maybe that might help a little?

A flavorful dish that is a bit spicey.  Put chops in slow cooker while frozen but they still turned out  to be tender.

These chops have good taste and are easy to make.  The pork chops we get usually have the bone in so that's what I use.  Other reviews have said they cut down on the oil so I may do that next time.  I think they'll come out just as good.

We were not crazy about this recipe.  The spices didn't seem to be right....the sauce tasted a bit ashy and might have been better labeled as a pulled pork recipe.

Excellent and easy - my kind of cooking. This was a no fuss recipe with ingredients always on hand. Though I did not have poultry seasoning, I used Montreal Spice seasoning for chicken. A few changes - I cooked this for 5 hours on low and  thickened the gravy with a tablespoon of cornflour and cooked on high for 10 minutes at the end. A sure winner, to be repeated many times.

I was really excited about this recipe as I wanted to try one that didn't have a cream soup in it.  It smelled sooo good while cooking.  However when we sat down to eat I was so disappointed.  With all the seasonings that went into it I expected more flavor. I thought this was bland and kind of dry.  I will not be making this again.

I was a little worried about so much seasoning in this recipe, but it was very good!  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I made my own following another recipe from here.  I only used 3 pork chops and added a little more liquid.  Cooked on low for almost 8 hours.  The savory reduced liquid made quite a nice gravy and the pork for fork tender.  I think next time I'll try it with chicken.

This was excellent and will be added to out list for the normal dishes we make. I used some of the suggestions from previous reviews and changed the garlic powder to onion and added much more chicken broth because my crock pot is very large. Great recipe!

Overall very, very good but I found the sauce too greasy even after trimming all fat from the chops (I used thick semi-boneless ones).  Next time I will skip the olive oil and add a can of stewed or diced tomatoes with their juices.

This recipe is very WEIRD!  The flavors just don't go well together.  I followed the recipe almost exactly- the only thing I did different was add a few extra garlic cloves and an onion.  Both of which I couldn't even taste.  Other reviewers are correct when they say the herbs are way too overpowering.  For me it was the poultry seasoning.  That's all I can taste!!  The cooking times are also off.  Mine were falling apart after 2.5 hours on high.  My husband complained about them being dry- maybe it's because the recipe calls for poking holes in the pork?  I've always been told not to do that with meats because it lets the juices out.  The sauce is a nice consistency, but again, it just tastes like poultry seasoning.  This is an over-rated recipe IMHO, and for those who plan to try it- have a back up plan for dinner.

Followed the recipe exactly and wasn't impressed. So many spices, but not a whole lot of flavor. There are better pork chop recipes out there so I recommend not wasting your time!

My family loved the meal, however I made a few changes.  I browned country style pork ribs in a tablespoon of olive oil.  Transferred the meat into a crock pot.  Pan fried one onion and a couple cloves of garlic in whatever oil was left in the pan.  Transferred it into crock pot.  I took the advice of another reviewer and made gravy from the sauce.  I only took 2 cups of sauce to make the gravy b/c there's lots.  Be sure to sift the sauce so you don't have lumps in your gravy. YUMMY!!!

These were so good and easy to make.  I thought I had over cooked them at first, but they came out fork tender and juicy.  I will definitely make these again.

We aren't really pork eaters so I figured I would try something different. Well usually I make about 3 different dinners at dinner time & this time I only made one, everyone loved it, my family said its a keeper. the only change I did was I used half the olive oil, like other reviews advised.

I'm surprised at all of the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and it was greasy and sour-tasting from the combination of spices. The only good part was that the meat was tender from the crock pot. I will not be making this again. My mother's comment was that it was "interesting."

I was really excited to make this recipe, always looking for ways to make pork chops, but it was disappointingly bland, almost no flavour, and I am okay eating bland foods in general.  The ingredients seemed perfect to make flavourful pork but I think pork is just meant to be bland.  It smelled terrific though!  I think I will just stick to breading my pork chops and baking them, it gives it slightly more flavour, and maybe the crispier texture makes it seem less bland.  I really really want to like this recipe though!!

Turned out moist & tender. I did add more broth like the others had suggested, more garlic and onions and followed the recipe. It was easy and would make again. I actually shredded the pork & added the pork and juice to grilled zuccini, grilled sweet corn, cooked brown rice & topped it with parmesan. This pork shredded so easily that you could eat it alone or use in other dishes like tacos with the leftovers.

This was a great dish!  My extremely picky husband and son both loved it, though I made minor changes.  I coated the chops in a little flour to thicken the sauce, and cooked on high for only 3 hours.  Next time I will cut back on the poultry seasoning, it was a bit too strong for my taste, but the texture of the chops was great and the sauce very tasty.  Went great with mashed potatoes!  Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious!  I took the Mediterranean idea that a few other reviewers mentioned, and ran with it by adding 1/2 cup white wine in place of 1/2 c chicken broth (I used 2 cups liquid instead of the 1 cup), and I added some orange zest.  I really think those two additions upped the ZING and made this a truly exotic little dish.  :)

Very interesting blend of spices.  Next time (if there is a next time), I will cut back on the oregano.  That is all I could taste!  I have had WAY better pork chop recipes.

I did  basically the same, except omitted oil, and doubled the broth and garlic.  I also added a half a can of italian style tomatoes, with juices.  Then when done in 8hrs on low,  I served them over noodles.   Very italian.   Very good.

5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 !!!! These were incredible! I just finished eating these and they were wonderful! They smelled so good that I actually left the house just so I could come back and smell them new again.  Since getting into using my slow cooker I have found that many recipes have the promise of thorough good taste and may even smell great but fall short on flavor, not so with these.  THANK YOU for this recipe, it's definitely a new favorite. I only made two tiny changes: as many others did I flipped the chops twice during cooking time.  I also only did three smaller but thick chops and they were fully cooked in three hours on high.  Thanks again for these great chops, I can't wait to make them for my boyfriend when he gets home.

I cook for a large group of guys for my job and I tried this recipe as is and it turned out horribly. You could cut the pork chops with a fork but they were so dry I should have just thrown them away. I even made sure to take steps to keep them from drying out. I will not make these again.

We just didn't like the flavors and the texture.  Followed the recipe as stated, and had really nice thick pork chops but the seasoning left the pork tasting like fish.  Was a great disappointment to us on a Friday night, end of week dinner.

We weren't thrilled with these pork chops.  They were dry.  I did what some previous people did and decided to cook them on low for 8 hours instead of high for 4 hours.  They seemed done after only 4 hours on low.  I tried to find the thickest pork chops possible.  Maybe they weren't thick enough.  Besides being dry, I didn't care for the seasoning.

So good and you don't have to stick to all the spices and can add similar spices and still come out a great taste.  Tender and delicious, easy to make!

There aren't enough stars.  This was made exactly as the receipe indicated as I try to do the first time.  So glad I did - there isn't a thing I could change to this fork tender pork chop- I used sirloin pork and you just gotta try it - you would if you could see the smile on my face as I just finished eating.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE.

Driest, toughest meat ever!!  I was skeptical about cooking porkchops, which are already prone to dryness, for 4 hours - even covered in broth.  But after reading the previous reviews I thought I'd give it a try.  I should have trusted my instincts!

I am not a pork chop fan, but my husband is.  It was so tender, i had trouble getting it out of the crockpot! It was actually really good! This will probably be the way I make pork chops from now on.  Thanks!!

Very tender pork chop recipe!  I agree with other comments that this has a very mediterrean taste to it.  I also added a can of stewed tomatoes to the crock pot and at the last 45 minutes of cooking, I added a can of green beans, served it with basmati rice.  It reminded me of a dish I had in a Greek restaurant.  The gravy is delicious.  Will make this again.

I am not a real big fan of pork chops, always find them to be dry and pretty much tasteless, however, we made these tonight and they are wonderful.  Very moist, tender.  You don't even need a knife to cut it.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I wanted to find a new recipe to cooking porkchops and came across this one. I love the mediterranean taste from all the spices and the meat is so tender is basically falls apart. If I dont have actual garlic cloves, I just use garlic powder, which works just as fine. Cut up some onions and celery and throw them in there and serve with rice, or even couscous, and its just a wonderful dinner!

This was the first Slow Cooker recipe for Pork that my husband loved!!!  Not to mention two 4 yr. old boys!  I did add carrots the last hour of cooking, instead of 1Tbs of garlic powder- I used 1.5 tsp of garlic powder, and 1.5tsp of onion powder, and reduced the olive oil.  Next time I am completely omitting the oil.  My family already wants me to make it again on this week's menu.

These were definately melt in your mouth tender!  I used bone-in pork chops and they were literally falling off the bone...   I sauteed oinions and garlic and layed them at the bottom of the slow cooker before putting the pork chops in.  I doubled the chicken broth and used all the seasoning suggested... added a dash of balsamic vin.   I cooked it on low for 7 hours.   I tried adding potatoes in at about the half way point but I found that the strong herbs are a little to overwhelming for the potatoes so wouldn't recommend that.  I'd go with other vieweres suggestion for rice or mashed potatoes as a side vs. trying to add potatoes or veggies to the pot.  The meat will be the star of the meal with this recipe - definately a tasty recipe to try!!

Made this last night as a quick dinner for my husband and the pork came out so tender and the broth flavored with the meat juices and the seasonings was delicious as well.. I used the leftover broth to make couscous to serve alongside.  I will definitely make again!

It was okay. There's something about it I can't quite put my finger on that I wasn't too stoked about it. It was moist- that was a plus. But way too oily. I used less than 1/2 the amt called for, and I def think it could've gone without.

These truly were 'fork'-chops! I used a whole can of broth & a sprinkle of crushed red pepper (instead of paprika), but otherwise followed the recipe. I served it w/ rice cooked w/ some of the liquid as well as some green beans cooked w/ some of the liquid. It was a great meal - even my 20 month old loved it!

Excellent change of pace in cooking pork chops. I browned the chops in a little olive oil before putting in the crockpot and also increased the chicken broth by a cup. Served with garlic mashed potato's! Excellent meal!

I thought this was great! I did add a bit of balsamic vinegar but that was it. I think next time instead of cutting the O.O. like some people suggested, I'll leave it as the recipe calls for. I also browned the chops first, put them in partially frozen, cooked on low for 3 hours, then left them on the warm cycle for 4-5 hours. They came out moist and delicious. I will definitely be using this recipe over and over again!

Very good and easy to make.  I did follow a suggestion to double to broth.  I also did not use the Paprika and I added a dash of Lemon Juice.  Leftovers were very good also and I usually don't like leftovers.  Will definitely make this again.

Really, really delicious. The only thing I changed was that I cooked it in the slow cooker on low, rather than high, for 5 hours and they came out perfectly. Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

I loved this recipe. I did keep the slow cooker on low though. The juice was so good, I threw in some flour at the end to create a gravy. The gravy was delicious and I spooned it over our potatoes and peas. I will make this again.

Made this today for the husband. Served it with home made mashed potatoes and some steamed asparagus. We both enjoyed it. This is the second time I have made it. The first time actually came out way better though. They were a little dry today.

This was a great recipe! It was tender and tasty and my husband loved it! I made a few minor alterations to accomodate what I had in the kitchen. I recalculated the recipe to 2 servings and used 2 butterfly cut boneless pork chops. Instead of poultry seasoning, I used Soul Seasoning and omitted the basil. I also used 3/4 can of chicken broth instead of 1/4 can. It was easy and had plenty of sauce for our mashed potatoes! It fell apart when we touched the chops with our fork. Great idea! I never thought to put pork chops in the slow cooker before. I will definitely make this again for our family and will serve it at dinner to others in the future!

Delish!  I didn't use the oil, though, as I'm trying to cut down on fat.  I just upped the broth the extra amount and towards the end, I stirred in a little fat free sour cream to make a yummy gravy.  These go well with egg noodles, rice or potatoes!  Definitely not the ordinary crock pot recipe!

This recipe was ok.  I may have left it on too long.  It needed more liquid but overall it was ok for a slow cooker recipe.

I thought the garlic taste was overpowering so I would recommend removing the additional garlic powder.  My husband liked it, but he will eat almost anything!

Very good! I think I would cook for 8 hours on low instead of 4 on high next time to make them more tender. Excellent flavor and I really like the gravy on brown rice as well. I used 1 1/2 times the amount of water and half the olive oil. I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I left it out. I will definately make this again.

These porkchops had a nice mediterranean taste that my husband was raving about. The meat was very tender but also a bit dry, and I doubled the broth.  Next time I will triple it.  I omitted the poultry seasoning as recommended by other reviewers and I added some red pepper flakes. Came very spicy, so I won't be adding any additional spices to the original recipe next time either.  Overall it was very good and different from the usual boring pork chop recipes, and super easy too.

This was just ok.  A little dry and I used the thick cut pork chops.  I cooked on high for 3 hours and low for 1 hour.  I made gravy out of the remaining liquid by mixing corn starch and milk together then slowly adding to the crockpot.  This helped with the dryness of the chops.  I probably will not be making this again because my family was not crazy about it.  Thank you for the recipe anyways.

Good, not as much flavour as I would have liked. My husband still coated it in hot sauce. I know I have a winner when he doesn't. May try it again without the poultry seasoning and possibly something else.

Not my favorite pork chop recipe.  Seemed a little tasteless and bland.  The meat was very tender but I probably will not try this again.

This recipe was okay, but not great.  I loved that it was so quick to prepare, but would cut the poultry seasoning in half or leave it out entirely.  It over powered the taste of everything else.  The pork chops were moist, and like most slow cooker meat very very tender.  I'd make it again, but with the change I mentioned about the seasoning.

Wonderful flavors are bursting in my mouth as I reveiw this recipe!

Outside of recalculating  for the 3 thick boneless chops I had, I followed the recipe to a tee + added approximately a 1/2 cup of some leftover sauerkraut.

I cooked mine on high for one hour, low the next, high again the next & back to low for the final hour.  Switched the setting over to keep warm while I made some buttred garlic egg-free noodles and french style green beans.

The chops came out absolutley juicy and tender as promised but,  a little too salty for my liking so next time, I'll omit the salt to season the chops.

Oh yeah,  I added all the ingredients to the crockpot to avoid making an unneccessary dish and, I browned the chops very lightly before adding them to the pot.

Everyone really needs to give this recipe a try!!!

Thanks Bunches 4 Posting It!

Shoulder chops browned and only cooked for 4 hrs were dry.  Flavor was not impressive.  I would guess that only well marbled chops with fat would be more tender.

Very tasty!  Made changes based on what I had and other reviews - 

No oil
Beef Broth instead of Chicken (whole can)
Season All instead of Poultry Seasoning
Added some chopped onion.

Thickened gravy with some corn starch and served over mashed potatoes.  Husband loved it!!

Very good and different than the traditional cream sauces that you make in the crock pot. 
My son ate it up! The changes that I made were roasting the garlic before adding and I put very little oil in it (about 1T) I cut up some red potatoes and cooked them with the porkchops.  Because of the potatoes I wanted more sauce, so I used an entire can of chicken broth and added about 1/2 cup of white wine for more flavor.  It was wonderful!

Excellent recipe - great for a busy mom.  I put this in the slow cooker before work and when we were ready to eat in the evening...it was ready.  Great, tender pork chops - very flavorful.  I have made this a few times and it is great every time!  Easy and tasty.

No good.  I did not like this at all.  Almost wanted to throw it away and order pizza.  The texture was too fish-like for me.  Two stars only because my boyfriend said it was "pretty good", but then again, he'll eat anything.

Incredible! Do not use the olive oil, big mistake. I made roasted potatoes and roasted carrots and Onion. This is by far the best pork I have ever experienced. I also cooked it for 8 hours, and made gravy from the drippings, and wished I could make more to freeze. The gravy was divine. Don't hesitate to make this, no disappointments at all. Even my picky eater ate it and wanted more.

My husband loved this recipe.  At least three times, he told me that we needed to save this recipe to use again.  I especially loved how easy it was to make!  I did leave out the olive oil based on some reviewers' comments.  My young son ate all of his too.

I made this for dinner today with lemon and coriander couscous and orange glazed carrots, for myself and 3 kids and it had mixed reviews. My 12 year old son and I thought it was delicious but my 6 and 7 year olds ate some but weren't sure if they'd want it again. The fact they ate any of it is still good though, as they don't like pork! 
The only change I made to the recipe was to omit the oregano as I didn't have any. 
I thought the pork turned out wonderfully soft and juicy with loads of flavour. I'll definitely make this again, but just for me and my son next time! 
Thanks for sharing this recipe! I'm always on the look out for new slow-cooker ideas.

i liked the ease of preparation, and the chops turned out tender and juicy, but the flavor was just not quite to my taste.  i, my husband and our 7-year-old agreed that it was okay, but we would prefer a little different flavor.  i think i'll try this again and experiment with the spices.

Throw this on top of some white rice, add some veggies & new potatos on the side... and its excellent. We eat this here all the time. Its great if youre a mommy like me and cant spend an hour doing nothing but cooking. I throw all this togteher in a matter of minutes, and just lightly stir every hour or so.

My whole family loved this and the house smelled wonderful while it cooked.  I have to say that I did not make this for a while even though I saved the recipe because the picture looks so unappealing.  I saw a review that said that the picture was not a good representation and decided to give it a whirl.  I am so glad I did, this is a definate keeper!

This was pretty good.  Its definately a meal I will make again but not one of those meals that I can't wait to make again.  I like others doubled the ingredients and only used 1/8 cup oil.  I served it with couscous which was a really nice side dish to pair it with.  Thanks for another addition to my recipe book.

I followed the recipie exactly. The sauce smelled so good while it was cooking. The pork chops were tender and fell apart- but they seemed kind of bland and dry. I had to keep loading on the sauce so I could eat it. Might be better with chicken but will not make with chops again.

I followed the advice of others and doubled the chicken broth (and then added another half cup more because I threw in 6 pork chops but kept the recipe the same). I also cut up fresh mushrooms and onion and layered those in with the pork chops. I served this to my dad and boyfriend and they both thought it was great. I used the mushrooms and onions as garnish instead of the broth and so they weren't too oily and the flavor was nice and light. I would definitely make this recipe again.

although the prok chops were tender, they were dry and overdone. I also think this was more bland than I had expected. I will not be making this again. I really thought based on the other reviews that this would have tasted better

I'm not a huge pork chop fan but this was really good.  It would also work with chicken, which I may try next time, but the flavor was very good!  And simple!

These are tasty chops. As someone else already mentioned, they were so tender that they were falling apart (DELICIOUS!). I'm trying to minimize my intake of fat, though, so next time I will trim all fat off the chops and reduce the oil by half. I highly recommend these, though. They're very easy and very good.

This was a good recipe, my 6 and 8 yr old ate it and wanted more. The pork chops were very tender. I altered it just a little by adding more chicken broth and cooking on low for 12 hours. Overall I give this recipe an A.

I did not like this recipe at all.  By judging the ingredients, I thought it was going to turn out wonderful.  I did cut down on the amount of olive oil because I thought it to be a bit much, but unfortunately that didn't even salvage the recipe.  The end result was very greasy, the flavor was gross and the chops were dry (even though I basted).  Sorry!

I put this in the crockpot because I knew I would be working late and my husband doesn't cook.  When I got home I was told how wonderful the pork tasted.  Actually, it was so tender they made sandwiches out of them.  Will definately make again.

It didn't take nearly as long as the recipe called for. I cooked it for 2 hours and it was already done. It was good then, but when it was dinner time it was very dry. I may try it again, but reduce the cooking time.

These were great.  I put all the ingredients together the night before and poured it over the pork in the morning.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours just because that worked for my schedule.  The pork was tender and falling apart.  I will be making these again.

I followed the recipe exactly - (except for the poultry seasoning which I didn't have on hand).  The chops were tender and tasty.  I can't wait to make them again with the poultry seasoning added in.  Super easy.  Thanks for sharing.

This was very good. The chops fell apart, very tender! It was a little oily, I added a little extra chicken broth and omitted the parsley.

This was pretty good.  I used thin pork chops because that is all I had, but I didn't cook them the full time.  I was also out of poultry seasoning so I added some ground cumin and seasoning salt.  They turned out a little spicy, but we like spicy food.  Kiddo's liked it and commented that they did not taste like pork chops.  Great for a night when there is more than one practice or game.

Very tasty pork chops.  Ends up being a very herby taste which is nice for a change. They ended up cut with a fork tender and not at all dry.  If someone ended up with dry chops, I'd say that they weren't thick enough or were cooked too long.  Served it along with broccoli casserole (on this site also), and a fresh fruit salad. Mmmmmm!

This recipe turned out fantastic!  The pork chops were very tender.  The sauce was delicious, it smelled great cooking all day.  I used it on pasta.  I did use less oil, and seasoning salt instead of poultry seasoning.  I cooked the chops on low for 8 hours, maybe a little too long, but couldn't be helped.  My daughter that doesn't like meat didn't like the chops too well, but loved the sauce on her noodles.

My husband said he didn't like this at all.  To me, it was missing something, maybe a tomato sauce or something.  The broth was kinda greasy after cooking the chops.  I would at least recommend removing the grease before pouring the broth over rice or anything else.

I used 6 small boneless pork chops, 4 cloves of crushed garlic, and substituted onion powder for garlic powder.  I cooked in the crockpot on low for 6 1/2 hours. It was delicious and I will do it again. I also want to try it with chicken or fish.

This is a keeper.  I love pork chops.  My wife is not a big fan.  She loved this recipe. I will do it again in a few weeks.

It was okay.  I had some chicken broth that I had made myself, which I thought would make it tastier, but in general - just not enough taste.  Put some BBQ sauce on as we ate it.  Don't think I will make this one again.

Not bad; but not really good either. Sorry, this combination of seasonings just didn't spark joy for me. The meat was nicely tender though.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY. If you do not like spices; this recipe is NOT for you. However, for those  with a more challenging palate.....there are no words for a fork tendered pork recipe.

I made it with french cut pork chops and it came out very tender.  I put slices of fresh tomatoes and onions on top  while cooking.  When done, I strained the liquid, put it in a sauce pan,  thickened it with corn starch for a gravy.  I served the chops and gravy over egg noodles.

This recipe is a definite keeper. I made this last night and it was great. A little too much poultry seasoning otherwise it’s a 5* meal with brown rice and mixed veggies. Next time I’m cutting the poultry seasoning to 1tsp instead of 1tbsp.
I didn’t have regular olive oil but I did have some roasted walnut infused olive oil. Don’t know if that made a difference or not, since I have never made this before. I strained the juice and made gravy for pouring over the chops and brown rice. Cooked on low for 4 1/2hrs. Pork chops were moist and tender you could cut them with a fork. For the chicken broth I used Better than bouillon paste. I’m going to either cut the bouillon paste down (a little too salty) or stick with the chicken broth. 
p.s. 2cups of liquid maybe 1c. of broth and 1c. of water

The spices in this are to die for.  Really!
I changed it only in the way I cooked it.  
I only had thin cut pork chops..so I used my Dutch oven, and cooked for two hours.  We loved, loved, loved it.

Best slow cooker pork chops ever, and so easy!  I followed the recipe except I added diced onion and celery in the liquid. My husband and I thought they were great, but he would have liked a little less spices. But I will definitely make them again.

Used the same ingredients but cooked 3 thick cut chops in my Pampered Chef Rock Crock Dutch oven at 350 degrees for 2 and 1/2 hours. It was awesome and fork tender! Served it with fresh carrots and garlic and oil couscous.  Depending on the chops you could feed four people because they are so moist and tender.

I made the recipe as written.  The pork chops were strangely tender yet dry.  So very  dry that a drink of water was needed to get a bite down the throat.  My family did not like either the texture nor the flavor.  I had to throw away the rest - a huge waste of food.  This recipe was not worth making.

The meat was falling off the bone, and very tender.  It could have been a little more flavorful for my liking, but the ease in putting it together was incredible!  I set the cooker for 8 hours on low, and it turned out great.

Personally I didn't care for the ingredients.  I'm not fond of using Poultry Seasoning at all.  I only used 1 tsp. instead of a Tablespoon and it was still to much for me.  I served it with mashed cauliflower.  My boyfriend however enjoyed it and even used the gravy on this cauliflower.

I cook for only 2 of us, so I am always looking for recipes that can easily be cut down and won’t leave me with a half a can of soup or something like that. For this recipe, I used 2 extra-thick cut bones chops and cut the ingredients in the sauce recipe by half. I served the chops with rice. I thought there was plenty of sauce, so am not sure why so many people talked about doubling the amount of sauce-wow! Anyway, the chops were very tender and flavorful, although I think I will cut down on the amount of paprika next time. I cooked this according to the original recipe. I think I will try it next time with the addition of some small red potatoes or cut up a larger russet potato and maybe some pearl onions and cook on low heat for 7-8 hours. I agree with another reviewer who noted that this would probably be a great recipe using a pork roast too.

I am a pretty good cook. I have been married for 30 years.  My husband said these were the best pork chops I have ever made.  The only changes were that I didn't have chicken stock, so I used beef, and I seasoned the pork chops before I put them in the crock pot using misc. spices and salt and pepper.  Yummy!

I love to cook and am considered a good cook. This was the worst recipe for pork chops that I have ever tried. As I was putting together the ingredients, I thought the combination was strange....like something my inexperienced husband might throw together believing that he was being creative.  I followed the recipe exactly. The chops and liquid were so strong tasting. The chops were indeed very tender  but not edible.

Nope. Probably will try again but definitely not my favourite chop recipe. It is relatively easy though.

I used pork steaks and the meat just fell apart. I doubled the ingredients but recommend not doing so with the oregano. The younger ones thought it was too much. I also used smoked paprika which gave it another twist. Highly suggest using it. Otherwise, it was great.

It was very greasy and heavy.
I think less oil would have made it better.

Made as written. The whole family liked it. My only complaint and reason not to go five stars was it was just a bit dry at the end of the cook time. Great flavor though. I will make it again an play with the cooking time.

Good flavor, but the timing was off. I should have taken it out WAY before suggested timing. The texture of the pork chop was just not right (tough and dry).  However, I'll give this recipe another try.

I had twice as many pork chops to cook, so I pretty much doubled everything. Substituted Italian seasoning for the poultry seasoning, because that's what I had on hand. Cooked on low for eight hours, and it was fantastic. Because it was so moist and flavorful, my husband gave it a thumbs up.

I made the recipe with no changes. We were not fans, the flavor was mediocre and the chops were dry. I will be looking for another recipe to try.

This was very good.  I used 4 bone-in pork chops (not thick).  I scattered 1/2 large onion in the bottom of the crockpot, cut back the paprika to 1t, and oregano to 1/2t.  Added 2 huge cloves of garlic and omitted the garlic powder.  Used 2 cups of beef broth because that's all I had on hand.  I cooked it on low for 6 hours, then removed and covered the chops, and added 1 cup of jasmati rice.  Cooked another 45 mins or so, then added back the pork chops, and cooked for about 30 more minutes.  Tender, falling off the bone pork and such flavorful rice.  I think that those whose chops were dry and/or tough either didn't add enough broth, didn't cook it long enough on low, or cooked it on high.  Low and slow is the way to go!

I had thin pork chops (They were on sale), so I only cooked them for 3 hours. I also didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used Italian seasoning. My crock pot is small, so I used the full can of chicken broth to make the sauce submerge all the meat. 

It was yummy! Good recipe!

Made this... However! Try these changes: 
I threw in 1 whole onion quartered, at least 10oz package of sliced white mushrooms, 3-4 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce,  4 cloves garlic chopped (no garlic powder), no olive oil, and used 2 1/2 cups chicken broth (no poultry seasoning). Check the photo...

made according to directions and the pork loin chops were very tender but  inedible.  did not like the spice combination. two bites and i was done. will rinse the chops off and put in some bbq sauce or something strong flavored to try and overpower the funky taste. wont make this again.

Great for fall apart, moist and wonderfully seasoned pork. Since they did fall apart so easily I made it my own and added a lg can of green beans and potatoes at the end. . Nice bits of pork mixed with green beans and potato .

Good but too much garlic for my liking.  I would either use the garlic powder or the minced garlic but not both.  Super easy to make.

The first time I made this recipe we thought it was pretty good but the two to three times since the pork chops were very dry and tough. We have tried different cuts of pork chops and flipping them in the sauce, but to my taste and my husband’s taste they are too dry. We will not be making this again.

The whole family loved the flavor but there was just too much oil. If I make it again, I'll skip the oil and try additional broth if more liquid is needed.

I have been cooking recipes  from All Recipes forever, it’s always my go to. I just have to say this was the worse recipe that I’ve ever made. It was so bland. I retraced the ingredients to see if I missed something, I didn’t..

I’ll definitely be making this again but with modifications.  Extremely easy to make but my wife was shocked that the recipe called for 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.  The result was very savory and tender and the pork chop could be cut without a knife.  
Downside for the dish is that it was a little bland.  The garlic used couldn’t be tasted and both my daughter and wife thought it needed more zip.  If I make it again, I’ll be adding some spices to give it some more zip.  I’ll also be using less oil.

I made it exactly as written.  As others have stated, I'd reduce the oil and increase the chicken stock.  This is definitely a keeper.  It is quick and easy but has a Mediterranean flavor next to none.  I served it over egg noodles with green beans flavored with Greek seasonings.

Soooo good, sooo easy!  The second time I made them I doubled the liquid and spices so that the pork was covered with liquid the whole time it cooked in the crock pot.  The flavor and tenderness made for a delicious dinner that my whole family (plus a neighbor boy) enjoyed.

This was so easy and delicious! I made it for a group of 16 and it was a hit! I cooked it on low for 8 hours, they were very thick pork chops , they were so tender you didn’t need a knife.   A few people are vegetarians so I used the same spices, organic vegetable broth and then instead of the pork I added mushrooms, carrots and onions cut up, pteas or lentils probably would have been good too. We had rice to put the juice on, which was good, probably would have been better if I thickened it.

I made this recipe as written and wouldn't make it again. The sauce ended up being a hodgepodge of too many flavors and it was very oily. I contemplated leaving the oil out and wish I had. The chops also weren't fall off the bone tender. It would've been better if cooked on low for a longer period of time. I won't be making this again.

I made it as written except for the addition of a cup of chicken stock.  Cooked it on low for 7.5 hours.  The pork was dry and the flavor was just so so for me.  Won't be making it again.

I just added crushed rosemary, about 1 teaspoon.  Never had pork chops turn out so tender.  No knife needed. Great recipe.  Will definitely be using this on a regular basis.  Thank you!

This was good but I think it used too much poultry seasoning. Hubby didn't like it as much as I did so I may try it one more time with some adjustments.

I made it as stated, I had to make my own poultry seasoning (didn't have marjoram that it asked for) but it turned out okay.  The texture of the pork was really off putting.  It was the texture of tuna fish, it broke apart and was really tender and the flavor was okay BUT even with the chicken stock covering most of it, it was dry.  I don't know how that's possible.  The only reason that I gave it as many stars is that the flavor was so so (husby liked the flavor) but I made a really delicious gravy from the leftover juices (I melted 2 Tbls. of butter, whisked 2 tsp. potato starch in with the stock).  The flavors were there, at least in the gravy.  In all, I would NOT make this again.  The texture was.... not good.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used vegetable broth because that was what I had.  Now, having a husband who won't eat chicken, I consider myself a pork chop expert.  For 23 years, I have broken up the beef monotony with creative takes on pork chops.  I have a recipe for brined chops with caramelized onions that I thought was the top of the pork chop game.  Well, was I ever wrong.  This was amazing.  It's one of the best things to come out of my kitchen and is about to become part of the family recipe box.

I made it exactly as written, and the seasoning and taste was very good. I do have a love-hate feeling about thick boneless loin chops...they are too dry even when cooked for hours in liquid like this.

Family loved it. Very flavorful and very easy to do. I cut down on the olive oil just a bit due to reviews I had read saying it was oily. I'll probably cut it down a little more next time I make it. But there will be a next time!

This was so easy and so good.  The only ingredient I didn't have is Poultry Seasoning, so I used a brand of chicken seasoning called Amazing Taste.  The pork chops were so tender and tasty.  I will make this again!!

One of the delicious recipes for slow cooked pork chops! Definitely a keeper and will add this to my recipe library. 
It had a Mediterranean taste to it but I thought it wouldn't hurt if I add 1 tsp balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce. I got worried it might be too garlic-y so I added 1/4 cup of chopped onions. I had 9 pork chops to cook so I double the sauce measurements. One of the reviewers said that she browned the chops first which I did. I put a little bit salt and pepper on the 1-inch pork chops and browned them first for more flavor (about 3-4 minutes on each side) before putting them into the crockpot. I cooked them in low for 8 hours. I added some roasted peppers that I already have in my fridge before serving. Do a final taste with the sauce. Mine came in a little bit short with salt so I had to put a little more in. Every bite of the pork chop was delish. It is extremely moist that it doesn't taste like pork chops! LOL

A great cook I am not. I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Truely idiot proof.

I noticed while reading the reviews a lot of people really didn't follow the recipe. I followed it (didn't leave anything out) and it came out GREAT. Cooked it for 8 hours on low, and even added some baby potatoes. Everyone loved it. Make sure you have everything you need for the recipe. There's no reason why this recipe shouldn't have 5 stars.

Not great I used boneless center cut and it was very dry.. the taste was ok I'm sure if it was pork chops it may have been better... I'm usually happy with most of the receipts!!

Followed the recipe, didn't enjoy it. Porkchops seemed tough IMO. But the seasoning just wasn't my favorite. Wife wouldn't eat it, kid barely ate it.

Its easy as falling off a log to make! I like all the ingredients separately , but for some reason, I found this recipe bland, and missing something! The pork chops ' flavor seemed overpowered by everything else, which made them bland as well. 
  I will try it again, to see if I did something wrong, but I'm  sure I followed everything as written! I may try adding a bit of cooking wine, cutting back on the olive oil a bit, and maybe adding a touch of BBQ sauce.

Made this last night for dinner.  I really wanted to like it but when I came home from work the smell was very odd.  I was hopeful but the flavor was so strange.  Used only a little oil and cooked 5 hours on low - meat was tender but hubby gave it a thumbs down.  I agreed.

This is such a delish recipe!   Didn't have any fresh garlic, so just added a little extra of the garlic powder.  Also used bone-in chops with no problems!

I made this pretty much exactly by the recipe. I had a package of 7 thick cut boneless chops, so I used 1 and 1 half amounts on all the seasonings and oil, and used a whole (almost 2 cups) can of chicken broth. It was perfect, very delicious! I let them cook longer than called for on low and they were super tender and the extra broth kept them nice and moist. My fiance and his daughter both liked them a lot. She actually is very lucky and likes mostly plain good, but did great with these. I agree with someone else who said they have a but of a Mediterranean flavor, but it's not strong or overwhelming. I'm definitely making these again.

Hey! So some background first - I'm a 15 year old EXTREMELY inexperienced chef, but this was soOOO easy to make. And it was delicious! Whole family loved it(parents, brother, and brother's girlfriend) and I will definitely be making it again!

Instead of 1 tablespoon paprika, I used 1/2 tbs paprika and 1/2 tbs cayenne pepper. Came out great! Paired it with long grain rice and steamed baby carrots. Also added an extra(small) clove of garlic, as my entire family are garlic fanatics.  All in all, the meal was fantastic and we all loved it(that's a big deal in this family, none of us love pork chops), and everyone wants me to make it again!! Thanks so much!

This had lots of flavor.  I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used adobo (made it a little salty so glad I didn't add salt).  I also used smoked paprika which gave it a nice smoky flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this with 2 thick cut, boneless chops in my Ninja cooker. After 1.5 hrs on high,(it seemed too hot), so  i turned it to low, after 1 more hour they were done.

Do not use center cut pork chops - dry as a bone!  The only deviation from the original recipe was to saute fresh garlic in olive oil and use the same pan to put a quick sear on the chops.
Cooked on low for 6 hours and while the sauce smelled great and was delicious over rice, the chops were almost inedible - way too dry.  I may try it again with bone-in chops, but not any time soon!

I made this today. I had to look up a slow cooker recipe because my fan oven broke & I came across this which looked easy enough for a novice.
I used 'bone-in' pork chops. I used a chicken stock cube instead of broth. I didn't have 'poultry seasoning' so googled what it was & added small amounts of each ingredient to the mixture (sage, rosemary, thyme, marjoram & black pepper).
I actually think the chops were cooked after 3 hours so I turned it onto a 'low' setting for the last hour. I didn't baste because the liquid covered the chops so I turned them over half way through.
I didn't have any corn flour so I made up some chicken gravy granules with water & whisked them in with the sauce to make a gravy.
The meat fell off the bone & was so tender & tasty. I served it with baby potatoes, chantennay carrots & corn. It was a MASSIVE hit with my husband and two VERY fussy young sons. The gravy was lush...!
I will definitely be making this again. Many thanks from the O'Brien family for this wonderful recipe.

A different taste for me  but I liked it very much.  I didn't have garlic powder so I addition to the garlic clove I used garlic salt.  This needs less salt so I regretted that.  I used the jus left over in my lentil soup which gave a terrific flavor

I made this and followed many of the reviewers ideas. I added an extra cup of broth and cooked on low for 8 hours.  There was no need to baste then because the broth covered the chops the entire time. But I agree with those that said you do NOT take the lid off the crock pot. I added more garlic, because I love garlic. I did make gravy out of the juice that was left and it was good on the meat and mashed potatoes.  I don't love pork chops, even though these literally fell apart coming out of the crock pot, pork chops are still a dry meat.  But the gravy helped.  I will make this again when I need something other than chicken or beef.  It's nice to put something in the crock pot and not worry about it.

Liked this very much, used boneless butt spare ribs instead of chops, and likely will reduce the poultry seasoning a bit, split the smoked paprika that I used with hot paprika next time, and perhaps a touch of okra for more of a cajun/dirty rice flavor. Degreased the sauce, added a bit of corn starch to thicken just a hair over rice...YUM...

I would use less oil, pressure cooker gets it done even faster which is great in a pinch.

I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I added a little emeril's essence and a bit of rosemary.  These were the best pork chops I've ever made, moist and flavorful

I personally thought this was a hit! Had a wonderful Mediterranean vibe to it and it was perfect over basamati rice. I will definitely make again for the wow factor, easy prep and easy clean up. Seared the chops first then Cooked on low for 6 hours

My son swears that he hates pork chops. I made this recipe, pulled the meat apart, and served it over rice, garnished with peas. I called it Mediterranean Pork and he loved it! Great recipe, very easy and I had all the ingredients on hand.

Pork chops were very tasty. I only cooked about 3 hours because I got started late-4 would have been better-but the flavors were great. I would also try this on chicken. I didnt make any changes to the recipe. ***Made this again-cooked for full 4 hours and doubled the chicken broth-delicious!

I made this recipe as directed. I wasn't impressed. After it was done I felt like it needed to be smothered in bbq sauce., which is how we ate it. I have other pork recipes I will use over this one in the future.

We thought this was very good.  The flavor was outstanding.   Had a oily taste to me but not to my husband.  Next time I would probably use 1/2 the oil.  I followed others suggestions and used onion powder instead of garlic powder.  I put in a lot of fresh garlic because we love it.  I would prefer to slow cook it for 6-8 hours rather than cook it on high.  I don't like cooking on high.  I would also use my meat tenderizer (not the pounding kind, the 27 blades kind) on the pork chops.  Can't wait to make it again.

I made this for dinner tonight using bone-in pork chops. I following the recipe to the letter, except I added 2 cups of chicken broth instead. It was sooooo good! I used the remaining liquid & made a delicious gravy as well. This will be added to our main staples! YUM!

I added more liquid, cooked it on low instead of high, marinated for a few hours prior, and seared the meat before putting it in the crockpot. The meat is super dry and no flavor.

This turned out very dry! I followed the directions exactly as written. I even checked the temp an hour before it says they're done (at the 3 hr mark) and they were very very dry. I was pretty disappointed thinking they would be juicy. Definitely not fork-tender!

The pork chops were very tender. Recipe was easy to make. Smelled very good while cooking. Pork chops were very bland. Whole family said it was just ok.  I won't make it again. I will shred the remaining pork chops and add barbecue sauce to make sandwiches.

The only thing I would do next time is give the chops a quick sear and reduce the cooking time by a half hour. I also used the remaining liquid to make a gravy by adding a corn starch slurry

Great recipe. I added some rosemary and two chopped fresh red chili peppers from the back yard. Next time I think I will substitute the oil with chicken broth. This dish is definitely back on the menu.

The only change I made to this was the addition of sliced up onions.  We love them, cooked or raw, so added just a little different flavor.  Very good!!

It was very tender and flavorful, but next time I will sear the chops first for some color and more flavor.

** this broth makes an amazing gravy. 

Followed almost exactly, except:
1- I doubled the recipe. 
2- I had no basil, so I substituted that ingredient with herbes de Provence. 
3- I purposefully went a little heavy on the oregano. 
4- I ended up using "better than bouillon" to make my broth because that's what I had. Worked great. 
I LOVED how this turned out. I will definitely be making it again. Soooo easy. 

**For the gravy after, I ladled it nearly all of the juices into a saucepan, brought it to a boil. Meanwhile, I whisked about 1/3 c of flour into  ~ 1 1/2 -2 c of milk, and then slowly whisked the mixture into my boiling juices. Let it boil for about a minute once fully combined. Done. It was seriously so good.

First of all, my husband does 99% of the cooking of the meat in our home, mainly because he loves it and he's amazing at seasoning. We had a pig slaughtered and I decided to try this on pork chops that were close to 1 inch thick. It turned out AMAZING! I didn't change a single thing and my husband couldn't stop the compliments! I have 4 teenage boys and they loved it as well. The meat literally fell off the bone. I love that I had every ingredient sitting in my spice/seasoning cupboard. I'd recommend this recipe to everyone!

I don't usually cook pork chops and was a Lil worried  about trying a new recipe in crockpot.  These turned out so tender they fell apart when you cut them! So flavorful! My husband  can't wait for me to make them again! Very easy for a busy mom.

Left out the oil and increased the chicken broth since I had 5 bone in pork chops. Removed chops at the end and added slurry to make a gravy. Pretty good and super easy

I followed the instructions almost to a T.  Except that my pork chops were frozen and all I had was garlic powder, also I had no poultry seasoning so I used the liquid stock from cans of chicken noodle soup.  I started it all out in the crock pot on low for a bit since my chops were frozen, then I turned it to high the rest of the time and it only took about 3.5 hours total to cook.  Once my fork went through, the meat just fell apart, NICE!  And the olive oil gives this recipe a kick  consistency that truly is the reason this recipe is so good.

Really good.  I had to double the liquid so that it would cover the pork.  Also, I cooked it on low for 8 hours.  The meat fell off the bone and was very flavorful.  I  reduced the liquid down and made a gravy out of it,  then I served it on a bed of stir fried vegetables.  Great low carb dinner!!

Very good!  Would probably use a little less oil next time.  Flavors are great and mine got done in 4 hours on low and they were even partially frozen.  Husband loved the dish.

I thought this was really good!  I was concerned that it would be dry, but it wasn't.  I did brown the chops first, then only cooked on low for 4 hours.

I made this exactly as recipe stated. Used four very thick sirloin boneless chops. House smelled awesome. Chops were fork tender but dry. Loved the flavor. I think my new Crock Pot must cook at a higher temp. I think 4 hours on low would have been better for my cooker. I will try this again on lower temp. Bet it would be good with chicken as well.

I really enjoyed this meal as it was super-easy to make and the pork had a delightful flavor when finished.  It was very subtle so don't be expecting a "bang" when you eat it, but that's what we enjoyed about it!  The only thing I would change is to cook it for far less time as my chops disintegrated in the pot; I think this is probably just a factor of the thickness and fattiness of the pork.  Obviously, thicker needs far longer and I had a slightly thinner cut.  Will definitely make this again, with absolutely no changes!

This was okay but I probably won't make it again.  I added a little more chicken broth, put a layer of onions on the bottom and added 8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms.  The combination of spices tasted a little strange to me, maybe too much oregano.

Made exactly as directed with great anticipation.  Very disappointing. Great flavors in the sauce did not transfer to the meat. Good quality  meat turned  tough from over cooking. I will not repeat!

Super good! I was a little skeptical about the amount of spices but I went with it and I am glad I did. Only changes were doubling the broth and cooking on low for 8 hours. Used the leftover liquid to make a gravy (didn't strain beforehand as others did) by cooking on the stove and adding a mix of 1 T each cornstarch and water. Amazing over rice and as leftovers the next day!

Put it together yesterday, as written except for doubled broth and everyone loved it.  The broth/cooking stock was excellent dribbled over meat (although I was the only one that did that.)
Tossed in some thawed french style green beans and the end and they had great flavor.

If I decide to try to do pork chops in a slow cooker again I would would omit the oregano and maybe throw in some bell peppers or maybe jalapeño.  I would also reduce my cooking time by an hour or so I wanted tender pork chops not shredded pork.

The flavor of sage from the poultry seasoning was too overpowering for us.  The texture of the meat was perfect though.  After 4 hours on high the chops still held together if handled gently but it was tender enough to cut it with a fork.   I don't like it when meat is so tender that it completely falls apart.  Next time I will try cutting the poultry seasoning in half, decreasing the olive oil by half and add 2 TBS of soy sauce for a more savory flavor.

These chops were very good and so easy to make. Though they are a bit spicy, our family really enjoyed the taste. I made the recipe exactly as it was written. I definitely plan on making this recipe again in the future.

This was really tasty.  We doubled the gravy ingredients (except for the olive oil 1/3 cup instead of a 1/2 cup - and it was still too much oil).  We had some 2 inch thick bone-in pork chops and we felt would be good for this recipe.  Unfortunately the chops turned out dry, no fault to the recipe.  I probably over cooked them.  I removed the chops to a plate and poured the gravy into a sauce pan. I added about 1/3 cup 1% milk, brought it to a slow boil and added some 1 tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved it in a little cold water to thicken gravy. The gravy was delicious over some white jasmine rice.  I did cut the poultry seasoning back to half because it is strong and I didn't want it to over power the gravy.  It was the right decision.  I also cut the garlic powder back to 2 tsp. instead of 2 tablespoons since fresh garlic is part of the recipe.  I didn't want it to be too garlicy. Again I feel was the right decision.  I will definitely be making this again, next time with smaller cut pork chops which should work better.  Next time I will cut the olive back to 1 -2 tablespoons for a double gravy or just not ad it at all.  I don't know why so much oil was included in this recipe because it's definitely not needed because the chops produce fat to the gravy as well. A few reviewers stated it tasted Mediterranean but my hubby and I disagree.  It is a strong flavor set though.

I'm not a fan of porkchops because even at its moistest, it still seems dry and not to flavorful to me. That being said, I'd make these again because it was easy, there was flavor, and it was moist. Not dry-moist, but actually moist. I'd still rather have steak though. The second time I made these I made a huge change in cooking them. My son likes his porkchops breaded and fried. So I slightly undercooked these in the slow cooker, then dipped them in an egg wash and panko and fried them up. Preparing them that way didn't seem to save me any time or create less mess, but they sure were good and I'm definitely doing that again.

Delicious! First time attempting to make pork chops and man were they good! I didn't even need to use a knife because they literally fell apart. I doubled the chicken broth and used parsley instead of basil. Then poured the liquid from the chops on the veggies and rice. Mine were perfectly done in 3 1/2 hours. Definitely a recipe to try!

I used thick bone-in chops, sautéed the garlic and some chopped onion in a little olive oil, then quickly browned the chops in the oil before adding to the slow cooker.  I think four hours on high is too much. If I make these again, I'll cook on low for six hours, because they were a little dry. I'd also cut back on the poultry seasoning, as the flavor was overpowering. Once I took the chops out, I added a slurry to the liquid, and let it cook on high for another thirty minutes. We liked these well enough, but no one's in a hurry for me to make again.

We've made this twice now - just for us a few weeks ago and last night with my in-laws as guests- and it was a hit both times. Even our 6 year old daughter happily took leftovers in her lunch today. We have the All Clad Slow Cooker, whose cast -aluminum insert can be used on the stove top. I lightly browned the chops right in that before adding the rest of the ingredients, though this step really wouldn't be necessary and I'd likely skip it if crunched for time. No need to cut slits in the chops. The only thing I would definitely change is the cooking time.  The first time I made the recipe, my chops were under 1 inch thick and average size. I cooked them 2 hours on low and they were good, if not a little dry. This time I used pork chops from Costco and they're huge, about 7-8 oz each( I weighed them), and over 1 inch thick. I can't eat a whole one myself.  They ended up being cooked almost 5 hours on low (I intended 4 hours, but our guests came late) and, again, they were just a little dry for my preference. I really think 3.5-4 hours would be perfect. I also added 2 containers of sliced baby portabellas each time during the last 20 mins of cooking and they turned out to be an excellent addition to the broth over rice. The next time I think I'll add a sliced onion at the beginning, too.  This recipe is great as written (except for cooking time, but that may be due to my particular slow cooker) and has been added to our regular rotation. I might even bake it in the oven the n

I made this the other night and it was delicious! I only changed one thing and that was the poultry seasoning... I didn't have any so I didn't add it and threw in a chicken bullion cube instead. It took about 5 hours and was so tender and yummy... Even my 19 month old liked it! Thanks!

Great , simple recipe using ingredients you probably already have. I wanted an easy way to slow cook pork for Cuban sandwiches, and this did exactly what I wanted. Use more broth for a slower cook at a lower temperature. Will use again!

I never give reviews, but this was so good I just had to. I tweeked it a little by doubling the broth, adding 1 TBSP red pepper flakes, used extra virgin olive oil, and I slow cooked them on low for 7 hours. These were great! Even my picky eater loved them. They were so tender they just fell apart. I will be making this again!

My family loved these.  I did not have olive oil so I used coconut oil.  I added some Yukon Gold potatoes toward the end.  The pork chops fell apart while trying to get them out of  pot, so tender.  This recipe is certainly a keeper for my family.

Very good flavoring.  the chops fall apart.  I had to cook 8 hrs on low.  That's why they fell apart.  The chops were delicious and I really liked the flavor.  I put carrots, and other assorted veggies in the pot. Made real mashed potatoes and placed this on it with the juices.  So good.   Since this was the first time, I didn't stray from the recipe.  No changes that I could think of to add..

I  found it very light,  meat extremely tender falling off the bone.   Next time I will use Butter instead of the Olive Oil, I could profoundly taste the oil on may palette  and lips,  Lol.  I also couldn't find my Oregano,  so I  had to go to spice replacement.   Spice replacement  suggest  using Thyme  or Italian seasoning I used equal parts of both.  I also  Twiked,  my  Paparika I  used part regular  and Part Smoked  Paparika to balance the flavor out.  My husband ate dinner alone, he committed he really liked it with Rice &  mixed vegetables  that I  always, always  add extra whole kernel corn to and Butter of course.  May kids eat more because of the corn.  I followed the others "RREVIEWS "  I  ADDED MORE CHICKEN BROTH,  but not the whole can.  Thanks I slept while it cooked!

Very easy and very quick to put together!  I have made these twice starting these in the crock pot before I head back to work from my lunch break - around 2pm.  I love that these are ready for dinner by 6pm.  They're quite tasty too - as they should be with all the nice savory seasonings used for cooking.  I will definitely keep this recipe handy.

I didn't change a lot. First of all, experienced cooks know that a tablespoon of dried herbs/spices can be overpowering because the flavors get concentrated when herbs are dried. So I used about half the quantity the recipe called for. I added a sliced onion along with the browned chops and the rest of the ingredients. Cooked on low for several hours. I added a touch of tarragon vinegar to the sauce at the end and then thickened with a roux. Results were very, very good. Even my husband, who avoids eating meat, enjoyed this dish. I served it with roasted small red potatoes and a green salad. Definitely will make again.

Very good. Nice alternative to cream of mushroom soup. I cooked mine on low for 8 hours and they turned out great. No knife needed. Will make again.

This turned out great! I marinated the pork over night before cooking. I also added extra chicken stock and spices when I did cook it, plus half an onion.

I didn't have any poultry seasoning on hand so I used a seasoning blend instead.  Delicious!  I never seem to quite get pan fried chops right; they always get overdone - these were amazing.  Juicy and yummy!

Doubled the chicken broth.

Honestly, this might be the tastiest thing I've ever cooked. The entire time it was cooking, I was in disbelief that something that smelled that good was coming out of my kitchen.

Good flavor, but my pork chops got too dry. Next time I would cook on low instead of high and see how that works. I served it with Rice-a-Roni Fried Rice with mushrooms and onions mixed in. We used the extra juice from the crock pot like gravy over the meat and rice.

I hate when people review recipes that they modified but we thought this was amazing so I have to share. I left out the oil, which I don't get why it was added in the first place when cooking in a crockpot, and added a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup so there would be a gravy. Served over rice. The pork just fell apart. Making this at least once a week now.  The spice combination is amazing!

Fantastic!  I only had 3 skinny pork chops, but no matter - I cut the seasonings in half, but used a whole can of chicken broth.  I also browned the chops first in a bit of olive oil and deglazed with a splash of white wine.  I  threw in a few fennel seeds - couldn't help myself!  After they were done, I took the broth and thickened with some cornstarch for a gravy. The flavor and tenderness was so good. A definite keeper!

I made the broth mixture the night before and marinated the chops in it. In the morning poured all into the crock pot and cooked on low for 8hrs. Came out tender and flavorful. Even the kids ate it all!

The sauce never really flavored the pork chops the way I hoped. And cooking on high for only 2 hours over cooked the chops as well.

I was a little apprehensive at the ingredient amounts (1 tablespoon paprika!?) BUT this turned out to be very flavorful! My husband went back for seconds. The sauce went well over some rice. Will be making this again for sure!

This was surprisingly good. Disclaimer: I'm still very new to cooking, so this at least felt within my ballpark to accomplish and I had all the ingredients. I was concerned at first about the combination of the spices but they worked really well. The pork chops I used were boneless and slightly thinner, so I cut the cooking dial down to low by the 2 hr mark. Next time I would use low sodium broth and thicker pork chops.

I doubled the recipe, since I made double the amount.  I don't know if I did something wrong or my chops were huge and my crock was the wrong size.  The chops came out delicious, but they were not "chop" per se.  They fell apart and had to be scooped out in pieces.  It didn't really matter, since they were a hit and I will make them again.    They were tender and tasty.  I wonder if I can use the same ingredients and use chicken breasts...

Tried this tonight and it was absolutely delicious. We used thick chops on the bone and they cooked perfectly. I was unsure of the Paprika as I don't like spicy food but the sauce was lovely. I put the sauce in a saucepan at the end with some chicken thickener to give the sauce some substance.  Definitely recommend.

Made this tonight exactly as directed. The pork was tender but the flavor was bland. I used good spices, and was nervous about the quantity but trusted the recipe. Hubby got up half way through dinner and got out some sweet & sour sauce to give it flavor. Doesn't make the cut to make again.

The only thing I changed was cooked it on low for 8 hours. 

Easy  to make and smelled good.... But I wasn't impressed.  I thought they were very dry and the sauce was kind of blah.  I won't make it again.

This smelled the house up so nicely. I used thinner pork chops and reduced the cooking time. The flavor was very good but the pork chops were dry. Will try this again but with thicker chops.

Cooking it, it smelt wonderful my husband commented  when he came in the house on the wonderful  smell. I think it's  to busy with all the spices it takes away from the flavor  then enhancing it. So on that note i won't  be making this again.

This was really very good! I only had 1 clove of garlic, no poultry seasoning (I added a little Italian seasoning mix) and it turned out fantastic. A perfect Fall comfort food. I wish I had more broth/gravy so next time I'll make sure of that, I thickened it up at the end with a little flour and the pork chops fell apart, served over homemade mashed potatoes and cranberries on the side. It was great. I think the leftovers will make a great shredded pork sandwich tomorrow, I'll toast some rolls for that. Very flavorful. Highly recommend this one.

I loved this recipe! It gave the old tastebuds a new adventure, lol. I followed the directions pretty much to a T. Except, I didn't have any cloves of any kind, so I substituted minced onion for it. For every 1 clove, I used 2 tsps. I opted for 4 teaspoons total. I let it cook on high for three hours, then low for a hour to a hour in a half. Towards the end, I added cornstarch for thickness. I will make this again. Thank u

My family and I are not fans of this recipe. The flavor didn't seem to work for me and the liquid was quite oily. The texture turned me off as well. 4 hours made the meat fall apart tender, but a bit on the dry side.

We loved this recipe.  I doubled everything and put in the crockpot on low for 4 hours.  I made rice and poured the juice over it.  Yum!   Even my picky 14 year old liked it!

I tried the recipe for the first time last night & everyone loved it!  I used 4 thick cut chops and then sliced it then down the middle to create thinner ones & make food spread.  I then cooked mine at low for 6 hrs.  The texture broke into thick chunks as it was so tender it fell apart a bit.  I used the same seasonings, but substituted gloves of garlic for minced. I used the whole can of broth as we used the extra to moisturize the side of white rice I made with it.  Definitely making it again! Pic added....it is the one with the yellow-ish bowl next crock pot.

I was really excited the way this marinade smelled.  I thought I was in for an AMAZING meal.  I was very disappointed. Some of the chops were a little dry but that's besides the point.  I won't be making this again.

I loved the seasoning blend for these chops, very flavorful, but I found the meat to be very dry. Might be better with a fattier cut of meat.

Absolutely delicious! We went exactly by the recipe except only used 3 bonless pork chops and cooked on high for only 2 hrs. and 30 minutes and the pork chops were extremely tender but not dry.  I thought it would be too garlicky but it was just perfect!

Made this tonight. It was a hit! The only thing I didn't have was poultry seasoning. I substituted a tablespoon of McCormick's Perfect Pinch Tuscan rosemary and sun-dried tomato seasoning. It does seem to have a Mediterranean flair to it. It was really delicious. Served it over rice and used the juices as extra seasoning.

Perhaps there's something wrong with my Crockpot. I followed the recipie exactly and the chops were dry and tough :-(. Was soooo looking forward to fork tender juicy and flavorful chops as othes have described. I think the recipie is worth trying again--in another crockpot.

I wanted to like this as it smelled really good cooking. But the chops were just so dry it was hard to swallow! I followed the recipe and only added a cup more of the broth. I used thick cut bone-in pork chops which are always juicier than boneless. It did not help. For all the spices this had in it, it was quite bland - my husband broke out the Heinz 57 after awhile. Sure they were tender but what does that matter when they're so dry you can barely swallow? It was a waste of some very beautiful chops. Will not make again.

My family & I love this recipe. It' s the first time I've made pork chops that were not dry & I have grilled, baked & sauteed stove top. This is hands down the easiest & best result. They literally fell off the bone & have the best flavor. I have made it several times!

Thought there was way to much olive oil and fresh herbs are always better. Needed salt and some cayenne. It was easy but wont make again.

This smelled great while cooking and my 4 year old surprisingly LOVED it, however, I felt it was a bit over seasoned and think it may be better as a BBQ dish. I shredded the chops after cooking and added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it tasted MUCH better to me.

These were just ok b/c they were little dry. Also whole idea of slow cooker is that you can leave for work and come home to food ready and this one even with my programmable slow cooker would not work that well b/c of 4 hr Cooke time.

This smelled really good cooking and was very tender.  However, my family had to add A-1 or ketchup in order to enjoy this fully.  I think it could have benefited from a tomato-type ingredient or maybe Worcestershire or something?  I don't know, but it wasn't great.

My husband has a very picky palate, so I was a little nervous about this one. He LOVED it. He even went back for seconds. It definitely has a Mediterranean taste, but don't let that scare you away if you aren't a fan of that type of food. I found it one of the most interesting combination of spices I've tasted in a while. I will definitely make this one again!

I am just trying this recipe tonight.  It's ready to go (but the family isn't here yet).  Smells awesome & the sneak bite I tried is yum yum! I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I omitted it.  I agree with some others that the oil could be cut in half. I also used 2 cups of broth.  At the end I used just a touch of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also threw in some chopped red bell peppers.  More to not have to use another pan than anything.  Meat & sauce are delicious.  Serving over white rice.

I used thin pork chops and added a big pack of mixed veggies from the produce isle (Brussels, carrots, potatoes) and cooked on low for 8 hrs. The pork basically shredded since they were thin but the flavor was SO delicious. I would absolutely do this again, probably try thicker chops like it recommends. Delicious!!

To be fair, we didn't exactly follow the receipe but rather used it as a guide. We seasoned 2 pork chops with salt, pepper, garlic and red pepper flakes. Seared on both sides for 1-2 mins/side. We put in the crockpot for 4 hours on low w/ 2 cups chicken broth, 1 cup white wine, 1 tbsp of Dales low sodium seasoning and 1/2 a medium white onion. After the 4 hours were up we made a gravy with the remaining juice and poured it over rice.

I really liked this recipe!  I cooked the chops in the oven on low instead of the slow cooker and they came out so very tender!  I also reduced the sauce down to a pan sauce and served over the chops. This is definitely a healthy and tasty alternative to frying chops.

Delicious! We don't eat pork too often, but thought we would try this recipe after buying boneless, thinner chops on sale. I was out of basil, so used thyme instead. I added about 30 minutes in low so I could finish the side of mac and cheese (good mix) and wheat bread.

Very good taste, even omitted the paprika and bullion. I put it in the crock pot on low for 5 1/2 hours and it came out a little dry, yet it was tender and flavorful.

This recipe has a great flavor! I did make a few changes: Instead of the garlic powder, I added a packet of onion soup mix and used the minced garlic. I also used a whole can of chicken broth and about a cup of vegetable broth, but I also used 6 pork chops instead of 4. I cooked on low for 8 hours, and then served the dish over white rice. Next time I think I'll add onions, and may try thickening the juice to make a gravy.

I tried this recipe today.  It has a very good flavor!  The meat was over-cooked by about an hour.  It was easily cut with a fork, but meat was very dry.  I also doubled the liquid, don't know if that had anything to do with the cook time.  If you make this, check your meat about half way through, or cook 4 hours on low instead of high.  Other than that, the flavor was excellent.

Very good! The whole family loved it. I cooked this on low and for a longer time(while I was at work) and then made gravy with the remaining juices. It was very flavorful. We will definitely be making this again.

Seasoning was acceptable. Thinner pork chops need less cook time than 4 hours--ours were pretty dry.

Smell alone while cooking is worth making this!

I did:    Four hours on Low, 2 hours on High. 
Added:    Italian, Lawry's, Italian Seasoning, splash of red balsamic vinegar, splash of honey, 2 cups of chicken stock.
Left out: Oil (drizzled to cover), paprika, had no garlic, used garlic salt; no basil or poultry seasoning. 

Frozen 3/4" pork chops boneless. Fall-apart amazing, delicious as leftovers for work. 

I liked that it wasn't a soup-from-a-can recipe (which can be good) but it felt brighter and had LOTS of flavor!!! REALLY EASY TO MAKE and the whole place smelled delicious when I got home from work!

My roommate and boyfriend loved the aroma of this dish in the crockpot. My boyfriend said it was awesome and the best thing I cooked so far in last year and a half. I didn't have chicken stock so I doubled the chicken broth but didn't have any so I took 2 cups water and 2 chicken bouillon cubes and boiled them on the stove until it dissolved. I didn't have poultry seasoning so I looked up what it was and noticed Italian seasoning which I did have, was pretty much the same thing...just add some other seasonings and pepper...because of this I did not add more basil or oregano...as it is in the Italian seasoning. This also goes on bread for a sandwich really well. 

Served it with green beans. Was going to serve with a sweet potato but then didn't have any brown sugar...but I'm sure it would of been yummy.

This was a very tender and tasty way to cook pork. I think it would be a better with a little gravy to top it off, then it would be excellent.

These tasted okay, but nothing special. Had I ordered them in a restaurant I wouldn't have sent them back for something else, but they weren't so good that I would have stuffed myself beyond being full or even bothered taking home any leftovers. I don't agree with the review that says don't baste because you want to retain the heat in the crock pot - it's not a pressure cooker so letting out heat won't hurt it, it'll heat up again & pork chops do benefit from basting when they don't have sauce that covers the top.

Sauce is fantastic  - tried it twice - the four hour fast and 8 hour slow way - both times the chops were extremely dry.  Unfortunate.

This is a keeper!  We love getting the thick-cut bone in chops since they're less expensive and don't dry out as fast as the thinner cut chops.  I cooked 4 thick chops for 10 hours on low instead of 4 hours on high, and they were great.  As another reviewer said, we didn't even need knives, you could cut into the chops with a fork.  Next time I might try marinading the chops in the broth/seasoning mixture overnight to see if that intensifies the flavor at all.  We had so much leftover that tonight I'm going to whip up another batch of the "sauce", shred the remaining pork, and make hot Italian sandwiches.

I didn't have poultry seasoning so I substituted pork seasoning. I also doubled the broth. In measuring the herbs and spices, I used slightly less than what the recipe said. It was still pretty spicy. I browned the chops on a grill pan first. I cooked on low for about 5 hrs and it was plenty tender. I used 1-1/2" thick pork chops. I liked that this wasn't a recipe where you opened up a can of creamy soup and poured it in there but it also was just too spicy for me. Plus the pork ended up dry. It didn't taste bad, it just wasn't good enough to cook again. I have plenty of leftovers so I'm going to use them for banh mi sandwiches next week.

This was amazing!!!... was super excited smelling it all day. Did add the extra 1cup of chicken broth as some people said.Gave it 4 out of 5 becasue Husband wasn't a fan, would have rather BBQ'd the pork.

I thought this was very good. Meat was moist.  I doubled the recipe since I had 10 pork chops.  I added fresh garlic, onion powder (did not have garlic powder), cayenne pepper, and sweet onions.  I also seasoned my meat with season all and it did not hurt the flavor of the meal.  My family loved it and went back for seconds. We will make this again.

We did not enjoy this recipe at all. Personally, I think the oregano (which is listed in the ingredients but not the instructions) was the problem. I might, and I stress might, try this again without the oregano so that it isn't the only thing you taste and cooking on low so the chops aren't completely dried out. Very disappointed.

Tried this last night.  Big thick 1 inch chops were too overdone at 4 hours on High, so it was a disappointing result.

Very easy and Great tasting. I make rice and pour the juice over it as a side dish. I have pre-made the marinade and added the porkchops, put in a ziploc & freeze. When in a hurry-grab from freezer, put it in the crockpot on low and go. Dinner is ready when you return. What Great home made meal. I love crockpot recipes and so does the family!

Delicious!  I have such a hard time making moist pork chops.  My slow cooker was in use for another dish so I modified to do in the oven.  4 hours at 200 degrees then a half hour at 325.  I'll cut back on the oil next time also, very good but could half it and still be moist and delicious!

I have never made pork chops in a crock pot but wanted to find an easy and yummy recipe to do so. This one hit the mark! I used bone-in pork chops and cut the cooking time to 3 hours, but we could hardly wait that long! It smelled so good while cooking!! This is definitely going into the cookbook. Served with mashed potatoes, broccoli and glazed carrots. Thanks for what we will add to the comfort food collection at home!

This was a huge hit with my entire family!  My husband said, "This is the first pork chop that I have ever liked!"  The kids loved them too.  It was so easy that I can throw this together before work and set it to low and double the cooking time like many others have suggested.  

I really like that this recipe was not a barbecue-based pork recipe.

I've made this recipe several times and my family and friends love it!  I add a 1/4c more broth and reduce the amount of oil as well. I add 2 more minced garlic cloves (we love garlic!) and usually cook 8 boneless pork chops at once in the slow cooker with this recipe.  Its delicious every time!

I made this and honestly found it to be lacking. It was GREAT to have them in the crock pot all day and they were very tender - fell right off the bone when I tried to take them out! But I didnt think the flavor was anything amazing. I did alter a little by using less than 1/4c olive oil and used 2cups chicken stock, then added garlic, paprika, and cajun season as I didnt feel like doing the italian blend. Maybe that is my fault for choosing to mix it up but it just didnt seem to penetrate the meat very much. 
Another thing is I was at work all day so didnt get the chance to flip them. That left the chops that were on top a little dry but still edible.

This recipe was a big hit in our house. I changed it up a bit: 4 cloves of garlic instead of two (we love garlic) and I didn't have poultry seasoning and I omitted the garlic powder. Instead, I have fresh Thai basil that I chopped and home grown dried oregano. I sprinkled a dash of red pepper flakes to give it some oomph. The garlic and the paprika make this amazing though. Great with rice and veggies.

This is a super easy recipe!  My kitchen smelt like I'd been cooking all day.  Tender, moist.  I can see me using this on a pork loin.  I'd omit the oil and 1/2 the chicken stock, but certainly boost up the spices.

It was alright.  A bit too 'herby' for me.  I strained the juices and whisked in some cornstarch and salt for a gravy.  The gravy was very good.  I only gave it 4 stars because the herbs were a little much.  I like my chops a bit sweeter, less savory.  But if you like savory chops, this would be a GREAT recipe for you!

I browned the chops in advance and used wine cubes to deglaze the pan.  I added drippings to the pot with the rest of the ingredients.  It was very tasty.

Extremely tasty!! I wanted big bold flavors in my pork chops because I was sick of the same ol' breaded and fried chops. I thickened the sauce with cornstrach to get a nice gravy and served it over egg noodles. I will make this recipe again, again, and again! Though I will add that when you make this recipe, make sure you have a very thick cut of pork chops. I made it the first time with regular sized pork chop sirloins (shame on me!) and all though the flavor was there, the actual meat was a little tough.

I thought this was delicious. The meat was so tender and not dry. My husband and 8 y/o daughter didn't like it. They ate it, but would not want me to make it again. I think I will make it again, but not tell them, and see what they say. I think it is company worthy. So delicious.

I had 9 chops so I used a 10 ¾ oz can of chicken broth and about a ½ can of water (enough to rinse out the can). I did not have poultry seasoning so I used 2 1/4 teaspoon sage, 3/4 teaspoon thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon marjoram. I did not use basil since I did not have any. I cooked on high for 4 hours. The house smelled great while this was cooking; however, the chops seemed dry and flavorless. The “sauce” never thickened up so my boyfriend used ketchup for flavor and moisture. Giving this a 3 only because my boyfriend said he would eat it again.

Really good! The meat was tender as it would be in any slow cooker recipe. I loved the combination of seasoning. It was such a nice change from all of the "cream of ......" pork chop recipes. I will definately make this again.

I was not a big fan of this recipe.  If you are going to try this recipe I would only use 1 tablespoon of olive oil.  I also tried using the remaining sauce as a gravy and it did not turn out very good.  The pork chops itself were very tender.

Very easy to make although there is little flavor to it. This dish uses many spices, but somehow is very bland. after viewing the number of stars & reviews I was expecting something a little tastier than what it was. Very disappointing.

Oustanding, i'd never slowcooked chops before, and my family loved these. The sauce came out a bit salty for my liking, and i think this was the store bought chicken broth i used.I will be roasting a chicken this sunday and will keep the carcass to make my own broth! Other than that, VERY tasty recipe, thanks! xxxx

I made this recipe exactly as given.  The flavor was exceptional; the chops were moist and delicious.  There was even enough sauce for my husband to smother his mashed potatoes!  It was super easy to prepare and good enough to serve at a dinner party.

I made it exactly how it said to minus the cloves of garlic (because I didn't have the time with 4 kids in the a.m.) plus added a little water since we'd be gone all day and didn't want them to dry out (which wouldn't have been a problem after all) The house smelled delicious when I walked in the door, the meat was so tender it fell apart. The whole family LOVED this! Will definitely make this again :)

At first, I didnt care for the smell of the concoction, but after it cooked, it had a very nice flavor and was plenty moist.  The family all enjoyed it.  Thank you for sharing.

I was so tired of doing recipes in the crockpot that used Cream of Mushroom soup or some other kind of soup.  This was a refreshing different recipe and we really liked it.  I pretty much followed the directions except per other reviews, I used a little less oil and a little more chicken broth (whole can).  I didn't have the oregano and basil so I just used an Italian mix and that worked fine.  Very easy to whip together and it turned out good, will definitely make it again.

It got mixed reviews in my household 2 adults and 4 kids. I did three pork chops but left the rest of the amounts the same since so many said they were dry. ours were not really dry just no one was overjoyed with them.

This is excellent!  I didn't have any oregano or poultry seasoning so I substituted 1 tsp Italian seasoning for the oregano and basil, and 1 tsp sage for the poultry seasoning.  I also used bone-in pork chops and it came out great.  This recipe is a real keeper.

This is an incredibly delicious pork chop recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding extra chicken broth to cover the pork chops so I wouldn't have to baste. The meat was so tender and yummy. I will definitely make this again.

Very good.  My only complaint was that the pork chops were dry.  It could be my slow cooker cooks a little hotter, though. Or, it might not have been at least half full, as well, which is important with slow cookers.  I cooked on low about 8 hours; next time I'd do 5  or 6 hours and see if that makes a difference.  Other than that, super easy and super flavorful.  I made a quick gravy with the drippings and corn starch--just whisked together over medium heat for a few minutes to get it to thicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't like this but i'm giving it 3 stars cause I did alter it a tad bit.  I didn't use the chicken broth and dissolved some boullion granules in 2 cups of water first.  I thought there was too much basil and oregano smell and taste and the pork was leaning on the dried side.  It tasted better when I thickened up the sauce with cornstarch at the end and drenched the pork with the gravy.  I won't be making this again.  It wasn't horrible but right on the borderline of being edible or not, but was edible.

I don't understand the rave reviews for this recipe. I followed it exactly as written. The spice combination was way off. It wasn't inedible, but we did not enjoy it and I will certainly never make this again.

Tasty pork chops.  I increased the number of pork chops to 8 and followed the recommendation of otheres to double the chicken broth (in my case I used 4 cups).  By doing so I didn't have to baste since the liquid covered the chops.  Will definitely make again.

This a great recipe. I followed as is with exception of cooking, I cooked on low for about 7 hours because I was at work. My bf and I were impressed by how flavorful it is. I put the extra juice over white rice and it really made a great meal!

Best pork chop recipe ever.  I didn't have paprika or poultry seasoning so I didn't use it and I prefer chicken stock instead of broth and I used bone in pork chops.  Other than that followed the recipe exact.  After only 3 hours the meat was falling off the bone and so juicy and tender.  Can't wait to go home for leftovers.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked it. Next time more garlic, less paprika. I doubled the sauce recipe but it made too much. I froze 1/2 to make another time. Will make again.

This is a very good recipe.  Like others said, it is a nice slow cooker alternative to the cream soup slow cooker recipes.  We enjoyed the pork chops very much.  My husband is really looking forward to the leftovers!

This was very good! My husband and I loved it and I am not very fond of pork. The only change I made was I added 1/4 cup of white wine for more flavor and liquid. Serve with rice or mashed potatoes and you have a winner! thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent!! My husband loved it.  I omitted the basil and added some cayenne pepper.  Browned the chops before putting them in the crock pot.  Will make again very soon.  I think next time I will add some sour cream like another review suggested.

This was a bit oily and "too herby" for my taste.  It was very very tender, pulled right off the bone.  Next time I think I'll experiment with the spices a bit to get the taste I like.

Had this last night. My 19 year helped me with it. He loves to cook. Everyone loved it. Even my picky eater ate 2 chops. My husband said, you don't even need a knife! They want me to keep this recipe forever. It only took 3 1/2 hours on HIGH for it to just want to fall apart.  I didn't have any poultry seasonings so I used a chicken rub I had and used 1/2 Tablespoon of that.

This was simply delicious!!  Best ever.  I quickly seared the chops in a pan on high heat to get that golden color and taste.  I also added another cup of stock per eveyone suggestion.  I used bone in chops which made it super rich.  I also cooked for 5 hours on high.  I will certainly make this again.

Pretty good, but I wish I would have cut back on the poultry seasoning because I think it was a tad overpowering. I will definitely make this again and tweak it to suit our personal taste.  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Very good.  Made recipe as written except I only had pork steaks instead of chops.  The smell throughout my house was to die for. They literally melted in our mouths. Thanks for a great recipe!

Turned out very dry, even though I always cover my crock pot with foil under the lid.  I used thick boneless chops that are very lean.  Maybe others used bone-in or fattier chops.

This was okay, not bad at all. I don't know if it was just me but it had a 'fish like' taste to it. It was a bit salty, but that I was probably my fault. Followed the recipe except I used only 1 TBSP of olive oil, 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth, and cooked on low for 6 hours. In the end I thickened the sauce up with some cornstarch and served it on top of the pork chops. Hubby liked it.

This was really good.  I omitted the oil and just used more chicken stock just to make it a little more figure-friendly and I didn't miss the oil one bit.  I also added some sliced onion and green bell pepper during the last couple hours.  I served this over some rice and the sauce made for a great gravy.  Adding this one to my rotation!  :)

this was great!! I did change it up a bit. I didn't use poultry seasoning or paprika and I added a little extra garlic to substitue for garlic powder. I also added 1 cup of italian dressing and a pinch of cayenne pepper...and covered the pork chops with barbeque so they wouldn't burn like everyone suggested.

I was a bit diappointed with this recipe.  The pork chops did fall off the bone as listed, however, the flavor, and moistness was missing somehow.  I also added red potatoes to the mix (which turned out great)to help complete the meal.  I too felt the recipe called for way too much oil.  I added 2T of oil and ended up discarding the broth after taking out the meat and potatoes.  It was okay, but I don't think we'll be making this one again.

It's a nice easy and flexible recipe. I used extra chicken broth as other reviews mentioned.  I also made a nice gravy to serve with the pork. I think next time I would play around with the spices. I was also thinking of trying his with chicken breast.  It's a great alternative to recipes with the creamed soups.

Very good flavor.  However, my chops were dry cooking on high for 4 hours.  In the future, I will cook at a lower setting in the crock.  Thanks for the recipe!

The pork came out nice and tender, but we just didn't care for the seasonings. The combination didn't work for us. Might be great for other people, though!

This was great!  I actually cooked it on low for 8 hours and I substituted chicken broth with beef broth - since that is all I had on hand.  They were juicy and fell apart easily with a fork.  I would recommend this.  Very tasty!

My husband usually hates pork chops because he finds them too dry.  He scraped his plate on this one, the meat were literally falling off the bone.  My only complaint is they were a little greasy...I will cut back on the oil next time.

Very tender, but on the dry side. Next time I will cook the pork chops on low. Otherwise very tender just had to add the liquid mixture on top of the chops.

Very good. Used 6 chops with the bone and 2 cups broth. Since these chops have more fat in them, I didn't feel I needed to added much oil,if any. I also doubled the garlic and threw in some onion chunks. I think the boneless chops would work much better so you won't have to worry about fishing out the bones.

I would have rated this 3 1/2 stars if possible.  It was not wonderful but it was not bad either just okay.  I will make this again since my family ate it without any complaint. It was easy and the meat was tender.  Thanks for the recipe.

We didn't love this.  It had a "funky" flavor, as my husband said.  I think it was the poultry seasoning.  It didn't stay very moist either, which was a bummer.  Not one I'd make again.

Although this recipe was very easy to follow, and the pork chops did come out tender, my husband and I didn't care for it at all. I'm not sure what we were expecting, but it didn't taste the way we thought it would. I won't be making this again.

It tasted pretty good.  I agree with previous reviews to cook longer.  I cooked mine recommended time and it was kind of dry.  Not one of my very favorites, but I will probably make this again.

I cooked on low for 8hrs instead of high because I NEVER crock on high.  But the flavor left much to be desired, and it was actually pretty dry -- which I honestly didn't know could happen with a crock pot recipe.

This was really good.
I'll definately be using it again. But I'm going to use it on a pork roast instead of chops.

Made this for guests and we all loved it.  Served with green beans   with sesame and Quinoa.  Might be a good idea to inbcrease marinade.

Tender and succulent, with a wonderful flavour.  I used Moroccan Spice in stead of Chicken Spice and halved all the flavourings.  1 Tablespoon of oil was enough.  Added a tablespoon of Balsamic Vinegar, as recommended by an earlier reviewer; very nice.  Cooked it on LOW for 8 hours and turned the chops a few times.  Served with Mexican Rice III, without the spices. Next time I make this I would probably give it 5 stars; I would leave the garlic powder out and use thinner chops (the centre of the chops were a bit tasteless).

I thought this recipe was just average.  I am not a fan of poultry seasoning....maybe that's why.

I'm sorry but I didn't care for this at all. I have to agree w/ SJPARK757 & say that IMO these spices don't complement each other. I used 3 chops instead of four but did not decrease the sauce ingredients. I used fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder & I cut back on the parika a lot (only used about half) & initially I only used half the oregano...I added some fresh chopped oregano during the last half hour of cooking. I cooked this on low for 6 hours using medium thickness chops & while tender they were slightly dry. I followed suggestions to baste this several times & it did smell wonderful while cooking...I just wish it tasted as good as it smelled. I plated it & garnished w/ a bit of fresh blooming oregano & served it w/ asparagus parmesan crust (from this site) & a cuke & onion salad.

No one gave these 5 stars in my house. You may want to cut back on the garlic. It was overwhelming--even to this garlic lover. The chops actually tasted a bit better the next day, when flavors had mellowed.

Very easy and fell apart!  Although they tasted great, I may follow another reviewers suggestion and add some balsamic vinegar next time.  Definitely will be making these again.

It was VERY easy to make, but we weren't  too impressed with the flavor, and we defineately didn't like using the sauce over noodles or rice.

These were okay.  Still searching for a slow cooker recipe.
