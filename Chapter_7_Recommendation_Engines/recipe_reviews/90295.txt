Yummy! I replaced the white flour with Whole wheat pastry flour,Milk for skim milk,Splenda for the sugar & used egg beater's in place of the egg's.replaced applesauce(homade-no sugar with cinnamon) for the oil in the batter,Added 1 Tsp cinnamon to the batter.I grated 2 large honey crisp apple's (skins on) into the batter.Put the cinnamon/splenda mixture in a brown bag, placed the fritters in the bag & shook to coat.I also used my small cookie dough scoop to put them into the hot oil.Worked perfectly!They poofed out very well.A very nice size to handle for adult's & kid's.Very quick and super easy!Slightly crisp on the outside,moist,tender and fluffy on the inside.Great morning treat while we went on our Autumn walk!Great with Coffee!My kid's loved them.No leftover's,Alway a bonus! I will be making these again! I am thinking of trying pumpkin next time!YUM!!Thanks for a great recipe :)

I used Braeburn apples and added cinnamon to the batter, and they were very tasty when tossed with cinnamon and sugar. I dusted half of the batch with powdered sugar, but I prefer them dusted with cinnamon and sugar. It's a good idea to drop small spoonfuls of the batter into the oil because the fritters will expand, and they will retain too much oil (and will be soggy) if they're too big.

Amazing with a little tweaking. I cut the apples in very, very tiny pieces. I doubled the batter, but not the apples. I doubled the sugar and added 2 tsp. of cinnamon. Drop by tablespoon or even teaspoon, depending on how large you want them. They puff up quite a bit. Do NOT make them too large or the center will still be raw. I also found that 375 was a bit too warm, I cooked them @ 350. They came out amazingly, way better than the fair! You actually get little pieces of apple in every bite! They were wicked easy to make! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  These will be a treat for my family for a long time.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The batter turns out nice and poofy.  I did realize soon that I needed to drop the temperature on my oil, but once through that firs test batch, I had no problems.  I was lazy and used my Chop Wizard, leaving the skins on, but this is a really great way to wake up.

This was excellent! I doubled the batter with the same amount of apples. Added 1T of cinnamon to the base recipe. Then instead of sprinkling with cinnamon sugar, used a glaze of 2C confectioners sugar to 6 Tablespoons of milk. The kids & hubby were begging to add to our favorites file!

These weren't flat enough- they were more like dumplings. Next time I'll try piping the batter into the oil to try to get it flatter.

The batter wasn't sweet enough for my taste. The end result was more like a puffy, savory, scone. Next time I'll add a lot more sugar to the batter and glaze them.

The apple to batter ratio was too high. The apple pieces burnt in the oil. I'm going to double the batter next time.

Very Good.  Used applesauce in place of the oil in the batter to cut the grease.

These are fabulous! I added cinnamon to the batter as suggested and made a simple glaze to top them with. They are best after sitting for awhile to crisp over!

I used slightly less apple than called for, as this is what I had on hand and it was plenty.  (used approx 2 1/2 cups, finely diced apple)  Next time I would grate the apple, to avoid the 'chunky' look of the fritter.  I added approx 1 t cinnamon to the batter and 1/4 t nutmeg.  I agree that 350 is hot enough for the oil.  They must get quite brown to be fully cooked.  I had a few that were not fully cooked in center.  This recipe makes a LOT of batter.  After frying about 1/2 the batter, I had 18 fritters.  I took the other 1/2 of the batter and made 6 quick muffins.  Just put the extra batter into muffin papers and baked at 400 for about 22 minutes.  Next time I'll make only a 1/2 recipe of the batter and maybe even cut back the apple portion to 2 cups.

this was plain but good with the powdered sugar.  However, if you top it with vanilla ice cream(or cool whip) and chocolate syrup drizzled on top, it tastes just like the sundae waffles from six flags great america. yummy.  I will make this again as a sundae.

These are so delicious.  I did double the sugar and add a tsp of cinnamon, though.  For those who say that they pop up in the oil too much, and come out too thick, use 2 spoons as you are dropping them in and spread the dough  out with the spoons.  Works great - especially if you are using a pan to fry instead of a deep fryer.

The thing to remember with apple fritters is that you're not making a "dough" but rather a batter, like pancake batter.  The perfect apple fritter should be fairly flat and crispy on the outside but light and fluffy on the inside.  This recipe is a great start but you need to fiddle around with the amount of liquid in it to get the consistency you prefer.

Yummy!  I always stay away from recipes that require deep frying.  I made an exception in this case and I'm glad.  We enjoyed these little guys. I followed the recipe as written, cutting the apples into very small pieces.  I do not have a deep fryer and I don't have a thermometer to gauge oil temperature, so I winged it.  I used a high-sided frying pan, threw the oil in and dropped the batter when I thought the oil looked hot enough. Pure guess on my part. The first batch cooked too quickly (outside crisp, inside uncooked.)  So I just lowered the heat on my stove top and took it from there.  That worked and all other batches cooked through.  I'm giving this info because I suspect there are  others like me who don't deep fry.  This is very doable and worth the effort. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This is a basic fritter batter which I have used for decades for making all kinds of fritters. For most fruit fritters I add cinnamon to the batter to amp up the flavor. The outcome taste wise when it comes to apple fritters depends a lot on what variety of apple you use. This batter, minus the cinnamon, makes great corn fritters which are wonderful when eaten hot with maple syrup. Also the flavor of cinnamon sugar will vary depending on the ratio of cinnamon to sugar. My rule of thumb is 1 part cinnamon to 4 parts granulated sugar. Cinnamon may also be added to powdered sugar for dusting.

This was great:)
But i had to adjust a few things...
The batter was too dry so i added applesauce & vanilla to fix that and boost the flavor
the apples were a little undercooked so next time ill cook them a bit before adding to the batter
But i definitely will make them again :)

This is the best apple fritters ever!!!  I used 1/4 cup of sugar because I like my stuff sweet.  I also used one apple, instead of two.  These fritters came out with a light crisp on the outside and soft in the inside.  This is a new family favorite.....

Excellent recipe!  My kids ate it up which shows its a winner!  I used 3 regular sized apples and used applesauce instead of oil in the mix.  I also shook a bunch of cinnamon into the dough.  I made a sugar glaze out of powdered sugar, milk and lemon extract.   The only problem I had was getting the temperature just right so they wouldn't burn.

I added some ground cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. Dropped by heaping teaspoons, the fritters cooked for about 2 1/2 minutes on each side.  Perfect. I had some leftover, so to reheat, I nuked them for a few seconds then placed them on a rack in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes to crisp them up a bit.  Although they were not nearly as good as the freshly-fried fritters, they were quite respectable.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

They were ok, but not much flavor. I would suggest adding either some apple pie spice or nutmeg to the batter. Kids liked them. Very easy to make and quick.

A+++ Perfect recipe. Thank you ABBY9. I followed the recipe exactly as written and these were excellent. Great for a fall night snack after some hide and seek in the dark with our 7 children.

These were really good! I read all the reviews so added 2 tbs white sugar to the batter instead of just one, 2 tsp cinnamon and a couple pinches of nutmeg.  I always use almond milk because we don't drink regular milk.  I turned the deep fryer on 350 which worked out really good.  I also made these bite sized since everyone said they puffed up so much.  I rolled some in cinnamon sugar, some in powdered sugar and some I topped with a powdered sugar mixed with water glaze.  Most liked the cinnamon sugar the best.

Just made this for husband and me. He liked them so much I was lucky to get any. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon to the batter and rolled them in cinnamon sugar once they cooled just a little. They were delicious! Thank you so much for such a great recipe. I will be making them again.

just finished making and eating these little gems. Delicious. Seriously. The ONLY thing I did differently was add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the batter. We also used a powdered sugar/milk glaze instead of the cinnamon sugar mix. Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe!

Obviously, I must have done something wrong with this recipe.  I did everything as stated, but they came out really soft and not very tasty!

These were absolutely delicious!  My husband and I devoured these.  They are easy to make and taste great.  The only changes I made were to add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter, but otherwise I followed the directions.  I can't wait to make these again!

So tasty! What an easy recipe to satisfy a fried sweet treat craving. As is with every time I try a new recipe I followed the first time as is and they were fabulous. The second time as an experiment I added about a teaspoon of anise to the batter which turned into a lovely variation.

Used 1 apple and cut it up into small pieces, halved the rest of the ingredients.  Cooked in my deep fryer.  Fast, easy and delish!  I don't like overly sweet things.  This is great, puffed up nicely ( so drop small gobs into the oil!)

This recipe was amazing ! I Use a cast iron skillet and a candy thermometer to keep the oil in range because I didn't have an electric skillet and that worked just fine!  My family loves this!!!

I followed the recipe and instructions exactly as they are and the fritters are good, but they're not as sweet as I was expecting them to be.  My family enjoyed them, but I only enjoyed the bites that had apple in them.

Didn't have apples so I used oranges, ran out of flour so I used cornstarch instead- no cinnamon so I used chili powder- I don't know why they didn't taste anything like the recipe??

these turned out great! added about 1/4 more flour, an extra Tbsp of sugar, a tsp of cinnamon, and before rolling in cinnamon sugar, I drizzled confectioner's sugar glaze over them while still hot. Boyfriend can't stop eating them!

Good recipe but I changed it up some, I adjusted my serving size to 12 and than Use self rising flour instead, add tbsp of sugar instead of  the tsp that was suggested, and a tbsp of apple sauce add a dash of cinnamin and substitute oil in batter for butter.  They came out so crisp and fluffy on the inside and was mouth watering.  Remeber chop your apples up small.  Enjoy

Loved 'em! Used dehydrated apple slices that I soaked in cold water for about 5 minutes, then chopped up. You couldn't even tell. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon per others' suggestion. I used a tablespoon to drop the dough in the oil. They took about 1 1/2 minutes per side to cook. Perfect size. Be sure to roll them in the sugar mixture while hot or the sugar won't stick. My kids are already asking for more.

perfect..Apple fritters can be made 2 ways, Like these, which, to me are a true Apple fritter, or a flatter version with apple rings..This is the way apple fritters should be fluffy and round, delicious rolled in  the Cinnamon Sugar afterward...

I just got done making these for breakfast, I grated the apples instead of cutting them in pieces, added a little more sugar, and used a small cookie scoop,  I also turned the temp down as 375 was to high, so cooked them at 350 they turned out wonderful, and I used the cinnamon and sugar as a topping, my family really enjoyed these, and these are so easy to make, and tasted much better than store brought, thank you for the receipe.

I just finished frying up some of these yummy fritters.  They passed the hubby test. I like that there is not much sugar in the recipe, hopefully a friend with diabetes can have 1 or 2. I kept a few out without cinnamon and sugar just for him. 
I doubled the recipe so there would be plenty for my small group from church. 
I did add the extra cinnamon to the batter but other then that I followed it to the "T". I used Honey Crisp apples.
I will definitely be making these again and again and............

They turned out great!  Reminded me of the ones my grandma used to make. Cut the apples up into small pieces.  They did get quite dark before they were cooked through - but did not turn out greasy.  Maybe made them a little too large.  Next time will add a little vanilla and cinnamon to the batter, but were really good made as stated.

These came out perfectly for me, crispy on the outside and fluffy and moist on the inside.  The only things I changed were to toss my apples in a bit of lemon juice and I added about 1/4t of cinnamon to the batter.  I dropped in about a tablespoon of batter per fritter.  My apples had a slight bite to them when they were cooked, which I like but if you don't make sure to dice the apples really finely.  They are loaded with apple to the point that every bite has some in it, so if you don't like that much then maybe don't make an apple fritter just do plain doughnut style fritters.

I converted this to make it vegan.  I added vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  Swapped out apple sauce for egg, soy milk for milk, and doubled the baking powder.  They turned out delicious and next time I'm going to dice the apple smaller and make mimi fritters!!!

Extremely bland. I added more sugar to the batter and some cinnamon but they were still bland. Kind of like eating a piece of fried bread with an apple here and there.

easy to make and tasty too ~ you can't go wrong with this recipe.  I did add apple pie spice to the batter and sprinkled powdered sugar on the tops instead of the cinnamon sugar.  fun way to use up part of a box of apples gifted to us.  thank you!

The only thing I did differently with this recipe is add some cinnamon to the batter.  My hubby and 7 year old loved these but I was disappointed.  They weren't sweet enough for my taste.

These were OK, but not what I remember as a kids.  Although my kids and husband did like them.  I would add some nutmeg or cinnamon to the batter the next time.

Made it for the first time as kids wanted some dessert and had nothing readily available. I use light olive oil as I had no vegetable oil. Once done I sprinkled with confectioners sugar and cinnamon powder. My son said he wouldn't even taste it because of the cooked apples in it but he did and couldn't stop eating them! He even asked to take some to school next day as a snack! I covered them and didn't refrigerate and next morning they were as delicious! Definitely a keeper and so easy and quick to make! Thanks for  sharing!

My fella wanted donuts this morning but the weather was much too bad to leave the house. In my search for a donut recipe I stumbled across this one. So glad I did! I I mixed a little confectioners sugar with water to glaze the top and then sprinkled the cinnamon sugar atop that. Yum!

Light and fluffy  - like a cloud!  We added a banana cut up as I didn't have enough apple. Worked like a charm.  Lovely recipe - my boys and I had so much fun making (and eating ) them!

These were real yummy but I missed the yeast dough taste.  When I worked at a bakery years ago we used to use the same dough as our French bread.  We would simple use apple pie filling and cut it into the dough until mixed in well and deep fry and then glaze them.  I make these quite a bit by cheating and buying a frozen French bread loaf from the bakery department and a can or two of apple pie filling (trust me, most grocery store bakeries use frozen product.)  Makes a lot for a crowd, and very easy and inexpensive!

Excellent. Tripled sugar in batter. Added 1t vanilla (don't go heavy)  and 1t cinnamon to batter. (Next time use 1/2t cinnamon) Reduced apples to 1 1/2 cup (2 apples) diced fine. Oil on medium heat. Spread flat to cook center. Thicker portions were most like cider donuts. Flat, thinner portions like crispy funnel cake. We enjoyed both.  Go very light on cinnamon in sugar coating. Cook till Med dark brown.

These were really good. I added 1t. of vanilla and 3T. of sugar.  If you want them a little more lighter and airier let the batter sit for 30 minutes.  They will be light and not so dense. I also used a cookie scoop instead of spoon, just makes them more  uniform puffy balls.

The fritters were good but the recipe needed some tweaking to make it better. I added another 1/3 cup of milk for a total of 1 cup as the batter was way too thick, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and for the cinnamon-sugar I used 1/2 cup of sugar to 2 tbsps cinnamon, I used 2 tbsps of the cinnamon sugar in the batter as I was using Spartan apples which are tart. I used my #50 scoop which yielded 13 larger fritters, 2 minutes a side was perfect, I still had extra cinnamon sugar even with halving, 1 cup was way too much.

The best apple fritter recipe I know of. (I've tried a lot) I changed nothing it was perfect. They came out nice and fluffy with crisp outside. This is a traditional fritter recipe if you want it to look like the apple fritter doughnuts at the bakery use a funnle. To people complaining about this recipe having a dumpling consistency " your over stirring " stir until the dry ingredients are mixed in, then add apples. I strongly suggest making the recipe as is, before changing. Thank you Abby  for sharing your families recipe. My family, friends, and coworkers love it. I see this becoming a traditional recipe for my family also.

Excellent - airy and not greasy. Halved the recipe just to make as an evening snack and it worked perfectly.  Only needed one pink lady apple and it was just "applely" enough. Wouldn't change a thing (and that's a rarity - I love to tweak recipes!)

They were okay at first, but weren't that flavorful and not sweet enough to be an actual fritter. This was a lot of work for not that great of a reward. They didn't keep well either and ended up turning soggy and stale after one night. A big waste of time, energy, and money.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  This was a quick and easy recipe for breakfast or brunch.  These cooked up perfectly with a light, soft inside and a nice crunch on the outside.  I cooked them in my cool daddy, as I have had good luck with when frying donuts in it. Will definitely make these again.

Good but definitly needs cinnamon and extra sugar in the batter. I think a glaze goes better than the cinnamon and sugar topping too. Next time I'll make them tbsp size with hotter oil. Cooking large fritters with the oil at about 320 degrees ensured they were cooked through, but the big ones didn't have much crisp on the outside. Great recipe to play with. Side note , I followed the advice of some reviewers and grated the apple. I recommend NOT doing this if you want to be able to notice pieces of apple in the finished fritter. Using the large hole side of my grater still made the apple so small it was nearly completely incorporated in the batter.

Just like my Grandmother used to make for us.  Instead of cinnamon sugar, we ate these with maple syrup poured over them.  Brought back wonderful memories.

I feel as if I can actually review the recipe, not having changed a thing.  Today is one of those final hoorahs of cool weather.  We stayed in and watched TV while enjoying these wonderful little fritters with a cup of mulled cider.  WONDERFUL!  I didn't think the recipe needed any fussing with at all!

I used coconut,barley and white flour, raw sugar, doubled the batter, added extra cinnamon, nutmeg, and used almond oil & a little olive oil for cooking, they turned out too good, shared with neighbor and froze some. I would make this again, I tried to make a unhealthy snack somewhat healthy if that makes any sense.

Very good batter. I improved it a bit by replacing half of the milk with my homemade yogurt, added some vanilla and rum. Next time around I'll cut the apples a bit smaller and reduce the amount to only two cups. Also I've found that for me, rolling the fritters in sugar didn't work too good, so I either use a mix of sugar powder with cinnamon to sprinkle or us some chocolate syrup on top.
More-so;  I can definitely see it made with bananas as well.

My children loved these.  I thought it was good as written.  I added some cinnamon and a little extra sugar to the batter as well as some nutmeg and a little mace, which I think added just the right amount of spice.

I just made these and they’re terrible.... the apples are too hard and the batter tastes bland and gross. I’m very disappointed. Other recipes tell you to cook your apples in cinnamon and sugar before incorporating with batters or doughs which I would imagine gives the fritter some flavor. I am so sad, so very very sad.

Made few batches following the recipe. I tried substituting flour  and other dry ingredients with Bisquick. What an improvement! Lighter and fluffier!
Also have tried various flavor enhancers and fruits. Pineapple and coconut extract, Peanut Butter Caramel powder with apple. Have enjoyed them all.

So very easy to make and yummy.  I added 2 t of cinnamon in flour.  Also, I put batter in to oil from bowl.  It is a thick batter so it does not come out fast.  Don't put batter in thick, thin it out it will cook quicker and not get really dark on outside.  Highly recommend.

Turned out great, and my kids love them. I doubled the recipe and it made a lot of fritters. The only change I made was adding a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla to the batter. 

They're the perfect level of sweetness with the cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top

Instructions were easy to follow and for a first time attempt they turned out really well.  I would absolutely make these again.  They were a quick and easy desert treat for our holiday meal but would be a great addition to any occasion!

Totally my new favorite autumn treat! I substituted wheat free, gluten free flour and used  probably a cup more apples than called for. I always use extra fruit! They turned out just perfect!!

no changes, I will make this again regularly!

I chose to make this with the pulp leftover after using my cider press, but I may try it again with apples out of season, fresh from the store!

They were light and tasty, quick, easy, and made the house smell fantastic!

LOVE LOVE LOVE these fritters!!!!
Big thank you to your mom & you for the recipe.
Made these several times already.
Hint- noticed the ones I make towards the end, the dough comes out fluffier. Tonight, I left the dough in a bowl for about 20 minutes covered with in Saran Wrap before frying the fritters. All of the fritters were definitely fluffier this way.

Made it for first time modifying spices as I didn’t have vanilla or cinnamon. I added cloves, nutmeg and ginger and rolled them out in brown sugar. They were much better than the ones from coffee shop.

I made these exactly the way the recipe said to. The fritters were light and fluffy but didn't have a lot of flavour. So the second time I made them I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon. They were melt in your mouth delicious. They didn't even need to be rolled in cinnamon sugar. This is definitely a recipe I will be using again and again!!!

I added 1/4C of my own Cinnamon Sugar mixture to the batter, on top of the 1Tbsp that was called for. Used Buttermilk because I was out of whole milk. Fried them for 2.5 minutes a side and they were awesome! Side Note: Use Saigon Cinnamon, rather than regular. It has a MUCH better flavor.

I've made these every fall, for the last several years. Can't believe I've never reviewed it! My family loves these! We have lots of apple trees and I gather some in a bowl, remove all the spots/bruises and chop them for these. I like to make them in the early fall, on a crisp day. The kids come home from school and smell these and gets everyone in the fall spirit!

I did not  have any all purpose flour on hand.  So I substituted and used self rising flour instead.  added about 1 shake of baking powder, and, (wallah), perfect.  I glazed a few, then cinnamon and sugar, with glaze drizzle for the rest.  My son really likes them, and I had to eat two right away.  A very  fast and tasty treat.  Used apple filling out of a can.  perfect crowd pleaser.

I diced the apples & made them like I make my apple pie filling.  Then I just dumped the entire bowl into the batter.  They were so good!  No sugar or oil in the batter.  (the apple pie filling had enough sugar) I vanilla glazed.  Don't cover right away they get soft.

Quick, easy and yummy!   First time making fritters- followed the recipe and the only thing I changed was to drop the heat of oil a touch and decrease the cooking time.  Had I not done that, they’d have been “crispy little fritters”- as in BURNT.   Maybe it’s because I live at a higher altitude.  Anyway, these are a delicious treat!   Thanks for sharing!

Don’t change anything! It looks like the ratio of apples to batter is too even, but it is just right! Trust the recipe! Fry in spoon-size pieces for the best results. I chopped the apples to small pieces instead of chunks so they’d cook as fast as the batter. Great recipe...and really easy.

AWESOME RECIPE, FINALLY!!

I have tried several different apple fritter recipes and most of them were good, but the batter was wrong, or they cooked clumpy, these cook in fry in whatever size or shape you want them too, I always add a touch more sugar, and a lot more cinnamon, I also like making a light glaze by using a 1 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/3 cup of milk... try it, it's awesome!

This recipe had no flavor in the batter.  I rechecked the recipe and I made it per directions.

Love these! Super quick and easy. I was looking for a substitute for doughnuts for my son who is allergic to eggs and milk. I replaced the milk with coconut milk and used an egg free egg replacer for the egg. I grated 1 apple into the batter to avoid chunks of apple for my son. Next time I will add a little cinnamon to the batter for increased flavor.

Fabulous! Better by far than any we’ve ever bought! And, as I have to be gluten-free, which means I can’t eat the bought ones any more, I’m delighted to have this recipe! I substituted King Arthur 1 to 1 gf flour, but there are plenty of others available. 

We tried adding a combination of cinnamon and clove into the icing for apple butter taste, or cardamom for a citrusy zing. More combinations in our future. 

Thank you!

Thank you for sharing the deliciousness!  I wanted a quick dessert on a crisp fall day, the deep fryer was already out, and so everything just came together :-)  I lowered the temp as per some reviews and they didn't take 5 minutes, maybe 4.  I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg because we like it and used butter instead of oil (because BUTTER).  I should have followed your directions and cut the apples roughly, I followed another review who found the pieces too big so I cut them small...but I missed the chunks of tart Granny Smith apple, and I've made a note of it for next time.  I rarely deep fry anything, I drag that thing out of limbo maybe twice a year - but your Mom's apple fritters, along with MY Mom's corn fritters, will be on the semi-annual fry fest menu now ;-)  Cheers!

These were amazing.  The only changes I made were using 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 apple cider instead of 2/3 cup milk, and added 1 Tbsp of cinnamon to the batter.  We did half with the cinnamon sugar mix and then half with the apple cider glaze from the Apple Cider Glazed Doughnuts recipe.  The fritters with the glaze were by far the favorite.  I used a small scoop for most and then tried just dropping some in the oil to make bigger fritters.  The bigger ones were more crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  We will definitely be trying this one again.

This  recipe is good in that it is simple and uses a lot of apple in the batter. But the taste left something to be desired. Perhaps more salt? More cinnamon? I used honey crisp apple. At 375 degrees oil, the outside of fritter turned brown quickly, but the inside was still gooey. They are tasty in cinnamon sugar, but not a hit out of the park. I need to compare to other fritter recipes.

It was good, but "something" was missing.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  Made it just as written.  Glazed with a powdered sugar/cinnamon glaze.

I didn't want to spoil my original review with comments, so here are some now.   I made one change.  I cooked the apple bits. I put a tablespoon of butter in a fry pan, added the apple bits after the butter started turning brown, then sprinkled on a tablespoon of cinnamon.  I cooked them until the majority were sort of translucent.  
I would use less milk next time.  The mixture was too runny.  Perhaps I will try 1/2 cup instead of 2/3.

These are very bland. The batter needs cinnamon and sugar. Also, the temperature is too high. 350 degrees was better. With some tweaking, these could be really good

I found this to be very bland good texture but really not much taste the batter was not sweet  I even coated the outside with the sugar and cinnamon like the recipe called for right after taking out of the hot oil buy it did not stick so I drizzled icing over them and they still were not very sweet. Followed recipe to a tee. Sorry but I will no try this one again

I loved how easy this recipe was!! I doubled the sugar added 1tsp of cinnamon to the batter and then doubled the recipe except kept the Apple amount the same and holy cow I don’t think I’ll ever get them from a bakery again!! So soft and I’m not a big fryer person but it was really easy and fast to fry these

Fantastic recipe, I made them smaller and it made about 20 fritters.  Coated some with glaze and some with the cinnomin sugar, both were delicious!  Simple recipe with great results!

good but not as sweet as I would have liked. I put in a teaspoon of cinnamon like the comments suggested but still was not as sweet. I also halved the apples and that made it better.

These are very good, i did half with a simple glaze and half with cinnamon and sugar. Very easy,  I started frying when my oil was at 340 degrees and it got a little hotter after each batch, the last batch i turned off the heat. This would be a great treat to make when grand kids are visiting.   They stay hot in the middle  longer than you expect so if your eating them fresh check and make sure the inside is not to hot before popping one in your mouth like i did.

They are amazing. It was such a big hit for the adults and for the children. Next time I make it, which I will for sure, I will put 1/2-1 teaspoon of sugar with the dry ingredients instead of 1 tablespoon. The apples were very sweet so it didn’t need a tablespoon of sugar. Delicious recipe!!

Very easy and delicious, great base to add any fruits or toppings you'd like. I'm going to try adding half & half tonight only because I find the fritter itself to lack flavor and sweetness without the cinnamon sugar topping.

This recipe is great.  It is super easy and totally yummy.  I also tried it with chopped mango instead of apple but that did not turn out as well (meaning I didn't like the taste as much) so I will definitely stick with the apples.

I did give it a 5 star rating b/c the recipe cannot change the fact that after frying this delicious confection, you may have a fritter that appears under cooked, but this is not the case. The moistness of the apple seeps into the batter and it just appears under cooked  but it is not! I did two batches, one at 350 and one at 375 and preferred the 375 temp. Added 1/4 cup white sugar and grated the 3 apples which were MacIntosh--thus the juice afterwards. But these delicious fritters were gone within minutes so the family says YES to this wonderful fritter! It is a permanent recipe in my file...

I followed the recipe exactly except I only had 2 1/2 cups of apples and fried them in a 10 1/4" iron skillet. No problem with them being flat enough. :)

Next time I am going to substitute 1/3  buttermilk for milk, and use chopped pineapple (undrained)  instead of apple, and allow for the pineapple juice to replace some of the remaining milk.

My Mom used to make these all the time, They were so good.  I made them for my kids. So good hot, with some maple syrup on top. I also have tried using Banana, which isn't as good as apple. I have also made these with Strawberries and they were good as well.  I think this recipe is the same one I have, if  not it is close.

I did make some changes. I made half batch, added cinnamon and more sugar to the batter, and a little vanilla. I finely diced 1 apple, added a little lemon juice and cinnamon sugar,let them sit awhile,  then just before adding to batter I mixed a little flour into the apples.  I fried in a cast iron deep skillet on the stove, so I may have cooked them a little too fast since its difficult to figure out the temp. They weren't golden brown, but they did look like what we get from the bakery. I made a glaze that I brushed over them, after sprinkling them with cinnamon sugar. It isn't easy to keep hubby away while they cool completely, but he loved them.

My family loved this. Apple fritters are my husband and daughters favorite and my daughter said they were the best she'd ever had. Even my son, who does not like store bought apple fritters loved them. Like another reviewer I had the oil too hot at first and they weren't done on the inside. I turned it down and used a wooden spoon to flatten the batter out thin when I put it in. They cooked all

This was easy and delicious- my family and kids loved it. I reduced the sugar to half a cup and it was still amazing - sprinkled the fritters with icing sugar (confectioner's sugar). Don't have cinnamon sugar so I used white sugar. Will be doing this again. Thanks for posting!

This sure beats eating most bought donuts/fritters!  I followed some of the advice of reviewers and added 3 Tbsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and lightly cooked my chopped apples with 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Everybody really liked these and they were gone in no time!  Since I don't have deep fryer, I'll only make these on special occasions or  before I need to fry other food.

I used Granny  Smith apples and the turned out great. I like things a little tangy, and the balance of the apples and cinnamon sugar  blended perfectly. The bread part was nice and fluffy.  Would definitely make again.

Will definitely make this again but with a few changes. First, the temperature is way too high. If you do put it at that temperature leave it for 3 minutes tops on each side (if you use a deep fryer) or they will burn. They aren't flat like they would be in a donut shop but they are very good. Next time will make these with icing sugar to see how they taste!

These were a big hit in our house! This was my first time making any kind of fritter and it went very well. I made this recipe as instructed but a previous reviewer had mentioned that they kept  the amount of chopped apples the same but doubled the ingredients for the batter, I did the same. I ended up with the a double amount of fritters which was a good thing because they were eaten up very quickly, great recipe!

This was a very good base recipe, I added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and sugar mixed, to the batter.  I used 2 soup spoons to shape the fritters, cooked for 6 and a half minutes. Next time I might add a bit more cinnamon and maybe a little brown sugar. I will be making this again!

These were very good.  They came out nice and moist, with good apple flavor.  If I made them again, I would add a little more sugar to the batter, but otherwise they were great.  I don't usually deep fry anything but used our deep fryer and it was fast and easy to make them.

I first had these in Denmark, when serving in the Royal Navy.  Since then, as an erstwhile chef, I have made them countless times.  For those who think that fritters should always be flat,  cut the apples into smaller pieces and your goal can be achieved.  Incidentally, try eating them with maple syrup, the realm stuff not the imitation and definitely not with pancake syrup.

Excellent recipe.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon as suggested, substituted 50/50 whole wheat and white flour, and chopped the apples very finely.  I also added a squirt of lemon in the batter, as well as just before serving.  It is delicious with the sweetness and tartness together.  I've made 2 batches now, since my kids ate so many!

I followed the recipe exactly and had great results. I don't care about what shape they are (mine came out round like a donut hole but bigger) I care about taste and they are delicious. I don't have a thermometer I just heated some oil in a pan and used a small ice cream/melon scoop. Wonderful!! :)

I had these growing up, and we drizzled maple syrup instead of the sugar dusting and mixed cinnamon in the batter.  These are excellent.

I thought they were just okay, my mother didn't like them at all; she thought they were too "doughy" even though they were fully cooled. She even baked hers and still didn't like it. I can see where kids would like them a lot. Probably won't make again. Maybe they'll be better tomorrow?? Fun to try something different, but not crazy about them. I also must say I made NO changes, I can't rate something if I don't make it as written.

Made these for my boyfriend (following the recipe exactly  as I always do for my reviews). I'm not a fan of apple fritters and he really enjoyed them. I liked them because they kind of reminded me of churros with the cinnamon sugar on top. We both agreed that next time I should add some cinnamon to the batter and maybe double the sugar for the next batch. Will definitely make them again. BF loves them and they are easy enough.

I am currently off work and using the time to teach my 13 yr old son how to cook. He wanted to try a desert first.  We made this the first time following the recipe exactly. The first batch turned out alright, however the apples were still a little raw.  He wanted to try again and I suggested that we saute the apples in butter and brown sugar before we added them to the batter.  He sauteed the apples in 1 tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of brown sugar on low heat for about 3 min, added them to the batter and tried gain. The second batch turned out much better. He asks everyday when we can make them again.

It was very good.  I omitted the oil in the batter, and used two large apples chopped finely.  I mixed the apples with 1/3 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon before mixing it with the batter.

this received mixed reviews from the boys in my family: some really, really loved it and others didn't care for it much. I thought it was a little bland. I will probalby make them again but add some cinnamon and vanilla extract to the batter. 
Oh, and I didn't use more than 1 c of oil and only used about 1/3 c of the cinnamon sugar to dip them in.

Delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter and I chopped my apples really small.  I used an ice cream scoop and some pieces of apple fell out into the oil and made bite size delights of apple fritter! My husband loved them! This recipe is a keeper!

these were pretty good! i added extra cinnamon to the recipe and a dash of pure vanilla. Only cause my husband has a sweet tooth. Mine came out fine. As with any deep fry is it important not to overcrowd your frying oil to keep it at an even temperature. I have a small fry daddy and only fried three up at a time. Time consuming but husband liked them.  Tip: if you put too many in the fryer, they will come out soggy because your oil temp will vary.

Delicious! We couldn't cook them fast enough; the entire family devoured them. We didn't have egg, so we added 6 tablespoons of water instead and cut up two apples, and added cinnamon to the batter.

I made it exactly as written.  At first I had the oil too hot and the fritter size too large which, of course meant that the middle was raw.  Once I lowered the temperature and made them smaller they came out perfect.  They were very tasty.  Kids will love them.

If the recipe is followed, you can't go wrong and they're very good.  However, I made a batch when the humidity was very high and I had to throw them away the next day as they were soggy even though I put them in a highly sealed container as soon as they were cool.

Very easy and tasty.  I only used half of the recipe since I was making these for just 2 of us and the left overs got soft so this was another reason. Prefer them hot & crispy!

I will definitely make again!  Just an FYI, I put the cinnamon sugar on right after it came out of the oil and they ended up with too much so next time I will cool them for a few minutes.

I gave this four stars because although I thought it was fairly tasteless, my husband really liked it.  I did add about a teaspoon of cinnamon directly onto the apple chunks before adding the apples to the batter.  I thought the batter definitely needed more sweetness, but my husband thought it was deliciously understated, and the sweetness of the apples (we really got lucky here!) added the sweetness necessary.  I will look for another apple fritter recipe that is sweeter with more flavor to the batter.

Super easy and sooo good. The only thing that I changed was the time for frying. I used our deep fryer set to 375 and it only took less than a minute on each side. I can't wait to make these again.

Made this tonight and it's gone!  Very easy and quick to do so will definitely be making these again.   We loved that they came out as little balls, made eating them more fun.  Next time though I'm going to double the recipe and keep the apples the same, lots of apple is great but I don't mind a little less for more fritters.  I also used icing sugar instead of granulated. When you coat them in icing sugar while still sort of hot it melts the sugar and gives it a glazed finish.  Would be nice to know how much sugar to how much cinnamon also, I guessed and it wasn't cinnamony enough.  They still disappeared fast lol.

I added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla.  The batter was so thick it was hard to get them done the middle.  They were way too dense for me.  This recipe will not be a keeper.

Fast, easy and yummy Saturday morning breakfast that's a hit with the whole family. Our Saturday tradition is waffles and I get bored with that. Looking for delicious alternatives that won't bring down the wrath of my children or partner is a challenge. These succeeded! My only change was to up the sugar in that batter - 4 tablespoons.

I made it and followed the recipe exactly. They were okay. It seemed more like a tempura batter to me. I was looking for more of a cakey type batter. This just might be my preference.

These are so easy to make.  They turned out just delicious!  The hubby asks me to make these whenever I get the fryer out.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I took the suggestions of others and added cinnamon to the batter and I also added more sugar bc I'm a sweets kinda girl! The result was better than expected. I did not have enough vegetable oil to fry them, so I used shortening ibstead.

I made these and they were amazing.  I used brown sugar doubled (it was what I had at work) and added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla.  Added great flavor.  Keep my fryolator at 350 and this was perfect.  Put fritters in one basket and put other basket over it to keep them submerged. They came out fluffy, flavorful and delicious.   Customers and staff loved them!!  Will definitely make them again.  I liked the chunky ness of the batter with the apples.

Only change I made was to cut the batch in half since there are only two of us.  It is a wonderful dessert/snack that my husband asks for over and over.

The taste is excellent.  Need to figure out how to make them flatter so that I don't have to cut them in half part way through and finishe cooking them.  They are delicious!!!

perfect fall recipe --  I think this is one of those recipes that one could make a hundred different ways -- each delicious.  You almost can't go wrong.  I split my batter into two batches -- I made peach fritters with half and apple fritters with the other half.  I fried them in a pan with oil, like pancakes but with more oil.  I sprinkled them with cinnamon and sugar while they were still piping hot so the sugary goodness stuck to them well.  They turned out great!

I really liked the texture, but the dough didn't seem sweet enough for me (just by a smidge).  The other change that I'm going to make next time is using powdered sugar for the dusting (the granulated cinnamon sugar just wasn't sticking to it well enough).  Otherwise, it was a delicious treat!

The fritters themselves were OK. I even added a little cinnamon to them to try to spice them up but they were still a little on the bland side. Biggest problem I had was that apparently using a deep fryer with a gridded basket was not taken into account. Every batch that I fried got stuck in the holes of the basket, thereby ripping the bottoms off of every fritter. Would never be able to make them  in a deep fryer again

I've made these quite a few times, using shredded apples for a less lumpy fritter - and they're always a hit! Today I substituted coconut milk for the milk and coconut oil for the oil, and they were equally delicious. Super simple recipe!

This needed some alterations for me as I found the recipe to bland for my taste.  I love an apple fritter to be on the sweeter side.  I used a whole can of apple pie filling vs regular apples, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix and instead of tossing in cinnamon and sugar I made a powder sugar, vanilla, and milk glaze and put it on top after coming out of the fryer. My husband agreed that the alterations after the first batch made it much better.

Yum, yum, yum! The only thing I had an issue with is figuring out how long to fry them.  The first I took out were raw in the middle, but at the end I had it down.

These are easy and delicious.  I'd like to know how to make them crispier.  It's fun making them with a young friend who coats them in cinnamon sugar.  These are requested time and again.

Added a dash of cinnamon to the batter and used honey in place of sugar.  These are good and very easy/quick to make.  Not 'quite' the flavor I'm looking for, but not bad. We cut the apple us to a fine dice, but still felt too "chunky"; maybe grated apples would be better. Definitely recommend 350 vs. 375 for the oil temp.

Very bland batter to start with....used a lot more sugar.  Vanilla extract helps lemon zest would be even better... used buttermilk and lots of it to thin down the batter to a good consistency

These were kind of bland and a lot of mine didn't cook all the way through. If I try them again I'll add some cinnamon and vanilla to the batter and try to thin it out with a little more milk.

This was very good - even our picky eaters loved and asked for it for Thanksgiving in place of apple pie! I made it as written except that I got distracted at one point and didn't add the ingredients in the order called for but it didn't seem to matter. Thanks!

I made these yummy fritters this morning.  My family loved them!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added about 1/2 teaspoon of both cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.   Also, be sure your oil is the proper temp.  I burnt the first one I fried, in about 20 sec.

Delicious! Used honey instead of sugar in the batter & added 1tsp vanilla. Tossed apples in the dry mix before adding the wet ingredients.

Bland, bland, bland.  After reading the reviews I decided to add some vanilla extract, cinnamon and extra sugar to the batter, but that didn't seem to help much.  The flavor is just very flat.

Doubled the batter, added vanilla and cinnamon. If it's your first time, start with one at a time to get a feel for the fryer time.  Very tasty!

Tried this today and we have a large family. I'm reading now that I am not alone in the doubling. I doubled it but only used 3 eggs, and even added a couple of dashes of ground clove & cinnamon to the batter.

These turned out really well and will become a new family favorite!

I made a half recipe- which produced about 12 fritters, slightly bigger than a golf ball. The family enjoyed them. Thanks!

Tasted more like a churro an apple churro than a fritter. I think there's potential for this recipe to be great. Dough taste was plain, maybe a glaze would help out the taste?Not sure, that I'd make it again.

First time I made it I cut the recipe in half and calculated the milk wrong!  I used 16 Tablespoons instead of teaspoons!  No wonder it was a soggy, drippy mess!  OK, I love this recipe because it's fast and easy.  Like others, I added a pinch or two (or three) of vanilla and cinnamon. Glazed them like an old fashioned donut. For the time spent, these are awesome.  No proofing and get down to frying after the only hard step, peeling and dicing apples.  It's a keeper.  You can make a better apple fritter, but not without spending hours proofing dough.

I doubled the amount of batter and grated 3 honey crisp apples with skins on.  I also chopped up about 8 pieces of bacon to add to the batter and used bacon grease instead of vegetable oil.  They were not made to be a diet snack.  I agree that 350 is the temp for the fryer.  These were outstanding.

I was pretty disappointed how these turned out after all the work I put into them. They were soggy and bland. I tasted as I fried and kept trying to make adjustments. I made a couple super tiny ones - think the size of a quarter - that turned out fairly crisp. And as I fried I added cinnamon and more sugar to the batter and those were much more flavorful. I kept checking the oil temp to ensure it was hot enough. The original recipe tastes more like a soggy apple quick bread than a fritter.

These were great fried them at about 2.5 to 3.0 minutes per side and nice and crispy.
Didn't have the cinnamon sugar so used cane sugar with 1 tsp of cinnamon powder.
To fry used a tablespoon about half full and used teaspoon to scrap off into hot oil, worked great, just don't crowd them or they will not be as crispy.
Also added just a touch of nutmeg.

These are a wonderful autumn treat. I added a little cinnamon to the batter for extra flavor. The first batch I made the mistake of making my spoonfuls too big and then not frying them for long enough, so my first few were doughy inside, but one I got the size and cook time down they were perfect. Very easy to make if you have a deep fryer.

Good and quick.  Added a pinch of nutmeg and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter.  Will make this again.

These were very good and so simple. I did add a tiny splash of vanilla as suggested and that was a good move. Next time I will add a little more flour because they were pretty wet and had a tendency to separate when dropped the hot oil and the comment replacing the batter oil with applesauce sounds interesting.

My husbands fav so I had to learn to make. They came out great as is, although we use vanilla almond milk instead. Eat them quick if you want them to stay hard, as they got soggy when I stored then in a Tupperware. But popped them in the toaster oven to warm them up and no one complained.

These were really tasty, but I must admit I couldn't get over how unhealthy they were so couldn't fully enjoy them!  Nonetheless, good recipe (but for me, not worth the calories)
