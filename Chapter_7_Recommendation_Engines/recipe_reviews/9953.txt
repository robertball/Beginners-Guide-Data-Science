I made this for a Hawaiian themed party.  I personally don't care for coconut or mac. nuts so I didn't eat any but the folks at the party really liked them.  There were only 2 or 3 squares left and the hostess of the party just had to keep them so she could have them for breakfast the next day.  The only downfalls of this recipe are the cost - mac. nuts are expensive and though it's easy to make, it's time-consuming.

SO GOOD!  The instant coffee granules give it a unique, can't-quite-put-your-finger-on-it taste.  YUMMY!  I served these at a Luau themed bridal shower and they were a hit.

I had high hopes for this dessert; what's not to like with these ingredients? Well, they were really sweet and I thought the coffee made everything else taste flat.  Sorry, but I won't be making again.

This recipe is amazing...and I am a island girl! I tweaked it just a bit. I toasted the coconut cuz I love the buttery flavor of toasted coconut. I also added one egg to the coconut macadamia mixture to tame any oversweet claims in other reviews. The second baking took about 35 minutes. Had a very faint coffee flavor and an overall buttery chewy richness that is addictive. I will be making these for my island ohana over & over. ONO! Many mahalos for sharing!

These bars are easy to make and very good but a little sweeter than I would have liked.  I made them for my sister and she just loved them.

These were great, except the instant coffee I had was WAY too strong, so much so that I had to start the butter/sugar part over, then I only put a bit in.  My husband's college class loved them.

I first tasted this yumminess at Mauigirl's Las Vegas roundup.  I made this for dessert, tonight, 5/30/16, and it is just as delicious as I remember.  I used unsweetened coconut, and that is my only tweak to this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, and I admit I had a hard time waiting long enough for these lovlies to cool.  DEE-LISH!  Thanks for posting!

Made these exactly as instructed for an Hawaiian Themed Gourmet Club. Everyone loved them. Easy to make ahead of time and easy to serve. Coffee absolutely did not overwhelm the recipe.
