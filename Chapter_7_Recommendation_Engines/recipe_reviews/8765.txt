DEEELISH, WE WILL PUT THIS ON THE FAV. LIST. I ADDED FRESH MUSHROOMS TO PAN (NOT ON TOP OF CHICKEN)BEFORE ADDING SOUP MIXTURE. I ADDED MINCED GARLIC,SALT,PEPPER,AND GRATED PARMESAN CHEESE TO SOUP MIXTURE BEFORE COVERING CHICKEN. I ALSO SERVED IT ON EGG NOODLES. THE CHICKEN WAS SO TENDER AND MOIST WE DID NOT EVEN HAVE TO DIRTY A KNIFE. BAKED FOR 35MIN AT 350 THEN 400 FOR 15MIN AS OTHERS HAD SUGGESTED

This was very good and very simple to make.  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic instead of the plain kind and I also used only half of the required sour cream (we're not a big fan of it).  Also, instead of using the bacon pieces as a wrap, I cooked them in a pan with some sliced mushrooms while the chicken was baking and then put the crumbled bacon pieces and mushrooms on top of the chicken along with shredded parmesan cheese about 10-15 minutes before the chicken was done and then finished cooking.  Served over white rice.  Very delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This had really good flavor, but I just couldn't get over the bites of bacon that were really limp, for lack of a better word. I precooked the bacon for a minute in the microwave, then wrapped around the chicken. The texture of uncrisped bacon is really unappealing to me. I loved the flavors and how moist the chicken was though. I put sliced mushrooms on the bottom of the dish, then the chicken, then covered in the sauce. Served over egg noodles. Thanks :)

This was a very good basic recipe that I think can be altered to a lot of different tastes. I made a few changes: one was to pre-cook the bacon, added a dash of Worchestershire sauce and then some Cheddar cheese the last 5 min of baking. I also put a layer of frozen peppers/onions under the chicken and used 4 chicken breasts instead of 2. The chicken was so tender!  You could easily make this with chicken gravy instead of the soup/sour cream or you could use the original recipe and add some chili powder and top with salsa for Mexican flavor. I will definitely be making this again!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I did rub brown sugar and pepper the bacon, as the other reviewer suggested, and it made all the difference.  The only thing I would do differently, is maybe fry the bacon until most of the fat is rendered, but not before it becomes crisp (let it cool, then rub brown sugar and pepper it).  I would also broil the chicken at the end for a few minutes so the bacon taste would come out more.

this is a very delicious meal! my family loved it so much! i did put brown sugar and pepper on the bacon before wrapping it on the chicken. Also, i only put 2/3 cups of sour cream and after the 40 min, 350 degrees cooking i did baked it at 400 degrees for 10 more mins as suggested in the reviews... it turned out really good! if you prefer a cripy bacon, i suggest you put the bacon-wrapped chicken, without the sauce,in the microwave for 2.5 minutes or more, depending on how crispy you want it and they serve it with the sauce.

My family LOVED this. I made it for 8 and changed it up a little bit. I used one large can of cream of mushroom soup and two 10.75 cans of cream of mushroom with garlic. We are a family who loves our garlic. This came out wonderful! Not too much garlic and not too little. I also bought 2 lbs thick bacon from the meat market and fried that up. Instead of wrapping the chicken I crumbled the bacon in with the soup mixture. I served this over mashed yukon gold and red potatoes. It was wonderful!!! Will make this many more times!!!!

This was great, and so easy too! I changed it up a little bit though. I used half a can of milk instead of the sour cream. I used chicken tenderloins that were seasoned with pepper, seasoned salt, and garlic powder; then topped with a slice of provolone cheese and wrapped with pre-cooked bacon. While it took a while for the chicken to bake, it gave you plenty of time to fix the rest of the meal. I love those 'bake 'em and walk away' recipes like this one!

This recipe was delicious.  I made honey peppered bacon by rubbing brown sugar and course ground pepper over the bacon slices before wrapping them around the chicken.  The sauce on the chicken is absolutely delicious. This is definetly a keeps in my recipe box!!

This is a similar recipe that has been around for years and is a favorite in our family.  I rate this recipe a 5 star with these changes. First, either cook the bacon almost completely done but still a little limp or use the pre-cooked new bacon on the market.  Split the chicken breast, wrap a dried beef sliver on the top and bottom of the chicken and the wrap one piece of bacon around the chicken.  The dried beef really adds to the dish.  Combine the sour cream and the soup together with about 1/4 cup of white wine, top chicken with 1/2 the mixture and bake on 425 degrees for 15 minutes and then reduce to 325 degrees for 30 to 45 minutes depending on the thickness of your chicken.  The top of the chicken should be brown.  Heat the remaining sauce on the stove and serve as the side sauce for the chicken, rice, potatoes, pasta, etc.  I also add garlic and mushrooms sometimes.  Enjoy.

This was so very yummy!! I did put the bacon strips in the micro for about 1.5 minutes before wrapping around the chicken and I added pressed garlic and RealBacon (bacon bits in a jar) to the soup mixture. I also always replace sour cream with plain yogurt, which we prefer. The wrapped bacon didn't turn out "crispy" but it was fully cooked and eat-able. My 5-yr-old even liked this. The chicken came out so tender that we didn't have to use knives either! I served this with green beans and buttered egg noodles--what a terrific (and relatively inexpensive) dinner for us! I will be making this again :o)

I've made this for years, but use cream of chicken soup mixed with the sour cream, and we cook it on 250 for three hours, everything melts in your mouth. I've turned up the temp and done it in an hour, which is just fine, but its not the same as doing it the "long" way

OMG! This recipe freakin' RULES! Made it last night and my husband (a chef by occupation) raved about it all night (doesn't happen with my cooking often). Cooked the bacon for just a few minutes in a skillet and rubbed the bacon w/ brown sugar and pepper as other reviewers suggested. Served over egg noodles. DYNAMITE!

Excellent recipe!  It has everything a cook likes...great taste and fast & easy preparation.  It's very risky to prepare a new recipe for dinner guests, but I thought it was worth a try.  After reading the reviews, I pre-cooked the bacon slightly and added a little white wine to the sauce for some French sophistication. I served it over rice and had green bean almondine as a side. The meal looked like I'd spent all day in the kitchen.  My only problem was that I had no leftovers!

4.5 stars!  Delicious. I browned the bacon-wrapped chicken in a skillet before baking it with the soup mixture, which I doubled.  Will definitely make this again.

I just made this today, and I am quite impressed.  I wasn't so sure about the cream of mushroom soup, but wow.  Yum.  This is like mushroom-and-bacon-goodness with the chicken just being the vehicle.  I did use tips from other reviewers - put pepper and onion on the chicken, and pre-cooked the bacon a bit, and actually used light sour cream.  I also put some fresh mushrooms around the chicken before pouring sauce.  Definitely serve over egg noodles.  Yum yum.

Although tender, the taste in the sauce was terrible. Tasted like straight mayonaise, despite the garlic powder and Worcestshire that I added. Will not make again.

Very good, everyone loved it! (what's not to love?!) I used boneless/skinless thighs, topped it with bacon and then I mixed up my own cream of mushroom since I don't buy it in a can. I sauteed baby bellas in butter, added flour to make a roux and then milk. I mixed that with the sour cream and topped the chicken. Baked it as directed. Very flavorful!

Delicious!! Made a few minor changes. Pounded the chicken thin and wrapped it around a piece of swiss cheese before wrapping the bacon around the chicken. Covered with the sauce and then sprinkled with onion powder, garlic powder and northwoods fire seasoning. Also followed another reviewers advice to partially cook the bacon in the microwave beforehand so it wasn't rubbery. We loved it!

Very tasty!  I made this per the instructions with one exception:  I did par-cook the bacon in the microwave before wrapping it around the chicken.  It was a hit with the whole family.  The only thing I would say is that the next time around I will use "light" ingredients all around.  This dish is pretty heavy, so you can probably go with "light" for the creamy ingredients.  Will definitely be making it again.

Not a good recipe but a good concept.  The recipe as itself is lacking...but by following the suggestions of others it made a great dinner.  I added parmesan cheese, minced garlic, onion powder to the sour cream and soup mixture.  Also added sauteed mushrooms to the top of the chicken before covering with soup mixture.  It was good but still lacking something...next time I think I will add a slice of swiss cheese wrapped around chicken before wrapping the bacon and see if that makes it better.

I made this recipe exactly as called for.  I really liked the flavor of the dish, but agreed with others that the limp bacon wasn't that appealing.  It gave it good flavor, but we ended up just taking it off when we ate.  So maybe the answer might be to pre cook bacon and crumble it in with the soup and sour cream mixture.  We served it over rice and I would definitely try this again. It was quick and easy, so you can't complain about that!

YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST COOK THE BACON BEFORE COOKING; IF YOU DO NOT COOK IT, THE RAW BACON WILL NOT BE DONE IN 45MIN & THE WHOLE DISH WILL NEED TO BE SCRAPPED BECAUSE IT SURROUNDS THE CHICKEN!!! COOKERS BEWARE!!!!

Have made this twice once as written which was good but 2nd time is was wonderful. I Used 'tropicanna' suggestions. Like how bacon was fully cooked & crunched, also sauted mushrooms in some of bacon grease till brown, it was awesome. We will be making this many more times in future! Thanks for recipe!

Bacon is just so hard to bake.  This was a good recipe but we ended up cutting off half the bacon because it wasn't crisp.  I think next time I will try proscuitto.

Sorry, but this was pretty awful; since chicken has no particular flavor itself, the sauce, etc is the key; If you just tasted this sauce by itself, you would see that it's not going to work.  Even the bacon couldn't save this one.

Love it! It's sooo simple! And you can use other cream soups instead of the mushroom one! I DO precook the bacon in the microwave too, otherwise it wouldn't be good, My husband loves it! I make sure I season the chicken with garlic powder and black pepper, NO extra salt is required because the canned soups have enough salt for the whole dish.

I will make this one again! Very tasty!  I cooked some bacon up before hand. Sauteed some onion and garlic in the same pan, mixed in sour cream/soup mixture, and baked the chicken in the mixture.  I broke the bacon up over the chicken when it was done so it was crispy, not soggy.

Good recipe... almost like my mom used to make, except she put in a layer of dried beef in the chicken.  For those who also don't like the flabbiness of bacon strips, either microwave the bacon slightly, or do what I do, and use the "pre-cooked" bacon available now... it's more expensive, but much crispier and less fat than the uncooked version.

Soo tasty! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and actually topped the chicken with cooked bacon about 10 min before taking the dish out of the oven. I like crispier bacon so that small change worked wonderfully. The sour cream/cream of mushroom soup was a fantastic sauce. I served over white rice and will def. make again!

This was probably a 3 1/2 * for me.  I did not make this exactly as written only because I didn't have COM and used cream of chicken instead along with a small can of drained, diced chiles for a little extra flare.  The chicken was tender, the sauce tasted good, and was quick to put together.  I pounded the chicken down and cut each breast into two, based on personal preference.  I had to bake longer than the recipe recommends (about 10-15 minutes) before the chicken was done.  I think the major turn off was the under cooked bacon.  I like my bacon somewhere between chewy and crispy.  I would have considered microwaving the bacon a bit prior to baking, as other reviewers mentioned, however; that reduces the bacony flavor.  Bacon usually takes about 20 minutes in the oven alone.  Next time I may try this recipe and bake the chicken and bacon about 15-20 minutes before topping with the sauce mixture.  I think the chicken would still be tender because it would be baking in the chicken and bacon juices for just a short period of time.

Very good!! A deffo keeper. I have to watch my salt so I used lower sodium bacon and cream of Mushroom Soup. Great with Egg Noodles as other users have suggested. My nephew's favorite when he comes home from West Point.

Oh my goodness, I can not express how good this was and easy! 4 total ingredients! It was very flavorful and juicy. I just seasoned it with a little salt (remember the bacon will add some salt flavor also so be careful, fresh ground pepper, and a little bit of thyme leaves. I served it with some wild rice, green beans, and biscuits. Excellent dish will make again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

Finally an answer to my leftover sour cream! This is super tasty! I did change a few things though. I cooked the bacon in a skillet and crumbled it on top instead of wrapping the chicken in it. I also sauteed some mushrooms and spinach in the bacon drippings and put that on top of some rice and then put the chicken on top of that and poured sauce over the whole thing. Oh, and I added some minced garlic to the sauce before cooking. Yum Yum Yum. Super, super easy. I am not a great cook and even I can do it ;) Hubby and 3 year old son loved it, too. Would do 5 stars, but I think the original recipe might be a little bland and I imagine the bacon would be chewy.

Me and my husband made this tonight, and with him being a professional chef, we can never make any recipe without adding our own touches, and this time was no different. WWe took two large chicken breasts and sliced two pockets in the side of each one, and stuffed them with fresh Mozzarella, asparagus tips, and sweet julienned red pepper. We then wrapped them with the bacon and secured them with two wooden toothpicks per breast, and placed them in a pre-greased (with Pam) Pyrex dish. (You can use cooking twine, as well if you choose.) I then mixed the soup and sour cream mixture as directed in the recipe, adding granulated onion, garlic, pepper, and thickly sliced Avina mushrooms before we spread it over the stuffed breasts.  (Tip: Tillamook sour cream lends itself to create a thicker and more luxurious sauce than standard sour cream!) I squeezed a tablespoon or so of lemon juice over the top and popped that sucker in the oven! About ten minutes before it was due out of the oven, I took it out and topped it with shredded cheddar, chopped green onions, and diced fresh tomatos. SO GOOD. This recipe is a fantastic base and can be tweaked various ways to make very different and tasty versions.

Delicious recipe, especially the sauce!  I took some of the posters' advice and added the garlic mushroom soup instead of the plain soup, then I added diced cremini mushrooms to the dish.  It was fantastic, and I don't believe I've ever eatten chicken more tender than the chicken from this recipe!  But next time I think I may cook the bacon normally and crumble it on top as opposed to cooking it around the chicken so it ends up being crunchy instead of flimsy and chewy.

If you like bacon, and who doesn’t, you will love this dish.  I followed other reviewers’ suggestions and pre-cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken breast because we love our bacon crisp.    The sauce is wonderful and went perfectly with the brown jasmine rice I had made.  Just for a little jazz, I topped the breasts with crumpled bacon.

Good!  Make sure if you like your bacon cooked, to cook it!  I added onions and peppers to the bottom, also used less sour cream.  Added alittle mozzerella to the top, along with some bacon toppings.

This recipe was excellent and very easy to make.  I added canned mushrooms to the soup mixture and didn't have enough chicken, so I also used pork chops wrapped in bacon.  The chicken definitely tasted better, but both were good.  Will definitely make again.

This is exactly like a recipe my Mamaw used to always make, she passed awya this year and I never got the recipe from her.  So glad I cam across this, made it last night and is just as good as I remember.  I made it just as the recipe says but I do put a little seasoning on the chicken before putting the sauce over it.

We had this dish for dinner tonight.  At the end of a day at work this was a breeze to put together.  Once it was in the oven I could relax.  I made some slight changes based on reviews:  cooked bacon first, cut into small pieces and mixed with the soup mixture.  Sauteed a few mushrooms and topped the dish with them towards the end of the cooking time.  I decreased the sour cream by half.  Made some of these changes for ease and to cut back on fat.  Went over well and was very easy.  Might be a good dish with meatballs made with ground chicken or turkey.  Will make this one again.

I subsituted the bacon with turkey bacon and used plain fat free yogurt instead of the sour cream. This makes the chicken sweeter and juicer, and not as heavy. I love this recipe and so does my 15 year old picky eater sister!

Very easy and delicious! I layered the bacon one slice on top and one on the bottom and secured with toothpicks to the soup and sour cream mix I added 1 clove minced garlic, parm. cheese and white pepper. Served over egg noodles with cheese bread.

This was a good recipe. Used what I had avail as substitution (cream of onion, chicken breast tenders). Will be better with cream of chicken or mushroom instead. I had to cook mine a bit longer by about 10 mins.. The chicken wasn't done enough. Very good. I made noodles, was hoping for extra sauce, but there isn't much extra, so don't count on that. Hubby liked it and it was easy. Not too strong of a sour cream taste either.

I added a couple of ingredients and modified it, and it was delicious. I cooked the chicken in the oven with the soup and sour cream mix. In a skillet, I cooked a little butter, yellow onion, bacon pieces, and fresh mushrooms, which I topped the chicken with. We love freh mushrooms, so they were a must, and cooking the bacon this way got it crispy. Yum!

This was a very easy recipe. I prepared the chicken in a glass dish and refrigerated it a few hours before my family came home, just to save time. I ended up leaving the chicken in the oven for an hour and 10 minutes instead of 50 and the bacon turned out really well.

The sour cream in this recipe proved to be too dominant a taste. The bacon did not get crispy.

It was average tasting (not a gourmet recipe!)  Ont the positive side, it was very very easy and required just a few ingredients... always a plus for small families.  And it's fairly low fat, which is a good thing.  You may want to add a sprinkle of ground pepper for an added kick.

after reading some of the reviews, I made some changes. I sprinkled the chicken (I used 5 tenders) with garlic powder first. I pre-cooked the bacon part-way in the microwave, then liberally added brown sugar and black pepper, wrapping one slice of bacon around each tender. Covered with the sauce, baked 35 minutes at 350, then another 15 minutes at 400. My husband and I both liked it, but I got tired of the taste. It's also more of a cold-weather comfort food, so I think I'll try it in the fall, and maybe in the crockpot as well.

My husband and I do not like cream of mushroom soup, so I subbed in cream of chicken and lite sour cream.  Served with rice=yum.  My husband thought the bacon squishy and gross so if that kind of texture bothers you, maybe cook the bacon separately and crumble on top (or something).

I double the recipe and then realized I didn't have two cans of mushroom soup. So I used a can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom. I didn't double the sour cream. Used a little over half of a 16oz container. I put mushrooms on the bottom of my pan and then the wrapped chicken on top. I did like others and cooked my bacon a little before wrapping. Was excellent. I also added a little garlic and onion powder. Will make again.

this was good and very easy to prepare. i also added sliced mushrooms to the bottom of the dish before chicken. like i said this was really good but there wasn't anything "wow" about it that i was hoping for. I will have to experiment with this one a little.

We LOVED this, I changed a couple things per other reviews; I cooked it at 350 for 40min, then at 400 for 10min. Slathered the bacon with brown sugar and black pepper, then wrapped the chicken breast and put it in the microwave for 3min each breast to help crisp up the bacon. Served with white rice and poured some extra sauce over the rice when serving. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

This is absolutely delicious!!   The only thing I did different was seasoned the chicken very well and added a little bit of cheese and served it over rice.  Everyone (even by picky 8 and 1 year old kids) ate it and asked for more!

This was one of the easiest and the best recipes I have ever tried.  I did take a few suggestions from the other reviews, cut up green pepper and onion and placed in the bottom of the dish before the chicken.  I had some problems with the bacon, and will tweak that a little on the next try.  The bacon was not close to being done after and hour of baking, and where the bacon was wrapped around the chicken, in those places the chicken was not done, I had to take the bacon off completely and finish baking.  I think crumbled bacon would work better!  Great recipe tho!

This was a great recipe, however, I definitely think you should pre-cook your bacon, or cook it up and crumble it into the sauce mixture. The bacon didn't really cook in the oven and was too soft and tasteless. I added green onion, lots of garlic, salt, pepper, and about 2 cups of parmesan cheese to the recipe. YUMMY!

My husband and I just loved this, and so simple ! I changed it adding 8 oz cream cheese, 8oz of sour cream, 1/2 can of corn and some leftover mozarella and parmesan cheese. I added one pouch of the always delicious Patrick Cudahy bacon bits (apple smoked yum) and it was most delicious. The chicken was so moist and it made for some wonderful left overs !

This came as a recipe of the day, and I emailed it to hubby, who made it and loved it for being so easy.  We found we loved the sauce so much we wanted to make it with increasing the sauce ingredients, but then the bacon doesn't cook quite as well. If you precook the bacon the flavour's not the same.  So I say the original recipe is the best.

This recipe is yummy. I don't usually have alot of time so this fits my schedule perfect. I doubled it fine. I even subsituted some ranch dressing for sour cream. I used chicken tenders by wrapping two together at a time. Get ready for a filling, hearty meal that everyone will love.

Ok i made this last night wanted to try something different, i followed the directions and it was not that bad i thought it was good Hubby said it was ok, this is what i would different if i make and i will make again i would stuff the chicken with stuffing then wrap with bacon and then pour over the sauce and when i take out of the oven i sprinkle with grated cheese and just to add color to the sauce i would add chopped onions bell peppers if i don't add the stuffing and chopped potatos. Over than that i give a 4. Very good and delicous on a cold day.

This was delicious! I will definitely make this again! i think it would also be good with pork chops and/ or turkey bacon. Cream of chicken would be good as well. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good, loved the sauce! I used turkey bacon, fat free sour cream, and 98% fat free soup to make it healthier.

Without a doubt the best chicken recipe I have ever made. I couldn't believe something so simple could be so good.  The whole family loved it.  My husband said it was the best chicken I have ever made.

The best, but I fry my bacon first then wrap the chicken with the bacon. I put the wrapped chicken in the skillet with the hot bacon grease. Then pour the sauce over the chicken. This way it has a lot of bacon taste we're bacon nuts. I also used cream of chicken soup. GREAT RECIPE! TY!

This was o.k.  I definitely should have friend the bacon first as some suggested.  The limp pieces of bacon were pretty unappealing.  The taste was good, but it does need changes.

This was just okay.  Had a decent flavor after I added some onion salt and garlic salt, but won't be on my favorites list by any means.

I used individually frozen skinless chicken breasts, wrapped them in bacon, baked them for about 10 minutes while I mixed the other ingredients, poured the soup mixture over the chicken and baked for the rest of the time. It was easy and delicious!! Thanks for the recipe

Based on some other reviews, I added some fresh mushrooms to the pan before adding soup mixture.  In the soup mixture I added minced garlic, salt, pepper, and grated parmesean cheese.  This recipe makes a lot of sauce so serve chicken over rice or pasta.  This was a good recipe, will make again.

It was very easy and good. The soggy bacon is an issue, however, I would not take the bacon out of the recipe due to the tremendous flavor. Next time, I think I will add garlic and mushrooms. I will try it over noodles as well. Thanks.

Delicious! Used some reviewers' ideas such as plain yogurt instead of sour cream and browning chicken and slightly cooking bacon first (did together). Sauce was very good and lots of it. I used a couple of chicken thighs and cooked for one hour. This recipe is definitely one I'll use frequently.

Great flavor.  To reduce fat content I precooked and crumbled bacon on top of each breast and then stirred a few more bacon bits in the sauce before serving.

Definately a keeper!  My family loved it.  I would suggest that you either pound the chicken breast to make them thinner or split them.  Some fresh grilled mushrooms were a nice addition.

Husband went crazy over the sauce.  Only change I made was I pre-cooked the bacon to about 75% doneness before I baked the dish so I would be sure to have fully cooked bacon in the dish.

It was AWESOME. I cooked it for my best firend and family and she raved. I did make a few changes. I cut the sour cream in half added garlic, pepper, milk, and parm cheese. Then for the last 10 min I added sauted mushrooms and garlic on top. I will make this again.

I added a dash of pepper.  Next time I think I will add a couple of other spices, fresh mushroom, and maybe crisp the bacon separately.

This was sooooooooo delicious. I actually changed a few things though. I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, and I substituted honey mustard for the sour cream. I also sauteed mushrooms and put them over the top like someone else suggested. It was so good!!!!!

This was an easy recipe to make and turned out delicious. I did make a number of changes as I like more spices. First of all I split the breasts and stuffed with bacon and Swiss cheese. I then added poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, worechestershire sauce, chicken stock, onion, garlic, canned mushrooms and cream of chicken soup. I baked this for two (2) hours and served over rice. It will be a favorite of ours.

Very good. My husband liked it. My kids liked it. That is a rare combination. I cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken. It gave the chicken a delicious flavor. It is simple but delicious. I wouldn't change a thing.

Sooo good! I added a couple of things. I sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder before wrapping the bacon around the breasts. Once it was finished cooking, I placed each breast on a plate and topped the chicken with a slice of swiss cheese. I zapped it in the microwave for 30 seconds, just long enough to melt the cheese. My family really enjoyed this tonight! I will keep this in the rotation. Thank you!

Made this for the first time and even the picky kids ate it up. Followed Angi's advice in her post below, and it came out great! The only thing I did differently (besides the variations Angi suggested) is use Cambell's Cream of Chicken AND Mushroom soup which boosted the flavor of the sauce even more. Thanks for the recipe and all the tips!

I made this recipe for Sunday dinner.  I found that the bacon didn't crisp up and eating the fat off the bacon wasn't appealing.  Need to figure out how to crisp up the bacon.  I think I would make it wrapped with ham a lean bacon might be better.  It is easy and something I would make again. I also added garlic to the recipe. I think using a brand name soup, which I did,  makes a difference in the flavor of sauce. I made ahead and had in the refrig overnight to bake the next day,  so that was a plus.

I skipped the sour cream altogether and used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. It was okay but the bacon didn't get done enough. Next time I'll cook the bacon separately.

Very easy & quick to prepare; I used chicken cutlets layered over & under with apple-smoked bacon.  I also added white wine & parmesan cheese to the sauce.  It was delicious!

Super simple.  I like my bacon crispy, so rather than wrapping the breasts, I crumbled bacon on top the finished recipe along with sauted mushrooms.  Also, added white wine as others had suggested.  Turned out very well.  Thanks for a simple, yet delicious recipe.

Lots of sauce...even after adding more chicken because of reviews.  I did precook bacon so it would be done and added garlic cloves.  It was good...I think we will make again, but reduce the sour cream and soup a bit.  Thanks for the post.

I give this 5 stars because of the base idea to work with.  I use precooked bacon that I bake to make crunchy and crumble that up and mix into the sour cream/soup base.  I also add cooking white wine, real garlic, mustard, Old Bay Spice, and any real non-processed cheese I have on hand like old chedder/parmesan/asiago.  I mix until smooth then pour over chicken.  I then finish with a sprinkle over top of Old Bay Spice and a bit of cheese!

I was out of cream of mushroom soup so used cream of chicken.  It looked like way too much sauce.  I think it would have been better for 4 chicken breasts instead of only 2.  Followed other suggestions to turn on the broiler for the last several minutes.  Very easy and wonderfully tasty.  Good, moist chicken ~ yum!

I loved this recipe.  I added cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I also cooked it about 20 minutes longer until the bacon was crisp on the top.  It is delicious and easy.

I made this for my husband and very picky teen daughter and they loved it!  My daughter even requested that I make this for her special birthday dinner in 6 weeks.  The flavors combined beautifully, although I did up the temp to 400 for the last 10 minutes to crisp the bacon a tad.  This one is definitely a keeper for us.

Super easy and good.  I used reduced fat soup - turkey bacon and low fat sour cream.  Excellent.  My family loved it.

Ever have one of those days? 

One of those days - no matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to read the recipe accurately or you don't read the labels on what you think are the ingredients...

My smothered chicken was made with 98 percent fat free Cream of CHICKEN soup, low fat sour cream and four slices of bacon. 

I also followed a few of the recommendations - I rubbed the super thick slices of bacon with brown sugar and course ground pepper. I baked it on parchment paper in the oven for 15 minutes at 400 degrees. Flipping the bacon over after seven minutes.

I also thought I'd add a half a packet of ranch salad dressing mix to the sour cream and soup mixture. INSTEAD, I added a half a packet of SPICY ranch salad dressing mix.

I also added caramelized Vidalia onions (sweet onion slices added to about a tablespoon of melted butter - sautéed for about 10 minutes).

Lastly, the baking directions - cooked the dish at 350 for 35 minutes and then when I turned up the heat to 400 for the last 15 minutes, I topped the dish with parmesan and Romano cheeses - you know - goofs always taste better when covered in cheese.

I honestly thought my husband was not only going to lick his plate, but the serving dish as well. 

I keep a listing of dinner choices in our phones so we both can pick and choose our meals - he made me add this immediately.

Served with fresh corn and watermelon, dinner was AWESOME!!!

It is the sour cream that provides that extra tang to the dish.  It is always a hit when I serve it.  It is my go to impressive dish for dinner parties.  I sometimes leave the bacon off a few pieces of chicken for my guest that are not eating meat.  Also I use chicken tenderloins.  It stretches the meat further, cost less and a can portion it better.

My mother gave me this recipe back in the 70's- We add 1/2 cup of cooking sherry, salt and pepper to taste.  We line the bottom of the dish with very thinly sliced pastrami and top it with fresh sliced mushrooms.  This is a great company dish you can make in no time and put together ahead of time and then just pop in the oven.

Kids all loved this. I changed it slightly  to pre-cook garlic with the bacon (keeping it soft at this stage). Added just a 1/2tsp of Boursin cheese ontop of each chicken breast. Used double cream with condensed chicken soup. When I put the the sauce on, I left the bacon exposed to crisp up to crunchy.

It was delicious and a real hit with my 12 year old.

I made this two ways and found that the second variation (using thigh meat rather than breast meat) made for a infinitely superior and much more flavorful dish.
I made no other changes...and I must say that the combination of the sour cream and the mushroom soup was quite amazing and luscious.  
Next time I make this, I'm going to try adding a touch of Hungarian Noble Rose paprika to the sauce.  I may also follow angi's suggestion of adding a bit of fresh garlic.

Awesome recipe. The picture doesn't do it any justice, though. Took some ideas from above and added some minced garlic and Parmesan cheese to soup mixture before covering the chicken. Something else I did was crumble townhouse crackers and sprinkled them on top. Chicken turned out great. Super moist and very flavorful. This recipe is great on its own or served over top of rice or pasta.

This was excellent. I didn't change a thing. I only made three chicken breast for three people and they were upset with me that I didn't make more for second helpings. I live in Texas so a meal is not a meal without mashed potatoes. I made twice baked potatoes and smothered them with the gravy that the sour cream and cream of mushroom mix made. It was to die for. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe.

My family loved this and it was quick and easy.  I cooked the bacon in a enameled cast iron pot, then turned off the heat drained the grease and added the chicken.  There was just enough heat left to bown the chicken a little.  I put the cooked bacon on top and covered with the sauce.  I used cream of chicken, since my family likes that better and added some finely chopped onions and garlic.  I cooked it the 35min @ 350 and 15min. @ 400.  The last 5 minutes I sprincled a little parmasan on top.  Turned out very yummy!

It definitely was a good idea to cook the bacon ahead of time before putting the dish into the oven. But overall a very flavorful, yummy dish that I will definitely cook again.

We were surprised at how bland this dish was. Looking at the ingredients you would think that it would be pretty flavorful and creamy. Not one I will make again.

This is a lot like a recipe I use, except I add a couple of soup cans of water to the original recipe, then when it is done, I remove the chicken and add a package of brown gravy mix.  Add the chicken back to the gravy mixture and cook a little longer.  It is wonderful.

This was sooooo yummy!  Next time though, I will probably wrap the chicken in bacon and fry it up a little bit before I bake it.  It was still very good, however, the bacon needed to be a little bit more crisp.

This was absolutely awesome! My husband isn't fond of white meat but thought it was really good.  I followed the recipe but also added some of the other reviewers ingredients.  One thing I will do next time is cut back on the sauce so that the chicken isn't covered and the bacon can become more crisp.  I served the sauce over egg noodles.  Thanks for an awesome meal.

Glad I read the reviews. I added fresh mushrooms as one reviewer suggested and served over whole wheat egg noodles also suggested. I forgot to add the sour cream but the mushrooms gave off enough liquid to make a nice sauce. The sour cream would have probably helped with the saltyness of the dish. I used turkey bacon and my husband and I both thought this tasted like chicken corte en blue.

This was totally delicious my sister scrapped the plate lol. I made some variations, I took advice from other reviewers. I used half and half cream instead of sour cream,I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, I seasoned the chicken first before wrapping them with bacon and put it in the oven to brown for 20 minutes and then put the soup mixture over it. I cut up onion, tomatoe, green onion and minced garlic also some pre-shredded marble  cheese and mixed it in the soup with some cayenne pepper and black pepper. I baked it till the bacon and the mixture was brown then turned it over on the other side to make that brown. It took about two hours. But well worth the wait.

I followed a lot of others advice and regretfully cooked the bacon dipped into brown sugar, which sweeten the dish way too much. It just did not go very well. I did like the garlic, onion and parmesan though. If i was to make this again i would DEFINETLY avoid brown sugar!

This dish was delicious.....made a few changes. I cut the chicken into cubes and sliced the bacon into 1" squares. I crisped the bacon a bit in a frying pan and browned the chicken in same pan before transferring to baking dish. I used 1 can each creams of mushroom/chicken and added 1 can green beans. I topped with Stove Top stuffing (followed package directions first)and sprinkled with cheddar cheese. Baked for 25 minutes covered, then another 5 minutes uncovered. Everyone had seconds and leftovers!

These were fabulous!!! My small boys (22 months and 3yrs) loved them too. I only made a couple small changes by browning the meat w/ garlic salt and pepper and adding onions. I just layed the bacon on top and broiled them the last few minutes to get the bacon crisp.  These were Soooooo tender and delicious. The sauce was tasty over rice too.

Delicious! Used the plain yogurt instead of sour cream - all I had on hand. Didn't have any soup either !! used a couple of spoonfulls of a powdered base for 'apricot and chicken casserole' so the liquid came only from the yoghurt. Used a slice of dark rye bread underneath the chicken to soak up the wonderful juice, served with green beans.  My husband is on his second helping already.  Highly recommended.

This was very easy.  I also browned the chicken as some suggested, but I found the sauce bland so I added a packet of onion soup mix to zip it up.  My recipe had been conformed for 5 servings, so if you're servings are less use only 1/2 a packet of soup.  It was delicious and my husband loved it.

Used light sour cream, reduced fat soup and thick bacon which was on hand. Husband loved this recipe. Microwaved the bacon slices one minute (1 slice for each chicken piece) before cooking, not quite enough time as I needed to zap it a bit at the end also. With regular bacon I think that would work okay though and that's probably what I will do again. Great flavor.

I made this because the other reviews were so great. I don't get it! It was not good! My husband really didn't like it! Neither did I! The bacon was chewy the chicken flavorless and the sauce watery. Terrible!

My husband loved this dish.  I served it over rice and with corn.  I liked it also, I was just a little afraid that my chicken wasn't going to get done.  and i got a little too much cream sauce.

This will be a staple in my household. I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom, I mixed 1 can with water and left the other can creamy for a thicker texture. I cooked the bacon (1 slice per breast) and crumbled it and put it in the mushroom soup, along with 2 tbsp of parmesan cheese. I seasoned my chicken with garlic pepper and cooked for 20 minutes before adding the mushroom soup. I cooked it for about 45 minutes, and it was fabulous! I served over rice with biscuits.

I make this dish but I precook the bacon before wrapping the chicken breasts. I also put a couple of slices of dried beef in the center of the chicken breast....roll it up and then wrap the bacon around it. I add pepper to the com soup and sour cream mixture...pour over the chicken and then bake. We like the extra sauce it makes we just pour that over the rice I serve with it.

This is great for when you're low on time and groceries, but the recipe needs some serious tweaking imo. If you follow the recipe as written, you're going to end up with pale flabby unappetizing-looking bacon, and wayyy too much mushroom soup sauce. I microwaved my bacon for a couple of minutes before wrapping it round the chicken, but it still looked kinda gross when it was cooking. I scraped the soup mix off so that the bacon could crisp up a little. It turned out ok but not fantastic. Also, 8oz of sour cream with a can of CoMush? Really? I used less than half that, plus a little splash of milk. It was still a bit too thick, but definitely edible. Husband liked it, but it actually turned out to be quite a lot of trouble.

We love this recipe. I add fresh mushrooms to the dish around the chicken. I also add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese to the soup mixture. To bring out more flavor I lightly salt the chicken breasts with Kosher salt before wrapping them with partially  cooked bacon. I normally serve over egg noodles.

I omitted the soup and instead used light sour cream flavored with garlic, parsley, salt and pepper. It was super moist!

Loved this recipe. I used 4 oz. of sour cream like everyone said and I thought it was perfect. I also substituted the 10oz of soup for half cream of chicken and half cream of mushroom, and I added a little bit of grated parmesan to the soup. If you don't cook the bacon around the chicken, the sauce won't have the bacon flavor in it. I thought it made a lot of extra sauce, so I would serve this with noodles or rice. Very quick and simple!

This was good because it was very quick to throw together and most of these things are already in the pantry. My husband and son loved it, I thought something was missing. Will keep and make again, I added mushrooms like others suggested and my bacon was pre-cooked.

This was ok. Nothing to rave about. I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be bland. I gave it 3 stars because it was very easy to make. I will not make again. My family did not like it.

Good recipe! The bacon really adds a lot! I used cream of chicken soup and cut the amount of sour cream down to 4-5 oz based on previous reviews. I also used 4 chicken breasts and 8 slices of bacon. Served over rice, this was very good! This is a definite keeper!

It was a pretty tasty dish.  But just a little too much sour cream for my tastes.

This was very tasty for as simple as it was.  I took the advice of others and rubbed the bacon w/ brown sugar after I precooked it.  I also added cooking wine and bits of bacon plus a little bacon grease and garlic powder to the sauce and served over noodles.

My kids loved this recipe!  I made this using four chicken breasts, but I still only used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup sour cream.  I did add white wine to that sauce before I poured over the chicken.  I will definately make this again!

SO tasty. Although the bacon does not get crunchy, it offers a great flavor that if you precook it, i would think some of the flavor goes away in the skillet. We just peeled off the bacon before eating and put over rice. The sauce is so wonderful. Also, I used half a can of cream of mushroom and half a can of cream of chicken in addition to the sour cream. Can't wait to make again.

Very easy and very delicious!  The extra sauce made the chicken so tender.  I would definitely increase the amount of chicken breasts as I felt I wasted a lot of sauce.  A keeper per my husband.

Great recipe!  We're always looking for new ways to make chicken, and this one made the recipe box.  The bacon makes the chicken moist and give a great flavor.  The sauce is great over rice, too.  Thanks for sharing!!

I found the chicken to be bland, and could have been seasoned more.  I put it over brown rice and the sauce was very good with that.  I also recommend cooking the bacon first.

This was very good. I cut each half breast in half and found it allowed the flavor to get through the chicken. I served it with white rice and the whole family loved it.
