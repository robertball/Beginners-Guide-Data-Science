Great recipe. I did have to change the buttermilk, though, I used 1 cup sour cream an1 cup milk  (allowed it to sit for about 15 minutes and then added my chicken pieces to it). Also, I used a smoked paprika and 1 Tbsp garlic powder (both because of my family's personal preference. Results they were gone as fast as I brought them out of Air Fryer. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

I like the coating texture, although it lacks flavor.  Maybe this should be chalked up to me being an air fryer newbie, or possibly it varies by air fryer brand, but my results were these should have been cooked longer than two minutes once flipped.

Five stars. These came out perfectly! I used gluten free ingredients. My kids devoured them. Thank you for the recipe. Itâ€™s a winner!
