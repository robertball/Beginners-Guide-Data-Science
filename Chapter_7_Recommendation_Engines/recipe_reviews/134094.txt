This is an interesting and different recipe for squash.  I used a butternut squash, as that was what I had on hand.   Butternut is sweet and easy to peel so it worked well.  I found this very easy to prepare using my food processor to shred the squash and onion.  Also, I didn't drain it as I wanted the extra flavor from the juice of the shreded onion.  I just added a little more flour to make a nice consistency then cooked it like potato pancakes.  They were a nice side dish.  I'd make them again.  Thanks Mottsbela.

this was a pretty good vegetarian filler for tacos ... i might try some different spices next time for more flavour, but it's a good start. i'll probably make it again. thanks!

This was delicious but very tedious to make. The squash was difficult to peel and chop raw (I don't have expensive knives and only a basic food processor). I would recommend baking or microwaving the squash for a bit before attempting to chop it. It was doable but not worth all the effort.

This is quite delicious, but make your life easier and use zucchini to make this dish. You don't have to peal it, just wash it well, dry it off and grate it on a hand held grater (or food processor if you must). If you don't like cumin, then try other herbs that you do enjoy. For instance, squash is one of those veggies that lends itself to Italian herbs, like basil and oregano, quite well.
