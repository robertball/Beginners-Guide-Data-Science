Overall, we enjoyed this salad! In the future, I think I would remove some of the duck meat from the bones and toss it with the salad instead of just serving whole leg/thigh. I also thought it could go with either grapes or apples, and not both; but my husband disagreed and enjoyed it as-is. I think a tart apple would work better here (I used a sweet Gala this time). So, the take-away here is that it's customizable to your own tastes, and that the flavors here really work well together! I also really like the vinaigrette and would use that in more salads too! (I substituted the called for salad mix with a spring-green and spinach mix, and red grapes for purple grapes. Kept everything else the same!) Thank you for the recipe!
