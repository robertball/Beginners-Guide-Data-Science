Not very good at all.  I almost served this to guests, but I tried a piece myself. I ended up tossing the sauce & just rubbing a little garlic & lemon w/ parsley on the bread instead. Will by no means try again.

This isn't bad.  It's kind of like a stovetop bruschetta, actually.  Mine never really thickened so I just used a slotted spoon to scoop it out, and I used a regular loaf of bread since I didn't have ciabatta or french loaves.  It's not really bland but it's not really sharp or flavorful either; I think I prefer regular bruschetta, but I think that's personal preference.  It was good with pasta and salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

If you like your bread a little softer then bricks barely toast the ciabatta, but the garlic tomatoe dressing is increadible!

My kids loved this bread. We did cook it on slices of wheat bread instead of ciabatta, though. Next Time I try it, I'll add cheese on the top!!!

This was DELICIOUS with some alterations:  garden fresh tomatoes, no brown sugar, and added slices of mozarella on the hot bread under the tomato topping. To die for yummy!! Store tomatoes have zero flavor so if you must use them, salt the heck outta them. I didnâ€™t have fresh lemon or garlic so I used 1/2 t garlic powder and 1 T lemon juice.
