Not a bad recipe but what's the point of adding an expensive jar of sauce when you are going to all this trouble and making a homemade sauce?  The coffee added a bitter burnt taste to what was a too-greasy meat sauce. All the oil just adds more grease to the fat from the ground beef that isn't drained out.  It was a high school cafeteria meat sauce. It has OK flavor but the pool of red grease on top made it something I wouldn't make again exactly as the recipe directs. The almost 1/3 cup of added oil is way over the top and you should definitely drain out the fat from the ground beef. The secret ingredient coffee flavor could be done a little better by saut√©ing the tomato paste in ONE Tablespoon of the olive oil at the beginning of the recipe and then adding the cooked and DRAINED beef and omitting the coffee and the additional 1/4 cup (4 TBS) of olive oil called for in the original version.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It was extremely bland. All I could taste was the beef, tomato sauce, peppers and a hint of coffee.   I followed the recipe and procedure exactly as written.
