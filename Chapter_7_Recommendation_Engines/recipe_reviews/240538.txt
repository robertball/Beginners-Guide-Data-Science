Simple and delicious! I did use a heart mold to make these for Valentine's day, but if I were to roll these into balls and dip them, I would def either refrigerate or even freeze them until they are firm enough to dip b/c as is, the mixture is VERY soft, so I think they would be be hard to dip unless they were firmed up first. I did some with white chocolate and some with milk chocolate, and both are a hit! I would make these again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Would definitely freeze these before dipping.  Used an entire 11 ounce bag of white chips and then had to thin with a bit of milk near the end.  Hope they taste better than they look.  Not sure they are worth the bother.

The recipe was fine but they got mushy quickly and ended up looking lumpy and lopsided after I coated them in chocolate. I will probably give it another try for Valentines Day and might freeze them for an hour before trying to coat in chocolate.

So awesome! If your chocolate is sticking add some cream or milk and mix until smooth :)
