This was very good. I used apple cider vinegar and omitted the tarragon since I despise it. Instead of the tarragon I added some celery seed and chives. Quick and easy!!

This is an excellent recipe for the winter.  And, it does stay crisp in the fridge for several days!  I have made it 4 times now with rice vinegar, but have added chopped carrots, red onion, celery, red pepper, and cucumbers (seeds removed.)

Rarely try recipes this simple, but had extra fresh tarragon and green cabbage on hand. This very simple slaw is pretty good, but wouldn't think of excluding the garlic salt. Used 1 t. fresh chopped tarragon; didn't find it overpowering. Would consider adding shredded carrot and crushed red pepper flakes next time.

It's hard to get my family to eat healthy and this is a healthy alternative to Cole Slaw. I had some cabbage and I needed a way to get them to eat it...it worked. I substituted tarragon because I didn't have it I put basil but you can use other things. I also used carrots and purple onions I think you could do a lot of your own ideas...just skip the mayo. EAT HEALTHY

I've been making this for the past several years and my sister-in-law now makes it too; all of our kids love it. So simple and very good. Love tarragon too which is so rarely used. Glad to have found this!
