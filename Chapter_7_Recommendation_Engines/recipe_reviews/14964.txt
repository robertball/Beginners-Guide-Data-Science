I, too, had the same problem as the first reviewer. In any case, this bread is very tasty. If you like a french bread style, simply remove it from the bread machine after the second rise (it really won't rise that much) and place it in a french bread pan to bake. If you prefer a hearty textured high rise bread, simply add 2T oil (I used garlic flavored olive oil), 1T sugar, 2T gluten and you have a perfectly textured hearty high rise bread. Oh, I also added 5T Parmesan cheese and 1t garlic powder on the second try. This made it oh so flavorful. Thanks Kevin!

I tried this recipe twice and could not get the bread to rise.  It sounded so good.  What a bummer!

This bread sounded so gooood. I just had to try it in spite of the low rating. I did as reviewer MaggieMcGuire suggested and the loaf came out simply scrumdidlyumptious. My roommate loved it too. Maybe Kevin can make some changes in the instructions for everyone. Then everyone can give this the rating it deserves.

I, too, had trouble getting this recipe to rise.  Here's what I finally did:  double the amount of yeast and replace the wheat bran with an equal amount of vital wheat gluten.  No need to use boiling water on the tomatoes--just snip them as they come out of the package.  I replaced the quinoa (what the heck is quinoa??) with 7-grain cereal.  I also added about 1/4C honey--yeast does better with a bit of sugar in a recipe.  Be sure to add enough flour so that the dough is not really sticky--the honey will increase the liquid content of the recipe, so you will need more flour to balance that off.   I added chopped nuts in my bread machine's extra cycle, and used a variety of herbs, including dried roasted garlic. It came out yummy and rose beautifully!

I followed the advice of pervious reviewers and used 2T gluten, 1T sugar, and 1t garlic powder and this bread actually came out pretty good. It turns a very pretty orange color from the tomatoes, and the bits of basil and quinoa give it a very unique and pretty look, too. I don't suggest leaving the quinoa out; it gives it a nice look and texture, and you can find it in the organic section of your market shelved with other grains. I made this by hand and made 16 dinner rolls that I baked on my pizza stone at 375 for 25 minutes. I brushed the tops of them with some egg white and they had a great brown crust on top when they were done. I'll be sure to make these again, maybe with the addition of some jalapenos or some red pepper.

No attention was paid to detail of the ingredients when written.  This bread needs some oil and sweetner, neither of which was included in the recipe.  The yeast needs sugar or other sweetner such as honey to work properly.  Sun-dried tomatoes in oil would be better, just drain the tomatoes and add 1 Tablespoon of the drained oil to the bread.  The oil from the tomatoes would give the bread extra flavor.  I give this a two thumbs down!

This recipe worked for me because I tinkered with it.  I prepped and baked it manually.  I dissolved the yeast with 2 tbsp of sugar, then added 2 tbsp of olive oil to that, then added all the dry ingredients and extras.  I also added 4 or 5 cloves of garlic.  I added gluten by substituting a cup of whole wheat flour for a cup of bread flour.  It's a little heavier than I usually like, but it's awesome bread.  It smelled amazing in the oven.

I followed Maggie McGuires suggestions.  Three  things I have learned in baking bread, whether in the bread machine or by hand, is to use Rapid Rise Yeast and to proof it in 1/4 cup of the liquid called for in the recipe at the temperature of 120 degrees and no higher than 130 degrees and use flour designed for bread making.  Use a thermometer.  When using wheat products in the recipe or heavier grains such as oats I use gluten.  A lot of people are allergic to these products but if you are not then use them.  I rarely have a problem.  I store my bread in the refrig. because we don't eat a lot of it and since there are no preservatives you need to do this.  You can also freeze sliced bread in air tight zip locks.  Enjoy bread making.  It is enjoyable.

I took a few bites and threw the rest away.  I followed the recipe as written, I may have used the wrong setting on my breadmaker as it turned out heavy and dense.

This was a tasty bread.  However, I could not find quinoa in the store so that was deleted.  It was still tasty.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious! The trick is to follow the recommendations for your bread maker. Mine has a specific order of which ingredients are to be added. Liquid, dry, yeast last and tomatoes after the bread maker beeps the first time. I will most definitely make this again!

This bread is a great idea but poorly executed. By the time I was finished making adjustments it was no longer the same recipe.

Following Maggie McGuire's advice, this came out pretty good.  I had no wheat bran, so I subbed ground flax, and I added 2 Tbsp olive oil, 3 Tbsp gluten (as I had only regular flour on hand) 1 tbsp honey, 1/4 cup grated parmesan and 3/4 tsp garlic powder.   I also goofed on the yeast - adding a tbsp - but it came out fine.  Good flavor, not too dense but still hearty.

My bread didn't rise like some of the others' but the flavor is pretty good. I don't know if I will try it again. Otherwise do some of the modifications immedietly without trying the original recipe.

I thought this was excellent. It tastes like pizza bread! I sliced tomatoes and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top, put it in the toaster overn for a couple of minutes and voila! Yummy!

This is pretty good.  I use the dough cycle on my bread machine for most breads, and I used it for this bread too.  I added vital wheat gluten to compensate for the fact that I don't have bread flour.  It's generally 1 tbsp per cup of flour.  The quinoa makes this bread chewy; I kind of like it.  I didn't chop the sundried tomatoes and just used the ones in oil; worked fine and I didn't drain them.  Thanks for the recipe!

The bread smelled delicious but did not raise almost at all, even I have added gluten to make it easier. Maybe because I replaced quinoa with whole wheat (it suppose to be kind of healthy grain). Well, it wasn't really eatable because of structure, tasting it revealed possibly very good flavor. Sorry it did not work for me.

Very tasty, even on the day after! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added 1 tbsp sugar, 5 tbsp Parmesan cheese and 1 tsp garlic powder. Paired it with a pasta primavera dish and it made an excellent addition to our meal.

Made by hand. Didn't have dried Basil to hand so used Mediterranean mixed herbs. Excellent texture and rise. Will do again and use Basil to compare
