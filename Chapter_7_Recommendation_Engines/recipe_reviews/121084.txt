Fantastic.  We have been experimenting lately with new recipes - not really being vegetarian, but making an effort to increase our consumption of alternative proteins and vegetables.  Being somewhat more traditional eaters, we aren't ready to go straight for the tofu or eat completely different types of foods.  I have had so much fun making traditional foods with alternative ingredients.  This recipe is PERFECT for that!  I actually turned it into taco salad instead of tacos, but it's the same idea.  Great texture (better than ground beef, I think) - not at all mushy.  The lentils both bind to AND separate from one another like ground beef, making this a better taco "meat" than beans.  The flavor is fantastic.  I took the leftovers to work, and several people commented on how wonderful it smelled.  Conclusion:  SO GOOD that even meat and potatoes eaters won't be fazed by the absense of meat.

We just loved this recipe.  I did make these changes:  

1) The addition of sliced black olives to the toppings made available
2) Whole wheat tortillas instead of taco shells. The result was more of a "wrap" than a traditional taco.
3) No sour cream
4) Cooked the lentil mixture 10 minutes more than the recipe called for.  They just weren't soft enough after the original time.

The results were fabulous!  We'll be making this again.

Oh my, oh my! These were fantastic!! I don't even like lentils that well. It had a similar texture to beef (I cooked the lentils only until chewable but not mushy) and great flavor. ***I love taco shells, but for this recipe everyone did prefer whole wheat tortillas to the taco shells, though, after tasting both ways.***  Anyway, the hubby AND the kids were pleased. Low fat and high protein! Whoo Hoo! I may never make regular taco meat again =)

A taco tip that has never been  better than for this recipe...I use whole romaine leaves for the lettuce in tacos.  Hold leaf in hand,  add fillings,  then fold and set into taco shell.  Works especially well with flat bottomed hard shells.  Even after your shell breaks the lettuce helps hold your filling all together. Also keeps shell from getting soggy. This recipe is worthy of the glowing reviews.

Very tasty! I made these into tostadas with oven-crisped corn tortillas, refried black beans, the lentils (made with veggie stock to be vegetarian), lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese and sour cream. Avocado and olive would be tasty additions, too. The lentils were really flavorful and tender, and my whole family enjoyed them. I'll make this again.

These really are as good as people say they are.  My husband was pretty skeptical when I told him about lentils for dinner...  He couldn't really tell the difference between chicken tacos and these.  What a great healthy substitute!  Definitely will make again :)

Do you know what? It was my daughter's birthday just a few days ago and she wanted to eat out but we couldn't because it rained so I made the tacos, cake, and homemade icecream and she said that she wanted me to make the tacos for all of her birthdays. I thought that this was wonderful. And I had all of the ingredients in my pantry too.

This is a great idea.  I used the lentils on a tostada, w/ lettuce
tomatoes, cheese and a chpotle crema (just stir in the adobo from a can of chipotles in sour cream) Very good.

These were fantastic - I made them with the homemade taco seasoning and with a kosher (no actual meat additives) beef stock cube.  I will be making these regularly!

Great recipe! In my quest to put a few meatless meals on my table throughout the week, these lentils have become a hit, and noone seems to miss the regular taco meat when I substitute this in its place in my taco salad. Tasty and healthy!!

This was so good! I saved and printed the recipe for my Dad with ideas of trying it myself. Left the recipe laying in his recipe zone, (kitchen desk--big surprise) He instructed me to buy the ingredients   because he wanted to try it.  Totally chompy! We did a couple of things different. Used one reduced sodium can of chicken broth and added water for the rest of moisture requirement. Couldn't find salsa at the discount store so grabbed a 10 oz. can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles. As per prior review, we cooked the lentils 40 minutes. (Also higher altitude requires longer cook time for legumes. Can't wait to make  this for my meat eating guy. This recipe is so healthy and so yummy. Wait,  forgot to compare the price of hamburger lately. Lentils really do give a good texture and flavor to this dish.

I never thought I'd write a review saying I like lentil tacos, but here it is!  I've been looking for meals that have less meat in them lately, and this one seemed right up my alley since I love tacos.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but added a little taco seasoning and a bit more chicken broth so the lentils would cook a bit more and become softer.  Served with homemade guacamole and all the suggested sides.  Really delicious!!  A keeper for sure!  Thx!

This was so easy and very good. To lower the fat and shave off 100 calories per serving I used lettuce leaves in place of the taco shells. We all enjoyed this meal.

For an easier way to make this recipe try using 1 can of lentils instead of dry lentils and use a package of taco seasoning with 1 cup water instead of seasonings and broth. This makes a quicker easier meal and also makes sure the meal is vegetarian :)

Ok, so my husband recently asked me to start making 2 or so meatless dinners a week.  This was my first attempt.  Let me preface this by saying that my husband is very much a meat and potatos sort of man, but is becoming more health conscious about the food he/we eats.  I followed this recipe exactly when it comes to preparing the lentils.  They did simmer covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered for probably 20 more until all liquid was absorbed.  I didn't mash them.  As for the tortillas, I don't buy preformed taco shells.  Instead I lightly pan fry (1T oil in skillet at a time for 4 tortillas) them by first placing a soft corn tortilla flat in skillet and then adding filling in the middle, gently folding it over once it is soft enough and browning on each side of the taco until slightly crispy.  I know this adds some fat to the recipe, but I'm pretty sure preformed shells have *other* stuff in them.  I served them with mexican style sour cream, sharp cheddar cheese, tomatos, shredded cabbage, salsa and cilantro.  These were wonderful!  My 5 and 7 year olds who typically lose most of the meat out onto their plates loved these.  The lentils are sticky, so they stay where they are supposed to.  Thanks for the recipe!  Our first meatless family dinner was a success.

This was yummy! I filled pancakes with this, a little grated cheddar cheese, put them in a greased oven dish, some tomatoe sauce over, 20 min in oven on 180 C.

The first time I made this the lentils were so delicious before adding salsa that I left it out. I've made this several times now and in addition to omiting the salsa I recommend adding extra garlic, a tsp of taco seasoning, and cutting the chili powder to 1tsp (not because it's too spicy, but because it tends to dominate the flavor). This makes for a great taco salad. I've also made this with split peas instead of lentils (just add 15-20 minutes cooking time). This recipe is soooooooo good. It pleases my carnivor's palate and also my health-nut fiance's.

I love these, have made them many times. Excelletn texture, don't need meat at all. I've found that the best salsa is this Herdez taco salsa. It's gotta be the taco salsa, not the regular salsa... it has chipotle in it and the sweet smokey flavour goes wonderfully with the lentils.

I was skeptical about leaving out the meat but these are delicious!  My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating.  We had them with soft tortillas to start and then we put nacho chips on our plate and put all the toppings on them.  I will definitely be making these again.  I don't think that i'll ever eat meat tacos again!

Really yummy and tastes similar to ground beef! One thing I suggest is to soak the lentils overnight. It took 1.5 hours to cook the lentils and they were still not quite done. We ended up opening a can of refried beans for the tacos so that we could have dinner.

I've been using Allrecipes for at least a year now, and have found many great recipes but this is the first time I felt compelled to write a review.  My red-meat-loving husband always prefers red meat, especially in his tacos.  Amazingly, he couldn't stop eating these lentils and even gave me the okay to serve these instead of beef on taco nights!  The lentils have a good consistency and flavor (I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Taco-Seasoning-I/Detail.aspx).  Thanks for a great, healthy substitute for taco night.  Just brilliant!

We liked this.  Definitely a good substitute if you're wanting to cut down on red meat.  I was surprised at how "meaty" the texture felt.  I made a double batch, so we'll be enjoying some Taco Salad tonight for dinner.  I'm looking forward to it.

I love this recipe!!  I actually threw everything for the filling into my slow cooker for 8 hours.  The flavor is great! I will definitely make this again and again.

I followed the directions to a T and really like this alternative to beef tacos.  Since no one else in my family is interested in expanding their taco experience... I get to enjoy the leftovers on nachos the next day!

Very good! Used vegetarian broth instead of the chicken. For toppings I also had sliced black olives, onion, plain yogurt instead of sour cream. Oh, and blue corn taco shells - yum!

These tacos are fantastic. I admit I was skeptical at first but my daughter assured me they were good and she was correct.  My husband and I cannot seem to stop eating them once we start. Thanks for sharing.

Incredible!! What an awesome, healthy substitute. You could hardly tell the difference between these and ground beef tacos. They turned out great. Everyone liked them. I had to quadruple the recipe to feed our family, and they still wanted more!! I had soaked my lentils overnight so I cut the amount of chicken broth almost in half. I also just put the salsa on top of the tacos instead of adding to the lentils. We had this on corn tortillas with cabbage, onion, cilantro, and lemon. Will definitely make again!! Thanks for sharing:)

Fabulous.  I didn't change a thing.  These were hearty and perfectly seasoned.  I made them for a girls' dinner because I thought my husband wouldn't enjoy them, but after tasting them I'm confident he would enjoy them too!

I didn't have very high expectations, but this was pretty darn yummy!  I added a little more taco seasoning and also let it simmer longer, so that the lentils were easier to mash.

These were tasty!  I have never made lentil tacos before but they sure did taste similar to meat ones.  My hubby didnt really like them, but I think if next time I mash them up all the way instead of just partially he would like them better along with me as well.  Next time I will also use my usual taco seasoning packet to season the lentils as well.  I also liked these in whole wheat tortillas.  Thanks for the healthy recipe!  I will for sure make again!

These were great as is...although my tacos shells got soggy instantly, so i'd wait till each person wants a taco and have them scoop their insides in the shell and not do it all at once, that way the leftover tacos arnt ruined

"Outstanding" is what my husband said about these, and I agree! Thanks for a great and healthy recipe. I used corn tortillas instead of taco shells, and added minced cilantro and avocado to the toppings.

The lentils took almost an hour to cook but my pan has pour spouts that prevent a sealed covering so that may be why. They were pretty good, very similar to a bean burrito but with a better texture.  I used taco sesoning I rather than the spice, mrs espy's enchilada sauce and homemade guac and served as wet burritos.

My husband and I decided to go meatless twice a week. I am new to cooking with lentils, so I did a search on AR to see what sounded tasty. I came across this recipe..and since we love mexican food, I decided to give this one a try. Very nice flavor and easy enough to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

For whatever reason my lentils were far to thin to make into a taco, but of course with necessity being the mother of invention it made an amazing soup. Although the lentils were thick they were not thick enough to make tacos, soooooooooo I put the lentils in individual bowls and everyone put their toppings on the same as if it were a taco,  and we proceeded to use tortillas to eat the saco (soup/taco). My teenaged kids and their friends loved it. BTW....I used the "Taco Seasoning I" recipe on this site. I can't tell you how much I love it, and it allows me to control the salt I use.

Very very good.  My family was somewhat skeptical about this one but it really held up to the good reviews.  The 1 cup of lentils made plenty of "meat" for our family of 6.  I believe altogether we had 11 tacos and I have some leftover.  I tried this with both corn and flour and I prefer the corn tortillas.  In place of all the spices I simply used 1 pkg. of low salt taco seasoning.  This is a nice inexpensive meal.  It works well when you have forgotten to take something out to defrost for dinner.  Will definately make again.  Thanks !

I loved this dish! So tasty! The only change I made was to add a 1 tsp of smoked paprika. It added a nice earthy smokey flavour. I ran out of tortillas so I used my leftovers as a filling in a pita sandwich with loads of fresh veggies and home made tzatziki...hmmm

I love lentils.  I love tacos.  I was STILL skeptical making this recipe--but it was AWESOME!  the guacamole, cheese, tomatoes and cilantro all helped :)  I made my own taco shells with the corn tortillas i had in my fridge--just sprayed some olive oil on them, and put them under the broiler for a couple minutes on each side.  I would gladly serve this to all my meat-eating friends!!

These were so good, I even ate most of it with out the taco shells.  I did not add the salsa and I cut back alot on the chili  powder.  The only thing I used to top it was Tofutti's Sour Cream.

I made the lentil filling from this recipe.  I thought 1Tbsp of chili powder sounded like too much, so I used 1/2T, and the results were still much too spicy.  Also, the 2.5 cups broth (I used veggie broth as I wanted vegetarian taco filling) evaporated before the lentils were tender and I had to add extra water and continue cooking (I did have the pot covered).  I would choose another recipe for lentil tacos or just come up with one on your own as the ratio of ingredients on this recipe seem to be very off.

My kids are raging carnivores but when we have lentil tacos they become lentilvores!  Despite 478 reviews, I was still skeptical, but the recipe won us over on the first try.  I kept the salsa separate rather than mixing it in.  And I used water instead of broth and just upped the onion, garlic and spices a little.  The recipe does not call for salt or pepper but I added some to taste once the lentils were cooked.

These were wonderful! They've made "Meatless Mondays" a hit! I didn't change a thing, but I did serve them with Pico De Gallo. I might try making them with beef broth next time. Thanks for the great recipe! Update 1/23/2012 - Made with Beef Broth in place of the chicken broth and they were just as yummy :)

Ok, so this is not the mind blowing vegitarian recipe (if you use veg broth) that I was expecting.  Maybe it was the other reviews which made me think one bite would make me forget all about my beef cravings I've been having since cutting red and white meat out of my diet 6 months ago (I'm a pescatarian now --look it up :)). Made the recipe with only the one change (veg broth) and found the cumin taste too strong.  Not a huge cumin fan in general but acknowledge that it is necessary and enhances some recipes, but I would use less next time since I could taste it's bitterness.  Still a good recipe and I will make again.  Asked my husband if it tasted like meat to him and he just laughed.  I say try it, but like all meat substitutes in the end it ain't meat, but you'll feel better for eating it.

Awesome!  I didn't even miss the meat. I added the spices with the onions and cooked for about 5 minutes before adding the garlic and other ingredients.  I also added extra spices and a can of green chilies.  Excellent!

Loved this recipe.  Followed the directions except I did not mash the lentils.  This was tasty and healthy, a hit with me.  The picky husband said, "I'll eat it but you have to add some meat to my taco."  Oh well, I will keep trying...eating it is progress.

"Owelreaowlyikeiess! Ensars!  Ensars!"  That would be my husband saying: "I really like this! 10 stars!  10 stars!"  with his mouth full!  LOL This was fantastic!  Amazingly, the kids liked it too.  I was doubtful... I took a chance... I am so glad I did!  As far as changes go I skipped the oil and make the lentils in the broth along with onion and garlic.  When almost all of the liquid was absorbed I added the seasonings.  We used soy cheese and soy sour cream.  The lentils were tender but not pasty.  No more ground beef for us.  If you are looking to eliminate meat or save $ then give this a try.  You will be so glad you did!

Five star plus recipe!  I've made these several times and thought it was time to write a review.  These are absolutely delicious exactly as written. The perfect blend of spices.  My family was a bit skeptical but they all devoured them just the same as if they were meat tacos with no complaints.  Every time I make them, I keep thinking why have I waited so long to make them again...that's how delicious they are!

What a FUN meal!  We really enjoyed theses tacos.  The lentils were cooked to perfection and was a great change from the normally used ground beef.  We'll be having these again real soon.

I've made this twice now, and it has been a hit! Today I made the lentil/salsa mixture with veg. broth and then made them into cheeseless enchiladas topped with enchilada sauce, green onions, and olives. Baked it and then added chopped fresh tomatoes. They turned out excellent. Didn't miss the meat or cheese! This recipe is very versatile and will definitley be a staple in our home.

awesome! I quadrupled to use my 2 lb bag of lentils and to freeze the leftovers for Mexican Lasagna. I used 2 large onions, 4 stalks celery, 4 carrots, 4 tsps minced garlic, 4 tsps home made taco seasoning, 4 tsps chili powder, 4 tsps oregano, 2 tsps black pepper, 1 bay leaf, 9 cups vegetable stock, 1 can of Rotel and tomato sauce to make the right consistency after I mashed with my immersion blender. I simmered for 30 minutes, stirred and added more stock, simmered for another 30, removed bay leaf and mashed, let cool slightly then added tomato sauce as need, about 1/2 cup. My kids loved these, my youngest son is 8 and had 3! I used whole wheat flour tortillas our personal preference.

My family loved these!  My husband thought I was crazy at first, so I made them while he was out of town.  When I told him they were awesome he was still skeptical so when he came home I told him we were having leftover lentil tacos for dinner.  When he took his first bite he laughed and said he was shocked but they were really good!  I followed the recipe for the most part except I used garlic and onion powder instead of fresh and did not add the salsa to the lentils.  I served these on flour tortillas with spanish rice, reduced fat sour cream, tomatos, salsa and cheddar cheese.  Thanks for a great healthy budget friendly recipe! I will be making these a lot!

Delicious and healthy. Decreased the spice a bit as my daughter does not like anything spicy, and she liked this. Could also do this with black beans as well, but canned, not dried. Thanks!

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly.  Amount of Lentils was way more than necessary for 6 tacos but easy to refrigerate and reheat.

during college I came across this recipe and used just taco seasoning b/c it was what I had and it was pretty good but tonight I followed the recipe and loved the result so much more! I served these with the mexican rice recipe on this website and I couldn't have been happier. My 8 month old daughter loved it too!

I loved these Michelle! Lentils are delicious anyway and packed with fiber and protein they're  also one of the healthiest foods you can eat. For my taste buds a little cumin goes a long way so I cut way back on the amount but increased the chili powder. As my significant other says, this is real "Linda Food!"  Thanks so much Michelle!

Amazing! As with everyone else I was a little nervous... but they were SO good! My boyfriend is a meat and potatoes kind of guy - and even he LOVED them. I just used a package of McCormick's taco seasoning instead of the chili powder, oregano, etc. I also used Pace Hot Salsa to add some heat and some black beans for a different texture. I can't wait to eat the leftovers! PS - warm crunchy tacos are key... I tried them on a soft taco and it wasn't as good.

for my taste I would make them a bit more spicy next time.  Thankfully I also made some super spicy guac, otherwise the tacos might have been a bit blah...worth trying though for sure - even my husband, who was hesitant had to admit they were pretty good.

Fantastic! I can't believe how great this turned out. I was skeptical at first, I saved this recipe so long ago, but haven't made before because it sounds so weird. I omitted the oregano, chili and cumin and added my homemade taco seasoning and some jalapenos. Served with homemade Guacamole on a soft tortilla.

These were AMAZING!!!!!!!! I can't express enough how delicious these were. Being a vegetarian makes it more difficult to find satisfying recipes for my non-vegetarian boyfriend and I to enjoy together, but this was one of our greatest successes. I used veggie broth and the large green, organic lentils. I think that some people are getting a soupy outcome because they are using smaller, quicker cooking lentils? Also, the simmering uncovered at the end is crucial to evaporating the residual liquid. I added a few dashes of hot sauce with the salsa for some more depth of flavour and omitted the sour cream. TOTALLY delicious. I was still talking about them hours later. Thank you!!!!!

This is absolutely replacing all other taco fillings for me.  So delicious, and healthy!  Very delicious with crunchy shells, and I'm sure they would be tasty with soft flour shells as well.  Both my parents and my husband love these!

At hit for this meat eater. I used beef broth, not chicken. Next time I will use a high quality salsa, not store brand or just have it one the side. I don't think you really need the salsa mixed in. Makes more than 6 servings(which is a good thing), will try the leftovers for lunch. Will make these again and again******! Lentils? Have heard about them for years. Who would have thunk it?

I wish there was more flavor here. I followed the recipe as written, but I definitely think there is room for improvement.Overall,I'd say it went pretty well. My daugher would not even try it, but my hubby really enjoyed it. I'll make this again, and maybe add a bit more seasoning. Thanks for an interesting and nutritious recipe!

My husband and 5-year old really enjoyed this.  It is a very budget-friendly and health-conscious alternative to ground beef.  I did use beef broth instead of the suggested chicken broth to give it a more beefy, taco meat-like flavor.  I also added fresh, chopped cilantro and a dash of red pepper in the last few minutes of cooking time along with the salsa.  Delicious!

What a wonderful alternative to beef tacos!  My husband who is very picky, especially about lentils, loved it and requested that it become a regular menu item.

Makes a great taco salad!

This was better than my normal taco meal!  I did not know I liked lentils, yes a different texture but very tasty.  The only change I made was instead of taco seasoning I used: 1 teaspoon chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/8 teaspoon dried oregano, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  To garnish my flour tortilla, I added shredded cheddar cheese, lettuce, sour cream, chopped tomatoes, jalepeno slices and hot sauce.

The lentils had a great taco flavor, but I had to cook them for 40 additional minutes to get them to be tender and not too liquidy.

As I was making these for my family yesterday, I was thinking...kids won't like this!  
Well...we ALL loved it.  I didn't change a thing but did as another viewer mentioned to use romain leaves to hold the lentils, so when you bite into the tacos, it doesn't fall on your plate.  Thank you for this great recipes.  I will be making this instead of ground beef from now on :)

Having heard about these tasty tacos for years I have no idea what took me so long to make them!  Wasted time, in my opinion, because these are fabulous!  Even the carnivores in your life will be wild about these tacos.  I used thinly shredded cabbage instead of lettuce as a topping because I like the added crunchiness and nutrition.  We don’t have “regulars” in our house but these are destined to become just that.  My husband is already asking for them again.

These are really good! I'm glad I finally tried them, I kept putting them on my menu and then not making them. They were worth the wait but I won't be waiting so long to make them a second time :) I used canned lentils so I added just a bit of broth to wet them (and used beef broth because I had an open carton). I added less salsa as well. Kept the seasoning and toppings the same. Really delicious, was like eating a refried bean taco but healthier.

This is just a great little recipe.  I love meat and would not imagine this would be just as good as beef tacos, but it is!  I would be more than happy to have this in lieu of regular beef tacos.

This tastes just as good as meat tacos. It's definitely going to be added to our regular recipe rotation. I will say that I had to double the spices for our family, but I know that we like extra-spicy food.

I made this with very small adjustments - I added chopped celery in with the onions and garlic, and exchanged 1/2 cup chicken broth with V8.  Rather than mash with a fork I pulsed a couple times with my immersion blender.  DELICIOUS!  Even good alone in a bowl with a little shredded cheese on top.

My husband didn't realize these weren't made with ground beef until I told him. He was blown away by how good they were. We just loved them! Made them exactly as is, using brown lentils, and Old El Paso mild salsa. The only small change I made was to use vegetable broth (Harvest Sun brand) Thanks for an amazing recipe that we'll be making again and again!

This is one of my favorite dinners to make now.  I love to use the leftovers for nachos and taco salad.  My kids (5 and 3 years) love it too.  It' delicious with greek yogurt instead of sour cream and chopped avocado.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

Very tasty!  I subbed vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, and served it as a taco salad with lettuce, black beans, shredded cheese, salsa and broken-up tortilla chips.  Will definitely make again!

These were awesome!! I just used water because I didn't the any veggie both and just used a taco spice packet. These were a hit! My 7 yr old son ate 3 and is requesting them again for dinner tonight.

Yum yum! My family loved this and so did I as we are a family of mostly vegetarians. So I am always looking for great ways to get more lentils into us. This was a great recipe but some of us were not keen on the level of heat from the chilli powder and had to
counter it by adding more cheese and sour cream which takes away from the health aspect of the meal.
Of course as vegetarians I used vegetable stock (low 
sodium) instead of chicken stock and cut up some 
bell peppers too.
My devoted to meat eating husband liked this meal too. In fact he went back for seconds and said he couldn't taste or tell the difference from the traditional meat version :)

Doubled the recipe except for the oregano and the salsa-I left those amounts as listed.  Turned out perfect!  Lots of flavor!!  I'm definitely going to make this again for our taco/tostada nights!

We love these! They take longer to cook though. Maybe, we like them mushier rather than al dente. I add a lot more garlic and my own blend of Taco Seasoning. I also added some chopped up roasted hatch green chilies for more flavor. Easy, good dinner! With the leftovers I'll grill up some chicken & have soft chicken tacos.

I have made these several times now.  They are definitely tasty and a healthy and cheap alternative to using ground beef or even turkey.  My husband doesn't like them as much as regular tacos, but I think they make a great taco rice dish.

YUMMY! I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but we used whole wheat tortillas instead of taco shells. It was delicious, and my 3 year old gobbled it right up. The meat was not even missed!

Easy to prepare and tasted pretty good, actually!  I was skeptical and will say I didn't forget that I wasn't eating a real taco, but I was fooled enough to believe that it tasted pretty similar!  A great way to incorporate non meat meals into your routine.  Thanks!

I LOVED these tacos! They were amazing!
However, I used brown lentils and they really had to cook a lot longer than the author suggests. I would suggest 45-50 minutes.

These turned out pretty good.  They do need to simmer about twice as long as they suggest in order to be soft or soak them before cooking.  But the taste was great!

Awesome! Everyone in my family enjoyed this. I've made this several times. The other day I used a Taco Dinner kit that included the taco seasoning packet. I just added the seasoning packet to the dried lentils and water and cooked them until they were tender.

These were fabulous! I made it exactly to the directions and they were perfectly seasoned. I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer covered and then an extra 10 minutes uncovered, but other than that what a treat! I preferred them to the meat version I also made. They were the perfect texture for taco filling, but would be great alone, with tortilla chips or on top of a salad. I ate quite a bit, and had to stop myself from eating more. These leftovers will definitely be finished and I will most certainly make these again. Between these and the Delicious Black Bean burritos, I can see that being a vegetarian isn't all that bad!

The main reason I am giving this 5 stars is because everyone I prepared this recipe for (4 people) doubted that "Lentil Tacos" could be "Tasty." But when they took their first bite, they all said, "MMMM..." which I believe is a synonym for "tasty." I too was a bit skeptical, but confidence overruled due to the fact that 375 Allrecipes users rated this as a 4.5. I knew it had to be good. I followed the directions exactly, and it was delicious! Served with Mexi-corn from a can and Honey Roasted Red Potatoes (this site), which I also love. I started the lentils first, then the potatoes. The lentils and potatoes both took longer than the stated 35 minutes to cook, and basically they were done at the same time (about 45 minutes or maybe a bit less).

Thought these were great! Being a vegetarian I always am looking for a new way to redo meat menus. The flavor is great and the left overs I put into a flour tortilla and added othe condiments to make it a wonderful burrito! Yummy! Thanks!

These were pretty good.  They did seem a bit runny though, but the taste was great.

This has been on my menu for weeks.  I just kept pushing it to the next week, probably because I just couldn't imagine it being very good.  Was I ever wrong.  These lentil tacos are fabulous!  The seasoning is excellent and they are a fine substitute for ground beef tacos.  Even my husband didn't miss the meat tonight.

I can't believe it took me so long to try this, I have to say I was hesitant.  We made these one night when we forgot to buy ground turkey and it was a huge hit.  Even my 8 and 10 year olds loved it.  This is now the standard filling for taco night, we don't even make meat anymore.

I'm giving this 5 stars because even my meat loving husband thought they were great. I LOVED them.  I will venture that the recipe should be edited though, given that so many reviewers had a problem with the cooking time for the lentils. There is no way 35 minutes is enough. I gave my (very fresh) lentils an hour and a half and they still could have been just a bit softer, but we needed to eat.  I followed the recipe as written, and nothing should be changed as it's perfect; just the cooking time. I would put the whole thing in the crockpot next time and just let it sit all day. Much easier that way.

These were good. Hubby and daughter liked it. Daughter said it was awesome. I will make again. Maybe next time I'll try using taco seasoning and see how that works out.

Made this for the fam and doubled it.  It took much longer than the 6-8 minutes to thicken up.  I won't quite double the broth next time.  I used an immersion blender to mash up the lentils.  I had to add more spice b/c we like spicy food.  I didn't put the salsa in the lentils but served it on the side with fresh guac.  It was funny to see all the skeptical faces turn to smiles as they realized how tasty, healthy, and inexpensive this meal is.  My DH is planning to take lentils on camping trips.  I can't wait to share this recipe with friends who are very budget conscience lately.  Thanks!

Update:  I made this again, doubling it, and used 4 cups of beef broth.  It makes sense to use beef if you are trying to make it taste like beef!  It was even better!  I also put a can of diced green chilis in with the lentils.

I have made this many times now and love it.  I do eat some meat but prefer vegetarian if I can, and these tacos made me forget about the meat version.  I made these in the slow cooker on the low, 8 hr setting.  I just dumped all of the ingredients into the crock pot and let it go!  I have used several different types of salsa and every batch has turned out great.  This time I added chopped zuchinni (you can mash it up at the end if necessary to make it unnoticable to others, kids or husband) to make it more veggie dense.  I also typically add a taco seasoning packet (low sodium) but it is good exactly as written in the recipe.  I prefer this on crispy taco shells with lettuce, cheese, and greek yogurt, and taco sauce, but I often switch it up and have it on soft tacos or taco salad.  Always good.

I didn't change a thing when I made these.  We really liked them and tried them with both hard shells and w.w. torillas.  Hard shells were the favorite with the kids.  My cooking time for the lentils was closer to 45 minutes.

Had these for dinner last night and they were great!  The lentils were done in 25 minutes and there wasn't that much liquid left to cook off in another 6-8 minutes.  I sampled this before adding the 1 C salsa and liked it even more before the salsa!  However, let me caveat that by saying I used to be a vegetarian, so I like the taste of lentils and other veggie options for normal meat foods.  My picky boyfriend ate two tacos but said it would be better in addition to rather than instead of meat.  Pshhh what does he know.

WOW! Really great taste with chicken! I will make this again and again, just as written (except I use approx 1.75 lbs of cubed chicken and 2 bullion cubes with 1/8th cup of water).

I thought these were fantastic!  We felt they were like eating something between a refried bean and ground turkey as far as the consistency of the lentil.  VERY good.  Also, a very good option (and so healthy) if you're watching money in this economy..i.e. $4-5/lb. ground turkey or meat for this recipe vs. 75 cents for the lentils it's just a smart and delicious recipe all around to have!

These were great.  My husband thought these were even better than tacos made with ground beef.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and served the tacos with flour tortillas.  They were great warmed up the next day too.  This will be a new staple in our home.

Really good!  My husband just walked in the door to an awesome aroma and I made him try the lentils on a tortilla chip (while he closed his eyes).  He thought it was really good taco meat . . . then I told him what it was!  He ate a whole bowl of it with the tortilla chips.  I did a few things differently (of course--I normally do!).  I added jarred minced garlic instead of fresh (that's all I had).  I added about 2 T. fresh sofrito (Puerto Rican spice--I just had a friend make me a batch, so I threw some in there).  And a sprinkle of Adobo seasoning in addition to the other ingredients.  I only added a little bit of jarred salsa, because I wasn't convinced that it really needed it (it doesn't really).  I can't wait to share it with the rest of my family (who is really into legumes!).  I think it would be delish as a taco salad, like others have said.

I used veg. broth, but next time might just use water, because this was plenty flavorful.  I tried using corn tortillas, but this recipe really needs the crunch.  So I used the leftovers to make taquitos.  Rolled up in corn tortillas held together by a toothpick, sprayed them with cooking oil on a baking sheet and baked at high temperature for a few minutes.  They were really good with guacamole.

One of the best tacos I've ever had (fish tacos remain my favorite.) I made these for my daughter & ended up eating so much she doesn't have much to take home for herself! I had forgotten how satisfying & filling vegetables can be when subbed for meat. These would also make a great substitute for higher fat refried beans. We used a lower sodium salsa, light sour cream, and Weight Watchers reduced fat shredded cheese.

I made these looking for a different option than ground turkey meat.  We did like these and will make them again.  You could just make the lentils and use a taco seasoning packet (although the spices in this recipe are basically what are in those packets).  It was a great option and we will do again, thanks!

Served it up to 1 14 yr old and 2 adults. 14 yr old preferred 'normal' ground beef tacos - BUT - ate 5 of these "because he was hungry". The adults loved it. The lentils could never be taken for ground beef but they did have the right flavor for this dish - especially with the toppings. 
Served it with hard shells, soft tortillas and Calico Rice (from this site). Healthy meal!

These were well received by my dh and 8yo, who thoroughly enjoyed them.  Even my 5 nad 4yo's ate them without complaint.

I modified by using only 2 tsp chili powder and only 1 tsp cumin.  Still yummy and will make again.

This recipe achieves that elusive "taco flavor".  My boyfriend was at first skeptical of putting lentils in a taco, but he came around once he smelled it cooking!  We both loved these.

YUMMY! I bought 12 taco shells for my family of 3 & there's not a single one left!  My 4 yr old ate 3 of these tacos.  I added some fat free refried beans to the bottom of the taco shell to help hold in the lentils.  And I also reduced some of the spices, which I'd do again next time & maybe reduce even more. THANKS!

I enjoyed this recipe.  However, I found that I needed to substitute vegtable broth for the chicken broth to make it fully vegetarian.
It still tasted very nice.

FANTASTIC to make healthy nachos! I made these lentils for dinner one night. I placed them on a bed of tortilla chips, and added black beans and corn, then topped with shredded cheese. I baked them until the cheese melted. The kids were thrilled to have nachos for dinner. Topped with pico de gallo and sour cream. There was not a crumb left, and the kids each requested it again very soon. Even my husband ate it and had seconds. He is not usually fond of lentils, but he did enjoy this dinner! Thank you for the fabulous recipe!

When I asked my husband if this recipe is a keeper: "Oh yeah!" Only change I made was to use 1/2 tsp paprika in place of the oregano and added 1/4 tsp salt. The lentils cooked just over 30 minutes and then I let it sit with the lid off on the still hot stove; they continued to soak up some of the juice. Didn't even need to mash them. My baby loved it too!

These are awesome! I made the recipe with the change of sauteing the onion/garlic in extra virgin coconut oil, as I never use canola. Also just used a whole onion instead of measuring out 1 cup. The lentils took 40 min before they were tender, and I didn't mash them at all. Love this recipe, and it will become a regular!

Even with all of those spices, it mostly just tasted like lentils, which was not what I'd hoped for.  I might try again with different and/or more spices but as-is, this wasn't great for us.  And I'm a vegetarian.

Wow!  This truly is a great recipe exactly as is.  My husband and I even liked it on top of Mexican rice without the tortilla.  Good with corn tortillas and flour tortillas.  Topped with Mexican crumbling cheese, red onion,and tomato.  I know I'll definitely put these in our regular meal rotation.  Yum!  Needs to cook more like 45 minutes though.

OK - I contemplated making this recipe forever and with great skepticism!  I even cooked the traditional taco meat alongside this as a back up plan.  However, I am here to say that this really IS a wonderful alternative to traditional tacos!  IMHO it does not taste like traditional tacos, as it has a taste all its own - one I personally think I like better!  It was also very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Michelle Thomas!

Super yummy!  Followed the recipe for the filling exactly.  We used tortillas instead of taco shells.  And the only toppings we used were cheese and a homemade cabbage salsa. Mmmmmm!

I have made this recipe a dozen times, and I'm now just getting around to rating it. It's a TOTAL keeper. It's super healthy and we just love it. I still eat grass fed beef and organic chicken tacos, but we enjoy lentils in the mix for a little variety. I use only HALF of the salsa mixed in. If you add the whole amount they are a little runny. You can always add.......

Wow! This recipe is sooo good. I was in the mood for tacos and don't like using the fake meat substitutes, as they are not very healthy, and these were exactly what I was hoping for! My kids devoured them. Definitely going to be a regular meal in our house!

These were delicious and I wish that I could give them more than 5 stars.  My husband has never really been a lentil fan and having moved to Africa, lentils abound.  Other then the lentil mixture being too spicy for my kids, I did not miss the meat in these tacos.  I have made it again several times, a little less spicy, and all have enjoyed them.  Probably my favorite recipe that I have gotten off this site.  Thanks for sharing.

I had this for my first time last night and have been craving it ever since!  I quit eating meat about a year ago, and recipes like this is the reason I haven't missed meat.  My only changes were that I used vegetable broth and I added some cayenne for an extra kick of spice!  I already plan on making it again for next week.  It is healthy, tasty, and also very quick and easy to make.

As a meat eater, this was certainly not tastier than regular ground beef tacos, but for someone who is looking to have something that is both healthy and tasty, this is a good option.  I made everything as stated, and had a lot of filling.  I used it for both tacos and a taco salad, and I think it went better with the taco salad.  I will make this again, but will probably make it a bit spicier.

Delicious tacos!  Added a little bit of cayenne pepper and a little bit of paprika and used red lentils instead of brown.  Looking forward to trying this again soon.  Used cilantro, greek yoghurt, romaine, cheddar, and salsa as toppings.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delish!  I changed just a couple of things because of what I had on hand.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and could have used more because we like garlic a lot.  I only had veggie broth and it was fine. I think I cooked the lentils a little bit longer according to other's suggestions, but I didn't want lentil mush. A bit firm has a nice finished texture.  I used a peach/pineapple salsa - maybe not many people would like that, but we did.  Instead of lettuce we used fresh spinach.  I will make this again and again.  Eating the leftovers today mixed with brown rice in a flour tortilla for lunch.  So good!

Holy cow! I stumbled upon this recipe because I was looking for a recipe to use up the lentils living in our cupboard and WOW, we LOVED this meal. You couldn't even tell you were eating lentils!! Great meat-less meal. One of our favorites now.

Soooooo good! Everyone loved these, even the 2 and 4 year olds. The 4 yr old ate 3 tacos!! I did replace the spices for a taco seasoning to make things extra simple and lots more garlic than called for.  I also just served the salsa on the side since we do have little ones at home. Everyone asked that this be put into the dinner rotation. I love having one more vegetarian option for a meat eating family!

WOW! We were having friends over for a taco dinner and since I'm a vegeterian, I was looking for an alternative to tofu crumbles, which I really don't like.  These were soooo delicious! My meat eater friends even tried these and thought they were delicious as well.  I followed this recipe exactly and will never use fake, processed meat again for tacos or fajitas. Now if I can only find a good substitute for bacon....

These were fantastic.  I added about an extra cup of chicken brother though.  2 small cans of broth is the perfect amount for these.  I loved the flavor and I prefer this over regular taco meat filling.  It was REALLY easy to make.  These will definitely be a regular part of our menu.

Great recipe. Received immediate induction into the weekday dinner rotation. My family loves meat and these were a hit with the kids (ages 3 and 6) and the hubby. I added plain yogurt which I mixed right into the lentils. I also added a little cayenne pepper for me and my husband for extra kick. Cheap, healthy and most importantly delicious!

You really must try this recipe!  I used 2tsp regular chili powder and 1tsp chipotle chili powder and didn't mix in the salsa, just served it on the side.  So good, husband said it was better than the usual beef filling!

This is an amazing and healthy recipe!  My parents are strict, self-proclaimed "meat and potatoes" people, but I served these to them for dinner one evening while they were visiting, and they were quite a hit!  They couldn't believe that there wasn't any meat involved!  Yum!

I just made this and thought the flavor was absolutely amazing - however, there was not enough liquid called to cook the lentils fully - so I would go with more broth (and being vegeterian, I used vegetable broth)..otherwise, fantastic flavor / thanks for sharing...

Wow!  These really do taste almost like ground beef!  The consistancy is a little different; but, I think this is as close as it gets for a low fat alternative and they are really good!  My 9yr old loved them and there were no complaints at dinner.  I used canned beans and put them in the crockpot; but, I think you could use canned beans on the stovetop for a faster cooking time as well.

This was really good.  Even my 11 yr. old son thought this was yum (he was suspicious at first).  Didn't have oregano and didn't want chili for the baby, so I added more cumin, used veg. broth, and some more salt.   Excellent - thanks for sharing!

I've made this a few times but forgot to review it! I've made the filling to have with rice. Love the taste and the innovation! Different lentils have drastically different cook times, I use this page as a reference:

This was really good. My picky kids even ate them and said "Yummy" They took a little longer to cook then the recipe said, but that may have just been my lentils. I will make these again.

Yummmmm. These are a great low-fat option and did I mention cheap!!! I have made these at family functions and they are a huge hit! If I am out of the seasonings I have used a pack of taco seasoning. It works just as well. My husband likes to use the lentils in burritos with rice and the usual topping!

Delicious! I soaked the beans as a few reviewers suggested just to save cook time. My husband and 15 month old daughter LOVED them -- and we really don't eat beans frequently at all.

I'd never tried lentils before but my co-worker raves about this recipe. I finally bought some lentils so I could give it ago and I really enjoyed it but it was a bit heavy.  My boyfriend, a picky eater felt the same way. We will definitely make it again but would have it as a dip and perhaps add some sweet corn.

I stuck to the recipe this first and WOW! A Keeper! Just a delicious, well balanced mix. And just as good reheated the next day - next time I'll likely double it. Recommend: serve with guacamole (made w/greek yogurt vs. sour cream) to replace the plain sour cream.

We love meat.  That being said, this was actually very good!  I'd never had lentils before and this was a good first experience.  We used salsa to top the tacos instead of plain tomatoes, plus we used tomato-flavored tortilla shells.  Thanks for helping us to expand our healthy recipes!

Wow! I've had this sitting in my RB for a long time and finally decided it was time to try it! I was impressed! I know I've never cooked with a lentil and really don't think myself or my hubs had ever eaten them. Only sub I made was I used beef broth in place of the chicken. It did use more broth and took around 45minutes to prepare. I used brown lentils and was told they take longer to cook then red. My hubs was VERY against this while I was making it! As we were eating he said he folded and that he actually liked them. It was a great cheap alternative to regular beef tacos. We used the leftovers for nachos the next day and those were really good as well. I will make again :) Next time I will try with our normal taco seasoning too .Thanks for the recipe!

Not quite what I was expecting, but not bad! I used our regular taco seasoning to keep hubby happy. It's healthier for sure, but we still love traditional tacos. Might try to mix it with ground beef next time. Giving this 3 stars because my lentils took over an hour to cook and I needed more liquid (over a cup more), following all directions exactly for the cooking process.

Delicious!   I didn't miss the meat in these tacos.  It did take longer than 30 minutes, but we used more than 1 cup of lentils.  I rated it 4 stars, as it's the average of my family's vote.

This recipe is amazing. The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of chicken, for obvious reasons. The texture of the lentils is similar to ground beef and the flavor is even better. My family tends to cringe at the idea of vegetarian meals, but I don't think we'll ever make tacos with ground beef again!

This dish was incredibly flavorful and filling! I have made it twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and my boyfriend and I really loved it. The second time I made it in the slow cooker and used vegetable broth instead. I did not like the slow cooker version as much and will continue the stovetop preparation in the future. The lentils just didn't get as nice a texture in the slow cooker. We had leftovers both times and made wrap sandwiches and quesadillas with the filling. Great re-heated in these dishes. This was really a great recipe, I highly recommend it. My advice is to follow the directions exactly and remember to use your favorite salsa, I think that is key. I will probably try the vegetable broth again the next time my vegetarian brother visits, I will let you know how that turns out.

My family have "officially" became vegetarian these past few months.. and this was amazing! I will make this again and again. All 3 of my small kids LOVED this.. I used the flat corn tortillas and quickly heated them with olive oil till crispy, then filled with lots of homemade salsa, and all the toppings.. sooooo good! I will note that I used the taco seasoning recipe from this site..

This were delicious, and easy.  We put all the ingredients in the crock pot and let them simmer.  Yummy!  Also they are very filling.

I did the slow cooker routine as well.  Worked fabulously and the lentils were delicious.  Used exact ingredients and wouldn't change a thing.  Will definitely do again.

My tough-to-please 3 year old took a couple bites and declared to me "THIS IS THE BEST DINNER EVER!"  I had to agree with his sentiment - these came out great! The ONLY modification I made to the recipe was to only put a little of the salsa in the mixture.  I left the rest for the side to put on yourself if you like lots of salsa.  Otherwise, it was perfect.  I liked this better than normal beef tacos.

How have I not reviewed this yet? These tacos are great! Easy to make vegetarian - use vegetable stock instead. The first time my husband made it, they were amazing. The last few times though the lentils haven't cooked through and have been too hard, they didn't mush like the first time. I love the tip from the reviewer before me -to put the mixture in a slow cooker. I'll try that next time.

The end product was pretty tasty but the lentils took WAY longer to cook than stated.  There wasn't enough flavor either so I added a packet of taco seasoning.  Served with shredded colby jack and fresh avocado. Yum! Will make again with some tweaking.

I thought these were pretty tasty but not exceptional the first night we ate them. However, the lentils were so much better heated up the next day. The flavor and consistency improved greatly. We used the filling for tacos and spooned over nachos. I would definitely recommend making the filling ahead of time or when you're already in the kitchen cooking something else. Then you can easily reheat and assemble the next day.

These were EXCELLENT! They came together in a snap because I had precooked lentils the other day (lentils, water, a quartered onion, 2 cloves of garlic, a carrot, celery stalk and bay leaf into the slow cooker for about 2 hours or until tender). I used two cups of those cooked lentils (the rest are in my freezer for other recipes), added them to the sauteed onion and garlic, and in ten minutes we were sitting down to eat.  The filling is very meat-like, but a little on the mild side for me - next time I'll use my own taco seasoning which has a little cayenne in it.  Easy enough to customize though, as I added some chopped jalapenos as a topping and it was perfect for me!  Planning on using some of the leftover for taco salad tomorrow.  Thanks for sharing, Michelle!

I made these tacos using beef broth instead of chicken broth because that's what I had on hand.  I'll definitely make these again, but it didn't taste close enough to regular tacos to completely replace them.

I'm vegan, so I just made the lentil part and added olives, lettuce, salsa, tomatoes, and onions. Doesn't even need cheese to be a great taco! I never realized what a great meat substitute lentils can be!

These are delicious.  I have made them numerous times and my meat-eater fiance doesn't even miss the ground beef.  The only changes I typically make are to add a little ground coriander with the spices and some chopped fresh cilantro at the end.  I have made these with beef broth because I had some left over and it is definitely not as good as when made with the chicken broth.  Thanks for the great recipe

very tasty and filling! Definitely more like a burrito filling than taco. and for those who say that they had to cook their lentils longer, those lentils might be old. Old lentils take longer to cook.

These are really wonderful.  I took them to a family dinner and though they were skeptical, everyone raved after they had them.  Even my mother, who REALLY hates lentils, loved this recipe.  I like to make a really huge batch and freeze the leftovers for a future meal.   The first time I made it was by the book, but I have since been omitting the onion and adding extra garlic due to food allergies in the family.  It still tastes wonderful!  It's nice to find something that tastes good AND is good for your family!

I've made these three or four times now. Initially, I gave them a four-star rating because I thought that, though excellent, they weren't quite as good as regular tacos. But every time I make them, I find myself obsessing over how good they are. Now I think I actually like these better than traditional tacos with ground beef. So I am upping to a five-star rating! In addition to being ridiculously tasty, they are quick and cheap. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was a great substitution for meat!  My daughter and I loved it, my husband agreed that it tasted just like the real thing but he had a difficult time with the different consistency.  A great healthy alternative to meat tacos, I really enjoyed this.

Excellent! Healthy alternative for taco night. Made as written, and I wouldn't recommend changing a thing. We've had them w/ soft shells, hard shells, on a taco salad--loved them each time.

My son said this was the first vegetarian meal he came away satisfied with. That was because he ate at least 5 tacos - and so did his father. Make sure to fry up some corn tortillas fresh before eating. I used Monterey Jack cheese because that is what I had on hand and it was great.

Having never met a lentil, I was a little skeptical of trying this recipe but, to my surprise, it was better than I imagined.  My family thought these tacos were okay but did not LOVE them.  However, I can see if someone needed to watch his/her cholesterol levels, this would be a great alternative to the real thing.  Thanks for sharing.

Used catalina dressing to mix into the lettuce/shredded cheese mixture. Made a taco salad with this using a combination of corn chips and tortilla chips-with-jalapeno. This made it a little high in sodium, but still delicious. No leftovers in this house!

These are GREAT!  Lentils are so inexpensive, and this tastes just like real tacos only they are healthier!

Delicious!  And easy!  And cheap!  No one is going to think these are ground beef tacos though.  Just call them what they are, vegetarian tacos, bean tacos, whatever, they're yummy!

I don't normally review things for this site, but I had to here. These are virtually indistinguishable from meat tacos, are much healthier, and any leftover lentils make a fantastic plate of nachos come to life (along with cheese and peppers). These have replaced meat tacos in our house. (Insert superlative here, they all apply!)

These were awesome! I realized while I was making these that I had run out of chili powder, so I added a packet of taco seasoning. I also used vegetable broth, as I was preparing this for vegetarians. They came out fabulous, thanks for great recipe.

We really, really liked these! I think the hard taco shells are key, they pair nicely with the lentil mixture. I used homemade canned salsa which added a lot of great flavor. I will definitely make these again, thank you! :)

These tacos were exceptional!  My husband had no idea what I was making for dinner and he came in while it was simmering and commented that it smelled absolutely delicious.  They tasted even better than they smelled.  He couldn't believe there wasn't any meat in it.  My 2 and 3 1/2 year old daughters gobbled them up as well.  We actually served them on the fry bread from the fry bread taco's recipe that someone else mentioned in their review.  I mixed the lentil mixture with a homemade salsa made with tomatoes, onions, cilantro, garlic salt and chili powder pureed in my blender.  Scooped some on the fry bread, topped with a little cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, avocado and a touch more salsa.  My husband said this is one of his all time favorites.  Next time I make it, I think I'll save some calories by skipping the fry bread, as delicious as it was, and heaping mine on top of a bed of lettuce for a rocking taco salad.  I'm sure these lentil taco's will become a regular meal in our house.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Great idea and recipe!  I made a few changes based on my preferences 1) I used beef buillion instead of chicken to give it more of that ground beef flavor 2) I added slightly more cumin (I love cumin though)until it tasted perfect to me 3) We prefer soft tacos so I used wheat tortillas 4) I used 4 chopped zucchini in addition to the lentils to add a bit more nutrition (and to clear it out of the frig) and you really couldn't even taste them in the mix Overall: A tasty meal that is very satsifying and good for you! Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't come out as I expected.  Very mushy and not very much taste.  Might give it one more try with a lot of variation because I like the idea.

This was quite good. Made it as the recipe instructed and it was too spicy for my 1 and 5 year olds, but my husband and I enjoyed it on nacho chips (no tacos in the house).

Really yummy!  I didn't miss the beef.

Instead of mashing the beans, I put half the mixture in the blender and pulsed it a few times.  Then I mixed the bean mixtures together and added the salsa.

I was skeptical because I'm not a big lentil fan, but this is a great recipe!  My whole family loved it on blue corn taco shells.  I will cut back on the salsa amount next time, to keep the texture a little thicker.

Oh these were good!  I added chili and some coriander (cilantro?) that had to be used up, and think the recipe would still be great without these additions. I can't see myself ever eating a beef taco again.  Many thanks to submitter

This recipe looked so good but I was more in the mood for enchiladas. So I cooked the lentils as was stated in this recipe. I mixed them with a small can of refried beans, 1/4c of taco seasoning, and some water. I then wrapped them up in tortillas and topped with salsa and cheese. What a healthy and fiberfull dinner! Thank you so much for teaching me to cook lentils.

This was delicious. Better than I thought it would be. I added some green chilis to the lentils and I didn't have any cumin, so I used taco seasoning instead. Very good! I will make it again.

I served this recipe to my husband and a family friend, who are both "meat and potato" kind of guys.  They loved it.  I did not mix in the salsa with the lentils, only b/c my kids all have different opinions regarding tomatoes.  This is an excellent recipe!!!

Wow these were sooo good!  The kitchen just smelled better and better as the cooking progressed.  The one tiny change I made was to add some chopped green pepper to saute with the onions because that's what we do with ground beef for tacos too.  We will def be making this alot.

i used red lentils cause that's what i had, i didn't use that much chili powder cuz i thought it would be too hot for my kids.  could use some salt and pepper and was pretty bland.  could've been the lack of all the chili powder... also, used beef broth cuz that's what i had.
i let everyone put their own salsa on.
just ate mine like a bean dip.  kids ate it up!  thanks for sharing, that's awsome!

You know, even with the good reviews, I was skeptical that I would like lentils as a beef substitute... I just polished off a plate of lentil nachos, and I don't feel NEARLY as guilty as when they were swimming in orange grease from ground beef!!! They were satisfying, and although I may not ever eat the lentils right out of the pan, with all the accoutrements, they were delicious. I used fresh garlic, and added some fresh cilantro at the end. I didn't have sour cream so I used a little bit of plain yogurt, a little shred chedd, squeeze of lime and some spicy salsa. PERFECT for a light dinner!!!!

Wow!  These were great!  This is such an affordable meal too.  My husband LOVED them and my sister was over for dinner.  She is VERY picky and she had 2!  I didn't add chicken stock because I didn't have any and they still turned out great.  Will use next time though for more flavor.  Thanks for this healthy, inexpensive, delicious recipe!!

These are surprisingly good.  I serve them as a meatless meal for Lent.  The toppings (light sour cream, lowfat cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, etc) are essential.  Also, I like to serve with fresh avocado.  I am impressed by this healthy recipe, especially as it is original!

I've been making this since I discovered the recipe in a Taste of Home magazine a couple years ago.  My daughter and I don't eat meat, so we loved that we coule have tacos with the rest of the family.  It is wonderful.

This was fabulous. My daughter-in-law had never even considered a vegetarian taco.She's a hamburger girl all the way and she loved it. I'm working on preparing more meatless meals and we eat tacos weekly. I am definitely making this again!

WOW!  I just made these without telling my family they were meatless until after dinner, and no one could believe it wasn't ground beef.  Granted, we don't have tacos very often...  but these were delicious.  I had to cook the lentils about 15-20 minutes longer (if you do this, you may need to add more chicken broth afterward), threw in a packet of beef bullion, substituted adobo for cumin, added cilantro and chives, and used whole wheat tortillas.  I plan on making these again and again, but next time I'll use hard taco shells and add more chili powder and hot pepper.

These *are* as good as people describe.  However, I made the mistake as serving them as part of a "make your own tacos" night--and no one wanted to add lentils to their tacos.  I'd recommend serving your tacos pre-prepared.  I ate leftovers with nachos.

Being new to vegetarianism, I've been trying to find recipes that are both familiar and meat-free. This meets both of those requirements. I cooked the lentils in veg. broth. They needed to be cooked longer than indicated in the recipe. I cooked them for about 40 minutes, but they could have gone a little longer if you like them mushier. Without the sour cream and cheese, I would imagine this is very low fat (and still good!)

Wasn't sure, but it had such great reviews that I had to try.  Boy was I glad I did!  My 7 year old who is soooo picky enjoyed them right out of a bowl, no taco shell included.  I will make again and again.

I liked it, my husband loved it.  I used 1 1/2 cups beef broth and 1 cup chicken.  The beef gave it a nice dark color and my spouse said that he probably wouldn't have known it wasn't meat unless I'd told him ahead of time.

Excellent recipe!  I decreased chili powder (1 1/2 tsp) and cumin (1 tsp) and it had plenty of flavor. My husband is a meat eater, and I am not, so it's always great to find recipes we both enjoy.

I use brown lentils. Also tend to use more garlic than called for. Instant pot: Saute onions and garlic til soft. Add in seasonings and lentils like recipe. Then when you add the broth (I add only 2 cups since it won't cook down), cook on manual pressure for 15 minutes. Natural release for 10. Stir in salsa. Serve!

This is one of our favorite recipes! I use vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian, but other than that follow the recipe. This has replaced beef or chicken tacos in our house because it's so delicious, and even other meat eaters love it.

I guess I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't initially wowed by this recipe. With that being said, I like recipes with flavor and heat! I ended up adding adobo sauce and smoked paprika to the lentils and I really liked the depth and smoky flavor that added. I loved this recipe for how easy it is to prepare and how adaptable it was to my gluten and dairy free diet :) I would recommend this recipe because it's so easy to adapt: diff toppings, diff salsas, diff spices, etc! Try it, you won't miss the meat!

I love this recipe.  Can't believe I waited so long to try it.  I actually made burritos instead of tacos because that's what we prefer.  You will not miss meat in this recipe.  I actually prefer the lentils.  If you haven't tried this recipe, you must.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Michelle.

Amazing! I actually used pre-cooked lentils, which I had on hand. I still sautéed the onion/garlic, added only 1/3 cup chicken broth and the spices as stated.  My husband could smell the lentils from the driveway, he was so happy it was coming from our house. This is a great, tasty, healthy recipe for anyone. My husband and I agree this was way better than ground beef and I'm known for my ground beef tacos. Good bye ground need, hello lentils. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I could eat these EVERY DAY. Although I double up on the spices and add some green olives. Also, sometimes adding a bit of red pepper for heat. Really, whatever I'd do to meat tacos, I experiment on these. My favorite everyday-recipe on AllRecipes.

Our whole family thoroughly enjoyed these tacos. I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth to make it truly vegetarian and that enabled me to serve it to the vegetarian in our family. It is a delicious alternative to meat filled tacos. Thanks so much for sharing.

I love this, very good way to cut down on meat in your diet!!! Can't get my hubby or son to try them :( but that is their loss. On taco night I make beef and chicken for them, I have these and fish. I think mine yaste better and are  defiantly better for you!!!

My husband loved these tacos, and I liked them a lot.  I used whole grain flour tortillas instead of the taco shells. Also, I  had to use more chicken broth than what the recipe calls for.

When my husband first suggested we make these, I was like, "Lentil tacos??? (Yuck)" Fortunately, they are amazing, and generally how we eat tacos now. I add about 1/2 tsp cayenne.

I would allow for twice the amount of cooking time for the lentils to soften.  Also, ours turned out really salty- most likely because I had substituted the chicken broth with chicken bouillon- but that is usually not a problem.  It was tasty, just a bit inconvenient with the cooking time an then the saltiness.

These are so good!  I recently became a vegan and have been trying different recipes.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken (obviously).  My husband (vegetaria) loved them.  He said that they were his favorite thing that I've made since changing to vegan.  One small thing though, this was seriously lacking salt.  With that addition, they were perfect.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time!  I use vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian, but other than that, I follow it to a T.  Fantastic, filling meal that always surprises my omnivore friends with how satisfactorily it replaces meat in tacos (or burritos, or any other Mexican food you like).

This is a family favorite at our house. We make it occasionally for taco night as a change of pace. My 2 year old seems to enjoy it better than beef or chicken.

I'm a meat eater all the way, but these were FANTASTIC!!  I don't ever think about tacos for breakfast (ew!) but let me tell you, I'm craving these right now!
We made it as written but omitting the salsa (didn't need it mixed in, we added it afterwards on top of the tacos), and added avocado.  LOVE these!!

I was worried about everyone saying the lentils were still hard after the advised cook time....so I simmered at a little higher heat than I normally would, making sure not to burn.  I uncovered at 30 mins and cooked another 8 mins (no extra broth was needed).  I was able to mash them and they tasted great...I'm sure they could have been softer, but we would never know.  My hubby liked this, but I couldn't talk my 4 year old into it.  What a fun thing to try, I'm glad I did.

WOW! I'm eating some as I type.  These tacos are even more delicious than original meat tacos, and so much healthier! I don't mix the salsa in with the lentils, but rather put it on top just because personal preference. I do use more liquid than it calls for, so I just keep some water close by to add as needed.  So SO SOOO good!!!!!

A winner! I doubled the recipe. I didn't have chicken stock, so I used water and bouillion. It was a little salty, so next time I'll use one less cube (2 instead of 3.) I didn't have enough salsa, so I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also cut the chili powder in half. I had a lime to use so I juiced that and threw that in as well. Next time I'll be sure to use the salsa. I had to cook this closer to an hour. My son (18) said it was good, but he prefers meat. It would be good with meat, corn or/and black beans added. It was good both on whole wheat soft tortillas and crispy taco shells; the kids (18 & 10) preferred the taco shells. We added lettuce, montery jack cheese, sour cream and taco sauce. A new addition to our rotation. Thanks for a unique, healthy and delicious recipe!

I loved this recipe! Even my hubby loved it - he didn't realize at first that there wasn't meat until I mentioned it. We will definitely make this on a regular basis. As a side note - it took a little longer than 30 minutes for my lentils to get soft, so it took longer for me to prepare this dish than the instructions suggest.

DELICIOUS! I recently made a lentil sloppy joes recipe from allrecipes that turned out really good, and I thought there must be a few for tacos with lentils. This was REALLY good! The flavor is just like tacos. The ONLY qualm i have about this recipe is that it was a bit runny and filling was falling out of hard shells. Next time, i think i'll let it simmer for even longer to thicken more. Thanks for the recipe!

I did not make this exactly as directed, but went with the general idea of using seasoned lentils instead of ground beef. The verdict? Amazing. I discovered that normally, the beef sort of brings out the taco flavor, kind of like salt to chocolate. But with all the other ingredients in my taco, I did not notice much difference. This omitted all the grease from the taco, the flavor and texture were great, and it was much more filling than beef. I will make this again for sure.

We eat these often at our house.  I don't know if I'll go back to regular ground beef tacos now that we've had these.  My little boys love these just as much as my husband and I.  We find this recipe makes enough for a couple nights, and reheats well for the second night!

This was very yummy. Reading through the ingredients list I thought it would be bland but it was a very filling delicious, healthy meal. My fiancée and I ate about half of the lentil filling, so I will be freezing the rest for another meal :) Oh, also I used chopped spring onions (salad/green onions) in the tacos because we always have those in our salad and it really added a kick to the meal!

This is currently my favorite lentil recipe.  I used about half the spices.  I pureed the lentils about half-way with a stick blender and served them as burritos on grilled flour tortillas with my homemade salsa, lettuce, cheese and sour cream.  Left-overs are fabulous as well.

These are some tasty tacos!! A great alternative from eating beef all the time without compromising flavor. A hearty meal, that fulled up a triathlete's stomach!

This taco filling has become an instant favorite in our house. I use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and leave out the garlic due to an allergy. This reminds me of the taco meat my mom made (from an envelope) when I was young so it is not only delicious and easy to make but also comforting.

These tacos were absolutely delicious!  I didn't use lettuce or sour cream for toppings, but added black olives and a mexican cheese mixture, along with the tomatoes and both my husband and I absolutely loved them!  Next time we will add some avocado as we think that will go perfectly.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I made these during our 'vegetarian only' week. The recipe is simple. I used fresh salsa and 'fake' cheese and sour cream from the health food store. I also used vegetable broth. Next time I'll use this for a tostada dish!

This is one of my family's favorite meals. I make it as directed, except add just a touch less chili powder for my kids' tastes. My kids love it with the hard shells. My husband and I make it a wrap with flour tortillas. My husband is a traditional "meat and potatoes" type of guy and he loves this recipe too. My kids always give me a "thanks for making this meal" and " you are the best mom ever"!

Delicious, really! I didn't have any cumin, but that was really the only thing I changed..and the fact that I also had no broth, so I used 2.5cups of water and added a chicken boullion. :) I am a vegetarian, and I really thoroughly enjoyed these! :)  Thanks for the recipe!!

A great dish for anyone who wants to skip the meat but keep all the flavor!  I really did not notice a difference.  The flavor was perfect and it's a quick and easy recipe to make.  I will be adding this to the rotation of meals to make!

I was really excited to try this.  I love the idea of it.  The lentils did not mash up very well for me, even after cooking them longer than the recipe indicated.  Make sure to cook them until they are truly tender and not just moderately tender. They did taste good, but I would have liked them spicier (hotter?)  I will keep this recipe, but tweak it to our tastes.

I really like lentils, but this recipe just didn't quite make it with me.  I prefer pinto beans or black beans in tacos.  The lentils tasted more like black-eyed peas to me.  It made my kitchen smell wonderful!

This is an excellent way meat substitute!  My family loved this and I will definitely make it again.  I'm wondering if I could just use a Taco packet of seasoning instead of the spices.....

I was intrigued by this recipe; so, decided to make it one night last week with some lentils I had left over.  It was delicious!!  The lentils take on the spice flavor and have a nice, meaty texture.  My doubtful husband greatly enjoyed his tacos, and admitted he was surprised by how good they were.  Thanks for this unique recipe.  I have a feeling it will get a regular rotation in our menu!

Very good meat substitute recipe.  SHHH....my dd didn't even know it was not meat.  If I was a vegetarian I would give this 5 stars for sure.  Very economical too!  Thank you for sharing I will make this when my veggie sister comes into town.

This is a great alternative to taco meat, whether or not you've got a vegetarian in the house. I had to cook the lentils about 15 minutes longer than listed in the recipe. After 30 minutes they were still quite soupy. After 45 minutes they had absorbed enough of the water to be a good consistency for tacos. Great flavor!

It really does taste like taco meat.  I made mine a little too salty, but probably my own fault.  Nice change if you don't want to have red meat!

One of the best vegetarian taco recipes I've tried!  My husband and 2 year old ate these up and even asked for seconds.  My son is a very picky eater so that says a lot about the quality of this recipe.  Try it, you won't regret it!

Liked this a lot!  Really easy and good.  My onion was bad so I ended up using dried minced onion..a bunch but not a cup, and cooked the lentils about 15 minutes longer than it said since they weren't mushy yet and used veggie broth to make it vegetarian.  My meat eating husband loved them...I was a little anxious about howt hey would turn out and was pleasantly surprised.  I made guacamole to add to the tacos.  Definately keeping this recipe!  Thanks!

Tasty indeed!  I followed the recipe exactly and served on whole wheat tortillas with cheese, sour cream and lettuce (forgot the tomatoes).  My only recommendation is to decrease the amount of liquid; after cooking for the recommended time, the finished lentil filling was a little runnier than I would have liked.  I think with 2 cups of chicken broth instead of 2 1/2, it would have been great.  But definitely a make-again; thanks for the recipe!  EDIT:  Made it again with 2 cups of broth; this time it was too dry, and the lentils didn't cook through.  So next time I'll try 2 1/4.  Work in progress!  The filling makes fabulous taco salad, by the way.

Way too spicy, but it had good flavor, overall.  Next time I'd reduce the amount of chili powder by half, as well as decrease the cooking time, and add more chicken broth.

I ate three of these myself.  Picky kids I know:  one ate two of them, I was shocked!  Another ate a whole one which was totally unexpected.  My own two children each had two and fought over the last one, deciding one to eat half and give the sibling the other half.  Make this, you will not regret it.  The only thing I found was that I needed to add additional water once in a while, my pan wanted to cook hot, even though I turned it down low.  Enjoy!

I make these tacos all the time! Even non-vegetarians love them. They offer a healthy alternative to meat. One thing that I found that makes these tacos even more legit in the vegetarian world, is replacing the chicken broth with vegetable broth. Just as good, but meat-free!

These were good.  I can't have any dairy right now, so I had to skip the sour cream and cheese, and I think that's what would have made these tacos!  Still, a nice healthy meal that I plan on making again!

This was actually quite good. While the flavor might be closer to 4 stars, the fact that the seasonings are almost perfect in a meat-free meal is worthy of an extra half star, so I rounded it up. They're not better than meat tacos, but they're much better for you. And since lentils are 50 cents a pound, and beef is closer to $4 per pound, well, we'll be having these again :) Though, next time, I might add some green chiles for heat. Thanks for the recipe!

This may be my favorite meal ever!  It was so easy to make.  Used garlic powder instead of fresh.  Doubled the recipe and used only a sprinkle of cumin.  Took advise from others and left out the salsa and put it on the table to be added with all the other toppings.  I will make this again and again!!!

I have made this one many times, and it's now a staple in our house.  I use a little less chili than the recipe states, because it's extremely spicy with the recommended amount, and I'm a wuss when it comes to spices.  Even my picky husband who never likes healthy foods, asks for this regularly.

This was great - doesn't taste like beef, but still pretty good. We are not big on beans, but everyone still enjoyed it. I will make it again, no changes needed (although I did just use the premixed taco seasoning to make life easier).

YUMMY! I used vegetable broth to keep it vegetarian and 505 green chile sauce for the salsa. It tastes like the pork green chile I used to make.

With all the fantastic reviews on this I was really hoping to replace one of our week night staples with a meat-free entree. The lentils were not soft and chewy, and I definitely like making my turkey tacos better!

This was very tasty.  I'm sure we will continue to have tacos made with beef now and again, but these were worth repeating.  My cooking time was longer than stated in teh recipe, but I didn't time it.

Wow! These taste as good or better than actual tacos! I didn't have fresh garlic, so I subbed garlic powder. I used one standard size can of garlic flavored chicken broth, plus one cup of water. I also added a little cayenne, black pepper and paprika. I also added the salsa at the table instead of combining with the mix. Delicious!

This was my 1st time cooking lentils. My family & I are not vegetarians, however, I like to fit in 'meatless' meals from time to time. I was looking for something to do with the lentils other than a soup. This was great! I can not believe how similar the taste of the taco filling is to a meat version. Followed the recipe to a tee, give them a try!

ok - this is probably the best recipe I have.  No meat (good for the environment), low fat (good for the waistline), inexpensive (good for the pocketbook) high protein content.....and my kids (even the picky one!) gobbled it like nobodies business! Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have probably made this a dozen times or so and just keep forgetting to review it. This is a wonderful substitute to a ground beef taco. I actually prefer the texture of the lentils more. I wouldn't change a thing in the lentil mix, the blend of spices is perfect. We do, however, prefer using whole wheat tortillas to the taco shells.

Tried this out on the family...didn't tell them it was meatless.  They though it was ok, but nothing great.  My troops are hard to please, all at once.  My family doesn't like spicy, so I didn't use as much chili powder or cumin.  About 1/2.  I also mixed in a generous portion of sour cream to the lentils when they were ready, so as to cut the spice even more.  Then I spruced it up with some roasted corn and served black beans on the side. We ate it as soft tacos.

We eat very healthy but I also try to find things that our kids will like.  This was a hit!  Very tasty and easy I've made it several times without changes to this recipe.  If you are trying to cut fat and increase fiber etc. but have some picky eaters you should try this!

I was skeptical with trying Lentils but also wanted a healthy alternative to using the traditional ground beef for tacos.  However, the reviews for this recipe made me try it and....I loved it!  The flavors were great, I didn't think it tasted like beef but that didn't matter cause it tasted good and I didn't feel guilty for eating it.  I left out the sour cream and used taco sauce instead...delish!

Wow. This is such a great idea! I was looking for a way to use the lentil beans I had bought and never cooked and decided to try this. My picky one year old loved them and my pickier husband did too! I was really impressed at how easy it was too. I highly recommend trying this recipe out.

Cooking time was a little over what was suggested.  I served these tacos to a complete meat eater when it comes to Tacos and he loved them!  The texture is meat-ish and the seasoning is fantastic!

The seasonings in this dish were pretty good (I added a little salt), but I had to cook it for almost twice the time and the lentils were still a bit crunchy. I think it took away some of the flavor. Overall, this makes a decent burrito filling and is a good way to get in a healthy meal. I'll try it again when I have more time on my hands and rerate it if it cooks up quicker.

Made as written, these were a total hit! The whole family decided these are better than 'real' tacos. We used soft shells and hard shells. Next time I will make a much bigger batch. So healthy and so inexpensive - Thank you!

Great recipe if you love Mexican food like me, but are trying to cut some fat out of your diet!  I was looking for a recipe that used lentils because they are good for you, and realized that I could make an entire fat-free or low-fat meal out of this!  Only problem (probably my fault), my liquid dried up in only 15 minutes, leaving the lentils al dente, but I added more broth and kept cooking.  Next time will simmer on super-low heat.  Thanks!

In efforts to become more healthly, I've been experimenting with beans. These lentil tacos were amazing. I used a whole grain lo-carb tortilla instead of taco shells (which are fried), and fat free cheddar cheese. I served them with fat free refried beans and whole grain rice. They meal was awesome and even though I cut the recipe in half for my husband and I, there was plenty to eat!!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Yummy!!!  Told my meat loving husband we were having "tacos".  After he ate and LOVED them, I let him know it was lentils.  This recipe is easy to make, tasty, healthier than regular tacos, and inexpensive!  It's a keeper!

This is so good.  I used to replace the meat with red beans, but I won't anymore.  I had never cooked with lentils before, either.  I didn't tell the kids what it was until after they had eaten it and everyone cleaned their plates.  I did decrease the amount of cumin, but that is just a personal preference.  Yum!

This was very good- I had never used lentils before. The only thing was I don't think I cooked them quite long enough, so the texture was a little off- but overall a healthy and tasty replacement. Thanks for the recipe!

I was shocked at just how good this was!  Never enjoyed lentils prior to this experience.  Even my 2 1/2 year old enjoyed it..a RARE thing in itself!  Nice healthy alternative to ground beef.

I liked these a lot. I might play around with the spices next time a bit as I think it could have used a bit more, but I will def make these again. Cheap, filling and easy. I has these in whole wheat tortillas and used soy cheese on top

These were so good that my husband didn't even know it wasn't beef.  Definitely stick with dried lentils.  The ones from the can make this recipe a bit too salty for my taste, even after rinsing the lentils really well.

This recipe is absolutely awesome!  You really don't miss the ground beef at all.  With this dish, all of the spices are allowed to shine through instead of being overpowered by the usual hamburger.  The only change I made was to add a little taco seasoning mix to the end product(just to taste).    This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks, Michelle, for submitting a wonderful recipe!

This was a tasty way to incorporate lentils into a meal.  I effectively used them as a fajita filling using wraps nd trimmings as suggested by other reviewers.  I will be making this again.

I used beef broth instead of the chicken and they tuned out wonderfully. Mine were kind of runny so I drained the extra liquid. Couldn't tell they weren't meat. A new favorite.

This is amazing!  I made this filling as a vegetarian option for a taco dinner party.  This filling was way more popular than the beef or shredded chicken!  Tonight it's tacos just for us, and we are not bothering with the meat - lentils all the way.
Just an update to my review to add that this recipe has become almost a weekly staple in our house.  We've been doubling the recipe and using leftovers in taco salads, quesedillas, nachos, etc.  Soo good!

These were good. I spread some guacamole on the inside of the shell and omitted the sour cream. I did not think (as others have written in their reviews) you wouldn't be able to tell it's not beef if you weren't told...

I made these last night and just thinking about them makes my mouth water.  The people who ate them not knowing they weren't beef didn't notice.  These tacos are much healthier than beef tacos, and taste just as good.  The leftovers can easily make nachos!  The only thing I altered was adding salt and only 1/2 cup of salsa.

These were excellent! If you weren't thinking about it and took a bite, you'd think they were normal ground beef tacos! They tasted the same. These are great for a budget too! I had some left over lentil filling because we ran out of taco shells and I just ate them plain. YUM!

The kids liked these a lot, which is always good. They said they liked the "meat" and I wasn't about to tell them differently. My husband had a little bit of a hard time getting used to it. But he did. Very good thanks!

These were surprisingly really good. I agree with others, the crunchy shells is a must! I also mixed in a cup of veggie crumbles I had left over. It added some extra texture.

I omitted the salsa to the mixture because it was pretty wet already. I spooned some salsa onton the taco's themselves. Will definitely make again.

Wow!  Filling & delish!  My husband, skeptical of all things that don't contain "meat", loved them. Had to cook the lentils a little longer...and use a slotted spoon so it wouldn't be soupy.

The basic recipe is good, and I will probably make it again. But, I'll have to increase the spices a lot next time. It was a little bland for my tastes. I made them as written and served with Best Black Beans from this site.

The basic recipe is good but I found I had to add a lot more spices to get it to a flavor I liked. I think this would be much better suited toward a burrito. But it's good in a pinch when you have a taco craving and lots of leftover packaged shells but no ground beef.

Can we say "Fabulous!" My hubbie has hard core meat cravings, and I've been doing a lot of meat replacements lately. He still loved this-- even though he usually doesn't like chili seasoned foods-- it was packed with flavor! Yum!

Update* - I noticed a lot of people having issues with the cooking time or texture of the lentils - another reviewer pointed out that you may have "old" lentils - but also, consider cooking lentils like cooking rice - you can't expect an exact figure every time, more like a guideline - and when in doubt, just cook 'til done.  IMO, it's just not cool to take off a star for what should be covered under basic cooking common sense.*  Followed exactly (*oops, almost - subbed out a mixture of canned beef consomme & water for chicken broth) & loved every bite!  But I expected to. What I didn't expect was my kids & husband to like them as much as I.  In particular, I should mention that my husband is a dedicated carnivore, and one of my kids "HATES beans" (she doesn't like the texture), so I was afraid these would be a hard sell.  I made them with the frybread from Fry Bread Tacos II and HIGHLY recommend these together.

A great vegetarian meal. I make these regularly. We also use the lentils to top lettuce (we like spinach) and then we include the other ingredients for a taco salad. Tasty and healthy!

I enjoyed the fact that I was eating lentils but I don't think I'll make this recipe a standby. I'll try halving the cumin next time, and perhaps use a different type of lentils.

I was not the biggest fan of this recipe, but on the other hand my husband loved it.  I think one of my issues was that the lentils took forever to become tender, and I didn't add any salt as I had been warned that it can make bean take much longer to cook.  They still seemed too firm for me and I was not able to mash them slightly as suggested. I also did not particularly car for the seasoning on the lentils and wished that I had used a prepackaged taco seasoning mix instead. I found a different recipe through epicurious.com and will probably try that one next time instead of making this one again.

Like most everyone else, I was really skeptical about this. I kept having to "psyche" myself up that this is good for you. I used a little bit of taco seasoning along with the seasonings called for. I was able to get pre-cooked lentils from Trader Joe's which was nice..and we were not disappointed. These were really good! My fiance said he wants to never go back to eating ground beef tacos again. They kind of taste like beans and beef are mixed together. Yum..I think I want some right now! Thanks for sharing such a great, healthy recipe.

This is the first recipe I've reviewed, and I had to submit this because these tacos were AMAZING! I am a vegetarian and don't like any 'fake' meat products. I love lentils and this is a delicious way to use them. I added onion powder instead of diced onion and used low sodium vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. After about 25 minutes of simmering, I added sea salt and about a tablespoon of taco seasonings because it tasted a little bland. I then splashed in a little more broth and cooked uncovered for 10 more minutes. The end result was perfection!! I topped them with lettuce, tomato, 2% Mexican blend cheese, and a sauce I always use on my quesadillas/burritos: Nonfat plain yogurt + Fiesta Ranch dip mix (about 1 Tsp dip mix and 1/2 cup yogurt)....I plan to make taco salad tomorrow with the leftovers, and then make more to freeze. DELICIOUS!!!

Tasty recipe, although the lentil mix is not at all comparable to ground beef.  Reminded me more of refried beans, but was still good.  I did have to cook the beans about 10 minutes longer than instructed.  Tried to use the mixture on a few quesadillas, but I wouldn't recommend that.

I think these are delicious, and everyone I've served them to does as well.  I do cook them a little bit longer than suggested, but it could be my stove/pan.  I've made them three times now, and haven't put in the salsa at the end, and they're still delicious.  I think the toppings you put in the taco are key- chopped onion and cilantro, cheese, lettuce, sour cream, guac, and some hot sauce if you like.  Delicious!  I used white corn taco shells.

Really good--followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it, and it was great. It's become a regular dinner for us, but after the first time I tried it with water instead of broth & a packet of taco seasoning mix instead of the spices--works just as well!

I am a taco addict.  I am also trying to incorporate healtier choices into my diet.  What could be better than lentil taco filling, then?  Answer: ground beef :).  Or chicken.  Or turkey.  While not quite as yummy as I was hoping - the taco filling was by no means unedible. With a little experimentation with spices, it might even be delicious.    It ended up working best as part of a taco salad, instead of in a shell.

We are not vegetarians but I do try to use proteins instead of meat to lower cost. I was very delighted to find this recipe and I was not disappointed. While it doesn't really look like hamburger or taste exactly like it it was delicious! Even my hubby who loves meat raved about these. Give them a try! I made no substitutions except chick bullion and water instead of chicken broth.

this really deserves the five star rating, the first lentil recipe I've ever cooked and so delicious. I soaked the lentils for about an entire day, so they didnt need to cook for 25 minutes. I added all the broth the recipe called for, so I just left the pan uncovered so the broth could cook out. As it was cooking out I mushed the mixture up. Yum!

Wow. We tried this recipe because we needed a cheap meal, and the whole family loved it. We were actually surprised how delicious it was. If you're hesitant or your kids are picky like mine, try mixing in some cooked ground beef before you serve it. My kids thought it was great.

This was awesome! I used the lentils in quesadillas and they were delicious! We will definitely be using this instead of beef from now on. They make great nachos too! The only changes I made were that I did not have any salsa on hand and so I omitted it, but it really didn't affect the flavor in any way.

I was looking for a great meat alternative and this was a fantastic equal! It's very simple and quick to prepare, too!

I do think I may cut down the chili powder a little, but overall... fantastic. :)

Great recipe!  I had to add more liquid than the recipe states (and used beef broth as others suggested) and cooked the lentils a few minutes longer than called for.  Otherwise, it was great; my meat-eating husband gave his approval and everything!

I used puy lentils (french green),they were not fully cooked after 30 minutes of simmering, had to add more broth.  Just add a little at a time until the were soft.  Really good tasting and budget wise recipe.  Will use from now for our weekly taco night.

I can't believe how great these are! I didn't make any changes except how I served them, by making a taco salad with it in a baked tortilla bowl.  I also added refried black beans to the toppings. Excellent. Reheats nicely too. Will be making again and again.

Although I definately prefer the taste of classic pinto beans in tacos, this works well in our country where you can't get most Mexican ingredients, including pinto beans. Thanks for sharing the idea.

This recipe definitely deserves all the five star reviews! These were fantastic, and I didn't miss the meat at all. With the seasonings it tasted exactly like taco ground beef. Not only is this much healthier than beef, it is also cheaper! The only issue I had was that it took a lot longer than 8 minutes for the mixture to thicken, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I wouldn't change a thing!

An excellent recipe when you are trying to eat healthy.  Very good as Tacos, also very good as the "meat" for a Taco salad.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing Michelle.

AMAZING!!! I will never go back to ground beef tacos! Tastes even better, healthier and cheaper!!! I used fat free sour cream and made some quacamole from this website as well and it was so yummy!  Give this recipe a try and I am sure you will love it! My husband needs to have meat in every meal yet he agreed as well that it tasted just as good!

We really enjoyed these!  They are hearty, flavorful, and healthy.  My 10yo son liked these but still prefers the other way we make tacos; one of our daughters thought it was a bit too spicy for her tame mouth.  The rest of us, though, thought it was one of the best new recipes we've tried in a while.  It's difficult to find recipes I'd serve to our meat-eating guests, but this would be one.

These were okay.  I found that they took longer to cook than the recipe called for.  All in all, the recipe was good, but I would prefer using Morning Star crumbles to make meatless tacos.

I thought this turned out pretty good.  My bestfriend and her husband both liked it.  I had WAY too many leftovers, however.  Next time, I'd definitely cut the recipe in half.

These are really excellent!  I had some vegan nachos, my boyfriend (non-veg) at this with taco shells, as a burrito and over a baked potato.  The flavor really is great, it is easy and incredibly inexpensive!  It will be a staple in my house from now on :)

i love this! i had never eaten (or made, for that matter) lentils at all before i saw this recipe, but i'm always looking for creative new (healthy) recipies, and i'm glad i tried this. these had a great flavor, just serve with all your favorite taco condiments. any meat-eater would eat this, in my opinion. i froze the leftovers - just as good a few weeks later!

My non-vegetarian fiance absolutely loved this recipe.  It's the first non-meat recipe he's enthusiastically requested.  I actually slightly undercooked the lentils in order to make the consistency more like ground beef.

These were too good! I am a vegetarian and I like tacos but they were getting boring using the Boca meat. These tacos were excellent, healthy, and I will only be using this method of making tacos in the future! A nice alternative to soy.

delish!  I used this to make a taco salad.  I only used 2 cups of chicken broth and also added a can of drained and rinsed black beans for more texture.  while I don't think this would fool a usual meat eater, it is very yummy for those embracing the occasional meatless dish!  also a good use for lentils taking up space in the pantry ;)  thanks for sharing!

I was very skeptical about this recipes, being new to lentils, however I must say myself and my family (4 of my 5 children)loved it. It doesn't taste like meat but it's still pretty good. take the plunge and try it;-)

My "meat and potatoes" husband couldn't believe these were so good! I make these now at least once a month, and am experimenting with turning them into Burritos as recommended by some other reviewers. Fantastic recipe!

Brilliant, delicious, and so easy! I used veg broth and added some garlic scapes from the CSA. This is so much better, taste-wise and health-wise, than any processed-soy meat substitute.

Very good.  I used this as nacho topping layering the lentils, salsa, and shredded cheese.  I would make this again.

Top marks for this recipe.  I must admit I was skeptical about making this recipe and so was my husband (he kept joking he had the pizza place on standby!) but we needn't have worried.  Very yummy served in soft wraps.  I wouldn't go as far as saying it was just like a beef taco but it's a good alternative.  I had some salad and lentils left over so I had them as a salad the next day.  This makes a great taco salad too.  Will be using this recipe again and again for sure.

If I could rate this recipe 10 stars I would! This is one of the best taco's we had ever eaten!!  We did not miss the ground beef at all.  Knowing that it is a healthy meal makes it even better!  My husband, who is a meat and potato guy, said he never needs to eat another beef taco ever again after one bite.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  We will add this as a staple to our mexican meal nights!!

My family loves this recipe.  I have also used lentils with taco seasoning in many other recipes.  Thanks for the great use of lentils.  My husband and 3 yr old always clean their plates. A+++

This was a surprisingly good dish.  My girlfriend and I liked as good as meat tacos and it's way cheaper than meat to boot.  Cheap, tasty and a super-food!  This is becoming a regular recipe in our house.

Amazing!! Once of the best meals I have ever eaten. I made a few minor changes based on personal preference - more garlic and onion, used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and used canned lentils to save time. Turned out great, and will definitely make again!

Tasty tacos!  My mom just made these and they were pretty good.  We didn't think they really tasted like meat but they were good!  UPDATE 5 STARS: We made these again and used the whole 1lb bag of lentils.  We just boiled them in water until they got tender and most of the water evaporated, then added 2Tbsp of chili powder, 2 tsp oregano, salt, pepper and 1 packet of taco seasoning mix.  We served them with cheese and guacamole and they were excellent!!

I thought these were really good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except we made them into tostadas instead of tacos.  I will say that I dont think its a substitute for meat, but definatly very different and yummy for a lentil lover like myself.  Thanks!

This is a first-time try, and it seemed to go over without much problems, although my 6 yr old knew there was "something" different.  Still, she ate it, and I will try this again.  The more I make it familiar the better she is!  I tasted it and it was awesome!!!  :)

I was shocked that I didn't need to alter the spices or anything in the lentil mixture since oregano & cumin sounded like a weird couple to me. I just added salt when I was mashing the garlic...didn't need it really cuz the chicken broth has enough salt. I didn't have sour cream or lettuce so I just scooped the lentil/salsa mixture in shells, topped w/ cheddar cheese & diced tomatoes. Amazing! Can't wait to eat it for lunch today.

Very tasty.  I made these as burritos.  I mashed them with the back of a fork. However, I didn't make them mush so they still had some texture.  Homemade spanish rice and guacamole rounded out this feast.  Lentils are a super-food and a great alternative to meat.

I am in the process of switching to a completely vegan diet, and my fiance was reluctantly joining me...until we tried this recipe!  He was SO excited, and said it tasted better than "regular" tacos.  I agree, and look forward to experimenting more.

YUMMY!!  I used a can of lentils, drained and rinsed, and simmered them with about 3/4 c beef broth.  The recipe was really good, my only other adjustment was to add a sprinkle of chipotle chili pepper (my new favourite addition to almost everything!!)  I served this alongside the traditional beef for tacos, we decided that our favourite was a scoop of each (even better that way than the beef alone!)  This will accompany our beef filling (maybe even try mixing it in the same pan and cooking it together??) everytime we have tacos.  Thanks for another great recipe!!

These were surprisingly good! Even my meat loving son and husband thought so.  I did switch out the chicken broth with vegetable broth to make them vegetarian and next time I will be heavy handed with some spices to zip it up a bit...we like it zippy!

Great recipe! My husband didn't realize he was eating lentils. He wasn't confused enough to think it was meat, but he was shocked he liked it. I needed more stock because mine dried out while cooking. I also couldn't really get them to mash, after 35 minutes. Still, they were tasty!

This recipes is fantastic! If I could give it more stars I would.  I was a bit apprehensive about making it just because I thought it might be a bit bland and disappointing.  But I'm so happy that I did try this recipe because it has become my favorite.  The taste is amazing and even my fiance and 5 year old son loved it.

REALLY great!  I love this!  One thing I have really missed as a vegetarian is tacos, I substitute pinto or refried beans usually but this was so much better!  The flavor is great and I love how healthy this is.  I used veggie broth and also had to cook the lentils longer to make them soft enough.  But it was perfect and a new family favorite!  Thanks for a great idea and wonderful recipe!

My two young children really liked these. A bit more time intensive than beef/chicken tacos, but super healthy. I used leftover cooked lentils and served with whole wheat tortilla shells; they turned out great.

You don't even notice the meat isn't there!

We love our foods super spicy, so I added a whole chopped jalepeno with the onion. What a kick! A new favorite we'll be making again, for sure.

These are really good considering they are made with lentils.  I too used beef broth instead of chicken.  I also halved the cumin and chili powder as the kids were eating it.

This recipe is great - I've made it twice, first with the full amount of lentils and again, with 1/2 lentils and a can of black beans.  My husband preferred the lentil/black bean mixture, but I thought they were both great!

I was really looking for a taco recipe using ground turkey, but this recipe sounded so good, I decided to make it and add the ground turkey to it.  I cooked the turkey with the onions, then continued to follow the directions.  We loved it!  The seasonings are perfect!
