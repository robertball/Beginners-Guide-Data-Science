This is sooo simple, yet sooo good!!  I made this for my MIL's birthday and used cherry pie filling and sliced and slivered almonds for the nuts.  I also had some fresh pineapple that needed to be used, so I diced it and added it to the cherry pie filling; it really worked well and added a nice juicy pop.  I used funfetti cake mix, since it was a birthday, and did need to bake a bit longer (about 35-40 minutes).  It was really good; we all had multiple servings (except Mr. LTH, but he's weird).  This will be a staple, particularly for last minute desserts since all of the ingredients are staples and it can be thrown together so quickly.  THANKS for the recipe!
