We tried Cha cha's and Carols White Chicken Chili and they are both great! My husband is nuts about this soup!! We don't add jalapeno because of the little ones. You can adjust the chili's and other seasonings to suit your own taste. We did like to add a tsp. of sour cream, salsa and sprinkle with shredded Monterray Jack or cheddar cheese for presentation. (using hot salsa would give those who need the extra bite what they want too)!

I love this recipe.  I use 3 TBL fresh garlic, 3 tsp cumin, navy beans and fresh herbs if available.  I also add parsely, fresh or flakes.  We skip the cheese.  Cook for 40 minutes, and if it's too thin, mix 2 TBL flour with 1/2 cup white wine together, and stir in, cooking 5 minutes more.  Wonderful!

After reading the reviews and a few other white chili recipes, I chose this one, cut up the chix, added more spices as it cooked and I tasted. It was very good and even better the next day. Had the green chili flavor, which is more delicate than red chili. There is a difference in flavor to excpect when focusing on green peppers.
will definately make again!

This is a wonderful dinner, easy and fast, I prefer to buy my own green chiles and slice them.  My whole family loves this, I NEVER have leftovers, even when I make a double batch!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I ground up 2 pounds of chicken breast meat rather than chopping it, browning it with the onions, then tossing in fresh chili peppers.  I also substituted garlic salt for the garlic powder.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly as written, and it turned out very well.  I had no idea what cannellini beans were, but turns out they are white kidney beans.  They taste just like the regular red ones we're all used to.  We'll be making this again, it's definitely a keeper.

Definitely needed to spice this up a bit. I actually like things a little on the tame side and after the first bowl, I added more cumin and garlic, salt and pepper. Leftovers the day after had a nice flavor. Quick and easy, I will probably make this again, but will experiment with my own add-ins and spices.

I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and some white hominy to this.  This is a nice comforting chili to eat on a cold fall day.  I've also used leftover chicken from a rotisserie store bought chicken to speed up the prep time.  Thanks Carol

This was yummy! The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that a few changes were made. We made it with boneless chicken thighs (that's what we had) and we used more broth and beans. It says that it makes 6 servings, but in order to feed the 3 of us, we needed to increase those two ingredients. To thicken it a little, my husband added a little cornstarch at the end. My 11yr. old daughter thought this was great. I will definately make this again.

It needed more spice than what is in this recipe. Otherwise it was pretty tastey.

I threw this in the slow cooker before leaving for trick or treating so we could come home to a nice pot of chili!!! This was very good, I used cooked shredded chicken so it didn't take as long to cook. I did rinse and drain my beans and added some frozen corn. Lovely!

This is fabulous! My 8 year old son tasted it before I served it and said it needed to be spicier so I added a bit more spices (the way I like it, too!)! I did cube the chicken which made it easier! But the recipe was great! Great alternative to beef (or just bean) chili! *****

Very good-I used fresh garlic instead of the powder, fresh cilantro instead of dried and fresh serrano chiles in addition to the canned. Next time I'll add a bit extra to give it an extra kick. easy and delicious!

My green chili pepper was really really hot so the whole thing turned out way too spicy for me.  But aside from that, it was really tasty.  Will definitely cut down the amount of chili next time.

Good overall recipe, but the seasoning amounts are off for our tastes. After doubling all of the seasonings and the chiles it was perfect. Loved this recipe for dinner this week!

It's curious that several people thought this was more like soup, cause I *doubled* the broth and it was still plenty thick.  So I don't get it.  I also doubled all the spices and thought it was still semi-boring but at least OK.  I like chicken/white chili and have made many, and this is probably the least interesting one I've had.  And no, it doesn't taste like Cha Cha's - that's probably one of the best I've had on here and this isn't like it.   Cannellini beans don't taste like red kidney beans.

A tasty white chili. I thought it was a bit bland, and ended up doubling all the spices and adding some canned chopped tomatoes. Served with it cornbread, sour cream and other taco condiments for an enjoyable dinner. It was very quick, so I will make this again, with my adjustments.

This is a five at least the way I made it. Instead of diced chicken, I wanted shredded. So I took 2-3 garlic cloves and crushed them and with the onion and olive oil heated them. Then I added the chicken broth. I submerged 3 chicken breasts in the liquid and boiled them until cooked. I removed the breasts and shredded with two forks. Then I used one can of beans, a can of chilis, and the seasonings and mashed them with a fork. and then added this to the broth to thicken it. I addded 1 and a half cups of frozen corn and added the shredded chicken and about 2/3 cup of shredded cheese. Once everything had incorporated i added almost another full can of beans (not mashed). It seems a little too much like soup so I added some cornstarch until it reached the desired consistency (careful not to add too much too fast). The BF said it tasted like chicken corm sooup and so he just salt and peppered it while I added a small dollop of light sour cream and some fresh cilantro and tabasco sauce. I didn't have any green onions so those were omitted. EXCELLENT!

This is a wonderful red chili alternative.  I added two cans of green chiles instead of one, for a more Southwestern flavor.

I thought this had a great flavor and wasn't too spicey for my 4 kids. I used a rotisserie chicken and it added a nice flavor. However, I doubled the chicken broth to make it more like soup. I will make again!

Very good.  I didn't have a can of green chile peppers so I used a teaspoon of chili powder instead.  I also put in 1/4 tsp of lemon pepper instead of the crushed red pepper.  Even my 3 year old asked for leftovers today.  That says a lot!

I knew this recipe would turn out well as soon as I started smelling all the spices mix together. Although I used soy 'chicken' and needed more chicken bullion to add flavor. I also used white beans that had been in 'tomato' sauce, and drained most of the sauce before adding them. The one thing I forgot to add, even though I had them, was the green chili. That would have added a nice kick! I also used mozzarella for the cheese because that's what I had. Great over rice!

Sooo good.  I substituted what I had on hand - salsa verde for the chopped green chilis and pinto beans for the canellini beans.  My entire family loved it!  I left out the crushed red pepper flakes for the sake of the younger children.  We will definitely make this again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband, who never eats leftover, had two bowls the next night.  Next time I make it though, I will start with chicken strips or cubes instead of the whole breast.  Great flavor.

This was pretty good but bland.  That's the problem with the whole white chili premise, we realized.  Adding some corn and potatoes would help if you wanted to keep with the color theme.  Otherwise, tomatoes, green beans, celery, broccoli, any of these would add what it needed.

My husband requested it but I had my doubts! It looks quite bland, but it is wonderful!  So simple and quick to fix!  My kids LOVED it and ask for it weekly now! They like it now more than beef chili.

Wonderfully tasty and simple to put together.  

I cooked my chicken on my Geo Forman grill, so the cooking process was fast.  I then cubed and sauteed the chicken quickly with a bit of chicken broth and the spices that are listed.  I kept my chicken separate and added to each serving as I'm on WW and like the ability to know exactly how much chicken in each serving - for points calculation.

This recipe will be made often in the cold months :)

My family loved the chili. Even my 3 year grandson, who is a picky eater, ate 2 bowls of Chili. However I did add 1/4 tsp of red peppers and a 6oz can of green chili.  I served the Chili with sour cream, Montery jack cheese and warm tortillas

I personally did not care for this, but my husband and son loved it. Since it wasn't spicy, my tender-stomached two year old both loved it and tolerated it well. My husband enjoyed it too, and he spiced his up with extra red pepper. I think it would have been much better with ground chicken, not chicken pieces. I also think it was way too bland. I followed the recipe exactly this time, except I used a tablespoon of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. It was really easy to prepare and I served it with flour tortillas for dipping and corn on the side.  Thanks for sharing, and since my family enjoyed it so much, I will probably make this again.

Pretty darn good.  I even forgot to add the cumin, and it still turned out great.  I added only four chicken breasts (maybe mine were just larger) and used Great Northern Beans instead of cannellini beans (couldn't find them in my supermarket!).  I also added twice as much red pepper - it still wasn't spicy (maybe because of no cumin?); I may add more next time.  Despite that, I'd call this a yummy meal all around!

This is really good. I mixed 2 TBL flour with 1/2 cup white wine together,and it still seemed like there was to much liquid so I add some better than bouillion and water then added alittle more flour and it thicken it up the way I wanted it.
I also  I wanted shredded. So I took 2-3 garlic cloves and  the onion and olive oil heated them. Then I added the chicken broth. I submerged 3 chicken breasts in the liquid and boiled them until cooked. I removed the breasts and shredded with two forks. I used 2 cans of the green chili peppers & seasoning and corn and mixed it together and added it to the broth then the 2 can of beans. I also added additional hot sauce-just because we like spicy food.

Excellent! I have been making this recipe for twelve years. It is the first thing I make when the weather gets cold. It is the most unassuming recipe because the ingredients are so simple. Today, for the first time, I added fresh corn because I had it. It was delicious but honestly, this recipe is good just as it is. The flavor is bold and comforting and even better the next day!

Yum! Very tasty, nice and spicy. I change the ingredients around sometimes though--I like it with black beans instead of cannelini. It makes it a grey chili, but it's still very good. Cornbread is a great accompaniment.

What a great tasting and simple recipe.  I made this recipe but added a can of corn and it was so delish.  

This dish freezes perfectly.  I served this with dinner biscuits and it was fantastic.

I am going to make this recipe for a party and serve it in bread bowls.  

It is a fabulous recipe that I have forwarded to friends and family.

Wow this Chili kicked my you know what!  It's all good I went 12 rounds with this bad boy!  It was amazing with some chilled Chardonnay.  It really took the sting off but made you go in for more!.  My mother and sister gave me a 9 and a A- because of the hottness level.  I'm in  the southwest and I know some real Chili eaters would have thought it was mild, hahaha :-D!!!!  Good and Hardy!!!!

This is an awesome way to use up leftover chicken. I upped the spices a lot, but kept the proportions the same (we like spice--it may have been too brave for others). If you are lazy like me and don't rinse your beans, DO NOT ADD SALT. Make a double batch, because this tastes even better the next day.

I have been looking for a chicken chili recipe and have been very disappointed until now. This recipe had a ton of flavor for not cooking all day. I did use fresh garlic which I sauteed with the onion and chicken, and also used fresh cilantro. Will definitely be making often as its healthy, quick and tasty.

Had this tonight for dinner! Yum! I doubled the spices as a lot of people suggested. I put in 1 teaspoon of the crushed red pepper cuz we like it hot! I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and 8 oz of fresh mushrooms. Great "warming meal" without being too heavy. You will like it!

I'm not a big fan of healthy cooking, but this was great!  My husband and I loved it.  I used ground cayenne pepper instead of crushed, and might add a little more next time to make it spicier.  It was quick, easy, and healthy.  My kind of meal!!

This was pretty good. I made it in my crock pot. Definately more of a soup than a chili. Next time I might add a can of cream of mushroom soup to make it thicker.

I started out making it exactly to the recipe except for only using 3 breasts. 1. Used a total of 32 oz. of chicken broth to get it even to chili/soup consistency.
2. Doubled the green chilis because it was so bland. 
3.  Added extra seasonings to balance the increase in broth. This was not spicy AT ALL and it was not spicy.
4. Am on my second hour of cooking or it would have been just bland water flavored chicken and beans with very little broth. Could probably be good after a nice 3-4 hour simmer but I have been tasting as I go and it is not too bad. This is a good basic starter recipe but I would use a whole onion next time. 
5. Will probably need to add sour cream to the chili to get a nice consistency if the cheese doesn't do it. 

Sorry to be critical Carol but do appreciate you submitting it.

Super easy, it's a keeper. I used a rotisserie chicken, and used a can of white butter beans   with a can of the beans in the recipe.

THis recipe is very good..To make it creamier try adding a can of condensed cream of chicken soup along with the other ingredients..and dont rinse your beans.Easy,quick,go to meal...all day slow cooker or just an added bowl of warmth for your taco/burrito fiesta..any way, you cant go wrong.

Made this tonight and it was good - my husband and five year old loved it!  Followed recipe exactly exept I used one pound ground chicken (because it's what I had on hand) instead of the chicken breasts.  I will absolutely make this again...only change I might make next time is to add a little more chicken broth.

This recipe was very good. The only thing I would have done differently is shredded the chicken. I think it would have given a more appealing texture. The flavor was very good and was enjoyed by everyone.

This is WONDERFUL!!!  The hardest part is dicing the chicken, as others have noted.  I also had some trouble using a very well known “off brand” of peppers because they did not carry anything else. The peppers had so many stems in them. I told a friend that the recipe was wonderful after I got the logs out!  I doubled and it was delicious. I would not hesitate to triple this recipe and serve to company with cornbread, ice tea and a good dessert.

I have made this dish a few times and it comes out fantastic each time. I may alter it a little by adding a small can of salsa verde. I serve it in a bowl with cheese, sour cream or avocado on top. I also serve some tortilla chips on the side as well. Give it a try!

The whole family loved it.  My kids and husband say they don't like onions or green chiles, but  together in this chili, they loved it.  Perfect mix of spices and ingredients.  Easy to make for me, (from a person who hates to cook!)

I used chicken tenderloin, was fairly heavy handed with the spices- especially the cumin, and used fresh cilantro in the soup and as a garnish. Turned out awesome!  My family ate it up.

Thought this chili was delicious. The only change I made was to puree about 1/2 cup of the cannellini beans to make the chili thicker the way my fiance and I prefer chili. It was really good will definitely make again.

I made it! With a few changes but it still came out great". I use butter beans instead, I saute  some carrots, potatoes, onions, then the chicken and one garlic clove. I added some white pepper, garlic power, poultry seasoning, ground turmeric, and just a pinch  of sage. Remember this is all according to your taste. I added 1 1/2 cup of water to the chicken broth, and cook as directed it should come very good. I'm ready to eat the whole pot. Good luck.

I am always looking for recipes that do not used cooked tomatoes. This is especially true for foods that are usually made with the tomatoes. (I have stomach problems!) I love this recipe & look forward to trying it. I will made modifications (I don't like so much spice), but this is a great "starting point".
