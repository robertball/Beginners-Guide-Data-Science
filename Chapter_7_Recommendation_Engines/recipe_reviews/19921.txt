Very Good!!  I just halved the zucchini lengthwise, and added some salt and pepper after grilling.  Cutting it the long way really saved on time, plus made it easier to move on and off the grill.  Thanks!

It's simple, fast and gives the squash a good flavor.  I pan fried instead of grilled and it works just as well.

The first time I tried this I added a little Parmesean and it was fantastic! I have a vegetable basket for the barbeque grill which made it easy to flip them. Plus, it makes the taste amazing! The second time I tried this, I added too much dressing and it overpowered the zucchini, so be careful on your proportions. A favorite in my home!

We make this by cutting the Zucchini into spears and letting it marinate in a Italian dressing bath for 3 days, yes 3 days! It sounds ridiculous but it makes the Zucchini much better and zingy, while the grill marks add a caramelized type of sweetness. I wasn't a fan of Zucchini until I had it like that! Really good for low carbers.

YUM-YUM!  At my local farmers market, I found what they call an 8-ball....no, not that kinda 8-ball...It is a zucchini that they said "has gone wild".  It looks like a small pumpkin, meaning it is round, which made for perfect larger slices to grill!  This is a simple side that is sure to please, as Linda put it, what's not to like about it??  Thanks Nancy!

5 stars for flavor and easiness.  I sliced my zucchini in spears (they looked like pickles), and after bringing them inside, I topped them with some grated parmesan cheese while still hot.  The parmesan on top is a wonderful addition!

I don't usually care for Italian dressing, but I love Zucchini so I thought that I'd give it a try. Boy, am I ever glad that I did. 
Thanks for sharing it with us Nancy.

mmm! simple, quick and tasty! this is nothing mind-blowing, but it's good and a nice alternative to steamed veggies. we used about 3 cups of thickly sliced zucchini, fat-free dressing and cooked them on the george foreman grill.  topped with some parmesan cheese and it was perfect for two people. enjoy!

This is another easy way to prepare grilled zucchini.  We thought it had a very mild flavor.  Will do again.

My husband and I have been doing our yellow squash and zucchini like this for quite a while. We cut ours lengthwise, place in a ziplock bag with zesty Italian dressing for about half hour, then grill, when almost done, we sprinkle with parm cheese, salt and pepper. Easy, fast and delicious.

My favorite way to eat zucchini!  I prefer the Italian dressing but I have also used balsamic vinegar salad dressing as a marinade.  I slice the zuchinni lengthwise (not as pictured) so it's easier to turn over on the grill with tongs.  I put the zucchini and dressing in a gallon ziploc bag for easy clean up and you can even put it in the fridge overnight and it will be ready to cook the next day.  You don't need to add anything else.  Buy the cheapest  dressing available and you will be satisfied with the results.  ENJOY!  UPDATE: If you prefer the coin size bites, the Pampered Chef Grilling basket works great. But, if you like the grill marks, you need to cook it directly on the grill.

I've made this several times now. I recommend using a very hot grill to get the outer surfaces a little crispy while keeping the interior somewhat firm. Too low temperature and it just gets kinda mushy.

Tasty and easy.  Replaced zucchini with eggplant which has out produced everything in the garden.  I prepared mine in my grill pan on the stove.  Added a couple small yellow and orange bellow peppers.  Topped the finished dish with fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

Instead of the Italian dressing, I brush on a little olive oil, then season with granulated garlic, salt and pepper. It's a winner every time!

Easy recipe and tastes great!  If you want extra zip, just jazz it up with red pepper flakes or black pepper and some fresh herbs such as oregano, thyme, basil and/or rosemary.

Awesome. I did zucchini, summer squash, red onion and green peppers. Could have made a meal on this alone. My family also enjoyed it very much. I used Wishbone Robusto Italian which I think is the best.

This is a tasty and super-easy way to use up all that extra zucchini from the garden.  I cut the zucchini up like pickel sticks and they were easy to handle on the grill.  Added shredded parmesan cheese on top while they were still hot enough to melt it.  Even my husband, who "doesn't like" zucchini, took seconds.  I found this idea at the last minute, so next time I will let it soak in the italian dressing longer.

I have been doing something similar to this in the oven for years, but never on the grill.  After grilling, I added a bit of fresh parm cheese to the top and allowed to melt before removing from the grill.  This was great.  I might marinate a bit longer next time.

This was great!  I put the dressing in a zipper plastic bag with the zucchini sliced lengthwise to marinate.  Expel the air and I don't have to turn.  I sprinkled Italian herbs on before grilling, and Parmesan cheese after.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! I questioned the simplicity of this recipe, but it was just exactly what it needed to me (nothing more, nothing less). I ended up cutting zucchini lengthwise...much easier to grill. THANK YOU!

This is really good. I do this sometimes when I marinate chicken breasts in Italian dressing. As with the chicken don't marinate too long as it will impart a bitter taste. I just brush it with the Italian dressing.

Grilling zucchini is my most favorite vegetables to grill. I noticed many grilled zucchini recipes use Italian Dressing and I have been hesitant to try it favoring butter and seasoning instead. Tonight I decided to give it a try and it gave great flavor to the zucchini. Other recipes recommend marinating the zucchini but this one doesn't. I found it wasn't neccesary to marinate as tossing it in the dressing still allowed the zucchini a lot of flavor. The only problem was that I found 1/4 Cup of dressing too much for one large zucchini. I actually used 1/2 Cup of dressing for 3 large zucchini and tossed most of the dressing.

I sliced my zucchini a little thicker than the 1/4" called for in the recipe, and marinated it for about an hour in Ken's Steakhouse Zesty Italian dressing in a zip lock bag with the air squeezed out.  I used the leftover marinade to baste the squash while it grilled.  Spying my pot of fresh rosemary nearby on the deck, I snapped off a piece, laid it on the grill for thirty or forty seconds until it was nice and fragrant, and then crumbled the leaves over the grilled zucchini when it was done.  A generous sprinkling of DiGiorno shredded Romano cheese, and this was the most delicious way to eat zucchini I've ever known!  I might peel the zucchini next time, but I might forget in my haste to get it grilled and ready to eat.  YUMM!

I've been making this for a couple of years, however, I cut the zucchini lengthwise and brush on either garlic pepper or lemon pepper with an olive oil base.  it's fantastic!!!

I slice zucchini and a yellow squash and marinade them in the dressing over night. Then I grill them and add parmesean cheese. It is fantastic.

This recipe was a big hit.  I think it would be nice to have some Parmesan cheese at the end of cooking.

Way too easy to be this good!!  We loved this.  Grilling brought out just a hint of sweetness in the zucchini.  I had a HUGE zucchini, so I took out the center membrane with the seeds.  My slices were closer to 1/2" and Hubs grilled them for 4 minutes on one side and 3 minutes on the other.  Great, super easy side dish when your garden is exploding with zucchini.

Very, very good and simple! I cut the slices in thicker pieces as I had a monster sized zucchini that fed us for 2 different meals.  Therefore, the cooking time on the grill was a bit longer.  Afterwards, I threw the slices in a large foil pan and drizzed some pecorino romano cheese on each piece.  I covered the pan with foil and throw it in the oven on 170 while we grilled our main course.  The steaming process further cooked the zucchini slices and melted the cheese. Next time, I will be a lot more generous with the cheese amount as it really complimented the dressing marinade.

Great idea & very tasty! (I usually just brush w/ olive oil & dash w/ salt & pepper.) I also put a slice of fresh mozzarela & sliced tomato on top of the hot off the grill zucchini. Makes for a tasty snack on a hot day.

I usually slice zucchini and yellow squash,place in a ziplock bag with approx 3 to 3 1/2 tbsp olive oil, approx 2 tbsp Greeks Seasoning and a dask of kosher salt, toss around till well coated and grill on the Charcoal Grill. when done sprinkle with shreaded parm cheese. I've been doing this for years and its a big hit, However the idea of marinating in italian dressing sounds quite yummy and I will try it this weekend!

I've made this recipe several times with great success.  This time I was out of Italian dressing so I used a Mandarin Orange with Sesame dressing and it was fantastic! I'm going to use a different dressing every time from now on.

Soaked them up and grilled them in the ol' George Foreman. Simple and very tasty. Next time, I might add a little fresh basil and sprinkle the end product with fresh parmesan.

This was ok, not great,but I'm not a veggie eater, although I'm trying. I used a light Caesar Italian,soaked it for about an hour or so, then grilled it on my George Foreman, then topped it with parmesan, salt and pepper. My son didn't like it, but my husband and I thought it was ok. I'd try it again, only I'd use less dressing, slice it thicker,and, as another reviewer suggested, top with cheese and tomatoes. So overall, it was only ok, but I'd definitely try it again. It certainly has potential!

Very good!  Nice and quick!  We had a problem with the zucchini falling apart, so next time I will cut it 1/2 inch thick.

This was a hit even with non-zucchini eaters! I used an extra zesty Italian dressing and cut the zukes into spears rather than slices (had some nice small zukes.) That cut down on the work of turning them. I marinated them a couple hours in a ziptop bag turning them every so often and used more dressing than the recipe called for.

SO easy and SO good! I let the zucchini marinate in the dressing in a container for about 45 min. The mixture of the dressing and the charcoal taste from the grill was so good. Make sure not to slice too thin. Watch the grill because these cook really fast and are easy to burn.

Loved it! I cut the zukes lengthwise, and let it sit in the Italian dressing for about 1 hour before grilling. Hubby and I were fighting over the last few pieces. What a great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

The flavor is pretty good but they can get soggy pretty quick so you want to put on the grill rather than let the zucchini sit in the sauce.

Really good - I added some Parmesan as another posted mentioned to the salad dressing and it was even better.  I should have marinated it a little longer, but overall, great idea.

I liked this easy and delicious recipe for Zuchini! The Zucchini was awesome and firmer than when I used to pan fry it. This is much healthier and I used a low fat Italian dressing. I did put a sprinkle of garlic salt on it.

A nice change as a side dish/vegetable and really really good.  My only suggestion is to cut the zucchini by length instead of width.  This makes handling them on the BBQ much easier.

Good, although I made the mistake of pouring extra dress into the pan which made it very greasy, SO DONT DO THAT! Also I will play with the Italian dressings, the newmans own was not "herby" enough for us! Thanks

Super easy to make. I sliced mine the long way so I had strips rather than rounds. I admit that I'm not a big fan of using Italian dressing as a marinade for anything but these were good, altho they did have that "sweet" Italian dressing taste. My husband & daughter absolutely loved them.

I'm not a big fan of Zucchini.  This recipe was a very nice addition to the current options that we use in cooking zucchini.  I marinated them for 24 hours.  We will try the grated parmesan cheese next time.  I like that idea.

Very good! I slice the zucchini on an angle to get long slices, and since I didn't have any dressing I just sprayed then with olive oil, added s&p and bit of garlic powder.

I think this was terrific!  I grilled in on medium heat on a gas grill using the Italian dressing basting sauce.  I cooked it until is was tender and slightly browned with obvious grill marks like the photo.  I really couldn't taste the Italian seasoning after the zucchini was grilled, but the flavor added by the grill was was wonderful.  Also, I sliced the zucchini lengthwise as previous viewers suggested.  I thought it tasted as good as the chicken I was grilling!

I think the dressing was a little too overpowering for the delicate zucchini.  Not my favorite way to prepare zucchini.

I thought this was simple and delicious! I used low fat Italian dressing and marinated in the fridge for about two hours before grilling. I also had HUGE zucchini from the farmer's market so I cut into quarters instead of slices and placed on skewers to make it easier for my hubby to flip on the grill. He loved this extra convenience and I love this recipe. Thanks!

My zucchini acted like a sponge and soaked up all the vinegar out of the dressing. I did eat it, but i won't be making it again. Too vinegary for me.

My hubby didn't feel like grilling after work so I got out the George Forman grill. I soaked them in the dressing and added fresh parmesean over the top when all were grilled. Will definately make again - inside grill or outside, either one.

A good quick summer vegetable dish.  I did cut them as sticks because it seems whenever I do rounds, I am losing them into the grill.

I used huge zucchini. Monster size ones. I thought the skin on the zucchini was too tough and the grilling didn't seem to soften them. Flavor was pretty good. I may try again but with peeled zucchini.

~Really Good~
I chunked up the zukes then skewered them.  Used Olive Garden Italian dressing and basted them as they cooked.  Delicious!!

I made this last night but used raspberry-walnut dressing instead of Italian dressing (I love to use it with all vegetables that I grill). However, because this is a sweet dressing, you may wish to sprinkle a little salt on the veggies while they are on the grill. Delicious!

I have been doing this for years now and thought I "made it up"! So good and soooooo easy! Often I use balsamic vinaigrette dressing instead of Italian. But both are marvelous! I also marinate portobello mushrooms like this before I grill them. DEEEE-LISH!

I was excited to be cooking for many people so I could fix grilled zucchini.  DH doesn’t care for it, but the rest of us did.  This recipe is so simple with only 2 ingredients.  I served this with ‘Beer Butt Rosemary Chicken’ from AR and the zucchini paired nicely with the chicken.   So simple and easy to fix – great for when your garden is overflowing with zucchini.

This was super-easy and quick to prepare, and my family raved over it!  We grilled the slices on tin foil, but I think next time I would slice them length-wise so as to better fit them on the grill; with all those slices, it was a tight squeeze!  Thanks for a great summer recipe!!

1st time I have ever grilled Zucchini. Evidently they are very good. I got called away just as they came off of the grill, and I didn't get any, got rave revues though. Will try again later in the week.

I cut the zucchini in quarters (spears), tossed them in the dressing, and grilled.  It worked fine.  The zucchini tasted OK, but it was a whole lot tastier with extra dressing on the finished spears.

This was very good! I used a blend of zucchini and yellow crookneck squash. These were tangy and had a lot of flavor. I don't like zucchini they taste "green" so I left those behind, but we all liked this dish. Thanks!

Nothing better than fresh grilled zucchini!  I used lite dressing and it worked fine.  Just needs a little salt and pepper to finish it off.

This was fabulous!  I added the parmesan cheese before and after grilling.  I also put spaghetti sauce with it, which added a different, but very good, flavor to it.  I will be making it again very soon!

Super easy and tastey! I soaked mine in a balsamic vinegar because that's all I had--a little too sweet, but that was my wrongdoing, not the recipes. I used my grill pan on the oven over med-high heat for around 3 minutes on each side, salt and pepper hot off the grill--perfection! It's so hard to cook squash correctly without it becoming mushy, and this does it wonderfully.

I didn't like it. The dressing just made it tangy. I think the only reason we eat squash is because it is so easy to grow. I like squash sauteed with onions, olive oil, salt , pepper and a pinch of Italian seasonings.

Don't let this simple recipe go by untried. Saw that it was today's featured recipe, looked over at the huge zucchini on my counter from a neighbor's yard and thought why not give it a try? I did prepare it on my indoor grill, but I was pleased with the outcome and can't wait to have the leftovers on tomorrow's salad. I also did what other reviewers said and put parmesan cheese on top, but I think it would be great with or without.

I tried this simple recipe before and it's good but tonight,I think it was my doing that made this dish not turn out as good as before. First of all,I don't reccommend doing this on a inside grill,the taste just wasn't the same and I put parmensan cheese on top of them like another reviewer did,it was fine but it was her taste, not mine. All in all,a fine dish,just treat it honestly.

As others stated, this is a simple but good recipe. We liked it using balsamic dressing and eggplant in place of zucchini and italian dressing.

Instead of the Italian dressing I use the dry Italian dressing pack and olive oil in ziplock bag. I use this with chicken or any veggies for grilling!

This is good.  I usually use sundried tomato salad dressing as a marinade for my grilled veggies and veggie kabobs.  Also good with chicken or shrimp on the grill.  Yum.

This was the worst, but probably only because of my choice of salad dressing (hence the 3 stars).  I usually use Paul Newman's Italian Dressing but I thought I might try his Lite dressing.  Big mistake.  We could only taste the vinegar.  Will try again with the non-lite dressing.

This was a delicious and (important) simple recipe!  I think the veggie basket or skewers are a great time-saving idea.  I flipped them all with tongs and it took awhile.  Hadn't read the reviews before cooking, just wanted to grill my zucchini and yellow squash.  I used an olive oil and vinegar dressing and it was great.  I usually sautee my zucchini but was grilling a tri-tip, so this was a perfect side.

I loved it, but hubby didn't care for it.  I used light/reduced calorie Italian dressing and stuck the zuke slices on bamboo kabob skewers for ease of grilling (through the long way so they laid flat).  Added a dash of seasoning salt too.

I picked fresh  zucchini  from our  this morning and made this recipe with our grandkids help.  They really liked them .  And then I let them come up and experiment with other  spices  in the cupboards, and we will see how that goes.

Simple and delishious! I made mine into kabobs. I cut my zucchini into half moon chunks along with chunks of onion. Toss them together in a baggie and added the Italian salad dressing. Let them marinate for a couple hours in fridge. Then right before grilling time, I kabob the veggies. You could use other veggies too, I just happened to like zucchini and onion the best so that's all I used. If you use wooden kabob sticks, make sure you soak them in water for awhile before grilling so they don't burn up.

I tried this recipe on Independence Day as I had my parents over at my home for a cookout.  I cut the zucchini length wise, 1/4 of an inch thick as the directions stated.  I poured just a little bit of Italian dressing over each slice of zucchini and brushed the dressing to completely cover each slice.  I sprinkled parmesan cheese and cooked the zucchini for about 10-15 minutes, turning them over once during cooking.  The next time I cook zucchini, I will sprinkle only one side of the zucchini with parmesan cheese, just long enough to have nice grill marks and the cheese has melted.

My husband and I loved this! so quick and easy to make. I quartered the zucchini lengthwise and ended up baking instead of grilling due to the weather, but will definitely make on the grill next time. I also added a little salt and pepper and sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top. Simple and delicious!

Really good! I cut my zucchini too thin (I've never grilled zucchini before) so it was quite soggy, but still very tasty. However, this is a very good recipe. What an easy side!

Very good and super easy... I left my bottled itialian dressing at work so I let my daughter help me make some and it was realllly easy to do and she had a lot of fun shaking the bottle up... I grilled them on the gf so it did take awhile but the longer they sat in the dressing the better they were. I used a huge zucchini and a yellow squash.

This was good.  A nice, light change from frying it. Although, my son said it was "too spicy".  I take it he doesn't care for italian dressing!  Might try grilling it on a smaller grill tray next time.  I lost a lot of the smaller slices in the grill!

This is just full of flavor, a great healthy way to get veggie-haters to eat them up. I did it in a grill pan on the stove and combined zucchini and summer squash. The dressing gives it a great zing and the grilling really brings out the sweetness.

These were pretty good. I wrapped them in foil instead of placing directly on the grill because some of the pieces were pretty small. But, I think next time I would do it as written.

Nothing really special here but a welcome change from how I typically grill zucchini (balsamic vinegar/evoo/salt/pepper). I did find that it needed a bit of salt and pepper.

As much as I was looking forward to this I did not care for this! A waste of good zucchini & italian dressing.

Absolutely wonderful!  Easy and so tasty.  The only thing I changed with this recipe was that I added an extra zucchini.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly the same.

Easy and soo good!!! I marinated for 3 hours in herb and garlic dressing. I used the indoor grill and would suggest to cut it thicker bcuz mine fell apart a little bit. Im glad I used the rest of my zucchini to try this one out. Ill def make this one again. I put it ontop of my salad and went great!

This is very good and different tasting, I thought I would not taste well but it did the only reason I gave it a four instead of a five, was because it didn't taste good the after it got cold or the next day after warming up. But other than that I would make it again but not do the warm up thing.

I do something similar. I use a Balsamic Vinaigrette and marinate the zucchini slices for about an hour or so then grill it, it is DELICIOUS!

Wonderful! Really enjoyed the taste that the Italian Dressing and Grilling gave to our fresh Garden Zucchini.

This is a very flavorful and simple recipe....you can add spices to you liking such as I added Italian spice and parmesan cheese.  I halved lengthwise for grilling then sliced into smaller pieces  before serving.  Thank you for this recipe.

I liked this, but I would suggest marinading for 15-20 minutes to soak up some of the flavors in the dressing.
