Ok, I really can't say enough good things about this! The reason I chose to make this is I love rutabaga, and I wanted some new ways to prepare it. Plus this recipe sounded interesting and unlike any stew I had made. Sold!  I thought for sure this stew would end up bright red, but surprise! It didn't! The color actually kept getting lighter the longer it cooked and the beets turned a light color.  I made this exactly as written, except I added a couple bay leaves like the other reviewer suggested because I was afraid this would be bland. My only suggestion is to add some salt to taste. It was really necessary to bring out all the lovely vegetable flavors in this stew. It's VERY healthy and I don't feel guilty about having two servings. The best part - it's even better the next day! Keeper!!! Thanks for the great recipe BTheGusto!

This stew is delicious and unique.  I rarely give 5 stars (don't like grade inflation), but this recipe deserves it.  Used beef and added bay leaf and salt as recommended by other reviewers.  Thanks for sharing it!

The stew was very sweet! And after simmering for 3 hours was nothing more than chicken shreds and rutabaga.  Calorie count is great but nothing special other than that. Would not make again but did remind me that I love rutabaga. BTW>>>>> it may not have turned red but it was a very "bright orange".

This recipe was an A+! I did a few modifications only based on what I had or didn't have but just the chicken rutabaga combo concept here is a great base. I didn't have beets or carrots but I did add sweet potatos, mushrooms, and chopped kale. It really made for a hearty stew. Per some other reviews I added a bay leaf and I added a dash of herbes de provence. I would absolutely make this again, delicious!

Absolutely LOVED IT!  I added one bay leaf and little bit of dried thyme......Delicious!  Thanks for sharing your mom's recipe.  Perfect for a cold winter day, the stove heat helped keep the house warm and lovely aroma.

I didnâ€™t have rutabaga, and celery so I skipped that. Used chicken wings. I added spices: bay leaf, thyme, salt, celery seed, and less( not so soupy) chicken stock instead of water. Added parsnips too.

To start with, it's way too sweet. Maybe cut it down to one beet. But I did like the earthy flavor and I did have to add salt and bay leaves. To cut some of the sweet flavor I added chili paste - which made it a bit more savory and took care of some of the swwetness.

It's snowing here.  I had rutabagas I wanted cook and found this recipe.  I didn't beets, but I had everything else.  I made this and some cornbread.  Wonderful!
