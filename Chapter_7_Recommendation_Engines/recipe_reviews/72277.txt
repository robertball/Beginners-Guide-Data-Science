Wow. I'm not sure what else to say. I found this recipe earlier tonight, and thought I'd give it a try. After making it according to the directions, and serving it for dinner, I think I may be able to make some suggestions to help improve it. For instance, you could navigate away from this page to a good recipe, never to return here again....

I used this recipe as a foundation. My family likes a little more flavor and spice so I added a bunch stuff.
Instead of breast I used skinless thighs and legs, mainly so the meat could cook in the sauce longer without drying out and gain the additional flavor. I cooked the meat in a little olive oil, onion, garlic (lots of it because I love the stuff), and ginger before adding the chicken stock. When I added the tomatoes and pepper flakes to the stock, I also added about ¼ -½ tsp. each of paprika, cayenne, and black pepper. Keep in mind that I doubled the recipe so this sounds like a lot of pepper but it really isn't. Left out the mushrooms because I hate them. Once the meat was close to done, I increased the heat to reduce the sauce. Do not reduce too much because the peanut butter thickens the sauce really quickly. ***This part is key*** Lower the heat and gradually add the peanut butter to the sauce. Do not dump it all in there at once and taste test as you add! I saw many complaints on here saying that the peanut butter was too overpowering. Just add as much according to your taste. The original recipe (doubled) called for 1½ cups of PB and I used maybe a ½ cup. Also, I used a combination of Simply Jiff and a natural crunchy peanut butter to cut out some of the sugar. Skim the oil that the PB produces from the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add water to thin it out. 
Added salt, not much, to taste at the end. 
Served with green beans sautéed in garlic and rice.

Hey, I'm the original poster of this recipe, and I have added a few things to it since I first posted. Add a chopped green pepper and half a bunch of fresh broccoli. It helps with the color problem and is yummy!

After reading almost all of the previous reviews, I made these additions....I added 1 chopped green pepper, 2 chopped garlic cloves (from the jar), a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper & smoke paprika, 1 tsp of chopped ginger (from the jar), one tsp of red chili sauce, one tsp fish sauce, few splashes of lime juice, and reduced the peanut butter to about 1/3 to 1/2 cup. It came out spicy (but I like it that way). Next time I will add another vegetable, like snow peas or broccoli. Overall, I enjoyed it and will make it again. I couldn't imagine not having made the additions though....

We love this recipe at our house! My fiance loves it and wants to eat it at least once every two weeks! We usually eat it with fresh bell peppers and/or pineapple.
Thank you so much for this!

Very good. The peanut butter flavor wasn't overwhelming at all. The only thing I did differently was to add a little lime juice and a splash of fish sauce. Thanks!

What I liked so much about this recipe is how simple it is to make! Overall the taste was very good.  I think most people could easily throw in whatever veggies they prefer. I threw in a bag of frozen. The sauce was flavorful prepared as instructed. To add a little something I added lime and chili paste. My rating is based on the recipe as prepared.

Great recipe! Tasted good, easy to make, my kids even liked it!  I used a can of Rotel-like tomatoes instead of just a can of diced tomatoes, added a smidge more broth since the can was smaller, and liked the added spiciness.  Quick, good and filling.  Will definitely make this again.

The peanut butter overpowered the flavor.  Also, presentation wise it needed more color.

This recipe has great flavor - after having made this, though, next time I will add water chestnuts and a little more red pepper.  My skeptical meat-and-potatoes mother even enjoyed it!

I modified this slightly, since I was trying to use up some produce before it went bad, and it worked out perfectly.  First, in addition to one onion, I used 4-5 cloves of garlic, minced. Not only did it smell wonderful, but it gave a subtle yet present garlic twist to the end. Secondly, I omitted the can of diced tomatoes and the red pepper flakes, deciding instead to double the broth to 1-1/2 cups, so as to not lose the moisture that would've been provided by the tomato juice, and use 2 tablespoons of fresh minced ginger.  Oh, and I chose to use shiitake mushrooms--definitely more flavourful than most options! Also, if you choose to use additional peanut butter, the sauce will get thick enough to where it can be served on tortillas, which made taking leftovers to work a breeze! Definitely a great base recipe, will be using again in the near future.

I was really craving some good peanut butter chicken, and was excited to eat this. I did change it, though. I didn't have the diced tomatoes or mushrooms, so i had no choice to leave it out. afterwards, I did add garlic, with a smidge of honey and soy sauce. It was really yummy and great with fried rice. Next time though, I want to try it with the mushrooms and tomatoes, because I did find the peanut butter taste overwhelming. I strongly recommend another reviewer's advice to add the peanut butter a little at a time, tasting it until you're happy.

Started with poached chicken, so sauteed the onion and simmered the tomatoes first before adding the chunks of chicken and peanut butter.  I read all of the previous reviews and decided to add some more flavors - soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, and a little Thai Sweet Chili Sauce.  No mushrooms - and served over brown rice.  Fresh chopped cilantro would have been a great garnish!

I had to scale this down because I was only cooking for myself, so I'm not exactly sure it got made as it should have been, but I like how it turned out. My sauce is more red than brown and I added a whole red pepper (cut up) instead of just the recommended red pepper flakes. It is fantastically spicy with a hint of peanut butter. The texture is amazing (and I used extra crunchy to add to it!). Very good recipe!

This was pretty good with some changes. I added cayenne pepper, a minced clove of garlic, a chopped green pepper and some soy sauce. I thought the sauce was somewhat bland before the additions!

The taste of the onions which have been succulently cooked melts in your mouth as you eat it; the combination of the tomatoes and peanut butter with a hint of cayenne pepper... , that is one sexy recipe. The chicken is cooked just enough in 5 minutes and once you take a bite you can see the lavish white flesh of the chicken. Everything is just right. Well done BlueSP for submitting this.

My husband loved it.   We added some lime juice and a bit more red pepper flakes.  Next time I might try a bit of ginger as well.

*Update - I made this again with the doubled red pepper flakes, green and red bell pepper.  Also this time, I only used a little more than 1/4 cup peanut butter and used garlic salt.  This recipe is great because it makes a good amount of sauce and it went great with steamed rice.  My bf thought it was a Thai dish!  This was my second attempt to make this dish perfect and the only thing I did wrong was I covered the pan while it simmered but that was a mistake because it should have cooked down to make the sauce thicker so I had to put some cornstarch at the end to thicken it.

Hands down one of my favorites. I have this at least once a month. I have tweaked it a little for my taste. I added more peanut butter and spices.

I was unsure about this recipe when I first saw it but I LOVE peanut butter so I gave it a whirl...glad I did!  It is really tasty and has become a staple in my recipe book.  Like some others, I used red pepper flakes to give it a kick and served over white rice.

This is really good. My husband and I both liked it. There are peanut butter food recipes where I've found the peanut butter to be overpowering, so I only added half a cup. It was great. The chicken with onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and tomatoes was so pretty that I prayed the peanut butter wouldn't mess it up... it was fine. The mushrooms are great. That is an ingredient you don't want to skip. I diced instead of sliced. 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes wasn't enough to taste them. I added a little cayenne pepper. After each having a plate, I added curry powder, cumin, garam masala, and a wee bit of coconut extract to the rest. That was good, too.

The recipe was good....But do not follow the peanut butter amount....Cut it in half. It was good but to overcome the peanut butter taste i needed a lot of rice....I will try again without the excess peanut butter. As far as changes to the recipe i would def. season the chicken, add some type of bell pepper...I ended up mixing red, green, and yellow bell pepper to give it color. I also added some lime juice to the chicken as i was seasoning it...but i didn't let the chicken marinate in the lime juice for long....

This was soooo good!  I didn't change a thing from the original version. A keeper for sure!  The only think I might add next time are some peanuts for a little crunch.

I really loved this recipe.  I read it once and didn't look at it while I was cooking, so the measurements weren't exactly the same, and it came out a little too thin.  I was going to have it over rice anyway, so I mixed the rice in and it turned out perfect.  Will make again!

I loved the flavor and will definitely make this again.  I made some changes.  I used thighs instead of breasts, skipped the tomato and used canola oil.
Next time I think I will add some lightly crushed peanuts for texture.  I also didn't have any stock or bullion so I used some chicken season powder and melted with water.  I'm sure it changed the flavor, but it worked well.

Good base. I added broccoli and garlic for more flavor/color. Also toasted shaved almonds and put on top with sliced scallions.

As others have said, this is a great basic recipe for peanut butter chicken. I was looking for a recipe similar to a Senegalese dish called maafe that was faster. I did not follow the recipe to the tee because I didn't have the ingredients listed and I wanted a more flavorful punch. I used frozen chicken thighs and nixed the chicken broth and diced tomatoes because I wanted a thick sauce. As the chicken thighs cooked, they released about a cup of liquid to which I added (all are approximates because I don't measure; I just pour): ~1/2 c of tomato sauce, ~1/8 tsp red pepper flakes, ~1 tsp garlic powder, ~1 tsp onion powder, ~1/2 tsp cayenne, ~1 TBS paprika, ~1/2 tsp cumin, ~1/4 tsp ginger, ~1/2 tsp curry powder, and ~1/4 c brown sugar. I added sliced onions and drained, canned carrots, and the peanut butter. 'Twas delicious with a subtle peanut taste and spiciness from the extras I added. Next time I will add more peanut butter because I really like that thick, saucy taste.

This was so flippin good! I had no canned tomatoes and used pasta sauce instead. Definitely suggest the tomatoes. But still really darn good. Over angel hair was great. Maybe their is a better alternative to a tomato-based sauce. Thank you Jesus for pb chicken!

I had high hopes for this recipe. It was bland and almost uneditable. I believe another individual mentioned that they used it as a foundation recipe and would agree that something needs to be added.  I will not be making it again.

This recipe was super bland. I do have a preference for lots of flavor (like spicy Thai and Indian curries) so it might just be me. It was easily saved by adding the ingredients for a Pad Thai sauce though. I threw in some tamarind paste, sweet chili sauce, saracha and lime. I then include some cooked broccoli, bean sprouts, cilantro.

It was pretty good! In the end because I didn't have a can of diced tomatoes, I substituted by dicing one tomato into one cup of marinara sauce. I had to add a little more chicken stock, but it turned out wonderfully! I will be serving it over rice tonight..

Made this with no tomatoes and no mushrooms since my family has allergies. Added about 1/2 cup of soy sauce, a pinch of brown sugar, and a teaspoon of honey to the chicken broth prior to adding the peanut butter. Caramelized the onions while cooking the chicken, and served over red quinoa. Hubby loved it!

This was really good!!!! I am impressed. All was gone quick. I added green beans which was a perfect match and served it with quinoa. The peanut butter gave a hint of peanut flavor, not at all over-bearing. I am making this for a gathering. Very good and easy; I had all the ingredients at home.

Love peanut butter?  You will love this recipe.  It is a favorite to put on pasta at our house.  Homegrown canned tomatoes make this recipe even more fragrant.

this was pretty good and really easy to make. if you're looking for something relatively fast for dinner this would be a good way to go.  i did add more crushed red pepper flakes which barely spiced it up(i'm swedish, so if i'm adding more you know its not that spicy:)). i only gave it three stars b/c it has to be amazing to get four stars out of me, but with a few more changes i'd make this again.

Besides using less peanut butter, I used 8 oz can of tomato sauce and 2 cans of water in place of the stock and diced tomatoes in juice. Also used cayenne pepper and a little low sodium soy sauce to flavor it up some more. Added cooked broccoli prior to serving over sticky rice.

I really liked the peanut butter taste of this recipe. And it is great served over rice. The only criticism I have is that when I made it, it came out far too salty for me. Next time I think I'll use water in stead of chicken stock. I added fresh broccoli. I think it tastes great with some brown sugar tossed in as well for just a little sweetness.

My family and I didn't really love this.  Though we love peanut butter, this amount is this recipe was a little overwhelming. If I was to make it again I would probably add much less peanut butter.

I was really uncertain about mixing tomatoes with peanut butter, but this is a winning combination!  I'm adding this to my regular menu rotation.  I did put in less peanut butter than called for, and I think I'll try adding peas or another veggie that I have on hand next time just because I like experimenting.

I left out the mushrooms, since the hubby doesn't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe. But neither of us liked this at all, and we're both HUGE Peanut butter fans. The tomatoes just don't work well with the PB in our opinions.

This was just OK for me, nothing spectacular.  It seemed like it was missing something...I squeezed a lime wedge on it and it made it a little more interesting.  I probably won't make it again to be honest.

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I love peanut butter, so I had to try it and it turned out amazing.  I did make a few modifications though.  I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I blanched a few roma tomatoes and removed the skins, cut them up and they worked well.  I also added garlic while cooking the chicken.  After I added the peanut butter I squeezed in some fresh lime juice which really added a nice flavor and I also added a large dash of Braggs Liquid Aminos (which is basically a soy sauce substitute so soy sauce would work well too).  We doubled the recipe, but beware that doubling the recipe doesn't mean doubling every ingredient.  You don't want to double the oil or the onion, but you can double everything else.  We added a bit extra pepper to in order to kick up the spice a bit.  We served it over jasmine rice.  All-in-all, an awesome recipe and I look forward to the leftovers.

This is delicious!  You do have to be a big peanut butter fan, and if you are you will not be disappointed. Especially if you double the amount of peanut butter, which I do cuz that’s how this peanut butter fan rolls ? Someone here said it was bland…it’s not bland, it’s PEANUT BUTTER.  And I used a “6 pepper blend” from Durkee (?) instead of the red pepper flakes and that gives it a little kick without it being too spicy (I can’t eat too spicy)  Also, crunchy peanut butter makes this extra yummy too….and if fresh mushrooms are expensive in your area, canned works just as well.  This is good over rice, but it also makes a great “goulash” of sorts to eat by itself in case you are watching your carbs.

I usually complain when ppl change a recipe and then review it, but now I am going to be guilty - I had no mushrooms so I used about a 1/3 of a bell pepper chopped finely.  This recipe was great.  Rich and different!  Picky son was not crazy - which is weird because I think he was peanut butter running through is veins.  Picky hubby - very impressed!

This recipe was very tasty, but my wife and I both agreed upon tasting that it was missing something. Soy Sauce!! We just added it at the table, but I think next time I would actually cook about 1/4 cup into the recipe.

Really good, but tweaked it a little and next time will tweak some more.  What I did and will do next:
Add tablespoon of Tabasco sweet & sour
Add more red pepper flakes
Reduce peanut buttter (will probably only put in 1/2 cup or less next time)
Increase chicken broth

Otherwise was really good!  Would be ood with shrimp or beef too.  I might also try to add some broccoli

It was okay. The advice about adding the green veges to it is a good idea. I had some peanut butter chicken at a restaurant and was looking for a similiar one. This wasn't what I was looking for, but it was still good. I think the one I had was maybe fried.

This recipe is really, really good. It has an interesting combination of flavors and it really hit the spot. On top of everything else, it warms up great so it is just as good the second and third time as it is the first. I left out mushrooms (personal preference) and added green pepper, I also used roasted diced tomoatoes (which I think made for an even more interesting flavor combo). Excellent dish - I will make it again!

I don't like picking on a recipe, but this was pretty bland and as I got deeper into the cooking process I realized there were hardly any spices. I remedied this by adding 1T oyster sauce, and sprinkling cayenne and coriander to taste. I also added diced yellow bell pepper, but yellow didn't do much for the color issue. I let it simmer for an hour and served it over noodles. After these changes I thought it was greatly improved, however my husband was not impressed.

This recipe was Delicious!! I cooked some spegetti noodles and added some chinese maranade and pan fried them. I served with this dish, and my family absolutley ravwed. The best part is we had some leftovers, so my husband and I took it to work the next morning. We had to eat it cold and let me tell you, it tasted better this way..YUMMY!!!

This recipe was okay for me.  I don't care much for peanut butter but wanted to try this because my husband eats peanut butter chicken often at the restaurants.  Mine didnt even compare but he said it turned out pretty good.  The peanut butter was a little overpowering though.
