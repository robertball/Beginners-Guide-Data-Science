I did like this, and it was really easy but a little bit bland. Next time I make it I will melt some swiss cheese on the top. I was wishing I had some to add.

Fiesta Pork Sandwiches' Haiku: "Yes, a little bland. How come, with so much flavor? Sandwich needed oomph." I followed the marinade exactly and was only a little disappointed in the yawn-inducing taste. The pork itself was juicy, tender, shred-worthy due to its low n' slow cooking time, but it needed a whole lot of dressing-up in the sandwich to make my stomach smile. That being said, my sandwich round 2 the following day included an heavy squirt of lime juice, along w/ lots of additional veggie toppings, while my husband chose to bathe his in spicy BBQ sauce instead.
