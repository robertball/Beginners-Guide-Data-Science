The thing that drew me to this smoothie was the nutritional breakdown because, yes, it certainly is healthy.  I drink a lot of smoothies and, unfortunately, simply didn't care for anything about this one.  The cocoa powder totally dominates, there's no strawberry flavor at all, not even a hint of vanilla...unsweetened cocoa powder was all I could taste.  The smoothie was "chalky" for lack of a better word and left the inside of my mouth coated.  Sorry, Melissa Hart, for the unfavorable review.  This is the first review, and I don't want to discourage others from trying, but this recipe just didn't work for me.

This was the worst thing I’ve ever tasted in my entire Life I wasted strawberries milk vanilla and cocoa powder I am thinking maybe the cocoa powder was supposed to be sweetened?

I was looking for a smoothie recipe using strawberries. I’m glad it only called for four. I’m sorry but this is not my favorite. It’s bitter (even with sweetener added). As one reviewer stated, it is chalky. I blended plenty long enough. I think I’ll have to find another recipe.

I really liked this! It was slightly bitter, but I also missed the note about adding honey to sweeten it up. I added half a tbsp of peanut butter for a little sweetness and protein. Will definitely make this again!

I doubled everything but the coaco and even add more milk to help with the cocoa. I also add sugar into it to make it sweeter but I will make it again and it's great with the few tweaks I did to it.
