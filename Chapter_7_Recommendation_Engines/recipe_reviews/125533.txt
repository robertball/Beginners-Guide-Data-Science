Great way to use up the huge crop of rhubarb we have. Although, I do think that there is an error in the recipe- the butter should be cold, not softened if you want the top coating to be a crumble. Softening it makes the topping more like a batter consistency. Also important is using full fat sour cream. I used fat free and came out with a soft- set filling.

This pie was beautiful out of the oven and tasted great.  Next time I'm going to increase the rhubarb to 4 cups - I think it would be even better.

I've been making Rhubarb Custard Pie with meringue for years. I thought that was the best rhubarb recipe, but this Sour Cream Pie beats it.

I made this last night exactly as the recipe is written and it is delicious!  I'll make it again with a few minor changes - I think it needs more rhubarb (4-5 cups), a little less sugar, and the streusel topping needs more cinnamon (oh, and I used brown sugar instead of white).  A great way to use up all your rhubarb!

I loved the soft, non-watery texture inside the pie.  I wouldn't change anything except maybe add an extra stalk of rhubarb.  Excellent pie!

I used egg beaters for the eggs and it turned out great. Only 9 points on WW with the egg beaters. 4.5 if you only eat a half piece!

This is my favorite pie.  When I don't have enough rhubarb I add strawberries to make up the difference.

Excellent pie. Even my husband who hates rhubarb loved it. The only thing I changed in the recipie was I used Splenda instead of sugar. I didn't mean to but it was in the wrong canister. It still turned out great.

This pie got rave reviews.   Just a few changes.  I was making a large pie for a group so used a quiche pan.  Used 4 cups of rhubarb and one extra tbsp of flour.  I was out of white sugar so used brown for the topping which is what I usually use anyway.  Baked about 8 minutes longer because of the extra rhubarb

I followed the advise of others and used 4 cups of rhubarb.  Also used fat free sour cream and increase the flour to 3 tablespoons.  Turned out  perfectly-- great consistency, good flavor and looks picture perfect. Added suggestion-- make sure you use a 9" pie crust or bigger!  The whimpy deep dish 8" pre-made crusts will overflow in your oven... not a pretty site.

This recipe is OUTSTANDING.  Followed recipe exactly except used about 4 1/2 cups rhubarb since that's what I had.  Worked perfectly.  A new family favorite.

I have never been a lover of Rhubarb, even when my mother, a fabulout cook, would make a rhubarb/strawberry pie.  However, after making this for my husband's birthday, he being a fan of rhubarb, even I loved the pie.  A great recipe!

Where to start. Hubby liked it some so he is eating it, I can't. I was very disappointed in that I love Rhubarb Pie. Did exactly as recipe called, except for adding 1 c more of rhubarb  which wasn't enough should I make this again.  The one thing I would do different out of our family preference would be to make a marg, brown sugar, flour & oatmeal topping instead of this one.  It seemed blah to me.

First time for me to make this recipe. Took others advice and made it with 4 cups of rhubarb. Didn't change anything else. It was the best rhubarb pie we've ever had. Set up perfectly. Shared a piece with a lady that bakes pies for her restaurant and she loved it too. Thanks for sharing!

This pie was sooo easy to make and it was DELICIOUS! I never could get the topping to be crumbly, I'm sure because it was 100 degrees in my house!  Therefore I couldn't get it to cover the top very well.  I made a double batch and covered as much as I could and it was AMAZING!  Great recipe  Thank you for sharing it with us!

I'm giving this a 4 because my husband says it's the best pie I've ever made.  I thought it was just OK, but his rating has to weigh in too!  He liked that it wasn't runny because of the custard.  I thought the consistency of the custard was weird and I couldn't decide if I should eat the pie warm or cold.  Hubby says warmed.  The topping is very good.

I made two of these pies for a Memorial Day cookout - everyone loved them. I made the pies exactly as the recipe stated except I used cold butter instead of softened. I used low-fat sour cream and the consistency was fine. Excellent pie and it was delicious by itself (ice cream not required).

Tried it hot then the next day room temp.  Loved it room temp with whipped cream.  Lovely delicate flavor.  Three ladies loved it and one who didn't like rhubarb  liked this pie.  Not overwhelming with strong rhubarb flavor.  I will make again.

This pie was good-but very different. Definately worth trying if you like rhubarb! I made it for Mothers Day and my whole family complemented.

This pie is great the sour cream filling is perfect with rhubarb. The strudel topping adds a nice crunchy texture to this pie.

This was awful!  Made just as the recipe said and it was dry and over cooked.  Probably would have been done after 45 min. total.

As a Southern boy I love rhubarb pie and when I bought rhubarb yesterday I was planning to do something else with it - then I saw this recipe this morning and tried it. You try it too - it is a winner.

My family LOVED this pie!

I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup because we like tart pies and I baked two at a time so I increased the baking time to 45 and 45.  This recipe really fills up the pie crust, but don't worry...it doesn't overflow!  

Very Very Good!

It is not that it was bad, it just did not taste like rhubarb. The taste was smooth & good but when the name has rhubarb in it you expect it to taste like rhubarb.

It tasted a lot like Rhubarb Pie.  In fact, it used the same ingredients!! I love that it didn't taste like beef stew, which I despise.  Also, the flavor of the day I had in a single scoop drop cone which I dropped.  I don't recommend that you do that, but the beef stew was delicious,  even though the rhubarb left a weird aftertaste.  Still, I tolerated it and I recommend that you use less beef stew meat.  More sugar though, as always.

This went over swimmingly at a family picnic.  Like other reviewers, I increased the rhubarb to 4 cups, and used brown sugar instead of white for the crumble topping .  Delicious.

I had frozen rhubarb last fall in 4 cup bags, so that's what I used, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  This will now be my "go to" pie.  It was amazing!!  I can see using brown sugar instead of white, but I thought it was amazing just as it was written.  Thanks David for sharing your mother's recipe.  I made this for myself on Mother's Day!! Well I shared, but it was a special treat to make Mother's Day even better!!  YUM!

Wow!  Just ate a slice with some vanilla ice cream.  Amazing!  I used fat-free sour cream and the custard was soft...will up the flour next time.  I used about 4 cups of rhubarb as that's what I had.  Not overly sweet, but packed with flavor.  This is a keeper!!!

We loved the taste of this with our fresh rhubarb. Made it as-is the first time and without a crust the second. It turned out fairly watery both times (even adding an extra tablespoon of flour the second time) but was still delicious.

I fallowed the directions to the tee and it turned out good. I did have to bake it for a few extra minutes though, but that is probably just my oven. My husband enjoyed it so thumbs up!
