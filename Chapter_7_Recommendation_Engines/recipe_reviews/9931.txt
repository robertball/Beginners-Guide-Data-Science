They are wonderful.  The only different thing I did was double the recipe as well as add a tsp. of salt.  I find that salt really balances the flavor of all baked goods.  Ok, so I did a couple of other things too.  I added a little vanilla and only because I didn't have enough rasberry jam, I divided up the pan with rasberry, then apricot and finally a blueberry jam.  The out come was 3 fantastic different cookies.  Make sure to cut them small.  They are incredibly rich.

Five stars for taste and VERY easy to make!  Used Splenda and it turned out wonderfully.  I sprayed the dish with Pam first, but with all the butter, most likely it would have come out just as easily.  Next time I'll use more jam and reserve only a cup of the mix for the topping.  Thank you for this keeper!!

Very easy and delicious recipe! The few things that I did differently were to use a combo of raspberry preserves and boysenberry preserves and I also only used 2 cups of flour. I had a lot of the pastry mixture left over so next time I'm going to make the bars in at least a 9x9 pan or larger. I think that I will also grind the nuts up to a finer consistency, too, so that the bars aren't as crunchy. Can't wait to make these again!

I slathered on a whole 10 oz jar of organic Raspberry spread, and followed the rest precisely as stated. I sprayed some non-stick spray on the pan before smashing my dough in and the bars came out very easily. Once cooled, I sprinkled powdered sugar on top and cut into small bars. I'll be making again!

Great tasting! As the other reviewer mentioned, I used more jam and reserved less mix for the top. I substituted oats for the walnuts and cut back a bit on the flour.

I thought this was tasty and easy to make, but way too much dough for an 8" pan.  I've made it twice now.  The second time I made it in a 9" square pan, and put some extra dough in a smaller pan, and still had plenty for the top.  I guess I like a slightly thinner cookie base.  

I also made some with Apricot jam, which I liked even more than the raspberry.

Very, very good.  I used raspberry filling made with frozen raspberries, sugar and cornstarch boiled until goopy (that's the technical cooking term), and the flavor was awesome!

I followed the recipe as is but for the final 1+cup of topping I added a small handful of soft brown sugar, a small handful of oats and I replaced the walnuts with flaked almonds - superb recipe, top marks and one I will most definitely make again - Thank you

Delicious! These turned out great and were really easy. I used an 8oz jar of preserves and it was just the right amount. I will make two other changes next time: use a 9-inch pan and add 1/2 tsp salt to the dough.

This was not very good, none of us liked it. Once it was cooled we tried it and it tasted like a cobbler thats to dry and stale. The dough was really thick, way to heavy, maybe I did something wrong, but it just came out bad.

I thought these were great and my 13 yr. old foodie daughter loves them. She was disappointed that we were making them for a family gathering so she couldn't have more for at home.  We doubled the recipe, used the oats rather than the walnuts and made half apricot and half raspberry. Delicious! Making more this week to keep at home.

These were just what I was looking for and they turned out great  I went easy on the raspberry jam, thinking it might be too rich and sweet.  That was not the case and I would use the full amount next time.  Made for my daughter's teachers Christmas Luncheon.

Had to find a use for some jam I made that was too thick.  Didn't use the walnuts, added 1/4 c oats instead.  Added 1/4 c chopped almonds to the reserved mixture for the top.  They came out delicious, everyone loved them.

A little too nutty for my liking.  But I guess this would make it more nutritious.

Found that the time to bake was a little too long for my oven, but I also had decreased the serving size, so that may have had something to do with it. I just kept my eye on the squares though and it turned out delicious.

Excellent and very easy---take it from someone that can't bake. Followed the recipe as is and it was wonderful--fyi--don't flatten the mixture before putting it in the baking dish because then it becomes really difficult to spread, leave it grainy and THEN flatten.

Very good.  I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan which yeilded a thick base (about 1") and plenty for topping.  I also cooked these on my grill (pan is pyrex) at about 400 for 30 min and they did just fine.  It was over 90 outside so I didn't want to heat up my kitchen.  Overall these are great, and actually stay together (some bars seem to crumble, these do just fine).  Next time I make them I am going to experiment with using less butter & wheat flour, simply to "healthy" them up a bit.

We loved these at my house.  They were better the 2nd day than the first, I think.  I recommend that you make these ahead.

as other reviewers have said, too much dough for the amount of jam. i baked this in a 9-inch pan, and used 8 oz. of jam. about 25% less dough would probably be about right.that said, the flavor was good.

This recipe is delicious as is, however, I was torn between apricot and raspberry so I made mine half and half. Personally, I thought the apricot was a much better choice. I followed this recipe exactly as instructed besides adding just a little dash of cinnamon to the crumbley top before baking. Mmmm! This is a keeper! Oh and for those of you who just can't wait to try it right out of the oven...its great warm too!

This was great and very easy. I had been looking for a raspberry bar recipe like the ones you get in the bakery. Although this was not the same it was very good. As soon as I use the rest of this jar of raspberry jam I'm going to try apricot.

I can't give this recipe 5 stars because it didn't knock my socks off. However, my husband thought they were delicious. It's a very simple recipe with few ingredients, so for that, it's definitely worth 4 stars.

So tasty and summery.  I made them with blackberry jam -- an 8oz jar -- and used almonds and the zest of a lemon in the crust.  Such a perfect picnic dessert.  For me, though, it was too sweet.. but that would be solved by using fresh, sugared fruit, rather than jam.

My family loved these, we made them dairy free by using Nucoa and used apricot jam which I liked way better than the raspberry.  I also thought they needed a little bit more jam and would only save about 1 cup for the top, but w'll make these again.

Made these Christmas Eve. My girls absolutely loved them! I too used a little more jam and they were wonderfully scrumptous. I will be making these treats at Christmas time from now on.

These raspberry squares were soooo delicious! the smell was simply enchanting too. You can also can it a raspberry tart if you put it in a pie pan and bake it. I would suggest putting a saving a bit less reserve mixture and put more raspberry jam though. I served it with ice cream and it was really good! Thank you so much. This recipe will definately be used in the future for me!

After reading the other reviews and suggestions, I made minor changes to the recipe and the method of putting it together.  I added 1 tsp of salt, and 1/2 cup quick oats (didn't use nuts) to the flour and mixed to combine.  Added 1/2 tsp almond extract (can use vanilla instead) to the batter and also made it with peach/apricot spread.   Rather than just dumping all ingredients together as per the recipe, with my hand mixer I creamed the sugar and butter together, added the egg and extract and beat until all combined.   Then added the flour mixture, a small amount at a time until blended.  The dough resembled large chunks.  Then proceeded as per the recipe.  I didn't feel there was too much dough as mentioned by some reviewers.  The bars came out great with a hint of almond and the peach/apricot jam made it perfect. I like the raspberry too and will make that next time.

I really loved this recipe, I smashed some fresh raspberries in with the jam and it was so delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time is spread the raspberry jam to the edge. This recipe is definitely a keeper

Very nice recipe but make sure you grind the walnuts small and add some vanilla. A nice dusting of confectionary sugar over all once cool is great. Yummy.

I really enjoyed this recipe, even if I changed things, which I normally do not, otherwise what would be the point  of rating and all, when it's a different thing altogether? but I was on the roll on this one (the butter was creamed and the raspberry jam was opened) when i suddenly realized that it has walnuts in it, and my husband is allergic!!! moreover, the right pan was already taken and I really didn't want to transfer and wash... so I had to substitute the nuts with oats and put everything into a round pie dish, the 9 " one. Well the result was Amazing and I will keep this recipe as a basic for different fillings (other jams, fruits or chocolate). Thank you

These bars are FANTASTIC!!added 1 teaspoon almond flavoring and a pinch of salt to dough I used a whole jar of raspberry jam and chopped almonds and sprinkled them over the jam(warmed jam in microwave 10 seconds or so to make easy spreading then sprinkled reserved mixture on top really nice  yet easy dessert would be good with apricot jam and walnuts with a teaspoon of vanilla in dough some coconut might be nice  over the jam also

I give it 4 stars because I feel it needs a little tweaking...but really, as a base recipe it deserves 5 starts.   One thing I'll agree with most...use a 9x9 pan, and definitely use more jam.  I did 8 oz, and ended up wishing I used the whole 12 oz jar.  Definitely add 1/2 tsp salt, and either some vanilla or almond extract, or some kind of flavoring.  I can imagine going lemon or orange marmalade with this too...hmmm.     All in all, tasty bars, a versatile recipe with few ingredients, and sooo easy to make, a keeper!

This was awesome, and a lot better than I expected.
I made it exactly as written, but I was a little worried about the pastry mixture not being quite right because the butter may not have been softened enough. I did bake it for the full 50 minutes, and it barely got a little browned. I preferred to have the leftovers reheated slightly in the microwave, which made them smell and taste even better. I think I might make this again soon.

I thought these were very good! I did change one thing though. I added some frozen raspberries in with the jam to give it that little something more to the filling. They turned out really well and I got rave reviews to boot!

These are incredible.  I'm almost sorry to say that I ate 3/4 of the batch.  This is a keeper.

This was delicious.  I added more jam after reading the reviews, and it came out perfect.

These are wonderful!  I added a tsp of almod extract to the batter for extra taste.  These stayed fresh for almost a week.  YUM.
