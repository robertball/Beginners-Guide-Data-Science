This recipe is excellent.  I did make a couple of changes, I sauteed the onion and squash using butter instead of water.  I also used herbed stuffing mix instead of the bread crumbs as suggested in the recipe.  Will definitely make again and again.

This is a good recipe but I do change a few things that I think make it better.  I use ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and I add cheese to it.  Since I have a picky husband and 2 toddlers I have found that if I add cheese they will eat almost anything! lol A good way to get kids (and picky hubbys) to eat veggies.

Like the first reviewer, I used too much water to cook the squash and onion.  The final product was soupy, but it tasted very good!  Next time, I don't think I'll reserve any of the water.

My husband loved this dish.  I wasn't happy with the stuffing topping as seemed a bit chewey to me.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the squash and onions together in a skillet with the butter.  I think next time I'll take one of the other reviewer's tips and soak the stuffing mix in with the melted butter before putting on top.  We loved this though.  I used low-fat butter and sour cream as well as low-fat, low-sodium soup and it was fabulous!

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Had some reservations about it, but when it came out of the oven, ooooooh-la-la!  It was excellent.  We used butternut squash, which gave it a sweetness offset by the sour cream.  Wonderful side.

Excellent casserole, really really yummy! Had some reservations about it, but it turned out amazing. Would be really good with thanksgiving dinner or something similar. I sauteed the squash and onions in butter and then added water and mixed everything together! Even my husband liked it!

Unfortunately, not very good. Too soupy, and the squash has a mushy texture. Will try another squash cassarole recipe.

Very good. I used less onions and I think next time I will try crushed Ritz crackers on top instead of bread crumbs for more of a crunch.  Thanks for a new way to please my picky husband, particularly with a healthy veggie.

Great recipe- I read the reviews and did what Kgora said the first time, sauteeing the onion and squash instead of boiling it, and using seasoned stuffing instead of crackers. I found it a little runny but still great so the second time I made it I used a full cup of stuffing and I stirred the stuffing into the mix. It was delicious and a huge hit with family...almost like a squash/stuffing pudding.

Instead of simmering in water, I saute onion, squash (and/or zucchini), garlic, and a jalapeno in either a small amount of oil or some of the butter, covering the pan to bring out the liquid in the squash/zucchini until the squash is tender.  To make it healthier, I typically use a low fat/low sodium cream of (whatever) soup, light sour cream & lessen the amount of butter by at least 1 T.  If I've got it on hand, I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs.

This was good, but very soupy and bland. I had to use some extra spices, and next time I will not use so much water. The recipe is great...just needs a little kick!

This was good, but very soupy and bland. I had to use some extra spices, and next time I will not use so much water. The recipe is great...just needs a little kick!

I dont know what I did  wrong. I doubled the recipe (made one the way the recipe stated and the other a diffrent way.) The one where I followed the recipe came out runny and did not taste that great. 
The second one I made was good. What I did... sauted the squash and onion in butter, drained that 
then added salt, pepper, everything the recipe called for except for I used italian bread crumbs. This one turned out much better. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! Everyone loves it! I use an herb stufing mix on top for more salt and flavor.
