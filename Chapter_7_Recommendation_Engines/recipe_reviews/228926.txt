I wouldn't say that this tastes like carrot cake, but I will say that it tastes GREAT!  I made half a recipe, and it cooked much faster than 6 hours, so you may want to start checking on it early.  Next time, I probably will double the raisins and even use golden raisins for a little more eye-appealing presentation (the dark raisins  sort of look like kidney or black beans in the oatmeal). I'll most likely add more pineapple, as that flavor was crazy good in this.  IMO the spices are spot on.  I served this with a dollop of honey greek yogurt and a sprinkle of chopped walnuts.  I portioned out what I made today into freezer containers, so this should make for a healthy/nutritional/fast breakfast reheated in the microwave.  Thanks DebbiKat for a recipe that makes the slow cooker a star (and, honestly, I'm not a slow cooker fan).

This is a great recipe!  Made exactly as stated the first time and was 5 star, but since then have made minor changes to taste.  I use a full 20oz can of crushed pineapple, draining the juice, but measure it and use as part of the water.  Have tried different kinds and amounts of sweetener, but finally decided it does not need any sweetener.  I have never cared for hot cereal, but this recipe has changed that!  This freezes very well in individual containers.  Just pop one in the microwave, and your meal is ready!  I just have to comment on some of the negative feedback:  For those who thought it was not sweet enough, I guess they must have been using it for a dessert, not a healthy breakfast (plus if you really want all that added sugar it's pretty easy to add more at the table).  For those who ended up with too much water, check to make sure you were using STEEL CUT oats.  For the ones that said the matchstick carrots didn't cook, the recipe calls for SHREDDED carrots (which you can do yourself!)  I have made this several times since finding the recipe, and it has always cooked perfectly!

5 stars. Delicious and healthy. I halved the recipe though and added more cinnamon and raisins. Great for before school healthy breakfasts.

We just loved this! We had a guy doing work at the house early Saturday morning and hubs asked me warm up 2 big bowls for them. Not eggs, sweet rolls or a big sandwich, OATMEAL! Lol!! I halved this and used a 5 qt slow cooker. It only took about 3 hours. I used the entire can of pineapple, didn't drain it and the full amount of raisins. I don't know what the sugar equivalent of the sugar substitute would be so I just added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead. It was just right, not too sweet. I keep this in containers in the frig, put what I want in a bowl, add milk and microwave a 1 1/2 minutes. Thank you! Great, fun recipe. I know my husband will request it often and I am happy to make for him!!

This seemed to have so much promise, given the ingredients, and I loved the fact that it was so healthy, but I just didn't care for it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the shredded carrots were still carrots and hadn't softened into nothing, and the taste was tart and unappealing.

Followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup zante currants instead of 1cup raisins. I initially thought the amount of water (10cupes?) seemed a bit much, esp if you include the applesauce, but since I'd never cooked with steel cut oats, I figured it'll "drink" all the water up and be more like an oatmeal when done, I was wrong. After letting it cook for 6 hours (still looked like brown water in a crockpot) I cooked it for another 2 on low.. still watery and I tasted it this morning (let it cook over night) it was a soupy-watery mess with probably about 3 cups of liquid still left over. I had to dredge out the "oatmeal" from the bottom of the crockpot. All that water didn't get absorbed, or cook down.. its watery oatmeal. Smells great, but its not appealing at all. Was kinda hoping this would be the chance I'd get over my distaste for oatmeal with something yummy. I'll keep searching.

Despite so many negative reviews, I tried this anyway. I'm happy I did. The only other time I've made steel cut oats was with a recipe from this site (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-oats/detail.aspx). I compared the water called for in this recipe to the previous link, and the ratio of water to oats was much greater (probably why people were getting really watery oats.)

Here's what I did that didn't really modify the recipe, and I was successful: I only made 1/2 a batch, so I started with 3 cups of water instead of 5. I could only find matchstick carrots at the store, so I put them in my food processor before adding to the crockpot (complaints about crunchy carrots in reviews). When they were done, the carrots were still pretty crunchy, but overnight in the fridge mellowed them out a bit before I had a bowl for breakfast. I checked on the oats hourly, and after about 4 hours I added 1 cup more water. They were done in about 5 hours... That's all I did and it worked great. Even though this is a slow cooker recipe, I still made sure I was home at night so I could check it... Now I know what works for my crockpot!

This is awesome.  My husband and my kids did too.  My husband leaves for work at 5:30 and has some, then turns it off.  When we get up and eat at 7:30 it is a perfect temperature.  We love it with vanilla yogurt on top.  Personally we think that the yogurt makes this recipe complete.  I have had to play with the spices a bit due to not having what I need, but it still tasted great!

This was the best oatmeal I've ever had! Even my husband loved it, and he is very difficult to impress with oatmeal. I followed the recipe, then added shredded coconut and a handful of extra raisins. We served it with whipped cream; it was fabulous! Simple to make, delicious to eat--with plenty of leftovers, too! I am always looking for a good recipe to use in my slow cooker, and this one definitely made the list! Thank you so much for sharing such a healthy, hearty breakfast treat! Cheers!

I halved the recipe (and it's still a ton of cereal), but used a full 8-oz can of crushed pineapple and a cup of raisins as others suggested -- otherwise followed it exactly. The only thing I would change next time would be to chop up the carrot shreds some before adding. Add some chopped walnuts before serving for added nutrition and more carrot-cake fantasy...if someone finds a way to incorporate cream cheese, we might have breakfast nirvana here!

I give the author much credit for ingenuity; I never would have thought of this combination, but it works!  I cooked my batch on the stovetop, since my crockpot was otherwise engaged.  I used a little less grated carrot and shredded them in my food processor.  I also dislike using artificial sweeteners, so I substituted some honey to taste.  It's very filling - of course, steel cut oats are always filling.  This was a nice change from the usual.  Thank you!

You must use STEEL CUT OATS in this recipe. These require a longer cooking time and a higher Oat to water ratio. The instructions on the steel cut oats box says 1 cup oats to 4 1/2 cups of water. This ratio works perfectly & is close to the ratio in this recipe. If you follow the instructions and use the ingredients required, I'm sure your end product will be far more to your liking.

I followed this exactly except I omitted the artificial sweetener and used coconut sugar and  added some unsweetened shredded coconut and walnuts. Unfortunately neither of us cared for it.

I began this late in the day so I cooked it on the stove top.  I brought almost to a boil then turned it down to low.  I used a scant 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the sweetener.  I don't like a sweet breakfast and this was just the right amount of sweetness.  I started with 7 cups of water and the pineapple juice.  While cooking I added another 2 cups.  This was just the right amount of liquid.  I don't like my oatmeal thin.  All in all, this is a good recipe that I will repeat.  It made enough to fill three, one quart containers.

Pretty good recipe. Went down on the water to 8 cups instead of 10, did not drain the pineapple, use about 3 tbs brown sugar instead of sweetness but served with a little bit, blended matchstick carrot instead, no raisins, I don't like them really, and spices I did more to taste.
I think that is all I changed. My dad liked it a lot.
Froze the rest in serving size containers to be microwaved. Made the house smell yummy. Really filling, I like steel cut oats! :)

Yummy!!! I used about 4-5 TBS brown sugar and no other sugar.  Was still sweet. I'm trying to stay away from sugar substitutes and packaged foods when possible.

Followed exactly and in the morning it was runny and watery, hard to find the oatmeal!  Would not recommend this recipe as is.  Ten cups water to two cups of oatmeal must not be correct ratio.  Hope to find a use for this soupy oatmeal mixture.

We just didn't care for this. Perhaps using sweetened applesauce would work better. I added 1/3 cup of sugar but it was not enough. Raisins plump nicely in the crockpot but there is too much liquid.

Sorry I have to rate this a one star.  It sounded so good but it turned out so bad!  I followed the recipe precisely and I definitely used steel cut oats, not quick oats.  It was runny, even after 7 hours on low and several more hours on "keep warm".  It smelled good, but I really didn't like the taste nor the texture.  The carrots, although I cut them into smaller pieces, were very crunchy, and the crushed pineapple or unsweetened applesauce made it taste too tangy.  Sorry I'm going to have to take this one out of the favorites.

I read all reviews first. As written it is too much water, 5 cups is accurate, I cut shredded carrots even smaller, included pineapple juice from the can, did not add sugar. Next time I will not use pumpkin pie spice (don't like the flavor it added).  Cooked on high for about 3.5 hours. Cook until the oats are to their done consistency but not mushy, these oats are such a cool yummy texture, better than regular oat texture! The flavor is great with milk added. Add syrup or brown sugar and it tastes like FROSTED carrot cake! This makes a lot, kids are already sick of it and I will have to freeze remains.

There was way to much water and the carrots still haven't cooked after almost 11 hours.  I was really hoping that this would come out good not sure why the difference in the photo shown and brown soup that i have still cooking in my kitchen.

I just didn't care for it at all. I like all of the ingredients individually but did not like the taste of this with them all together. Thankfully I halved the recipe.

I wouldn't say that it reminded me of carrot cake, but boy was this good! Easy, filling, healthy, tasty, and leftovers to last us all week. Big fan.

I like the idea of cooking the oatmeal in a slow cooker but there was way too much cinnamon.  I really couldn't taste the pineapple at all.  Wouldn't use this recipe again.

First time I've ever made steel cut oats and first time using a crockpot. The recipe looked delicious and the reviews were mostly high. I had a couple of carrots that needed to be used. It was easy to prepare and the time/texture were perfect, but the taste was not. I substituted regular sugar for the sweetener, but everything else was as written. Maybe it was the carrots themselves that turned us off. . . I will not make this again.

This was so easy . The only adjustment I made, based on reviews, is used half the water it called for. My cook senses told me if I'm making 2 cup of dry , double that for water. Like making rice etc.
So that's what I did, I put 5 cups of water, cooked it for 5 hours and it's perfect. The carrots added texture, they weren't hard as if not cooked or soggy as if over cooked. 
So healthy and I can eat it all week !!
Thanks

This recipe came out perfectly.  I used apple pie spice instead of pumpkin pie spice just because I don't like pumpkin pie.  Also, instead of cooking it in the slow cooker, I cooked it on top of the stove on low heat in a non-stick deep 12 inch skillet.  I let it boil for 5 minutes uncovered, then left it on simmer for 2 hours, covered.  I made the rest of the brunch and cleaned house while this cooked.  I stirred it every now and then to keep it from sticking, but otherwise it required very little monitoring.  I was cooking for a group of about 10 people who are very active, they loved it.  There were still leftovers which froze well.  I don’t eat any type of oatmeal usually, but I plan to take this to work for my 10:00 snack.   Using the non-stick skillet made clean up a snap but was not as convenient as the slow cooker.    We will definitely make this again, even if it’s just to have my daily snack at work.

This was good and we all liked it -- but good grief, don't use sucralose/splenda.  Just use honey or even cane sugar.

I really wanted to like this, but just didn't.  I followed the recipe, aside from cutting it down by size.  I felt the cinnamon was overpowering and bitter. I finely grated my carrots and they were still "carrots" and a bit hard.  I cooked this on low for almost 8 hours.  It could just be me, but I didn't care for it.

I used 1/4 brown sugar instead of sweetener as I don't like to give the kids artificial products. One taste and they refused to eat it... they said it was 'sour'. Also as another reviewer indicated, the carrots (matchsticks) remained crunchy. This caused complete mutiny at our house. The entire thing was also very runny... too much liquid. Sorry, not a hit at our house.

Way too much liquid for our tastes. I followed the recipe only changing to less cinnamon and no sweetener. We just sprinkled on brown sugar when serving. I cooked for 7 hours on low in the crock pot. It makes a huge amount so now I am trying to decide if it is salvageable or if is going in the trash. Just way too mushy.

Made this recipe exactly as listed.  If you don't want crunchy carrots, don't buy the 'matchstick' style shredded carrots and think they are going to cook.  They were still crunchy in the oatmeal after 7 hours in the crockpot.  Other than that, not impressed... way too much cinnamon or pumpkin spice.  All I could taste was the cinnamon and the granular no-calorie sugar mixed with mush. If I ever made this again I would use the juice from the pineapple and double or triple the amount of pineapple.

I'm not a breadfast eater so while my kids were away, I set this up to have for dinner.  It was great! It is also great for a dessert after a dinner meal too.
