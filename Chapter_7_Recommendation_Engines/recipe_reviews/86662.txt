Thank you for trying my recipe and for your reviews! There is an omission in the recipe I want to correct: there should be 1 tsp. of celery seed added to the dressing. Also, you may increase the amount of corn starch for thicker dressing, and please feel free to adjust the sugar and onion to your taste. Much of the fun of cooking is changing a recipe to make it your own. NEW EDIT: Please disregard the number of servings, this recipe easily feeds 12 people. I forgot to change it from the default when I posted the recipe. Also, "medium" potatoes refers to the size, not type of potato. I ALWAYS use red potatoes for potato salad. Kaye

My boyfriend wanted hamburgers and potato salad for his bday.  I decided to make homemade.  I've never made it before and was a little nervous.  My mom made THE BEST homemade potato salad and I wanted it to be like hers.  Everyone in the family always requested her potato salad ALL the time.  She passed away in January and unfortunately she never got the opportunity to share her recipe with me.   I changed a few things about this recipe.  I added 1/2 cup chopped dill pickle, used green onion instead of white, and used red potato's instead of regular.  Other than that, everything was the same.(NEW EDIT: must use 2 tsp cornstarch instead of one-it makes the PERFECT consistency). This potato salad was UNBELIEVABLE!  I was THRILLED when my boyfriend and my dad said it was even better than mom's!  They said she would be so proud of me!  I bet she was in the kitchen helping me along.  =) Thank you SO much for the recipe...it's just like mom's.  I'll cherish it forever!

This is fabulous!  I would second some of the changes that have been recommended (I replaced the onion with 3 green onion bunches, doubled the cornstarch, reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and added 1 tsp of celery seed with the mayo and 5 slices of bacon with the celery. And I used half apple cider vinegar, half white vinegar.
It's really rich and delicious!  I love it.
My only original tips would be: (1) don't freak out if the dressing smells really weird while you're cooking it, that's normal and (2) if it's your first time and you're nervous about cooking the potatoes just right, make more than 6 and then while you're dicing them, choose the six with the best consistency and save the rest for mashing or something later.

Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out awesome! After reading other reviews I made a few adjustments. First off, people complained that it was too "oniony" so I only used half a walla onion and 3 green onions. People also complained that it was too sweet so I didn't use the entire 1/2 cup sugar, more like 1/3 cup, maybe a tad bit more. I also used two tsp cornstarch and let it cool COMPLETELY before I added the mayo. I used 10 red potatoes instead of russet ones. I also added 4 slices cooked chopped bacon when tossing potatoes with celery and onions. I then added 1/2 cup sweet relish to the dressing before tossing with potatoes. With these modifications this potato salad is to die for! I brought it to a family party and it was gone in a flash. I got told that I was now the new potato salad maker for all get togethers:)THANX FOR THIS RECIPE!!!

After trying this recipe I've kept making it.  Everytime I take it somewhere I get comments about how good it is.  The dressing thickens up nicely once it's been cooled and then refrigerated.  I like to make it the night before I take it somewhere.

Well, Kaye... here's another rave review for you. My husband went ga-ga over this, and I truly enjoyed it as well. Of course I made my changes... I used 9 potatoes, had to go with 3 bunches scallions (hubs won't eat raw onion), added 5 diced sweet gherkins, 1 tsp. celery seed, pepper, garlic powder and dry mustard mixed into the dressing mix. I did not use the prepared mustard. Additionally, as others have already said, you really do need to double the cornstarch. I would not hesitate to serve this at a get together, and thanks for the recipe. Actually, my rating is 41/2 stars.

This is my first time using sugar in potato salad. It wasn't bad, just not real good. The dressing came out runny after boiling for the ten minutes. This probably my fault.
If you like a sweet dressing, try this.

This truly is the world's best potato salad!!  It is so good, I got up about midnight cuz I couldn't sleep and just had to have some!! I did use 2 tsp. cornstarch as other reviewers suggested and was good but next time I will try 3 tsp. I might add 1-2 more potatoes the next time. This is now my favorite potato salad that I will make over and over. It has the perfect balance of sweet and sour! IT IS NOT TOO SWEET, and I always am the first to cut back on sugar!

WOW !!! This was great, made for Memorial Day weekend cookout was a huge hit. Made only a few tweeks used less sugar, less onion but added a few green onions everything else was exactly as called for. The only complaint I got was why did I not make more.

I have made this twice and it was a hit both times.  I read the other reviews and reduce the sugar to a couple of tablespoons because I like tangy potato salad, but you can adjust it to your own taste.  Also I thought it looked kind of plain so I added 1/2 each of green, red, and yellow or orange bell peppers.  I chopped them finely and save a small amount back (about 1.5 tablespoons) to sprinkle over the top for garnish with the hard boiled egg slices and it looked and tasted great.  This is now my first and in almost all cases only (with the changes) potato salad recipe. Thanks KL for sharing.

All I can say is...WOW! 
My husband always says he never tasted a potato salad as good as the one at this restaurant we used to go to when we lived in Miami Beach, so I decided to try as many potato salad recipes as it would take to find one that compared to that one. I did some online research and found this recipe. After reading all the reviews, I decided this will be my first try.  Well, I'm not going to be trying any other recipes.  Not only did my husband like it just as much as the one at the restaurant, but he said it's BETTER! He said he will never eat any other potato salad other than this one anymore! He even wants to call that restaurant and give them this recipe=). 

I did use some of the modifications others had suggested. I used 1/3 c. of sugar and I used 1 bunch of green onions instead of white ones. I also used rich's whip instead of the evaporated milk because my husband is lactose intolerant. 

Anyway, I signed up with all recipes just so I could review this recipe.  My husband gives it an A+++++ and therefore I do too!!!

Thank you Kaye Lynn!!!

This is another of my "standard" potato salad recipes. It's always a hard choice between whether I should make this one or the "Summer Potato Salad" recipe. As with the "Summer Potato Salad" recipe, I sometimes add bacon to this one also. I can't seem to stay away from bacon! My recommendation is to NOT decide between this one and the "Summer Potato Salad" recipe -- make them BOTH -- they are that GOOD!

I was looking for a really WOW potato salad and with all the rave reviews, I thought this might be it - it wasn't.  After all the work of making the dressing, I didn't care for it - no depth, too sweet (and I even cut down on the sugar as suggested by others).  Guess I'll keep on looking.  Don't get me wrong, this wasn't awful, just not awesome.  So I rated it as average - 3 stars.  Won't waste my time with this one again.

I've been cooking for 40 years and this is by far the WORST potato salad that I have ever made or tasted, not to mention the biggest waste of time. I have no idea why it's getting such high ratings. I served it for dinner today, to a group of 6 people, and no one liked it.

I wish I could give this more the 5 stars..Because it is Exactly what I was searching for!! Thank you so much :) (ps it was a total hit at mt BBQ today)

I did make some Minor Changes though:

1. I used 12 sm-med potatoes which I peeled and cubed AND THEN bolied for about 10-15 mins
2. I Used 3 Green onions (instead of White), about a tsp of celery seed (instead of celery) and 4 diced boiled eggs.
3. I mixed and mashed it all with my potatoes (along with the salt): being careful not to completely mash the potatoes but leaving some chunky texture. 

FOR THE DRESSING:

1. Like other i used TWO tsp of Cornstarch.
2. I only used 1/3 Cup of Sugar
3. I used 1 TBS of yellow mustard.
4. I did not have evaporated Milk so i used   roughly 1 & 1/4 cup of 1% milk.
3.other then that... I follow the recipe exactly(I did not Increase or double the ingredients even though i used more potatoes) AND it turn out PERFECT for the amount i had. I will be putting this recipe in my favorites pile :))) Thanks again for a Wonderful, Flavorful Recipe!!

Not bad, but not the best.  I doubled everything and had enough dressing for at least 4 batches.  I recommend if you want to double it, only double the potatoes, celery, etc... (not the dressing).

I made the recipe and the potato salad was very soupy.  Unfortunately, I followed the recipe exactly but didn't scroll all the way to the bottom to read that the person who put this recipe on this site added a review later that said you would probably want to increase the corn starch.

This dressing is horrible!  I'm glad that I tried it before combining with other ingredients.  What a waste of time and money.  I like all types of potato salad.  This is just bad.

The first taste of this potato salad and I thought, oh no, who is ever going to eat this, its so sweet....  But, thank goodness, I always make my potato salads a day ahead to give the flavors a chance to marry, which is what saved this one.  It was still to sweet for me even the day after, but the hubby, who has a sweet tooth, loved it, so 4 stars it is!  Thank you Kaye Lynn for the submission.

This was great!  Because of health issues,   I didn't add the sugar, but in it's place added a dropper full of liquid stevia,  and I only used about 1/4 of the recommended mayonnaise (and the light mayo).  I also didn't add the butter.  The recipe turned out perfect and was a lighter version.  I added one red pepper diced.  I brought it on the boat, and all the guests loved it!!  Will keep this recipe.

I was throwing a party for my son's 5th birthday and I detest potato salad, however it is my hubby favorite. I came across this recipe and decided to "pre-test" the recipe before serving it at the party. Instantly it was a hit. My hubby & kids loved it-and to my suprise so did I. Well I made it at the party and I am so glad I had left overs from the "pre-test" It was gone before I was even able to blink. Rave reviews! I changed nothing about the recipe. This is so good and rich! I already have requests to make it again. This is definatly a keeper. Thanks

I was disappointed in this recipe.  I made it according to the original recipe with suggestions of doubling the cornstarch, reducing the sugar to 1/3c and adding in celery seed.  I thought this was still way too sugary and had to scrap it.  I was not proud to serve this at our 4th of July cookout.  I made it again without beating the egg and the sugar into a saucepan and it came out fine.  Leave the sugar out of this and you got a great-tasting Potato Salad.

An excellent base recipe but excessively rich, with a few minor changes this is pure potato-salad perfection. If you found the base recipe too rich, try this: First, use 3 hard boiled eggs instead of 6. In the home made dressing substitute 1 egg instead of 2. Double cornstarch amount to 2 tsp. Double evap milk to 10 or even 12-14oz. Drop vinegar to 1/4 cup. Use the full 1/4 cup of butter (I use Shedd's Spread Original) but drop Mayo down to 1/2 cup. Prepare the dressing using the same method, but add an extra 3-4 min under low heat at the end for thickening (will still be thinner than base recipe). This formula allows for more vegetables in your potato salad (potatos, celery, onions, green onions, et al) as your dressing will still be about 75% the thickness and richness of the base recipe and you will have more of it for even and complete coating. I also recommend adding fresh parsley and thyme to any vegetable combination you should choose, but simply by taming the dressing this recipe becomes an instant classic.

Very flavorful.  Definately is too sweet with the full half cup of sugar!  I tried it as written for the first time, and wished I'de followed other's advice to cut back on the sugar.  I added more potatoes, which helped...the flavor however, was excellent went paired with the spicy rib sauce we used with our rib dinner.  A hit overall.

This is indeed WORLD'S BEST POTATO SALAD! I made this last week and you know what, both my husband and I enjoyed this wonderful dish as breakfast and dinner for 2 days! It is even better-tasting on the 2nd day... UPDATES:  -------- Made this salad again last nite, substituted with 1/2 cup of non-fat yoghurt and 1/2 cup of regular mayo, beaten an egg instead of two for lower calories, the sauce turned out just as delicious without any compromise! LOVE IT, LOVE IT AND LOVE IT!

This was a WONDERFUL recipe!! I almost couldn't stop tasting it. I did although  decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup. And also used 1/4 cup green onions in place of the yellow (not a big fan of raw onions, but the green onions made it perfect and not to strong). I was left with about 1/4 cup or a little more of the mixture that I decided not to mix in. This was probably because I should have used slightly larger potatoes. I'll remember this for next time. I did add a little pepper to taste and topped it off with a sprinkle of paprika on the top. It gave it a wonder final touch! This is going to be a perfect salad for Easter! Can't wait for my mom to try it....;)

I wanted to find a new potato salad recipe for a family picnic and I thought this looked interesting. I made it exactly as written, and unfortunately I didn't think it was very good...kind of bland. Asked everyone else to give me an honest assessment and they all said the same thing, ok but nothing special. It kind of reminds me of the stuff you can buy in a tub at the grocery store. Also, I only used about 3/4 of the mayo-milk mixture and that was plenty. Any more and I would've had potato soup! Like I said, this was ok, but I've had better. Sorry!!

I didn't like this at all. I've never had such an overly sweet, overly vinegary potato salad before. I was going to make the potato and bacon salad from this website and figured I should make extra to try this recipe also. I cut this recipe in half for 3 servings and the only thing I changed was replaced the evaporated milk with regular milk because I didn't have any. I'm glad I decided not to mix the dressing into the salad mix until ready to eat, because I would've wasted ALOT of ingredients. Instead, I only had to replace the dressing! I will not be making this again.

We recently had the very best potato salad we had ever eaten at a local restaurant.  I rarely make it at home but really was determined to find a recipe we could love as much as the one at the restaurant.  Who can argue with a name like "world's best"?  I had to try this and I'm glad I did.  I made "as is" being this was my first try with this recipe and the only thing I would change next time, and there will be a next time, is a bit less sugar but that is just my personal preference.  My hubby has been eating it all day and that is always a good sign.

This is AMAZING!!! First time I've ever tried to make potato salad & I was a little freaked out.. I was so thankful for all of the amazingly helpful reviews like "don't worry about the smell when its cooking, its normal.." Thx a million for this wonderful recipe we LOVED IT! Oh, and this is a 'sweet' potato salad so, if that's not your style look elsewhere : ) I also only used half of the dressing & let it rest over night then added a little more before serving but, I still didn't use all of it. So you may want to adjust according to your taste.

It's funny because I usually shy away from recipes with reviews that start with "This was great but only after I adjusted this and changed the amount of that..."  For whatever reason, I still went ahead and made this recipe, but I was very glad to heed the advice of those that said it was too sweet.  I started with half the sugar, and then I found myself applying copious amounts of dijon mustard at the mayo stage to make it snappier.  That plus a good quality wine vinegar versus regular distilled DID indeed make this the best potato salad, and everyone went back for more.  Final note: this makes a LOT of dressing, and I have stretched it to NINE large red potatoes, 6 eggs, plus lots of celery and green onion - still plenty creamy.  Hope this helps y'all!

OMG!  This is by far the best potato salad I have ever made/eaten!  I doubled the dressing, and used a 5 pound bag of Russett potatoes.  I had about 1 Cup of dressing left over.  THE BEST!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I'm 64 & have never been able to make edible potato salad! Until yesterday when I tried this.  I confess I misread - added 1 Tbs of cornstarch, but it turned out excellent!  I put in about 10 potatoes since I was unsure of my "medium" sized potatoes.  And I didn't add quite all of the cooked sauce as I was afraid it would be too sweet. But next time, I'm adding all & putting in at least 10, maybe 12 potatoes. Husband says this is pert near close to his mom's (which he thought was the best in the world.) I am so Happy!  I have made potato salad - and it is excellent!  Thank you Kaye!!!!!  LOVE this recipe!!

This is a GREAT RECIPE!!!!  I tweaked it a little bit, but it is great without adding anything!  I added celery seed and crumbled applewood smoked bacon which just made it even more AWESOME.  My honey love said and I quote "Definitely the BEST POTATO I HAVE EVER HAD!"  Thank you for the recipe and it will be my standard recipe for potato salad for the rest of my life!  :)

This was excellent, however I made some changes to suit my family's tastes. As per other reviewers, I decreased the sugar to 2 TBs and increased the cornstarch to 2 TBs. I also cooked 9 potatoes rather than 6 as I don't like my potato (or macaroni) salad "soupy". I used a large bunch of scallions rather than white onion, and also added a finely diced green pepper since I had one I needed to use up. I added about 2-3 TB sweet pickle relish too. I cooked the potatoes, hard boiled eggs and dressing last night, and this morning actually assembled the salad so it had about 8 hours in the fridge, it was really excellent! I can't wait to try it tomorrow to see how much more the flavors developed. My family said it was "very good" and my 24 year old son who RARELY compliments, said "that's GOOD Mom!" that's GOLD right there! I served it with burgers, and chips and hone made guacamole. Excellent!  PS I left the skins on the red potatoes too, made it more colorful!

Removed the "eyes" from the potatoes as I don't like things staring at me when I am eating them. Thought I would give it a try although I have about 30 recipes for salad dressings and mayonnaise and found the amount of sugar was too much and used English mustard powder instead of the sweet yellow stuff.  Also, an old chef's trick, return the potatoes to the pan over very low heat, and place a cloth directly onto the potatoes.  Leave for about 1 minute to remove any remaining moisture from the potatoes or they stay wet.

World's worst should be. GF made it for me today and if you like to eat what tasts like a bowl of suger and you nead to put on a few extra pound, this one is for you. I guess the butter is there so when your body burns off the sugar you got some calories you can store for later : )

This recipe is GREAT! The whole family loved and wanted to know when I was going to make more. I used balsamic vinegar since it didn't specify what kind to use. I highly discourage doing because it turned the color brown. I will be using a clear vinegar next time. All in all it was a huge hit. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I love the concept of the cooked dressing.  Cooking is a wonderful thing because we can all adjust ingredients to our specific tastes.  I will definately make this again; less sugar, more vinegar and/or pickle juice, and thanks for the celery seed info - that would be really good.  GREAT recipe Kaye.  For those that want to eat it immediately this dish really does need to sit a few hours in the fridge but overnight really is best.   Some recipes are like that but they sure are worth it!!!!

I had the heat on by mistake when mixing the egg and sugar, but this recipe still turned out great. The dressing is awesome. But I only used half of it this time, so looks like I'll be making some more!

I absolutely love this recipe! Best potato salad I've ever had! Two downsides: I no longer like any other potato salad, and I get more requests to bring this dish than I can handle! I used 3/4 cup mayo & 1/4 cup miracle whip in place of 1 cup mayo, as I like the little extra sweetness.  I also garnish with a dusting of smoked paprika. I didnt use the celery seed the first time i made this, because i missed the note at the bottom, but it was amazing without so i will continue to make it that way. Also, this tastes delicious after cooling down to room temp... I dont find it necessary to chill for very long or over night, so I often make it morning of an afternoon or evening gathering with great results!

WOW!  I made this salad today for a picnic we're going to tomorrow.  Not only is this the first potato salad I've made, but my daughter said that it's even better than the salad we've bought from the local farm market!  I made sure to read the reviews, so I knew to use less sugar, increased the cornstarch, added the celery seeds and added more potatoes (5 lbs of red potatoes total!) since I have a large crowd to feed.  I saved 1/3 of the dressing in case it dries out overnight.  Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll try adding bacon or other interesting suggestions that reviewers had. THANK YOU KAYE LYNN - awesome recipe!

I made this today exactly as in the recipe.  I didn't like the taste and there was way too much creamy, vinegary, mayonnaisey mixture for the amount of potatoes and eggs.  I wound up cooking more potatoes, five pounds in total, and added them to what I had.  The proportions were much better and it was edible, but not very good.  I'm hoping it will improve with age overnight.  I doubt it.

This was good but not amazing made it exactly at written. I think I prefer the normal better( basically the main ingrediants with mayo and garlic powder. except I like pickle instead of celery). P.S. There is a huge difference in taste between the day it is made and the next day, and you must wait for the next day if you decide to make this.

This is quite good in the end but has so many little issues that it really only rates about 3.5 stars. If you don't read the most helpful review, you'll miss the fact that it needs 1 tsp celery seed. It is just not as good without it (made it twice, once without and once with, as I didn't preview the reviews!)  Also, I recommend reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup unless you like a really sweet dressing. It needs more than 1 tsp cornstarch for a thick enough dressing. Both times making this, I had way too much dressing left over. Note that this makes a lot - about 8 servings if it's the only salad on the menu, otherwise 10-12 if being served with other salad selections. Bottom line, I would make this again, but it's going to be from my custom version ;D

I am so surprised at the high rating for this dish. It makes WAY too much dressing, the sugar and vinegar are overwhelming, and the butter to me is just unneeded fat. I will go back to Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill Potato Salad Recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I'm not a fan of potato salad, but I love this.  I took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar in half, which I think was a good idea.  Also, as other reviewers say, this does make a TON of dressing, so you might cut the dressing in half or double the potatoes.  Will make this again.

This potato salad is FAR too sweet with half a cup of sugar.  I took it to a large party and came home with a nearly full bowl.  No compliments and not one person returned for a second helping.  When I brought it home my mother said nothing could be added to "save the batch" so it got tossed.  I thought that much sugar seemed odd but went with it thinking all these reviewers couldn't be wrong.  I should have listened to my gut.  Instead I was slightly embarassed for having one of only two bombed dishes at a big Fourth of July party.

I fixed this for a pool party on Labor Day weekend and it was a huge hit!  Everyone went back several times and raved out good this potato salad was. I used paprika to garnish the top and give it a slight kick. Otherwise, it is very creamy and better than anything else I've had.

This was excellent!  I added a little crumbled bacon, some chopped up pickles, Worcestershire sauce, and dill weed.  I don't think any of these ingredients were strictly necessary, but I think they helped.

THE BEST potato salad. Everyone loved it, and there were no leftovers. I will make again for sure!  I swapped out the mayo for plain yogurt, and it worked out fine. I also used waaaay less sugar than called for.

I have been searching all my 6*something years for a good potato salad recipe.  Not only did I find a 'good' one, I found THE BEST!!  The dressing is by far the creamiest and most delicious I've ever had the pleasure of mixing in with potatoes and  eggs.  YUM-O!!
Thank you very much for that!  It'll be the one I'll make at all family functions from now on.  No doubt I'll get rave reviews!

Really great! All I did differently was lessen the amount of vinegar, and add more mustard. Classic potato salad recipe.

I didn't add the celery seed because I missed the comment, but I added 1 cup salad cubes to mine and doubled the cornstarch like many other post recommended. So glad I did it definitely needed it to thicken it up. I also did 1/4 cup white vinegar and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar.  I also used raw cane sugar and was a little worried it would be brown but nope it was great and not as unhealthy so could eat without the guilt although the evaporated milk I just didn't think about it after the first bite it was sooooo GOOD!  This is a keeper in my recipe box! (; I encourage you to make it your guest or yourself will not be disappointed!

By far, the best potato salad I've ever had.  I used a few suggestions from other reviewers:  Doubled the corn starch to 2 tsp, used 1 tsp ground mustard instead of prepared, and added 1 tsp celery seed.  This dressing is amazing.  The recipe made lots of dressing; next time, I will throw in a few extra potatoes so that I can have leftovers.  (Or, I can hope for leftovers!)  Thanks!

Just made this and even before it's had a chance for the flavors to meld, it is one of the best potato salads I have ever tasted! One tends to gravitate toward those foods which instill comfort or familiarity quite often: this reminds me of mom's potato salad, but it goes beyond that. The tang with a layer of sweetness, perfectly matched... the wonderful zing of the sauce and the mixture of egg, potato, onion, celery and various fixin's. YUM! Awesome potato salad! Thank you for sharing it!

Definitely the BEST I have ever had!! I used 2 tsp cornstarch as others suggested. I also had farm fresh eggs in the fridge, which are MUCH more yellow than store bought. My husband asked if I put too much mustard in when he saw it! I have NEVER had luck with potato salad, but everyone was raving about it and is definitely worth a little extra work. I held back a little of the dressing and will be using for my deviled eggs!!!

I didn't like this recipe. It was kinda bland for my tastebuds....maybe a hint of dill or some horseradish would have kicked it up a notch. I refer a dreassing that is not so sweet and has more of a kick to it. Thumbs down for me!!!

I used cider vinegar, less sugar, and I did not have any prepared mustard so used Maurices BBQ sauce which is a mustard based BBQ sauce from So. Carolina and BOY, OH, BOY was it good! I did add sweet relish too.  I love potato salad with bite and this has the mustardy/vinegary bite. Will use again.

This was my 1st time making homemade potato salad and it was a hit! I didn't have celery seed on hand, so I skipped that. I used dry mustard instead of the one the recipe called for. I used 1/4 onion and 10 new red potatoes. Like others, I also used 2 tsp. cornstarch and 1/3 c. sugar to the dressing. I added 1/4 c. sweet relish and 1 tbsp. paprika to taste and it came out perfect! We had it with hot dogs and we finished everything in one day! My husband loved it!

Really dissapointed in this recipe.Even after altering it per many other reviews,I found it to be way to sweet/vinegary. Fortunately I tasted the dressing before mixing it with my spuds/eggs so I didn't waste the entire batch. I will continue my search for the "World' Best Potato Salad"......

I have used this dressing recipe before but mixed it with chopped fresh brocolli, sliced fresh mushrooms, sliced red onions, and raisons and sesame seeds (opt).  Also I've used it for a spinich salad.  I also mix mayo in before cooling and sometimes add poppy seeds.  It is so yummy and will keep in your frig if it makes it that long.

This IS a good potato salad though a little time consuming.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the small onion, I opted for green onion and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used 4 eggs instead of 6. I also added 1 tsp more of corn starch and added the tsp of celery seed per reviews .  Though I enjoyed every bite, (the dressing was delicious) I only incorporated 1/2  of it to the potato mixture and bottled the remaining dressing).  It wasn't overly sweet  to me , so reducing the sugar was a good idea (the south adds sugar to everything).  It had a subtle taste.  I will definitely try this again and tweek it next time by adding some dill or sweet relish.

Delicious!  This was my first time making potato salad and everyone said it was amazing.  The only change I made was adding extra corn starch. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I found this recipe distinctly AVERAGE.  I had really high hopes based on the reviews and the fact that it included the homemade dressing.  Considering the dressing ingredients included things like 1/2 C sugar, butter, 2 eggs, etc PLUS the mayo I feel like it adds an unnecessary load of calories for no good payback.  It was on the sweet side, which I really didn't like also. I'd prefer to use my bad calories in a way that I'll enjoy them, this tasted like normal potato salad with a sweet aftertaste.  Won't remake.

World's Best is absolutely the best title for this recipe! You may like it less sweet, so if you do just add less sugar...other than that it's perfect...don't change a thing!

OMG!!! This is absolutely the best potato salad EVER!  I decreased the amount of celery to 1/2 cup, added 1 tsp celery seed, 1/2 cut diced dill pickle, and 4 slices of cooked, crumbled bacon.  I also only used 3 Tablespoons of sugar. Perfect!

I was just "grazing" through recipes on allrecipes and came upon this recipe for potato salad. For years I have been looking for the dressing recipe I lost a long time ago. Low and behold this is the lost dressing I have been looking for. When I use to make it I would pour it over cooked macaroni and add 2 cans of small shrimp to it. My husband loved it has often asked for me to make it but I could never get it quite right. Now I can make it for him and surprise him! Im sure its great on potatoes too but once again he can have his favorite macaroni salad..thanks!

I don't really cook much so when my boyfriend requested that I try to replicate the Potato Salad in one of our favorite restaurants, I turned to the web to try and find out the different recipes. Thankfully, this was the first one I tried and viola! It really does taste as good as the one we have at the restaurant!  My whole family loved it too. Oh, and this doesn't just make 6 servings. Around more than 20 people actually enjoyed having this as a side dish.   My only comment is that it was too watery so I guess you really should add more cornstarch and I should've added a bit more salt and maybe some pepper. But really, it was great enough as it is already. The instructions was also very easy to understand even for a beginner like me.   Thank you so much for sharing this! I think my boyfriend admires me a bit more now because of this! :)

This recipe is very similar to the potato salad that my mom made, she passed away last week and I never really got the full recipe but I do know that she didn't use anything to thicken it, she used quite a few more eggs than this recipe calls for. Her's was the best ever though.

Definitely the best recipe I've used.  I did make a few alterations, as suggested by  others.  I reduced the sugar to about a 1/3 cup, doubled the cornstarch to make  it a little thicker, and added celery seed.  This made it wonderful!

Title of World's Best is well deserved!!!      My husband told me I had to make a gallon of potato salad for a Memorial Day Party, I freaked.  I've never made potato salad before, my mom always made it, & I really don't care for the stuff.  I read everyone's reviews, cut back on the sugar, added bacon crumbles, extra corn starch.  It is so good I had to force myself from doing anymore "taste testing" or there wouldn't be any left, lol.  Now, the ? is, do I tell my mom I can make a better potato salad then her, lol.

Pretty good! I made the recipe just as written but added chopped dill pickle. It was very good, but a little sweeter than I like. I will make this again, but will reduce the sugar as others suggested.

This was a great potato salad recipe.  Very creamy.  Few things I did different: I noticed many reviews mentioned how sweet it was so I cut back on the sugar.  I did add some sweet pickle relish which added a bit more sweet back into it.    I also added a lot more mustard than called for and cut back on the onion.  The biggest change though, add salt to your water while the potatoes are cooking, do not wait until they have been drained and cooled.  I did not add the salt to the water and I was kicking myself for not doing it every time I took a bite.  The sauce is very good but I added a lot of salt to it and it still did not quite do the job that salted water would have.  Overall, we enjoyed the end product.  I will be making this recipe again!

EVERYBODY loved it!Even the ones that said they don't like potato salad w/ vinegar! Did follow some earlier suggestions such as:cutting the sugar to 1/3 cup, increasing cornstarch to 2 tsp.,adding 4/5 slices of bacon and 1 tsp of celery seed while tossing with the onion and celery and using half apple cidar vinegar and half white vinegar for the 1/2 cup of vinegar. I had 3 people demanding for this recipe while they werer still eating this potato salad! YUM!

This is the old fashioned way my mother made potato salad.  I've made some modern adjustments and shortcuts as follows;  I make my own dressing by using miracle whip, (mayo won't work) a little vinegar and sugar to taste,  Sorry, I don't use measurements, only taste.  Stir this till sugar dissolves. Sugar will cause it to thin a little.  Adjust to your taste by adding more sugar or vinegar.  Do be careful with the vinegar . Use sparingly and add more till you get your desired taste.  No cooking involved.  I also use a lot of candied dill strips, thinly sliced. Much better than gherkins!  Green onions are better than regular onions, too.  Hope you will try this method if you like a sweet dressing.  If you like a mustard based dressing, this is not for you.

Fabulous, I did as others said and mix half regular vinigar and half apple cider vinigar. I also finely chopped up some sweet baby pickles,and added a splash of celery seed to the sauce. As my father was about to take a bite he warned me that my gramma when he was little made the best homemade potato salad. But as this glorious recipe met his palette it was magical :) he said it was equally as good if not better than his moms. Everyone at the party was licking their plates, I think the potato salad was the only dish that was empty.
Thanks for the wonderful recipe

I loved this recipe, I have never made Potato Salad before so I was a bit worried that I would mess up but it turned out great. I did add some pickels and olives to my batch but every one has diffrent tastes :) There was way to much dressing but that is no big deal :) I will defenitly make this again. My kids and hubby love it :)

This is a great recipe that can be adjusted to your individual tastes easily, for example, I added less sugar and more mustard. The suggestion the author added later about the celery seeds made this potato salad very good and unique. Will make again and again!

I always peal the potatoes and dice them before boiling. This way you can make a creamer salad by putting it together while the potatoes are hot. If you want it lumpy wait until it cools. Separate the whites from the yolks. Mix the Mayonnaise and egg whites with the hot potatoes. Put the yolks, vinegar, relish, salt and pepper together making making it kind of runny. This way you can determine how white or how yellow you want the salad. 
This is a Southern Potato Salad that I have made for over 50 years.

This is my absolute favorite potato salad recipe. I have tried so many others and I always come back to this one. People rav about it every single time, too. I sometimes skip the celery just because I'm not in the mood for the texture but other than that, I stick to the recipe completely. Thank you very much for sharing it with us!

I will no longer need to listen to how fabulous my mother-in-law's potato salad is better than anyone after I made this. None left at the end of a fabulous party!  Easy, interesting, affordable and easy to adjust. Will definitely do again!

Fantastic potato salad!  One of the very best that I have made from this site.  I made as written, and after reading the submitters suggestion, I used 2 tsp. of cornstarch and added the celery seed to the dressing.  It is creamy and delicious.  Yes, it is on the sweet side, but that is how we like our potato salad.  I used all apple cider vinegar, but can see where other flavors would work well.   Paired this with 'Sausage, Pepper, and Onion Sandwiches' from AR and fresh fruit and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner on this cold and rainy Sunday evening.

I love potato salad, just not this recipe.  I followed it exactly and found it to be way too sweet. I will give it another chance, but will not put in any sugar. I will probably add more vinegar and mustard.

I tried it at three homes with 4 families.  The kids didn't like it and neither did the parents.

If you like sweet potato salad this may be the recipe for you. I did reduce the sugar but should have omitted it.

I haven't even let it "marinate" in the refrigerator yet and it is already the best homemade potato salad I have ever eaten!  We usually pay about $60 during the holidays for a local restaurant's potato salad.  Well, NEVER AGAIN!!  My substitutions:  scallions, bell pepper, sweet relish and spicy brown mustard.  Delish!

The reviews could not be any more spot on.  My wife makes a mean potato salad that I have requested and eaten for nearly 20 years.  I decided to try this recipe and my wife gave me the raised eyebrow look that says "you are kidding right?"  I convinced her that I just wanted to step out of my comfort zone and try something new.  She saw the ingredients and thought I was crazy.  Cranked it out and she like I thought it was truly amazing.  Best potato salad I have ever had.  We will be sticking to this recipe from now one.  
We left the skins on the potatoes and added some salt and pepper and it was the hit of the BBQ.

This turned out awesome. I read some of the comments before I started so I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the cornstarch to 2 tsp like some of the others suggested. I felt so awesome for having made something so super delicious :) We had it with pulled pork sandwiches. All 3 kids and hubby loved it!

Made this recipe with the recommended changes and it was a HUGE hit!  There was a LOT, so I ended up sending it home with people and they have been requesting it frequently.  I am making it again for a party of 50 and can not wait.  Might add diced salami or summer sausage this time for a kick.  :-)

I was hesitant to try this recipe...the 1/2c sugar with egg and cornstarch really threw me for  a loop.  Alas, I am trying to repclicate the potato salad you can get from Sprout's Farmers Market and this seemed to have alot of the same elements.  I think I found a close second with this recipe.  My husband and I finished a batch ourselves in 3 days.  Not sure how many time we each snuck into fridge for a quick bite though.  This salad just calls your name :)

This was my 2nd attempt ever at making potato salad (1st wasn't very good) and it turned out amazing! I was making this potato salad for a rehearsal dinner and was concerned about the vinegar smell when cooking the dressing, but as soon as I added the mayo, it was great. I added a little extra corn starch so it wouldn't be so runny and it was perfect. This is truly the world's best! Stop searching for other recipes because this is the one you want!

Just like the description states this was very rich and creamy.  My husband thought it was too sweet for his taste so I would reduce the amount of sugar next time.

The BEST potato salad EVER.  As with anything, just add bacon, lol.  Bacon makes everything better!  Oh..and the other reviews about cornstarch are accurate.  Add just a bit more then the recipe calls for.  Other than that...PERFECTION!!

Every time I make this salad, people become speechless. My dad was a chef and I gave him a bit to try  and give me his opinion. He agreed and when he nodded yes, I knew it was the best salad ! Thank you for this recipe.

I made this recently with my leftover boiled potatoes. We couldn't stop eating it; it's that fantastic! I was planning it for a weekday side dish, but it never made it to the next day. I even let my neighbor try it when she stopped by and she asked for the recipe.

I love this potato salad and agree that it is the World's Best Potato Salad! It is creamy and yummy. A couple of tips. 1. Cook the potatoes (red peeled) and the eggs the day before and refrigerate. 2. The next day "shred" the potatoes and hard boiled eggs through a large hole shredder. 3. If possible after mixing let it sit in the frig for at least 4 hours or overnight. It blends the flavors beautifully. This is so creamy and yummy. I go to a restaurant that serves potato salad like this and that is the reason I go to that restaurant.  Now I can make it at home any time I want. You have to try this. Make your own as I am not sharing. :-)

Loved it!!  I made this recipe when having some friends over for a barbeque, and got big thumbs up from everyone!!  My husband and I dispute over salad dressing or mayonnaise to use as dressing for potato salad.  Both us of agree that we prefer neither of them now and will always opt for this homemade dressing!  Delicious!!

This truly is the world's best potato salad.  Just like other reviewers, I have never made potato salad before but a friend asked me to bring it to his party and I was eager to impress everyone.  With this recipe, that's exactly what I did!!  EVERYONE said it was THE best potato salad they've ever EVER had.  It made me so happy.  I used several bunches of green onions and one yellow onion...  I also TRIPLED the recipe, so it took quite some time to make but it was worth it and we didn't have any left over after the party!  I used less mayo, and only 6 hard-boiled eggs (not a fan of them).  For the vinegar, I used 1/2 a cup of apple-cider vinegar, and 1/2 a cup of white wine vinegar.  Thank you for posting your recipe! I will be making this for the rest of my life.  I have to keep up my reputation now for being the woman who brings the world's best potato salad to the partay!  ;)

This was not the world's best potato salad.  It was too sweet for my taste.  Yes, I could of scaled down on the sugar, but I followed the directions exactly since it was my first time making it.  Was time consuming and not worth the extra work.  Will stick with my good ole' American potato salad recipe.  Much easier and tastier.

The sauce is WAY too much. I cut it down by half and mixed it together with the mayonaise and it was still way too much...   way too much vinegar, way  too much sugar... it was nasty.

This potato salad really is amazing. The homemade sauce is the key. After sitting overnight, the onions overpowered the flavor. Next time, I will greatly reduce the onions used or even omit.

I followed the recipe exactly and there was way too much of the liquid ingredients etc.  Way too much sugar, I wish I had read the reviews first.  I would cut it to 2 T.

I made this for about 30 people. I thought it was really good and I even messed it up. I used dried mustard instead of yellow mustard. It gave it a weird kick that some of us liked and some didn't. But, I bet if I would have done it correctly it would have been great!

I made this with a few changes and it was delicious!! Quite possibly the "World's Best Potato Salad" as the title suggests! This will be my go-to recipe for potato salad from now on. 

Like other reviewers suggested, I cut the sugar in half and even with the decreased sugar, it still had a sweetness, but wasn't overwhelming. I think a half cup of sugar would have made it way too sweet and I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. I added a few more potatoes, using a total of 10. I think if I used only 6, it would have been way too creamy. The 10 I used made it perfect, not too dry and not too creamy. I also added chopped dill pickles and green onions, along with the chopped onion and celery. I didn't have evaporated milk, so I used regular milk and increased the cornstarch to 3 teaspoons.

I think the trick that makes this much better than other recipes is the cooked dressing. It blends all the flavors of the ingredients and makes a very tasty potato salad. Can't wait to make this again! Thanks for sharing!

I am a very seasoned cook and make some really good stuff, but potato salad I always struggled with.  Mine is ok, but let me tell you what, THIS IS THE BEST.  I made it according to directions and my hubby really liked it.  We had it for Fathers Day too and it was a hit with my family.  Kudos to this great & easy recipe.  I made my dressing while the potatoes and eggs were cooling.  I actually have enough dressing left for another small batch.  YUMMY..

I made a humongous bucket of this potato salad for a barbeque this weekend and it was almost entirely gone by the evening. Monochromatic food scares me so I varied the potatoes and used 1 bag small red, 1 bag purple and one bag multicolor fingerling (about 5 lbs total). I also used more mustard, added paprika and topped the  salad with celery seed, paprika, and green onions. Next time I will decrease the sugar, and increase the salt. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for Easter dinner at our mountain home, and two of my southern cooking aunts (NC & GA) had to have this recipe right away!  I got into making it & realized I had no evaporated milk...but I doubled the starch & used about 1/2 c whole milk & it was nice & thick. I feel like such a pro. This is going into my favorites file!

LOVE THIS!! I even messed up and mixed everything for the dressing in a bowl before I realized I was supposed to heat some of it on the oven first.  I put it all in a saucepan and heated it and it was fine.  I will make this again and again.

The best potato salad I have ever had. The sugar is an amazing twist but it may just be a tad too sweet. I also like to put green onions into mine and instead of regular onions i use purple. Thanks :)

Believe all the rave reviews!  Stepdad said he'd eaten potato salad in over 30 countries and this was the best he ever ate.  Using what was on hand without time to run to store, in place of onion, mustard, evaporated milk and regular vinegar, I used onion soup mix in with mayo, mustard powder, whole milk, and rice vinegar.  I also used marg instead of butter.  Probably just as good as original recipe because it was amazing.  Made 12 servings for 6 people and it was gone in a day and a half and they couldn't tell me fast enough because they wanted more!

Very good.  I used spicy brown mustard because I don't keep yellow mustard on hand and everyone still raved about it.  I thought it was a little on the sweet side but everyone else liked the sweetness.  My husband told me not to change a thing when I make it again.

I've used a hundred recipes from this site, and this is the first one I've felt strongly enough about to review.  This is SERIOUSLY the world's best potato salad!  Because other reviewers said it made too much sauce, I used 8 potatoes instead of 6 and it worked out perfectly.  I also added about 8 slices of crispy bacon crumbles as well as a tablespoon of dried dill.  My family and I couldn't wait for it to chill in the fridge and we each ate a bowl of it for breakfast!  I am taking this dish to a Labor Day party this afternoon and I am sure everyone will love it!

This is by far the best potato salad you will ever have.. I used bout 8 good sized red potatoes and found that I actually had a little too much dressing so adjust as needed. I could probably have used at least 10 red potatoes the size of baseballs and the dressing potato mixture would have been perfect. Better to have too much dressing then not enough. I also used a Vadalia sweet onion which seems to be the perfect onion for this recipe. Awesome is all I can say.

The dressing is for coleslaw, not potato salad. There is no body, flavor or balance with so little ingredients. Sloppy and bad tasting.

This was delicious and I received many compliments when I served it at a 4th of July picnic.  It was totally worth the bit of extra work to cook the dressing.  I accidently left out the cornstarch, but it was plenty thick enough without it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Taste was good, but gave this recipe 3 stars because it makes WAY more than 12 servings.  I had a BBQ w/ 20 guests and I dbled it since it was the only side I made, and had SO MUCH left over I brought it to work for others to eat it up.  It took me and entire Saturday to make it as well as making the eggs the night before.  To much work for a good but kind of bland potato salad.  What people ate, though, they said they liked.

This is a very good homemade potato salad! I used only 4 hard cooked eggs; I think 6 would have been a lot, especially with egg also in the dressing. The recipe made a TON of dressing - I'm not sure if maybe my potatoes were too small and I should have used a couple more, or maybe my can of milk was too big or something, but it was more dressing than necessary. Not a big deal though, I just used a slotted spoon to serve it. My dressing also came out a tad grainy, maybe because I used partly skimmed evap milk? It tasted good though. I also used one bunch of green onion because that's what I had on hand, and I like it better than raw white or sweet onion. Would've used more than one bunch if I'd had it on hand though. Also added some small diced baby carrot and green and red bell pepper with the celery.. I thought this made it a bit 'busy', but that's how my dad likes it. It takes a bit more time and leaves more dirty dishes than other potato salads, BUT it's definitely one of the better tasting homemade potato salads I've tried!

Thought dressing was a little too sweet, & the evaporated milk taste really stood out too much. I ended up putting a pack of powdered Hidden valley ranch dressing in after the fact, & then was pretty good.

Amazing flavor, made it for a steak dinner with friends and everyone loved it. However, I made a couple mistakes that I'll have to remember for next time. I think I didn't quite cook long enough or let the potatoes cool too long or both. The  potatoes were really waxy and didn't absorb the dressing properly. I believe timing and the texture of the potato are crucial here.

I made this potato salad exactly as the recipe called for.  Everyone loved it!  We even got seconds while playing cards.  The only change I would make is less onions.  Great recipe!

This was amazing! I ran out of eggs, so for the dressing I used mayonnaise instead of the beaten egg. This turned out great, my husband an kids loved it and went back for 3rds! This is going in my keeper book!

I halved the sugar and it still came out too sweet.  Instead of potato pieces I mashed it all together and added paprika and salt to taste.  Very good recipe (if you limit the sugar).

I got inspired by the movie "Julie and Julia" and im now going to cook 365 recipes in 365 days, as well as taking pictures of the food i make in hopes to improve my cooking and photography skills. this was recipe number 3, i made this for dinner and it was very good! I used dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard and it added a nice taste. I also didnt add the celery and instead of evaporated milk, i used normal milk. Thanks for a great recipe!

Outstanding & truly five star. As written, it *is* too sweet for my tastes, but cut the sugar by 75% or so, & when cooking the sauce, add more to taste if desired. No issue with "runny" if one cooks as directed. Whisk continuously and remove from heat when it first begins to mound - about 7 min on med. My second time through, I incorporated several suggestions & these added to the dish. This may not be the world's best, but I've yet to taste a better one. Thanks for sharing, Kaye Lynn !!

I made this nearly as directed, only with half the sugar.  Served it at last year's Holiday party and it was a huge hit.  Everyone said it was the best potato salad they'd eaten and several people took some home with them.  Thank you Kaye Lynn for such a great recipe.  Definitely one I'll go back to over and over again!

This is by far THE BEST potato salad recipe I have ever come across.  The homemade dressing is definitely the trick.  Every singe person that I serve it to asks for the recipe.  Awesome.

I have to agree with the others.  It's too sweet.  Even cutting it down to 1/4 cup sugar, it's too sweet and the dressing is a bit runny.  The dressing would make better egg salad than potato salad.  I used top brand ingredients so I am not sure why it has such an "off" flavor to it.  I do think it would have been better with some pickles or something to cut some of the sweetness and that is probably what I shall end up doing today.

I give it 4.5 stars, easily. This was my first attempt at making potato salad (for a family event where I was trying to impress my new mother-in-law) and it worked! Per the suggestions of others, I added dill pickles and used green onions instead of regular ones. Lessened the sugar to 1/3 cup and upped the cornstarch as noted in Kaye's revision.  It tasted FAB-U-LOUS!! One thing I did notice is that it tasted better on day 2 so when I make it again, I think I'll make it a day early. Also note: for those who aren't culinary chefs (which I certainly am NOT) 6 potatoes will make quite a bit. I was afraid I would not have enough for 8 people so I made 9 and ended up eating leftovers for a week. Thanks for the great recipe, Kaye!

This was a great tasting recipe.  I made it as the recipe called, and found that there was too much sauce at the end.  I made this for a part which had 15 people attending, at the end of the  night there was no salad left, and lots of people asking for the recipe.

Definitely lived up to it's name!  I've never made potato salad before, and this turned out so yummy!!  My kids will hardly touch store potato salad and everyone gobbled up this recipe.   I added a few changes that others have mentioned--half as much sugar, half as much onion (chopped in food processor), and 2 teaspoons of corn starch.  I'm so glad I tried this recipe for my first try at potato salad!  I can't wait to bring it to our church pitch-in.

I thought this recipe was very good, and I am pretty picky when it comes to potato salad.  I used a little less than a 1/4 cup of sugar (I prefer vinegar tasting potato salads, not sweet ones).  I also took others advice about it being soupy and I added the dressing slowly to the potatoes and stopped when I felt it was the right consistency for me.  I would say I used about half the dressing and I also used one more potato when I made this.   I am saving the dressing so that if it dries out a little tomorrow after sitting overnight, i can add a bit more.  I definitely recommend that people add the dressing slowly to their liking... and not to dump the entire amount in before stirring.  Excellent recipe though! It was time consuming and made a mess of my kitchen... but totally worth it!!!!  Was tangy and creamy, but had a touch of sweetness.

Recipe title says it all!!! I went with the 1 TBSP of cornstarch but other then that, followed the recipe amounts exactly using lower fat ingredients - evaporated skim milk, half-fat mayo, and 67% fat free Bacel. OMGosh, it is the best!! So creamy and rich. The only addition I made was to add a half pound of crispy, diced bacon,(lol, my will is weak when it comes to bacon) I had extra dressing made over but found it makes the best dip for chicken fingers and tastes great on fish instead of tartar sauce. My picky kids loved it and everyone wants the recipe. Thanks for posting it.

I tried some of the recommended variations- added dill pickle and used red potatoes and green onion.  The recipe was ok, but no wow factor for me.  It just didn't have that zing in the flavor that would make it worth all the time it took to make.  I added celery salt as well, hoping that would give it some extra kick- but it just wasn't enough.

I have never been able to make a potato salad to save my soul.  I have made this 3 times and have had to print the recipe for company every time.  My mother in law said it was just like her mom used to make which was echoed by so many reviews.   I used less than a 1/4 cup sugar and it was sweet enough.  I used regular milk, 1 tsp celery salt and uped the mustard to 1 T.    It is a keeper recipe for sure.

This is the third time that I have made this potato salad and each time I am amazed at how well it turns out.  I brought it to work and there was nothing left once the first person got a taste of it.  Thanks so much for posting it here.  I'll make it again and again.

I tweaked this recipe only because of our personal taste. I used 2 1/4 tsp. cornstarch and mixed it into the sugar so it wouldn't be lumpy when added to the liquids. Added l cucumber diced, and salted the onion, celery, eggs & cucumber to taste. It was excellent. Thank you Kaye Lynn. This will be our #1 potato salad from now on.

Wow!
Like a lot of people, I have been looking for a really good potato salad recipe. This is by far and away the best I have ever tried. 

I have made it a few times already, and everyone who has tried it has agreed and asked for the recipe. 

Thanks very much for sharing it with everyone. The only addition I have made to the salad is purely for esthetics and that is to add paprika and green onion springled over the top just before serving.

I have made this recipe a few times now and love it! This last time I made it for 4th of July BBQ and it was a big hit. There is one downside to this, it is addicting and I wanted to pick at it all day long.                            I needed to make a huge amount for our bbq so I made 2 5lb bags of potatoes with 20 eggs and then just tripled the dressing (made with 12oz evaporated milk as it was the only can I had on hand, It still came out creamy and delicous.    Thanks for this recipe, this has been the only potato salad I will make anymore.

I had a friend and her kids over for a cookout, and her 11 year old son told me that I'm the best potato salad maker in the whole world!! Excellent recipe! I was out of cornstartch and used flour instead and it turned out fine. I minced the onions so the kids wouldn't notice them and I could still enjoy the flavor. I also added two more eggs. This is honestly the best potato salad I've ever had.

I didn't change a thing in this recipe- and I'm so glad I didn't!  Everyone in my family loved it.  My husband usually hates potato salad because he finds it bland, but he absolutely loved this.  I usually have to cover store bought potato salad in salt and pepper, but this was perfect right out of the bowl. Everyone complained that I didn't make enough!

Absolutely divine!!!  In the past, I always mixed a little bit of this and that and seemed to have pretty good luck, but came across this "special sauce" recipe and had to give it a try.  Prepared the recipe for our upcoming Easter dinner and allowed several family members to sample in advance.  The panel who sampled consisted of toddlers, teenagers and adults and all loved it and are begging for more!  I am especially impressed that the toddlers love the potato salad and want more!  Like other reviewers, I decreased the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup.  I cooked the potatoes and egg a day in advance and cubed and chilled.  Also, I combined all of sauce ingredients at one time on the stovetop and did not wait for the sauce to cool since the potatoes and egg had been refrigerated overnight and, thus, cool.  Now, we just wait in anticipation for Easter dinner.  THANKS for the fabulous recipe...don't think I will 'wing it' anymore...will make this potato salad from now on, and share the recipe with everyone I know!

I liked the potato salad, but I have come to realize that I don't like sugar in my potato salad....I have tried many recipes.  Next time, I will omit the sugar and I am sure it will be wonderful!!!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks

Excellent recipe.  Will definately do again, especially for a pot luck.  Made a bit much for my family of four.  Next time I make it for the four of us, I'll cut the recipe in half.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe.  This is my new potato salad forever.  My husband likes it and he doesn't like much of anything.  I did add 1 tsp celery seed and a few chopped sweet pickles.

This is the best homemade potato salad I have ever had.  I didn't have any celery, so I didn't use any, and also diced up 2 large dill pickles and added to it.  This has to sit overnight for the flavors to mix properly.  At first, I wasn't too sure about the taste, but the next day it was fabulous!  Will 100% make again.  I've already added it to my hand-written recipe box!

Truly the BEST! I did add a lot of minced sweet pickles and gherkins. For the vinegar I used 1/2 white & 1/2 apple cider vinegars. Amazing! I've had everyone raving over this tater salad! A must have for any summer event! Thanks for sharing!

This was great. I did make a few changes like adding sweet relish, celery seed and cutting the onion in half. My husband asked if I had stole his aunt's recipe. A friend of ours had a little that we had left over a couple days later, and said it was so good he went out the next day to get some from a store. He was so upset with it he ended up throwing out the store brought brand saying that after eating my potato salad and then eating that it didn't even compare and that I definitely had to make him some more so he could satisfy his craving. 
I have finally found a potato salad that can stand up to my husband's aunts recipe and I don't have to wait for holidays to get it!!! This will be my go to recipe from now on. Thanks this is a winner.

I was scared about cooking the dressing since my potato salad dressing has always been mayo-vinegar-spices (and uncooked!) but I worried for nothing! This salad turned out awesome. I used an extra potato and there was too much dressing when it was first mixed, but I put it in the fridge for several hours and it was just about right when we sat down to eat. My husband enjoyed it, our company enjoyed it, and our daughter would not touch it. Oh, well, that's pretty standard for her. :) I thought it was fab. Thanks, Kaye!

My husband is a potato salad officianato. He is so particular about his potato salad. I rarely make potato salad because I would have to make it all the time for him. He eats it every day and I just don't have the time. He had trouble finding a potato salad that he liked after our local supermarket deli stopped making the sliced potato salad, so I found this recipe and made it. He LOVES it and I have made it a number of times. I didn't change anything in the recipe. It is perfect like it is. It really ranks among the best potato salads I have ever eaten. 5 Stars does it justice!

I think I would have reduced the sugar. It was too sweet for my taste. I also added black pepper to enhance the taste.

Over halfway thru and I was complaining on the time and effort I spent and said I was never going to make it again.  BUT, after I completed it, with a few changes to the recipe, I have totally changed my mind.

THIS IS THE BEST EVER potato salad!  It is the homemade dressing that is the secret...creamy, creamy and luscious.  I could have eaten the whole bowl of just the dressing on its own!

The modifications I did were because I was out of the following items and I stole some ideas from other recipes:

For the dressing,

1.   I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup vinegar (used apple cider vinegar instead of white) instead
2.  About 3/4 cup sour cream instead of evaporated milk (forgot to buy it)
3.  About 1/3 cup mayonnaise (ran out and forgot to buy more) with about 1/4 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 mixed with it.

The dressing was still thick and not runny at all.

4.  Then I added 10 chopped up Sweet Gherkin pickles.
5.  1 teaspoon of celery seed
6.  1/2 teaspoon of celery salt
7.  Freshly ground pepper
8.  Added some green onions to the vidalia onion I used. 

The last hard boiled egg I used my egg slicer on and put the slices on the top to look pretty.  

I WILL be making this potato salad again!

I'm in my mid 60's and I've been trying to make a good potato salad for a very long time!  This is fabulous!  My mother's was very much like this, but I never got her recipe before she passed. Thank you so much for helping an 'old' lady finally make a great potato salad!

"This is the ONE!" Making an egg custard for the dressing is flat out ingenious, and I can't wait to put my own little spins on the combinations and presentations one might do.

I am hosting a 50th Wedding Anniversary Party for my parents and I am going to make this side, for the Pig Roast which by itself will be a show stopper. But to have the Show stopper of Potatoe Salad even better. 

I plan to nest the Potatoe Salad in larger bowls filled with that ultra nice Sonic Crushed Ice, we will be outside and I think if I keep the serving dishes numerous and smaller vs. one super large bowl I can keep multiple smaller bowls colder and stable then one extra large bowl. Plus better access from multiple people in the line.

ANY COMMENTS ON FOOD STABILITY HERE, would be greatly appreciated and helpful for us all wouldn't you all agree.

So, I thought about this food stability issue a little more and I am just using my gut experience here that since the eggs are cooked and the custard is formed that this is perhaps as stable or even more stable. So whether a potluck or the buffet table at your get together I think this recipe will be a surefire winner.

This is the closest potato salad to the Norwegian deli I lived near as a child in Brooklyn, New York. Delicious!  After reading the reviews I cut the sugar in half and used almost 5 lbs of red potatoes. I did not add egg because Olga at the deli didn't use them in hers!

This potato salad was very yummy.  The only alteration I made to it was I altered the serving size.  I followed it according to the directions for a larger serving size (10 servings), and I felt the dressing yielded a lot more than what I typically like on my potato salad.  I don't like potato salad that swims so I didn't end up using all of the dressing. However, it still tasted yummy and I would use this recipe again.

My family and I found it to be cloyingly sweet, unnecessarily and overly rich, somewhat grainy, and heavy on the onion and celery. The extra ingredients and steps, as compared to a standard mayo based recipe, are not worth it in my opinion.

Oh my goodness, this is a wonderful recipe!  I started thinking I would cut back the sugar, but added the full 1/2 cup the recipe called for in the end for the perfect mix of sweet, tangy, and creamiest potato salad I've ever tasted. The only addition I made was some fresh dill from the garden and a couple dashes of celery salt.  It was perfect!!

I loved this recipe, and have made it twice in the past couple of weeks. It was a hit with my family, but I do have a comment. When I looked at the recipe I thought to myself that 1/2 c sugar would be way too much, so I only added 1/4 cup. Even then, the sugar content was way too much. I'm not a Miracle Whip fan and thought the sugar made it taste like it was prepared with it, instead of mayo. The second time I made it I added 1 tablespoon of sugar, plus a teaspoon of celery seed. It's a more labor intensive recipe than your typical potato salad, but it's SOOOOO good.

I'm making this for a baby shower tomorrow. I usually just throw my potato salad ingredients together. This is the first time I have used and actual recipe. I had everything but the evaporated milk. I added two tsp. cornstarch. 1/3 cup sugar. Green onions instead of white. (I love onions but to please a crowd I figured it was better to omit them. I added a bit of celery seed as per Kaye's suggestion. I used 5 oz of milk instead of the evaporated. I used Russet potatoes.  I just mixed it all together and took a bite. Mmmmm, Perfect flavor! I can't wait until the sauce marries the potato and really soaks in. By tomorrow it will be ready to serve and I am quite happy with the results! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made this exactly like it says, with one exception. I chopped some fresh dill and mixed it in. There is so much sugar in this, that's all that comes across. Very sugary sweet, but even if you left most of the sugar out, I think it would be very bland. If all you want is creamy, go for it. I'll pass.

After reading multiple reviews, I made the following changes.  I used 5 lbs red potatoes, 1 tsp celery seed, increased the corn starch to 2 teaspoons, used 1/4 c. white vinegar and 1/4c apple cider vinegar, and decreased the sugar to 1/3 of a cup.  I chopped regular "sweet" onion very fine and added 1/2 cup and added 3 green onions - my husband does like onion flavor - might be to much for someone else. The other addition I added was 1/4 c. sweet pickle relish and 1/4 c. finely chopped red pepper. Pickle relish added flavor red pepper added color.

Very rich, creamy, unique flavor!

I am really glad I chose to try to recipe because the flavor was exactly what I was looking for! I doubled the cornstarch, only used 5 eggs total since that was all I had on hand and also used powdered milk because I did not have evaporated milk, but no matter, it came out delissssh. I added some chopped dill pickle, chopped pepperoncini, a dash of paprika and pepper to suit my taste. It's so good, I couldn't wait for it to chill and on my second helping!

Hands down, one of the best potato salad I've ever had. The sauce was really perfect. I did what several people suggested and doubled the corn starch. And I added finely chopped bacon. I had cooked bacon in the oven earlier and used it. I put it into the sauce pan first and rendered out some more bacon fat, and them cut back on the butter just a bit. I think it could have used just a touch more onion, and maybe 1 more piece of celery. The recipe is more involved than throwing mayonnaise on boiled potato, but is not difficult and we'll worth effort.

Great old-fashioned potato salad.  I doubled the cornstarch, completely cooled the cooked mixture before adding mayo, added some sweet pickle relish just 'cuz we like it, and poured the dressing mixture over the potatoes while they were still warm so it would soak in.  It was a real winner, got lots of compliments and people wanted to take home the leftovers.  I sprinkled crumbled bacon on the top but won't do it again, I just think it is better without it.

I had never ever made a potato salad before. I was asked to bring it to a party I was going to. At first I thought I would just go buy some to take but then I looked up recipes and found yours "Worlds Best Potato Salad". I set my laptop up in the kitchen and followed it step by step, after a few trys (as my eggs cooked at first), threw that mixture out and started over.  I never got so many compliments!! It was fabulous!

I just cannot make this recipe turn out. I think the measurements are off and maybe one should use HELLMAN's as the mayo not Kraft. It just turns out runny and vinegary.

I really, really wanted to like this.  I felt it had potential, but was just too sweet and almost ordinary tasting considering that you make the sauce from scratch.  I even put less sugar in than called for.  I ended up mixing in some chopped dill pickles and their juice hoping it would lessen the sweetness and it helped some.  This was almost like the stuff you buy at the grocery store, which I was hoping to avoid.  I may try to make this again using way, way, way less sugar or none at all, adding dill pickles and using a full 5 pounds of red potatoes and green onions in place of the raw.

I was a bit of a skeptic on this one when I read it, tried it this weekend, now a HUGE fan. As a rule I usually make your standard mustard style potato salad.Was going to a large family gathering and decided to make three different types, ranch/bacon, my dill mustard standard, and this one.  By far my new favorite. Not too sweet or tart  just right.

The sauce....seemed to have the taste and texture of flour, and I used the recipe as written. Wondering instead of milk, maybe could have used sour cream???? Oh, well... Lots of work, for the result. I would rather just use sugar, vinegar, mayo or salad dressing, and mustard. Hopefully remaining in the refrigerator for 8 hours will improve the problem.

I have made this recipe several times and changed it to get the taste I grew up with.  My mother and grandmothers made great potato salad.  I have no idea what made it so good. I certainly could not recreate it. This is as close as it gets to their recipe.  
This recipe is now MY recipe.  I made a few changes. I don't use as much sugar.  I also deleted the onions and added chives. I made it with the evaporated milk and changed it to half and half and whole milk.  I use one egg in the dressing mixture. I cannot find Hellmans Mayonaise and use Best Foods...it is as close to Hellmans..
The key to this recipe is serving it chilled.
It is creamy and delicious.

Not bad, but a lot of work!  In my opinion, way too much sugar, and I love sugar!  I even went as far to reduce sugar to 1/4 C and it was still a little too sweet! 
I also don't like the additional fat, cholesterol content of the butter, milk, and beaten eggs!  You already have the addition of 6 hard boiled eggs!  I understand that this is necessary for the "secret" sauce, but as the saying goes, "less is more". 
 I will probably stick to the classic Hellman's potato salad recipe.

I felt this was a very watery recipe. Needed more potatoes than 6. I added 2 more and it was still soupy, I think you need to add more starch for sure! 
Also, this was a very sweet potato salad.

This recipe was great!  I added an additional 1/4 cup of mayonnaise as the salad was a bit dry.  Once I did the flavors all melded together beautifully.  I will definately make this again.

This was my first time making homemade potato salad - I really enjoyed the flavors!  I took advice and added 2 tsp of cornstarch instead of 1, which made a thicker sauce - turned out perfect! Also added 1/2 cup relish - YUM!

Love this!!!! I also went ahead and added diced pickles, bell pepper, and I increased the amount of cornstarch to 4 to 5 tsp. This amount of cornstarh will make it even thicker and creamier makes it stick to the potatoes better, and will not be runny when you add the mayo. This is a keeper and gives a whole new flavor to potato salad. So if your tired of the original boring potato salad, TRY THIS!!!

Just finished making this potato salad for the first time. It is crazy good. The cooked dressing takes this salad into a whole different class. I have never been a big fan of potato salad so I very seldom make it. This salad changes everything. I will want to take it everywhere! Just delicious!

This is the the best potato salad ever.  I used to rant and rave over my mom's salad, but now I have this receipe she doesn't even make hers anymore... now she bugs me about when I am going to make salad.  If you haven't tried this receipe yet.. it is a must do  .. YOU WILL LOVE the dressing and it is easy to make.

I've made this twice now and really enjoy the creaminess of the sauce. My DD, who has always loved my potato salad, loved it, too!! I used Yukon potatoes and followed the recipe exactly the first time (I always add celery seed to my potato salad and followed the KL's advice to add it in her review). The second time I also followed her advice to add more cornstarch. The first time I overcooked it trying to get it thicker. The flavor was great but it had a grainy texture. I just added more mayo to smooth it out and it was fine. I also added more celery on onion, but I like it crunchy! Thank you, Kaye Lynn, this is my new "go to" potato salad!

Great consistency and salad stays moist but definitely too sweet (and I usually prefer my drsg.
sweet) I will make this again but reduce sugar to 1/4 cup. Plus the amt. of drsg. was more than enough. It could easily cover 3 lbs. of potatoes.

Most excellent potato salad. I am not generally a fan because it is too blah, but this was great. Be sure to read the review from the author, she had an error in the recipe. I didn't need all the sauce and mayonnaise it made unless you like it super creamy.  My in-laws loved it as well and wanted the recipe. In my book it is the world's best!

This potato salad is awesome! It is a bit more labor intensive than just throwing together ingredients in a bowl but it is SO worth it. It's better than many restaurants. I made it without the eggs and it was great-- a little sweet, tangy, and very creamy! I salted it after all ingredients were mixed and it only needed a little salt. Thanks, Kaye Lynn!

UPDATE: MY IN-LAWS LOVED THIS! MY FATHER-IN-LAW (WHO DOES NOT CARE FOR HARD-BOILED EGGS) EVEN LIKED THIS. I WAS TOLD TO ALWAYS GIVE THEM LEFTOVERS - THEY LIKED THIS THAT MUCH! :) Yum! Sooooo good!!! This tastes EXACTLY like my local grocer's potato salad! Since this makes a TON, I am sharing lefotvers with my parents and in-laws. :) Other than adding ~ 1/2 c. chopped dill pickles (I LOVE my potato salad with pickles in it, but felt sweet gherkins would clash with the dressing) and a t of celery seed (as suggested by the recipe submitter) and doubling the amount of cornstarch called for, I made no major changes. The dressing didn't even take the full 10 minutes to thicken. Doubling up on the cornstarch definitely helped. NOTE: I used equal amounts of apple / distilled white vinegar since Kaye did not specify what type to use. I also chose red potatoes over the Russset / baking variety this time (I usually prefer the latter, but because Kaye specifically suggested using reds, I gave them a try). I have no complaints. This turned out perfectly and paired nicely with my BBQ chicken sandwiches! Thanks SO much for sharing your secret recipe, Kaye! :-)

I've never liked a potato salad, and this one is amazing. After reading reviews, I changed the following: 2 tsp cornstarch, added the tsp celery seed, substituted green onions for regular, and added 1/2 cup diced dill pickle. Also, I chopped everything rather small. Definitely will be making this over and over again.

this potato salad surprized me, it had a nice sweet tangy flaver. i did change a couple things. i browned the onions in olive oil, i didn't add the celery, but i did add some sliced olives and diced red peppers out of the jar and the last thing i added wile i was cooking the sauce was celery seed and pepper. turned out great and i plan to make this again : )

Excellent! Made this for family, which includes a couple firefighter. And if anyone knows firefighters, its all about the food. Had nothing but compliments on the potato salad...with the exception of one suggesting adding blue cheese crumbles. I did add bacon that I cooked but to save time I'm sure I could have used bacon crumbles.

Instead of buying the usual overpriced potato salad dressing, I decided to try an online recipe. The dressing from this recipe is absolutely delicious! I will never use store bought again. Thank you!

what kind of potatoes does everyone use with this. what counts as a serving here 1 cup 1/2 cup? I did some research & found out that this recipe makes WAY too much dressing & that the potatoes should be doubled. Use 5.6 lbs. half Russet the other half red. Be careful with those two eggs for the sauce. I'd get my hands on pasteurized eggs and not risk it. you can totally make the sauce with out even gooking it! Use Whirl & pasturized eggs!

I am incredibly fussy about my potato salad.  I don't like it too sweet.  I can't stand it too vinegary.  Usually it's either swimming in mayonnaise or so dry you need a glass of milk to get it down, but this potato salad is TO DIE FOR!

I'd like to give this 4 1/2 stars only because I changed a few things as some suggested. I used 2 oz cider vinegar and 2 oz plain; the 1 tsp celery seed; 1/3 c sugar (next time I will only use 1/4 c)and I doubled the cornstarch. It didn't specify what kind of butter to use and since I didn't have any, I used 4 tbs stick parkay. My salad turned out really good but a little too sweet. I mixed my dressing in while the potatoes were too warm and made the potatoes a little mushier than I like. I should have cooled potatoes more. My husband liked it very much but when I asked if he liked this one more than my regular, he said "Isn't this your regular?" LOL My son, however, loved the vinegary taste, didn't think it was too sweet and thought the sauce had a deviled egg taste. Kaye, I think I will make your "world's best" for our family reunion and see how it goes over. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at making potato salad.  Everyone who had it loved it.  My husband is dying for me to make it again.  As other posters noted it is a little sweet.  The sweetness was not a problem for us.  If your not into a little sweetness then cut the sugar.
Wonderful recipe...thanks for sharing it!

I love this recipe.  Like many others I made some additions...dill pickle relish, green bell peppers..I omitted the hard boiled eggs as we don't care for those in potato salad.  The dressing just plain makes it!  USE LESS SUGAR! You'll love it.

This a an outstanding recipe.  Of course, you can add other ingredients to your liking, but recipe stands on its own as is.  I am not fond of "relishy" tasting potato salad, and potato salad without relish can taste rather plain, so this is a recipe that has both flavor and isn't overdone.  
I have made it serveral times for my family and knew I hit a home run when I found my teenage daughter and her best friend sitting on the tile floor  of the kitchen one morning, eating the rest of it out of the bowl:)  
Definitely worth the extra steps to get it right!

A very good recipe, but the sugar is excessive, in my opinion. My husband usually devours potato salad, and he is a "sugarholic", but this one was too sweet..just adjust to your own taste, as the writer said.

I've tried upteen potato salad recipes, but this one is the keeper!  I think the cooked sauce is what does it.  Someone commented that it tasted a bit like egg salad, but I love eggs in my potato salad.  I've never heard of a cooked sauce, so I was a bit leery, but I'm so glad I tried it!

This recipe lives up to it's name!  I was a sceptic, especially while I was cooking the sauce for it, but it was delicious!  I added green peppers to mine.  Thanks for the recipe Kaye!

I made it with the recommended adjustments - 1/3 c sugar, half cider vinegar and half white vinegar, green onion instead of white, and I added bacon and the celery seed. However, I doubled the recipe, and I'm not sure what it should taste like normally, but the sweetness from the sugar and the taste from the cider vinegar was overwhelming, so next time I'd reduce the sugar even more and change the ration of white vinegar to cider vinegar to 3:1 rather than 2:2.

Looking for a new potato salad recipe (my boyfriend likes the deli style; more mustard than mayo) I made this and also the "The Best Potato Salad" recipes for a tailgate.  In the taste test, this recipe lost 1-6, which is good for me since it was WAY more difficult to make.  The other recipe didn't involve cooking the sauce and had fewer ingredients and wasn't as sweet.

This potato salad is awesome.  Whether you adjust things or don't adjust things, its just amazing.  It's better when you make it the day before and keep it overnight in the fridge.  Yum, yum, yum!

I agree about reducing the sugar and adding the extra cornstarch...worked out well, although I might reduce the sugar even more to a 1/4 cup. I think lots of pepper was a good thing. I'll make this again.

Fabulous!  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, added 1/2 a cup of pickle relish, used 1/2 a cup of tiny diced red onion for the onion, and it was fabulous and loved by all this 4th of July!

Delicious recipe!  As suggested in several other reviews, I reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup, doubled the cornstarch to 2 tsp, and added 1 tsp of celery seed.  I also removed the yolks from the hard-cooked eggs (wife doesn't like 'em) and used 10 red potatoes (skin-on) as another reviewer suggested.  The potatoes were cooked for 30 minutes (they weren't soft enough after 20).  The type of vinegar wasn't suggested; I used apple cider, but I like the stronger taste that you get from that.  You'd probably want white wine vinegar if you don't like it strong.  Again, great recipe - thanks!!

OMG. They weren't lying. This potatoes salad is the bomb! I just left out the onion and forgot to get celery. I cut all ingredence in half. I didn't realize that I made so many potatoes so I didn't get enough evaporated milk so after the first can I used a little bit of 2% milk. I didn't use a lot of sugar. We're BBQ a day early for Fathers day and my dad loves loves loves this new potatoe salad and so does my picky mother. Thanks for the recipe.

The evaporated milk had too strong of a taste in this potato salad.  Perhaps the recipe would taste better with regular milk instead.

I was not a fan of this potato salad recipe. I found the dressing to be a bit too sweet for my taste. I also felt like the salad was missing something when I ate it. Maybe it would be better with some dill pickle relish? I will not be making this recipe again.

This is a very tasty Potato Salad. I too did some tweaking, added 2 Tbs sweet pickle relish, chopped in some red and green pepper for added color & taste and decreased the sugar to 1/3 C.  I agree with other reviewers that it is a lot of work and dirtied up lots of bowls/pots and thats why I only gave it 4 stars. I'll have to work with it to try & stream-line things. I will make this again, thanks for sharing.

Yes! This is definitely the best potato salad of this genre. Creamy smooth texture. The recipe goes together quickly and it is easy to fix. The vinegar gives the right bite to the taste along with the celery for some crunch. Took this to our church carry-in and received a lot of compliments. This will be our top-drawer potato salad. Thanks.

My family gave this 5 stars!  Just a hint .. don't rush the cooked sauce.  I should have let mine cook a bit more to make it half a hair more thick  No fault of the recipe -- I was in a hurry.  Sweet flavored potato salad and still creamy the next day.

Have always wanted to try to make my own potato salad and based on the previous reviews I decided to give this one a try.  Made exactly to this recipe this weekend for a family cookout.  It turned out better than expected.  It was a little bit of work but a real simple recipe to follow and when I think of potato salad this satisfies that traditional taste!  My guests were even back for seconds!  YUM.

I used to make a cooked dressing years ago and was looking for something similar. This was very close. I used 1/8 cup vegetable oil instead of 1/4 cup butter. I had sauce leftover and used it to make macaroni salad. Yum.

I made this for my friends on Sunday for the first time.  It was actually the first time I had ever tried to make potato salad in my life.  I was amazed at how wonderful it is, how creamy and full of flavor it was.  I cannot wait to make it again modified with my own special touches...  My only regret is that I did not make more of it on sunday!  Thank you for this recipe!  The reviews really convinced me to try it and I am so glad I did!

It was very tasty.  Time consuming to make though! I cut back on the sugar as well and it turned out fine. I used 8 potatoes and it made way too much dressing!  Next time I will use more potatoes but not more dressing.  I will make it again.

My favourite potato salad hands down.    The only thing I changed was I made my own evap. milk out of milk powder and water.  everything else I did exactly as the recipe suggests.    The dressing I made was a bit curdly,  and separated after refrigeration,  but that didn't affect the taste in any way.    I will absolutely make this again.

I should have read all of the reviews.  This is very sweet.  I may have errored in using apple cider vinager, but the recipe did not state "white" vinegar.  I hope as previous reviewers stated that it was better the next day.  I have been drowning it in salt to rid it of the sweetness.  I think next tiime I will half the sugar.  It is very creamy though.

I tried this recipe, but was a little reluctant because of all the fattening ingredients. It was good, but not much better than my family recipe which has about half the fat and calories as this. I think I'll stick to my recipe!

I have made this potato salad several times now and I never have any leftovers! Its my familys new favorite salad, people go crazy for it at every church function, family reunion, barbecue or just plain supper I make it for! Definatly worth the time to make! I did replace onions with scallions and added carrots, and out of necessity I used regular whole milk, but It is easily the best potato salad I have ever tasted! My only tips to anyone making it is not to worry if the dressing smells a little odd when cooking it and to make sure everything has several hours to sit in the fridge before serving.   Thanks for sharing this precious recipe! God bless!

Loved it, a little too sweet so maybe cutting down on the sugar.  I added pickles which someone else suggested--I liked the pickles, my daughter picked them out.  I also used red potatoes.  This was my first potato salad and it was a hit!

This took a while to put all together, but it was worth it.   Followed the advice of some of the people here...dropped the sugar to 1/3 cup, upped the corn startch to 2 tsp. Added some Bacon, and some Serrano chillis as well that I deseeded and diced, also added relish, and celery seeds. Also used red potatoes instead.   Flat out best potato salad that I have ever tried (and the first one I had ever tried making!). Will be made again, and again, and again!

I thought this recipe was too sweet for potatoes salad, although my family did keep coming back over the next couple of days and snacking on it until it was gone.  I usually serve potatoes salad when we are having a BBQ and the other food is rich and sweet, so therefore the potatoes salad needs to be not so sweet.  In my family someone always brings the bean salad to a gathering, this is a recipe famous to my family and consist of red beans, celery, celery salt, onion, sweet pickle relish or sweet jerkins cut up, and boiled egg just to name a few ingredients. All tied together with mayo, a little sugar, and either vinegar or some of the juice from the sweet pickle’s. My point is, I think the egg mixture from the potatoes recipe would work well with the bean salad recipe. The next time I make bean salad I am going to use this mixture and try it out on the family.

Too much sauce and WAY too sweet....If I make it again I will probably omit the sugar and use 9 or 10 potatos.  I also felt like it needed some paprika.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.   My modifications based on personal taste are as follows:   2 tsp. corn starch, cut sugar to 1/4 cup, add 1 cup diced sweet gherkins and 2 dashes of dill weed into the dressing as it cooks.  It's the best!

Only my second attempt at making potato salad, trying to mimic my mom's recipe.  It wasn't spot on, but it was pretty good!  The potatoes were cooked perfect at about 25 minutes. The dressing was creamy and flavorful.  I'll make this again!

This is the best recipe I have ever used. I will definitely make this again! I didn't find it too sweet at all. The only change I will make next time is to use red potatoes.  All other potatoes turn out too "mushy" but the reds seem to hold up well while mixing this salad together.

Great recipe.  I added sliced pickles and used a splash of milk instead of evaporated milk because I didn't have any on hand, but it still turned out great.  I will definitely make this again!

This is one of the best potato salad recipes I have found in a long time. The only thing that I did differant was add some red and yellow sweet peppers to it for crunch and color. My husband loved it and we almost ate the whole salad in one sitting. Thank you Kaye!

This is the best potato salad I have EVER made!!  I followed the other suggestions but needed a smaller amount so I only used 4 potato's and 4 boiled eggs--that's the only reduction I took--having the extra dressing made it extra creamy and good!!  I also used 1/8 cup bacon grease and 1/8 cup butter in the dressing (it called for 1/4 c butter) for an extra "bacony" flavor--YUM-O!!!

I had some company in town and had a bunch of potatoes so I decided to make this. I've never made potato salad before, so I was a little nervous. When cooking the vinegar, and even when I added it, it had quite a vinegar smell. We ate it 4-5 hours later, it turned out absolutely fantastic!! I can't wait to make it again. I think I used a little less onion and added the second teaspoon of corn starch..

i got good feedback from my guests about this dish.  it was very creamy.  but for me, something was missing.  there was no zing.  i would make this again for the creamy texture alone, but i would experiment to add some different flavor.

This potato salad is PERFECTION!! After testing all sorts of recipes this is my absolute favorite. I took the suggestions from other reviewers by reducing the sugar to 1/3 cup, using scallions, 1 extra tsp of cornstarch and adding celery seed. My family loved it and I'm bringing it to a cookout this weekend. I'm sure it will be a hit. Yum!!!

Everyone who ate it loved it. The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar. I found that 1/2 cup was too sweet (but my husband thought it was perfect). I would change it to 1/3 cup. But it was delicious-thanks!

My family loved this salad, I thought it was a a little too sweet, but that's just me. I was able to make it less sweet with some more vinegar, salt and lessening the sugar. It was by far the creamiest salad recipe I have ever tried and will for sure use again!

YUUUUMMMM!!This is so good!Did follow advice of another reviewer and put
*little less than 1/2 the sugar
*little less vinegar
*double the starch
*green onions instead instead of a yellow onion
*added 4-6 slices of bacon
*added relish to the dressing(to taste)
The other reviewer said it was it was too die for and I agree hands down!

This was awesome.  It was my first making it but everyone loved it!  I only added 1/4c of sugar instead of 1/2... to me it was better.  Will make again for sure!!

This recipe was really good, but I honestly can't say it is the world's best, especially for the amount of time involved in making the special sauce.  I did get a lot of compliments on it, but still can't beat grandma's recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  It was definitley the creamiest I've had by far.

Very yummy potato salad.  A couple of tweaks - a little less sugar than called for, add a bit of green onion and a dash of paprika on top for colour.  I had to double the recipe and ended up with way too much dressing - something to consider...

This recipe was good, but took way too much time. I ended up not using all the dressing because it would have been too soggy.

I will say that this is a great potato salad recipe however it is a bit sweet for my taste. The next time I make it I will use less sugar. I used 1/3 C of sugar instead of 1/2 and it was great!

This is an EXCELLENT potatoe salad recipe. I made this for a 4th of July barbecue and several people said it was the best potatoe salad they EVER HAD. It take a long time to make - but be patient - it is worth the work. I backed down the sugar just a tad (just my personal preference). Kudos to Kate - one of the best recipes EVER!

I really did not care for this potato salad. It was too sweet and too runny and I even added more cornstarch to try to thicken it up. I also thought it was a bit bland so I added more mustard and some dill relish.

I loved this recipe! I have been looking long and hard for the perfect potato salad recipe and I finally found it here.  It has all the ingredients and taste that traditional potato salad should.  This will be a regular salad for our summer BBQ cooking, for sure!

This potato salad was AMAZING. I only wish I had made more.Roomate said "best potato salad Ive ever had!" The only change I made was I used the red "butter" potatoes and it was very nice and creamy. I loved the sweetness and all the flavors. It was a bit of work, so maybe Ill double the recipe next time, Im pregnant and its a great thing to keep stock of in the fridge for a quick midnight snack :) Will make again.. and again ... and again! thanks for the recipe!

This potatoe salad tastes really strange, too much sugar, vinager, and mustard.I also put jalepenos chopped up into the potatoe slalad if you like spice, and I usually like to put in a lot of old bay. Unless you like a cheap flavor go ahead and try this recipe, but it almost ruined my potato salad.

I have been making potato salad another way for many years and decided to try this because the sauce was a different twist. I made it exactly as written, just cut back on the sugar a bit, and it still seemed a tad too sweet for me. But, no doubt, this potato salad is good, and I would make it again when I have guest. As for myself and my family, I would stick to my old recipe that basically taste the same, and it just as creamy,  without all the added fat and calories of the butter and sugar in this recipe.

I've never posted a comment before, but this recipe merits one-If I could give this 6 stars, I would! I'm a pretty decent cook, but have failed miserably in the potato salad department- and it happens to be a favorite of my hubbys. This recipe is FANTASTIC- is as classic as the salad your mother and grandmother made- I didn't have any evaporated milk so I used 1%- and I added some peas and used horseradish mustard and a bit of extra horseradish- it is DELISH! My hubby is already asking for more-

The weather had warmed up and I wanted to make a really good refreshing potato salad.  I found this one and I was a little afraid to shy away from the family recipe but it turned out awesome and my friends truly enjoyed it as well.  I added a few more vegetables like radishes and celery.  Highly recommend trying this one!!

Made this for church fellowship and wasn't quite what I was looking for. It was really sweet and really onion-y. I love potato salad and the texture on this was really nice but just not big on the taste. It didn't specify what type of vinegar to use, so I used cider vinegar and maybe that's why mine turned out so sweet. Ate it anyway but probably won't make again. Sorry!

The dressing for this sounded so interesting that I had to try it. I loved this recipe. I did omit the hard boiled eggs and one of the eggs from the dressing / sauce as I'm not a huge egg fan and it still turned out great.

I have never made potato salad other than the german pot. salad.  I thought your recipe was terrific!  I made a few adjustments and took the advice from other reviews.  I used 5 lbs. red potatoes,(they hold better shape after boilling) half a sweet onion, 1/2 Apple cider vinegar, and 1/2 regular vinegar, and 1/3C. sugar.  I did not have any pickles or celery seed on hand and this salad is still terrific.  This will become my potato salad recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipes is so close to the one I have used for over 33 years and my Mom and Grandma used before that. But I use Dry Mustard in mine and green onion, plus green pepper. I also use it for Mac.Salad,and everyone loves it.

Not bad, but be carefull to check how much onion and what kind you use before making this!  Everything was wonderfull but that.  I love onion, but it absolutely ruined this as it was too much and too strong.  I ended up throwing this out.  Maybe try scallions instead.

I agree with last reviewer - pretty good and easy to make - but we would prefer less mustard and I already used less than suggested.  It's just a matter of taste.  Thanks submitter.

Pretty good, my husband didn't like it, too onion-y for him. I used less sugar and mayonaise, added a pickle and more mustard. Don't forget the celery seeds.

Delicious! Made this for son's birthday bash, there was hardly any leftovers. People loved the flavor. I used only 1/2 the onion, but doubled every thing else to make enough for 15 guests. I also added chopped sweet gherkins as well! Yummy, a keeper!

This is a great recipe.  If you don't like the measurements outlined, then find another recipe.  This is wonderful as is!  Always get wonderful results when I make it.  A crowd pleaser for sure!

If you cook the dressing for 10 minutes like the video suggests it becomes quite thick...at least mine did and I used the exact measurements called for on the sauce.  While cooking, the sauce had an odd texture which made me a bit nervous but once it cooled and was added to the mayo it was very smooth and creamy. I used 7 medium sized red potatoes but maybe could have added another 1 or 2 and still had plenty of sauce.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 yellow and 1/2 dijon mustard and to sub some green onions for regular onion. It is a bit on the sweet side and I think next time I will use white vinegar. I only had AC vinegar and the recipe didnt specify so...I think white vinegar would make the sauce less sweet. this is a delicious recipe and it will be my new "go to" for potato salad.

For me, this was too creamy. The potatoes and boiled eggs were drowning in the dressing. Although the flavor was fine, it has a tanginess, there was just too much dressing for my taste.

This was really good! Next time I will cut back on the sugar a bit but only because I like to add sweet pickles to my potato salad and it made it a bit too sweet. 
I have leftover dressing and going to make an apple salad out of it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Thought this was pretty good. Three changes for me were the addition of a tsp of celery seed, sprinkling the warm potatoes with rice vinegar before adding the dressing, and most important, making the dressing the night before. Big change in flavor the next day.

Impressive old fashioned potato salad recipe. Love the flavor and creamy rich texture. Very happy to have found this recipe. Personally, do not understand any of the poor reviews, at all!!!  This recipe, as written, or with the suggested changes, additions, and/or alterations is excellent. It is very forgiving and easy to adjust according to taste. The secret is in the homemade dressing. Thanks for sharing!

It is sweet to the taste.  Next time I make it I would add only 1/3 cup sugar instead of the 1/2 cup recommended in the recipe.  Otherwise, it is very delicious, never made this type of sauce for a potato salad.  Very easy to make.

This was pretty awful. The cloying sweetness was overwhelming, and the cooked sauce made consistency mushy and too rich. Going back to my traditional recipe with mayo, chopped pickles, onions, vinegar, etc.

I am searching for a perfect recipe for potato salad to make for the 4th.  Sadly, this isn't it.  This is a good basic potato salad recipe but not a WOW.  I want people to beg for the recipe, I would not ask for this recipe.  I doubled the corn starch, and cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup, glad that I did both of those things.  I really would have loved to add the celery seed, I think that would do a lot for this, but I didn't have any.  This isn't bad by any means but just not insanely delicious.

Delicious!  The one thing I didn't do correctly was to slightly cook the egg before mixing in the sugar.  Also, unnecessarily doubled the recipe so I had plenty left over.  Otherwise it was a big hit at the company picnic.

Love this recipe!  I did not change a single thing.  Always get compliments when serving this and many will say “this tastes like potato salad my grandmother used to make” .  This is very rich and creamy.  The cooked dressing makes all the difference.

I don't make potato salad. Never had a recipe that I liked. Always came out bland. This recipe is fantastic. Only thing I changed is I cut the sugar in half because I don't like sweet. This is a keeper!

I've been making the potato salad from this recipe for a few years now and it has become a staple at my friends and families' picnics. I have some friends who would eat this as their main dish if they could.

Some changes I make to the recipe:
I don't include celery or celery salt. I am not a celery fan
I add extra corn starch to thicken the sauce
I add parsley to help garnish the dish
For my MD friends, I add Old Bay

Tastes good but I did a few things differently. I used green onions instead of white, added some pickle juice instead of vinegar and used flour instead of cornstarch. Can’t wait til try it tomorrow after it sits in fridge overnight.

A hit with family . Hubby said it was best potato salad he ever ate. Everyone complimented me on it and there were no leftovers. Only change I made was used skim milk as all I had available.
Will make again.

I mase this exactly as the recipe reads and it was FANTASTIC. No question the best potato salad I have ever eaten. The dressing was just sweet enough and creamy, that’s where it’s at is in the dressing. I made it to take to a dinner with friends and everyone loved it. This is now my only potato salad recipe.

I made no changes other than reducing the sugar. The recipe is perfect as is in every other capacity. Family LOVED it!!  I am just now making it again so it can chill overnight and present its perfect self at our Labor Day gathering tomorrow.  Simply awesome and worth every minute that goes into it.  Thanks, Kaye Lynn!!

Excellent. I followed recommendations to decrease sugar to 1/3 cup, increase cornstarch to 2 tsp. and added 1 tsp of Celery Seed. Also substituted the onion with one bunch of green onions. Delicious!

I loved this potato salad! I followed the suggestions of others and increased the corn starch and decreased the sugar. I used apple cider vinegar,  almond milk instead of evaporated, half a medium white onion and 3 diced green onions.  I left the skin on my red potatoes.  I had never hard boiled eggs this way and noticed I could remove the shell easier after they cooled completely. I also added the celery seed.  Something to keep in mind is the size of your potatoes for those who had too much dressing. I used larger red potatoes. I also added in another cup of celery. Nothing but rave reviews!

This is a great recipe!  Didn’t change a thing other than quartering the potatoes before boiling because I was short on time. This will definitely be in our menu rotation.

I made only the changes the recipe contributor suggested were fine to make (reducing sugar and vinegar). I still found this recipe far too sweet, and way more work than was worth it. I am not sure that adding some ingredients to mayonnaise (doesn't everyone do that when they make potato salad?) counts as making your "own dressing" as the recipe claims, but I do know that it took a lot more time than the other potato salad I was making and had a slightly less desirable texture in the end. I didn't find it particularly rich or creamy.

I reduced the recipe and cut the serving size in half. I did look at the reviews and increased the cornstarch and cut back on the onions. I wanted to eat the potato salad right after I mixed it because it was tasty. It was a huge hit for my barbecue. 
Thanks for sharing this recipe and thanks for the reviews. Good looking out everyone.

I made this several times now...I make the dressing a little thicker and I don't necessary pour it all in.. Depending on the potato size, I never have added it all, it's all a matter of taste.

Made this 3-1-18  Everyone loved it. Went exactly by instructions but used 2 Tablespoons of corn starch.. We are a potato salad family and I make the best. But this was awsome.
Just use sauce according to size of your potatoes I had about 12 medium reds and it was perfect amount. We don't have strange taste for strange foods but this was good and different from plain potato salad...I will fix it again. It takes a little more time but worth it.

I love this recipe. I had never made potato salad and stumbled across this recipe. I nervously made it for a group of friends(picky eaters) and they raved about it. Now i get requests. I did double the cornstarch and a little less sugar.

Absolutely the casserole recipe I’ve ever tasted. I heave found that the cut of meat makes a big impact. I have used breast meat and thigh meat several times each. Now I only use boneless skinless thighs cut to bite size pieces

I put chopped pickles in instead of celery only because I’m not a fan of celery. I did use more cornstart! This potato salad was very tasty, thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and creamy.  One of the best potato salads I ever tasted.  One of the times that I cooked this salad, I replaced the celery with leek. It was very nice too.

Made this yesterday, July 30th everyone loved it. The first time I had this was at my sons house it was so good. He said there was way to much dressing.and the next time he would cut it in half. When I made it  that's  what I did and there was plenty of dressing,  other then that I followed the recipe as written. This will be the number one potato salad in my house.

I am so happy to find this recipe!  My husband is a potato salad lover and we could not find any that met his standards.  We have been going to every high end deli and store in the area to find something he likes.  This is it!! 
I used other's reviews to adjust the seasonings a bit, I used half the sugar (actually splenda) and half the vinegar on suggestion from my husband after the first try.  This recipe is a hundred times better after a night in the fridge and appeals to everyone.  Thanks for the amazing contribution to our picnic and cookout menus!!

Great recipe!  One tip to keep the onion from being the dish's star is to rinse the diced onions before adding them to the mix.  Thanks for sharing!

Love it & my company did too!! Creamy dressing. 
Easy to follow recipe. Applied some of the suggestions. Cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup, added celery seed. I also added dill, and did not put celery in. It was even better after it sat overnight. 
Glad I have a great potatoe salad recipe & will make again!

This was the first potato salad I ever made and it was delicious.  My husband loved it.  I added some celery seed to it because my husband likes it in potato salad.  I look forward to making it again.

Just made this this weekend, its terrible. This has to be one of the worst dressing I have ever made for a potatoe salad. Why has this got such great reviews is beyond me. Sorry, this was a waste of time and money.

This was fantastic! I followed it to a T, but did follow other's advice at the end by adding extra constarch.. it was gone in one night! I now have made it again, a day later.. lol.  It's that good! 

This time I made very crispy bacon on the side and sprinkled it on individual servings (vs mixing it in.. i don't like soggy!) Also fantastic.   Thanks for sharing!

This is a great base to adjust your preferences! I like sweet things, but I will agree just a skosh less sugar. 2 tsp of corn starch, 1 tsp celery seed, green onions added for garnish. I'd say it needs something else, but not sure what. Maybe just a subtle note of heat? Paprika? Garlic? 
Thank you for the recipe.

I did end up loving this potato salad, but only after several modifications. First of all it has WAY too much sugar for me. Cutting it in half was still too sweet. Next time I will use 1/8 cup instead of the 1/2 cup called for.  Secondly, we like "mustard potato salad" so I added a lot more mustard. Also I had to add quite a bit more salt than called for and also added some black pepper. But I guess those are mostly our personal preferences. 

I made this salad twice and had the same problem with the basic recipe, which is why I took off a star. Both times I doubled it for a big crowd and both times I had way way too much dressing. Like almost twice as much dressing as I needed. I think it might have a little to do with the size of potatoes used. Where I'm at red potatoes (which the author of this recipe suggests using in her review) are much much smaller than russets. I've seen them other places where they looked as big as a russet, but here a medium size red potato is much smaller.  So that could be contributing to the problem. But next time I make this recipe, I will cut the dressing ingredients in half. Or make a full recipe of dressing and just double the potatoes.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe and I  won't in the future. 
This was so creamy and tasty. 
This will be my dressing for potato salad from now on. 
Quick and easy to make.

Thanks for providing an excellent base for a recipe.  I'm rating 5 stars, because I used it for suggestions and tweaked.  Don't think its fair to rate lower if I didn't make as written.  Changes: 2 Tbsp. Sugar (plenty enough for our taste), 1/4 c. Apple cider vinegar, 2 tsp. Cornstarch, 4 green onions, 4 hard boiled eggs, 1/2 tsp. Celery seed, 2 lbs. red skin potatoes, large diced, put in room temperature water, and boiled for 15 minutes.  My favorite potato salad I've ever made by far.

This is a truly delicious potato salad!  I haven't gone to the trouble to make potato salad in years until I saw this recipe.  I doubt I will ever buy store bought again.  I did cut down on the sugar a bit and I added dill pickle and the celery seeds.  This is a new family favorite!

I made this but instead of celery, I diced sweet pickles. I only used 2 boiled eggs, and it was very good.  The dressing is delicious.

I agree wholeheartedly that it's the absolute best! It is especially good when you don't have any sweet relish on hand because with recipe you don't need it.

I made this recipe with no changes and did include the celery seeds mentioned in the update. In my humble opinion the "dressing" was way too sweet and overwhelmed all the other flavors. While it is OK, I have a better recipe that I'll stick with in the future.

Really nice. I added a bit more cornstarch per the other reviews, and didn't add hard-boiled eggs - it was still very good.

I feel it is a very special salad.  In the past I would add mustard and hardboiled eggs.  This is creamier and has such a good taste with the sour creme and vinegar.

Yes, but I would cut the sugar amount to 1/4c instead of 1/2c.  Thought  sweetness would lessen overnight in refrigerator, but it did not.  Still enjoyed it very much, but  too sweet for my taste.

This IS the best recipe I have ever made for potato salad. I have been cooking/ baking for over 55 years.  I didn't change a thing in this recipe. In fact, I doubled it. I think next time I may sneak in a few extra potatoes (red) to make it a bit drier in consistency, only because I prefer  a drier salad.

A lot of product and produce for nothing.  This was an indistinct version of something but it sure wasn't good 'ole American potato salad.
We will stick with the good New England style for our all year round weekends along with the best Boston Baked Beans.  If you really want something great add Cod Fish Cakes and you have the best weekend of all.

World's best Potato Salad...my .  It has sugar in it, corn starch, butter, vinegar, and evaporated milk.  Leave 'em all out  Simple is better!  Potatoes, yellow mustard (has vinegar in it), Hellman's Mayo, hard Boiled eggs,  green onion if you like (I do), some salt and pepper to taste.  Add too much mayo and it get's runny...so watch it.  Some people add celery...I don't think it is needed.  That's it.  All the other recipe did was add  to equal the simple route...and add extra calories.  How can you responsibly put this stuff out ???
The word stuff is in there for polite society.

This was way way way too sweet. I made this for a branding for about 20 people. It took an hour to make the day before and over an hour the day of to try and make it edible . I would not make this again but if you are determined to try it cut the sugar in half.

Even though I have not made your recipe Kaye Lynn, I felt compelled to share my thoughts with you and others.  I have no doubt that your recipe is by far the best.  My mother who recently passed at the age of 86 also used sugar in her potato salad.  She had all of the same ingredients, onions, celery, boiled eggs, salt and pepper and russet potatoes.  She always said the old shriveled up potatoes made for the best salad.  Her dressing consisted of Miracle Whip Salad dressing, sugar and mustard. Adjust to your personal taste. The sugar was just enough to take some of the tartness away.  She hated "dry" potato salad so make plenty as the potatoes tend to absorb some of it.  She would boil extra eggs, slice and add to the top of her salad. And last but not least, make it the day before.  Thank you Kaye Lynn for bringing back fond memories of some of the best potato salad in the world.

I gotta tell ya.  This potato salad is THE TRUTH!!!!!  I registered merely to share my opinion.  Since I like to put my own touch on everything I cook, I added some chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a sprinkling of green onions.  I also sprinkled a combination of dried and powdered tomato skins alternatively with paprika.  Because the two are indistinguishable to the naked eye, no one can figure out what that little "zing" is on the top.

Honestly, if there's any better potato salad than this, I don't want it because I'll start shooting it in my veins, then will need to go to rehab.  Seriously.  It's that good....

Really creamy salad, as the recipe states. Not sure the butter is really necessary, and I felt a bit guilty using it with so much mayo. Tastes like your classic potato salad you can buy at the deli, but a bit sweet for my taste. 4 stars since the wife and stepson both enjoyed it. Also, I had almost twice as much dressing as I needed for using the 6 medium red potatoes in making the salad.

Split the recipe in two, one with more spice, onions, and pickles, and one following the recipe. Pickles won with this crowd although there was nothing left of either in the end.

I've been making potato salad for yrs and this is definitely the best recipe ever.  I did add a few of my old "potato salad" tricks  (for the presentation & added flavor)  but the secret is in the dressing, no doubt about that.  For color and added flavor the presentation was made adding a 1/2 cup of drained cubed 1/4 inch pineapple (cut each cube in quarters) , drained and rinsed maraschino cherries sliced in quarters (about  16) and  5 or 6 where left whole with stem for presentation.  I did substitute about 1/2 of onions with 1/2 finely chopped chives but that was it. I also used a tad less sugar but that's up to your taste liking's.  This is definitely the best tasting potato salad I've ever made and it's quite easy too...  I made it the day before and left in the frig sealed with plastic wrap for 24 hours which really enhances the flavor. Give it a try..... it's excellent and be prepared for seconds and more.... enjoy... buen provecho...

This was AWESOME! I did take the advice to double the cornstarch and since we don't like very sweet dressings, I halved the sugar, used apple cider vinegar and red onions, added 1 tsp celery seeds. The consistency of the dressing was wonderful. A fantastic recipe.

I used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk, and chose rice wine vinegar. Half the recipe with onion and half without by using two bowls starting at the beginning.

I have tried this recipe twice. both times it was very soupy.  the instructions were different from the video.  Theres nothing in the instructions 
about peel and cut then boil. Also when you beat the egg it
says heat after you added the ingredients.  If you watch the video the egg is thrown in a hot pot and other ingredients 
added.

made as written except reduced sugar to 1/3 cup and used 2 tsp of cornstarch. this is a nice change from just the mayo and mustard versions and those are delish. mmmmmm good! dressing is similar to honey mustard or sweet and sour. I liked this recipe.

I found the dressing too sweet and too big a punch from the vinegar.  I would decrease measurements of both by 1/2.    I would also agree with previous review about increasing the corn starch to 2 tsp for a thicker sauce.   I also added 1/2 c. of cooked bacon ( diced).   I will definitely try this recipe again.

This is simply the best potato salad I've ever tasted. Definitely make a day ahead, as instructed. The flavors blend and wow! I didn't make any changes. Used a little more cornstarch, that's it. Fabulous.

I followed the directions to a T... with the exception of the vinegar. I assumed you were supposed to use white vinegar but didn't have any, so I used cider vinegar instead. It tastes delicious!
I'm not a huge fan of potato salad to begin with, but I had a lot of potatoes that needed to be used asap. I would definitely make this again, although I feel that it needs just a little something extra. Maybe it's just pepper that it needs or some other herb or spice... Someone with more potato salad making experience would probably know just what to do here!
I'm not sure why other reviewers said they had a problem with the sauce getting thick... I had no problems and used the amount of corn starch listed.

Made this accordingly to the recipe & yes I read where she added celery seed & I increased the cornstarch to 1.5 tsp. Maybe next time I'll use less sugar but oh my goodness, this is the best potato salad ever. I might add the green onions & maybe bacon at a later time just to mix it up. Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!

The secret IS in the homemade salad dressing.  When I make it again, I would like to add some other things.  My mother always taught us that presentation was very important.  I would pick little things that add color.

Made this for Memorial day event and everyone loved it. I doctored it a little by adding some pickles and red bell peppers but other than that I made it as shown. Everyone took some of the leftovers which told me that they really liked it.

This potato salad is delicious! The only changes I made were to cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, used half white and half rice vinegar, and shallots instead of onion. I also added about 1/2 cup of sweet pickle relish and some cayenne.
This recipe will definitely be making a regular appearance on my table this summer.

I've made the same old, basic potato salad recipe since I got married 45 yrs ago, but THIS recipe will now be what I use every time! It's sooooo worth the little extra effort!! I made the adjustments that others suggested (about half the amount of sugar, extra cornstarch), & it was perfect. Actually, I cut the ingredients for the "goop" almost in half (making the adjustments in proportion), & that was about right. I used 7 small-to-medium potatoes & only 2 eggs, just because a few of my bunch don't love eggs in their pot salad.

updated-
.
I paid closer attention to when/how I added the ingredients and this way is best.

1-Peel & cube the potatoes.  Boil and made sure they are almost over done and can very easily mash with a fork.   Drain and cool.

2-  I add In a heavy saucepan (I used a cast iron   and it helps me not to scorch things) the ingredients in the following order sugar, egg, vinegar, evaporated milk.

3-  Cook until a paste forms then cool in refrigerated about 10 minutes.

4- Add room temperature butter (not microwave and not a liquid form)- fold in with a for while mixture is still warm. cool fully.

5- add dressing and potatoes, a small handful  of hand diced white or yellow onion, some celery again hand diced.  I happen to have added the mayo last and I would not change a thing.

6- I added more shakes of salt than I normally would, I stirred more than I would have normally  and finally I added about a teaspoon of celery seed.  I did not add egg or mustard but if you like those, add them last.

Better than store bought and so much money saved!  Let stand in the fridge-made hours before needed.

Everyone will thing you  bought this- other than it is rather pale.  SO put it in a colorful bowl and add parsley or paprika.

Didn't see the comment to add 1 tsp of celery seed. Also, omitted the eggs. 
But, Potato salad was a winner with my boyfriend. He loved it. I like more of a tangy salad not sweet. For some reason the one i made was on the sweet side. Still taste just fine though. 
Will probably make again for others.

Thank you so much for this recipe I will never make another one it's so delicious. I did change one thing, I didn't have fresh celery at the time so I used celery seed and I didn't have cornstarch so I substituted with a 1 to 3 with flour and it came out great!

OMG...Greetings from Finland. I made this today and me and my teenagers just loved it. I didn´t have celery but put some pickles instead. This was so good and easy to do. I didn´t even peel my red potatoes. Thank you so very very much for this recipe =)

I can't make enough of this recipe - my family literally fights about who gets the leftovers.  I do cut the sugar in half and use green onions. This is definitely the best potato salad!

I did not like it. There was way too much sugar and I tasted the evaporated milk. Not to my liking. Maybe cutting way down on sugar and using sweet pickles and half and half instead of evaporated milk. But then it's a different recipe. LOL

I would rate it 7. I tried it and found that it is good.  I found that when adding the
milk to the vinegar, the milk curded. vinegar plus milk makes sour
milk.

This is the best!!  Needing potato salad for a large group in a hurry - I purchased potato salad from a restauant supply. It was dry and flavorless so I turned to this recipe, replacing the 5 med. potatoes with 4 lb. of purchased potato salad. I did reduce the sugar and added some shredded carrots for color, let it set overnight and had the perfect potato salad.  My husband who doesn't like potato salad just kept eating it.  Probably not as great as when make entirely from scratch - but no one seemed to notice.

I have not made potato salad in a very long time, and needed a good recipe. This looked really different from what I was used to, so I gave it a try. This has to be one of the best potato salad recipe ever. My husband and I love to cook, and he said it was definitely a keeper. It was so creamy and just full of flavor!

I am accustomed to a more mustard based potato salad, which might be why I did not enjoy this very much. I found it too sweet without a whole lot a flavor otherwise.

Absolutely delicious! I added a tsp of celery seed as advised from previous reviewers, and substituted yellow mustard for Dijon. Next time I would definitely cut back on the sugar, it was a little too sweet for my liking, but appeased the taste buds of my Southern friends. Great recipe for the books.

I tried this recipe for Father's Day.  It was delicious.  I wanted to add bacon to the recipe but my husband doesn't like bacon in potato salad.  So we compromised and I crumbled up bacon and put it in a dish on the table and invited those who like bacon to sprinkle it on top.  Everyone tried it that way (including my husband) and I think it tasted better than if I had put it in the recipe.  This is going to be my "go to" potato salad for all picnics.  Including the crumbled bacon sprinkled over the top.  Great recipe!

Best potato salad....creamy and delicious!  Used only 1/3 c. sugar, be careful w/ the c'starch----use 2 scant t. and use the measuring spoon.  Added olive salad and mayo w/o measuring.  I omitted the celery seed b/c it wasn't on hand.  No eggs either.  It didn't seem to need either.  Very, very good potato salad!  This recipe is a keeper.  Wish it wasn't so high in calories, though....the only down side!

Nice! Really good texture and pretty good balance of sweet and tart. I substituted cream for the evaporated milk and left out the hard boiled eggs on the first batch. That bowl was the hit of our dinner party. With eggs is great as well, but too much egg distracts from the overall potato salad feel and flavor. I really couldn't tell much difference in flavor when comparing the batch using ev milk to the one with cream, but our cream batch was a bit lighter on the palate. As a final note, I doubled the batch and added 1/4 tsp of xanthan gum after adding the vinegar to make it extra thick and creamy. This really helps if you use a food processor to dice your onions and celery and have a little of that juice left in the bowl. Overall fantastic stuff here.

Awesome salad dressing!  I have always made my own but not with canned milk.  Wow!  There's something about it that takes potatoes over the top! I use it for macaroni salad as well.  Great job Kaye Lynn!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I've always just put mayo, mustard and sweet pickle relish together for the dressing, but this is more of a refined dressing.  I always wondered how come the grocery store potato salads were so creamy, this must be the secret. I absolutely love it and will never do it any other way again.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Kaye Lynn!!!

this potato salad is awesome!  The dressing is the best  I have ever tried/made.  I can't wait for my family to try it.   I might try adding some pickle to it the next time.

Best potato salad ever! I followed the recipe except for using 3 chopped green onions in place of the one small onion called for in the recipe.  This was great. I will make it my go to recipe for potato salad. Kaye Lynn, thank you for submitting.

Amazing flavor! First time potato salad maker here and I won't even bother trying another recipe.Used some of the tips (2 tsp cornstarch)and also next time I wont be afraid to use more potatoes. I used 9 medium sized and would add3 or 4 more in a heartbeat. So glad I tried this.

A potato salad similar to PA Dutch style hot lettuce dressing.  I will cut back on the sugar next time and use a 1/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup.  The dressing is plentiful so you can almost double the amount of potatoes used.  The potatoes will absorb some of the dressing too.  I watched the video to see how quickly I should put the ingredients together for the dressing.  It was helpful.

I'm eating it as I type this review. It's really creamy and tasty. I used carrots instead of celery and green onions instead of white ones. I'll be making it again soon! Thanks!

Yes it is great! I get compliments all the time when I bring this along. I cut the sugar to about 1/3 cup for my particular taste, but it is the best.

Ok I loved the dressing it made the potato salad even better. I added a few extras in mine like pimento, diced olives, and celery seed to the dressing and my family gave me high fives! Thanks for the recipe

This potato recipe was ok, not bad , not great.  It is a bit different tasting from your typical potato salad.   My wife liked it a lot but it was a little to sweet for me.  If I make it again I would cut the sugar down to maybe a 1/4 of a cup or even less.     All and all though I would not call it the worlds best potato salad but more like "The Worlds OK Potato Salad".

My ex-MIL made a similar recipe that I used to love.  I thought I'd give this a try.  It was okay, but honestly, made it as is and found it WAY too sweet.  I would make this again, but cut way back on the sugar - maybe 1/2 the amount.  I also found this to be a lot of dressing for the number of potatoes the recipe calls for.  Next time, I will reserve a portion of the mayo/dressing mixture, or just cut the recipe in half.  I believe this has potential, just too sweet for us.

Way too sweet!  So we just added 2 large dill pickles chopped. More like World's Sweetest Potato Salad. I did like the sauce otherwise.

Amazing recipe. Do not worry if the sauce looks very weird, just keep at it, it will thicken. Think I am going to add some bacon next time.

I tried this receipe for a Barbeque and was not impressed. I took the advice of others and added another teaspoon of corn starch and let it cool completely. It was very creamy but was way too sweet. I prefer a potato salad with a little zing to it. I might try this recipe again with a little a less sugar and a little more mustard.

This is a delicious recipe. We like chopped sweet pickles and celery seed added to ours. I also use Seasoned Salt in mine. The flavor combination of the dressing ingredients is perfect. This is the only potato salad recipe for me. Thank you for posting it!

This recipe is wonderful as is, however, I did reduce the sugar to 1/8 cup, added the celery seed and used salad dressing (Miracle Whip) in lieu of mayonnaise. It tasted so old-fashioned, like grandma made.

Really good! Very creamy. However, I don't like to much sugar in my food (only desserts) so I cut the sugar in half.  Next time I will add even less.

This an awesome recipe, perhaps more for the "southern" taste. Reminds me of my mother's which I could never quite duplicate. The addition of celery seed is good, and you can vary the amount of onions, sugar and celery to taste. Deserves a 5 star rating every time. Make a day a head of time and it's even BETTER!! Perfect for potlucks!

Great basic recipe. I made a couple changes, so that's why I only rated it 4 stars. It's WAY TOO SWEET and I only used 1/4C! I also used season salt instead of regular table salt simply because I was out of table salt. I will be using this recipe again though!! Next time, much less sugar will be used. Thanks for the starter recipe!

This was awesome! A little too sweet though. I would only use a 1/4 cup of sugar(maybe even less) and there is a ton of dressing. Probably could get away with only using a 1/2 cup of mayo. Delicious!!

This is the best potato salad I've ever had! I made it early so it would be all ready for dinner. I did a taste test right after finishing it and couldn't put it in the fridge without taking a bowl full first. haha

This is by far the best potato salad I have had. I always get rave reviews when I make this. I used to just buy potato salad because I could never make it very well. That has now changed thanks to Kaye and her great recipe.

I have to admit that I was a little skeptical that it wouldn't be flavorful without pickles in it, and I even bought stuff to "fancy" it up, like bacon, cheese, pickles, etc.  However, it seriously didn't need it, and I never added it.  The dressing really stood out and the vinegar in it gave that powerful flavor, which is the reason you don't need the pickles.  Plus, the crunch of the celery and onions are all you need, and the celery gives it a touch of color. In fact, you could probably even reduce the amount of dressing unless you really like creamy potato salad because some people may even find it too creamy. I fortunately saw the review from the creator of this recipe to add celery seed to the dressing because she forgot to add it to the list of ingredients.  The only thing that I didn't do exactly by the recipe was to omit the butter because I just didn't think it was necessary.  It turned out great.

I substituted green onions for onions, and added some dill pickles. I was very pleased with it, and will definitely make this again.

Was looking all Father's Day weekend for a potato salad to make (not a fan of potato salad and have never made it before--except German) , but my Joe wanted some to go with burgers and brats.  Came across yours and thought I'd give it a try.  Absolutely Love It!  (I noticed some of the other recipes I'd seen called for celery seed, so I added a teaspoon to the sauce before adding the mayo--which I see you indicated you had forgotten to add to ingredients and I used Yukon Gold potatoes :).  Passing this along to my two Daughters!!

Thanks for sharing...not even going to bother trying any others!!

Wow what a great recipe!  I actually used 8 med red potatoes, 7 med eggs, and 1/2 a large yellow onion.  I soaked the minced onion in a bowl of cold water for about an hour to get rid of the oniony bite, while retaining the crunch!

I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, but it was still very sweet.  Next time I will reduce to 1/4 cup.  I used 1 1/2 tsp of cornstarch, and also added 1 tsp ground celery seed to the sauce before chilling, and when I mixed it with the mayo, I added 1 c. of drained sweet relish.  (This is why I will reduce sugar to 1/4 c. The relish is plenty sweet!)  

My batch is currently chilling in the fridge overnight, but preliminary taste tests by the Food Critic (aka my bf) have gotten rave reviews!

If you like sweet Amish style potato salad this is a good recipe.  Use extra cornstarch and use small red potatoes (about size of golf balls)  that way you can quarter and get about one inch "cube" sized potatoes.  Not my favorite because I like a more tang and less sweet but my Pennsylvania boyfriend liked it.

Pretty good, but not my favorite potato salad. I followed the recipe exactly as written and while it tasted OK, it wasn't what I was looking for. It seemed to need salt, sweet pepper relish, paprika... just not what I'm used to. Thx!

I followed the recipe exactly. I used yukon gold potatoes and made a double batch. The sauce was just way too tangy for me. I think it is personal preference but I just prefer more of a mayonnaise flavor and I think the vinegar/butter just overwhelmed it. Sorry!

I was very skeptical about this potato salad - I have 3 autistic children who have their quirks about pretty much everything.  They gobbled it up and my husband said "baby, you put your foot in this one" (that's actually a good thing from where he comes from :)  Served it with Tangy Ranch chicken and no squabbles or whining at the table. They were all too busy eating and asking for seconds! I did cut the sugar as some users suggested, down to 1/3 cup and I'm glad I did.  It was awesome. The sauce did smell kind of weird but as a user posted, ignore it.  It will all come together in the end.   With summer right around the corner, this is going to be a regular at our table, and with our hot, humid Missouri weather, I'm positive it will be a refreshing side my family and friends will be looking forward to.

This is a super creamy, tasty potato salad!  The flavors are all there.  It went beautifully with my barbecued brisket.  It is a little too sweet for my taste though, so next time, I'll use less sugar.  I will also try to make it the night before as the flavors melded better and the consistency thickened up nicely.

So yummy! I loved that this recipe didn't call for relish, since I'm not a relish fan. I decided to make this for a cookout and I got soooo many compliments! I didn't have any white vinegar, so I used cider vinegar and I used a red onion instead of a white one...I LOVED this..and so did everyone else, I think next time I'm going to try and add Bacon to it...because everything's better with Bacon!

I made this over the weekend for a family cookout. It was a hit! My mother in law even gave me a compliment ;-)  It was very rich and and had a great texture. The seasonings added pushed it over the top.

When I read the title of this recipe I thought, "Yeah, I bet".  I have not been happy with past potato salad recipes & I have made a bunch!  I made this for a Memorial Day picnic for my husband's family and they almost ate it all!  I did make a few changes:  I used green onions instead of regular ones, added 8 slices of crumbled bacon, cut the sugar to 1/4 cup, used rice vinegar instead of regular vinegar, added 1 tsp. celery seed and 1/4 cup sliced almonds. I also used honey mustard rather than plain mustard.  A real winner!

I do not like mustard in potato saled, but this one is great with mustard,please double the corn stach or it want be thick enough once you add mayo,also use  at least 7 or more large potatos because there is lots of dressing to go on it . if you use only 6 you will have too much dressing left over . Try this one and youll never make any other kind agin....

Absolutely the best, I did add the extra corn starch(2 tsp), used red potatoes, green onions, the celery seed mentioned by the author in her additional notes and the suggested dill pickles by the another rater. Everyone just loved it. I will be making it again and again.

I made this for a family gathering and brought it to my mother in laws.  My husband compared that to bringing beer over to Sam Adams place.  That made me nervous, but being stubborn I went ahead and made this recipe and got RAVE reviews.  I will definitely make this again.  I used real mayonaise rather than miracle whip and was pleased.  I may cut the sugar in half next time as I thought it was a little sweet.

This certainly is different! It isn't bad but it really isn't oustanding. I cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup and I still thought it was on the sweet side. Glad I tried it but probably wont make again.

I cut the sugar in half and it wasn't sweet enough, so next time I will follow the recipe to a T. I also added sweet relish after the potato salad was done. I will continue to do that. Skip the bacon, and the celery. Maybe sub some green peppers for that next time.
9-5-11: Followed the recipe exactly, including the tsp. of celery seed. It was delicious!! I love it. My friend thought it was too sweet but he doesn't like sweet foods period. It was just sweet enough to me, without being overbearingly sugary. I think potato salads should have some level of sweetness to it. I will def. make again for a holiday or get together. I added relish, and next time may add more relish or sprinkle on some paprika for color.

This was my 1st attempt at Potato salad, which I made for a BBQ Party of 16 people.  I doubled the recipe (didn't need to do that!  There was plenty!)  I added some horseradish and dijon mustard and dill seasoning.  This was just yummy!  Good thing it was good cause everyone got a "take home" package!  I will make this again.

I made this with a red onion and left the potato skins on.  I didn't have celery so I omitted that.  Replaced the cornstarch with flour and the evap milk with regular milk.  Left out the mustard.  This is the BEST potato salad I have ever had...yum!

Excellent recipe, though I did alter it a bit.  Used about 3 tablespoons of sugar (and will probably eliminate altogether next time); added more (red) onion than recipe suggests, added chopped fresh parsley, some celery seed and dried dill---additions for personal preference.  I'm sure I will used this recipe exclusively when I make potato salad.  Thanks so much!

Really excellent potato salad, I added a couple more pototoes because many readers suggested it made a lot of sauce and it did.  I added some red onion and sweet pickles, it was excellent and I had many compliments.

Definitely the best potato salad I have ever had. I didn't change a thing. I made the sauce exactly as it said but just didn't add all of it to the potatoes. I like it creamy but thought the recipe made a little too much sauce. No problem though, I just use the left-overs for making deviled eggs.

Truly one of the tastiest things I have made ever. This potato salad is AMAZINGly good!!!! Whenever I make it the family can't walk past the fridge without getting some just to snack on. It's that good. Great recipe although I do leave out the hard boiled eggs..I think it gives it a rather funny taste and tastes much better without it but that's just my opinion. Thank you sooo much for posting this recipe :DDD

Very tasty potato salad. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I only added 1/3 cup of sugar, used only half an onion, and then added some green onions, pickles, and sliced black olives. The end result was really great, everyone loved it and was very impressed. This salad has really great flavor.

This recipe is that it makes WAY more than the servings suggest.  I doubled it to feed about 12 people and they barely put a dent in the gigantic bowl of potato salad I presented.  Well, other than that, it tasted good -- I used red potatoes and green onion instead of white, but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely.

I thought this was good but similar to another recipe I use.  I usually try a recipe exactly as written the first time but after reading some of the reviewer comments I did go with using 1/2 t celery seed, 2 hard cooked eggs, diced 1/4 c vinegar and 1/4 cu sugar and 2t cornstarch. I also added 2 stalks of green onion for color.  I thought it was very good. It made a lot of sauce so I used the leftover for macaroni salad and it was great as I didn't have to make two different sauces.

If this tastes this good today I can imagine how good it'll be tomorrow. I did use 2t corn starch, 2 bunches green onion and 1 green pepper, everything else stayed the same. Mmmm mmmm good. Oh yeah also added 1t celery seed to the sauce while it was cooking, just cause I like 'em.

Very good.  I only made minor changes.  I used green onion, and celery seed instead of chopped celery.  I added sweet pickles because I don't think that any potato salad or macaroni salad should be made without homemade sweet pickles.  The sauce stays very creamy, and if you like that sweet & vinegary flavor combination you should like this recipe.

Very tasty but sweet even though I only used 1/2 c of sugar.  I'll cut in half next time.  People said it reminded them of egg salad.   The consistency of the sauce turn out incredible.

Love this recipe. After making it the first time, got to thinking the sauce would probably be good for macaroni salad also. When I tried it, I used 1# of elbow macaroni, it tasted good, but there were too many noodles, they sort of sucked the sauce right up. Will be using this recipe again and again, no changes for potato salad, with less macaronis for mac salad.

This was not as big of a hit as expected.  A much sweeter recipe than I prefer for potato salad.  I added extra hard boiled eggs.  There was too much dressing.

Sooo goooood!   as with all great recipes, this gave me a great starting point, as I have never made potato salad before.  I used a little less than half the sugar, twice the corn starch, red potatoes (boil them for a shorter time because they are smaller than regular potatoes), shallots instead of onion, apple cider vinegar, celery salt as well as sea salt, omitted the celery (my husband has something against it) added dill and chives, and I used sour cream instead of mayo.  It is fantastic, with or without the hard-boiled eggs, the first time I made it I left them out- but it was awesome anyway.  With them it was even better.  OH and I used Dijon mustard.

The dressing should be bottled and sold it's that good. I bet it would even be good on pasta salad! I didn't use all of the egg mixture in the mayonaise, I just blended half of it in for our taste. I think, for us, it would have been too sweet with all of it. Thanks! I love it!

This recipe was okay for me! It wasn't the best I have ever ate. I added relish because I think all potato salads need pickles. I did not put the celery in there because I was out but if I had I might have liked it a little better! It did need the crunchiness!

Although the flavor of the dressing was fantastic, there was just too much of it making the potato salad soupy.  The potatoes were cooked well, but for some reason hardened after once they were put in the refrigerator overnight.  I am not sure why.  I guess I probably messed that up somehow. I do think that the potatoes needed more seasoning. Overall, this is a very good recipe, I will try it again with a few alterations.  First, I am going to dice the potatoes into dime sized pieces. I am going to use only half of the dressing at first and use some of the remainder if needed. I am going to use more salt and pepper.  In addition, I will use some more celery, onion, and finely chopped carrots to add more crunch and some sweet relish for added flavor.

Way too much dressing!! Needed a lot more potatoes in ratio to the dressing. I followed others' suggestion and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, but it was still a bit too sweet.  We prefer a more traditional, less "soupy" potato salad.  Too much time and work involved - I'll just stick to my standard potato salad recipe.

I have used a recipe similar to this forever. It was one my grandmother and her mother used (no canned milk, sour cream) I once made this, one recipe at a time to make potato salad for 900 car enthusiasts, and was asked for and actually sold the recipe to three of them that day. We used 200 lbs of potatoes, so you know the work that was involved. Glad to see that others are still enjoying it.

YUM - this is the best potato salad I've had in YEARS. I did make my own variation as others have and it was absolutely perfect. Instead of the whole regular onion, I used 1/4 of a sweet yellow onion and 2 bunches of green onions. I also added in a 1/2 cup of finely chopped red pepper and 1/2 cup of chopped bacon. Everything else I kept exactly the same. Wow it's a lot of work - and I think I gained a pound just by cooking it so it isn't something I'll make often - but oh boy - I will make it again.

This was a great recipe.  My first time ever making potato salad.  I didn't use as much sugar based on other reviewer comments and that was very good.  I served it at a birthday party and everyone wanted more salt, so next time I'll just be sure to add more. GREAT.

This was my first attempt at potato salad and it was a hit with the hubby. I cut the recipe in half, but ended up needing to use 4-1/2 fist-sized potatoes to sop up all the dressing--it was a lot. I increased the cornstarch, used the celery seed that is suggested by the author, used half green onions and half yellow, threw in some relish and a bit of bacon. Sounds like a heart attack waiting to happen...but only a few bites of this was all I needed to go along with the rest of my dinner.

This potato salad is superior to any other! It is true that this recipe is a bit time consuming, but well worth it. I also cut back on the sugar to measure slightly under 1/3 cup. My only additions to the recipe was sprinkling some dried dill into the mayo portion. As another reviewer suggested I topped the final dish with a dusting of paprika. Thanks Kaye Lynn for this tasty recipe :)

Awesome! I made it for my 30th and got rave reviews. I followed peoples advice and cut back on the sugar to 1/3 a cup and didn't find it too sweet at all. Excellent potato salad!!!

I love this recipe!  It is on the sweet side so, I just used 1/3 cup sugar instead.  So creamy and yummy!  Best potato salad I ever made.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  ^_^

Enjoyed this more than any I have had in years. At least since Mom stopped making potato salad. Was best after 24 hours in fridge.

Tastes great.  Rather runny though, so next time I will try adding some cornstarch.

The name says it all!  This is by far the best potato salad I have ever had let alone made!  My husband is not a fan of potato salad and he actually went back for seconds, then thirds!  This is definately the potato salad recipe I will be passing on to my children!  Thanks

I decided to make this for a cookout that we had at my house and it was a hit! I couldn't keep my hands off of it. Even my significant other, the man that despises potato salad, like it! I did add the dill pickle that another reviewer suggested and half and half yellow onions and scallions, but other than that I kept it the same and it is perfect. This will be the recipe I turn to for now on! Thank you for the recipe. Happy cooking. :)

I am a VERY picky potato salad eater and I have to say, this is now one of my favorites.  I always thought my mom's was the best....until now (sorry mom).  I doubled the recipe & did find it a tad bit sweet for my taste, but I will just add less sugar next time.  Everyone else who ate it thought it was fabulous & I am now the #1 potato salad maker in the family!!  Thanks so much for this recipe--I LOVE potato salad and now I can make it on my own instead of waiting for mom to make it!!!

This was my first time making potato salad.  It turned out excellent. I added a little relish to it as well, but not a lot. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used what I had, I'm sure that changed it a little but it was still great. Boiling the potatoes whole really saved time, I had never done that before.  I peeled them once they were done and they broke up really easily when cut to give it a real homestyle appearance.  My husband declared it was really good, and that he was taking it to work the next day........that is an accomplishment in my house!

For someone who has never made a successful potato salad, this recipe was easy to follow and tasted pretty good...just not sure it was worth all the effort.  my mom makes a killer potato salad and just uses plain ol' mayo for the dressing. maybe this recipe is just missing some ingredients that i normally like in my salad, like granny smith apples for a crunchy, sweet tang, and shrimp, for a contrasting savory flavor and texture.

This was good, I followed others advice and changed white onions to green, changed sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup and add 1 tsp of celery seed.  The flavor was superb, the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is that it was way too much sauce, everything else was perfection

I'v never been good at making potato salad. But wanted to try for Easter dinner. Your name for the recipe sure is correct.  What a great and unusual flavor. My husband took some to work the next day and the girls in the office loved it!

I didn't have onions or celery (don't really care for either anyway...) and I didn't have the evaporated milk so I used whole milk instead...I think it made it a little thinner of a dressing, but oh so good!  Both of my daughters loved it, they wanted a second bowl right away!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Potato salad is my favorite of all picnic salads.  I am always looking for a great recipe.  This one is realy similar to my mother's so I really enjoyed it.

Very creamy!  I decided to double the sauce since I had 11 medium to large potatoes and still had a lot of extra sauce.  I am going to use the sauce in some macaroni salad.  

Pretty much followed the recipe.  Only used 6 hard-boiled eggs even though I double everything else.  Used 2/3 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, used 1/2 cup garlic-red wine vinegar & 1/2 cup white vinegar.  Only had skim milk so I used 10 oz or 1 1/4 cup.  Kept the mustard in since I like potato salad with spice (used 2 tsp spicy brown mustard).  Added celery seed, s+p at end only, about 1/2 cup sweet relish and a small jar of pimento for color.  

Tasted very good and I just made it.  Looking forward to tasting tomorrow once all the flavors blend together.  Highly recommend this recipe.  This one is a keeper!  Would definitely be good with bacon but did not have the time to make it.

A huge hit at this year's 4th of July party.
