I'm not sure I bought the right fruit. The grocer assured me they were the same thing but now I'm doubting it. I bought mamey sapote not black sapote. Nonetheless this smoothie was delicious with the mamey sapote. I must look for the black sapote and try this recipe with the right fruit. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
