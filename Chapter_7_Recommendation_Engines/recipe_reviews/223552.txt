This is a great recipe!!!! Me and My husband LOVED it!!! Perfect combo of Hot and Sweet!!! It is more of a jam since jelly is usually clear juice and it wasnt strained, I did take some of the seeds and ribs out of the peppers before I put them in the blender. I used 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar because I didnt have any red wine also used cranberry juice instead of the pomegranate, I wasnt sure about the pectin since all I had was the powdered so I used 4TBS and it turned out GREAT!! LOVED IT!!!! I will make this again!!! This is one of my new favorite recipes!!!

Definitely the wine and pomegranate make this.  The combo of sweet & hot is perfect. Good and fairly hot; not wimpy.  I used Hungarian wax peppers that I grew and left on vine until red (for the "hot red pepper") and a combo of red and green habanero peppers. It is unnecessary to mince the peppers because you are blending the in the blender and the less you handle them the better. WEAR GLOVES! This was great spread on chibatta bread crumbled with blue cheese; broil 1 min.   FICO!

We LOVE this recipe! However, we use jalapenos instead of habaneros. SO tasty!

I just made this. We like spicy.  But I went to have a lick of some right before canning and OH BOY is it supposed to be this hot? We love our hot sauces but I used 2 cups red thai chillies and 2 cups scotch bonnets (which are the same on the Scoville scale as habaneros... I couldn't find habaneros in my area). I see other recipes ask for simply 8 hot peppers.  Am I crazy or just sensitive? Lol thanks!

Update: too hot to eat unless we mix 2 parts regular jam with 1 part of this jelly. Crazy hot!

I used a total of 1.75oz of fruit pectin.  Instead of the wine I used 1/2c of cider vinegar and 1/2c of red wine vinegar.  I didn't have any habanero peppers so I used a combination of cayenne and Hungarian wax peppers.  The jam turned out perfect, making 7 - 8oz jars.

The amount of habaneros in this recipe is scorching hot.  To make 2 cups of minced habaneros, it took about 30-35 habaneros.  I wanted to be able to eat this so I cut the habaneros in half and added more jalepenos and one small yellow bell pepper to make up for the missing cup of peppers.  It makes a beautiful deep burgundy jelly.  Try it if you like it hot!

I like the taste of this jelly; it is extremely hot but not so hot that the other flavors are lost. Mine came out very thick, I would have preferred a softer jelly. My package of pectin was 2 oz. not 1.75 oz. I used the whole thing plus the other 2 Tablespoons of pectin. I think it was too much. It was also a very dark red, not at all like the picture showed. The Malbec wine was very dark and dry. I was not familiar with the wine so didn't know what to expect. I used unsweetened pomegranate juice, which is also very dark. The recipe didn't specify what kind. I could have used one that was sweetened and more diluted, then maybe my jelly would have been a prettier color. I didn't use the seeds and membrane of the peppers. The recipe didn't say to remove them, but I knew we couldn't go that hot. In addition, I ran out of hot peppers so I made up the difference by adding a cup of red bell pepper. Mine may be considerably milder that the original recipe, but my husband (who is starting to think medium salsa is too mild for him) cannot eat this jelly.  Iâ€™m hoping he will like it as a glaze or marinade for meat. Thank you for posting, it was fun to make.
