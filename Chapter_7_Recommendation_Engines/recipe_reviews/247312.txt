i sliced mine as thin as the ones you buy at the store because that's the only thing i had to go off of. I cooked for the time and temp mentioned. and at that stage checked and they werent fully dry yet. i took half out of the oven at the time the recipe suggests and let them cool. The other half i returned to oven, shut it off and let them dry up further till the oven was cool (2 hours) . Those ones dried alot more..and were crisp. the ones i ate once cool were chewy and not chip like. I also had a hard time getting over the colour that they turned once in the oven..they ended up being mostly grey/blackish. i used a very firm banana as well. 
i would suggest cooking them for longer..or allowing them to dry out completely in the oven till the oven has cooled down. Also brush some lemon juice on the slices so they stay that nice yellow color.
