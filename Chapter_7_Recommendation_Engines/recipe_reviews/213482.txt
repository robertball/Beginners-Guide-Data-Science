OMG, to this is to DIE for.  I used a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and watched the chicken to make sure it didn't overcook.  Otherwise, simple and tasty.   Even my picky teenagers had seconds!  It's a keeper!

Top Notch As Is! For my hubby's palette, however, I increased the garlic to 3 cloves and halved the ginger. Additionally, if you brown the chicken in sesame oil, you'll really be able to taste the compliment against the orange. GREAT and EASY recipe!

This was really good and easy to make.  Adding a teaspoon of corn starch does help.

loved that it was so easy! i would eliminate adding water or white wine next time. just the teriyaki and marmalade w/ ginger and garlic. cooked it with red bell pepper and zuchini (great coloring). i would make the sauce thicker next time, it was 100% watery.

This dish was delicious! I found the orange marmalade to be a bit too strong... I now substitute with apricot preserve instead and sometimes thicken with a little cornstarch. The sauce is very yummy!

I forgot to add the dry white wine and it was still good.  In lieu of Terriyaki sauce I just used a bit of soy sauce to taste.  I also added broccoli slaw and sauted.

This was very good but I may have to fine tune it to our taste.  I found the sauce to be too watery.  I'm going to try more browning and less wine to try to get away from that boiled chicken look and feel.    However, my kids LOVED it and any chicken that's not a nugget is a winner in my book.  Thank you for the recipe!

Needs cornstarch to thicken it up.  Also added brown sugar or it was too salty.  Next time I will add red pepper flakes.

My son would have given it 5+ stars, very much a kid-friendly recipe. It was really too sweet for me, and I wondered if orange juice and some rind  rather than marmalade might have worked better (you really have to use cornstarch anyway). I left out the water, added orange pepper and zucchini slices (red would have looked better), a few red pepper flakes, and used a tbsp of cornstarch at the end (the sauce was already thin, but the zucchini added to it), and sauteed the chicken with half-canola, half-sesame oils. I'm not sure how much the wine added to it. I served it with brown rice, just drizzled the orange sauce over it. I'll definitely do it again if only for my son's sake, but I do want to try to cut down on the sweetness next time.

This was okay.  The flavor was pretty good, but the sauce was too thin (read: watery.)  I think I'll add some cornstarch next time to thicken it up.

I did find this recipe a little watery at the end, but just added corn starch and it thickened right up.  This is a fantastic easy dish to make, very flavorful and much healthier than take out Chinese food.  I have this as part of my dinner schedule now.  I do add water chestnuts, broccoli, and baby corn to it to add some vegetables, its delish!

Like most reviewers I did add some cornstarch and put my own spin on it for my family's preferences (cubed chicken, fresh veggies and moooore garlic =) but this was a fantastic recipe. Thanks LisaB! There will be a lot less pregnancy induced I-gotta-have-Chinese-take-out-trips in my future. Much healthier that way, so baby thanks you too!

This was very flavorful and oh so yummy! I ended up making this into more of a stir fry. I added broccoli and served over rice. Next time I will add cornstarch to thicken up the sauce as I found it a little runny. I will definitely make this again!

We really liked this recipe. I did make some changes - I used chicken thighs with skin on and dredged them in flour and browned in sesame oil. I also added two tsp of corn starch to sauce and about 1/2 of water. Everyone liked it served with fried rice that I made with broccoli.

This is so yummy! I use chicken tenderloins and cut them into bite size pieces before cooking and serve over rice. Thicken the sauce as other suggest and I omit the wine and use a 3/4 c of chicken broth.

Absolutely love this recipe. Following the example of most reviewers here, I made small tweaks from those who made it before. I used a bit less marmalade and two tsp cornstarch in the sauce. I also browned the chicken in stir fry oil instead of canola. I served it over fried rice and my husband and I enjoyed it immensely. Definitely saving for later use.

I love ingredient search. Some houseguests from London left us with a small jar of orange marmalade. Not being a fan, I looked for a way to use it in cooking. This recipe was perfect. Very nice. The sauce is a bit thin, but fine when served with rice. I will make this again even if no other Londoners give me marmalade!

The orange marmalade gives it a slight tang that differentiates it from other teriyaki marinades. So easy! My family said this one is a keeper.

I didn't add the ginger...rather, I forgot to add it. I liked the recipe overall. my husband was not a fan.  He didn't like the fact that orange marm was used and said it over powered the recipe and overall marm gives things a bitter flavor since it contains the zest portion of the orange. he said maybe the recipe may work with preserves or jam better...for him.

It was easy to follow, but I'm giving it a 4 cause it needed to be thickened.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews first.  I'm going to try with sesame oil and cornstarch next time and there will be a next time

I really enjoyed this dish. I also eliminated the water and wine as suggested and the constancy of the sauce was perfect.

Delicious Thank you! I did make the following changes. I also used apricot preserves instead of marmalade like another poster. I doubled up on the sauce recipe and mixed it in a sauce pan. I bought it to a boil and added a slurry. Three tablespoons cornstarch and three tablespoons of cold water, this thickened it nice. I then put the chicken in a 13x9 pan and added sauce. I let bake while turning pieces for about 25 minutes! It's a keeper.
