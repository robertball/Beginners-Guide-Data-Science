Thank you for the great recipe. I am watching carbs & calories so I reduced the pineapple and used fresh vs canned. the pecans are good for daily "MUFA's" needed for health

This was delicious!  I also added cinnamon, ground cloves, nutmeg, and a tiny bit of vanilla extract; then topped them with marshmallow creme since I didn't have actual marshmallows or pecans.  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make it again!

I love this recipe.  I bake 3 or 4 potatoes and then just eyeball the pineapple and pecans.  I also add a couple tsp brown sugar and chopped dried fruit such as mango and papaya.  I do not scoop back into shells, but just serve in nice dish.  I save the leftovers which are just as yummy.

Love this Michelle! I never thought of using the twice-baked potatoes method for sweet potatoes - I really should have though. :) The pineapple was a nice touch. Thanks for the recipe Michelle!

Great idea. I added mini marshmallows and a little cinnamon.

This was delicious! I added just a sprinkle of brown sugar on the tops along with the pecans. This added a lovely crunch to the dish.

Very good. I loved the idea of a twice baked sweet potato and so I had to try this recipe. I did end up adding a bit of coconut to the potato/pineapple mix. And I topped the pecans with just a sprinkle of brown sugar. My family loved this. My little daughter kept going back for more. Thanks!

Tasty, but I wasn't real big on the consistency of the casserole or the cheese topping.  Flavor was very nice though.

It was very, very good.  The pineapple gave a kind of weird texture.
