Excellent recipe! I've been eating pickled eggs since I was a kid, and have tried many recipes. I don't normally add sugar to mine, but thought what the heck, why not! I try not to deviate from recipes when I first make them in order to truly evaluate them properly. I took the recipe submitter's suggestion and added in slices of fresh jalapeño (about half a pepper). At first I thought they would turn out too spicy, but when I tried them the next day, there was no heat at all. Next time I'll just use the whole pepper, sliced.  I'll definitely make these again!

I have a huge jar and changed it up a bit but I love this as a base. I make it with 3 cups vinegar, 1 1/2 water, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tbsp salt, 1 lg onion (rings), 1 garlic bulb peeled, 3 bay leafs. I put 3 cloves in jar and the rest in the vinegar mixture when cooking. Everyone loves my eggs!! Even my 3 year old :P

I love this recipe.   I made a batch with the recipe as written and made another with jalapenos.   Both were fantastic.   The brine has a perfect taste for me, but it could be easily customized for individual tastes.

I make pickled eggs in spiced beet juice.  They do not need to sit a week but only  2-3 days is adequate for the eggs to absorb the seasonings & the beautiful pink color on the outside.  When sliced in two halves the colors are lovely & make a nice presentation.

I have made this recipe several times, first exactly as written and the five stars is for that. (It only gets better adjusted to personal tastes from there) Since, I have tried with red pepper flakes, dill seed, dill weed, onion and even a little chili powder, in varying batches. It is a great base recipe and anything can be added according to what you like.

Great recipe! I like it spicy so I like to add a couple yellow Trinidad Moruga Scorpion peppers.  I usually make 2 dozen at a time. The wait is the hardest part.

This made very good pickled eggs.  I had some leftover mild jars of chiles, and I added a few of these to the jar.  Better than the recipe I've been using!

I love this basic recipe. I make it as listed and also sometimes add onions and turmeric. It's so good either way!

Will definitely make it again 
I made 2 jars    15 eggs in each    they were both consumed within 2 days of opening them after only 2 weeks of refrigeration!  My boys went crazy for them.   This time I will add the jalapeno.

Really good pickled eggs.  I made it just as written, with the exception of adding some mild banana pepper rings to the jar.

We made  these eggs following the recipe with a few "tamed" jalapeños as suggested. They were good, not great, but a good start for sure.  We will use this recipe again with a few small additions.

I was looking for a starting point and this recipe delivered.  I had some spicy pickling spice I wanted to use so I left out the bay leaf and used it instead. I also added chopped red jalepenos. It made for a deliciously spicy egg. Will definitely do these in a regular basis.  The week waiting period is a must.  Our eggs developed an even better flavor after 8 days.

This was great! I think I will add pickle juice and back up the vinegar, but this is a great recipe. Thank you!
