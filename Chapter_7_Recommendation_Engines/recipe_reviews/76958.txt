The base is great, but this recipe makes so much, and once I added the noodles, the leftovers were mush. I would recommend cooking the noodles separately and adding them to your bowl of soup. But other than the mushy noodles this soup is great!

Very easy to make, I purchased a rosemary/garlic roasted chicken and added parsnips instead of peas. My husband and I both have bad colds and it was nice to have a fast homemade soup without all the additives found in canned soups.

I have used the suggested soup base before to make the chicken and rice soup and loved it. Today I used it for this recipe and was equally happy. I did toss in a bay leaf and had to use dried parsley leaves and added some additional chicken broth. Very good!

Omitted the peas and cooked the noodles separately before adding to soup to avoid starchy broth.  Fast Chicken Soup Base a must for this easy and tasty soup recipe

I made my own whole chicken, using the "Simple Whole Roasted Chicken" recipe from this site (stuffed cavity with onion).  We weren't wild about the sweetness of the chicken, or the strong spice of the allspice/cloves/etc.  So I had low expectations when using it for the Fast Chicken Soup Base.  Let me tell you: YUM.  seriously.  The sweetness and spices from using that roasted chicken as a base recipe really mellowed out, and resulted in a great soup.  I heartily recommend both the soup, and using the Simple Whole Roasted Chicken recipe for the base.

I made this last week. It was my first time making chicken soup, and it turned out great! I added carrots and some chopped celery leaves, and served with fresh ground pepper floated on top. It was wonderful with grilled cheese sandwiches!

Wow. Just wow. I am truly amazed that I can make such a delicious, rich, satisfying homemade soup in less than 2 hours. I omitted the peas, kept the noodles seperate & only used about 1/3 cup parsley. Otherwise followed directions as written. BIG hit with the kids, husband, everyone! Thank you!

I loved this soup - it will be my go to chicken noodle soup.  The only thing I changed is I boiled homemade egg noodles in a separate pot because I knew we couldn't get through the whole pot of broth in one go.  I just put some noodles in the bottom of each bowl and topped with broth.  I put the leftover broth in the fridge and I'll just boil fresh noodles again for the leftovers.

The most delicious chicken noodle soup ever. Absolutely perfect. Here's a tip: if you don't like soggy, soft egg noodles, use whole wheat egg noodles. I used whole wheat egg noodles and boiled them separately and then spooned the soup over them in our bowls, as other reviewers suggested. However, I added the rest of the noodles to the pot later, and when we ate the leftovers, even after a week and half, the whole wheat noodles were not too soggy or soft at all.

A bit too many onions, and I would not add the water next time, it seemed to dilute the flavor a little too much.

This recipe is simple, fast, and soooo good! I used the fast chicken base. I accidentally bought a bbq chicken, but the flavor was amazing with the soup! I think the fresh parsley was KEY. Soooo good!

DELISH!  My 11 year old helped make the soup and he and my husband LOVED it (so did I)!!  Simple recipe, not a lot of ingredients, and perfect with grilled cheese sandwiches on the side.  YUM!

I really liked this chicken noodle. it is different then the one I grew up eating and making. In the Chicken soup base: instead if the dried  Thyme leaves I used ground up thyme about 1/4 teaspoon. Instead of all those onions I used 1 small onion. The chichen I didn't use the hole Chicken that way I can make anouther batch. In the chicken noodles: I left out the Peas and Parsley. I also used the wide egg noodles , because I don't like skinny egg noodles.

I used whole wheat spaghetti noodles that I cooked in another pot and then added.  It turned out perfect.  The only thing I would change is when making the soup base I would leave out the skin of the chicken.  It would make it a little less fatty.

This recipe was okay, minus the peas.  The parsley was also a bit much.  Also, I STRONGLY recommend adding the noodles immediately before serving; any sooner and they will turn into complete mush.

Perfect Chicken Noodle Soup every time. I follow the recipe, leaving out the peas (personal pref) and adding a little more veggies and egg noodles, as we like a heartier soup. The Rotisserie Chicken gives the Fast Chicken Soup Base more depth of flavor than other recipes we have tried. Everyone (including my 1.5 year old granddaughter) loves this and it is requested whenever soup is mentioned as part of the weekly menu.

This is awesome and so easy.  I added 2 cloves of diced garlic, salt and black pepper to the veggie mix and used 1 onion when making the soup base.  I also added a bay leaf to the soup and removed it before serving.  Used wheat noodles, omitted the peas (my son hates them) and served with a crusty white bread.  It was just fantastic and hit the spot ona a cool fall Sunday night.  Thank you for an awesome recipe.

This is the only chicken noodle soup that I love! It is simple to make and tastes better with time.  I keep the noodles separate from soup until serving.  I put in as many noodles as I want into each serving bowl.  This way the noodles don't get soggy and gross. Store the noodles in a separate container too.  If you don't want noodles add brown or wild rice.  Either way it is delicious!

This was really yummy, I made it for my hubby when he was sick :(  We had tons of leftovers.  It heated up well bowl by bowl although the noodles did get a little bit soggy.  Still delicious though.

WOW!  Gotta say this is the best chicken noodle soup ever.  And it was so easy using the rotisserie chicken from the supermarket. I used 4 tsp. of instant chicken bullion for the broth and followed the recipe exactly.  My adult son was very impressed and even commented that it looked like it came from a restaurant - love it!!

This was fantastic. I made homemade noodles in the pasta maker, and they turned out fabulous. I made the chicken soup base the day before, and then made the rest the night we ate it. (For a person who works for long hours, it's a lot of prep to do it all in one night.)

This soup was amazing. My fiance said it was better than his mothers...which from him is definitely a compliment. I didn't use the peas though. Unfortunately, it didnt turn out so well for leftovers which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The noodles were mush. I would recommend only using enough for what you will eat them.

Really good, I didn't have egg noodles so I used elbow macaroni. It was excellent. Big hit with my family. Since I didn't have a roast chicken for the soup base I used 2 chicken breasts and cut them up, then browned with the onion, celery and carrots. Next time I will cook the chicken longer so it falls apart.

This was excellent!  I made it for lunch for a group of 12 preschoolers and they all really liked it...the adults all did, too.  Definitely a keeper.

Best chicken soup ever! Only change was that I did not add peas (not a family favorite). Fabulous, actually my husband asked that this become a weekly routine. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

First time making chicken noodle soup. Followed the recipe as wriite. And used the recommended chicken soup base. Big disappointment. It was just "ok" if that. For all of the time and effort involved, I expected much better. My husband and I each ate one bowl, and that was it. I will not be making this again, expected much better.

I had some lancato kale that needed used so I sliced it into thin strips & used that instead of the peas. Also, whenever I make soup I tend to add about a tablespoon of soy sauce as it adds a little "umami" to it. With this recipe I also added a pinch of cayennne.

This is a great recipe and surprisingly easy, considering it was my first time making homemade chicken soup.  Based on other reviews, I added additional seasoning, taste-testing as I went along.  I ended up adding 2 boullion cubes and a few pinches of sea salt, and at the end I still thought it could use flavor.  I added a few sprigs of fresh rosemary while the chicken bones simmered - the rosemary really made the flavor for this soup.  In the end, it was a really great hearty chicken soup, and it made a nice big batch - hubs and I ate it for about 3 days and still froze about a 1/3 of it.  I normally would've given this 4 stars based on the lack of flavor, but in all fairness, the flavor and depth will depend on how the roasted chicken was prepared and seasoned.  The author played it smart by directing to salt and pepper to taste.  A keeper for sure.

This was great!  Took about an hour to make.  Used "original" rotisserie chicken and didn't bother with the parsley.  Added the frozen peas (petite size) after taking the soup off the heat and let sit in there for just a few minutes.  Perfect and not mushy.  Hubby likes lots of noodles and used about half a 16oz bag of egg noodles.  Fed two adults for dinner, plus tiny helpings for two children, and had two lunch portions leftover.

This was good, but I would not rate it 5 star. It called for entirely too much thyme. I do not like it near as much as the recipe called for. However, I went ahead and followed it and was disappointed. Next time, I will use much less. Wasn't bad by any means though!

I prepared this and had a "lot of" Chicken Soup.  (I am single).  I enjoyed it for a few days, froze it and heated it up when a relative and her husband visited.  It was a huge success served over Bob Evans Mashed Potatoes.  I had another bowl of soup later and still have another serving.  Great recipe!  Brenda

Excellent. A massive pot of soup. My kids and guest devoured it with a crusty Tuscan Boule loaf. I don't think the average palate could determine that the base was not entirely home made. That makes it a worthy addition to any recipe box.

The noodles turned out so soggy that no one would eat the soup. I would recommend adding them at the very end. This was a lot of work to have it not turn out.

I thought this was okay. If you like herby soup, then this is great for you. I prefer the simple taste of chicken broth, chicken, and noodles, maybe a few veggies, and little to no herbs. Quality wise, excellent, but I wouldn't make it again. But that's just personal taste preference.

Awesome soup.  I made the stock following the linked recipe for the Fast Chicken Soup Base.  My only suggestion would be to wait to add the noodles until you're ready to eat.  I made the mistake of making to soup too far ahead of dinner and ended up with mushy noodles.  Even with mushy noodles the soup itself was great! :)

Excellent soup, my husband and kids loved it.  I left the peas and parsley out and did everything else the same.  It's the first chicken soup I made without a that stenchy aftertaste.

This soup made with the suggested base was good.  Not the best soup ever, but good.  Next time I make it I'll be sure to not put the noodles in and freeze some of it.  Then I'll cook up noodles as needed.  Also, I will not add peas.  My first bite and I knew the peas were a mistake.

YUM.  I left the peas out and made my own egg noodles ("Egg Noodles" by Linda) and added some additional spices (rosemary, cilantro, ... whatever smelled like it would go well... ;) )  My husband LOVED it!

This recipe was fairly good....but in the process, I had already had the "Basic Chicken Stock" recipe in motion when I looked at this. Being that as it may. I had no frozen peas. I did follow the recipe with adding the egg noodles,fresh parsley and s&p, but lacked flavor. I used fresh carrots and celery instead and added 1 1/2 tsp italian blend spices. And that to me was excellent. I will make this again with the "Fast Chicken Soup Starter" on here the next time. But all in all. My kids were pleased anc couldn't wait to have it again a second night in a row. Thanks.

This is a great soup.  Remember if you are making a large pot, only add egg noodles to the soup you are going to eat (they will continue to expand in the broth if you have left overs that you want to refrigerate).  I love a bowl of this soup with a grilled cheese in the fall and winter months.

I followed the recipe to a "T" except for the following: (1) I don't like onions and didn't have celery, so I only sauted the carrots in 1 Tbsp of oil. (2) In place of onions and celery, I added onion powder and celery salt. (3) I used a smoked chicken since the country store right down the road has amazing smoked EVERYTHING. I used some Homemade Chicken Broth I had frozen a couple weeks ago, also a recipe from this site. I found the soup pretty good, not QUITE 5 stars (maybe 4.5!) but my boyfriend absolutely loved it! I want to try it with a roasted chicken; it was a little too smokey of a soup! :) But very very good.. the base was wonderful! I don't make a lot of soups so I am glad this is very easy too. The one thing I would change for me is using smaller noodles of some type.

After making the "Fast Chicken Soup Base" I cup up the chicken and threw away the bones and skin. Then I continued with this recipe and the recipe "Grandma's Chicken Noodle Soup."

My husband and I agree, this will go into regular rotation. Instead of a rotisserie chicken I boiled 3 large chicken breasts in the broth/water for 20 minutes and then removed and shredded the chicken w/ a fork. Added 2 serano peppers for heat and 3 cloves of garlic. Also reduced the olive oil to 1 TBS to sautee the vegetables along with some spray olive oil (worked great). We didn't have fresh parsley so I used 3 sprigs of fresh basil. Next time I will make more broth as it wasn't soupy enough for our taste. Wonderful recipe!

Definitely a fast chicken soup.  I just did 1/2 the onions after reading reviews and added some onion, carrot, celery top and fresh thyme to soup base.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! This was incredible! At first it looks difficult to make as well as lots of time spent making it but it was pretty easy. Here is what I did: The night before we made homemade noodles and let them air dry overnight and all the next day. We roasted our chicken, pulled off all the meat then started our Fast Chicken Soup Base. As soon as we added the bones and skin of the chicken we started cooking our homemade noodles so they'd be ready to add in at the end. We followed the rest of the recipe exactly. At the end after the onions and carrots were soft (we didn't add celery) and we added the chicken, broth and thyme is when we added the noodles. This had an absolutely amazing taste. I can't get enough of it. I personally think the homemade noodles give it that extra speciality. Definitely makes it to my recipe box! Thanks a million!

I was thinking that I was going to have to settle for this version since I didn't want to take all day to make the soup.  But this soup was PERFECT, and I will never simmer a chicken all day for chicken noodle soup!  The only variations were that I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil, one onion instead of two, and medium egg noodles instead of wide.  Can't wait for leftovers!

As good as all the rave reviews suggest.  Don't need to change a thing. I did use whole wheat noodles and just put in the whole 16oz bag...it worked perfectly.  This will become a family staple.  thanks!

I was pleasantly suprised by this recipe. I made this tonight because i din't have alot of time and it tastes like I spent hours on it:) I did add some poultry seasoning and a 2 cubes of chicken boullion but really, it would have been good without it. I did add 3 cups of noodles:) Made garlic rolls and it was great. I'll be making this again for sure.

This is without a doubt the best chicken soup recipe I have found. I didn't change a thing. I used a seasoned rotiserrie chicked from a large grocery chain here. I also used the Fast Chicken Soup Base recipe. It was very flavorful. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I left out the peas. The fast chicken soup base is really the key. You can really taste the thyme and parsley. I added sea salt. It is the best chicken noodle soup I've ever made/tasted.

This soup was excellent.  The flavor was really good.  Even the kids loved this soup.  I boiled chicken breast and used the broth from that.  Also, I cut down on the amount of thyme to 1 tsp.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this without the peas.... thought I had them, but there were none in the freezer.  Delicious, have so much left over that I will have to freeze it, but its really really good.  My toddler kids loved it!

I love this soup! My husband hates soup and he has asked me to make it for him agin, two days latter. He said it was the best soup he had ever had and this is the first chicken noodle soup I have ever made. I used our leftover turkey and it is wonderful. However I did add 3 cloves of garlic extra carrots. Oh and I had these really expensive italian noodles and used those and the pasta never got soggy. Even when I heated up the leftovers. My two year old daughter even liked it. I made it when I was sick and the ultimate throaght soup.

Perfect for a great, basic chicken noodle soup.  Tastes like what your Grandma would make, but it's super simple.  I add extra garlic, fresh ginger, and red pepper flakes to the stock to give it some kick, and that really bumps it up to a 5 star rating for me.  Also, I use the frozen egg noodles..mmmmm.  Perfect on a cold day or if you feel like you're getting sick.

This was quite tasty. I left out the peas and added the onions with the carcass, straining them out. When I think 'Chicken noodle soup' I don't think onions but they are important for flavor. I will make this again.

This is DELICIOUS!!  I used dried parsley instead of fresh. And used baby carrots for a little sweetness in the bite. Fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I am not a soup fan but my whole family (incl picky 6 y.o. and 2 y.o.) loved this soup!  I didn't have peas on hand but will be sure to add them next time b/c we all like peas alot.  I had egg noodle mini bows instead of regular egg noodles and they worked great.  Made for easy little kid spooning.  I'll make this again!!!

This soup was really easy and very yummy.  I just finished slurping up the rest of the broth out of my bowl.  I always add way more veggies and noodles than the recipe calls for and it held up fantastic.  This is the one that I will keep on making!

I was happy with the way the base and soup turned out.  My husband has a cold and requested chicken noodle soup.  Instead of Campbells like I normally do in these situations, I decided to surprise him.  Growing up in a family of Vegetarians, it kinda grossed me out to have to take the meat off a chicken and throw the bones and skin in with the chicken broth, but ultimately it was worth the dirty dead.  I did not add the peas because it didn't sound good to me, and used only one onion instead of two as another reader suggested.  Also, I added two cups more water as the soup tasted a little concentrated.   This was excellent!

I gave this 5 stars because it is really easy and a great classic recipe.  It is fast to throw together and my family loved it.  I boiled some frozen chicken breasts and cut them up instead of using store roasted chicken.  My picky 6 year old even liked the noodles!

I made this soup last night for my daughter and her family because she and her baby were sick with colds.  It was fast and delicious.  I did not add any salt and pepper at the end because it was just right without it.  The taste was really good.  I have never made home-made chicken soup and thought it would take hours to make.  With the fast chicken stock recipe, I was done in about an hour.  We loved it and will certainly make it again.

I used the Fast Chicken Soup Base and this was excellent!  I didn't use the peas or thyme, but I did use a bay leaf.  My husband and kids LOVED it!  I'm a vegetarian, so I used the same recipe with vegetable broth and the Quorn brand chicken tenders and that was great too!

Absolutely delicious.  I left out the peas and parsley.  Used store bought chicken.  Is a little time consuming but worth the effort.  I couldn't get enough of this soup.  Reminded me of my mom's homemade chicken noodle soup when I was growing up.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. Made this recipe as directed, with the exception of adding more carrots because we love them. This turned out great. And it was really, really easy. I've made several other homemade chicken soups from various recipes, but I think this is our favorite.   A side note: I didn't add much salt as the other flavor were so delicious. Taste it first before salting.  Thanks for the recipe. :)

I have only made two soups in the past, one with a tomatoe base, and one with a creamy base so I was worried that this soup would come out bland. But it was amazing amazing amazing!!! I made it because I was sick and i felt better immediately. Also if I may add I dont like left overs. I can usually force down ONE bowl of left overs but after that I am sick of the food. I had something like 8 bowls of this soup and I never ever got sick of it! It stores well and YOU WILL LOVE THIS SOUP!! I might just make some this weekend!

This worked out really well with some mods.  First, WAAAAY too much onion in the base.  Use just one small/medium onion.  Too little liquid, and the water is too bland.  Started out with the recipe and ended up adding concentrated chicken broth AND 1+ more quarts of chicken broth.  Next time I will just use 4-5 quarts chicken broth, and more carrots to round that out.  Substituted whole grain rotelle.  Holds up and is better for you.  Did not put the chicken skin the broth.  Yuck.  Next time I may add white beans too.  My kids liked it--the ultimate tasters!

Really, really good. Used raw chicken (legs) for the soup base (cheaper!) instead of store-bought roasted chicken. Family loved it.

Excellent recipe with the combo of the Fast Chicken Soup base.  I've been making this at least 1/mo for at least the last 2 years.  Sometimes I have to settle for dried parsley if I don't have any fresh.  And we often add mushrooms.

This soup was good, I made it because I have a very bad cold and wanted a good homemade recipe. It was pretty good, but a little bland. I added 2 cloves of garlic while saute the veggies and oil. I also left out the peas.  Great recipe ENJOY!!

Excellent! I didn't have egg noodles but used another kind and I added corn. This was so good, so much better than store bought soup.

Really good! I used only 1 lg carrot and 1 lg celery stick... no peas. It was perfect for my taste, though I wish I used less thyme. Maybe 1/2 of what the recipe called for (Fast Chicken Soup) would have been better. I will definitely keep this one to make again!

I made the Fast Chicken Soup Base and finished the recipe as Classic Chicken Noodle Soup minus the green peas.  My husband declared this was the BEST soup that he has ever eaten.  I loved it, too.  Even my picky eater ate it.  BRAVO!

With a cold, wanting some homemade soup, I turned to this recipe and saw just how a great chicken soup can blow the canned stuff out of the water. This soup is full bodied, but not heavy.  The flavor is full and rich, leaving nothing to be added, unless you choose.  We were fresh out of carrots here, but it's not like this recipe needed them.  The base is great and I followed the recipe to a "T."  Well pleased, to say the least.  This is a keeper and a wower.  Wow!

Great soup, starting with the Fast Chicken Soup Base. I modified it a bit, only used half a large onion and used 1 cup orzo pasta instead of egg noodles.  My kids love it!!

Excellent!!!!!   Easy, flavorful, and gone in one sitting.  My college student asked me to make a batch and freeze so she could take it back to college (and she's my picky eater!)

The 3 cups of dry noodles are WAY too much for the amount of broth.  I added only 1 bag (1 & 1/2 cups, dry).  Otherwise, are really great base recipe.

Family LOVED this recipe! Added crushed red peppers to broth for a little spicy kick- really was a hit. Also substituted whole wheat noodles for egg, yummy!

Everyone loves this in our house and quickly became a staple!! Only thing is that sometimes it needs a little extra broth so it's more of a soup instead of a stew. I actually love it when made with the Bourbon flavored rotisserie chicken. Great recipe!

Lower Fat Adaption: For the stock, use 1 skinned Ch breast carcass, along with the 2-3 quarts of chicken stock(made from "Better Than Buillion Chicken" base) and 1 tsp thyme,cooked 10'. Separately,saute 5-6 thinly(1/4")sliced carrots(we love carrots),2 chopped onions,and 2 chopped stalks of celery in 3-4tbsp of good olive oil, 7-10'. I find adding a splash of a nice riesling or other nice white wine midway adds a nice flavor during sauteeing. Separately, take the 2 chicken breast halves(from the ch.breast carcass used for the stock) and cut to 1/2 thickness. Tenders usually separate away as well. Add to a covered steamer(medium heat) for no more than 2 1/2' per side, then let cool 5'. Add the sauteed veggies to the chicken stock while the breasts are cooling and simmer uncovered 5-10' (remove carcass).The reason for steaming the breasts is twofold:1)it cooks them quickly while preserving juciness and 2)they are shreddable easily by hand once cooked this way. I find chopping doesn't deliver the same result. Go figure! Add 12-16 oz.fresh(NOT DEHYDRATED!!)pasta to the chicken stock/veggie mix, along with the hand pulled chicken breast and the chopped parsley. Simmer 2-3'max(until the pasta is to doneness),salt and pepper to taste and serve. If you prefer more chicken, use more. This recipe has much less saturated fat because it doesn't use bones or dark meat or skin. You have to be careful not to oversteam or overheat the shredded chicken breast. I did not add the peas, but that

great recipe, i've been looking for a chicken noodle soup that would be easy but taste homemade!  i did try it with whole wheat noodles just to keep it on the healthy side, not as good as egg noodles, but still good!  i also added some garlic!
