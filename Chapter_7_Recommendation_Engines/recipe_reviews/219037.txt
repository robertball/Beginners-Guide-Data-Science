Tastes great. I feel the pan size listed is a little too big and spreads it too thin. Go with the next smallest size down.

It can't possibly get any easier than this. I had a bag of Andes Creme de Menthe baking chips floating around and I didn't know what to do with it. I did an ingredient search and landed on this recipe. I didn't get the color effect because the Andes mints are a bit different than the Nestle morsels. However, it was absolutely delicious and super easy. I'll make these again and again.

I wanted to make a bark with green mint and Andes mints so I borrowed this recipe and ti came out beautifully!  I use Semi Sweet chocolate for the base and crushed cookies in the base then took white morsels and colored them and added mint and swirled it into the dark layer.  I topped the whole bark with Andes mints that I chopped up and when the chocolate was cooling, I pressed them onto the top.  It came out delicious!  I will try nuts next time. :)

This is my kind of recipe -- insanely easy yet makes an impressive gift.  I found it was easier to just eyeball the amount of chips I used to fit my pan size.  I just dumped them on and spread them out until they covered the surface in a uniform, flat layer.  I put a layer of foil on my pan first, then parchment paper.  When I didn't have enough chips to cover the whole pan, I just bent up the foil to make a smaller area.  When you're swirling the chips, be sure to get the tip of your swirling implement (I used a wooden kebab skewer--worked great) all the way down to the parchment paper.  If you just try to swirl on the surface the bottom will look blobby after it hardens. Also, I used chopped up mint Oreos to sprinkle over the top.  It tastes great with the cookies!  I can't wait to try this with other types and colors of chips. I gave this as part of my Christmas treats this year, and people were raving about it.

Easy recipe and still tasted very good but my bark came out all 1 color not swirled with green. I use the dark chocolate and mint morsels. I don't know if I swirled the chocolate too much but needed to do this to get the chocolate to melt. Any suggestions?

I couldn't get the morsels to melt or turn shiny. After about five minutes I pulled it out of the oven it had a dry texture. So I ended up keeping the tray over pan of water on the stove top. It looked like some plain chocolate, So I could not do the beautiful swirls shown in the picture.

I used white choc chips, mint flavoring and green food coloring cause I had those on hand instead of mint chips. It was great.  My husband is addicted.

Insanely easy recipe, but it tastes great! I did without the almonds since I didn't have any around and it still came out great!
