I'm generally not a fan of canned soup, but I do believe it has its place from time to time as it does in this recipe. Not knowing when we'd be eating supper, I decided to play it safe and make this roast in the CrockPot. After mincing the fresh herbs and garlic, I sort of bound it all together with a little olive oil, then inserted the herb/oil mixture not only into the slits I cut, but rubbed the rest onto the surface of the roast itself.  I mixed the cream of mushroom soup with white wine rather than the water called for, which I knew would contribute nice flavor. The roast was fragrant, flavorful, moist and tender. I wasn't pleased with the looks of the gravy once it came out of the CrockPot, so I strained it, then thickened it on the stovetop with a little cornstarch.  It wasn't the prettiest roast I've ever seen, but it sure was one of the tastiest, and I'd definitely make it this way again.

My family loved this recipe! I made a few minor changes. First, I didn't have fresh herbs, so I used dried. I mixed the herbs and 2 cloves of garlic in a bit of olive oil and rubbed the mixture onto the roast. Then I topped the roast with onions. When the roast was done, I scraped the toppings into the pan and added the soup and water. I served it with roasted red potatoes and carrots. I was really good!

OMG! this was beyond good! I did make a few changes, I used cream of chicken soup and chicken broth instead of water and basil in place of rosemary. Rosemary is just too strong a taste for me. Like I said, just gggggreat!

I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and mixed the herbs with olive oil and basted the meat with it. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms to the soup mixture and warmed it on the stove before adding it to the drippings.  FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!

My family did not like this. I did not use salt or pepper as the recipe said. Everyone said the meat was bland. I followed some of the other suggestions and placed all the herbs and garlic  in olive oil and rubbed the meat prior to cooking.  I guess I was counting on the soup to be flavorful enough w/o adding extra salt.

Quick, simple and beyond excellent.  I was out of thyme so substituted with italian seasoning. My husband hates mushrooms and he commented on how good this was several times.  This will definitely be featured on our table again.

Rather than use the water as called for, I used white wine and added sauteed mushrooms.  I baked the pork chops covered with fresh thyme and rosemary in my very old Magnalite pot with lid at 225 degrees for several hours before making the sauce.  This was an easy recipe that did not require very much time on my part, and that was the beauty of it.

if your pork roast does not give off a lot of drippings, don't overcompensate with water, still just use the required amount and adjust the water once the soup is thoroughly heated to make sure it still has gravy consistency, very good flavor and easy to do

I don't know who came up with the recipe first, but Sandra Lee on The Food Network has this (almost) exact recipe...with the same name. The only difference is hers calls for 1 cup skim milk instead of 1/2 cup of water. And the wording is slightly different... http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sandra-lee/herbed-pork-roast-and-creamy-mushroom-gravy-recipe/index.html

I liked this roast. Next time, I will cook it a little longer. It was very juicy and the gravy was a good complement to it. I will make it again.

I combined my fresh herbs with a little olive oil and rubbed on the pork tenderloin. I cooked the pork a little too long, but the gravy was perfect. I used chicken stock instead of water.
