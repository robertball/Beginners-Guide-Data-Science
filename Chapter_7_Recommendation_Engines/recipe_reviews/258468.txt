As y'all will do, I made some slight changes. I used an entire box of beef stock (4 cups) and baby portabellas (they were on sale); Omitted the salt, went heavy on the pepper, garlic and added roughly 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce on HP for 30 mins. And heck yeah I used 1/2 the sour cream in favor of full fat cream cheese: We're EATIN here! Served with some nuked string beans on Styrofoam plates with buttered wonder bread.

This was very good, but could be better still. I used a whole onion, Worcestershire instead of soy sauce and beef broth instead of chicken, and stirred in the noodles when adding. Next time I will add more garlic and salt. 

DO NOT ADD FLOUR UNTIL VERY END OF COOKING! It can be dangerous to add thickeners prior to the pressure cooking stage. Wait until after the pressure cooking is done, then add the thickener and use saute setting to cook down the sauce a little.

I can only fairly give this four stars as written, but with two important changes, I believe it goes right up to a five star recipe. In place of the chicken broth, sub in beef broth. Second,  skip the soy sauce and use Worcestershire sauce instead. When you add the egg noodles, stir them in to the dish, don't just pour them on top and leave them there. The instructions are not very clear on this as written. When you make these few changes, this is a delicious meal for sure!

Made this for dinner tonight.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It OK, not wow great.  The next time I will incorporate some of the changes others have made - beef broth not chicken & Worcestershire sauce instead of soy.  I think both of those will help give it more depth.  I'm also going to flour the meat prior to browning.  The recipe itself is poorly written & a bit hard to follow when it comes to the cooking time.  You don't need to time how long it takes to come to full pressure, just how long it cooks at full pressure.  So the steps about 10 minutes, then 10 minutes at high pressure - just confusing & unnecessary.

What a great one pot dish. Of course everyone will make some changes. Here’s what we did:
1 Add 4 ounces of cream cheese to the finish, decreasing the sour cream a little;
2 Used two tablespoons cornstarch as a thickening agent ;
3 Lots of freshly ground pepper-we added a lot;
4 Next time we will add Worcester Sauce, probably two tablespoons ;
5 We used beef stock instead of chicken .  

This made our “to keep” file. We will surely make it again

This meal is the 5th meal I’ve made with my pot.  Changes I made - 2.5 pounds of meat, beef broth (just made sense), and Worcestershire (because SO many reviews said so).  Next time I will just brown my meat in another pan because there was too much meat to brown efficiently in the pot.  I also changed the order up a smidge based on my experiences so far.  I started cooking the onion first, then browned meat, then added spices.  Removed the meat mix (to be sure I was able to see the bottom) and deglazed with the beef broth.  Added back the meat and mushrooms (sliced), stirred, and pressured. I did NOT add flour (because I had a prior burn experience with flour), but chose to thicken with a few tablespoons of cornstarch (tempered, of course) after the noodles cooked.  When I started pressurizing the first, I was skeptical that there would be room for noodles but I waited to make a decision until It was done with the first pressure cycle.  It had cooked down to under the halfway mark, even when I added in about 8 ounces of noodles.  My bag was 12 ounces but I boiled about a third of the package plain on the stove for my littles.  This was delicious and only took me about 10 minutes longer than the listed time, which is saying a lot about the accuracy of the recipe because I am VERY slow in the kitchen!  I highly recommend this recipe (definitely at least with the change to leave out the flour and thicken at the end!)

AMAZING. I love beef stroganoff and have tried several recipes in the past.  This one wins! I subbed  worcestershire for soy sauce only because we were out of soy sauce, and beef broth instead of chicken broth since it made more sense to me.... and it was DEEELISH!!! Will make again and again. And SO EASY.

I used a whole box of chicken stock and I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some Worcestershire sauce to the original recipe.
It was my first time using the Instant Pot and I was unprepared for the huge splatter with the quick pressure release...make sure to put a tea towel over the release valve otherwise you’ll have sauce sprayed everywhere!
Other than that though, it came our really well.  Everyone thought it was very tasty.

This was  fantastic.   I’m not sure why others shared it had no flavor.  It was flavored beautifully- if you follow the recipe.  We used the chicken broth and worscestershire sauce combo.  And only used 1/2 the called for thyme.  When I added the noodles I also added 1/2 C more broth and I placed the timing for 4 minutes and let it naturally decompress  for 2 minutes 30, then unleashed the valve.  The noodles came out perfect.   I’ll make this again and again.

I've never been a huge fan of beef stroganoff but this recipe has changed all of that. It has become a favorite and we make it about once a month. The flavor is incredible and it is so easy to make. If you do not have chicken broth, use a heaping tablespoon of "Better Than Bouillon" in 3 cups of hot water. 

There is one flaw in the recipe. There isn't enough liquid to cook the noodles properly. After putting the noodles in, pat them down a little and then add about 2 more cups of hot water.  The amount of water will depend on what type of noodles you use and you may have to do a little trial and error with it. It took us a couple of times to get it just right. We use dried egg noodles so 2-3 cups of water is usually enough. A couple of reviews have said to stir the noodles into the mix after you add them. DO NOT stir the noodles in until you are ready to add the sour cream. They will burn and stick to the bottom.  Adding the extra water will allow the noodles to cook properly without burning or sticking and it will still have the right consistency.  If you want to add a little more zing to it, serve it with some shredded cheese on top.

New favorite Instant Pot recipe! Like many other reviewers, I substituted Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce, and beef for chicken broth. I left out the thyme (didn't have it, didn't miss it) and mushrooms (they're gross). I also doubled the sour cream... Because my love affair with dairy knows no bounds.

Followed the directions exactly, except for a couple of modifications suggested by other reviewers: used beef broth (a 4 cup carton) instead of 3 cups of chicken broth, and used worcestershire instead of soy sauce.  It was delicious and I can't imagine it without the worcestershire. Oh, one other slight difference: I used a 12 oz. bag of extra wide noodles instead of a 16 oz. bag, and it was plenty of noodles.

As for the process, I did follow that exactly. After reading one review I was a little nervous about throwing the flour in there as directed to thicken, but it was fine. Do be prepared to clean the valve of your IP well, though, because the sauce sputtered through it on the quick release. 

Even with the extra broth and less noodles, the liquid didn't quite cover the noodles. When time was up, they looked a little underdone where they weren't covered. I stirred the pot and covered it again for a couple of minutes and everything was fine. The sauce was a perfect consistency to coat the noodles, and the meat was tender and flavorful.

After reading other reviews I made the following changes: used whole onion, used 2 cans of beef broth in place of chicken,used Worcestershire sauce in place of soy, used two eight oz boxes of baby bells which I sliced. Cooked meat and onions and spices 15 minutes, added twelve oz bag of egg noodles which I stirred into the meat mixture and cooked five minutes, added two tablespoons of flour to mixture and cooked on sauté setting for several minutes, turned off and added sour cream which I stirred in thoroughly. WOW!! The noodles tender and well flavored, the beef was tender and well cooked. My first attempt with the instant pot and it blew my wife and I away. Will be trying other new dishes soon and coming back to this one often.

-Only use half the noodles. The full amount is too much
-Don't add ANY of the salt. There is plenty of salt in the other ingredients.
+Add 2 TB of Worchestire sauce
+/- Substitute beef broth for chicken broth
+Add cooking time both before and after the noodles. I found the listed time way too short - the meat was tough when I added the noodles. I cooked the noodles for a total of 15 min, not 5. I had tender meat at the end, but next time I will increase the initial cook time, plus cut the meat much smaller. 1-inch cubes are odd to eat.

I used a whole onion and probably more mushrooms than called for, and it turned out perfect. Definitely on my "do this again soon" list. Froze 1/2 before adding Sour Cream for future use.

While this tasted good….used a whole box of beef broth, 2T worcestershire sauce and 2T cornstarch, 12 oz noodles…..the presentation was Brown, capital B.  The parsley helped but maybe some diced carrots next time?

Added paprika since that's kinda traditional with stroganoff, turned out amazing! I'll definitely make this again but will try it with the beef broth and Worcestershire the next time. First full recipe in my pressure cooker so it took some figuring to get it to temp but once I did I was on my way

I cut this recipe in half. Also, I believe the time to prep it is sort of misrepresented. Cutting the onions, garlic, meat, mushrooms, etc. took much longer than specified here. And I'm not a doddering old fart. Also, five minutes to cook egg noodles when added? Ahem, that didn't work. Adding an extra 20 minutes did. It's a tasty recipe, but you should probably count on 2 hours to prepare and serve, which I will do in future. That's not actually bad. Instant pots have limits and trying to make them truly instant is a mistake that will cost you in frustration in the long run.  Always factor in the time needed for the pot to reach pressure. This recipe states an hour and 2 minutes. I'd love to hear from others who actually cooked it in this time to see where my 8 quart Instant Pot is failing.  Again, very tasty recipe. Timing seems off.

First of all, this recipe is deelish as written! However, I wanted to cut back on the carbs so I made the recipe without adding the noodles. However (big mistake coming up) I did NOT adjust the broth (the noodles need the broth to cook). So, after 20 minutes of cooking I essentially had a "soup". I managed to save it by adding in flour to thicken it up. Next time, I'll adjust the liquid down and I'm sure it will be perfect!

Did the same as everyone else: beef broth and Worcestershire sauce, added the flour later.  I didn't have sour cream so I did 2 cups of mushrooms and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup at the end.  turned out pretty good. would make again

Just perfect as written.  I have made it twice and will
be doing it for guests too.  If you make it in the Instant Pot,
Use a very small amount of flour on the meat or you
will get a “burn”message over and over.  Ask me how I know!

Not too great.  Use 12 oz of noodles instead of the 16, otherwise your noodles will come out hard.  And be sure to stir them in.  If you do not have enough liquid, this recipe won't work.  After a few bites, went straight to the trash.

As others suggested I changed to beef broth (4 cups) and worcestershire instead of soy sauce. Everyone loved it.

My family tried this tonight for dinner and it was AMAZING! It was hard not to go back for seconds. The meat was fork tender and flavorful. I read the comments before I started and used Worchestershire sauce instead of the soy. We didnt have Thyme, so I used Italian seasoning instead. We also substituted turkey broth we had lefover instead of chicken broth. It seemed odd a beef recipe would call for chicken stock. Anyhow, it was Amazing and I will definatley be making this again.  Printing the recipe now so I have it. My Instant pot is one of the BEST Christmas gifts my husband has Ever given me!

This was my first time making this. I too substituted soy for worchestire sauce. I also used only about 12oz of noodles (highly recommend). I used about 1.5 cups of sour cream. Beef broth instead of chicken. A whole onion instead of half and probably 2 cups of mushrooms. I dashed about a teaspoon of paprika with the sour cream at the end. It turned out AMAZING.

This is a great one pot meal. I did use worchestire sauce in place of the soy. Next time I will use sirloin instead of stew meat. Definitely worth making again.

So so good! I also use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and beef broth instead of chicken as I feel like those compliment beef more. Otherwise, this recipe is on my instant pot rotation.

It was very yummy and quick to prepare.  I incorporated previous recommendations and used beef broth.  I salted and peppered the meat and used the instapot to salute the meat for 6-8 minutes first.   I cooked the meat/onion/mushroom mix on high pressure for 10 minutes.  I did a quick release and thoroughly stirred in the noodles as shown in the video and mentioned by another reviewer. 

Other recipe changes:  I also added 1 T of Dijon mustard to the broth, used fresh thyme instead of dill and substituted yogurt for sour cream.  (My husband did not know about the latter.)

This was easy and pretty good. I only had a 1.4lb sirloin steak so that’s all I used and it was enough for the recipe. I also added about 1 tablespoon of worchestershire sauce to it after cooking (after reading others reviews) turned out great. I will say that next time I make it I will add some horseradish to it as well. I have an amazing beef and noodle recipe I make that’s used horseradish and it’s great! I chopped some parsley and added it the end just for some color.

I ended up with noodles that were way overcooked. If I made it again I would reduce the cooking time with the noodles, but since it was also rather bland, I would not make this again.

This was the first recipe I made in the Instand Pot and it was very good.  I made it exactly as stated until it started to cook, then I looked at the reviews.  When II added 12 oz. of noodles, I also added 1/2 cup beef broth and 1/2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce.  The meat was incredibly tender and the noodles were done as well.  I will make this again!

Followed other suggestions:  used beef broth and red wine, not chicken broth.  The kids wanted it over rice, so I reduced the liquid by 1 cup and added an extra TBSP of flour (rice was cooked separate).  Used the rest of the ingredients though.  Solid dish!

This is a really solid recipe as written (of course, I changed the soy to Worcestershire and the chicken broth to beef because those have GOT to be mistakes!). I subbed a cup of wine for some of the beef broth, it imparted a deeper flavor in the meat.  I also took out the flour altogether (the starch from the noodles was enough to thicken) and I added a half block of cream cheese.  With these corrections, it's a 5-star for our house!

I followed the recipe without any changes (except no onions). When it was time to add the noodles there wasn't much liquid left. I stirred in the noodles and when the timer went off there was no liquid n the noodle were barely done. I had to throw it away. My boyfriend doesn't want to make it again. IF I do make it again I will add a lot more liquid.

Fantastic! I read a lot of the reviews and incorporated other suggestions. I used a whole onion, around 6 cloves of garlic (we LOVE garlic), the whole box of chicken broth (what was I going to do with the leftover cup?), one TBSP each of soy & Worcestershire sauce. I cooked the beef for 15 minutes because my pieces of beef stew meat (Costco) looked larger than what was in the video. So flavorful! ***Update-made for the second time but this time I got the “burn” error message-I guess I didn’t scrape the bottom of the pot prior to starting the pressure phase. Also used (2) 8 oz packages of mushrooms-forgot to mention that in my first review. ***Update-made for the third time and got the burn message again-I read a lot of the reviews and next time I will not add the flour (or corn starch?) until later.

This was our first recipe in our Instant Pot. We made it exactly as the recipe directed, and even though we were still trying to figure out how to work the Instant Pot. It came out yummy, and is new family favorite! This is rather surprising as the hubby isn’t a fan of sour cream mixed into his food, and the daughter isn’t a fan of mushrooms. Both of them raved about the meal, and even liked it despite containing things they are normally averse to.

Have never cooked noodles in Instant Pot and couldn't understand how they could cook in 5 min. but to my surprise they were done. I might mix noodles in at the stage they're asked for rather than just empty pkg. on top of meat. It calls for 16 oz. pkg. of noodles. My pkg. of noodles was 12 oz. and that was more than enough. Maybe a little more sour cream than asked for but all in all was delicious. Meat was so very tender. Will make again for sure

I made this exactly as directed in my brand new Instant Pot. It turned out great! Well seasoned and the beef was so tender. The only reason I took off a star was because, like others wrote, the instructions don't specify that the noodles should be stirred in. I kind of assumed, but I can see how some people might not. Also, when I did the quick-release of pressure before adding the noodles, some sauce came sputtering out and made a bit of a mess. Next time I think I'll let it naturally depressurize for 5 minutes or so before doing the quick release. I'm definitely planning to make it again!

Very good and easy. I did make a couple of adjustments. I used Coconut oil, gluten free egg noodles and Almond Flour to keep it within our gluten free guide line. Cheated a bit by using the Soy Sauce but wanted tbe flavor!! My instant pot has allowed me to get back in tbe kitchen and enjoy cooking. I am disabled and cooking big healthy meals has been a challenge. But not with the instant pot. Love it!

Per other recommendations I used beef broth and worcestershire instead of soy sauce.  I had to omit the mushrooms as I'm the only one who likes them.  

Next time I'd add more beef broth and less noodles - 16 oz is way too many!!!  We had almost no sauce!  Other than that, it was tasty

I made the following modifications: used worchestershire sauce in place of the soy, added a couple of glugs of red wine and used an entire box of beef broth instead of the chicken. I also didn't add the noodles into the instant pot bc I wanted to freeze it, and it was really watery, so I reduced it on the stovetop for 20 minutes--perfection!

It is good, but not that healthy overall. May be worth trying to use low fat sour cream, less salt, and more mushrooms than beef.

The best best beef stoganoff I've ever made, fork tender beef.  I did use 1/2 beef stock and 1/2 chicken.  But that's because I had stock I needed to use up.

I followed the recipe as written except I didn't really measure the seasonings and I added more mushrooms than called for.  It came out delicious.  Best part was that it was done in one pot so clean up was super fast and easy.  The family loved it!  Will be making it again for sure!

I used 4 cups beef broth and Worcestershire, but still found this disappointingly bland compared to mom's  stovetop recipe or a slow cooker red wine recipe on this site.  This was however truly  a one pot recipe, extremely quick, and the meat was very tender.  I was concerned about crispy noodles another reviewer noted so cooked for 6 minutes after mixing and found them much too soft for my palate.

This was better than I thought it would be!! I think next time I'll add a little more liquid as I had some crunchy noodles. I used beef broth and Worcestershire sauce based on other reviews.

This was delicious. The only problem is that the pasta absorbs all the liquid and so it becomes rather dry. But still very delicious. i would definitely make this again.

As it turns out, you can just add the other half of the onion if you forgot (or hate) mushrooms. Very tasty.

So good! Followed other’s advice. Used beef broth and Worcester sauce. I sautéed the onions then added the mushrooms. Took those out of the pot, and browned the meat. Served with a dollop of sour cream and biscuits.

I like this recipe because it gives you fork tender beef and perfectly cooked noodles in one pot.  But I too made a lot of changes -beef broth instead of chicken.  Worcestershire instead of Soy sauce. Dried Chinese mushrooms (presoaked, stemmed and sliced)  Basically I upped the seasonings.  Not sure if I would bother browning the meat again.  It didn't seem to make any difference.

Like many others, I’ve found a keeper. I use beef broth or stock, more garlic than called for, lots of black pepper, cream cheese instead of sour cream, and thicken at the finish with corn starch.  Thanks for another good Instant Pot meal.

I have a new instant pot. Trying different ways to use it.
I made this last night and my husband and I really loved it.
It was a Sunday. We eat pretty late, but once I have a cocktail, I usually don’t want to cook. I followed this recipe with a few tweaks. Used Worcestershire instead of soy sauce. I didn’t have any chicken or beef broth. I used some mushroom base and demiglace mixed with water and boiled. Also used some corn starch mixed with some red wine instead of the flour. I did the recipe up till where you add the noodles, did a quick release and just let it sit for about an hour. Then I added the noodles and a half cup more of the broth. Then I cooked as recipe states. Delish!!

This is the second recipe I’ve made in my IP. We LOVE it! I have a family of 3, our sone is 3 1/2 and he loves it too! I would say that the original recipe made waayyy too much for our little family. So the second time I made it I halved the recipe(everything except for the spices) and also substituted like some others the chicken broth for unsalted beef broth(to keep sodium down) and also used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy. Because I didn’t halve the spices there was no problem with blandness??. This recipe is now in my group of rotating staple meals! Thanks OP for sharing, and everyone’s tips in the reviews, you all rock!!!

Followed recipe to the letter. Came out too dry and sticky, and noodles were not cooked thoroughly. Next time I will use more broth, beef instead of chicken, and maybe a can of cream of mushroom soup before adding the sour cream.

Instructions are great.  Cooking times right on.  Meat was very tender, noodles cooked just right.  

I did think it was a bit flat on flavor and don’t know what I could recommend to give it a punch.   Maybe it’s the chicken broth used instead of beef.  IDK.

I used worchestershire instead of soy sauce and beef broth instead of chicken, as others suggested. Used a jar of sliced mushrooms as I did not have fresh. Noodles did not cook through the first time and I cooked an additional 3 minutes and did a quick release, but they were then a little overcooked. Flavor was good. Family liked it. Will make again.

Like many others I used beef broth and Worcestershire vice soy sauce. The dish toured out very well and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I also put in a cornstarch slurry at the end of the instructions. The second serving was better, after the sauce had time to thicken. I will add paprika next time. I had plenty of liquid for my noodles.

Used this recipe many times.  Substitute home style meatballs. Every time I make it, I do something a bit different, This is a great basic recipe to start from and make tasty changes.  This sauce is also great with mashed potatoes instead of the noodles.

Made it tonight and everyone loved it! I also substituted beef broth for the chicken and Worcestershire sauce for the soy. I added the sour cream after it all cooked and it curdled. I’m sure my timing was off. It was still delicious.

I love this recipe. It has become one of my staples and my family goes crazy for it. The only change I made is to omit the mushrooms as my husband hates them. We all agree that the soy sauce makes the recipe. Might try the beef stock next time but have to keep the soy sauce.

It was good stroganoff but the noodles were under done. I'd add more broth, probably beef broth, and one cup of sour cream instead of 3/4 cup. I will make again but will add some time and broth to insure the noddles are cooked.

Took other users suggestion of using beef stock and worchestershire sauce instead of chicken broth and soy.  I'm glad I did, the flavor was spot on and the meat is tender and very delicious..... But it is sooooo soupy.  I ended up adding corn starch and more sour cream just to thicken it up.  I will cut the liquid by half next time, but will definitely make again.  PS - I recommend making the noodles like normal on the stove top.  Pasta doesn't turn out great in the pressure cooker.

I made the changes suggested by others; I used beef stock and Worcestershire sauce. I also deglazed with a cup of red wine. When I added the egg noodles, there wasn't enough liquid left, and I had to add a cup of water. In retrospect, I should have used stock, as the water diluted the flavor, and I had to add more salt and seasonings to compensate. I still feel like something was missing, so I added 2T of red wine vinegar, which really balanced the flavors nicely. Other changes: 2tsp paprika and 1T prepared mustard.

Followed other suggestions by subbing Worcester’s sauce, box of low-sodium beef broth, and 12 oz bag of wide egg noodles.  Added paprika, parsley flakes, and Italian seasoning (didn’t have thyme).  Did not add salt, did add lots of pepper.  Did not use flour; instead mixed in a little cornstarch and water when noodles were done, and stirred on sauté setting for a couple minutes before adding the sour cream.  I would tweak the cooking time a little next time - 14 minutes for the meat, 6 minutes for the noodles.  Served with kale salad, whole wheat baguette, and red wine. Very flavorful and yummy on a snowy evening!

It was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I cooked the meat for 20 minutes.  Make sure you stir the noodles well before your put the lid back in the pot. I missed a few and the tips were a bit crispy on a few of my noodles.

Made it as written but, whole onion, more garlic, red wine instead of soy sauce, 4 cups of broth, ( we like a lot of juice) little extra flour or corn starch for thickening the extra liquid, used a better cut of meat cube. Fantastic.

I used gluten free noodles and broke them a little to make them sure they were down in the sauce when cooking.  I substituted  3 tbs of Golden BBQ Sauce unsweetened by Primal Kitchen for the soy sauce to give it a little more of a tangy flavor.  New family favorite.

I cooked the beef mixture for a total of 15 minutes to ensure the beef would be tender. I increased the cooking time for the egg noodle mixture to 8 minutes, total. 
I reduced the salt to a total of 1 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp. of paprika. I used a whole onion and four cloves of minced garlic.
I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth.
I added about 1 teaspoon each of chopped parsley and chopped chives.

This was the first thing I made in my Instant Pot.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it came out very tasty. I used a beef shoulder and the beef came out nice and tender. I was a little worried that 16oz of egg noodles would be too much in the pot for the cooker but it fit just fine and cooked evenly. Definitely going to make it again.

Just received my Insta Pot for Christmas and this was the 1st thing I made.  It was fantastic!  Will make it again and again.  Only thing I would change is add more mushrooms.

I made the suggested changes opting for beef broth added some cream cheese instead of sour cream but still seemed a bit bland. Also, I stirred in the egg noodles but those that remained on top were still hard. I would recommend making sure all noodles are on bottom, none left on top.

I made a few small changes to the recipe and it turned out great. I used a whole onion, five garlic cloves and slit the soy for half soy and half  Worcestershire.

I left out the mushrooms, otherwise followed the recipe. The noodles on the top of the dish while cooking, did not cook completely. Overall it was good and I would make it again. My first instant pot creation. Not appetizing as leftovers

With a few changes, recommended by other reviewers, this was fantastic! I did substitute Worcestershire sauce in place of the Soy sauce. I also added cream cheese, more sour cream, parsley flakes and chives. It was fabulous! Although I made a few changes, to suit my personal tastes, this was a terrific base recipe to start with. It is very easy to tweak to suit your tastes. I will definitely be adding this one to my collection for hearty, simple meals that the whole family loves. Thanks for sharing Lissa!

Will definitely make again - my 1st recipe in a InstaPot.  I would not cook the noodles and veggies as long as they overcooked.  Could be a rookie mistake with new device.  Added red wine, and beef broth for a richer gravy.

Rib sticking! As others have said, use Worcestershire Sauce and 4 cups of beef broth. I truly didn’t need the thicken the 4 cups of broth were absorbed by noodles. I used No Yoke 12 oz package and it was plenty and I love plenty of noodles. Allow yourself an hour total cook time. Trust me still much faster that Dutch oven. It’s a keeper and if you are cooking for 2 you will have leftovers. Easily feed a family of 4 no problem.

Went with the whole recipe an was really underwhelmed.
If I were to make this again I'd add another cup of broth, more garlic, and make it a lot more creamy.
The noodles were half cooked (with stirring them into the broth mixture).
This is due to my own error in judgment and blindly following this recipe.
If you do make this dish maybe try cooking the noodles before you add them.

Always a favourite...use Beef Broth..just makes sense right? ...and Worcestershire (yep ..had to look at bottle for correct spelling) instead of soy.  The twist I did this time...just because I had it left over from Christmas ..instead of 3/4C SourCream... did 1/2C sour cream...and 1/4 left over "hell of a dip" onion chip dip... pumped up the flavour nicely.... though not needed all the time! Enjoy... we did :)

Followed the recipe exactley!  I would use beef broth instead of chicken, and add a bit of w. sauce as others mentioned. Flavorings in this dish were perfect. It was delicious. The beef turned out amazing. 
The downside of this recipe was the amount of liquid. When we added the noodles there was not nearly enough liquid to moisten/cover all the noodles, so we added just under a cup of water, and stirred. Some noodles were still not in liquid, but we carried on following the instructions. Once we opened it again, the tips of noodles that weren't in liquid weren't quite done, so we stirred it and closed it and let it sit for an additional 10 minutes. 
We will be making this again!!!

First thing you should be careful of is to NOT BUY THE DRIED YELLOW egg noodles, these suckers will suck all the moisture in your stroganoff and might even burn the bottom. Get the fresher, thicker stuff (off white in color, usually labelled "old fashioned") your stroganoff will turn out much moister.
Second thing is that ground thyme is not the same thing as dried thyme, if using ground, cut it to about 2/3 of what the recipe calls for. Your flavor will be much more balanced in the end

Love this recipe- turns out wonderfully every time! As a way to make it a true one pot meal, you can add the noodles into the pot after cooking the beef etc and set it to pressure cook for “zero” or two  minutes (depending on how firm or soft you like your noodles) and by the time the pot has come back up to pressure, your noodles are cooked. Then you can stir in your sour cream and you’re all set. A true one pot meal!!

This dish smelled fantastic while cooking, but then the flavor was just okay. Seems like too many noodles, as well. Wish there were more veggies!

Great! Very simple and delicious, even my husband could cook this on his own and have great results. I used a chuck roast and homestyle egg noodles. I'm saving this so we can make it over and over!

I did make the changes that others had Worcester and beef broth as a substitute. It was so good! Someone else said to add the flour later, I would do that. When I did the quick release I had the liquid spitting all over.

Don't think it was the recipe that was the problem,  think it was the broth which tasted chemically.  Too Too bland though.  Will add more interesting next time. Used sirloin ethic near delicious tender morsels.

I following the recipe pretty closely except  I used reduced sodium beef stock instead of chicken stock and Worcestershire instead of soy.  I also omitted the thyme ( personal preference) 
In less than 30 minutes I had perfect beef stroganoff which usually takes hours to cook mainly to get the beef tender. My wife who’s been very skeptical about instant pot cooking is now a firm believer. 
The great part about this type of cooking is how easy it is and how quickly it’s in your plate. You can toy around with the recipes all you like and as long as you get the liquid ratio correct it’s nearly foolproof.

This was my first meal with my new Instant Pot. I was surprised how easy it was. But, you really have to have everything cut up ahead of time. I swapped out the soy sauce for Worcestershire sauce, because it has a richer flavor. Will definitely make again!

This was an awesome "one pot meal", and will definitely make it again. I also, as someone else mentioned, emitted the salt, and used lower sodium beef broth ( not chicken broth as called for). The only thing I think I would do differently the next time is to add a bit more sour cream...it seamed to be lacking the flavor of it. But nevertheless it was very good!

I read through a LOT of user comments and used many of the suggestions. I added more garlic- about 6 cloves, I omitted the salt, used beef broth instead of the chicken stock, used less noodles, went heavy on fresh black pepper, added cream cheese but was STILL just left with a very bland tasting dish. The only good thing about it was the fact that It was cooked fast in the instant pot vs. slow cooking all day in a crock pot, but the store bought packet seasoning for beef stroganoff is still preferred over this recipe for me.

I used some of the modifications recommended. 
Beef broth in place of chicken broth.
Dusted the meat in flour prior to browning.  Also added the 2T flour listed in the recipe.

Probably one the best instapot meals I've made so far.

I will make this again, but with changes.  Use a whole carton of beef broth instead of chicken broth.  Use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  And cook the beef longer, 15-20 minutes.  10 minutes is done, but longer for it to be tender.

Super awesome and easy meal. One of my new go-to recipes. Made it about 4 weeks ago and it impressed a lady friend of mine and myself. It made its way back on to my meal prep rotation for the week only this time I cut the beef a little smaller. Highly recommend exactly how it is. I occasionally garnish with a light sprinkle of parm.

It was the first I made when I brought my new Instant Pot home. It was easy and delicious! I forgot to buy regular soy sauce when buying the other ingredients. I only had lite soy sauce and used that. I will use that in the future! I also added more sour cream because my husband and I love it so much. I'm making it again tonight to share with friends. It will definitely be a family favorite!

I followed the recipe exactly. It has a bland flavor. I added Dijon mustard to the left overs to get some taste to it. If you wanna try this recipe, follow the other reviews recommendation and use beef broth and worchestershire sauce instead. Also consider adding Dijon mustard.

I did make some changes. I used Olive oil instead+ added a little onion powder over the meat when seasoning w/salt + pepper. I also added "better than bullion" beef paste + a little red wine  after sauteing + before adding chicken broth. I added 1 cup sour cream +  a scoop of cream cheese. My family + I loved this! My pickey son said it was "resteraunt quality". It really was delicious! *MY FIRST GO WISE USA PRESSURE COOKER dinner meal a success!

Very easy and flavorful meal.  I substituted canned mushrooms and should have had more.  I was pleased with the texture, particularly the noodles, cooked together in one pot.  This will definitely be a go to meal!

I added quite a bit more chix broth. I need more moisture in mine. The original recipe looked far to dry to me.

I added a bit of worcestershire sauce and made sure to incorporate the noodles when I added them and it turned out great. My family loved it. I used chicken stock, which is what I had on hand, but would probably use beef stock if planning ahead in the future.

I made it according to the directions. I figure if I made changes, I can't really review it. The gravy was runny. The flavor was not what I'm used to stroganoff tasting like.  It might just be my personal taste, but it's not something I would make again.

Wow! Hall of Fame Recipe!
Like other reviews, I subbed beef broth for chicken broth and Worcestershire for soy sauce. I used a heaping tsp of thyme and used the minced garlic in a jar and about a heaping tsp of it too. Used a little more broth than called for-2 fulls cans. It could use even more broth. Next time will use a full carton of broth-about 4 cups.
My husband is pretty picky and doesn't like mushrooms. He LOVED this and had 3 servings, mushrooms and all. Same thing with my 12 year old daughter. I am going to get them to like mushrooms one of these days. Anyway, this is FABULOUS! Especially good on a chilly evening. Try it with a nice glass of red wine and you will be in heaven!

This was easy and awesome and i received multiple compliments on it.. Seriously impressed. I will definitely do this again. Next time I'll probably cut the sus meat smaller and sear/brown in batches too achieve a better sear.

First time trying stroganoff in my instant pot. This recipe was a hit. Only thing I changed is adding beef broth,  worcheshire and parsley to garnish. Turned out to be very tasty along with green beans and buttered bread.

I followed everyone else with respect to replacing soy sauce and chicken broth.  The stewing meat was beautifully tender, but we found the dish to be bland.  Will probably make again, but will brown meat in cast iron to get some caramelization going on.  That’ll help with flavour.

Stroganoff so nice that Ive made this twice already, actually I supervised while my 7 year old daughter made it. :-)  Had to add extra seasoning to my liking in addition to what was already listed on the ingredients list (worchesterchire, fish sauce, cream cheese, dijon, paprika). Followed the recipe through but used a 12oz bag of pasta and did not have a problem with undercooked or overcooked noodles. Also used a different cut of beef, first  time I tried top sirloin and the second time I used what was already in my fridge which was rib eye. Going forward I would stick with top sirloin for the beef.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was WAY too salty!! And using stew meat was a mistake. Next time I will use tenderloin. There wasn't enough liquid so it was was thick and sticky. I gave it 2 stars because it was very easy to make. I'll keep looking for a better recipe. I was surprised because it had so many high ratings.

I’ve made this twice now. I prefer less thyme than the recipe calls for and I suggest quick release after the pasta has had its time or the noodles become over cooked.

My very first recipe using my OnePot.  Came out perfectly.  Super delicious.  This will be part of a regular meal rotation.  I used beef broth and Worcestershire sauce as many others suggested.  The noodles on the very top weren't quite done, so after I stirred in the sour cream, I just put the cover on and let it sit about 5-10 minutes.  Perfect noodles.

I’m still learning what the timing means so there were a few hiccups.  Anywho...I used Sherry instead of soy sauce, beef broth instead of chicken broth and Marjoram instead of Thyme.  When it finally came together it was delicious and the meat was very tender.

Really good!  Very easy, fast and one pot.
Hubby asked to leave out the sour cream next time. I thought it was a bit peppery.  I also used about half the salt. 
Would like to see what Worcestershire Sauce tastes like instead of soy sauce.

I have a secret to make beef stroganoff extra special.  To me, stroganoff is best made in a slow cooker with my secret ingredient.  I have tried stroganoff without my special ingredient and was very unhappy with it.  Great basic recipe.

Followed all the suggestions & it came out delicious!! I peppered & floured the beef before adding to sear. Deglazed with a splash of wine & some broth. I didn't add any salt. Did 1 tblsp of soy & worchestershire each. At the very end added half stick of cream cheese & about a quarter cup of sour cream softend & mixed together. Next time I'll only cook the noodles for 3 mins. They weren't too mushy tho. The meat was really tender & it had super rich flavor! It took me about 2 hrs total to do.

I cooked the meat for about 20 minutes before adding the noodles. I then let the noodles cook for about 10 minutes. I also added red wine,  a lot more onions and a bunch of mushrooms. We all went back for seconds. Delicious!

I thought this was pretty tasty. It was my first time using the instapot and I was surprised how long it took to prepare. About an hour and a half from start to finish. Next time I will add less noodles and make sure they get stirred in so they cook properly.

I made it and it was great. I did make one small change. At the end instead of putting raw noodles in and cooking an additional five minutes, I pre cooked the noodles according to label instructions and added them. I then added about a cup of sour cream stirred and covered in the pressure cooker and let stand in the warm setting for about 20 minutes. I guess it really would not matter which way you did the noodles but I feel my way lets the noodles absorb the salt while preboiling and not give the noodles such a bland taste. Again it is a great dish and a quick way to prepare.

This is an easy recipe with great results.  

The only change I made was red wine for the Worcestershire sauce. 

This reheats well

Huge hit with my picky boys. Simple to make and the smell lured even the most reclusive of shut ins out of their room.

I did follow the many suggestions to use beef stock instead of chicken stock.  Plus, I added Worschester sauce.  The flavor was decent but the texture of the chuck steak was very unappealing.  
Although the sauce was fairly good, I will not be making this again because another meat with chew should be used.

This was my first time using my Crock Pot Express Pot, so it took me a little more time. After reading some reviews I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and beef broth instead of chicken broth. It turned out great! The beef is so tender.

Perfectly adequate  base for stroganoff. As is, just about any one would eat it. Great to experiment with more refined stocks, or to zazz up your self. We eat it. It’s good. I like beef stock and a splash of fish sauce for some extra zazz.

Noodles were perfect.  I opted out on the mushrooms... not a fan.  Also,  added a large squirt of regular mustard in with sour cream.  (Both sour cream and mustard I added to taste)
Lived this easy to make recipe.

Really good, easy recipe, and quick recipe. Would recommend having all your ingredients pre-measured out prior to starting the meat. I eliminated mushrooms and added green beans instead, cut the beef in half, and used wheat noodles instead of egg noodles. This is a pretty flexible recipe. Only recommendation is if you use wheat noodles instead of egg noodles, add an extra minute in the final cooking step.

I followed the mods I commonly saw in the comments: used beef broth (not chicken), Worcestershire (not soy), lots of freshly ground multi color peppercorns, lots of garlic, and split the dairy evenly between sour cream and full-fat cream cheese.  Delicious! We loved it, especially the al-dente noodles. USE CAUTION though -  it's best to hold the flour til the end, right before the dairy.  I added the flour to the meat cubes before browning, thinking that I would prevent that starchy splatter during quick release. Nope.  I ended up cleaning that sticky mess off the  countertop, cabinets, ceiling lights, and me.   If you add the flour before pressure, be sure to do a VERY SLOW quick release :-).

I made this and it was FANTASTIC. I made modifications recommended by others; no added salt, beef broth, flour on the meat pre browning. I deglazed after everything was sautéed or browned, and added .75 cup sour cream after opening the lid. It was seriously good... you should try it.

This was a pretty good recipe! The Instant Pot made it easy and pretty quick. We followed the directions above and felt like it was a bit bland - maybe more pepper next time? I added paprika to leftovers today. There's no garnish listed in the recipe but I think it'd be a good touch. Overall a great basic recipe.

Excellent recipe, but I did use beef broth instead of chicken, and added 1/2 c. red wine to all ingredients before adding the noodles.  While really good, I think I will use LESS noodles next time, maybe 12 oz rather than 1 lb.  Will also try worcestershire sauce, although was excellent w/soy; then decide which I prefer.

Delicious, very good.  I made it per the recipe and had no problems. I used 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 Worcestershire. When  I put the pasta in (I used a brand called Mrs. Miller's  Old Fashioned Extra Wide - the only flat wide noodles my grocery store had) and gently stirred them around in the liquid for a 2-3 minutes, timed it for 5 minutes, and timed the slow release method for 5 minutes. The pasta was cooked perfectly.  I will make again.

I am still learning to use my pressure cooker, so I had a couple of oops moments.  I forgot to push the start button, and later forgot to close the steam valve after I added my noodles.  But I finally got it finished  and it was really good!  I used beef broth instead of chicken, and left out the mushrooms because we don't like them.  We loved the flavor.

Followed some of the changes made by AintGotTimeForThat. Used an entire container of beef stock (4 cups), used baby portabellas, added extra pepper and garlic,  2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. Substituted half of the sour cream for cream cheese. Garnished with green onions. Would increase cooking time of beef for longer next time.

I would use a better cut of meat.  Tender, but not much flavor.  I would also slice the meat into thin strips, instead of chunks.  Otherwise, a great recipe and I'd make it again!

This comes out perfect every time. I love L&P (Worcestershire sauce); definitely traded that for the soy sauce. Sometimes a splash or red wine if I opened a bottle. Sometimes I use dried mushrooms. If it’s not “saucy” enough when time is up, I just set the IP to sauté and boil some of the liquid off. This is one if my go-tos and I’ve shared it with a lot of folks.

Ok  I made one key change.  I swapped out the need for 2 pounds of ground turkey.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  Otherwise I followed the directions .  What this makes is a classic comfort food which is bad for me because I love to eat it.  Great recipe.

I made this as written, it was very simple and easy to put together. But it just lacked something I even substituted Worcester sauce in place of the soy sauce but found the recipe and lacking in something not quite sure what. Probably will not be making this again.

Made this with suggested changes of beef stock and Worcestershire. Turned out excellent. Of note, on first release, insure you cover vent when doing quick release or you’ll have a mess. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but stir in the noodles. I’ve read where some don’t and have a bad experience, but common kitchen sense suggests noodles be submerged in order to cook.

Used beef stock instead of chicken and will used 1/4 to 1/2 cup more next time. Great flavor will definitely make again.

Wow! Delicious! My teen sons and husband just loved it, seconds, thirds, mumbling- really good Mom!  I think I would reduce the salt, it has the soy sauce in there already so next time I would add less salt. It’s a keeper and so easy!

The consistency of the noodles was excellent. Beef was tender. While some might find the taste a little bland, my 2 and 5 year olds loved it,  and my husband didn’t dislike it. Makes a nice pot full for a big family.

I made it exactly like it read and my husband LOVED it!  He has always talked about an old hotel in Lake Zurich, Illinois that had the best beef stroganoff and this came so very close.  I asked him if I could make it again and he said ABSOLUTELY!

I always like following the recipe as written the first time I make it, so I made no changes. Love how tender stew meat is when prepared in an InstantPot! The flavor was good but lacked the depth of flavor I was wanting. Never used soy sauce in stroganoff before and thinking  maybe Worcestershire would fix that. It’s a good recipe.

definitely would have been a five star if all the changes recommended where in the original recipe. I did use Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, also did use beef broth cause like everyone else said it just made sense. I did not add the flour cause my instant pot does not recommend adding thickening agents while pressure cooking so I waited and did cornstarch mixed with water at the end before I added the sour cream. Definitely will make again with all those changes cause it was a 5 star dish super easy and very flavorful

It was delicious and I followed the recipe with chicken broth and soy sauce.   The only thing not giving it 5 stars was the length of the cooking time with my instant pot.  It took forever to do a manual release the 2nd time after I put the noodles in and before I added the sour cream.   I don't know if I did something wrong or what exactly.  Other than that my family really loved it!  Will make it again, only start much earlier in case it takes this much time again.

Genuinely delicious!  But I'm wondering as I wander, if the original recipe was configured for something larger than my 6 quart, which it seemed to overfill and make for quite a mess for cleanup.  Meantime, it's really really good!

Some of the directions are confusing (at least to me, a novice with pressure cookers) (e.g. "Close and lock the lid. Set timer for 10 minutes. Set to high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 15 minutes." Am I supposed to set the timer for 10 minutes THEN turn it to high pressure for 10 - 15 minutes or close & lock and go straight to high? Same for "Seal and bring to high pressure again, about 5 minutes; cook for 5 minutes." Again, it sounds like I bring to high for 5 minutes then cook for 5 minutes, which means high for 10 minutes. I'm confused.)
But in the end, the dish turned out deliciously.  
Minus one star for the directions.

This was really easy and tasted great. I cut the salt in half, used beef broth and Worcestershire instead of soy as others did. Added 2 cups of fat free sour cream and dusted the flour in at the end until I had the consistency I wanted. Next time I will shorten the noodle cook time as I felt the noodles we beyond soft.

I followed the directions as written, but my noodles were still somewhat hard at the end. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize this until I added the sour cream, otherwise I would’ve added more broth & cooked longer. Next time I’ll add more broth at the beginning because it still tasted good despite the hard noodles.

This was the first recipe I made with my new Instant  pot that I got for Mother’s Day. I made some changes such as substituting Worcestershire  sauce for this soy sauce and beef broth for the chicken broth. I also decreased the salt 1 teaspoon, added 1 teaspoon of paprika  and used just 12 ounces of egg noodles. This was a good recipe to use as a guide since I hadn’t cooked with an Instant pot before.  It’s a keeper, my husband loved it!

Next time I will use half the pasta and double the liquid (perhaps adding some cream of mushroom soup to the chicken broth?), so that I get a more pleasing consistency. With the 16 oz of pasta per pot, all the liquid was so completely absorbed that the dish was to congealed. But the flavor was great - the thyme is an especially nice addition - brighter than oregano.

This is a great recipe. We have picky eaters who don’t like mushrooms so I minced them and they cook away to nothing, leaving only their flavor. A crowd pleaser!

A really yummy recipe. Usually when I decide I want to make this I do not have stew meat so I substitute round steak. I have this on hand because we butcher our own meat. And like others on this page I use Worcester sauce instead of soy, beef broth instead of chicken. Just feel like it makes sense. My other change is I used drained canned mushrooms. I can’t ever remember to get fresh ones ahead of time! Sometimes I substitute other pasta I have on hand if I don’t have the noodles but the noodles are best. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! Keep them coming!

I used 1 1/2 cups beef broth, pressure cooked for 15 minutes, then added the mushrooms and pressure cooked for another 5.  I didn’t want to cook the noodles in the instant pot so this helped reduce the sauce.

The cooking time seemed like way too much, so I set my Instant Pot to I think 6 minutes without the pasta (then quick release) followed by 4 minutes after adding the pasta (and mixing it in). I probably could've gotten away with 3 minutes after adding the pasta and will do that next time. Also, I didn't brown/cook the beef at all prior to pressure cooking. I waited to add the beef until I had followed the other instructions leading up to pressure cooking then just added it in (mixed it up) and pressure cooked. That saved me even more time, and it was cooked perfectly well (and tender).

I also used 4 cups of beef broth instead of 3 cups of chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce; and I didn't use flour (or corn starch, or anything to thicken it--didn't seem necessary).

Having made those changes, it turned out great--very delicious and easy to make!

I love the recipe. The only concern I have is that I got the BURN signal from the IP every time the noodles are added.

I did the worcestershire sauce and beef broth substitutions, and cut up beef chuck (not sure I'd bother with this next time).  I also increased it to "11 servings", which ended up being about 7 dinner servings for adults.  (I did have to cook a small portion of the noodles outside of the pot.. you could probably fit them in, I was just extra nervous.)  It was delicious and I will definitely do it again!

OK but not great.  Thought that there were way too many noodles compared to sauce. Next time I would cut in half as leftovers were very dry.

Huge hit with my family!  Although I would probably reduce the amount of time with the noodles, maybe only 3 minute with natural release.  (They were a little to soft for my liking). Would give it 4 1/2 stars because I modified a little.   I like dry red wine in my stroganoff, so I added about 3/4 cup.  But this is a keeper!

Solid stroganoff recipe! My whole family loved it. I was a little skeptical at first because I already have a go-to stove top stroganoff recipe, but this one is fantastic too made just as written.

I followed other suggestions and switched to beef broth and Worcestershire sauce.  This will sound nuts, but I really wanted stroganoff and my husband hates mushrooms so I omitted them.   After the noodles cooked, I stirred in a few cups of baby spinach until wilted, then stirred in the sour cream.   It came out awesome!   Cured my stroganoff craving and made him happy too!

I would definitely cut down on the amount of meat next time and switch the chicken broth to beef broth. It was still good though! Plenty of leftovers!

This is the first time I’ve ever used my Instant Pot and this recipe has made me a believer! It was so good, I created an account here after viewing recipes for years just to leave this review. Next time I will add another minute or two to cook the noodles because they were a little firmer than I like. I  cut up  a beef chuck roast and used 3 cups of beef broth and it was so tender and delicious!

It was amazing! I am not great when it comes to preparing meals. Don't get me wrong, no one is starving in our home but my meals are not talked about as being the best thing since peanut butter and jelly. This was so easy to make and the flavor was perfect. As others suggested, I used all beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, flour at the end and stirred in the noodles. Next time, I will add more water....maybe I can cook after all.

It was ok. Definitely kind of dry and not the usual beefy flavor and creaminess I expect from beef stroganoff. I like the suggesting of beef broth instead of chicken, worchesire sauce, and maybe cream cheese. Not sure if I will get to try this again. Once you strike out with the kids they have long memories ??

As with the other reviewers, I used beef broth instead of chicken. I subbed Braggs liquid aminos instead of soy sauce, just because it was handy. Just before putting in the noodles, I tasted the sauce and added a splash of Marsala wine for more depth.  Stirring in the noodles when you add them is essential, which I learned the hard way.

I made the same changes as most everyone else, I used beef broth but I only use 2 cups because I used one cup red wine. And because I have not been cooking with my Ninja Foodi very long I didn’t understand the step that didn’t say to stir in the noodles, I just added them on top and they were not all done so I had to repeat that step. My noodles got too done because of that. I have homemade crème fraîche, which is super easy to make and tastes fabulous. On YT Chef John of food wishes explains how to make it.

This was the best beef stroganoff I've ever had. I did change it to beef stock from chicken. I also did a five minute natural release in between adding the noodles, (instead of the quick release) and it being finished. Those were the only changes I made. It turned out better than expected! Definitely will be making again.

Winner-winner stroganoff dinner! ????
..........  ?  ..........
*Entire family gave both thumbs way up.
*Even my notorious veggie hating picky eaters. ??
*Made enough for 2 meals for a family of 4. (froze half).
..........  ??  ..........
After reading a ton of the reviews (AND my Insta-pot manual for its "Maiden Voyage" on this recipe!...)

I made the following modifications and was shocked at the ease, relatively small prep and cook times, and also enjoyed the delicious, filling results:

·sub 3TB worcestershire sauce for soy sauce.
·add whole onion v. half.
·sub 1lb baby mushrooms quartered.
·sub beef broth for chicken broth (entire 4 cups in broth carton).
·sub jarred minced garlic for fresh.
·reduced egg noodles to 12oz
·add 2oz cream cheese and chive spread AND 2oz regular cream cheese.
·doubled pepper
·decreased added salt by half.
·trimmed and cubed a 2lb beef bottom roast versus buying prepared stew meat. (*per the recommendation of our local butcher.*) -substantially cheaper
-less fat
-no added cuts or trimmings as in grocery store "stew meat".
·increased cook time to 15 minutes in pressure cooker after saute function and 8 minutes after stirring in AND tamping down 12oz egg noodles.

Good, but slightly bland. But that's easy to remedy to personal taste.  I made with Beef Broth and Worchestershire sauce (per other reviewers).  If I make again, I'll add more broth (4 cups instead of 3).  I also used 2 lbs top sirloin that I cubed myself--very tender and delicious!

Super yummy and easy! This was my first ever recipe in my instant pot and it turned out perfect! I did add some extra spices to push the flavor a little but other than that it was great and the left overs were good as well Will be making it again!

Followed all directions and also substituted Worcestershire for soy sauce. I found no problem adding the flour early as the 3 cups of broth diluted it well. Also I used beef bone broth (homemade) in place of chicken broth. At the end when the noodles are added I also included one cup each of frozen peas and frozen corn. This way the kid gets his veggies. Turned out FANTASTIC!!

AMAZING! So delicious. The only changes I made were gluten free rice noodles and dairy free sour cream. After adding the noodles I put it on high pressure for only 2 minutes, since any longer they will turn to mush. I will be making this often from now on!

I thickened it after all the pressure cooking was completed, used extra garlic, fresh thyme and a bay leaf  when pressure cooking the meat. Followed the rest of the recipe. Will use Worcestershire sauce next time rather than soy.  Family loved it anyway. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was my first time making pasta in the Instapot. Make sure that you stir the pasta into the sauce before putting the lid on. I would add a little more liquid to the sauce next time.

I made similar changes to others: 
Beef broth instead of chicken
Worcestershire Sauce instead of soy sauce
I also only used 8oz of egg noodles instead of 16.  It turned out pretty good.

My first experiment with my new Crock Pot Express Multi-Cooker and I'd call it a huge success!  My husband and I both loved it. I was skeptical about cooking the noodles in the pressure cooker, but they came out great. After reading some of the reviews, I did add some additional beef broth (I initially used chicken broth) and a little Worcestershire sauce before cooking the noodles. This is a keeper for sure!

  We made it with beef stock instead of chicken. 
Stewing beef was so tender from the instant pot. 
This will definitely be a repeat.

5 stars with the changes I made. Can't see why you'd use soy sauce, I replaced it with Worcestershire sauce and used beef stock instead of chicken broth. I added more onions to my taste. It was very good and the directions were easy to follow. I'm a new instant pot user and at first I found some recipes to be overwhelming this on isn't.

I followed others suggestions and used beef broth and Worcestershire.  I only use 3 cups of broth and should have used 4.  I also stirred in the pasta (12 oz).  I didn’t use onions- personal preference.    My family liked it and I will probably make it again.

Only giving this a 4 star review as I believe the directions were written incorrectly.   I used Worcestershire sauce instead of Soy sauce, and beef broth instead of chicken broth.  I ended up using about a 1/2 cup of Worcestershire sauce, and added extra salt and pepper in the end as I felt the flavor was very mild initially.  I also added my flour mixed into a 1/4 cup of broth added in the end to thicken.  The cooking times were also written in a confusing manner, I did the initial cook 10 mins, added noodles cooked for 5 mins, then added sour cream and thickener in the end and let it sit for a few mins before serving.  Initial reviews from the kiddos are positive.  It is yummy, but I think the flavor will really come after sitting overnight for leftovers.

Like other reviewers, I used Worcestershire rather than soy sauce, which struck me as an odd choice for stroganoff, and I also used beef rather than chicken broth.  I may reduce the Worcestershire next time because it has such a strong flavor. Finally, I waited until after all the pressure cooking was completed and then added just 1 TBS of flour gradually, before adding sour cream.  My husband loved it!

Yes, I put a can of cream of mushroom soup in and used beef broth instead of chicken broth.  And we made homemade ice cream for dessert.

This was excellent!!!  The meat was fall apart tender!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I am new to using the instant pot so it took much longer then I was thinking it would.  Waiting for the pot to get to the right pressure takes time that I did not account for in my time calculations.

Cooked the recipe as is and I loved it! My only comment would be that the broth got soaked up by the egg noodles and disappeared, so you might want to add an extra cup!

Yum!  This was really good. I have a small instant pot (3 qt), so I halved the recipe. The meat was tender but not mushy, and the sauce was delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

Thought the recipe was delicious as is. The only thing I will change is the cooking time for the noodles. They were still tough at 5 minutes so I re-cooked for 4 more minutes, which was too long.

Pretty good. I don't know if the Instant Pot is really needed for this recipe as it took a little over an hour to make, but I will probably make it again, but with more sour cream.

Was made exactly as written and came out delicious! Will definitely make again. The only change is to reduce the amount of pepper to 1/2 tsp as the amount listed is too much.

I added 4 cups of chicken broth because 3 didn’t fully cook the noodles, and it cooked perfectly I just felt it was a little bland. Had to do much more seasoning when it was finished. Instructions for cook time were perfect though.

Will make again! My teenagers ate it and liked it! I didnt have chicken broth, so made with beef. Also used  Worcestershire sauce instead of Soy.  No thyme either. Basically made it with what I had without going to grocery store. Turned out pretty good. Thanks for sharing recipe!?

Not bad. I'm new to instant pot so I forget how long it takes to pressurize. Top noodles were a little more stiff/ dried out without being able to mix but overall good taste and sirloin  was VERY tender

Beef will take a bit longer to cook, as will the noodles. I found leaving the pot in "warm" mode for about 5 minutes after de-pressurizing should get the noodles perfect.

I just recently bought an Instant Pot.  This is the fifth thing my husband and I have made with it and we've only had it about five days.  The first meal I made with it was gross.  I'm so glad I ran into this recipe because it makes up for that first meal and now I love my Instant Pot.  Thanks for giving us this recipe!  We followed the recipe exactly as written and we will definitely make this again, and soon!  Oh, we used the wide egg noodles like the recipe calls for.  They turned out great.  I wanted to use my favorite Amish noodles but didn't know about using them in a pressure cooker, but after I made this dish I read the reviews and saw one person mention they used Amish noodles and said it turned out delicious.  So, next time I will use my favorite noodles of all time!

This was the first recipe that I tried with my new instant pot, and it was wonderful. My non mushroom eating husband didn't even notice the mushrooms. Everybody loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.

This is a good starting recipe. The recipe uses way too many noodles. Next time I will use half. I added Worcestershire and omitted the thyme. Next time I will use beef broth instead of chicken broth. There were so many noodles, they didn’t cook evenly. I had to add liquid and cook some more.

This is the first meal I've prepared in my Instant Pot! It turned out perfectly. Totally sold me, especially because it's a one pot meal! I added about 4oz of cream cheese just because I love to indulge, and had I read the reviews before cooking I'd use beef broth instead of chicken as well. I am looking forward to more Instant Pot recipes!

I will makes this again. I will probably cut back on the salt. I did use about a 1/4 cup of full fat cream cheese just because I always do when I make stroganoff.  I am so surprised how tender the meat was and how perfect the noodles came out

I made it per the recipe.  It was delicious!  I used a chuck roast, and it was very tender after cooking.  I did omit the last bit of salt which was fine, because it was seasoned enough.  Also, would recommend shortening the cooking time for the noodles by one minute, as they were a little mushy.  otherwise, will definitely make again!

Pretty darn good when made with venison and venison stock. I also added thinly sliced carrots with the mushrooms and frozen peas at the very end. Love my veggies!  Replaced the sour cream with Greek yogurt (it was in my fridge).   I am likely to add more seasonings the next time that I make it.

No flavor. Needed way more cook time. Didn't have beef broth or I'd have used that as recommended by so many people. Did us worcestershire sauce though. Not sure I'd make it again. I've had much more flavorful recipes. Just feel like something is missing?

I made this and followed recipe exactly as it states. My meat need to be cooked just a bit longer and I used a more "homemade" noodle and it was too much noodle. Other than cutting back on the pasta it was good but doubt I make it again.

This recipe was even better than I expected!  My husband and I loved every bite.  I did substitute canned mushrooms and had to forego the thyme.  We will making this recipe part of our regular rotation. It's wonderful!

I too made a few adjustments.  I only used salt to season the beef.  I used 4 cups of BEEF broth, but will cut that back to 3 because there are wayyy too many egg noodles!  I also changed soy to Worcestershire sauce.  I used 12 oz of noodles, but will probably use 6 or 8 next time.  I added the cornstarch (instead of flour) with the uncooked noodles and stirred in.  I never added the sour cream.  We each put a dollop on our serving at the table.  That way, there is no sour cream in any leftovers.

Wayyyy too much pepper and the noodles didn’t get fully cooked. Will make it again after cutting the pepper amount in half and simmering a bit longer for tender noodles.

Other than that, the flavor was really good!

Will make again, but will use the full 32 oz. of broth. At 3 cups we had some dry noodles. Will also change to beef broth from chicken. A bit strange to have a chicken aftertaste in a beef dish. Eliminated the mushrooms all together as we don’t eat fungus in this house. Otherwise, easy prep and good recipe instructions.

I made this tonight, just as written.  My daughter's first word after tasting was mmmm!  It was the first time I made it and will NOT be the last.  

Some of the best I ever eaten.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Made in the Power Pressure Cooker.

I added my changes as a note (marked with pencil) at the bottom of the original recipe.  Most important change - find very good quality meat; stew meat will often be cardboard (round) or stringy (chuck).  I used a Prime round roast.  Use more garlic, mushrooms, and onion than originally called for.  And worcestershire not soy. 

ok, so now quite a bit later I'm making this for the second time, and can't find my original printout with my original notes.  BUT I KNOW I had used prime beef, cut into thin strips and those into thin sticks (bigger than julienne - about the size of the thick end of a chopstick).  The second time I used what I had on hand - "chuck 'tender'" which is a way they slice up part of the chuck to look like small tenderloin steaks, but although it is certainly better than "stew meat" it is definitely neither tenderloin nor tender.   I used about a pint of homemade chicken stock and about a tsp  reduced salt Beef "Better than Bouillon"  stock base in a cup and a half of water, about 4-5 hefty splashes of worcestershire (no soy for heavens sake!), used more garlic, 1/2 of a LARGE onion, thinly sliced, sliced my mushrooms (about 10-12 oz, (not chopped - heavens, I don't want them to melt down and disappear!), and we will soon find out!  ok, second time around I'll give it the full five stars again - WITH my changes as outlined just above   The chuck tender I used was ok (hubs liked it; I preferred the prime grade round from the first try).   I hadn't read all t

Used moose meat, omitted onion & broth & went with onion soup mix. Substituted all salt & pepper with 2tsp total of The Keg steak seasoning. Used fewer noodles, 340g, with a cup more liquid as called for in the soup mix. As others note, Worcestershire vs soy and added flour just before the sour cream. Very tasty, easy, 1 pot meal.

I followed some of the other advice of reviewers and substituted beef broth for chicken and Worcestershire sauce for soy. The noodles were still crunchy on the top (even though I stirred them all in) but once I mixed it all up together it seemed fine. I also added some peas that I cooked separately. Pretty good overall.

I’ve made this a few times now and I’ve finally perfected it.  Here’s what I did:
Use beef broth not chicken, and Worcester instead of Soy sauce.

Using these spices - add meat to a freezer bag and marinate for 30 minutes.

1/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon onion powder
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon paprika

Then follow this recipe.
Cook noodles 10 minutes, not 5.

Wonderful! I needed something that was quick and easy, as well as delicious, this fit the bill! I added just a little bit of cream cheese, because it's how my Dad used to make it (he used to slow cook the beef in broth before we went to church and then add the rest when we got home for an early dinner). Yummy!

I have made this recipe twice: once exactly as the directions advised and once subbing beef broth for chicken broth and subbing Worcestershire for soy sauce. Both are good but the second way with the substitutions takes this recipe from good to awesome! I will always use beef broth and Worcestershire from now on when making this recipe. If you’re reading this and your debating whether to sub or not, def do it.

I accidentally put the noodles in before the first cooking time but it turned out fantastic anyway. Cooked 10 minutes with natural release. I used beef broth and Worcestershire sauce and a tiny bit extra sour cream and a little bit of cream cheese. Wow so good

This is for the recipe alone, not the cooking method. I was using a rather nicer cut of beef (it needed to be used) and was worried that it would not hold up to the instant pot. The flavors were good but not exceptional. I did use half Worcestershire sauce and half soy sauce, and next time will follow the recipe since the Worcestershire sauce seemed a bit unpleasant to me. I would increase the amount of mushrooms, and I felt it needed some different herb but wasn’t sure what.  I didn’t use nearly as much salt, and it was plenty.  I have been looking for a stroganoff recipe that didn’t need a splash of wine; this isn’t quite it, but it’s pretty good.

First attempt at doing noodles in the instant pot. I substituted hamburger meat and kluski noodles because that was what I had. came out very well, but could use a little more flavor. Next time I will probably add a little cayenne.

I do not cook well but this is an awesome, simple dinner. I used half the meat to save a little money and realizing my instapot is a small one. Everything else fit well and it didn't seem meat sparse at all.

We halved the recipe which turns out to be a bad decision because the noodles were undercooked due to low liquid and the meat was slightly overcooked.  The flavor turned out really yummy and we will likely make this again.  Just not halved. ;-)

This was a simple and easy preparation.  I used an 8 quart pressure cooker and modified the recipe and the family ate every bite! I will definitely make this recipe again.

So delicious! I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using Worcestershire instead for soy sauce and I cooked it 30 minutes. All of the family loved it!

I made this for dinner and followed the suggestion of another reviewer; I added extra garlic (my family loves garlic) and replaced soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce.  I didn't use the whole bag of noodles because it looked it would be too much and I glad I did.  Meat super tender and melted in your mouth.  VERY GOOD dinner and I will definitely make again.

This was also my first time I used my Instant Pot, very easy recipe!

I used chuck roast and trimmed the fat off. Very very tender and delicious. Also, my noodles were a tad too al dente for my liking, so next time I will add a half cup more chicken broth and two more minutes on the cook time for the noodles. Very, very tasty!

This was good but bland. I used 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. And I added more thyme, salt, and pepper than the recipe called for.

This was pretty good. I would definitely make it again. Like others, I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth and Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce for a more authentic stroganoff flavor. Make sure you stir the noodles into the mixture after pressure cooking the beef.

I thought this was easy and very tasty. However,, I did substitute beef broth (why chicken with beef?) and I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. My noodles were too mushy for my liking. When I make again...and I will...I will try maybe extra wide or a different noodle.

Liked it. First thing I cooked in my Insta Pot.  Sauce was a little runnier than I thought it would be but it was very flavorful and the beef was melt in your mouth.

I made this for my family and they gave it a rating of 4-4.5... I made the recipe as written omitting mushrooms. My family hates them. I also used rice flour for a thickener. It is what I use since I am celiac/gluten free. My package of meat was 2.5lbs so I cooked that in a separate pan instead of in my pot.At the stage where you add the noodles I stirred my noodles and added the rest of the broth and some water. I have learned that pasta needs to be in liquid to come out properly. I added rice flour at this stage and it thickened nicely. I got about 7 servings.

I can't give it 5 stars because I made modifications but overall this was really good. I too used worchesteshire sauce in place of soy and beef broth in place of chicken. i also increased the broth to 4 cups. I reserved 1/4 cup broth and mixed 2 tbsp cornstarch instead of flour and added that at the end just before adding the sour cream. I used baby portabella mushrooms and they held together nicely during the cooking process.

Use beef broth instead of chicken and use a whole quart broth, not the 3 cups listed. 
Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  
16 oz noodles was a lot, even stirred into with a quart of broth, not just the 3 cups listed.  The end result didn't yield a sauce with noodles and beef, but more like a casserole. 
If you are in a big hurry, this probably not for you,  
I would make this again but cook the noodles stove top.

It was tender and delicious.  Based on what I had I omitted the mushrooms and used chuck roast, rotini and elbow macaroni, and Mexican sour cream.  Family loved it.  Will make again with proper ingredients.

I’m sorry but this recipe is super bland. I even added more garlic and used s whole onion plus extra salt and pepper. I found it dry  as well. My meat turned out tender , thankfully. I’m sure this would have been better if tweaked a bit. I hate trying to cook pasta in the recipe, but this turned out well after I added more cooking time. So all in all I will make again with a few alterations.

Definitely enjoyed this. I made the changes suggested by other reviewers; beef broth and Worcestershire. The only downside is I didn't think to keep my noodles very al dente, and they ended up a little mushy -- so definitely a word of warning, keep the noodles just a touch crunchy before putting them in for the additional 5min to balance it. Absolutely will be making this again.

It was pretty good, i would have tweaked it too. I would use different beef I didn't like the stew beef for stroganoff and i would have done the beef broth with Worcestershire sauce.  pretty good tho.

I only give it 4 stars because I did not make it as written. I followed other people’s modifications including using beef stock and Worcestershire sauce. I did not use flour at all. It was delicious and will definitely make this again!

First time we have made this so we followed the recipe.  I did have to add some beef broth as there was not enough liquid for the noodles.

Ridiculously salty. Too strong with thyme. Did not make much sauce. Meat was tender and noodles came out just right.
I wouldn't make it again

The flavor was good but the meat turned out really dry for me.  I too traded soy sauce for worcestershire sauce and chicken broth for beef broth.

I pretty much used this as a base. All I had was hamburger so I used about 2lbs of that.  It would have been better with the stew meat as the recipe calls for.   Even without reading the reviews, I added worcestershire sauce.  Still left the soy at the recipies amount. I also used Beef broth, because chicken makes no logical sense.  I didn't have thyme, so that was omitted.  Instead I used Italian seasoning and oregano. along with of course salt and pepper. My family likes garlic, so we determined we'd prefer more than what was called for here.  I also used a dash more onion.  I also added more flour to thicken it, since I added extra broth (admittedly made it thinner than I wanted, hence flour at the end as a thickener). To be honest, I mostly used the recipe for cook time more than anything.

I didn't add the sour cream. After adding the pasta, I couldn't get my InstantPot to "count down" for the final 5 minutes; however, the pasta cooked among the other hot ingredients; I  had to stir a couple of times in order for all the pasta to cook evenly.

I made this last night and it was very good.  Next time however I won't use stew beef - perhaps a different cut would be more tender.  That was my husband's only complaint .  I'll also cook the egg noodles longer - some were a little chewy.  With those two changes I could easily bump this up to five stars.

The best stroganoff I've ever made!  The recipe is great in the instant pot, making the meat super tender.  I did add a tablespoon of worsteshire to give it a little kick but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Perfect one pot meal!

To keep the little ones (and me) happy, I left out the mushrooms.  Also, I substituted beef stock for the requested chicken stock.  We made it exactly the same, otherwise, and it turned out quite well.  We did have a few noodles that weren't cooked enough, so next time I would increase the flour and beef stock just a tad to make sure the noodles all cook evenly.

I made this with the chicken broth and quickly added 4 teaspoons of Knorr Beef bouillon, with the chicken broth i'd give it a 3 star, with the beef bouillon and teaspoon of deli mustard it changed it to a 5 star.  the mustard gave it a little zing to it. I will make this again.

I've made this recipe twice now. Neither time did it turn out the way I expected it too. Why the 4 stars? Because the basics are there but with a slight change to the ingredients and directions it would be perfect. Here is what I've learned. Substitute the chicken broth for the beef broth. And the most important, when you add the noodles ensure you have enough liquid to cover. The two times I've made it, I didn't have enough broth and the noodles came out a little crunchy. I've got the hang of it now, third time is a charm.

My family loved this Instant pot beef stroganoff! Even my hubby, who is not keen on gravy type meals. 

Instead of thyme, I used Italian spice. It probably has the same result with flavor. I used both beef  broth and chicken stock. 

This is a keeper!

I liked the recipe as it is, thus the 4 star vs 5 star rating. however I, like most reviewers think if you have beef and mushrooms in a recipe you should have beef stock and Worcester sauce.  So I followed the other reviewers and upped the beef stock to a whole box (4 cups) doubled the garlic ,  and since my tastes tend to the spicier side of life I added, a 1/2 teaspoon red & white pepper (each) to the mix as well. I also upped the sour cream to a 8oz container vs just 3/4 cup. For me after these changes now I would give it a 5-star review.  I will be making this again. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I live in Ireland and we could not get egg noodles, so we used bow tie pasta instead.  It was fantastic and we will for sure make it again.    I used my old pressure cooker and next time I will let it cook another minute or two just to make the noodles a little more tender, but it is for sure a 5 star recipe.

I also used beef broth and Worcestershire sauce, it really ramps up the flavour. In reply to Sue who said to stir in the noodles, don’t...leave the noodles sitting on top, the steam cooks the noodles and ensures that they’re not over cooked. It’s the second time I’ve cooked pasta in with the dish, the first time the pasta (fusilli) went in at the beginning and it was slightly softer than I prefer. Noodles will, of course, take less cooking and sitting them on top ensures al dente, which is the way I prefer them. Thank you for the recipe ??

I make a killer beef stroganoff sing either cut up sirloin or rib eye and not cut up so small. I cut mushrooms much larger as they shrink ( add them last 1/2 hr.). Two ingredients that make mine great are about 3-4  bay leaves and at least 4 shakes of the Worcheshire bottle. I use beef stock, not chicken and cook it for a long time. Until meat is tender.
This recipe is a quickie but I want the flavor.

This was super easy and I thought it was great! Followed the recipe per instructions, although I accidently subbed beef broth for chicken broth, and now see that was a recommendation.  Meat was super tender and tasty. Will make this again for sure!

Simply delicious! I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce and beef broth instead of chicken. One of the best Instant Pot recipes I have tried. My picky son gave it a thumbs up with a smile.

My spouse went crazy over this Instant Pot dish; wanted leftovers for the next night!  Will make again. Only changes: I used Worcestershire Sauce rather than Soy and beef stock rather than chicken.

Very tasty, although I will reduce or omit the extra salt next time. 

My modifications: 
Mixed 1 part each soy sauce/Worcestershire 
omitted flour & mushrooms
Used frozen meatballs instead of stew meat
Used "Better Than Bouillon" beef broth
Cooked on manual for 5 minutes, NPR 2, then QR 
Top with parsley for color

I will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was to thicken it more after cooking and before adding the sour cream.  DELICIOUS

We liked the sauce but would have liked it to be thicker and more of it.  Also, the noodles were only half cooked even though I went 2 minutes longer. I have yet to make a Instant Pot meal with pasta that cooked correctly. Add a can of condensed soup and pre cook the noodles this would be very good.

Reviews were very helpful, so I used Worcestershire sauce in place of soy sauce, and beef stock in place of chicken.  Because we started eating Keto, I browned the meat in bacon drippings, and used almond flour for thickening.  I left out the pasta, and made "potatoes" of mashed and drained cauliflower.

Delish! After reading reviews I made a couple tweaks based on taste: used elk venison, beef broth, fresh mushrooms 1/2 soy & 1/2 Worcestershire. I made a double batch to freeze so I reduced cooking time significantly. It’s perfect. Thx

Solid 5. The recipe is easy to make. If you understand how your Instant Pot works then you will find the instructions very clear. Pressure cook the beef on high for between 10 and 15 minute setting on Instant Pot, quick release. Mix your noodles well with the sauce as you want them very wet. Pressure cook the noodles and all at 5 minute setting of Instant Pot and when the timer goes leave it for 5 minutes before you do another quick release. The video was very helpful!
Thank you Lissa!!
I did make a couple of changes but only because I know what my family likes and I was out of some ingredients. Used Organics Beef and Organics Vegetable stock mix-it- yourself jars, added 2-3 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce, I only had 4 tsp Soya sauce, out of sour cream and yoghurt so I added 2 Tbsp cream cheese. I was out of egg noodles so I substituted with 16 oz total of brown rice small seashell pasta and some linguine. And had 2 1/2 lbs meat to use up. This was quite delicious and the meat was perfect, the sauce so yummy. Next time I want to make it with the sour cream and egg noodles.

It turned out great. I used frozen egg noodles, omitted the mushrooms because I’m allergic. I also omitted the onion because my husband doesn’t like them. I used beef broth.

I used the site's serving adjustment to go to 4 servings and not 8.  The result was ok, but it was a bit too dry.  Not sure if the calculator ingredient measures were off of not.

Even when I mixed in the noodles, like reviewers advised, it still wasn't enough liquid so they came out underdone.

This is the second time I’ve made this. First time I added sour cream right away and noodles weren’t done. This time I only added half the noodles and cooked for 8 minutes. Noodles still were not done so I turned the pot to sauté and boiled for a few minutes until noodles were done before adding sour cream. That worked like a charm. I like it with the milder flavor from chicken broth, but that is just a personal preference. I will definitely make it again. I also like the ratio of meat to noodle better with only half the noodles. Next time I will only use 2 cups of broth with 1/2 of the noodles. It was easy enough to spoon out excess liquid before adding sour cream. I was concerned about cutting too much liquid for the first attempt.

Made it to recipe - with round steak & portabella mushrooms - and it came out authentic, tasty, and as an ideal meal for a cold winter evening.  Next time, will use a Worcester/Soy mix and increase the onion and garlic, but this recipe was right in the wheelhouse as written.

Mix shitake mushrooms in for more earthiness, Worcester better than soy for me, and drop most of the salt! Mediterranean seasoning instead of thyme works, but is not as authentic.

This originally...not so good. But like the others, I made the following changes: 
- Subbed beef broth for chicken
- Added about 3 TBS Worstershire in addition to about 1 - 2 TBS soy
- Added more mushrooms 
- Used an entire onion
- Added about 2 oz. cream cheese to make it a little creamier
- Added a bit of paprika for flavor

I found that even with these additions, it was good but lacking flavor. It needed a good bit of salt and pepper and still could have used something else. 

Would make again...just needs more flavor.

Loved this recipe.   Made small changes such as using beef stock rather than chicken, used potato starch instead of flour, and used Worcestershire instead of soy.

Quick and easy recipe. I have not eaten many different beef stroganoffs, so this may actually be a 5 star meal!   Much better than the “boxed” beef stroganoff.  I did use beef stock in place of the chicken stock.  Stuck with the recipe other than that.  My husband LOVED it.  Requested I make it again

This was my first time using my instant pot and I followed the directions except for using beef broth instead of chicken. Found out my family doesn’t like thyme. It was good but not great. I will probably make again with modifications. I was rereading the recipe to make sure I had followed it correctly and I thought no I misunderstood the step that said set if for 10 minutes then cook it for ten minutes. Maybe I was supposed to set a 10 minute delay before it began cooking?   I went slowly bc I am just learning the instant pot but I have high hopes for it

Had to make a lot of changes. Added a considerable amount of liquid so that the noodles would cook at the end. Next time I will cut the amount of meat, mushrooms and noodles in half.

This recipe makes a lot. For two people, I'd cut it in half.

I'm not a very good cook. I'm also new to instant pot cooking. That said, I managed to mess up on the noodle part. I set them on top instead of stirring them in. Then after arguing with my husband I stirred some in. I guess common sense was to stir them.  With the instant pot I was entirely sure. I need stupid proof directions. There were a few  not quite cooked pieces of pasta but it was fine. I used gluten free bow tie pasta instead of the egg noodle because I couldn't find gluten free ones. It was really good. I will make it again, stirring in the pasta this time.

This turned out really well. Just like other reviews I used beef broth instead of chicken and Worcestershire instead of soy sauce. I could have added more pepper probably, and maybe some paprika but it turned out really well! Tons of leftovers for my girlfriend and I!

This was pretty good. I used sirloin steak and beef brother, instead of stew meat and chicken broth. 5 mins on noodles works just fine.

I will make this again.  I subbed beef broth for chicken broth and omitted the salt--as written it would have been WAY too salty.  Added 4oz light cream cheese at the end only because I needed to use it up.  Best homemade beef stroganoff I've had.

It was very good recipe for Beef Stroganoff.  The only change I would make is that there is too much salt for the recipe.  The salt from the soy sauce is more than enough.

This is such a great recipe as it is, but I changed a few things to make it better for our taste:  I cut the thyme in half and use beef broth in the place of chicken broth and add some dried parsley for color.  I think the soy sauce is what makes it.

It's amazing how tender the meat gets. My family enjoyed the low fat version I made. I would recommend trying this for a true, one-pot-meal.

Loved it. Meat was super tender and added 1 oz package sliced mushrooms and 1 cup frozen peas when cooking the noodles.  Omitted the salt, added garlic and onion powder when Browning the meat. My 2 and 4 yr old sons loved it. A bit time consuming, as you cook and then add ingredients, but worth it. Replacing this with my old beef stroganoff recipe.  Delicious!

I don't see how this is an improvement over the stovetop method. I much prefer seared, sliced sirloin to the stew meat (which is expensive btw). The IP doesn't seem to get hot enough to really sear the meat so it doesn't have the texture and taste of seared meat. Also, the noodles didn't fully cook at the end and I had to cook it all for another 5 minutes, which caused the meat to stick to the bottom and almost burn. The end result was an unappetizing glop that didn't even taste like stroganoff.

The sauce was very thin. The sour cream being stirred in at the very end left it looking curdled. The flavor was ok but not amazing, could have been made better maybe with more flour, some Worcestershire sauce and beef broth perhaps.

The beef turned out wonderfully tender. This was my first  time using the Instant Pot and it was a big success. Like other reviewers, I used beef broth, not chicken, and Worcestershire sauce, not soy. I still found something a little off with the sauce. Growing up, our beef stroganoff always had cream of mushroom soup in it, and I might try that next time. I also wish the writer had used terms specific to the instant pot, like "turn the valve to the venting position", rather than "do quick release according the manufacturer's directions." Since the recipe says it's for the instant pot, why write generically? It would have saved me a lot of time,  learning my instant pot on this recipe, if I hadn't had to also read the users manual to make it.

This was outstanding! Of course I made a few adjustments. I used stir fry meat instead of stew meat (same meat, different cut) beef bone broth (made more sense),Worcestershire  sauce instead of soy sauce and 8 ozs of cream cheese and a cup of sour cream because it made it oh so good!  12oz of noodles instead of 16, that would have been way too many!  This will be my go to recipe from now on!

Yum!   I did use beef broth (not chicken) and Worcestershire Sauce (not soy).  I had to half this recipe for our 3qt Instant Pot, with the exception of the beef broth....more is better!  And make sure you stir in the noodles...don't just pour them in and leave them on top...they will not cook properly.  It would be nice if for folks that are posting Instant Pot recipes would list what size Pot they made recipe for....that'd be super helpful!

Turned out great. I made a few tweaks as others did. Only thing else I would have maybe added was wine. My husband liked it and said he would have it again and again. I used less noodles and less sour cream and coated the beef cubes in the flour sautéing them using olive oil instead. It was  creamy and delicious on a cold 8 degree evening.

Great one pot recipe! I used low sodium soy sauce and no added salt chicken broth( the whole  box 4 cups) and I only used 1 of the 1/2 teaspoons of salt. I used non fat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and I did stir in the noodles. It was a 16 oz bag also.  The beef was so tender. I did use 2.3 lbs of beef and I wouldn’t use less an this.

This was simply amazing! I took the suggestions of others & substituted beef broth instead of chicken, & worcestershire instead of soy sauce, & I had to restrain myself after 2 servings because I wanted some leftovers! I used spatzel noodles in place of the egg noodles & they soaked up most of the gravy, so next time I'll probably add more broth.

This was creamy and delicious! So far this is my favorite Instant Pot creation. I used Worcestershire instead of soy sauce (thanks other reviewers) and I used a full cup of sour cream. The more I use my new Instant Pot the easier and less intimidating it all becomes. This was easy, pretty fast, and really good!

This turned out great. I did make a few adjustments like others, I used beef broth instead of chicken broth. I also used amish style wide noodles. I did not add flour but added a cornstarch slurry at the very end and let it sit a couple.of minutes.

Instant pot made it so easy and tasty!  We like garlic so we put garlic powder in at the finish and stirred it up just before serving with a loaf of Italian bread seasoned with garlic and herbs

WAY Too many noodles for my taste.  After the noodles are done cooking there is NO liquid left.  I thought the flavor was good but I subbed beef broth for chicken and we used 4 cups and still had to add more liquid to get the noodles done.  If I make it again, I would probably cut the noodle amount by 1/4-1/2 to hopefully get it a little saucier. I think it's a good starting point, though.  I did sub Worcestershire sauce for soy but I think I may try soy next time instead just to see what the taste difference would be.

It was missing something....I went easy on the salt, but the end result was kind of Meh....and I even added more sour cream...both my husband and I thought it was lacking flavor...it was easy, and the meat was super tender....I added some time as others recommended and subbed beef stock and Worcestershire...but still...it needed something more...

Instead of egg noodles, I made it with spaetzle I'd stumbled across at Ocean State Job Lot and it came out fantastic. 10 minute beef cook followed by a 10 minute spaetzle cook and it was perfection.

I had to add another 20 minutes of cooking time because the meat was tough. I added 2 teaspoons of garlic salt,  a teaspoon of granulated onion, and a tablespoon of basil because it was bland.
I also added another 3 tablespoons of flour to thicken it up.
It ended up being delicious.

This was without a doubt the easiest and most delicious beef stroganoff I have ever made. We followed the recipe to a tee. It’s delicious! My husband added Valentina to his. It’s a delicious addition. The Valentina blends easily into the dish, evenly distributing the heat and flavor.

Great flavor, but next time I will brown the meat in small batches. I ended up with too much liquid and they didn’t get browned really. I’ll also swap beef for chicken broth next time

I cut the amount of liquid and it was still too watery.  Also, it had a really "sharp" taste.  Really Disappointed!

YUM!  Big hit with my hubby!  So tasty!  You can make this gluten free with a few adjustments.  I also used coconut aminos for the soy.  Even dairy free if you want but the sour cream is sooooo good.  The beef was perfectly tender and the noodles perfectly cooked.  We used gluten free noodles and added a few minutes on the time to adjust.
