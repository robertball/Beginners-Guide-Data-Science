Easy and very flavorful! I was surprised how easy it was to separate the skin from the chicken without tearing it.  I'm a novice cook, so if that part is giving you pause, don't!  go for it!  Putting the mixture under the skin lets it really permeate the meat while it's cooking.  So good!

Use a 7lb hen and adjusted the seasonings. It made my whole house smell so delicious. Roasted the potatoes on 350 for a little longer since I had a larger chicken. I also separated the potatoes for my non bacon eating child, so 1/2 had bacon and onions and the other 1/2 were just out of the pan. both were great.

You must have an acquired taste to eat this. If you make this recipe way less cream cheese and make sure you really like rosemary. Do NOT use the Italian dressing w/ the rosemary.... It was simple to make so thats why it gets one star

One of my family's go to dishes! I have always roasted the chicken in the oven and recently tried it in the crock pot instead. Was much more juicy that way and the skin browned nicely.
