Quick, simple, and can be changed to suit personal taste or to include something you want to feed the kids! I used one can of garbanzo beans instead of kidney beans, one can of diced tomatoes, and approximately 1 tsp of Tex-Mex chili seasoning. Next time, I might try using salsa, corn and black beans, and maybe some grated cheddar. Yum!
