Easy to make and tasted wonderful.  It wasn't so sweet that you couldn't eat and enjoy!  I will surely make this again.

These were delicious.  I did not alter the recipe at all and they turned out great.  I made this for a church "tea" function and cut in small pieces, it served a lot.  I'll be making this one again.

This recipe is reallygood but the crust tastes dry and rubbery. I made it again with a oreo/butter crust and it was really good! Definitely a keeper.

I used Chocolate chips instead. Dont eat fresh from the oven, let them cool in the fridge to perfection. Also, when baking these kinds of dishes it is always best to set the pan of bars into a separte pan of water. That way the edges dont get burnt and you can enjoy the whole dish. You can see the edges here are a cooked same as the middle. Its a brilliant trick, one you wont live without later on

Followed recipe to a "t".  Crust was way too thick, almost like a dry brownie and overpowered the "cheesecake" part of the bars (could barely taste it) Not at all what I expected. Will not make again.
