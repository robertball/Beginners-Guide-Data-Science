Thanks to my niece, Liz, this recipe has been enjoyed by many.  The original recipe is called Cheddar Fish Florentine.  It calls for 1 C shredded sharp cheddar, 2 Tbls dry bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp dried and crushed tarragon leaves, 1 10oz pkg chopped spinach thawed and well drained, 1/2 lb fish fillets.  Combine cheese, crumbs and tarragon, reserve 1/4 C for topping.  Mix with spinach.  Spread this into baking dish, top with fish, sprinkle on remaining cheese mixture.  Bake 450 15 to 20 minutes.  Two servings.  I love all the variations.  I myself added an egg to make the spinach more like a souffle.

Of course, I rate it 5 stars!

Enjoy!

I will admit that I made some drastic changes in this recipe but I had to use what I had on hand!  I did not have any cheddar cheese so I used real parmesan (not the green can kind).  I did not have frozen spinach so I used a bag of fresh that I sautéed with a small chopped onion and 2 chopped garlic cloves.  I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain.  Even with these changes, this fish was yummy and a big hit with the family.  I may try it the “real” way one day but I liked this way just fine!

I make this recipe about once a week and we love it here! However, I have made several key changes so that's why I'm rating this 4 stars -- Firstly, I set the oven at 400 degrees. Since I use frozen cod, I end up cooking these much longer as well. I place each cod into small au gratin dishes (sprayed with Pam) for individual servings; squeeze fresh lemon juice, sea salt & freshly ground pepper over each; top each with mixture of fresh baby spinach (cut up), 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1 beaten egg, and crushed saltine crackers instead of  dry breadcrumbs; cover each dish with foil.  I found that roasted new potatoes go very well with this fish ~AND~ the best part is they can roast in a seperate pan right along with the fish! For that, I toss the potatoes in a pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil; little salt & pepper and throw the pan in the oven next to the fish. They're ready when nicely browned. Serve it up with steamed baby carrots--how healthy is that?!

We absolutely loved this, though I did make a couple minor changes.  I don't care for frozen spinach so I used fresh which I steam-fried with chopped garlic and onion just until wilted.  I removed the excess moisture and proceeded with the recipe.  I substituted hard Parmesan reggiano cheese for the cheddar, which I grated.  It has less fat than the cheddar, is less greasy, and we love the flavor.  I topped the fish with a mix of Italian bread crumbs and finely grated Parmesan, which I then sprayed with a bit of butter flavored cooking spray so it would brown and crisp nicely.  It came out fabulous and my husband absolutely loved it.  I've made it several times now and it will definitely stay in my recipe rotation.  Thank you so much for such a delicious and healthy recipe.

What a delicious recipe which begs to be tweaked.  We added 2 minced cloves of garlic, grated parmesan, basil, and a bit of dried mint to the bread crumb/spinach mix.  We then grated some 5 year old cheddar over the mix in the baking dish, added the cod and repeated the process.  This one is a keeper.

This recipe tasted great, especially with a few additions. I put the fish in lemon juice for half an hour to add that lemon-fish taste. With the spinach mix I added mushrooms and onions. With the cheese I doubled that amount. I will make this again real soon.

The temperature and cook time is way low for this recipe - I gave it 30 mins at 350 degrees, and it was certainly not overcooked. That said, this is a really great combination of flavors, and is quite unique. I didn't add anything to the recipe and made just as stated - it was just fine, what some might consider "bland" but I thought it enhanced the cod and cheddar flavors nicely. The spinach mix was quite good, but if you're trying to disguise the flavor for spinach-haters, more customization would be needed (extra cheese, extra egg, etc.). All in all this was a really nice and quick fish dinner - thanks for sharing :)

I was very impressed with this dish. 

I did have to make a few adjustments, I didn't have frozen spinach on hand, but I did have fresh. As well I didn't have bread crumbs, but I did have some multigrain bread that I tore apart. I also added a few splashes of lemon juice to the fish.

I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, but both me and my boyfriend loved it. I'll be making this again with some of the suggested variations for sure.

Thanks

Great recipe!  I used Orange Roughy, fresh baby spinach, chopped onions, mushrooms and panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs.  I mixed all of the cheese into the spinach mixture, and reserved about 1/4 of the mixture to spread on top.  Sprinkle with a little cheese and serve!  Delicious!

I'm always game for cooking "Haddock" new ways.  This was a very healthy, yummy recipe.  Added a few extra's for additional taste such as onions and garlic in the spinach mixture.  I did bake the fish at 350 for 30 mins. which didn't dry the fish out.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

I thought this was a great recipe, but followed some of the other suggestions to tweak it.  Ireplaced the bread crumbs with crackers (I had crackers), added mushrooms, some chopped onion, some chopped garlic, a little salt, and some cider vinegar to the spinach mixture.  I also put the whole cup of cheese and all of the cracker crumbs in the spinach mixture and reserved some of that for the top of the fish.  Then I sprinkled more cheese on top.  Next time I think I'll sprinkle Old Bay on the fish.  I'll defenitely make again.

This is it! I have been searching recipes online for a while but never bothered to sign up until I tried this particular recipe. I had to say THANK YOU! My son isn't pleased about eating fish or spinach, and complained until his first bite, and then I didn't hear a peep until his plate was clean. :) I added an extra egg and used chopped up American cheese slices instead of cheddar. I used Italian breadcrumbs and sprinkled a bit of lemon juice on the fish before I seasoned it. I covered the fish with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese before I baked it for 35 min at 375. I had everything I needed. This is my kind of recipe. My husband called the leftovers!

This is a different and tasty way to fix fish and is fairly quick.  I followed the recommendations of some of the other reviewers and then made a few adjustments of my own. I used talapia.  I used Ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  I used a 16 oz. pkg of spinach and combined it with all of the cheese, cracker crumbs, 1 small can of mushrooms, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, and 1 1/2 tsp. salt.  I also added several generous glubs of hot sauce (not Tabasco).  I put this in a 9x9 pan.  I put 4 thawed talapia fillets on top, and sprinkled them with lime juice and Cavendar's greek seasoning.  Then I sprinkled them with a little more cracker crumbs and cheese.  I baked it uncovered for 20 minutes in a preheated 400 oven.  They turned out great.  The topping was a little crispy but the fish and spinach were moist.  I served them with Great Northern beans from a can and it was a great combination.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe with a few changes. I added garlic & onion powder and chopped mushrooms & onions. I also used pepper jack cheese, fresh spinach, and 2 eggs (to compensate for the lack of moisture in the fresh spinach). It's a crowd pleaser that's easy to make.

Really good!! The spinach portion is like a stuffing, but more healthy.  I pesonally would not use cod again cause I don't care for it.  Would be great with flounder or tilapia.  Also, I don't even think you need the breadcrumbs on top--just trying to think of ways to reduce calories/carbs!  I used fresh grated parm cheese in the stuffing along with chopped garlic and a bunch of spices and used Cheddar on the top of the fish.  Cooked at 350 for about a half hour and it was perfect!

My husband and son really enjoyed this recipe.  I'm not a big fan of fish, but I thought it was okay and will definitely make it again.  I seasoned the spinach with basil, garlic salt, garlic powder, sea salt, pepper & onion.  I also added heavy cream, which went a long way in helping the spinach mixture not to be too dry.  I put a little lemon pepper, Mrs. Dash salt and black pepper on the fish and baked it at 350 for 35 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a great addition to our dinner menu, not to mention something a little different.

I cooked this recipe as a skeptic. Of course my kids 5 & 7 don't eat fish so I was searching.  I altered the recipe after reading the reviews w/ onions, garlic powder, onion powder and salt. Beyond my expectations...  My 7 yr old (the worst of the eaters) said Mom... this chicken is an A!  I let him think it was chicken!  I'm so happy!  I want to try and make the sauce saucier next time...  Maybe some milk or cheddar cheese soup..  not a lot, but would make for more sauce!  This one's a winner!  My husband even liked it!  A Wow!

I was surprised, but this really WAS very good.  I'm not a spinach eater and I had to have seconds.  I followed the recipe plus added chopped garlic and onion powder to the spinach mixture.  I also put it under the broiler to brown when it was done.  Definitely a keeper... thanks so much!

Lackluster as written with an improper cooking time and temperature to boot.  Embellishing on this quite a bit - mushrooms, shallots, garlic, white wine and cream, seasoning the fish, and increasing the oven temperature and baking time did help a great deal, but it still wasn’t something I’ll make again.  Needs too many improvements – not solid as is.  Moreover, this probably was the most unattractive dish I’ve ever made (hence, no photo).

I LOVED this! As usual i read the majority of the comments before i try something new. And i agree with altering a bit. I sprayed my dish with butter flavored Pam, in a skillet i sauteed half of a large onion and 3 heaping tablespoons of garlic, as we love garlic, and a couple pinches of kosher salt with a little water and Pam olive oil and butter spray. I lightly squeezed the thawed spinach, added about 1/2 cup of monteray  jack, cheddar and 1/4 c pepper jack and the rest fresh Parmesan, i pat the cod dry and used old bey fresh ground black pepper, a pinch of oregano basil, kosher salt onion powder and garlic salt on both sides like a dry rub, mixed as directed except i used 1 teaspoon seasoned breadcrumbs in the spinach and 1 for the out side. placed my fish on top and added the remainder of cheese and breadcrumbs with a little fresh chopped parsley, backed at 350 for about 35 mins as my fish was medium thick, removed foil and placed on broil for about 10 minutes the house was smelling flavorful and delish! I love the way the ingredients blended so well together, i'd never tried this kind of dish before and i am so glad i did. i truly value this website and all the comments! It did remind me of stuffing and for those who hate spinach  it doesn't taste like spinach! I think think chicken breasts or breakfast chops would do well with this dish or cubed ham chunks or shrimp ontop with the fish! Thank you Aunt Carol this dish was filling, and 10 stars in my book!

This was excellent. I used grated parmesan cheese and, as previous reviewers have noted, baked it for 30 minutes, not 20. I would leave a little water in the spinach as it did come out just slightly dry although the fish was very moist. Excellent!!

Loved it!  I used fresh spinach sauteed with onion and garlic, and it was extremely flavorful.  It did take a lot longer to cook than the recipe indicated and I finally bumped the heat up to 425 as another review suggested.  Next time I will try cooking it for 20 minutes at 425.

I used Haddock and it was fantastic. I did have to cook it a bit longer than specified in the recipe. Excellent dish!

I used this with some cod fillets, using pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  Also used bread crumbs only in the spinach, not sprinkled over.  The pepper jack melted beautifully, coating the fish lightly so that the end product looked much prettier than the photo here, so I'd recommend that change.  It came out great.  My 14-yo son said it was the best fish he'd ever had.  My husband, not a huge fish eater, also called it a keeper.  Went together fast, too, once the spinach was thawed.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  You have to do as the recipe says..but do flavor the fish and spinach to your liking.  I used galic and onion powder, salt and pepper, and italian seasoning on the fish and an italian breading on both sides of the fish.  I used croutons with the cheese and spinach mixture along with roasted garlic and bake with fish under it.  -It's great if you season!

We loved this, well the adults did..kids?  Not so much.  I did use fresh spinach which I cooked with garlic, olive oil, fresh mushroom and a few cherry tomatoes.  I seasoned the fish to our liking and sprinkled some grated parmesan on top of the bread crumbs.  Served with fresh lemons for the fish and a wild mushroom rice pilaf on the side.  Delish!

Except for salmon, halibut & most shellfish, I'm not a big fish fan.  Husband is a HUGE fish fan, so I thought I'd try this.  I was sure I wasn't going to like it because the fish was so...fishy...but I LOVED it!  I used panko for the breadcrumbs and added a fair helping of fresh grated nutmeg to the spinach mixture.  I sprinkled the cod with garlic salt and pepper, then topped it up with the remaining panko and cheddar.  I don't understand how anyone could bake it at 325* for 20 minutes and consider it done.  I baked mine at 400* covered for 10 minutes, then an additional 10 minutes, uncovered (to brown the cheese & crumbs), and husband's was still a little on the translucent side (he had a very thick piece).  Mine was done, and it was delicious.  I think maybe 400* for 25-30 minutes would work, and I'd try other types of whitefish, but other than that, I'm very satisfied with how it came out with my few changes.  Husband even liked the spinach, and he's not a spinach eater at all!

I could not rate this any less!  I was impressed with the result.  I've never done fish with spinach and cheese, and am excited with the new combination.  I used bran instead of bread crumbs, and chopped fresh baby spinach instead of frozen.  Skipped the pepper. Wonderful as is...not sure if I would even add onion or garlic because it has such an exquisite flavour already.  My 1 year old son, who is teething and not eating much, ate his share (mixed with rice), and then kept asking for more.

This recipe truly is the best.  I make sure to use fresh spinach and cook it in a little butter in the fry pan.  A great way to get a little iron in my diet and a fantastic way to introduce fish to those who think they don't like it!

My rating might not be that accurate because I veered quite a bit from the original recipe.  Based on some of the others' suggestions, I marinated the fish in lemon juice for an hour or so before baking.  Also, in the spinach mixture, I doubled the cheese & egg, added 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 lb fresh chopped mushrooms, 1 medium onion sliced and one clove garlic minced.  Also I had to bake the mix at a higher temp and for about 10 min longer.  But it still came out great, I served it over rice.  Thanks for the great "base" recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful recipe! As others suggested, I did add a little extra seasoning to the spinach mixture--onion and garlic salt mainly. And you can pretty much use whatever seasonings you usually enjoy on your fish. Because I was using a thick halibut steak, I marinated it first in 1 T. melted butter, 1 T. olive oil, 1 freshly minced garlic clove and garlic & onion salts sprinkled over it. Depending on the thickness of the fish you use, you will have to cook it longer--but it's easy to keep an eye on if you check for flaking every 5 or 10 minutes beyond regular bake time. The basic recipe is so wonderful for tweaking to personal taste though (extra spinach, extra cheese, etc)! I'll definitely make it again!

This was so good!  I tweaked it a bit and used swiss chard instead of of spinach.  I sauteed it with garlic and used edam cheese and  pearl fish.  I also seasoned the fish with some other spices and baked at 350 for 30 min.  The kids didn't care for it, but I'll make it again for myself and my husband!

Delicious! I used Orange Roughy, and added garlic and basil as suggested by others. Family loved it - comment from 16 yr old daughter was "I hate spinach and I hate fish - but I love this!" No leftovers!

This was Great! I cut back to about 3/4 the amount of spinach and cheese. My husband and children can't stand spinach and they rave about this recipe.  It is a wonderful way to get them to eat it.

This recipe was pretty good.  I think I may have squeezed the spinach too much as the spinach was a bit dry, but the fish was moist.  I'll try it again, leaving the spinach a little wetter.  Nice change of taste!

I used Swai filets and followed the recipe as directed.  I did bake at 350 for 30 minutes, however I found the spinach mixture to be flavorless.  I will definitely spice it up with sautéed onions and maybe some Parmesan cheese.  Will try it again with some alterations.

This was pretty good but in my opinion some salt in the spinach mixture would have helped a lot.  Next time I will also add a bit of oil or melted butter to the topping because the cheese and the crumbs on their own do not blend well.  I will make it again with these changes.

I made this one as described and my dish came out uncooked. So I came back and read some reviews that also said their fish came out cold, and did what they suggested - I increased the temperature to 400 degrees and cooked it longer. Mine ended up taking an hour! Very disappointed.

I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and tilapia in stead of cod, which I sliced.  It definitely took way longer than 20 minutes to cook and was lacking in flavor.  I will make this again but with some added seasoning.  Also, although it tasted alright, it didn't look great.

This is a great base for getting creative with Cod or white fish.  Firstly, I lightly buttered my pan.  I wilted fresh spinach with chopped garlic, drained. (One bag isnt nearly enough if using fresh). I used a 2:1 mix of cheddar and parmesan. Prepped fish with some lemon, salt and pepper.  To earlier comment, I think tarragon is too sweet and strong for this.  I also used panko rather than bread crumb.  Works either way savory with a dash of white wine and fish friendly herbs or creamed up with a dash of nutmeg.

Loved Aunt Carols review version - "Cheddar Fish Florentine. It calls for 1 C shredded sharp cheddar, 2 Tbls dry bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp dried and crushed tarragon leaves, 1 10oz pkg chopped spinach thawed and well drained, 1/2 lb fish fillets. Combine cheese, crumbs and tarragon, reserve 1/4 C for topping. Mix with spinach. Spread this into baking dish, top with fish, sprinkle on remaining cheese mixture. Bake 450 15 to 20 minutes. Two servings. I love all the variations. I myself added an egg to make the spinach more like a souffle. Of course, I rate it 5 stars! Enjoy! "

Yum! I subbed parm for the cheddar and added in more seasonings and buttered Panko crumbs to give it more crunch. This was so tasty and thank you!

I made this for me and my fried fish loving husband and he thought this was great. I did make a few changes, I used italian breadcrumbs, walleye filets, fresh baby spinich sauted with garlic instead of frozen. I also served it in individual dishes.
Great to serve to company.

No offense, but I was very surprised how good this was with no herbs, etc to change it up a little. I made recipe to the T. Next time (and there will be) I made add a few things using fresh herbs from the garden or whatever, but would be just fine as is.

Quick, easy and yummy.  I added lemon zest and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the breadcrum and cheese mixture that tops the fish.

This was great!  I added some sauteed onion and mushrooms to the spinach mixture and it added that little bit extra to push it over the top for me.  Thanks for a great dinner!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I added a clove of fresh garlic and substituted feta for the cheese in the misture.  Great!  I'm making it again tonight and I think I'll take the advise and add some chopped fresh mushrooms as well.  YUMMY!

We loved this!!!!  I would recommend thawing fish if you are using frozen prior to cooking.  I did that and the temperature and cooking times were just fine.  This is a keeper and will be served frequently in our home.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Excellent! My husband loved every bite of this. He said that he would love to eat this once a week. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of dry bread crumbs. I also added garlic to spinach. This was delicious!

I tried this last night and it was too dry. I would try it again, though, using a cup of chicken broth in the spinach mix, then dot the fish with about 4 tablespoons of butter. It also took a lot longer to bake. I used very small fillets of red snapper.

I thought I had really messed this up. I forgot to save some of the spinach for the topping & ended up just sprinkling italian bread crumbs and cheddar on top. THEN it was taking a while to cook (I was using a thick cod)so after 40 minutes I removed the foil and broiled it on low for 4 minutes...I thought I messed it up but good! I was SO happy that it was actually delicious! I wanted to eat it all myself! Will make again & again! Thanx!

This was a nice change for a fish dish.  I made a few changes to make it Atkins friendly.  I omitted the bread crumbs.  Squeezed out a little of the liquid of the spinash and then added 1/4 c. cream, 1/4 c. parmesean, 1/4 c. cheedar, garlic powder and egg. After I topped it with the remaining cheedar, I sprinkled salt, pepper and some almonds on top.

This is a great dish to make, quick and easy.  The spinach was a little dry, I would recommend keeping some water in the spinach.  I added some garlic, onion and mushrooms and it gave it an extra kick.  I will make this recipe again.

This recipe is quick and enjoyable.  Low in fat as well if you use mozzarella part skim shredded cheese instead of cheddar.  I did not drain the water off the spinach.  It still tasted great.

I was planning on having cod poached in a light lemon tarragon sauce with cooked spinach and mashed potatoes with broiled basil pesto tomatoes,when I saw this recipe by chance and thought that I would give it a try instead.I found that the calorie trade off wasn't worth it,and that the dish lacked in overall flavour.Sorry to say that I will not be trying this recipe again.

A definite five with a couple changes. First (I typically make two generous servings, so I adjust amounts accordingly): I use 3 oz. fresh baby spinach leaves, wilted with 1/2 TB butter and a few tsp minced garlic, in place of the frozen spinach (I think other reviewers have also suggested this). I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain.  Finally, for the cheese, I use 1/2 cup reduced fat shredded cheddar, and 1/4 cup grated Parmesan. Overall, this definitely takes the dish in a more garlic-flavored direction, and yield a flavorful cod dish that even my husband (not usually a fan of any fish except salmon or tuna) loves! And it really doesn't add much to prep time.

I've made this several times this past year and its always delicious and a welcome dinner night as our house.  I've always use fresh spinach (instead of the frozen)..just saute it until cooked as much as you like it in a little olive oil before assembling it with egg, etc.  We use Tilapia with it...super easy and yummy!

Combining spinach and fish can cause the release of nitrosamines that have been shown to be highly carcinogenic in animals. As a precaution you should not combine fish and spinach.

Very good, my kids even ate it.  I however changed the recipe, I just keeped the same concept of spinach and cod. But I made Amana style spinach(garlic, onions, butter, beef stock, thicken with roux,& spinach) and put cheese in it. Topped cod with lemon, salt, and pepper and cheese. Bake at 400 and baked for 30 min. It was excellent!

I guess I should have had Aunt Carol make this first, it didn't work for us at all. I added lemon juice, Old Bay and some lemon pepper to the fish and it baked very nicely, but the spinach layer didn't have any flavor even after I added garlic, minced onion, salt and pepper.

Great recipe with a few modifications. I added Feta cheese to the spinach mixture as well as the breadcrumbs mixture. I also added Garlic powder to the spinach mixture to add taste. For the breadcrumbs, I buttered Whole Wheat bread and added garlic powder, toasted them in the oven until well toasted and crumbled them up.

This was good. Mine turned out a bit dry because the cooking time listed did not work for me so, I had to keep guessing. I used Tilapia and more cheese than was called for.

This is a delicious, easy recipe and one I will use many times. I do my fish in my George Foreman roaster (there is a shallow tray for fish, ham, etc)and 30 minutes was perfect timing. I, too, suggest leaving a little water in the spinach but, otherwise, use the recipe as is.

I had high hopes for this one but we weren't thrilled by it.  Not bad, just a bit bland for our tastes.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and hot sauce to the spinach mixture and used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  Possibly it would have been better to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs?  It was fine for one night's dinner but I don't think we'll be making again.

I will address the time and temp. I baked at 350 for 30-35 minutes. I took a reviewers advice and just put the cheese on top(on my piece I didn't add the cheese to save the fat and calories)spinach mix on bottom was delicious, we enjoyed the meal

An interesting and different way to cook white fish.  I used tilapia and, like everyone else, added a few things.  I put a tsp of apple cider vinegar in the spinach mixture since I felt it need more moisture.  Also, I top the fish w/ Old Bay and roasted garlic pieces.  I also used a mix of sharp and irish cheddar since I ran out of the former.  I will definitely make this again...Easy and tasteful.

18 reviews and not one of them mentioned the cooking time being too short or the oven temperature being too low?  Strange.  I baked at 325 degrees for 20 minutes like the recipe said, and my fish was nowhere near done.  I had to stick it in the microwave to finish the cooking.   I added heavy cream, garlic, and parmesan cheese to the spinach.  All in all, the finished product smelled and tasted good, but the cooking time and/or oven temperature was completely off base.  (And, yes, my oven temperature is correct.)

My family enjoyed this dish.  A nice change for fish.  In addition to the recipe ingredients I added minced garlic, 1/2 and 1/2, Parmesean cheese and kosher salt to the spinach.  I used the Frozen Leaf Spinach instead of the Chopped.  The fish was moist & flaky and the spinach was very tasty.  I served this with garlic bread.

EVEN MY 7 YEAR OLD SON LOVED THIS!! I simply spiced the spinach mixture with a dry garlic bread blend, then spiced the fish with garlic salt & italian seasonings.  We had NO LEFTOVERS!!! Great way to get spinach positively introduced to your family.

Great recipe. I was eating a bucket of fried chicken wings while watching World Cup semi-final yesterday. I just felt that I had to eat something green and healthy today to feel less guilty! And this recipe is not only yummy but also comforting.  Will do it again! Thanks for sharing!

It's been in the oven for 20 minutes at 350 and it hasn't even begun to cook! I absolutely hate recipes that mislead on the cooking time because it screws me up for getting dinner on the table and that ticks me off!

I loved this fish, but it did need some tweaks....mainly in terms of cooking time.  Wish I had read the reviews before I started.  It should have been 350 degrees.....easily.....maybe even 400 as one reviewer suggested.  After 35 frustrating minutes at 325,  I put it under the broiler.  I also added garlic and switched feta cheese for the cheddar.  Perhaps the recipe should be resubmitted with the correct time and temp. :(

I also use fresh spinach with an Italian twist.  I saute fresh garlic with extra virgin olive oil just for a few seconds to bring out the favor. I add a full bag of fresh prewashed baby spinach all at once and pour in about 1/2 cup or so of white wine, the best to cook with is Sauvignon Blanc.   Once the spinach is wilted, I continue with the recipe  and found that 350 degrees is much better.  I make this at least twice a month and have passed it along to friends.

Absolutely the easiest and tastiest fish ever. I admit to a splash of malt vinegar after cooking. But cod and spinach scream for it. I cooked it as written this time. Might add aleppo pepper next go...and there will be a next go!

Great Recipe. I did use fresh spinach (2 bags worth) instead of frozen then wilted it over the stove and added some zucchini from the garden. I had Japanese Panko Breadcrumbs i used, left out the egg (bad cholesterol problems) and used Parmesan cheese. This was so good, I had to do it again the next night LOL.

This was so-so for us we really are not fans of cod but I thought we would try something other than salmon. Cod is a basic white fish with not too much flavor, even though I added spices. The spinach was wonderful and the cheese is what made the dish, In the future I will try a different fish even talapia is better for us than cod.

I didn't exactly stick to the recipe, but I love the concept so much, I'm giving the 5 stars.  Based on what I had on hand, I switched from cheddar to mozzerella and provolone cheeses, and used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain.  Also, I made a butter-crumb topping out of the reserved bread-crumbs.  It was delicious!  I used an 11 x 7  baking dish, but I think I would go for a smaller dish next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Bland. It was not good.  The spinach was dry and the fish was bland.  I may have messed up when I used 2% fat cheese, but regardless of the cheese, it was still not that good.

This is a quick & easy recipe that tastes good.  I used fresh spinach seasoned with garlic & salt.  I also like to remove the foil for the last 5 minutes or so of the baking time to give the top a little color.  I have also made this recipe with thin-sliced chicken breasts, and it came out just fine.

OMG! So easy and so good. Baked in two separate dishes for kids and parents and was amazing. Kids had cod and we had seabass! Mixed fish topping with breadcrumbs mixture of cheese, salt and pepper and poured melted butter on top. Kids ate every bit and asked for more! YEAH! Husband ususally complains about my fish dishes but loved this one! Keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, except for using fresh spinach, and found this terribly bland.  I think if I ever made it again I'd saute an onion and some garlic with the spinach, and add more seasoning.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and it was great!  I did modify it slightly thought.  For the fish I used orange roughy vice cod.  I had 2 lbs of fish but only one frozen package of spinach.  So, I mixed 1 pkg spinach (prepared according the recipe) with 1 cup grated sharp cheddar, 1/3 cup breadcrumbs, grated sea salt and fresh grated black pepper, and 2 beaten eggs.  I lined the bottom of a large baking dish with this.  Then, I placed the fish on top of the bed of spinach.  I sprinkled fresh lime juice on the top of the fish.  In a separate bowl, I mixed another 1 cup cheddar, 1/3 cup of bread crumbs, sea salt and black pepper, and covered the fish with this mixture.  I baked at 325 for 30 minutes.  PERFECT!!!  My kids and husband loved it too.  This is a nice treat for fish dish.  I served with basmati rice and a side salad.  Yum!

I was not impressed with this.  It wasn't gross, but wasn't good either.  I won't be making it again.

This recipe is very much like the one that I came up with when the fish fillets I cooked fell apart and I had to salvage the meal.   Since swiss cheese and spinach are great together I used swiss instead of cheddar and it was delicious.  My family loves this dish.

I really liked this recipe!  Easy to make, and very healthy.  I haven't made it again only because my husband  doesn't like spinach very much. But I thought it was delicious!

Wow, this was really good! I only had a tiny bit of cheese, so I used a can of cheddar cheese soup! I think I will make it with the soup again. Spinach nice and creamy with the soup, not dry at all! Thanks, great, fast & easy!!

This recipe came is awesome.  I made this for our family and even my little grandson just gobbled it up.  I used the Costco tilapia filets from frozen section and thawed before cooking.  SInce I doubled the recipe, it took a bit longer to cook, but I watched it carefully, not wanting to overcook and get dry fish.  The fish was delectable.  I'm trying to think of some way to lighten this recipe so I can add it to my low fat regimen, without ruining it!! Way delicious!  Thanks, Aunt Carol.

The stores didn't have fresh cod (only previously frozen) so I substituted another white fish. It was probably thicker than cod, soI had to cook it longer; I also increased the temp to 350 after finding 325 wasn't satisfactory. The other change I made was to add a little garlic powder to the spinach mixture. I used slightly more cheese also because I like cheese. My family liked this.

This was a great combination of flavours but I think it needed cooking for longer.  Some of the fish was slightly underdone.  I used pollock and it tasted great.  A keeper, thanks!

I like my fish dishes to pack a real flavor wallop, but this one didn't live up to my expectations.  I even added garlic powder and paprika to the spinach mixture and sprinkled it over the fish, but my family still found it boring - "just another white fish meal."  I don't know what this would need to jazz it up more, but I don't think I will be trying it a second time.

Seasoned the spinach mixture, used double seasoned breadcrumb breading on the top of the fish, worsterchire blend brushed on the bottom, and it was still bland. Baked fish and spinach are not our favorite things, but I thought I could make it work.  Good luck to anyone else.

I made it with cod and it was good. I increased the temperature and time as suggested by other reviewers (400 F for about 35 min). I think it would be even better with tilapia or another freshwater fish.

My family was not a fan of this recipe.  Perhaps if I tweek it a bit, we might try again.  The taste was satisfying but the topping was "mushy" and detracted from the overall effect of this dish.

I used fresh spinach, a blend of mozzarella, cheddar and Parmesan cheeses, also added some sauteed onion and garlic and was overjoyed with the result! Already made it twice and another time used thin sliced chicken breast instead of  cod. I will definitely make this again. Very suitable to serve to company.

I added lemon zest and garlic to the spinach, squeezed lemon juice over the fish before adding the topping and increased the oven temp to 400.   I liked that it didn't have cream in the recipe like many others.

Made this for my hubby last night - he and I both enjoyed it greatly, instead of salt n peppering the seasoning mix though, I salt n peppered + some garlic powder to the fish itself, turned out quite delicious and tender. 

Will definitely cook this again :D

Made this and loved every bite.  Used fresh sautéed spinach   moisture squeezed out. Whole wheat breadcrumbs nothing special just Kraft sharp grated cheese and a pinch of Old Bay seasoning and egg.  I did put butter on the bottom of the dish and then the spinach mix down with cod on top.  Sprinkled just pepper on the fish and balance of the cheese. After cooking at 325 for 20 minutes lightly covered,  Removed foil and broiled on low till golden.       I have already sent out an invite to some friends for a simple supper.  THIS IS A WINNER!!!

This turned out great! Modified it like others. Beat 2 eggs till fluffy, added moz cheese instead of cheddar and stove top stuffing instead of breadcrumbs. Used fresh spinach/kale mix and sauté it with butter, onions, and garlic. Make sure to spray the dish before putting the spinach mixture at the bottom. Sprinkled on top of fish panko toasted crumbs with butter and garlic. Family loved it!! Served with roasted potatoes and onions and peas/carrots.

Seasoned the spinach and the egg prior to mixing and added a tablespoon of butter to the spinach and added additional cooking time to ensure that the spinach cooked thoroughly - delish!   Next time ill add onion to the spinach.

It's the first recipe that some of my non-fishing loving friends actually liked.  Usually, I don't care for cheese with my fish, but this is good.  I prefer fresh, not frozen food, so substituted 10 oz of fresh sauteed spinach for the frozen & used EVOO for the oil.  For extra flavor, I sauteed 1 large finely chopped garlic clove in the EVOO before cooking the spinach and also sauteed approx 1/2 cup of chopped Spanish onion with the spinach.  I've made it several times and the baking dish is always empty when dinner is done.

I will make it again; however, there was too much cheese for a fish dish.  Next time, I will add some onion, garlic,  and paprika on top, while eliminating the extra cheese.  None the less, it was quite interesting , quick and simple to make.

Yes I made changes. I used fresh chopped spinach added white wine in the pan before I added the fish. I used Colby jack cheese,  yum.  The oven up to 340-345 degrees until fish was flaky. I'd go heavier on spices for flavor. It was the first time I made it. I  also would  add a bit more flavor tonight I'd use tiny bit of hot sauce. So good though for a first  I'm going to make it again this week.

I mixed 2 boxed of frozen, chopped spinach (thawed and drained)with 4 beaten eggs, garlic, basil, salt, shredded cheese and a tad bit of milk. I wish I'd had half and half.  I spread it out on 2 9x13 pans, then put the fish on top. Baked at 350 for 30 mins or so, then sprinkled bread crumbs and more basil on top and baked a little longer.

I tried to make a dairy free gluten free version of this and it came out pretty good.  Subbed gluten free bread crumbs and goat cheddar in place of regular cheddar. The spinach came out a little dense, next time I will try adding quinoa or rice to lighten it up.

I found this recipe when I was hunting for a new way to fix fish that was not just baked, but still low in carbs as I am diabetic,so cannot eat much battered or breaded fish. This really has become my new favorite way to make fish. I found that the spinach mixture makes a great stuffing for braciole also. I am so happy I found this. Thanks for a new way to eat fish. I too, found that 350 degrees for 30 minutes works out much better as I like my fish really well done. Thanks

I read everyone else's reviews and tweaked it a little bit, therefore I'm giving it four stars. It was absolutely delicious though!

I added a little bit of lemon juice and salt and pepper to the fish before placing it in the baking pan; However, I do wish I added more or let the cod sit in the lemon juice for a little bit because some lemon-pepper taste to the cod would have made it perfect. Adding some minced garlic and parmesan would be wonderful too.

My boyfriend isn't a huge fan of white fish but quite enjoyed this dish. ESPECIALLY the spinach. He polished off that (:

The whole family liked this recipe. Made a few changes, fresh spinach chopped, homemade bread crumbs, perch, sprinkled a little lemon juice on perch before bread crumbs and cheese.  Used reg. cheddar, motz and jack cheeses. After serving, sprinkled a little parm, romao and Asiago to finish setting it off.  I'm definitely going to use this recipe again as well as mess around w/what I put in it.

Wundermous!  I was skeptical, but thoroughly enjoyed this.  My kids DID eat the greens underneath, too!  Second time, I upped the ante adding coarsely chopped collard/mustard greens mix, onions, mushrooms, green pepper, and broccoli...umm!  I did have to cook it 40 mins plus 3 more uncovered under the broiler, though.  Fat cod pieces, I guess.

I wasn't quite sure about this one but it turned out super yummy. I used a loaf pan and layered the tilapia, spinach, cheese, then more tilapia. We topped it with lemon juice, salt and pepper. It was super yummy and we are going to make this a regular in our house!!!

Ahhhmazing! Pregnant and gluten free I am always looking for healthy 1 dish meals and this is it.I used gluten free bread crumbs, shredded cheddar & mozzarella mix(that's all I had) and as suggested by other reviewers I added a splash of cream, mushrooms & onions to spinach. I also drizzled butter and lemon on the fish. I had a very thick fillet so I upped the temp and cooked 35 mins. I am sure there are a million ways to play with this recipe & I can't wait to try!

I thought the fish was good, but wasn't crazy about the spinach. And I like spinach! It just seemed to take on a funny texture, not quite sure if it was due to something I did, but I don't think I'll make this again.

It was just okay. Too spinichy.  Upon recommendations of other reviewers, I added a lot of my own seasonings and I marinated the fish prior to baking. Had I not done these modifications I think it would have been much too bland. I also needed to bake it longer than the specified 20 minutes. I don't think I will make it again.

This is an excellent easy fish dish that's really versatile. I've tried both the cheddar and parmesan versions and they're both great. I use crushed garlic rather than tarragon. And once when I was out of bread crumbs, I added crushed Kashi 7 Grain crackers and the nutty flavor made me switch to this substitution permanently. Try it!

This recipe was easy and great.  Only changes I made were 2 eggs to spinach and Panko bread crumbs mixed with regular ones.  I did not add any cheese to the topping but instead put very little butter on top of bread crumb covering.  LOVED IT!  (Cooked it for 35 minutes @ 330 degrees.)

Made this dish tonight following the recipe exactly, and after 20 minutes at 325 it was nowhere near done.  I put it in for another 5 minutes, then another 10 minutes at 375, then uncovered for an additional 10 minutes before serving it.  Upon reading other reviews it appears only 1/2 lb of fish should have been used as opposed to the lb called for in the original recipe.  My husband enjoyed it so I will try it again with modifications.

This was so simple and quick.  I used parm cheese instead of cheddar because I had some in the fridge.  THe spinach cooked just right and the flavors were awesome.

Enjoyed by myself & my parents - used a combo of Aunt Carol's & the one posted.  Used egg substitute instead of egg which turned out fine.  Baked from 25-30 min.  Overall pleased w/ dish & will make again.

Wonderful and it is definately a keeper.  I do have to admit that I did make some substitutions:  used fresh parmesan instead of cheddar,less bread crumbs and catfish instead of cod baking it loner than the recipe called for.

The fish cooked over the bed of spinach was delicious, but the dish as a whole got mixed reviews. My mother loved the whole thing, my dad ate the spinach (which surprised me!, but didn't enjoy it, and I didn't like the spinach at all. Try over green beans or broccoli.

I made it just as described and while I loved it, all three other members of my family (ages 5, 7, and 36) including two spinach lovers, absolutely hated it. So my 5 and their 0s average out to only 2 stars...sorry.

I followed the recipe exactly and the spinach made it way too juicy.  There was too much water in the bottom and it lacked taste.  It just didn't cut if for me.

This was a nice way to prepare fish. I used Dover Sole because that is what I had in the freezer. I also used fresh spinach. I do think this has room for improvement, however. next time I'll add mushrooms and garlic and maybe a few shots of cayenne pepper sauce.

This was a very good, I added some garlic and onion powder to the spinach and I ended up adding water to the dish before it was done baking because the spinach was extremely dry. So I would recommend not squeezing out the spinach after all but otherwise my whole family enjoyed it including my picky 6 year old son!

I'm undecided about this one, but I went ahead and gave it four stars.  I followed the directions to the 't' and it turned out good.  It's definitely something different to do with fish if you're tired of the same old baked fish recipes.  I can't decide if I'll make it again; it seemed like something was missing in the spinach mixture, but I can't put my finger on the mystery ingredient that would take this recipe from good to great??

The spinach was very good with the bread crumbs and cheese, but there was too much spinach in this recipe.  The texture of the fish and spinach didn't work too well either.  The fish was just okay
