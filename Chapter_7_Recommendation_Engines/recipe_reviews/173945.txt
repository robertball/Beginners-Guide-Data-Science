I made this last night and would recommend using more than 1 cup of half and half because it turned out too dry. I also added sauted shrimp and put in the oven for a few minutes. All in all, a fairly good recipe.

I love smoked gouda!!! I thought this was awesome! I added a little crumbled bacon for texture...it was great, but not necessary. I will be making this again...maybe i'll try meat ravioli next time.

this is an easy and flavorful sauce. my whole family loves it. to make it visually appealing, i top ravioli with diced roma tomatoes and sprinkle green onions. tastes just like the ones from olive garden.

This recipe was awesome!  It's a very rich dish, naturally, and a little goes a long way.  We added a bit of sauted prosciutto on top the first time we made it and it added a nice bit of saltiness.  Excellent as written though!

This recipe sounded sooo good! I love smoked gouda! I ended up adding some oregano, basil and garlic to the sauce, and then put it in a dish, spread some parmesean on top and baked it for a few minutes and it was delish! I did think it was a little overboard with the cheese, so I think next time I'll use mushroom ravioli, but it was such a good idea!!

I like Gouda and I love white sauce but this was not a do over for our family.  I used meat ravoli in one pan and spinach in the other.  We preferred the spinach.  I, like others, had a hard time getting the cheese and cream to mix.  Thanks anyway, but I'll keep looking.

Excellent.  I found letting the sauce sit a little bit (few minutes)  makes it thicken a little--which I prefer.  Had the sauce on the refrigerated cheese ravioli and sausage tortolini combined.  It was a nice combo but I think I liked the ravioli a little bit better in it.  Very rich sauce.  YUMMY!!

I used a bag of frozen ravioli and added chicken.  It was delicious and FAST.  It would also be great with shrimp.

This was a good dish and best of all it uses smoked gouda cheese, which is one of my fav. cheeses.  This was VERY rich and heavy with a nice smokey flavor from the cheese.  I used tortellini in place of the ravioli.  I served this as a side dish and it was a little too heavy for what I served it with.  So it might be better as a main course.  I do think I would like it a little better if it had some veggies or something else to tone down the richness a bit.  Other than that it was good, but I may have to change it up a little next time that I make it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! I used a family size package of fresh asparagus and cheese ravioli and doubled the amount of sauce (but reduced the half-and-half cream to 1 3/4 cup since some reviewers complained that the sauce was a bit runny). I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce and didn't used as much white pepper (I was afraid it might be too peppery for some of my guests). Everyone loved it! But keep it mind that it's quite rich. I would definitely try it with mushroom ravioli or some other type of ravioli without cheese. As a matter of fact, it would be good with any type of pasta... or even on chicken breasts. GREAT recipes! Super easy, super fast and simply delicious!!

This was great with a very subtle smoky flavor.  I used cheese tortellini instead of ravioli.  Even my picky 5 year old had seconds!

Not too good.  The cheese sauce needed something besides cheese and milk to make it work.  It got gluey almost immediately once it chilled from being poured over the pasta.  It had decent smoky flavor but was incredibly one dimensional.  I won't make this again.

The author is right - it tastes gourmet, but is very easy.  I suggest using half the amount of sauce that the recipe calls for.  We had quite a bit left.

Just made this last night and it was an amazing sauce. The store bought ravioli clashed with the sauce though so I think I'll try making it myself next time. Overall though insanely delicious!

This is a great meal, that doesn't take a lot of time. For those who reviewed that the cheese doesn't melt in the sauce...maybe you are not cooking long enough, or hot enough, because I have never had an issue. This is a delicious recipe! A keeper!

Easy and cheap! Same kinda taste as the Ravioli de portobello @ Olive Garden, but quick and easy. The only thing I would change is that I made this for my husband and I. Realistically it is a serving for 2 and I would make 1-1/2 cups of half and half and 1-1/2 cups of shredded cheese because there wasn't enough sauce for us.

Super simple supper!  This recipe is great for busy weeknights.   Loved the ease of using the frozen pasta.  I did use cheese filled tortellini instead of ravioli.  The Gouda gave it a great flavor.  Definitely keeping this recipe on hand for those busy nights or nights when I just don't feel like cooking!

This was amazing, I served this to family visiting and they raved about it. I used Bertoli mushroom-stuffed ravioli; I think cheese raviolli would have been far too much cheese. It was divine, five star quality without a doubt, very "expensive" tasting.I served this with a salad with raspberry vinegrette and crusty bread. YUM

This was ok.  For some reason my sauce wasn't thickening so I had to add a little bit of flour.  Maybe using a chicken ravioli or other meat ravioli would give it more taste.  Just seemed bland.

Yummmmm!!!  Loved the smoked gouda!  I wasn't crazy about the fresh parsley, though, and ended up picking it all off.  I also sprinkled a small amount of mixed dried italian seasonings on the top which was nice.  I will make this again, but next time I won't use the parsley.

Pretty good, but a bit too rich for us. Also would recommend using quality fresh tortellini instead of frozen. Will make again but will try milk instead of half & half.

Very good. I make shrimp scampi to eat with it and use mushroom ravioli. Have made many times. I add minced fresh garlic to my sauce and some Parmesan cheese

Yum! Lick the plate good! I used wild mushroom ravioli. This reminds me of my favorite dish at that well known pasta chain.

The smoked Gouda in this is really good! The only thing I would change in the future is to use slightly less white pepper, it came out a little too peppery for me.

Very good, except I had to add a lot more cheese. The sauce was too thin without the extra cheese.

This was edible but nothing more!  The cheese didn't melt correctly and it was very bland even after I added pepper and garlic.  Sorry, but I will not be making this again.

This was very good.  But very rich.  I added a little of baby spinach to the sauce and left out the parsley (not a fan).  It was delicious!!

The sauce is too runny and had a slight grainy texture no matter how much I whisked it.  I added more cheese to try to thicken it up but it didn't help much.  The taste is very good but I did cut way back on the pepper after reading other reviews.

My family didn't care for this at all.  Followed the recipe to a tee, with the exception of the teaspoon of pepper which would have been way too much. Sorry, but this one is not a keeper in my opinion.

Great flavor- the sauce tastes far more complex than the work I put into it- but a whole teaspoon of white pepper was a bit overpowering.

Super good!  Was easy to make, and tasted great!  My husband who isn't big on white sauce found this one to be great!  Such a unique flavor.

This was quite yummy, except I had a hard time finding a bag of pasta big enough and therefore my pasta was a bit soupy. But still good. I added basil and garlic to the sauce.

Reminds me of a dish served at Olive Garden.  They use mushroom ravioli with theirs.  Thanks, I made this and it was perfect.

Perfect. We love this dish, and I really love the simplicity of it! I didn't have parsley, so I added a sprinkle of dried oregano. Quick, flavorful, and elegant. You can't go wrong with this one. Thank you Amber!

My family loved this! The smoked flavor of the Gouda is delicious. It was easy, quick and truly tasted gourmet.
