I didn't have baking mix, so used 2 cups of flour, 3 tablespoons butter, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and 1 egg. Used milk and chicken broth until the right consistancy was achieved.

Very simple & tasty chicken and dumpling recipe. I used boneless and skinless thighs and breast because that is all I had. It was a little too salty to my taste so next time I will use reduced sodium soup. I will definitely make this again on a cold winter night. Thanks for sharing Caryl!

This recipe is the way I make my chicken & dumplings. Always brown the chicken & keep pieces whole. I always make my chicken stock the day before so I can skim off all of the fat. You need A LOT of stock/broth. This recipe & method is one of the better ones. If you debone the chicken you actually end up with a dumpling soup.

While this recipe did not have a lot of reviews, it reminded me of the chicken and dumplings my mom used to make when I was a kid. It was just as delicious. I made it exactly the way it was stated except  I did add some canned carrots at the end just for color. Everybody loved it.  My ex-husband said it even made the carrots taste good and he hates cooked carrots.
