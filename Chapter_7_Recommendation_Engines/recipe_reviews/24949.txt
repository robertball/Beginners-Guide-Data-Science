I just made this recipe and i should have went with my gut instinct.I should have used white sugar instead of brown sugar. The molasses after taste is terrible.I believe the problem with the thick consistancy is from boiling it too long.It really only needs to be boiled about 3 minutes.

I couldn't imagine how boiling chocolate for 5 minutes wasn't going to taste burnt, but I stirred it constantly and it doesn't. I use it for ice cream topping and the flavor is very very good, much better than the last $10.00 jar of fancy hot fudge sauce I purchased. It tastes even better after it has had time to sit in the fridge. Texture is like very thick pudding, but easy to adjust with a little milk and heating. Chocoholics - the best way to appreciate it is straight out of the container.

This recipe is a little more like pudding and less like chocolate sauce. So when it began cooling, I stirred in 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1 tbsp of corn syrup.  Brought it to a party and served it with canteloupe, strawberries and oranges.  Everybody loved it!

Awesome dipping sauce, I looked at some of the recent suggestions and based on those and prior cooking projects I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar I also used 2% no name evap milk and no name cocoa, I eyeballed the vanilla :)

Instead of letting the mixture come to a boil for 3 to 5 min I just let it start to boil and then turned it off cooking it enough to slightly thicken and knowing that when it cooled it would thicken a bit more. I also stirred it occasionally with a whisk until it was luke warm before I refrigerated it.  It turned out perfect, no skin on top not the consistency of jello just a great dipping sauce that I would imagine goes perefect on just about anything, we used it for pecan pie drizzled on top and on a serve yourself fruit salad.  This recipe is a real keeper and will never waste my money again on anything store bought.  Thanks for sharing it.

I was looking for a chocolate sauce to put over my home made vanilla ice cream. THIS sauce ROCKS! I love it! I halved the recipe and omitted the butter. This one is definitely a KEEPER. Tastes delicious!

All I can say is MMMMMM!  This dipping sauce is a lot like chocolate pudding. I used fat free evaporated milk and added more as needed.  Without the extra milk, it has a dark chocolate taste which is much too bitter for me.  I served this with strawberries, bananas, angel food cake and graham crackers.  One guy said "Now this is classy!" A must for any chocoholic.

I thought that this was okay.  My dinner guest, however, commented that it tasted like chocolate pudding.  Next time, I'll go with a sauce that has real chocolate in it.

This was a little on the thick side when cooled. It thinned out nicely with some added milk though.

This is great for thsoe who really like a true chocolate taste. I prefer more of a milk chocolate flavor and found this slightly bitter, but it still worked out well.

I am not a good cook.  I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great.  The sauce is thick but not like pudding; the chocolate stuck right to the strawberries we dipped into it and it was fabulous on ice cream.  We really liked it and will make it again!

I needed to cut this recipe in half but accidentally used the whole can of evaporated milk... Best baking accident ever. Came out more like the consistency of pudding, but was great for layering on cookies. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great! Huge hit with grilled pineapple, mangoes and strawberries at a dinner party. Next time I might try this with a bit less sugar and a bit more cocoa powder.

I made this for dipping strawberries into. I didn't have any evaporated milk so I had to use whipping cream. LOL It was still really good, and the family could barely contain themselves through supper knowing this treat was waiting for them.

Deep, smooth, rich chocolate flavor. Easy recipe! I was out of brown sugar so I went with white- next time will try using brown sugar or sugar in the raw to add that wonderful molasses flavor.

I was hesitant to try this just because the picture doesn't look very chocolatey.  But it was delicious!! It is thick but we liked it that way. Sooo yummy!
