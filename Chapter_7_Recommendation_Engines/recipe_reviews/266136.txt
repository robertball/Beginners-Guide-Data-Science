Good, simple recipe if you go with a solid store-bought pesto.  Would be even better with homemade in summer with garden tomatoes. 
Be careful with the seasoning on the broccoli, as the pesto saltiness bleeds down into it.  
Kid-friendly and a nice way to sneak in a tasty low-carb, nutrient-heavy satisfying meal.
