Made this for dinner tonight and I really liked it.  I served it with meatballs.  I did add 1 teaspoon of sugar though.  Just to give it a hint of sweetness.  Overall, I thought it was a good, easy and quick sauce to make.

I'm rating this based on using chicken broth and chicken, as suggested as possible by the submitter of the recipe.  I did use dried dill but kept everything else as written.  The photos I took show the recipe just like that.  When I went to serve it to my husband, though, I added a tablespoon of butter to the sauce, hoping to cut down on the vinegary taste.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total balsamic vinegar lover!  And I'm betting that the two tablespoons works great when using beef stock and beef of some sort with this recipe.  I'd suggest starting out with just one for the chicken alternative and seeing what you think.  I will try this again because I think it is a good, basic recipe.  Thanks!

I made this sauce to put over pasta. We loved it. I think you have to enjoy balsamic vinegar to enjoy it and as with every recipe buy good quality vinegar. It will make all the difference. I didn't have fresh dill or thyme so I used the same amount in dried. Very tasty sauce.
