Very good! I marinated the chicken overnight for maximum flavor. I did take the skin off of the chicken legs to make them a bit healthier. I baked these for about 30 minutes, removed the cover and about 20-30 minutes more (they were really big legs), basting a few times in the glaze. Really nice flavors...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
