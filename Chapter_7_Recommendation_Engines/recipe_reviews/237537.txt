I'm still not sure if it was totally great idea but what I decided to do with this recipe was to roast the asparagus, (which is on sale now) covered with bacon slices and I roasted it all at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. At that point, the asparagus was nicely done, but the bacon wasn't. So, I put the bacon back in and roasted it for another 15 minutes until it was crisp. At that point, I then poured the bacon drippings into a saute pan and I made the  roux. Once it was thickened enough, I topped my toasted bread slices with the roasted asparagus, followed by the roux,  my now crumbled bacon,  and just a few shreds of cheese.  It was absolutely delicious! I will do it again but next time I will roast the asparagus separately from the bacon because of those pesky differences in cooking times. Haha.

Made this for hubby and I with freshly picked asparagus. Yummy!! Tasted just like his Gram's. One added step I'll take for next batch is to cut the asparagus before boiling. If that was in the steps, I missed it, but would make eating a little easier. Really tasty!!

Tasted great. Added a handful of grated cheddar. Made the cleanup a bit more difficult but worth it. Chopped asparagus into segments before adding to sauce.

Made this for my husband.  He loved it!  Said his mom use to make this for him when he was younger and it tasted just as good.

We loved this, even my husband who hates this kind of stuff loved it. I added chicken that I cut into small cubes and sprinkled granulated onion and granulated garlic  on then precooked it before adding it to the main recipe. I also took the advice of another rater and cut my asparagus before adding it. It made a great dinner.

Amazing. I didn't have a grandmother who lived close growing up, so I guess I missed out on this as a child. But I love asparagus and was just looking through recipes and found this. Life changing !! Will forever be a staple. I added a little more seasonings based on personal preferences, and placed the mixture on top of some toasted Italian bread. Sprinkled some old bay on top (I'm from Maryland, we old bay everything, lol) So happy to have found this recipe. Kudos.

Followed this recipe exactly and felt like I was back at my grandmother's table as a a kid! The husband loves it topped with a fried egg. We'll be making this for years to come.
