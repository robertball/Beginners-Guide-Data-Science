When tomatoes are not in season, I recommend using sundried tomatoes along with some grape/cherry tomatoes.  Great recipe!  Crowd pleaser!

Easy peasy to make, beautiful too! It has been a hit both times I have made it. Served with French bread soft or toasted...excellent!

Loved this simple appetizer! The tomatoes lend a nice color, however, I'm not a fan of the texture, just a personal thing. I added a few soaked sundried tomatoes, chopped for color. Frankly, it is good with just the basil, as well. Be sure the goat cheese is brought to room temperature, it will spread more easily. I prefer the bread toasted but often serve this with the "lighter" plain Stacey chips.

Yummy and simple.  The pesto did leave a little oil pool around the edges (maybe that wouldn't have happened if I'd used a pie plate instead of a regular plate).  I thought about sopping it up for the aesthetics, but decided people would want to dunk their bread in it.  I found that 9 oz of French bread wasn't enough.  I had to us tortilla chips to finish it - they were acceptable, but the bread was a better pairing.

I brought this to a cookout tonight and got a lot of very impressed comments. It killed me to say that it was just three ingredients evenly spaced.

Loved this recipe!  It's great on bread, crackers, sandwiches, or even as a pasta sauce.  The pesto flavor can be a little strong, so use no more than the amount in the recipe.  I also add another tomato as well.

Yes. It was easy and oh so good. It has become a favorite.
