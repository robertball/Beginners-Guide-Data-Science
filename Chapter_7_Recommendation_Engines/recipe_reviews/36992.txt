I  gave this to all of my friends who are looking for a delicious crunchy veggie dish,  It is in  my refreigerator every week so when I am hungry, I just scoop up a bit and wow ...it is great.  Two fresh lemons and the jicama veggie are a MUST HAVE  I also add cilantro, salt and a touch of pepper. Because you use the English Cucumber and the plum tomatoes, it does not get soggy.

Thank Haven for the produce guy because I had no idea what the difference was between a English cucumber & a regular one, much less what a jicama was. I was skeptical about the jicama, but I'm going to be looking for more recipes with it. This is a keeper, but I'd refrigerate several hours before serving because it tastes better & the flavors can blend.

This is a wonderful salad. I have made it both with jicama and without. Without it is more traditional and with, a little more modern and more cruncy. I have also used different colors of peppers mixed together to give it a more colorful appearance.It has become my favorite salad.

The taste was good, but as an Israeli girl I must say- NOT very authentic! We don't even have jicama in Israel! Let alone English cucumbers! The usual salad spices are black pepper, salt, lots of freshly squeezed lemon juice, and maybe chopped green onion or parsley. I recomment adding a couple of grated carrots.

This was a pretty looking salad.  My husband actually walked by & asked if I'd made a fruit salad.  The taste is mild.  If you want more of a zing, I guess you could add something like garlic to it.  I served the red onions on the side as my husband isn't a big onion fan.  I'd never bought jicama (or an English cucumber) before & it was a nice change.  The jicama adds more of a crisper texture, almost like an apple.  This is a nice healthy alternative to the standard lettuce salad.

This recipe is delicious and like the others have said, it gets better the second or third day. I love to put it in a whole wheat tortilla with a slice of turkey. Makes for a quick, delicious and healthy lunch.

Omitted the tomatoes for fear of it getting soggy, but this is a really yummy summer dish! Very crunchy and refreshing - this can easily be doubled to serve a crowd,and I find it maintained well the next day. This stuff is also good served in pitas, or on its own with a some grilled chicken mixed in.

This wasn't what I expected, but worked out well for the meal I made.  This resembled more of a salsa - but we had pita and seasoned ground turkey meat, so we just added this in and it was pretty good.  I would not recommend using dried parsley, it made it look terrible.  I would use fresh parsley.

I have gotten so many compliments on this dish that I make it whenever I want to impress dinner guests! It's absolutely delicious and a great spin on a familiar Israeli standard.

This is a great salad!  I served it at a BBQ and will do so again, people liked the crunch and flavors.  It was many of their's first taste of jicama and I they enjoyed it for the most part.  I didn't have dried parsley and substituted dried basil, I'd consider adding fresh cilantro next time.

I had extra cucumbers and jicama on hand that I didn't know what to do with, this recipe was a perfect light, healthy use of those fresh ingredients. I did remove the seeds from the tomatoes before dicing them to keep it from getting too wet and mushy.

I fixed this as an experiment because it looked and sound good.  I had not tried jicama before because I didn't know anything about it.  I had a tossed salad ready just in case we didn't like this, but my hubby and I both loved it.  I did leave out the onion because I'm not a big fan of raw onion and I added a little bit of a special family recipe oil and vinegar dressing to it after I had eaten some because I like things a bit spicy.  I thought my friend would like it and I gave her a copy several days ago.  Last night she gave a large dinner party for about 15 to 20  people and this salad was featured.  I think everyone was raving about how delicious it was, and I think my friend and her daughter followed the recipe to the letter except:  they used both red and yellow peppers, which added more color, and left out the onion.  And, as several other reviewers commented, the dish is even better the 2nd day.  Thanks for a great recipe for fresh delicious food.

very little flavor to the dressing, and I didn't like the jicama at all. It didn't have a flavor, and was tough and almost inedible even after peeling. Was looking for a healthy alternative to the usual salad or veggie tray, but I think next time I'll stick with the veggie tray....

This is a very fresh tasting summery salad.  The jicama is a nice change of pace from all the usual vegetables.  I don't think you really need to add the oil or the parsley.  Next time I will try coarse sea salt instead of the regular which I think drains the tomatoes.

I love the taste of this salad. Very refreshing. I can't wait to make it with the fresh veggies from our own garden later this year.

This is a nice, refreshing salad. The jicama added a great crunch and a slightly sweet flavor. I had some fresh mint that needed to be used, so I added that and it went well with the flavors. Plus, I used fresh parsley, and green onions instead of red. A definite keeper!

Quite good. I left out the bell pepper and added red pepper flakes and used cilnatro instead of parsley. I do think this needs a bit more spices so at the table I added a bit of a cajun spice blend.

I LOVE this salad.  I've been making it for a few years now with different variations.  Sometimes without jicama etc.  But for special occasions I always make it with the jicama.  Sometimes I add red and green pepper as well.  I always make it when I have a brunch at my house.  People love it.  Very refreshing and healthy!

I made this with left over super bowl beginning platter.  I do throw about a quarter of jalapeño in, chopped tiny!  Adds just enough kick without being overwhelming.

I had to use up some veggies so I used cherub and starburst baby tomatoes cut in half and the jicama. Green onion instead of red onion. Only had 2 tbl of fresh lemon so had to add 1 tbl bottled. Used dried basil instead of parsley.  Tasting the dressing, I added just a pinch of sugar.  Didn't have cucumber. Subbed quartered artichoke hearts.  Yummy!
