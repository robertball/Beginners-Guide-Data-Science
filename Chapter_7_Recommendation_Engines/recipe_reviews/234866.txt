I loved this recipe, it is a very hearty soup.  I reserved some of the cubed potatoes because I like a chunky soup.  I also wanted some more veggies, so I added in some diced carrots and celery.  This is such a versatile recipe, you can use whatever veggies you have on hand.  It's an awesome comfort soup on a snowy weekend on the East Coast in January.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written. I really liked it, and my husband loved it! Next time I think I will add more vegetables and hot sauce. All in all, a really good recipe. Thank You!

I wanted to have more vegetables incorporated, so I had to add more vegetable broth too. I used broccoli crowns, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, a 1/2 leek. I had 2/3 lbs of tofu chorizo to use. I don't usually use white potatoes, but I bought 2 large ones that gave me 4 or 5 cups of chopped potatoes. after the potatoes cooked I added 1 cup of silken tofu, instead of adding cow's milk later. I had to add a little more water when I added the kale, it was too thick, my doing because of the tofu. it ended up very creamy. it was very filling, the only thing we didn't like was the kale, it was still too chewy for me. it didn't need salt n pepper.

My first review because this soup rocks!,Like others, I left out broccoli and added carrots and extra mushrooms, For the vegetarian I divided soup and added cooked chorizo to only half of it. Hot sauce provided extra flavor , This is a keeper for cold Chicago winters!

This is an amazing soup! I tripled the recipe to make a bunch for leftovers this week. I used 1-2 red potatoes, 1 large sweet potato and 1 Yukon gold. I also added some cauliflower, a bit of zucchini. I did use the broccoli and mushrooms.  My chorizo was bulk and it worked great that way, not in a casing. I kept looking at the recipe for what other herbs and spices to add...but beyond the chicken stock, chorizo and salt/pepper there was nothing...and it didn't need anything else. Perfectly yummy. I keeper for sure!

I made it and didn't use broccoli, but I also switched out both heavy and light cream with....coconut milk.  What a awesome addition/swap.  Great either way though, but nice to switch it up.

This is a great base recipe.  I used about 10 oz sweet potato for this, and it was just the right amount of potato.  I also subbed yogurt for the cream.
