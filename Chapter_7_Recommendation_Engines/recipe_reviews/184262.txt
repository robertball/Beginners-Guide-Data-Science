I usually stick with recipes that have been well reviewed but chose this salad because it was simple looked good and I already had all the ingredients. I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and followed it exactly but found it was far too sour. I'd consider making this salad again but would scale down the cider vinegar and maybe the lemon juice down.

I likely reduced the vinegar and lemon (I didn't measure it out) but I really love salad and I liked this one! I had to use up apples and feta so it was perfect! I added some sunflower seeds too.

I made as written except that I used a pre-packaged green mix. This was indeed very sour as others stated but that is what made it so good in my opinion. I can see how it might be overpowering to some though so you might start out cutting back on the vinegar and lemon juice. I think the feta could be scaled down too which would make this even healthier. This would pair very nicely with fish or any type of seafood and it has an elegant look about it which would be great for serving to company.

Very sour but balanced with sweet apples. Cannot eat a lot of. Great starter salad.

I don't think that I would make this salad again. It was nice but it wasn't "wow."
