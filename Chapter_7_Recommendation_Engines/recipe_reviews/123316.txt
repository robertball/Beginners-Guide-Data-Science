Unbelievable and incredible. I have always thought corn muffins and bread were only...eh. I was hoping this recipe would change my mind. Verdict: YEP!! I object to the typical dryness of cornbread, and in reading the reviews, this sounded more cake-like, which it is. As other reviewers did, I decreased the amount of sugar to 3/4 c. and (to my taste buds) it could probably go further than that to half a cup or 2/3. Personally, if I were serving these for breakfast, I'd go sweeter; if for dinner, I'd decrease the sugar and go more savory. The important thing here is really the texture...so moist and just corn meal-y enough to be more like corn bread than cake. This made 12 good decent-sized muffins...no small muffins here. TIP: This would be excellent with lemon, zest, and the addition of blueberries for a breakfast dish; parmesan, cracked pepper and rosemary with decreased sugar to serve with chicken or chili. MUAH!

Without a doubt the best "from scratch" corn muffins I have ever had. I sprayed a mini-muffin pan and baked for 15 minutes. They came out perfectly. They even  passed the freezer test - just as moist and delicious after being frozen! I made five batches for my daughter's grad party and served them with honey butter. One of the guests left with his mouth full of muffin, waving and shouting goodbye.

Nice sweet flavor and very moist. I did not have shortening, so I used canola oil instead. I also used jumbo eggs, and that was a bit too much egg.  If you have only large eggs, I'd suggest using just one.

Best corn muffin recipe I've found.  I substituted plain natural-style yogurt for the milk--makes the muffins very moist and tender--and used white whole wheat flour (at my age, every little bit of extra fiber helps!)

These muffins turned out perfectly!  They were exactly what I wanted--moist, sweet, with a fine, tender crumb.  They were surprisingly light and airy, probably due to the use of the electric mixer, which incorporated a lot of air into the batter.  Even making just half of the recipe, I ended up with enough batter for 6 muffins AND half a loaf pan's worth of corn bread.  What a happy surprise!  Just remember, if you end up with extra batter like me, be prepared to bake the leftover batter in the loaf pan an extra 15-20 minutes.

This is the best corn muffin recipe I've tried so far.  It's more of a cake like muffin, very moist and doesn't crumble which I love.  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Next time I will try 1/2 cup of sugar. I ended up making 12 regular size muffins and 6 mini ones.  I baked the mini ones for about 12 minutes.  They didn't brown on the top like the other person's who baked them in mini loaves.  They all came out a pale yellow with a tiny ring of brown at the base of the muffin top.  Delicious with or without butter!!

These muffins had a good moist crumb. I only used 1/2 cup sugar b/c I like to use honeybutter on corn muffins. I think 1 cup of sugar would have been way too much. I made regular muffins and also muffin tops. I found I popped the stumps off the regular muffins anyway. I recommend muffin tops...nice crisp brown top to these :)

These turned out so light and fluffy, will definitely make again!  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c, substituted fine-ground wheat flour for the white, and baked them in mini muffin pans for 10 min.

A nice surprise. I did substitue some of the sugar with honey, and would you believe I discovered that I was out of corn meal half way through mixing. I used some frozen corn kernels -- YUMMY!

These were very good. They are sweet, fairly moist on the inside and slightly crunchy on the out side.

I love this muffin recipe!!! It was exactly what I was looking for. Sweet. Cakey. Corny. Delicious! I wanted to make some blueberry corn muffins and this was perfect. I added 1 cup of thawed frozen blueberries and drained their liquid off. I ended up adding 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract to it too. I don't use shortening so I used grapeseed oil instead. (Canola would be fine too, I'm sure) I also used 1/4 cup less sugar than called for and they were still perfectly sweet. If you want very sweet corn muffins I'd suggest adding the full amount. The final change I made was adding a little vinegar to my milk to make it buttermilk. 

This made more than 12 regular muffins. I filled my muffin tin more than 3/4 and still had a bit left over. With my extra batter I heated a small skillet, put a good amount of butter in it and poured the batter in the pan. I flipped it about the same time I would a pan cake and WOW. We will be having these for breakfast sometime. They were incredible. Needed no syrup (I used a tiny splash of maple anyway). 

Also mine were golden brown 5 minutes earlier than 25min.

So all in all a great recipe and one that will happily stand up to changes. Thanks Patty!!! You did the work for me by changing the recipe. 

PS: A secret to some of the best corn muffins at a favorite East Coast restaurant chain is to add lemon extract and the zest of one lemon and a couple teaspoons of lemon juice to corn muffin batter. It makes a light, delicately lemon corn muffin.

Perfect! 3/4c of sugar and butter instead of shortening. No changes otherwise as others stated has the sweetness of Jiffy without all the preservatives and weird texture.

exceptional!  Moist, flavorful...the best recipe I have found.  Will work on adding actual corn to the recipe for "Kentucky" type corn bread.

If the instructions were more precise I'd rate this a 5, but the shortening part threw me a bit... didn't say whether you should melt it or not... How can you just beat eggs, unmelted shortening and milk into a dry mix unless you melt the shortening? Anyhow, I subbed oil because it made it easier for me and someone else said they had and it turned out fine. I also subbed in whole wheat white flour and used white corn meal. Based on other reviews and the stated "sweetness" of the recipe I also halved the sugar, but used splenda brown. In addition I was leery of beating flour and eggs together when I wanted a tender crumb, so  I mixed them more like a quickbread, creating a well in the dry ingredients and adding all the liquids at once, then folding carefully with my rubber spatula until the whole thing was smooth. They turned out lovely, and were a great foundation for the homemade jam my aunt sent us for Christmas, lol.

Made these this morning after reading all of the reviews. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1 tsp pure vanilla. I used canola oil. I used fat free milk. Used my hand mixer. I oiled the muffin tins - did not use paper liners. Delicious. While warm they were hard to remove but I couldn't wait. Delicious with butter and honey. Made 18 medium muffins. The last 6 were left in the tins and when I returned home came out easily now that they were cool. Delicious plain. Definitely a keeper. Very easy to make.

Great taste and super easy to mix up.  I like sweet muffins, but I do think I could cut the amount of sugar slightly and still enjoy them...  I used all vegetable oil for the shortening and it worked just fine.

This is the best corn muffin recipe I've tried yet. The muffins are quite moist and SWEET. Delicious with butter. I used brown turbinado sugar because it was all I had in the house and they turned out fine. Also substituted coconut oil for shortening, and recipe came out great.

I'm a veteran baker (of cookies, cakes, pies, WHATEVER), and I was looking for a sweet corn muffin recipe to try to satisfy my husband's craving.  Well, this recipe tastes good and is easy to make.  But I don't usually bake muffins in paper cups.  Usually only cupcakes if I'm making them for my kid's class at school.  Just a waste of money if you ask me.  So I generously greased my muffin pan before I poured this batter in . . . . and I still could not extricate these muffins from the pan without pretty much pulling apart the tops from the rest of the muffin almost every time.  What a horrible, crumbly mess.  So if you don't mind using the liners every single time, then go ahead and try this.  I'm not gonna bother.  I'm still on the lookout for another recipe because I'm not baking this one ever again, that's for sure.

I made this recipe without reading any of the reviews and wasn't surprised to find that I was not the only one who cut the sugar in the muffin.  I went with 3/4 cup (for one batch) and next time I would go with 1/2.  That said, they were still delicious, just a little bit sweet.  They get 5 stars on their own just because they were not dry!!

A little crumbly sort of like cornbread. I halved the sugar though so maybe more sugar would help the muffin hold together. I topped mine with a little honey butter and they tasted fantastic!

These were great! Not too sweet for me and my family. I might use my stand mixer next time to mix it though. I did add about 1/2 cup or more of frozen (thawed) corn folded in right at the end because I love con in my corn bread.

I took the suggestion from Christina and cut the sugar back to 3/4 of a cup. I also used whole wheat white flour, buttermilk instead of regular milk and melted butter instead of shortening, only because I don't have much shortening on hand now. These were done at 20 minutes in my oven, but I think it's because it runs fast. My boys really liked this, it's more of a cakey cornbread which is something that they really prefer. This was light and fluffy and very good. PERFECT companion for chili.

FANTASTIC! I just took these out of the oven for dinner tonight, and I already ate 2, lol! I did cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup, but that was my only change. These are light and moist and delicious...just what I had hoped for. I actually got 19 muffins out of this and baked them @ 325 for about 15 minutes, which was perfect for my super hot oven. I can't wait to eat them with our chili tonight, as I know they will go great together. This recipe will be made many more times in my house! Thanks for sharing. :)

So easy!  I followed this recipe to the T and came out with 12 muffins and a half a pan of corn bread... as others have mentioned its best to keep your eye on them as mine for sure didn't take that long to cook. Will make again, my family loves them!

These had great flavor, but I made only 12 like the recipe said and paid the consequences.  This recipe would easily make 18 muffins.  They don't rise up nice and tall like some muffins do, instead the are flat topped muffins that spread, more like a cupcake.  I had an absolute mess in the oven from them spreading all over the pan.  I knew bettter when I filled the cups, I knew they were too full (more than 3/4) but I figured the person that wrote the recipe knew what they were talking about.   I will trust my instincts next time.

Excellent muffins.  This will now be the recipe I turn to for sweet corn muffins.  I used melted butter in place of the shortening and let the batter rest 15 minutes prior to filling muffin tins.  Yielded 6 regular size muffins and 24 mini muffins.

Perfection! Just what I have been looking for!  The recipes I have tried have always come out too dry, too flat, off taste (jiffy. ew.), or not sweet enough. I used 1/2 reg sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar, used a tsp more baking powder, canola oil instead of shortening. They don't come off on the wrapper and they don't fall apart! Heaven cut in half in toaster oven w/butter. I think they would be fine with a little less sugar as others have said.  Will do next time!

AMAZING! Thank you so much for sharing! My husband has been dreaming about the corn muffins he used to get when he was a kid at his local grocery store but they stopped making them years ago. This recipe made his day!! I used about 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 brown sugar for a depth of flavor, substitued yogurt for milk, and only used 1 egg. Thanks again!

Came out just perfect!  I followed previous reviewers advice and cut down the sugar to about 1/2 cup.   The entire recipe did yield 12 muffins, which was nice not to have a bunch of leftover batter, or not to have enough batter to fill an entire muffin tin. I also served this with the honey butter from this site.  That is the ONLY way to serve these cornbread muffins.  Wonderful for my 10 year old and my husband for breakfast this morning!

Loved these!  I subbed soy milk for the dairy milk. egg beaters for the whole egg and butter for the shortening.  I also added a tablespoon of Benefiber to up the health value.  We like to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter as well.  I cut the sugar back to 3/4 of a cup and it was just right.  Will be making these again and again!

These are very good. I made them exactly to the recipe and they are sweet, so the second batch I cut the sugar to 3/4. These make great corn pancakes also with a little honey butter.

Just made these this morning.  Perfectly lovely even if I did fill the liners right to the top! In fact, there was enough batter left to give me a dozen mini ones, too! I think this will be my cornmeal muffin recipe from now on.

Excellent - sweetness of Jiffy corn muffins but *MUCH* better texture - very light and moist. I only used 3/4 cup sugar and these were still very sweet.

These are pretty good! I added blueberries to mine cause I had them in the freezer (* NOTE* If you are going to add frozen fruit, let thaw first and FOLD them in at the very end of your batter. ) I also used one stick of I Can't Believe It's Not better in replace of shortening and 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of sugar.I also used 1/2 cup of condensed milk at the end cause I ran out of regular. Crispy outside, moist and fluffy inside!

Very good corn muffin.  My family enjoyed them.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They had a nice tender crumb.  I like my corn muffins sweet but these were a little too sweet.  Next time I will decrease the sugar a littte.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

These are soooo yummy!!! They are light and sweet, not gritty or dry like some cornbread. My only complaint is that they were so light the tops lifted off and the bottoms stayed in the pan! My hint is to fill the cups a little less full so the whole muffin stays together better.

DEFINITELY try these! - They were simple and delicious. Gone are the dry, crumbly, grainy corn muffins I was accustomed to! -These were terrific texture but I made 2 substitutions and one minor addition. I didn't have enough sugar and didn't have shortening nor oil so instead I used half cup corn syrup + half cup table (pancake) syrup and then used half cup melted margarine. I also added about a tsp of vanilla extract with the last part of the milk. Mine, with the syrup substitutions were not quite sweet enough, so next time I'll add another 1/4-1/2 cup syrup. As is, they are very tasty, just a little  more savoury than sweet. Made 22 regular muffins, and they are a hit! My kids range from 16 to 5 and they, as well as my husband and I are definite fans. Interested to see if they taste different when cooled. Will definitely make again!

These muffins are sooo good. They are moist and fluffy. I added a bit less sugar though, and I also belended the mix whith a hand mixer for extra fluff. Wait till they cool to take them out of the pan otherwise they will crumble.

We didn't have any shortening in the house, so we substituted melted butter.
Had fresh buttermilk on hand, so it was substituted for the milk.  We added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.  This is called Sweet Corn Muffins and they aren't kidding.  It matched well with the Mustang Chili, Northern White and Red Beans and Sauteed Winter Greens that rounded out the meal.  May add a bit more buttermilk and decrease the sugar next time.  A keeper.

These were super yummy!  I substituted honey for the sugar (little less than 1 cup) and used more corn meal (1 cup of corn meal and about 1 1/4 cup flour). Also, I used vegetable oil since I didn't have shortening.  These came out fabulous!  More cake-like and a little sweet; I think the honey made them awesome!  Great recipe!!

Great texture & flavor!  I did use margarine, as butter is getting too expensive:( & still tasted great!  Reduced sugar by 1/4 & could easily reduce more.  Also did 1/3 of flour as wheat flour. Tip: Ground my own corn kernels in Nutrimill. If doing so, grind about 1/2 way between 'fine' & 'coarse' to get cornmeal.

THIS is the cornbread recipe I've been looking for.  Didn't change a thing.  Made a dozen Friday night, they were gone by Saturday morning with a request that I make more.  I really liked step of dividing the milk; made for a muffin that was light and fluffy, yet retained that cornbread texture.  Some reviewer mentioned reducing the sugar, and I can see this recipe working even if not as sweet, but for me, it is perfect as is.

Excellent.  I would prefer less sugar but the kids loved them as is! I used coconut oil instead of shortening.  Best of all, I didn't have to slather on tons of butter because they are moist all in themselves.

To make it healthier, I substitute 1/4 cup Ground Flax Seeds for 1/4 cup AP Flour. I also use Butter instead of Shortening. Oh, I use only 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp of granulated sugar. But that depends on individual preference of sweetness. Thanks for sharing.

yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!  Not too sweet for me!  Made these 3 times now in the last few months and I was never really a fan of corn bread before.  It's a little difficult to get past that gritty-ness of the corn meal, but when they are this scrumptious, the gritty goes away!  I had 4 left over from one batch and made another for Easter, I think we took like 23 muffins (or something close to that) and they were gone with just 8 adults and 3 picky eating children!!  MAKE THIS RECIPE!  You won't be sorry!

These came out great using vegetable oil in place of the shortening!  I tried it based on a review that mentioned canola oil, because I don't like to use shortening since it is hydrogenated (trans fat).  I was very happy with the texture as well as the sweetness.  I was looking for a somewhat sweet muffin for breakfast and used the whole cup of sugar which was definitely not too sweet--just right.  Also, my muffins baked for about 30 mins.  Overall very easy recipe and very delicious!

I modified this recipe by cutting back on the sugar to 3/4 c since some thought it was too sweet and tasted like cake.  Next time I will not cut back on sugar and use equal parts of flour and corn meal since I believe the cake taste is due to too much flour and not enough cornmeal.

I hate making corn muffins because they never come out good. This recipe is delicious! My husband wanted corn muffins, so I figured let me try once more. I didn't have white sugar, I used Turbinado (Sugar in the raw) and they still came out great! Next time, I will try coconut oil instead of shortning. Mine baked in 20-22 minutes. These are delicious!

Very good and simple recipe! I like corn muffins a little sweet (not too much) and these were perfect. I did use half sugar and half honey - make sure to grease the pan well or use liners!

Have to add my 2 cents.  I LOVED these muffins!  I used canola oil because I wasn't sure about the shortening.  I used a tad less sugar and they tasted great.  I think I overmixed them, because they were a little crumbly.  I think I should hand mix them next time and that might help.  Will definitely make again!

I made a double batch of these for my husband to take to work & they were gone in a matter of minutes! Everyone ate them right up! I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and made 1 batch of regular sized muffins & the other batch into mini loafs which needed a few extra minutes to cook but they were tasty!!!

Made these over the 4th to accompany our Baby Back ribs, and they were exactly what I was looking for!!  The only changes I made was to cut the sugr to 3/4 cup, and I baked these into mini muffins, which I baked for exactly 13 minutes.  Will definately be using this recipe many more times!!  Thanks Patty

Perfect!  Nice and light.  Very tasty and very easy to make.  I used oil instead of traditional shortening.

These are the best corn muffins I have ever had! My husband asks me to make them for him at least once a week. Whenever I take them to events people always rave about them and ask for the recipe! The only things I do differently are use a little less sugar than called for, and add a few spoonfuls of unsweetened, plain yogurt which make them even more moist.

These were delicious! We used 1/2 cup sugar for the muffins we had for dinner but made some more for breakfast the next morning with blueberries and 3/4 cup sugar! We will use this recipe again and again!

I've made this recipe a couple of times and just made a couple of minor changes. I used whole wheat flour instead and added 1 tsp of vanilla. The first time I made it, it came out a little dry. I thought it was odd since the other reviews said it was moist. However, I craved the taste of corn muffins and added a can (398m/14 oz) of Creamed Corn! Perfect!! But I also remembered having a muffin with corn niblets in.  So my finally change, a can of niblets (drained) added to the mixed. (It's like adding chocolate chips to the cookie dough) I think the corn niblets needed to be heated or slightly cooked first before adding them. I also preferred to butter my pans instead of using the paper cups! These have become a bit hit with the family and friends.  :)

These are great! I made them vegan by using 2 mashed bananas instead of eggs and almond milk instead of cow's milk, and I also made them a bit healthier by using coconut oil instead of shortening and using 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 agave nectar. I also added chopped strawberries for a wonderful combination. Even with all of the modifications, these didn't taste "healthy" at all!

Just finished making these and they are the best "from scratch" corn muffin I have ever made, and I have tried many. I made the recipe exactly as written and they were just how I wanted them. I made them for breakfast/snacking so the sweetness was fine. All must remember the recipe states "sweet".

Excellent is all I can say! As with others, I cut the sugar down.  I made a double batch and used 1.5 cups of sugar. I also substituted butter for the shortening because I didn't have any shortening and they came out great!

Finally, a corn muffin with bisquik.  Just like my grandmother used to make back in the '40's.  She would use about half the sugar this calls for.  This is the best one I have found and will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing.

I halved the recipe and it made 11 decent sized muffins.  I only used 1/4 cup sugar (thought 1/2 cup was too much) and skim milk.  Everything else as written.  Sprayed the muffin pan with Pam so no need for muffin liners.  Great recipe in a pinch!  Went great with Megan Rae's Chicken Tetrazzini from this site.  My husband who is  not a big corn bread fan, ate these because they were not "hard" on the bottom.

Great recipe.  Used it as a base to make some modifications to try and match a corn muffin I tried in a local BBQ place.  Used 1 c. corn flour, butter (instead of shortning), 3/4 of brown sugar, 35% cream (i just didnt have milk handy), I added diced jalepenos (2 small) to the batter, and finally shredded colby, jack and cheddar cheese on top of each (which creates like a bubbly crust).  Recipe yielded 9 large muffins, didnt bother to use muffin tin liners, just buttered up the pan.  Had them in the oven for close to 20 and they were darkened around the edges, so could have used a couple of minutes less...keep your eyes on them in the oven!  These were a crowd hit and would absolutely make them again! Kudos to Patty!

Awesome muffins! So sweet! I didn't change a thing, and got told by many family members that they were the best muffins ever. Be careful with cooking time-they only took my oven 20 minutes to bake.

Absolutely delicious!  Exactly what I have been looking for!  I didn't have a muffin tray, so I baked it in a 9x9" glass pan, for about 40 minutes.  It is deliciously sweet and perfectly moist.  My only recipe for cornbread/muffins from now own! :)

very good and not really crumby like most corn bread recipes.  My kids loved them.  They are very sweet.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and will probably cut it down event further next time.  but my kids loved them.  recipe makes a lot.  Was able to make 24 regular sized muffins + 11 mini muffins.

I really liked these corn muffins.  I used the 1 cup of sugar and made 14 muffins.  I used a tin that was not non stick so I really had to grease the pan and still they were hard to remove.  But these are really good corn muffins.

Great basic cornbread recipe. Nothing over the top. I'll definitely make them again, but they're more of an at home with the fam dish. Not so much a whip them up to impress guests at a dinner party type of deal.

These sweet, fluffy muffins are just what I was seeking in a morning treat. They are light and cake-y, sweet enough for the kids without being too sugary, and have a not-too-dry, not-too-moist consistency. Goldilocks would call these "just right." I substituted canola oil for the shortening, but that was the only change I made. So quick and easy, I could even whip these up on a busy weekday morning. I rarely give 5 stars, but if you knew how long I was searching for these model muffins, you'd understand my enthusiasm!

I loved these!  I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and used vegetable oil but thought they were great.  I was looking for a sweet corn muffin to eat on it's own for breakfast, so even if they'd been even sweeter I think I'd have still liked them.  If your looking for a corn muffin recipe to go with something like chili, I'd say look elsewhere.

My family LOVED these muffins!  They have never liked any of the other recipes I have used, but these were a hit.  Thank you!  I used canola oil as suggested, and I added cut up hot dogs in a couple for my corn dog loving picky eater --- she ate 2 of them!  Thank you again, and I highly recommend this recipe.

This was a really nice corn muffin. The only comment I have is that the stated sugar amount was a little bit too much for me, so I reduced it and they still came out yummy!!

My kids liked it but it was too sweet for me and I didn't use as much sugar. We did 1/2 of sugar and 1/4 of honey. Next time I think I'll do 1/2 a cup of honey and stop.

I absolutely love these muffins.  I made a few changes as others have suggested...I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and cup the sugar in half and added another 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  These turned out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  My family has asked me to bake these again and again.

I am a fan of sweet corn bread. I dislike the dry version with no flavor. These were perfect! My two young daughters gobbled them up, the adults liked them as well. Made them exactly as the recipe said and served them with honey butter. Definetly a keeper.

Easy, moist, and nicely sweet.  I added the grated zest of 1 lemon and 2 tsp. vanilla extract for flavor.  I used canola oil in place of the shortening, and I beat together all of the wet ingredients (the full cup of milk) and added them to the dry, as you would with most other muffin recipes.  Came out perfectly.

I made this recipe in the form of a loaf, the only change I had to make was the time. If you want a loaf, add 10 minutes. It was sweet and moist, yet firm, and super easy to make. My friend commented though, that it had a little to much sugar, and I agreed with her. It could have been a little more savory. But, yesterday, there were no leftovers,(it was delicious!!) so I am making more today!

SO GOOD!  These are fantastic!  Moist and soft, not dry and clumpy.  I'm a realtor and made them as mini muffins to give out at an open house.  12 minutes was perfect for them.  I had plenty of leftovers and brought them to a play-date and the 5 year-old boys liked them too!  Awesome, this one is a keeper!

Added 1cup frozen berries (mix of blue and cranberry). Perfect blend of sweet muffin with tart cranberries. Made 8 large muffins, baked 35 minutes. Used Splenda instead of sugar. Yum!

These were delicious! I used butter instead of shortening, they were moist and just perfect in every way....I have been searching for a cake-like corn muffin for sometime and these are great! I didn'think they were too sweet with 1 cup of sugar...but that's personal preference! I took them to a dinner party and the muffins were raved about! There were 6 of us, and The other 2 couples were fighting over ther leftovers!

I've made these regularly since finding this recipe, and I love them!  Recently decided to stir in some dried cranberries at the end, and they are simply scrumptious!  Thanks for sharing!

      2014
I made these with Splenda, cut to about 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup dried cranberries. Made them as mini muffins with a little Splenda sprinkle on top for a pot-luck breakfast.and they were gone in a flash! Everyone loved them. Heated for a few seconds in the microwave, they are my personal favourite for breakfast.

Subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and only used 1/2 cup sugar and they were still pleasantly moist and sweet.

Didn't have shortening, so I used vegetable oil. They were still very good! They were moist and sweet!

Best corn muffin ever.  I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening, and while they didn't get a niceraised head, they were still light, fluffy and flavorful.

These were pretty good, but not quite cornmealy enough for me - I'm a big fan of Jiffy corn muffins for the taste and these were a bit different, lighter and sweeter. Overall, not bad. They lasted about 3 days on my counter covered up before they got too "wet". 

For the person who said they stick to the tin liners, consider using silicone baking cups and spray them with a little oil. No sticking here!

I loved these! I don't eat eggs, so I substituted with applesauce (1 tbsp. per egg). I forgot to reduce the sugar, though, so it was a little sweet. But that was my fault since I had applesauce in it. Next time, I'll reduce the sugar. Overall, these were light, fluffy, and perfect! Love 'em.

These were super easy to make.  The only change I made was using melted butter instead of the shortening.  They were light, moist and sweet - went very well with the chili I made for dinner. This recipe is a keeper!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  As others have said I would definitely cut the vinegar and add Worcestershire.  I cut it in 1/2 and the vinegar flavor was still really strong.

These taste great! I used 3/4 cups sugar and butter instead of shortening. They're quite crumbly, but still very yummy. My dad said they were the best cornbread muffins he'd ever tasted!

This is a great recipe. I had to find a from scratch cornbread recipe because I was out of Jiffy Mix -- my kids don't usually like from scratch cornbread. They loved these. However, I did fine chop some cauliflower (have to sneak it in) to add along with corn kernels and cheese. YUM!

I gave this recipe five stars. I followed the recipe exactly. The muffins came out great. The whole family loved them. The muffins are sweet and moist. I wish the muffins were just a little more moist. I think next time I will swap the milk for yogurt.

I used one cup gluten free flour, 1 cup cornmeal, 1 tsp xanthum gum, and one more tsp of baking powder. Only used 1/2 cup of honey because we are not used to as much sweet. Chia seeds replaced the eggs and coconut milk (we have lots of allergies in this house). Made a very nice breakfast addition. Will be making this again!

Great recipe, not as moist as I would have liked but then again I only made half a batch. They were still awesome!

I made one small modification - I added 1 1/2 Tbsp of finely diced jalepeno peppers (3 Tbsp for full batch) and made Jalepeno corn muffins. They were so good! I highly recommend trying it, its a good balance between sweet and mildly spicy.

We LOVE these! I don't think they are at all too sweet. But I tend to like my corn muffins overly sweet anyways. I made these twice in one week, because we went through them so quickly the first time. Best corn muffins I've made thus far.

It is delicious! I changed the recipe so there was only 3/4 cup of sugar.  Even an extremely picky eater in my family asked for seconds.  My grandmother even made a point of stopping buying Shop-rite corn muffins because these were so good.  I have made them twice, and they are a big hit with my family.  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I'm a corn muffin fanatic  (and as such, am very picky about them!) and I must say these came out DELICIOUS! Like alot of the other reviewers, I also used 3/4 cup sugar and not the whole cup. But really..so moist and melt in your mouth!

The flavor was really good, but mine came out dry for some reason. Maybe I will add more milk next time.

I was looking for a nice sweet corn muffin, and I found it!  Thank you.  Will not change a thing.  It did make 12 large and 6 small.

Sweet and easy!  Thanks so much! I didn't have shortening so I substituted butter - I softened it first and it worked great. I have a sweet tooth, but I took another reviewer's advice to reduce the sugar (I used 3/4 cup). Still very sweet and I can imagine a full cup would have been waaaaay sweet. Thanks Patty for a great easy muffin recipe!

Easy and delicious, lightly sweet muffin!  I used butter instead of shortening, but otherwise baked as directed.  My half batch easily made 7 muffins - after tasting I wish I'd made the whole batch!

I discovered at the last minute that I was out of cornmeal, but I had masa flour so I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup masa. They came out deliciously light and sweet. The family gobbled them up - I'll make these often, with these changes.

Absolutely delicious!  Very moist, not crumbly.  Made as original recipe, will probably drop the sugar a little next time to 3/4C.

Excellent corn muffins for breakfast.  These were much less crumbly than my old recipe.  I did follow other people's suggestions of using 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup canola oil instead of shortening.  After adding all the milk, the batter seemed a little thin, possibly because of these changes.  They still came out wonderfully, but I may try the original recipe next time (though oil is so much easier than cutting in shortening).  Also, I only needed to cook them 20 minutes in my stoneware pan.  Normally stoneware takes longer, so keep an eye on the muffins.

This is the best moist & sweet recipe for corn muffins for me so far.  I really like it!  I've been searching for a longtime for a moist & sweet recipe for corn muffins because in the past, the corn muffins I've baked were all lacking in sweetness & quite dry.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

My whole family loves these. I live in a high altitude area and sometimes they need to be cooked longer. They go great with bean soups and stews. I also use butter flavored shortening. my picky kids love these.

These were really tasty muffins. I only used half the amount of sugar and thought that was perfect. I also worried about the shortening but I mixed it up in the kitchen aid mixer and it worked fine. Simple recipe why buy a boxed mix!

Just delicious.  I love a bit sweeter corn muffin and that's what appealed to me about this recipe.  I was a little thrown by the recipe calling for shortening without melting or crumbling into dry ingredients, but I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect.  I preheated the oven to 400 and let it heat for about 10 min then lowered the heat to 350 just before putting the muffins in.  Then I baked the muffins for 15 min.  I got perfect crispy tops which afterall is the best part!

Just as good as everyone says. I have been searching for a great corn muffin recipe and this is it. Mine didn't rise quite so much and I'm not sure why that is. I got a little over 18 muffins out of the mix.

I'll definitely make these again. they're great for taking along for breakfast w/ my coffee.

Probably the best corn muffins I've ever made.  Perfectly sweet and moist.  I knew once the batter came together it was going to be very moist and cake like.  I pulled them out of the oven at about 20 mins, so I think 25-30 is a bit long, but of course ymmv.

WOW these are good!!  Very fluffy, moist, sweet, just wonderful!!  I prepared these for dinner tonight to go along side "Throw Together Mexican Casserole" also from this sight.  Would also go great with chili!!  Try these, they are the very best homemade corn muffins I've ever tried, and much much better than the boxed variety!!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!!

Us South Africans believe that a good way to end off these muffins is to melt butter and a tablespoon of bovril (beef spread) and pour a teaspoon over each muffin.  Just adds that extra zing to make it even more delicious

These were tasty light muffins -- I would make again.  I might add a little more corn meal and less flour next time to get a bit more "corn" muffin texture.

These were very good - just like I want corn muffins to taste like.  Often they are dry and tasteless, this recipe made them slightly (but not overly) sweet.  Great!  I made them into mini-muffins for pre-school.

This is a simple recipe.  Loved the texture of my muffins.  These will be a regular in my house.

I made these exactly as directed and they were just terrible.  MUCH too sweet to be enjoyed - and the texture was completely off - they were dense and heavy.  Will never make these again!

I have been using this recipe for a few years.  I love sweet cornbread!
