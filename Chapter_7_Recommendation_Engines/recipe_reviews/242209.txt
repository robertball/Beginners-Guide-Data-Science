Halleluja! Finally a wonderful gluten free one-bowl brownie! Not too sweet, not too bitter-a perfect brownie. I made my own almond flour by simply grinding almonds in a blender. My first batch burned on the outside before they were even cooked inside. On batch two I turned down the oven from 350° to 300° and they cooked throughout, perfectly in 30 minutes. I allowed them to cool and they tasted so good with a little powdered sugar dusted on top. I used pine nuts instead of walnuts-it's all I had on me. Definitely use some sort of nuts, they made this even better. Thank you michelle taylor for sharing this recipe!

Delish! The texture is different from a brownie with grain, but they taste wonderful and were very moist. The coconut oil flavor was noticeable, so keep that in mind if you are not a fan of coconut. I used honey because I didn't have agave and they turned out with just the right amount of  sweetness. I added chocolate chips instead of nuts and loved the addition.

These are good; rich and fudgy. I couldn't put my hands on my almond flour so I used toasted hazelnut flour but otherwise followed the recipe except I  reduced the baking temp based on Buckwheat Queen's review. Since mine turned out really well, I would recommend sticking to her method. Using the hazelnut flour, they are reminiscent of Nutella which the son loves.  I will make them again and play with different nut flours, too. It's a great base. I also think they would be good with a handful of chocolate chips sprinkled on top before baking.

I thought these to  be among the best brownies I have ever made and their delightful quality was enhanced by the fact that they called for coconut oil and almond flour, both seemingly more healthy than traditional ingredients.  I had no agave nectar so used an abbreviated amount of brown sugar, only just a bit more than 1/3 cup.  I baked them with a few dark chocolate chips on top, then when I took them out spread the softened chips over the top like frosting.  Oh how delightful they were.  I think they will be the only brownies I ever make!!!!

Loved these! I did make changes per other reviews. I used honey instead of agave. I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder for cake-like texture.  Brownies rose to about 1 1/2 inches. I also cooked my brownies on 300F degrees for 33 minutes. I used refined coconut oil because I don't like  the coconut flavor that unrefined coconut oil has. The flavor is very rich, soooo good!
Also, the texture of these brownies is a bit greasy and very moist. I might try to lower the  amount of coconut oil the next time I bake these.

Made these not expecting much, but OMG were they amazing! I would choose these over brownies made with regular ingredients any day! I also made them in cupcake tins so I wouldn't have to cut anything up. Now if I could just get my husband to stop eating them all =)

Flavor is good, but my brownies are very thin, not as pictured.  Difficult to get out of dish as well, recipe did not indicate greased pan.  Baked in a 8" glass dish.  Should baking powder, soda or salt be added?  Feel like I am missing something.

great recipe! My daughter is on a special diet and can't have dairy, eggs, gluten, sugar, & many more things...I was finally able toile her a dessert!! We used an egg replacement from the health food store. Will definitely make again, delicious and fudgey. Maybe a little too sweet, we may cut back a little on the agave next time! 4.5 stars!!

Loved it. Moist and very brownie like! I chose this recipe for a Teacher I work with who is gluten free and misses out on my baking fun.  I added dried organic cherries (about 3/4 cup) and I doubled the walnuts.  It was a little soft in the middle at 30 minutes cooking, and I would leave it in a few minutes longer in future before pulling it.   I think it came out great,  it was plenty sweet as is!

I was snowed in and had a crazy chocolate craving. All I had to work with at home was cocoa powder and almond flour, so this was perfect! The brownies came out so rich and delicious. I shared some with my neighbor and her son and they loved them too. Such a great recipe!

I've been in and out of low-carb for a while, but last night was off-plan and wanted a sweet treat that my husband could also eat (no wheat or rice, so typical gf-free flours don't work for him). I've had trouble getting almond flour to work in chocolate chip cookies, but this recipe was great. I made a half batch, used butter and white sugar and instead of nuts added some milk-chocolate chips that had been hanging out in the fridge. The texture was great, it was only a little grainy but not unpleasant. I'm hopeful that once I sub out for a low-carb sweetener that I can make these a staple, adding nuts and semi-sweet/dark choc chips. I did add some baking powder, just out of habit. Oh, I recommend the lower temp like others suggested. I used a non-stick loaf pan for my small serving on 300 deg for 25 minutes and they were perfect. And grease the pan, mine stuck.

Enjoyed the outcome of these treats! Made with maple syrup and "enjoy life" chocolate chips instead of agave and walnuts.

With the price of almond flour these days, you really don't want to screw these up! The only changes I made were to add 1 TBSP. of white sugar and 1/2 tsp. of salt. I prepared my 8x8 metal pan by cutting parchment paper for the bottom and greasing it and the sides of the pan thoroughly with coconut oil. Baked at 325 degrees for about 35 min. Cooled for 15 min. in pan before turning out on to a rack. They were AWESOME!!! Very moist, flavourful and chocolatey. Highly recommend (especially with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream topping).

I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan; check them at 20-25 minutes.  They were a little cakey and about 3/4 inch thick so I will try a smaller pan next time.  I used darker cocoa, so I will probably through some frosting on them to sweeten them slightly.  Yummy!

This is the best GF treat ever! It is very easy to make and extremely satisfying. I did not add the walnuts and it was still amazing. I did add extra cocoa powder, though. Delicious! One of my favorites thus far.

These had a deep chocolate flavor and were almost dry. I subbed almond oil for coconut oil and cooked them at 300º for 34 minutes. Next time I will reduce the cooking time.

I substituted agave with brown sugar and coconut oil with butter (because I don't have the 2 required ingredients on hand). It came out really soft! My son loves it.

Made this. Used Lily's stevia sweetened chocolate chips in place of walnuts as I didn't have any. I also doubled the recipe but did not double the agave as my husband bought agave syrup which seemed like it would be too sweet. Turned out just right.

The flavor was good. I tried doubling the batch and cooking in a 9X13 though and I must have overcooked it because it was terribly dry. Since that's not a common problem in other reviews, I think it was an error on my part.

This recipe came out great! It was super chocolaty, not too sweet and was super easy to make with clean healthy ingredients. My 4 year old loves them and loves to help me put it together. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

I am thrilled to have found these to satisfy my sweet tooth while being low glycemic. These are so easy that ANYONE can make them -- even your teen-ager or non-cooking husband. They are delicious and guilt-free being gluten-free and sugar-free. (I don't consider agave to be healthy for me and substituted coconut sugar.)

I would double the recipe as one recipe comes out about 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch thick in an 8x8 pan (still delicious).

Texture and flavour are different from the traditional brownies, but they are deliciously moist and flavourful!  My husband, who has been craving for some of the 'good' stuff while losing weight, was thrilled to have these!  I reduced the cocoa to 4 tbsp and  lowered the temperature to 300 degrees, as suggested in other reviews, and it turned out just right. Would repeat this recipie many times!

Very good healthy brownie. Not a 5 star compared to a ghiradelli boxed brownie or something like that... But these are much healthier! We enjoyed them and I don't feel bad giving them to my kids.
We used maple syrup and then spread Lily's stevia chocolate chips on after they came out of the oven for a really good and easy frosting :)

I made these according to the recipe. The only change I made was using maple syrup instead of the agave nectar which I did not have. These were so bad that I had to toss them in the garbage. For one thing, they weren't sweet at all. And they also were very hard, not chewy or cake like at all.  I went back and checked the recipe,  thinking maybe I left something out but nope, I didn't.

Agave nectar is really high in fructose (high glycemic index [GI]). I substituted with Lakanto (monkfruit/erythritol blend) sweetener instead. This sweetener blend is a really low GI prebiotic substitute that tastes great. Good texture especially when warm. Love that I can have a chocolatey treat without the sugar and the guilt (^.^) . It was OK, didn't trick me into thinking I had something  rich.

I have made these three times now. They are rich, moist and fudgy. I modified the recipe for my Mom, who  is diabetic, and she was delighted. While I got used to it, I did not care for the taste of the agave nectar. For a double batch (which makes them much thicker in a 9x9 pan) I switched out the nectar for 2/3 cup of brown sugar and one and a half teaspoons of Sweetleaf Stevia. They were sensational!

I'm so impressed with these!  They are really good and I was trying not to have high expectations.  I did make some changes based on other reviews.  I substituted honey for the agave (since I didn't have agave), left out the walnuts (didn't have those either), added 1/2 t of baking powder and sprinkled a few chocolate chips in.  I baked it at 300 for 3 minutes and they are great.  Wasn't sure if I would be able to serve them at a party, but I definitely can!!!

Here is my take on a recipe that has received 5 stars by many others.  First, you have to like nuts.  The almond flour and coconut oil are evident from the moment you take the first bite.  So, one of my daughters had a strong negative reaction since she does not like nuts.  
Second, I used brown sugar instead of confectionary sugar.  If anyone has an idea on how to substitute stevia, please share.  I also lowered the temperature by 50 degrees and cooked 30 minutes, max.  You have to monitor because it is easy to get flat brownies using this exact recipe.  Best to make extra.
Finally, I enjoyed this nutty brownie more than I can express.  The walnuts were a great addition.  Next time, I will double the recipe and share with friends.  LOVE IT but I suspect the calorie load is big!

Amazing!! We are brownie lovers and this recipe is perfection. Listened to other reviewers and cooked for 30 min at 300. The result was a fudge brownie more on the gooey side (just the way we like it!). I would definitely make this over regular brownies any day!

I wanted to use up some almond flour so I tried this recipe since the ingredients seem to be healthier than traditional brownie recipes.  It came out a bit flat (about 3/4" tall) but very delicious though a bit sweet for my taste.  Wondering whether  some baking powder or soda would help it rise more?  I followed the recipe except I used pecans instead of walnuts.   The texture was very light and not as dense as using regular flour.  I will probably make it again but will try using baking powder/soda and less agave.

I really liked these brownies! They were easy and tasty!  However, I made them because my husband was told by his doctor today to only eat gluten-free foods. I wanted to show him that he is not missing out by having to go gluten-free. And, he did not like them, and neither did my mother; yes, it was an epic fail in their opinion. I usually eat a clean diet, so maybe that is why they tasted better to me. I am hoping his taste buds adjust.

Great, but I changed a lot here! I substituted agave for a splash of maple syrup. Subbed the oil for melted butter. Subbed the coco powder for 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips (melted in a double boiler). Then added chocolate chips and pecans to the final batter. I was afraid of not getting enough chocolate ?? They tasted great, but next time I'll add more chocolate chips at the end.

Delicious and didn't miss the flour! I used almond meal instead to add a more hearty texture and replaced the coconut oil with olive oil. I also took the advice of a previous reviewer on baking at 300 degrees for about 30 minutes. The brownie is not overly sweet and has a great moist consistency.

This is a great brownie recipe for people who are avoiding dairy and gluten, but aren't pretending to be Paleo: bring on the real sugar!  I took the suggestion to bake for 30 min at 300.  I did mine on convection, in a greased pan, and it came out perfect with a cakey texture.  I imagine a more fudge-like consistency could be obtained with a lower, non-convection temp or shorter cooking time.

My quarrel is with the recipe, which DOES NOT state whether the baking dish should be greased or not.  This is a pretty serious omission for baked goods.

However, the other thing that is very important with this recipe is that the almond flour should be finely ground.  Bob's Red Mill is a good one; the one we bought at Costco not so much.

Delicious lower carb brownie treat.  It was rich and tasty, the coconut oil made it taste like a chocolate haystack from a candy store!  I had to substitute for the agave syrup as I did not have it on hand.  I used Splenda brown sugar and honey for 1/2 the required  portions each.  Could cut the honey down a bit as was a little too sweet.  I used a Le Creuset casserole in lieu of a glass or metal pan (greased with coconut oil) and followed the suggestions to reduce the temp to 325 degree oven.  It was delicious!

I made it exactly as directed. They were okay but not quite what I was looking for. I found the almond flour to be greasy and overall have an unpleasant texture. I did mildly enjoy it when paired with vanilla ice cream but not alone.

So, first of all I will say I made a few changes. I used mostly  maple syrup as the sweetener,  vegetable oil in place of coconut oil, and finely chopped pecans in place of the walnuts. I also baked it for just 25 minutes, because that's when it seemed done. Even though I let the brownies cool for a long time, over half an hour, they came out VERY crumbly. The taste is ok, it is missing salt, and if you like a fudgey brownie this isn't it. They are slightly less crumbly the next day.

Pretty good, not very sweet. I used maple syrup since I did have the other stuff and turned out good, baked a few minutes less than 30 minutes. I also topped with enjoy life chocolate chips. Frosted with non dairy gluten free fudge frosting. Was a big hit! It is very hard to find stuff for my two year old to eat. He is allergic to milk and wheat. Thank you!

Not bad.  I reduced agave nectar by a little bit, and used applesauce instead of coconut oil.  cooked at 300 for 37 minutes.    Needed to use up some almond flour.

Followed the directions with all of the listed ingredients but turned the heat down to 320 degree fahrenheit and placed the mix into 10 cup cake molds instead.
Turned out GOOD! I was super nervous about them tasting yucky and gluten free obvious but they are delicious...if you like almonds. I will definitely make these again!

These were wonderful! I used only  4 TBS of  the cocoa, since it's all I had, and I did add a pinch of salt. There was plenty of chocolate flavor, even with the reduced amount of cocoa. They were moist, and that hint of coconut flavor was lovely! Thanks for a terrific recipe! I will make these very often!

Unfortunately, this recipe fell flat.  The taste and texture were both way off.  After slicing them, they couldn't be picked up without falling apart, despite waiting several hours before slicing.  The taste was overwhelmingly coconut to the extent that it didn't taste like a brownie.  I took this to a cookout and noone there liked it!  The best thing said was "It's edible," with a shrug.
