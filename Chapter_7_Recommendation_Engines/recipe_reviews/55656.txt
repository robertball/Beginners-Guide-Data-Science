This was very good!  The only change I made was to add a mixture of cornstarch & water so it thickened up a little at the end.  My husband loved it, and said it was the best duck he ever had in his life.  I think this will be my new duck recipe...Thank you!!

This was a fantastic meal!  I left the duck breasts whole, cooked them until nearly done and removed them from the sauce while it reduced down to a thick consistency.  I served the breast covered in sauce over the couscous with a ring of mange tout around the plate.  Delicious!
