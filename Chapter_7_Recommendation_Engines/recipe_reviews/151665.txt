This recipe turned out quite tasty. I made a couple of changes though. Instead of 1/3 cup water I filled 1/2 of the soup can with milk. I used cream of mushroom soup since that was all I had on hand, and I added a lot of salt, pepper, & some garlic.
  I made my own pie crust recipe, and instead of 1 crust I made a 2 crust, and used a 8x8 pan. Here is the recipe. 2-2/3 cups flour, 1 t. salt, 1 cup shortening, 7-8 T.water. I always add 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese to my potpie crusts. Mix flour w/ salt, cut in shortening, add water 1T. at a time, form into ball Roll out

Very good overall. When I make it again, I would use less thyme and add more liquid.  I followed the recipe except for using milk instead of water.  The finished pot pie was on the dry side (not much gravy) and had a stronger thyme taste than i liked.

It's an awesome base start.   Filling:  I put 1/2 c. water in a sauce pan and cooked frozen "steamer" veggies package  (corn/peas/beans medley). Drain. Return veggies to the pot. Cut up canned cooked potatoes into bite sizes.  Mix in with the cooked veggies. Season veggies with salt/pepper/onion flakes/.  Add 1 can of CREAM of Mushroom (vs. golden mush) to the pot and heat the soup on low.  Add one 6oz plain yogurt.  Heat and stir. Season the filling to taste. Should like the way the filling tastes all by itself.  Then, one pie crust on bottom of pie ban. Place the cubed beef over the crust. I made a pot roast and cubed it so the beef was delicious.  Pour filling over the beef.    I added shredded cheddar on top of the filling and topped with the other pie crust.  Cut an "+" into the top crust to vent.    Cook til top crust is golden brown.

Made this tonight. It turned out great.  For the beef I used left over beef eye round roast. My top crust had some issues but even thought it looked bad, my husband loved it. On the scale of 1 to 10, he gave it a 12 :)

SO DELICIOUS!!! I never made anything where people actually stopped to say how delicious it was while mmm. I used fresh celery, carrots, and a green onion rather than frozen and meatloaf for cooked meat. This is one of the only American dishes I really like!  YUM!!!!

I simmered the left-over beef in red wine with onions and garlic.  I did not cook the potatoes ahead of time, I used small red potatoes, diced.  It turned out really well.

I used a can of garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden cream of mushroom soup and I cut up fresh carrots, potatoes, onions and mushrooms instead of using frozen vegetables.  Delicious!

I made this tonight and I call can say was "eh."  Lots of leftovers.   I followed the recipe and made one exception, I used crescent rolls instead of pie crust.   Adding pepper and garlic powder once it was served did help, but my husband doused it with cheese.   I'm pretty sure I won't make this again.

I made this recipe with elk top sirloin. I changed the sauce a bit because we didnt have the mushroom soup. I did a sauce of beef broth, red wine, worchestershire sauce and some flour. It was absolutely amazing!!

This was excellent!  I love how adaptable this is.  I was out of potatoes and so substituted rice.  I used lean ground beef, and when I browned that, I sauteed onions and garlic.  I did add more liquid to make a gravy consistency (used beef broth).  It didn't occur to me to add mushrooms, but I might do that next time.  This recipe is a perfect base that can be seasoned to taste - although I thought the thyme was delicious - and it could be made with beef, chicken, sausage, and pretty much any veggies!  I will definitely make this again.

A great basic but in need of spices and extra flavor since I had no thyme. I made my own pastry pie crust and to that added one generous teaspoon of basil and a few shakes of onion powder. To the mix added salt, pepper, roasted garlic and dried tomatoes. I also added 1/2 can of milk instead of water. I really liked the Worcestershire sauce in the soup, nice flavor.  Thanks for the post!

Good! I made it with leftover new york strip roast, which is pretty fancy but it's tender and worked really well. I agree with other reviewers about the thyme being a bit overpowering. I think that if you use regular cream of mushroom soup, you don't need the thyme. It's earthy enough. There are only 2 of us, so we always have leftover roasts and this is a great way to use it the next day!

My husband and kids absolutely loved this; the only things I did differently was the seasoning, I added powdered onion, powdered garlic, seasoning salt, and pepper. While the beef was cooking I added one of those packets of beef stew seasoning, and instead of using cream of mushroom, I used cream of celery because my husband absolutely hates mushrooms. And made my own crust... Absolutely delicious!!

I made several mods to this recipe--like many others I found it to have too little liquid and too much thyme.  I doubled the soup, beef broth (instead of water) and Worcestershire sauce but kept the thyme at one teaspoon.  It still had a nice thyme flavor but had much more gravy. I also used Potatoes O'Brien instead of plain potatoes, which gave it a little more color and flavor.  I used about 2 cups ground beef cooked in red wine with diced mushrooms, garlic and onion (3T wine, 3 mushrooms, 1 clove garlic and 3T minced onion for ~1.5lbs of ground beef).   I simply mixed all of the ingredients together and it filled a standard pie pan with some left over.  Easy and delicious.

Very easy to make and tasty! I used Bisquik mix biscuit recipe for the crust instead of pastry, since I had it on hand. The whole family, including my picky 9 year old, devoured it!

Excellent basic potpie recipe! Mine took closer to 45 minutes to cook and the veggies were still a little crisp, but we liked that extra texture. Would definitely make again!

My wife used our leftover pot roast from last night as it already had the potatos, carrots, mushrooms, peas and of course beef and gravey. She just chopped up the veggies a little smaller, dumped it all in the pie crust and baked. Yum, Great!

This is a great way to use up leftover pot roast.  I saved the gravy from my pot roast so the pot pie was had plenty of liquid.  I used cream of mushroom soup but added beef broth instead of water.  I forgot to add the Worcestershire but didn't really need it because I had plenty of flavor from my pot roast gravy.  If you make this recipe, I strongly recommend that you save some of the leftover gravy from the roast and mix it into the pie.

Very good and tasty. I used fresh organic carrots,onions,frozen peas and potatoes. Instead of 1/3 cup of water I used beef broth. I seasoned my meat with some spice, salt,pepper and parsley flakes. I use 1/4 cup of dry sherry in my meat. I omitted the thyme my husband does not like it. Sometimes pot pies can be boring but this was very good.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was wonderful with left over beef roast.  I added some garlic, salt and pepper, used cream of mushroom soup and made two as I had plenty of meat.  I put one in the freezer.  It was delicious, my family all loved it.
