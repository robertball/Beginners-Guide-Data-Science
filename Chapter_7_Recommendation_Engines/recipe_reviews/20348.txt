well....this recipe took a long time to make and in the end my 3 kids wouldn't even touch it. I tried it and it just tasted like sauteed leek and i only used one. My advice would be to not make this. Sorry

I liked this recipe!  It was easy to make although I made a few changes.  I only used one leek and I had to use 3 eggs to make the ingredients stick together.  It was difficult to roll the mix into sausage shapes, so instead I made patties.  I would make this recipe again!

Just made these, love the taste. Smell amazing! Had to make patties because I couldnt roll them into sausages. I should have added another egg or two, but didnt. Tried to stick with the original recipe. But even as patties they are crumbly. Not sure what I did wrong. But the taste is really lovely and will definately make them again, will just have to work on the consistency.

Modified due to time and lack of ingredients but flavor very good.   Did not have oats so did not use them.  Used whole wheat bread to make the fresh bread crumbs.  Then decided due to lack of time to just use as a side-dish similar to stuffing/dressing so did not add egg.   Big hit with the family.
