Okay, YUGE caveat...I made this with a pork tenderloin. I thought I had chicken. I didn't have chicken. That said, put everything in the dish as listed, but I lowered the roasting temp to 275 (250 convection) and put it in at 3 pm so it would be done for the famn damily at six. (I was teaching a class)
There wasn't a bite left when I returned home at 8. Not a lick, not a potato, not a sliver of tenderloin. Devoured.
I'll be making this again both with the pork and with the chicken.

We liked this! I used a mixture of mini colored potatoes (yellow, red & purple), because that's what I had on hand. Ran them through my food processor with the slicing blade, which worked perfectly for 1/4" slices. The cooking time needed was way more than 30 minutes, so others need to consider this when planning their meal. Ours took about 75 minutes (2 large split breasts, bone-in, skin on) to get to an internal temp of 165. I had planned on 1 hour, so 15 minutes more was not a big deal. I did add some salt and pepper to the parsley/garlic mixture, which was a good call.

This was tasty but the bake time was off. I had to bake an additional 20 minutes. I also had to add more oil to the potatoes and onions halfway thru baking because they were getting dried out. The garlic -parsley paste is super good.   We only used 1T vinegar because we have a guy who has a vinegar aversion. :)   We added 3 carrots we had to use up,  cut into hunks. Will make again.

I used skinless chicken breasts and golden potatoes and baked it in a glass dish and covered it with foil. It took about 50 min for the chicken to cook at 375 and then an additional 20 min for the potatoes to cook. (I removed the chicken once it was done).

This was delicious. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I  loved it. Even the red onions and potatoes were yummy. It took 45 minutes in the oven to get the chicken to 165 degrees.

This was excellent! I used 6 red potatoes and sliced them 1/4 inch using my slicer. I also used a whole young chicken and split it in half. I added carrots, celery, and mushrooms on top of the chicken with the sliced red onions. I did add extra balsamic, 1/2 cup. At the end I scooped out the veggies and put the broiler on high to get the chicken crispy, took it out and did the same with the potatoes occasionally mixing them. The whole family loved it even my picky little eaters.

I followed the instructions step by step and the meat and potatoes are undercooked. I didn’t like the results. Not gonna make it again.

I love this! I did make a few  changes. I don't like vinegar so I didn't use any. I had boneless and skinless chicken thighs so I used those since I already had them. I also added a couple stalks of celery when I added the onions. I covered my 13x 9 glass pan with foil. My dish took 1 hour and 20 minutes. Everything was done and tender and not overcooked. I love this. I'm going to make it again in the future.

Used foil to keep moist and faster cooking.
I only had legs...Made the recipe as listed otherwise.
When cooking chicken breast or chops, I always been told to manually tenderize the meat since it is a muscle, and needs to be broken down and flattened ...
This reduces cooking time and meat is very tender...Covering with foil keep juices in.

Easy and tasty.  It needs to cook longer than the recipe states--at least it did in my oven.  I cooked it for 60 + minutes.

I did not adjust any of the ingredients but based on other reviews I did add additional balsamic and garlic. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise. My dh likened it to something he would get out in the field when he was in the Army. The potatoes were undercooked even though I sliced them razor thin. The chicken was over cooked and the onion overpowering. The best part of the dinner was the garlic bread we had on the side. Not sure there is anything that could be done to help this recipe.

Lacked flavor. Should have marinated chicken in seasonings and balsamic vinegar prior to baking. Potatoes did not cook all the way despite being in the oven for an extra 20 minutes since chicken needed extra cooking time. Will not be making again.

This was pretty good.  I made it in an 11 inch cast iron pan.  It took about an hour for the chicken to reach 165 degrees.  I loved the flavor of the vegetables.  I found the chicken to be perfectly cooked but lacked flavor past the skin.  But I just cut it up and had bites of it mixed with the vegetables.  I put it under the broiler on high heat for about a minute before removing from oven.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will make again as my husband loved it - he gave it 5 stars!

I made this tonight and followed the recipe to the letter. Very good, great flavor and simple to put together. I cooked it at 375 for an hour and it was just perfect. Next time I'll spend a little more time and slice the potatoes thinner
