I haven't tried this recipe but I am from Pittsburgh and grew up eating these sandwiches. They are the best sandwich you will ever eat. The coleslaw in this recipe is all wrong. As another user wrote, Primanti's doesn't use mayo or milk in their recipe. I have made these sandwiches at home a bunch of times and found a coleslaw recipe on this site that tastes pretty much exactly like they use in the restaurant. The recipe is called Amish Slaw. Also, capicola isn't the only meat you can use...they have a wide variety of choices at the restaurant from cheesesteak, roast beef, turkey, cajun chicken, pastrami, egg and cheese, fish...basically whatever you can imagine. Also throw some french fries on your next salad and you got a Pittsburgh salad!

I'm only giving this recipe 3 stars because, while it may be able to stand on its own merits, it's certainly not in the style of Primanti Brothers. The coleslaw is, unfortunately, all wrong, and in this case, it is the coleslaw which is unique to PB. They do not use mayo or milk in their coleslaw, which gives it its unique taste and texture. Also, I believe the olive oil has much too strong a taste to use for the fries. That being said, it's still a good recipe, even though I'd never add milk in any coleslaw.

This was delicious, but I have to agree w/ the other reviewer's that said the slaw was all wrong...Primanti's does use a vinegar based slaw, not mayo based. This was still very good, and everyone really enjoyed them for dinner tonight. I would def make these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
