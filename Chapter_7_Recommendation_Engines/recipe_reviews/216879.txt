Perfect!  I too, had the ultimate Lebabese cook, my uncle Tofee who made these from scratch.  This filling is identical to his.  I have cheated over the years and used GRANDS! biscuits, separated each one horzintally, and pressed into a muffin tin.  I then scoop 1/4 c. of the mixture in to each and bake acc't to buscuit label.  I LOVE to idea of puff pastry.  Nice variation.

Wow, were these delicious!  I accidentally bought the wrong frozen puff pastry - the shells - but they actually worked just fine.  We just had 6 of them along with our dinner and some of the meat mixture left over.  I can't wait to make this again.

Mixture sounds about what I remember but Sitoo's was heavier on the lamb.  
..Size of rounds to form the traditional triangle shape shown?  I'm no good at geometry :(
..Have you tried scratch dough?  Would like to get hold of that recipe :)

Very good, however, did you omit oil to saute the meat and onions? Also added some red pepper to the mix. Very nice recipe. Husband loved them.

Yummy little packages bursting with flavor! The combination of lamb and beef brought a really nice depth of flavor to the dish. I went a little heavier on the lamb since my meat from my CSA was already weighed out at 1lb. I made the pies with phyllo dough since that's what I had on hand, and just doubled the layers to get a sturdier outside. I served with Leshta (http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63425078/leshta-bulgarian-lentil-soup/detail.aspx) and yogurt on the side. My husband loved the dish and we will definitely be making these again.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!  The meat tasted exactly like the meat from my favorite Lebanese bakery.  I could only find ground lamb frozen in 1lb package, so I used the full pound with 1 pound of ground beef.  I added a little bit of garlic and some ground allspice. I had to substitute lime juice for lemon, but it didn't seem to matter.   My pastry work needs some practice, but I can't wait to make these again!

First, I made it exactly as written.  It was delicious!  Then I made a second batch exactly as written but added garlic powder. Dusted flour on working counter and cut the pastry sheet into 4 squares.   Put the fillings on top, keeping about half inch space around the rim. Cover the pies with the top pastry sheet with 4 slits.  Used a fork to press the edges, then brushed top of the pastry with egg so it will turn nice golden brown when baked.  My husband loved it!  Thank you so much for this great recipe!!!

This was pretty good. I'm used to having these in regular bread dough and in a the shape of a wrapped burger but this was a nice quick alternate. I didn't put in the pine nuts and used about one larger lemon. We always dip in ketchup while eating them and call these Fatires. Hubby and I liked but kids weren't a fan although they really enjoyed helping make them :)

Sfeeha are my favorite meat pies. In Cleveland, OH, there was a restaurant called "The Middle East," their recipe was slightly different. At The Middle East the meat pies had a bread dough pastry much like Jiddo's Fatayer Sabanegh (Spinach Triangles) and the flakey crust was reserved for the stuffed spinach pastries. I feel this is more suitable for something with a meat filling. If you do not get the pastry dough follow Jiddo's Fatayer Sabanegh (Spinach Triangles) dough recipe. I also reverse the ratio of meat. I prefer a pound of lamb and a half a pound of beef.

This was a huge hit at our family gathering.  Unfortunately some ate too much & didn't save enough room for dinner! The only things I changed were I used a little less lemon juice, more cinnamon, and added a little sugar and coriander to taste.  They were so flavorful, they didn't last long!

We really love this. I've had to start using gluten free puff pastry, but that's fine. It's still tasty.

used mostly lamb meat cause that's how the package was sold, used Sazon instead of pepper & salt. Couldn't use the cinnamon cause of food allergy but mostly it tasted very good. Ingredients were extremely expensive-$15.

I made it just as in the recipe, oh except for pine nuts - I'm allergic.  My wife loves meat pies, she loved this but suggested I add some spice, like curry powder.
