Terrible recipe as listed!  I attempted to make this when I was limited with time, and it took way more time than needed because I had to run to the store for additional ingredients because THE PROPORTIONS ARE WRONG!!  First of all, unless you're baking a 35" pie, ignore the Cool Whip content.  Mixing Cool Whip with all that sugar (way too much which made it gritty and super sweet) and the cream cheese muffled the flavors of the other ingredients.  I also needed approx. 3/4 of a can of Blueberry Pie Filling vs. the listed recommendation of 1/2 can.  I altered the recipe as follows, and it turned out okay:

1 1/2 bananas, NOT 3 (3 would fill the entire pie shell!)

3 oz. cream cheese, softened

2/3 cup powdered sugar (mixes better than granulated sugar)

1 cup Cool Whip or whipped cream (a BIG difference from the recommended 12 oz. container!)

3/4 can of blueberry pie filling

9" shortbread pie shell

I hope these suggestions make a better pie for any viewers of this review.  I turned out to be very tasty, but the original recipe will not result in a doable pie.

I commented on this recipe before stating that I thought the ingredients should yield two pies.  I made the recipe tonight and my suspicions were correct...here are the adjustments that I recommend.  1) You will need two 9 inch deep-dish pie crusts.  2) You will use the entire can of blueberry pie filling (half on each pie).  3) You will still use 3 bananas (one and half bananas sliced on each pie crust).  I followed the rest of the recipe as written and it turned out fine.  I didn't have a problem with the granulated sugar as the other reviewer mentioned...if you cream the cream cheese and sugar with a hand mixer it will combine well.  With all of this being said...I thought the pie tasted pretty good.  Not out of this world, but good.  It was very easy to make, it set up well in the refrigerator and the filling didn't run everywhere like many no bake pies.  If I make it again, I might try to add more cream cheese to give the filling a little more tanginess like a cheesecake and maybe use a shortbread or graham cracker crust.

I love this pie! I made it once for family following the directions to the tee. Then I made it for some friends and changed a few things. I used a ready made graham cracker crust and I put apple pie filling on the top instead of blueberry. It tasted great and everyone enjoyed it but I still think it was better with the blueberries. This recipe is probably good with many variations on fruit.

I absolutely LOVE this pie! I used a shortbread pie shell, 1 1/2 bananas (thought 3 was too much), and 1 whole 21 ounce can blueberry pie filling. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was fantastic and everyone loved it! I have been asked to make it for other people and plan on making another one for myself! Thanks for this great recipe!

I took the advice of the previous reviewer, I used two deep dish graham cracker crusts, used 8oz of cream cheese and just shy of 3/4 cp of sugar. (It was a 1/2 cup and a little bit more). It really turned out to be a nice pie. I think you can use strawberry or blackberry pie filling as well.

I made this yesterday and added my picture to page. I used one store bought 9 inch graham cracker crust. I also used 6 ounces of cream cheese instead of the 4 oz it called for. However, I still mixed with it with a 1/2 cup of sugar.  I blended the mixture with  8 oz of whipped cream instead of 12. I then lined the bottom of the pie with 1.5 bananas sliced. I felt 3 bananas were too many. After adding cream cheese and whipped topping mixture to the pie I used a whole can of blueberry pie filling for the top. Turned out excellent.

This pie is GREAT! Everyone loves the combonation of bananas & blueberries. I get 2 pies out of this. I used 8oz of cream cheese, and 2 of the 2 extra servings graham cracker pie crust instead, but used the same amount of sugar. The sugar mixes fine, with a hand mixer. 1 1/2 bananas for each pie. There is nothing wrong with this pie. After making this, I don't really understand some of the earlier reviews. I make it for get togethers, & holidays, it's a big hit! My husband's father expects a pie of his own. One of my cousins sounded like she was having a big "O", when she was eating it. Thank You for sharing this.

I'm giving this four stars because my family and guests said they liked it.  I personally didn't care for it, but I've never been a huge fan of canned pie filling anyway, so that's what did it for me.  According to everyone else though, it was good.  I did read the previous reviews and opted to use a store bought graham crust.  I'll make this again because my family enjoyed it.  Thanks.

Yes, this recipe will make two deep dish pies. It was good but next time I'll probably just make a cheesecake with blueberries on top.

I used a pre-made graham crust so this was very easy and it turned out pretty well.  I suspect I'll make it again.

Ok, I submitted my last review too early. Not finished... Anyhoo... 16yo has Celiac so we are a gluten free house. I used a pre made GF pie crust. 3 bananas is too much. I used one.  Too much Cool Whip, other than that, great recipe. I couldn't find blueberry filling at the store so I used canned blueberry. the 16yo and 7yo old loved it! As did their 40yo mama. :-)
