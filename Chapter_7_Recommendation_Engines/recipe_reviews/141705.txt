I really enjoyed the concept of this recipe.  I started out following the instructions 100%, but as time passed and the flavors began to meld, I updated it a bit.  That's not to detract anything from the original recipe, it's just catering to our personal tastes.  I doubled the recipe (3 lb pork butt) - it was very easy to dice the roast into smaller chunks by throwing into the freezer for a couple hours prior.  After doubling all the other ingredients I found it a bit bland so I *again* doubled the amount of spices (so 1/2 cup chili powder, etc).  Then I realized it was the perfect soup/stew to clean out the veggie drawer!  In went chopped carrots, my leftover lone zucchini, a couple stalks of celery.  About a half hour before it was done I threw in what was left in the orzo box - probably a cup or so.  I tell you what, I challenge you to find a more hearty meal than that.  So while I did stray from the exact recipe a little, we found something that is sure to be a family favorite for years to come!  Fantastic base recipe (the meat is to die for) that is wonderful to cater to your family's taste buds.  Sorry for the long-winded review.  ;)

I don't think it gets any easier than this.  Full of great flavor!  The heat level is just right, too.  It has some punch but doesn't overpower the flavor of the meal.  I served it with brown rice, whole wheat tortillas, and sour cream.  My husband went back for thirds.

The entire family really liked this recipe! The only thing I would do different next time is slow cook the pork then shread it, that's just a matter of preferance. Not too hot, not too mild, served it with Trader Joes brand spanish rice (the best!) and tortillas. Yum!

I used a leftover pork roast, which worked beautifully. My son went back for seconds saying, "Man, this chili is good." I like mine with a bit more fire, so next time I may add a pinch of cayenne. I think it could use a little more garlic, too. I served it over rice, with pinto beans, then the chili on top. A great way to use left over pork!

Though I used cubed stew beef instead of the pork (I don't like pork), we all enjoyed this chili.  I'll definitely keep this in my recipe box to make again.  Thanks!

This was very good.  I used pork country stips because that was the only meat I had, and it turned out very tender.

Very easy, and good flavor.  I made the mistake of adding a bit more water due to other reveiw stating not enough sauce, well mine was too thin.  Had to thicken at the end but still turned out good.  My husband said would like better if thicker too.  Next time will stick to the origianl amount.  Think will add some fresh garlic.

This is a very good tasting chili! I added a can of pinto beans and a can of chopped tomatoes, in order to make it more of a complete meal. I also cooked it in a slow cooker, after first browning the pork in a Dutch oven. I served it over corn chips, and topped it with Mexican cheese.

After 3 hours of cooking this was still too soupy for me. So I added 1/2 a pound of cooked pinto beans and cooked for 2 more hours.  I also had to double the spice and add a pinch of cayenne to give this the flavor I wanted.

Delicious! Used Costco's "Fried Pork" found in their deli section. Already cooked and ready to use. Shredded it and sauted with the Colorado sauce. Done in 20 minutes! Served w/salad and rice.

I followed this recipe completely. It was scrumptious! I didn't deviate at all and it was perfect. Not everyone can do HOT so I added hot sauce to my own which added an extra kick but it was delicious without also.

I followed the recipe exactly since it was my first time making it but I had to triple it for my family! My husband absolutely loved it, it's his favorite when we eat out! Very good, I even passed it on to some friends!

Great recipe! I used beef stew meat, a can of bush chili starter beans (medium), and then I added a pound of ground beef cuz the sauce was a little runny. It was great, I'm gonna try it with chicken next time.

Very Good!  I did change a couple things but not much.  Instead of 3 cups of water I did 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth.  I didn't have to add much salt after that.  I added some Tapitia Hot sauce to add a little Spice.  Excellant will cook again.

I changed the recipe some. I added kidney beans, extra pork, and extra tomato sauce. Only added one cup water, since I added the juice from beans. Served over rice. Husbands loves it!

This recipe was Awesome!!!   I added a chopped Anaheim & Jalapeno pepper...And used 3 cloves of chopped garlic, instead of the garlic powder.  This gave it a nice kick, without over powering heat!  2 tablespoons of chicken boullion  made it rich & tasty also... After browning the pork over the stove, I put it in my slow cooker.   4 hours later, CHILI NIRVANA!!!!!!!

This doesn't resemble any chili that I've had here in Colorado, but it was still pretty good. I fiddled around with the seasonings a little, and probably should have added a can of pinto beans. Served it over brown rice. Not bad at all. Thanks, Ron!

First time to ever use pork in chili and it was amazingly good. I had to adjust a couple of things based on my hubbies taste buds, as he won't eat cooked onions and likes beans and hot spices in his chili. Other than that everything else was the same. Very easy and very good.

Good flavor but too watery.  I used beef and the crock pot.  I tried  to thicken it up with water and corn starch but still wasn't thick enough for me.  I added two cans of drained and rinsed kidney beans. I will give it another try.

Pretty great. I used cubed goat meat, will probably try cooking in the slow cooker next time. I imagine this would work well with any red meat. It's a keeper!

This was really good.  It was pretty thick though and may have needed more water and some beans in the chili would have been better.  But, the flavor was really good and not too hot at all.  I'm not too crazy about hot and spicy stuff, but this wasn't too hot for me.  My son wouldn't try it though.  He's picky and if it even looks spicy he won't even try it.  Even mentioning the word chili makes him not try it.  My husband said it would have been great in a burrito.

This recipe needs more ingredients.  I served it as is over rice and it was something different to do with pork, but it really wasn't chili.

I thought this was delicious!  I did alter by making it with stew beef because that's what I had on hand, and we don't like the smokiness of bacon so left that out.  Otherwise, this was delicious.  I made it with a spanish rice from allrecipes, and served with toasted corn tortillas.  Delicious!

This was a great chili recipe. It even received rave reviews from my very picky husband! I used country style pork ribs. I didn't have an onion, so I did without. I also used a few cloves of fresh garlic rather than garlic powder, and added a can of kidney beans. I will definitely be making this again.

In all honesty I cannot give this 5 stars because I changed it a bit to fit my time constraints and personal tastes.  First, I doubled the recipe.  I slow cooked it for 6 hours on low because it seemed to be possible with this recipe and I didn't have time to stand around my house to simmer it on the stove.  I did not brown the meat and just tossed and coated it with 6 tablespoons of flour.  I prefer Chili Colorado made with beef, so I used beef stew meat.  I used an whole small onion and added a pinch of fresh garlic.  Since I cooked it with my slow cooker I just used 4 cups of water instead of 6, even though I doubled the recipe because slow cookers have a tendency to make things soupy.  I doubled all the seasonings according to the measurements provided and added about 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne for a little more heat.  Turned out absolutely wonderful!  Served it with homemade spanish rice and chile pepper tamales. Thanks for this great recipe!!! :)

Good. Most chili I make has a big tomato base, so this was different (a GOOD different). I didn't have pork, but I used beef stew meat. This had a smooth beef flavor. The texture was much too runny for what I prefer, so I thickened it and added red beans in the pot. I'll make it again.

This was a fantastic recipie, and I come from a long line of Mexican cooks.  The only adjustment I made was that I blended together some ground pasilla chili  with the mild california chili for a darker richer flavor.  Thank you!

This recipe is awesome! Easy to make and has a lot of flavor. My only tweak was to add cayenne pepper and the bacon (from getting the bacon fat to cook the pork in). Served this was Spanish rice and it was a hit. My girlfriend raves about it (and have a double batch simmering on the stove as I write this). Great recipe.

This recipe is straight and to the point, yet very effective!  It was my first time making chili and it came out exactly how I wanted it to.  I followed the recipe as is except I used stew beef instead.  I cut those up into smaller pieces and found it wasn't as thick as I wanted it, so I also threw in some ground beef into the initial cooking of the meat.  After I added everything else it was too thin for what I was looking for so I took leftover meat from the pasta sauce we had the other night and broke it up and threw it in there, making it just perfect.  I threw in an assortment of spices, such as cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper, chipotle pepper, and even some paprika and Worcestershire sauce and it came out spicy yet very flavorful.  Would recommend this to anyone who likes a great chili!

One of the Best Chili Colorado recipes we have found.  Pork or Beef can be used.  I have used both. The key ingredient is chili powder so the higher the quality the better the taste.  We make this as written except we prefer some fresh garlic sautéed with the onions. which I saute in the bacon fat or olive oil prior to cooking the meat.  I just remove them from the pan and add back in later after the meat has browned with the other ingredients.  We also prefer broth instead of water and use 1/2 Can of tomato sauce and 1/2 can of El Pato tomatoes sauce for a bit of spice. We have made this several times and everyone who has tried it has liked it as much as we do.  We have given the recipe out numerous of times.  Thank you Ron for a winning recipe!
After making this many times now, I add the flour to the meat after I have browned it, just before adding the liquid. Keeps it from sticking to the pan and thickens the sauce just fine.

The basic recipe is good I find it can be made with beef as well, which is what usually in chili Colorado. I add 4 to 5 Ancho chilies which I soften in warm water and puree in a blender with the other spices, I also add some cayenne pepper as we like some heat. I make mine in a Dutch oven starting on the stovetop then after everything is in the pot I put it in the oven at 250 degrees and let it simmer there for about 3 hours or so, Low and slow is the ticket!!!!!

Added some chorizo I had lying around and only had about 3/4 lb of pork stew meat, so I added less water and a can of pinto beans.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks for this!

I'm eating this right now for lunch, leftovers from a few days ago. This is the final bowl and it's very good. It is a little soupy but we didn't mind because it fit the bill and it has such a goooooooood flavor.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe to a "T" as I always do with new recipes. It was SO delicious! I cannot understand how this site can have a recipe for Colorado Green Chili or how someone can say it's not like any Chili Colorado they've had in the state. I too, live in Colorado. For the uneducated, "colorado" is the Spanish word for "red". This is Mr. Shepard's version of it. Again, delicious! The second time I decided to get cute and add different things. Mistake. Never mess with perfection. Thanks for a delicious meal!

I made several changes:  in order to make this recipe gluten free, I used tomato paste instead of sauce and omitted the flour, and decreased the water a bit.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and spice because the sauce should be fairly thick and we like sauce.  I used boneless chuck roast instead of pork making this more like the Mexican chili Colorado served in restaurants.  It was a Hugh hit!

I made this recipe and I LOVED it!  The meat turned out so tender and the chili sauce was divine over rice.  My husband really enjoyed it also.  I did double the ingredients and it still turned out fine!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I should’ve notice that the picture shows ingredients not in the recipe. Too mild for our taste, and too watery. Fixed it up with some cornmeal and cayenne. Probably won’t make this again.

Followed directions exactly. It was good, but sauce was too thin. Next time I will either use more flour or use some cornstarch. But I definitely will be making again.

Made as  directed and it was really good. I do like a little more heat to I think that that I will add a diced jalapeño with the onions to give a bit more heat.

Skipped the browning & threw 1lb of pork stew meat in the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients (used 1 can of tomato sauce though). Also added 2 cans of beans. Will decrease the amount of water to 2 cups next time.

I made this in my usual manner, using the recipe as a suggestion. I used the pressure cooker on high pressure for 30 min, and came out very tender. Liked the flavor and using pork was a nice change.

Totally love this soup/chili! I made a few changes. I used about 3/4ths of a 3 lb pork butt and chopped it into some pieces and placed it in the flour. I then sauteed it with the onions in olive oil and added some minced garlic. For the broth mixture I used two cartons chicken broth, 1 can tomato sauce, and 3/4 jar salsa. After the meat browned I added it to the chili along with corn and a frozen gumbo mix. Seasonings I added chili seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper, nutmeg, and jalepeno powder. I let it simmer for a few hours and about 30 mins before serving added in some rice and a flour slurry to thicken things up. And it was sooo GOOD! Definitely will make again!

No real changes to the Recipe, but a tip to those that found it to wet. Pork has a lot of water in it, I find putting the cubed meat in a cold pot with 1/2 cup water will render out the fat and will evaporate excess water out of the pork . Once that extra water has evaporated the pork will brown in its own rendered fat.

I doubled the recipe except for the water. I used 4 cups of water and increased the flour by 2 tablespoons to further thicken the sauce. Once the meat was cooked as described in the recipe, I added mexicali rose beans,lime cilantro rice, and cheese to a large flour tortilla and made an excellent burrito. It was topped off with more sauce and cheese and placed under the broiler until the cheese was nicely melted.

I am giving this 4 stars only for the fact that I don't use the tomato sauce. Instead I add red chili sauce along with chipotle powder, oregano, a couple bay leaves. This is the recipe my DH has been searching for! My MIL used to add potatoes so that's what I do as well! I serve the whole thing over rice. 10 stars!! Thank you Ron, please forgive me for taking liberties with your recipe! It was so very close to mine, you might as well benefit since you got something published! ;)(

Could use a little more spice, in it's current state it's a little plain.

Great recipe! We like a little heat in our food, so, I added a jalapeno and about half a red pepper to the mix. I added a couple of fresh garlic cloves as well. When it was ready to come off the stove, I took the pork pieces out and used a hand held blender to smooth out the sauce. Put the pork pieces back in the sauce and it was delicious!!! :)
