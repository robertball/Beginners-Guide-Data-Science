This is very good and quite impressive. I tend to make it with either just chicken or just sausage depending on what I have in the freezer. The yogurt on top makes it slightly less spicy and gives a wonderful last touch to the recipe. I will continue to make this.

This dish was so good!  I forgot to add the yogurt at the end and couldn't find any harissa but otherwise made it the same.  Our friends that we had over were impressed and my husband loved it.  It was a bit spicy for me but I think that using mild italian sausage would help out with that area.  My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is that this says 6 servings but we had 4 adults eating it and still had half of it left over afterwards!  But the leftovers taste just as good.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

This dish was so tasty.  My boyfriend and I loved it.  I did not have chicken thighs (which, I'm sure, would have been lovely) so I quartered a couple chicken breasts.  I did not have harissa, nor do I know what it is, so I omitted it.  Regardless, this dish tasted super good.  Just spicy enough and the sizing of the veg was perfect.  Also, the veg remained somewhat firm - just the way we like it.  I will be making this again.

I used mild sausage, left out the chicken and halved the recipe (only 2 of us). We still had leftovers. Great flavor.

This was a huge hit at a dinner party- everyone had seconds! This also made way more than 6 servings- more like 10 generous ones. I also found I had enough broth in the meat and vegetable mixture to prepare the couscous. I simply threw in the 2 cups of couscous directly into the pot after it was done cooking, waited 5 minutes, and gave it a stir (I used medium sized couscous).   We also found it wasn't as spicy as we would have liked, so we simply mixed a teaspoon or so of harissa with some chicken broth, and poured it over the meal. It was fabulous. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This was very good.  I used 1 lb. chicken breasts and no sausage. Couldn't find harissa anywhere, so skipped it, and subbed a parsnip for the rutabaga - which I didn't really like.  The flavor is great, though.  I upped the turmeric and cayenne a bit.

I played with this a lot because my husband is not a big tomato fan.  I used 2 large chicken breasts and also cut out the sausage to make it lower fat and lower calorie.  It was a really yummy dinner and even my picky little guy seemed to like it.

Great recipe! I used spicy Italian sausage only, substituted dry mustard for tumeric, and left out the yogurt.  My husband loved it! We will definitely make this recipe again.

my husband and I both loved this! I used ground Italian sausage and, since I didn't have harissa, used 2 tablespoons of adzhika instead. Will definitely make it again.

I used chicken thighs and drumbsticks with italian sausage.  It might have been better with boneless chicken pieces.  The vegies were overcooked by the time the chicken was done.  It wasn't so much a stew as I served the sausage and vegies over the couscous with the chicken on the side.  I didn't add turnip or garbanzo beans because I don't care for them.  Didn't find harissa and used curry powder instead of tumeric.  My husband liked it and the leftovers were good the next day.

I made this with the rutabaga and no meat. It tastes AMAZING and I'll definately make it again. I added some milk to it, until it was a light orange and it made it soo much better. Thanks for the recipe :]

Great, unusual combination of flavors, though for my personal taste I used a lot more of all the spices. The harissa is a lovely addition (found it at World Market) - do use it if you can find it. They didn't have any parsnips at Target so I used potato instead - and I should note I omitted the meat entirely as I am a vegetarian, but my meat-eating boyfriend enjoyed it too. Fun recipe to play with - next time I'll consider adding some kind of nut, maybe pine nuts, for extra crunch and heartiness.

I really liked this recipe.  It was a good, hearty stew, great for a cold day.  When I make it again, however, I don't think that I will use chicken thighs.  The meat was wonderful and tender but defnitely was not the easiest to eat.

I made the recipe according to the directions. It is very good! My grocery store doesn't carry harissa, so I made some using a recipe I found on the internet.

This recipe is amazing.  I have never cooked any middle eastern dish before and this one turned out amazing. I followed the recipe exactly except I could not find the harissa paste but this lady at a ethnic grocery told me the hot curry chile paste would work.  You can find it in the international food section in a major grocery like walmart.  It add plenty of spice and the flavor was mind blowing.

this was fantastic! i didn't have harissa on hand, so i used tabasco (1 tsp) and red chili flakes (1 tsp) instead, and the taste was FABULOUS! i wanted it spicy and it was just perfect.
My experience with couscous grain has never been as conclusive as simply pouring boiling hot water (with integrated chicken stock powder, olive oil and salt) over equal amount of couscous grain in a metal bowl. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and let cook on its own - away from stovetop - for up to 10-12 minutes. Uncover and fluff it with fork, so grains are well separated. if need be, add a bit more olive oil.

Fantastic! I made it a day in advance. We had a special event all day and it was ready in no time for dinner and totally delicious! It is now a family favorite.

We found this recipe very good. We did not add the harissa and it was spicy enough. We used boneless chicken breasts. To cut down on cooking time, we boiled the chicken and sausages first, cut the meat into bite size pieces and added it directly to the stew to finish cooking. Overall, very tasty and easy to prepare. I would like to mention that in all we had over eight servings, if not more!

REALLY good.  A friend gave me a package of Merguez sausage. Substituted thai chile paste (just a smidge) for the harissa. Didn't bother with the chicken; the sausage and chick peas were enough protein; the plain yogurt really gives it the one-two punch for an exquisite combo of flavors and texture.  A keeper!

This was GREAT! I did not even have all the ingredients, especially the spices, yet it turned out awesome! My husband loved it as well and told me to 'save this recipe'. :) 
Even if you don't have all the ingredients it will certainly turn out fine. Can't wait to make it again!
