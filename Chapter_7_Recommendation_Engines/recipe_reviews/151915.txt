Delicious wrap! I scaled this way back because I only needed a couple of these.  One for lunch and one to send to work with my husband.  I used light cream cheese vs. fat free and I didn't have spinach leaves so I used romaine lettuce.  I added some chopped tomatoe and used Swiss cheese as I love the combination of roast beef and Swiss.  These were so good. I'd definitely make these again.

I made a few different kinds of wraps for a Christmas party, and these were the unanimous favorite.  Didn't change a thing, other than used a variety of flavored tortillas to get a colorful plate.  Big hit, thanks for a great recipe!

What a great little sandwich!! The cream cheese mixture perfectly complements the roast beef. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used provolone in place of cheddar (personal preference). I'm thinking swiss might be good to try, too. As a cute little appetizer, you could also slice up a bagette and make "mini" sandwiches with this recipe. Very versatile recipe and absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making again. Thanks so much!!

Great recipe!  I used a bag of baby spinach and sliced Cheddar cheese from the deli.  The recipe ratio was perfect.  Perfect prepare ahead recipe, I made them 24 hours ahead and the flavors were perfectly combined. My kids now want to pack them for lunch!

Yum!  I made a bunch of different roll-ups for a lunch party and these were my favorite.  I used a Boars Head prepared horseradish sauce and instead of shredded cheddar I just used yellow american.  Didn't have four hours to let them sit..more like 1 1/2 and they were just fine to cut.  Will make again.  Thanks for the share.

I never knew my husband liked wrap sandwiches until I made this tonight. I scaled back the measurements because I was only making 3 wraps for dinner.  I used 12 inch whole wheat tortillas.  And I added sliced tomato to the layering of cream cheese, horseradish, Dijon mustard, spinach, roast beef, provolone cheese, etc.  But that's all the changes I made.  Next time, I might add sliced onion just for some ZIP.  But this was a simple, tasty dinner.  I can see many variations of wrap sandwiches in nights to come for dinner!

I didn't change the recipe except I couldn't find 12 inch tortillas - used 16 eight inch tortillas.  Served this up to a group of hungry men and a few women - everyone loved them.  There was one left over and it was great the next day for lunch!  I will make this again!  Thanks Tinker802!

Very good! I used regular cream cheese, and forgot to add the mustard. If you cut these in rounds they are great to bring to parties, I never have any leftovers.

I have made these numerous times for parties.  I square my tortillas and wrap tightly, refrigerate for at least an hour before cutting into 1 inch slices.  Even people who claim to not like the horseradish loved them

YUMMY! I took these to a picnic and they were a hit. I also have been making them for my husband and son for lunch. They have a wonderful freshness to them from the spinach. A new family favorite.

I didn't particularly care for these. I think the cream cheese may have been a bit overpowering. I did like the horseradish, spinach, roast beef combo. It was great to pack for lunch as well. I'm might make these again if I can find something to substitute for the cream cheese.

I made these sandwiches ahead for a baby shower and they were great!  They were very tasty with low fat cream cheese and extra horseradish.

I like to bring these to parties but I noticed the men eat them up more than the women. I have made this a lot but sometimes I leave out the mustard and the greens. You can mix up the cheese-my fave is 2% colby jack sargento- and I always use fat free or low fat cream cheese-nobody knows the difference because of all the other flavors and mix up the wraps; sundried tomato, spianch or wheat.

Pretty tasty. I use whole wheat tortillas to increase the fiber, which might take some getting used to for some people.

Another way to make this for parties instead of using tortillas is to use two packages of crescent rolls (I like to use reduced fat) to make a pizza crust and bake for 10-13 minutes and cool, then make a "sauce" out of the cream cheese and horseradish (and other spices, if you so choose), then layering on the spinach, roast beef and cheese. This is also good with sliced onions and peppers as an addition.

Only made 1 small tortilla for me for lunch. Used romaine instead of spinach and yellow mustard instead of dijon (just what I had on hand). Made and ate right away. This was the best cold roll-up I've ever had. I will be making this again!

These are great !  I stayed real close to what the recipe called for, cutting back just a tad on the Hot Horseradish and my wife & 2 out of 4 of my kids loved it. Reminded us of a dip at a famous resturant chain & gave us more ideas how to incorporate into other foods. If you stay close to the recipe it makes what it says it does. We'll be making this again.

I halved it, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Actually I lie... I also used more spinach. I bought the bag of spinach leaves and 2 or 3 leaves per roll seemed so minimal! I used about 6 leaves per wrap. All other quantities followed. I made this for my teenage daughter's lunch and crossed my fingers! She said she really liked it. I had one for lunch and I DEFINITELY enjoyed it. The final confirmation that earned 5 stars was this morning. My daughter left her project so I took it to a friend who's at a later bus stop. She told me she told my daughter she'd trade her a box of Lucky Charms (a forbidden fave of hers!) for one of those "burritos" LOL! Awesome recipe, thank you!!

This was a quick and tasty recipe.  I folded them up like a burrito, brushed them with olive oil and put them in a panini press for about 4 min.  They tasted like something you would order in a restaurant.

4 stars only because I altered the recipe.I used horseradish sauce and iceburg lettuce because that's what I had on hand. I made some with swiss and some with cheddar.Also had sliced red onion and  sliced green peppers available. My family loved them.I cut them in half and we ate them right away without chilling them first.Definitely a keeper.

I wasn't quite sure about the horseradish/mustard combo so made a little of it and made a roll.  Didn't like the flavor of it so I used a packet of ranch dressing, a clove a garlic, and some mayo with the cream cheese.  Added marinated artichoke hearts and used baby spinach.  Very yummy this way.

Not an entirely fair review because I didn't have dijon mustard at hand and had to use yellow.  That being said, the flavors were still pretty mild, I was hoping for more of a kick.  Might make again with some adjustments in the amounts of ingredients.

I thought that this was a great recipe, one thing I would say is cut the recipe in half for the horseradish and cream cheese i had too much left over! Besides that its a great compliment

Made these for a red wine tasting.  Everyone loved them.  They are bite size and delicious.  I did spend an extra 5 minutes desteming the spinach.  I also followed someone else's advice to trim the tortilla's.  Love this recipe and I plan to make it more this summer.

These were very good, They did not last long when they were put out at the table.. I did substitute 4 ounces of sour cream and 3 tablespoon of mayonnaise for one brick of cheese.

The horseradish makes these special.  I made no changes and will make these again.  One thing I always do when making tortilla pinwheels for appetizers is to trim the sides a little bit before rolling them up.  Then I just take the trimmings (which are usually mostly just tortilla) and lay them diagonally across before rolling.  This way you don't wind up with two end pieces that are skimpy on the filling.

If I ever make this again, it will be with no horseradish or dijon mustard.  I used less of each than the recipe called for, yet it was totally overpowering.

I used lettuce instead of spinach because I didn't have any.  These are awesome!  Next time I might try on spinach tortillas and stay with the lettuce.  Thanks for posting!

What did I do wrong?  Made them the day before the game, wrapped in foil, in the fridge, then to the ice chest. At the game they were already soggy.  Seemed like the horseradish watered down the cream cheese and made the tortillas soggy. It only got worse.

I thought these were bland.  I would add more horseradish and roast beef next time.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I also used bagged baby spinach.  I used tamato/chipote wraps which gave it an extra zing.

The flavors were pretty good, but the presentation didn't work. When I cut the tortillas, the rolls fell apart. Maybe I needed more of the cream cheese spread to hold it together, but I wasn't impressed enough to try again.

I made this recipe a long time ago when it was first in this site, but only now have remembered to give my review. We loved this recipe! We made it for a party and it was all eaten. The only change I would make would be to use baby spinach instead of regular spinach. It would be more tender. Enjoy!
