These are slice, reshape, then bake cookies.  They take about 12 minutes, not the amount of time the recipe states. Because the cookies need time on the cookie sheet after baking,  By baking on parchment paper, I could pull the parchment paper with the cookies onto the cooling rack, then get the next pan in the oven right away! The taste is delicious!

These are really good, my husband and family loved them and I will most definitely make them again.  My grandmothers name was Melvina.

The recipe is perfect. Make sure you chilled it for 8 hours because it will be easier to cut. The cookies are excellent! They are light and not too sweet. They are the best cookies I ever baked.

These are delicious. Two batches in one week, and I am reaching for another as I write. I usually don't have this problem with cookies. These are the best cookies I have had since the Dziriat (Algerian Almond Tarts) from this site I made last year. The topping is crumbly, but I think this pairs perfectly with the moist date filling.

I just made a batch and put in the freezer for later. I never saw in the directions where it said to put in the milk? I decided because the dough was so soft, to leave the milk out. We love cinnamon in cookies, so I decided to add a scant teaspoon. I hope they turn out good. Did anyone else leave out the milk? They sound delicious.

we really didn't like these.  they had a weird sandy sort of texture and just didn't appeal to us.  it was too bad, too, because we normally like dates.
