Hi! This is Noor and I would just like to add a comment about the recipe. One lady commented about not over marinating the meat and she is right. I actually meant to write in the recipe to marinate for 1 to 2 hours and no more than 2.  I know lamb chops are an expensive cut of meat and what would be more disappointing than to over marinate and have them too salty.  Lastly, if I may suggest to anyone that loves middle-eastern food, I often add 1/8 teaspoon each: cinnamon, allspice and garam masala. They add a delicate flavor that is perfect with the lamb.  
***I tried to submit with no stars and it wouldn't go thru, so I also give them 5 stars!***

I was a little concerned about using vinegar as a marinade here, but took a chance based on the reviews....it was FANTASTIC! We loved these chops and so did our 2 and 5 year old children. They were super-easy to prepare. You HAVE to keep the onions and do this : make a little tray using two layers of  aluminum foil. Spray it with cooking spray and place (drained onions) on it and carefully place tray on grill, alongside the chops. We cooked our chops on med-hi for 8 mins. exactly and in that time the onions cooked and carmelized a bit and man, they were tasty. Next time I will at least double the onions, they were that good.
Also, I would not recommend leaving the chops in any longer than the 2 hours stated in the recipe.

Whoa Sister...Awesome! My hubby and I loved this so much. I usualy use a marinade of: plain yogurt, garlic/ginger paste, fried onions, lemon juice, 1TB oil, 1beef bullion cube, salt & pepper.  But I was looking for something different than  my usual. I prepared as the recipe stated, but only I marinated for an hr instead of 2 as per advice from reviewers and I baked in the oven (in an aluminum foil envelope) at 375 degrees instead of the grill, still the meat was so tender and very well seasoned. This is my menu choice for the month so will be making this for 3 more times on this months dinner menu and for special ocassions in the future. I also live in the Khaleej-UAE and hope to find more recipes posted by this cook. Thanks a million.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I decided to give it a try and I wasn't disappointed. It was easy to make - I followed Noor's additional suggestion and added garam masala, allspice and cinnamon which gave an excellent flavour. Because I cooked the lamb on an indoor grill, and I wanted to use the onions as had been suggested, I removed the onions from the marinade and put them in a small skillet for about 10 minutes over medium heat to carmalize. I served them over the lamb chops - yummy. Super recipe Noor - and great added suggestion as well.

Very good. I made these for my son by request. I used reserved marinade to sautee mushrooms with some fresh mint and served the chops on top of them - excellent. Thanks for the recipe!

I couldn't stop eating this lamb and neither could my whole family! Loved the tanginess and the mild addtl flavor added by the spices. Used a butterflied leg of lamb and cooked on the grill. Put the onions to the side and caramelized - used 2 but next time, I will use 4. Added the spices that Noor suggested - 1/4 tsp each cinnamon, cumin and garam masala. Thank you!

Wonderful. Unfortunately the cut I bought was too fatty, but the meat itself was wonderful. I broiled   everything, including all the onions. Served with the onions on top. Delicious!

Delicious!! Prepared as directed, including the poster's additional suggestion of adding cinnamon (I didn't have allspice or garam masala, however.)  Marinated for just over an hour.  Served with grilled zucchini, insalata caprese, and the onions (grilled) that had been marinating with the lamb.  Next time, I'm marinating the zucchini, too!  Served to my boyfriend and his parents, and they (we) were duly impressed.  Whew.  Noor FTW!!!

This really is a great recipe.  I took other reviews advice, as well as Noor’s, and added the cinnamon, allspice, and garam masala.  To be honest, I did forget the spices and didn’t add them until I pulled the meat from the marinade.  It turned out deliciously.  I kept the meat in the marinade for seventy-five minutes and most of the onions stuck to the chops.  I added the extra spices and pressed them into the meat, then grilled them for about 5 minutes on each side – I had thick chops.  They were perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and very tender.   Thanks for the recipe!

I had never attempted preparing a lamb dish prior to this, and it turned out awesome!! The only part of the recipe i swayed from was that I left the lamb on the grill a little bit longer than 6 minutes per side. The meat was practically falling off the bone. I made it for our anniversary, its a hit in my family!!

Good recipe but cooking time definitely feds to be longer for the average lamb chop. Also, don't leave for more than a few hours in the marinade. Vinegar will "cook" the meat and if you leave it for too long the lamb will end up being tough. Overall a keeper.

This marinade had a particular tang that I didn't care for.  To be fair, I am pregnant, so maybe that had something to do with my intense dislike.  I also had to broil the lamb much longer than the recipe stated before it was anywhere near edible.  All in all, I was pretty disappointed and probably would not make it again, but I gave it 3 stars to give it the benefit of the (pregnancy) doubt.

This is a flavorful marinade that can be prepared in short order.  Reserve the onions and sauté them to serve along side the lamb.  I made due with apple cider vinegar with no apparent issues.  This will be something I'll make for a quick dinner during the summer months. Thanks Noor!

Fantastic recipe!  I use this all the time, but increase the amount of marinade and onions.  Despite trying a number of grill tools and trays, I usually lose 1/2 the onions in the barbecue, so I now bake the onions in the oven.

Way different IN A GREAT WAY than how I usually season my lamb chops for the grill! Brought out a wonderful flavor without losing the lambiness(?)! Thanks for such an easy but great recipe - this is how I'll make them from now on!

After you marinade and start cooking the lamb, add more chopped garlic, mushrooms and the remaining ingredients from the resealable bag to a saucepan and add rice and pepper and knorr chicken bullion powder. 20 minutes later, you will have great fried rice to go with the lamb!

Great recipe! I substituted the vinegar for a can of Coke and added about a tablespoon of cinnamon.  The extra taste of slight sweetness complimented the lamb very well.

Wow...this was delicious!  As a few others mentioned, I was skeptical about the vinegar, just because hubby hates it, but after grilling, we couldn't even taste it.  I added the cinnamon and allspice, and I think that did add some nice mild flavor.  We'll certainly be using this marinade again & thanks for the recipe...it's the first time we've ever made lamb.  ;)

I'm not a lamb lover, but my husband is, so, occasionally, I make lamb.  I made this as described except that I cut the salt in half (blood pressure, ya know), and marinated for 1 hour instead of 2, based on Noor's very helpful corrective review.  This is the first time I can actually say that I liked the lamb, rather than just tolerating it. My husband says it definitely deserves 5 stars, and it didn't need any more salt.  7/21/14:  Made again and it was great, but I'm updating my review because I discovered the perfect side dish to serve with it on eatingwell.com:  It's Minted Brown Rice with Peas, Onions and Feta. Sooooo yummy!  (They actually called for scallions, but I substituted onions.)  As for the lamb, I stuck with half the salt, but marinated the lamb for almost 2 hours this time and it was wonderfully tender and not over-marinated.

OMG, perfection! I've been craving lamb chops and for some reason it seems they're not always available at the stores I frequent. My mother used to cook lamb quite a bit so I have a special fondness for this. My chops were fairly thick, so I cooked them for about 12 minutes on my counter top grill. Also, doubt it made much difference but I used rice vinegar because that's the only "white" I had on hand.

Fantastic.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter (with just a tiny dash of allspice for good measure), marinated for 1 hour, and broiled on high, 5 minutes per side, as suggested.  Perfectly cooked (medium-rare), tender, and with the perfect amount of zing.  I broiled all of the onion on the roasting pan with the lamb, and it ended up like a sort of onion pickle - salty, but the perfect accompaniment to the lamb.  The wonderful aroma left in the kitchen lingered for hours after.

Excellent, made my shoulder chops finger lickin good!  I used red onions as that is all I had.  I sauteed the marinade after taking lamb out and it was the crowing glory to the chops.

I used this recipe for my first time making lamb and wow, it was wonderful!  I've made it probably 5 times since then and every time has been great!  I always add more onions then grill them in a foil pan like another user suggested.  Excellent topping!  Permanent dinner in my kitchen!

Great recipe.  I wanted to introduce my 1 and 4 year old to lamb, and this recipe was perfect.  The flavours were not too strong and me 4 year old even asked for seconds!!!

This was awesome! I loved the simplicity of the recipe and ingredient mix! My chops turned out beautifully, after marinating for the full 2 hours.  I did add a little cinnamon and garam masala.  The crispy onions were great.  There's no way to mess up this recipe! Thanks Noor!

Delicious recipe! I bought a package of Garlic Nan and a container of Tzatziki used it to make gyros. I used the onions from the marinade to cook with the lamb chops, they were a golden sweet and savory addition to the gyros!

The flavor of the lamb chops were very flavorful.  I marinated the meat for a little over an hour.  I used the broiler and had to cook each side for about 15 min in order to get it to medium rare.  I used the leftover onions and marinade and grilled it along with some mushrooms.  The mushrooms turned out a little too salty for some reason--I think next time I have to dump out some of the marinade and only use a little for flavor.    I served it with basmati rice and some over roasted potatoes.  My family enjoyed it.    It is a pretty simple way to cook lamb!

The seasonings in this recipe were just enough to accent the flavor of the meat without overpowering it. I used a little diced shallots in place of the onion, because that was what I had on hand, and cooked them in a pan on medium heat 3-4 minutes per side so that they were medium-well done, since I don't have a grill.  Definately a great basic recipe and I may be trying the marinade with other meats as well(I did half the recipe, also, because I had half the amount of meat on hand). Thanks for sharing!

I've made these many times.  At first I followed the recipe as written, but after 3-4 tries I switched to marinading for 24 hours.  Huge difference.  Since then I have had many, many people tell me, unsolicited, that it might be the best think they have EVER eaten in their life.  So I got that going for me, which is nice.

Although I don't agree, my wife tells this is the best thing I've made on the grill - I think my ribs are better but you get my point about these chops.  Very simple.  Oh and don't bother with the tin foil on the bone - takes to long and not necessary.

This was great! This was my first time cooking lamb, but your instructions made this very simple. I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the marinade. I followed others advice and only marinated for 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Hubby loves this recipe! Will make again!

Absolutely delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly except I pan-seared before before finishing in the oven.  Served chop with sauteed onion, from marinade, over thinly sliced sauteed zucchini with a pomegranate sauce.  Beautiful presentation and tasted as good as it looked.  All of the flavors complemented each other perfectly.

My husband raved about this!  It's  new family favorite!  He also now wants this for every Christmas and holiday.  I only marinate the lamb chops for about an hour, any longer and the vinegar becomes too strong.  I also doubled the marinade so that I had extra onions.  After starting to grill the lamb chops, I put the onions in a pan (trying to pour off as much of the juice) and fry them until they are caramelized. My family, who normally doesn't eat lamb, went crazy with the lamb and topping it with the onions.  Love this recipe.  So easy to make

I have never made lamb and this came out awesome! I didn't add the extra spices because I didn't want to push my luck so I followed the recipe exactly for the marinade. However I don't have a grill, soooo I cooked in the oven at 350 for 40 min, 20 min on each side in a pyrex. Then I broiled it on Low a few minutes on each side just to give it a toasty look. This is for well done, don't like medium rare. Will definitely be using this recipe in the future! Delicious!!!! Oh and I had lamb shoulder chops.

Loved it.  Didn't have white distill vinegar so substituted apple cider vinegar and added a few  sprigs of fresh rosemary and marjoram. Merinated about an hour.

Delicious, suburb, moist & tender.  I was frightened to use vinegar, just because it didn't make sense to me.  Didn't taste the vinegar at all. The only change I made was adding about a teaspoon of lemon juice to the marinade, just because I love lemon.  Grilled with real charcoal...awesome.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I never eat lamb because I don't like it, but I prepared this recipe for my bf and tasted it... wow! it's the first time I actually liked the taste of lamb. I let it marinate for about 3 hours and didn't change a thing. Turned out to be pretty good!

I used lamb steaks and they were oh so good!  I had concern using the distilled vinegar, but the flavor of the meat after grilling was so nice.  My kids both had seconds.  I will definitely do this again and thanks to a previous poster that grilled the onions on tin foil in the grill.  Not liking onions, my kids did try them and like them.

Simple? Yes. Delicious? No. I'm so sorry to leave a bad review, but this was not enjoyable for us. I followed the recipe exactly and even grilled the marinated onions as another reviewer advised. I couldn't finish mine and my hubby forced his down just trying not to hurt my feelings. If you want a simple and yummy lamb recipe from this site, try the Lamb Chops with Balsamic Reduction!

I found that the meat was tender but had no flavour (I marinated 2 hrs but didn't add the extra spices). The onions were the best part of the dish.

While I liked this recipe, my husband and I are not big on salty tasting things...so, unfortunately, with 2 tsp of salt, it was way too salty for us...I will make again though, but this time cutting way back on salt or omitting altogether.  it was a very easy marinade to make and the ingredients are things that most people have on hand.  Thank you!  I will try again minus the salt.

What a great recipe!! Got some NZ frozen lamb chops tonight for dinner and decided to use this recipe simple receipe. Wow, the result is just too good to be true!! After the lamb was Broiled, I added a teaspoon of Agave Nectar on my lamb chop. My family all love the taste of the chops. BTW, I only marinated the lamb chops for 15 minutes and you can taste the marinate all the way thru the Juicy meat!! I will use this recipe again and again.

This was my first time cooking lamb chops and they were delicious. I followed the directions to the letter. I thought that the vinegar would be too much for the marinade but, it proved to be just right. I only added a bit more seasoning during the grilling process, because I desired more flavor, but all in all it was a success! Thank you for this simple, yet delicious recipe!!!

We made these for our first Passover and they were amazing! I actually liked lamb! (I've always found lamb greasy and left a bad taste all over my mouth.) We grilled them for 5 min on each side (they were about 1" thick) and they turned out perfectly pink and juicy inside. I'd like to try this marinade on chicken and steak.

Cooking for two has its challenges, even with Costco lamb chops, but Noor's recipe got me off on the right track.  Changes?  Yeah, mostly because of what I have in the cupboard, so here goes:  2 T of olive oil in the plastic ziplock bag; 1-2 T of Italian seasoning; 1-2 T of rice wine vinegar, salt & pepper to taste; a shake or two of some lemon pepper; 1-2 T of fresh lemon juice.  Skipped the garlic & onion.  Okay, I forgot it, but hey, I'm a senior citizen!  My wife said that mint jelly is the standard go-to fixer-upper for most lamb, but this concoction didn't need it, and I would make it again.  Jan the wife said to pass the recipe on, so here it is!

I love this recipe and it was so easy. I marinated only one hour as other reviewers suggested but other than that, I didn't change the recipe at all. The lamb was moist, very tender and had incredible flavor. We will definitely be trying this recipe on other cuts of meats.

Simple and great! I was skeptical about using white vinegar in the marinade, but the resulting lamb steak was delicious! I marinaded it for 90 minutes, carmelized the onions on the stove top, grilled the steak, sliced it thin and my 10 year old daughter loved it! I will definitely make it again.

My family decided to have a BBQ for Christmas and I've grilled lamb before but wanted something more flavorful. After looking over this recipe i thought sure why not, Noor says its simple ingredients say its simple ......  WELL let me tell you this is far from simple, the minute you bite them !   Perfect mix of flavors  !  So much so that between Christmas 2013 and 1-25-14  I've made these four times  !  Every time I've used a Frenched Lamb rack and followed the recipe. Thanks Noor !

This were simply FANTASTIC!  I marinated them for almost 2 hours and discarded the marinate juices, but kept the onions.  I caramelized them, as another review said.  They were excellent!!!  Cannot wait to make these again!

My husband and next door neighbors loved this recipe.  The meat had an excellent flavor.  I also made a marinate of soy sauce and sliced jalapenos which I added over the chops.  I have been telling my brother is make this and I hope he does.

I am a beginner and only looking for easy recipe, so I tried this one. I followed all of the ingredients and instructions, except for:  I used lamb steak instead of lamb chops, I added thyme,  and I replaced white vinegar with lemon juice because I didn't have vinegar. The taste turned out to be super delicious. While eating, my hubby closed his eyes and shaked his feet because he enjoyed it so much :P The only complain that made me give 4 stars instead of 5 stars is : the meat was a bit chewy, not tender. I am not sure if it's because  the lamb quality, or you have to treat steak and chop differently?  Anyway, I definitely want to try this recipe again! Thanks Noor!

PS : Above is my review before I tried the lamb steak instead of lamb chops. I tried it for lamb chop lollipops and it's 6 stars!!!! My mother-in-law  never like lamb before, but now she loves it!

I live in an apartment, so I broiled rather than grilled - still delicious! I take the extra onions and fry them in a pan to top the lamb chops. Yummy!

We had never had lamb before and my husband came home with a package of fresh lambchops, so I had to find a recipe to grill them.  I found this recipe, tried it, and it was absolutely fantastic!!! I only had time to marinate the chops for 30 minutes, and I put the marinated onions in foil on the grill next to the chops and then topped the chops w them when they were finished cooking.  I cooked them on the grill for about 15-20 minutes total, and I halfed the recipe b/c he had bought one pound of the chops (3 chops).  I served them w fresh corn on the cob marinted w butter and garlic, and speckled butter beans.  My husband and I absolutely LOVED this....AMAZING recipe!! Thank you so much :) Now, we have a new dish added to our faves!

Outstanding.  I am not a strong cook...and was able to pull this off.  Simply remarkable.  I added fresh rosemary and substituted powdered garlic for the minced garlic (it blended perfectly with the vinegar).  Adjust the grilling time based upon chop thickness, grill temp., and desired doneness (I did 2.75 min. per side.).  Enjoy - you won't be disappointed!

WOW!  I too was skeptical of this recipe being that it did not have rosemary or lemon juice which almost all others did.  I am not a big rosemary fan so we decided to try this.  YUMMMMM!!!!  Marinated for 1.5 hours and broiled, these were great THANKS for sharing!!

Awesome!  We are full time cattle/sheep ranchers, but have always sold out of our lamb.  This year we reserved a lamb for ourselves and I didn't know where to find a great lamb recipe.  This was superb, we all loved it, great way to serve lamb.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

A little too acidic for my taste. The meat was very tender, but it overpowered the natural taste of the lamb.

I've made this recipe three times now, with lamb chops, pork chops, and steak.  Tasty every time!  I think my favourite was with the lamb, but it's not always easy to find it.  Good all around recipe!

I'd cut the marinate time down to 1 hour for high quality chops to avoid overpowering the flavor of the meat.  Other than that it was SUPER!  Probably one of my favorites of all time.

I tried this recipe today and it was delicious!  I ran out of vinegar so I substituted 2 tbsp lemon juice and it turned out great.  I agree with the other reviewers about more onions, next time I'll use more.  I was skeptical about using vinegar or lemon juice as it might be too tangy but it didn't, I marinated it just for 1 hour and grilled 4 min. each side.

Thank you so much for this recipe ya Noor. It's just perfect. A great, simple meal for a weekday. I use my grill pan to make it and I follow the recipe exactly. I also grill the onions on the side and it's wonderful. Shukran!

Yummy! I prepared the recipe exactly as stated, and marinated the chops for about 45 minutes. Also sauteed the onions and served them on top. Next time I will try it with the extras - the garam masala, allspice and cinnamon. But first I have to find a place that sells garam masala! Great recipe!

Simple is right, but it is also delicious! I normally do not rate recipe, but this one deserves one! I've been in search of a simple recipe for lamb and this is by far the best. You can't go wrong with it. I just follow the directions as stated on the recipe and two hours later, I have a delicious meal! Not only do I love it, but my boyfriend adores it as well. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This was great! First time making Lamb chops. My husband even loved it! I marinated the chops for about 1&1/2 hrs. put them on the grill on high for about 4 minutes on each side, to sear them and they were very juicy and tender!  Didn't care for the onions that I marinated and then grilled like the one recipe called for,  it was very good will make again!
Thank you!

This was very delicious, although I added dried thyme and oregano which made it much better and more interesting, and the chops needed to be grilled for at least 5 minutes per side for medium rare, they were underdone with only 3-4 minutes.  They were normal sized lamb chops.  I marinaded it for 4 hours... I will use that marinade again on other things, it was delish!

Great shoulder lamb chops on sale at our local Stop & Shop last week.  Wanted to try something different.  The white vinegar seemed odd but followed the recipe exactly. 
 Unbelievable that so simple could be so good!  No changes to the ingredients in the recipe, just  no foil needed. 
Will make it again and again.  Thank you.

My husband grilled it longer than recipe called for.  Probably 4-5 minutes extra.  Or else too rare.

Delicious. First time grilling lamb. Our chops were very thin, so I had to watch carefully, but they were fantastic. By the way. I used orange juice instead of white vinegar for the acid component in the marinade. Awesome.

I have been making these for years, but use balsamic and always rosemary. The video shows rib chops, but it is equally yummy with thick cut lamb loin chops. Either is delicious. 
Love it with red garlic smashed potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise.

The chops were 1 inch thick. grilling took about 16 minutes.
Made mint jelly available.  They loved a small bit of the jelly with each bite.

We’ve made this marinade a few times now and love it. I take the leftover marinade and sauté the onions in a saucepan until caramelized. It’s a tasty addition.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! My very skeptical husband planned on alternate dinner plans , but the minute these came off the grill he was in love. They were so flavorful and juicy, I can't wait to make these again for future guests as they are sure to impress.

DidNOT marinate! Cooked the onions in the oil and Red Wine Vinegar. Added all the rest of the ingredients to my 2 pieces of lamb. Then cooked 3 1/2 min per side in the same pan with the onions and red wine.

I loved the marinade! Very easy to make. However, I used Bragg's Organic Apple Cider Vinegar. I found that lining a large casserole dish with foil and letting the lamb chops sit a few minutes let the juices REALLY soak in. They were almost better later. Served with baby carrots and white potatoes, sprayed with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt, pepper, onion powder, and paprika, wrapped in foil and grilled for 30 minutes. Also..grilled romaine sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled sea salt, black pepper, rosemary, oregano, and garlic powder.

My wife loves lamb and I had never cooked it for her. I saw this recipe and thought I would try it. Bought nice thick chops and fixed exactly as shown. They got a nice char and were excellent. She’s after me to do it again.

Excellent marinade! Lamb was fork tender and very tasty. The only problem was the time to marinade. Original recipe called for 1-2 hrs in fridge. Author corrected it to 1 hour in review section quite a bit later.

Noor, thank you for sharing this amazing marinade recipe. I was surprised at first that there was no rosemary, no lemon, or other ingredients one is used to associating with lamb, but there was nothing lacking in the flavor of the meat grilled this way.

As noted in some of the comments, a shorter marinating time (90 minutes in my case) was fine, and there's a good case for erring on the generous side with the onions. (I lost too many through the grill grates.  Next time I'll use a griddle to keep them from falling through.)

Grilled over lump charcoal on the BGE, on the medium rare side, they were just delicious!  Thanks again.

I usually marinade lamb in organic olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, S&P.  Wanted to try something different.  This time I had some grass-fed lamb shoulder cuts so, I tried this recipe, grilled the lamb and saute the onions separately after marinading.  The onions sopped up all the flavors.  Served them and the lamb with mango, orange jam, tricolor quinoa and micro greens.  Yummo!  Next time, I'll try it with the added spices.  Thanks!

My husband liked these a lot!  I made exactly as stated but then separated into two bags.. I put his 4 lamb chops in one bag and will use the other bag tonight with a rib eye in it. No ,no. I used 1 tsp of salt and only marinated for 1 hour.

Hi my name is Tracey. I made this using red wine vinegar, instead of of the white vinegar. I marinated it for an hour. I then let it sit out for a half hour. I then pan seared it in olive oil. I sprinkled it with chopped mint leaves, and served it with mint jelly. My daughter, said I am so happy you are my mom, and you know how to cook. Thank you Allrecipes, for your recipe.

Simple yet delicious! Like others have said do not marinate for more then 2hrs. Also instead of throwing out the marinade, I strain the onions and fried them. Serving on top of the chops - Yummy! Even the kids, Miss 4 Mr7, loves them.

Oops! Got cut off in the middle of my review!  I made these with mini potatoes, and cooked everything in the oven at 400 degrees. Removed the chops after 20 minutes and potatoes and onions after 30. I took the marinade and strained it into a small pot, and added about 2 tablespoons of honey. While everything was cooking I reduced it down to a light sauce for the chops. Definitely a winning recipe that is easy to change for personal tastes. I will definitely be making these again!

Surprisingly tasty! I had lamb chops in the freezer from my last Costco rin and thought about cooking them up. Came across this recipe and was not expecting it to taste that good because of the white vinegar in the recipe. Boy, was I wrong! Took a short time grilling and even a shorter time on my hubbies plate. He loves it so much that he wants to go to Costco this weekend to get more lamb chops!

I made these lamb chops and they were delicious. I had to cook them in the oven. I used Loin chops and baked them about 5 minutes per side. Yummy!
I was going to add a little cinnamon and spices but forgot. Oh well, next time. There will be a next time. 
I will try the marinade on beef.

Excellent marinade!  Easy, quick, and only one hour is really needs unless you want a very strong onion flavor.  The chops are quick and delicious off the grill, which makes overall clean a breeze.

Great recipe! I followed it, with the additional spices Noor mentioned in his comment (Garam Masala etc..) and it turned out really well. Great flavor without hiding the natural lamb taste. I broiled in the oven but I imagine they'd be even better on the bbq.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I followed the directions as written.  The lamb was like eating a filet mignon and had great flavor.  This is a keeper.

Easy Peezy !  Delicious meal !  Cant wait to make it again!  I added 1/2 tsp of fresh lemon juice to marinate.  The chops were thick about 2 inches , so I had to grill 6 minutes per side for medium rare.  My wife loved it ! Cheers!

Made as directed. I had thick (COSTCO) chops, which I grilled on 3 sides; 4min, 3min, 3min. Came out medium rare. The chops were almost 2in thick. Nice basic marinade. Don't expect a lot of caramelization due to no sugar in the recipe. Very simple and tasty.

I made lamb chops for the first time with this marinade. Wow! So good. Being a novice I bought the rack sliced versus the "cleaned chop" ( it was $4 per lb less expensive! Or so I thought. ). So I had super fatty chops but what amazing flavor

Turned out great! Used loin chops which are thicker. I think browning for 4 minutes per side and 6 minutes in oven then rest will better achieve the medium rare I'm looking for.

I just made this with lamb chops as written, only eyeballing the ingredients instead of measuring and using powdered garlic and onion. The lamb chops were soooooo good! I think it is the vinegar.

Made it and I like it. I'd not been successful at making lamb without the gamey taste. I couldn't find chops so I used another cut but to my surprise it all went ok. Sided with couscous, red peppers and hummus. not bad at all.

Fabulous. I followed directions exactly including Noor's additional suggestion for garam masala, cinnamon and all spice. We broiled in the oven. The lamb chops were thick, so they took longer than 5 minutes per side. I reduced the marinade on the stove top and sautéed mushrooms along with the onions from the marinade. Served the mushrooms over the lamb along with brown rice and broiled vegetables. A great meal. Will definitely use this recipe for lamb chops again. Highly recommend!

Made it as written except for the onions as I hate onions. It was my first time making lamb chops and couldn't have been more pleased with the results. Very tender and great flavor. Next time I'll try his suggestions for the Indian-inspired spice mixture.

I don't like lamb, but my husband is Greek, so I make it every so often. I loved this recipe!!! I have tried so many, I didn't have high hopes, especially since it is so simple. This has now become a family favorite.

I didn't have time to marinate for 2 hrs but less than 1 hour and it was great.   Simmering the marinade with onions and mushrooms while grilling  the lamp chops was a great idea.  It was so tasty I couldn't stop eating it.  My husband loved it and making it again tonight but doubled the marinade so I had more to eat. Grilled the lamp chops about 4-5 minutes per side was just right.

Great marinade for lamb! We have a food saver with a quick marinator attachment that cut the marinade time in half.  I did add some dried rosemary just because I love it with lamb. Will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you for posting it Noor!

Thank you, thank you.  In the twenty years I've known my husband he wouldn't eat lamb....until last night...and he LOVED it.  I followed the recipe and the suggestions to add the spices and reserve and grill the onions.  It was so perfect we will be adding this to the dinner party rotation.

I added an 1/8 tsp each cinnamon, all spice and garam masala and loved the flavor. I also doubled the onion and made a tray of oiled aluminum foil for the left over onion. Placed tray on grill and cooked alongside chops. I also sauteed mushrooms and fresh mint in the extra marinade.

I added the submitter's recommend cinnamon and allspice to the marinade. And broiled for 8 minutes per side, for well done chops. 
They were pretty good.

Easy, fast, and delicious! Everyone loved it. I had to cook lamb chops, lamb ribs, and beef steak at the same time and this recipe covered all three meats. I grilled the marinated onions separately and served them on the side. Excellent. I will return to this recipe for the whole outdoor grilling season. Maybe indoors later too.

Made this last year, but on the stovetop.  It's simple and delicious, so I'm making it again for Easter this year.  Thanks for sharing!

You can also use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  This is our favorite way to eat lamb.  And I'm a big steak fan, but it might be better than most beef steaks.

I have made this several times and used it on lamb and a beef tri-tip. It is SO good and SO easy! We actually ended up marinating the  lamb for 24 hours because we ended up not eating it on the night planned and the meat was delicious! I had to use red wine vinegar because I was out of the vinegar it called for and it was fantastic!

My husband, son and I really loved this recipe and my husband isn't a lamb eater.  I am Lebanese and eat kibee niee (raw lamb) lamb is my favorite.  But the next time I make this recipe I will use a little less salt.  We loved this recipe  thank so much for sharing.

Loved it! It was perfect for us and our tastes! Very tender and so much flavor from these simple ingredients! We kept it on longer than the recipe suggested and made them well done. Perfection. This is now a staple in our household. Next time we will be sure to cook the onions too.

We are huge fans of this recipe! It's super easy to prepare, and comes out perfectly every time, I go by the recipes ingredients but sometimes I grill it, sometimes I broil it and sometimes I pan fry them. All cooking methods turn out equally delicious! Make it, you won't regret it!

Just tried this out.  It was great.  I followed the recipe to a T.  Only thing I would do different it to let it marinate overnight.  Other than that, it's perfect.  The chops were delicious.  I took the onions from the marinate and added them to some potatoes and fried them.

The best lamb chops ever. Live that it adds flavor but doesn't over power. I also sauté the onions and served the chops on top.

I tried this recipe today and it was my FIRST time making lamb chops; my family loved it and so did I. I required no additional seasonings since the marinade was enough. I required no additional seasonings since I used the marinade within the recipe.  Thanks for the great recipe NOOR!!!

this was very nice and simple.. marinated for 1 hour but wish i would have done the full 2 as i wanted it to be a little more tangy.. or maybe i should have added more vinegar.. either way i know how to change it up for next time.. added the onions to a cast iron skillet and cooked them on the grill as well.. ty for the recipe

I also wasn't sure regarding vinegar, but it was delicious. On the salty side, but that may be due to lenth of marinade. Not overly salty , but noticeable. I'll monitor the marinade time closer next time. Yes there will be a next time because this is a simple and delcious recipe. Broiled 6 - 7 minutes  each side. Next time I will use the grill and make more onions to grill along side.

Used this with veal chops and it was fantastic!  They were so tender you could cut them with a fork.  Super easy too.  Wrapped the remaining onions in a foil packet and grilled alongside the chops.  This is a keeper.

really great recipe.  made just a few adjustments.  I added rosemary and montreal steak seasoning to the marinade.  I grilled the lamb and while it was grilling I poured the marinade into a small frying pan, added a little red wine and corn starch to make a sort of gravy.  Came out delicious!

Tasty.  Had to use green onion since that's all I had.  Champagne vinegar instead of white.  Added a pinch of dried rosemary as well.  Overall very tasty.

My b/f and I never made lamb before and used this recipe.  It was very simple and easy.  I marinated the lamb for about an hour as suggested.  We also grilled the excess onions on the grill in foil.  This turned out great and we both loved it!

This was delicious!  have a recipe that we normally use for Lamb Chops but didn't have the mustard so I searched for something else.  This came up and since I had all the ingredients I decided to try it.  Glad I did.  The only change was that I used White Wine Vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.  Paired with some roasted potatoes and onions and this was a meal to remember.  In fact, we were all wishing we had cooked more lamb chops as we really could have eaten more because they were so good!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The only problem with the recipe is that I didn't make enough!  The lamb was very tender and flavorful.  I used the lamb chops that look like lollipops - will cetainly make again.

These are terrific!!! I made them exactly as the original recipe, except I used champagne vinegar as I didn't have white and they were delicious. I grilled them on my gas grill on med-high to a temp of 145 and them let them rest covered with foil for about 7 min as I made my salad. Also did as other reviewers suggested and sauteed the onions; they were a little strong flavored for me. I had forgotten to drain them first and think that was likely the problem. I used to have problems with overcooking meat on the grill, and found that using an instant read thermometer has made all the difference! Thanks, Noor, for this excellent recipe!

Excellent, i made 3kgs of it and still none of it was left. All i added was a little more onion and voila it tasted like some pro arabic chef made it. Humus or garlic sauce are best if your looking for a dip. I felt like cook after this, lol!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe. My grill was taking a little too long to cook them to the degree my family would enjoy, so we finished it up on the George Foreman grill.  The kids loved the taste, and it was juicy!

This is delicious!  You really need to marinate the chops for two hours or else there is not a lot of flavor.

I made this for a bunch of friends on the boat with roasted red potatoes and a garden salad.  It was easy to make and turned out very good.  Everyone complimented me on the chops.

I had never fixed lamb chops before and had to prepare them in a hurry with ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have distilled white vinegar but I did have white Champagne Vinegar which I used.  I only had about 1 hour to marinade.  These lamb chops were so delicious, I am making this recipe again for Easter Dinner tomorrow!  I keep my favorite recipes in a recipe box and this one made it in the box.  Definitely read the review about doubling the onions and carmelizing them on the grill or in a frying pan or even broiled in the oven.  They are incredible!  Thanks, Noor!

These were sooo yummy!!! I was a little hesitant with trying a new recipe since we only have lamb chops occationally since its too expensive to mess up. But it was delicious thanks for the great recipe, this is now my new favorite way to have lamb chops, it took out the gamey taste & was just perfect. I only gave 4 stars though because the onions were nasty! They seemed to absorb all the vinegar taste & just wern't that great. So I'll use them for flavor but not to top. Thanks!

Very good, nice delicate flavor.  I was a little worried that the seasonings would overpower the taste of the lamb - Worry not, it is the perfect compliment!

Wow!  I used this with lamb chops and can't wait to try it with steak.  Simple and absolutely delicious!  We grilled for 4 minutes per side for a perfect medium.

Marinated some chops for my bf, he absolutely loved this marinade.  I did as some one else suggested and sauteed the onions which he loved on the side.  I'm not a fan of lamb, but it was great I totally enjoyed it.  He is looking forward to putting some lamb chops on the Weber again.

Great marinade; I will definitely use again. I was a bit unsure about using a vinegar based marinade but it worked perfectly.   I marinated the chops for an hour and a half and then threw them on the BBQ. I also drained the onions and added them to the barbie and it worked a treat!

AMAZING! I have always loved lamb and I love it even more now! Fried the onions and served it on top as others suggested, with marinated veggie kabbobs on brown rice on the side. It was a delicious meal, I will definatly keep this recipe!

The lamb chops were great.  Instead of throughing the marinade away, I washed the onions and cooked them tell their were clear.  They were very good.
