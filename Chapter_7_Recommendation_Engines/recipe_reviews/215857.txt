No idea why this got such a bad first review--for me, this was super simple. I did add more veggies, like chopped red peppers, onion, fresh spinach, and chunked zucchini. This was great for me to make ahead for my husband and kids, as I work nights. All my husband has to do is pop it in the oven right before dinner. I'll update my review as soon as I hear from them how they liked it. NOTE: They liked it, though they did say "More cheese" for next time. My husband did mention he liked all the vegetables I added, so I'll do that again.
