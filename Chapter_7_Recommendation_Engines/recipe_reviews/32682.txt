Probably ok, but have found that adding just orange peel to a tea doesn't do much, even after aging. What is needed is a pure water soluble extract (the kind with alcohol) - adds more flavor, doesn't fade out, doesn't leave bitter after taste either (like I found out the hard way that the essential oils for making candy do!). I weigh the tea (I make big batches, for gifts), multiple the weight by 3%, add that much of the extract (by weight) with a spray bottle, let it dry spread out, loosely covered with a lid, about an hour. For 8 oz of loose tea, for example, I use about 1.9 oz weight of the extract. Then add other ingredients like some vanilla bean, some cardamon.

The orange flavor is fairly noticeable, but the clove/cinnamon is subtle to say the least. This wasn't bad, but I think I'll stick with my store-bought orange spice teabags. Thanks anyway.

I really enjoyed this...I did not have the dried orange so used fresh and squeezed some juice from the orange into it. I liked it hot but did have it chilled as well. I could see making this for friends on one of these snowy eves.
