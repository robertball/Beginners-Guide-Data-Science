So good!! Made it for my dad's birthday. He LOVED it. It didn't seem so soupy to me, probably because I baked it a bit longer. I added coconut milk instead of regular milk. I will definitely make it again.

I made my own crust in a springform pan as I could not find the right size premade crust.  I omitted the Splenda as it was sweet enough with the condensed milk and I used the coconut milk that another review had suggested. I prefer real whipping cream as well. It was a hit and I definitely would make it again.

We love this recipe! I just made it tonight. I toasted the coconut and the pecans, plus added some ground ginger to the crust.

I had never tried this recipe before, and chose it because I lived in Hawaii for 7 years.  I was pleased that cheesecake didn't "collapse" after I took it out of the oven to cool.  I served it for my family on Christmas Eve, and they loved it! 
Very sweet and creamy!
