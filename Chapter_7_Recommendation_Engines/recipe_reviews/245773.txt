I am the submitter. Make sure your rice is cold - leftover from evening before kept in frig is perfect.

Great quick breakfast meal. A good option when gave a few minutes in the morning and you don't feel like eating something super sweet.

A nice way to use up leftover rice, quick and easy too.   This has a very mild flavor, a pretty nice way to start the day.

I have been making a version of this rice for a few years and its just a simple easy delicious breakfast. Letting the rice get a tad crispy is better than frying the eggs first as I was making until I discovered this recipe.  I sometimes add chopped ham or bacon to make it more heartier.

Easy and versatile. I had no green onions or soy sauce. So I chopped some sweet onion and added it to the chilled rice. After looking for some soy sauce, I decided to just try it plain and it was still very good.

Sometimes you need a ridiculously easy recipe to convince you to try... this recipe was that for me. Skipped the green onions because I didn't have any on hand, and used 2 eggs to increase the protein. Didn't even bother to measure the rice. Easy, delicious, repeatable. When I make rice for another purpose, i may start always making extra just so I can make this again! Ha!

Great breakfast. My group like to add bacon or sausage, vegetables and heavier on the eggs. Cold rice is better.
