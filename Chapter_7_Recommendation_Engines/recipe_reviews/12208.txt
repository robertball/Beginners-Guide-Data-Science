I made this pie to take to a church picnic. The kudoes I got....wow! One man said he had eaten rhubarb pie all his life and this recipe far surpassed any he had ever eaten and would I please share the recipe with his wife. I have to admit, I thought it was excellent too. However, I too mixed the rhubarb with the custard mixture before putting it in the pie crust.

Beautiful and delicious! When I cut up my rhubarb, I only had 2 cups, so I threw in some raspberries I had in the freezer. I tossed it all w/ the custard mixture before pouring into the crust. I used a shortening crust, made a lattice top, sprinkled w/ sugar. The custard really cuts the tart sweetness of the fruit. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I've had alot of rhubarb pie since childhood, and thought to try something different.  The vanilla overpowered the rhubarb in my opinion.  The texture was great....i would omit vanilla next time.

So good.  I made a crumb topping for the top pie crust (mixed melted butter, brown sugar, and flour to make crumbs) instead of making a double pastry crust.  I like the contrast of the crumbs and custard.  This is delicious.  If you wanted, you could probably add an extra half a cup of chopped rhubarb for more of that tangy flavor, or maybe reduce the sugar a bit.

Absolutely wonderful! Of course you must start with a good crust. I,too, mixed the sauce with the rhubarb before filling. Easy and delicious!!

WOW. This is the best pie I've *ever* had!!! I followed the suggestions of others and mixed the rhubarb with the custard before adding it to the pie  crust. This would make a great recipe for any get-together and I will definitely be making it again and again!

Good Pie!! I used a few cans of tart pitted cherries instead of rhubarb in a pinch.  I had all the other "stuff" mixed together.  I went to get my "thawed" frozen rhubarb.  My colander was on the counter empty &  I realized I forgot to get the RHUBARB out of the freezer . . . I needed to get the pie in the oven to get to a party.  I drained the cherries really well & folded them into the custard goop with crossed fingers.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!  I always had complements on my Rhubarb pie, but almost got more when I used the cherries.

Easy recipe - just like Grandma's.  I mixed the rhubarb and custard together before putting in the pan - don't know if that makes any difference.  But great, simple, and delicious!

Easy to make.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  Great taste - sweet and tangy.  A good way to use up your rhubarb!  Lasts a long time in the fridge and doesn't get soggy!

This was a very easy to make recipe,and was very delicious. My kids loved the recipe, the custard is not to sweet and offsets the rhubarb bite.

This pie was a big hit but I gave it a 4 star rating because I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups.  Would have been much too sweet with more.  Next time I will reduce the vanilla just a bit.  I think it's needed to cut the bite of the rhubarb a bit, but was a bit too much.  Definitely will use this recipe again.  My husband says that his grandmother made the best rhubarb custard pie ever.  Well, move over granny... I'm ready for the challenge and I think with this recipe and the two changes I mentioned I'll have the blue ribbon.

suggestion  Pour boiling water over rhubarb let sit 10-15 min. It will take less sugar.

This was wonderful! The custard cuts the tartness of the rhubarb significantly. If you are looking for a very tart rhubarb pie, this is not it, but it is fantastic in it's own right. I made this precisely as written.  Next time I will try cutting the vanilla in half to see how that comes out. Still wonderful as is.  THANK YOU!  Update: I've now made this twice in two weeks... it is officially perfect as is! This one is a winner, folks. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

My family and I absolutely loved this pie!  I have tried a lot of different recipes on this site and have never written a review on any until now.  This one was so good I just had  comment on it.  I have never heard of making a double crusted rhubarb custard pie before, so I left the top crust off.  I also added a dash of cinnamon to the mixture and sprinkled nutmeg on top.  Wow! This is my new favorite rhubarb recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

This is a keeper!   I diced the rhubarb and mixed everything together as called for in the recipe and it turned out great.  The picture prodded me to be a bit more creative with my top crust which was fun as well.

Really good. I didn't put 2 cups of sugar, just 1 and was a great flavor. If you like the rhubarb flavor you don't have to hide it with 2 cups of sugar.

Absolutely fantastic.  I'd never tried rhubarb custard before, but after hearing about it I just had to make it.  I ended up being a little short on the rhubarb--it was still delicious, but I think the extra tartness would have been perfect.  I stressed about dicing the rhubarb finely, but the bigger chunks made for a nice texture.  I only did a bottom crust, and my oven runs a bit hot, so the custard formed this amazing crispy sugary layer on top, like a creme brulee.  

I've seen some reviews say to mix the rhubarb in, but it seemed to do it on its own.  I also followed other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups.  I think it could even be cut further, as it's pretty sweet right now.

Definitely my new favorite use for rhubarb.

This is delicious!  Resist the temptation to add a lot more rhubarb - it won't fit with the filling.  I accidentally forgot the butter and it still turned out great.  I'll be using this a lot!

This was pretty good, I just found it rather eggy tasting. I didn't have two pie crusts so I just baked it open, and it came out fine.

An excellent recipe! I only used about 1.5 cups of sugar (it was still plenty sweet) and omitted both crusts to ease some of the calories but it still turned out wonderfully.

I may have totally messed up by not measuring my rhubarb exactly and by using frozen rhubarb. but:

1. I ended up having about 3/4 cup extra custard mix that didn't fit in the deep dish pie crust (and more still dripped out to burn on the cookie sheet i put below the pie in the oven) 
2. after 55 minutes in the oven, parts of the crust were nearly burnt and the custard hadn't set.

The taste was too sweet also -

disappointing after reading all the other reviews -

My first ever rhubarb pie, turned out fantastic, my father loved it and confessed it better than my mom's, my husband who is not into sweets, loved it.  I think the sweet of the custard and the tang of the the rhubard is the perfect balance.

This pie was EXCELLENT! I thought it was just the right balance of sweet custard and tart rhubarb, and the custard wasn't thick and goopy or overpowering. I took other bakers' advice and mixed the custard and ruhbard together before pouring into the crust and that worked great, but I think if you want more tartness in the rhubarb you could layer them in seperately. This recipe does make for a pretty full pie plate, but depending on the size you're using, it shouldn't make a huge difference- the worst that will happen is that you might not use a small portion of the filling. The good news is, this pie behaves very well in the oven, and even though I filled my pie plate to the brim and then some, it didn't bubble over at all. In fact, I had more than enough rhubarb and piled some in the middle of the pie to fit it all in. I used the oil pie crust recipe from this site, and the pie turned out beautifully! I will definitely make this again!

This was by far the best rhubarb custard pie I have ever made!  My father liked it better than the one his mother had made for years (He is 75 years old!). I also mixed the rhubarb together with other ingredients before puting in pie plate.  Excellent!!

Great recipe! Creamy and delicious. I served it to company and got so many compliments. The only change I made was to add some sliced strawberries to the rhubarb.

This is my new favorite pie!  I think the custard causes the crust to crisp up, even on the bottom.  I did use fat free half n half for 2 T of the milk. I will spray Pam on pie plate next time as it did stick some.  DELICIOUS!

AMAZING! This is going to be my new staple for using up rhubarb! My grandparents' have a huge crop of it each summer, so I end up with a lot in my freezer. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, except for realizing that I didn't have quite 4 cups of rhubarb (so I just only used about 2/3 of my wet mixture). I poured it over the rhubarb in the pie crust, but then I did gently stir it around so that I knew it was all even. Absolutely fantastic, didn't even need ice cream.

Made this for Sunday dinner and they ate the entire thing!  I used blueberries and rhubarb and vanilla flavored soy milk (omitted the vanilla extract and milk).  I though it was very good and my family could not have agreed more! Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best rhubarb pie I have tried. The whole family was delighted with it. The filling was so delicious, rich, creamy and full of rhubarb. I used single crust, we don`t care for double crust so much. I added nutmeg and cinnamon instead of vanilla extract and used only 1,5 cups sugar, adding half brown sugar. Thank you for a great rhubarb pie recipe.

super easy and quick pie and so yummy! I changed one little thing by adding 1/2 tsp strawberry extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Sold out fast at the restaurant. Some people ate a piece after dinner and also took some home.  This is a definite keeper. Thanks for posting  it.

This is a great pie, but even though I cut out 1/2 cup of sugar, everyone in my family still said it was too sweet.  I wondered if I had gotten some extra sweet sugar, but that wasn't logical, so the next pie I make, I will only use 1 cup of sugar or just a scant over one cup.  I can only imagine if I used 2 cups of sugar what the reaction from my children, who love sweets, would have been.

I could have entered a contest with this pie and Won! Followed the recipe exactly except for adding a little cinnamon to the custard part.  Topped it with a lattace crust and some raw sugar and it came out of the oven looking beautiful.  Hubby had two pieces and now he likes Rhubarb.

this is delicous, it is very sweet, but the liquid soaked into my crust and baked it to the pie pan, we had to "chisel" it out. I will bake this again, maybe  pre-bake my crust

I used 4 TBL milk and  scant measure on the sugar and vanilla. This was enough filling for 2 smaller pies. Everyone who tried it, liked it and asked for the recipe! I'll use this one again.

Absolutely delicious. This is  a deep dish pie so be sure to use a pan with 1" depth.  I made a gluten-free version with tapioca flour as thickener. It required another 10 min of baking. I will try increasing the tapioca flour a little next time.  But will certainly make it again.

Disclaimer - if recipe changes get you angry, stop reading now!

At 44 minutes, my crust is WAY too brown around the edges. It tastes burned.  I'm thinking it should have been baked at 375, max.  Maybe if I make it again, I'll try 15 minutes at 400 and then lower the temp.

Did not have enough rhubarb, so I subbed in (half) frozen blueberries.  Fresh would work better, I'm sure.  Also did not make a top crust - instead used someone else's idea for a crumble topping (melted butter, brown sugar, flour and quick cooking oats).  That also browned way too much.  I cut sugar in the custard down to 1.5 cups as per others' reviews.  It does seem to be enough sweetness, despite how tart our rhubarb is - it might not be enough for 4 cups of rhubarb, though.  I probably should have waited for the pie to cool completely before cutting into it, but I was impatient!  Not sure if it'll set up completely when cool.

Ended up only using 3 1/2 cups of rhubarb (b/c I was making 2 pies and didn’t have the specified amount), but it still turned out fantastic!  Just like grandma used to make...delicious!

Used 1-1/2 cups of SPLENDA instead of sugar. Nice tartness (which is the way we prefer it) to compliment the custard in the filling.

Made it just the way it said.  Used the oil crust from the old Betty Crocker cookbook.  Still haven't mastered rolling the crust and putting it on, but that's ok.  It turned out great.  Too many years have passed to know if it's the same as what my mom used to make, but it's close enough!

I cut the sugar down to 1 C and vanilla to 1/2 tsp. It was delicious! Still a little sweeter than I like my rhubarb dishes but you can adjust the sugar to your own liking. I'll be making this again!

I made this for my father-in-law (he had been talking about rhubarb custard pie). Everyone loved it (even my husband who said he didn't usually like rhubarb). I just used a little less vanilla, and other than that I followed the recipe. I would definitely make this again.

I've made this twice in the last week or so and will likely continue to make it as long as fresh fruits are available in my corner of the world.  It adapts very well to whatever fruit I happen to have on hand.  I used only a bottom crust (Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site, with butter rather than shortening).  The second time I made it I used 2 peaches, a half pint of blueberries, and about a cup or a cup and a half of finely diced rhubarb.  I added freshly grated nutmeg to the custard.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup since I thought the peaches and blueberries would add a lot of sweetness.  It was a bit tart so I served it with a drizzle of maple syrup (no more than a tablespoon) on each slice.  SO good!  I think in future I will intentionally keep the sugar very very low to be able to round out the sweetness with maple syrup at serving time.

My husband loves rhubarb; first I tried the fresh rhubarb pie and it was delicious.  But this one was absolutely scrumptious - it was really easy to make and the custard was yummy.
