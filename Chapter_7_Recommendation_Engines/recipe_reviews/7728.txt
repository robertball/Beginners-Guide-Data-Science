This ice cream cake is great and very easy too.  I made two for a group of 16 and they LOVED it!  Per previous suggestions, I made a graham cracker crust and used a springform pan - both gave it a beautiful presentation.  People thought a chocolate graham crust might be too chocolatey and that regular graham gave it good flavor.  I also chopped the cookies in a blender which was a snap.  I made one with Oreos and one with Chips Ahoy - the Chips Ahoy was more popular.

This tastes just like a blizzard from "Dairy Queen" and it's out of this world. Only thing I did different than directed was I put the chocolate cookies in the blender 6 or 8 at a time to get more even crumbs.This was so simple and the taste was GREAT! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I served this to guests tonight, they absolutely loved it. I pulsed chocolate wafer cookies with 1/2 cup of coconut and 1/2 cup pecans for a variation of the theme. Then topped the dessert with swirls of Sue's hot fudge sauce from this site. Yummy! Thanks Jan.

Excellent recipe & so easy to make!  Taste like you've been in the kitchen for hours! The only changes I made was to half the recipe (it does make a large amount)and I put it in a oreo cookie pie shell.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks!

This cake was very easy to make.  I made two different kinds; one was Oreo and the other was chocolate chips ahoy with peanut butter.  I used light ice cream and light cool whip.  This is a perfect desert for adults & kids!  Next time I'm going to make a cookie crust.  I highly recommed this for a hot summer day!

oh man this was good!  I used chocolate chip cookies and made a gram cracker crust.  Next time I will make a brownie instead of a gram cracker crust.  When I served it I added hot fudge!

This recipe is awesome. I made this for my daughters 3rd birthday cake. I should have read the reviews first, cause 1 gallon of ice cream is too much for a 9x13 pan... next time i'll half the recipe. Otherwise - it was great. I might also try using different cookies and even candies to give it a twist. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

The kids would probably eat this all day if I let them, but I like being a bit more wowed by recipes - if only bc since I'm the one standing in the kitchen doing the work, I really want it to knock my socks off!  But seriously, this was a good afternoon summertime treat.  Changes I made (after reading reviews): mint oreos and only half the ice cream.  I meant to halve the cool whip as well, but totally forgot!

Very good  and very easy to make. I layered it so that it would taste more like the cakes at dairy queen. I made the bottom layer with chocolate ice cream and chocolate oreos, then over that i had a very thin layer of just the oreo crumbs, on top of that i put a little layer of fudge, and then the top layer was just the original oreos with vanilla ice cream.

What a great egg free receipe (my niece has a severe allergy to eggs).  Simple to follow and very easy to make.  Instead of a ziploc bag and rolling pin, I crushed the cookies in my food processer.  Also, instead of a square cake pan, I used my springform pan which made presentation (I used this as my niece's birthday cake) and serving much easier.

I used just a little over a 1/2 gallon vanilla ice cream (maybe 3/4 gallon? It was all I had) - which worked fine and per others, chopped the cookies in my blender. Different "cake" but then again - its an "ice cream cake." - or just funky ice cream bars. I wasn't crazy about it but my family ate it up throughout the hot weekend. Reminded me of cookies and cream ice cream.  I could see the mint oreos working equally well - which I might try if my family requests this again.

Very good. Still in my freezer a week later and tastes great. We used golden oreos. I will look to use other candy bars too. We also halved the recipe.

Holy Moly this is GOOD!!!  I changed the recipe a bit though.  I used 1/2 gallon of vanilla ice cream, 1/2 a package of Oreo's and 6 ounces of Cool Whip.  I split this mixture between 2 store-bought Oreo pie shells.  Served 16 people at a 4th of July BBQ and as soon as it was cut, it was gone!  Everyone RAVED about it and wanted seconds.  Great Recipe!!

I made this and it has been a huge hit with all my girls and all their friends! I used Chips Ahoy cookies and I cut the recipe in half, and it turned out great. It fit perfectly in a 9x13 dish, and I’ve also put in small individual cups and sealed them with Press & Seal. It's a perfect treat on a hot summer day.

The recipe says 1 gallon of ice cream.  This was way too much for a 9" X 13" dish.  Should it be 1/2 gallon?

Loved it!  Very easy.  I only used 1/2 gallon of ice cream -it was plenty.  I made a melted butter/crushed cookie crust, poured the ice cream/cool whip with more cookies mixture over that and topped with more broken cookies for garnish.  Almost too good as we had huge helpings.

Thought this was okay... I'm not sure how you'd fit a whole gallon of ice cream plus 12 ounces of whipped topping into one 9x13 dish. I used a half gallon of vanilla frozen yogurt and maybe 6 ounces of whipped topping and it filled my 9x13 to the rim. This recipe didn't "knock my socks off", but it's pretty hard to go wrong with ice cream and oreos. Would probably be a great addition to a summer cookout.

Oh. My. Goodness!  We were guests at a friend's house for Easter dinner this year.  Her daughter made this as one of the dessert choices.   This was wonderful!  I liked that she left the chunks of Oreos pretty large, so you got a definite bite of cookie, and it kept the dessert from turning a "murky" color from little powdery pieces.

This is a great recipe - especially when I went to go buy the blizzard cake myself and the small was 17.99 and the med. size was 24.99. You can buy the ingredients yourself for one much larger than theirs for under $10.00! Keep your overpriced Blizzard cakes DQ - Thanks for the recipe!!

My mom always made this when I was growing up.  Another variation is to pour caramel ice cream topping on it and top with whipped cream and cherries.  It is good, but, personally, I like it the way it is!

I decked mine out with a little Reddi whip and some colored sprinkles. I think next time I'll try a chocolate cookie (graham) crust bottom. It is so easy to make I almost couldn't believe it.

Instead of crushing the cookies and mixing them into vanilla ice cream, I used "cookies and cream" ice cream with the cookies already in the ice cream!  I just had to fold in the whipped topping and decorate with whole Oreos.

I made an oreo cookie crust..then mixed crushed oreos into the softened icecream and then folded in the whipped cream and put it into a 9 x 13 pan. I bought 2 packages of oreos and used them all, I then used a 2 qt container of van.  icecream and a 16 oz whipcream container.I then topped it off when more crushed oreos. It turned out pretty good. Everyone loved it.

My 19 year old daughter brought the ingredients home from the store to make this for a teacher at school.  I thought she was nuts!  The next day at our school, this cake disappeared in 10 minutes!  The teachers turned the pan upside down to get every last drop!  It is wonderful!  No one will believe that it takes only three ingredients and 10 minutes to make!  Everyone asked for the recipe!

So good on hot summer day! Nice break from traditional cake!
Used half gallon of vanilla bean, 8oz chocolate cool whip and store brand chocolate sandwich cookies (w chocolate frosting). Also made a 'crust' with the crushed cookies on the bottom of the pan, mixed crushed cookies with ice cream/cool whip mixture and sprinkled top with cookies too. 
Next time I think Ill try to use different combinations or try with mint oreos.

This icecream cake was delicious! I have enjoyed it a lot this past summer.
The only change I've made was using gluten free oreos instead of regular.

I took a lot of liberties with this recipe. Used a 12” springform Pan. Made a crust of crushed chocolate Teddy Grahams (it was what I had on hand) and melted butter. Mixed the crushed Oreos with 1/2 gallon of coffee ice cream (1/2 of a 20 oz pack) and whipped topping. Put 50% of mix in pan. Layer of sugar free hot fudge and cookie crumb mix (reserved about 1/4 of it), then spread remaining ice cream and topped with rest of cookie crumbs. It was amazing!!

Made this several times, Love the recipe but agree  with the review that said as written it is too sweet.  The last  time I made it I  took the filling out of 3/4 of the cookies. Same Oreo flavor less overly sweet taste.

I make these a lot.  You can change up the cookie and ice cream flavors and add toppings too.  Oreo cookies with mint chocolate chip ice cream is excellent.

Made this at the firehouse tonight. We modified the recipe by using cookies and cream ice cream and the mixed Reeses Oreos into the ice cream. Then drizzled it with chocolate syrup. It turned out fantastic.

It was so quick and easy. We used Raspberry Cream Oreos to change it up a little. It was definitely a great idea. So yummy!

This was a big hit at the 4th grade End of Year Party!  I made both the Oreo and Chocolate Chip versions.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will add more cookies.  Several asked for the recipe.

I made this for my sons 9th bday and it was so hot outside so it was perfect for a water party made it with mint oreos tasted just like a blizzard cake at DQ thanks for sharing.  Now I have questions for all about the cakes Im  thinking of making with this recipe here they are:  My 4 year old wants banana cream pie blizzard cake for his bday in nov so thinking add banana pudding or bananas (have to think about how it will work) and nilla wafers. Then for his party he wants m&m blizzard cake.  Then for my bday I want to try cheesecake one which I would add a cheesecake and graham cracker right?  For a pumpkin one was thinking of making a pie and adding it to it with the ice cream and cool whip any answers (HELP ME) for those new ones Im attempting to make in a few months?  Not sure how the banana one will turn out I will let all know when I make it.  But awesome recipe and hope to make  all  these without them tasting weird:)  Wish me luck
