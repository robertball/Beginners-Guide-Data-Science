As it is  written this is pretty good but VERY sweet.  If I were to make it again I would cut the sugar by at least half.  Also I would add some cinnamon to the apples.  The 'syrup' is very thick, much like caramel apples.  With a few minor changes this would make for a nice Sunday breakfast.

We all loved it!  Very sweet though.  I used a small amount to make it perfect of my french toast.  My greedy sister and mother used the whole rest of the sauce for theirs.  Which was suppose to be used for another 4 servings!  Needless to say, we all liked it
