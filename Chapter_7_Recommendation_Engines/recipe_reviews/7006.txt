Very good, but I like my apple breads a little sweeter so I'll make the brown sugar one cup instead of 2/3 cup.
It has lots of tasty ingredients.

This recipe would be a great addition for the holidays.  I didn't have a cinn. so I used apple pie spice, which I thought worked out well.  Cooked for 50 min and it came out perfect...soft, moist and yummy. Very easy, my 3 year old and I made it together (and she loved it!)  To the person who complained that the batter was "lumpy"...it has oatmeal, raisins and apples!  Need I say more?

I made this to have as a morning snack at the office and really liked the fact it contains oats and apples. It is best served warm and I will make this again and again as a morning snack.

Enjoyed this very much. I baked this in my bread machine using the quick bread setting. It came out great! I omitted the walnuts (since I am allergic) and increased the raisins to 1/2 cup. I also doubled the amount of apples. I used 3 granny smith apples and chopped them up instead of grating them. I put everything in the bread machine in the following order ~ Eggs, milk, and oil on the bottom. I mixed all of the dry ingredients together in a bowl and then added those on top of the liquid. Last I added the apples and raisins. Came out very moist. 12 generous servings = 3 WW points.

I've never made apple bread before (always bananna), so this was a great alternative. I used 2 cu grated apple and omitted the nuts and raisins. I found the bread to be a very delicate flavor even with a dash of cardomon. I often spread peanut butter on my slices for a different taste. I will make it again, maybe next time I'll try it without the oats. It was a great first foray away from traditional bananna bread.

Wonderful, dense and moist with a delicate flavor. Used 2c grated apple, kept other ingredients the same.  Did not add raisins or nuts to the batter.  Topped the loaf with a nut crumble topping. Will definately make it again!

This bread is not as sweet as Pumpkin bread, but I think it is not supposed to be. I found with a well pre-heated oven I found it better to cook this 50 minutes, not the 55-60 as recommended. The first batch at 55 was dry, although the taste was great. The second batch at 50 minute turned out great and plenty moist. Of course, go the minimum and check with toothpick. Thanks for the great recipie.

This is excellent bread.  I've made it several times, and I always double or triple the recipe because it goes so quickly in my house.  I love this recipe because it's so variable.  And I can sneak in lots of healthy stuff!  I've even made made a vegan version of it by subbing mashed bananas and apple sauce for the eggs and soy milk for the milk.  It was delicious!  I finally settled on a 'half-vegan bread'.  I use mashed bananas or applesauce instead of eggs (1/4c applesauce or 1 small banana, mashed = 1 egg), I add 1/4c sour cream, 1/2c shredded carrots, 1/4c sunflower seeds, and 1/4c wheat germ.  Sometimes I need to add a little more milk depending on the temperature.

This bread turned out great!  In spite of the fact that I...forgot the oats, used 2 bananas and 1/2 cup apple sauce since I had no apples, and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 ap flour.  It was still delicious and my toddler is eating it up!  Now I can't wait to make it WITH the oats.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this with no changes and it is yummy warm, right out of the oven. Topped with a dab of butter and agave syrup, my toddler gobbled it up! I took it out of the oven just after 50 minutes, any longer would have been dry. Will be great with chai tea for my mid-morning snack.

I thought this was good, especially with a little butter on it fresh out of the oven.  My substitutions were: 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of grated apple, used 1 full cup of brown sugar, and substituted 1/2 cup of white flour with wheat flour. And it only needed to be cooked for 45 minutes in a metal loaf pan in my gas oven.

I got the same result as the other not-so-excited reviewers - it practically burned on the outside but was still lumpy, undercooked and at the same time dry on the inside. It was barely sweet and didn't have enough flavor (tasted like a bad oatmeal pretty much). Perhaps a better results could be achieved by using bananas, but then it wouldn't be an "apple" bread... I think there are too much of oats and not enough sugar, raisins and nuts. There are better and not less healthy recipes out there and I won't bother making this again.

Excellent bread! Moist, flavorful and quick to make. I omitted the nuts, doubled the raisins and added a 1/4 cup wheat germ. Kids (4 and 2 years old) loved it. Great recipe that you can adjust to your taste and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. Will be making again. Thanks!

Delicious!  Amazing! I've brought this to parties, given it as gifts, and everyone loves it. I made the recipe exactly as is, and it came out very moist and is very hearty with the oatmeal If you like sweet breads, you may want to put in 1 cup sugar instead of 2/3rds cup.  My boyfriend and I don't like things too sweet, so the 2/3 cup sugar was fine.  A keeper!

My husband wanted an alternative to me always baking sweet treats.  This is a hearty bread full of goodness.  I didn't take the time to grate apples but used Motts unsweetened granny smith applesauce instead which was a quick alternative.

I took this bread into work and it disappeared by the end of the day.  Everyone loved it. Whats great about the bread is that it is loaded with so much good stuff that it gives you a real nutritional kick. Also I only had to bake it for 45 minutes.

My daughter thought it was a tad bit dry. I think I will add either sour cream or yogurt to it next time. My husband thought it was not sweet enough. Only he would know because he's diabetic. I think its sweetened just right! :) The loaf pan was emptied before second coffe pot was brewing at the work.

I made this for breakfast this morning, I left out the walnuts. A very nice moist bread and not too sweet, but I think I would increase the amount of raisins next time. Thanks.

This is a delicious breakfast bread that is good any time of day!  I added a generous 2 t. cinnamon and dash of ginger plus doubled nuts and raisins.  Increased soda to 1 t. and used buttermilk.  Also to make healthier I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 oat bran.  That does make is more crumbly but delicious.
Thanks for a great recipe.

Very dissappointed! I didn't cook it for as long as it said. The outside was rather hard and the inside was very moist. Even after I cut the crust off the bread wan't very good.  I don't think I did anything wrong, but who knows...

Very moist.  Enjoyed it.  Not real sweet at all.  I will make it again when needing to use up a couple things.

I made it gluten-free with Bob's Redmill GF flour and I used 1 cup of monkfruit sweetener instead of sugar, coconut oil, cooked apple chunks and doubled the cinnamon, raisins & walnuts.  It turned out yummy and healthier than the original recipe.

I didn't change the recipe and agree that it needs more sugar and less salt. The oats made it drier. Don't think I'll make it again as I prefer recipes  that are full proof.

I didn't grate apple in it. I added cranerries and raisins. It's a dense bread. Very nurishing 
I will make again probably with the grated apple and walnuts.

Very easy and was popular because it was not too sweet. Has an interesting texture.

I Love this recipe. I did alter it the sugar I used half splenda and half brown sugar, and a cup of strawberry applesauce in place of the apples and oil. And only cooked for 40 minutes. It was absolutely great. :)
