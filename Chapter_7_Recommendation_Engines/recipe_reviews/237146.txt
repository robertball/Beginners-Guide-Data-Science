I didn't have orange extract so decided to try this recipe with orange kool-aid. It was good but next time I will only use 1/2 of the kool-aid mix and I reduced the powdered sugar to 5 cups.

This is such a great idea but it was way way too sweet and there was a strange after-taste from the KoolAid. The frosting needs about 3/4teas of salt. I will probably experiment a bit with this because who doesn't like a creamsicle! I'm thinking about doing this again with a sweetened whipped cream thickened slightly with confectioner's sugar and a bit of concentrated orange juice. Nice concept though!
