It was nice to try something new, but I don't think I will make this one again soon.  It did taste very "fresh", with both cilantro and celery in there.  Not as much flavor as I'd like though.  I love cilantro, but I think I prefer a more traditional eggg salad.  I used light mayo and no mushrooms.

Wow this is awesome. Only thing I did different was I used onions instead of the mushrooms and used less mayo, prolly 1/2 a cup or possibly even 1/4. Tastes so good, especially if you like cilantro

There was WAY too much going on in this recipe, both flavor- and texture-wise. Sometimes less really is more.

Fantastic! Just like another reviewer, I used chopped onion instead of mushrooms. Can't wait to share this with friends and family!

I really liked this salad. It is def. a step above boring egg salad. My cilantro came fresh from the garden so it really added a lot of flavor. I didn't have lime juice so I added 2 tsp. of lemon instead. I also left out the mushrooms. It was a little soupy but the flavor is exellent.

This is a great recipe! I liked the different textures, and cilantro, well, it just rocks this recipe.   As a side note, i would ignore the reviews that omit Cilantro?

Just made this... changed it alot though. Only used onion and none of the other veggies, i also didn't use the mustard or the citrus juices. I just threw in lots of cilantro, mayo, salt, pepper, and couple dashes of hot sauce. I guess what i'm saying is this was a great starter recipe to play around with!

Loved it!  Used less mayo and subbed red onion for the mushrooms as I don't like mushrooms.  Ate it on a croissant.  Excellent...will definitely make again!

Delicious!  I used a little less mayo and cilantro, omitted the mushrooms, and added scallions.  I also added some herbs (dill, tarragon).  Definitely a keeper!

Wasn't bad. Added 1/2 the amt of mayo, slightly less cilantro (to taste), 1/2 tsp curry powder, and sprinkled chili powder on top. My husband liked it even though he's not very fond of egg-salad to begin with and I thought it was decent. May or may not make again in the future.

This turned out pretty well!  I made the following adjustments based on a few of the previous reviews and my own preferences. I'm not even sure if it is even the same recipe, but it tasted nice :-)
1 extra egg,
1/2 cup Mayo,
omitted the Cilantro, Lime Juice, & Mushrooms (since one or two of the reviews suggested that there were too many flavors going on),used a 1/4 of a small onion diced,added a few drops of hot chili sauce, and a few sprinkles of Paprika. I liked the end product. Thanks for the great base recipe.

I love the addition of cilantro (I'm a cilantro junkie) so of course I added a bit more than called for. I also omitted the mushrooms and salt (personal preference). A fun twist on the traditional egg salad, thanks.

What a refreshing new twist on egg salad!! It's wonderful and I am sure it will get even better when refrigerated a few hours. I did use Miracle whip instead of Mayo and cut back to about 1/2 cup. I was out of fresh limes, so I used True Lime powder and it works great. I also used 2 T. fresh onion instead of mushrooms. I used only half of the cilantro. More would be too much!

This egg salad has a really good taste.  Next time I will prepare it with less mayo, however.  I prefer mine with a chunkier consistency.  I tried this between two pieces of toast and it was a little messy.  But, overall, it is a tasty and easy recipe.  My husband loved it!

This is a great alternative to standard egg salad. I served w/ with lettuce in a wrap. Eat it while it's fresh. We loved it the day I made it but by the next day the cilantro flavor was too over powering (and we love cilantro) and the salad a bit soggy.

this is amazing, though I might use a little less cilantro next time unless I can add Avocado.

I also HATE celery, so I did not put any in. next time I may use some celery salt instead.

Pretty good. A bit heavy on the cilantro. Still with all the ingredients it was on the bland side.
