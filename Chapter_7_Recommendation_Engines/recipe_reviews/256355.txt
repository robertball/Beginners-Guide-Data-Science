Simple and straight forward. I do have a recommendation. Chicken releases a lot of juices in the first  few minutes of cooking leaving your sauce in a puddle underneath the chicken. My recommendation is to wait until that first flip and then baste your sauce mixture on with every flip. That way by the time you get to the broil step you have a nice even coat of sauce on your wings which browns up nicely under that broiler. I also recommend reducing total cook time to 45 minutes.

Very simple recipe using common ingredients.  I baked the wings on a broiler rack in the broiler pan, to keep them raised up out of the released liquid.  Broiling for the last few minutes per side gave them a nice finished look and taste.

So simple and yummy.  I'll definitely make these again.  I love that the ingredients are things I always have on hand.  Makes a sweet, sticky, stay on the wing sauce.  Yum!

I thought they were tasty, but I would lower the temperature next time. Not sure you need to keep turning them! Would try again!

I made recipe exactly as is. Found the wings pretty bland. Even using the maple syrup and a bourbon bbq sauce. Wonâ€™t be making again.

This recipe was delicious. The only different thing I did was bake the chicken in the oven. My family loved it, and I would defiantly make it again.
