HELPFUL TIPS THAT WORK: I've made this exact recipe for several years now, & have learned a few things.  They take me 40-60 min in the oven.  I just take a fork & occasionally poke it to see if the fork slides in easily.  I use 6-8 med red potatoes, 4 large (baseball size), or about 11-12 if they're the really small (little bigger than golf ball) ones.  After I quarter the potatoes, I cut those in half again to make them more bites-size esp. for my toddler who LOVES these.  I find NO NEED for butter outside of PAM to grease my dish.  Otherwise, it turns out GREASY! ...and I use 3T of honey and sprinkle some parsley for color.  No onions if my husband is eating.  Sometimes I line w/foil too because it can get sticky, otherwise a good soaking gets it all up quickly.  UPDATE: It's perfect (nice glaze) w/o being too sweet, but you should mix it a few times while baking so what has become a liquid can be reapplied and the potatoes on the top aren't dry.  Be sure to line these on a sheet instead of layering too because the top ones will be dry.  I ALSO have to use more than a pinch of salt.  Sprinkle enough so there's a little on all the potatoes or it's too bland.  Broiling for the last 2-3 min. caramelizes the honey nicely.  My husband & kids like ketchup on these which surprised me since they taste divine with nothing on them.

Very yummy! I also doubled the honey (probably tripled actually), I substituted the dry mustard with cayenne pepper and really loved the sweet/spicy flavor. I also substituted the butter for peanut oil and that crisped the potatoes up better. I would recommend lining your baking sheet with foil because otherwise the honey hardens and is VERY difficult to clean.

Wonderful recipe! However, the first time I made it we all agreed we wish there was a little more "taste" (maybe I used to many potatoes? I am never good at judging a "pound" of potatoes).  So the second time we made it I used 3 TBLS diced onion, 5 TBLS butter, 3TBLS honey and 3 tsp dry mustard...melts in your mouth good.  And it really goes well with almost any maindish.

I have made these many times and they have always been a huge hit. I do make the following adjustments however:

1. I boil the potoatoes first - just until a little more tender, but still firm (not for too long or will be mushy after roasting- just up to 5 minutes, no more). I have tried the recipe without boiling first, and then with boiling, and WITH BOILING FIRST THE POTATOES SOAK IN MUCH MUCH MORE OF THE BUTTER/HONEY FLAVOUR!

2. I always double the butter/honey mixture, and halfway through roasting I stir the potatoes and top off with extra of the butter mixture (1/2 of butter mix on poatoes at beginning, 1/2 of mix midway through roasting

3. I roast until I have enough "crispy" potatoes

4. Instead of using onion (my kids won't eat) I add onion powder to the butter/honey sauce.

5. I use more dry mustard powder than the recipe calls for (add to taste)

Sometimes I boil the potatoes the night before, and then do the butter/honey mix and through potatoes in the oven just before company arrives. Try not to layer your poatoes - single, but "tight" (so the sauce doesn't just end up all the bottom) layer is best.

These were absolutely delicious!  Because of long experience with roasted potatoes, I allowed an hour to roast, and covered with foil for the first 40 minutes.  This is definately a keeper!

I tripled the recipe and took these potatoes to a church dinner.  I sat next to a very good chef.  He loved them, and asked for the recipe.     I followed the recipe, but...mixed the potatoes and sauce in a large bowl. I then  cooked them in a nonstick metal baking pan.  It caused them to get very brown and carmelized.  I stirred several times. and because there were more cooked them for a longet time.

Not a potato leftover, they were just as good (if not better) sitting at room temp for a while as they were hot.  I tried to put the leftovers away and they never made it to the fridge, I accidentally ate them all.  I melted the butter in a large bowl, added the remaining sauce ingredients, mixed, added the onions then the potatoes, tossed to coat and put them on a foil lined baking sheet. I broiled them for about 5 minutes at the end to crisp them up a bit.  Keep in mind 1 lb. potatoes is not much so you'll more than likely need to double the recipe.

These are great!  Not overly sweet and a nice change from regular roasted potatoes.  Definitely put down non-stick foil for these!  I added a little extra sauce during cooking and next time I may not even add the butter.

This recipe was a huge hit at our house.  My husband who doesn't even like red potatoes asked me to make them again some time.  The potatoes come out really sweet.  They just needed a little salt and pepper at the table to adjust the taste.  
I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I didn't have any trouble with them not being done and left them in fairly good size chunks.  Next time I will take other reviewer's suggestion of placing under the broiler the last few minutes to make the skin crisper.

These turned out so good.  The honey carmelized on the surface of the potatoes and the onions and everything was perfectly tender.  I added a tablespoon of olive oil and an extra tablespoon of honey.  I let them sit in the oven for an extra 10 minutes (turned down to 300) while I prepared everything else.  I've never been able to roast potatoes correctly- they always burn and never become tender.  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe gets 5 stars with the changes I made. I used a 2 lb. bag of small red potatoes and cut them in quarters. I used one medium onion, chopped. I think next time I will use two whole white onions because they were so delicious in the mixture. They don't even taste like onions, they just taste like carmelized goodness when they are done cooking. I made extra sauce, 6 tbsp. butter, 3 tbsp. honey, 1 tbsp. dry mustard, 2 pinches salt and 3 pinches pepper. I baked them for 20 minutes then tossed them to coat and put back in for 20 more minutes. I then took them out and tossed to coat again, sprinkled with more salt and dried basil and put back in for 10 minutes. They were absolutely amazing and we finished them offf between 4 people and my 1 year old in one meal. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is an excellent recipe which I have made twice recently.  It was a hit at my
Father's Day brunch and again at a Canada Day dinner.  It received raves by all
my guests at both functions.  I did stir and baste the potatoes more frequently
than the recipe calls for and they got a lovely golden color with a beautiful sweet
glaze.  They are an excellent side dish for just about any kind of meal.  It is my
new most favorite potatoes recipe.  Try it---you'll like it!

I made a one dish meal with these potatoes and browned boneless, skinless chicken breasts. After browning the chicken breast in a large cast iron skillet, I stacked them in the center, put the potatoes around, and poured a double recipe of the  sauce over all. So, we had Honey Roasted Potatoes and Chicken. It was amazing!

Excellent.  A safety caution if broiling at the end to brown the potatoes.  Ceramic and glass ovenware may shatter under a broiler.  Use a metal cookie sheet or pan if broiling.

Won't give this five stars because I made too many changes but I'll give it four stars to keep the rating high so people try it. With these changes, this recipe is easily in my top 10 greatest recipes from this site. I took the advice of one reviewer who said she boiled the potatoes first. I used a pound of small red skinned potatoes. I cut them small, into bite-sized pieces then boiled until just fork tender. In a sauce pan I sauteed about 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped onion in 2 Tablespoons butter until onion was soft. Then I added four Tablespoons of honey to the saucepan, two teaspoons of ground mustard and two more tablespoons butter. I stirred until the honey and butter formed a thin sauce. I poured the sauce over the potatoes in a 9X13 sprayed with Pam. I generously sprinkled Red Robin seasoning over the potatoes. I cooked at 385 for about 20 minutes, stirring twice and drizzling probably one additional teaspoon of honey over the potatoes to taste. These did not stick to the pan, they did not get greasy or too sweet. They were GREAT. My 2 year-old usually won't eat potatoes but she gobbled these up. If you're looking for crispy edges, etc. this isn't it. You'd have to let them cook for probably close to an hour to get that. These came out almost like sweet home fries & would go great with dinner or even a nice brunch. This will become a regular in my household. Thanks for the inspiration recipe.

Thought these would be too sweet for our taste, but I was SO wrong.  What flavor!  One comment...I cooked the potatoes for a full hour (at least) and they came out with nice, crispy skins.  Perfect as a side dish for Thanksgiving.  These potatoes will definitely be on MY menu.

I didn't change a thing.  Of course, I ALWAYS want to make something the way it is written before I suggest changes or criticize.  We loved this with the salmon I served with it.  The only thing I did was use red onion instead of yellow or white because it's what I had on hand.  When the dish was done, I covered with foil and let it rest until the salmon was done.  The flavors seems to blend even more. Hubby wants me to make this again--soon!  Thanks for sharing this one!

Delicious! I thought it might be too sweet, but it wasn't at all. I doubled all seasonings, honey, butter, etc., and tossed potatoes in it beforehand. Definitely needs to be cooked an hour. They turned out delicious AND beautiful!! I will make these again and again! Thanks!

We loved this dish.  I followed other reviewers and for 1 pound of potatoes I used 2 TBS onion and butter, 3 TBS honey, 2 tsp mustard.  I mixed it all together in bowl then added to potatoes to coat. I then placed them in a single layer on tin foiled covered cookie sheet (sprayed foil with cooking spray).  I cooked them uncovered for 35 minutes, broiled on low for 3 minutes and they came out perfect!!

This was a decent recipe, good, but nothing outstanding.  I reduced the butter a wee bit, while increasing the honey, just so they weren't too greasy as some reviewers noted not needing the butter at all.  The honey does not 'stick' and caramelize on the potatoes.  I did broil for a couple of minutes at the end to get the a bit crispier.  As I said, good recipe, not offensive, just not a ton of flavour.

I love these potatoes.  I will definitely increase the sauce for next time.  Rather than drizzle over the potatoes, I toss them in the honey/butter mixture in a bowl, then pour into my baking dish.

These potatoes came out just perfect! Not only were they tender and extremely flavorful, but they complimented my pork chops to the "T". This will definitely go into the side dish rotation!

I thought these potatoes had a good flavor, but not enough flavor. Cooking them on 375 for 35 minutes just wasn't enough time to really get the sauce to stick to the potatoes. We like our potatoes a little crispy so next time I think I'll cook them on 400 for at least 45 minutes and may possibly double the sauce.

I too followed the advice of previous reviewers by spicing the potatoes up a bit with some garlic powder (minced would have burned) and dicing them into smaller pieces.  I served the potatoes with a roasted pork tenderloin and the sweetness of the honey complimented it well. Thanks : )

I waited entirely too long to write a review for this recipe, but I do remember these potatoes are very good and they do go well with just about any entree.  The ranch potaotes on this site are as equally delicious and a great side dish with brisket.

As a vegan, I used olive oil instead of butter, and rice syrup in place of the honey. New baby red potatoes worked wonderfully as I did not have regular red potatoes, and the cooking time was perfect for their small size. I did add a bit more mustard and onion, along with some fresh dill. The sweetness paired with the onion and mustard truly complemented the dill flavor.

Delicious. Used 3 Tbls. honey and 2 tsps. dry mustard. Saved time by boiling the potatoes for 8 mins. and then cut them into bite sized pieces. Baked for 30 mins. until tender. They would have needed alot more baking time if not boiled before.

Good stuff.  Wasn't sure about the honey at first but when all was said and done it was fabulous.  I did, however, have to bake mine for an extra 25 min it seems.

Good recipe and good idea. I think the longer you bake them the better them get. My family likes when they begin to brown so if you are like us give yourself 50 minutes to make these.

These were great!  My whole family really liked them.  I'm giving it a 4 only because they aren't real diet friendly, but otherwise they'd be a 10.  Try em, you'll like em.  :)

These are wonderful. To speed up baking time, i partially cooked these in the microwave first for a few minutes then cut them up. I think the sauce absorbed into the potatoes doing it this way as well.

Really good.  I roasted the potatoes uncovered in my NuWave Oven and then added the honey butter during the last 5 minutes of cooking time.  For the butter mixture, I placed a thinly sliced clove of garlic in a small dish along with the butter, honey, and dry mustard and heated the mixture in the microwave just enough to soften the garlic, about 30 seconds.  I served the potatoes with roasted chicken, greens and cornbread.  A very good combination.

Great flavor - a little different and so easy.  I cut potatoes into 1/8 and boiled in salted water for 5 min. prior to baking for 20 min.

This was very good.  Only added some garlic pepper and cayenne pepper to the butter mixture before tossing.  I had my oven on 425 to make sure they got some crispy brown spots, like my family likes.  Thanks for a great recipe

These were decent, but not the best I've ever had. Ever since I stumbled upon this recipe, I've had a taste for it. Since I was serving a sweet-spicy main dish, I felt these would complement it perfectly. To my dismay, my potatoes were quite bland (there was no flavor to "complement" the main entree...). I'm not sure what I did wrong (?). I doubled everything because 1 lb. of potatoes isn't much (we're BIG potato eaters!). I read a majority of the most helpful reviews beforehand, but resisted the temptation to make significant changes. Having said that, I did make a couple minor ones. I added 1/4 t cayenne pepper to my potatoes and GENEROUSLY s&p'd them rather than adding just a pinch" of both (FYI, salt helps keep potatoes moist). Despite the most helpful reviewer suggesting that the butter made her potatoes greasy, I decided to not tinker with the amount called for and am really glad I didn't. It's the butter that gives these such a rich flavor. On the flipside, oil would help these crisp up better, but then again, you lose some of the richness. What didn't burn on my foil-lined baking sheet didn't coat my potatoes at all. The butter/honey mixture was watery, not "sticky" as it needed to be. :( This is problematic because butter lends WONDERFUL flavor, but doesn't "glaze" well. I must say, the smell of the butter mixture over my uncooked potaotes was DIVINE. I just wish they would have tasted as good as they smelled. Thanks for sharing anyways, STEPHNDON! :-)

Absolutely the best.  I made this twice and the best way was on my Pampered Chef large stone bar pan.  The potatoes crisped nicely and had a beautiful color.  Small petite potatoes are best but it did work with regular russets.

These were so awesome.  I didn't change a thing except added more than a pinch of salt.  Once I poured the sauce over the potatoes I mixed to make sure they were nice and coated.  And then did the same twice during baking.  My baking time was 45 minutes.  PERFECTO!  Will be making this plenty in the future.

3 STARS AS WRITTEN...5 STARS AFTER CHANGING THE PROPORTIONS.  I made it as written with 1.15 pounds of potatoes-I weighed it, but with double the sauce.  When I stired it halfway through, I tasted a potato and it was pretty bland.  I ended up adding about 2 TBS more honey, and 2 TBS more of the dry mustard.  THEN it was great.  Nice and different, not just roasted potatoes with rosemary.  I followed other's suggestions and used a dark non stick pan and then broiled for about 5 minutes at the end.  My suggestion is to put your potatoes in a ziplock bag then use that to get the sauce all over them.  I also tried marinading them in the sauce for a bit first, but it wasn't great until the extra seasonings were added and it was broiled.

I prefer my potatoes mashed or fried, so I had to turn to Mr. LTH for help rating these.  He said "they're good" and gave them a "4".  They were quick and easy to prepare, yet mine did take longer than the recced cooking time.  I tried a couple of bites and didn't get a strong sense of the honey/butter sauce flavor, so I think I'll increase next time.  Thanks for a change from the same old baked potato!

Super tasty...but I read in other reviews that they could be a little dry and also took more time in the oven.  So...I cut the potatoes in smaller pieces and sauteed them with the onions in olive oil until hot through and starting to soften before putting them in the oven.  I also used prepared mustard instead of dry.  This seemed to be a solution for both issues and they were a wonderful accompaniment to my spice rubbed baked chicken.

I thought they were very tasty.  The sweetness was a nice touch.  The pan was a messy clean-up - tin foil may be good here.  I would not change a thing.

These were really delicious! Minor changes: I added a little more honey than called for, a shake or two of cayenne pepper for a little more spice, and I mixed everything together before throwing it in a greased baking pan. When the potatoes had about 10 minutes left to cook, I drizzled just a bit more honey on top. They came out a little spicy, a little sweet, and very yummy. Thanks for sharing!

I wanted to like these, but honey & potatoes just don't do it for any of us in this house.  I thought we'd like 'em, but the honey taste & potatoes just were odd together.  The mustard flavor dimiishes as the honey stays strong.  Sweet is the predominant flavor for sure.

I loved this recipe! I have been looking for a good go to roasted red potato recipe, and this will be it. Other roasted red potato recipes I have tried have come out too oily or the added herbs are too dominant. This glaze just lightly flavored the potatoes. So, they would work really well, as a side dish, with any type of meat. I lined a square pan with two sheets of foil, sprayed it with cooking spray, and then followed the rest of the recipe as stated. My red potatoes were a little large, so I cut them in half and then cut the halves in about 1/2" slices. The recipe indicated to bake them for 35 minutes. My oven is calibrated correctly, and I baked them for 50 minutes, and they may have just been done. Another 5 minutes would have been perfect. The only thing I will do different, is double the recipe next time to get more than the about 3 servings. Thanks!

Very tasty.  Will add to my "must make for company" list. The honey-mustard-onion flavour combination is excellent. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have red potatoes, so I used regular ones and am quite happy with the result.

Pretty dang good. I would definitely double the sauce mixture next time. And make sure you mix it a few times during cooking. Also someone's suggestion of broiling them for a few minutes at the end gives the potatoes a great texture. Delicious.

I love roasted red potatoes in just about every way, but my husband prefers a good old fashioned baked russet. I've been trying to find a recipe he'll tolerate without whining. I made these to go with a roast chicken, and my husband was about to drown them in gravy. I told him to try a bite first because they had a distinct flavor already. He took a bite, paused for a moment, and said "These ARE good...best potatoes ever!" He got seconds and thirds, raved about them to his friends, and requested that I serve them when his parents visit in a few weeks. And I agree with him, they are outstandingly delicious! I cut them in small bite sizes, coated them with a drizzle of honey and a generous amount of salt, pepper, dried parsley, and some garlic powder, and then mixed about two tbsp of honey with 1 tbsp of melted butter and coated the potatoes and onions with that mix. I roasted them in a foil lined pan for 20 min covered and then about 25 min uncovered. I poke-checked and stirred about every 10 min after they were uncovered. They caramelized beautifully, and had a wonderful texture.

Loved these potatoes.  I agree with other raters that you need to double the sauce recipe.  I made with Yukon and they came out fine!

These potatoes were nothing special. I really didn't get much sweetness out of the honey so I would have used at least 3 Tbl next time to give them some kick. I would also have oped for fresh course ground mustard to use instead of the dry.

I think as written, this recipe needs a bit of work.  I used about 4 medium potatoes and cut them into 1" pieces and placed in a foil lined 8x8 pan.  I tried to make exactly as written, but ended up doubling the honey and shaking salt over the entire pan pretty heavily.  Broiling for 4-5 minutes helped crisp these up, but i much prefer some of the other roasted potato recipes on this site.  My toddler wouldn't eat more than a couple of bites, that means it's not a keeper for me.

These were fabulous! I took advice and doubled the butter/honey mixture. And instead of drizzling I tossed it - that's just easier for me. I think it could do with less butter, but stick with 2T of honey - that sweetness is heaven.

Like some reviewers said, "it's nothing to write about...very bland and no taste". I personally like the lipton onion soup mix on potatoes along with garlic.

Simply delicious! I boiled the potato for 5 minutes first and then I baked them. I doubled the honey and butter ingredients, too. These were really, really, REALLY great!! My family and I thoroughly enjoyed these!!! Will keep on rotation!!

This is one of those rare recipes where the prep
time is minimal and the payoff is maximum! I went
by the recipe except I doubled the honey and the
onion. Also, as others have noted the cooking time
is a little off, mine took 55 minutes at 400º. This is
truly a five star recipe and highly recommended!

Excellent!  I took suggestions of other reviewers to 1) double the amount of sauce 2) add a little extra onion & dry mustard and 3) cut into smaller pieces (depending on the size).  I reserved half the sauce and added it in the last 10 minutes.

This was very good.  I substituted olive oil for butter to make it a little healthier and yellow mustard for dry mustard since I did not have the dry.  I increased the honey and mustard by about 1 1/2  and decreased the oil to about 1 Tbsp.  This was enough to cover the potatoes and not make them too oily when done baking. I stirred every 6 minutes or so and broiled on hi for the last few minutes to brown the potatoes a little.  Yum!  My husband and I both liked this recipe quite a bit.  I will be making it again I'm sure.

WOW!  These are great.  I use whatever potatoes I have lying around, and I have so far only used vidalia onions, cut larger and in bigger quantities than called for in the recipe.  The honey mustard mixture is really good and these always seem to turn out well.

Awesome recipe!!!  My kids said it was the best potatoes I ever made.  A major hit! The only thing I did differently was finish frying them in a skillet because they were too watery and weren't getting brown enough.

These potatoes were great with fish!  I added a few cloves of garlic, baked it for 25 minutes covered, then added some shredded mozzarella cheese to the top of the last 10 minutes, uncovered.  I'll definately make it again some time!

This is absolutely one of the best recipes I've gotten here.  First of all, if you have, for instance, a family of four, youll need probably five pounds of potatoes!  One is simply not enough!  We also like left-overs so I always use a MINIMUM of five pounds!  I had Idaho potatoes once and just cut into 8th's.  On the advice of others here, I made extra sauce (at least double).  I also added garlic to taste and chili powder to taste to punch it up a little.  I also added about 1 tbls. of extra virgin olive oil per batch of sauce.  I mix the sauce in a larger than needed bowl.  Using a slotted spoon, I add the potatoes, a few at a time, to the bowl of sauce, coat well, and drain with the spoon.  Then I place them in the dish.  Lastly, I add the onions to the sauce and drizzle the sauce with onions all over the potatoes.  Be sure you check them and turn them as directed, or the edges burn.  My husband has requested these every week since I got the recipe.  They are wonderful.  Thanks for the great addition to our evening meal!

Excellent recipe! Make sure you cut into little pieces; Also added a lot more dry mustard and honey. Taste it before you put it on the potatoes. If it tastes right, then you are good to go. Also, put all the ingredients into a Ziploc bag so the coating is distributed evenly on every potato. I liked this so much that the leftovers were put onto a salad with some honey mustard dressing. Too good.

I was looking for a recipe to prepare red potatoes with a light flavor and found this one.  Very good with only a hint of sweetness and very easy to prepare.  I agree with others that it could use a little more seasoning.  I sprinkled a tiny amount of garlic and seasoning salt, as previously recommended - it could have used a little bit more.  I used 1-1/2 lbs. small potatoes, cut into quarters, doubled the sauce ingredients, and baked at 400º and they were ready in 35 - 40 mins.  My husband loved them.  A keeper!

After adjusting the cooking time these were great! I cooked the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes first and the alloted time still wasn't long enough. It took about 50 minutes to get a nice brown crust on the potatoes. But other than that this is a great recipe. I also used 3 T of onion powder instead of the onion (I hate chopping them and my husband won't eat them anyway) and it was fine. I added more than a pinch of salt and pepper too- more like 1/4 t each, and also added 1/8 t garlic powder. These went really well with the brown sugar meatloaf on this site.

Delicious....the only thing I changed was to partially cook them in the microwave in groups of 2 or 3 to help the cooking process.

These potatoes were the BEST.  After reading the recipe reviews, I bought the smallest red potatoes I could find and partially skinned them.  Because it looked like it took longer cooking time (according to the reviews), I cut the potatoes into about 6 or 8 pieces each and tossed the honey mixture with them, then put them in the pan and baked them.  I had a few more potatoes than necessary, so I doubled the honey mixture - didn't hurt a bit.  This recipe stays in my file...FOREVER!

This was a very easy and interesting dish. I added a little olive oil as well and was generous with the dry mustard and honey. I also roasted the potatoes for close to an hour to make them very soft and tender. The resulting carmelization was particularly delicious, and I would highly recommend it with the honey and pecan glazed pork chops, and lightly steamed, plain fresh green beans.

Very good.  So easy to do!  Next time I'd use a little more mustard but even still they were good!

Husband said give it a five so here it is. I would use foil under the potatoes and also mix them up once during the cooking or coat them in a bowl before you put them on the pan.

So today I was trying to find a different potato recipe because my man is a meat and potato's kind of guy and I can only handle mashed potato's so many times. I tried this recipe and I am so happy that I did because these were the most amazing potato's ever! I did read the reviews before I made them and I did 2lbs of potato's, 2 medium onions, 6 Tbsp of butter, 3 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp of mustard(din't have dry so I used the already made kind)and then seasoned as I saw fit. Best potato's ever! Very pleased and going in my recipe box!

I used this as a base recipe to replicate some restaurant potatoes I ate recently. I didn't measure anything, increased the honey, used onion powder instead of onion, and added minced garlic and garlic powder. Overall, I am pleased and will definitely make these again!

Easy, requires no tweaking, tasty, and a really good side dish for just about anything.  If you feel like being fancy, you can add other things as well but it totally doesn't need it.

Simple and tasty.  I sometimes use djion mustard in place of the powder and I also add seasoned salt.  Definitely mix up several times throughout cooking to keep the butter mixture evenly distributed.  I think this side dish is a good accompaniment to slightly fancier entrees.  I wouldn't serve it with hamburgers etc.. but I think it's worked well with honey mustard pork chops, garlic and herb roasted pork loin and chicken marsala.

Fun to make something different.  My 5 year old loved it too.  My husband took a pause & said, "It's slightly sweet but really good.  You'll have to make these again."  I only added a little more salt & used cracked black pepper to our taste.  I doubled the recipe too.

Okay I was NOT a fan. I will admit that I didn't have dry mustard so I had to use prepared mustard. But surely it wouldn't of altered the recipe THAT MUCH. These potatoes didn't have near enough taste for me and they didn't have a good aroma while cooking... AT ALL. I won't make again. I am sticking to my standby roasted red potato recipe... an onion packet of soup and olive oil... simple and much tastier!

These were easy and good with a simple dinner, they did lack the sweet honey pop my husband was hoping for though. I may do them again, but tweak it to be a little more jazzy....

Wow! Everyone had seconds and thirds. My toddler couldn't keep her hands out of the bowl. I cut my reds into small bite size pieces and doubled the sauce. There was just enough on it. I also put it under the broiler for a min or two. This will permanently replace my "onion soup" potatoes.

So delicious!!! My whole family (even 4 & 5 year old) loved it! There was not a single piece left. Only thing I did different is cooked it for 40 minutes with foil covering the potatoes (suggested by another review) and added Parmesan cheese on the top while it cooked.

Oh my gosh!  These are so good!  I used garlic instead of onion, and they were to die for!  My son loved them, and the BF (who doesn't like potatoes...I know he's odd!) even liked them!  **Edit: I have made these a couple of times, always using fresh garlic, and just adding onion powder.  I use just a little dijon mustard instead of mustard poweder, and sometimes I add parsley.  This really is a nice change from mashed/scalloped or even regular herb and cheese roasted potatoes that I seem to always do.

These were really good!  Very much enjoyed a new taste on roasted potatoes.  I mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl and then dumped them into a 9x13 glass baking dish.  Turned the potatoes 3 times while roasting (little paprika on them the last time), gave them extra cooking time, about 50 mins, and then broiled for about 5 minutes to brown them up.  Delicious.

I was not a fan of these.  I wanted to try something different from regular roasted potatoes, and this combination did not do it for me.  I thought they were too sweet.

These were good but with some additions, they were excellent. I had to bake a lot longer (maybe because I used Russet Potatoes..not sure) about 50 minutes. I tripled the sauce and added a bit more honey and butter and a tad bit more salt. Also added some Basil to bring out flavor. I tasted them while cooking and they tasted great! So in order to cut down on my overall cooking time, I added two chicken breasts and threw in some shrimp too (used a pretty big pan)! Also placed on a sheet of foil for easy clean up. These were very good and will make again.

Very Good!!! Made exactly how it said to but did broil it at the end to make them a little crispy.

these were delicious! I followed the previous reviewers advice and doubled up on the butter, honey, and mustard. I also sprinkled a little garlic salt with parsley on top and stirred every 15-20 minutes during baking, for a total cook time of 40 minutes.

These were good.  They're a bit sweet, but good.  I cut them into quarters and boiled them until about half cooked.  Slapped 'em in a baking dish, poured the sauce over them, and voila.  We all liked them.

Everyone LOVED these potatoes.  I doubled the honey, butter, mustard mixture, but didn't put the salt and pepper in the mixture.  I put the potatoes and onions in a bowl, tossed with 1/2 the butter mixture then put in the baking dish and salt and peppered the top.  Then I baked til half done, added the rest of the butter mixture and stirred.  I stirred the pototoes a total of about 4 times during the cooking to make sure everything was well glazed.  I might experiment with a few red pepper flakes or cayenne for the sweet-hot effect, but they are awesome as they are.

A few alterations:  I doubled the butter, honey, mustard and S&P, then, due to being paranoid about not-fully-cooked potatoes, I cooked 20 minutes at 375º and another 15 at 425º.  Excellent and turned out even better the next morning as homefries!

These were easy & delicious! My husband is a basic meat & potato man. These were just different enough that I enjoyed them and so did he! I did up the amount of honey to 1 T. And added additional salt. Also finished them under the broiler for about 5 to 10 min. Turning every few min. To just carmelize the honey! Yummmmmmo!

I heart potatoes. I heart new ideas with potatoes. I tend to tweak a recipe with what I have in the house-I used Gulden's Spicy Mustard instead of a dry mustard- and sweet vidalia onions-and oh my, what a nice kick it added. I will be keeping this one in my rotation! Very yummy!

My family really enjoyed these. I was worried about them being dry so after I cut them, I put them in a storage bag with olive oil and shook them until they were covered. I then place them in a single layer on a corningware dish and cooked them for 5 minutes in the microwave and then transfered them to the oven. This cut down on the baking time.

This recipe was delicious.  Since I love sauces and seasonings, I doubled the butter mixture.  I also added baby carrots and I chopped more than 2TBSP worth of onions.  My husband love it.

This is a great recipe.  The first time I made it, I was out of onion and it was still very good.  The last time I made it, I did it all on the stove top.  I boiled the potatoes, cooked the onions in a little bit of butter till translucent, then added the potatoes and sauce to the pan and cooked until the sauce got gooey and carmelized a little bit.  I think I like it better this way.

yum, we really enjoyed this recipe! no changes were made aside from cutting my potatoes into eighth & using an entire small onion. i also combined all of the ingredients in a bowl for a good coating before spreading the potatoes out on a baking sheet. many thanks stephanie!

This recipe sounded so good, but unfortunately it did not go over well with my family today.  They didn't taste bad, actually there was barely any flavor at all.  However, I do think the key to this recipe is the SIZE of your potatoes.  Cut them SMALL, otherwise they taste bland.  It also took me double the time listed to cook.  I will give these another try...will cut way smaller than I did and double the sauce.

These were good, but I doubled the sauce part, and needed to cook mine (which were even cut smaller) about double the time, I will make again using a higher temp as suggested by another, and mix at least once during baking, but I had a sleeping baby on me and couldn't do that. But they were good and with a few adjusts as mentioned would be even better, thank you for this recipe :)

These turned out great.  I took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the honey mixture.  I think you could triple it and still have it taste great (of course, I have quite the sweet tooth!)  I added garlic powder and cooked it for about an hour.  Turned out great!  Thanks

I did like others said and added more spice. I used 3 TBSP HONEY, 3 tsp GROUND MUSTARD, some garlic salt and garlic powder, 5 TBSP BUTTER, salt and pepper........YUMMY!
 
I cooked them on 375 degrees for about 50-55 minutes. Turned them twice, once after 20 minutes, and then after another 20 minutes.
I used a more expensive thicker honey. It glazed the potatoes very nicely. And they were not too sweet! My boyfriend LOVED them, and I did too. THANKS!

Tasted Great! Would double the sauce. I didn't have dry mustard so I used some honey-dijon.  The only downfall is it took so long to cook.  At least an hour and 10 mins.  I would cut up in smaller pieces next time.

I made this recipe a few days ago for my boyfriend and his parents.  They were a side dish to grilled steaks.  It went over very well!  As suggested by previous posters, I doubled the amount of "sauce", cut the potatoes smaller instead of just quartering them, I tossed the potatoes with sauce in a bowl, and roasted them for an hour instead of just 35 minutes. 

I thought the taste was just a touch too sweet.  So when I do it again, I will try more mustard, less honey, and maybe some garlic or even some tabsco sauce for a sweet yet spicy kick!  Anyway, this recipe is great!

This is a really good recipe.  The potatoes have a slightly sweet flavor that went really well with apricot chicken (a recipe also from this site).  My husband absolutely loved them!

I thought these were delicious; however, my husband and stepson thought the potatoes were only okay (I may have used too many potatoes than called for). I will definitely be making these again and using the correct amount of potatoes.

I took this delicious dish to my brothers' house for Christmas dinner, and I was a BIG hit! In fact I was informed that I did not bring enough potatoes! I guess next time I will have to double the recipe! Thank you for another great addition to my recipe box!

The flavor is really great however the cooking time needs to be increased since the potatoes were very undercooked after 30 minutes.  I would also probably add a little more of the dry mustard.  My family loved the honey flavor though and I would make them again since they are so easy!

Made this recipe with only one small change - I used onion powder instead of real onions (I'm not much for the texture) and they turned out amazing. We did have too cook them for a bit longer than stated but that is most likely due to our old oven. Great side dish for almost any main. Thank you so much for sharing!

This recipe was simple and easy to make. The honey adds a mild sweetness but nothing overwhelming. I made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out great. I will be making this again.

These were yummy! My only suggestion would be to reduce the butter as there was a bit too much of it for my liking. The honey gave them a nice flavouring, without being to sweet. I will definitely be making these again.

It is a easy recipe. I doubled the recipe for my family. I made as written except I mixed everything together including the onion. Then poured over potatoes and mixed well. I did change the cooking temperture to 425. I cooked them for 40mins. I did stir maybe  4x's  so they wouldn't stick. I will make them again.

Simple and tasty way to prepare potatoes.  I liked the slightly sweet quality, but found I wanted a little bit more seasoning on them - they were just a touch bland for our household.  But thanks for a good base recipe, would make again and toss some other spices in there.

I used russet potatoes because that is what I had on hand.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The potatoes took exactly 45 minutes to become fork tender.  Excellent with roast pork tenderloin.  Will be making these again and again.

I fixed these on the grill and they were awesome.  Next time I will add more onions as their flavor was really, really good.  I did not have dry mustard so used French's instead and it tasted fine.

These are yummy.  I preboiled them for about 5 minutes (based on another review.)  I put the potato slices in the honey/spice bowl to cover them well.

I liked the sound of this, and was expecting something great, but it just tasted like potatoes with honey- not really all that appetizing. No one ate them. I may try again, maybe browning the potatoes instead, like home fries, and only adding a bit of honey at the end.

Maybe I am a rather novice cook but I followed instruction quite tightly. I think it is rather bland like others said, but suppose that's a personal preference. The cooking time is definitely off. I am sure my oven is accurate in terms of temperature because with any other dish esp. cakes I had no problems at all. 35 minutes on this dish the potato is only half-cooked (with white bits in the middle (and I had quite small red potatos which I cut in 6th, not quarters). It does not have the soft/tender with lightly charred honey glazing feeling which I had hoped for. I am thinking I will try some suggestions of boiling the potatos first.

I was skeptical about these potatoes but indeed delicious as everyone says! I used shortening as the grease instead of butter, onion powder, dijon mustard, honey, and just kept stirring.

AWESOME!  I am not a potato person but these will now be made often.

Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I felt it needed to be changed a bit for my taste.  

Did not add the onions because I wanted the flavor of the honey to come out.  Also I added 1 tsp of minced garlic.  So you can called these Honey Garlic Roasted Potatoes.

These are just amazing and everyone loved them.  You have to try.

These were a big hit at my dinner the other night. The only word of advice I will give is really make sure the potatoes are in one layer or you will have very crispy unflavored potatoes a the top and very flavorful ones at the bottom. I mixed them up and reheated them and the flavor got more equally distributed the second time.

Good but not great.  Perhaps I just wasn't ready for the honey mustard taste.  I used honey dijon and added some parsley.  Also, I broiled this dish at the end for 3-4 minutes to give it a good look with a little thicker skin at the end.

Great! I did use more honey (about 2.5T), 1T prepared mustard since I didn't have dry, and I sprinkled the salt and pepper over all of the potatoes.

These weren't bad or great, just okay.  I added more onion than called for.  I baked covered for 30 minutes then un-covered for an additional 20 minutes.  They weren't crunchy but could have been in the oven for another 10 minutes.  Everyone sprinkled garlic powder once on their plates.  It still was missing something.

These were delicious!  Doubled the recipe, baked for about 45 min, broiling the last 5.  Will definitely make again when the kitchen is overrun with potatoes from the garden!  :)

all  ingredients were wonderful - doubled the recipe and roasted 35 minutes at 375 degrees - turned potatoes over then  raised temp to 400 and roasted an additional 10 minutes.  we love roasted potatoes well done - crispy.

Great recipe!!  I made a few changes. I used 3 tablespoons of honey, 6 tablespoons of butter, I used cayenne pepper instead of dry mustard.  I also used pik-mix instead of just chopped onion. It took a bit over an hour to cook.  Next time I will try to broil the dish for the last 5 minutes to crisp them. I stirred the potatoes every 20 minutes.

I have made these about 3 times. There are never enough. People get 3rds and 4ths. I used onion powder instead of onions due to some not liking the texture. I also pulled it out a little early and drizzled straight honey on it just to add a little bit more sweet. This is a huge hit!

These made for a tasty side dish for kabobs on the grill.  I tossed the sauce with the potatoes in a bowl and then poured them onto a baking sheet lined with foil and sprayed with oil.  They cooked up perfectly in the stated time.

Mild, sweet flavour. Cut thick slices of onion, rather than dicing it, so it wouldn't burn. Cooked at 425ºF for 35 minutes.

These turned out better than I expected. I used regular russet potatoes because it was what I had on hand and that worked fine. After reading several helpful suggestions I added cayenne but kept the dry mustard, used garlic salt instead of salt, and doubled the glaze. 3o mins mixing halfway through and broiling for 4 mins or so on high and they turned out perfect. I didnt parboil or microwave them first. I think the trick is to broil after so they crisp up. These were the perfect side for pork balls and sauerkraut also from this site. Update: made these again with carrots. Had to bake them at 400 this time to go along with my chicken. Worked fine

JUST SUPERB!!!!  WAS NOT SURE HOW HONEY WOULD TASTE ON POTATOES AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE MIGHT NOT LIKE THEM, BUT WITH THE GREAT REVIEWS THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH A TRY.   SO GLAD WE TRIED THEM.   I ALSO USED CAYENNE PEPPER IN PLACE OF THE DRY MUSTARD(AS ANOTHER REVIEWER SUGGESTED)   BUT ONLY TRIED 1/2 TEASPOON JUST TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE BITE!!    I THINK THEY ARE EVEN BETTER IF YOU LET THEM SIT A FEW MINUTES AFTER BAKING TO THICKEN UP THE SAUCE AS MINE DID.    THEY ARE SO GOOD AND MY FAVORITE NEW WAY TO MAKE POTATOES.    LOVED THEM.    MIGHT USE THEM WITH EASTER HAM JUST FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF SPICE FOR DINNER.     THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!!!

I have used this recipe for years. I boil my potatoes whole, with the skin on for about 5-7 mins. let cool and cut in half. Place skin side down till golden brown. I also use garlic salt instead of regular salt and parsley.

Yum! I made these potatoes for dinner along with two other dishes from this site (Salmon with creamy dill sauce and parmesan asparagus). A delicious, quick and easy meal to prepare after work! I realized (last minute) that I didn't have any dry mustard so I replaced that with crushed red pepper flakes to give the potatoes a sweet & spicy flavor. It was excellent! I recommend trying it if you are a fan of a little "kick". Also, my potatoes needed to bake much longer than the time given. I used about 10 small-mediumish potatoes and they baked for nearly 55 minutes before they were done. Excellent recipe and definitely a keeper!

Love these and everyone who has tasted them also enjoys them.  Before baking I boil the potatoes for five minutes as someone else suggested. I put them in a mixing bowl and toss in one package of dry onion soup mix. I too doubled the sauce. I add half the sauce at the beginning and the other half midway through baking.

Yummo!  A great side dish with stuffed chicken breasts, pork chops, etc.  I'm greedy so I added more butter and honey and my husband (who is a picky eater) begs me to make them.  I cook them about 50 minutes and in the last few minutes I turn it up to Broil to brown them up a bit-make these (you won't regret it)

Made this as part of our new years dinner.  Yummy way to Dr. up red potatoes.  Used a whole bag of small petite red potatoes.  Used 1/8 of onion and cut into small chunks.  Combined and spread on a foil covered baking sheet-ungreased.  Next, combined butter as suggested and eyed the honey (used Palmetto honey)  but pretty sure it was about tripled as to what the recipe called for.  Mixed in 1 tsp of cayenne as we love spicy with sweet.  Drizzled on potatoes.  Don't worry about covering every potato, as you will be turning them during the cooking process.  Sprinkle with kosher salt and ground pepper.  Cook as directed, rotating once or twice during cooking process.  Broil additional 5-10 minutes to brown.

I doubled this recipe for my family of five. I used a jellyroll pan lined with aluminum foil and coated with cooking spray. Otherwise, the honey makes the mixture sticky and clean-up time consuming. Even the kids liked this one. Thanks!

These were a hit! So much better than plain roasted potatoes!  I used 2 tablespoons of melted butter and 2 tablespoons of honey, along with a squirt of regular mustard.  I think I might add even more of the mixture next time but these were great like this!

As is it isn't very good.  I will make it again but I will have to quadruple the mustard and honey quantities for a flavorful roast.  I think with modifications it could be good.

My kids loved the potatoes. The honey adds a nice sweet glaze to the potatoes so that my kids didn't even use kethcup. Will make again.

Wonderful recipe! I boiled the potatoes for 5 minutes before putting them in the oven since someone had recommended to do so the potatoes would soak the flavor in. I also put 2 TBS honey instead. I did not have dry mustard so I put a pinch of cayenne pepper and it came out sweet and spicy...perfect!  Halfway through I added another batch of the honey, pepper, butter mixture over the potatoes. The last 5 minutes I broiled them and the were amazing!

I doubled this, using 2 lbs of new potatoes. But I didn't double the amount of mustard. (not a mustard fan and wasn't sure if I'd like that) They turned out really well. Next time I may cut the butter in half. I think that would work just fine and save on fat and calories. This is a good recipe.

A definite crowd pleaser. Made it for dinner yesterday night along with lamb chops with balsamic reduction (also from this site) & a side of wilted greens and my children were asking for seconds. The pot was licked clean! Thanks for sharing. ...the only change i made was I did boil the potatoes al dente first. A real keeper especially if you dont feel like mashing potatoes after work..hehe

As other reviewers have advised I used 5 Tbls. butter, 3 Tbls. honey, can substituted cayenne pepper, (1/2 teas.) for the mustard.   par boil slightly or put under broiler for a few minutes before serving  stir several times during cooking  Add a little bit of garlic powder and onion powder if to your liking

Heavenly! All the kids and the adults loved them even my 7 year old who "hates" potatoes. Increased the recipe and made a bit more of the sauce as there are 5 of us in our family. Otherwise followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing. Will be making these as a side on a regular basis. Thanks!

We have been looking for a good roasted potato recipe and this one is great. I used a little more honey just because we like our potatoes with a lot of flavor. I also took the suggestion of going under the broiler at the end since my boys like their potatoes on the crispier side.

FANTASTIC! I used yukon gold potatoes because that's what I had. Also, I subbed olive oil for the butter to make it a little healthier. I think I used more than 1 pound of potatoes, so I tripled the sauce ingredients except for the olive oil, which I left at 2 tablspoons. I also added a little garlic powder and parsley for extra flavor and used more salt and pepper than called for. I roasted them @ 350 for about 40-45 mins. and they came out perfectly glazed and golden. This recipe will become a new staple at our house! Thanks for posting. :)

These were so good!  I didn't have dry mustard so I used 2 TBS of dijon mustard, and I upped the butter to 3 TBS., the honey to 3 TBS, added 2 tsp. onion powder and about 3 TBS of olive oil.  Of course I diced about 6 large red potatoes.  I placed that potatoes in a lined 11x17 baking sheet and topped w/ the remaning ingredients.  I baked for 50 minutes and finished under the broiler for about 3 minutes.  I served w/ grilled filet mignons and roasted aparagus w/ parm. cheese.  It was a most excellent meal, and I highly recommend this recipe.  Do try the dijon mustard as it gave the potatoes a zippy taste.

I make these all the time and can't believe I haven't rated it. I use less butter and broil for last 2 minutes or so to get them nice and caramelized. Crunchy! Delicious! A staple recipe.

Made this last night as one of the sides with ribs.  Very very good!  I increased the butter to 3 Tab and increased the baking time to one hour as I was making the ribs in a 350 oven.  Will be making this one often - thanks!

I am making this as I type. I used 3 tbls of butter, 10 tbls of honey, 1 tbls of dry mustard, 1 tsp of onion powder and 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  My hubby doesn't like onion in potatoes, otherwise I would have used fresh onion. I also didn't have red potatoes so I used 5 whole white ones, that I boiled with the skin on and lots of salt. I boiled them for 8 minutes. After boiling I cut them into 1 1/2in by 1 1/2in chunks, leaving the skins on.  I melted the butter, then added all the ingredients, stirred, then added the potatoes.  I used a flat cookie sheet that I covered with foil. I sprayed the foil with cooking spray. Then I spooned (with a slotted spoon) the potatoes onto the foiled pan. I covered them with foil and made lots of holes in the foil. I don't want the potatoes to steam.  I set for 45 minutes in the 375 degree oven.  After 45 min I will take out, take off the foil, pour the remaining liquid over them then cook uncovered for another 10 minutes.  After that I will stick them in the broiler for a few minutes to brown them. I will let you know how they taste!   Later: They were excellent. Hubby liked them too. He said carrots would be good cooked like this so I am going to try that too!

Delicious!  I made this for the first time for company this evening, and everyone loved it.  I had a hard time not raving about it myself!  I used 5 lbs of egg-sized red potatoes and used two shallow pans lined in foil and lightly rubbed with olive oil.  As another reviewer suggested, I boiled the potatoes for 5 minutes first then sliced them and tossed them in a bowl with 1 cup of the 1.5 cups of sauce.  I laid them out on the pans then lightly sprinkled with salt, cracked pepper and a bit of parsley.  I baked the potatoes for about 20 minutes, basting once halfway through, then basted again before broiling one pan at a time for 5 minutes each. I basted them one last time, let the oven cool slightly, then left the potatoes in to stay warm till dinnertime.  One guest commented that he could happily make a meal out of the potatoes alone.  No small compliment, since my husband had made some excellent steaks as our main course.  The mustard flavor is very subtle.  It has a sweet, savory rich flavor that is making me already look forward to the leftovers tomorrow!  Next time I will probably cut down a little on the butter.  My guess is that it will be every bit as delicious with a little less fat.

These were great, but I don't believe they would have been as good without changing in this way: half the butter, 1/2 tsp. salt, generous pepper, 1 tsp. prepared mustard (in addition to the dry mustard) and 1/4 tsp. onion powder. I also used 3 Tbs. honey, which was yummy, but next time I will try just the one Tbsp.... and a bit of cayenne.... THESE ARE GREAT LEFTOVER! They would be perfect made ahead and reheated.

I only made this recipe because the reviews were all positive, but there was NOTHING good about this recipe. There was no flavor, very boring. I wasted my red potatoes. VERY dis-appointed.

These came out so wonderful!!!  They had great color and I wish I took a photo to share.  I used 8 medium sized red skin potatoes.  I cut them in bite size pieces and layed them in a non stick roasting pan that was sprayed with PAM.  I used 3-4 T of Onion.  I also used 3 T of butter, 3-4T of honey, 3 tsp dry mustard and some extra salt and pepper.  I did have them in the over for about 50 - 60 minutes.  I kept them covered in foil for the first 20-30 minutes.  I stirred about every 15 minutes.  They were browning on side down, so you want to be sure to flip so the color is more evenly coated and so you do not burn.  If I had time I would have followed others advise of sticking them under broiler for a few minutes.  They were quite yummy.  Everyone asked what was on the potatoes?

I'm so glad I tried these. So simple, so yummy. I was a little short on potatoes but I added extra onion (used a whole yellow onion, cut into largish pieces) because we like onions. Turned out great!

This was a wonderful recipe that I cooked for my family. Everyone enjoyed it, particularly my father and brother. I would also agree that the sauce mixture needs to be doubled. I made this recipe with regular potatoes and it turned out wonderful. There were two more changes that I made: 1st I browned the onions in the sauce before drizzling it over the potatoes and 2nd I let the sauce sit with the potatoes while I finished cooking my other dishes. This might of been the reason it did only take 40 mins to cook, because the potatoes were already semi-soft.

Everyone loved this dish.  It is easy to fix, will compliment any meal, and has the best flavor.  I did bake it a little longer than the recipe stated.

I was expecting the potatoes to come out crunchy and was disappointed by that until I tasted them. They were delicious and got rave reviews by everyone. I'll be adding this recipe to my box!

These were good, I added more than a pinch of salt and pepper though. I had to cook mine a lot longer to get them nice and crisp.

These potatoes are perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. I made a few adjustments as I went along though, and I was very glad I did. First of all, the amount of honey/mustard/butter mixture is far too little to flavor all the potatoes... so I doubled the ingredients to make twice the amount of sauce. Secondly, after 35 minutes of cooking it was clear they were far from done. So I turned the potatoes over and put them back in the oven for another 20 minutes. When I took them out again, the potatoes smelled delicious and were sizzling... but the side of the potatoes not touching the sauce looked white and dry. So I turned them again, and placed back in the oven for a final 10 minutes. When they finally came out they were golden to perfection and smelled heavenly. I could not be more impressed with this recipe... these potatoes are definitely a keeper!

These weren't bad--but just average. I used new red potatoes cut in half and dounbled the sauce. Even so, they were kind of bland. I love the idea of them though, and the baked sauce tasted so good in the pan but the potatoes didnt seem to soak it up. Next time I'll try EVOO and add more mustard and honey and maybe some rosemary. I think this could be a good base recipe that just needs some tweaking.

This was pretty bland and plain.  
The honey taste came through a little bit but I definitely didn't get the carmelized consistensy from the onions or the browning of the potatoes.  Won't be making this again.

I've tried this as originally posted.  That gets 4 stars because the potatoes never got as browned up as I like.  Used the suggestion of other reviewers and used olive oil instead of the butter.  That makes it 5 stars.

I was looking for a different way to roast some baby reds and I came across this.  When I saw my good friend Nandabear liked them I know I had to give them a try....I followed the recipe and loved them!  My hubby, who doesn't like potatoes (so he says!) didn't even put ketchup on them!  Thanks for the recipe Stephanie!

I read many of the reviews before I made this dish and decided to use 1 ½ pounds of new potatoes, 3 tablespoons of melted lite butter, 3 tablespoons of honey, ½ tsp of black pepper, 1 ½ tsp of mustard, ½ tsp of salt, and 1 tsp of onion powder.  (I did not have any onion and didn’t want to go to the grocery store!)  I took the advice of another reviewer and boiled the potatoes for 5 or so minutes. I added 3/4ths of the sauce and cooked the potatoes (covered) at 375 for 25 minutes.  I then stirred the potatoes well; added the additional sauce on top and returned the dish to the oven leaving the top off.  I cooked them an additional 20 minutes.  I served this with a spicy shrimp dish and they offset each other perfectly.  My husband and two boys all went back for seconds.  Knowing that I have one child that is beyond picky and went back for another helping……Makes this a definite keeper for me.    I actually think that when I make this again….....I will cut the pieces of potatoes even smaller.  The more the sauce can absorb into the potatoes.....the better!!!

I really liked this recipe. Like others, I felt the sauce needed to be doubled, although the sauce in itself is very delicious. I also added a teaspoon Worchestire sauce which I think tasted really good. I baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and then broiled the potatoes for about ten. My husband enjoyed this.

Thanks for a different twist on oven-baked potatoes.  My family enjoyed it.  I also cranked up the heat to 400 and cooked a bit longer for a crispier skin.

I made this recipe to bring as 'the potatoes' for Christmas dinner at my brother's and everyone loved them.  I tripled the recipe and definitely agree with many others that you need to add more honey, more mustard and more butter.  I also stirred them more than once while baking so that the liquid was evenly coating the potatoes.  The honey flavor is subtle, just enough, and every bit of them disappeared! I would make this recipe again.

I followed suggestions about cutting the potatoes into smaller pieces and broiled them for fifteen minutes doubled the topping adding honey or mustard to taste and let bake till Tender. This is thee best thing I have ever eaten. Everyone loved them and there were no leftovers to enjoy the next day. Great recipe!

These were delicious and a great change from regular old potatoes. I had to cook them for 45 minutes and used scallions/green onions instead of regular onion because that's what i had on hand. I also used just a tad bit more honey than the recipe called for. They were yummy! Next time I think I'll add even more honey. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I would suggest making these with ham or chicken. They are a little too sweet to mix with a roast. I will add a little more salt next time as well.

I made a few changes to this one. First off, I used russet potatoes instead of red. I also added about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the sauce to make them a little sweeter. I then added about 1/2 c. chedar cheese at the end. Fantastic!!!

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the sauce and added a dash of cayenne.  To make the potatoes a bit crispy, I finished them off under the broiler for about 5 minutes as they weren't getting brown enough during baking (probably due to the extra sauce).  Served with Cranberry BBQ Chicken -- delicious.  Thanks!

Yummo! The texture and taste of these potatoes were great! I used 4 scallions instead of the onion, which caramelized nicely during cooking. I only had to cook them for 25 minutes, but that was because I cut them in smaller chunks (about 1/2 inch). Great recipe!

These are great.  I might double the sauce next time.  I cut the potatoes slightly smaller than stated.  covered the pan with foil for 20 mins, then uncovered for 15 mins.  nice and crunchy on the out side and tender inside

I totally changed this recipe because I don't like potatoes to be sweet  unless they are sweet potatoes.  Butter is what is causing a lot of people to end up with potatoes that aren't crispy.  Substitute extra virgin olive oil.  I used about 1 T minced garlic, 1-2 T Italian seasoning, and 1-2 tsp balsamic vinegar. I shake it all in a bag (with the oil) and pour it onto a pan lined with foil and sprayed with Pam.  I love my version and so does everyone that's tried it.  If you try it, I hope you do, too!

I bake red potatoes often so thought I'd try a different twist.  I thought they were very bland so added some rosemary during the last minutes of baking and that helped.  I won't use this recipe again, however.

I'm re-reviewing this recipe and adding another star...not sure what I did wrong the first time, but when I made them the second time they were absolutely fabulous!  I had a hard time getting them to crisp up the first time...my pieces must have been too big, because this time they came out perfect...crispy and brown on the outside and tender on the inside.  The whole family loved these and they were SO simple to make!  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect.

this was an interesting twist on a kitchen staple. The taste was surprisingly good. I reccomend this recipe if you have run out of ideas for a side dish. Make sure the potatoes are well done though!

This is a very simple (especially when you're lazy like me and buy the bag of already cut potatoes) and yummy recipe that is VERY easy to tailor to meet your tastes. Personally, I like a LOT of onion, so I used almost a full onion. I also threw in a bit of garlic, and I also used more pepper than called for.

I quadrupled the sauce recipe. The one problem with doing this is that the potatoes can become very oily. I would recommend doubling/tripling the mustard/honey part of the sauce recipe and don't add much more butter.

Also, I would cut the red potatoes into eighths.

I love the basic recipe! I make it frequently!

These were a really good variation for red potatos. I carmelized the onion first with some garlic and also doubled the sauce which I would strongly suggest.

I doubled the coating mixture, as suggested and used olive oil instead of melted butter to lighten it up a bit.  I also tossed the potatoes in a bowl to coat them all completely with the mixture prior to putting them on the baking sheet.  This was a huge hit at my dinner party.  It's definitely a keeper!

I am a potato lover, so this was good for me just because they were potatoes...HOWEVER, I didn't taste any of the seasonings! I think they were spread too much on the cookie sheet. Next time I will just place them in a casserole dish and pour the sauce over them.

These were very good.  I followed the advice in some other reviews that said to boil the potatoes a little bit before baking, as the potatoes were not completely cooked through when just baked in the time given.  However, I found that the pre-boiling made the potatoes mushy.  I think it is much better to just bake the potatoes as stated and let them roast on their own even if it takes longer to bake.  The texture will be firmer and the flavor of the roasting will be better.  I also doubled the sauce so that the potatoes would be well coated.  The flavor was light and very good.  The recipe was a hit in my house.

While these were good, I wouldn't consider these to be outstanding.  They seemed a little bland to me.  I doctored them up with some other seasonings but still wish they had come out with a stronger flavor.  I will try these again and add more mustard.  I did follow the suggestions of others and cut them up smaller than directed.  I had no trouble with cooking time and tenderness.

Very good. I  added some additional seasoning of seasoned salt and garlic powder. I also had to adjust cooking time and temp. (455 degrees for about 45-55 min.)But they were very tasty and the honey mustard gave the potatoes just the right touch of sweetness and flavor.

These were pretty good, although they did require serious additional cooking time (I baked them at 425 for 55 min to accompany my chicken dish and some of the thicker potatoes were still undercooked)and additional flavor. I doubled the recipe for the sauce, and still found that it was a little too bland for my taste, although I do admit that I love more of a bold flavor. Even doubled, I felt that there was not enough sauce to drizzle over the potatoes, so I would recommend adding a little more.

Deliciously different!  Even my daughter, who doesn't really care for potatoes, commented on how good they were.  I did double the sauce.  I baked them covered, but removed foil toward last 15 minutes or so, and they crisped/browned nicely.

I thought this recipe needed more. Followed the directions exactly but wasn't too impressed. Maybe it needs more honey....didn't think this was sweet at all. Just ok for roasted potatoes. Will try again and add more honey and other herbs and spices.

Although I'm not used to potatoes being sweetened, this was a very pleasant flavor. It seemed the more we ate, the more it kind of grew on us. Though it tasted pleasant, I'm not sure if I would make it again. JUST ME! To me, potatoes (other than yams etc) should be savory. Thanks Stephanie. They really are very good and so moist!

These potatoes are a good change from the typical roasted potatoes with just oil and dill.  I liked the sweet taste mixed with the onions.  Next time, I will double the sauce, cut my onions much smaller (almost minced) and try to add a little tabasco sauce in with the honey.  I will also broil for the last few minutes to get a greater CRUNCH! Great recipe!

I liked this very much, but my husband and 2 teenage stepsons thought it was only "OK".  I read the reviews before making it and I used twice the amount of sauce (next time I will only use 1.5 the amount) and I had to cook the potatoes for an hour and a half.  I thought the taste was amazing, because the sauce became carmelized and tasty - not too sweet.

I made these potatoes recently with the Caramel Apple Pork Chops also here at allrecipes.  It was a great combonation.  I followed the other poster's suggestions and increased the honey used.  I'm not a big potato eater, but I enjoyed the sweetness of this recipe.  Thank you Stephanie!

This was a great twist.  I used a large roasting bag which cooked the potatoes faster and created a bit of juice to drizzle on top.

Great!  I quartered the potatoes and added a little extra honey, dry mustard regular mustard and olive oil.  I added potatoes to the sauce and coated them rather than pooring the sauce over the potatoes. Cooking time was 35 minutes.

These were good, however I sliced the potatoes and doubled the amount of sauce and I had to cook them for an hour I think the next time I will use more mustard and honey.

This is now my favorite potato recipe.  The only tweaks to the recipe were I cut the potatoes into smaller bite size pieces and put the salt and pepper directly onto potato and onions. I baked for 55 minutes and stirred mixture twice during baking. I finished by putting under broiler for additional 3 minutes. Delicious.

Yummy! I followed instructions except for two changes: 1) added 1 Tbsp stone ground mustard in addition to the dry mustard; 2) increased cook time to 45 minutes. I will definitely make again, thanks to Stephndon for sharing.

Very good, but I have changed it to suit our taste...I double the recipe, use olive oil in place of butter, and add fresh minced garlic and dried parsley.  After I cut the potatoes, I rinse and DRAIN them, and then use a paper towel to further dry them.  This helps the mixture stick to the potatoes.  I mix the oil, honey, mustard, garlic, parsley, salt and pepper in a small bowl, then pour onto the potatoes and onions in a larger bowl, mix to coat and pour all onto a foil lined baking sheet.  Stir at least once about halfway during cooking time.  Salty and sweet!

This is a terrific and easy side dish. Probably needs about 1/2 again as much sauce as called for.  I also used seasoning pepper and probably close to a teaspoon full to amp these up a bit.  Second time I made them I doubled the sauce, and when I took them out to stir them at half time, I added about two full hand fulls of thawed/fresh green beans.  Excellent.

I really enjoyed this recipe but gave it 4 stars as I had to modify it slightly. I added an extra tablespoon of honey and used 1 tbs oil not butter. Also I cooked them for an hour. Turned out fantastic.

This was ridiculously good and so easy to make. My family really enjoyed this meal. So if you're looking for a potato dish that is quick to make, delicious and not dry then try this recipe, you'll be happy you did.

I did remove the onions, trade to granulated onion. I have consistency issues with onion. They were amazing. My boyfriend eat half of a sheet pan of them before dinner, all while I was grilling chicken. I did add to much pepper but that's because I do not have a pepper mill. But still amazing !

I made sure to follow other people's advice and cut back on the amount of honey and mustard proportionally. Added 1/8th tsp of cayenne which added a bit more spice to contrast the sweetness of the honey. Will be making this on a regular basis.

I couldn't taste the mustard so I would probably increase that next time. I used olive oil instead of butter and salted generously. Very good and I will make again!

The potatoes taste good, but I could not taste the flavor as much as I would have liked.  The next time I will make more of the sauce to pour on the potatoes before cooking.

Yum! I found the addictive taste of these potatoes snuck up on me. My first bite or so, I thought "meh these are ok, a little too sweet". A few bites later I thought "you know, these are pretty good". Then before I knew it I was shovelling them in my mouth as fast as I could! I cooked them about 10 minutes longer than indicated (not sure if I *had* to, but I was waiting for the rest of dinner to finish, and I thought the potatoes were perfectly cooked when I did take them out - just starting to brown). I had them with steak and mushrooms cooked in red wine, which was a fine combination but I think these potatoes would go even better with chicken. I didn't have mustard powder so used a squirt of prepared mustard, and I forgot to buy an onion so used onion powder.  I think I would like that better than pieces of onion regardless, but that's just my preference. I urge you to try these potatoes if you don't mind adding a touch of sweetness to your dinner!

Quick, easy and delicious potatoes!  I fixed 'Honey Glazed Pork Tenderloin' and these potatoes went nicely with the meat.  I made a batch and a half so that we would have leftovers.  I didn't have red potatoes on hand, but Idaho's worked great.  The skins were nice and tender and the glaze was very good.  I also made 'Mozzarella Puffs' to go with dinner and everything tasted delish!

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now as it became an instant hit with my family when I first tried it. It's also become my go-to side dish when I'm going to have company over because it's always sure to please. I originally started with following the recipe exactly as given which was always popular, but over time have begone changing it up a bit. I now leave out the onion because my husband is picky and doesn't like finding onion in his food. I do add a little bit of onion powder for a bit of flavor, but never much. I also make extra of the honey/butter mixture so that when I stir the potatoes half way through cooking time I can drizzle a little extra on top.

If short on time I'll partially boil the potatoes before placing them in the oven to get them cooked through faster.

I have made this recipe twice now.  It is just o.k.  It is a little bland to me.  I will make again but I think I will add an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix to give it more flavor.

Had friends over last night and served these with BBQ.  They liked them and asked for the recipe :-)
I used small red potatoes but 2lbs. I took anothers advice on here and cut smaller pieces and boiled about 5 min (no longer) before tossing in the sauce before baking. Also used onion powder instead of onions.  And tripled the sauce based on others suggestions. Baked 45 min at 375.  Thanks. This is a keeper for me. We liked it a lot.

This was very good! However, I barely got to enjoy this recipe because my husband kept eating them off my plate when I wasn't looking!!

Like many others, I doubled the sauce and added a little garlic salt half way through. I also used dried minced onion because I was out of fresh onion...it was still amazing! This recipe took exactly 40 minutes in my oven at 375. This is a keeper :)

Really great stuff! If you don't have dry mustard you can always substitute prepared mustard (Dijon works best) *the ratio being 1 tablespoon prepared for every 1 teaspoon dry

Read many reviews of this recipe. Also has been frequently recommended on the buzz, now I know why. It is so good. The honey is not overpowering. I used at least 1 1/2 lb. of red potatoes, increased the butter to 3tbs. and the honey to 2tbs. Will def. make again. Baked for 45 mins., my potatoes were soft at 35 but not carmelized. Served with new england crab cakes, an ar recipe.

Great jumping off point that can easily go up to five stars with a few adjustments. After reading the reviews, I decided to increase the "sauce". I used about 6 TB olive oil instead of butter, & increased the dry mustard & honey to taste. Also used a good amount of onion powder instead of fresh onion. I had a 1 1/2 lb bag of fingerlings, which I boiled for about 10 minutes. Then I broke them up a little (like Smashed potatoes), & put them, warm, into a bowl of the prepared sauce. After letting them marinate a while, I poured them out onto the foiled/oiled baking sheet & seasoned with lots of salt & pepper. At this point, they were pretty much done (husband kept stealing them off the sheet!), but I went ahead & roasted @ 450 for around 20 minutes.  Next time I think I'll just broil them instead, to crisp them up a little.  I think dressing the potatoes while they're warm makes all the difference. That's how I do my potato salad, & warm potatoes just drink the dressing right up. Great recipe idea--thanks!

Good recipe. Just doesn't have much flavor and takes longer time in oven than recipe calls for. Extra Honey - Yes, Butter - Probably not, Broiling a must otherwise to mushy. Yes I also added extra salt. Good base recipe but needs tweeked!!!

Initially microwaved the potatoes, then finished them in the oven.
5-11-13:  This time, did them just as directed, except left them in the oven a little longer.  Tasted great, but Ann thinks there's too much butter here.
7-15-13: Ann again says there's too much butter.

Absolutely delicious!  I took the recommendation of another reviewer and broiled for the crispiness.  Next time I'll do the same recipe but double or triple the honey.  DO add salt during and after, the potatoes just suck up all the flavor.  I added parsley and pepper for color and taste.  My husband LOVES these!!!!  Made them with The Simple Whole Roasted Chicken recipe on this site.  WONDERFUL!!!!  BTW, try that roast chicken recipe, did a review on that and was the best chicken I've EVER had!

5 stars because my husband (who normally doesn't comment) said he really liked the potatoes. I had a mix of new red and new yellow potatoes (golf ball size) and cut  them into large cubes to expose more edges to the sauce. That size also baked faster and had more crispy edges.

So so so so yummy!  Hubby requests them all the time.  His father keeps bees and makes his own honey that is so much better than what we have ever bought in the store so it makes the recipe all that much better!

Not enough flavor. The mixture tasted great but wasn't enough for the potatoes. We ended up adding our regular Italian seasoning packet to give them some flavor.

These were so good!!! I omitted the onion because I don't like it, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I recommend cutting the potatoes into small chunks so they cook up more quickly; I had mine in the oven for 30-35 minutes, and the larger pieces could have used a bit more time. However, the end result was lightly sweet and buttery potatoes. Loved them!

This was really good. I doubled the sauce as suggested and I really liked the honey mustard flavor. I parboiled the potatoes to help them along and then broiled them the last few mins in the oven to give them a crispier texture.

Awesome! I sprinkled salt on the potatoes before putting on the honey mixture, and I used 3 tablespoons of honey. Everything else was done as written...super easy to make and it wasn't too much of a clean up either.

My family was put off by the strange "sweet" taste in the potatoes... we often have red potatoes that I've made for over 16 years using fresh garlic, so I think it was just unexpected!

This is also extremely tasty when you substitute Grade B Maple Syrup for the honey.  The reason for the grade B is that it has a stronger maple flavor as well as a boat load more nutrients.  Enjoy!

These turned out pretty good... I thought they seemed to lack flavor but I didn't really measure the amount of potatos I used.... so I could have been a little short on the sauce... also be sure and cut the potatos small so they are done in the 35 minutes... mine took a little longer

Very nice, thank you.
I put foil on the baking sheet and a little garlic oil just in case there was a sticking problem.
No problems. The honey mustard sauce is tasty and can be the main flavor or slightly in the background with salt (careful) and pepper more prominent. Took it to a picnic where pork loin was the starring food. It fit in and didn't get lost.

These were delicious!  I made these on the grill with my grill pan lined in foil.  I did double the honey butter mixture because I probably had more like 1.5 pounds of potatoes.  These had a great flavor and just a hint of sweetness from the honey.  I may add a little more honey next time.  I did add in more onion, about a small one, and sliced it into rings.  Great recipe, I will make again!  Thanks!

My 4 year old daughter was SO excited to try these! She thought they needed more honey, but I thought they turned out great! I served these with a spicy chicken entree and they were a perfect compliment!

I liked it, but my family did not care.  Too bad.  Thanks for the recipe though.

They were pretty okay.  They were kind of bland.  I will try again, with modifications.

These were really good!  I did as some other reviewers suggested and left out the butter and just used a little more honey.  I stirred them once or twice while they were cooking.  They did take a little longer to cook but I had two things in the oven so that's probably why.  Would definitely make again!

These are good, but my husband nor my children really ate them, so I ended up eating leftovers for several days.  They aren't difficult but aren't good enough that I'll likely make them again.  Thanks for sharing!

I had to feed 15ppl, so I made alot more than what the recipe called for.  Tip - Make extra sauce!!  The potatoes soak it up and will stick to the baking dish and fall apart if you don't.  It's a huge hit and the kids want me to add this dish to our monthly menu rotation.  Very easy and yummy!!

These were okay, I thought I'd try them instead of our usual garlic/butter/parsley red potatoes. But everyone in my family agreed they didn't really care too much for the sweet honey taste. I followed the recipe exactly.

These were good, but I had trouble getting them tender.  They were still not finished after 45 min at 375, and then the sauce had started drying out.  I will make these again, because my husband and I still liked the taste.  However, I will double up on the sauce, and maybe pre-cook the potatoes.

This was good, but there wasn't much taste of the butter/honey mixture. I will probably double the ingredients for the sauce when I make it next. They were good tasting potatoes, though. Yummy with ketchup!

Very good.  I did need to put them under the broiler for a 5 minutes to brown them a little more.  But delicious my husband and 3 yr old son loved them.

These were great!  But for my family it needed more flavor so we added more honey in the end and broiled the last 4 minutes.

These were good. I do agree with the other reviewers; the sauce should be doubled, and maybe I didn't broil them long enough, because they didn't get as crispy as I wanted, but I will make them again; the flavor was great!

Dry. Couldn't taste topping at all. Not enough "sauce" per recipe. My potatoes were not done in 35 min, but were prepared according to reciped in oven 1.5 years old that runs hot.

I made this last night and it was amazing! My kids don't care for potatoes but these they did like. I didn't have dry mustard so I substituted it with regular yellow mustard, which you can't even taste the mustard really but I am sure it gives some kind of flavor. I made a double batch because it was for my family of 6 and a friend. Everyone loved these, I will be making these again!

These were excellent.  I did add a little more of each ingredient for the coating to make sure everything was covered.  The recipe was perfect and they were easily the best roasted potatoes I've ever made.  The tiny bit of sweetness was perfect.

This didn't turn out well for me. I might try it again, because I like the idea, but I think it needs some tweaking. I did it just like the recipe said, and I ended up with soupy, mushy, weird tasting potatoes. It was the onions that did it. They totally ruined the recipe. I didn't taste the mustard at all. Next time I will roast the potatoes with a little salt and olive oil at 375 for about 1 hour. Then I will baste them lightly with a mixture of 2 tbsps honey and 1 tbsp melted butter. Then I will broil them.  The broiling idea was great.

Used cayenne pepper instead of the mustard. Tripled the honey. Line you pan with foil and save yourself a headache! Very different taste then we were used to, but after the first bite my husband were hooked. It starts with a dessert like taste, then leaves a bit of heat on the back of your tongue. Sooooo good!

These were good, but for the cook time involved I don't know if I'd make them again.  They were super easy though, and I love the combo of honey and mustard.  I used prepared mustard because my dry was old and gross.  They would probably be very tasty with some curry powder added like in Honey Baked Chicken II from this site.

served this with roasted chicken and got rave reviews. I also doubled the butter and honey, and substituted paprika for the mustard powder. i chopped up a couple of carrots too. I was a bit worried when i did a taste test, because the honey hadn't become a glaze yet, but put it back in the oven for a little longer and it came out fine.

I doubled the "sauce" and used it on purple, red and white potatoes cut into bite size pieces.  Very good!

Delish!  This was an awesome side dish.  Loved the sweetness of the honey.  I used basil instead of rosemary and that is the only change I made.  Next time I will double the sauce. Loved it!

Very good recipe!  Used new red potatoes and added some paprika which aides in browning, did not find these to be greasy as some others reported.  A real keeper! Used non-stick aluminum foil, very easy cleanup.

These were pretty good!  I had a few red potatoes that needed to be used up and found this recipe.  I didn't know how the honey would be in it but it was pretty good.  Not too over-powering.  Will make these again.

I made this recipe last night for dinner along with baby back ribs and corn on the cob. Rather than dicing an onion, I was going to use onion powder in the sauce portion, but forgot to add it :/-other than that I followed the recipe exactly using 1 lb. of baby red potatoes. I did double the sauce recipe as suggested by others. DELICIOUS! Definitely will be using this recipe often!

This is my father's favorite potato recipe.  He requested it for fathers day dinner this year.  It's been one of my favorites since hte first time I tried it.  I always put a little extra honey on about 20 mintues before they're done.  I love the carmalized look too. :)

Excellent if you increase the 'sauce' by half. I didn't want to take the time to roast these, so I cubed them up nice and small and boiled them for about 10 minutes, then combined them in a nonstick pan with the rest of the ingredients and cooked just until the 'sauce' was thickened. yum!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used twice the butter and tripled the honey, but I believe that I used AT LEAST twice the potatoes of the original recipe. Used more salt and pepper than the original, too.   I had to bake the potatoes for 45 min+.  I put them in a 9x13 pan.  Definitely makes them yummy when you broil for 5-10 min after baking.  We will make this one again!

This wasn't bad - but it honestly just tasted like regular raosted potatoes with a hint of sweetness.  Hubby didn't even taste the sweet at all.  I took some of the suggestions of covering the potatoes a good portion of the time and boiling them for a few minutes first - but I don't know if maybe that is why it wasn't that good.  It took a lot longer than 35 minutes and was not as crispy as I was hoping even after broiling.

Pretty good- I made these with chicken nuggets- substituting mustard powder with chili con carne (to match the seasoning on the nuggets).  I think they were pretty good. But, next time I would add more salt and certainly cut the potatoes smaller to give more surface area to pick up seasoning.

Quantities were all wrong on this one, but it was tasty.  I knew a pinch of salt for so many potatoes is not enough so I sprinkled salt and pepper on all potatoes for even covering.  It had no where near enough honey and I did try the spicy thing instead of mustard with red pepper flakes and that was wonderful...just not enough.  My husband said "its good but the flavor is barely there.  It needs more of whatever is in it."  I also added some rosemary to em.  Next time, I'll double the honey, the red pepper flakes and add more herb.  Also, I didn't understand the concept of putting in the onion so early on with the potatoes, most cooked way too much.  I'm going to add them during the halfway turn over so the ones that fall off don't burn beyond recognition (thank goodness for aluminum foil!).  I will try with the changes and see how it turns up.

IMO, these were just "sweet", not flavorful as I like, but just sweet. They leave much to be desired in the seasoning deptartment.

Super good roasted potatoes. We loved the sweet flavor from the honey which complimented the onion & mustard flavors. I mixed all the ingredients in a large bowl and tossed well, then added to my baking pan. I had to use prepared yellow mustard only because I ran out of dry, but these still were fabulous. These really went well with herbed pork chops. I will be making these again for sure, thank you for sharing :)

These did not roast evenly for me - next time I will stir them more than just once.  The ones that did roast properly were excellent.  Will definitely try again.

These were okay the next morning when we used them for breakfast and fried them up with the left over holiday ham and some eggs.  As for dinner, they took longer to cook them expected (probably should have cut up more, I ended up taking them out and putting them in a bowl to microwave them to make them softer) and not as much flavor as I was hoping.

These are very flavorful potatoes! My husband and I like more flavor so I usually make double the sauce and cut the potatoes smaller. Very delicious! My husband's not a potato fan and hardly eats them, but he goes back for seconds with these ones!

These potatoes are exquisite! Ive never actually made them with red potatoes because I've never had them on hand. Instead, i use plain old russet potatoes which work just fine. Also, i substitute regular yellow mustard for dry mustard (since i never have that lying around either) and that works well too! Great recipe, its a keeper!

Very good! I get perfectly cooked honey potatoes every time by microwaving the potato cubes for few minutes before putting them in the oven with the sauce.

I was not to crazy for these potatoes as I think more honey needed to be added. The potatoes also I found needed a much longer cooking time as stated in this recipe. I did omit the dry mustard and added a squirt of Dijon mustard instead which worked well. I will make this again but, I will be adding more honey to it.

Very good, very easy.  I used half the butter, cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces, and salt and peppered to taste.  Cooked for about an hour, stirring every 10-20 minutes.  A mellow sweet flavor.

These are so tasty!  I love the slight sweetness from the honey and the tang of the mustard.  I've made this recipe several times.  Each time I tweaked it a bit more.  I've added a little more butter and more honey and they're great!  This last time I added some bottled mustard (you know, the stuff you put on hot dogs) and it gave it more of a bite.  My boyfriend loves these and he's not usually one to like sweet potatoes of any kind.  Really good!  We make these when we make roast.  One tip - To keep things simple and tidy for clean up, I put these into aluminum foil and make a pouch of it.  I either make a big batch in one pouch or I break it up into a couple pouches.  They are perfectly cooked in the 35 min time frame and best of all -- Easy cleanup!

I didn't think these were as great as the review.  I think roasted potatoes are better with olive oil, garlic and fresh rosemary alone.  I guess I was expecting better.

These turned out WAY better than I expected!  No one needed/wanted to put ketchup or salt on these! They do need 3 Tablespoons of honey AND they need to cook in the oven for about an hour. I used 12 small red potatoes, quartered.

These were very good, but the sauce was too mild for my taste.  I did 'em again last night and doubled the honey and mustard and that was much better.  But I still think it's a bit too much work...

Just 'okay' for my family. Kind-of pointless to cook this way when DH just adds ketchup. Not too much flavor of honey or mustard. Probably won't make again.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  These are soooooo good!  I used more than a pinch of salt and pepper (more like 1/4 tsp. each).  I didn't have dry mustard, so I replaced it with 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard.  I doubled the honey and increased the baking time.  I covered the potatoes during the first 20 minutes of baking.  After baking 35 minutes, they weren't done, so I increased the oven temp to 400 and baked them another 20 minutes.  They turned out perfect this way!  The onions and sauce carmelized and the potatoes were absolutely delicious!  Thank you for this recipe!

These were really good, but I think they need closer to 1 hour for softer potatoes.  DEFINITELY stir them up, use SPRAYED foil and maybe increase the amount of sauce.  Also thought they would be a bit better with a little spice; a shake of Tobasco, maybe?  Used a purple onion...mmmm.

I was impressed by these.  Changes I made:  - Substituted onions for 2 tsp onion powder, which was put right into honey mixture - Cut potatoes into eighths instead of quarters (used medium to large potatoes and maybe not quite a pound) - Cooked for 45 minutes, instead of 35 and they came out perfect -Covered with tin foil...I don't think the recipe mentions that, maybe it's just implied?  They had a lovely, different flavour that I enjoyed and I will keep this recipe!

Even after I doubled the honey mixture and mixing through whle cooking these were still bland. They also needed quite a bit more cook time after cutting into thirds, but maybe it was my oven.  Not a fan.

I used four small potatoes, omitted the butter, substituted prepared mustard to the dry kind and used three tablespoons of honey instead of one. The mustard didn't add any taste, just colour. The honey, even after increasing the amount, only lightly sweetened the potatoes and did not glaze them. Also, they were not even the slightest bit crunchy; just cooked and soft.

Very good!  I did make some changes, I made half and half potatoes and carrots.  I boiled both for about 5 minutes before baking and doubled the sauce, adding half in the middle of baking time (as suggested by a previous reviewer)This recipe will absolutely be added to my repertoire !!  Thanks

I had to mix up this recipe a bit. I left out the dry mustard and used some cayenne pepper in its place. I also substituted chicken broth for the melted butter. I added a little bit extra honey. The cook time on these actually took over an hour even though I had cut the potatoes into eighths. The honey was very yummy and I enjoyed these.

wow, wow, wow! i make a mean pouch potato but i have to say that this recipe just might beat it out!! i baked them on the grill and burnt a few of them but they still turned out wonderful. i left out the onions because i don't care for them. we usually make enough for leftovers the next day but my husband and i ate all of them they were so yummy!

These were delicious.  I will definately make again.  I did not have any dry mustard, so I used 2 teaspoons of regular yellow mustard.  I used a vidalia onion and roasted them for an hour.  The onions became carmelized and the potatoes had just the right consistency.  Yummy!

These potatoes were very good, but not as wonderful as I thought they would be. To me, they seemed a little greasy, even after I reduced the amount of butter. Most of my family enjoyed them as well, but I did not find them as incredibly amazing as others have.

These are delicious and will become a staple at our home.  The only thing I did differently was cutting my potatoes smaller and used fresh ground pepper.  They did not get as crispy as I would have liked and I wanted to put them under the broiler but did not have time. I will be making these again.

Very good and easy.  As did others, I increased the amount of honey to 3 tbls.  I also turned on the broiler for the last 5 minutes - bottom line, this is a keeper.

these were surprisingly good! I didn't think they'd turn out crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside, but they did. my daughter who really isn't a potato fan ate them as well. great.

I made this the other night to go with steak.  I did increase the honey and dry mustard.  It had a good flavor although I may increase the honey even more next time.  I do think that I cooked it too long (my own fault), but besides that, it tasted great.

These were wonderful!  I didn't have any onion, so I added some onion powder to the mixture.  I also added an extra tablespoon of honey.  These took a little longer to bake but were well worth the wait.  Can't wait to make these again!

This recipe complimented the Yummy honey chicken kabobs from this site very well.  It wasn't too sweet and it had the perfect amount of flavor.  We omitted the onions due to personal preference.  I will be making these again!

These were so good.  Like others suggested, I doubled (ok, tripled) the honey and used nearly 2 lbs of potatoes, for 5 people, and they were all gone.  Broiling for 3-5 minutes at the end, really crisps them up.  Perfect, definitely going to make these again.

This recipe is awesome. I do a couple of things to this. I add about 2 Tablespoons of minced garlic to the butter/honey mixture, plus I double the sauce and vegetables. I like to add brussel sprouts cleaned and halved lengthwise, as well as 1 red or orange bell pepper chopped in kind of larger chunks. My kids eat brussel sprouts cooked this way. They even fight over them. This recipe is kid friendly, nutricious (I hope I spelled that right), and it comes out delicious every time.

These were different, but in a good way!  I usually roast my potatoes in butter with garlic powder and black/red pepper, so the sweet taste of these was a wonderful change.  Next time I make them, I will reduce the butter by half, but otherwise, no changes.  Thank you for sharing!

these potatoes are awesome! So delicious! Per the suggestions below I also doubled the sauce and added more salt once they were cooked. Cooked for 60 minutes. I will be making these again and again. I think I told my husband 10 times how much I loved them.

These potatoes smelled amazing when they were cooking! I used 3 minced garlic cloves, omitted onions b/c didn't have any, used a sprinkle or oregano and a squirt of dijon mustard b/c didn't have dry mustard. This all prob changed the outcome but they were good! :)

Very nice!  I love roasted veggies so it's always great to get a new recipe  I threw in some carrots, since the honey glaze seemed to call out for them, and they were fabulous.

Based on previous reviews, I doubled the sauce mix, stirred every 15 minutes (which cuts down on the messy pan problem), and cooked longer at a higher temp.

Very nice recipe.  Thank you!

These were great! I followed other suggestions and used more then a pound of potatoes. i used about 6 large red potatoes, 1 whole onion, 3 tablespoons or butter, 3 tablespoons of honey and 2 teaspoons of dry mustard. I cooked for about 45 minutes. Then i put a little kosher salt on them and drizzled with more honey and put in the broiler for 3-5 minutes. I thought there were great. I am making them right now for a second time this week!

Delicious! We used russet potatoes, because red potatoes are almost impossible to find in Greece, 2 tablespoons of prepared mustard instead of 1 tablespoon dry, and baked for about 50 mins. Other than that, we followed the recipe. We liked it a lot, and this is the way we will roast our potatoes from now on! The only problem - you definitely have to double the recipe, or there won't be enough for you to try! :P

These are excellent! The only change I made was to add 3 tablespoons of honey instead of 1 because I really wanted the potatoes to taste a little sweeter. I also substituted the dry mustard for 3 tablespoons of regular white wine mustard. The result was a divine burst of flavors. An instant favorite.

Awesome!  Mine took nearly an hour, but they were worth the wait.  I doubled all the ingredients and used cayenne instead of dry mustard, for that sweet/spicy combo.  Delicious.

I don't like honey but these were really great!  Kids actually branched out from the normal mashed potatoes and loved these! I cut to large bite size chunks and used enough to fill an 8X11 pan, double layer so probably a good bit more than the 1 pound the recipe called for. IF I had used less, they may have turned out a little greasy.  Suggest tossing the potatoes in a bowl before putting them in the baking dish and then tossing again during cooking time to distribute the moisture throughout.   Baked more like 1 hour and broiled the last 5 minutes. Used some cayenne pepper and extra salt sprinkled on top, which made them a little spicy instead of sweet which we loved!

I liked these a lot.  I love potatoes and am always looking for variations.  The flavor is subtle, but I enjoyed that it was not overpowering.  I made it a second time and added about 2 Tbs. of chopped fresh cilantro at the end.  Both ways are great.

I gave this a 1 not because it was bad but it just tasted like regular roasted red potatoes nothing special.

I was expecting more flavor. I followed the recipe exactly.. heres a  suggestion that might make a huge difference. More honey and butter and maybe put an extra drizzle acrosss the top just before serving. I'll try this recipe again.

I increased the honey and onion. I still thought it could have had more flavor. They also take an hour, rather than 30 minutes.

I would've enjoyed a little more flavor... They certainly were "slightly sweet" but didn't realize that would mean "slightly flavored".

Great!  I added less butter and more honey, not too sweet at all!  I used real yellow mustard, since I didn't have the dried mustard on hand.  Cooked in my oven for almost an hour and then broiled them for a few minutes to carmelize the honey and crisp up the potatoes a bit.  Turned out great!  Served these with 'Alice Chicken' from this site and sauteed zucchini and yellow squash.  Not a leftover at all!  Will be using this again.

Had a great mild flavor. I made lemon chicken with it and it countered the sharp lemon flavor well. The leftovers tasted great cold too!

Delish!! I doubled the butter and honey and used dried onions that I softened in a little water before adding. They do need to cook 40-45 minutes and I stir them around a couple of times to make sure they are nicely coated.

I'm rating this 5* even though I changed it up quite a bit b/c we loved it so much. Here's what I did: 5 lbs. red potatoes cut up pretty small, 1 cup and 2 T peanut oil (for the butter), 3/4 cup honey, 1 rounded T dry mustard 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, added 1/4 tsp. chili powder, 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. crushed dried rosemary. Mix all together and drizzle over potatoes in greased pan; then, sprinkle with several handfuls of cooked real bacon bits. Baked for 40 minutes covered and then for 25 minutes uncovered @ 375 degrees. Next time I think I'll use less oil as the final result was a little greasy; but, the potatoes were perfectly cooked in this amount of time and this was the right amt of heat and sweet and spices. I'll be making my version again soon. Thanks for the inspiration and the reviews which helped create this incredible dish.

These were wonderful. My husband rates these a five which he has never done. I did not have any dry mustard so I just added about a 1/2 teaspoon of mustard. I also used an entire Vidalia Onion. I didn't dice it and just placed the slices throughout the potatoes.  I took some of the recommendations and used about 4 tbs of butter and 3 tbs of honey. Baked for about 45 mintues and then placed under the broiler for about 7 minutes. Will definitely make these again.

These were really yummy!  Not too sweet.  I did add more salt, and broiled them for about 10 min after baking for 35.  (we like our potatoes crispy on the outside).  Definately stir them a couple times while baking.  There might have been a little too much butter...or not enough potatoes.  Either way a great new recipe to add to my list!

I have just signed on for All Recipes and this was the very first recipe I chose to try out.  I am glad that I did because it was soooo yummy!  I didnt have any honey so I used a honey mustard sauce instead and even my husband who was skeptical about using honey loved it! This is a winner!

Good Recipe. used small yellow because I had no red. Also I didn't have dried mustard so I used regular dijon and they still tasted yummy. I eyeballed the honey amount- probably doubled. These were really good!

Good!  Not amazing but very tasty.  I loved the onion in this dish.  The onion did brown quite a bit but they stuck to the potatoes and enhanced the flavour.  I did have to cook them for almost 50 mins.

These were great.  I liked the fact that it is more of a hint of flavorings than a WHAM! here's your mustard and honey.  I made stuffed bell peppers and served this on the side, everyone really enjoyed them.  Thanks!

I made these last night when I couldn't think of anything as a side, and they were AWESOME!!! FANTASTIC! I made them on the grill so we wouldn't need to turn on the oven...and served with grilled salmon and a salad! Wonderful recipe. Will make often!

I made these yesterday for my husband. They were so good that he was impressed I made them (I've never cooked anything but mashed potatoes prior to this). They were very flavorful and had just the right hint of sweet. If you prefer salty to sweet, just sprinkle onion salt on top when they come out of the oven.

Yummy potatoes! The honey was just enough to give it a slightly sweet taste, but not too overpowering. It did need some more salt for my own taste, but still really good!

Really good! I used a teasoon of Tarragon Dijon mustard and added a teaspoon of minced garlic and sauteed in the butter. I admit I left the potatoes for almost an hour as I got distracted and they were still delicious! Not at all burnt. I thought the honey gave just the fainest hint of sweetness..perfect.

I added additional ingredients as suggested by others and still seemed to think these were lacking a bit in flavor.  I did cook them at 425 as suggested by others.  They were good, just not great.  I'll try them again though i'm sure maybe adding more again to the recipe!

I do not like my white potatoes sweet.  My husband liked them though.  I would not make these again.  You do have to add more butter and honey to evenly coat the potatoes also

Sweet and tasty!  I didn't measure anything when making these, less the butter (new stick) - upped by 1/2 tbs.  Used a LOT more honey (I'd say between 1/3 and 1/4 cup).  Regular Mustard (no dry), and the tiniest pinch of powdered Rosemary.  425 for 35 minutes was perfect.

These potatoes were awesome.  I doubled the sauce recipe after reading some reviews.  I served them with the gorgonzola and apple pork chops which complemented them nicely.  The bitter sweet taste was great.

I used plain French's mustard from the fridge and added quite a bit of black pepper.  They turned out very tender and spicy with just a touch of sweetness.  I think next time I'll a bit more honey just to see.  Easy and great!

This was awesome!  Great super easy idea!  I used "cant believe its not butter" , microed for a few seconds, added the honey and dry mustard.  I shook some garlic/pepper/salt (find it @ Big Lots for like .89) all over before I poured the butter mixture on.  I do think some crushed rosemary would be a good addition too.  I used red onion and they carmelized very nicely.  YUM-O!  Super easy & flavorful!  Thanks for the post and cant wait to try w/ regular ole' potaotes!

Nice flavor on this dish, but I did double the sauce and onion. I cooked these at 400 since I was baking poultry too and it still took the 35 min to cook. I stirred these halfway through. They were better where the edges started to carmelize but unfortunately only a select few were like this. Maybe if I had cooked them longer? These are pretty mild flavored and really didn't go with the lemon chicken I prepared since the entree was so flavorful that it overpowered this poor little potato dish, so it doesn't "go with everything" like some side dishes do. Overall this is a very good dish, thanks for sharing this.

The first time I made this I followed the directions exactly, but as many others have stated they were a little dry and bland.  The second time I made them I cooked them longer as others suggested. I also doubled the sauce mixture and added a package of Lipton Golden Onion soup mix. It really did the trick!

The sauce on these was phenomenal. I would suggest doubling even tripling it however. I doubled it and I still thought it wasn't quite enough. Also depending on the size of your potatoes you may have to lengthen the cooking time.

Doubled the sauce (per other reviewers recommendations). I used small red potatoes (creamer size) and increased the baking time to 50 minutes.  The potatoes are excellent, perfect for a dinner.  I made them along side "savory roll ups" another great recipe on this site.

I did not have the complaint about being bland as other reviews have.  Actually my husband thought they were a little too sweet, but the kids sure ate them up.  Next time I will leave the honey the same but increase the dry mustard.  Will also put under broiler as other suggested and use olive oil.  Did cook a little longer than stated but not a problem since the rest of dinner wasn't ready yet.

These were awesome. Per the suggestions I doubled up on the honey butter mustard sauce mixture and added some rosemary and garlic powder. It was simply delicious and a family favorite. I will definitely be making this again!!!

These had a nice, uniquely sweet flavor that I really enjoyed.  They aren't my favorite way to make potatoes, and my husband wasn't a big fan, but I think I would make them again since they were so easy and turned out nicely.

These were a hit at Sunday dinner...
I didn't have dry mustard, so I used a little trial size bottle of djion Mustard, and I at least doubled the recipe...  Due to time constraints,I ended up microwaving the potatoes for about 12 minutes, stirring them half-way, and then roasted them under the broiler when I got to my mothers house.

like other reviewers said, taking longer to make patato tender and can not tell honey or mustard flavor.  My favorite is the recipe with balsamic vinegar. will not make again.

Followed recipe exactly except for adding double the amount of diced onion. Could have been a tiny bit sweeter (dab more honey). Loved it.

These were good but could use a little more seasoning. Mine took longer to bake, probably closer to 45 minutes. Next time I will add more mustard and maybe some crushed rosemary.

yummy. I used 3 lbs of red potatoes, 6 T butter, 6 T honey, 1 t pepper, 1 t salt, 3 t dry mustard, 1/4 t garlic powder, 1/2 cup chopped onions. quartered the potatoes, boiled 5 minutes. Mixed the rest of ingredients, toss the potatoes in them, transferred to a greased pan and baked covered 25 minutes and uncovered 15 minutes, perfect, very nice taste and something different

We really liked these potatoes.  I doubled the recipe and used extra salt and pepper.    It does need to cook longer than 35 minutes.  I even put it under the broiler because we were waiting on it. After eating it I wanted to add more to the flavor but was unsure as to what.  Maybe dill or rosemary?!

These potatoes were very simple to fix and were delicious. I doubled the recipe, and I am glad I did because the family really ate them up. I tossed the potatoes in the sauce  before placing them on the baking sheet as others  had suggested. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I will do this one again for sure. Thanks, Stephanie, for the recipe!

So delicious.  I have made these many many times now and the only advice I would give is to bake these potatoes for about 75 minutes.  Stir half way through the baking time and cook for the full 75 minutes.  You will love the results!  I also double the amount of sauce in relation to the potatoes.  I love that honey flavor.  So delicious.

I've been making these for a long time. I guess I forgot to rate them. These are really good but I cut my potatoes smaller. I do crank up the oven to 400 and cook an extra 15-20 mins or until they are tender.

These were pretty tasty. I didnt have onions (realized once I started making it, so I used onion powder) but next time I would definitely use the onions for more flavor. I had to up my temp to 400 so my potatoes would brown and carmalize.  Had this with a Honey Dijon Salmon and it was great.

I really didn't find anything special about this recipe.  Personally, I prefer this red potato recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/oven-roasted-red-potatoes/detail.aspx

This recipe was really yummy.  Cooking time was longer than recipe indicated - I ended up covering with foil for the last 20 minutes just to speed up the cooking, then also broiled on high for a couple minutes at the end.  I didn't have dried mustard, and that was fine - I substituted with black pepper and a pinch of cayenne - delicious.  Thanks!

Delicious! The sweetness of the honey and onions really compliment each other in this recipe. I did make extra "sauce".  I used margarine because I can't cook with butter for dietary reasons.  Next time I'd like to see how it would come out with olive oil instead because I think that would be healthier.

These came out great!  Per other reviewers I doubled the butter and honey and cooked them for 45 minutes.  Also, I cut my potatoes smaller...like 1-inch pieces.  Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding red potatoes recipe!  I also tripled the recipe, using 3 lbs. red potatoes instead of 1 lb. as it calls for.  This was a perfect amount for a big family. This would be a great dish to take to a church potluck!  You  will get rave reviews, and bring home an empty dish!

This is GREAT.  Every time I make this people ask me for the recipe.  I tend to put in more honey and butter than is called for, but really, is there such a thing as too much?  Ha!  Highly recommended

These burn very easy due to the honey. They would be much better to roast them on broil for 15 minutes and then drizzle them with the sauce. I will do this next time.

VERY VERY GOOD I used yukon gold potatoes and cut smaller and doubled sauce as some reviewers said. It does taker longer to bake if you want to have browned potatoes. We love onion so I just added 1 large diced onion on top and was really pleased how delicious it was

This was a tasty change for new potatoes.  I cut the potatoes up in smaller pieces then microwaved them for a bit to reduce the oven cooking time. I also doubled the sauce recipe.

These turned out really well, although I had to cook it for much longer than posted.  The honey wasn't enough to make the potatoes sugary-sweet, but it did bring out the naturally sweet flavor.  This went perfectly as a nice, mild side dish for a bold entree.

I doubled the honey mixture as other reviewers suggested and thought the potatoes were less flavorful than I hoped.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but wasn't as good as expected.

This recipe is delicious!  I use dried minced onions instead of fresh when I am in a hurry and I also add crumbled bacon bits and toss with the butter, honey and other ingredients.  I like to bake them a little longer and turn them half-way through the baking time.  My family loves this recipe and I make it quite often for large groups to rave reviews.  I made them this Valentine's Day and cut the potatoes in slices and used a small heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut out a heart out of each slice to make the potatoes in the photo.  I used the outer part with the heart cutout too.  This will be in my recipe book for years to come!

Delicious!  I think the flavor is fantastic and just subtle enough to go with any main course.  This is not an overwhelming honey dijon flavor!  Just an added taste to enhance the goodness of roasted potatoes.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added some cayenne pepper for an added kick.  I quartered the potatoes as stated, however I would recommend at least cutting the potatoes into eighths.  Quarters took way longer than 35 minutes to cook through (about 50 minutes).

I ate the whole dish myself! I only had prepared dijon mustard.  I added garlic and cayenne. I didn't have an onion so I used dried, minced onion. I gave my boyfriend a bite.  He loved it, but I was sick so I got to eat it all!

These were excellent.  Fast and delicious, you can't go wrong there!  My husband and I had them with the garlic chicken and the soy balsamic asparagus both from this site and the meal couldn't have been better, served with fresh french bread and this easy and fast meal was a 5 star.UPDATE: 1-4-09 made again as written but added about 4 cloves of chopped garlic, yummy~can't believe I didn't add any before!

I loved the idea of this recipe, but I cheated and bought a honey mustard marinade and coated the potatoes in that.  I roasted them in the oven for a little over a hour turning frequently.  They turned out wonderful, great flavor, and very crispy!

I hate to give a bad review but I was pretty disappointed by this recipe.  I read all the reviews exhaustively before I made it and took some advice:  I parboiled the potatoes first to cut baking time and doubled the sauce ingredients.  They took on a nice color but never really did crisp up.  Tasted OK.  Honey roasted potatoes sounds like a delicious idea but probably won't try this particular recipe again.

I really liked this, but I have trouble anytime I roast potatoes. I even leave them in longer than I should and I never get the crispy results others get with yummy roasted potatoes. Help! I'm talking over the last 10 years - I HAVE to be doing something wrong! Even so, these are delicious and the sauce could really be used on any number of meats or vegetables.

Different and tasty. I added garlic powder and used onion powder instead of onion. I subbed olive oil for the butter. We cooked these in the convection oven to speed the process up. My 16 year old loved these more than the adults did. Thanks for the post!

These are alright. I will keep the recipe in my recipe box because I like to have some variations for potatoes and what not. There's something missing though, so I will just keep tweaking it until I know. If you're just looking for a change for the everyday weeknight meal, go ahead and give this a whirl. It's worth a try.

These turned out SO good.  Much better than just plain roasted potatoes.  Loved them and will make again.  Followed recipe just as written.

Yummy!  Like most everyone else, I doubled the sauce.  I used prepared mustard and dried onion bits because that was what I had, and I used a little extra honey--it worked out really great.  Will for use this again because it looked and tasted really fancy without a lot of work.  Thanks!

We didn't like this recipe at all. It didn't have much of a taste even though I doubled most ingredients and even added some extras in. Will not make this again.

This was a very good and very easy recipe.  The kids even liked it and was a nice change from baked potatoes plus there was no need to add the fat that comes w/ the sour cream we heap on the baked white potato variety.

These are great... I have used both red and Idaho potatoes and they're both good. I double the sauce mixture, but I think I'm using a bit more potatoes than the recipe calls for, so it works out. I used regular brown spicy mustard in the mix instead of powdered mustard, and I think this makes it even better!

I REALLY liked this variation of red potatoes...I love most things sweet so this was perfect!!  I followed another reviewers advice and mixed a few potatoes at a time with the honey mixture, so they were all coated....Used more then the lb of potatoes-probably 1.5-2 lbs!Served with Ranch chicken(also on this site)...Yum!!

I doubled the potatoes but didn't quite double the butter mixture, trying to conserve calories- it was a mistake. The potatos that were coated in the butter came out beautifully carmalized and delicious. This recipie was wonderful and my husband who demands "plain jane and covered in red pepper sprinkles" cooking even loved it! Thank you!!

I served these with a cumin flavored pork loin and my dinner party really enjoyed the hint of sweetness in the potatoes.  The recipe is perfect for spicy meat.

These appeared to me to be your basic roast potatoes--I did cook longer than the recipe calls for because I like a darker, crispier potato--maybe that killed some of the flavor--I couldn't really pick up the honey taste or any sweet flavor at all.  Not bad--nothing too special.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  The idea of honey on potatoes sounded great but it seemed like something was missing, it was sort of bland.  I think it needs additional spices but I'm not sure what it would be.

Very nice. Unless I'm chopping onion for another recipe, I'm lazy and omit it, and double up on the rest of the sauce.

These are the best potatoes!  If you run out of honey, you can use brown sugar for a similar effect (not quite as good).

These were GREAT! If hubby knew that I had put honey in it he wouldn't have eaten these (he still doesn't know)he thought they were great I thought they were AWESOME! I did add garlic powder, extra pepper, onion powder and I only had the creamy honey(so I used that) and a little extra butter-which turned out to be a good move or the potatoes would have been to dry for our tastes-THANKS for a great recipe that I would have NEVER thought to try!

I have made these potatoes about 5 times since I got the recipe. Each time was for a different group of people. Without exception they all loved it. The only thing I did differently was to add a little more honey to cover the potatoes.

Very good. I cut the potatoes into 1" cubes and then mixed all the ingredients together rather than drizzling the butter mixture over the top. I also added a little dill because I really like dilled potatoes. They cooked for about 40 minutes and turned out great!

These were great - we had them with the garlic parmesan chicken - also from the site.  We might add some more spices next time - garlic, cayenne - and maybe more honey. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this.  I prepared as directed.  Allowing for the different sizes of potatoes, I made sure the pieces were relatively small.  I had no trouble with the cooking time.  I consider this dish repeatable and easy to prepare.  I served this with the Sorta Salisbury Steak and Chocolate Chess Pie for dessert.

I doubled the recipe, but left the same amount of butter so it was essentially halved.  I also added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  I also used dijon mustard instead of the powder (same amt.).  Next time around, I will use even less butter, but these were a hit.  I will make them again and again (oh, and I made them with a meatloaf so I let them bake with it at 350 for an hour).

These were okay.  Not awful, but I didn't think to myself "Hey, these are pretty good!"  Would possibly make again, but I doubt I'll ever crave them.  The sweetness is subtle, which I appreciated, but I think I would have liked more tang to balance the sweet.

I fixed this recipe for 6 people, 2 of which were children and we all loved it.  I didn't have the dry mustard, so I used regular and it turned out great, I did have to bake it for about 50 minutes, but worth it.  linnie

They were really good, although they could have used another 10 minutes in the oven atleast.  But this may really depend on the size of the patatos you use.

These were very good.  I took them to a family get-together and everyone seemed to like them.  I can't say that they were just outstanding and the best potato dish I've ever had, but they were very good and easy and I would make them again.

These were great potatoes, but I think I should have added more honey because they didn't come out as sweet as I would have liked.  I was too lazy to grind the mustard seeds, so I used them whole and it gave a nice crunch.  Although, this meant there was no fusion of honey mustard sauce.  It came out great anyway.  Thanks.

So good! If you like sweet side dishes you'll love these potatoes. I'm a potato fanatic and have tried many recipes, but this is one of my all time favorites. Very greasy but worth it. Had to bake them for close to an hour, doubled the mustard and cut the potatoes smaller. MUST TRY!

These were terrific. I made a few changes to the recipe. Instead of butter, I used olive oil to reduce the saturated fat.I also chopped the potatoes into smaller pieces than quarters. I  added a bit more honey. I tossed everything in a bowl first then placed on the pan. Yes it did take a little longer then the time stated, but it was worth it!

This was okay.  Cook time is about 45 minutes too short, so we ended up not having them ready in time for dinner.  Also would double up on the sauce, as they came out really dry.  Might try these again when I have more time to play with the recipe.

This was good, but my daughter did not like it. She usually loves potatoes. I added extra honey like someone suggested, but I think that was too much. I will give it one more chance.

GREAT recipe! I baked for nearly an hour, however & it was great. I added parsley flakes. Next time I'll use olive oil instead of butter to make it more "heart healthy." This is a recipe that you could add whatever spices/herbs you like & it wouldn't harm the integrety of it.

Good, but the honey flavor was not obvious - add more honey if you wish to notice the honey flavor.

This recipe was FABULOUS!!  I made it with parisienne potatoes instead of the red ones.  They turned out fantastic and went well with the pork dish i served.  This one is a keeper!

Wow!!!  What a great easy side dish.  Excellent flavour...I had to double the recipe for my family and there was nothing left over. My family really loved it.  I will make this often to accompany chicken dishes.

Real good flavor! I was very generous with the honey and butter and mustard and it just came out great. I also tossed the potatoes in the sauce instead of pouring it over them. Came out very good. I'll make them again at christmas.

To die for!  Absolutely perfect!  Super easy!  This recipe was a big hit at my house; guests and family loved it.  Served with a rotisserie chicken and green beans almandine.  Only one alteration to the recipe, I had to omit the onions (husband does not like them).

A tasty idea in cooking potatoes, however, it leaves one trying to guess whether the dish is supposed to be sweet or provide a kick. Needlessly, this recipe was a little too light in taste, leading tastebuds towards "blah".

Really thought this went well with Aussie Chicken (also on this site).  Made it with prepared mustard instead of dry because I was out and it was really good.  Next time I will try with the dry mustard though.

It was good. I used russet potatoes since that is all I had. I think next time, if time allows, I will boil for a while first as was suggested. I would like them crisper. Really liked the flavor. May double the olive oil/honey mixture next time, too.

These are really good & a little different.  I made the recipe as written.  My husband asked me to double the recipe the next time.  It's just the 2 of us at home & he loves potatoes.  Hopefully there will be leftovers next time.

Pretty good recipe- I would season more with salt substitutes for more flavor and use more onion.

Was doubtful based on smell but taste was very nice indeed. Used a little extra honey (maybe extra 1/2T) and mixed all ingredients, including potatoes, in a bowl before putting in oven.

Excellent!  The only thing I did off recipe was prepare the potatoes and place them is a bag with the other ingredients before cooking them.  Superb!   Will make often!

Slightly microwave or boil potatoes and then cut after cooled.  I have done it with microwaving a few minutes or following the recipe with raw potato and the microwaved version is so much better.  I up the mustard, salt and pepper and triple the butter sauce - so 6 T butter, 3 T honey, 1 T dry mustard, 1 or more t salt, 1/2-1 t pepper.  Think the onion is a must. My family not fond of onions to eat raw - but do enjoy in cooking.  I stirred every 15 minutes and cooked till browned, crisped up some.  I did sprinkle parsley on the potatoes. This is very versatile - imagine you can add cayenne or other spices and herbs and change it up.  Leftovers are delicious with poached eggs! If there are any left over!  Thanks for the recipe

Absolutely delicious! A nice alternative to our usual mashed potatoes. I made the recipe exactly as written (I may have used more potatoes than  suggested). They did take about 45 minutes to cook. My 7 year old has thirds and would have had more if there were any left. Quick easy tasty side dish.  Thank you for the recipe!

These were good, but just tasted like plain roasted potatoes. I think they needed more honey for a sweeter taste.

Great side dish! Doubled the sauce with extra honey.  Mixed well in pan. Added salt & pepper separately. Tossed halfway to coat all over again. Took 50 min. - fork tender and just browned. Foil was a must for easy cleanup.

I left out the onion for preference and they were really good. I actually mixed the oil and seasonings in the bottom of the dish and then just mixed the potatoes in to coat them. Way easier and saved me a bowl.

followed exact recipe.  Not much flavor.  Had to add a lot more salt after.  We also had made a chimichurri sauce for our steak that was nice to dip the potatoes in for some flavor.

Very easy, tasty recipe! Definitely added to our list of favorites! I did double the sauce, however, and used a bit more potatoes than called for. I have also made 4 batches then put in fridge... in morning, put in Crock-pot on Low for 1 hour then warm for a couple hours and took to a pot luck lunch.... They were a hit!

I used Yukon Gold potatoes rather than red. This recipe was delicious - I made as the directions stated, no changes and I only had to bake 35 minutes to perfect potatoes. These will be a staple in our house from now on. Delicious

These were so good.  I double the sauce and "baked" them in a dish on the grill.  Delicious.

Very flavorful but I'm going to re make them. I did them own the  crock pot. I can see why the recipe calls for them to be cooked in the oven.

This was tasty and very popular with my family members.  In addition, it is extremely easy to make, even down to only having to quarter the potatoes and leaving the skins on.  Be careful while baking because the honey base does like to burn easily; you can't hurt it by adding a little water in the bottom of your baking dish to stop that from happening.  For my personal taste, I would have doubled the amount of sauce.  I had some difficulty tasting all of the flavors and I am always happy to make my food more "saucy," but don't let that influence your opinion of the recipe.  Everyone else felt it was great as it was!

I used golden potatoes instead of red as that was what I had on hand. Looked gorgeous and tasted even better! Following the suggestion from other reviews, I did boil the potatoes before baking them and was very impressed by the soft, chewy texture when they came out of the oven. I will absolutely be making these again!

I tweaked the recipe slightly (to make more of a sauce) by doubling the honey and I added 2 tablespoon of apple juice, 1 tablespoon of light brown sugar and minced garlic. Gotta have garlic on anything roasted. It was a little more sweet but it was still perfect.

This was a good base recipe, that I tweaked to work with the "Maple-Garlic Marinated Pork Tenderloin" recipe. If you microwave the potatoes for two minutes, they will be cooked in 45 minutes at 375F, and you can cook both at the same time.

Did very little to change. Did cayenne pepper instead of mustard. Added lots of cut up red pepper and purple onions. Baked in oven with Titanium pot. No sticking and turned out perfect. Loved this!!

Tasty!
Used 6-8 medium sized potatoes. Cut into bite sized pieces and boil in salty water for 5mins. Don't over boil. 
Double all ingredients other than potatoes.
Lay potatoes in a single layer on greased aluminum foil in a pan. Bake --> stir half way through to mix flavours. Bake 20 mins then broil 2-3mins till caramelized.

The only change made was to add an additional tsp of butter and 1 tsp of honey (I'm a sucker for sweet and buttery stuff).
Tasted great; will definitely make it again.

This recipe is really good. My family loved it. Next time I will increase the honey and butter a bit more and add a little extra salt. I think the seasoning depends upon how many potatoes one uses. The more you use, the more you have to increase the other ingredients - common sense will tell you. Will make this many more times.

These potatoes were yummy but needed more flavor. I made a spicy mustard sauce on the side for dipping. I think I'll add a little heat next time. Thanks for a great base recipe!

These potatoes are fantastic!  I love the sweetness the honey adds.  My new favorite roasted potatoes.  They do take a while to cook-as another reviewer mentioned about 40-60 minutes but it's worth it as the honey cooks down and coats the potatoes.  No changes needed.

I've made these before for my boyfriend and a few friends. They loved them so when I saw this recipe I was delighted. I am currently making them now. I did not use the onions this time. (I'm sick and forgot) however I pour my liquid over the potatoes throughout to keep them moist. I love love love these!!!!

Made this exactly as directed, but they were way too sweet to eat! I would definitely half the honey if I made them again. I give two stars because the potatoes cooked well as suggested. My boyfriend really liked them. It could be a matter of taste.

Made this recently. I didn't have dry mustard, so I just omitted that. It was still delicious. the honey adds such a mildly sweet flavor and a pinch of salt offsets it. Deserves 5 stars for sure.

Husband really liked these. I didn't change a thing but my quartered red potatoes must have been extra large as it took almost an hour to cook. I would add more salt and pepper next time too but he liked them as written. Thanks for the recipe.

These potatoes are exceptional! I used baby golds because I had some leftover and left out the onion. I also increased honey to 3T and baked for 40 minutes. Make sure to stir a few times while cooking. I served with Famous Butter Chicken on this site. One of my husband's favorite meals! The potatoes are so sweet they don't even need sauce!

Very subtle sweetness. Mine were perfect at 30 minutes at 375. Mix butter, honey and potatoes in a large bowl ensures even coating.

Good flavour but the potatoes took far longer to cook than the recipe indicates. The onions were overcooked by the time that the potatoes were ready. I would suggest covering the pan with foil for the first 30 mins to allow the potatoes to steam. I used exactly one pound of potatoes, I weighed them, and quartered them.  The total cooking time was one hour.

These were great.  Running short on time I cut the potatoes into pieces and microwaved them for 10 minutes, then coated with melted butter mixture and baked.  They were done in 30 min.  Next time I would cut back on the butter by a few Tbsp but otherwise really good!

This was delicious.  For the two of us I halved the amount of potatoes but kept the rest of ingredients the same - though I upped the quantity of salt a bit.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers to stir very ten minutes or so.  They were perfectly done in about 40 minutes. I sprayed the glass baking dish well with Pam & I had no problem with sticking.  I served the potatoes with breaded baked chicken breast. Oh, having no red potatoes, I used russets.  Will make this again.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is absolutely delicious!  I use yellow mustard instead of the dry mustard and I use more of the honey mustard combination than the recipe calls for too depending on how many potatoes I use.  The potatoes usually take 45- 60 minutes to cook to the right tenderness.  My family asks me to make this all the time.  It is definitely one of our favorite recipes!

Made this as a side for a small New Year's Ever get together. Just be careful if you are cooking on a convection setting. The honey can burn to the pan very quickly. That's my fault though. Not the recipe, but it still turned out very good. I used purple onions to add to the sweetness.

This is a quick and easy side dish to go with meat dishes.  My entire family loves these potatoes and I make a double batch when I make them.  Everyone keeps going back for seconds and then thirds, there aren't every any leftovers!

These were so yummy!  However I found I needed to add a little bit more honey, butter, dry mustard, salt and pepper after baking time since it seemed it evaporated.  I also baked them for over an hour to soften them.  I also smashed with the back of a large spoon.  Will make again!

These are a regular family favorite - but I always make a few changes .  I double the sauce and boil the red potatoes for a few minutes before or else the cooking time Is way more.  Love them!

It's helpful to put the honey and melted butter in a gallon sized freezer bag with the potatoes, so you can shake them around and get them coated really well.

Fantastic recipe!
I followed others' advice and tripled the honey.
I also used a tablespoon of regular yellow mustard instead of dry mustard.
Worked well with a mix of potatoes and sweet potatoes.
Came out delicious!

1 pound of potatoes is not a lot - if using more, you will need longer cooking time.

this is an amazing recipe.. I made it tonight for a 2nd time.. this time i tripled the mixture ingredients and instead of drizzling it on top I tossed the potato's before putting them into a non stick lightly sprayed casserole dish..I stirred it more the once throughout the 45 mins..and added basil at the end ...so amazing.. I didn't think it could be any better!!

I have tried this recipe four times now, trying different suggestions in the comments. It's just not that great. The butter honey mixture drips off the potatoes to the bottom of the pan immediately. I have tied removing them from the oven every now and then to recoat, but it doesn't matter. I have tried to reapply the mixture up to six times and still got bland potatoes with a weird crispy residue on the bottom. By the time the potatoes are cooked through, the other ingredients are all melted and burnt to the bottom. Every time I end up seasoning the potatoes afterwards, and discarding the mess in the pan.

These are always a hit. I always double the sauce, and prefer yellow potatoes. They do need 45 min to an hour to get a good golden brown. Also I recommend adding more than a pinch of salt.

Made this recipe again tonight, this time with carrots instead of potato's. Yummm!

These were good and quick/easy to prepare. A nice sweeter version versus all the very savory roasted potato recipes out there.

I doubled the honey and dry mustard and it tasted fantastic! Depending on the size of your potatoes, you may need to cook them for a bit longer.

I used fingerling potatoes and boiled them a bit first. I cooked them on a cookie sheet and moved them around a couple times during cooking. After 1/2 hour I turned up the temp to 400 because they weren't crisping at all. They still didn't crisp but man were they tasty!

I think this is a 3 star as written but could be great with changes.  A little too greasy with the amount of butter but good flavor.  I doubled the recipe and next time I won't double the butter or maybe try with oil instead.  I will make this again, the concept is great!  My potatoes needed approx 45 minutes to cook.

These were out of this world.  I will definitely make these again.  Just a piece of advice, if you don't like onions and are looking to not use them, don't bother with the recipe.  The onions are a necessity.

These were good potatoes and very easy to make.  If I were to make them again I would add more seasoning, as I feel they lacked a little flavor and I would also allow for a much longer bake time than that stated.  My potatoes were done to our liking at the 60 minute mark.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, STEPHNDON!

Wonderful twist on roasted potatoes! Followed exact but did pour in a tad more honey since it looked dry but without the extra it would have still been a hit with even the little ones!

These were good. Pinch of salt though?? Come on! I used quite a bit of salt (1.5 tsp maybe) and added a bit more near the end of cooking. Roasted potatoes need salt. Other than that, the family ate them up. Yum!

Although this was simple to make, the potatoes did not have very much flavor and I couldn't taste the honey at all.  Will not make these again.

These were really yummy :) I actually didn't have any red potatoes so I just used regular potatoes and it still turned out really good. Next time i would add a little more of the butter and honey just because i didn't have quite enough liquid.

This recipe was excellent!  I lined the pan in foil to easy cleaning, and bake it covered in foil for the first 40 minutes like others suggested.  I broiled the potatoes uncovered for the last 10-15 minutes. I made 2 x the seasoning and stared cooking it with the prescribed amount, but added the second batch half way through.  I also periodically moved the potatoes around thought the cooking process to keep the flavor off the bottom of the pan.  They came out excellent!  I would suggest this to anyone!

Maybe it was too many potatoes, but seemed to be lacking in flavor when made as the recipe calls.

They were gone in a blink of an eye! However, I did not make them in the oven. I just cooked them for a little bit,poured out the water, put them into the frying pan with a little bit of oil and chopped onions. Left it like that for 1 minute and then started to pour the honey sauce on top of it. Roasted it for a while until the onion was caramelized and potatoes golden. It was much quicker and tasted just great!!!

Fantastic! I made this recipe to go with fresh salmon. They turned out beautifuly and were super tasty!
I changed the recipe a touch as I usually do. I added more honey and cooked the potatoes for about and hour and then broiled them for 10 minutes. This made them crispy.
I love how these potatoes have a subtle sweet taste.  A perfect summer side dish!

We all loved this dish and kept on eating leftovers all week. Looking forward to make this again soon. (I used reg mustard since I had no dry mustard).

I think I was probably expecting a stronger honey flavor, so they didn't turn out how I had expected, but they were still yummy.

I added a bit more honey, and wish I had put in a little less butter as they were a little greasy to me.  Overall they were quite good, but next time I'll be looking for something with a less subtle flavor.

This is a great recipe.  I did not have dry mustard so I used some brown mustard.  I just squirted some on.  It was very good.

I made this exactly as described because I didn't want the sweetness to be overpowering.  I melted the butter with the honey in a large bowl, added the spices (and a bit of parsley for color) and finely diced onions.  Stirred it up to incorporate it and then tossed the potatoes in the mixture.  Easy and fast way to make sure the butter/honey was evenly distributed without leaving puddles in the pan.  Clean-up was quick with a foil lined pan.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! The only thing I did differently was to slice a small onion and break it into rings rather than using the diced onion called for. My guest and I both felt that the onion made the dish.

Phenomenal!  I made these 2 days in a row.  I used 3Tbsp. honey and 3Tbsp. butter.  I did need to bake them about an hour.  Also, I cut the potatoes in half and then each half into quarters.  This is definitely a keeper!!

So delicious and simple to make.  I followed the recipe except I added a bit of olive oil to the butter mixture and cut the potatoes a bit smaller to shorten cooking time.  I also turned the oven on broil for the last few minutes just to crisp them up a bit.  One of our favorite potato recipes now.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a good dish. Did add extra honey,salt & pepper and upped some of the other ingredients. Loosely covered foil over potatoes and baked longer than 35 minutes. Very tasty !

These were pretty good. I baked for an hour (covered with foil for 40 minutes and without foil for the last 20 minutes). I should have given them a quick broil at the end like the other reviews suggested, I think that would have bumped it up from a 3.5 star dish to a 4 star dish.

I also put in lots of frozen diced onions.

My new go-to roasted potato recipe.  To add flavor, I use a whole onion, all the above mentioned ingredients, and some Tony's seasoning.  Very easy and very flavorful.

My brother made these and they were great! Instead of baking them, he cooked them on the skillet for about 30 minutes on medium-medium high heat, flipping occasionally. He tossed in some freshly chopped parsley that we had on hand, too. This recipe was a nice way to switch things up!

Very good.  I par boiled the potatoes for about 5 minutes in the microwave, then cut into small pieces.  I mixed the honey mustard topping  with the potatoes to coat everything.  No way this cooked in 35 minutes though.  I think I had it in the oven close to 1 hour.  Will make again.

Easy and delicious.  Just enough sweetness.  It is a neutral enough takse to compliment about any meat. Had a little longer cookingtime, and broiled teh last few minutes to get them crispy and golden just a bit

I just made my first batch of these and they are very good! Next time I will probably use more honey... we don't keep onions on hand because my husband doesn't like their texture, so I used onion powder instead. I also substituted prepared mustard for the dry mustard, but in all they turned out great! I'll definitely be making this again soon!

I liked this recipe a lot. I would make it again. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is that my husband and son didn't really go gaga over it, so we had more than i wanted to eat alone left over :P

These potatoes were good.  However, I would have liked a little more of the honey-butter taste to them.  I will add more of these ingredients next time.

Great recipe, a good variation from regular potatoes.  The sweetness is mild not strong. On the second batch I doubled the sauce.  This recipe got great reviews when I served them with pot roast.

Fantastic!  I baked at 350 for 45 min because I had another dish that required that temp.  Nice carmelization!  Delicious.  Will make again, possibly with more of the "sauce".

This was easy to make, but the opinions on the results were mixed among my family. My daughter and I loved this recipe, and we would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that my wife and other children did not like this at all. They couldn't get over the sweet flavor, though I felt the sweetness was perfectly sublte and lovely. Great recipe, but mixed results.

I made these exactly as the recipe was written.
I was so disappointed! At 35 minutes they were not fork tender, but close, so decided to start checking after 5 minutes. When I checked at 40 minutes the honey glaze was charcoal blackened. It was a horrible mess as well. The bottoms were charred and stuck. My DH and teenage son said good flavor, so I'd like to try again. I will update if I have any tweaks.

These were delicious, but the cooking time doesn't seem to be long enough for the size I cut the potatoes. This isn't the recipes fault, these sorts of differences are bound to happen. I thought the sweetness was perfect.

Wonderful flavor.  I loved the subtle flavor of honey in this dish.  As you can see by the picture, I like my potatoes very well done so I did increase the baking time but that is the only change I made.   It’s a perfect side dish – easy and delicious.

This was just okay.  Probably a good recipe for someone who prefers a sweeter potato... I personally prefer a garlic or herb flavor.

I used triple the honey, cranked the oven up to 400 and broiled them after they got soft.  Good but not making me crave them.

I could have ate the whole pan myself!  I had fingerling red potatoes that I cut into thirds and 35 minutes was perfect for them.  I may have overestimated my pinch of pepper because they had a nice peppery zip to them that was a surprose to a couple of my pickier teens but didn't stop them from eating every last potato.  By the way, I adjusted the recipe for 6 servings to feed all 6 of us and was glad that one member did not show up for dinner!  They were so good the 5 of us ate the whole thing.

Followed recipe exactly-maybe I added some extra onion- I didn't measure them.  We really liked these.  I like the sweetness.  It wasn't too much, it was just right.  We love potatoes and like making them all different ways.  This recipe is nice for a change.  I made them in a convection toaster oven, and broiled them for about 5 minutes after they were done so they'd brown a little bit more.  Next time we may add a little cayenne like others mentioned.  I will say though, that I don't think this is enough for 4 servings.  More like 2.5.

Used 3 T honey as others suggested, completely left out the dry mustard just because I didn't have any...turned out perfectly. Very flavorful!!
Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very tasty, but I found a little too much sauce.. Next time, I will just toss them in a bowl.. They didn't seem to get that nice roasted taste.

Excellent recipe, but be sure to use "minced onion" (in the jar) NOT fresh onion...will definitely make it again.

This is a great company recipe.  It is simple, but presents beautifully.  Next time, I will increase the onions and sauce ingredients a little because they add so much to the flavor.  That way, every bite will have some of the delicious sauce!  I'd suggest large, bite size pieces of potatoes, then check after 15 minutes, and watch that they don't overcook.

Awesome. I doubled the mustard & honey because I really wanted to slather the potatoes in it. Delicious! Definitely will make this again.

Not bad but not great either. Used foil in the pan so it was an easy clean up. Kids didn't eat them, so I won't try this again.

These potatoes were the perfect addition to dinner last night.  Paired with Roasted Chicken and green beans... My husband asked if I had a recipe for this because everything was soooooo good. No left overs at all....  Only thing I did different was to increase the honey and butter... Perfect!!!

Absolutely delicious!  My fiance and I loved this recipe.  It took longer to bake, it was closer to 50 minutes, but that might be because the potato chunks were larger, so I recommend smaller chunks of potato.   I served this recipe with 'famous butter chicken' and green beans, which all went really great together.  YUM!  this will be a new regular!

I made these to have with our Sunday chicken.  They were wonderful.  I did not have any red potatoes, used fingerling instead, worked great.  I did double the honey mixure and lined the pan with foil as other reviewers suggested.  It was a quick and easy side dish.  Made extra, added with the left-over chicken and Campbell's Cream of Chicken Soup the next day for a really fast tasty soup.

This was a hit at our dinner table last night! Even my daughter who won't go near a potato gobbled this up. I also added carrots and parsnips from our garden, and they were great with this! I ended up tripling the recipe because of the added veggies and roasted them in a small roaster. We will be using this recipe again for sure!

I used 1-3/4 lb of baby reds, so I used 3 T each of margarine and honey and 1-1/2 tsp of dry mustard. I  doubled (or even tripled the onion) because we like it. I also added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne for a bit of zing. I microwaved the potatoes for 15 minutes then baked at 425F for about 8 minutes. These were good (DH loved them), but they weren't as flavorful as I had expected so I'll be tweaking the seasonings a bit more. They also would have been better if I had left them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up more.

These were delicious. I might use a bowl or glass dish instead of a pan - my baking sheet became burnt. Otherwise, it was the perfect taste.

I tried these last night, I was skeptical but they were pretty good! I did follow others advise and doubled the sauce, but I messed up and put the diced onions in the sauce as well, dont think it made a big diff though. I will make them again for sure. I also broiled for the last 5 min and they were perfect

Absolutely fantastic! My husband loved them. Like some others, I doubled the sauce. I added half the sauce at the beginning and added the other half of the sauce half way through the cooking time. This made the potatoes moist.

Not rating it 5 stars only because this recipe could have doubled on the amount of sauce. I doubled the recipe but should have made more of the sauce so the potatoes would have had more flavor. But what a flavor it was! Perfect balance of ingredients, and great taste.

Yum! These were a big hit with both myself and my boyfriend. I didn't have any mustard so I used Italian seasonings instead and I had to cook them at 400F for about 50 minutes to get them melt in your mouth soft, but they were delicious!

Had these tonight as a side dish to grilled spicy shrimp, and it was a great combination.  The spicy shrimp with the slightly sweet and caramelized potatoes.  This dish would work with so many other main dishes as well.  The preparation time was a few minutes and the oven did the rest of the work - love it!

These potatoes are pretty good.  I have made a few times and found its best to double to butter/honey mixture and use a whole onion.  I really enjoy how caramelized the onions get.  Also, I used a bit of Lawry's seasoning salt to add a bit more flavor.  I will try to boil them the next time I make them.  Hopefully I can get more of the honey flavor as mentioned previously.  Overall a great recipe though.  I will continue to make these!

very good!   I followed the previous suggestion of tripling the sauce and cutting the potatoes into eighths.

My husband loved these they were sweet and tender. I follow the recipe as is, except for I doubled the glaze and use onion salt instead of diced onion. I will be making these again :)

These were very good. I used dehydrated onion because I didn't feel like dicing an onion in order to secure 2 tablespoons worth. However, the flavor was really nice, so in the future I would dice an entire half onion and use that. Half an onion is worth dicing :) And the onions becomes caramelized in the honey sauce, which is very nice! I did use olive oil in place of butter to save on the saturated fats, and would do that again, but for company I'd definitely use the butter! Thanks for the recipe :) (I served this with AR's "Bourbon Street Rib-Eye Steak and a salad, and they paired very well!)

Delicious. Like some other reviewers, I needed to add extra mustard, salt and pepper to suit my tastes. I used frozen diced onions and will use double next time -- they sort of melt away and really add to the flavor!

Made this last night, the only changes I made was to use agave syrup instead of honey since I don't eat honey, and margarine for the butter. I laid them in a single layer on a baking sheet, this way they got a little crunchy and were great with ketchup. Next time I'll try to make more sauce and put them in a smaller pan so they remain soft. I'm sure they'd be great either way.

I made these tonight using mini red potatoes.  I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the sauce and rebasted them half way through baking.  I found with the minis they baked a lot quicker.  My family liked them except my 3 yr old. All he said was Yuck! But the rest of us liked them enough to add them to our list of keep recipes.

The only reason I gave it four stars because the flavor doesn't penetrate the potatoes enough. I recommend adding the sauce again right before serving.  Otherwise this is a definite keeper!

Delicious! As other reviewers have advised I used 5 Tbls. butter, 3 Tbls. honey, & substituted cayenne pepper, (1/2 teas.) for the mustard. Really good with roast chicken, pork, just about any meat.

The potatoes were very good, but could have used a little more flavor. I will probably increase the mustard, salt, and pepper next time. I served with Balsamic Roasted Pork Loin and the flavors went well together.
(edit)
I made this again, nearly doubling the glaze... I received a huge jar of fresh honey from a friend whose parents are beekeepers, and I used it liberally. I cooked the potatoes in a foil pouch for a while, then opened it and cooked for a while longer to carmelize the glaze a bit. I stirred it a couple times. They were easily some of the best potatoes I've ever eaten! So I recommend using a good quality honey, and using extra honey, and cooking for a longer time so the potatoes can absorb the sauce.

Yum! I used a bit more honey than what was called for and cooked the potatoes for probably about twice the time, as recommended by others (and because I was still fiddling around with the main dish, so I figured it couldn't hurt.) Delicious!!

This was tasty, but didn't wow me.  I left out onions, as I do not like.  This was a spin on the typical baby reds and was enjoyed by my family.

The taste on these potatoes was so good! I was under a time crunch so I had to take them out slightly early, but they would have been perfect had I left them in the oven for 10 more minutes.

I liked these, but they needed a little more flavour. I stirred them 3 times while cooking to make sure the honey mixture was well distributed. I also broiled them at the end for just a couple minutes and that gave them a nice, crispy texture. Next time I will add more honey, more onions, a little extra salt and some parsley for colour.

I made these with olive oil instead of butter and thought they were pretty good. i thought they couldve had more mustard-y flavor though, so next time i may add more dry mustard. i also used a little bit of parsley, as a few other reviewers suggested. putting them under the broiler for a few mins also helped get them nice and crispy.  will probably make again..with a few tweaks. :)

Pretty good.  Not my favorite way of making red potatoes, but it was a nice side dish.  I like crispier roasted potatoes so I broiled for a couple of minutes at the end.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were very yummy.  I knew they would take longer than I was going to have to roast them, so I did boil them for just long enough to soften them ever so slightly.  I then used a large non-stick cookie sheet since I had doubled the recipe for a larger group of people.  I stirred them several times while they were roasting.  It still took about 45 minutes for them to develop the nice crunchy caramelized surface I was going for.  Everyone loved them.  The only thing that I think they needed was more than a pinch of salt.  I sprinkled some kosher salt over them after I put them on the pan, and it was perfect.  Also, for our tastes, it was just the right amount of sweetness.  I will be making these often.

Soooo good!  I put some red pepper flakes in too for an extra kick.  I ended up cooking a lot longer because I was waiting on someone so they got a little mushy but even still they were a hit!  I probably doubled the sauce ingredients & used 6-7 big potatoes.  Yum!

So amazing! I made a few changes -- I doubled the butter and the honey, and only kind of eyeballed the spices so I likely doubled the mustard, too! I was roasting a pork tenderloin to go with this dish, so the potatoes wound up baking at 350 for 30 min, then at 375 for 30 min, and they came out wonderfully crunchy on the outside but so soft and tender on the inside! Will definitely make again!

This is a nice, slightly sweet side dish.  It works with russet or red potatoes, and I usually cut them in quarter inch slices to speed up the cooking time a little.

Super easy to do. Kids really liked this recipe, so I give it 4 stars. It was just so-so for me.  I used roasted garlic olive oil instead of butter. I doubled the amount for the sauce.   Make sure to give them enough room in the pan so they will roast and carmelize instead of steam. Definitely stir every ten minutes or so.

Really fantastic, went great with a peppercorn turkey breast I made. I tossed the potatoes and onion with the vinaigrette, then spread them on the pan. That made for a better coating. Some of the honey will burn, but it's easy to clean up if you use a silicone baking mat or some parchment paper.

Phenominal! This was a major hit at our house. This is what I did. I used 2 lbs of potatoes, 1/3 of a small onion, 1 stick (8 Tblsp) butter, 1/4 cup honey, 1 Tblsp dry mustard, 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper. This had to cook for 55 minutes, and I stirred the potatoes about every 20 minutes.

I used 3 tablespoons of honey, and finished them off under the broiler to give them a crisp coating.  They were very good potatoes, and I'll certainly make them again.

Simply delicious. Highly recommend. I doubled the melted butter, honey, mustard, salt and pepper and thought it was prefect. The honey taste is just light enough that you know it is there but you don't feel like you are eating dessert.

Very easy and quick, since the potatoes are quartered.  I did exactly as the recipe stated, covered the bottom of the pan in foil for less mess, but instead of making the sauce with the salt and pepper, mixed the butter, honey and mustard together, pourred on potatoes, then added the salt and pepper right on top of the potatoes.  This allows for a better idea of how much salt and pepper. you really need.

I like the idea of using honey, but I think this needs a little more salt and pepper.  Also, my cooking time was much longer.  After 35 minutes, the potatoes were soft but definitely not "roasted."  Another 10 minutes in the oven, though, and the potatoes had a nice crispy outside and soft inside.

Delicious!  I thought these may be too sweet, but they were just perfect!  Delicate flavour for the potatoes.  I loved them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made these several times and they're always delicious!  I mix the potatoes and onions in the bowl of the honey mix to fully coat each pieces.  After spreading out on a foil line sheet, I sprinkle with Lawry's Seasoned Salt since that's how we prepare all of our potatoes (tots and all!).  So good!

My new favorite way to make red potatoes!  Hot, cold, it doesn't matter, they were excellent either way!!!  LOVE them!  Will add more onions next time too, as the onions were fabulous in them.  (I used red onions) I paired them with the sage pork chops from this website and a fresh garden salad (from my own garden!)... my whole family ate an excellent dinner!

Made these 3 times in the last 3 weeks. Make extra redskins when boiling them for potato salad. Bake them in the oven as suggested. Really like the subtle sweetness of honey. Thanks

I like this recipe a lot.  I handpicked the smallest red potatoes I could find, cut them into quarters, and tossed them in the “drizzle” to be sure they were coated well.  For my small potatoes (slightly larger than golf balls) 30 minutes was exactly right but I did use the broiler for 3 minutes to finish them off with a crispy outside.  I never would have thought to pair these ingredients together but everyone loved the result (including me) so I plan on using this recipe over and over.

08/01/2009~These were good, just good. I followed the recipe exactly and the next time I make them I will double up on the honey and mustard. I may even use Dijon mustard or a honey Dijon mustard instead of the mustard powder. They were ever so slightly sweet. I WILL make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

Not such a big deal....at first....& then you find yourself going by for 1 more bite, then another & another until it's dinner time & 1/2 the pan is gone-no kidding! These are really delish! I doubled the sauce because I was actually using up a few extra potatoes. I'll definately be making these agin!

I thought these were great, but they have a mild flavor so if you are expecting an intense flavor you will be disappointed. My kids loved them, I served them with Honey BBQ Meatloaf from the Taste of Homes cook book.

My husband picked to make this potato recipe out of all the others listed for roasted potatoes.  This was absolutely delicious and we eat it with our dinners quite frequently now.  We used baby new potatoes instead of red potatoes and the flavor was still incredible.

DELICIOUS!!!  I made just a few changes.  I cut the potatoes smaller, I made more sauce and poured it over the potatoes after 30 minutes.  After 50 minutes I uncovered and drizzled honey over potatoes and put under the broiler for 15 minutes.  My family LOVED them!

I cut these into small bite-size peices, and did a little more sauce like other reviewers mentioned, and it turned out perfect. They were roasted and browned to perfection. The flavor was out of this world, and my whole family ATE IT UP and gave rave reviews on it also! (Which it's hard to get something everyone likes in my house).

Really good - kind of different.  I will make it again.  I may try broiling the potatoes at end - mine were not crispy AT ALL which I expect of roasted potatoes.  Great week night or company's coming recipe.

I made as written and it was fine but not fantastic. I think maybe more sauce might have helped as the potatoes didn't seem to soak up much of the flavor.

These were simply AWESOME!!! I did make sure to NOT layer the potatoes! I used about 6 medium red potatoes and the time to cook them was perfect! I did ad more honey and all the other stuff than called for to make sure it was enough! The flavor is outstanding!

These were delicious! I used oil instead of butter and doubled the other sauce ingredients. I will definitely be making this again.

These were good, but did not have the Wow factor. We could barely taste the honey. No one knew that there was honey in them until I told them. I normally do not like very sweet things and cut back on the sugar whenever possible, but in this case I think I would increase the honey to maybe 2 Tbsp. Actually if I made these again I would increase all the seasonings. They really didn't have a lot of flavor.

These were good. However, the amount of honey didn't even show through at all the first time I made them.  Also, I needed to cook mine at a higher temp for a ittle longer to brown the potatoes.  Great idea, easy, just I thought they needed a few adjustments for my tastes, little more honey, little more time and heat.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were very good.  I did add an extra tablespoon of honey and left out the onions.  I quartered the potatoes and then cut the quarters in half so that they would be done in 35 minutes.  I broiled them for 5 more minutes to make them crispy.  I was sad that there weren't any leftovers.

My family loved these potatoes!  I made it for 8 servings and followed the recipe almost exact.  I put a lil more honey and a lil more salt, and I also made my wedges smaller.  It was a great change from the same boring potatoes!

Amazing - couldn't keep my fingers out of the bowl.  Do like the other reviews say - double the honey, and half the butter - make sure you know how many pounds of potatoes you're using so you make enough of the sauce.  Great for company or a weeknight.

Had these last night for dinner, and they were fantastic!  I didn't have dry mustard, so I added chili powder, some cayenne and some thyme for extra herb flavor.  My only complaint is that they didn't get really crispy, but I think I was just using too many potatoes at once.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

These were pretty darned good.  I like others wondered about the spices.  Very good though.  I doubled the ingredients also. I didn't have allspice so just added a tad bit more of the cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Husband liked them too.  UPDATE Ooops...I doubled but not the baking ingredients I listed.  That was for the chicken I made to go with them...Sorry.

I followed others' advice and cooked them for longer and broiled them at the end.  I also used olive oil instead of melted butter and tossed the potatoes in it.  They came out great!!!  Didn't stick to the pan.

Definetly have to retry with boiling potatoes instead of baking (russet) potatoes. Need to put the mix all ingredients instead of applying honey last.

These potatoes turned out very good, however I should have taken the advice of others and doubled the honey mixture -- there just wasn't enough! I poured some last minute honey on top of the potatoes once they came out of the oven and that seemed to help a little but I still wished there was more.

Outstanding!  I served these as a side dish for Easter dinner and my family loved these taters.  The honey/butter/onion/mustard sauce was quite subtle, yet complimented the potatoes quite well.  My niece and sister left my house with this recipe.  Wonderful side dish!!

Everyone loved these!  I precooked them like another reviewer suggested, but mainly so I wouldn't have to roast them so long when I had something else I wanted to put in the oven.  I'm thinking they could be roasted at a higher temperature too.  Sprinkled with Kosher salt after they came out of the oven.  Mighty fine!

this was good, I just wasn't impressed.  I like that the honey flavor was subtle but I felt it was missing another layer of flavor.  My kids wouldn't eat it (2,5,&9) so I wont be making this again.

This is a beautiful dish to serve! The flavor is nice, the honey makes them special, but my personal preference is to use more seasoning and a few more onions. I would suggest placing them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them. Went great with our fish fry!!

Delicious! I doubled the sauce recipe and used plain old mustard, I also added a dash of cayenne. I chunked up the onions and threw them in with the potatoes. I did have to up the temp. or the seasoing would have stayed watery. I am giving it a 4 only because my husband didn't like them. That's ok, more for me!

Me and my fiancee love this recipe. The first time i made it we wished there was more sauce. So the next time i just doubled the sauce. I also used Goldens mustard instead of the dry mustard.

A favorite in our house to go with grilled chicken. Can play around with different herbs to get different flavors. I like it with rosemary and thyme.

My husband absolutely loves these potatoes! I double the honey & add a bit more salt than called for. The last time I made these I just cut a sweet onion in big chunks also & cooked right with the potatoes. I really wasn't expecting to like these, but they have become a favorite!

Very good. I scaled back the butter by half and doubled the honey and potatoes. Next time I will probably just omit the butter altogether as it really didn't seem to need it.

Didn't have reds so I figured, Yukon. I don't know whether it made a difference. The flavor is very very subtle.

My boyfriend and I thought these were delicious!  I made a little more of the glaze than called for, just because I knew it would be yummy.  The potatoes were soft, but it made them melt in your mouth.  SO GOOD!

Very tasty.  I enjoyed the addition of some cayenne pepper from another reviewer.  Also drizzled extra honey all over half-way through the cooking time.

The potatoes were soft but couldn't taste the sauce I even doubled it like one suggested and made sure every potato had plenty on it.  When I scrapped of off the glaze from the bottom of the pan and tasted it it was good but the potatoes just reminded me of the soft inside of french fries, they were good with ketchup though.

I Love these potatoes!! Granted I did not make them as directed, but I know that they are great. I used what I had on hand. I used fingerling potatoes cut into bite size pieces along with the onion. I just cut pats of butter and placed on top. Added honey, salt, pepper, garlic powder and a pinch or two of red pepper flakes. Roasted in oven, stirring every 15 minutes or so,until done. I like mine well roasted. I will try recipe as written I just didn't have any dry mustard on hand. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Would have been plain as written. I tripled the onion, doubled the honey, left out the butter, and doubled the salt & pepper. Baked for 15 minutes longer because I like them soft. Will add more honey & mustard next time.

Great recipe!  I use more honey and more butter and cook for a bit longer.  I also use more onion, and no dry mustard.  So, while I changed the recipe quite a bit I would never have thought to put these ingredients together and these are one of my very favorite side dishes!

These potatoes were great!  Everyone loved them even my daughter.  I took the advice of others and doubled the glaze.  I also cut the potatoes in to very small cubes so they would cook faster.  I will make these again!

These are super good.. I loved them. I used about 5 medium potatoes, cut into bite size pieces. I didn't feel that I had quite enough sauce on them, so I doubled the sauce. I probably had more potatoes than the recipe called for. I did substitute olive oil for the butter, and I used sea salt and whole grain mustard.I will be making these again. They were good warmed a little the next day as well.

An AMAZING potato recipe.   I was a little leery about adding the honey, but so glad I followed the recipe exactly.  I had 10 people over for dinner and they devoured the potatoes, everone asked for the recipe.  My husband even said they were the best roasted potatoes he has eaten, I agree.  Terrific recipe!

I absolutely LOVED these.  I like anything with honey in it, though.  I doubled the sauce recipe and increased the honey amount to make it nice and sticky.  My husband didn't like them, though.  He wouldn't even eat them.  That's OK, there was more for me!  I won't make them again simply because it means I'd have to make another side dish for hubby, and that's not happening!

My husband loved this, but i just thought it was o.k. it wasn't bad and wasn't good all at the same time. It was lacking a little flavor for me, i was expecting something a little different, just kind of tasted like a little sweeter red potatoe. I added some ketchup and it was fine. I'll end up making it again because the hubby and 13 month old loved them.

I followed some of the other suggestions and doubled up on the ingredients. Added a nice flavor to the potatoes. Very easy to do.

I had a dinner party of nine last night and I had red potatos to cook but wanted to do something different with then so of course I chose to look here on this wonderful site. Man were these good, everyone loved them!!! I did add more honey like someone suggested. 3T instead of 2 and left everything else the way that it was. I also did cut the potato into bite size pieces and it too about an hour for them to cook, but boy was it worth the wait.
THANK YOU for this great recipe

Just the right amount of glaze.  I had to cook a bit longer, but otherwise a great recipe.

I took others' advice and used 2 Tbsp. honey, mixed the ingredients beforehand, and lined my dish with foil to avoid sticky clean up.  A big hit.  Next time I might try someone else's suggestion to spray the dish with PAM and omit the butter altogether.

This was a little strange, I was craving something sweet with dinner and was highly disappointed with this recipe.

The potatoes were cooked perfectly but the potato honey combo was just not for us.

This has a really light yummy taste.  It makes a great side dish, but if you can't measure "1 lb" I would double the "sauce" ingredients to be safe.

This is a great recipe.  My 19 year old son was the one to find it and make it for our family.  Now anytime we need a potato side dish I have him make it for us.  Just one thing, we prefer to have a little more flavoring, so he doubles the sauce.  But it is great just the way the recipe says.

Good method for serving red potatoes.  Not sweet as you would expect.  I added about 50% more butter and put salt and pepper to the top of the prepared dish, not in the ingredients.

I have tried this recipe MULTIPLE times. I have done it exactly as the recipe says. I have tried doing it the way people in reviews have done it and for the life of me, I CANNOT get it right. The honey glaze is amazing by itself, but I wish I could try it without my potatoes being too mushy or over-cooked. Good luck if you can get it right. If you figure out the magic secret, please let me know, because I am dying to try a good version of this recipe. :(

We loved these potatoes. They were the perfect complement to the grilled chicken I served. I did add another tablespoon of honey because I wanted them to be a bit sweet, and it worked out perfectly.

The only thing I'll say is that the cooking time really depends on the size of red potatoes you buy. Our reds were a bit on the bigger side and it took us a full hour to cook them.

Will definitely add this to the repertoire. Thank you!

Not bad!  My husband really loved these.  I will make again only with much more onion.  It definitely has a sweetness to it, so it's more of an option of roasted potatoes, along with a spicier or herby recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

These are the best potatoes ever! My family and friends constantly request this recipe at gatherings and bbqs. For perfect potatoes, I either reserve some sauce or make extra sauce to put on the potatoes in the last 10 minutes of baking. This is one of the best recipes that I have discovered on this site!

I liked these potatoes but will add a little more honey next time.  Didn't really have that sweet honey taste I was hoping for.

These potatoes were so good!!!  I did make some alterations to the directions after reading some reviews.  I cut the potatoes into smaller chunks so they would be done in the 35 minutes.  I did not mix the salt and pepper into the sauce.  I seasoned the cut potatoes on the baking sheet.  Mixed the remaining sauce ingredients and poured over the potatoes.  I did cut down on the amount of sauce.  I used 3 lbs of potatoes but only doubled the sauce amount.  It turned out perfectly.  My husband, parents and boys loved them.  I will definitely make these again.

Easy & something different than baked potato. I did take others suggestion & double the sauce & fry the onion. Will try using my roaster next time so it doesn't heat the kitchen during the summer.

These were so good, I made them with the sweet and sour meatloaf also on this site, and it was a great compliment.  Next time I think I will add a little bit more honey.

I really liked these, though many people who tried them were not really impressed.  I made double the amount of sauce and used the left over amount as a dip.  I think the honey taste is something you either love or dislike.

These were good but not great.  They weren't very tasty to us.  My mother-in-law asked what the seasoning was and said "Oh, it's different."  I won't make these again.

I really thought this was just so-so.  Not much flavor, even though I added more salt.  More seasoning would make it better.  It was just too bland for me.

This was a good recipe.  I did add some Dijon mustard and some chopped Viadalia Onion.  Great flavor, but it still came out a little dry for me, but that can be fixed with a touch of olive oil.  It was still a hit.  We had left-overs and I turned those into a really great potato salad the next day. To be honest I liked it better as a potato salad. :-)

Sorry, but we weren't very impressed with these.  I could see liking them with some of the changes suggested by other reviewers, but as is, they were just ok.

These aren't bad at all. I like the flavor - I used more than a pound of potatoes so I made more sauce and I cut them in smaller chunks. I also used white potatoes (all I had). Next time I will make these more like my steak fries. Same recipe, but bake at 425 for about 35 minutes just to get a more browned potato. I look forward to trying this with red potatoes, but the white potatoes were good, too. I really liked the flavor!

Very, very good! These took longer than the time suggested. I used onion and garlic powder, 4tbs margarine, was out of honey so I used corn syrup, and added salt to taste. They got nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Someone asked what "seasoning" did I put on the potatoes, I told them and they didn’t believe me! HA! Too bad! So simple and so good. Thanks!

These were good but I feel like they needed a little more salt and I really didn't taste the sweet from the honey.  I will try again and add just a bit more.

wonderful! my husband really liked the potatos. Took a while to bake in the oven and maybe a bit too moist if too much sauce is made, but other then that they tasted wonderful and will be part of our regular dinner menu at our house.

These potatoes were super simple to make!  They had just the right amount of sweetness.  My husband and I both thought that, sweetness aside, they were a little bit tasteless.  Maybe more honey/butter would help?

Great recipe. Next time I will double the sauce. Also used half sweet potatoes and half red potatoes, and I loved the two types of potatoes. My husband loved it, and we will make it again.

This was very good. I cut the potatoes smaller & when it was the half way point, I sprinkled some Rosemary/Garlic Seasoning on and stirred them. I'll definitely make this again.

this is the best red potato recipe i have ever tasted! words cannot describe how good it is!  i doubled the sauce and used half of a red onion cut into rings and it was delicious! it also took closer to 50 minutes to get done in the oven, but it was well worth the wait!

Made these last night with potato, parsnip and carrot - the parsnips were the best I've ever had, but the potatoes and carrots, while good, weren't as different as I'd hoped. Ended up doing them under the grill in order to brown them - they did have a lovely, if fairly faint, flavour, but they may have been overpowered by the main dish. Main issue just that, for the amount of effort involved in making the sauce, they didn't really taste too different from my usual roast veg (I normally just parboil them and toss them in oil and instant gravy powder, which gives them a great slightly flavoured crust). I parboiled them to speed up the cooking process and to give the softened outsides a chance to absorb some of the flavours - agree with an earlier reviewer who said the baking sauce was delicious but the veg didn't seem to absorb it. I did use Dijon mustard rather than dry, and I think this contributed to the sauce being a bit too wet - next time I'll use dry or cut the butter/olive oil by half - I cut it by a bit, but not enough, clearly. However, they were very nice, just not completely mindblowing. But I will make them again, if only for the sake of the melt-in-the-mouth parsnips, with those adjustments.

This recipe is my new favorite way to cook red potatoes.  We have potatoes different ways at least twice a week in our house, and this will become a regular recipe for us.  I didn't have dry mustard so I just used regular deli mustard.  It was delicious!

I was so disappointed because it sounded so good.  Very bland, not nearly enough sweetness to make it special, and doubling the sauce just made them softer.  I like the idea of honey on potatoes, but this isn't the recipe for us.

These were just okay for me.  I felt they were a little too buttery and seemed to be missing something.  I am going to try some reviewer's suggestions and play around with this a little bit.  These were not a total let down, but just not what I was expecting.

Very good! My husband is a die hard potatoes guy and he loved it. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out great.

YUM!  The only thing that I changed (because of concerns raised by other reviewers) was to add 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce to the honey mixture.  It was perfect--the potatoes were tender and crisp with a little kick.  Thanks!

Amazingly good.  Great twist on plain old potatoes.  I doubled the sauce and let it sit in the fridge all day.  I was in a rush, so I microwaved for 10 min and finished in the oven for 30.

This was okay.  I should've cut the potatoes smaller.  I ended up doubling the sauce because it just didn't seem like enough while making it.  Even with double the sauce, it wasn't quite a flavorful and I had hoped and expected.  Maybe with more onion and like mentioned already, smaller potato pieces.  Won't be putting it on the dinner rotation.

The mixture of the onions and the honey made for a very tasty dish.  I did not taste the mustard at all.  This was a good side dish and an excellent compliment to a meal.

Good potatoes, not the best, but still very good. I cooked them at 400 degrees as suggested by other reviews. Will definitely make them again. Nice switch from mashed potatoes.

I really liked this recipe. The sweetness to the potatoes was really good. I would have to increase the cooking time next time because some potatoes were still a little too firm for my taste.

Big hit with my family!

I didn't have onion but used onion powder - I will definitely make it with an onion next time (and there WILL be a next time!)  

I didn't follow the measurements exactly - after reading so many of the reviews, there was so much different advice.  I just tossed the ingredients together, probably used more than a pinch of salt, even added a bit of chili powder.  I used half butter and half olive oil but bet it would work just fine with only olive oil.

Definitely 5 stars!

yummy. added an extra 10 minutes to cooking time to make extra crispy but maybe I will increase to 15 to ensure centers are done completely or slice the potatoes into smaller pieces.  Also I would increase the "sauce" just a little more for extra flavor but overall it was not terribly bland, just a nice subtle flavor.

Just made these..DELICIOUS...so simple yet perfect,not overdone or too many flavors trying to compete. I did increase the butter to 4 tablespoons, but I think that is just personal preference. Highly recommended thanks for the recipe :)

I was looking forward to trying these for quite awhile, and tonight was the night. Served them with Chicken Breasts with Balsamic Vinegar and Garlic from this site, and green beans. I made a little extra sauce, and kept them in the oven longer to attempt to get that nice golden-brown "roasted potato" look and flavor, but I agree with what others have said, that there wasn't much flavor to them.  Thank you for letting me try your recipe, Stephanie!

Really wanted to love this recipe but there just wasn't a lot of flavor.  I took the advice of several other reviewers and doubled the sauce mixture and still seemed bland.  Could have been my fault so I'll still give it a 3.

I made this the other night with London Broil, and it was great!  So easy to make, I did add more butter though, and a little more honey, and they turned out fantastic.  My babysitter made them with eggs the next morning for my son, and they were good the next day.  It's a keeper!

These were pretty good, I was looking for something different with potatoes. I used onion powder instead of chopped onions because my friend doesn't like onions in things. I think they could use some extra seasoning though, but overall enjoyed very much.

This is the only way (besides fries) that I can get my kids to eat potatoes. I use Monin Liquid Honey Sweetener and use 3 pumps and use some dried onion seasoning instead of fresh and it is great

So good! I would have never thought to use honey in potatoes. I'm so glad I found this recipe. :] I made them the first time exactly as the recipe calls for, and the second time I made them I just boiled the potatoes and drizzled the sauce over. Even good without the onions. Thanks so much!

These were ok. They didn't have the taste I was looking for. Maybe I should have added more honey?? Won't make these again.

Mmm...these were great!  I would use that honey mustard sauce in all sorts of things.  I actually made the potatoes in a skillet.  (10 min. in a couple tablespoons of butter, covered on medium heat, then 10 minutes uncovered until crispy.  Add the honey mustard at the end.)  Delicious!  :)
...
I tried it in the oven and it wasn't as good.

I have made these potatoes on several occasions and it is part of my permanent file.  Yes the flavors may be subtle but the combination I think is wonderful.  In fact I am making these potatoes this evening with a pork tenderloin.

Interesting but yummy combination!  I preboiled the potatoes for about 10 minutes and still baked them longer than the suggested time. Cutting the onions in rings allowed my husband to pick them out.

I made with canned new potatoes, my husband went back for seconds. They were very moist and delicious. The honey was just the right amount, not overpowering.

I liked this recipe but I had to add more honey and I actually added alittle cayenne to give the potatoes better flavor otherwise with just the main ingredients they were pretty bland.

These potatoes are really good. The honey adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance the mustard & onion. The cooking time was a bit off as I baked them for about an hour & a half. I like really brown crisp potatoes which is why I cooked them for so long.

I made this for the frist time the other night when we had company over.  I used baby gold potatoes instead and cut them smaller then suggested.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so here are the following substitutions I made.  I used Maple Syrup instead of Honey, I used dried minced onion instead of fresh, Sea Salt, and I also added 1 Tlb of Emeril's Essence.  I doubled the amount of sauce and baked it all on a Stone Bar Pan.  I kept it covered with foil for 15 min and then uncovered for another 20 min.  They didn't have any crispiness, so next time I think I will only keep them covered for 10 min or not at all.  My family and company loved these and I will make them again.  I think I will still make them with the above changes.  Thanks for sharing.

6/1/07 Updated review.  I just made these again using fresh red potatoes and a whole Vidalia onion and they were delicious.  In fact, I like them so much I made them two nights in a row.  The second night I used the sauce on halved sunburst/pattypan squash as well and baked these in a separate dish for the last 15 minutes.  Original review . . . I thought these were pretty good but next time I'll double the sauce so I can taste more of it.  I used a bag of "Simply Potatoes" red potato wedges which made the recipe extremely fast and easy.

I was unimpressed by this dish.  I expected the potatoes to have a distinct flavor, but it really just ended up tasting like a batch of roasted potatoes, even after drizzling some extra honey on them while cooking - not a bad thing, but not very interesting.

I hate to go against the majority, but we weren't thrilled with this recipe.  The potatoes got nice and crispy, but the honey flavoring was bland.  I doubled the sauce per other reviews, but it seems as if it was missing something. I probably won't make again.

I triped the recipe cause i wanted to make sure it had enough sauce, but i only doubled the butter. I had to cook them 20 minutes longer cause they weren't done inside. My husband says he LOVES them, so this is a keeper.

Very good. Potatoes got a nice colour to them. Next time I am going to try adding more "glaze" though. They could use a little more honey.They were delicious and super easy to make. I quickened the cooking time by par-boiling my potatoes too.

I was looking for something different to do with potatoes - WOW! Am I glad I tried this recipe. This was very good. I made them for the family the other night for dinner and served them with gilled pork tenderloin and green beans. They were a hit. I am planning to make them again this evening for our dinner guest. Thank you for sharing!!

My whole family really loved these potatoes. I used russet and mixed them well with the mixture before putting them in the oven. Then mixed them around half way through. They were great and cooked up nice. I am always looking for a new way to cook potatoes. Thanks for the terrific recipe!

Good spuds.  If you double the sauce, you might not want to double the honey; it can get too sweet.  Tasty recipe.

Wonderful potatoes! The honey added a unique flavour with just a hint of sweetness - people may not even know it's in there without being told. I will definitely make these again.

These were so quick, easy and yummy!  I put all the ingredients in a bowl and tossed, then put them on my stoneware pan to bake.  *~Note~* I did use olive oil instead of butter and it worked fine.  These were even good the next day in my lunch.  One of the girls at work tried one and took down the recipe.

These were nice a nice change - would be good served with fried chicken.  Instead of drizzling the honey over the potatoes, I tossed them in the honey mixture, they turned out great.

Used Rustic potatoes and chopped them into bite-sized pieces.  Scrumptious side dish!  So sweet!

I LOVE this recipe!  I was looking for something simple, and something that would require ingredients that I already had. I was a little skeptical at first, I wasnt sure how sweet it would be, but it turns out the honey adds just a touch of sweetness, its not too overpowering at all!  I used regular mustard and 1 onion chopped up.  I used a little more salt and pepper than listed as well.  YUM this is gonna be a regular now, thanks!

I thought this recipe was just average.  The potatoes were ok, I just thought they would have more of a honey flavor to them.

I don't know- maybe I did something wrong. These were very bland to me. I'm gonna try cutting them up smaller and maybe trying a casserole dish or something next time!

This recipe is delicious! My Fiance loves them, I love them! I always add a bit more honey than called for. I also use prepared mustard instead of dry- they always turn out wonderful.

Wonderful!  I have used this recipe on many occasions and it always gets rave reviews.  I omit the dry mustard and use whatever herbs complement the meal I am serving.

So easy and yum...especially the onions that had carmelized. The servings were quite small, though, for four people, but perfect with a salad as an additional side.

Pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and my family ate all of them.   A nice change and a keeper for us.  Thanks for sharing!
