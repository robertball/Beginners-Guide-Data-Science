I had this recipe from a crock pot book that I had. I serve mine with egg noodles. I also used 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt in stead of garlic salt. Always a hit!!!

My family really enjoyed this meal.  I didn't change a thing, served over buttered noodles. Very easy to throw together.  Come home to a delicious hot meal!

I have made a similar recipe for the stovetop for years and was looking for a slow cooker version.  This was perfect!  I mixed the dry ingredients in a large bowl and then tossed the beef cubes in it. Placed them in the slow cooker, layered the sliced onions, and topped it with the tomatoes. Couldn't have been easier. I did use 1 Tbsp. of paprika, as my original recipe calls for  a lot. Served on hot egg noodles, with a side of kale. A hearty and tasty winter meal. Thanks for sharing!

I would give this recipe 4.5 stars if I could.  I think it's a really good base for an even better goulash.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, with the addition of some fresh carrots, celery and leaves, parsley, and oregano (partly for texture and added veggies, and partly because these were things that I needed to use up in my fridge :D).  I added the carrots and celery in with the beef and onion, and coated all of that with the flour mixer, and then mixed everything else in and give it a light stir.  I also used smoked paprika, just for a little something different.  The recipe, with the addition of the few things I added, was just enough "sauce" for one pound of pasta, which is approx. 4c of dry elbow macaroni.  Unless you are really trying to stretch this meal, I think 7c of pasta (as listed in the original ingredient list) is a little excessive; but you could always add more liquid to create a thinner "sauce".  We preferred the thickness of the sauce just as it was once the sour cream was added in, it was perfect for us.  Also, I cooked this on high for 5hrs (stirring it once during that time), then after 5hrs added the sour cream and let it cook on high for another 30min, then turned it off with the lid on for another 30min or so.  This was a really easy meal that I was able to let cook in the crock pot all day on Sunday while I did my cleaning.  Thanks!

I made this recipe as submitted, and it was a bit bland. The addition of carrots and celery is a very good idea and I will try it next time. Along with twice the paprika and salt.

Oh my was this good! Very simple, love that I could use my crockpot. I did add some chopped carrots and celery and a little Turkish seasoning that I have. The whole family loved this, even my 7 year old son! Leftovers were great for lunch the next day. We will be making this one again!

I definitely enjoyed this recipe. I added egg noodles about 20 minutes before I added the sour cream and it turned out wonderful. Great flavors with this!

I took the advice of one of the other people who made it before me, and I added the carrots and celery and twice the salt and paprika. I also used the egg noodles. Soooo good! :)

I am not so sure I like this.  I made a huge batch.  I substituted V8 and tomatoes for the canned tomatoes and that may have made the difference.

We liked this. Even with the addition of the carrots and celery it was bland, but perhaps that is how Hungarian goulash is supposed to taste.  I'm considering adding some spice, but what? for next time, maybe more smoked paprika?

The meat was tender, the way I like it.  What it lacked was flavor, lots of it.

Very good. My boys loved it and its great because the one with only 5 teeth could eat too with almost no extra prep (save cutting his noodles in half). I subbed ground beef, added celery and a little grated carrot that had on hand.  Two other adult family members enjoyed it, too!  I found I should have doubled the amount of pasta, though. Would add either more garlic salt or use regular salt in addition, next time, too
