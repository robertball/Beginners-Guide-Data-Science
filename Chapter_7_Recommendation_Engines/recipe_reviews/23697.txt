Made this as a quick glaze for my ham. I doubled the recipe for a 7.5lb pre-cooked ham and had more than enough. I cooked the ham at 350 for 2hrs. After the first hour I added the glaze. The entire 7.5 lb ham disappeared in less than a 1/2 hr.

This Glaze really makes Ham taste Special! It was so quick and easy. The  clove really gives it flavor.I was out of minced onion so I used 1 teaspoon of onion powder. I also used 1/2 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp of ginger.This smelled so Wonderful. My husband brought some leftovers for work today and it filled the lunchroom with a extra special aroma - everyone wanted to know what he had. I made this with "Scalloped potatoes and Onions" - a recipe on this site. The potatoes cooked at 325 along with the ham. We had a Great dinner. Delicious !!! Thank you for sharing your recipe Sara

As a harried father conscripted into cooking dinner on Christmas day, I found this recipe perfect.  I substituted pineapple juice and tomato puree for the ketchup, and I had pierced liberally my ham with cloves before cooking.  Beyond being surprised that I had made the glaze, guests commented that it was the tastiest ham they had tasted.  This one works.

Way too strong tasting with the ketchup in it.  Overpowered the delicate taste of the ham. My family loves ham and they didn't like this too much.

I was out of dried minced onion, so I used 1 t. of onion powder instead. I didn't glaze the ham, I just served the sauce alongside. The only problem was that the sauce was a bit too sweet. So, I added a bit more of mustard, and it was fabulous then. Even my mother, who usually doesn't like glazed or sweetened meats, enjoyed this with her baked ham.

Awesome sauce Sarah! My family loved it. I may inject some into the ham next time to get the flavor through. As is I also stirred some into the beans I served with dinner. I was doubtful about the ketchup but it blended perfectly. This might be a good base for a bbq sauce as well.

This was a very tasty recipe! My family are not big ham eaters, but this recipe hit home! Many compliments on the flavor and smell! I cooked mine in a clay cassarole dish, and it was tender and the flavor sank throughout the ham! Great job Sara! This one will stay in my family for a long time!

Finally - a recipe worthy of 5 Stars!
This glaze was the best I have ever come across!  When my son, who isn't a big ham eater, goes back for 3rds and 4ths, you know it's more than the ham he likes!  Quick, easy and full of flavor, this glaze is great!

The flavor is great, but it didn't really "glaze" on the ham as I expected it to.  It melted off the ham and ended up in the bottom of the roasting pan with the pan juices, so I just drizzled the pan juice/glaze mixture over the ham before serving.

This was very simple and easy to make.  I won't try this one again, I like my honey glaze really sweet.  This was more of a sweet bar-b-que sauce.  Next time I'll use a honey and brown sugar recipe.

This was very tasty.  I can't compare it to any other ham glaze I've ever had-the taste is completely different.  But we liked it!  I only gave it 4 stars because I prefer the typical ham glaze, however this was a great alternative.

I did not care for this glaze at all. I think it was the ketchup that I didn't like much. It tasted like sloppy joe mix. Not a flavor that went well with ham at all.

Yum!  I whipped this up in about 2 mintues and since I ran out of Ginger, I subsituted with cardamom.  It was awesome!  Even my pickey two year old used it as "dipping sauce" for his ham.  It was an awesome, quick and easy recipe.  Try it with the cardamom too!

Last Christmas was mine and my husband's first Christmas together, and also my first ham! This recipe really came to the rescue. I didn't realize until throwing it all together in a blender that I didn't have enough honey. I did have brown sugar, however, and so I used 1/3c honey and 2/3c brown sugar. It turned out great! My husband said it was the best ham he had ever had, and I'd have to say the same!

This is a GREAT glaze! I'm thinking of trying it on chicken or pork chops. I cut this recipe in half, then in half again to glaze a 2 lb fully cooked extra lean ham. I cooked it at 325 for 45 min, then poured about 3 tbsp of the glaze on the ham, then cooked it for another 15 min. Best glaze I've ever had-thank you!

This is the best glaze ever! I am not a ham eater. I dreaded making my first one ever. This was a hit and I didn't even have any ham left over. My kids LOVED this and so did my in-laws!  Thank you so much sal!  I did have to make one modification because I didn't have a full cup of honey. I had 3/4 cup so I used 1/4 c of pure maple syrup and 1/8 of cup sugar. Can't wait to make this again!

Made this recipe for a yummy 8lbs ham I got from the butcher.  I made the glaze but barely used it.  My husband and I thought it was a bit too mustardy.  I brushed some on a few slices and I ate them but my husband had his plain.  The recipe wasn't bad, but we probably wouldn't make it again.

Delicious!! My family loved the flavour that this sauce gave the ham.  I didn't have dried minced onion, so I used 1/2 tsp onion powder, and it tasted awesome. I also glazed the ham an hour after baking, and continued to cook for another hour.  So Good!!!

Tried this ham for dinner the other night, and my husband really liked it.  We both decided that a little less mustard would be better the next time I make it - and there will be a next time!  Great recipe!

Yum!  This was so easy and quick to make.  I only made half of the recipe for a amall amount of ham that I threw into my crock pot.  I somehow measured wrong when I was making it (I added too much mustard), so I just added a spoonful of frozen orange juice concentrate to balance it out, and it was still super delicious!

Unless you like the tasting ketchup with your ham this one is no good.  Some flavors just don't mix.  Come on, ketchup and ham, bad, bad, bad.  I'm glad I didn't try this one on a holiday!

This recipe is easy, uses common ingrediants, and tastes great.  I used this sauce not only on ham, but other meats (chicken nuggets for example).  Excellent recipe.  Thanks!!  I recently used this sauce over baked potatoes...excellent

This sauce was amazing! It only took about a minute to put together and tasted great. Next time though, I think I'll add less katsup and a little more mustard, to give it a tangier flavor.

We initially used this for ham but now we cut the portion in half and use every time we grill ham steaks. Still a fav after 4 years.

Excited because of the great reviews but it was terrible. As others said it was way too strong tasting.  More importantly, the flavor was just off. The ingredients did not mesh. Overall it was very unappetizing.  My husband, who will eat almost anything, thought it was bad.

Used this on our 8lb bone in, Christmas ham. Spooned it over the ham before baking. And twice while baking. Tangy and strong. Not bad, but I think I like pineapple better.

This was OK.  It had a really strong taste of I dont know what.  I did not put on ham when it was cooking so that may have been the problem.  Maybe next time I will try that.

This was perfect as-is.  All four kids ate it up, and the girls raved about it while eating it!  Smells good, too.  I used it on ham steaks from Costco, broiled them 10 min per side :)  Will make again.  Oh, and for my ham steak, I cut the recipe down to 1/4 batch, and it made enough for two ham steaks ;)

What a great recipe to make on a busy night!  Easy to make using standard pantry ingredients, too.  I usually grill ham steaks or even smoked pork chops and then brush the glaze on the slices just before they come off the grill.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was very very good I did try it on pork ribs, which I boiled a bit 1st then put them under the broiler adding more sauce to them as they cooked. The ribs were very tender and very tasty. Thank you for the great recipe. Diane next going to try it on some chicken wings.

Very good and very easy. Had a somewhat dry/freezer kept too long type ham and this sauce made it delicious. This is going in my keep file and yes I can see about using it for chicken nuggets as well. Good job Sara, Thanks!!

This was wonderful!!  At the last minute, I wanted a glaze to serve with the ham and I had all of these ingredients on hand.  It is such a tasty glaze and my guests loved it!  It also worked great with the leftovers.  This is a keeper!!!  Thanks Sara!  :o)

This glaze is awesome!  I buy a spiral sliced half ham with a sweet glaze.  I put the sugar glaze in with this glaze and mix all together.  Then I pour half the glaze over the ham in a cooking bag.  When the ham is heated through, I pour the rest of the glaze on the ham and let it sit for a bit.  I get this request from the big family gathering every year.  It makes an awesome au jus that they just pour on the ham.

This was definitely different.  Not so sure about the ketchup in this though.  Tatsed kinda "off" to me.  My son liked it though. We tried it on a ham steak and the glaze didn't really "glaze".  As it cooked the glaze became watery.  Maybe it was that the ham had lots of water in it?  Don't know.  Thanks anyway!  My son ate meat and that;s all that counts, I guess.

So easy to make with simple ingredients. I didn't change the recipe at all. Flavour is wonderful.  I doubled my recipe and basted the ham at intevals during the last hour or.  I still had lots of glaze left over for the dinner table.  Very good flavour, you won't be disappointed!

I thought this had a fabulous taste.  I put in 3/4 cup agave instead of 1 cup honey (agave is much sweeter).  I also put in stone ground mustard because I didn't have regular mustard.  It was great!

Pretty tasty.  If you're looking for a good glaze, this will do.  I will probably try something else next time since this was my first ham and I'd like to experiment with other tastes.

Delicious! I used it last night to glaze my Christmas Spiral cut ham, which I thought would come with a glaze packet but didn't.   I didn't have any dried minced onion, but it was fine without it. Everyone loved it.

This is a pretty versatile recipe- ingredients can be exchanged with good results.  I used less honey and added some orange zest that I had on hand. Also substituted barbeque sauce for catsup and added cumin for some added smokiness.  I used some as a glaze and heated some up to use as a dip.

This was delicious. I need a quick but flavorful ham glaze and this is certainly it!  Most of the items I already had in stock, so it was really easy!  We cut a ham into slices, added the glaze and grilled.   YUM!!!

Made this for Easter dinner. Hubby couldn't stop picking the ham off the bone!
Was out of worcestershire and minced onion, so used tamari soy sauce and onion powder, but it was absolutely delicious.

Like many other reviewers mentioned, this would make a good dip for chicken nuggets.  It has a good taste - similar to bbq sauce, however, I didn't think it made a very good "ham glaze".  Definately a good dipping sauce for many things, but not special enough to pour over a ham!

Excellent. This was exactly what I was looking for. I was out of minced onion but it still tasted great. We even used it as a dipping sauce for the ham.

I made ham for Christmas '06 using this recipe for the first time and received great reviews.  I made a slight alteration, however.  I substituted pineapple preserve for the honey.  It turned out fabulously.
