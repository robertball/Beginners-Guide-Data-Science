This Dressing is good, but not Great.  I found it to be lacking some zip.  I added a tablespoon Dijon Mustard and it really helped.  Also a little cracked black pepper finished it off.  My guests really liked it on a mixed field greens salad with mandrian oranges and sugared pecans.

rating based on recipe as written: insipid and a little cloying. with a little monkeying around, ended up with a 5 star product. My orange was pretty sweet so subbed a pinch of stevia for 1 tsp sugar. There's almost no acidity in recipe, so I added 1 Tbl rice wine vinegar. Following advice of previous reviewer, added a little cracked black pepper.  Let sit a couple hours and had a great dressing for tangy mesclun and grilled chicken paillard.  But I can't stand people who change a recipe beyond recognition, then rate it 5 stars because they ended up with something good. People, can't we rate the written recipe, not our experimentation?

I liked this recipe and have added it to my box.  I wanted a bit more kick so I put in an extra pinch of cayenne and cinnamon.  Also, I omitted the dried orange peel because I didn't have any on hand.  I served it over spinach with mandarin oranges and walnuts.  Next time, though, I will use less orange juice - it was a bit much with the mandarin oranges.

We started Valentine's dinner with this dressing on a simple salad of spring mix greens, sliced almonds, and mandarin oranges. It was very tasty!

Sorry - I gave it a go despite some low reviews, but in the end I had to leave it on the table. I made it as written - the cinnamon was a real turnoff for myself and my husband, but even without it I'm not sure it would have been good on salad. Maybe better as sauce on chicken or something?

yuk, not a keeper or repeat dressing.  This should have some oil in it to emulsify better. otherwise it is too runny.

at first, i tried it as stated above. i found the yogurt, cayenne and cinnamon to be off.  i finally gave in, by just using spicy honey mustard, orange juice, a small splash of rice wine vinegar, miracle whip, splenda, grated ginger, white sesame seeds and some grated carrots

My family absolutely loved this. When I get a bunch of fresh fruit that they are sort "done with," I make a big salad with this and they down it in a hurry.

Yogurt, ginger, orange peel, and cayenne make this dressing tasty enough to convince you to tweak it until you like it. I ended up adding a bit of sour cream to help with texture and flavor. Adding some black pepper and leaving out the sugar made me like it more. Thank you for the recipe.
