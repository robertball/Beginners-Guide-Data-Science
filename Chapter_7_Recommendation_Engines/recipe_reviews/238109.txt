I typed in easy cookie receipt and this one caught my eyes. 
We just made them for Christmas cookies. They are really good but, do not make them if you are not ok with coconut. If you like German Chocolate then these are for you.  They are very cakey in the middle.
Enjoy.

I know people hate when reviewers tweak the recipe then review. BUT, I just tweakwd it for estitics. 
I added everything but the coconut and pecans to the batter.  I scooped batter onto the pan, then placed 4 pecans on top.  I pulled them out half way through baking and added a southern carmel icing with the sweetend coconut, then finished baking.

Very tasty cookies, I made these without the coconut, pecans and chocolate chunks.  I'll be making them again!

they're amazing. I didn't have coconut to put in but they're like mini cakes. very simple but addicting. some chocolate bars probably could be added to boost the chocolate flavor. great when you're in the mood to bake but low on ingredients
