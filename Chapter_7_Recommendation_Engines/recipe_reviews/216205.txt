Made these cookies for Thanksgiving and were a big hit..they didn't last the day.  The flavor is awesome.  I plan on making for Christmas and partially dipping them in chocolate.

this is a definite keeper.  super easy.  i used cherry & white chocolate chips in place of the cranberries - only because i didn't have them on hand.  i will definitely try them as written.

I omitted the dried cranberries and extra nuts, and added a splash of both vanilla and almond extracts as well as a 1/4 cup of cream cheese. Everyone loved them!

While these are great cookies, using melted butter or margarine gives them a runny consistency that makes for a thin cookie. I suggest using butter that is chilled/room temperature.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I didn't think these tasted like pistachio at all. It tasted like almond extract instead. They're good if that's the flavor you're looking for, but I wanted more of a pistachio flavor. I probably won't make these again.

A very popular cookie I added pistachio nutmeats to mine.  Who doesn't like cranberries and pistachios.  The red and green combo makes this a perfect Xmas cookie-and not quite so sweet as so many of them tend to be.

I make these frequently and change them up a bit each time. I add a whole 6oz package of pistachios for a stronger nut flavor. Also, I add white chocolate chips to them in addition to or in place of the cranberry. I've also make them with chocolate chips instead of the cranberry and that worked well, too. So if you don't have cranberries on hand, change it up for white chocolate or semisweet chocolate chips and you won't regret it. I agree with others that 9 minutes is exactly enough or they will brown up and potentially burn fast.

These are ALWAYS a hit! I add white chocolate chips for the POW they need and watch out! I don't generally add the pistachio nuts because it would add a huge cost to making these.
