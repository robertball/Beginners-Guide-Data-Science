I don't eat chicken on a bone often, so I made this marinade and used boneless 
chicken breasts.  Brushed it on the chicken while cooking and turned out excellent!
Very tender, juicy and flavorful.  Would make again

If I could give this one 10 stars, I would.  I've made this one about 15 times now.  Usually, after 2 or 3 times, I'll change a recipe around a little just to experiment.  Not this one.  It's too good to fool with!  Any time we discuss cooking chicken on the grill, it always comes back to this recipe.

Since we use skinless, boneless chicken breasts we used the spices & beer as a marinade. It was ok, but won't make again this way. We'll wait until we have a whole chicken & try as recommended, & then determine if it is a keeper or not.

This is a poor substitute for the original Beer Can Chicken, using the whole, uncut chicken, with the can of beer in the rear cavity, propped up on the legs and beer can bottom.

Cooked two birds on a gas barbecue, so the only step I missed was throwing garlic on the coals at the end.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly for thanksgiving.  The whole family raved, and asked for the recipe.  Thanks.

Great recipe, highly reccommend this. The only thing I added was a teaspoon of Paprika and a teaspoon of Lawry's seasoning salt. I had a feeling it would be bland without seasoning (several of the reviewers were commenting on that). This really made a difference. It was delicious!

This recipe was fast to do, and tasted good, and it did not seem to have an overpowering flavor
to it.  I was expecting a hardier taste to it, but it was easier to add more flavor than to take it 
away.  It was overall a grand recipe, and is something different other than the regular bbq
chicken that most people do.  I would give this overall (out of 5)  a 4 1/2.  A definite try for all.

This dish was not bad. It had a lot of good ingrediants, but seemed to missing something. It just didn't have a whole lot of flavor.

OMG -this was awsome! I've never tried the "other" beer can chicken, but will definitely make this again. There are only 2 of us, so I made 1/2 chicken, and just halved the recipe for the marinade. I also minced a large garlic clove and added it to the beer/butter mixture (on top of the garlic powder) since I have a gas grill, and throwing garlic on the coals is not an option.

I think that this recipe is much better than the can in the chicken recipes I've tried simply because I think that the spices with the beer permeates the meat much better.  Besides, I like to fuss over my grill...  The only change I made was to add a bit of soy sauce to the mix because I'm on a soy sauce kick.  I only added a couple of shakes to it, so I don't think I hurt the recipe.  My son sprinkled dried hot pepper flakes on his chicken portion during the final 15 minutes or so. There wasn't  a piece left after dinner!  Thank you.

OH MY GOODNESS! Best grilled chicken ever! I added some crushed red pepper (abt 1-2 tsp), generously sprinkled paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder and a little extra butter into the beer before microwaving.  I also generously seasoned the chicken with season salt and garlic powder before marinating.  I didn't use seasoned pepper, as the directions called for.  I used boneless, skinnless chicken breast as well, and it is absolutly to die for! Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't have a BBQ so I put the whole chicken with the 1/2 the butter/beer mixture in my slow cooker. After about 6 hours I took off the lid and transferred it to the oven to crisp the skin.  IT WAS DELICIOUS.  Next time I may try another reviewers suggestion of a brown sugar/chilli mixture just to mix up the flavours a bit.

The garlic on the grill is an excellent idea, but the cook is stuck at the grill for the most of the cooking time.  Beer can chicken is as juicy and the skin is edible at the end of the cooking.    The photo does not match this recipe.  You have a photo of beer can chicken.

I used a whole chicken split lenghtwise as instructed. I followed the recipe as written until it came time to close all the vents. After 45 minutes on the grill bone side down, the meat only registered 153 degrees. I went ahead and flipped the chicken halves over, threw garlic powder on the coals, closed the vents and set the timer for 5 minutes. After 10 minutes the coals began to die and to lose heat and the chicken was not registering over 153 degrees - it had stopped cooking. I ended up opening the vents again to give oxygen to the coals. The chicken started cooking again and the dish registered 165 degrees by the time the marinade was used up. Very moist and delicious. I will make this again.

I have made a recipe similar to this for years. If you think this recipe is too bland try these changes: Mix a combo (to taste) of brown sugar, chili, garlic, & onion powder(s), salt and pepper, and rub on the chicken. I don't use butter or oil - I find it isn't needed.  For those who do not wish to use beer, replace it with chicken broth in a soda can!  (I add some chopped up onion and garlic to whichever liquid I put in the can.)  I always do more the one chicken, as leftovers are great and can be used for chicken salad, too.

I enjoyed making this.  Smelled wonderful while cooking.  One thing about it, the recipe says GENEROUSLY and that is exactly what it means.  Do not be afraid to put a lot on.  Mine was underseasoned and I put more on than normal.  Will over do it next time.

My husband said this was the best grilled chicken we have ever done. I rubbed the split fryer with a citrus chili before placing on the grill. We basted the chicken, both sides with the sauce. The skin was so golden and crisp, we decided not to turn it over on the grill, but instead made tiny slits in the  skin and spooned the sauce over it every 5 minutes for about 20 minutes. It was fall off the bone tender and juicy. Will definately put in my Favorites folder...thanks so much for the recipe!

I used chicken breasts and lemon pepper instead of seasoning salt (because that's all I had), and really loved it! The chicken was very moist. We will be using this again!

This was great and easy. The taste was very flavorful and most important it was cooked through and moist. My wife says I always under cook grilled chicken but this was done to perfection. I split a 7 lb oven-stuffer roaster.  Well save this one for future BBQ's

I still find it best to put the chicken on the beer can... and then there is no turning of the chicken needed..the chicken turns out with a crispy skin and a very tender and juicy meat.. YUM

The recipe I use - adds 1 cup mayonnaise to the rub with seasonings - and I guarantee you the best chicken ever on the grill! -

Garlic powder on the coals is a nice touch.  The picture however is of Beer Can Chicken and does not match the recipe. Setting the whole chicken on a can of beer and cooking on the grill will also give you great results.

I was not impressed with this recipe. I have made beer can chicken so times that this recipe fell flat. It lacked flavor and was not as moist as the original Beer can chicken.

Excellent, much better than chicken over beer cans.  Meat stayed moist and held flavors, would definately make this again and again.

Not crazy about this but it may have been my choice of beer - an amber.  The chicken was super moist though.

Used this as a marinade and just didn't have a whole lot of flavor, BUT I used a light beer, so I will make it once more with a dark beer to see if there is a difference.

marinade tasted great and basting it in the cut-up half bowl is a terrific idea.

Great recipe, but you have to watch for flareups with the drippings.  And I can't figure out why the picture shows chickens sitting on top of beer cans when the recipe calls for splitting a chicken in half and using a marinade of beer.

We liked this.  It was easy.  I absolutely love garlic but thought there was too much.   I think next time I will use the jarred minced garlic instead for the marinade type part and the powdered for the chicken seasoning.  I grilled this over the mesquite flavored briquets.

Wow! This is a great recipe! My boyfriend loves beer and meat and is a very picky eater. So I figured I would try this and he loved it, and so did I. We don't have a grill in our apartment so I used a cast iron grill (one that goes over the burners) and it had a great taste. I put the chicken in the marinade and left some on the side for basting when it was grilling for a bit more flavor. To kick it up a bit, try adding some Jerk Seasoning. It's a great recipie!

I agree the beer can up the whatsit works very well.  I mix dried tarragon with olive oil and finely grated garlic.  I put this under the breast skin and microwave the chicken for 10 mins then rub the outside with the tarrogon mixture put it on the can of beer and place in the weber.  About 45 mins should do it.

This was really good, but the butter/beer mixture didn't absorb into the chicken much. I just kinda threw some on after they were cooked too. But it was well received at my BBQ!

This was very moist and good.  I did it just slightly different - I split the chicken without separating it, placed a whole opened can of beer on the grill, and then placed the chicken on top of the can.

I used chicken legs and made the marinade on the stove top instead of the microwave.  I used half the marinade for my chicken and the other half on vegetable medley cooked on the grill

I went straight to the recipe review (which I usually do) for this one and read the two reviews complaining about the picture of the two whole chickens on the grill.  It appears to me that someone has apparently adapted the original recipe into their variation of a "Beer But Chicken" recipe.  No big deal - looks great to me! Thank you to the submitter for what sounds (and looks) like a great recipe!!

Adhered to the ingredients pretty tight, but cooked different: first smoked with hickory at 225F for an hour, then spit and transfered to the grill.  The garlic on the coals produces an awesome aroma!

Deceptive photo. This is NOT BEER CAN CHICKEN!  Made this today, and it was wonderful. WOULD do it again. THE char and the flavor of the garlic were wonderful. THE beer kept it moist throughout. No more tomato sauced bbq chicken for us!

I doubt we will be making this again.  The idea seemed great, but the beer flavor was overwhelming.  I did make chicken salad out of the rest since we didn't eat much and that turned out terrific!  :)
