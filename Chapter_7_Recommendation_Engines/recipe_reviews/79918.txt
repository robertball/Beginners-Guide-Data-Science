These stacks are wonderful! I had them with vegetarian ham-style slices and pineapple rings (along with the juice). All the great flavors of breakfast are packed into these, and they smell really terrific while cooking. Send more stacks!

I thought this was nice, I changed it a little however just because I was trying to have the fat content lowered a bit.  I made it as an open faced sandwhich w one piece of toast (I had no english muffins).  I forgot to saute a shallot, so I just fried a piece of ham, spinach on top and 1 egg over easy.  I topped it with a little hot sauce as well.  I know I changed it alot but I had to for my diet.  I really enjoyed that there was spinach on it to add fiber in the meal.  Thanks.

SO very good!  I thought the little pineapple caramelized drizzle was fantastic!  I only had deli thin sliced ham so I cut that in strips and fried it up as in the directions.  I added quite a bit more spinach since 5 leaves person is not much.  I thought the flavors in this were wonderful.  Just don't forget to salt and pepper your eggs and the spinach mix or it may be a little bland ;)

I thought this was okay. It didn't bedazzle my tastebuds, but I did give it another shot. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said, and it was pretty good, seemed like a little much for me in the morning, but a good amount to fill me up. I couldn't taste the sauce very much though. So, another day I tried just the ham, eggs, and sauce (no shallots or biscuit) and it was perfect for me. It was a little quicker to make and I could taste the sauce more. I'll probably make this again.

I'm OK with all the ingredients but the pineapple, but I can understand using the juice if everything seems dry. I used the recipe without it, letting the curry work its magic with the other ingredients. Wow! Unbelievably tasty with just the shallots and spinach on the eggs 'n' ham!

I am very happy with the results.  
This would be great for a special occasion, but way too much work for just an ordinary breakfast.

Really yummy - it is the curry sauce that makes this recipe.  We also topped with pineapple slices.

This sounds great, but I might use a second pan for the sauce simultaneously or else make the sauce before the ham and eggs.  Either way, it sounds like one or the other may need heating up in the microwave if they aren't done together.  I knew those little cans of pineapple juice would come in handy!

Hubby won't mix sweet and savory so made without the sauce.  Served over homemade French bread straight from the oven.  Very good!

Awesome! The sauce makes the dish. I fried my eggs, but I'd rather have them poached. I used extra spinach - tasted great and gave me a little extra nutrition. Instead of Black Forest Ham I bought Canadian Bacon. The size of the slice was perfect for an English muffin.

I thought the ingredients together were good but I found it a little bland and also there wasn't enough sauce. I should have used more salt and maybe a little butter in sauce.
