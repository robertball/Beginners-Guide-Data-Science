This pie is super easy to make and has now been added to my recipe library.  My family loved it!  In using a 9-inch pie pan, it did make a shallow pie, so next time I would double the raisins and the "sauce" mixture.  I added vanilla to the mixture just before pouring into the pie pan for additional depth of flavor.  I think that adding rum or butter extracts would also create wonderful taste variations. I sprinkled granulated sugar on top of the lattice crust for a crispy, sweet touch.  This pie goes together fast, it uses inexpensive ingredients most of us already have in our pantries, and the results are delicious!  This pie is perfect for experimentation like adding nuts, apples, pears, etc.  I recommend it to anyone that loves fruit pies.

Great raisin pie!  This recipe is exactly how my Grandma Kate use to make her pie and no one has ever matched it until this recipe.  I thought the recipe was lost forever.  If you love raisins, you'll love this recipe.  Thanks Jean & your Mother.  Peggy

The best we have ever tried.  My husband had three pieces and said it was the best I have made in 15 years!  Perfect recipe as is of course using the best ever pie crust recipe found on this site as well.

This pie was delicious.  I increased the filling to 1 1/2.  One recipe did not seem like enough for a 9 inch pie plate.

Very good recipe.  I found the amount of filing was perfect, as raisin pies are supposed to be thin and dense, not thick like berry pies.  I did have to tweek a little, I added another 2 tsp flour and a pinch of cinnamon, but I'm Italian, so our pinches are larger :), so about 1/8-1/4 tsp.  As if that wasn't good enough, I brushed the top crust with cream (milk) and sprinked vanilla sugar over it, I think I'm ready for the big leagues!

This was my first attempt at pie making and I chose this recipe. I made three in a row with various pastry tweaks and pie pans for quality check! (Plain old aluminum pan worked the best.)Definitely double the base mix, this is necessary. I also reduced the sugar in the last pie and it met my likes very well, I don't like over sweet. I also reduced the raisins by 1/4 cup or more. I also added a cap full of vanilla to the raisin and water pot, I much preferred this taste. I would also recommend to brush an egg wash on the pie before cooking, it looks much better. Be sure to get into the fine little cracks for an even browning. Also put a cookie sheet under pie to catch any messy droppings!  Thank you for posting this, as far as taste goes...you can't go wrong with this one. Go ahead and give it a try! Happy baking to you all!

I've made this several times and my husband loves it. I usually double the sauce though.

Too many raisins. I also doubled the sugar/flour mixture or the pie would have been very thin.

I've made this twice for my father in law who LOVES raisin pie. I multiply everything by 1 1/2 and used half golden raisins and half sunmaid california raisins. Added a good 2 tsp of vanilla just before pouring into the pie crust. I cheat and use Tender Flake pie crust and slice one pie crust up and do a lattice top. Looks so good (well it is part of his birthday gift!)  Tastes like a huge butter tart. YUM. Very easy recipe.

I was searching for a pie that was like one my grandmother used to make for the holidays and this is the closest I have found. I used the tip from other reviewers and doubled the filling portion. I am going to make again and use less raisins, as I like more filling and this pie is all raisin! Great recipe.

Great recipe here after the tweaks
I prefer a little more sour than sweet. 
if you make it and it doesn't seem to set as you'd like, next time add a little more starch.  not too much! 
the texture alone is amazing, the bite from the vinegar cutting through the sweetness 
absolutely delicious!
