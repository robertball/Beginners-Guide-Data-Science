This is my idea of the perfect comfort food. I love tater tots, and adding veggies and taco meat is genius. Surprised I didn't think of this myself. ;) I put diced red onions, green and black olives, diced tomatoes, banana pepper rings, jalapeño rings, shredded cheddar cheese, and taco meat on my tots. A good way to use the "rest of's" in the fridge.

I love doing this even though I changed it into a casserole. I used 2 large jars of Tostitos Nacho Cheese and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes and then mixed it all together, baked until bubbly at 350 and put sour cream on top of each serving. My family loves this. you can even double the recipe and portion and freeze leftovers and heat like a TV dinner when low on time. Family loves it!!!

Against my better judgement I went ahead and used Velveeta (nacho cheese sauce). Velveeta is something that we never use. Big mistake. I made them for the grandkids, they took one bite and would not eat anymore.  Not even the grandson that eats anything would eat them! A solution to this would be to use real cheese instead of cheese sauce.

These were pretty good.  I left out the water--didn't see a reason for it.  I forgot the onions, but I did add black olives.  Will probably make these again.  An Irish bar in Scottsdale has these on their appetizer menu.  They call them Irish Nachos.

Really a great tasting recipe!  I put my own small spin on it, and added a layer of homemade guacamole, and a layer of french fried onions and shredded tex mex cheese to the top. With a quick couple minutes under the broiler, we had a fantastic meal! Thanks for sharing it!
