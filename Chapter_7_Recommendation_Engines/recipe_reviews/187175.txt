This tasted really good, had a nice crunch and the chicken came very tender. I used all the listed ingredients, but half the cayenne because it was for the kids too. I used large breasts and cut them into 4 quarters. I ran out of crumbs after 3 breasts - used italian style breadcrumbs for the remaining chicken. Make MORE pretzel crumbs or use less chicken because the pretzel crumbs were MUCH better! Ran out of egg too - use 3 eggs or 3 large breasts, not 4.   I also put it in the oven at 400 for 20 min. on a foil lined baking sheet instead of frying - I'm just no good at frying on the stove top. :)

We thought this was a little bland. The second time I made it, I used only one egg and added 1 tablespoon each of dijon mustard and honey.  This made such a nice combination with the final dry coating.  Sweet, salty & savory all together. Yum!

I used one large chicken breast that I cut into chunks. After breading, I deep fried the nuggets for 4 minutes at 350 F. I originally chose this recipe because I had some very slightly stale pretzels to use up. It's definitely a keeper! I've already had to share it.

I used H.K. Anderson's pizza bites pretzles which I found really cheaply at Grocery Outlet. I just ground them up in my blender on the ice chip function. I also baked my chicken only to make it less greasy. I served this with Pasta with Chicken Mushroom Cream Sauce(minus the chicken)and garlic broccoli. We enjoyed this. It was really easy for me who happened to be short on time today. NOTE: You might want to drizzle a little butter over the top if you don't fry the chicken and add a little more spice. It might be a little bland and dry if you don't.

Easy to make, looks beautiful with its brown crust, takes very little time, and the meat eaters in my family really liked it. If you crush up the pretzels well, there is no problem with them sticking to the chicken. Next time I may change it up a bit and add a layer of mustard as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is EXCELLENT chicken and my whole family loves it!  What a great idea to use pretzels for a coating!  It makes quite a mess in the pan, but... totally worth it!  The chicken is flavorful and juicy.

First, I had TONS of leftover pretzel mix, which I think is weird since a lot of reviewers said it wasn't enough. I was able to do 6 breasts with the amount of flour, egg, and pretzel mix with more leftover. I followed another's suggestion and baked at 400 for 20 minutes, but would fry next time for more flavor.

This is a great recipe! I will try the variations, tho. Just be careful you don't brown the chicken too much - it's better to finish baking in oven if need be.

This was just your basic breaded chicken, but with pretzels. And grinding the pretzels just adds another step. I probably won't do this one again.

I thought this was excellent!  I love salt, so I added some, but we loved this! My chicken breasts weren't that thick, so I only fried 3 minutes on each side.  YUM!

I would give this 5 stars for flavor, but I had some technical difficulties, so I gave it 4.  I tried frying over medium heat as the recipe said, but it got really browned fast and almost burned, so I had to finish the cooking in the oven.  I cut back the cayenne to a 1/2 teaspoon and it was plenty spicy.

I baked the chicken and my biggest complaint is when it is reheated, it gets pretty soggy.  Fresh out of the oven, it is delicious!

I added more of some seasonings, plus some garlic powder and a little salt.  I used milk instead of egg as my middle "dip".  I also drizzled a small amount of butter over the top and baked it in the oven.  It was delicious.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 4 since I made some changes, but I will definitely make it again.

This was wonderful!  Made it last night for dinner and served it with a honey mustard saue.  Everyone loved it.  Followed the recipe exactly, using Honey Wheat Pretzels and had more than enough egg and pretzel crumbs for my chicken.

I thought this was very good.  Two of my kids really enjoyed this.  I cut them into strips and fried in my fryer.  YUMMY!!  Very good with honey mustard dipping sauce recipe on this site.  This weekend I'm making these into bites and serving them as an appetizer for a BBQ.  Will keep you updated.  I also want to try and bake these.  Update:  I tried these as chunks, super great as an appetizer, but alot more work!  I have to tell you, my kids request this quite often.  This is a quik meal, that is sure to please.  I serve with Mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli!!

I made these last night for the first time. Pretty good, but not as great as I hoped. I used the butter pretzels and chicken tender strips because they cook up a little faster. I just thought they were lacking flavor, after reading other's reviews maybe I'll double the spices next time.

The breading stayed on very well and the chicken was moist with a great crunch. I even dipped a few pieces in honey for that sweet-and-salty flavor. Will definitely make again!

Very tasty, but I did have some trouble getting the pretzel coating to stay on the chicken. Maybe I didn't get enough oil in the pan? Or crush them finely enough? I want to tweak around with how I made it last time and try it again, most likely I missed a step. Overall very yummy and can't wait to try it again

YUMMY! I made this and it was wonderful! I am going to try "buffalo wing flavored" pretzels next time for a football game. Very easy and tasty.

Great recipe, but next time I think I will use less Italian seasoning. I was hoping to taste more of the pretzel flavor, but the Italian seasoning (at least the one I used) kind of dominated the flavor. Otherwise, it was great!

OMG-I have made this multiple times & it's always great. Submitter is right, the butter pretzels are best, but it's still delicious w/the regular ones! And the leftovers are still crispy; this is one of my favorite chicken recipes!

It was surprisingly bland for all the paprika and cayenne pepper  in the recipe. But totally edible. I suppose if you tweaked the recipe to your own tastes, it would turn out better.

I liked the crunch with this chicken. Making the pretzel mix, I forgot the paprika and I don't use cayenne pepper (too spicy). The chicken was good anyway.

Thank you! Very good recipe. 
I made with chicken strips. I put all of the strips in a covered bowl with flour and gave it a good shake to get a) the pieces covered. In the egg mixture I added some agave syrup and yellow mustard (we like honey mustard dressing). Then rolled in pretzel mix. I baked them instead of frying. 400 degrees-20mins. Will definitely make these again.

I used pork chops instead of chicken, because that's the meat I had previously defrosted.  I also put the pork chops in the oven. This was a great dish the chops were also very moist.  Easy and quick recipe.  My teenager enjoyed it also.

I only used 1/2 the cayenne pepper & paprika and gluten free pretzels as well as gluten free all purpose flour. I baked at 400 for 18 mins as someone else previously mentioned. That was a little too long in my oven but still worked out. Everyone LOVED it! I think we have a new family favorite.

Easy! 

Hints: We Italians make breaded food. I sliced very thick breasts in half lengthwise (to get  2 whole breasts just thinner) and then pounded them after seasoning them for uniform size for uniform cooking.

Grandma taught me that. 

 We always  add a bit of milk to the eggs. After you bread it let it rest in the fridge for a while to set the breading. When I do breaded veal or pork or anything I sometimes bread the night before but usually in the morning before cooking. A good few hours is all you need. Added benefit, you do most of the clean up way before dinner.

Grandma taught me that. 

We use mixture of butter (for flavor) and olive oil (to lower the smoke point).

Grandma taught me that.

When we breaded anything we brown it in the oil/butter then finish it in the oven on a rack on a sheet pan covered with foil. The rack to prevent the bottom from getting soggy and to let the extra oil drip away, the sheet pan to catch the oil and foil so you won't have to clean baked on oil. 

Grandma taught me that, too.

On busy Christmas Eve we ALWAYS have breaded veal cutlets so I prep and bread the night before, fry it early in the day, then pop it in the oven after we get back from early Mass. It's never been less than wonderful.

Just like Grandma's.

Delicious.  We used the extra dark pretzels and it turned out great.  I only used half of the cayenne and paprika.  I'm a wuss when it comes to spicy foods and feared it might be too hot.  It was perfect.

Pretty easy to make, and it has a good kick to it. I ended up using some pretty low quality chicken breast that disappointed me every where else, but even that tasted great with this recipe. I look forward to making this with better ingredients next time!

My girlfriend and I made this, it was delicious--a good balance of crunch and spice.

My husband and I enjoyed the crust on this chicken.  Unfortunately it was a bit dry inside, but that's probably my fault and nothing to do with the recipe. I used honey mustard flavored pretzels, and I served it with the honey mustard recipe on this site. Enjoyed it... thanks!

I cut the chicken in strips. It was great!  Crunchy and flavorful.

I don't like cayenne pepper, so I left it out but found the chicken to be very bland. It definitely needs a kick of some sort. Mustard might help, or maybe even some salt. It wasn't very good left over either. So greasy! Too messy to make again.

This was OK.  I didn't notice a taste difference between using pretzels or bread crumbs.  I'll take the easier route of bread crumbs next time.
