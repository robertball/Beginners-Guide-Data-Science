AMAZING!!!!  These were SO delicious.  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe.  1) I used craisons instead of cranberries.  2) I used 1 C flour and 1 1/3 C whole wheat 3) I used 3 tsp cinnimon.  4)omitted coriander (don't know what that is).  5)Added 1/3 C sour cream.  6) I added 1 tsp Vanilla.  I baked it at 350 for 20 min.  They came out so moist and flavorful.  Seriously, the best muffin I've ever made or eaten.  Plus it is SO healthy, especially if you use whole wheat!

I was searching for a fall muffin recipe that wasn't too sweet and had some goodness to it. This recipe filled those requirements exactly. My family, including the teenagers, loved them. I used fresh chopped cranberries which gave these muffins little chunks of tang. These muffins could be served as a dessert or with a meal. I am serving these for a home school gathering tomorrow and I am sure they will be a hit. I think that your choice of apple type would make a difference in the recipe outcome. I used mild yellow and red delicious apples and used a hand grater for both apples and carrots, using the fine grate. Make sure not to overmix when adding the dry ingredients.I didn't use a mixer at all but did everything by hand. The hardest part was chopping the fresh cranberries.
Thanks Esther for sharing this wonderful recipe. I am sure it will become an Autumn staple in our home!!

These were really good, even though I did a few substitutions. I omitted the nuts and  used dried cranberries instead of fresh/frozen. I also added extra cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger and 1 tsp allspice. Next time I think I'll add extra carrots. However, watch the timing - the recipe says 25 - 30 minutes but after 25 minutes  I had a few burnt muffins (luckily not the whole batch). I'd check next time after 20 minutes.

I really really liked these muffins! I used diced apples (not shredded) straight from a North Carolina orchard, 1/3 cup less sugar than called for and dried cranberries instead of fresh. I also didn't have any coriander so I left that out. These are so great and pretty healthy too! Don't bake them as long as the recipe says or they will be very dry!! I cooked for twenty minutes at 375. I might bake at 350 next time instead of 375 to see how well they turn out since that's the more standard temp for baking. Give these a try!!

These muffins are not only healthy but  very yummy. I have made them a lot. My husband really likes them as well. The only thing I do different is I put in the cranberries whole. It saves time and you get that yummy cranberry flavor. Thankyou Esther for submitting this recipe.

I just made these muffins and followed some suggestions of people who previously made these.  I used a 1/4 c extra carrot, dried cranberries instead of fresh, 1 tsp extra cinnamon, and 1 tsp added to the apple while i let it marrinate in sugar for the 10mins.  I also added a tsp of vanilla.  I cooked these muffins for 20mins and they turned out perfect.  Anyways, I found them very bland tasting. Next time I will use a pinch of nutmeg, half brown sugar and half white sugar and maybe even some all spice.. This is a great base for a muffin but needs more flavor! Thanks for the recipe.

These were a hit!  I don't usually use the paper liners & they turned out fine with just some pam sprayed on the pan.

I love this recipe!  These muffins are so moist and the spice is just right in my opinion.  I used Sunflower seeds for the nuts and it was perfect!

these were very good, but the coriander was a bit too much.  next time i think i'll either cut in down to 1 tsp or omit it all together.  thanks for the recipe!  they didn't stay on my counter long!

Scrumptious!  I substituted oat flour (oats in a blender) for half the flour and 1/2c yogurt for half the oil.  My kids gobbled these up!

Fantastic!!!  I used Craisins instead of fresh cranberries and they turned out a bit sweet (my daughter loved them!), so next time I will try the regular cranberries.  To make the recipe gluten-free, I substituted rice flour for the wheat flour.  I also used applesauce instead of the oil to cut fat.  Don't leave out the coriander-- in my opinion, it's what makes this recipe so amazing.

HEALTHIER VERSION: For the flour I used: 1 cup whole wear flour, 1 cup white flour and 2 packets of plain instant oatmeal.  For the sugar I used: 2/3 cup splenda no calorie sweetener and 2/3 cup brown sugar.  I replaced the oil with 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I didn't have coriander so I used 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cloves.  (I also didn't have cranberries so I used a 1/2 cup raisins (soaked in hot water for 10 mins to plump) and 1/2 cup chopped dates.  Baked at 350 for 20 mins and they are PERFECT!  YUMMY!  The right amount of sweet.

I made this without the eggs, by substituting 1/4 cup of wheat germ and a half cup water. I also only had one cup of chopped apples, so I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup and the flour to 2 cups only. I used half a cup of sliced almonds and kept the rest of the recipe as is and they turned out moist and delicious. Also, I forgot to add the spices and it didn't matter. Still very tasty!

Just made these and I was disappointed and surprised at how bland they were. Next time I will add some orange juice and rind and a little more cinnamon.

These had a great flavor, but I'm giving them 4 stars because I changed a number things... Mainly, I made them gluten-free (use 2.5 C GF baking flour, and 1.5tsp Xanthan Gum), also, I used 1/2C applesauce instead of oil, I used dried cranberries since that's what I had, and I cut the sugar to 1C (they were still pretty sweet, so I will use even less next time- the dried cranberries and applesauce add to the sweetness). These turned out great! Served them with Harvest Sweet Potato Soup from this site, and it was a healthy, fulfilling meal! Even with making them gluten-free, they had a nice consistency, and weren't too heavy (which is often a frustration with GF baking!). I will definitely make these again!

Super yummy, I too added spices I had on hand, but also added some chopped dates & spinach, flax, whole wheat and wheat germ- They still came out perfect! My kids loved them and I love we are eating something healthy.

I love them.   Yes cut the bake time to 20 min.   I substituted about 1/3 c brown sugar for white.   I also substituted about 1/3 of whole wheat flour for the white flour.   My daughter will take them for 2nd grade snack tomorrow.   We'll see how they go over with so many picky eaters.   Also left out the coriander - but will try next time.

Did the recipe just as stated, except did half whole wheat flour.  So I put 4 out of 5 stars for that.  They were wonderful and the kids gobbled them up.  :)

Yummy! Used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour- used 1/2 shredded apple and 1/2 apple sauce- craisins- omitted the carrot- used brown sugar- and added about a 1/3 cup Greek yogurt and some flax meal to boost the nutrition value- there's lots of room to play with this recipe!

These were delicious, got so many compliments for them! Based on other suggestions, I added another teaspoon of cinnamon to the apples and sugar, diced my apples, added 1/8 teaspoon cloves, and used half brown sugar. I also used a combination of pomegranate seeds and dried cranberries because I didn't have fresh cranberries - so good!!!

I don't know what happened!  My muffins never rose!  I checked the date on my baking powder and my baking soda and all seems to be fine.  They taste great... but they're really dense since they didn't rise.

Very good muffins!  My whole family loved them and so did my co-workers!  I did add maybe a 1/4 of ground almonds, 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and maybe 1/3 cup of grated zucchini as well.  They are so healthy and delicious!

These are great!  I made these primarily for children, so I made some changes based on the recommendations of other reviews and some twists of my own: I used whole wheat flour, and I substituted 1/2 c flour for 1/2 c instant oats.  I may try upping the amount of oats I use for some added texture (I had to omit the nuts because of food allergies with the kids).   I chopped the apples and I used 1 c sugar, and 1/3 c honey.   I used dried cranberries.   I substituted the coriander for 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp ginger, and added almost a full tsp extra of cinnamon.   I also upped the salt to 1 tsp on the second batch, which brought out the flavors more, in my opinion.   Cut the baking time to 18 min, which was perfect. I know there are a lot of tweaks, but this recipe is really easy to play with!  The original recipe is wonderful, I would just up the salt a tad. It's amazing what the extra bit of salt did.

These are very very good. A definat keeper. I am already going to make another batch cause the first one is almost gone. Not to sweet and a nice tang. I did add a 1/4 cup of milk to moisten it up a bit. For a richer taste I would add cream. I will make these again and again. Thank you for posting!

A great healthy muffin. I used olive oil and in the future will try with part whole wheat flower.  They were delicious and moist and disappeared quickly.

I baked these for 22 minutes and they came out great.  Smelled lovely cooking and tasted delicious!  I had to make three modifications (to go with what I had available in the kitchen): 1/2 cups of sunflower seeds instead of chopped nuts, safflower oil instead of vegetable oil and I ran out of coriander, so no coriander!  Next time I think I will do the same but add the extra spice as directed as I think it would taste just as good or even better.  Of note: the recipe says it makes approximately 18 muffins, but I found myself with excess batter after filling all 18 cups more than 2/3 full.  I only have enough tins available to make 18, so I'm not sure, but it's possible I could have made 24 smaller muffins.

I've been looking for some recipes with veggies in them since my toddler is not a fan of the textures of vegetables.  Her and I made them today (what a mess- flour everywhere but such fun) and they were a huge hit.  I also chopped the apples because I like to bite into them.  And I used white whole wheat flour.  I was afraid this would make them dry; it was a little bit dry but they were still fantastic and it makes them even more wholesome.  Only thing I would do different is to bake them a little less- it would help with the dryness.

Fabulous recipe.  The first time I made it I substituted applesauce for the shredded apples and baked it into loaves by reducing the heat to 350 for 50 mins or so.  Turned out great!

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  With all the ingredients that were included it sounded awesome, but they turned out a little bland.  The first batch was slightly over-done even though I didn't cook them for the entire suggested time.  I definitely would suggest dropping the cooking time by 5 minutes and possibly adding some orange zest for flavor.

Great muffins! I didn't have any chopped nuts, so I substituted a cup of white chocolate chip & macadamia nut mix that I had left over from some cookies. I also didn't have any coriander, so I used 1 teaspoon of nutmeg instead. Even with the substitutions...they turned out great! I also found (like some previous reviews had mentioned) that after 25 minutes the muffins were done. I would cook them for only about 20-25 minutes next time.

Delish and easy to make!  I used diced apples, omited the oil and used applesauce instead, whole wheat flour instead of white, and shortened the cooking time to just under 20 min, and they turned out perfectly!  Yummers!

I used the same recipe as "Melissa" below and my muffins turned out awesome!  The only change I made was I used homemade applesauce instead of oil, and I used fresh ground coriander, which goes soo well with the cranberries it's unbelievable.  I definitely reccomend trying coriander if you've never tried it before.  Smells and tastes sooooo yummy!

Very good but a lot of chopping and shredding involved.  I omitted the nuts and added extra cinnamon and nutmeg.   A good, hearty muffin.

Oh man...I think I found the perfect snack for my Nutrition class. These are so moist. I used as much natural ingredients as possible, because I had to...but none-the-less, it turned out awesome. I also used Hodgson Mill whole wheat white flour, apple sauce for the oil, and added orange zest, and pumpkin pie spice. My Sister-in-laws' kitchen smells like thanksgiving.

Wow. People aren't kidding when they call these moist. Sooo good!  I had a bag of cranberries about to go south and way too many apples sitting  around, so this recipe was exactly what I needed. The only changes I made were to split the all-purpose flour with  whole wheat  flour and drop the cooking temp/time to 350 for 20 minutes (actually, about 23 minutes). Prep was longer than 20 minutes with all the shredding (did it  by hand), but otherwise a fairly easy recipe. My batch came out to 23 muffins, but I think I added a little bit extra on the carrots and apples.

Love it! I had to change a few things because of what I had on hand, but followed the basic recipe and it turned out delicious! I didn't have enough apple, so used a bit of pear too, added about 3/4 c. frozen blueberries, and used 3/4 c. craisins instead of cranberries (didn't have cranberries at home). Then instead of using nuts (my daughter and I are allergic), I used 1 c. unsweetened shredded coconut. Yum!! Definately a keeper!

These take a little more prep than regular muffins but they are worth it!  Try making them with whole wheat flour- better for you and taste just as good!

I think these are fantastic.  I used frozen cranberries.  I didn't have any carrots and was scared that would affect the moisture.  I added raisins instead of the carrots and a splash of soy milk when mixing them up.  I also used 1/2 ww flour. They turned out great.  I was nervous because the reviews were saying they were dry, but they weren't.  And they have plenty of flavor for me, I really like them.

I made these muffins for breakfast Christmas morning.  I chopped all the fruits and veggies the day before and had them ready to add to the batter in the morning.  When my 3 kids (all college students) got up they were fresh from the oven and delicious.

Made these muffins for some friends who were coming to visit and they were a huge hit!  I omitted the coriander and coarsely chopped pecans were my nut of choice.  Definitely reduce the cooking time, 20 minutes produced perfectly browned and moist muffins.  I didn't have any paper liners so just lightly greased the tins and the muffins came right out, no problems.  This will become a regular in our house!

Made these the morning after T-Giving.  It was a good way to use up T-Giving groceries & wasn't overly sweet.  My changes:  Didn't have coriander so used 1-1/2 tsp allspice.  Added 1/2 Tblsp lemon zest.  Left out nuts for my picky husband.  Both moms asked for the recipe.

Lovely colours make these look like the perfect muffin for Christmas morning.  Used some sad looking apples that had been marked down and dried cranberries instead.  Yummy.

The muffin dough was very dry for me, but they still turned out well in the end - very tasty.
