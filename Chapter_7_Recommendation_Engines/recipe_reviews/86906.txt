So its 30 minutes until dinner and I have a head of cauliflower that needs to be eaten or it will go bad...what do I do? I get on Allrecipes.com and find this little recipe. It sounds interesting yet odd...I try it and its a hit! My family really liked it! My kids are more brocolli fans, but loved the cheesy-ness of this dish. My husband doesn't like tomaotes but asked for seconds! One tip: make sure you drain all the water out of your dish before you add the butter, tomatoes and cheese. By the way you really only need a tablespoon or so of butter. All in all I was quite impressed with this odd collection of ingredients.

I knew going in that this sounded like an interesting recipe, but would be too bland for me and my husband - so before I cooked the cauliflower in the microwave I sprayed it with "I can't believe its not butter" spray (no carbs, no calories, no fat!) and sprinkled the cauliflower and tomatoes with dry Italian dressing mix(my favorite spice!) and crushed red pepper.  Then did the rest as the recipe said except I used Smart Balance spread instead of butter (we have health issues) Also I did not have shredded swiss so I used torn up pieces of some deli baby swiss I had.  Even though I used a full head of cauliflower and it was just my husband and I (and we are not big eaters!) there were no leftover.  Delicious

I love cauliflower and made this last night.  I made a few little changes.  Olive oil instead of butter, red pepper flakes to give it a kick, and I didn't cook it nearly as long.  But it was great.

I added some crackers to the butter and sprinkled on top.  Put tomatoes around the edge but next time would put all over the top.  I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss.  Also put a generous sprinkle of garlic plus over the cauliflower before butter was put on.

This was a quick recipe that used up the cauliflower in my fridge.  I didn't need to bake it as long as the recipe lists and it was very oily at the bottom of the dish.  If I made this again, I would use more tomatoes and less butter.

I liked it, but I added some chopped bacon and 1 chopped leek. I also steamed the cauliflower in the microwave first and drained it well before placing in casserole dish

Very good and tasty.  I was a bit skeptical on the combination but it was a crowd pleaser.  I might add a little more cheese and salt but it will be added to my regulars.

Very good and easy but very fattening. I have tried it using low fat swiss and half the amount of butter. It is still very good.

Good dish!  I skinned the tomatoes making them softer to eat.  Next time I will use less butter and cheese.

This is absolutely delicious! I added some garlic powder, onion powder and oregano, and with those small changes, I'd say it deserved more than 5 stars. I just know it's going to get made often. DH had seconds, and requested I make more of it just 2 or 3 days after polishing off the first batch. Thanks for sharing!

Good new side dish!  We've always liked cauliflower, but the combination of the tomatoes & the cheese with it is really something else!  I used 1/4 of the amount of butter called for & it was plenty.  I sprinkled garlic powder over the cauliflower, then sprinkled italian seasoning over the top before baking & it added really good flavor!  We enjoyed this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

GREAT RECIPE!  Easy to make and delicious.  Passed this onto my sister, and she loved it, too.  I love cheese, so I added more.  Is good reheated - IF there's any left!

This was good. I have some leftover vodka sauce so tossed the cauliflower in that. I used mozarella cheese and sprinkled italian seasonings on top. I ate this for lunch but would certainly serve with any pasta dish.

Really tasty and simple, and so easy to adapt to use up leftover vegies. I used only a small amount of butter, and sprinkled breadcrumbs over the food before adding the cheese - YUM!

I liked this.  I made a few minor adjustments.  I added oregano, garlic and onion powder.  Also I only had cherry tomatoes so I cut them in half and spread them through out the dish.  Close to a pizza taste.  Cheesy goodness.

I substituted colby and monterey jack cheese as my family does not eat swiss or cheddar cheeses.  I didn't add any salt as we are trying to stay away from salt.  My family thought it was ok as a side dish but they wouldnt eat it as a main meal.

Taste pretty good but I do think cheddar or any other cheese would have been better.  I liked the tomatoes a lot.  Good tasting dish!

Well, i have mixed feelings on this! It has a nice taste, yes, but it is SO FATTENING and it was not eatten up... Only a small section went for dinner - and it was mostly my eatting of it. The next day after being in the fridge i could see all of the fat solidified, a bit disconcerting when it's a veggie side dish. I won't make it again, but will try a baked cauliflower dish with alot less fat. BTW - it needed TONS of salt to eat it - just keep that in mind if you are watching your sodium!

Pretty good, but the swiss cheese was a little overpowering to me.  But my husband, who normally doesn't like swiss cheese, LOVED it!  Next time I am going to use a mixture of swiss & cheddar and see how that comes out!

Pretty good....I think I really liked the tomatoes on this...I also added some dried thyme for more flavor, used mozzarella cheese since I had no swiss....and used just a few tblspns of butter rather then a whole stick. Will try with the swiss next time....something different for cauliflower. Thanks!

I added some garlic powder, Seasoned salt, and Italian seasoning. It was good but next time I think I will scale back the butter a little and use a different cheese. It was very good though! 1 out of 3 of my children liked it and my husband and I did as well.

Loved this recipe...although I made some changes.  I drizzled 2 tbsps olive oil rather than butter and added shredded cheddar to the swiss. I also added garlic powder omitting salt and pepper. I only had one tomato at home...next time I'll be sure to use two.  I baked until the cauliflower was slightly browned.  It turned out terrific!

The recipe as written was very good, and I didn't make any changes.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is drain the dish before serving.  Although I drained the cauliflower after cooking, there was still a lot of water on the plates when I served it.  Very good though.

I made this one for my family and they loved it.  It has quickly become one of the most popular veggie dishes.  It's very simple to prepare, just make sure you allow enough oven time.

Pretty good! I used grape tomatoes and halved them since I didn't have big ones to slice up. We'll probably make it again...

We loved this! I took others' advice here and added some cracked red pepper and Italian seasoning. Next time I want to try cutting the butter with olive oil spray. I used a bag of frozen cauliflower, no micro, no defrost. Husband is raving about it so this goes on my definitely again list. Thanks for sharing!!!!

This was pretty good. I used broccoli and monterey jack cheese, and seasoned it with garlic powder, oregano, and basil.

I thought this came out great! I microwaved the cauliflower and then drained it. As some other reviewers suggested, I sprinkled the cauliflower with a bit of garlic powder and used the only cheese mix I had in the fridge -- colby jack, cheddar and cream cheese. I put very little butter on it and it still came out great!

It was a simple dish that was a hit in our home.  I prepared it earlier in the day, and just popped it in the oven with my chicken at the same time.

I really enjoy this recipe, having made it  a dozen times!  I thought I would play around with it and make it a more hearty side dish. I ended up adding broccoli.  I steamed the broccoli with the cauliflower for 10 minutes, drained and then put in a medium sized ramekin.  I cut the tomaotes into bite sized chunks.  I added some nutmeg, drizzled with the melted butter, then also added some shredded gruyere and swiss cheeses.  I topped it off with a melted butter and dry bread crumb crust and baked it for 40 minutes. Definitely very filling and yummy!

Wonderful way to fix cauliflower for low carb diets. Be sure to drain cauliflower well after microwaving. I added the italian seasoning for extra flavor. It was an asset. This will be one of my favorite ways for cauliflower.

This wasn't bad - I would probably jazz it up a bit next time with fresh basil leaves, onions and garlic. Good starter recipe though and a great way to use up cauliflower.

Awesome recipe! I cooked the cauliflower in the microwave and dried it on paper towels. Also blotted the tomatoes prior to layering and it was perfect; not wet at all like the first time around! I used sliced Havarti cheese all over the top to still get the nutty "bite" of the Swiss but with the creamy, easy meltability and it bubbles up beautifully. The shredded cheese didn't coat the cauliflower well in my opinion. I omitted the butter all together and it came out perfect. Sprinkled with bread crumbs as well. I love this recipe! Thank you.

I just got done eating this dish. My girl loved it. I did make some changes to go with what I had in the pantry. I used provolone, American. mozzarella cheeses. with a sprinkle of Parmesan on top. Some Italian seasoning spice on top of the cheese. She is on a low carb diet and said this would or could replace macaroni and cheese. I also liked it. There was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the pan. I believe it was from the tomatoes, and butter. I just used a spoon with holes to drain each portion.

Very tasty!  I recommend cooking for a much shorter time...15 minutes in the oven at 375 is plenty if you like your veggies a bit on the firm side.  I would think 30 min would make them mushy.  Like others have suggested, I cut the amount of butter in half.  I also sprinkled the top with seasoned bread crumbs.  Yum!

This recipe did come out...though a bit liquidy even after I drained the water.It tasted good...not great just good. I added cumin and curry before I put the cheese on.It turned out less flavorful than I hope it would.If I have cauliflower,tomatoes,and swiss cheese that were gonna go bad if I didn't use them I might make this again...only if I couldn't find any other recipe.

My family didn't like this much at all.  The flavor (what there was) was ok.  It needed something, as it was very bland. Maybe a little cooking sherry or vermouth?  Something to give it a little zing.  And I hate when cheese coagulates, which this did the second you took it out of the oven.  It might be better with Velveeta that way. I had a head of cauilflower I had to use, and so I tried this recipe, don't think I will make it again though. :o/

Pretty tasty and something different for cauliflower. I cut the recipe to 4 servings but used only one tablespoon of butter and prob 1/4 cup of Italian cheese mix because that's what I had. I did season the mix with some Greek Seasoning and a bit of red peppers to compliment dinner and give it a pop! I didn't microwave it, just 20 minutes in the oven, then topped with the cheese and thick sliced tomato for another 20 minutes. The cauliflower had a crunch and the tomatoes were soft, so nice combination. Thank you for sharing, Laura. I'm sure I'll make this again.  **made this with a Vegan cheddar mix and we liked it much better.

I took everyone’s advice and added more cheese, kept all the rest of the ingredients and in of a few more of my own. I sautéed some portobello mushrooms so they were extra soft, and made a Bechemel sauce, poured it into the cauliflower, baked for 20 minutes at 350°, then threw some shredded cheese and the tomatoes on for five more minutes. Oh my goodness what a hit!

This was delicious and pretty! I used S&P on the tomatoes and orange cauliflower, cut little dots of butter across the top, then a sprinkling of grated sharp cheddar,  a bit of parmesan for bite and finished with a drizzle of olive oil. Great flavor, no pool of fat on the bottom, just delicious juices. I knew it would taste good but wasn't prepared for how truly delicious it was. Thank you very much for your recipe! (I should add that I nestled the plum tomato slices within the cauliflower rather than across the top of them.)

Boyfriend says "I like it!". I steamed the cauliflower to al dente, tossed it in store-bought horseradish-dijon condiment, topped with sliced tomatoes and slices of swiss cheese, and baked.

I followed the suggestions of others and made two changes: 1) olive oil instead of butter, and 2) cheddar cheese instead of swiss cheese.  My family thought it was very good and tasty, and I really liked how simple it was to make.  I agree that 1/2 cup of butter would have been too much, but I will try Swiss cheese for a lighter flavor next time.

All I can say is....my hubby now loves cauliflower!!  Thanks for this incredibly easy and delicious recipe!  It's even better if you add a few breadcrumbs to give it a bit of a crispy texture.

This was wonderful! I had company who had never seen purple cauliflower so I bought some and wanted a fun way to cook it. Beautiful with the tomatoes and everyone loved it, kids too!

This is really tasty!!! Allows a little extra time for dinner prep, too. MW for 3 minutes with just a little water. Add the cheese, then tomatoes, then more cheese. Put it the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes.  If you need more time, just turn the oven off and let it sit.  This is really awesome, especially when you sprinkle some garlic sea salt on it!!!
It was gone before I could get pics!!!

Love it!  Great alternative, and I don't have to make white sauce.  A sprinkling of garlic salt on top works a treat.

Excellent! Almost like mac and cheese without the carbs since I made it with cheddar cheese instead of Swiss. I made 2 changes: I cut the butter in half which reduced fat calories but still gave a nice buttery flavor; and I added a few crushed buttery crackers tossed with a little olive oil on top for a bit of crunch. My husband even said it was really good.

I thought this was a very yummy and unique cauliflower recipe. I used gouda instead of swiss because I dont like swiss, but seriously yummy and easy.

Mine came out great! I did one little tweek for more flavor, and make it a tad creamier. After I cooked the cauliflower I tossed a good size dollop of Philadelphia Cooking Creme Italian Herb, just enough to barely coat. Then pretty much followed the recipe as is, besides the cheese on top, I used a cheddar/monterey mix and I only used half the melted butter. Really good.

This was pretty good, but I made some alterations.  I used 1/3 cup swiss cheese and no regular butter.  I used the spray (calorie free) butter all over the tomatoes and cauliflower.  I also cut up fresh garlic to give it some kick.  I added Italian seasoning as well.  Pretty tasty and light for a side dish, but without alternations this would've been way too bland.

This is a great recipe!  I added it to my Thanksgiving buffet for something a little different that wasn't a starch!  When I made it to test it out it was great.  I only added 2 Tbsp of butter though and it was great - I can't imagine adding a STICK of butter!!  It was easy and yummy.  I couldn't stop taking a hunk of cauliflower as it was sitting on top of the stove!

I changed the recipe quite a bit but I was inspired by it! I used pasta sauce in a jar instead of the tomatoes and I added Italian bread crumbs on top of the cauliflower and sauce and then put cheese on top.  I did not use butter.  It was delicious! Like pasta exactly but without the extra calories.  I could have made it even leaner with less cheese.  It was excellent.

This recipe rates 5 starts ~ even better ~ AWESOME!!!!  I used 1/2 the butter, as other reviewers suggested.  An excellent dish ~ when you get a bite with some tomato you feel like you've hit the jackpot.

This was really delicious.  I only had grated romano and a little mozzerella on hand so I used a combination of both in place of the swiss. The bechamel sauce came together without any trouble.  My husband and I both loved it.
