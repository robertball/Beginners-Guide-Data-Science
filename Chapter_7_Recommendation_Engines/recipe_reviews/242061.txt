I don't rate things in general, but this was so good I had to. I followed the recipe except that I didn't have red port wine so I used dry white. It was by far the best pork roast I have ever made. I have tried a lot of recipes too. The flavor was very well rounded and full bodied.  You should try this one.  I will be making it again soon! By the way, don't change anything!

This is by far my favorite red wine pork recipe! Wouldn't change a thing! It's so tender-melts in the mouth and asked for often, kind of dish! 
Once I didn't have the bay leaves or chicken seasoning cubes, added other stuff and it was still Amazing! 
Thanks for sharing!

This is an easy and flavorful recipe, but the meat was pretty dry.  I use a smaller-size slow cooker, so that might have been the problem.   Next time I will use the low setting exclusively or shorten the cooking time.  Since I used a Cabernet instead of port I left out the sugar - which I did not miss.  I would like to try the port, which would add a stronger flavor.  If I skip the port again I will  add 1/2t  red pepper flakes and increase the amount of onion to compensate.  I also think sliced mushrooms would be a good addition either way.

MAKE SURE YOU USE A LARGE CROCKPOT!  I am traditionally just cooking for my husband and myself so I have always used a medium 4qt crock pot.  After beginning the assembly of the dish I realized that the amount of liquid required in this recipe was way too much to fit in our crock pot. I ended up draining the onions, garlic and vegetables from the liquid, mixing it with the wine and then re-adding the vegetables.  I then poured only the amount of liquid that would fit in my crock pot, about 1/2 of what was called for in the recipe.  It was still tasty and tender.

I made this exactly as the recipe indicated. It was delicious.  I cooked a 4 lb roast for 8 hours on low.  It fell apart and was very tender and delicious.  Their was so much broth, I served it on the side like a cup of soup.  My husband loved it.

Made this with some changes: honey instead of sugar, added a number of other spices added(paprika, oregano, basil, chives, coriander, tumeric, cumin, onion, beef bouillon in addition to chicken and a small amount of cayenne pepper as well), powdered garlic instead of cloves(mine had gone bad), Australian shiraz instead of port, regular carrots, and a sweet potato. I also added a pint of water instead of a quart by accident. So there was a fair bit of liquid so I put the vegetables below on the bottom submerged and a pork loin roast on top. The loin was still somewhat immersed in the liquid but mostly above. I also aggressively singed the roast for a good 10 minutes to lock in the juices and to maintain the structure as much as possible during slow cooking. The 6 hours on high was enough to cook it and break down the fat and connective tissues, it was not necessary to continue cooking on low and I think it would be destructive to the dish if this were to be done but perhaps this is dependent on how powerful a given slow cooker is and how long one singes the roast. The pork does come out a little dry but I used the jus to make gravy by adding some flour(in the future I will add less water as I had to boil a lot off). The results were excellent. I will keep this recipe in my back pocket, it is a good base on which to experiment on in the future for me.

This was a TERRIFIC RECIPE for a bone in Pork Loin Roast.
I had a 3 1/2 lb roast, I used the specified amount of water and substituted 2pkgs. of Pork Gravy mix for 2 of the Chicken Bouillon cubes. I added no salt, figuring the Bouillon had plenty of salt already. I also did not add sugar.
I doubled the Red Wine....
Wow, was this terrific...! So yummy.
I also added some Corn Statch mixed in cold water to the Slow Cooker the last 40 minutes.
I started this bf work, it cooked 9 hours on low, it was fall-apart delicious and enough for two hungry men to have 2 good sized meals each 2 nights in a row....
I will use this recipe over and over, oh yes, I also added some fresh Thyme I had on hand.
Thank you for submitting this... wow.

This was really delicious! Even my 2 year old twins loved it. I only cooked it for 4 hours on high in the slow cooker and it was perfect. I would also add at least twice as many carrot. I will definitely make again.

Four and a half stars would be just right for us.
It's interesting, quick, easy and quite tasty.  Just a few comments though:

1)  Thought the skillet may not be enough so used the Le Crueset pot I've had for decades which worked quite well.
2)  Was there an omission in not using an oil, butter or spray in the pan prior to browning the onion and garlic?  I always add something first;  today it was extra virgin olive oil.
2) Used 1 cup of chopped onions which we liked. 
3) Used a boneless 3 lb. pork loin roast which was perfect, although it did not brown as much as I had hoped.  Turned out great though no matter.
4) Used 1 cup baby carrots but would definitely use more next time.  Also no Idaho potato on hand so used red ones; definitely will increase the amount of both next time.  
5) Think the addition of mushrooms would be great but didn't have any so added two stalks of chopped celery.
6) No raw sugar available so used regular granulated, cut back to 1 tbsp.  Didn't miss the extra at all.
7) Port wine is not something usually kept  here but there it was.  Decided to use 1 cup of port and 1/2 cup of merlot, which was already opened.  Very good flavor.
8)  Not sure about others' crock pots but mine did a perfectly fine job cooking this exactly four hours on high.  No more time was necessary.   More could certainly have toughened the meat and/or dried it out.  
9)  All in all, it was a very tasty, juicy, flavorful meal we thoroughly enjoyed served with a mixed salad, bread an

Excellent!  I only made a couple small changes, I used a little less salt and only used 1 cup of wine, just because that was all I had.  I will make it over and over again in my future.

I put this together this morning. I had all of the ingredients except for the Port wine. I had to use cooking wine instead. Except for that one small change everything stayed the same. The meat came out moist and tender and the flavors were all so complimentary. I'm going to have to try it again next time with Port wine, just to see if this could possibly get any better, (no kidding, it's THAT good!) Thanks so much for sharing this easy and delicious recipe.

I followed to the letter, cooked almost 4 hours & my roast registers over 200 degrees F internally!  Smells delicious. I did not cook any potatoes or carrots with it so perhaps that’s why it cooked so fast?  I tasted it and it’s pretty dry.

This is 100% a keeper! Aside from using Apothic Red, red blend instead of port and adding baby bella mushrooms, I stuck to the recipe and cook time. You definitely need a large crock pot, there’s a lot of liquid. After cooking I made a roux, added the liquid and reduced to a gravy. There are hardly any leftovers, and my kids have requested it “all the time”.
