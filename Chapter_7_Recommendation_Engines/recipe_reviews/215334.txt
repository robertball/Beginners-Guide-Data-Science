I thought this was so-so.
I used Braeburn apples and followed the instructions precisely.
I thought it could have been cooked longer, and that the apples were a bit too tart. Would have liked a thicker topping, and, sweeter filling. Might try again, using a sweeter apple and slicing VERY THIN.

Fixed this for Easter dessert.  Everyone thought it was good, but no raves.  I thought it was kind of sweet.  Probably will not fix it again, only because we prefer a crunchy topping on this type of dessert. It served its' purpose, so that's what matters. Glad that we tried it.
