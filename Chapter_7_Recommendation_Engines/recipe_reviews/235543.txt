Have made these three times and will make again today since they serve a few special purposes in our house; son uses them for grab and go energy before a workout; treat for my friend who's gluten-dairy sensitive when everyone else gets brownies for dessert; actually hide my mom's one medication in a room temperature ball since she won't swallow her pill.

I used more flax seed meal in place of some of the oats. I also used raw sunflower seeds instead of pecans. I call these squirrel cookies they are delicious, I eat them for a power burst at breakfast!

These are an excellent snack. They really taste great. I had to substitute mint choc chips and I added some unsweetened coconut. Would make these again for sure!

These are the best. So easy to make and pleased even my picky eater. I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I chopped up 2/3 cup in the food processor and it turned out great. Thanks for sharing, this recipe is a keeper!
