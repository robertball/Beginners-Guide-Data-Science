This recipe is especially great with dried mangoes from the Philippines! For people watching their weight, they can cut down on the butter and sugar by around 3/4 to 1/2 of the stated amount in the recipe.

Two Christmases ago my boss' daughter made these and I began to search recipes for it, alas, I found this and made a batch last night. My husband stuffed himself with several squares and saved some to take to work to boast with his co-workers!  He's asking me to make some more! This is best recipe to make in the Philippines where we have tons of inexpensive dried mangoes there, and I like the way it doesn't give away the taste of mango, instead it tastes like a combination of different fruits and is chewy and addictive!

Couldn't find a dessert recipe using fresh mangos.  I had two mangos that were starting to get overripe so I took a chance and used them in this recipe instead of the dried mango.  The bars were actually quite good but not very mango-y like I was hoping.  If I make this again I'll try a stronger-tasting fruit...strawberry, pineapple, kiwi?  I liked the extra gooeyness from the fresh fruit even though it took longer to bake.

I just happen to have all of the ingredients at home and wanted to use out some dried mango that I had so I thought this would be the perfect way.  The bottom part was more like batter and didn't bake so well and the filling part is just ok.  I don't think I'll make these again.

Good recipe! It's a bit too sweet and doesn't really taste like mango, but it is yummy and easy to make.

Just ok.  As others have said, I tasted no mango.   In fact my first bite tasted like flour.   Also confirm that it takes quite a bit more than 20 min to bake.   I went with 40-45 and the consistency of filling seemed right.

I made this recipe, without the lemon extract (not avail in Mexico). I used 3 fresh(1 1/2 cups)"Manilla" mangos.  Took 1 hour to bake but turned out great. Rich, buttery andl great flavor.  Will make again.

These were not good at all, couldn't even taste the mango at all, therefore way too sweet.  Horrible brown colour too.

Made it last night and followed the 20 minutes or so bake time. The top didn’t set so I thought that’s the way it was. After it cooled I cut it and the top was still  soggy. This morning I baked it for another 45 minutes and at toothpick test the top was set. Please note to bake it at almost an hour and do the toothpick test. 
I’ll probably use foil to cover the pan and even spray it with oil before applying the crust.

I made these last night and I would give them an A for taste. However the bottom crust was to thin and crumbly and, after baking, the filling was way to soft. I think both, but especially the filling, need longer baking times. Also it was difficult to seperate the bars from the waxed paper, once again, maybe the result of not baking long enough. They taste good enough to give them another try but this time I'm going to bake 'em til they're crusty. Last, I would leave off the powdered sugar dusting - I think it takes away from the taste of the filling.

This took way longer than 20 minutes to cook.  More like an hour.  Tasted good.

I had just enough left in a bag of dried mango and cherries to make this recipe, so I left the cherries in.  This baked up into a flavorful bar cookie, but if you’re really looking for mango flavor, it's not here.  Still very buttery, moist, fruity, and just pretty darn tasty.
