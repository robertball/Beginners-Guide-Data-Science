It was super easy. I doubled the water and carrots. Then added some parsnips. It went over well with the family.

My family and I loved this recipe. My 4 kids asked me to make it again and I will. I didn’t have beef bouillon so I just used the whole packet of dry gravy as there wasn’t that much left over. Also, didn’t add the celery because we only eat celery with blue cheese and chicken wings lol :) 
Thanks for a great recipe!!
