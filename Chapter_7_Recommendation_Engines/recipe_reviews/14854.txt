I did review this recipe already but after reading everyone else's reviews, I'd like to add something.  I guess it could be considered bland so add some pepperoni next time.  Also, you MUST increase the temp to 450 to brown it.  It's just a pile of mush if it isn't browned.  Trust me!

I added bacon, since it sounded like mini quiches. I wiped grease off w/a paper towel. It went over good at a family gathering.

I'm not a great cook, but I'm pretty sure I folowed the recipe exactly. The squares were not well received, and were a little greasy.

This took much longer than I expected.  I needed a "finger food" for a reception. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turns out so terribly greasy that I had to throw the whole thing out! I didn't want any "fingers" on this mess!

First, this seems a better side dish than appetizer. It is a bit greasy, and rather bland. The parmasan "crust" was a good idea. The filling just doesn't live up to it though. I wish I'd done what another reviewer suggested and made a batch ahead of time. I would NOT have made this to take to a party. But now I'm stuck!

I make this every summer when I have more zucchini from the garden than I know what to do with.  After making it a couple of times exactly as stated, I tried turning up the heat like some others suggested.  I turn the oven up to 360ยบ, and watch it closely to make sure it doesn't get too brown.  I also saute the onions and more garlic first.  Since it seems a little too greasy, I will try decreasing the oil next time to 1/4 cup or less.  And if you turn up the oven temp. you can forget toasting the sesame seeds beforehand, since they will get brown.  I also add more bread crumbs, 1/2 to 3/4 cup.

Use 1/4 cup of oil - saute the onions and garlic for 2 or 3 minutes and add the zucchine and saute for 3 or 4 minutes.  Roast the sesame seeds in a dry pan.   It'll be 4 stars!

This was an awful, greasy, tasteless mess!!! It took almost an hour to prep with all the grating, and it had no taste. I made this for a party, and ended up bringing doughnuts because I was too embarrased to bring this concoction.

OK, but waaay too greasy as other said.  I would probably leave out the oil and the breadcrumbs to make it more like a quiche--you don't need them.

I too thought it too greasy, and the prep time was more than 5 minutes. Might have enjoyed them if not quite so mushy. My kids did like them.

This recipe was pretty easy to prerare, but it was missing something. I even had my 7 year old daughter try it and she didn't care for it. It was ok, but I don't think I would serve it without trying a batch beforehand to make sure I liked it first.

Much too oily! I will omit the vegetable oil if I try this one again. I used fresh herbs and omitted the sesame seeds as well.

My husband wasn't a big fan, but ate seconds!  My great nephew (2 years old) absolutely loved it.  I cut it into bite size squares & it was finger food for him.  I love quiche & knew I'd love this recipe.  Thanks so much!

I made this for a party... didn't have zucchini so I used broccoli and mushroom. doubled the recipe so it was thicker but used half the oil and used melted butter instead of oil. Used 1/2 egg whites. Didn't have breadcrumbs so I crushed pita chips. Didn't have all cheddar so added monterey jack and parm. Sprinkled with more parm to serv. Liked the nuttiness of the sesame. It was a big hit. The recipe gave me a start and it was delicious.
