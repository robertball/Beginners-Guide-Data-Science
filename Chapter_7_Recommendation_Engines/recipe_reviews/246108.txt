Although the chorizo brought a nice spicy flavor, to us it was too "beany". Garnishing with cheese, sour cream and green onions actually helped the flavor a lot. For what I am used to, this chili should include more spices and other ingredients...

Made it with vegetarian chorizo, browned separately, in a nonstick skillet.  Soooo good you wouldn’t know it’s vegetarian!

This is the easiest, most flavorful chili recipe ever!  I made it a second time with turkey chorizo and it was just as tasty as the regular.

I replaced the yellow onion with a red, and I will absolutely make this again. Everyone in my house loves chorizo so this was a no brainer.

Made this tonight for a friend and I. I like a little heat and this was just right. I also like that half of the beans were black beans, which I prefer to kidney beans. I can hardly wait to have it again tomorrow. chili is always better on the second day.

This was a spicy chili but the sour cream and cheese really dialed back to hot.  I enjoyed it very much.

I had mixed reviews from my family on this chili, one son hated it, said it was too spicy, other son liked the chili, but didn't like the chorizo sausage, my husband loved it, and I felt it needed more beans, less chorizo and maybe sugar as I found it too acidic with the tomatoes and vinegar from the adobo sauce. The cheese and sour cream do help with the flavour and spiciness. When I purchased the chorizo they had spicy and mild, I bought one of each, next time just mild and see how that works out as I like the idea of this type of chili. #Ad #AllrecipesAllstarsCA #EndWithAmazing

Liked this spicy chili and as I love chorizo sausage, didn't remove from the thin casings and used as is. But be forewarned it IS spicy.

This was a really good recipe. super quick and simple. I really liked the use of chorizo sausage instead of the usual ground beef. 
I was afraid the flavour might be a little to strong for my taste but with the addition of sour cream it really softened it up. My husband loved it and wants it in a weekly dinner rotation!

This chili is great! I like the use of no-salt-added beans and tomatoes, since the sausages are salty enough. The aroma of the smoked paprika and smoky chipotle peppers cooking with the onions and garlic was absolutely divine. The chili has a nice kick, not overly so, and it mellows by the following day. The recipe is easy to prepare, has great flavour, uses relatively few and simple ingredients, so I'm very happy with the result!
