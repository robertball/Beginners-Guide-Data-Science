Maybe it's not fair for me to rate it since I submitted it - but it's awesome. Since I submitted it - I've tried a few variations and I really like it topped with French fried onions. Try it - you'll see - it's delicious ;-)

I've bought a few packet mixes of Chinese Tomato Soup in the past, and really liked it. Apart from leaving out the celery, I made this as written, and, sadly, didn't like it all. The flavors just didn't work well for me. The apple sauce made it really sludgy, and I wish I'd omitted the brown sugar because it turned out SO sweet. I even made fresh prawn crackers to go with it (and the oil smell totally stank out my house). Sorry for the low rating.

We did not like this.  We made it to use up ingredients around the house, and we did not enjoy the flavor combinations.  Our guest said it was OK, but I don't if it was honesty or if she was being polite.

I'll give this five stars because it's very easy to make and the taste is quite good! I have been to Holland and Belgium and it reminds me of soups you can get there. Also easy to modify. Next time I make it I will use lower sodium tomato juice and/or a lower sodium chicken or beef broth. I added lots of extra celery and green onions. Fresh ginger would also be a nice change. Thank you for the unique twist on tomato soup - definitely low calorie!!

Made an account to rate this soup. It's great. I'm a Dutch person and it is a good approach to the soup served in Chinese restaurants over here. I used fresh tomatoes (boiled and whizzed) instead of the tomato juice. Added a bit of extra chilli and a little less sugar for my personal taste.

I thought the flavor was great.  It's a little different than your average soup, but that's what the recipe intends.
The recipe says to simmer for 20 minutes.  I brought it to a boil TWICE and simmered it for an hour and the celery still came out crunchy. To avoid boiling off too much of the broth while cooking the celery, I would saute the celery in a pan first, then add it to the soup.  That is the only reason I'm giving it three stars.  Otherwise, I would give it five.
