I tried this recipe because it was so different from other cake recipes.  My husband likes it so much he had two pieces.  The only thing I did different was to add Splenda to the strawberries and let them sit so they could blend together.

I thoughly enjoyed the way the flavors blended together when you took a bite.

I made a sour cream pound cake from scratch, using the same number of eggs, butter, vanilla, and the basil, then made the balsamic strawberries as directed. It was delicious. I really liked that it was not overly sweet, and the basil was very subtle but added a nice herbal note. I took it to a zoo concert and shared with my friends and total strangers; universal thumbs way up.

I was hesitant about this cake. I am sorry but IMO, basil does not belong in cake. The basil does come through in the flavor but my friends and I did't care for it. And am not sure why everyone seems to be crazy for strawberries and Balsamic vinegar. Not a fan here either. I feel bad I couldn't get on board about this recipe Jenn.

The cake was excellent the balsamic strawberry I thought sounded good and then I heard one of the mechanics at my husbands work refer to the sauce as motor oil. So recommend another sauce or a lighter version of this one

This was really good and has a fresh taste to it.  Would be great for those that don't really care for icing.

My mom loves  strawberry shortcake...I will be making this cake for her next birthday. The basil gives it a lemony flavor, it's very moist and the tangy strawberries are very refreshing. I tried sifting powdered sugar over the top but it disappeared due to the moisture in the cake. Awesome!

Very nice moist cake, not too sweet. The basil and balsamic vinegar flavours were unique and tasty.

The Basil cake was delicious.   I could eat it without the strawberries as well as with the balsamic berries.   Definitely will do this again.
