STOP! Before you add a whole cup of super fattening oil....use a cup or more of unsweetened applesauce. I rate this 5 stars! I did the applesauce substitution and also used whole wheat pastry flour. I also cut the sugar down to 2 cups (I used cane juice) and dang if these healthier adjustments didn't make it moist and fabulously better for you! I can never justify adding over a 1/4 c. oil to anything baked. The kids loved it. The dogs loved it. And most importantly I loved it!

The bread turned out great.  I ended up having to bake it at a lower temp for a little longer because it was getting burned on the outside and still raw on the inside.  A tip for those who don't have pumpkin pie spice, you can make your own that works just great for this recipe.  3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice = 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 3/8 tsp allspice (or cloves), 3/4 tsp ground ginger, and 3/8 tsp nutmeg.

This recipe is delicious!  I used 5.75" X 3.25" pans (for gifts).  The recipe made 6 gift loaves and they were a HUGE hit!  For the smaller pans, I baked them for 20 minutes, then covered them with foil and baked another 20-25 mintues.  YUM!

This was pretty good pumpkin bread though I think it needs more spices.  I combined the recommendations of others and used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour.  I also used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  It made two loaves(8.5X4.5 pans) plus 6 muffins.

I made this just as the recipe directed and my review is based on doing just that, with no changes.   I found this to be moist (but really, how often do you come across a dry pumpkin bread, especially with a cup of oil?), pretty, and with the compact but tender crumb you'd expect.  It also had a deep, pumpkin color. Choosing this recipe was merely for the reason that it called for less spice than I'm used to, and no nuts or raisins. I wanted to try something different.  Unfortunately, pretty loaf as it is, a loaf that admittedly turns out perfectly, it is only mildly pumpkin flavored, and only mildly spiced.  In a word, it's basically kind of blah.  Moist, beautiful, but blah.  Amp up the spices, or add raisins, craisins, nuts or SOMETHING, and this could easily be improved to at least 4-star quality.

I felt it needed a little more pumpkin flavor, but the texture was wonderful and stayed moist.

I used the Pumpkin Pie Spice I recipe for the pumpkin spice. I took the advice of a reviewer on there and added 1/4 tsp cloves to that blend--and it's more clovey than I like. I think next time I will make the recipe as stated. So, back to this recipe. As advised by other reviewers, I doubled the spices to 6 tsp, and the pumpkin as well (two 15oz cans vs. one can). I also eliminated the oil entirely, exchanged one cup of white sugar for a cup of brown, and added 1/2 cup of applesauce, and baked for 70 minutes. It came out so perfectly that I'm surprised a blue ribbon didn't materialize on the pan the second it came out of the oven. A perfect chewy crust and a very dense and tender crumb, just WOW. Gorgeous. I'm giving it 5 stars based on that, even though the flavor isn't quite there for me (I'm sure people who like a little more cloves than I do would be delighted with it). Once I tweak my spice blend to my own preference, I bet it will be absolutely divine.

The plan was to give one loaf away and keep one for our family...we ate it all and figured it was a good thing we never told the neighbors about it.

I made this recipe (and tripled it) for school and got nothing but rave reviews.  It was easy and it tasted great!  Instead of 2 loaf pans however, I made it into bundt pan size adn the cooking time was still right on.

Amazing bread! I have made it 4 times now, and it never lasts long in my house. I usually half the recipe, which makes 1-2 loaves. I add more pumpkin pie spice, and a little cinnamon too. I tried another user's tip of applesauce, but it wasn't as good as the original version. Tip: Dont fill the loaf pan more than halfway!

This is now my go to recipe for quick breads. Want to change it up...use applesauce, or blend up some bananas. I do add a bit more pumpkin then it calls for. I use about 21 oz. This works for muffins and "cakes" as well. I made this as a "cake" and forsted it with cream cheese frosting. YUM!

My family LOVED these!!  
I used fresh pumpkin instead of a can.  Since it was real pumpkin I left out the 1/2 cup of water and made muffins instead of bread.  Makes a great muffin!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great flavor. I followed the recipe as stated. I think for my oven it needed to bake at a lower temperature for longer time. I baked my loaves for about 70 - 75 minutes and the outside got dark and slightly crusty. It still turned out great though. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Great recipe! Bread came out moist and pretty dense, I subbed half the oil for applesauce, and it definitely held up. It does taste like pumpkin pie, will use whenever I have leftover canned pumpkin for sure.

I love this bread! I made it with 1/2 whole wheat flour and replaced the 1/2 cup water with vanilla yogurt. I also used 1 teaspoon more spice. Very moist and flavorful. Instead of 2 loaves, I made 1 loaf and 12 muffins. The muffins baked in about 20 minutes, while the loaf took the full 70 minutes. I like the idea of trying it with walnuts, and a crumble topping on the muffins would be terrific. Try this recipe!

wow. i put my loaves in the oven for 50 minutes, and they came out raw. I put them back in and set the timer for another 20 minutes. still raw
Update: one of my loaves was cooked in an aluminum pan and it was only raw on the bottom. Make sure to use thin pans to cook your bread in.

delicious recipe, easy, mistake proof, my eleven year old daughter baked this, and it came out perfect, it did take the full time to bake, and it does make two loaves so the eggs, sugar and oil can be justified.  We would definitely use this recipe again, it makes the house smell so good when it is baking.

very good! I did as other reviews said and froze it (everyone said it was better after being frozen). It was just a tad bit dry for my taste but that could just be me?   I will keep this and make it again! Thanks for a great recipe!

i think this recipe is great i have made it twice once as stated. and once with alternatives.  I read other suggestions for making a lower fat version with applesauce, but why not just substitute more pumpkin.  That is what i did and it turned out great. The canned pumpkin i had on hand was a 29oz can I did not want to waste the remainder so i just used it all, no oil . also used my own spices which  were 3 tsp cinnamon  1 1/2 tsp ginger and 3/4 tsp clove. I added a few grates of fresh nutmeg as well, and 1/2 cup less sugar. I baked in 9x13 cake pan and defeated the purpose of less fat by adding cream cheese frosting but it was so good.

Wish I had read more reviews before making this.  It definitely needs more spice and nuts or raisins or something.  I actually added pecans but kept the rest of the recipe exact.  It's okay but banana bread is better.  Perhaps with more spices or frosting or something it will be a bigger hit.  Wish I had made another pumpkin pie instead.

I think this is a great recipe. I did find that it required a longer baking time than instructed... in my oven it took about 80 minutes. I covered the bread with foil for the last 20 minutes or so to allow the inside to bake evenly and prevent the top from burning. I was anxious and tried a piece as soon as it came out of the oven and it was not nearly as good as when I had it the next morning. Fresh out of the oven the bread tastes bland, but the flavor intensifies once it has had time to set. So I recommend taking Tanja's advice and waiting until the next day!!!

This recipe is very good. I always add a pkg of cream cheese to my sweet bread recipes. Also when making this recipe I add cinnamon chips. They are like chocolate chips and are AMAZING in this bread.

This was pretty good. It definitely gets very moist the day after baking, which gives it a great dense texture - I really liked it. But I even doubled (well, almost tripled!) the spice amount and added a little extra pumpkin and this still was lacking a little something. It was tastey, just not what I was expecting. Good use of random cans of pumpkin though!

I LOVE pumpkin, and this is, hands down, the best pumpkin bread I've ever had in my life!  I am an American living in the UK, and my English friends, who have little experience with pumpkin, loved this.  If you need a pumpkin bread recipe, look no further : )

I made this in a 9 x 13 pan and added an oatmeal crumb topping.  It was delicious and a small piece was a sufficient serving so the yield of 24 was accurate.  It was easy to cut in the pan and serve.

This is fantastic! My husband is super picky so I wasn't sure if he would eat it, but he ate both loaves and asked me to make more :) I had no eggs, so I used 1 cup of applesauce and increased the baking powder to 2 tsp. It came out so moist and we didn't even miss the eggs, so I'm just not going to put them in anymore. Also, I added another shake or two of pumpkin pie spice, because it is so yummy!

I made this as a surprize for my boyfriend.  It turned out perfect actually.  I used a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream on top of a thick slice and it made it even more perfect.  This is really easy to make and the pumpkin can be substituted for Mangos or Bananas too... (using nutmeg instead of pumpkin spice).

This is the best bread I have ever had!  I sprinkle the top with raw sugar before baking, wrap it in some plastic wrap & cute ribbon, and give it away as Christmas gifts.  It has made my Christmas gift giving far less stressful and people are always very grateful to receive this sweet loaf!

Yum! Just the recipe I was looking for. It was a nice moist quick bread. To optimize the moisture, leave in the pan for 10 minutes, then cool completely on a cooling rack, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap overnight for best results. I also added a few more dashes of cinnamon to mine. Really good!

Wow!  I took the advice of several others and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  I did half whole wheat flour and half white.  I added ground flax seed too.  I used one cup brown sugar and one cup white instead of 3 c white.  My house smells so good!  The bread is yummy!  I kept one mini loaf and gave four away.

What a delicious recipe with only a cup of oil for three loaves of bread it's perfectly moist, and crispy, not soggy as I've found with adding apple sauce.  I'm enjoying a warm slice with a cup of tea as I write this!  Absolutely wonderful.  Thank you for sharing this!

I cut this recipe in half to make 12 muffins instead of one loaf. I did lighten it up and health it up a bit. I used whole wheat flour, 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup homemade organic applesauce, two egg whites in place of one egg and brewed unsweetened chai in place of the plain water. I did sprinkle just a touch of brown sugar over the top just to make them a little prettier. These took about 20 minutes in a 350* oven and they came out perfect. I'll make these again.

My rating is based on a few changes I made, but I'm sure the original recipe is wonderful too!  I use whole wheat flour to make it healthier and half applesauce/half oil.  I also like to cut down on the sugar, but use orange juice instead of the water.  As suggested by other reviewers I also increase the spices slightly.  The bread turns out moist and very flavorful!  My whole family loves it, kids included.

This is a great recipe. I had some lefrover pumpkin puree in the freezer and used it to make this bread. It is fantastick. I halved the recipe and mixed it all by hand. I also added a little bit of chocolate chips into the batter. I also added a tsp. of vanilla with the wet ingredients for extra flavor. It has great flavor and texture. It's got just the right amount of spice to it so that it doesn't come out tasting more like spice bread like some other recipes. Very moist without being dense. I wish I could give it more then 5 stars. I'm a hard critic so that's saying a lot. Next time i think i will try adding some orange zest and walnuts. I see tons of possibility for additions to this wonderful basic pupmkin bread.

AWESOME! My 6&8yr old kids beg for this. To lighten it, I used 1/2 cup natural applesauce and 1/2 cup oil and it came out moist and flavorful. Good thing it makes 2 loaves or else I'd be in the kitchen all day making more. Thanks for a great recipe! It's a "keeper."

I really liked this pumpkin bread; moist and flavorful. I made some tea sandwiches with it by spreading cream cheese blended with powdered sugar, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice between slices and quartering them. Yum!

a big hit with my family, who would normally prefer chocolate cake or oreos as a snack! my 3 year old daughter kept asking for them as her part of her breakfast or after-school snack. as other's suggested, i double the pumpkin pie spice (6 tsp instead of 3) and used 1 cup of chunky apple sauce instead of the oil; and used 2 cups white sugar plus 1 cup brown sugar. it was great this way, by i think i can get away with less sugar the next time, since i used applesauce.

Loved the density of the bread...still not enough pumpkin flavor for me.  I may make again and tweak for more flavor.

Poured the batter into mini muffin pans and cooked for about 12-15 minutes then immediately after I had taken them out of the oven I brushed a small amount of melted butter on top and coated the whole thing in sugar. AMAZING!! 

Still waiting a day to try to loaf of bread I made also. The recipe yields a lot of batter so I felt the need to experiment!! :)

I used homemade sweet potato puree in place of the pumkin and I added an extra teaspoon of pumkin pie spice. I also added the water in with the wet ingredients by mistake, but it turned out fine and I'll do it that way in the future. My son who requested pumkin bread, thought this was great, so did the rest of the family!

This was a very easy recipe, I love pumpkin bread and it was easy using just the pumpkin pie spice instead of having to buy three different types of spices although I already had cinnamon. I did add vanilla and a little extra pumpkin and cinnamon because I had bought the bigger can of pumpkin.  I didn't use as much water since I used extra pumpkin and it was still moist.  I think next time I am going to try applesauce in place of the oil and raisins as well. This recipe will definitely be used again soon!

Followed other reviewers suggestions of reducing the white sugar a little and mixing brown and white sugar. I used 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil. Added a REALLY ripe banana and more pumpkin pie spice + cinnamon. Beautiful outcome, but you can definitely taste the apple element. Would make it again.

This bread was AMAZING!!! I made it in muffin tins instead for an easy breakfast. I also added more pie spice and some cinnamon. I mixed white sugar, brown sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled on top before I put them in the oven. DELISH!!!

I tweaked it a bit, but it turned out great! And yes, you really do want to wait overnight before you try it. It gets a nice, moist quality after about 12 hours.

This was a great recipe.  I made one 9x5 loaf and 4 mini loaves.  The mini loaves were done about 15 minutes before the larger loaf.

I rated this bread a 4 star because I took other's recommendation to make some adjustments to the recipe for more healthier eats. I used 1 3/4 c. of all-purpose flour and 1 3/4 c. of whole wheat flour, added extra sprinkles of cinnamon on top of pumpkin pie spices, used 1 c. brown sugar, 1 1/4 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. molasses and 1 c. applesauce to substitute for vegetable oil. Everyone even my food-fussy friend absolutely loved the bread! I would try to use lower temperature for longer time since crust was more cooked than inside part. Top with cream cheese was like a cherry on the top!

Wonderful! Great for bread or for muffins. ( I made one loaf of bread and 12 muffins.) I made 2 substitutions: 1) 1.5 cups brown sugar, 1.5 cups white 2) 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup + 2T Greek yogurt. Next time I'd use even less oil!

Absolutely Delish! I only used 1/8 cup oil and the rest was No Sugar Added Applesauce.  I also cut the sugar down to 2 cups instead of 3 because applesauce is naturally sweet. I made some Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting and served it with that.  My family was in Autumn Food Heaven! :D

This recipe is easy and the result is delicious.  I used the recipe to make muffins for my son's pre-school.  I filled the baking cups about 2/3 and baked for 25 minutes.  Every child in the class LOVED the muffins.  Some even asked for seconds...

This is the best pumpkin bread I've made-or tried!  In a large family, the two loaves lasted a day.  Moist, flavorful, I don't think you can go wrong making this bread for friends/family.

This was really good, I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and used white flour for the rest, you couldn't even taste it.  I also used 1/2 cup of sweetened cinnamon applesauce and only 1/2 cup of oil.  These made great muffins and I spread cream cheese on them, no need to make a frosting, but I'm sure it would be delicious.

This is perfect.  With one substitution>>>  I make my own pumpkin pie spice by using 1&1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 tsp. nutmeg, 3/4 tsp ginger, 3/8 tsp. ground cloves.
  I make it weekly for my uncle who just goes crazy if I'm out of town and unable to bake it for him.

Like other reviewers, I used half white and half brown sugar, and also didn't have pumpkin pie spice.  Used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp ground ginger, 3/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp ground cloves instead.  This came out deliciously moist.  Not overly sweet, either.  It's perfect warmed with butter for breakfast.

Delicious!! After reading some reviews I made a couple of changes...I used 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar...and 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the top of them before I baked them. I made 2 pans of muffins and 2 pans of mini loaves. I love that the recipe made enough to save and freeze. My two boys (one is extremely picky) loved them. The texture was wonderful and they are moist...yummy!!

I made this recipe with the following adjustments:a can of squash instead of pumpkin and I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice, or nutmeg, so I just used cinnamon- lots of it. I also baked them in muffin tins at 350 degrees for around 17 min and topped with a coffee cake strudel topping before popping them in the oven The result- a wonderful strudel topped squash muffin. The batch made about 28 muffins every one of which were gobbled right up!

Awesome recipe! First time hit, however I made couple of changes, still great! First I used half unbleached white flour and half whole wheat white flour, then I reduced the amount of sugar to two cups and added some raisins for sweetness. Even without raisins, I realized two cups of sugar would be enough!
My 8 and 6 yr old love the bread it's a family fav now. Crispy from outside and moist from inside. Well keep making it.

The recipe was easy to follow and did turn out moist.  It was not bad at all but and it was a little more tasty the next day.  However, I really wanted more pumpkin taste.  I may try adding more pumpkin spice and using the applesauce instead of oil and perhaps the 2 c sugar and 1 of brown sugar suggestion mentioned.

I had trouble baking this. After an hour, the outside was brown and rock-hard, but the inside was still gooey and raw. I upped the pumpkin and the spices. It tastes good, but I wish it would have baked up a little nicer.

I tried this, substituting oil with applesauce (calls for a lot of oil!). Next time I'll cut down on the sugar. The applesauce was unsweetened, but I think it still made the bread overall a little too sweet. Good and moist, though.

A really good quick bread!  I made some alterations just because I didn't have pumpkin pie spice and was looking for something a little spicy.  I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cardamom, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp ginger, a dash of cayenne pepper and a sprinkle of cloves.  Also added a cup of dried cranberries and a cup of walnuts (not necessary but was a very nice combo with the pumpkin).  I'd definitely make this one again.

loved this recipe. I was looking for lower calories and couldn't see using 3 cups of sugar. I cut it to under two cups, cut eggs to 3, 3/4 cup oil. I weakened and added 1/2 cup walnuts.well it turned out great! Next time I am going to cut more sugar and egg and see how it turns out.

My 8 yr old and I made this one weekend and it turned out fabulous! It was so good that I decided to make it again for Christmas gifts to family friends! The loaves came out perfect, but while I was cooling them, the dog got on the kitchen table and helped himself! I had to bake a new batch at 10 p.m. Christmas Eve. The second batch was not as pretty as the first. I also added walnuts to the recipe and it still came out fantastic!

Very moist and delicious! Baked this the first time AS IS and it was good-but it was extremely moist with little pumpkin/spice flavor. So I baked it again but added way more spice PLUS tried to "healthify" it by substituting 1c unsweetened applesauce, 1c brown sugar, and 2c whole wheat flour, and it was so much better! "Healthy" substitutions DO NOT compromise flavor, and I very much prefer this version

I made this today because I had a can of pumpkin pie mix sitting around and didn't feel like making a pie. I was a little worried about using this instead of puree, but it came out delicious and moist. I cut back on the sugar by a half cup, because the pumpkin mix contained sweet syrup. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just added 1 tsp of cinnamon, ginger, and 1/2 tsp. cloves to the mixture. I also used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil as some reviewers suggested. I was able to make 12 muffins and 2 nice size loafs from this recipe.  The kitchen smelled like a gingerbread pumpkin pie heaven! My family loved them and said they were the best ever! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I also doubled the pumpkin and spice.  Came out very moist (although seemed not quite done in spots) and tasty but really fluffy and good.  I will probably make this one again, maybe with some chocolate chips again.

I meant to halve this recipe (only had one loaf pan) but accidentally dumped the whole 15-oz can of pumpkin puree in the bowl. It actually turned out great--I recommend doubling the amount of pumpkin the recipe calls for if you really like moist, pumpkin-y flavor. I also put in a bit more seasoning than was called for.

OH MY GOD!! I made this bread for Thanksgiving, and I liked it more than any dessert we had on the table. It was sweet and moist, and I was so glad it made 2 loaves because we all wanted the left overs. Delicious!!!

I love pumpkin pie, so I had to try making this bread.  My review?  Delicious!  I also added extra spices (nutmeg and allspice), and used 1/2 natural applesauce and 1/2 oil.  Additionally, I added a small bag of chopped walnuts to the bread mixture before baking.  Besides eating it, the best part about making this bread was the scent of pumpkin pie spices wafting through the air of the kitchen.  First-rate!

It's awesome.  I also did 1/2 brown and white sugar, added walnuts and a splash of vanilla.  Also used 8x4 inch loaf pans and got four loafs out of it. Great bread.

I just made this today and although pumkin pie is one of my favs, I was rather disapointed with this. I dont know if it was cause I mistakenly added one of the bigger cans of pumkin instead of the smaller cans, but I didnt find it very tasty at all. I even added powedered sugar on top to try and make it more flavorful but that didnt do the trick. Im unsure if I will be making this again, I feel that it needs something else and Im just not sure what.

Just made this recipe with the following minor changes:
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup natural applesauce
1 cup white sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
2 teaspoons cinnamon
2 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon cloves
1 1/2 teaspoon ginger
1 cup crushed pecans
This made 1 9x5 loaf and 12 muffins. Muffins were done in 21 minutes.
I liked the texture and the flavor. It is very good.

It tastes like cake!  I totally felt guilty for giving it to my kids with breakfast.  I think I'll try the applesauce/oil substitution suggested by another reviewer to make it a bit healthier.  DELICIOUS, though.

I made the bread exactly as stated and agreed with several others that it was sort of bland.  The texture and color are great, and my kitchen smelled amazing! but the actual bread was eh... for 3 cups of sugar, it wasn't super sweet either.  I served it with butter and a spinkle of cinnamon sugar to make it a bit yummier.  Overall, I would say it's ok.

Wow this was delicious!  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just did 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cloves, 2 tsp cinnamon.  Before putting it in the oven I sprinkled pumpkin seeds down the middle...made for a nice presentation and added some crunch. I used a rather large can of pumpkin and had enough to make a 3rd loaf by dividing this recipe in half...IT WAS THAT GOOD!!!

Amazing! 
I used 1 cup of applesauce instead of vegetable oil. I didn't add any water because I used fresh pumpkin puree` instead of canned.
Couldn't be better!

So delicious!  I made this recipe last weekend for a Halloween party at our office.  It went quick, many people asked for the recipe. 
I made my loaves with organic pumpic pie puree rather than pure pumpkin.  Keeping this one on hand for many future holiday partys.

Delicious!  I don't like to use a whole lot of oil either, but didn't have applesauce, so I used 1 - 4 oz jar of pears and 1/2 a 4 oz jar of apples, bananas and pears baby food and 1/4 cup of canola oil.  I made 3 5x3 loaves and a 9 inch loaf pan.  The 3 are for gifts, but I'm not sure my family will let them get there!  Thanks Tanja!

This was really good! I only have one loaf pan, so I halved the recipe. The only change I made was using brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar. Oh, and I snuck in a little extra pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. It turned out super moist and dense and flavorful. Perfect for these chilly Autumn days. :-) Thanks Tanja!

This bread was great my husband and 1yr old loved it.  I could not believe it was gone so fast!  I did sub half the flour for whole wheat and half the oil for applesauce.  I would pefer it to have a little more spice flavor (could be due to the use or wheat), but try it as is first.  I'm making more as we speak to take to a party.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! Since my family is trying to be more health conscious, I made a few healthier alterations--I used whole wheat flour, cut the sugar in half (2cups) and instead of using a cup of oil, I used a cup of applesauce. It turned out lovely. Thanks for sharing, we will definately be making this again.

Pretty good. It makes a lot.I dislike cloves and found the flavour of them overwhelming, so next time they will be left out. I used apple sauce too, and it was wonderfully moist!

I made this mostly by the exact recipe but because so many people said to use applesauce instead of oil I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce.  Also, because a number of people indicated to add extra spices because it wasn't very pumpkin-y I added an extra teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, a couple of dashes of nutmeg and cinnoman.  I cooked it at 375 for 65 minutes (I have a gas stove so most of my cooking requires higher temps) and the bread came out nice.  Looked pretty and smelled wonderful.  Now for the bad - it REALLY did NOT taste like anything.  The spices gave it a wonderful aroma but this bread really did not have a good taste or flavor.  It was too bad because with the great smell I was looking forward to a tasty bread but this did not meet my expectations.

This bread is so moist! I used pumpkin puree that I made at home instead of canned pumpkin and added 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Turned out great. Next time I think I will add nuts and try some of the healthier alternatives.

I must agree with a previous poster - 1 cup of oil is far too much!  I used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also used 2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead.  I will venture into cutting back the sugar too and see how the recipe fairs with less sugar.  All in all - this may not be the healthiest bread but it came out DELICIOUS!  Batter made 24 muffins (paper liners filled to the top) - baked for 25 minutes (be sure to rotate the pans every 10 minutes).

An extremely tasty bread that could use a little more spice. A perfect treat to send to your college student as it will easily last 3-4 days in the mail!

this is an excellent recipe.  After reading the comments, I substituted the oil for unsweetened applesauce and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  It is so easy to make and is so delicious.  My boyfriend told me he didn't like pumpkin, but after trying this bread, he loves it.

I LOVE making this bread. It's very simple to do and makes such a nice gift for my neighbors around the holidays. The flavor is perfect and it always turns out moist and soft. I would definitely recommend this recipe! I can't wait to start making it again this year :)

This was my first time making any sort of bread.  This was tasty and really easy to make.  I used fresh pumpkin and cut down just a bit on the sugar since I didn't want it too sweet.

YUM-OH!!! THis recipes was wonderful. What I did was cut back the sugar to 2 cups, used 3 eggs instead of 4, and instead of the water,  I used the water from when I roasted my pumpkins for puree. Next time I will try with brown sugar, but this pumpkin bread was wonderful, and my family couldnt wait for it to cool down before they wanted to nibble and come back for seconds and third..HA! So looks like I will be baking more of this bread this week. Thank you again for an yummy recipe =)

I did several healthier modifications, and this was fantastic (I'm sure it would have been great as written too, but I wanted to be able to enjoy it without so much guilt!) :) I replaced all of the oil with about 1 1/4 c. unsweetened apple sauce, used 3 eggs and 1/3 c. egg whites and used 1.5 c. sugar and 1.5 c. Splenda. I would have used at least 1/2 whole wheat flour if I'd had it, but I was out. This came out perfecty - nice density, chewy and very moist! I added an extra dash of seasoning too for a little extra pumpkin spice zing. Yummy! :)

Used whole wheat flour; only 2 C sugar instead of 3 as per other reviews & it was plenty sweet; used 1 TBS cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cardamom which was just enough spice; used scant 1/2C oil and replaced the other 1/2 C oil with 1/2 more pumpkin. And I made muffins instead of bread. An incredible recipe that I will make again and again!

I have been making this for 5+ years now.   This recipe is great as is.  But I have learned to tweek it depending on my needs each time.  I sometimes use applesauce to replace part of the oil.  I often use separate spices instead of pumpkin pie spice so I can change if I want more cinnamon flavor or ginger etc.   Also can use brown sugar for part of sugar or decrease sugar.  This recipe is great and forgiving if you want to play with it.

I made a really healthy version and it's still mouth watering. Substitutions: all purpose flour --> whole wheat flour 3 cup sugar --> 1 cup agave syrup, 1 cup maple syrup.  You could cut this down more, as it was still very sweet. 1 cup vegetable oil --> 1 1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce 1/2 cup water --> 1/4 cup water. 1 teaspoon salt --> 1/2 teaspoon salt.  I made muffins with half the batter and a loaf with the other half.  It would have been even better if I'd sprinkled chopped pecans or walnuts on top.  Great recipe!

This was SO delicious!  I improvised in a few areas...  I didn't sift anything, I used fresh pumpkin puree, and only a 1/8c. water since the pumpkin was more watery than canned.  I also added a tablespoon-ish of brown sugar and a squeeze of honey for a little extra flavor.  Very moist!  Muffins were awesome, too!

This was a pretty good bread. I used my bundt pan and cooked for about 60 minutes, half of that covered with foil. I used pumpkin pie mix instead of regular pumpkin but I wish I still would have added more spice for more of a kick.

Perfect! I applied the modifications of using only applesauce, half brown/half white sugar, and doubled the pumpkin w/ some extra pumpkin spice.  baked at 350 for 70 minutes and it turned out perfect. I also tried as pancakes and they were melt-in-your-mouth good!

Only used 6 servings to make 24 mini-muffins. Substituted half the sugar and oil with applesauce. Topped with cool whip.

AAmazing! I used 1.5 Cup of splenda instead of sugar and made it into cupcakes. Then as something extra which I felt it needed I added cream cheese icing it was so delicious:)

This pumpkin bread recipe turned out delicious, but I made a few modifications. I substituted all of the oil with unsweetened applesauce, used whole wheat flour, and reduced the sugar by 1/3. Out of the oven I didn't think they were anything special, but the pumpkin flavor really came out after 1-2 days in a plastic container. I'd definitely make this recipe again, next time adding cranberries and crushed pecans. Yum!

If this tastes as good as it has smelled the whole time it was baking, it will be a winner in my house!  I did alter the recipe as per other reviewers by using an entire can of pumpkin to make only 1 loaf, then added more spices proportionately.  Also used a half-and-half combination of vegetable oil and unsweetened applesauce.

The best pumpkin bread recipe by far!  So moist and flavorful!  I have substituted sugar free applesauce for the oil and found it doesn't make a difference in flavor or consistency!  Also, I made them into individual muffins to grab on the go and they work perfectly for that too!  Just decrease the baking time a bit!

This bread is so good. I altered a little. I used 1 1/2c brown sugar and 1c white sugar. I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil. I melted a little cream cheese icing and drizzled it on the bundt cake I made. It didn't last long. This is a keeper and great for gifts!!!

This is very good, I guess I'm just not a fan of pumpkin bread, I'd rather have the pie!  My 3 year old would have eaten half a loaf already if I'd let him though.  It was a little dryer than I expected from reading reviews, this may be due to the high altitude though (6000ft).  55 minutes would  have probably been sufficient, but was in for 60 according to recipe.

This was wonderful!  I made two loaves for a housewarming party, following the recipe almost exactly, but I added one extra cup of pumpkin because I wanted a strong pumpkin flavor in the bread.  Every one commented on how moist and sweet it was.  Next time I might add a tiny bit more pumpkin spice.  I also made one loaf with all whole wheat flour and stevia instead of sugar.  While it wasn't as good as the original, my diabetic friend raved about it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I LOVED this bread!  I did do a few modifications, though.  For starters, I used 100% whole WHITE flour-I tell you, this is a great way to get extra fiber into your cooking and, I swear, your family won't even notice!  Second, didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 2 teas. cinnamon and 1/2 teas. ginger.  I thought that 3 cups of sugar was WAAAY over the top, so I used 1 3/4 cups white sugar and 1/4 cup of molassas.  I also cut the oil to 1/3 cup oil, 1/3 cup Smart Balance butter spread, and 1/3 cup plain nonfat yogurt.  This bread was phenomenal!!  Moist, moist, and did I say moist??  I made a cream cheese frosting for it, and having made half of the recipe into muffins, it was the top request for my kid's school snacks that week.  I will be keeping this recipe in my recipe box and making it often!!

Great bread...never had pumpkin bread before I tried this recipe, but it was outstanding...It's definitely moist and tasty.  I did double the spices for the second batch, and found it to be even better.

This was amazing!!  Instead of pumpkin pie spice I used 1 1/2tsp cinnamon, 1/4tsp nutmeg, 3/4tsp both ginger & all spice & 1/8tsp ground clove.  It made one loaf and 12 muffins.  I think I will make all muffins (without papers)next time.  They are much easier to grab and go.

This was a wonderful recipe. The bread was delicious.I actually used smaller loaf pans and made 3 loafs instead of 2. I added chopped pecans to my batter along with substituting coconut milk for the water. I also added a brown sugar struesel on the top of the bread. This recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious!
After reading the other reviews, I changed the spices.
Instead of 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, I used
1 tsp each of allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground cloves
I also added walnuts.
Very tasty & I received a lot of compliments.

Very simple recipe that has great taste. Next time I will try adding a bit more spice to it though for that extra kick of flavor. All in all a great recipe.

I used 30 oz pureed pumpkin, 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup of white sugar, and 6 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice. Next time I will add 1/2 cup of applesauce and reduce oil to 1/2 cup.

This was a simplistic recipe that turned out wonderfully. As other reviewers recommended I added a tad more pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg and cinnamon, I also added raisins.  My grand kids helped with the recipe, and as they love muffins we made one large pumpkin loaf and a dozen huge muffins, all out of the one mix. Excellent recipe we have already made plans to make more next week.

I couldn't bear the thought of using 3 cups of white sugar so I used 2 tsp liquid Stevia, 1 c honey, and 2 apples (chopped, softened in microwave 3 min, mashed in Vitamix) to sweeten the recipe instead. I'm also gluten-free so I substituted GF flour for the white flour.  The bread tastes GREAT and inside is moist and yummy but the outside got burned.  If anyone has ideas for preventing this from happening, would love to hear them.

I added 1 teas vanilla and coarsely chopped walnuts.  Watch cooking time.  Mine was ready in 55 minutes.  Very good!  My husband even toasted for breakfast (with butter on it).

Making the recipe as originally directed. it was fine, but I am really trying to cut the extra oil/fat from my diet, so I used the modifications from user Limniade above, and once I tweak the spices to my liking, it will be amazing!
The only change I made, is that I added 2tbsp bourbon into the batter. It's part of how my dad always made pumpkin pie, and I really like the taste vs pumpkin things made without it.

It's definitely better the second day, and even without any sugary topping, it is great!!  I'm thinking the next time I might add some nuts or berries, or maybe substitute apple cider for the water.  Lots of opportunities to play!

I made this twice!    My rule for trying out new recipes is to make exactly like the recipe is written so I can review the actual recipe and not my changes to a recipe.    As written this recipe is a true winner.   I did halve the recipe since I could only find one of my loaf pans, but there's only two of us so that's not necessarily a bad thing.    The second run I added pecans to the batter and sprinkled the top with raw sugar that retains it's crunchiness after baking.    The recipe was still wonderful and a bit more unique.  I would suggest that if you are sprinkling with the sugar to make in a muffin tin as it was a little harder to slice and keep the topping in place.   My gas oven has convection bake so I cooked at the stated temp but needed to add an additional 10 minutes.  This is normal for my oven so not a big deal.   The loaf came out nice and chewy on the outside and very moist on the inside.

Just finished putting in oven. I also modified this recipe. I replaced the canola oil for olive oil. So I will see what happens. I love this recipe because it's simple. In the oven in 30 minutes. Awesome!

Absolutely delicious and moist!  Made a couple minor changes based off others reviews:  used 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 20 oz fresh pumpkin puree, 1 c. white sugar, 2 c. light brown sugar and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the top before putting in oven to give a little extra sweetness to the crust.

I didn't have any pumpkin but I had an enormous butternut squash, so I cooked that mashed it and substituted it for the pumpkin. I added a bit more spice because I like it that way.  The kids and their friends loved it. Good thing I made 3 loaves.  Yummy

I am writing this review after having tasted the bread a few hours out of the oven. Per instructions, it is best the next day, so take this with a grain of salt. I did make one change, substituting the 3/4 cup water for 3/4 of pumpkin puree, and I used homemade puree.  I thought the bread was OK. It was moist; pretty much all breads of this type are. The flavor was missing something in my opinion. Dunno, it just didn't come close enough to pumpkin pie to warrant the label. I've made a ton of pumpkin bread recipes. This one comes somewhere in the middle.

I made Thanksgiving for Easter dinner this year. The pumpkin bread was our dessert a la mode. The recipe is delicious, easy, moist, tastes like pumpkin pie and makes two loaves...one I added walnuts and one without. Both loaves were loved! Next time I'm going to add cranberries and walnuts.

Made a double batch of this for my husband's office Thanksgiving.  It made 8 small loaves and 16 muffins.  The kids were my taste testers and it got 2 thumbs up.  If my kids like it....it must be good!!

Took it to a college event and students devoured in no time!  Instead of "pumpkin pie spice" (which I didn't have), I used 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp cloves.  Definitely staying on my list of holiday favorites!

SO GOOD! After reading a bunch of reviews I ended up forgoing the one cup of oil for just over one cup of unsweetened apple cause plus 1/4 cup of oil. I also added about 1/2 a cup extra of pumpkin puree AND extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. In addition, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. It turned out really great and made a lot of bread. I'll definitely bake this again!

Made this today using the recipe as originally posted.  First, it was super easy AND ot made A LOT of batter. So much that I made a full bundt cake AND an 8x8 inch cake. Glad I did though because it's DELICIOUS!! My kids couldn't wait for it to cool so we tried it while it was still warm and so glad we did. I will be making this all winter! Thank you for sharing!!

I use fresh pumpkin in this receipt.  It is the best.  It turns out super moist every time.

This tasted just like pumpkin pie! My husband loves pumpkin pie, but not the typical pumpkin bread. He really liked this. I also added 1/4c applesauce and cut the oil to 3/4c.

Great recipe! Easy, quick, and delicious.  I added walnuts and cut back to two cups of sugar.  Also, I made it in a bundt pan. I've never been a pumpkin fan, but this recipe has won me over.

This is a nice, moist bread.  I've added extra pumpkin to it without any problems.  I don't use pumpkin pie spice, instead I use cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to my taste.  I've also cut the oil to about 1/2 cup without the bread being dry.  This bread really does taste better with age, although it's hard to wait 'till the next day to eat it.

Very good. Used whole wheat flour instead of white, applesauce instead of oil. Cut sugar down to 2 1/2 C but next time I will try 2 C, it was plenty sweet. Cooked for 60 mins. Thanks.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Like others suggested, I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 apple sauce.  I also used more spices than called for - like almost double the spices.  While the bread was ok - it really lacked PUMPKIN flavor.  I probably won't make this again.

I just made this today and it's awesome!  My kids especially loved it.  It does taste like pumpkin pie in bread form.  The only difference was I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used a dash of ginger, cinnamon, cloves and allspice instead.  Love it!

Very good!  In place of the oil I used applesauce, and used fresh pumpkin from the garden, it is a wonderful recipe!  Will definitely make this again.  I am actually going to make it for gifts this year since we have so many pumpkins in our garden and have a lot of pumpkin puree to use up!

This tastes just like pumpkin pie! Its so moist and flavorful. I bake for 30 minutes then cover with foil the remainder of the time so it will not burn. I used pumpkin pie spice I from this site and it was PERFECT with this recipe!

I used this recipe, but rather than using the full 3 cups of straight sugar I used half sugar half splenda.  It turned out excellent!  I love the taste!  I made a double batch, thinking I would get leftovers to last a couple days...NO WAY!  It was all gone!

lives up to its name - anyone who likes pumpkin pie probabably would like this.  It is very moist.  I used a large loaf plus tiny one and it came out perfectly.

Yummy. My six year old is banned from the kitchen becuase every time he comes in he eats a piece. It doesn't need as much sugar as it calls for..mind you it's yummy with it. But my last batch I used half the sugar and added a little more pumpkin. MMMM.

I have made this many, many times. It is my husbands favorite, even more so than chocolate baked goods, and he is a die hard chocoholic !!  The only thing that I change is instead of oil, I use unsweetened applesauce. This is a great bread to freeze, give as gifts, or just chow down on !!

The name fits perfectly.  But beware!  This is the first time I made bread, 
So I filled the pans too high, and as they rose they gooshed all over.  This also affected the cook time, adding on an extra 30 mins or more.  Made a second time, adding a bit extra of everything and split it between three pans: Perfect.  I swear my picky cousins didnt eat anything else that weekend and ALL FIVE LOAVES DISAPPEARED!!!   Just wanted to add another 5 to this wonderful, soft and desirable bread

This is a really good, and really easy, pumpkin bread.  I read a few of the reviews and settled on suggustions from the Sheri S. review...I highly suggest you do the same.  I also added Hershey's Cinnamon Chips to one loaf and Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips to the other one.  HEAVEN!

This was quite good. Very moist as expected but as others noted, bake it for 1 hour 15 mins at 300-325. My loaves were a little darker on the outside before the middle was done. Also, add a tsp of Vanilla and double the spice and you have perfection! That's why I only gave this one 4 stars-for these tiny improvements. Enjoy!

I have tried several recipes on this website, and although many of them are excellent, I have not been as compelled to leave a rating as I have with this recipe.  I'm making another couple of loaves as I type this.  My husband's coworkers and my family are asking for more.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

This recipe is a keeper. I am not a pumking pie person, but this bread was out of this world, sweet, moist, taste better the 2nd and 3rd day. I kept one loaf for us and took the other one to share with my friend after Bible study and they all said it was very good. Thank you so much for sharing.

I really like the flavors.  They aren't too overwelming.  I always add more spice to it.

Abolutely the most moist bread that we ever had! I cut the recipe in half for only one loaf, used olive oil instead of vegetable, the whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin, rapadura instead of white sugar (and reduced the sugar to 1 cup), added an extra 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and baked it for 70 minutes. When we tried it after it cooled, it was okay, but when we tried it after it had been in the fridge overnight, WOW! By far the most moist, flavorful pumpkin bread ever. Thank you Tanja for the recipe.

This bread was very good, moist, and with good flavor when a few exceptions were made. I followed one reviewer's suggestion to halve the recipe, but still add the full 15 oz can of pumpkin. I also added the full amount of pumpkin pie spice. The title is a bit misleading, as I didn't really think this tasted different than your standard pumpkin bread- but it was still delicious as that.

The recipe is fantastic as is... but I made it a little more of "my own" by whipping cream cheese and powdered sugar together and creating a marbled version!!!

very good.  I had left overs from when my daughter carved the pumpkin on halloween.  I use self rising flour instead of what is called for in the recipe (all purpose flour/baking soda/baking powder)  It still turned out very good, I also added a little cinnamin to the pumpkin while I was cooking it.

This is the most delicious, moist  pumpkin bread I have ever tasted.  It was such a hit with my family that the first loaf was gone within hours of making it.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This is a wonderful, delicious recipe.  I've been using this recipe for the past 3 years and I love it.  This recipe can be baked as loaves or as a bundt cake.  At Thanksgiving, it's become a tradition with one of my friends that we trade a pumpkin pie loaf for a pumpkin pie. The loaves make wonderful Christmas gifts as well.

I loved this, for the most part. I took others' suggestions, and used 1.5 cups of each white and brown sugar. Next time I'll only use 1 cup of each, as I found these really too sweet, and I never say that. I also put in raisins, because we love raisins, and a couple teaspoons of vanilla. YUMMY!

This bread is absolutely wonderful!  It's so moist.  I don't even like pumpkin, but I love this bread and I will definitely make it again.  I made a double batch and baked two loaves and one bundt pan.  I sent one of the loaves to work with my mom and everyone that tried it liked it.  One guy said that he doesn't even like pumpkin (just like me!), but he thought this was the best bread he'd ever put into his mouth.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  I also added about 1/2 c. dried cranberries, 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, 1 tsp. each of ground cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, and allspice, and 1/2 tsp. maple flavoring (per recipe).  I goofed and used a large can of pumpkin (which is why I had to double the recipe).  I had to improvise...after the first batch, I ran out of oil and used about 3 spoonfuls of vanilla yogurt to compensate.  I also ran out of brown sugar and had to use more white.  After all that I was worried that the bread was ruined, but it turned out perfectly.  The suggested baking time was just right for both the loaves and the bundt cake.

Great, moist bread. I made this bread this afternoon and one loaf is gone. Forget about waiting one day for best flavor! No chance of that in my house. My girlfriend stopped over, tasted the bread and immediately asked for the recipe. Will definitely make again. So nice because I had all the ingredients on hand. Great fall treat!!

Oh my goodness...This is THE ABSOLUTE BEST pumpkin bread my husband and I have ever eaten. My husband, who is not a huge fan of quick breads, could not get enough of this bread. I have to admit that we couldn't wait a full day to try it, but it was so yummy. I can't wait to have some tomorrow, because I know it will only get better! Thanks a lot for this delicious recipe!

This bread turned out moist and delicious. I made a few changes after reading other reviews. Split the sugar in half with white and brown and also added vanilla and extra pumpkin with a little less oil. Next time I'll add pecans. Thanks for a great easy recipe!

Best ever Pumpkin Pie Bread !!! I added 2 cups of chopped walnuts. A little crunch to the outside, very very moist inside. I highly recommend this recipe.

This bakes up really nice and is a beautiful moist loaf of bread.  It does taste a lot like pumpkin pie, but I thought it was very bland.  I made this exactly as the recipe says.  Doubtful I'll make again as there are other amazing pumpkin bread recipes, but I would definitely recommend adding some more spices to this bread.

My family loves this pumpkin bread. It is so easy to make. I usually add chocolate chips to one of the loaves.

I am a moderate, so half apple sauce, half oil. And added the chopped pecans. Freezes well.

I made this recipe to take to a party. I baked it for the time specified in the recipe. Stuck a knife in the center to check it was done and it was still batter in center. It smelled like it was burning. So I turned the oven down to 280 degrees. I let it bake for an additional 15 minutes, checking it every 5 minutes. Finally pulled it out of the oven and the centers of each loaf sunk. Then where I went to turn them out of the pans they both stuck.

So Good!!  Perfect texture and flavor.  After reading reviews, and knowing what my family likes, I replaced 1 C flour with 1 C whole wheat flour, doubled the pumpkin pie spice, reduced sugar to 2.5 C, and replaced the 1 C oil with 1 C of additional pumpkin puree. This made 24 muffins, baked for 25 minutes. 
(I use a heaping 1/3 C of batter per muffin.) This is a keeper!

It was delicious! Instead of all white sugar, I substituted 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar instead. Also, upon reading some of the other reviews, I added additional pumpkin pie spice to really enhance that pumpkin flavor. I also decided to add a little cinnamon & nutmeg, even though I had alway used pumpkin pie spice. Finally, I topped it off with roasted walnuts... which REALLY just took it over the top.

I let it bake for a little under an hour & it came out moist as hell!!!! My boyfriend is a chef & he told me that my pumpkin bread was a million times better than his! Score!!

My very picky granddaughter made this bread. I coached the process so I stressed out that exact measurements are important when cooking. This pumpkin bread has now replaced my 25yr old favorite recipe, it was that good! Do need to reduce temp to 325 after 50 mins to avoid dark browning edges. Thanks

I'll give three stars as it's a good base recipe but I changed it. 

2 tablespoons *freshly ground pumpkin spice mixture that I made*

1 1/2 white sugar
1 1/2 brown sugar

I kept everything else the same

I lost a pumpkin recipe that I used for years, so I tried this one. Even with the addition of more cinnamon (1 Tablespoon) and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/2 cup molasses, plus 1/2 cup of walnuts it still lacked moisture and enough flavor.

Also, it had to be tented within 30 minutes with aluminum foil, rotated half-way through (both pans), and it still was done in 60 minutes, so I'm glad to have kept an eye on it and pulled it 10 minutes before the allotted time.

I will try again by adding 1 teaspoon more salt, plain yogurt (1/2 cup), and 1/2 cup raisins soaked in boiling water and allowed to cool.

With the changes I'll make above, the outcome should be much closer to my original recipe which was dense, moist, had the right balance of flavors and spices--and didn't need anything on top.

I do appreciate having something to go by to prompt my memory so thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used mashed banana to replace the eggs and half brown sugar for the sugar. It baked up beautifully! The bread was moist and delicious! I will definitely make this again.

This recipe turned out perfect the first time I tried it. VERY moist and melt in your mouth delicious! I did cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup. I do wish I would have remembered to use applesauce instead of sugar. I will next time :) By far one of the best recipes I've tried. I had so many great compliments on it, I'll definitely make this again & again.

I added a honey glaze and cooked it a little less. Next time I'll probably do some dark chocolate chips because the recipe is pretty sweet and i feel like the dark chocolate would do a good job offsetting that and add some texture, but overall it was very good. moist, sweet, and makes plenty to feed me and my three hungry roommates.

My family and friends love this bread! I did make changes after I had made it the first time. I cut peeled and steamed 3 granny smith apples and used that rather than the oil. I used 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 white flour, doubled the spices and added both broken walnuts and crasins  (to your liking. We love them so I added a half cup or more of each). I suppose you could call this a new recipe with the changes I have made. I also baked it in a round ring pan, which worked well.

I made the recipe as written except for the pumpkin pie spice. Instead of 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, I added a total of 5 tsps. In one loaf of the bread I added a bag of milk chocolate chips. The other loaf I didn't add anything extra. The loaf without the chips took approximately 10 minutes longer than originally called for but the loaf I put the chocolate chips in took about 20 minutes longer. I also put aluminum foil over the 2 loaves about 40 minutes into the cooking process so they didn't get too brown on top. I will make this recipe again.

Super easy recipe! It was a great one to try with the kiddo. I added alspice, ground ginger, ground cloves and cinnamon to the mix the second time around to make it more flavorful. Definitely one of my favorite bread recipes.

First time I made it, I baked it in loaf pans. It was perfect on the sides but dough in the middle. So I used my extra large muffin pans and made muffins. They were so perfect! So I make these muffins all the time.

I used applesauce instead of oil and added a cup of chopped walnuts and a cup of dried cranberries, also did half white sugar and half light brown.  It is definitely a keeper!  Extremely good, moist and delicious!

This was a great and easy recipe to make! I made 3 medium loaves and they cooked for about 65 minutes. I set the timer for 45 minutes and then added 10 minutes at a time until the toothpick came out clean. It's a little sweet but very spongy and far better than anything you get from a box and just as easy! I'd like a little more pumpkin flavor which is why I am giving it 4 stars and not 5.

I love this recipe! I have made it at least four to five times a year since I found it on here. Over the years I have altered the recipe due to ingredients available at the time. I noticed that when I changed the 3 cups of sugar, to brown sugar or half white half brown. My family likes the taste better!

Love everything about this - I also add chocolate chips, depending on who's eating/their chocolate preferences, and either sprinkle them on top, or mix  up to 1 1/2 cups into the bread.  Always get loads of compliments!

I made this bread yesterday and waited till today to try it like the recipe says. It is very moist and delicious. I added walnuts to mine. If you are looking for a good recipe for pumpkin bread this is the one to try.

We've  doubled up on  the spices.  My 16 yr old son and I have made this recipe many times.  Even if you buy "pure" pumpkin in the store it's not necessarily pumpkin.     We stock up on the smaller higher sugar content  pumpkins in the fall when they're available,  slice in half, seed, and bake on parchment until soft,  then scoop out the pumpkin, purée and store in 1 pound increments in Ziploc bags in the freezer

Our guests and my husband loved this bread. I  used 1 c sugar plus 1 cup Splenda, added 1/4 c powdered milk  ( I'm diabetic) and cut back the oil to 3/4 c and increased the pumpkin pie spice to 4 teaspoons . This is a keeper for us. May try adding raisins or walnuts next time

Only rated 4 stars because I modified it. I decreased sugar to one cup and substituted 1 cup pureed raisins. I also used apple sauce instead of oil. It came out very tasty and moist, and was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I'll definitely make it again!

Made this 2 weeks ago with the intention of eating one and freezing one. As I type this I have 2 more loaves in the oven because we ate both the last time, they were so good!!

I have cut the sugar down to 2 cups on the ones I am baking now but other than that I have followed the recipe.

Looking forward to having these on hand over the Christmas season.

The cases it good, just a little heavy. I thought perhaps it was my ingredients, so I bought fresh ingredients, and same results. Never raised. It was a great sticky pudding bread:)

I only made one loaf  because I had half a can of pumpkin pie mix and half a can of evaporated  milk (in place of the water)  from a previous  pie  that I made.  I also added a half cup of chopped toasted pecans,  some extra ginger powder to taste.  It was delicious.  So yummy,  moist and amazing. We ate half of it immediately... And remembered we had to share with the rest of the family... Lol.. Very yummy and good recipe.

This is my go to recipe for pumpkin bread.  I half the oil and use half applesauce, also cut sugar by 1/3.  I also use brown sugar and like to add mini chocolate chips and walnuts.  It is delicious!

I made this 2 years ago. My family and friends loved it. I Tweaked some things ( just a little bit) but for the most part came out great. Yes the temp for the loafs had to stay in longer, but I also did small muffins for quick breakfast and snack options.  I'm back at it again this year again. ( my mother passed away last year so I didn't feel like baking with out her)

I love this recipe! It is moist and tastes like pumpkin pie. I changed the cup of oil, instead using 1/3 cup applesauce, and 2/3 cup oil. I also dropped a cup of sugar, using only 2 cups, and added about 1/3 cup of chocolate chunks. Overall, a fantastic recipe. I am totally going to send this to my friends! 
(P.S. These make GREAT mini-muffins!)

I've made this recipe several times now and with great results, as written, although I use 2 cups of fresh pumpkin which I had pureed, bagged and frozen after Hallowe'en . This latest time, I decided to add 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup minced orange peel (the peel of one clementine orange was perfect), and I cut back a little bit on the sugar. Delicious !

I made this pumpkin bread just as the recipe indicates. I used two 9 x 5 glass dishes but on one I put pumpkin seeds on the top. It got rave reviews. In fact on friend said it was very very close to Starbucks. :)

This is a great recipe!  I replaced half of the oil with apple sauce and it was so very moist!  This is a keeper! Oh!  I greased the bread pan and then added sugar.  It added a nice texture to the outside.

I absolutely love this recipe!! I have been making this same recipe for 3 years now. Instead of canned pumpkin puree i cook my own pumpkins and i also add 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and 1/2 tsp of allspice.

I didn't have 2 loaf pans so i made one a loaf and the other i made into small cupcakes, that I only cooked for about 30 minutes and topped with a simple cream cheese frosting. My lady loved the cupcakes. the rest of the recipe was followed as it was listed.

Too sweet. Cut down the sugar by 1/3. Replace the oil with applesauce. Use whole wheat flour for half the flour. Kids liked it.

I made this yesterday and it was so good! I drizzled a cream cheese glaze over the top and it was delicious! So delicious in fact, that I have to make more today because we ate it all haha! I followed the directions exactly (with the exception of the glaze I added). This time I'm going to add some pecans because I feel it needs a little something special, though it is delicious as is.

I made this wonderful pumpkin bread! Didn't have any pumpkin spice, I substituted 2 tsp allspice, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Turned out perfect!  Also I only have 1 loaf pan, so I made muffins with the rest. Those only had to bake for 20 minutes.

This was a very easy recipe. I made it for work and only wanted one loaf, so I halved all the ingredients but the pumpkin and left out the oil. It was very moist and tasty and low-fat! It took all of 70 min to bake but it was worth it. I wrapped it up in plastic wrap like it said but not a full day; it was about 14 hours.

I was kind of disappointed with how bland this bread was.  I was hoping with the comments that I had read that it would be awesome but it wasn't.  It was definitely moist.  I used part oil and part apple sauce.  I was kind of worried about the amount of sugar in the recipe and did not want to substitute for the sugar for fear that it would affect the taste.  You want pumpkin pie bread to taste as awesome as pumpkin pie!!

Made this for Christmas morning breakfast. It was great. As others mentioned, I substituted half of the oil with applesauce. I baked it on Christmas Eve, and the next morning, it was fantastic. The kids and husband loved it!

My family couldn't stop eating it! One recipe made two eight inch rounds, and one loaf. The only change I did was I didn't have pumpkin spice, so I added one tsp each of: nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and then half a teaspoon of allspice. I also cooked all three for just thirty minutes and it came out perfectly! Thank you for the recipe!!

Loved it but made a small change....
After reading the reviews that said it needed more spices, I decided to try it with the spices doubled.  I decided to try 6 tsps of pumpkin pie spice instead of 3.  Then, grrr, I realized I was out of pie spice!  Instead, I used 1 tsp ground cloves, 1 tsp ginger, 2 tsps cinnamon, and 2 tsps nutmeg.  It turned out great!! Everyone loved it!  Oh,and I sprinkled the tops with a little cinnamon sugar.  This was my first time making it, so I only wanted to make one change at a time.  Next time, I plan to try it with applesauce instead of oil.  Oh, and we are high altitude, so I threw in a little extra flour.  All in all, it turned out great! (-:

Please listen to others and use 1 1/2 the amount of the spices and add raisins. It's a good basic recipe, but it needs those additions.  Also, after reading reviews and seeing the picture, I didn't want my bread overly browned and hard on the top.  I put it in for 1/2 hour, then loosely covered it with foil, allowing room to rise.  It was still very light when I put the foil on; and I left one end opened and lifted up a bit.  I reset the timer back to cook another 30 minutes. It came out perfect this way!  The foil helps the inside to cook without burning the top.  It still browned without going too far.  Mine was great at 1 hour total.

Glad I found this recipe when I searched a recipe. I had two large container that were at least 8 cups of fresh pumpkin puree. I made it on this past sunday and made 12 loaves of bread with 4 different flavors. Yes I did tweaked on the last two batches of the pumpkin puree. First batch with 3 wtih canola oil and water, the second i used other suggestion with applesauce and orange juice with walnuts and cranberies. The third batch of pumpkin bread I made was hit. I was experiementing while i was making a lot. This third one, i used a cup of applesauce, 1.5 white sugar, 1.5 brown sugar,1/4 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup water (instead 1/2 c water) chopped walnuts. the last batch i made 3 cups of pumpkin puree with 5 eggs, a cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup water. i made too many that I did not write it down on each recipe. It was really good. my co-workers want to pay me to make the one with the white sugar and brownsugar. The bread is very moist.

Oh my gosh! This is seriously the best pumpkin bread I've ever had. I've tried out literally dozens of recipes and this one is PERFECT. I just altered it for high altitude by lowering the sugar about a 1/2 cup. Other than that, I followed it. It was seriously delicious! I've made it about 3 times in a month, and every time, both loaves are gone in less than a few hours.

I made it once, and my fiance' could not get enough. He ate it every morning with his coffee. I am making two more for Thanksgiving. I made a couple of tweaks to the recipe. I added orange juice instead of water, added a teaspoon of cinnamon in addition to the pumpkin pie spice, used apple sauce instead of oil, and added a tablespoon of vanilla extract. Yum. I also added chopped pecans and will add some raisins in my next batch. I also added splenda in place of the sugar.

Very good.  The second time I made it I changed things to my taste.  I added fresh pumpkin, fresh cinnamon, fresh nutmeg and added applesauce instead of eggs and some of the veg oil. I only baked for 40 min.  Very moist.

I baked it for 60 mins and it was just a tad overdone, would have liked it to be more moist. Next time I would add chocolate chips and maybe use apple sauce instead of oil.

I followed other reviewers' advice and used half wheat flour. I also cut down the vegetable oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup apple butter. The bread turned out incredibly moist, but I think it could have been sweeter. It didn't have a strong pumpkin flavor to me either.

I followed the suggestions from others to use 1/2 whole wheay flour and 1/2 white flour. I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Instead of using 1 cup of oil and instead of using plain apple sauce I used apple butter. It was wonderful!!! Several people said it needed more spices and that was just what it needed. There was just enough bread left over for breakfast the next day.

This was the closest bread to what I have been trying to find. Very good and moist. I think next time I'll add even more spice to it because I like it spicy.

I used fresh pumpkin (steamed until soft, mashed and then drained) which worked fine without any water, still very moist. I followed someone else's idea and used a bundt cake pan, which worked nicely. I reduced the sugar a bit (more like 2 generous cups) and used an overripe banana and some more pumpkin puree along with oil to make a cup. Not much pumpkin taste, but I will put that down to using up a regular Halloween pumpkin rather than a culinary pumpkin. Might boost the rating if I try again with a tastier pumpkin.

I loved this bread!  It was my first time making pumpkin bread and it turned out beautifully.  I only had aluminum 7x4  loaf pans  and this recipe gave me 3 loaves.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice and used 2 tsps cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and ginger. (I didn't have cloves.)  I also added walnuts.  Like other reviewers suggested, I'll probably cut back a little on the sugar next time.

This has a good flavor and I should have stuck to the recipe exactly. Unfortunately I made muffins instead of a loaf, and they were way too sticky against the paper liners.

This bread is very yummy. I followed the recipe exactly except for reducing the sugar by 1/2 a cup. Next time I will follow the users suggestion of using apple sauce to reduce the sugar and oil amount and also because apple flavor will go well in here.  I only gave it a 4 rating because I personally prefer a bit more of a pumpkin pie flavor so it needs a bit more of those spices to bring it out. It also could use a bit more pumpkin for my taste as well.  Aside from those personal preferences, this recipe was spot on and really cooked in 70 minutes.

This recipe was delicious--I used fresh Pumpkin instead of canned and halved the oil and subbed a 1/2 cup of apple sauce for the remainder of the oil.  It turned out great!

WOW, now that is a GREAT recipe. My family raved over it...and they are right it is better the next day. I used allspice instead of pumpkin spice and I then toast each piece and a nice layer of real butter. Goodness....that is MMMMMM!

I made this recipe but instead placed the batter into muffin pans and baked for approx. 30min until tootpick came out clean.  I feel they could have been more flavorful and moist, not sure what went wrong.

Mmmm, this is great!  As some others have said, it is better the next day.  I cut the sugar by a 1/2 cup and subbed applesauce for half the oil.  My in-laws loved it!  It's especially yummy with pumpkin spice flavored cream cheese spread.

I almost halved the recipe but messed up at the last second so had to make two loaves.  I was SO glad I did because the first one was gone almost immediately!

I did sub in whole wheat white flour, replaced half of the sugar with splenda, and used a cup of applesauce instead of a cup of oil, and it was wonderful and SO moist.

It's great by itself, but I would really recommend spreading it with some mascarpone cheese.

This bread was great!! I defiantly followed other reviewer's suggestions to substitute apple sauce for the oil, and reduced the sugar.  It turned out great!! Especially after a few days in the fridge!!  I wrapped individual slices in plastic wrap and gave it in gift bags.

I love pumpkin and this recipe is really yummy! I even left it in the oven too long and it still turned out nice and moist! The only change I did was to substitute half of the oil for applesauce (I always do this). Not so sure I wanna share this! But it would make a wonderful gift.

WOW this recipe kicks butt!!!  I added raisins and walnuts as a personal preference.  I also covered the loafs for the first 20 minutes.  Thank you sooooo much for sharing

Great recipe! Instead of halving the recipe and using a full can of pumpkin like some other reviewers did, I kept the original amounts but actually used 2 15-oz cans of pumpkin in this batter. And last year Jello came out with pumpkin spice instant pudding mix - I threw that in there too. Poured it into 2 8 1/4 x 4 1/4 loaf pans - it made 2 really good-sized loaves. Moist, delish and pumpkiny! I had to bake them for almost an hour and a half - if you do it this way, start checking at about 65-70 minutes (although it'll probably still be really runny at that point).

This bread is amazing.  One of the best breads I've ever made! Flavor and texture is wonderful!  I used 1/2 c of applesauce and 1/2 c of oil, and whole wheat flour. A++!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe called, and it was terrific.  I thought it was even better the third day.  I made one loaf pan for the recipe, and three mini loaf pans - following the directions of another reviewer - by covering with foil after 20 minutes and baking another 20.  I gave the mini loafs away and kept the large loaf for us, and visitors to enjoy.  We ate it heated up in the microwave with brown sugar cinnamon cream cheese.  Great with a nice hot cup of joe.  Yummy!

This was really good but thought it tasted more like gingerbread than pumpkin.  My 4 year old niece asks for this bread weekly when she comes over.  We will be making this again per her request.

Made this tonight on a whim and so glad I did! I halved the recipe (adding a little more than half of the pumpkin & spice) and made into muffins (made 18) - baked for about 22 minutes, let them cool, then sprinkled with powdered sugar..YUM!

Everyone loved this pumpkin bread. It was so fast and easy. I added about half a cup of chopped praline pecans sprinkled over the top before cooking. If you have a convection oven like I do the cooking time for two loaf pans was 45 to 50 minutes.

This is the most amazing bread.  I have always made banana bread, but this is much more flavorful.  I always double the recipe because we absolutely love it, it is cheaper to buy the large can of pumpkin which is about 30 oz. and the pumpkin loaf freezes beautifully.  Thanks to Tanja for this recipe.

A really yummy cake/bread. A bit sweeter than I thought it would be. Next time I will definitely make it into muffins. I could not find pumpkin spice in the uk so used cinnamon and ginger as recommended by a previous review. Perfect with a topping of cream cheese frosting.

Great Recipe.........very easy to make and was very moist.....Even my 4 yr. old loved it.  I did make a slight change by adding a little more spices.....Along with the Pumpkin Pie Spice - I added Allspice and Nutmeg for a little extra flavor.  Will defintely make again......Thanks for a great recipe.......

These were pretty good. I halved the recipe and got 15 muffins out of the batch. They were very moist, probably because of the pumpkin, but I also used just half oil and half spiced applesauce to lower the fat content. Not bad by any means, but I have found other pumpkin bread recipes that I enjoyed more.

This bread was wonderful but did not taste like pumpkin pie. In fact their really wasn't much of a pumpkin flavor but this could be due to the fact that I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree instead of 15 oz. of packed pumpkin puree. But the bread had a wonderful taste and was very moist.

Ok, so I'm a small chick and I ate one WHOLE loaf to myself in 3 days!  I loved it!  It was very moist and really tasted like pumpkin pie in a bread.  I'm making a bunch for Thanksgiving and sending them to my friends and family.  It was also very easy to make and a good recipe for kids to practice their skills in the kitchen.

Texture was great - nice and moist. Flavor was good, but it didn't tasts like pumpkin pie - just a good pumpkin bread. 50 minutes was enough bake time for me.

This is awesome!  One of my new favorites.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers by using 1/2 brown sugar and coconut milk.  I also used fresh pumpkin, but only had one cup so I blended in one cup of cooked sweet potato.  Delicious.  My 3 year old is picky, and he won't stop eating this.

I liked this, it was very moist. my husband didn't like it because it tasted too much like pumpkin pie he said! Then I told him it was PUMPKIN PIE bread! So, not a hit with him... but I thought it was fine.

This pumpkin bread is moist and tasty, really good! I subbed 1/3 of the sugar with brown sugar and added walnuts, this would be really good with raisins added to the mix as well.
As with almost any quick bread, they always taste better the next day.

Absolutely delicious! And yes, it is better the next day. It is very moist and the flavor is wonderful. I will definitely make it again. Perhaps even as christmas presents.

This was a good usee of extra pumpkin from other recipes, but I would use less oil and more pumpkin. Also, substituting 1/2 brown suger and 1/2 white instead of all white worked well. Thanks for the great recipe.!

I used 3 c. white flour and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. For the spices I used 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I'm glad I did-it had a wonderful flavor.
