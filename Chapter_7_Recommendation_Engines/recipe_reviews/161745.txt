I cut this back to one serving and I used lowfat milk. I took rae's suggestion and added a couple more chopped York peppermint patties (like more than a couple--like six for one serving). This was a nice surprize--great for a special treat when you're having down time on the couch for once. This recipe's a keeper. Just keep in mind you need more candy than the recipe asks for.

good idea, bad result...  tasted like nothing when i was done. literally. not even like milk. smelled awesome, but tasted like zilch.  i added about 1/2 cup of hershey's cocoa powder to the pot of hot chocolate, then dropped a peppermint patty in each individual cup. tasted much better :)

This was okay with some extras. I used 6 1.4 oz patties and when I tasted it there wasn't much flavor, luckily I was able to raid the kids Christmas candy and found some of the small patties. I added 5 of the York .6 oz snowflakes to it. Then it tasted pretty good. Not sure I'll make it again but it was worth trying. Just add in a couple extra patties. Thanks!

Very good!  I whipped up a small batch on the stove and it turned out wonderfully.  A slow cooker would almost seem too easy, but I'm sure the house would smell amazing!  Besides being delicious and simple to prepare, it's also an easy recipe to customize, both for yield and taste.  A very clever use of one of my favorite candies.  Will definitely make again.

Great, easy recipe!! I doubled the amount of patties and added some Hershey chocolate sauce (couple ofvtablespoons, didn't really do an exact measurement). left it in the crockpot and just stirred it up.
