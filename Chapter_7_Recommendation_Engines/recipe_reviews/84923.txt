Great sandwich! It was a nice nice from regular grilled cheese. The only thing I did different was to thin the egg mixture out with a bit of milk and to use light mayo and light Swiss cheese.  Other than that it was perfect with tomato soup.

These were great, we did sub the swiss for provolone and havarti cheese.  Thanks for the post.  I wanted to update this review 08/21/06 only because we tried this for breakfast and used cheddar and american cheese with the ham.  I used the texas toast bread, and added hard eggs to the sandwich.  My husband preferred his open faced with the ham, cheese then an egg over easy to top his off.  Yummy Yummy Yummy.

Awesome! Thanks to Aunt Bev! The only thing I changed, because it didn't need any change is the Swiss, I changed it to baby swiss which is milder.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, I wish I thought of myself! 5 stars!

P.S. My 3 (ages 5-12) very picky Grandchildren, that don't even like grilled cheese, LOVED IT!

Yummy and Easy. I used cheddar (didn't have swiss) and added a bit of milk to the egg. Will make again and again!

These are really great sandwiches! Thanks for the post! However, they aren't for someone on a diet! I didn't have any Italian bread so I just used white bread & added a touch of oregano to the egg mixture. I used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon mustard because I didn't have any & I cut it down to only 1 tsp.

This is a great sandwich. Very filling. I used whole  grain white instead of the Italian, since I didn't have that on hand. Wow, filling!

I noticed this as I was doing the photo voting and thought it sounded really good for lunch, therefore, I made it right away. I loved the flavor of this recipe. I don't know if the egg wash is absolutely necessary and I may omit it next time just to see the difference. I will be making this again often for my lunch. It was a nice way of doing something different with my usual ham and cheese sandwich.

These were okay.  They cooked beautifully and the egg didn't lend any flavor which I was worried about.  Maybe with a different cheese to give it more of a pop it would be better.  I might try them again with cheddar but as was I found them kind of blah.

Excellent!
Another twist that an old friend used to make for me I would have considered glorified AND sinful... load just about every kind of white cheese imagineable on the bread in addition to tomatoes.  Cream cheese, mozzarella, provolone, swiss, you name it.  Simply delicious!

I made this today for my lunch, while the kids had English Muffin Pizzas again. I thought there was sliced ham in the fridge for this sandwich, but I was mistaken. That was the only thing I had to omit. Other than that, I made it just like specified. It was filling. Different from typical grilled cheese. Next time, I'll be sure there's ham in the fridge, and I might add some sliced onion, too.

Very good recipe, although I changed a bit. When I made this for my little sister, I added pickles and used american cheese instead of swiss. She said it was the best grilled cheese she's ever had.

I love this sandwich but with a different twist..I used milk & egg to dip the whole sandwich and I did not use mayo or mustard but had a side of maple syrup to dip the sandwich in. With these changes definitely 5 stars!!

A++++mazing! This was a great sandwich. I layered mine with swiss cheese, honey ham, american cheese and chicken.  I dipped the sandwich in the egg as instructed but didn't really taste it.   Either way my boyfriend and I loved it!

I liked this dipped in the egg and cooked. I didn't like the mayo-mustard thing. I used plain white bread and american cheese. I did add a splash of milk to the egg.

This is a great twist on a classic!  We all enjoyed it.  I decided to only used one slice of swiss and shaved ham to save on the calories a bit and it was fine! Great recipe!

Fast, easy, delicious, and filling! I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't have any mustard. Since I'm not a great fan of mustard anyway, it was still outstanding! Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmmmm, I loved this! The salty ham and tangy mustard go together so well. This would be good even without the egg. Thanks!

Delish as written!  Hard to believe how you can make a grilled cheese sandwich better, but Aunt Bev has done it!  Thanks for sharing!  Think I may have to make it again for lunch today!

Wow! I just made this dish and honestly was amazed. The mustard and mayo really worked well along with the incorporation of the eggs as well.

Very nice, and did enjoy it, what is slightly confusing is, it's called a grilled sandwich  when in fact it is a fried sandwich! Rate at top marks anyway.??????
