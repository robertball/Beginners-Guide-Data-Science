Heavenly!  This was Sunday brunch.  I didn't get a photo because I set a plate aside for pictures and someone got to them while I was clearing up!  I would say that says a lot.  After tasting these I am thinking of tripling the apple, cinnamon, butter, bourbon, vanilla mixture and making it into apple crisp.  Thumbs up all around, thank you, Cat!

My poor husband...he is at work and we didn't save any for him!  

I made a double batch and thought it would be enough since it's just me, my 6 year old, my 3 year old, and my 11 month old.  But we loved it and couldn't stop eating!  I used Fuji apples I took off my tree last Fall, chopped and frozen in my freezer.  Because they are really sweet I only put in half the sugar and I let them cook until they caramelized.  It was perfect--we didn't even use any syrup and you know how kids love syrup!  I didn't add any bourbon.  I didn't have oat flour so I used half quick oats and half old fashioned (since I was running out of quick oats.)  I didn't process them or sift anything, which just goes to show how forgiving this recipe is.  I put in exactly the listed amount of bacon but only because that's all I had--I think you can always add more bacon!

A great recipe.  Now I have to whip up another batch for my husband.  Too bad his won't have bacon!

Yum!  Added more bacon; also instead of oat flour, I used regular oatmeal and soaked it in the liquid ingredients for awhile.

I ground oatmeal to make the flour in my food processor as suggested by one reviewer. I doubled the bourbon and reduced the milk just a bit, with great results for the family bourbon lovers.  We didn't need any syrup or honey, as these pancakes are great straight from the pan.  Thanks for the wonderful and different breakfast treat.

One of the best pancake recipes I've ever made. Luckily I had a shooter of bourbon in my fridge from a baby shower a while ago and was able to make this. Super deelish!

Wow! This recipe is amazing! Sweet and delicious. My wife and both loved them. I added a little bit more bourbon to the recipe (1tbsn - apples, 1 tbsn wet ingredients) and used quick oats that I blended into flour; worked great. This is a keeper!

These are really good. Chop the apples very small as there is not a lot of batter. It took just about 1 1/4 apples to make 2 cups so I chopped and sauteed the rest of my second apple like in the first step but with much less cinnamon and a splash of bourbon and put it on top of the pancakes with the syrup.

With Bacon and Bourbon how can you go wrong! My husband really liked these pancakes, his only comment was that they needed more bacon. Just a note.... these are a heavier pancakes with a thick batter.

Really delicious! A little more effort than we usually go to, with apple chopping and bacon cooking, but well worth it. We found that the batter was a bit thinner than we like, so we did add some flour to thicken it up. There is just a hint of the bourbon flavour, and a bit more bacon was added - used two full strips which, when chopped up, yields a bit more than the recipe calls for.

As bacon lovers, I more than doubled the bacon. Next time, my SO wants me to triple it. Yummy and filling!

At first, I would have given this four stars. The bacon seemed lost and I wished I just had it separate on the side. However, leftover the next day, the bacon flavor came out a lot more. I will make these again!

Made these per recipe, no changes. They were really heavy.  I liked the apples, but the bacon was a little strange for me.  I think I'll eliminate the bacon next time and just have it as a side dish.  These pancakes definitely need the maple syrup on top to balance the salty.
