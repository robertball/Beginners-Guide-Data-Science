As always, I changed a few things because I was wanted a thick Quiche and I did succeed.  Easy and very filling. I added more vegetable and extra cheese along with the canned milk with the flour .  I browned my flour just a little bit which helped in the color of the Quiche.  Held up over night and leftover were great.

I ve never made a quiche that calls for baking mix so I was intrigued! Turns out my 87 year old grandmother remembered this type of recipe immediately- back in the day they called them impossible pies. For this recipe I saut√©ed all the veggies together first in order to let the squash release its water. This kept the final product from being soggy. I omitted the oil and only used 1/8th tsp. Cayenne. Next time I will use less Italian seasoning but I really liked the use of paprika. Of course seasoning is a personal thing but I will use this recipe again and play around with it! Thanks for introducing me to this type of dish:-)

My family really liked this. I added 1/2 tsp pepper which was too much. We enjoy spicy but 1/4 tsp would suffice. We agreed that with all the shredded veggies it was mushy and the dish would benefit from including a standout ingredient or something to give it more body like roasted red pepper added to the cheese on top or broccoli chunks with the egg mixture.

I have made this twice & am trying to perfect it by adding more flavorful ingredients. This time I chopped smoked sausage & cooked it w/the onion & green pepper (using no oil) adding chopped kale the last minute or so. I also added sliced grape tomatoes and sprinkled chopped kale on top--it crisps during baking and adds texture. My hubby liked it better w/the additions & said I should add more chopped smoked sausage next time.

My family really liked the taste of this and I was finally able to get some vegetables into my son! On the other end the quiche tended to be watery it was definitely a LOT of labor and it does not cook completely in the time specified which delayed our dinner a lot! I'm not quite sure how I could have decreased the water in the finished dish but you would definitely need to allow more prep and cooking time. Not one I will repeat again even though it was good as far as taste.

This was really good but I doubled the eggs and cheese.
