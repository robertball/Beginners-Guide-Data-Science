I agree the marinade should soak for two hours. The extra white wine gives the chicken more flavor. Also, something I did was cut little lacerations into the chicken so the sauce could be soaked through.

This recipe has some amazing ingredients, so I thought I'd try it out on my family. It smelled incredibly delicious while cooking, but everyone labeled it as too bland, which was surprising given the large measurements of spices compared to the volume of the sauce. The sauce itself was not too bad, but the chicken had no flavor at all. I only marinated the poultry for one hour -- maybe longer would have helped. I hope some of the others who have saved this recipe enjoy it, because it truly had an interesting combination of ingredients, and the aroma was wonderful. Perhaps my family is too geared towards spicy foods...

It was great! I agree that the chicken was surprisingly bland, but perhaps a longer marinade would have helped. However, the sauce was great over rice and was very filling. Family loved it! Now I am excited to try the blackberry chicken that was her inspiration.

I made this as is. It is a strange smelling recipe... does not have very strong strawberry taste and the cinnamon and nutmeg gave it a not very pleasant colour - dark purple. The taste is ok - the lemon juice and the white wine helped a lot but no strawberry taste at all... good for times when you feel adventurous and have strawberries you may not want to eat fresh.

I made this recipe the way it was written and took the advice of other reviews that it was on the bland side by adding extra Strawberries.  This helped it a bit but it was still on the bland side.  This was unusual since it had a WONDERFUL smell as it was cooking.

As written this is a 4 star recipe, with a few changes like salt and pepper the meat before marinating it can be a 5 worthy of company. I used fresh rosemary and marinated for 5 hrs. I browned the meat on the stove top made the marinade as directed replaced the meat covered and placed in a 350 oven for 20 minutes until meat reached 145. I let it set 5ish minutes before cutting. My meat was tender juicy and absolutely full of flavor, there was nothing bland about this dish as I made it.
