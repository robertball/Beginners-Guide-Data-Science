I made it three times. First was as the recipe states, second was with 1 c. coconut milk and 2 c. half and half. Then the third time I did it, it came out the best! I used 1 whole can coconut cream, then enough half and half to make it all up to three cups. I used three egg yolks instead of 2 eggs. I used a whole package of the frozen coconut in the pie, and then flaked, sweetened (toasted) coconut on top. I also used 1/2 c. corn starch in place of the flour.

My family raved about this and it is going in my tried and true recipe book!!

If you're searching for a perfect coconut cream pie recipe, end your search with this one!  But, make the following changes: I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk (makes all the difference) and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream (I didn't have half-n-half).  Also, eliminated the flour and used 1/3 cup corn starch.  I turned up the heat on the stove between low and medium, and only took about 20 minutes or so to thicken.  I did not toast the coconut that went inside the pie, but did toast the coconut on top.  Also, made homemade whipped cream (carton whipping cream, 2 tbls. confectioners sugar, 1 teas. vanilla).  Very nice texture.  Firmness is just right.

What a wonderful coconut cream pie.  I tested this recipe out tonight because my girlfriend wants one for her birthday.  If this didn't work out, I was going to head to Bob Evans to get her pie since, while I find their food lacking, they do a fantastic coconut pie.  I followed some of the advice in previous reviews and used 1 1/2 cups half-n-half and 1 1/2 cups canned coconut milk.  I also used the 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour and made my own whipped cream.  I also used fresh coconut (from the freezer section) instead of that nasty dried, sweetened stuff in the cake mix aisle.  I made the custard in the microwave and it was thick, smooth, creamy, and beautiful in just 5 minutes.  I pulled the bowl out after each minute to stir the mixture with a whisk.  SO easy and SO good.  No need for coconut extract if you use fresh coconut and coconut milk.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow. This is to-die-for. Based on other reviews I made the following changes: 1 1/2 cups coconut milk, 1 1/2 cups half-and-half, used cornstarch instead, subbed defrosted, unsweetened, coconut flakes, and whipped my own cream and added a little coconut extract and powdered sugar to it. My family ooh-ed and ahh-ed over this pie.Today is my second time making this pie. I noticed that previous pie never quite firmed up as much as I would've liked. I added 1 extra yolk and just shy of 1/2 cup cornstarch in the custard. Worked like a charm!

This pie was amazing! I made this yesterday for my brother's 25th wedding anniversary and my son, who at first turned his nose up at it (coconut-yuck!), asked me to make another one as soon as we got home. I will definitely make it for Thanksgiving and any other time I can find an excuse to make one. I did as others suggested and used 1-1/2 c.coconut milk and 1-1/2 c.half 'half & half'instead of 3 cups H&H, 1/3 c. cornstarch instead of flour and I used coconut extract instead of vanilla. I didn't have enough sugar so I had to use 1/4 c. Splenda but it didn't affect the taste at all. I also took one reviewers advice and cooked it in the microwave. Do not be afraid to do this! It saved so much time and turned out fabulous. Five minutes in the micro, stirring after every minute - perfect! Lastly, I beg you - please, please, please - do not put cool whip on this wonderful pie. If you are going to go to all the trouble of making a coconut pie from scratch, please take the time to whip up real whipped cream. It is so worth it. You will love this pie.

This is 'the one'.  It tastes like the ones you get at restaurants, but fresher, more decadent and sublimely rich.  In my version that I'll be keeping in my recipe book I halved the half-and-half and used 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk instead, which brings out that coconut flavor for sure.  I used flour instead of the 'suggestions' of using cornstarch with great results.  I also made my own whipped topping (1 carton of whipping cream, 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar, and 1 teaspoon coconut extract.)  Also made the very simple 'Graham Cracker Crust' submitted by Janaan Cunningham here on Allrecipes.  Honestly the whole pie took about an hour to make, with very little effort.  It will impress for sure!  My tip for making the filling, think of Dory from 'Finding Nemo', just keep whisking, just keep whisking.  It will be about 25 minutes, but you'll feel it start to thicken up.  Once it comes to a boil on low heat (once the bubbles break through, and it will take a little bit) its done.  It should be thick like thick pudding.  Just keep whisking!  I should add I used a regular pot to cook it in and after pouring into the crust, it sat in the fridge overnight before I put the topping on.

This is a truly superior "cream" pie recipe.  I whipped it up today in no time at all with a refrigerated Pillsbury crust, which I feel is the best tasting crust, bar none.  My changes were, like others, I used 1/3 c corn starch instead of flour, I used 1 tsp coconut extract for more coconut taste, and cooked it on a double boiler, whisking instead of stirring with a spoon, made it faster and no burning or scorching!  It only took about 15 minutes and thickened quickly.  My husband, who is a coconut pie connoisseur, loved it and said it was better or equal to any pie anywhere and that included Bob Evans and the Das Essenhaus Amish restaurant in Middlebury, Indiana his two favorite places for coconut pie.  If I have made pie as good as the Amish I feel I have really accomplished something.  I used just regular coconut for the filling and toasted for the top.  Want a different flavor?  I used the same recipe, left out all the coconut, and coconut extract, added 4 oz of good quality melted semi sweet chocolate, (I used Ghirradelli) for a lovely chocolate pie.  I am making three of these pies for Thanksgiving instead of buying them as I usually do.  Well done, Carol!!!

I made this pie for my mom's birthday, and my whole family loved it! It has a natural, not too sweet flavour. I loved it! I made the following changes like other reviewers suggested: 1 1/2 cups coconut milk, 1 1/2 cups cream, and 1/4 corn starch, 1/4 flour. It  is more work than just using a Jello recipe, but it's definitely worth it! I would consider myself a beginner, so it's not the most difficult pie to make if it turned out perfectly for me! One thing I should mention is that it makes too much filling. I used a Tenderflake 9" deep dish crust and I had a bit of filling left over.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars! I'm a Brit and had never even tasted coconut cream pie before, let alone made one! My step-daughter wanted one for her birthday and - never one to shy from a challenge - I checked here for a recipe I thought I could go with. Having read the wonderful reviews, I amended the recipe as follows: I used a whole can of coconut milk and made it up to 3 cups with 1/2 and 1/2. I used 2 eggs plus a yolk, replaced the flour with 1/2 cup of cornstarch and followed TRISKELE's advise and microwaved the custard (5 1/2 minutes, whisking well after every minute - so easy and worked like a dream.) I only toasted the coconut for the topping (couldn't find the frozen stuff so I used the bagged kind) and I agree with Julie - don't spoil this wonderful pie with CoolWhip! Get your mixer out and whip up a carton of cream with 2 tbls of confectioners sugar and a teaspoon of the best vanilla essence you can find. CRXGURL said there's a bit too much custard so I used a 10" graham cracker crust - the custard quantity was perfect and we got an extra slice of pie! My step-daughter was over the moon and I'm sure I'll be making this many more times in the future. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This pie does not set. You can chill it overnight. Take the advice of the reviews and change it...completely! Huge disappointment after much effort

My husband said this is the best pie I have ever made!  (and I've made a lot of pies).  As per other reviewers' suggestions, I made the following changes:  1) Use on can of coconut milk (2 cups) and one cup of half and half. 2) Use 1/2 cup of corn starch instead of the flour 3) Use three egg yolks instead of two eggs 4) Use untoasted coconut for the filling, and use toasted only for the top 5) Made homemade whipped cream for the top.  If you are making this and the mixture seems very watery - just give it a chance.  At around the 20 minute mark it thickens very quickly.

This makes a WONDERFUL coconut cream pie.  Holds up very nicely and serves well which is important, runny cream pies drive me crazy.  I have made this pie twice precisely per the recipe and got rave reviews from the folks eating them both times. The only recommendation I'd make is to be certain that you bring the filling to a true boil.  It's tempting because it is getting so thick to just call it, but boiling it all the way is what makes the substance of the filling and allows it to set so nicely and stay presentable when serving.  Second, toast the coconut first, BEFORE you start the filling so that you are not doing two things at once.  You have to watch that coconut and that filling like a HAWK to make sure you don't burn either.  Final parting words-this is a simple recipe and makes an elegant and scrumptious dessert.  Highly recommend.

I was looking for a coconut cream  recipe that was as good as I had tasted in a particular restaurant.  I also wanted the custard filling to be versatile enough to be used in other variations...ie banana cream..etc.  This recipe was definitely it.  I did what other reviewer's suggested and substituted the half and half with 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk.  I only toasted the coconut I used on top and used 1/2 cup of cornstarch instead of the flour.  I also added 1/4 tsp of coconut extract instead of the vanilla.  It was perfect.  Then I made this again to try the custard  filling done as a banana cream.  That time I used 3 cups of heavy cream instead of half and half.  I still substituted the cornstarch for the flour and used 1/2 tsp of banana extract instead of the vanilla.  In stead of the coconut I used 3 bananas.   I did a couple layers of the sliced banana on the bottom of the pie shell then half the custard then another thin layer of sliced banana then the rest of the custard.   As I layered the custard on top of the banana I made sure it was going into all the little crevices inbetween the slices.  I topped both of the pies with whipped cream I made myself.  I can honestly say it was the best banana cream pie I have ever tasted.  My family and I absolutely loved both pies.  Oh and just as a side note....I found that heating the custard on low while stirring constantly was just too time consuming so I turned it up to med and it worked just fine

Another fabulous recipe - Delicious and full of coconut flavor. Adding coconut extract gives it a richer flavor, as well as toasting the coconut. Also, I used flour as a thickening agent. Corn starch is good, but it's too much like jello. It should be creamy, and the only way to achieve that is to use a flour thickener.

I first made this pie September 12, 2012 and this is a second, follow up review of sorts. As of today, December 22, 2012 - I have gained 12 pounds and completed my 50'th "Old Fashioned Coconut Creme Pie"!  It's that good and I now make these two at a time!  A little overboard, yes - but once you make this pie you will understand why.  Read through the other reviews and try some of the substitutions others have made.  Me, I use half heavy whipping cream / half whole milk in place of the half and half. (Yes, it's basically the same thing.) I also use an extra tsp of vanilla along with double the coconut(2 1/2 cups coconut actually) simply because I like them both.  I also make my own whipped cream instead of using cool whip but cool whip works almost as well if you don't want to go through the trouble.  This is a very flexible recipe, very easy to make and best of all it tastes AWESOME!  Just be sure to continuously stir while cooking since it is a custard type filling and will easily burn on the bottom. The picture I have included with my review is of the 38'th and 39'th pies that I made that I used to tease my wife with while she was at work.  This recipe makes an excellent pie and I almost guarantee it will become one of your favorites!

I made this twice, first was as the recipe states. The second time was with one 14oz can of coconut milk which is 1 3/4 c. plus 1 1/4 c. half and half to equal the 3 cups. I added 2 eggs and used 1/3 c. cornstarch in place of the flour. I used 1 tsp. coconut extract instead of vanilla. I added 3/4 c. toasted coconut in the pie. I topped the pie with real whipped cream and sprinkled 1/4 c. toasted coconut on top. This pie came out absolutely perfect, tasted wonderful. This is the best coconut cream pie I have ever made. I have to rate this 5 stars with the changes. Debra

Yum!  I thought this was fantastic.  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and used a full can of coconut cream (almost two cups) plus one cup of half and half, one more yolk, and 1/4 c flour and 1/4 c cornstarch.  It thickened up within just a few minutes but I did continue cooking for at least 20 minutes and it set up quite well, not at all runny.  I also used fresh frozen coconut as suggested, and coconut extract instead of vanilla.  With these modifications I thought there was a lot of depth to the coconut flavor without excessive sweetness!  But my mom still characterized the flavor as "subtle."  The coconut flavor comes through from the coconut cream, fresh coconut and extract, and isn't overpowered by sugary ingredients, but I was also making it for my dad, who loves coconut cream pie but doesn't like things that are too sweet.  I also made it with a graham cracker crust (although in hindsight, I wish I would have added a little grated coconut to the crust!).  I topped with fresh whipped cream and toasted coconut (the sweetened kind).  All in all I thought it was great and pretty easy, next time I think I will just try adding coconut to the crust.  Thanks for this recipe! :)

I did the same substitutions as most others - coconut milk and half and half, cornstarch in place of flour.  I also used an entire package of frozen coconut and didn't even bother with toasted coconut on top.  I (nervously) attempted the microwave method.  It worked beautifully!  It was way easier than standing at the stove for half and hour whisking continously - which with a 1 year old helper, just wasn't an option.  For the topping, I made my own whipped cream, but I stabilized it to make it last longer.  I put a tablespoon of cold water into a small microwave safe bowl and sprinkled 1 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin over it.  I let it stand for about a minute.  Then I popped it into the microwave for 30 seconds.  It came out all clear and melty and ready to go.  Then I whipped my cream in my stand mixer.  About 1/2 way through I added my 3 Tbsp powdered sugar, my gelatin, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Continued to whip until the whipped cream held its peaks.  Delicious (and stable) whipped cream!

I did as users suggested and made the recipe with coconut milk, as it turned out my can was 2.5 cups. I did the 5 minute microwave trick and stirred every minute, that was a great suggestion. I also used the suggestion of adding coconut extract to my whipped cream, that was great. I wasn't sure how much whipping cream to use, so I used two cups- it wasn't quite enough. Next time I will use 2.5 or maybe even 3 cups; I think that will be perfect.

One thing I did that I feel made it better was puree the coconut. I did not toast the coconut I put in the custard, instead I put it in the food processor with my sugar and I LOVED it! The texture of coconut bothers me, so I love that trick. I did not sub corn starch for the flour, but I will next time- it didn't set up quite as well as I would have liked.

We loved this- and I will make it again....and again.

Oh MY! What a pie!  Making the following changes will make it a 5 star!
Followed other reviews and used 1.5 cups of coconut milk with 1.5 cups of half and half. (Found it in both the bakery aisle and the ethnic aisles)
 Used 1/3 cup corn starch instead of flour and.  I also cooked it in the micro for the 5 minutes as recommended (stirring every minute) and it turned out flawless!  

I purchased a large graham cracker  pie crust.  (My husbands favorite type of pie crust.) A smaller size will make your pie nice and high and I may try this next time.

Use the true whipping cream...yum!

HINT:  DO let your custard cool before pouring in any pie shell so the pie shell will not become soggy.
Also, wait until the custard is thoroughly cooled before putting the whipped cream on.  This will help your topping to "stand up" longer and not get watery.

Our 35 year old son does not like coconut cream pie.
Well, not until he had this.  He turned to his wife and said, "I want this for my birthday next year." Then he said, "Mom, you can make it this this year for Thanksgiving".
OH MY!  WHAT A PIE!
DO CHANGE THE FLOUR FOR CORNSTARCH AND USE COCONUT MILK OR CREAM FOR HALF THE LIQUID.

This is a great recipe.  Follow the directions exactly.  When preparing the filling, make sure that it comes to a boil.  Not just a couple of little bubbles, a boil.  Remove from heat add the coconut and extract and definitely let it set up in the refrigerator...overnight would be best.  I like to use whipped cream, not cool whip.  If you find a good recipe for whipped cream that will stand up overnight or longer, that would be best.  I have not invested any time looking for this however it would be a good compliment to this recipe.  I am not a cook, but mine came out great...many times (except for one).  I did not bring the filling to a rolling boil (it will be thick).  Becasue of this it was runny.  If you bring it to a boil, it will be thick.  I have also converted this recipe to a banana cream pie as well, it came out good, however coconut is better.

Good luck.

I have tried a couple of coconut cream pie recipes from this site and from cookbooks.  This one is BY FAR the best!   I used the recipe exactly as written - it was easy, and came out perfect.  The custard is sinfully creamy and sweet - wonderful texture.  I do think it's important to stir the mixture constantly as you bring it to a boil, which insures smoothness.   My kids went back for seconds on this!

I took the top reviewer's suggestion and made the filling with half coconut milk, half half-n-half. I also used pure vanilla extract and doubled the amount. We LOVED this pie. I think it could use more flaked coconut but really, that's being nitpicky. Sososososo very good.

I, personally, am not a coconut fan, so I did not eat any of this pie.  My parents are big coconut pie fans and deemed this "the best coconut pie i ever ate"  (and they're not real free w/cooking praise, so this is big time!).  I followed many tip reviewers suggestions and used a can of coconut milk and a little over a cup of fat free half and half instead of all half and half.  I also used 3 egg yolks and between 1/3-1/2 C cornstarch in place of flour.  I subbed coconut extract for vanilla and I made home made whipped cream to top it all off.  I know this is a lot of changes, but I was cooking blind on this one and decided to trust the top reviewers on the *necessary* tweaks.

As written, this recipe did not set.  I had no internet connection and asked a family member to print the highest rated coconut cream pie off allrecipes and did not have a chance to look at the reviews.  I made the recipe exactly as written and it did not set.  After 4 hours I was able to get on the internet and look at the reviews (too late).  So I must rate the recipe as a 1 star and say that the second time I make it with cornstarch only and an extra egg or two plus adding coconut milk it worked.  The recipe as written with flour 1 star, as it was pie soup.

Sooooo good.  I made the mistake of making it for my boyfriend and now have to make it just about weekly.  I've only made it usuing 1/4c flour and 1/4c corn starch and it comes out perfect.  Very dense and very creamy.  Also, I've found that the type of coconut makes a HUGE difference. The generic store brand dosen't cut it.  I also use both toasted ('cause I like the color..toast it in a skillett, it's easier)and un-toasted (I've found that adding the un-toasted seems to make it more coconutie).  Use a double boiler,  it will thicken in half the time and you don't have to worry about it burning.

My dad and I love coconut cream pie so I tried this one out - I give this recipe 5 stars with the following changes: took the advice of others on some of the changes, and did a little modifying of my own :) Ingredients used: 1/3 c of coconut for the topping (toasted), and 1 & 3/4 c coconut for the filling (untoasted), 1 & 1/2 c heavy cream, 1 & 1/2 c coconut milk (used heavy cream & coconut milk instead of half & half), 2 eggs beaten, 3/4 c white sugar, 1/3 c cornstarch (instead of flour), 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 - 9in, pie shell, baked.
For the whipped topping, used 1 pint of heavy whipping cream, 3 tbsp powdered sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla - mix with mixer until peaks form (about 5 minutes). Sprinkle with the 1/3 c toasted coconut. Definitely worth making the homemade whipped topping! Use this recipe all the time.

this is the best I'v tried so far, but I did change a few things. I use 3 egg yolks instead of 2 whole eggs, I can of coconut milk and then enough heavy cream to make 3c when combined with the coconut milk.  I also replace the flour with corn starch and made my own whipped topping with heavy cream, 1Tlbs of sugar and 1tsp of coconut extract.  The best thing I add was a thin layer of chocolate ganache in between the crust and filing.  i can't put into words how great this pie was.  the ganache was 1 cup dark chocolate chips with 1/2 cup of heavy cream melted over a double boiler

I followed others recommendations and did the following.   1 1/2 C half & half, 1 1/2 C coconut milk, 1/2 C corn starch, an extra egg yolk, 3/4 cup unsweetened coconut, 1/4 toasted sweet coconut for top.  Used real whipped cream.  Excellent pie!  It is not too sweet but just perfect.  I may try using 1 cup coconut cream next time instead of 1 1/2 c coconut milk to add a little but more sweatness.

I have made this several times and it has become a family favorite. I have used skim milk or coconut milk in place of the half and half. The coconut milk makes it more rich but the skim milk certainly taste wonderful also. I have also made it with flour or corn starch and it does not make a diffrence. I do recommend cooking the filling in the microwave and stiring it ever minute or so. Much, much easier this way.

I used the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe from this site, and made two versions: one exactly as stated in the recipe and one that seemed more appealing to my senses, using cornstarch, replacing half the half-and-half with coconut milk, and leaving the coconut that's inside the pie un-toasted, as stated by other reviewers. Both were excellent! While the later was easily among the best coconut cream pies we've ever had, the pie made exactly as stated in the recipe was excellent in its own right, reminding me of Thanksgiving at Grandma's house, watching her make the custard for her much anticipated Coconut Cream Pie!

I made exactly as stated and it was awesome. It was dubbed the best coconut pie at the church potluck and there were about 5 cocount pies brrought! Was even asked for the recipe. It's a keeper. I've now made this recipe more times than I can count. If I don't have half and half I sub with a can of evaporated milk and it is still yummy. I do prefer using the flour over the cornstarch. The texture is much better. If your pie didn't set, you properly didn't let it cook long enough. :o)

Made this as one of 3 pies for Easter. This was the first to go. It is fantastic!. I took the suggestion from others and subbed 1/2 coconut milk for the 1/2 and 1/2. The only other change was I made fresh whipped cream. What a shame it would be to go through the trouble of a scratch pie, only to top it with fake whipped cream. This recipe is a winner!

Absolutely the best cream pie every! My 10 year old daughter wanted to make this and we were all amazed at how GOOD this was. Couple changes we made based on other reviews were...using a whole can of coconut cream then adding enough half and half to make 3 cups, 3 egg yolks, cornstarch instead of flour, and only toasted the coconut for the top, added about half a bag of coconut *can never have too much right??*  ;)  Not a bite left at the end of the night!!

I've never had CC pie, but it's my mother-in-law's favorite, so I tried my hand at it. She said this was "the best Coconut Cream Pie she has EVER HAD". I was  proud of myself (this is the 1st pie I have ever made from scratch) and so thankful for this recipe. I followed other reviewers advice and used 1 1/2 cups half-n-half and 1 1/2 cups canned coconut milk. I also used the 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour and made my own whipped cream (1 c heavy cream, 1 tablespoon conf sugar, 1 tsp vanilla). I also used fresh coconut (from the freezer section) as recommended by another reviewer. Added toasted coconut to the top. Beautiful!

The soft creamy texture of this pie was 5 stars but I can't believe more reviewers didn't find all that flour a turn off. Even after bringing the pudding to a full boil, I could still taste the flour. This pie really doesn't have a lot of coconut flavor (I added coconut extract and a tablespoon of butter with the vanilla, too) and it isn't very sweet. After tasting the pudding I threw some sliced bananas in the bottom of the pie crust and I put extra sugar in the whipping cream for the topping. Exra toasted coconut helped also. My company raved about how good it was but I'll keep experimenting. Next time I'll cut back on the flour (or try cornstarch) and add an extra egg, and try using coconut milk for some of the 1/2 & 1/2. I used a plain baked pie crust rather than the graham cracker crust (might have affected the overall sweetness) ... just a preference and more traditional for an "Old Fashioned" Pie.

Made this for the 4th of July. I took other suggestion and I subbed 1.5 cup of the half and half for canned coconut milk. I also subbed the flour with 1/3 cup corn starch. I used fresh coconut from the organic self serve bin. It was DELISH! My whole family loved it. It was amazingly easy and quick to make! I will definitely find a reason to make this pie again, very soon!

Ok I made this Pie for my husband, I too used 1/3 cup of cornstarch INSTEAD of the flour, used the 1 1/2 cups of half n half, 1 1/2 cups coconut milk, 1 teaspoon coconut extract, had to use the bakers coconut since I couldn't find the frozen in my stores here, I also added 3/4 cup of Diamond chopped pecans, and OMG you talk about delicious.. I did the 5 minutes(my new favorite way) in the microwave, stirring every minute like suggested. I also followed another users advice and did my chocolate recipe the same way leaving out the coconut, and using vanilla extract. I did the chocolate version in the microwave for 6 minutes, stirring every minute, and it too has 3/4 cup of pecans.... Yesssss, we love pecans. you will too in these recipes.    for the Coconut pie I made homemade whipped cream with 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 tablespoon coconut extract.....

Delicious!  I followed the suggestion that others made regarding using coconut milk + enough 1/2 & 1/2 to make 3 cups.  I also made my own whipped cream using 8 oz whipping cream, 2 tbl powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp coconut extract.  (This was my first attempt and turned out quite well)  Other than this, I followed the directions as stated.  It made the perfect amt from my 9" pie shell.  It was refrigerated for approx 3-4 hours before serving but I found it to be even better the next day!  Another great addition to my recipe book!

this is the second time i made this pie. i finially found coconut milk in my store so i used that with the half and half (huge difference!) and instead of boiling it on the stove i also microwaved it. exactly 7 min stirring every min. it was almost too easy this time! i used 1 tsp vanilla AND 1 tsp of coconut extract for added flavor. it doesnt get any better than this!!

Made this 3 times so far, it's thick texture is what makes it so good.  Easy to make! Don't change a thing!! Except after awhile of stirring, once it gets warm, I turn the heat up gradually to a bit more than med. to speed things up, it boils quickly after that, comes out perfect. One user said she stirred for 45 minutes!  That's too long for this mommy!

This is delicious! I did not make any changes to it. I followed the directions exactly and I made sure the mixture on the stove top really thickened up. I have made this 3 times already. The first time I did what everyone said, to use cornstarch instead of flour. It was horrible and chalky and disgusting. I think it's perfect the way it is.

Coconut Cream Pie is one of my faves,and this one yummy recipe! As some reviews suggested I did use coconut milk 1 1/2 C and 1 1/2 C half&half. I got whipping cream to make real whipped cream for topping ,but this pie was so good, it was eaten before the whipped cream got made :) I will be making this again and again

I've made this as written & following some other reviewers' tips.  DO use the whole can of coconut milk since it's easier to use up leftover half & half than leftover coconut milk.  DO use 2 WHOLE eggs, not 3 yolks as some have suggested as the resulting "custard" flavor overpowers the coconut flavor.  DO use real whipped cream.  AND, when I increased the toasted coconut IN the pie, I got some complaints about the texture being less creamy but they loved a little extra on the top.

I also made one where I cut the prep time in half by using a graham cracker crust & frozen whipped topping.  I liked it better but I was the only one.

Everyone else's #1 choice was the pie that was made as written except for the whole can of coconut milk plus half & half to make 3 cups & real whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping.

Before anyone throws eggs at me for the rating, I'm rating this based on the recipe as written. My first review of this was too long, so I've "shortened" it.  :)  Basically, the three star rating is a between rating for the ingredients and the directions. The directions are where this recipe is lacking. You will certainly need to follow other great reviewers' suggestions for the directions on how to cook the filling and what it's consistancy should be, because the current directions are too vague for an individual to follow who are not familiar with making these kinds of pies. The directions as written would have definitely caused for some runny pies. As for the ingredients, not too bad at all, but I think the modifications others have suggested would have made it better. But I like our coconut pies to be more "coconutty". However, that would practically change the main ingredients of the pie, needing its own recipe. I made the recipe as listed, only adding a little coconut extract and not toasting the coconut in the filling. I'd give it a four star rating for the filling itself. Homemade topping would be better, of course, over store bought, but still good anyways. Worth trying, but definitely follow the directions of reviewers in regards to the filling.  :)  I plan to try the other suggestions, however, and I bet this would be a five star recipe!

I read through a ton of reviews on this pie and took into consideration every single one. That being said, I made the following changes: 1.5 cups half and half with 1.5 cups coconut milk. Subbed cornstarch for the flour, added a tsp of coconut extract. Stirred all until thick which honestly didnt take long with the cornstarch. Refrig overnight. Added .5 tsp coconut extract into whipping cream with 2 tblsp powdered sugar. My own tip: shaved dark chocolate over the top of the toasted coconut. Sinfully good.

I'm giving this pie five stars for taste alone, even though mine didn't set up.  We still ate and enjoyed it, even though it was soup. I subbed one cup of coconut milk for one cup of 1/2 and 1/2, but that's the only substitution I made besides whipping my own cream. Edit: I figured out what I did: I didn't cook it long enough.  I should have read you guys' reviews and known to cook it on med-hi for 20 minutes until thick.  The recipe says to bring it to a boil and then remove it from the heat, which took only about 5 minutes!  I thought it would set up overnight, but it didn't.  You must cook it until thick, not just let it come to a boil.

This was a wonderful coconut cream pie, but I did take some advice from other reviewers.  First of all, I used a double boiler over medium heat & stirred with a whisk (it actually does make a big difference in smoothness) & it thickened nicely & didn't burn.  I made two pies, both with 2 cups half & half & 1 cup 2% milk, & that was definitely the right decision.  But for one pie I used 1/4 cup flour & 1/4 cup cornstarch, & it was pretty good still, but you could definitely taste raw flour.  I can't even imagine using just 1/2 cup of flour.  For the second pie I used 1/3 cup cornstarch--no flour at all, & it was SOOOO MUCH BETTER.  I also used coconut extract instead of vanilla, just to get more of a coconut-y flavor.  And yes--use deep dish pie shells.  This is a very good recipe, but take my advice & LEAVE OUT THE FLOUR!!!  You'll be glad you did.

Followed the advice of the other readers by using 1/2 cornstarch 1/2 flour. Turned out very watery and pudding like, even after I let it sit overnight! I think the recipe should have called for all cornstarch. Also as it was a little on the rich side, I would probably use 1/2 milk, 1/2 cream if I were to make this again.

There are a few flaws....
1. No coconut milk = minimal coconut flavor
2. "whipped topping" = chemical and nutritional nightmare. This stuff has no place in the kitchen and it's odd flavor affects this pie. It would seem that shortcuts like this result in a lesser quality pie.

Ohhh, this pie is to die for!!  Tastes just like the ones I remember my late mama and mawmaw making.  I did make a few modifications that didn't sacrifice the overall result - using 3 egg yolks instead of the 2 whole eggs, fat-free half-and-half, doubled the vanilla, added 2 T. butter, and used an 8-oz tub Cool Whip on top.  To speed up the cooling process of the filling, I placed the pot in a sink of ice and water, whisking occasionally, until it was cool and thick, about 10 minutes. I only toasted the coconut for the top of the pie.  Dessert, you betcha!

waaaaay too sweet and i didn't even add the cream on top! and i was so excited about it too, what a disappointment. can't imagine anyone eating a whole slice, not to mention diabetics and kids(imagine the sugar rush, wow!). i thought it may have been my mistake for using sweetened coconut but it wasn't. not worth the calories, i won't go by only good ratings from now on.

Hands down the best recipe for coconut cream pie I've ever used.  Whoever thought to use a combination of coconut milk and half-and-half was brilliant. I followed the other suggestions as well - replaced the flour with corn starch and used 3 egg yolks rather than two eggs.  The custard was perfect.

not sure this is a fair review since my rating is w/a couple changes.  FIRST, DO use CORNSTARCH instead of flour!!!  I've made it both ways and it doesn't set up right with flour.  Also DO use coconut milk as others have suggested.  I use the whole can of coconut milk and however much 1/2 & 1/2 is needed after to total 3 cups of liquid.  I get rave reviews on this pie with these changes!  Oh and MAKE YOUR OWN WHIPPED CREAM-it's so easy!

Very good! It didn't set as well as I had hoped, but served the purpose. I think next time I will add 1 more egg. I made it late last night before bed for my fiance to enjoy when he got home from work this morning (midnight shift). When I got up, half the pie was already gone! He's a very picky man, and likes the basics, nothing fancy. For him to like it, it had to be good! Per reviewers' suggestions, the only changes I made were to sub the vanilla with coconut extract, 1/3 cup of cornstarch for the flour, and 1 can of coconut milk and the rest half-and-half to make up 3 cups. But I'm sure this would have been just as tasty as is. For those that have never bought coconut milk (like me)...I searched forever for it in the baking aisle and the dairy section, only to find it in the Asian food aisle! I didn't know that's where it was. I almost gave up looking for it! Anyway, thumbs up for this delicious pie. Very rich and delicious. Will be making it again and again.

Update: K listen up. If this pie is runny you didn't cook it enough. Thank you 'H' for the hint 'be like Dora, just keep whisking'. I waited until bubbles started to 'blobbup' (my new word for the day) up through the top. Blobbup... blobbup ...and still left it on the burner a while longer.
FINALLY it is keeping its shape, not runny at all. So you don't need 3 eggs. BTW, use the whole egg, what's with this using only the yolk?
Ok so my slight changes, I used a can of coconut cream and topped THAT up to 3 cups with half 'n half (10%). Perfect volume for  my pie shell.
I also used cornstarch, I happen to LOVE that thick kinda, sorta 'jello' consistency which I'd like to point out isn't how I'd describe it but that's what real coconut cream pie is like to me.
My God never use frozen whipped 'dessert', there isn't a drop of real cream in that poison.
I used one cup of heavy whipping cream, just beat it with a little bit of confectioner's sugar and a drop or two of coconut extract. The first time I made this with 16oz of cream as someone suggested, it was FAR too much.
This is a coconut cream pie not a whipped cream pie with coconut filling underneath, egads.
I never use sweetened coconut flakes, its unnecessary and we'all need to cut back on sugar content.
Now....made like this...is the best coconut cream pie I have ever eaten.

THE best coconut cream pie ever.  I made some of the recommended substitutions: 1.5 cups of half and half, 1.5 cups of coconut milk.  Used cornstarch instead of flour and used whipped cream instead of cool whip (I can't stand that stuff).  Made the custard in the microwave and it came out beautifully in five minutes, stopping to whisk every minute.  This was a fabulous pie and I will make it many times again.

This is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  The only thing I did differently is use 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream.  I made this for my Dad for a present as coconut cream pie is his all time fav - and it was gone so quickly!  It is to die for!  Thanks so much!

This was fantastic!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1.5 cups coconut milk for part of the half and half and used 1/3 c. cornstarch in place of the flour.  I did this in the microwave and it came out beautifully.  I used quite a bit more whipped topping than called for.  I also toasted just the coconut that went on top.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I was looking for a pie recipe that could be turned into a parfait for a "French-themed" Valentine's banquet at my chruch.  I needed a recipe that didn't have to be "baked" after placing in the plastic parfait glass.....and this recipe met that requirement!  My coconut-custard-loving PA Dutchies devoured it!  I mixed up graham crackers crumbs, butter, and sugar and baked it in the oven as directed on the box, only I didn't press it into the pie dish.  I then scooped two table spoons of the graham mix into each glass.  Next the custard (took suggestion of not toasting coconut added to custard, and using 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup flour instead of 1/2 cup flour....also took 40min to thicken for me).  Then Cool Whip and toasted coconut on top.  I took pictures of my professional looking treats to submit for this recipe....hope they eventually get posted.  Yummy!  Next time I will try the microwave trick!

I found this recipe to be the best ever!  I did make some substitutions, however.  I used Land O Lakes fat-free half-and-half, and I did assemble the pie in a pre-made graham cracker crust, and I whipped my own topping instead of using Cool Whip.  It was just wonderful, and every single crumb disappeared!  This is truly a keeper!

I made my own cookie crust and took the advice of others and did two cups of half and half and one cup of coconut milk. I topped it with homemade whipped cream. Let's just say that we were very sad when we ate the last of this pie!  It was delicious!!

I made this pie for Easter dinner & it was amazing!  I followed other's advice & used cornstarch in place of flour.  I also used cream of coconut that I found in our local liquor dept.  I used the whole carton of cream of coconut along with half and half to get three cups. I used three egg yolks in place of the eggs, & plenty of untoasted coconut in the filling.  I cooked the filling in the microwave on high for about seven minutes, stirring after every minute.  By minute seven the filling was very thick, which meant my pie would not be runny.  I placed the filling in my homemade pie crust & refrigerated overnight.  In the morning I topped it with whipped heavy cream (whipped with powdered sugar & vanilla)  and toasted coconut.  The pie was beautiful and tasted great.  It has held up well and is almost gone on the second day.  The only thing I would do differently is lessen the sugar because the pie was a bit too sweet.  Thank you Carol for a wonderful recipe, and thanks to everyone else for your tweaks to the original recipe.  I think this is the best pie I have ever made!

Whether you use the original version or the suggestions given by others; this is the best recipe you can possibly find. I've made three different versions so far and each of them was fantastic.

Really Nice.  I took some other reviewers advice and used 2 cups half and half cream, 1/2 cup of skim milk, plus added 1/4 cup of corn starch diluted by 1/4 cup of water to the mixture.  I also increased the amount of coconut in the filling and added 2 tbsp of butter and 1 tsp of coconut extract flavouring.  

The filling had a really smooth texture prior to adding the coconut.  Needs constant stirring, as the flour congeals on the bottom and you want to prevent burning and ending up with lumpy cream filling.

Would definitely make again - this made enough filling for a cream pie and two small ramekins (maybe 3/4 cup of filling left over, but my pie crust was pre-bought and a little shallow).  Don't be afraid to heap the coconut filling so it mounds up a bit from the pie crust - it's fairly thick and won't run over the crust.

Delish...I made with fat free half and half and fat free whipped topping.  I never missed the fat from the regular stuff.  So fast and easy too.  I will definitely make again.

Made as recipe reads. Used a pre-made graham cracker crust (9") and had leftover pie filling so made some little dessert cups too. Firmed up nicely in the refrigerator after 2 hours & was absoutely delicious with added toasted coconut on top. Yum!

I made this for Father's Day - a big hit!  I took the advice of others and used coconut milk, amazing!
Make your own whipped cream, it's easy and awesome.  I am making this again for a BBQ today. I will only make this recipe from now on!

Scrumptious!!!!!!!
I did use real whipping cream though.  Next time I'm going to try the recipe with 1 cup coconut milk and 2 cups half and half like the other reviews suggested.   Wow can this recipe get any better?

Excellent recipe!!  I only made one change, and it was to use 1/3 cup of cornstarch in place of flour ... I didn't have a whole lot of faith in the flour causing the pie to solidify, and the cornstarch did its magic.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly ... it had the perfect amount of not-super-sweet, with not-super-rich.  LOVED IT!  Thank you!

This is really rich & creamy, but does not have enough coconut flavor.  I even added a half teaspoon of coconut extract.  I may try using some coconut milk in place of some of the half and half.

I made this recipe last night for our dessert and it was great.... I use some of the suggestions and substituted the flour with cornstarch and 1 1/2 cups of half and half and 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk.  The pie was delicious.

Im not a big fan of coconut  but made it for my boyfriend and he loved it !  His only suggestion was to add more coconut flavoring but thats only because he is such a coconut lover.  I made my own heavy whip cream for topping.  Thanks!

I guess I should have listened to the reviews but I made this as the recipe states and it doesn't have a good taste of coconut.  I served it to guests and they said, hmmm.. I taste the coconut on top but is the filling supposed to be coconut too?  I was embarrassed to serve them.   I think with the substitution of some of the half & half with the coconut milk may very well fix this problem.  I may try it again using the best reviews.  Sorry, this just was not the great pie I wanted.

This is from another viewer but I used Coconut milk lite and just cooked it on the stove and pre baked Marie Clanders pie shell and it was the best!  Make your own whip cream! I also just used Bakers Angle Flake coconut and it worded great...  What a wonderful coconut cream pie. I tested this recipe out tonight because my girlfriend wants one for her birthday. If this didn't work out, I was going to head to Bob Evans to get her pie since, while I find their food lacking, they do a fantastic coconut pie. I followed some of the advice in previous reviews and used 1 1/2 cups half-n-half and 1 1/2 cups canned coconut milk. I also used the 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour and made my own whipped cream. I also used fresh coconut (from the freezer section) instead of that nasty dried, sweetened stuff in the cake mix aisle. I made the custard in the microwave and it was thick, smooth, creamy, and beautiful in just 5 minutes. I pulled the bowl out after each minute to stir the mixture with a whisk. SO easy and SO good. No need for coconut extract if you use fresh coconut and coconut milk. Thanks for a great recipe!

Did as others suggested and used cornstarch in place of flour, also 3 yolks in place of 2 whole eggs makes a HUGE difference. When I did the whole eggs i ended up straining out the thick bits that kept floating to the top which was pretty nasty. Also used about half a bag of flaked coconut in the pie which gave it a great texture. Sooo good!

I really expected an amazing coconut cream pie, but I was sadly disapointed. I made the recipe as directed with the exception of using 1.5 cups of coconut milk as everyone suggested and 1.5 cups of half and half. The consistancy was perfect, but there was very little to no coconut flavor, even with the flaked coconut and coconut milk in the recipe. The coconut was so subtle, you could barely taste it at all. I would recommend using the coconut milk, but also try adding some coconut extract as well.

OHHH my Goodness !!!!! Now I love coconut  & especially Coconut cream pie! This is THE BEST I'VE EVER TASTED.  DO NOT USED WHIPPED TOPPING  please use fresh whip cream  that you whip yourself. Just add 1 TSBP of icing sugar to it before you whip it,  to add a slight sweet flavour. It is sooo worth it. Made this again (I try to make it every special occasion) on the weekend for a 40th Anniversay party for my inlaws - Mom in Law loves Coconut as much as I do maybe even more. Every one complimented on it saying it was the best they had ever tasted. Told me I should start selling them to the local restuarants! WOW what a compliment. & their was only one piece left - we only had 6 Dinner Guests!

This was the best coconut cream pie with the changes of replacing half of the half and half with coconut milk. I also used cornstarch instead of the flour. This was a wonderful and easy pie to make. It was 100% better the next day so try to make it the day before you need it.

This is the Best Coconut Cream Pie I have ever ate!  You need to have Patience when you are cooking the filling, just keep stirring and keep it on low heat. I used 1 1/2 cups of half and half and 1 1/2 cups of canned coconut milk. I also used 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour. Last, I used the recipe on this website for the "whipped cream" by paula. I just gives it the Old Fashioned taste and not the cool whip taste.  I will never use another recipe for a coconut cream pie again. My grandmother says she thinks that it was better than her mothers!!!

This is the best coconut cream pie recipe I have ever tried. I've made this pie at least a dozen times.  We delivered a few of these pies to friends for Easter.  There were rave reviews from our friends.  The only thing I changed was to use stabalized whipped cream instead of whipped topping.  I like to use the best of everything!

I am not sure if I messed up this recipe or if it is supposed to turn out like the way it did. I followed all the directions but after I took out of the fridge it looked more like Old Fashion Coconut Cream Soup NOT pie! I may try this recipe over again because I must admit it looks scrumptious! But for right now I am sorry to say that this recipe was a disappointment.

Didn't have enough 1/2 & 1/2 so used some milk. Used cornstarch instead of flour. Also put in extra coconut. Made it with graham crumb base instead of pastry. Turned out really good!!!

I followed a few suggestions from previous reviews and I love this pie!  I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups half and half and instead of flour, I used 1/2 cup cornstarch and I also added 1/4 tsp coconut extract.  What I really liked about this pie is that it doesn't glob all over the place when you cut it - it stays together.  This is my new "go to" recipe for coconut cream pie.  Thanks for sharing Carol!

This was fabulous....I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well.  After reading some of the reviews, I made sure to cook it a little longer after it started to bubble...it thickened up very nicely.  I whipped fresh whipping cream, as I'm not to fond of cool-whip...I think fresh is better!!!!

This is a keeper. It came out wonderful! It takes a LONG time stirring on the stove, but the results are worth it. I used the frozen flaked coconut and did not toast the inside coconut, just the outside. I also did as others suggested and used half and half, coconut milk, and cornstarch. The results were to die for. Next time I make this I will use homemade whip cream. I used frozen whipped topping because of lack of time, and the topping came out OK... for all the time you spend stirring and mixing the filling, put the extra time to make homemade whipped topping. I will definetly do that next time. I made this for my first Easter dinner and my guests were in silence as they ate... I got many compliments. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the best!! So yummy. The only change i made was I used 1 1/2c half and half, and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk. You will not be dissapointed. Oh and i cooked it in the microwave like suggested by others, and it turned out perfect. It took about 7 minutes cooking it in my microwave stirring every min.

Positively the best coconut cream pie I've ever had! Followed suggestions of others using corn starch instead of flour. I also used 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 cup heavy cream. I could not find coconut milk so I added 1/4th cup coconut cream. Be patient stirring on low/medium heat. YUMMMM!!!!

This was the creamiset, most delicious coconut cream pie I've ever eaten.  I made it for guests, and it was very popular.  One guest talked about it for days afterwards.

Only change I would make...and not really a change..but, I would sprinkle the toasted coconut on individual pieces just before serving, as it does tend to get soggy in the refrigerator (that's assuming there's any left to refrigerate).  The contrast between the toasted coconut and the creaminess of the pie is delightful!

Amazing pie. I followed some other reviews and added a can of coconut milk, used cornstarch instead of flour and only toasted coconut on top. Made homemade whip cream, Heavy whipping cream (small carton), tsp vanilla and 1/3 or so of powdered sugar. I would add more vanilla to the actual pie next time. Wonderful though. Everyone was very impressed

I made my first Coconut pie, ever...it was delicious. I made the recipe by Carol H., but added the following to it based on previous comments. One, I added 2tbsp of cornstarch to the filling with a tsp. of coconut extract. I toasted about a 1/4 cup of slice almonds and added it to the coconut topping. I sprinkled it on top of the whip cream mixture,ohlala. I never like coconut pie, simply, because they never tasted like coconut. We ate half and I froze the rest. This is an A+ recipe.

Made it for Pi Day 3.14.15. I followed the recipe as written, but stirred the custard until it thickened, took about 5 minutes. When I first put the custard into the shell, I thought it was bland, but after chilling, the coconut flavor infused the custard beautifully. Best coconut pie I've ever had, including my favorite local restaurateur's famous one. Second time around: best in show in Tieton Highland Community Days Pie Palooza!

This was awesome!  I did make it with 1 1/2 c. coconut milk and 1 1/2 c. heavy whipping cream.  Cooked it in the microwave for between 5-6 min, whisking after each minute until it thickened.  I did not toast the coconut in the pie, just what went on top.  Also make my own whipped topping with 1 c. heavy whipping cream, 1 tsp coconut extract & 3 T. powdered sugar.  Don't make the topping until shortly before serving.  Mine whipped up nice, but turned too creamy overnight, so it was messy.  Still good, just messy.

Delicious!  I have a new favorite pie!  I made this according to other reviews, substituting a can of coconut milk and topping it up to 3 cups with heavy cream.  I also used 1/3 cup of corn starch instead of the flour.  My family raved an my husband had two slices!

I have gone back to this recipe again & again! I used the changes of coconut milk & 1/2 and 1/2, I use the cornstarch, and I make my own whipped cream with coconut extract. I hated the regular crust so I used a graham cracker one instead on the next pie and that was perfect! I used to cook at an assisted living facility and the residents loved this pie!

Fresh squeezed lime juice, coconut milk and young coconut take this recipe to another level! And you can also make a great finger desert with this by putting into mini phyllo shells (found in freezer section) just before serving. Just reheat if they get soggy. I have made this recipe several times and can't stress enough to use a can of coconut milk (or if you're really lucky enough to find coconut creme) along with the half & half. I get mine at an Asian grocery as it's significantly cheaper there than chain stores. After the mix is cooked and has cooled a little, I squeeze one lime into it for extra zing. I also find fresh young coconut better than packaged shredded. Young coconut is a slimy, fleshy substance that is not dry like mature coconut and I think that dry texture is why a lot of people say they don't like coconut. It's extra work to have to crack open the shell (pays to research on internet) but you get the extra benefit of healthful chilled coconut water w lime to drink later. They're sold at chain grocers too. Recently I did see canned young coconut at the Asian grocer so I may just use that next time. I only used frozen shredded once with this recipe and didn't like the texture of the custard at all compared to the smooth young meat. I'm thinking you really don't need coconut at all, if you have fussy eaters, as the coconut milk will give it enough flavor.

This was excellent and easy to make.  I had NO problem with this setting up - but it does require a little patience during the cooking process.  I made mini-pies with half of the recipe and with the other half I made parfaits by layering graham cracker crumbs in the bottom of the cup followed by the pie filling, then whipped topping, then toasted coconut.  I cut little circles from my remaining pie dough and garnished the parfaits with them.  I took several desserts to a function and these parfaits were the hit of the function.  Rave reviews and people going back for seconds.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe, Carol H.!

This recipe was wonderful! I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used 1/3 cup of cornstarch and left the flour out. I also used half coconut cream (not coconut milk!) and half heavy cream instead of the half and half. While it definitely wasn't low fat or low calorie, it was the most incredibly velvety pie I've ever had!

Followed a few reviews and mixed and matched till I came up with an amazing pie! I substituted a can of full fat coconut milk and heavy cream for the half and half, along with 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour, and three egg yolks instead of two eggs. I guess by the time you make the adjustments it's not really the same pie, but I wanted to make sure it had enough coconut flavor and I love creamy it turned out!

This was outstanding!!!!! I did do the half coconut milk, 1/2  whipping cream recipe. Also, because the mixture (to me) tasted a little constarch-y while it was hot off the oven, I poured a little coconut extract in the mix which really MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE! I love how with this recipe you can literally change things around and this will still taste delicious! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! It was silky, smooth and oh so creammmy! I left the coconut inside the cream untoasted and the coconut on top toasted. This was so good! I will definitely make this again. I made my own whipped cream, bu be careful not to make it too sweet. I used a bout 1 1/2 small carton of whipping cream, about 3 heaping tablespoons (real spoon, not an actual tablespoon) of powdered sugar and poured a little vanilla extract. Afterwards, I thouht hmm, maybe I should have used coconut extract. Either way it would be fine! and also, I had some whipped cream left over that I took to Thanksgiving and people ate it with a spoon it was so good! It tasted like real whipped cream, so I'm glad I used vanilla extract. Try this recipe!

First time coconut pie for me and it was so easy and tasted great!! I followed the pie directions but did not use a pastry crust. I used graham cracker crumbs, some butter, 2 tbls. sugar, and about 1/4 cup shredded coconut. Pressed it all together in my pie plate and it was great!!!

Have already made this twice! My family loves it. I made a few changes based on other reviews. I used a can of coconut milk and made up the rest of the 3 cups with half and half. Used cornstartch instead of flour and used real whipped cream I whipped myself with a little sugar. I did not toast the coconut, First time I added the toasted cocnut on top second time not - it was still just as good. This will be going in my repeat recipie collection

Meh, It was good. I wasn't insanely crazy about this pie; HOWEVER, I did do 1/2 Coconut Milk and 1/2 Half-and-Half after reading the reviews. That's why the 4/5 vs 3/5 that I wanted to give. It was the first time I've used Coconut Milk and was expecting the flavor to be more... Coconutty? My bad! Great custard recipe though. I will use that again!

4.5 really.  This was a great recipe.  I as well did the changes others had recommended 1 1/2 C each of Coconut Milk and Half/Half.  Then I also did 1/3 C each of Cornstarch and Flour. 

Everyone loved this recipe.  I did not do a merginue frosting but rather a whipped frosting.

This pie is already being requested for the upcoming Christmas dinner at our house.

This was fantastic!  My husbands favorite pie is coconut/banana cream.  I've always ordered them but thought I'd try it.  I lined the pie shell with banana slices and then added the filling.  INCREDIBLE,  2nd day was better than the 1st!  Homemade from now on! Thank YOU!

A friend made this and it is fantastic! Best coconut cream pie ever! Great flavor and texture.

*Update* I made this into bars for Easter on a graham cracker crust. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious. My husband requested a coconut cream pie (which i had never made before) and I settled on this recipe to try. He loved it and so did I.   I honestly would not change a thing. The second time I made this I substituted coconut milk for the half and half as some reviewers suggested. I actually preferred it as written. I would definitely make this again.

I made this pie using this recipe. The pie was awesome! I must have messed up baking it, on my part, bc I had to freeze it & keep it frozen in order to eat bc it never got cold enough in the fridge, it was just so liquidy.... If anyone can tell me why it did this, that would be great!! Other than that, the pie tasted like heaven! :-)

I can't find anything wrong with this recipe, I liked it and I don't normally like coconut (I'm currently pregnant and that's what posessed me to make it)... I toasted coconut on top and slivered almonds on top as well....WARNING....this recipe made 2 pies for me and i used the deep frozen pie crusts! that was the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars cause if i hadn't of had that extra crust i would have tossed out half the mixture and that sucks.

I got rave reviews with this pie.  People claimed they'd never eaten a better one.  After reading all the reviews, I did make a few changes, though.  First, I used half coconut milk/half cream instead of regular half and half.  Second, I used rice flour instead of regular flour.  Third, I used grated macaroon coconut instead of flaked (I think the flaked tends to be too sweet).  Fourth, I used real whipped cream for the top, with just a hint of coconut extract in it.:-)
I am thinking of trying it with coconut milk in place of the entire amount of half and half next time.

I did not use coconut milk or corn starch as the reviews suggested, and this pie was heavenly! The consistency was fine with the flour and set up  perfectly. I did, however, make my own whipped cream for the top. Delicious pie! Will make again and again. :)

This ended up ok, but it took several of the suggested changes to make it good. Use half and half and coconut milk, this recipe really makes enough for 2 pies, also you don't need that much coconut, 3/4 c is plenty. Do not use frozen whipped cream that is just criminal. And whatever you do DO NOT TRY THIS CUSTARD IN THE MICROWAVE!! this came out a soupy mess which never firmed, i had to pour it into a pot and re-start all over again and then it firmed, also use corn starch. don't know if i will try this one again.

Hi- frozen whipped topping doesn't put me in mind of an authentic coconut cream pie, but I will try the recipe anyway, because the custard looks so DELECTIBLE!! I'll just substitute real, heavy cream whipped with a tsp of apple jelly, which helps the cream retain it's shape in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't add flour; instead, I used cornstarch.  Also, instead of half-n-half, I used whipping cream.  Then, made homemade whipped cream the basic recipe here on AR.  CREAMY AND YUMMY.  Mine was more like a pudding than a pie, but it was delicious!

This was a very good recipe, though not enough coconut flavor. Will make again, with something to put more coconut flavor in it.

I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups half and half, 3 egg yolks not the two eggs called for and 1/3 cup cornstarch. Very good! Family loved it. With these slight variations, this will be my go-to recipe for Coconut Cream Pie from now on.

I have to admit I was disappointed with this recipe, the custard came out really nicely and the recipe is well written, and I did use coconut cream (topped up with a little milk when I ran out) but the taste was just so underwhelming I couldn't help but feel disappointed.  It was like a vanilla custard with a few bits of toasted coconut thrown in that you could just barely taste.  That being said there's a simple way to solve it and thats to use a little coconut extract, to make it actually taste like coconut

I really loved this recipe. Took others advice and used 1 1/2 c coconut milk and 1 1/2 c h&h in place of the 3 c  half and half. Used the actual flour called for in the recipe, not corn starch. Also used coconut extract in both the custard and the whipping cream( I made real, fresh whipping cream and used lots, to get the pie higher like the photo depicts. Maybe 3 cups, for real!)It is REALLY rich and really amazing, and really fancy looking. Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

This was super tasty.  It did take an hour at the stove stirring, and it never boiled but it did thicken.  I replaced half of the half&half with with coconut milk also.  Would have given it 5 stars if it didn't take so long standing at the stove stirring the filling.

Made this for Father's Day for my husband and he said I could I make this anytime.  I used a graham cracker crust.  I also used a can of cream of coconut and the rest whole milk to equal 3 cups.  I forgot to toast the coconut but put it in the food processor and mixed the entire cup in the custard.  I also used 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of the flour and used an extra yolk.  Once the pie had cooled off I made whip cream with a half pint of whipping cream and 2-3TBS of powder sugar and a 1tsp vanilla then topped it all off with toasted coconut.  Very good, maybe a little too sweet for me.  Next time I think I will look for the coconut in the freezer section that is not sweetened.  Sorry for all the alterations, I just used the recipe as a guideline.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! but after you make these few adjustments: instead of using 3 cups half-and-half, i used one and a half cups half-and-half and 1 and a half cups of coconut milk. also, i used 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup corn starch rather than 1/2 cup flour. everything else i followed as directed. i poured my coconut custard filling into a pre-made, store bought shortbread pie shell which tasted great. and used cool whip and toasted coconut flakes on top. i'm 17 and made it for my family who would not stop talking about it. i will definitely be making this again!

I changed the recipe a bit according to other reviews..I used 1 can coconut milk and then enough half-and-half to make it equal 3 cups, used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs, used 1/2 cup of corn starch instead of the flour, and I also used a graham cracker crust. This pie was so yummy, my entire family LOVED it! I will use this recipe again, I'm sure of it!!

I didn't put any whipped topping or toasted coconut on top. I doubled the recipe--cooked it all at once (as directed) in a big pot on the stove.  I used 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/2 cup flour mixed as the thickening.  I happened to have a can of coconut milk and a can of coconut sugar on hand.  I used about 2 cups coconut milk, 2 and 1/2 cups of 2% milk and 1 and 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream (remember, I doubled the recipe).  I used 2 cups of coconut sugar.  Followed everything else to a "T"!  Perfect.  People who don't like coconut very much and my husband who normally doen't go for cream pies when there is other stuff around (I made this in addition to about 5 other desserts for thanksgiving) LOVED it.  I think the coconut milk and sugar really added to the over all "coconuttyness."  ENJOY!

Very Good! The only problem was the flour got little lumps, even whisking didn't help. Next time I will whisk the flour with a small amount of the milk first. It tasted awesome! Tried using 1 cup of heavy cream and 2 cups half&half-very creamy. Will make this again, family loved it!

This was my first attempt at coconut cream pie and it turned out great!! I followed other reviews and used 1 1/2 cups of unsweetened coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of half and half. Be careful when you toast your coconut... I learned the hard way and burned it until it was black. Great pie and there wasn't a piece left. (My boyfriend's dad had 3 pieces!)

I made this for Mother's Day and it was a big hit! Did use half cocnut milk and heavy cream - worked wonderfully. Also definately recommend using microwave to make custard (if you have patience like mine!) - very quick! Thank you for a great recipe!!

My first attempt at making a coconut cream pie was a success thanks to this recipe! I followed the trend to use a can of coconut milk (about 1 2/3 cup) and 1 1/3 cup half and half.  I would have used corn starch but did not have any on hand. the flour worked just fine for me.  I also put in a full cup of untoasted coconut and then toasted about a 1/4 cup to sprinkle on top of the home made whipped cream.  I am not great at making beautiful desserts, but this turned out beautifully!  It is a 5 star with alterations mentioned!

I've made this a few times and it is delicious. I used the suggestions from the reviews: 1 1/2 cups coconut milk, cornstarch, 3 yolks instead of whole eggs. This time I tried microwaving it, and it didn't work. I let it sit in the fridge over night and then I poured it out of the crust and into a pot. I cooked it on the stove, and it thickened up in a few minutes. I think it's actually easier than microwaving, and it works better. This recipe is great! Everyone loves it!

This was the BEST pie I've ever made.  I followed other members' adjustments.  I used a can of Cream of Coconut and half and half to equal 3 cups.  I used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs. I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar because of the sweetness of the cream of coconut and the sweetened shredded coconut.  I topped it with a meringue made with my leftover egg whites.  It was AWESOME.  It's a definite keeper!!!

Delicious!!  Coconut Cream Pie is my husband's favorite and he couldn't get enough of it.  I did use Fat Free half and half and Fat Free Cool Whip.  Still very good and now it is in my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing.  AA++

Made this pie for Thanksgiving and heard how wonderful it was at Christmas.  I too substituted the coconut milk and used corn starch.  My only problem was that I cooked it in the microwave stirring every minute, but even after the first minute it had started to lump so I would beat it good and cook longer, finally at the end I had to beat it to get the lumps out.  Next time I will cook it on the stove.

This was terrific! My hunt is over for the perfect coconut cream pie.  I have been looking for 10 years.  I did substitute corn starch for the flour.  Next time I might try to use half of the milk with coconut milk.  When cooking the mixture on the stove it will take awhile for the mixture to thicken, be patient, it is worth it!! Delicious!!

Amazing! I made the pie using the modifications suggested by other raters (part coconut milk and using cornstarch to thicken). I also put this into a "coconut macaroon" crust. I ground up coconut macaroons and made a graham cracker-style crust. I've always loved coconut cream pie, and this reminds me of the ones my aunt used to make. Thank you for a great recipe!

I'm not going to give this one star because there is a chance that I did something wrong. I think that the directions weren't clear enough. It would not come to a boil on low while stirring constantly. By the time a couple bubbles gurgled to the top it was excessively thick. When I tried a little bit of it the texture was off and it tasted like nothing but flour. I dumped it was make something else for Easter dessert!

This came out amazing. I dropped the half and half two 2 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup of canned coconut milk, other than that everything the same, and it was brilliant.

Don't think it's fair of me to rate this recipe because the version I used bears little resemblance to the recipe as written but it wouldn't let me save the review without a rating so I gave it 3 for inspiration. I followed the advice of others and used coconut cream (I was out of coconut milk) and heavy cream as well as substituting cornflour for the flour with fresh whipped cream for the top. I also didn't toast the coconut. If you use coconut cream you really don't need to use coconut essence...I thought it was a little overpowering. Fabulous pie with the modifications and for my first attempt at a coconut cream pie I thought it turned out really well. I will definitely be making this regularly.

I just made this pie this morning.  The only thing I changed was I added 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract.  It is the best coconut cream pie I ever had if I must say so myself!!!!!  I wouldn't change anything like some reviews posted.

Really tasty! But I used the coconut milk and corn starch like other reviews said. The mixture needs to thicken to a pudding/tapiocia like texture before reducing heat. It will not thicken completely in the fridge......i learn the hard way. otherwise a great pie!

5+++ must try and so easy!! I used 1 & 1/2 c canned coconut milk and 1 & 1/2 c milk, no flour- used 1/3 c cornstarch. I did not toast the coconut that went into the pie only the coconut that topped it. I also used fresh homemade whipping cream and I used fresh frozen coconut. What a treat. It did take me about 20 minutes on low-med heat for it to thicken to the pudding stage.

Sooooo Good!  This had a rich coconut flavor and got great reviews at my Super Bowl party.  I made a few changes:  Used 1 1/2 cups half and half and 1 1/2 cups cream of coconut (comes in a can in grocery store near evaporated milk).  I used 1/3 cup cornstarch and omitted flour.  Also, I used fresh shredded coconut that was found in the freezer section.  I tried to thicken this in the microwave as other reviewers suggested and it did not thicken all the way, only slightly.  So I ended up putting it on the stovetop (setting 3 on gas stove) and it began to boil within 7 or 8 minutes and thicken up nicely.  Just be sure to stir the entire time.  Then I refigerated it and it was nice and thick - like a pudding consistency. I made homemade whipped cream for the top rather than using cool whip and toasted a little coconut to garnich the top.  I think you will be happy with this recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! I wasn't the largest fan but that's because I don't love cream pies. Everybody else raved. I made the same changes that everybody else made (swapping half of the half-and-half for coconut milk and the flour for 1/3 cup of cornstarch). I used an entire package of unsweetened frozen coconut in the filling not toasted and then used the toasted sweetened stuff on top. It was beautiful AND delicious!

I am not a fan of coconut but my mom LOVES coconut cream pie so I made this for Thanksgiving for her. This was FANTASTIC!!! Taking others' opinions, I used half coconut milk in this. I also used 1/2 fresh coconut (found in the freezer section of the grocery store) and 1/2 of the sweetened stuff you find in the baking isle. I doubled the amount of coconut in the pie and I also only toasted 1/2 of the coconut and left the other half "raw" This was creamy and delicious. My husband, who hates coconut, couldn't get enough of this pie.

Yummy yummy yummy. I used the changes  that many people suggested, if you sort the reviews by most helpful you will find them all. Like the cornstarch, coconut extract, coconut milk and making it in the micowave (worked like a charm). It was just too yummy. I will make it for my mom when she comes and visits. She loves coconut cream

This recipe is great.  I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups half & half to give it more flavor as well as 1/4 tsp coconut extract. I also substituted the flour with corn starch. I used real whip cream for the topping.  Instead of boiling on low, I boiled the filling between medium and low so that it wouldn't take as long and it turned out great.

Well, I was afraid this would not turn out just because what makes it taste coconutty? Well, I think the secret is making it the night before and letting the flavors blend overnight in the fridge covered in plastic wrap. It took FOREVER to make tho, that constant stirring almost killed me! But it was the best pie at Easter dinner. well worth it. Also, WATCH your coconut. If you toast it, it burns rather quickly if you dont watch it. I had to make 2 batches before I got it right. EVERYONE loved this! SUPER creamy and yummy! I topped it with heavy whipping cream and powdered sugar beat until ultra fluffy and topped it with that, SO nice and beautiful! I will make this forever now. Next time I may add 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of coconut extract and see if that makes it sweeter. It tastes mainly like cream, sweet cream. I like a strong coconut flavor tho.

I have made this pie for Christmas, church, soup suppers, etc.  I have never had anything but great compliments.  I did substitute 1/3 c cornstarch for the flour.  I mixed the ingredients and cooked in the microwave, mixing with a wisk about every minute or two to remove any lumps.  This speeds the cooking and you don't scorch the filling. You can't tell any difference if you use two c half-and-half and one cup 2% milk.  I put a full 1 c toasted coconut in the filling and top with another 1/4 c toasted coconut.  I make a meringue rather than using frozen whipped topping.  I will be taking two pies for a chili supper tomorrow evening and hope that I get a piece for myself.  This recipe is well worth the time.  Thanks for submitting it.

Unbelievably delicious.  I had to give half of it away because we couldn't stop eating it.  Easy recipe to make and the presentation with the toasted coconut flakes is just wonderful.  I'll be making this again.

This recipe was extremely easy to make, and tasted wonderful! I put the whipped topping into a cake decorator and used it to make the topping look fancy. Looked just like store bought, but tasted sooo much better. Keep an eye on the coconut while toasting as it tends to brown quickly. (I found out the hard way!) Everyone from my 1 year old son to my 87 yr old grandmother loved it! Thanks so much Carol for this delightful recipe.

Wrap top of crust with foil so the bottom of crust can cook long enough to not get soggy.  Toast 8oz pkg coconut.  Use 1 can coconut milk, the rest half/half.  Use three eggs.  Replace flour with corn starch.

I used 1/3 cup corn starch and 2 TBSP flour.  If you start heating it over medium heat, start stirring constantly with  a flat bottomed coil whisk as it gets hot, it will begin to boil sooner and you can then lower the heat.  Stir constantly for one minute.  Lots less cooking time and no sticking on bottom of pan whatsoever.  Delicious with meringue topping.

First time I have made coconut cream pie filling from scratch. I made exactly as directed and it was absolutely delicious. For folks who say it didn't set, I guarantee you didn't cook it long enough. It takes quite some time for it to boil at low heat, while stirring constantly, at least 20 minutes or more depending on your stove. Personally I wouldn't recommend substituting corn starch for the flour, it would change the texture and make it more gelatinous instead of custard like. I don't see any need to use coconut milk either - our grandmothers certainly wouldn't have had that on hand. I think this is a great recipe as is. I really believe you should make the recipe as it is written, at least the first time, otherwise you are rating your own version....

So I made this for the third time. As I stated in my previous review I do not care for pastry crust. This time I used a chocolate cookie crust and it tasted like a Mounds

Recipe was super simple, and easy to do. I made it this past Thanksgiving and it was no hassle at all. I had so many other dishes to make, it was nice to make this because it is primarily done on the stove top (other than baking the pie shell) so I was able to make the filling while baking other things in the oven. My family loved it. It was rich, creamy, and delicious. I used untoasted coconut and real vanilla bean in the filling, and  made fresh whipped cream to put over the custard; those were the only things  I altered.  I already have requests to make this again.

This is my favorite cream pie recipe. I've made it numerous times, exactly as written, and it makes a perfect pie....it thickens beautifully, and doesn't break like the traditional cream pie recipe I used to make (you cook the filling without the eggs in it, then temper the egg yolks and add back into the filling). I also use this to make banana cream pie, omitting the coconut and adding 3-4 cut bananas into the filling. If using an extra large pie pan,  I do 1.5x the recipe, to ensure plenty of filling. This is my family's favorite pie.

I love this recipe, and I've used it for years. I've made it at least a dozen times, and the only change I make is adding more coconut and a little extra flour to account for high altitude, although I think I'll try the coconut milk that other reviewers suggest, just to see! Also, I make my own whipped cream. If your pie doesn't set, you probably didn't heat it long enough or had too much heat. It takes a long time (20+) minutes. Your arm will hurt! If you heat it over too high heat, it won't thicken the way you want, either. Low heat. Long time. Until it bubbles and it thick pudding consistency! I've never once had this pie not set up, it's perfect every time!

Made this recipe with modifications based on other reviews. I used one whole can of coconut milk and made up the difference with half and half  until I reached 3 cups.  I also used a little over 1/3 c of cornstarch. even with the coconut milk it just tasted to much like plain custard than coconut. Had it not been for the toasted coconut I would have never guessed it was coconut. Also I thought it was too sweet but that could have been because of the added sugar from the coconut milk. Next time I will use an entire 3 c of coconut milk and the extract as suggested by a few and cut down on the sugar. As a plain custard pie it was very good. Also I usually like to follow recipe exactly the first time so that I can give the review on the actual recipe not my version however in this instance I'm glad I deviated. I do love adore coconut so my expectation for a strong coconut flavor may have been  over  zealous.

I made the changes suggested by previous reviewers (1.5 c coconut milk, 1.5 c blend, corn starch instead of flour). I used flaked coconut from a bag as I couldn't find frozen, untoasted in the custard and toasted on top. I used real whipped cream, 1cup with 2 tbsp sugar and 1tsp coconut flavouring instead of vanilla. I also cooked the custard in the microwave, I did 1 minute intervals stirring after each min, took 7 minutes. I had enough filling for 12 tarts and 1 8" pie shell. Super yummy and surprisingly easy to make.

Very easy, very tasty! The only thing I did differently was only used 2 cups of cream and then 1 cup coconut milk. Gives a nice flavour.

This pie is amazing and I've made many. I use 1 1/2 cups coconut milk/cream & 1 1/2 cups half and half. For the topping. I use a tub of cool whip and a package of coconut cream pudding mix. Mix both together & top with toasted coconut. Absolutely amazing. Tons of flavor.

As several others have noted, the filling did not set. I cooked the custard on low until it got as thick as it could without scrambling the eggs.  It just didn't seem to thicken as custard usually does. I still give it an extra star because it tasted terrific.

Great recipe!
I did substitute corn starch in place of flour and added egg yolks (3) to recipe.  I added frozen coconut  (2 cups) , coconut milk instead of all half and half ( you can do 1.5 cups coconut milk and 1.5 cups heavy cream or half and half) for a coconutty flavor . For the toping I whipped my own cream. The filling consistency  was great and if you want a less firm filling just add less corn starch (start with 1/4 firm to 1/3 cup extra film filling) as you are heating up your filling.  If you want to add more starch add it to 2 tablespoons half and half , stir then add to saucepan. If you add starch directly to pan, it will clump. when heating make sure it bubbles slightly  at edges of pan, while constantly stirring then you know you the filling has set. Be patient it will set! do not have the heat on too high.  Thanks for sharing for the recipe!
Made this many times! Delicious !

This was awesome.  I am allergic to soy and so many store bought pies have soybean oil so it was great to find an easy recipe to make at home.  I did use a can of coconut milk in place of about 2 cups of the half in half and I used 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour as many suggested.  I also added an extra egg.  My daughter and I tripled the recipe to make 3 pies at once for us and our family.  We had all three pies made in less than 45 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

Yum! This pie was fabulous. I made it in a cookie crumb crust. Like others, I used a can of cocoanut milk as part of the 3 cups of liquid, and used soy milk for the remainder. I also used 3 egg yolks instead of two eggs, and replaced half the flour with cornstarch. My family loved it!

I tried this recipe today for the first time - I can't seem to get it to set.  I took the filling back out of the pie shell and tried to re-thicken it with more flour and it still doesn't seem to want to set.

The best pie ever...I changed it up some. I used 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of half and half instead of the 3 cups of half and half. I also put chopped walnuts in the pie shell when baking it. This gives the crust an extra crunch and who doesn't like toasted walnuts? I would recommend this pie to everyone. It is the best.

I have to admit I always made this kind of pie out of a pudding.  Thought I'd try the "old fashion way".   NEVER again will my pie come out of a box.  This recipe is amazing, although I did make the change that most recommended using 1 c. coconut milk and 2 c. half n half.   The taste was excellent.  It thickened quite nice using flour.  Thanks again for submitting this recipe. (and my husband thanks you too!)

This recipe came out delicious!!! My grandmother is smiling down on me from heaven! I've never made a boiled custard pie such as this, and my first time I was a little scared because it boiled really quickly and set fast! I kept it in the fridge for up to 5 days and the crust and the pie consistency were still perfect!!

I've never made a coconut cream pie before and I don't have to look for another recipe after finding this one! It was amazing and easy. Like some other reviews I did use coconut milk and then filled the rest quota of 3 cups with the half and half. Gave it a nice creamy coconut taste! Everyone loved this pie so recipe is a keeper!

This pie is so delicious! I will definitely make it again. I used 1.5c coconut milk and 1.5c half and half, and 1/4 tsp. coconut extract in place of 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, made my own pie shell and made my own whipped cream. Sooooo good.

Amazing. Not too sweet nor too rich. Just perfect. Used homemade whipped topping (8 oz carton heavy whipping cream, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 TBSP powdered sugar) but followed the rest of the recipe to a T. Next time will try frozen or fresh coconut in the filling.

This is the best coconut cream pie I've ever had.  I followed some the suggestions of other reviewers.  I used 2 cups coconut milk & 1 cup 2% milk (I didn't have cream or half & half), also 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour and untoasted coconut for inside the pie.  It thickened so well & set perfectly but I did cook on low heat & stirred for about 30 minutes.  So worth that extra time.  Delightful!

I love reading recipes, and then the comments. It helps to spark your own creativity! So, I loved the recipe, but taking cues from the reviewers, I decided to mix together 1 cup of heavy cream w/ 13 oz of coconut milk. I used 1 cup of regular milk to mix the sugar, cornstarch and salt in the pot. I decided to use 5 egg yolks, and I slowly whisked the entire mixture of whole milk, cornstarch, salt and sugar into the eggs. Poured that back into the pot (keep whisking, people), I then added the coconut and heavy cream mixture. It was beautiful~!! 2 minutes later, I took it off the heat, still whisking, I added the vanilla, butter, and finally, the combo of toasted and untoasted coconut. Real whipped cream topping, sprinkled with toasted coconut. A total winner!! Everyone loved it, and complained that I didn't make two pies!!! I give it 4 1/2 stars for the ease in modifying it. Thanks for all who contributed to this recipe.:)

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the desserts, came out perfect. I did as the viewer suggested and used half coconut milk and also used cornstarch, I did use the full cup of coconut in pie sprinkles some of bottom of cooked crust and then toasted more for the top.  With my Mothers pie crust recipe this is a keeper.

Very good!  I used the flour as suggested and but subbed the 1/2 and 1/2 for 1c coconut milk and 2c heavy whipping cream.  It took about 20-25min. of constant stirring to boil on low.  I am a novice cook and it was pretty easy for me, but I am so glad I did not quit stirring before it boiled on low!

I just made this pie and everyone loved it. The pie was gone that evening. Like others I used cream of coconut, but I used whipping cream with the cream of coconut to make up the 3 cups. I didn't measure the flour I just put in a heaping half of cup. It turn out really rich, creamy and thick. I will use this recipe from now on...Pamicake

I have made this several times using Silk brand Pure Coconut milk (vanilla flavored) instead of the half and half (making the recipe dairy free for my son that is allergic to dairy) and it is FANTASTIC!!  It is a favorite in our family!!

This is my first time making coconut cream pie. I did a couple of things different from the recipe based on what I figured would suit our preferences. I used 2 cups coconut milk, and made 1 cup half and half substitute (none on hand) by combining 1 1/2 T. melted butter and enough milk to make a full cup. I also subbed 1/3 cup cornstarch for the flour. Everything else was the same. I cooked it in the microwave (can't remember exactly how long, but it was around 8 minutes), stirred every minute with a whisk, and let it cool for about 10 or 15 minutes after stirring in the coconut and vanilla, stirring every few minutes to help speed cooling before putting it in the crust. I also made homemade whipped topping, another first for me and I was pleased with how easy it was to make. The only thing wrong with the pie was that I didn't put quite enough sugar in the whipped topping...my mistake!  Great pie, I will definitely make this again!

The taste was delicious I just don't know what I did wrong, I wish someone could give me some feedback.  I put in 2 cups of half & half and 1 cup of evaporated milk and I put in 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour & 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, the rest was done as per the recipe.  But for some reason the pie never set.  I ate it soupy just like melted ice cream with some shortbread cookies!  idk but good!

In addition to following changes by most, I always strain the custard cream.  The changes that helped the most--split the flour into half portion corn starch, half portion flour.  Split vanilla into half portion vanilla, half portion coconut extract.  And, I split the half anf half to half coconut milk, half-half and half.  (I have also substituted whole milk for half and half.)  I also only toast half of the coconut, and put the other half untoasted.  All of the modifications are wonderful!  Thank you everyone!

Amazing recipe! One of my all time favourites of ANY pie. Minor changes-- I did what some suggested--and used 1 cup of coconut milk and 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2. and I only toasted the coconut for the garnish.  I topped with real whipped cream.

made for my husband's birthday instead of a cake... it was a BIG hit!!  My daughter who is mega-picky loved it as well.  I only had 2.5 c half & half & used 1/2 c milk to get to 3 cups... used 1/3 c corn starch instead of flour, like others suggested.  Whipped up some fresh sweet cream topping instead of the frozen variety.  My first attempt at coconut cream pie will NOT be my last!  Thank you for the delicious & easy recipe!

Tasted rather plain to me and I added coconut milk like some of the reviews suggested. Maybe next time I'll add coconut flavoring instead of vanilla and possibly change my review based on that.

wow this is an amazing pie.  I didn't have half and half, instead I used goats milk because that's what we raise.  I borrowed cream to whip from a friend who has cows.  Absolutely lovely pie!!!

The filling in this pie sounds scrumptious but to truly be old fashioned, it should have a baked meringue topping with toasted coconut!

Very good.  I followed others peoples reviews and used cornstarch to thicken instead of flour.  I would have used coconut milk too, but mine was expired.  This is a really good recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!

My boyfriend loves this pie.  I am not a custard/pudding fan so I don't eat this but I have tried it and if I loved that type of food, I would love this.  I altered the recipe according to other reviewers.  I used 3 egg yolks instead of the eggs, used coconut milk and half and half to make 3 cups and used cornstarch instead of flour.  I make my own pie crust and I whip my own cream instead of cool whip.  This is super easy to make-I make the filling in the microwave and it takes less than 5 minutes to thicken up.

4.5 stars! I followed the third and final tried-and-true variations of SHEA1228 (Nov 2008). It was a big hit with my family and even I (a non-cc pie lover) liked it. But next time, I may refrain from adding the frozen coconut bits to the cream portion. It's just a personal preference thing -- analogous to orange juice with pulp vs. without. (PS - I prefer my OJ without pulp.) Good stuff; and before this, I never knew cream of coconut in a can even existed.

made this for the camp i work in for 25 men.. doubled the recipe it made 2 HUGE pies and they both got eaten that night! I even got compliments from a guy who NEVER has desert!! The only thing i would change is toasting the coconut especially this little of an amount.. do yourself a favor, it is much more convenient to do it over med. heat in a frying pan on the stove top.. just make sure you keep stirring it.. 2 thumbs up 5 stars!!

Perfection!!!  I took the suggestion of others and used 1/3 c. corn starch.  I also used 1 1/2 c. of half and half and 1 1/2 c. of unsweetened coconut milk.  I compared prices of coconut milk in the baking isle vs. organic section, and it was actually cheaper in the organic section.  I also used coconut extract instead of vanilla.  I will definetly make again!!!!  Use toasted coconut on top, it is a must have with real whipping cream!

Ok, so I tried to follow other users reviews and go use coconut milk.  Unfortunately I couldn't find coconut milk at my grocery store so I went with a can of coconut cream which brings me to my point - that swap out plus using corn starch instead of flour made the texture a little bit weird, it was pretty thick and lumpy.  That being said, it was so delicious that no one cared about that.  This pie is awesome.  I made it as a request for a friend, I have never liked coconut but I gave this a taste and it is wonderful.  I will absolutely make this again.  But next time I'll cut the corn starch down a little and find coconut milk instead of coconut cream.

We followed the recipe exactly until the last portion, in which we added both coconut flakes and about 3 tbsp cocoa powder to the mixture, and it turned out great! The pie overall was semisweet, so it was not overbearing. The coconut flakes can burn to a crips rather quickly, so keep checking on them while in the oven. Furthermore, the mixture took a long time to boil, but just patient, or else the eggs will curdle if the heat is turned on too high. Overall, great pie!

Delicious! I made it just like the recipe but added 1 tsp. coconut extract (some reviews said it wasn't coconuty enough) also I added alittle more than a cup of coconut cuz that is what was left in the bag. It was soooo good, especially the 2nd day. The first day I thought it seemed too sweet though very tasty, but the next day it was perfection. Will be making this one often! Also got distracted when toasting the cocnut and it was so toasted that in another few seconds it would have burned. I used it anyway without any problems.

Used the can of creme of coconut and 1/2 and 1/2 as other mentioned, substituted the vanilla for coconut extract and did not toast the coconut. Maybe it's not fair to rate it the way I made it, but since it was my first time making and eating I figured I'd follow the advice of so many others. It came out wonderful!!!! Delicious, I'm hooked.

I followed the subsitutions in the comments (re: coconut milk and cornstarch only because I had to use up some coconut milk and I usually have trouble with flour lumping up) and it was great.  Easy to make, very tasty. I liked the toasted coconut in the pie. I'll make it again.

Did as one reviewer suggested and added a whole can of coconut milk and then cream to make up the 3 cups. Used 1/3 c. corn starch in place of the flour. Started out on low heat and slowly increased the heat until mixture thickened. Did not actually boil. Used about 1 cup of coconut (not toasted) in the pie.

i thought this was an amazing coconut pie. I followed some of the other suggestions and did 1 can cream of coconut(which came out to 1 1/2c) and 1 1/2 c half and half, 2 eggs plus one egg yolk and 1/2 c cornstarch and whisked the entire time it was heating...it got really thick with in 7-10 minutes..i think you would be fine with just the flour because it did get super super thick so i think flour may have been better. The taste was delicious tho.

This is the first Coconut Cream Pie I have ever made. I made this and three other pies for Thanksgiving at my sister-in-laws house and it was the hit of the dinner! The only thing different I did was use 1 1/2 cups of half and half along with 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk. And omitted the coconut extract.  Easy to make and delicious!!!

I LOVE this recipe although, I rated it a 5 but the 5 is for the modified version of the recipe.  I read all of the reviews and based on them, I replaced the 3 cups of half and half with 1 1/2 half and half and 1 1/2 coconut milk.  I also substituted the flour for 1/2 cup of cornstarch.  I missed out on the review that said use 1/3 cup, but it still turned out great.  I also made my own whipped topping with 1 carton of whipping cream and 1tsp of vanilla.  I used 3 1/2 tbsp of icing sugar because on its own it tasted a bit bland.  My husband is a huge lover of coconut cream pie and he loved this.  I didn't use the microwave but boiled the filling on med heat, constantly stirring and it took about 15 mins or so before it thickened.   All in all, great dessert.

Fabulous! I made this for when my Dad came to visit. Both him and my husband LOVED it. Definitely toast the coconut. But why go through all that and then use frozen, high fructose charged whipped "cream" topping? Just make your own, SO simple!   Dad later bragged to my sister that it was the best he had, and she had to have the recipe! Simple to make!  I used 1/2 C whipping cream, 1/4 C sugar, 1 t vanilla. Whip til stiff peaks form, and top the pie. Perfect!

Excellent, with the suggested changes of substituting coconut milk for half the cream, using cornstarch instead of flour, and topping with real whipped cream. Those make it a five-star recipe. Thank you!

This pie is a huge hit with my family.  My father makes me make it for every single holiday!  I use coconut milk in the filling, plus coconut extract to give it extra flavor.  It is SO good!

We ate the best homemade coconut cream pie that I've ever had. It was really quick too, I wasn't expecting how quick it would be to make. We put ours in a graham pie crust, and whipped up some real whipped cream to go with it.  Only reason it got four and not five was simply because the actual recipe needs to be changed, make sure instead of three cups of half-and-half, you use 1 1/2 cups half-and-half and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk.

Isn't it funny when people say "I followed the directions exactly, but..."  LOL  I am very guilty!  The only change I made in this recipe was that I used canned (rich) coconut milk instead of regular milk.  After pouring the filling into a pie crust I put it in the fridge overnight to set.  It set perfectly!  The only slight thing for me is that I wish it had just a little more coconut taste~ it's a tiny bit bland.  Next time I will add coconut extract instead of vanilla.

It's a fine tasting pie, but after all the reviews I was expecting a heavenly dessert.  It tastes like coconut milk and whipping cream.  Still yummy, but not as fantastic as everyone is saying.

I followed some of the tips given here i.e. coconut milk, cornstarch & it turned out ok. The consistency was a bit thick (next time I'll reduce the cornstarch) & the coconut taste was too subtle (I'll try the tip with the coconut extract as well). Otherwise, the recipe was foolproof & my girlfriend loved it :-)

omg .. This was THE BEST coconut cream pie I've ever made, and super easy, too! I'll never have to stock up on the instant pudding mix again! The only substitutions I made were using a whole package of the fresh frozen coconut in the filling instead of the sweetened cake-mix-aisle stuff, and used 1 whole can of coconut cream with enough half-n-half to make 3 cups. I had extra filling but it was delicious as a pudding for dessert. Definitely make your own fresh whipped cream (1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla). You can find the fresh frozen coconut in the freezer section of Asian grocery stores.

I'm giving it 5 stars, but have to admit to making a few changes... I used 2 cups coconut milk, 1 cup half and half, added an extra egg yolk, and substituted 1/3 cup cornstarch for the flour.  I think the recipe as stated would probably work great, I just used what was on hand and went for a super coconutty flavor. The key is in slowly boiling and constantly whisking...the consistency was great.

I made this pie for my dad, who is a coconut fien.  I made the recipe as is, I only added a few item as per the other reviews.  I added on can of coconut milk with the the half in half and 4 Tbsp of cornstarch.  It thickened beautifully!  I also added 2 tsp of coconut extract to the custard.  The custard was delicious!  I too made homemade whipped topping which just made the pie a sin to eat!  My father loved it....he wouldn't leave without the rest of it in tow!

I did change this somewhat using suggestions from other cooks and some of my own. I did use a can of ethnic coconut milk, using the half & half to make the 3 cups called for. I used frozen fresh  I used one egg plus two yolks and the 1/3 cup of cornstarch. I microwaved the mixture for 6 minutes, stirring every 1:00 the first 3 minutes, then stirring every 1:30 twice. (My microwave is old and slow.) The custard was hot, but not thickening. I was impatient so I poured it into a saucepan over medium-high heat. Within two minutes, the custard thickened, I reduced heat to medium-low heat and stirred for another 3 minutes - so thick the whisk left "trails" and silky smooth! I removed it from the heat and added the coconut (more than the recipe called for) and poured it into my shell. Using the microwave certainly saved time for me, but didn't do the full job - It was easier than stirring for 25 minutes over a hot stove as some cooks did! I had more than filled a 9" pie crust, so put into cups for my little ones.

I thought I didn't like coconut cream pie until I had this and went crazy for it.  A little time consuming but worth it for the flavor and accolades.

Great recipe!  I tried using the coconut milk, but prefer to use cream. I use 1/3 cup corn starch instead of flour. Also, I put in 1 tsp. coconut extract. It sounds unusual, but we love to serve ours with a raspberry sauce and of course a dollop of real whipped cream. It is so yummy!

Really delicious and much easier than I imagined! I took the recommendations of using a can of coconut milk and then enough half and half to make 3 cups. I also substituted the cornstarch. Will absolutely make again!

Oh.my.goodness.  If you are a coconut lover, this is absolute heaven. I only did two small things different. 1) I added half teaspoon of coconut extract, half teaspoon vanilla. 2) I shaved some frozen chocolate on the top. Even without these additions, this pie would have still been great.  Oh, and by the way, if it's possible-this is even better the next day. YUMMO !

My first time making a real homeade pie. I went exactly by the recipe. I wish now I would have looked at the reviews before because once the custard was done it tasted like flour. This was also for my husbands birthday which is tomorrow and now I have to go out and by a Marie Calendar coconut cream pie. Could it be that I didnt sift the flour when adding it? It didnt say to and I did go exactly by the recipe here. Stood over the stove for 30 minutes stirring until I got a light boil and it was thick.

Very good pie! I made this coconut cream pie & french silk pie to take to my parents & bf's parents houses (we had separate father's day celebrations - one last night & one today). While every bit yummy, I found this to be a bit sweet for my tastes.... Per the suggestions of fellow reviewers, I tried locating fresh (frozen) shredded coconut. To my dismay, I couldn't find any, sooo I was forced to use the dried sweetened stuff found in the baking aisle (argh!). Fresh coconut would have produced a less sugary pie (I'll definitely use fresh next time...). I pretty much followed Carol's directions to a T, except for the following: a) per SHEA1228, I used an entire can of Goya coconut cream (I tried to find coconut milk at 2 stores with no luck) & enough 1/2-1/2 to equal 3 c., used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs & subbed cornstarch for flour, b) cooked everything in my dbl. boiler, whisking constantly (it took ~ 15-20 min. to reach a thick, pudding-like consistency), & c) poured the pie filling into a pre-baked pie shell, let it "set" in the fridge overnight (to firm up a bit), then, this AM, topped w/ Cool-whip (I know, I know... it's not the "real" stuff) & shredded coconut that I toasted (on low heat) in a skillet on the stovetop. Coconut cream is my bf's father's FAVORITE pie - and he absolutely LOVED this!!!! To not like this pie is just plain wrong!!!! I still prefer Edward's pie (find it in your grocer's frozen sect.), but this is a nice sub. Thx. for sharing Carol :)

I wasn't overly impressed with this pie which was surprising given the number of excellent reviews.  The only change I made was in using coconut milk as suggested by other reviewers.  I think I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Look no further for REAL coconut cream pie. I used others suggestions (half coconut milk, cornstarch instead of flour, and real whipped cream).  I also added 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract because I had it on hand.  It was super easy to make in the microwave and came out thick and smooth after 5 1/2 minutes.  This goes in the permanent, tried and true recipe file.

I made this for my family. Everyone loved it! (It's hard to argue with sugar and cream mixed together.) I did use the suggestions: 1/3 C. corn starch in place of flour, and I didn't have half-and-half, so I used 1 1/2 C. heavy cream and 1 1/2 C. 1% milk. I also made my own whipped topping with cream, granule sugar and vanilla. Topped with toasted coconut and almonds, it was very presentable, but apparently not too pretty to eat.

My daughter wanted this as her "birthday pie."  It was FANTASTIC!!!  I did substitute a 13.5 oz. can of coconut milk and a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk for the half and half.  Otherwise, followed exactly.  My dad said it was "exceptional" and he has been a pie lover for 73 years!!  The custard was lovely and set up nice and thick, and not too coconutty, just right.  We topped it with light cool whip, and that was perfect, not too heavy. A keeper!

Update. I made this again for Christmas and this time I used half coconut milk and half of the half n half. It was so delicious. My family said it was the best coconut pie they have ever eaten. I made the butter flaky pie crust recipe (this site) to go with it (very good) and made the homemade whipped cream (this site) as well. It was simply heavenly! 

This is a very good recipe. I actually didn't have any half n half or heavy cream so instead I thought I would try it with what I did have...2% milk. I thought it might be a little bland, but it was actually very good. I added 1/4 cup more coconut than the recipe called for, and it was gobbled up quickly by the myself and the kids.

Yum...yum...yum. Fantastic recipe. Coconut cream pie is a favorite of my family. I usually buy them instead of bake them myself. No More! I followed Shea's suggestions and the pie was fantastic. However, there was enough filling to make a deep dish pie. I ended up with two 9" pies but my daddy got to take one home with a smile and he liked that :)

Wow!  This recipe was both easy and delicious.  I also did 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups half and half., and 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour.  I microwaved it, even though I was nervious about that.  It took about 5 minutes and I whisked it after every minute.  I topped mine with whipped cream, but I may do a meringue next time.  I am from Hawaii, so I know coconut, and this one is a keeper!  The best thing is, with a pilsbury ready made pie crust, it's a 10 minute recipe with a homemade taste!

We have a great story to share about this recipe.  My daughter just turned age 13 and decided to make her first pie "on her own" to surprise her dad.  Everything turned out great, but at the first taste, we all realized that McKenna had used 1/4 CUP of salt rather than 1/4 teaspoon of salt!  Other than that initial "bite" this recipe really tastes great - we plan to try it again!!!

I just made this pie today and was very impressed with how good it turned out.   I like my pies a bit richers, so added an extra egg, 3 tblsp. butter to the cooked custard, 2 cups coconut and a bit more sugar.   This pie is to die for!

I used 1/2 half and half and 1/2 Coconut milk. I also made the topping from beating 1/2 pint of whipping cream with 2 Tbs. powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract. My husband (who loves coconut cream pie) LOVED this recipe and says it is the BEST one he ever had!! Thank you so much for this recipe! It really made me look good :)

Fantastic recipe!  I made mine into banana coconut cream pie at my dad's request on Father's Day, by adding 2 sliced bananas to the pie crust.  I did use a homemade graham crust, as well I used 1/4 cup cornstarch instead of the flour.  (You only need 1/4 cup... cornstarch is double the power of flour)! Also used half coconut milk and half 1/2 and 1/2 cream. Didn't toast the coconut inside the pie, just on top.  Homemade whipped cream on top of course.  Great recipe!  I'm sure it will be requested again!

This is such a delicious recipe! I made it two days ago for Father's Day, because it's my dad's favourite dessert. I've never made a cream pie before, but I made a few changes and substitutions and it came out perfectly!

I didn't have half-and-half, so I used 1 can (1-1/2 cups) evaporated milk, plus 100 g of creamed coconut dissolved in 1 cup boiling water (as a substitute for coconut milk.) I used 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of the flour. I used 1 cup of unsweetened shredded coconut in the filling, and didn't bother toasting it.

Unlike others, I had no problem getting the filling to set; it came to a boil within 10 minutes, and I cooked it only about 30 seconds longer, just to make sure it was thick enough.

I used a frozen store-bought pie shell, and it was so shallow that the filling was enough for 2 pies, so I popped a second shell in the oven and filled it, too. Then I increased the whipped cream to 2 cups. Having two pies meant I could give one to my dad and keep one for myself and my roommate. Yummy!

A very, very good coconut cream pie!  So much better than that "instant" stuff they try to pass off as coconut cream.

Excellent - I did what others suggested and substituted 1/3 c. cornstarch for the flour, and I did half half & half and half coconut milk.  I think the only change I'll make next time is to use untoasted coconut (freezer section) inside the pie instead of toasted.

This is the best Coconut Cream pie I've ever had, most of the others I've tried use cornstarch, but the flour and tons of half & half make this the richest & creamiest ever.

This is a fabulous recipe! I followed the suggestion of other users and used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of half and half, as well as substituting 1/3 cup corn starch for the flour.  I also used real whipped cream lightly sweetened and flavoured with a teaspoon of coconut extract. The results were outstanding.  The taste, texture and eye appeal of this pie is unbelievable.  Sooooo good!!!  Also, I made the custard in the microwave, whisking after every minute for 7 minutes.  It was a breeze and turned out perfectly.

Very good!! This was my first time making a cream pie and the first one I made did NOT set up. Obviously it was because I didn't cook it long enough. Because thick tends to be ambiguous in its meaning, I think it should be specified that the cream filling should be cooked until it's the consistency of pudding. I used the microwave method the second time around and it came out beautifully. I also used 1 1/2 c. of coconut milk and 1 1/2 c. of half and half. If you're looking for added sweetness I would suggest using the coconut in the baking aisle. Thanks for such a yummy recipe!!

Amazing! This recipe is phenomenal. The only change I made was to use cake flour for a creamy consistency (1/2 C. + 1 Tbl.). I took other reviewers' advice and used a can of coconut milk for half of the milk; the remainder I used a lactose-free whole milk, and it worked just fine. It never boiled, but it did thicken up beautifully and I removed it from the heat when it seemed thick enough. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe--this is a keeper!

WOW!  This recipe was incredible!  I did 2 cups of coconut milk (light, once I got home, I realized that I got that one by mistake) and 1 cup of evaporated milk (what was I thinking at the store on Christmas Eve not to pick up half and half and only whipped creme??).  I used 1/2 c of corn starch instead of 1/3 like most people suggested (another accident) (I was following the recipe and subbing exactly on that one.)  It was VERY thick after about twenty minutes on the stove and I don't think it ever boiled, but it started to look like tapioca pudding and I was worried.  I took it off and poured it into my baked crust (fresh out of the oven! YIKES!) and into the fridge it went overnight.  I topped it with whipped cream (from this website) and toasted (a little too toasted...oops!).  I took some pictures of it and gave a piece to my hubby (who requested it) and he said it was better than his mama's!  YEAH!  GREAT recipe!  With all my "mistakes," it still turned out great!

This was the first time I have ever made coconut cream pie and after I made it, I was told it was the best coconut cream pie they ever had!  I followed some of the changes in the other reviews and it made all the difference. Will definitely make it again!

My first attempt at a cream pie. I read reviews and used half cream, half coconut milk, and coconut extract in the whipping cream(I used real whipping cream instead of cool whip). The whipping cream was divine! My only complaint, and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five was that the cream part wasn't sweet. Maybe I haven't had cream pie enough and it's not supposed to be sweet, but both my husband and I would have prefered something sweeter. Very good though!  It does take quite a while though!

pretty good. I like more coconut flavor. Next time I think I'll try some coconut extract in the filling. This was more of a vanilla cream pie with toasted coconut added.

THIS IS THE CLOSEST RECIPE TO MY SOUTHERN GRANDMOTHER'S PIE SHE USED TO MAKE. I DID FOLLOW OTHER USERS IDEAS USING EQUAL PARTS OF HALF N HALF AND COCONUT MILK. I ALSO ADDED AN EGG YOLK AND USED CORNSTARCH INSTEAD OF FLOUR USING 1/3 CUP.  THE OTHER DAY I ACCIDENTALLY USED HEAVY CREAM INSTEAD OF THE HALF N HALF AND ONLY HAD FLOUR SO I USED 1/2 CUP BUT TRIPPLED EVERY THING ELSE TO MAKE 3 PIES. WOW! WHEN IT WAS AT ROOM TEMP IS WAS SO CREAMY AND FULL OF COCONUT FLAVOR. I MAY DO IT THAT WAY AGAIN EXCEPT USE CORNSTARCH BECAUSE I COULD STILL TASTE A TINY BIT OF FLOUR BUT HARDLY AT ALL. THIS IS STILL THE BEST RECIPE I'VE USED! THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE! GOD BLESS!

I made this with the changes suggested by other reviewers:  substitute 1.5 cups coconut milk for the same amount of half-and-half, and cornstarch instead of the flour.  I tripled the recipe to make three pies at once, and made my own whipped cream.  I was a bit worried at first because the mixture was very liquid-y, but after about 10 minutes of stirring, it thickened almost all at once and started boiling.  The pies were wonderful -- light and summery tasting!

Very delicious, almost perfect. Filling cooked easily and had an excellent consistency.  Had a very good flavor, not overly coconut-ty. I would have like a little more coconut intensity, but I was the only one. We also used 1/2&1/2  and coconut milk, but did use the flour.  My grandmother did not want to toast the coconut, so we used  fresh untoasted.  We did not use a topping - just the filling in the pie shell with a little coconut sprinkled on top. Next time we will use the suggested cornstarch. Another thing I will do next time is chop the coconut shreds - not finely minced - just  a little less stringy.  This will definitely make it less chewy when using untoasted coconut and easier for the elderly to chew. I will make this recipe again.

This is the second time I have made this pie, it was very good the first time....but I made some changes the second time, and it was MUCH better!
I used 1.5 cups of 1/2&1/2, and 1.5 cups of coconut milk, I didn't toast the coconut I put IN the pie, I thought it tasted kind of bitter and chewy with it toasted.
The filling was way to much for one thin pie crust, it filled 2 of mine. I also added some coconut extract..(half coconut/half vanilla)
It was very good this time, but I think I need to add some more coconuty something-maybe add coconut extract into the homemade whipped cream?
Thanks so much for the recipe! We devoured it in seconds!

5 stars with other reviewers changes...I used 1.5 c coconut milk and 1.5 c half and half instead of 3 c half and half; I used 1/4 c flour and 1/4 c corn starch instead of 1/2 c flour; I used 1/2 tsp coconut extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of 1 tsp vanilla; and I used real whipped cream as I think cool whip is gross.  By the way, the custard thickened up way quicker than I had predicted (based on other reviewers). At the end of the day, rave reviews from all--they couldn't believe how good/light it was!

I made this for my Dad's Birthday as his favorite is coconut cream pie.  Everyone loved it!! I couldn't find "half and half" so I used "light cream" which is a mixture of milk and cream.  I also added extra vanilla and more coconut. I will DEFINITELY make this again!!

This pie was VERY yummy. I made the same changes as many others, with 1-1/2c cream + 1-1/2c coconut milk (i/o 3c half-n-half), 1/4c cornstarch, 1/4c flour (i/o 1/2c flour). I also added a bit more coconut flakes to the filling than called for. I used a baked oreo cookie crust (chocolate and coconut are pretty tasty together!!). Next time I'll use less flour since the filling was a bit thick.. not as creamy as I expected, but still, everyone raved about the pie. Definitely a keeper !!

Fantastic recipe! Creamy, with great subtle coconut flavor. I would recommend leaving the toasted coconut off the top until you eat each slice so it doesn't get too soggy. Also, the night I made it I wasn't too impressed with how it had turned out, but the next day it was absolutely perfect!

Fabulous!  This was my first cream pie and I'm so proud.  I followed the directions of other reviewers.  I did the 1/3 cup cornstarch and used 1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 half and half.  I used real whipped cream.  Why bother making a lovely cooked custard and then using Cool Whip?  The only things I did wrong was my pie crust shrunk into the pie plate and I added extra coconut (1/2 cup more) to the filling.  I thought "can't have too much coconut" but I found out you can!  Even with these mistakes, this is a beautiful and tasty pie worthy of any event!  If anyone can tell me why my pie crust shrunk, please let me know.  I did prick it all over with a fork as directed.

Made this for Thanksgiving and my Grandmother who is an AMAZING cook could not get enough of it and raved and raved.  She said it was just like her Mom used to make.  And that is a compliment in the highest form in my opinion.  Was perfect and not too sweet.  Used the home made whipped cream recipe on this site and it complimented it perfectly.  I am sure I will be asked to make this again next Thanksgiving.

This was absolutely the best pie I have ever eaten.  I fixed it for Thanksgiving and it was gone before any other dessert.  I was concerned about the flour taste when I made it but after sitting in the refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours it was great.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this last night for dessert, was told this was the best coconut cream pie ever.  I did follow the advice of other readers using 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk, used extra toasted coconut in the pie, used heavy whipping cream for the top and topped it off with cinnamon, white chocolate and more toasted coconut.  I also used a shortbread crust, YUMMY!  Will try to make this recipe with other fruit, very versatile.
Thanks Carol...making this one for Dad next!

My Dad loves coconut cream pie so I decided to make this for his birthday. I was really nervous because I had never made it before. I substituted 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of the flour, and heaped up on the coconut, and cooked it ina double boiler. MY DAD WOULD NOT STOP RAVING ABOUT IT!!! He absolutely loved it. He keeps on saying that it's the best pie he's ever tasted. In fact right now he's asking me to make it again! One of the things he loved about it is that it is firm and not at all runny. Definently worth your time, but MAKE SURE YOU USE 1/3 CUP CORNSTARCH INSTEAD OF FLOUR!!

I've made this 3 times this month, changing it each time! 1st I made banana cream pie, then coconut cream pie, and tonight with the addition of instant expresso powder and a bag of semisweet chocolate chips - voila! mocha cream pie! Ooooh sinfully rich!! The fresh whipped cream topping makes it even more decadent!! YUM!!  

I love the flexibility of this recipe, each time it was delicious, many compliments each time. 

Note: Use a double boiler - much quicker.

I am not sure what I do wrong with this recipe but I have tried to make it three different times and can never get it to stiffen up...the liquid has a good flavor but I can never serve it because it is just a pie shell with liquid in it...

Absolutely Fantastic. Took this to work and it was gone within minutes. I doubled this recipe, used 4 cups half n half and 2 cups whole milk, used the cornstarch instead of flour like others here suggested and added an xtra egg for good measure. I didnt toast the coconut , which I also doubled the amount, that I used in the pie. I did toast the coconut I put ontop of the whip cream. This pie takes a little time and effort but in the end it is well worth it.

This is a wonderful pie. Husband had two large pieces for breakfast. Used 2 cups half&half and 1 cup milk and 1/3 cup of cornstarch /no flour like others suggested. Also, used more coconut - brimming cup of coconut in the pie and a very generous amount on top. I stirred the filling for over an hour - switched to cooking on med-low to get it to boil. Figured I might as well make some homemade whipped cream. Thank you Carol.

Excellent pie - turned out perfectly and it really didn't take that long to make.  I did make some changes as per other reviews.  2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 cup milk, 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup cornstarch and used a deep dish pie shell and real whip cream for the topping. I would suggest that you puree in your blender the 1/2 and 1/2, milk, eggs, sugar, flour, cornstarch and salt as it makes the mixture lump free and seems to thicken faster.  P.S.  I used a whole 10oz bag of coconut - 3/4 quarter in the pie and 1/4 on top.  Not a real sweet pie (which I like) so if you want a sweeter pie I would use 1 cup of sugar.

I've been looking for a coconut cream pie recipe that would rival the one served at a local restaurant.  This was my first experiment and I believe I will stick with it, judging by how fast it was eaten.  It does tend to burn on the bottom (a double boiler or heat diffuser would help here) and I added more coconut at all coconut-adding opportunities, as well as more whipped topping.  But is it quick and easy and very delicious.

I made this for my adult daughter's birthday since it's her favorite pie.  It went over very well with everyone.  I took the advice of other reviewers and combine 2% milk and the half and half to make it less dense.  I also used a merangue topping which I baked (after the pie was in refrigerator for 4 hours) topped with coconut for the toasted taste and look.

Absolute best coconut cream pie I've ever eaten.  Everyone loved it!!!  Truly tastes home-made.  You can definitly tell a difference from the boxed pudding pie.  Only one problem I've found.  While you are stirring the mixture waiting for it to bubble, it always scorches on the bottom, no matter how hard I try to prevent it.  Just be really careful, and if it does scorch, don't scrape the bottom and it should still be o.k.  Also, it tends to be a little runny sometimes, I like to add half the recomended amount of flour, and the other half in cornstarch.  This is good if you like a thicker filling.  All in all, a great pie!!!

I was looking for a truly homemade coconut cream pie for our church dinner and found this.  It was so delicious, that I had to make another to keep at home.  I tried it using fat free half and half and couldn't tell the difference.

This is a simple, delicious pie.  I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, which complemented it well.  I just sprinkled coconut on top instead of using whipped cream- which I didn't miss at all.

This is the second time I have made this pie. It's really easy and delicious! I have a few suggestions. Beat the eggs well. Use a small whisk. Also, sift the flour before adding it. When I began adding the flour, it was lumpy. I used a sifter to remove the lumps. I sifted the rest of the flour and added it gradually. The lumps may have dissolved eventually but I think it's better to avoid the problem. The mixture took over an hour to get warm. I kept turning the heat up. I ended up cooking it on medium heat and it finally thickened and boiled. Lastly, I used a ready made shortbread pie crust from Keebler. I also make the whipped cream.

Best pie ever.  Like others, we used 1/3 cup of cornstarch in stead of flour. Also used 1 can of Thai Kitchen unsweetened coconut milk along with 1 and half cup of Half & Half. Also added 1 tsp of coconut extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Used 2 egg yolks plus 1 egg.  Absolutely best ever and we will be making this wonderful pie again.

I seriously can't imagine a coconut cream pie being more delicious. ******* Or EASIER ******* And I've had coconut cream pie all over the world. Plus I live in Texas so we have them in diners all over the state. I've had a lot of pie to compare. 

I put all the ingredients except coconut in a pot, turned to med-high and whisked like crazy. 15 min later it was thick and ready for the coconut. I also toasted the coconut right next to the custard on another burner while I was whisking.

I mixed in 1/8 cup toasted coconut + 1 cup of not-toasted coconut. Poured all that into a shell and put in fridge until morning. Whipped some cream and sprinkled with toasted coconut.  

OMG!!!  The thickness, the mouthfeel, the taste.....Unbelievable and a pure shame that I haven't made it before being 52 yrs old. I will take it to parties from now on, with the recipe written so that people can spread this one around. 

I used coconut cream instead of milk. It's right next to coconut milk at the grocery. A can is 2 cups so I also used 1 cup half-and-half. I also did the 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour. And added 1 extra yolk. Basically combed the reviews for the OMG reviews. My husband and both stepsons had it for breakfast. We are major foodies in this household and all 3 cleaned their plate. 

Oh, for pie #2....I omitted all coconut and used 3 cups heavy cream + 1/2  bag of chocolate chips. It 
made a gorgeous chocolate pie, very firm. 

Now I just need to get my pie crust game on.

Followed video instructions exactly, but still had lumps of raw flour that no amount of mixing and constant stirring could fix. Texture was too lumpy and flavor was a bit bland. It also didn’t set properly. Next time, I will add a little less flour and maybe add the milk after the flour.

Made this for my fiance for father's day. 
Lets just say i was able to grab 2 slices before it was gone ... IT WAS GREAT! 
I added a bit more vanilla and previously ive added other extracts.
It set fine for me, the trick is cooking till its pudding like, then it chill perfect. You are making a custard not a soup. 
I think next time i may try with coconut milk.

I followed these changes: substituted 3 cups of half & half with 1 1/2 cups half & half and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk, substituted flour with corn starch, and opted to microwave the filling instead of on the stovetop. I was a bit apprehensive to cook it in the microwave, but believe me...IT WORKED!!!  So much easier and faster!  THIS PIE WAS AMAZING!!!

I did what others say with the coconut milk and 1/2 & 1/2 and added an extra yolk. I also mistakenly went against my gut and microwaved for 6 minutes stirring every minute. This pie did not set.  So After making a home made crust, toasting fresh coconut and putting it all together - it was a fail.  I bake all of the time - failing is not in my nature and this sucked.  The taste of the filling was very good. I guess we can drink it for my mom's birthday tonight.  Now I gotta go buy one. :(

First, I have a home cottage business, licenced with the State of Texas for a "home based bakery".     Been in business for over two years.    I just made this recipe, followed it to the letter.........this was BY FAR, the worst tasting and consistency coconut cream pie I've ever eaten!    The flour is WAY over powering , the mixture thickened but never really boiled as the recipe states........would be VERY easy to over cook this as written.     No thank you, there is MUCH better out there!

The same recipe in the all recipe magazine says 
 1 1/2 cup half n half and also 1/3 cup corn starch. Maybe that is why the pie isn't working with the 3 cup half and half. Will make soon with magazine recipe. Thanks!

Cannot BELIEVE this recipe!!! Don't pass it up & take the advice of many reviewers, subbing a can of coconut milk (1 3/4 c) in exchange for half & half (used 1 1/4c H&H to make 3c total). I used untoasted coconut in the filling & flour instead of cornstarch as I wanted the creamier texture typical of homemade coconut pie. Added 1 egg yolk along with 2 eggs and true to form, it thickened so perfectly I only placed it in the fridge to cool. The taste is PERFECTION!!!

12/4/17: Made again! Reduced flour to 1/3c, as it was REALLY thick (almost sticky after refrigerating), used 2/3c sugar, increased coconut in mixture to 1c, toasting 1/4c for topping with same above referenced modifications. Definitely my preference for THE BEST coconut cream pie EVERRRR!!

I made one substitution recommended by other reviewers.  I used one can of coconut milk and half & half for the balance of 3 cups.  It was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't change anything and the pie was delicious! Only thing I would change is maybe use half of the whipped cream because the proportion of whipped cream to the actual filling was uneven; but either way, so good!

This turned out great, however I did a few modifications that's others recommended. I skipped the flour and used 1/3 cup cornstarch; just make sure to bring to a boil. Also, I didn't toast the coconut that hoes into the pie, just the topping, and I wish I would have toasted it all. The coconut inside the custard almost seems raw. Otherwise, it's perfect!!

This pie turned out wonderful.  Took the advice of some, using  1/3 cup of cornstarch, 1 1/2 Cups half and half, and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk.  Also used 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. coconut  extract.  Toasted all of the coconut.

I made the pie exactly as directed.  After 6 hours it was still not set and I needed it in another 2 hours so had to resort to "Plan B" either make another or buy one.  I noticed in this recipe it used the whole egg rather than just the yolk as most other recipe specify.  Is  that the problem why it does not set?  Anyway, I am not pleased.  Wasted some perfectly good ingredients .

I had to let is sit for longer than 4 hours to set up. I had to throw it in the freezer to help speed up the process, but man oh man it was good! I would make it again! It definitely has the "old fashion" flavor down pat. Thank you! Big Hit!

I make this every year and we LOVE it. I top it with merangue instead of whipped topping . This is just a preference of coarse.  I replace the half and half with heavy whipping cream and add another 1/2 tsp vanilla. I recommend using a heavy cast pan as this is definitely not for a general nonstick pan as it will stick easily.  Stir, stir, stir and stir to avoid sticking. Enjoy

This recipe actually deserves 100 stars. It was delicious and incredible. Even my picky husband loved it. I read the reviews and the changes I made were the following:

- used a 400ml can of coconut milk and one cup of half and half cream instead of all half and half cream
-used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs
-used 1/2 cup cornstarch instead of flour
- made my own whipping cream

Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I don't think they were just being polite... it was actually really, really good. I was afraid it would be too sweet but the filling was just right.

I used some of the hints others had mentioned such as subbing 1 can coconut milk and then half and half to complete the 3 cups.  I also used almost 1/2 cup cornstarch for the flour.  Instead of using whipped topping or whipped cream, I used merengue II from this site and baked in the oven at 350 for 10 to 15 minutes.  It was just starting to turn a beautiful golden brown but any longer and the coconut on top would have scorched.

YUMMYLICIOUS!

Coconut cream is my most  favorite pie ever and I had never thought  to make it myself until I came across this recipe and thought I'd give it a shot. I made this pie last night and can't stop coming back for more slivers of this pure coconut bliss! Way better than any store brand or restaurant pie!  I did make a few slight changes, as suggested from some other member's reviews: I used half heavy whipping cream (1 1/2 cup) and half coconut milk (1 1/2 cup) instead of the half & half, I did not use flour (subbed 1/3 cup of corn starch instead) and I made homemade whipped cream, which is always my personal fav when it comes to whipped anything. (heavy whipping cream, confectioners sugar and vanilla extract). I did not notice it having any trouble setting or thickening. It was perfect after only 3-4 hours of chilling and ready to slice and eat! The ONE thing I would change next time I make this, would be LESS SUGAR. I feel it doesn't need as much as the recipe calls for and could easily be lessened to your liking.

This was a hit at our last get together with friends.  I made it twice and tweaked the recipe based on other reviews and my own preferences.  Instead of 3 cups of half and half, I used one can of coconut cream plus half and half to equal 3 cups total.  It was roughly 1 cup of coconut cream and 2 cups of half and half.  I also substituted cornstarch for the flour (be sure to whisk the cornstarch with the half and half prior to heating to prevent lumps), and used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs.  Last thing - since the coconut cream is sweet, I used less sugar (somewhere between 1/2 a cup and 1/3 of a cup).  I topped it with fresh whipped cream sweetened with a touch of sugar and topped it off with toasted coconut!

Insted of cooking for 2min i cooked longer untill thick . If you dont cook it longer it wont become firm. So follow the recipe but when it says 2 min cook it longer until thick because in my experince it did not get firm when cooked for only 2 min.

I followed recipe word for word and didn't change anything. It turned out perfect. Just make sure you turn oven burner on Low (about 2 or 3 on old ovens with numbers). And bring to boil make sure you stir constantly it will thicken last time I made it, it took about 20-30 minutes before it got to a boil and thickened. I've made it about 3 times now and loved it each time. It's so sweet and good, definitely will make again in future for myself or a get together

Oooooooooh so yummy!  I'm very picky about my Coconut cream pie and like it to taste like the pies I had as a little girl.  When I was prego I had cravings for this exact pie and, after lots of searching, and testing, found this one.  It's PERFECT!! I din't change anything and it came out creamy and light.....and not too sweet!  LOVE IT!!

I substituted 1 can of cream of coconut and enough half and half  to make up three cups rather than using 3 cups of milk.  I also substitutes cornstarch instead of flower.  I have made this pie 4-5 times per year since I first tried it in 2012.  Everyone LOVES it!  :)

I used unsweetened coconut (that's what I had) and I didn't have half and half so I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups regular milk. Instead of cooking on the stove, I microwaved it, stirring every minute until it thickened. I also added an extra egg yolk and used 1/2 cup cornstarch, as recommended in some of the other reviews. It came out wonderfully thick. The flavor is pretty subtle, so I liked it best without whipping cream on top in order to actually get the flavor of the pie.

Amazing! My husband has been asking for coconut cream pie for weeks. Finally made it and it was a huge success. My husband didn't even want to share it. Will be making this again in the future. Thank you for the recipe. 
I read the reviews; for those that didn't set, my guess is you didn't allow it to thicken before removing it from the heat. I stirred constantly at low/medium heat. Allowed it to thicken then removed from heat adding coconut and vanilla. Try that next time.

I only gave this 4 stars,  because if you are really making a good coconut cream pie, don't put whipped topping on it, take the time and make meringue, like a real coconut pie should have on it.

Didn't change a thing!  I made this upon my son's request for Thanksgiving last year and he's begged me to make it all year.  Definitely worth all the "elbow grease"!

have made this pie several times, it is a big hit with family and friends. followed the suggestions of others, comes out great using corn starch instead of flour, and 3 egg yolks instead of two eggs.  also used one cup of coconut cream, two cups half and half.  i think you could reduce the sugar a bit, it is very sweet.   a definite keeper!

This pie is perfect with the addition of coconut milk split with the half/half.  The key is to keep stirring continuously, for 20 minutes.  It will take almost to the second for the filling to begin to bubble.  I listen to a 10 minute song twice to get through it, but the end results are far worth the time and effort it takes to keep the filling from burning.  I've made it for Thanksgiving for a couple years now and plan to continue the tradition going forward!  Great recipe!

Very basic Coconut Cream pie with nothing too fancy. I made a coconut whipped cream to top it because the restaurant I work at didn't like the way the toasted coconut looked on it. I also brushed the bottom of my pie crust with coconut milk before baking it to add a little more depth. 

The base itself needed a little thickening when I made it so I added about 1 TBSP cornstarch mixed with 1/4 C water (a slurry) once the mixture was boiling. It thickened up beautifully and held together when it was served!

Following the recipe as is it's a strong four stars, but with some minor adjustments it is easily one of the best recipes I've found and everyone's always pining for it. This really needed a more prominent coconut flavor, so I used 1.5 cups coconut milk and 1.5 cups half-and half. I also used 1/2 a teaspoon of coconut extract and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

The filling is very creamy, almost custard-like. It holds up well when sliced, but if you're looking for an even thicker filling I'd add an additional egg yolk; for a lighter one fold in a cup of homemade whipped cream.

This was a big hit in my home.  Next time though, I want to use a can of coconut milk in place of some of the half and half like other reviewers suggested.  Delicious recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I made it exactly as 'H' described in ther rreview below and    
 used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of half & half.  I used flour and not corn starch.   It took 25 minutes, but it got thick and perfect.

LOVED this recipe! I made two - one exactly as written and another using a gluten-free graham crust, coconut milk and almond milk in place of the half-and-half, and a gluten-free mixture of flour in place of the flour. We loved them both! And it was a nice surprise for our gluten-free guests! I did add some coconut flavoring - we love the stronger coconut taste.

I'm not fond of coconut, but my wife loves coconut cream pie. So, I decided to try this recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written, you don't have to stray from this. I tasted the custard while it was still warm, it was very good.  I served it the following day as a after dinner desert, she absolutely loved it, all I kept hearing is Oh my gosh this is delicious, you have to bake this one again. She is probably the most critical judge of deserts, so to get that response is a 5-STAR all on its own.  Thanks for a magnificent recipe to keep.

Wonderful, just finished serving dinner and dessert to the family and this dessert was loved by all.  A really nice home made flavour.  I took the advice of others and used 1/2 coconut milk and the other 1/2 regular 1% milk.  I used the microwave to cook the filling and used the technique of stirring it every one minute.  It took me a good 7 minutes to get this filling to the right consistency, watch the last two minutes of it.  Topped off with true whipped cream goodness.  Mmm good.  I will definitely make this again.  I used a store boxed pie crust.  Turned out better than I had thought.

I made the recipe as directed except for the topping and it was delicious. (I don't like Cool Whip so I made whipped cream.) I was concerned that it wouldn't set when I poured it into the pie shell but it set perfectly. I heard nothing but positive comments on it and I personally couldn't get enough of it.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe except I used half coconut milk and half half and half. It thickened up perfectly and I let it sit overnight in the fridge. Next time I'll be using coconut extract instead of vanilla as the coconut flavor was very subtle. My husband thought it was perfect though. Also didn't have room to top it with whipped cream and it still tasted great.

Calling all coconut lovers! This pie is, as the young children say, "Off the chart!" Excellent pie. Plus this pie was so easy to make. It disappeared as fast as I put it on the table to serve.

I just made this pie today and I'm on my 2nd piece already! I took the suggestions of others and used 1.5 cups coconut milk and 1.5 cups half&half, and I used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 whole eggs. I also used the microwave method as some people suggested, and it was ready in exactly 7 minutes (whisking every minute). I will DEFINITELY be making this pie in the future!

I followed the suggestion of others and used half coconut milk and half sweet cream(we dont't have half and half in central america) and the pie turned our perfect. plenty of flavor and thickens up very well. The reviewers who complained about it not thickening probably didnt cook the custard long enough.
If you want a creamy pie this is it!

This coconut cream pie is absolutely perfect as stated! This is my Husband's favorite and he often requests it...even in the dead of winter! As with all custard based pies, I would chill overnight before topping with the cool whip/ whipped cream and serving. I have had excellent results at the 4 hour indicated time, but it always sets up firm if I chill it overnight. Whenever I serve this pie I am given rave reviews and seconds are always requested!

Well I tried this recipe with changes to coconut milk and we were disappointed at how grainy it was.  We will make it the original way next time.

I had never made a coconut creme pie. My dad requested one as a gift, and let me tell you, he's a pie junkie and critic. No joke, he says this is the best he had ever had, and trust me, he'd be truthful about it. Swears its better than anything he ever bought at a bakery. Only thing I changed along with a couple other people, use 1.5 cups milk and 1.5 cups coconut milk. Perfect!

Just made this Awesome pie for my Boyfriend as a Birthday pie and He is willing to fight to keep it all to himself !!
I did not use the flour but sub it with the Corn Starch took less time to thicken the filling and I also used the coconut milk made the filling taste like coconut  , and I hope all who try this one don't cook the frozen coconut flakes add to filling as is it's MMMM . For topping I bought a large cool whip used half the tub and an 8oz cream cheese and added 1 tsp Vanilla Extract the real stuff and electric mixer and added the toasted frozen coconut on top!! This pie reminds me of my GrandMother and her baking when I was a little Girl .   Good luck to you all with this one and thanks to the ones who put their ideas In this .....

Oh my goodness, is this an amazing pie.  You know it's good when there is none leftover!  My Father-In-Law is a Coconut Cream Pie connoisseur and he had two slices!  I made this with the coconut crust listed elsewhere and it was great.  My changes are that I (accidentally) purchased grated coconut instead of flaked, and that worked fine.  I did all unsweetened coconut and it made for a tasty and refreshing pie rather than too sweet.  I did as other reviewers suggested and did half coconut milk and half 1/2 & 1/2.  Then I did three egg yolks and a 1/3 cup cornstarch (also mentioned elsewhere).  Finally, I used my microwave like someone else said and it was awesome.  It ended up taking my little 700 watt microwave 7 or 8 minutes to get the right consistency (stirring every minute).  And last piece of advice, DO NOT use purchased whip cream.  Get out your whippers and just make it.  This pie deserves fresh whip cream.

Used the coconut milk + whipping cream, subbed in 1/3 c cornstarch as many suggested.  

I think the people who are complaining about it not setting are not heating it gently for long enough -- it should be basically thickened all the way BEFORE you take it off the stovetop...  heating the flour/cornstarch activates it to thicken.  

FANTASTIC recipe -- can't wait to make it for friends!

I made this pie for the first time during the holidays; and will be making it again for Easter dinner.  An easy pie to put together and loved by all the coconut crazies in my family.  This pie is very sweet, but quite tasty.

This was a lovely pie.  It was moist and just the right consistency. It was all eaten in no more than three days after it was made. :)

I used 1 cup canned coconut milk, and 2 cups half and half, and otherwise followed the directions exactly. Absolutely stunning pie!
So creamy, and delicious. I had no issues with it firming up like some people did, but most of those people seemed to be using corn starch instead of flour.

The best I've ever made!  I'm an impatient cook so I probably used a little too high of heat but I could just whisk every once in a while to smooth out the cream.

This pie was great! I did use a can of coconut milk + the 1/2 n' 1/2 equalling 3C. total to make a bigger coconut flavor. Fresh whipped cream was decadent on this pie!

This was so good!! I had coconut left over from Holiday baking and was looking for something to make to use it up. I used 1/2 teas vanilla and 1/2 teas coconut flavoring. Also I didn't have half and half in the house so I used skim milk thinking that that would not work out, but OH MY GOODNESS, was it ever yummy! It was still firm enough to suit me. My husband and I swooned over it. I will be making this over and over.

We loved this recipe. My children have milk allergies so I substituted 1 1/2 cups coconut crème(refrigerated the full fat coconut milk and skimmed off the cream that rose to the top)and 1 1/2 cups rice milk for the half and half. I also used turbinado sugar instead of white sugar.  It firmed up nicely.  This is going to be a holiday, special occasion staple in my house.

I think overall the idea is great. I did use a few alterations that the other reviewers suggested. I only used sweetened, toasted Coconut for the top (which was real whipped cream made from Heavy Cream, Vanilla Extract and Confectioners Sugar), natural unsweetened Coconut for the inside, 3 egg yolks instead of the 2 eggs, 1/3c cornstarch instead of flour, 1 can cream of Coconut (about 1 1/2 cups), and 1 1/2 cups half & half. I also used the microwave suggestion, which was 8 minutes in the microwave, whisking after each minute. The Coconut flavor and consistency were great. For me though, it was WAY too sweet. I think next time I will try it with only 1/2cup of sugar instead of 3/4cup. I will definitely make this again!

The first time I have ever made a "pudding" from scratch and it was FANTASTIC!!  I followed a couple of other reviews.  I toasted 1 Cup of coconut, but used untoasted INSIDE the pie.  I also added 1 tsp of coconut extract and used 1/3 C of corn starch instead of the flour.  I made homemade whipping cream to top it with, then sprinkled the toasted coconut on top.  My best friend actually stabbed her husband with a fork when he tried to get another bite...LOL  It was the first pie gone after Thansgiving dinner!!  After that, everyone SETTLED for pumpkin or chocolate :D  I'm making another one today, just to satisfy everyone before they go back to work and school!  ENJOY!!

Anyone who had problems with this recipe needs to try again!  Make sure you bring the mixture to a boil!  This is a delicious pie and so very easy to make.  I've been making this for 3 years at the restaurants I work, and have worked at.  It's a HUGE hit!! The only things I changed were using half vanilla, half coconut extract and I add a little more coconut than called for!

I have impressed the pants off my family! I used a Mrs. Smith's pie crust. Easy to make, spectacular results. Thanks for sharing!

Update Nov 2015 idk why anyone would change this recipe. Just follow the directions already and you'll have excellent results. I really don't understand the "tweaking" some "reviewers" insist on making to someone else's great recipe. Write your own and let us be the judge of your version.

I made this the other day and it did not set at all! I still gave it a 2 because the pie still tasted good. I'm going to use cornstarch instead of flower next time like some of the other reviews said and see if it works. If it does then I do think this recipe will be a keeper after all.

This was the first coconut cream pie I ever made and it turned out fantastic.  It was a hit at the dinner party I brought it to.  I made changes, some that were recommended by others: made my own graham crust using graham crumbs, melted butter and also added about 1/4 cup toasted coconut into the crust.  I added 1 1/2 cups half and half and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk.  I added an extra egg yolk to ensure firmness (based on what others wrote).  I topped it all with fresh whipping cream I whipped, adding in a tsp of coconut flavouring and some icing sugar to sweeten it a bit.  Topped it all off with the toasted coconut.  Also, I cooked it in the micro as per others had suggested....much easier this way!!!  All in all....a real winner.....have already made it again with great success.....

Rave reviews at my Soda Shop Themed Party. I don't think anyone took a breath from when the pie was put in front of them until it was gone.

Som subs... I didn't have half and half, so I used 2 cups whipped cream, 1 cup skim, and half a package of coconut cream powder - stuff I normally use to bump up the coconut flavor my curry. 

Comments were helpful to know I didn't have to cook it at LOW heat. After 10 mins I cooked it at medium low heat with a whisk to prevent lumps. Highly suggest using a whisk over a wooden spoon at medium low heat from the get go.... keep stirring or you'll get weird bumps in your filling. After measuring, sift your flour again to avoid bumps.

Used smoked sea salt instead of salt and vanilla bean paste instead of extract so there'd be the pretty speckling of vanilla beans in the custard.

For the topping I used another reviewer's suggestion... 1 cup fresh whipping cream milk and beat it with generous vanilla (2 table spoons), and 3 tablespoons of icing sugar.  A big piping star to make pretty tufts on the top before topping with the last bit of toasted coconut.

Wildly successful. Just sit back and soak up the praise now.

This is a very good recipe, but I would probably either add more coconut or coconut milk the next time. If you're not expecting a huge coconut flavor and more of a custard flavor, it's fine. I made mine with whole milk since I didn't have half-and-half, but it set just fine.

I tried this recipe but instead of adding 3 cups of half & half I  added 2 1/2 cups and then added 1 1/2 cups of creamed coconut that I made from scratch from my Omega Juicer.  Yes, it the best if you love coconut.

This recipe was easy and absolutely amazing!  I did not read comments before I made the pie, so I made it exactly as the recipe prescribes...except I forgot the vanilla extract.  Fortunately, it tasted delicious without it.  I did cook the cream at a higher temperature, and for at least 20-25 minutes to make sure it was thick.  Again, I have saved this one to the recipe box and will make it again and again.

This is truly a wonderful, old-fashioned pie. I changed it by substituting corn starch for flour, but everything else the same as written.  Not over the top sweet, just right.  Thank you for this classic recipe Carol.

Really great recipe...after I made some of the changes that other folks have  written about below (hence the four stars). Instead of using all half and half, I used one cup of coconut milk. I also swapped cornstarch for the flour. I was really scared when I was making this because it started getting lumpy, regardless of the fact that I was mixing it the entire time! I also freaked out when it was multiple colors in my fridge after 5 hours...alas, when I woke up in the morning to check on it--it was fine! Everyone in my family loved this pie as well :)  I also made my own whipped cream to top it instead of using the frozen kind.

I disagree with the negative reviews wholeheartedly. I made this for our first married Thanksgiving this year because my father-in-law and husband absolutely love coconut cream pie and I had yet to find one that's up to scratch because I'm very picky about my pie :) Being our first time hosting Thanksgiving, I was nervous but this pie was PERFECT. This is it! It is by far one of the easiest cream pie recipes I've tried, and set up beautifully. My husband loved it so much I'm making him another right now! I did add a little more coconut, because I love coconut, and I used a graham cracker crust and topped with fresh homemade whipped cream. The pie was gone in a second! Make it! Make it now!

This pie is perfect! So easy to make especially if you use store bought pie crust (occasionally I do). I did use coconut extract instead of vanilla to really give it that coconut flavor. Tomorrow I am making it again but adding a layer of bananas. Yummmmmm.

I did as the other reviewers recommended and used 1 can of cream of coconut (about 1 cup) and enough half and half to amount to 3 cups (about 2 cups) . Switched out the flour for cornstarch and followed the remaining directions as written. This was delicious! Picky 5 star restaurant boyfriend Loved it. Thank you.

Ummmm, yeah.  THE BEST coconut pie ever.  I have made this pie several times per other reviewers.  I also used 1 can of coconut milk, and then enough half & half to make 3 C.  I used half of a large bag coconut, toasted. Also, used cornstarch instead of flour.  
Made this for a friends b-day b/c it was his favorite pie, everyone raved!  I have requests to make for all of there bdays now as well!

This was a great recipe !!!!
This was the very first time I ever made a coconut creme pie. Guess what, first time I ever ate some too.... YUMMMM!!!! I followed advice of others and made some substitutions. Still giving 5 stars though .I skipped half and half and used cocunut milk 1/2 cup and coconut water 1/2 cup. I also used more coconut (1-1/2 cups). I also used cornstarch. It doesn't get lumpy with this. I used 2 whole eggs plus 1 yolk. I also used 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I tried the recipe cooking on top of the stove and no matter how much I strred it still stuck to the pan and I was afraid the taste would go through the pie (it was still good) I SERIUSLY recommend using the microwave skip stove completely. I put all ingredients in the bowl and mic'd for 2 minutes a pop then stirred after ever 2 minutes.  Because I was paranoid I cooked for 10 minutes. 8 is probably fine just keep strring. When done go right to the pie shells because if you cooked it right it will begin to set in the bowl and you don't want that. Iwill definitely make again. I had a bake sale at church and after one sample they wanted a whole pie ! AWESOME !!!
One sure thing to do is make your own whipped cream. It Is The Best!!!  I am so impressed.

So far so good. I tried this once before, but it never set and came out soupy.  2nd time was the charm. i switched out the flour for corn starch but only a 1/3 c.  I cooked it on the stove stirring until it started to get thick like pudding.  I didn't cook it that long before. Seemed to do the trick.  I haven't tried it just yet though, it looks wonderful and it set.

This pie is amazing!!! It is light and creamy.  Full of flavor.  I did also use the 1/4 cornstarch instead of the flour and also 1/2 and 1/2 on the vanilla and coconut extract.  I also used the can of coconut milk and finished it witht he half and half for the 3 cups of milk.  Diffenantly a keeper.

The recipe was decent, but not my favorite pie.  I followed other people's advice and used corn starch instead of flour and also used coconut milk.  I let it cook for about 25 mins, until it got really thick.  Then it seemed kind of starchy in terms of the flavor.  I might try again and use less corn starch and add back in some flour next time.

Whenever I make this pie, people comment that it is the best coconut cream pie they've ever had.  The only change I made (which I do for everything that calls for vanilla) was to add extra vanilla.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

There isn't much I can add than what has already been said. I read through many different recipes and this seemed the best. I would recommend anyone sort the reviews by the "most helpful" and use SHEA's 3rd time is a charm additions and substitutions. That specific altered recipe came out FABULOUS. The only thing I did different was use an Italian meringue for the top. It worked well since i was using the 3 egg yolks in the pie and had 3 whites left over. 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and then boil a simple sugar of 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water with a dash of the imitation coconut flavor. Topping was perfect.

followed other reviewers to use corn starch in place of flour. Also used pre-made graham cracker crust and canned, sweetened coconut. Took forever to thicken (not even certain if it boiled, but it did thicken), but tasted great!

This is the best ever. Use the other cook's tip. Replace flour with cornstarch and do 5-1 minute increments in the microwave, whisking vigorously in between.  Use 1 can of coconut milk and make up the difference with 1/2 & 1/2. Unsweetened coconut is better but if you can't find it, lightly toast the sweetened flakes first.  My southern born husband raves. Says it's a good as grandma's...music to my ears.

Loved the custard part of this recipe.  I followed some of the reviewer's advice and used cornstarch instead of flour and subbed some coconut cream instead of all the half & half.  I wish I would have used cool-whip.  The recipe someone put for whipped cream basically just tasted like milk on top of this awesome custard.  I prefer my whipped cream a bit creamier tasting & more sweet.  I will tackle making a better whipped cream for my next pie!

After reading all the reviews, I used the following recipe:  1 1/2 c half-and-half, 1 1/2 can coconut milk, 1/3c cornstarch, 2 eggs, 3/4c sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1c flakes (1/4 toasted for topping, 3/4 for cream fililng), and I forgot to use the 1tsp vanilla.  I made my own graham cracker crust and whipped topping in previous reviews.  The flavor of this pie was delicious, but my filling was still very runny and soupy; not firm like the recipe or reviews stated.  I wonder where I went wrong?  I made it in the microwave for 5 min stirring after every min.  I would make this pie again though, but maybe next time make the filling on the stove as originally called for.

This was my first attempt to make a cream pie. It turned out perfectly and was delicious. I wanted to try the coconut milk rather than all half and half, but could not find it at the store near me. I subsituted a can of coconut juice using 1 C with 2 C of half andf half. I also used 1/3 C cornstarch rather than flour as others suggested. I topped it with real whipped cream that I also made myself.

This pie was DELICIOUS! My mother-in-law loves coconut, so I thought she would really enjoy this for her birthday and she loved it! I followed the recipe except for two small changes: I used 1/2 cup of corn starch as other suggested in place of the flour and added 1 tsp of coconut flavoring in addition to the vanilla. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing - absolutely wonderful coconut cream pie!

I gave this only 3 stars because it tasted too much like a pie you would find in a diner. We wanted something with more of a sophisticated coconut flavor. I thought the coconut flavor was overpowering.  Also, mine didn't set, but that could have been my fault.

For years, there was only one place that I could go and get the best Coconut Cream Pie...the Carnival Buffet at the Rio casino.  This recipe, with a few alterations, comes soooo close to that recipe.  I have made this pie three times.  The first time it was delicious, but too runny with the flour.  The second time, I used cornstarch, but it was too thick.  The third time I cut the cornstarch in half and it was perfect.  All three times, the flavor was dead on though.  Thank you so much for this excellent recipe.  It will be the base to all of my cream pies.

Made this today but the filling did not set and thicken up like it should have.  Taste is wonderful except next time I will follow other people's advice and add coconut extract...it would be better with a more coconut flavor.  Hubby said it was the best pie I ever made!!

Wonderful pie but good lord did it take forever for the filling to thicken :) My stove won't boil anything on low, after 20-25 minutes I bumped the heat up to 3 from 2 and not long after it started to look like pudding. Used 1 can lite coconut milk (measured 1 3/4 cup), 1 1/4 cup half and half. Took reviewers tips and did not toast the coconut for the filling and did use a small skillet to toast the coconut for the topping (how quick and easy)! I used 1/4 cup cornstarch instead of flour, may up that to 1/3 next time. It's been in the fridge for 2 hours and still not firm yet but didn't stop me from having a piece. Hope it firms up it tastes great! After cooking all day I did not want to hassle w/home made whip cream so (gasp) I used cool whip (oh no!), still a great pie, thanks! Update, it firmed up very well after a few hours, very nice texture.

Maybe it's not fair to rate this recipe because I did some changes just because I had the ingredients on hand, but here's what I did.  I used a premade graham cracker pie shell, and I used a can of unsweetened coconut milk, 1 cup cream of coconut  and 1/2 cup of whole milk.  I also tried cornstarch in place of flour.  Results.....YUMMY!!! Will make again.

WOW! this pie is delicious. I didn't even try it without first changing the recipie slightly. I double the recipie for two pies because my family loves it so much! I ABSOLUTELY DO use coconut milk! I can't imagine why you wouldn't. However like many have suggested I use 1/2 coconut milk. As for the other half of the liquid ingredients I prefer whole milk rather than half and half. Also, I do not toast the coconut that goes in the pie, only that which goes on top. And I don't add whip cream or meringue topping, only toasted coconut and when I'm making it for my mom I throw a handful of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips on top. Fantastic!!!

YUMMM! SO so so delicious, and easy as... errr... pie! I followed the tips others gave: use 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 cream; and of course topped with REAL whipped cream!  I'm not usually a big cream pie lover, but this one was superb.

I am not the best cook, but I do pretty well and my family loves my cooking!   This recipe was so simple!  Not too many ingredients and straightforward instructions.  And the end result was absolutely delicious!  I also followed the suggestions from other reviewers:  I used 1 1/2 cups of both coconut milk and half and half.  Substituted the flour with 1/3 cup of corn starch.  And substituted the vanilla extract with coconut extract.  I could only find the imitation coconut, and it worked fine.  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!!!

Awesome! Many thanks for a fantastic recipe that allowed me to 'wow' my new father-in-law this Thanksgiving. I really appreciate the suggestion to use cornstarch instead of flour, but found using heavy cream only, with no additional coconut milk/extract necessary to create a very well-received outcome.

Even though I'm a lover of coconut flavor, but not the texture, I was entrusted to make this beloved family favorite dessert. I followed the directions to a T and everyone raved about how this reminded them of Grandma's coconut cream pie. Being able to live up to Grandma's pie with this recipe is the ultimate compliment, cause let's face it, not much competes with anything Grandma's make!

AMAZING!!!  We did follow suggestions and made changes however it almost was a running flop but we poured the soupy mixture into a pot on the stove and within a couple minutes it was thick and perfect. The microwave suggestion did not work for me.  I would suggest following the recipe and cooking on stove.  I used 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 cup of half and half. Coconut extract instead of vanilla,  1/3 c cornstarch instead of flour and only toasted coconut on top the cocounut inside pie was not toasted.  I made homemade whipped cream with coconut extract instead of vanilla.  sooooo good.

Huge Coconut Cream Pie lovers here and this was yummy! I forgot to bake the crust prior to filling the shell but didn't realize this until hours later...oops I had to transfer the filling to a baked shell which was fine but probably would have been best if I hadn't made this mistake. Kept recipe as is but I did add a few drops of coconut flavoring. It's going on my Thanksgiving pie list!

I made this recently and used a graham cracker crust just because it was easier. The pie was good, really good. It was easy to make and tasted great. I may try it with real whipped cream next time but it is good with the cool whip.

If I could give this more stars, I would!  I made the pie as written with the sole exception of making a meringue, which I burned!  Not totally blackened  but quite brown.  The custard consistency was delicious and we agreed the pie was even better after being chilled overnight.  I cut it as soon as it got to room temp and as good as it was, it just got better when cold.  I have 4 requests to add this one to our Thanksgiving menu. Thank you for a lovely dessert!

Wonderful, first time I made it my husband ate the whole pie in one sitting.  He is very picky.  Then he raved about it to his family and he is one of those don't ask kind of guys...  Well I ended up making one for the family dinner and everytime I talk to my MIL she keeps saying I need another PIE!!!

This was ok.  I felt like it needed more coconut flavor. Maybe some coconut milk.  Just wasn't sweet enough.

BEST coconut cream pie ever!!!  My grandma would make coconut cream pie every year for the holidays, knowing how much I loved it.  I always looked forward to it.  I never thought to write the recipe down before she passed though.  I tried a few different recipes trying to get it like hers.  This is the one!  I get so many compliments on it. I always make my own whipped topping.  It's worth the extra few minutes.

Absolutely delicious....I have been trying to find a coconut cream/custard pie recipe for a while and i have tried many other recipes that require baking in the oven... this recipe is outstanding the custard was smooth and creamy, but not runny and the coconut flavor was tasty, but not over powering.  Everyone enjoyed this pie...i cant wait to make it again! I did however use some fo the changes previous reviewers had made: i used three egg yolks, i used 1 1/2 cups half and half and 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, i used a cup of finely shredded coconut in the pie, and used 2 tsp of vanilla, and 1/3 cup of cornstarch. cooking the custard did take a while so dont be concerned if it doesnt look the way you think it should after a while of stirring. Try this pie, you will love how refreshing and how simply superb it really is!

This is the first Coconut Cream Pie I have ever made.  This recipe is easy and I didn't change a thing.  It only took about 1 hour for it to set and then we dug in.  Absolutely delicious, I used a Pilsbury roll out pie crust..  5 Stars

This is a great recipe!!  To me, it is the perfect Coconut Cream Pie.  I'm sure the original recipe is delicious too, I did make a few changes after reading the reviews:  used 1can coconut milk and added enough hnh to make 3cups (great idea!) and used 3 egg yolks.  Followed recipe steps and really let it cook a few extra minutes till it was nice n thick!   I already have friends requesting it and I just made it last week!

I personally don't like coconut but this is my dad's favorite pie. I made it for Father's Day and everyone loved it. I to used 1 1/2 cups of half n half and 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk along with 3 egg yolks and instead of the flour 1/4 cup of cornstarch. I made whipped cream from this site. The pie looked beautiful and tasted great!

This recipe was good, however I was surprised to see frozen topping (oil) when the recipe is called "OLD FASHIONED" Coconut Cream Pie. I used fresh whipped cream, as they did in the old days.

Everyone liked this pie. Only thing i did different was use 1/3 cup corn starch instead of flour, also used whipped cream recipe instead of cool whip. It does indeed take some patience to whisk ingredients, I used my double boiler just because iknow i would become impatient, but it worked out fine, did need to whisk about 20 mins.

This pie is great! I did alter the recipe a little but mostly just for my taste, I did stick to the recipe the first time and it was great. When I altered the recipe all I did, I replaced the half and half with one can of coconut milk and one large can of evaporated milk, instead of flour I added 1/3 cup of corn starch( mix with a little water first for those who are new to the kitchen), I used just a little over 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract, a pinch or 2 of cinnamon, and 3 eggs plus 1 egg yolk, and 1 whole bag of coconut flakes. It made enough to fill 2 deep dish pie shells, which was what I was going for. Anyways I have been looking for a long time for a great recipe and this is the one, even if you don't alter it at all!!! My whole family thanks you, even my 3 year old, that hates coconut, loves this pie!

This is a great recipe as is. I didn't make any changes and it turned out perfect.  It is a light coconut pie but that is what is so good about it. It is not meant to be a heavy custard pie with a heavy overly manufactured coconut flavor.   Thanks for great recipe.  My family just loved it.

I made this for my husband on our anniversary, and he gave it 5 stars. He had been asking me to make a coconut cream pie for some time, so I thought it would be a good occasion to try to make one. I'm not a fan of coconut, but I must say this pie is delicious! My first attempt at coconut cream pie was a success thanks to this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

This pie was really good, but I did have to change it a little bit due to reviewers suggestions. I used 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup cornstarch, instead of 1/2 cup flour. The custard came out wonderfully with those changes. Thank you for the recipe.

One of the best coconut cream pies I've ever eaten.  My family has tried pies from all over and decided this was the best by far.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used cornstarch in place of the flour and one can coconut milk with enough half-and-half to make the three cups of liquid called for.  My compliments to Carol H. on this submission!

I too used coconut milk and 1/4 c cornstarch as others suggested.  It tasted wonderful...not too coconutty...however the consistency was too thick.  Next time I will use less cornstarch and I beleive it will be perfect.  P.S.  I also baked the crust for 15 m in first, then poured filling in.  Thank you!!

Did this exactly as written. Felt like the filling got to thick even though I took it off as soon as it started boil. Didn't taste at all like coconut! Did get compliments, but not my thing.

This was to-die-for!!! My uncle begged me to make it as one of the two pies I was baking for Christmas dinner, so I decided on this recipe. I totally with the others about substituting 1/2 of the half-n-half with coconut milk/cream (used cream). It made all the difference!

As other reviews said, I also used 3 egg yolks instead of the 2 whole eggs, and cornstarch instead of flour. 2 cups of coconut milk to 1 cup half & half. My pie set well, maybe too well? It tastes more like custard pie than anything. My filling is not creamy. I think the recipie definatly needs more coconut taste!

Very good pie.   My husband called it Gilligan's Island Pie.  It wasn't as hard to prepare as I first thought.  Sometimes we associate Old Fashioned with time consuming or difficult and this was not the case.

I cook a lot, and there are not many recipes that truly knock my socks off.  When I first tasted the filling for this pie, I dang near swooned.  I did not change one thing.  It's simple ingredients - but the whole is *so* much more than the sum of the parts.  Thanks, Carol.  This one is a treasure.

YummyYummyYummy! this is a keeper. We made the adjustments as per other reviews and it came out great. will add 1 extra egg yolk and up the cornstarch to 1/2 cup next time as another person suggested, we too  prefer a thick custard to a looser one. great job Carol H.

Made this exactly as the recipe called for with the exception of I topped it off with real whipped cream which this recipe truly deserves, although I'm sure it would still taste great with the store bought topping. This is as good of a coconut cream pie as I have ever had and everybody else who ate it at the Thanksgiving table raved it. If you love coconut cream pie look no further.    Thanks for the great recipe!

I split half and half and 2% milk and split flour and cornstarch. I had never made coconut cream pie before and I bought a coconut and looked up a recipe. I wanted to make if fresh and this recipe is AWESOME! I didn't try it the way it says I read the reviews and did what the pros said. My husband and friends loved it. it's really rich. For the topping I made fresh whipping cream and added sugar and coconut flakes...It's soooooo good! Use it...oh, it did take a while stirring but not that bad and as long as you keep the temp on medium and keep stirring it's about 10 min or so. It's totally worth it. Bon Apetite!

Very tasty and easy!  It does take a while to heat up though.  Mine never boiled, but it did thicken up and made a great pie. After reading the reviews I used 2 cups (1 can) coconut milk and 1 cup half and half.  I also did  1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup flour. Tasted great!

Food is like music; it has the ability to bring back fond memories long forgotten...like, sitting in a favorite bistro on a warm Sunday afternoon with blue skies and beautiful white fluffy clouds doing backstrokes in that lazy way I remember.  Finally, a coconut cream pie recipe that, like music, does just that.  Kudos

Even though I replaced half of the half and half with coconut milk, the taste of coconut wasn't really noticable.  I will make this again using only coconut milk instead of half and half and see how it turns out.  I took another reviewers advice and cooked this in the microwave with great results!

I have made numerous recipes looking for one my husband likes.  This is it.  He loves this pie.  I made it last night and there is one piece left this morning. I too substituted 2 c coconut mile and 1 c half and half as well as 1/2 c cornstarch instead of milk and prepared it in the microwave stirring every minute. Excellent pie!

This was a great pie I followed the other reviews with 1 1/2 h&h, 1 1/2 coconut milk and cornstarch.  Pie came out great.  This is the first time i have ever made or tasted a coconut pie.  I will never wrinkle up my nose at the sound of coconut pie again. Great recipe with suggested changes by reviews came out fantastic first time.

YUM!  I made this a low(er) fat and calorie pie by using 1-1/2 cups fat-free Half & Half and 1-1/2 cups low-fat coconut milk instead of "regular".  I was afraid it might not thicken, but it did :) I also used a Keebler shortbread crust - like a graham cracker crust w/o the overpowering flavor of graham cracker. I love coconut cream pie, but not the calories. Using one cup of Cool Whip Lite for the topping, the calories for the entire pie is 2,895 or 362/slice (1/8 of pie). The crust is high calorie, so skip the crust, serve in a bowl and 1/8 the pie turns into only 252 calories! :)

This was the first pie I'd ever made, and it came out fantastic. It was super easy -  just whisk everything in a pot and cook it. I followed the great advice from previous posters such as a can of coconut milk and additional milk to make 3 cups (I didn't have half n half), 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour and real whipped cream, of course. My boyfriend loooves coconut cream pie, and he really enjoyed this one. He (well, we) had our fingers in the pie, tasting it, before it even set, which didn't take 4 hours either. He says the only way to  improve it would be by making a homemade crust... Overall, very quick and easy recipe, and I'll most definitely be making it again soon! Thanks so much for this awesome recipe.

I feel bad reviewing this recipe with modifications, but I really enjoyed this recipe and want to share.  I used a can of coconut milk (I found this in the Asian food section of my grocery store) and used enough cream to make up the difference.  I also used corn starch instead of flour.  I made my own whipped cream and that makes such a difference!  My husband loves coconut pie and he's had many different kinds and he absolutely loved this pie! I will make it again and again.

Made this pie about two weeks ago. Used fresh coconut and it was a sensation at dessert time. Did not change anything else. Definitely worth the effort.

I get rave reviews every time I make this pie. The only variation that I use is a Oreo cookie crust - my husband won't let me make it any other way!

Fantastic recipe!  I made this and a Key Lime Pie off this site for a college group.  They devoured this pie!  It is perfect the way that it is, but next time I think I will try the coconut milk that others are writing about.  This will definitely be a pie that I will make again!

I also used coconut cream, corn starch, and a little extract because I like a very coconut flavor. If the original recipe had been with these modifications it would get a 5.

Yum!!  I've made twice - both time I used coconut milk plus half & half as suggested. Of course, I always top with real whipped cream & toasted coconut.

This pie was delicious and a huge hit!  I did use one can coconut milk because I love the flavor and put it into a homemade shortbread crust.  I love the pie at Kramanski's in Charleston SC and this is as close as it gets!

I love this pie. The only way to make it better, is that I whip the whip cream myself, by using a pint of heavy whipping cream and sugar. Its even more deadly that way! this is how I wanna die anyways :-)

I would encourage anyone to make this as written (be sure to keep stirring until thickened, like pudding. The recipe is not clear on this).Although we really liked this pie (hubby says you could go into business with this recipe), I felt that the filling did not have enough coconut flavor, and I was looking for a lighter consistency. I am going to try the suggestions of coconut milk and cornstarch instead of flour. But really, you can't go wrong with this pie. It's simple to make and people will think you are a great baker.

This is an amazing pie. Don't change a thing. Everyone who tries it (and loves coconut cream pie) loves it. They say it's the perfect consistency and sweetness.  I used a graham cracker crust recipe from this site by Janaan Cunningham and Cool Whip for the whipped topping.

Totally delish! Amazing results... The only thing I did differently was to use extra toasted coconut in the filling and real whipped cream dolloped on top & sprinkles with the extra toasted coconut. I didn't have time to read the reviews before I made it today and I'm glad I didn't. I don't think this needs all that tinkering with the coconut milk, etc. Everyone loved it... thanks for sharing this keeper.

You know I once tried to make a coconut cream pie from a cool whip and jello instant pudding recipe and it came out awful. I mean it was beyond awful. A mud pie from my backyard would have tasted better. It was watery and I will never ever attempt to do it again. NOW THIS RECIPE IS TO DIE FOR!! I followed the directions as followed and made my own whipped cream with powdered sugar and a half pint of whipping cream. My son and daughter and a few friends really enjoyed this and could not believe I actually made this. Thank you Carol an outstanding recipe, truly enjoyable. 5 stars is not enough. :)

I made this for Easter. Phenomenal! I used others suggestions and used cornstarch, half coconut milk and half 1/2 & 1/2 cream and real whipping cream flavored with coconut extract for the topping. Made the crust out of flour, chopped pecans, brown sugar & melted butter. Pressed into pie plate and pre-baked.   My sister can not taste things, and is big into foods textures. She was in 7th heaven with this pie.  Very impressive and delicious dessert! Will definately make again, probably for all holidays and special events! Thanks to all!

Very good.  First time I have ever made coconut cream pie and I was not disappointed.  Per other reviewers i used coconut milk and cornstarch substitutes.

Followed other reviewers suggestions.  Used 1 can coconut milk (just over 2 cups) and remaining half & half.  Used 2 egg yolks + 1 whole egg (xlg. size". Mixed eggs, cornstarch & 1/4 c. sugar in separate bowl.  Brought milk & 1/2 c. sugar to boil, then tempered eggs w/ 1 c. hot milk and then combined all in pan and cooked, stirring constantly until mixture came to a boil.  Stirred another 2 minutes and then removed from heat.  Stirred in 1/4 tsp. coconut xtrct & 1/2 tsp. vanilla xtrct and 1 Tbsp. butter.  Poured into a bowl that was set over a bowl of ice water and stirred until mixture cooled to room temp.  Poured into pre-baked crust that I had covered w/ toasted flaked coconut.  Will use remaining toasted coconut on top of whipped cream topping.

Thank you to all of you for your suggestions and "tweaks".  I made this pie today using a can of coconut milk adding half and half to make the 3 cups and the cornstarch suggestion.  The coconut milk just makes sense and the cornstarch is something I use to make puddings in general so another no brainer.  The pie filling was very simple and came together nicely.  I used a Keebler ready made shortbread crust as I was a little short on time.  I had left over pudding as the crust I believe is only 8 inch.  Lucky me! I will definitely make this again, but the real test will be my guests!

Positivly wonderful! I used one reviewer's suggestion of one can coconut milk, and then enough cream to make 6 cups (I was doubleing the recipe). The custard was lovely, even though I had to use some milk.It doubled very well.

Yummy! I made this pie using all of the suggested changes (coconut milk, corn starch) and it turned out perfectly. I did not cook my custard in the microwave though. I prefer to use the stove and just stirred it constantly. It didn't burn and thickened up nicely. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used a couple review tips, used a can of coconut milk withthe half&half to equal 3 cups, I replaced the 1/2c flour with 1/3c cornstarch. Just make sure you cook it to thickness. I got nervous when I saw clumps, but I think it would have been less messy if I kept going. I only toasted the 1/4 c of flakes for the top and I also used a shortbread crumb pie shell. Tons of compliments - delish and TASTES lite :)

OH MY GOD.  This pie was amazing. I did what other reviewers suggested and did 1.5 c of coconut milk and 1.5 c of half & half cream.  Kept everything else the same.  I agree with making your own whipped cream if you are going to make this pie; if you're going to do something homemade like this, you gotta go all the way and make your own whipped cream.  Made it for my dad's birthday, and he said that I have a job now every year until he dies - cooking these pies for his birthday!  LOL  Seriously, it was absolutely RIDICULOUS how good it was.  It made too much filling, so I had a nice little cup of filling and whipped cream for desert an hour or so after I made the pie.  Yum yum!  :D  Thanks for this sweet recipe!
-----------------
Update - just made this with no dairy since I have developed a lactose issue - made with 1 cup of canned coconut milk and 2 cups of coconut milk in the carton (So Delicious brand) and it's turned out delicious! Going to make whipped cream from canned coconut milk, can't wait to eat this when it's ready!  Gonna be very coconutty, but yum!  Love coconut!

As written I gave it a 4.  My modifications made it a 5 for me.  3 egg yolks, I also used 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk in place of 1 1/2 cups of the 1/2 and 1/2. (please note you still use 1 1/2 cups of half and half).  I used flour unlike most reviewers here.  Cornstarch will give it a funky look that is not typical of a coconut cream pie (this has been my experience from other cream pies).  But I am sure that is just my southern bias.

I used this recipe( somewhat) to make my first coconut cream pie ever! It was fantastic! My Mom has been the acclaimed coconut cream pie maker in our family and she thought this was the best she had ever eaten. everyone loved it. I did, however, use the modifications suggested by Emily in her review.I used a whole can of coconut milk and made up the rest with the half and half and I too used the cornstarch instead of the flour. I did not toast the coconut flakes inside the pie but I did for the top. Also, I think next time I will not use the coconut flakes. All in all, the best coconut pie i have ever tasted! Thanks!

Well...in my attempt at making this pie I tried the recipe alterations suggested by others and my filling ended up being like a very thick custard...not quite what I had in mind for my friends birthday pie. So here's my alterations: 1 1/2c. coconut milk, 1 1/2c. half-n-half, 3 eggs instead of 2, 1/2c. cornstarch instead of flour. I started out cooking it in the microwave but it was globby and made me nervous so I finished cooking on the stove. It took FOREVER and a day for it to boil and by then it was WAAAAY thick which probably was utimately the problem. So, I will try this again but not really sure what to do different. Follow the recipe perhaps? What a novel concept!!!

Was ok. Could only find coconut chunks that were unsweetened and though they were too big and chuncky. Will try the recipe again using smaller coconut. Overall it was good but not the best.

I went with the coconut milk, half and half and 1/2cp of corn starch and this was by far one of the best pies I have eaten.  Not to rich... just right.. loved it and will make it again for the family.

This is my honey's favorite pie so, there was a lot of pressure to get this right! It was an absolute hit and I have to cook it for Christmas dinner.  I did add a bit more coconut than called in the filling.  It gave a smooth yet crunchy texture.  Very enjoyable!

I made this for Thanksgiving....My family thought this pie was soooo good! I just changed a few things, I used 1 1/2 cups coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups half and half, coconut extract instead of vanilla, and 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup cornstarch. Thank you for sharing.

This is the best Coconut Cream pie I have ever had.  So much better than Jello brand.  It does take a little time, but you can't beat the flavor.  I also did 1 1/2 C. each of half & half, and coconut milk, and instead of using flour, I used corn starch.  I made the coconut custard in a double boiler, it turned out wonderful & it got rave reviews at Thanksgiving this year.

This is an awesome recipe. I did make a few changes of my own. Instead of 3 cups of half&half, I used equal parts of coconut milk and half&half. I used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs. I also did not toast the coconut to put inside the filling. I just did it for the top. I used a home-made whipped topping and added 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. This is so yummy!

I LOVED THIS PIE!  Coconut Cream has always been a favorite of mine, and this is the best one I've EVER had!  I did take the advice of some of the other reviews and I toasted the coconut.  I also used only 2 cups of half and half and used a cup of coconut milk as well.  YU-UM!

Thanks to Emily, I took her advice and changed a few things in the recipe:
1 1/2 cups of Coconut Milk, 1/3 cup of Corn Starch, added a couple tablespoons of toasted coconut to the pie filling and fresh whipping cream sweetened with confectioners sugar and vanilla.
But by accident I only added a 1/2 cup of half & half instead of 1 1/2 cups(didn't use heavy cream).  It still came out really good and probably less fattening.  

I also used a graham cracker crust (brushed with egg and baked for 5 minutes) and melted about 3-4 ozs. of bittersweet Giradelli chocolate and poured it on the crust then sprinkled toasted coconut and put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes.  I let the cream pie filling cool for about 10 minutes and then poured it into the crust.  We had a piece the next day and it was delicious.  I guess you can call it a Mounds Coconut Cream Pie!!
By the way I used Fresh Coconuts that we brought back from our vacation on St. John, USVI.

This was my first attempt at making pie, and I'm not a very good cook. But this came out so good! Even my husband was surprised that "I" made it from scratch! I did make the suggested changes, used coconut milk, and a little coconut extract in the homemade whipping cream. So so good!

This pie was pretty good but not sensational. I LOVE coconut cream pie but was a bit dissapointed in this one. I made it as written with the exception of using just a bit more coconut. It had a great flavor but just didn't WOW! me. **UPDATE** This pie was SOOO GOOD the next day?! I have NO idea why it tasted better the day after, but it was excellent. So despite my previous review, this pie is really good!

You must make this pie!  This recipe is wonderful!  My husband asks me to make this like every other week!  I was not a fan of coconut cream pies until I, unfortunately, made this recipe!  Now I'm hooked! :)  So I don't feel quite as guilty about eating a little piece here & there, I use fat free half & half and fat free whipped topping!  So so so delicious!

I followed the advice of another reviewer using cornstarch instead of flour. I followed the recipe otherwise and found this to be a very smooth,rich, creamy and delicious pie! I made my own whipped cream instead of using cool whip and it only made this pie better if thats possible. I havent had a better coconut cream pie and I will make this one again!! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is really a great pie.  These are the 'tweaks' that I did.  I used 3 egg yolks (saved the whites for meringue DH does not like the whipped topping)added 2 Tbs. butter, 1/2 tsp. coconut extract. Only had half and half,couldn't find coconut milk. The rest of the ingredients were pretty much the same.  The ratio that I use for cream pies, based on 3 cups of milk,etc is 1 Tbsp. flour plus 21/2 Tbsp. cornstarch.  Still makes for a creamy filling.  I also added toasted coconut to the bottom of my baked pie shell plus 2/3 cup of flaked coconut to the filling then with the meringue topping I put 'lots' of toasted coconut on top and then browned in oven.  Guess you could call this a triple coconut pie!  Delisho-O

This was the first coconut cream pie that I've ever tried, and one of the best ones I've ever tasted.  However, I think there was a step missing in the cooking directions.  In order to get the filling to come out smooth and get rid of the flour clumps, I mixed the filling ingredients in my stand mixer at medium speed until all the clumps were gone, then transferred the mixture to a pot to cook it.  Also, for an elegant touch, I added a split Tahitian vanilla bean to the mixture as it was heating.  The vanilla flavor really brought out the flavor of this pie.  Lastly, I like a lot of cream on my coconut cream pie and found that 1 cup of whipped topping was not enough.  I used an entire 8 oz. package of Extra Creamy Cool Whip and barely covered it.  I'd advise using more.

This pie is wonderful! I was a bit concerned that it was going to be a little dense, but it turned out to be perfect. I served it at my mother's house and everyone there loved it. The next time I make it I think I will try to fold in a little whipped topping into the cusard to see if that gives it a more fluffy texture. I will update then.

great pie!! i used real whipped cream for the top, but otherwise didn't change a thing. the second time i made this, i realized the filling gets even firmer the longer it cooks. it made a double batch since my crusts were shallow. great recipe!!

This recipe was unbelieveably amazing.  My eyes roll in the back of my head when I take a bite.  That good.  I used the coconut crust on this site with this recipe and it was close to the best thing I have put in my mouth.  You will not be disappointed with this pie.  If you like coconut, you will love this!!  I did make my own whipped cream, instead of using cool whip....divine!

I substituted the coconut milk as other reviewers suggested and the flavor was great.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion about making the custard in the microwave and it was a lot quicker and turned out thick and smooth.  As was stated, you just heat it for one minute at a time (stirring in between!) and it comes out thick in about 5 minutes.  Great tip!

I'm rating this recipe on behalf of my husband whom I have made this for 3x already, I couldn't tell you how it taste cus the children and I are allergic to coconut but I trust my hubby opinion as he is spoil and picky. And the fact that he eats it all by himself within 2-3 days, one occasion I made it for dessert as we had friends over for dinner, he hid the pie and I ended up making something else. He's in Iraq but this on his list of request when he returns. Thank you.

My first attempt at this recipe was for Thanksgiving. I had some difficulty with microwaving and getting the right consistency. So, I started over using the oven method. The pie was incredible! Everyone requested I make it again for Christmas. This pie has now become a favorite over the traditional Pumpkin Pie! I used some of the reviewers' suggestions and substitued Corn Starch for the Flour and Coconut Extract for the Vanilla Extract. Yummy!

Im not a coconut fan, but based on my families raving response to this pie, I have to give it a 5 star. Very easy to make, although stirring and staring at the ingredients waiting for it to boil was quit boring.  It was a huge hit, I'll make this again.

Very, very yummy flavor.  I tried the microwaved version that others suggested and nuked it for 7 min with stirring every min.- didn't quite set all the way.  I also used 1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 of the half'n half and used constarch instead of flour.  I would definitely make this again!

I screwed up the first time, not heating till thick (i guess i was just thinking that it might thicken in the fridge....it doesnt)  Then i looked at the reveiws more, and tried it again in the microwave and it turned out great! it took about 9 or 10 minutes though for me (beats 45 minutes of stirring with 2 toddlers at my feet!!!) :) Tastes great, thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Thanks for the chance to try this recipe!  but that being said, i gave it 3 stars because i thought it was very bland.  i put it on a graham cracker crust, which was very good with it.  the pie itself looked nice with the toasted coconut sprinkled on top, but the taste was...well, i didn't think there was much taste.  easy recipe though!

Well, according to my mother, the texture is slightly different from what you get at the store, but it was actually a lot better this way.  Very rich and flavorful, especially after taking the advice of other reviewers and doing the 1.5 cup coconut milk and 1.5 cup half&half as well as using 1/3 cup of cornstarch.  If possible, definitly use cornstarch, it turns out much better.  Great recipe, thanks!

I've never made coconut cream pie before but my mom is a coconut lover and I decided to surprise her with this after her birthday dinner. I love that the recipe calls for such basic ingredients and is easy to prepare, yet makes people think it took forever. I doubled the recipe to make 2 pies, as there were 14 people and it worked out fine. Took suggestions of other reviewers and used 1.5 cups half & half and 1.5 cups coconut milk and subbed cornstarch for the flour. I also made my own whipped cream instead of cool whip and topped the pies with the toasted coconut and chopped pecans. They turned out great and tasted amazing. Everybody loved it! Before we left the restaurant, the waiter mentioned to my dad that he'd tried a piece that was leftover, thought it was great, and asked where we'd bought it!

FABULOUS!!! As others suggested, I used 1 1/2 cups of half and half and 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk.  I also subbed cornstarch for flour hoping I wouldn't be stirring for 45 minutes.  Well, even after warming my half and half before mixing the the ingredients, it still took over 45 minutes of stirring before it boiled. But-it set beautifully.  I topped it with homemade whipped cream.  I could sell this pie as good as it turned out.  The time it took to stir was well worth it.  This is the BEST recipe for coconut cream pie!

Outstanding pie! The filling was smooth and creamy. Watch the coconut and don't cook it too long as it burns very easily! I will definately make this recipe again!

I utilized the changes other reviewers suggested including 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup flour instead of 1/2 cup flour.  Also, 1/2 tsp. coconut flavoring & 1/2 tsp. vanilla instead of 1 tsp. vanilla.  This was really easy!  Turned out very light.  As other reviewers suggested, take the time to whip real cream - it's sooo worth it.  Took this to my office Christmas party and everyone loved it.  

Super recipe!

I, too, used canned coconut milk in place of 12 ounces of the half and half. I got great responses from this coconut cream pie. This is the one you've been looking for!

I don't like coconut cream pie, but someone requested I make this for their birthday. So I thought why not? In the end I was pretty impressed. I did use coconut extract instead of vanilla, and I used 1/2 corn starch and 1/2 flour. I used a cast iron pot and never quite got it to a boiling point but after an hour and an half it thickened up really nice. To top it off I whipped my own cream, but because the filling was so rich I didn't add any sugar to the cream. It was a great balance.

Absolutely fabulous!  My 75 year old dad took it to his poker night and got rave reviews. I made the adjustments of adding coconut milk and coconut extract as suggested by others, perfect.  The first time I tried the water bath method and it took forever! Next day I used direct heat, quicker and still tasted perfect.

AWESOME- kudos Carol H! We did as suggested by other reviewers and split the 1/2 and 1/2 w/ coconut milk, subbed 1/3 c cornstarch for the 1/2 c flour, and made our own whipped cream.  I'm sure the original recipe was just as good, however, I will probably continue to make it exactly this same way due.  This was my first coconut cream pie and my family thought it was THE best they had had in as long as they can remember.  Even non cream pie fans will probably admit defeat and have some- I did!  ONE ISSUE, and maybe others can help me out with this because of my lack of cream pie making experience, but the filling took waaaaaaaaaay over an hour to firm- probably closer to two, and it never did boil as it should per the recipe.  We finally turned the heat up a bit to after my husbands arm was about to fall off from stirring (notice I didn't say my arm, hee hee hee :)) and even then it was sluggish to respond. We had even let the half and half set out to warm closer to room temperature, etc., and tried to be patient, but it never even considered boiling.  Once it did start to firm, I was afraid of it turning out rubbery, I didn't let it keep cooking long, so our cream section was softer than some out there, but my family really liked that about it as well so it was a good accident.  Final thoughts?
Con? Time = longer than you think, unless you have a trick for getting the filling to firm w/o burning
Pros? It's easy to forget the 1 Con once you taste it!

I used 1/4 c. cornstarch and 1/4 c. flour and it still tasted like paste.  I'll stick to the Betty Crocker vanillla pudding recipe and add coconut to it.  It's  still the best around.

loved this pie!!  i did follow some other suggestions and used half coconut milk/half half and half and added more shredded coconut, which gave it a good coconut flavor.  i also used homemade whipped cream instead of the whipped topping.  my only suggestion would be to be very careful when toasting the coconut, it's amazing how quickly it burns.

PERFECT!!! This is THE best coconut cream pie ever! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it so much I had to make another. It is also very simple. I used real whipping cream on top instead of frozen. Great recipe...thanks.

UPDATE 12/7/11: 
I have been making this pie for years and it is a staple at our house. But I decided to try it once with the "improvements" suggested in the reviews, with coconut cream in place of some of the liquid and corn starch instead of flour. I was SO disappointed! 5 out of 5 people who tried that pie said the original version is much better! So, don't hesitate to make this pie as written. The changes are not an improvement over the original

I would rate this closer to a 3.5. Compared to my usual recipe, this didn't come close (mine uses more egg yolks). I upped the amount of coconut because I wanted more flavor and texture. Good pie just not exceptional.

This pie was very good. My husband loved it. There were a couple of things I changed. I put 1 1/2 cup half and half and 1 1/2 cup coconut milk to give it more of a coconut flavor. And instead of putting it on the stove, I did put it in the mircowave to thicken quicker. Thank you for this recipe.

This pie was incredible! I used cornstarch - as others have suggested - and used whipping cream and milk. For the crust I used a store bought shortbread crust - so good. I made this pie on a tuesday and it was already being requested that weekend. I cooked all of the ingredients in the microwave - I tend to scorch milk - that worked beautifully. A friend told me it was THE BEST pie she had ever eaten. I would give it more stars if I could.

Great recipe!  My husband wanted a coconut cream pie for his birthday last month and I'm so glad I found this one.  Everyone loved it.  They even liked it better than a recipe I made from one of the popular tv chefs.  Thanks for a great dessert.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  It was picture perfect and it was very tasty.  I was rushing and decided to place the cool whip on the pie before it cooled.  Not a good idea because it started to condense.

My first time making coconut pie and it came out great! Used egg whites only, cane sugar instead of the refined crappy C&H type sugar which is fined through animal bones, real fresh whipped cream, and a graham cracker crust which compliented the coconut very well. This only needed to be chilled for 45 min till it was completely solidified. I only toasted the coconut sprinkles I put on top the pie. Once the whiiped cream I made was firm enough I took the pie out of the fridge and sprinkled cinnamon, toasted coconut and white chocolate shavings. Looked very profesional and yummy! Taste was very good. Kinda like tapioca pudding minus the tapioca balls. Not overly rich even though it super fattening! Next time I'll pair it w/ sliced bananas and maybe some caramel drizzle.

I made two of these pies for a recent pot luck dinner.  Everyone who had a piece said, "This is the best coconut pie ever."  I used a blender to thoroughly mix the ingredients to prevent sticking as it cooked.  I also used REAL whip cream.  (I did read the review just prior to mine--about not firming up-  even when cooked thoroughly the two I made could have been more firm--next time I will add more flour.  But overall this recipe was excellent and I sure appreciate Carol H. for sharing it!!

Deeelicious!  Rather than use all half and half, I used only 1/2 cup and the rest nonfat milk.  This did NOT seem to reduce the creaminess or richness of the filling.  I also used a bit of almond extract instead of vanilla, which was VERY tasty.  For a more coconutty flavor, I'll be adding coconut extract next time.  I made a shortbread crust, and this is surely one of my family's new favorites!

I followed the suggestion of others and I substituted 1/3 cup of cornstarch and 1 Tbsp of flour for the 1/2 of flour called for in the recipe. I also used Splenda instead of sugar with excellent results.

I topped with cool whip, as in the recipe, but it would have been much better with real whipped cream. 

It was quite delicious, but not the best I've ever had.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I made a carrot cake, red velvet cake, & brownies this weekend along with this pie...what did my father and I keep going for...the coconut cream pie...it was really creamy and the coconut was fantastic.  In all honesty, I can do without the crust and just eat it as a pudding with some cool whip on top:-) ...very easy to make...trust me it's definately worth the 5 stars!!

To die for!!!!  I made this with whole milk instead of cream  and was delicious.  I also used real whipping cream on top instead of frozen topping.  Will definitely make again.  VERY EASY and QUICK.  Pie set up quite nicely in less than four hours.

This is a very good pie.  I used 1/4C. flour and
1/4C. cornstartch.  I cooked the filling on top
of a double boiler over medium heat.  It only took about 10 minutes for the mixture to thicken.
I used unsweetened coconut, so it wasn't too sweet.  This pie is quite rich so the serving size can be smaller than other pies.

I whip up whipping cream for the topping instead of cool whip and I get requests for this pie again and again.  Yes, there is quite a bit of stirring, but it is definitely worth the effort.

Thank you for providing a "launch pad" for reconstructing my Grandmother's coconut cream pie recipe.  This one set up nicely -- I did cook the custard a little longer than recommended -- and has a nice coconut flavor. A little too much flour, though. Next time, I'll use egg yolks only and cut down on the flour.  Also, plan to use meringue like Grandma did,  instead of whipped cream to provide a little more contrast of textures.  Added a couple of tablespoons of toasted coconut to the dry ingredients in the pie crust - yummy.

I made this for my boyfriend as a present. He had wanted me to make a coconut cream pie like his grandmothers and this one did it. He loved it. It wasn't difficult to make. I used the half cream/milk substitute.  Also..it didn't burn but I'm new at the baking thing and I had the electric range on low..i should have had it on medium low. OOPS.. so it took longer than should have.  P.S. I didn't realize I was basically going for pudding consistancy.. I'm a newbie.

I made this for a birthday "luau". To make it more tropical I added 2 or 3 bananas to the filling. It was a huge hit. People who were still full from dinner got a piece to eat later just to make sure they'd get some. I've make lots of banana cream and coconut cream pies and this is definitely a keeper!

OK,I agree with everyone, use 2 cups of half & half and one cup of 2% milk.  Also use 1/4 cup of corn starch and 1/4 cup of flour.  This recipe is well worth all of the stirring!  Again, as mentioned previously, the toasted coconut makes the difference!  Everyone raved about this recipe!

Last night I swore that I would never make this pie again, as it took over an hour to boil (low heat??)  But today, the pie tastes so good that I have reconsidered.  Besides, I all ready worked off all the calories in the pie by stirring for so long!

I have searched forever for a recipe this good!
I use real cream for the top instead of Cool Whip and it is fantastic!  Thanks, Carol H., for submitting it.  My family loves it.

This was the best pie that anyone has had!I did substitute 1/4 cup of corn starch and 1/4 cup of flour for the 1/2 cup of plain flour.It took 35 min. to come to a boil, but well worth it. I also whipped up about half a container of whipping cream and blended it with the cool whip topping then sprinkled it with much tosted coconut!

Yuuummmmm!  Makes a great pie, rich but not too sickly or sweet.  I added double the amount of toasted coconut and made a graham cracker base with even more toasted coconut in it. I also topped the pie with whipped cream.Everyone enjoyed it.

This is excellent!  Hubby has been asking for coconut cream pie so I searched and searched and decided on this one.  I have never really had it so I had to wait for him to get home and let me know how it tasted.  With the first bite, his eyes closed and he declared it a "keeper".  This recipe is fail-proof, I followed it exactly.  It's better the next day!  Thanks Carol!

One word to describe this recipe = perfect.  Of course, since I love coconut, I added twice the amount of sweetened coconut to the filling.  I will most definitely be making this again.

This pie is fabulous! I've make it for three different get-togethers recently, and each group couldn't get enough of it. Instead of using a regular pie crust, I used the coconut crust recipe that appears elsewhere on this site. It's simply coconut and butter pressed into a pie tin and baked until golden. I'm in coconut heaven!

Excellent coconut cream pie recipe.  I featured it as one of my desserts at my Christmas Eve Open House. Plenty of positive comments.  It is quite rich, with a mild, natural coconut flavor.

This is a wonderful, rich recipe.  The key is the toasted coconut.  I whipped cream and lightly sweetened it for the topping. My only criticizm would be that it was a bit too rich and dense. Could be lighted up with half and half or some milk.

Easy and delicious recipe!  I LOVE coconut so I modified the recipe and toasted 2-1/4 cups.  I put 2 cups toasted coconut in the custard filling and 1/4 cup on the whipped topping.   Highly recommend.

I not only made it!!  I made 73 cream pies to date.  
*1 change to the recipe I omitted the flour for 3tbsp cornstarch . Its works much better and changes the custard to a gluten free custard. 
I was asked to help out with a dog rescue.  As I was browsing for recipes this one hit me and said "start cooking " lol. I swear perfect turn out every time. DON'T try to change milk/cream for a low fat milk as it wont set and you will have pudding pie's.  This isn't a fast  cooking custard so slow down it's worth it. Thank you thank you for this amazing recipe.  Sandy S

I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was delicious!  Cooking the custard takes a lot of patience and whisking.  Not a lot of coconut flavor, so if you enjoy a more intense flavor than I would suggest adjusting the recipe.  Very good overall!

I took the suggestions from other reviewers;  1 1/2 cups Whipping cream and 1 1/2 cups of Coconut milk.  And 1/3 cup of cornstarch.  The real winning part was using my double  boiler!  I had kind of forgotten it.  Like another person said only 15 minutes of stirring to perfection.  No sticking or mess in the pan.  I always make my own all butter pie crust.  It is a must for an excellent pie.  And finally I always whip my own Heavy cream.  Cool Whip can ruin an awesome with the horrible taste and texture.  It doesn't take long to whip cream.  With the adjustments made this is a keeper recipe..

Added 1/8 t almond flavoring and 1/8 t & 1/8 t rum flavoring butter flavoring because I thought I was out of vanilla.  Then I found the vanilla and added that, too!  It was delicious!

Very, very good. My wife loves coconut cream pie so I made this for her for her birthday. She absolutely loved it. I was golden for weeks thereafter. Haha. The only thing I changed was i microwaved the filling. 1 minute, stir. 1 minute, stir for 5 minutes.  It worked out perfectly.

I did not substitute anything in this recipe.  It works just as it is written and is very good.  You must be patient when cooking the filling.  I stood at my stove for a least 20 minutes stirring constantly until it came to a boil, and continued to stir for an additional 2 minutes as the recipe instructed.  My filling was thick and set up very easily.  I did toast more than a cup of the coconut and put about a cup in the custard. I will probably use coconut extract in place of the vanilla the next time I bake this pie.

This is the first time I’ve made custard with this much flour.  Is very stiff and unflavorful even after I added extra vanilla.  Not a fan.

Like a lot of other reviews I read, used corn starch instead of flour. I originally purchased a coconut to have fresh as possible. Not enough coconut inside to use, purchased fresh frozen. I also found coconut condensed milk. Used one can of condensed coconut milk and used half and half to make up the three cups. I also used heavy cream to make whipped cream. Wife loves the pie. Thanks to all for the receipe and all the changes.

This recipe is delicious! One thing I noticed in directions: When boiling on stove, the mixture must be thick and rich. I boiled it on high, constantly stirring. Not on low which on my stove would take forever.  Get a deep dish pie crust not regular. The flour was a little clumpy which I broke up on the inside of the pot while stirring. I will definitely make this again.

Yes I will make it again. The only thing I did change was 1 1/2 cup of half and half . Then 1 1/2 cup of coconut milk. 
I did stir longer then the recipe called for because I wanted it to set up and not be running off the pie shell .
I thought the pie was simple and delicious.  Thank you

I made this, others are saying it doesn’t set but that’s because they didn’t let it thicken up enough. You have to let the eggs cook just a little and it will become a pudding like consistency in the saucepan and that’s when you put it in the crust to set! Yummy!

Stirred it for half an hour and it never did boil like it was supposed to. Gave up on the stirring but luckily it did thicken when it cooled. I found that there was no flavor to it very boring. Probably would have helped if I put a teaspoon of coconut flavoring in it.

Seems really weird to put so much effort into making a high quality home made custard to top the thing with the product of the US chemical industry that is "frozen whipped topping"  Please use real whipped cream or meringue!

The end of the video says you can add coconut milk, and it was the ticket, otherwise the pie just has a settle coconut flavor

Unbelievably delicious! The only change was to use the whole container of cool whip. If some is good, more is better, right?

I have made this twice now. The first time I made it just like the directions said and it turned out perfectly! The second time I made it, I used some of the tips from other reviewers, and it turned out AMAZING! What it did was put in a whole can of coconut milk and add enough half & half to bring it to 3 cups.  I also used three egg yolks instead of two eggs. That made it so much richer and creamier! I didn’t toast the coconut that I put into the pie, but did for the top. We always have coconut cream pie and hot chocolate together. Enjoy!

I used the whisk attachment for my immersion blender to blend the ingredients and keep the mixture nice and fluffy. I thought it was going to come out too sweet but the finished pie was delicious.

My husband loved it and he is hard to please!. I did as others suggested, used corn starch instead of flour, 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk with 1 1/2 cups of half & half. Made home made whip topping - also added more toasted coconut to the custard.  He has requested I make one so he can take down to the Keys for a fishing trip with the guys

I thought this pie was pretty good. My husband loves coconut. I will, however, use a biscuit crumb for the base next time. I used 1 cup of coconut cream and 2 cups of regular milk. I make cheese sauce all the time so I know to keep stirring until it gets thick and will set up in the fridge. 

I also used whipped cream. For the coconut lovers in the family, it's a great pie.

I’m no pie expert and this was my first time making a cream pie of any sort, but it turned out amazing!  In fact the people that aren’t it said it was the best pie they’d ever had.  Two things about the recipe, I couldn’t get the filling to ever come to a boil on low, I just went with when it felt “thick”.  Also, I used unsweetened coconut and coconut sugar.  That left the pie not overly sweet with a lovely coconut flavor.

This recipe is a keeper, I am sure I will make again and again.  I read the reviews and used coconut milk for 1/2 of the half and half and also whipped my own whipping cream with a little confectioners sugar and vanilla.  Best coconut cream pie ever!

Used the recommended 1.5 cups of coconut milk and 1.5 cups of half and half. I also used the 1/3 cup of corn starch as recommended rather than the flour. It was a HUGE hit.

Honestly, this pie came out beautifully as written. I made this for Easter and had zero leftovers, rave reviews, and requests for two more next time! I will try the coconut cream in one next time, though I can't stress how creamy and tasty it is already!

Excellent recipe.  My husband said it was the best pie he had ever had.  I made my own crust using an Epicurious butter crust recipe.  I did not alter the pie filling recipe at all and was afraid that I should have after reading the other comments, but I wouldn't change a thing next time.  I did make my own whipped cream and added a little sugar and coconut extract.  One  reviewer said the pie didn't set up , but mine did beautifully.  You just have to cook it long enough to thicken on the stove top.  I whisked mine with a wire whisk as it cooked.  Definitely going in my recipe collection as a keeper.

I made this with a can of coconut milk as was suggested and the rest half and half. Used 1/2 cup corn starch in place of the flour. I will definitely be making this again. Also used whipping cream for the topping which my  husband preferred...he loved it!!

This pie is amazing!  I have been craving coconut cream pie for weeks and finally decided to give this a whirl.  The flavor is amazing, but as other reviewers said, it didn't set up, even after being refrigerated overnight.  I will make it again using a few of the suggestions.  My family loved it!

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times now and it is a family favourite. My brother in law told my now husband to marry me because of this pie. I add a little extra coconut in the filling. It’s delicious and is always a hit.

This is the BEST coconut cream pie recipe! This pie tastes just like a restaurant coconut cream pie. I used 1 1/2 C. canned coconut milk with 1 1/2 C. Half&Half to substitute the 3 C. Half&Half. I made my own whipped topping using heavy whipping cream, 3 TBLS. confectioners sugar and 1 tsp. coconut extract. Made pie crust from scratch. Very pretty pie and delicious! Thanks Carol for sharing!

Want to thank all of reviewers  for their  reviews and input.  As a result of following many of the suggestions, I just finished making the best Coconut Cream Tart I've ever made.  The first review suggested using coconut milk and enough 1/2 & 1/2 to make a total of 3 cups.  Did that , perfect.  Second suggestion was to replace flour with corn starch, Did that, but only a 1/4  cup, perfect.  Third suggestion, use 3 egg yokes instead of 2 eggs, Did that, Perfect.  Couldn't find frozen coconut therefore used Unsweetened,1 Cup, not toasted, Perfect amount of sweetness. Last but not least, Home Made Whipped Cream, of course.  Thank all of the reviewers for a perfect pie.

The problem folks appear to be having is NOT with this recipe, (specifically, the flour) but with technique. 

1/2 C. of flour is exactly what you need to create a wonderfully firm, creamy filling--especially if you're going for authenticity. When you prepare the filling, you have to cook it beyond "gravy" consistency to that of a thick pudding. Look at your filling in the saucepan (or double-boiler or microwave). When the action of scraping the sides leaves tracks that hold their shape for a few seconds, it's ready, not until then. Yeah. It's boring to stand over something for a few extra minutes, but this pie is worth the extra effort. 

Yes. You can use cornstarch, but it will give you a different texture to your filling, as well as a different appearance. Some folks like that. But an "old-fashioned" coconut cream pie would have typically used flour. (It would have also used meringue, but that's a topic for another day.)

Great recipe! I did increase the amount of coconut to 2 cups simply because my son loves a lot of coconut. I can't fault anyone for beefing up the coconut flavor a little to their own choosing, but I think we tend to overdo some of the flavor additions because we've eaten a lot of commercially-prepared pies that tend to over-compensate.

Thank you, Carol H. for sharing this with us.

Creamy and delicious. I always use a graham cracker crust since that is what my husband likes. The filling id wonderfully creamy and firm enough when you cut. My last recipe was too loose.  I did not have half & half so I used 1 can of condensed milk (about  2 1/4 cups) and then the remainder (about 3/4 cup) of heavy cream.  My family raved about how good it was. Can't wait to make again.

I made this for Christmas at my Hubby's request. He mentioned that this was the BEST Coconut Cream Pie that he has eaten. The only adjustment that I made, I added Coconut Extract. I had no problems with getting the mixture to thicken up. The recipe was great

I used unsweetened coconut flakes because I think the sweetened ones are gross. I put 3/4 of the coconut flakes in a food processor to make the bits smaller and I only toasted the larger flakes that I put on top. Toasted them quickly in a skillet on the stovetop. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was FANTASTIC. The filling seemed a little lumpy when I put it in the crust so I was a concerned but it ended up perfect. Coconut cream pie is my mom’s favorite and she hadn’t had it in a long time. I got a big smile from her.

I’ve made it every Christmas since (reminds my mom of a pie shop her dad used to take her when she was little) and after reading a few reviews I substituted some of the half and half with a can of coconut milk (good quality, nice layer of cream at the top) and added howvee much half and half to get the 3 cups. Absolutely phenomenal! Thank you for helping me take my mom back to her childhood via her favourite pie :)

I made this for my husband's 69th birthday and he said it was the best coconut cream pie he has ever eaten.  I did used frozen whipped topping but next time I will use homemade whipped cream.

Have made this pie 3 times and it’s been a hit every time! I don’t put the whipped cream on top and it’s just as good without it I think!!

I followed the changed version everyone suggested, with the coconut milk, etc, it was delicious, but use flour like it says or don’t use that much cornstarch, it was all you could taste, when I make again, I’ll add an egg, and maybe a tsp of gelatin with some cornstarch or flour, to make it thick enough to slice but still tasty

I made this as directed, except, because  I didn't have half and half, I used 3/4 c. whole milk and 1/4 c. heavy cream for each of the three cups of half and half. I'll certainly use this recipe again.

The pie was excellent. Only things I did different was to use a can of Coconut Milk and put a meringue topping. It was nice and firm. Nothing to do with the recipe, but the Pillsbury pie crust was the weakest part. Seemed to thin after I cut into it.  I submitted a picture. Simple and fun to make. We had another apple pie along with mine and mine was quickly gone.

I followed the instructions to a tee! I let it sit overnight. When I went to test the pie it was NOT firm at all. I had to empty the filling into a bowl and then added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch. I stirred it up and put it in the microwave for 5 minutes to thicken it up. Then put it back in the refrigerator to set. It will not thicken without the cornstarch!

Great looking and tasting pie. It did take a little longer than five minutes to toast the coconut. More than five less than 10. Keep an eye on it after five. 
And don't leave the stove when stiring the pot. And stir the entire cooking time.
Very easy, elegant delicious pie. 
But don't ruin it with cool whip. It deserves whipped cream.

I followed most of the recipe but made the exchanges suggested by @shea1228 which made it superb!   My husband (and I) eat a lot of coconut (raw in its natural state) and could put it on anything so anytime I make something with coconut, he loves it.  The pie did not last long and a week later I am already making another one.  Simply amazing!

for those of you who said it did not set right. remember all pudding custard base takes patience its worth it though. I like other people used coconut milk for a more authentic taste and 1/3 cup starch instead of flour works great . Thanks

This recipe caught my attention with the words "old fashioned coconut cream pie", my mom made this special pie for me on the holidays. I couldn't find my recipe and came across this one and thought I'd give it a try until I read the directions.  An old fashioned coconut cream pie has a meringue topping with toasted coconut on top and we didn't put it in the fridge to chill.  So back to the drawing board.

First time making this and it was YUMMY! I had some filling left so I filled some choux au chocolate and had chocolate coconut choux!
I made the following changes:
Used 1.5C of whipping cream and 1.5C of coconut milk.
Instead of flour used 1/3C cornstarch. **with the cornstarch make a "slurry" before incorporating into the boiled mixture. To do this I used equal parts whipping cream and coconut milk mixed with the cornstarch and mixed to a paste consistency.  Then once the mixture on the stove has boiled, pull it off the heat and add the cornstarch slurry, keep whisking, it will thicken almost immediately. 
I toasted the coconut to be used in the pie. 
I made a Graham cracker toasted coconut shell.
I topped with whipped cream and garnished with toasted coconut.
Was a HIT today for Thanksgiving!

I followed all the suggestions 1/3 c of cornstarch, 1 can of coconut milk and cooking in the microwave...it worked well but for my taste was far too sweet. I'll be putting less than 1/2 c sugar next time :)

The other reviews have been super helpful in making this recipe. To tweak things a little, I used one cup of coconut milk, two cups of half and half,  and added a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the custard mix.

Made twice once as written, once using coconut milk. Quite frankly my audience didn’t notice the difference. Easy and delicious. Sure to please.

This recipe is amazing! I normally use a store bought shortbread crust, which is a little small for the amount of filling this makes, but it adds to the overall deliciousness of the pie. My family loves this recipe!

I am a new baker and looked at several recipes before selecting this one. I followed the advice in the early reviews about substitutions and it turned out great! I made two and it was, without question, the best coconut cream pie I have ever eaten.

I made this once before and hubby loved it. However today I did a kind of, side by side comparison. Made both custards with a can of coconut milk and half & half. The only difference was one I used the 1/2 cup of flour and the other  1/3 cup of cornstarch. The difference between the two was obvious (so obvious even my husband noticed!!). The one made with flour was “muddier” looking and not as nice of texture as the cornstarch custard. They were both cooked the same and allowed to cool prior to assembling the pie.

Delicious pie!  I followed suggestions with half coconut milk and the rest half-and-half. I might reduce the amount of sugar next time I make this, but otherwise,  it's a keeper!

I made absolutely no changes to the recipe and it was wonderful! Only problem I had was the custard wouldn't thicken so I had to up the heat to medium low. Could just be my stove.

Very good, never made cream pie before.
Used 1 cup coconut milk,2 cups heavy cream, 3 egg yolks,1 tsp coconut extract. 1/2 cup sugar cause coconut milk was sweet already.

This was a very easy recipe that is delicious! I followed some other reviews and made the following adjustments: 1 1/2c half and half and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk; 1/4c flour and 1/4c cornstarch. Otherwise I made it exactly as it says. Be patient with the filling, it takes about 15-20 minutes to thicken and you need to whisk it constantly. Will definitely make this again!

I tried to make this twice tonight. Both times it went from not boiling to burned almost instantly. I was stirring nearly constantly on the first, but not continuously and it burned.  The second time i WAS stirring continuously and it went from not boiling to almost  solid instantly. It was so thick it was really hard to  stir and burned slightly  while i could not stir it quickly enough. For me this was not easy and will not replace my go to coco pie.

This is a good base for a coconut cream pie.  I only made a few adjustments after reading the reviews.  I used 1.5 cups coconut milk and 1.5 cups of half and half and I also used 1/4 pineapple once I removed pie filling from heat.  It turned out absolutely awesome and it was enough for 2 pies.

This was delicious! I did change it like other reviewers suggested 1/3 cornstarch, 3 eggs yolks, 1/2 half and half, 1/2 coconut milk and Bakers coconut un-toasted inside (couldn't find frozen). and toasted on top, which set it off perfectly. I also microwaved it, took approx 8 minutes stirring after every minute. It was amazing, rich,

I made exactly as written with the exception of doubling the coconut mixture.  It tastes great on a ready-made graham cracker crust if you're trying to save time.  ThIs is one of my favorites!

The pie was easy to make and set up/firmed up well.  I made the pie with whole milk instead of half and half and left the salt out of the pie and also used a salt free crust because I was making it for a salt restricted guest.  Adding the salt and using the richer milk would only make the pie taste better.  I gave the pie four stars because it wasn't as sweet as I would have liked and it didn't have as much coconut flavor as I wanted.  Next time I would use more sugar and maybe try some coconut extract.  I will definitely make the pie again!

The only thing I changed to the recipe was I added a homemade whipped topping to the top of the pie. I made this pie for my grandpa and he said it was better than the restaurant where he usually gets his coconut cream pie.

I followed some of the recommended alterations: adding one egg yolk to the 2 whole eggs and using 1/3 cup Cornstarch instead of flour. I used a whole cup of untoasted coconut in the filling then toasted extra for the topping. Used a roll out pie crust from the grocery store but I made my own whipped cream - easy and so delicious. If I would change something next time, I think less whipped cream (I made too much but it was so good). This is just an amazingly great pie.

Came out like pudding, didn’t set. Not enough coconut flavor. Very disappointing.

I used coconut extract in place of the vanilla extract and replaced half of the required cream with coconut milk.

Delicious!
 I followed the recommendation by Shea1228 - third time. I used 1 whole can coconut cream, then added half and half to complete the three cups.

Amazing recipe!
The only change I made was I toasted half the coconut. I used 1/4 c toasted coconut for the topping and put 1/4 c toasted and 1/2 c un-toasted coconut in the filling and it turned out amazing.
I'll be making this again for the holiday and this time I will use half coconut milk and half half-and-half and I'm really looking forward to seeing how this turns out!

loved the taste.  The cream started to break down over two days.  Corn starch works better than flour.

I used corn starch instead of flour since we have a gluten problem.  Other than that there were no changes to the recipe.  My son in law said it was the best dessert I have ever made (maybe that is a comment on my cooking? LOL) and wants the pie on a regular dessert rotation!

We all loved this pie. Hubby said this is the best coconut cream pie he's ever had! I followed the lead of others and used one can of coconut milk and enough half-and-half to make three cups. Substituted 1/3 c. corn starch instead of flour. Then off the heat added 1 tsp of butter,  2 tsp of coconut extract along with the vanilla. Tip: I put some toasted coconut on the bottom of pie crust before filling, so as to avoid it getting soggy...it worked. Delish!!

It’s essentially a coconut custard pie w whip cream. I guess that’s all coconut cream pie is, but it didn’t occur to me before. I made this pie and separately made a coconut custard pie that I really like (chef johns coconut custard pie). This was fine but not as good. It’s more pudding like. I’d just make the custard one and make my own whipped cream, which is what I did w the other and it was better. That said, this was pretty good. No complaints but just good not great.

So super easy to make and very tasty too!!! But one thing I did differently was where the recipe said to 'bring to a boil over low heat' I did it over medium-low heat since my stove's 'low' is barely warm.

Made it just as the recipe states and it is absolutely amazing. I made four pies at once and it thickened just as it’s supposed to. I will definitely make it again.

This pie is so delicious! I've made it about 6 times now and I have never ever had any trouble with it setting up, it  always turns out perfect. I get so many compliments on this, mostly "this is the best coconut pie I've ever had." I usually add extra coconut because I am a fan of that stuff.

Loved this pie!! Made the following changes, subbed 1/2 cups of coconut milk for 1/2 of the half and half. Also subbed corn starch for the flour.  Made this twice, first time in the microwave and I didn't like it that way, did not set right. The second time I cooked it on the stove and that was so much better.  I used pastry pride to top it with and that was delish!! Not too sweet!

I followed a lot of the recommendations from others. I used a heaping cup of coconut for the filling and toasted the portion reserved for the top. I used 1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 half and half (total 3 cups) I also did not use flour but 1/3 corn starch. It took roughly 30 minutes for it to thicken before putting it into the crust. Also I made my own whipped creme. THIS WAS BY FAR THE BEST PIE I HAVE EVER MADE!!  Oh sooooo good!! My friends and husband raved about it! Can’t wait to make it again !!

Patience in stirring the filling on the  stove for 20 minutes or so is key. It will thicken. I've made this recipe for the past 3 years.  The only thing I do differently is I make my own whipped cream, which I put a metal bowl and beaters in the freezer for 10 minutes before making. Just uses 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1/3 cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Beat on high for 1 minute or until stiff peaks form.

Based on the recommendations here, I added a 14 oz. can of unsweetened coconut milk, decreased the half-and-half to 1 1/2 cups, omitted the flour and added 1/3 cup cornstarch. I always whisk together the sugar and cornstarch before adding remaining ingredients to avoid lumps. Also used regular sweetened whipped cream rather than Cool Whip. Used toasted coconut in the pie and on top. Really terrific! It set up and cut very nicely.

I made this as directed and it was delicious! The filling came out perfectly and was just the right consistency and amount of sweetness. My only complaint was that it took FOREVER for the filling to boil on low heat. I did have to cook the coconut quite a bit longer to get it to look toasty... very tasty and pretty pie!

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The only change I made was to use fresh grated coconut I had in the freezer from Easter.  I toasted it with some powdered sugar to sweeten it.  I also added extra coconut, and it was a hit!

I followed the recipe except I listened to the other suggestions and 1/2 replaced coconut milk and half and half and used corn starch instead of flour. so I am giving it 2 stars because maybe if I had followed the recipe exactly it may have turned out??? who knows but this did not set up at all and turned into coconut soup. so epic fail. next time I will follow recipe exactly!

I made this for the first time this weekend and it was absolutely phenomenal! I'm typically a recipe purest on my first stab at it but must admit that I followed the advice of so many of you and made a few tweaks. Too make this a coconut flavor forward pie I did 1 1/2c coconut milk and 1 1/2c half & half and used 1 cup of uncooked coconut flakes in the filling. In addition to that I swapped out the flour for 1/3c corn starch.  It took my filling about 25 minutes to finally come to a low boil but once it did the filling was wonderfully thick and rich. I tasted it along the way to assess if I wanted to add more coconut flakes. I used toasted coconut for the top, made my own pie crust and found a simple and delicious homemade whipped cream recipe. This pie also looked as amazing as it tasted. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the changes I made. I'll definitely make this again.

I've made this pie so many times I can't even count. The only changes I make to the pie is to add pure creamed coconut to the custard, and cook the custard for 20 minutes. This makes the filling thick and delicious.

I have never made a coconut cream pie and since this is my husband's favorite I thought it was about time after 17 years of marriage.  We all loved it.  I made a couple changes.  Since I had no half and half I used half heavy cream and half milk.  I also used about 3 cups of coconut but only toasted 1 cup.  Next time I think I will toast all the coconut.  I wanted to use the advice of others and use cornstarch but only had about 1/4 cup so I used the 1/2 cup of flour and the 1/4 cornstarch.  It came out like a very thick pudding, but never boiled.  I will definitely make this again and won't wait 17 years for the next time.

Had others tell me that this was the best Coconut Cream pie that they had ever tasted.  I did follow advise of other and made the following changes.

I toasted the coconut for the top but used un-toasted in the pie filling.  I used one entire can of coconut milk and using heavy cream got to the 3 Cup mark.   3 egg yolk not the 2 whole eggs.  No flour - close to 1/2 Cup of corn starch.  1 tsp coconut extract not vanilla.  It set up perfectly.  Also - to use frozen topping on this would be criminal.  Takes 5 minutes to make real whipped cream - delicious.

Very, very good with some of the suggested changes! 1.5 cups heavy cream + 1 can of coconut milk, Only toasted the coconut that went on top, used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs, I ran short on corn starch but 1/4 cup of flour + 1/4 cup corn starch was just fine.  If you aren't used to making custard pies, you really must constantly stir! I mean, just about every second. When adding the flour and sugar, add them gradually, not all at once. This will help prevent clumps. Add the vanilla before the coconut. You will know the custard is ready when it is very thick like pudding and just slightly boils. I imagine the 1 star review didn't allow it to thicken enough, because this sets very firmly! Make sure to prepare the pie crust first to save on time. And definitely top the entire pie with whipped cream and toasted coconut, it's gorgeous!

Each slice is just a bit above 400 calories.

I keep making this pie for my family. Everyone loves it and requests it regularly. I follow the recipe, except I'm not a believer in frozen whipped topping. I like the real deal so I always use real whipping cream, slightly sweetened with confectioner's sugar and vanilla.

I followed the suggestions in the reviews and used 1/2 coconut milk & 1/2 cream (not half & half)... and corn starch instead of flour.   I accidentally bought unsweetened coconut flakes, but it didn't negatively affect the pie's taste.  The pie set up perfectly and  I got rave reviews.  great recipe.

I made this for Easter and it was  delightful! I followed the suggestions in the reviews. Used 1.5 cups canned coconut milk, 2 tablespoons cream of coconut, and half and half to equal 3 cups. I used the bagged flaked coconut (I couldn't find frozen), did not toast what went in the pie, only toasted the topping.  Also used 1/3 cup cornstarch in place of the flour.  Then made whipped topping (1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 TBSP confectionery sugar). Delish!

This pie is very creamy and set up well. I used a can of coconut milk and the rest half and half. I also added 1/4 cup coconut creamer ( love that stuff).  I wanted even more coconut flavor so I substituted coconut extract for vanilla. My husband loved it!

Made this today with two very minor changes. I used coconut extract instead of vanilla and I finished the cooking process using an immersion blender to insure a smooth filling after using a whip for most of the time.  Terrific pie and recipe! Thanks!
P.S. Made a second pie - banana cream using this recipe and banana extract.  Cut up a couple of bananas into the crust just prior to pouring the filling in. Homemade whipped cream on top after the pie cooled.
Both times, the pies set up and were wonderful!

I think this is good as written.  I used a frozen pie crust and baked it 10 minutes. I used the 1 cup coconut NOT toasted in the pie and used 1/4 cup toasted coconut on top of whipped topping. This worked out well. I didn't care for the coconut milk. I did try it one time with that and prefer it without. All in all, I'd keep the recipe AS IS by the originator and I'd make it again.

I roasted about 1 Cup of coconut for garnishing. I put quite a bit of uncooked coconut (1 1/2C-2C) in the filling (unroasted). I didn't think it was too much.  I think this recipie was quick, easy and delishious ! I made this pie again.  twice in 2 weeks ... out of this world!

I haven't tasted it yet, as it's chilling in the fridge.  But a few things.

First, I never got the mixture to boil.  I stirred for over an hour, and nothing.  It got nice and thick though, so I figured for stirring for over an hour, it had to be good enough.

I had to toast the coconut a tiny bit longer than it suggested, just to get it brown enough to my liking.

I also had nearly a full bag of coconut, so I toasted the whole thing, and threw a cup in the mixture, and I figured more on top couldn't hurt.  I also added in some coconut extract, cause I really wanted a punch of coconut flavor.  (That was in addition to the vanilla) .

I'm only rating it a 4, because the mixture never boiled.  I'm sure it'll taste good though.

This is so easy to make and my fiancé said it's the best he's ever had. I ran short on the half and half so I did use 1cup of heavy cream to make up the difference. This will become one of my "go to" recipes for social gatherings!

Delicious! I used heavy cream for the filling since I read in the reviews that the filling wasn't thick enough. But it turned out too dense. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly and I'm sure it will turn out even better!

I followed another reviewer advice and it was perfect--

I used 1 whole can coconut cream, then enough half and half to make it all up to three cups. I used three egg yolks instead of 2 eggs. I used a whole package of the frozen coconut in the pie, and then flaked, sweetened (toasted) coconut on top. I also used 1/2 c. corn starch in place of the flour. My family raved about this and it is going in my tried and true recipe book!!

Trial and error but the taste is great! Read the reviews and substituted 1 can coconut milk plus 2/3 cup heavy whipping cream. Used 1/3 cup corn starch and two eggs. Used the microwave trick but it didn't thicken up. Put in fridge for 1 hour but it was still runny. Poured it into a pot on the stove on high for two minutes and wholla! Refrigerated overnight. Will try the original stove top method FIRST next time. Might also try almond flour instead of the corn starch.

First time making coconut cream pie. This turned out ok, but  I feel like the texture was off, kind of runny. Should have been a bit more firm/light.

Tasted great but I made this in the morning thinking it would set for dessert at dinner. It was still really runny. Next time I'll make it the night before to allow it to set properly.

My pie never hardened or custard. I don't know what I did wrong- I followed the recipe word for word. The ONLY thing I can think of is that I beat the eggs before mixing it with my other ingredients because the recipe calls for two eggs beaten. However, when I watch the video on how to make the recipe, the eggs aren't beaten.

This was my first attempt at a cream pie of any kind and it turned out really well. The only changes I made were to substitute a can of coconut milk for some of the half and half and use 1/3 c. cornstarch instead of  flour. I still feel it could have used a little more coconut flavor, but that's just a personal preference.  It set up beautifully and was really delicious.

I added an egg yolk, used coconut milk, half  & half, 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of flour.  I made a coconut, brown sugar crumble for the top of the pie, and used whipping cream instead of store bought.   I also cooked on the stove on low until thickened came out perfectly.    I would definitely make this again!

Just followed the recipe....and stir, stir, stir....that is the secret to the filling. I am a connoisseur of coconut cream pie, and this is as good as any  thatI have had! Thank you, thank you!! I just made a chocolate cream pie using the same recipe....just substituted the coconut with a half cup of unsweetened chocolate powder. Look no further for a coconut cream pie recipe!

This was great with the comments of people who made it. I added more coconut, an egg yolk, used the can of coconut milk and added almond milk to make 3 cups, and was sure to boil it for a full minute over medium heat. Thanks for those comments!!!!

This is an excellent pie.  I do use a can of coconut milk and complete the rest of the three cup liquid with carnation milk. I toast the coconut for inside and on top of the pie. I also use fresh whipped cream for the top.  Follow directions as it states for the rest and you will be asked to make this pie from now on.  No kidding, it's probably the best tasting pie ever.  Good luck.

Not enough coconut! This tasted like a cream pie with coconut in it. I do like cream pie, but I would have enjoyed the pie more without the whipped cream on top. I would have liked more coconut flavor. It might be better with some of the suggestions from other reviewers, but I followed the recipe exactly.

Pretty good pie. I did change the half and half with 1/2 cup coconut milk and 1/2 cup half and half. I will make this again during the Holiday season.

I took the advice of others and used 1/3 cup corn starch instead of flour, and half coconut milk, half whole milk and microwaved it for five minutes, stirring after each minute. It turned out beautifully, so thick and smooth. Also, use the recipe on this site for "Best Flaky Pie Crust."  It's easy and foolproof. Topped  it with real whipped cream and it was perfect!

Great recipe, one that's become a standard. The only pie my daughter ever asks me to make (she's not a big fan of pies in general, but loves this one). The only change I make is doubling the amount of coconut, still putting half in the filling and the other half on top. I wouldn't say that's a necessary addition. I just really like coconut, so more is more.

I made it according to the recipe and it was beyond a doubt the BEST coconut cream pie ever. Make sure that you get the mixture to  a good boil stirring constantly.  This is my  go to favorite . Those whom I have served it to adored it, as well.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The toasted coconut is essential to the filling's coconut flavor, so don't skip that step.  The pie had a lovely coconut flavor and I don't see the need to substitute coconut milk for half and half although I may try it someday for the fun of it just to taste the difference.  Also don't rush the very slow boil plus two minutes of cooking as it is required for the filling to reach the proper thickness in order to set properly.  This recipe is a keeper.

I love this recipe! I'll definitely be using again. I took previous reviewers advice and made the following changes: 1.5 cups of half and half, 1 can of coconut milk, 1/2 cup of corn starch, and instead of vanilla extract, I used coconut extract.  I also mixed it in the microwave to save on time. Mine took 6 minutes to thicken- I took it out every minute to whisk- Be sure to do that.  I let it sit overnight, only because I didn't have time to make it the day of. It was amazing! Everyone raved about it!

I liked this pie, but I made a lot of changes. I used 1 1/2 c of coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream. I used Cornstarch in place of flour. I didn't toast the coconut in the pie, just the reserved coconut for on top of the pie. I used a coconut extract instead of vanilla extract.  It took almost 50 minutes for the filling to thicken. Next time I will start with a medium temperature, not low.

I have never liked coconut cream pie. I was making this , for the first time, for my Mom's birthday.  I used coconut milk (2cups) and half n half (1 cup) and toasted the coconut. I am now a lover of THIS coconut cream pie! I'm so glad I made two!!

Made the pie exactly like this recipe and used the whipped topping suggested by Emily. It was so easy I will not buy cool whip again!  The filling was perfect and I had no trouble getting it to thicken. It did take some patience stirring and waiting but it was well worth  it. I made it for my husbands birthday since coconut pie is his favorite and he said it's better than any he's had!  Will definitely make again.

I make this twice a year for our church dinner, 24 dinners and counting.  It always comes out great, sets up, never runny, looks beautiful and tastes creamy.  I use coconut extract in addition to the vanilla extract, 1 tsp each. I make 2 pies each dinner, and this recipe is the one everyone picks first.  I really appreciate you sharing your wonderful recipe.

Oh my goodness. Oh. My. Goodness. Made the changes other reviewers suggested and this is possibly the best coconut cream pie I've ever eaten. I've made tons of pies but never coconut cream. This is my new go-to for c/c pie!  5 stars for the recipe with the following changes as suggested by previous reviewers:  exchanged 1/2 & 1/2 for a can of coconut milk and the rest (to get to 3 cups) heavy cream. Substituted flour for 1/2 C cornstarch. Also, only toasted the coconut that tops the pie. Great stuff!

As written it was too dense. I would rather use cornstarch than flour. But toasting the coconut in the filling was a great addition.

First I need to say that I did follow other's recommendation to use coconut milk. I just 2 cups Coconut milk and 1 cup heavy whipping cream and followed the rest of the original ingredients. The flavor was amazing! However, for some reason the texture was a bit grainy, but the flavor was great enough to over compensate for the texture.

This pie did not set up after 4 hours in refrigerator. And it was too sweet - even though I decreased sugar to 1/2 c. 
I'm disappointed and will have to search for a better coconut cream pie recipe elsewhere.

This was a fantastic pie for Easter. I followed someone's advise and used a can of coconut cream and added half and half to make 3 cups. I also did it in the microwave. It took me about 7 minutes to get it thick, but it was very easy. I also used coconut straws from Trader Joe's that I cut into small bits. Everyone loved the meatier coconut over the flaked stuff.

I didn't change a thing from the original recipe and it turned out amazing. I made it for Easter at my parents and everyone said it was the best pie they ever had... My mom wouldn't even let me bring a slice of the leftovers home because she and my Dad wanted it. It was so easy to make too... I have no idea what people are talking about when they say it was a lot of effort (the critiques). I'll definitely make it again...eventually. Very rich!

The first time I made this pie I made it with coconut milk as many reviewers suggested. The second time I made the filling exactly as directed and that was the keeper for me. Yum!

I don't like coconut but this was delish!! great recipe, only would like it better if it was made without the flakes of coconut in the filling but that's a personal texture issue.

Turned out great. I did make changes though. I followed some other reviewers suggestions and used cornstarch instead of flour, used coconut milk and way upped the amount of coconut. I also used some unsweetened coconut mixed in with sweetened and used a bit of coconut extract for even more coconut flavor.  I made homemade whipped cream for the top and that is essential. I have been baking for many years, and this is (I think) the first time I have made a cream pie. This one will now be requested for every special occasion.

Almost a failure. Made it with some of the adjustments of others. 3 egg yolks, cup of coconut milk, half n half and heavy cream, added some flour and a bit less corn starch.

Cooked on stove until back of spoon coated. Poured in pre baked pie shell. Let it cool and in the fridge overnight. I had about a cup or so of leftover filling.

Opened the fridge in the morning and took it out. And it DIDN'T SET.!!!!!!!!

AIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEee!!!!! Why why whyyyyyyyy. I ran around the kitchen with a spatula shaking it in the air, bashing the counter top, and cursing the recipe world.

And then I thought, hmm, maybe I can put it in the oven and bake it so it sets. 350 degrees, 20 minutes, cover the edge of the crust with foil. Had a slight browning on the top. Let it cool down in the oven slowly after shutting it off. Chilled overnight again. Viola! Success.

Then I used the leftover filling and put that into some ramekins and baked that for the same amount of time. Tried one when it was warm. Oh man, deeeeeeelicious. So you can serve the filling warm in ramekins if you so desire.

You are supposed to bring the filling to a boil on the stovetop, but heck if that was going to happen without burning it. So I guess that is why it didn't set.

This is a family favorite, I substitute at least one can of coconut milk for the half and half, sometimes I use only coconut milk.  I also make fresh whip topping, seriously amazing recipe!

First time I've made this kind of pie, and it was yummy!  So creamy and good!  What we enjoyed most was that it wasn't too sweet, and just the right amount of coconut flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly, and will definitely make this again!

Great recipe to start and then figure out what works. If you would like to make this healthier and more natural, these are the changes I made:
1 1/2 cups of half and half. 
1/3 cup of corn starch ( instead of reg flower). 
I only toast the shaved coconut that tops the pie, not the one inside. Bake it at 450 instead of 350, or it  takes too long and dries out the coconut.
Instead of 3 cups of half and half , I use 1 1/2 cups LIGHT unsweetened coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of half and half. 1 1/2 cups of light coconut milk has 25g of fat, regular 75 grams of fat. Half and half about 45g. 
1/2  cup of sugar.
Made my own crust.

Thank goodness I read many reviews before cooking.  I tried to use  ingredients I had on hand.  Used 1 cup Coconut Milk, 2 cups Heavy Cream, subbed corn starch but did add a bit of flour, as well.  Added sweetened coconut, about a cup, after heating ingredients in saucepan.  Came out great, with the perfect consistency.  It took barely 4 hours to set and was ready to serve.

Definitely 5 stars!! This pie is amazing! I followed the advice of others and changed out the flour for cornstarch and added a can of coconut cream and the rest half n half. So good! Made 3 pies for New Year's and they didn't last 10 minutes! :) Thanks for sharing!

I made this for dessert for Christmas Eve.  I first made a honey graham cracker pie crust with butter, baking it for about 15 minutes in a 375 degree oven.  Then I pored the filling into the crust and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  Then about an hour before the guests came I -- or rather my 6 year old granddaughter -- put on the cool whip and the remainder of the toasted coconut on top. People left me but a sliver.  I think this was the best dessert I ever made.  It was certainly the best received.  My son-in-law thought it was the best thing he ever ate!  I know what I'll be making for dessert for many years to come.

It was really floury tasting on my first attempt.    I made this again and used 1.5 cups half and half and 1.5 cups of 2% milk with 1/4 cup corn starch instead of the flour and it was great!   I'm going to try it with all milk next time.   It was pretty rich even with cutting the half and half.

I've never had or tried coconut pie before but have been wanting to so I found this recipe and gave it a try. I followed other reviewers and did half coconut milk for the half and half, 1/3 cup cornstarch instead of flour. I started making it on the stove and it felt like it was going to take forever to thicken so I popped it in the microwave like other reviewers suggested which was so much quicker! I made homemade whip cream and only toasted the coconut that I put on top. It was delicious!

The only change I made to this recipe was instead of using vanilla, I used coconut extract. I followed the rest of the recipe. I read the other reviews and was a little worried about not making the changes like every one else did. Im not a fan of cornstarch... it never works right for me. I had absolutely no problems with this pie setting up. In fact it pretty much set up before I ever put it in the fridge. I'm guessing the people who had problems either didn't cook it long enough or your milk got to hot. I cooked it on medium heat, stirring constantly, until it started to boil, it did take a while. My family loved this pie. Only complaint was maybe a little to thick. I plan to use a little less flour next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit. Deviations from original recipe: I took the advise of many other reviewers and substituted half of the half/half with coconut milk, used fresh frozen coconut instead of shelf version, 1/3 c cornstarch in place of flour. I also reduced sugar to 2/3c and made a meringue topping in place of whipped.

Did as others suggested: 
1.)Used a can of coconut milk and rest was half and half to equal 3 cups all together. 
2.) Used 3 egg yolks instead of two eggs. 
3.)Some suggested to use corn starch I did not I just used flour just like the recipie said. 
4.) Then with the leftover egg whites I made meringue and put it on the pie and topped it with coconut that had not been toasted yet and put it back in the oven at 350 until it was brown. 

I have never made meringue or coconut pie. This very good, will make again. Suggestion for meringue make sure your egg whites are at room temp before mixing. I also didn't have any cream of tartar like other recipes said to use and the meringue still came out great. Can't wait to make this again!

I make over 100 of these pies every year for a local restaurant, using this exact recipe, except I no longer toast the coconut that goes into the pie.  An excellent custard, and it's their most popular dessert.  If the pie did not set up for you, I'm guessing you didn't let it cook long enough.  Conventional pie wisdom indicates that flour needs to cook for at least 9 minutes or it will turn back to liquid after you thought it was set.

I have made this recipe many times on the stove top and once using the microwave directions and it's turned out perfect every time. I'm am asked for the recipe whenever I take this pie anywhere. I use a can of full-fat coconut milk plus 1/2 & 1/2 to equal 3 cups and cornstarch instead of flour to thicken. If you aren't familiar with cooking pie filling, it can take awhile to thicken.

This will be so much better if you don't toast the coconut. I made it and it's too hard and unpleasant when added to the pie. The texture ruins the velvety-ness. Just put the regular coconut in. If I make it again, I'm going to soak the sweetened coconut in milk to soften it more.

Although I followed the recipe exactly as given, I was disappointed to find that the filling just did not set, even after sitting overnight in the refrigerator. 
I then decided to bake it in a 325 degree preheated oven; still it would not set! So I just left it In the oven to cool while I went out. To my surprise, when I opened the oven a couple of hours later  to my surprise, it had finally set into a custard consistency!! Perhaps the ingredients should have been combined in a different orde

I'm not a good cook, but this recipe set amazing & came out PERFECT.  Made it for my fiancé for his birthday because his mom used to make coconut cream pie....his favorite food.  He lost her recipe, so I was taking a gamble making this version.  I'm so thrilled with the results.  I made zero changes to the recipe and it set perfectly.  YUM!

We are huge coconut fans in our house and there was nothing left of this pie after I made it. You can't mess this up! It's not too rich and not too light. It's very refreshing! I highly recommend this pie! I threw a whole big handful of extra coconut in there just because we love coconut.

I've tried many Coconut Cream pie recipes.  This is by far the best pie I have ever made or tasted. I've been making this pie for eight years and will never use another recipe.  Is there anything better than a big piece of coconut cream pie?  I think not!  Enjoy!

Note:  Nothing will do but Heavy Whipping Cream for this baby.  In fact, one day I want to try fresh coconut.

Made this recipe for my hubby ( I don't like coconut Pie) and he said undoubtedly the best coconut pie he had ever eaten.  Gave some to our neighbors and they are still raving about it.  I will make it for superbowl this sunday again, and maybe a chocolate pie too!

The only thing I changed was to increase the amount of coconut to 3/4 cup in the pie and 1/2 cup to topping. This pie has a wonderful taste. I made it for one of our sub-zero evenings to lift our spirits. It worked.

This did not set for me for at all. It was complete liquid. I'm a pretty good cook but I've never made a cream pie before. I think it would have come out better with more detailed directions such as to bring to what kind if boil (liters bubbles or full rolling) and for how long, and what the consistency should be when it's ready. Very disappointed.

Made this for Thanksgiving and could not wait to try it. I made the recipe as written. I added a pinch more sugar and boiled it on medium and then quickly lowered the temperature to low. It was delicious and easy! I will make again.

This recipe turned out fantastic.  I have never eaten nor made coconut cream pie before but made this for a friend's birthday.  He absolutely loves coconut cream pie and raved that this was the best he had ever had (better than his mother's!).  I did find that the recipe would not come to a boil on low heat so I increased the heat until it finally got hot enough to boil.  Also, I used canned whipped cream as I do not care for Cool Whip.

We loved this recipe. We made these changes 3 cups cream and 1/3 cup cornstarch. Roasted 2 cups of coconut, mixed in 1 cup of coconut in the coconut cream made on stove top. Made whipped topping for on top by mixing 1 cup whipping cream and 2 teaspoon of sugar in mixer for 5 minutes.

Gave this a 5 star for the simple and foolproof process!  I did change a few ingredients:   the whole eggs to 3 egg yolks, the half and half to whole milk, we like a bit more coconut so I added more!  ...And at the very end I added a tablespoon of butter.  LOVED IT!  It will go into my family favorites!

Soooo good, and not the usual pain in the butt way to make custard. Throw everything into a pot and whisk while it heats to a boil and voila, custard. I added an extra egg yolk, half coconut cream/half and half, and corn starch instead of flour and it turned out perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and the pie never set. We ate it in bowls with spoons, so not to waste it. Very tasty. Next time, I will try the canned coconut milk, which I remember is nearly a solid at room temperature.

Delicious. All I changed was used 1.5 cups 16% coconut milk and 1.5 cups of 35% cooking cream. It is delicious. Will make it again! Especially for my brother in law. It's his favourite. And for some reason whenever I call bakeries (up to 15 different ones) none of them have coconut cream pie!!

This was soooo good. I made it exactly as written, and it turned out great. My (hard to impress) husband even said that it was the best coconut cream pie he'd ever tasted. I think next time I'll follow other users' advice and substitute some of the half and half for coconut milk to bring out even more of the coconut flavor.

Wonderful recipe. Made this pie with coconut cream and half & half. Did not bake the coconut that went into the pie, but did bake the coconut for decorating. Added a tiny pinch of cream of tarter to the whipped cream topping. Leftover pie stored in fridge was still excellent on the 3rd day.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I read many of the reviews and did make some changes but I still ended up with the pie not setting up firmly. I also found that the recipe was just a little to sweet for me. I will try this recipe again but will reduce the sugar and try corn starch instead of flour for thickening.

The consistency is very good, however when using the half coconut milk and half 1/2 & 1/2 combination, the filling is way too sweet.  It needs no added sugar at all!

not great, the filling had no taste, it was like eating thickened milk. I would guess the coconut milk might help the taste. I had no problem with it setting up. I tried extra sugar, butter and vanilla to try and make it taste better. Very disappointing.

Easy to make and a good pie but not the coconut flavor I was hoping for.  I did use part coconut milk and the other part half and half.  I added coconut extract and toasted only the coconut used for garnish.  I didn't want the crunch of toasted coconut in the filling.  My family thought this was a good pie.  It is.  Just not the recipe I am looking for.

Super easy to make. Full of coconut flavor. I whipped my own cream though since I don't like the frozen stuff and I can control the sweetness. Can't tell you how it compares to other recipes since this is the first time I've made this pie but everyone in the house liked it.

This pie is outstanding. I wanted a larger pie so I increase all ingredients by 1/3 and added an extra egg. Used a 10 1/2 inch pie pan,
 I don't like frozen toppings, so I used whipped cream.
Simply divine!

This pie is a work of art, really beautiful.  I made it exactly as instructed and although it was good, the coconut flavor was not strong enough for my liking.

Loved this recipe! My son wanted to try coconut cream pie so he found this recipe for me to make. Coworkers who are not coconut fans devoured it.

Great recipe with the substitution of coconut milk for 1/2 of the cream. Use cornstarch instead of flour, as so many others suggested.
To those who say it turned out like soup, you overcooked the filling. Cook only until it breaks bubbles for about 1 minute. To the lady who asked what 1/2 and 1/2 is, it is a common coffee cream and is anywhere from 12-18% fat content.

My first coconut cream our and it was a great hit with the gang! I didn't have enough cream so I substituted 2 % milk and added an extra egg yolk to thicken.. I used flour, did not add toasted coconut to the filling and cooked until thick.  Came or beauty, bounding high in the crust..  Will make again but with added coconut milk next time.

Made this for the first time with some changes. used 1/3C cornstarch instead of flour. used 1 1/2 C coconut milk and 1 1/2C half/half. did not toast coconut in custard but did toast for topping. cooked custard in microwave which took 11 minutes in my old microwave I made my own whipped topping. I will be making this again. I already have this pie on my Thanksgiving list

Excellent pie as is. I made it per the recipe. I agree that it's a custard pie, like some of the reviewers said, but a great custard nevertheless. I put the custard mix in a glass bowl in the microwave and did the 5 minutes stirring each 60 seconds; turned out perfect this way, and much quicker and less mess to clean up. I put the whole cup of coconut in the custard, but I think next time I make it I will add at least another 1/2 cup of sweetened coconut, and maybe coconut milk in place of some half and half for more flavor. I saved the 4 egg whites and made a meringue to go on top of the pie. Very, very good!

Delicious pie, very time consuming, but very tasty.  Next time I will turn the heat up a bit when making the custard so it won't take so long to thicken.

First pie ever. Used advice of others and used 1 can coconut milk, and the rest half cream half milk. I also only toasted the coconut for the topping, and used 3 egg yolks instead of two eggs. Last change was to use 1/4 cup corn starch and 1/4 cup flour. Looks delicious, my taste tester will be home later to review.

I used one can of coconut milk and then the rest in half and half.  It made such a big difference.  By far this now the best Coconut Cream pie ever with the coconut milk.

Mine turned out too thick... I plan to make again and use maybe 1/3 c thickening. 
 I used half coconut milk and half cream, and a vanilla bean cooked with the mixture then split and scraped the seeds and stirred them into the custard. 
 Also, I will add coconut extract as I think that will really enhance the flavor.

I LOVE this pie! The only changes I made was to substitute the 1/3 cup cornstarch for the flour (only because I always use cornstarch to thicken) and next time I will toast only the topping coconut, leave the mixed in coconut white just for the color factor but it is such a tasty delight the way it is that it will remain a favourite and I'll never get the boxed coconut pie filling again!

I followed the recipe to a T (wanted to try it without others' recommendations first) and while the pie is good, it's not as "coconutty" as I would like.  I will definitely make this recipe again, but adding the coconut milk like others suggested.  My family thought it was a little bland.

My husband loves coconut cream pie. I made this one for him this Christmas. It turned out awesome. I think it was the best we've had in many, many years. I know it was the best I've ever made and thanks to all the info I gleaned from Allrecipes, my "high altitude meringue" was literally the icing on the pie. :)

I love this recipe.  So quick and easy.  I substituted 1/3c. cornstarch for the flour.  I also cooked it in the microwave like others have suggested.  Just stir every minute and it thickened for me in 8 minutes.  I love this pie without a topping.

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving this year.  The only thing i did different is to use a premade graham cracker crust..It was so tasty, delish and kids and adults loved it; I was even asked for the recipe by more then one family member.. I am making it again for a holiday party.

Okay, so this was my first attempt at making coconut cream pie.  I followed some other reviews by using cornstarch, half & half and cream of coconut.  I also used fresh coconut in the pie itself and sweetened coconut on the top as well as substituted sugar for splenda blend.  I will say this was probably the best coconut cream pie I have ever tasted. I took my first pie to work for the guys I work with and it was a HUGE success!  My mother normally makes the coconut pie for the holidays but this year, I was given the task.  All of the family loved it!  I have one warning though...even with using the splenda blend, the cream of coconut is extremely high in sugars.  Being that both of my parents are diabetic, this was a big deal!  With the cornstarch, I had no issues w/my pie setting.

Followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 1/3 cups of coconut and used a 9" premade grahm cracker crust. It was excellent and set up beautifully, rich and thick. Great pie!:)

This was a good pie.  I liked that it was easy to make.  The only thing that I really have to comment on is that when the pie was done and ready to be eatin. I cut into it and it had some liquid in it that I know shouldn't have been there.  I added a bit more coconut to the mixture and put more coconut toasts on top.  Everyone liked it. :)

Very creamy texture and delicious but I will omit the flour next time because it didn't thicken up as much as I wanted it to.  I had to stick the pie in the freezer to thicken overnight.  Next time I will use cornstarch and coconut cream.  All in all, it is very delicious!

I was thrilled to find an easy and delicious scratch coconut pie! 5 stars with these changes: I used the microwave method that others recommended and it's true it works like a charm, so go ahead and try it. I used 1/4 C of flour and 1/4 C cornstarch, but I would recommend only using cornstarch bc it dissolves and mixes in more easily without any lumps imo. Other tips: I used 1/2 coconut milk 1/2 whole milk, coconut extract, 2 eggs and 1 yolk. My coconut took longer to brown-13 mins, but take the time to toast it, bc it really brings out the coconut flavor and it's a pretty presentation. If you make the whipped topping recommended by others here, it makes way too much for one pie. I would half it:( 1/2 carton of heavy whipping cream, I preferred 3 T of the confectioners sugar instead of 2, 1 tsp vanilla). I piped mine on and it looked amazing. I also used a 9 inch deep dish pie crust and it was filled with only a little left over, which we used for sampling. ;) I made this pie the day bf Thanksgiving so it had a long time to set up, so I can't vouch for the time it takes to set. I made the whipped topping the day I was serving it.
Loved this pie!!! Thanks OP!

Best ------ Pie ------ Ever!!!!!!!  I've tried this one quite a few times and now I double the recipe and use cream of coconut, adding enough half and half or milk (or combination of the two) to fill in the rest of the amount of liquid needed. I also use frozen coconut for the filling instead of the toasted sweetened coconut, and this is the tastiest thing ever. Love it!

Love this recipe! I've made it numerous time and it always comes out wonderful. I make it exactly as the recipes states, but I healify it a bit by using fat free half and half and fat free whipped topping. Another request was made to have it again for Thanksgiving this year!

I followed the directions as instructed except for the whipped topping. I also did the whipping cream variant. I agree the instructions are a bit vague when it says bring to a boil. It kept my stove top on for probably 20 minutes stirring constantly until it was thickening up and the occasional bubble popped to the surface. You stir for 20 minutes or so, you understand what firming up is! It is a custard style pie so you have to keep stirring so it doesn't burn to the bottom or "curdle" from the eggs cooking in the mix before the custard thickens properly. This recipe did deliver exactly as the ingredients require. For one more jab to those complainers out there, I found it funny many people complained about the whipped topping but would still use a pre-made graham cracker crust instead of making your own:) Anyway, the pie is delicious and I give only 4 stars since old fashion should go all the way, crust and topping!

My fiance is a HUGE fan of coconut cream pie and this is his favorite recipe.  Instead of 3 cups half and half I use a can of coconut milk and add half and half to make it three cups.  I don't toast the coconut flakes I put into the pie either. Next time I'm going to try using frozen coconut in the pie instead of the sweetened flakes.

Don't tell him where I got my "secret" recipe!

Thanks for this recipe Carol! It is now my specialty for family occasions! Seriously, they cannot get enough! I always use 1/2 coconut milk & half creamo and it turns out beautifully. Be careful not to burn your coconut and keep stirring the filling constantly. Yum, yum, yum!

This pie is absolutely the best coconut pie i have ever tasted!!! Took others suggestions and used 1/2 half and half and half coconut milk, 3 egg yolks and 1/2 c cornstarch. Cooked in the microwave (mine took 6 mins) stirring after every minute. I think i ate a cup of filling before i made myself put it in the pie shell then realized i forgot vanilla, but it really didnt need it!  Thank you for posting this recipe! I will be making for the holidays!

This was so easy and tasty.  I had to improvise with some ingredients I had on hand.  I used a combination of heavy cream and coconut milk instead of half-n-half.  I followed other users' suggestions and used cornstarch instead of flour.  I made sure to mix the cornstarch in cold cream before adding to the heated mixture to avoid clumping.  This fit perfectly in a deep dish pie crust.

My husband orders Coconut Cream every time we go to the bakery and always talked about his grandmother and how she made the best coconut cream pie. I have used several recipes that just didn't compare. Then one day I stumbled upon this one. He LOVES it!! He says it is as good as hers and I was so proud! I have made it many times since and followed the recipe with a few exceptions. I added a little coconut extract ( flavoring but not the artificial kind ) and it was extra coconutty! I also use fine and flake coconut in it for more texture and use about 3/4 cup of each ( so about 1 and a half cups rather than the 1 it calls for ) Also I used real whipped cream rather than cool whip. It is so good!!  

My husband prefers it with a graham crust to a pie crust as well, but it really is just super either way!!! Lovely recipe! A new family favorite!!

Thank you Carol H. for this great recipe!  I made no changes to this recipe except for the cool whip topping. I made a meringue topping instead. The pie turned out wonderfully! My Mom, Dad and Mother in Law are huge coconut cream pie buffs and they absolutely loved this. I will def. be making it again!!

GREAT I use to pay a friend to make pies for me and now I can make my own! I used 1.5 cups of coconut milk and then 1.5 of 1/2 & 1/2. I also split the vanilla to 1/2 tea and used 1/2 tea of coconut extract. Only other modification was 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup of corn starch. This encompassed all the other reviewers changes and it was great. I did the microwave method and it was perfect and fast! I'll be making this all the time now. Thank you.

One word: WOW!!! I mean it. The best coconut cream pie ever. After reading ALL the reviews, the only small change I made, instead of 3 cups of half-and-half, I put 1 cup of coconut milk and 2 cups of half... as suggested by SHEA. To die for. Thx for sharing!

This pie was amazing! I am definetly new at this and I did it simply and easily. Being a beginner i was alittle worried about the creme not being right but just keep stirring and it will thicken up. I too did the changes mentioned and ot turned out awesome. Just put all the ingredients in a bowl and stir and the magically will take care of itself haha jk ;) a truly great recipe. And you will know this as soon as people start begging for the recipe. Thanks for putting this recipe out.

Great recipe, like some of the other readers I used 1/4 c of flour and 1/4 cup of cornstarch and 3 egg whites. I cooked on stove. I also used a half of fresh vanilla bean. I seeded then threw the remaining bean in as I cooked the custard and removed the bean after done. Amazing flavor!

I have made this twice now, and both times turned out perfect.  The first time, I used real cream, including whipped cream on top.  The second time I was cooking for lactose intolerant people, so I used coconut milk and soy milk in the custard base (with 1/3 c. of corn starch instead of flour) and whipped topping on top.  The results were virtually indistinguishable from one another.  I will definitely be making this for years to come.

Easy to make just keep an eye on it when bringing to a boil on the stove, because as soon as you take your eyes off it it will boil over!!! But it was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!

Delicious... My husband made this for me.  He's typically not a baker but followed the directions and did a spectacular job!  He substituted the whipped topping with freshly whipped cream that he sweetened with a bit of sugar and vanilla.  He also used a graham cracker pie crust.  What a sweet surprise!

Delicious! The pie was so easy to make. I took the suggestions from other reviewers and halved the coconut milk and half and half. The only complain I have is that the pie did not firm up completely before serving. But that's because I was too impatient to let it go the entire 4 hours! Either way, it was still delicious and even moreso the next day when the leftover pie had completely firmed and all the flavors had settled. will definitely be making this again.

No changes were needed to this basic recipe.  It is fantastic the way it is.  I did use real whipped cream instead of the frozen stuff.

I followed the advice of the reviewers who used the microwave; I was skeptical at first, especially since after the first three minutes the custard was still very liquidy. It took an extra minute, but it was perfect. What a pleasant surprise - thanks for sharing the tip! I tasted a slice before it had completely chilled - mistake. Now that it has chilled overnight, it is wonderful - perfectly sweet and creamy (before it had thoroughly chilled, it was eggy and not very sweet). Topped with real whipped cream, and I used cornstarch and a coconut flavoring in the milk. Next time will use 1/2 coconut milk, 1/2 half-and-half as was suggested; the flavoring left a slight alcohol taste. Fantastic recipe!

Tasted awsome! I did have some trouble with the recipe though... the cream started clumping when boiled so I had to run it through a sieve, and then it didnt set in the fridge so it was a little runny. Im using starch next time and boiling at lower heat.

So easy to make and its so good. I took all the tips from other people. I did use cornstrach 1/3 cup instead of flour and tried it with the 1/2 cup flour and I do think the cornstrach is better to use. Do use the 1 1/2 cups half and half and 1 1/2 cups coconut milk it really does make it better. I only use 1/2 a cup of coconut so its not to much and I use real whip cream. Give it a try its so worth 20 minutes over the frozen pies.

I do not review things but I HAD TO on this one.  This is by far the best coconut cream pie recipe.  This is the only recipe I like.  My dad loves coconut cream pie and he told me this was by far his favorite one he's ever had (and he doesn't just say things to be nice...he's honest no matter how rude) I love how easy this pie is too! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

MICROWAVE! I was worried about microwaving this as others had suggested as I only had enough ingredients for one try. It worked great! It took 10 minutes to thicken as much as I wanted it too. I whisked every 1 minute. I followed the recipe except for using 1/4c + 1tbsp cake flour instead of all purpose as that's what I had on hand. I will look for the coconut milk next time as I agree it could use more coconut flavor but is still awesome as-is.

Heaven!! My first coconut pie and everyone wanted the recipe.  Instead of 3 cups hald-and-half Iused 2 3/4 cup half-and-halfand 1/4 cup hazelnut creamer! gave it a little more nutter flavor! I did not use coconut milk but did add 1 tesp. coconut flavoring. For the whipped cream topping Iused a recipe from here called "whipped cream"and used 1.5 tbls powdered sugar and chilled the mixing bowl!

This past weekend, my husband asked me to try to make him a coconut custard pie. I personally don't like coconut, but don't mind making him things he likes. I came across this recipe and gave it a try. I followed suit and substituted with coconut milk, corn starch and coconut extract. I also made homemade whipped cream. I won't rate the taste since I don't like coconut and can't be fair, but everyone that has tried it, loves it. So much so, I had to make another one tonight for them. Quick. Easy. Rave reviews. Works for me!

This is the only pie I have EVER made that come out exactly as it was supposed to! I did make a few changes but the core recipe was definitely a life saver.. In fact I made it so many times everyone in the house banned me from making another for at least a few months!

I used this as a base but modified it with amazing results. First off I love coconut so I added a 200g bag of unsweetened coconut powder to the mix while cooking for the 30 minutes. Also I took into account the fact a few reviews stated using coconut milk and corn starch instead. So I used the can of coconut milk and then half and half cream to make up the rest of the 3 cups. Still at the end mixing in another 3/4 cup of coconut and the vanilla extract.  I took this to my moms 59th birthday as a gift as my grandma used to always make her coconut cream pie. But since she passed 4 years ago she has missed the coconut cream pie on her birthday.  Well to say the least it was amazing and the pie was gone in less then 5 minutes. But I'm glad I made a second pie at the same time. I'm inviting her over for another piece lol :).

This pie takes a lot of time to cook and stirring but it is SO worth it. Coconut cream pie is my husband's favorite and he loves this recipe. I will be making this again very soon.

Made this for the first time last night. Quite delicious. Two things that will make this pie PERFECT...make your own crust and whipped topping.  This pie takes work since you have to stir the whole time but it is so worth it. I added extra cocnut, too. You can never have too much! :)

I was disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. My filling turned out floury-tasting and had a grainy texture, despite the proper cooking temp and time. Also, not enough coconut flavor. Next time I'd definitely use corn starch and increase the coconut and/or use some coconut milk.

This is the easiest and quickest Coconut Cream Pie I have ever made. It also tasted great. I couldn't find the coconut milk. I substituted the vanilla extract for 4 tsp's of coconut extract. I have been using another recipe which took 3 times as long to prepare. This recipe will be my go to from now on. Terrific!!!

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it has turned out great! The second time I made it I changed the servings to 12, because I found that the original recipe made too much filling for my pie shells, with 12 servings, I was able to make two pies! The second time I made it my diabetic grandfather was there, so I used splenda instead of sugar and it still turned out great!

This pie came out very good, but it seemed like it was missing something. I used a can on coconut cream and enough half and half to make it the right amount instead, like another reviewer suggested, and it tasted good. I just can't pin what was missing.

A family favorite.  I use (like many others) canned coconut milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 as I like coconut flavor.  A lot.  I also used cornstarch instead of flour, makes a very creamy custard.

I thought this pie was fabulous and so easy to make.  This recipe actually made enough filling to fill two pies so I was thrilled!  The only change I made was to use coconut milk and half-and-half to equal 3 cups and made whipped cream rather than using the frozen whipped topping, which is just a personal preference.  This truly is an old fashioned coconut cream pie which I loved because it didn't taste all sugary and processed like the coconut cream pies served at many restaurants and available at grocery stores.  This pie is very rich and creamy.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Wonderful! I only used 1 1/2 c of Half & Half, and the other 1 1/2 c coconut milk as another reviewer suggested. I never actually got to have any of this pie. I made it for my fiancee and within a half hour he and his nephew were licking the pie plate clean. They ask for it all the time. Even if I didn't want to make this again, I think I would have to!! Can't wait to try it myself!

Outstanding! Do the 1/2 coconut milk & half/half or whipping cream. Plus, do the 2 cup portion of boxed whipping cream for top. Use the frozen/fresh coconut for pudding center and save bagged stuff for top/browned. Wonderful!

This is the best coconut cream pie that I and everyone who tried it had ever had - but, I made it with the adjustments made by a prior reviewer - Thank you She1228 and used fresh sweetened whipped cream from a home whipped cream aerator to top each piece as it was cut. The alterations are as follows: •One can of coconut cream, topped with 1/2+1/2 to = 3 cups. •3 egg yolks •1/2 cup corn starch • 1 pkg frozen sweetened shredded coconut (have to hunt that down at an Asian market)

I followed some the changes recommend, and used cream of coconut.  It was wonderful!  I couldn't find frozen coconut here, so had to use the regular coconut from the store.

We had some great coconut cream pie at the Capitol Grille over the holidays.  It had a coconut crust and was baked in a tart pan.  I tried to replicate it using this filling (adjusted as described below) and a coconut macaroon crust from another website.  It was awesome, not quite like the pie at Capitol Grille, but DELICIOUS.  Based on some of the other reviews, for the filling - I used 1 1/2 cups of canned coconut milk & 1 1/2 cups of half-and-half in place of the 3 cups half-and-half; 3 egg yolks in place of the 2 whole eggs; 1/2 cup cornstarch in place of the flour; and 1 pkg (I think 6 ounces) of frozen, fresh coconut and some additional shredded, sweetened coconut (probably about 1/2 cup (I like coconut!)) in place of the 3/4 cup toasted coconut.  Used real whipping cream on top sprinkled with toasted sweetened coconut.  Used a 10-inch tart pan in place of a pie pan. The coconut macaroon crust was pretty sweet; so, having the filling not overly sweet was perfect.  For the crust, you make coconut macaroons first, then you crumble them and add pecans and butter.  It was sticky since the macaroons were made with sweetened condensed milk; so, it was sort of a mess to press into the pan as it stuck to your hands, but the crust was very good even though I thought the macaroons themselves were not that good. Next time, I will try another macaroon cookie for the crust.  Otherwise, this is one of my favorite desserts!

I just made this but really messed it up, I think. I will know in a few hours after it cools. I was making two pies and instead of using the tool on the website to double the ingredients, I was doing it in my head. Problem is, I doubled the half and half, and forgot to double the rest including the sugar, coconut, vanilla etc.. Ouch! Got two pies cooling in the fridge now, will update once I know how it taste. Might just end up being low sugar coconut pudding in a baked pie shell :)

This is fantastic.. i made it with coconut milk and half and half combined to reach 3 cups.  I used 3 egg yokes as others have said. I did use flour as i was out of corn starch.  WOW it is so good.  Took only minutes to make.  I will be making it over and over.  I will not however be listening to the Police and Queen while stirring the custard on my IPod because when you do that while having a glass of wine on New Years Eve the pudding starts to get chunky when the egg cooks because your not paying enough attention!!  Thanks for Sharing this recipe.  SO GOOD!

First pie I ever made. I've made 4 since Thanksgiving to Christmas, and everyone LOVES it! Very easy to make. I don't understand why some peoples pie didn't set. I cooked mine on med, it take a while but then it starts to get thick. I also used a whisk to stir with (because of the flour).  But it is a WONDERFUL pie!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the first pie to get eaten. It was super yummy. I followed the recipe exactly only I had a half can of sweetened condensed milk left over from a different recipe so I added that to the custard mixture and it just added to the creaminess. I would definitely make this again and again.

This pie is good for people who like coconut. I don't like coconut too much but made it for my mom since she loves it and both my dad and her liked it a lot. I used 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk and 1 1/2 cups of half and half. My only problems with it was it takes a while to boil depending on your stove and I was worried it would stay soupy at first but i decided to put it in the freezer and it firmed up nicely but took about 4 hrs. Otherwise it is a great recipe and it appears as though i am one of the very few people who had some trouble with the consistancy. 4 stars :) I also liked it a bit too coconutty for me but it was still good and i ate a slice. :)

Very creamy, and even for a somewhat novice pie baker easy to make and well recieved! Very pretty to look at. :) Made with Pie Crust IV from A.R. I think replacing half of the 1/2 & 1/2 with coconut milk is a great idea for more of that coconut flavor and if I make this again I will follow that advice. The custard was very nice, very creamy.

I absolutely loved the taste of the filling.  I used 1 can of coconut milk plus enough half and half to equal 3 cups.  I was disappointed when after it was in the refrigerator for 24 hours that it is still runny.  Next time I'll try using only cornstarch.

Loved it, I went with the 1 1/2 of Half and Half and 1 1/2 of Coconut Milk.  I also used the cornstarch instead of the flour.  My only problem was when I was reducing it over the low heat, remember the long you keep it on there the thicker it will get.  I think I left my on about a minute or so to long.  My family liked it, but I thought it was to thick or rich.  Next time I'll remove it sooner.  All in all, I loved the pie.

I doubled the recipe and used an 8 inch and a 9 inch pie plate.  I easily had enough filling for three or four pies so I used the extra in some frozen tart shells.  I used one 14 ounce can of coconut milk and skim milk for the remaining liquid to make six cups.  I toasted my coconut because it releases more flavour.  I could have cut the coconut by at least a third but didn't.  I did reserve a 1/2 cup of the toasted coconut for use in the meringue topping I made.  Meringue is very easy to make when using meringue powder and you don't waste your yolks!.  Definitely a keeper considering a coconut pie at the bakeries around here are selling for $7 - $8.50.

My husband kept asking me to make a coconut cream pie because his grandma always makes them for him. I didn't want to try and live up to grandma so I chose one that was made differently than hers and he loved it.

I really like this recipe, and so did my family. Though, I made a crust myself and it came out great, though the crust was just a bit undercooked on my part, but it was my first time. My father who is rather picky about his food enjoyed it alot. I did do a bit different the recipe though, I used just a little bit more coconut, about 1/4 a cup, which was un-cooked, then a cup of toasted coconut as it said and it came out great! The coconut milk I think made it more custardy which I loved, I also used normal milk and it came out good. I also didn't use any whipped topping, and it came out fine. Oh, put a bit of fresh lime juice on it, it gives it a nice bite.

This was to die for!  I made the recipe as stated, save for some untoasted coconut between the two layers.  I used reduced fat Cool Whip.  The custard took about 45 minutes for me to thicken up, which was worth every single minute of whisking time.  This is going in my arsenal of recipes!

Put away all your other coconut cream pie recipes!!! This is the best! Only alteration - I do add 1/4 cup more sugar (family loves their sweets). This pie goes to any occassion we attend and it's the most requested pie I bake. Very easy to follow recipe as well.

What an amazing pie! Others recommended using 1/2 coconut milk for the filling, but my store did not have any. Instead, I used all of the half and half, but I added 1.5 tsp coconut extract to the filling and it was great. This is an awesome pie!

This is absolutely the best!  No changes - make as is!  We are making several for Easter presents.  Everyone loves it.  Tastes like something out of a upscale restaurant.  My 12 year old son can not get enough!  You will love it...

this pie is amazing! i made a few changes to mine though. i didn't have any half and half so i used heavy whipping cream. and i agree with some of the other people who have reveiwed this and i added 1 can of coconut milk, it was almost 2 cups. and then i used the heavy cream. i turned out great!! it wasn't too dense or rich. i also used a graham cracker crust. and i made homemade wipped cream(1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/4 sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla). i do recomend you let this chill in the fridge for a long time, or over night if you can. it really helps it to firm up real nice. a great recipe!! you should definatly try it!!

This is a ************ recipe. I used the coconut milk like some of the reviews said to do. Also next time I will use a bigger pie tin that the recipe called far. The pieces were very thick.

I made two of these last week and they disappeared fast!  Everyone loved it.  I used half coconut milk and half heavy cream.  I glazed a good quality frozen store bought pie crust with egg wash and sugar before baking it.  It made the crust look great and it kept it's texture without getting soggy. I made sure I had enough heavy cream to make homemade sweetened whipped cream for the topping.  I also toasted some coconut for garnish.

First time making this coconut pie, and it turned out smoothy-licious. It will turn coconut haters into lovers. Took it to a church function and it was gone. A tip, be sure to stir constantly and if you see oil starting to separate STOP, that means you've over stirred.  Once the oil separates it cannot be used and you have to start all over, been through this. I stirred for about 24 minutes.

I did use a grahm cracker crust and tried 1 cup of coconut milk with 2 cups half and half. I may do more coconut milk next time, but it was really good! my husband loved it!

Yum!!! I've been in a pie-baking mood lately and my coworker requested coconut,  so I decided to try this one. Tastes great and looks really nice too.  I used a can of coconut milk, which was exactly a cup and a half, and then a cup and a half of cream. Used a pack of the frozen coconut for the filling and toasted the baker's coconut for the top. My coworkers said it was delicious, I don't even like coconut and I finished a piece. 

Recipe very easy but a bit time consuming, I will use the microwave for the filling next time.

I've been making this for the past 5 or 6 years and it's wonderful. My family fights for a slice because there is never enough to go around. I use coconut milk rather than half-n-half and I always add a teaspoon of coconut extract. Homemade whipped cream on top and ta-da...you have a 5 star pie!

Ok I have done coconut cream pie before but doing it the lazy way of using the jello pudding mix. So I tried this recipe and it was to die for. I couldn't get half and half though so I used the coconut evaporated milk instead and it came out great. Added some crushed pecan nuts and caramel syrup on top along with the roasted coconut flakes and everyone loved it. Kept calling my house days after for more.lol Thanks for this recipe

I'm only giving this 4 stars becuase I changed so much. It was wonderful though. I made it special for my boyfriend's birthday because it's his favorite kind of pie and he (as well as the rest of his and my family) loved it! Here is the recipe I used for TWO large pies... 2 cans coconut milk and enough half and half to finish the needed 6 cups, 6 egg yolks, 1.5 cups white sugar, 1 cup corn starch, 1/2 tsp salt, 3+ cups coconut (I soaked the stuff you find in the baking isle in water for a few hours and then squeezed the water out because I couldn't find frozen coconut anywhere), 2 tsp coconut extract. For the whipped topping I used four small cartons of heavy whipping cream, 20 tbl powder sugar (that probably converts to something easier but I started with 8 and kept adding), and 1/2 tsp coconut extract. I also took flaked (not shredded) coconut and toasted it and sprinkled it on top. Very pretty. My boyfriend asked where the one I made was because this one was too good!

I made this pie for my brother-in-law who just adores coconut cream pie.  He very much enjoyed the pie.  However, we both agreed that a little bit more coconut flavor was needed.  Perhaps the coconut extract that many of the reviews suggested will do the trick.

To die for! Even my husband who does not care for coconut gobbled this up! Used can of coconut milk and added half and half to make 3 cups, but I'm sure it tastes awesome without. Topped with stabilized(stays firm longer)whipped cream. Also used the microwave to cook the filling and it worked great, stir every 3 minuted till thickened.

This was a fantastic recipe!! I have never tried to make a coconut cream pie before, but this recipe was a HUGE success!! I did make some of the substitutions mentioned - 1 1/2 C. coconut milk, and 1 1/2 C. half & half, as well as the 1/3 c. cornstarch in place of the flour. It came out great, and I will make this again and again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Definetly a good pie.  I followed the other suggestions of using only part of the half and half and the rest a can of coconut milk.  Then I used coconut extract instead of vanilla.  I didn't think that it was too much of a coconut taste.  The only other thing was that I couldn't get it to boil.  I did it on low heat.  The misture got REALLY thick.  I tried to boil it but was afraid of burning it.  It still turned out great and firm.  I'm adding it to my recipe box!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I did what the others suggested by replacing some of the half and half with coconut milk (I used a whole can) and replacing the flour with 1/3 cup of corn starch.  The pie turned out beautifully.

I made four of these over the Thanksgiving holiday and everyone loved them! I used the cocoanut milk and half and half. I also thickened the filling in the microwave stirring about every 3 minutes. 
Great pie!

YUM!  This recipe was delicious.  I made one following the recipe exactly and one using the 1/3 cup of corn starch, 1-1/2 cups coconut milk and 1-1/2 cups whipping cream (omitting the flour and half and half).  Both turned out yummy.  I think the second one was a little more flavorful and rich though.  Excellent!

This pie is AMMAAZZIINGGGGGGG!!! I tried it with half flour, half corn starch and it worked out perfectly for me. I'm going to make another one today and I think I'll try substituting a portion of the half and half with coconut milk as others have suggested, just to add a bit more coconut flavour.

I've made this pie three times and it is by far the best ever and so simple! I left the recipe the way it was (because no one ever does on this site) and it turned out perfect! You could make some money with this pie!

Loved this recipe.  Was easy and turned out wonderful. Only changes I made is to add regular UNtoasted cocount (1 cup) to the cream mixture, cooked on medium heat (not low) and added the toasted coconut (another 1/2 cup) directly on the top of the pie. I also used the cornstarch instead of the flour simply cause I find that easier to cook with for pies/custardy desserts (and am familiar with cornstarch's properties), and added one tablespoon butter because I like a little buttery flavor to my pies.  Turned out wonderful and set up nicely.  Most pies call for a meringue, which for my personal taste, I hate meringue (gag!) so I typically don't add a topping to any of my pies and I didn't on this one either.  This recipe makes such a large portion of pie filling, it filled the entire pie shell and left no room for a topping - which is fine by me. :-) I simply topped the pie mixture, once poured into the shell, with the toasted coconut, chilled, and served. Other than the meringue, this was just like my Grandma made! Great recipe.

Coconut Cream Pie is my absolute favorite dessert. This is the first pie I ever made and it was perfect. I couldn't find coconut milk like the others suggested but I didn't want all the fat from the half and half so I used fat free condensed sweet milk. I added extra coconut since I didnt have the coconut milk or any extract. Lot's of wisking but it will get there I promise! 
My entire family was impressed.

This is so delicious it is now my families favorite pie! I made it with the suggestions from others, I split the half and half with coconut milk and eliminated the flour with 1/3 cup cornstarch and I also reduce the amount of sugar to 2/3 cup which was plenty sweet enough. I swear it gets better everytime I make it!

The flavor of this pie was wonderful.  This was my first time making such a pie and mine turned out a bit runny.  I am still rating this 5 stars because it tasted amazing.  
I am pretty sure that I didn't cooked it long enough but if I were familiar making this sort of pie, I think I would have had a better idea of the texture I was looking for.  I will be sure to try this out again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first ever attempt at a coconut cream pie and it turned out great.  My dad loved it for Father's day.  I used coconut flavoring and instead of cool whip topping, I made Dream Whip.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for dessert for my 90 year Mother. She loved it and was an excellant baker in her cooking days. I was afraid it was too firm but she says not. My BF loves it and told me to make it again. Very simple but it does take a while to thicken. I used cornstarch and heavy cream. This is a keeper! Thanks!

This was very good and creamy tasting ...I used a double boiler and cooked it until thick like a pudding...I rated it only 4 because of so many changes--I used  lo fat milk and coconut milk ,coconut extract,cornstarch (1/3 cup( too much -2T would be enough and add an extra egg) also I wished i had addded some butter( 2 T)   but over all  this not a  bad tasting pie. the flavor gets better after it sits too,

OH MY GOD! This is the first coconut cream pie I have ever made and I can't say enough about it! I totally agree with Emily, use coconut milk and heavy cream instead of the half & half, cornstarch instead of flour, and home made whipped cream. I actually stretched this to 2 pies. I only toasted the coconut going on top. My husband is absolutely in love with this recipe, and is ready for me to make more. It's not difficult to make either!

My husband, who loves coconut cream pies, thought this was the best he's had. My neighbors, who didn't think they liked coconut, love this! I took other's suggestions and used 2 cups coconut milk with 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2, used cornstarch instead of flour, doubled the coconut (toasted all of it) and cooked in the microwave (done in 7 minutes)  very very easy and delicious!

This tasted very good, however the texture was more like a pudding pie. I was looking for that thick, cheesecake like texture. (I used coconut milk with the heavy cream, maybe that effected the outcome.)

I don't usually review, but I have to say that this pie was awesome! I was in the mood for a coconut cream for thanksgiving and time was an issue for me so I was debating about making the one with the pudding. I have made that before and it was good. But this puppy was so yummy! I'll never make the other one again. You do have to be patient when stirring the cream on the stove, but well worth the time. I did not change a thing in this recipe.

This was a great recipe! I needed a dessert for Thanksgiving that wasn't the usual pumpkin or lemon meringue pie. I came across this recipe and it was really popular! To be a little different I had substituted one cup of half-and-half for one cup of coconut milk and then I topped the pie with fresh pineapple, strawberries and kiwi. It makes a nice presentation and an even better dessert.

This turned out really good! I tried listening to the reviews, and warming up the cream slowly, but after 45min of stirring my arm was about to fall off, I cranked up the heat and brought it to a boil, and what do u know, it thickened! It also burnt at the bottom though....  but no one tasted the burntness so it was still very good!! I aslo used cornstarch!

This is the BEST coconut cream pie I've ever eaten. I live very near Amish country in Ohio and have never found a coconut cream pie that tasted anywhere near as good as the ones they make, but this one tastes exactly the same! The recipe is super easy and quick to make. Husband loved it. I'll never buy another store-bought pie again. Will make over and over!

This is by far the best coconut cream pie I have ever tasted! I made it for my grandma's 70'th birthday and it turned out spectacular:) I took the suggestions such as using the coconut milk and the half and half as well as making the homemade whipping cream. It does take a long time for the coconut mixture to come to a boil but it is well worth it, remember to have it on a LOW setting. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent Recipe! I also took the great advice/suggestions from others: I used coconut extract and cornstarch (same measurments) in replace of the flour and vanilla extract. Only advice I can offer is to really really really stir the filling like you have never stirred before! Once the custard starts to thicken (and this will take a long time on the low heat; don't get discouraged!!) use a sturdy whisk to completely stir the mixture together. This will really help with half&half (or coconut milk) not sticking and burning to the pot. I didn't wait for the filling to necessarily "boil", I took the pot off the heat as soon as I felt the filling was thick enough for the pie. You may want to use more whipped topping as well. I simply used as much as I thought was good enough to nicely cover the entire pie and create hight!

This was very well received. It was somewhat overshadowed by the chocolate and peanut butter pie I also made for the event I took it to, but it was well liked (I didn't try it as I don't like coconut). I substituted 1.5 cups of coconut milk and cornstarch as suggested and used fresh whipped cream. It does take quite a long time to boil at a low flame, but I think it's worth it.

This is a very good pie as I am an avid coconut cream pie eater.  However, the next time I will try it with the coconut extract as the pieces of coconut in the base of the pie, kind of ruined it for me.  I also agree that you should use coconut milk as well as half and half.  Once I change it up a lile the next time its definitely a keeper!  Thanks

great flavor. I am an avid baker but had never made coconut cream before. Took a long time to set, but I may not have cooked long enough. But once it was done, it was GREAT! I made fresh whipped cream and put on pies!

I would give this a 5 star review for taste, but my pie didn't "set up" like it should have.  We actually stuck it in the freezer and as long as it stayed frozen, tasted great

I never really thought much about coconut cream pie. I have maybe eaten it maybe six times in my whole life. This year for Thanksgiving my husband asked me to make him a coconut cream pie. Then I realized that his mother has one at every family function. So, I made this recipe for my husband. I am speechless, this is the greatest pie I have ever had. I had to stir for about 40 minutes, but it was worth it. The whole pie got eaten up, and I will diffently be making it again for Christmas.

WOW!! What else can I say.  The stirring got kind of old- over 45 minutes worth until it finally boiled, but this pie was gone in a flash.  I used whipped cream recipe from this site too.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I toasted the cocnut to where it was pretty brown and crispy and it gave it a nice crunch on the top. I am not a pie maker so I was nervous about making it, I have not made a pie in years, so I was proud of this pie, Thanks for a great recipe.

This was awesome!  My first pie ever and it turned out great.  I used 1/2 coconut mild and 1/2 half and half.  I used all the flour that is asked for.  It depends on how creamy you lik it whether to use cornstarch.  I will be asked to make this every holiday.

I made this recipe for the first time this past Thanksgiving for my family and it was a hit. The filling was very smooth and creamy, and toasting the coconut made it even sweeter. I will definitely will be making this one again.

Very very good.  It took forever for the mixture to boil over low heat, but it was worth the wait.  I made this for my grandpa (who is a pie fanatic) and he raved about it for weeks.

Perfect!! Followed the advice of others and used half cream and half coconut milk. Took 45 min or so to boil over low heat.. however it was worth the time!!

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday last year, and he loved it!  I made the 'shortbread crust' recipe, also on this site, for the crust.  It was a big hit, even my MIL asked for the recipe!

This is a keeper! I used 2 cups half & half, along with 1 cup heavy cream.  Came out beautifully.  It might be the best cream pie base I've ever made.

Very good pie. Maybe a little bit too much flour. I did what other reviews suggested and made whipping cream for the topping and topped with toasted coconut.

YUM! Don't know why anybody would say this was difficult. I thought it was easy. I did it with cornstarch and coconut extract. Delish.

I make this pie all the time for my son who is a coconut pie fanatic.  I substitute cornstarch for the flour and I use one can of coconut milk, and enough half and half to make 3 cups total.  I add an extra egg.  I use Nutra whip or whipped cream for the topping and i cook the custard in the microwave, easy!  Just a wonderful creamy pie!

I made this pie with the 1.5 half and half and 1.5 of coconut milk with the corn starch instead of flour.  Also tried to do it on the double boiler but I think I didn't let it get thick enough.  It took quite awhile for the double boiler to thicken up.  Anyway, I thought the taste was wonderful.  I'm not a real coconut cream pie fan but I think this pie was very tasty.  My niece loved the pie and took the rest home to eat.  Will make again with modifications but will try it direct on the stove top next time.  Thanks.

This pie was absolutely fabulous. My husband loves pies and was asking for one for weeks, but I just couldn't find the recipe I was looking for. Well, then I came across this little beauty and knew I'd hit the jackpot. I think we ate the entire pie in one sitting. He asks for it at least twice a month now. Thanks so much for saving the day with your recipe!!!

!OH MY GOODNESS! This was a great recipe, though I did switch it up a bit like other reviews had suggested substituted the flour for corn starch, 1 1/2 cup of coconut cream (coco lopez) and 1 1/2 cup of half and half and then I added 1/4 tsp coconut extract. It came out a bit sweet but was sooooo good anyways. I also made with the Whipped Cream recipe from this site. This recipe got so many great compliments. This recipe will be a keeper.

This was my first time making an over the stove cream pie.  I followed the recipe exactly without any changes.  I'm not sure what happened (maybe I cooked the cream for just a bit too long) but the cream has a few lumps in it (kind of like tapioca).  If anybody knows how I screwed up, would love to know so I can try the recipe again with no lumps.  Next time around I think I may add extra coconut, and maybe some coconut extract like others have suggested.  I thought it needed just a little more coconut flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Ooh this was so good! I took the advice of another reviewer & added 1/3 cup of cornstarch instead of the flour & it turned out wonderful.I also made my own whipped cream from another recipe on this site! You won't buy store bought whipped topping again! Thanks for sharing

I stirred and stirred and stirred.  I had the heat on medium low and still it took 40 minutes for the cream filling to thicken.  When it finally "boiled" it was too thick. I used cornstarch instead of flour...perhaps that was the problem.

I made this for a friend's father for Christmas. I made a 12 serving recipe and put it in a 9" springform pan with a graham cracker crust and real whipped cream topping. He loved it.
My boss also loves coconut so I'm making one for his birthday.

Yummy!!  Made it with the full amount of flour and wasn't put off by the taste at all - in fact, everyone love it!  Why one more review?  I wanted to share this with fellow beginners:  Heed the cook time!  On my gas cooktop, the "pudding" section took well over 30 minutes to thicken and finally boil.  In fact, I adjusted the heat to mid-low after about 10 minutes.  Also, only had whipped topping from a can left over from Easter and that tasted really good too.  Thanks Carol H.!

This was a very delicious, rich pie.  I followed the recipe exactly & used a double boiler.  It was very labor intensive but it was worth it.  My husband and I took turns stirring and that made it a lot easier.  I don't normally care for coconut but this was pretty good.

Even after exchanging some of the flour for cornstarch (1/4 cup), the texture was still flour-y and unappealing.  I prefer a creamier, lighter texture.

STOP SEARCHING___THIS IS IT!  You can tweek this one up to your liking. I changed the 1/2 cup flour to just 1 tbs. flour and 1 tbs. corn starch so not too firm. I doubled coconut and didn't toast what went inside pie. One time I sub. four ripe bananas for coconut for ban. cream pie. FAB!

I made this for my Mom (she requested a coconut cream pie instead of a birthday cake) and she loved it!  My family aren't big dessert eaters but this pie was gone in an instant!  I used the 1/4 c cornstarch & 1/4 c flour and cooked on a double boiler and it came out perfect!  You just have to be patient while cooking this because it takes close to an hour to come to a boil.

Very delicious recipe!  Followed the reviews of a few others (no flour--1/2 cup cornstarch instead... modified half&half amount -- 2 cups half/half & 1 cup milk instead).  I also meringued the top instead of serving with whipped cream.  If you meringue, be sure to chill the pie for at least an hour before serving.  I had never meringued before so I served it without chilling, and it came out like soup.  My family sampled the "soup" and loved it, but it holds together so much better when chilled.  Oh, I topped the meringue with toasted coconut for added visual.  I hope it comes out just as great for everyone else as it has for me.

Great! I made a couple of minor changes, but will definitly make this again.  I added 2 more egg yolks and made a meringue with the whites, instead of whipped cream. Will try whipped cream topping sometime too.  I changed 1/2 cup flour to 1/3 cup cornstarch and I didn't toast coconut, but will try it next time with toasted coconut.

Turned out nicely and liked it because it wasn't sickeningly sweet as other recipes have been. Thanks for sharing.

I used other reviewers comments and put in 1/4 corn starch and 1/4 flour instead of the flour measurment and I toasted the coconut.  And I constantly stirred.  It was great, not really sweet, I got compliments and I will make this again.  Thanks

My father loves coconut cream pie and has been asking for one for a long time. I didn't want to make a instant pudding one and i din't want one where i had to "scald" milk or separate egg yolks. This recipe works out great and i get alot of comliments each time i make it. As someone on here suggested use half flour and half corn starch for a pie with better consitency. Excellet pie i recommend it to everyone.

I tried it twice!! and both times it was Coconut soup :-D.  I read the reviews and I will also be a little more patient for the boiling to occur and I'll try the 1/2 flour and 1/2 cornstarch.
Yummy!

Absolutely excellent pie! My kids along with the rest of the family loved it. Really easy to make although it took a full 30 minutes of stirring before it came to a low boil. But definitely worth it!

This was my first attempt at making a coconut cream pie and it turned out great.  I found it very easy to ollow and liked the fact that it did not require the eggs to be separated.  Delicious!

This was my first attempt at coconut cream pie.  My husband has been asking for this and of course All Recipes.com was my first reference point.  He loved this pie so much that he hid the rest of it to keep it to himself!  I will make this again and again.  I've already printed out several recipes to give to friends & family.  Can't believe the first recipe I found will be the only one I'll ever need!  Awesome!

Very good tasting pie.  I had a bit of trouble making it though.  When I first made the filling it was a bit runny and thin, but I put it in the crust anyway. I had a lot of extra filling left over.  After a couple hours in the fridge, it wasn't thickening up, so I poured it back in the pan and added a little bit of corn starch and heated and stirred it and it thickened up.  The pie then turned out very good.

A bit heavier than my other cream pies because of the flour pudding base, but tasted very nice, and the coconut toasted is an excellent idea. I prefer whipped cream to cool whip, but it tasted good anyway!

This was a wonderful coconut cream pie.  I added a meringue topping to it for added sweetness and it was raved about by all.  The young children at our gathering especially liked it.
