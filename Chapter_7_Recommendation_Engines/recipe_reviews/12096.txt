This is a fine recipe for chess pie, however, you do need to make adjustments to it before baking....The ingredients that it calls for equals enough to make two (2) pies.  And fortuneately, I just so happened to have two crusts available that day.  I did try to make it another time in a deep dish crust and it was still too much for that.  I had to cook it an extra 30 minutes and it wasn't all that great afterwards.  But it is byfar, the best CHESS PIE recipe i've came across yet.  BRAVO!!!
