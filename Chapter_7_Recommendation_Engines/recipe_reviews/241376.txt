It was delicious! I didn't have parsnips but used extra carrots and potatoes. I didn't add sugar and found it didn't need it because of the sweetness of the beets. I will definitely make it again!

This soup is awesome. My Polish grandma would be proud. I didnâ€™t have parsnips so just added another carrot and potato. Yummy

Delicious & doesn't taste weird or anyting. The eggs actually enhance the flavor somehow. Directions are easy to follow.  All Ingredients are fresh, very impressive. I subbed in organic vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. A great Valentine's or Christmas dish because of the red, I think.
