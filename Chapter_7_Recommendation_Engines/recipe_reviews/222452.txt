I liked this but it is by no means Atole or Champurrado. Atole and Champurrado are two different drinks. Atole does not contain chocolate and neither of the two are made with corn starch but with corn masa. Cinnamon sticks are used not ground cinnamon. Having said that and taking into consideration that this is an Americanized fusion of two Mexican drinks, it is tasty.
