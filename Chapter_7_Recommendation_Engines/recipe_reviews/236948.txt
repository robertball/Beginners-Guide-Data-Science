I've been making these for years. So much fun! (Just don't let the kids sneak any.) 
Two key things to remember - You need a high quality gummy, or they're just gonna melt and not absorb the alcohol. Also, definitely no plastic. You have to use only a glass dish when you make these - an 8" x 8" glass pan works really well. 
I just stir 'em up once or twice a day, for 7 days. They always turn out perfect. You can even freeze them for up to a year after they're made.
If vodka is not your thing this works great with rum too. Rummy Bears, anyone?!

I tried with Haribo Gummibears.  They seemed pretty good as long as they were in the refrigerator.  However, after I took them out at room temperature for they hey liquified into a gummibear jello mixture in about an hour.  I might try again but with maybe like 6 hour soak time  and then serve cold.
