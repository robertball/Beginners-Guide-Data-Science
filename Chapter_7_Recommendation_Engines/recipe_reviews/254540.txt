7.20.16  I drink a lot of breakfast smoothies, and this is one of the best that I’ve ever had!  Bing cherries have been on sale, so I’ve been trying a lot of new recipes incorporating cherries this past week.  This simply has an awesome blend of ingredients, and the perfect balance between sweet and tart.  I used frozen banana but also added a little crushed ice to reach the thicker texture that I prefer.  Viscouse, thanks for the new smoothie recipe which is going into my favorites folder.  This is a winner!

Delicious!  I used frozen and fresh lime juice... so refreshing!  I also added a cup of plain Greek yogurt for added protein and dairy.

Excellent! Used cherries & strawberries from our garden. Amazing mixture of sweet, tart & a bit nutty.
