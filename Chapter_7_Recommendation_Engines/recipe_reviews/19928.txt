After having made this recipe a few times, my mother suggested using liptons onion soup with the water. She said she worked at maid rite years ago and that is what they use. TRUST ME IT IS FABULOUS!!! We love it with the onion soup it really ups the taste!

Almost need another star for this one! I grew up in Iowa and my favorite place to stop after school for a snack was the local Maid-Rite. These sandwiches are just as I remember those lovely Maid-Rites.

Recipe as written would have gotten 4 stars, when you make one simple change, you can't give it anything less than 5 stars.  Try this before you say, ewwwwww.  Instead of water, use Coca-Cola, not diet, regular coke - superb.

These are the spittin' image of the famous Made-Rites you can find in Iowa.  Whenever we drive down that way, we always make a special detour just so we can eat these.  How cool to be able to make them at home now!  My husband requests these almost weekly.  You wouldn't think something so "plain" would be so tasty - but they really are - and so easy, too!  I like to serve them with parmesan-herb roasted potato wedges and a crisp green salad.  You can also use extra lean ground turkey if you want to go the healthier route, instead of the beef.  I saute the onion a little bit first to eliminate "onion breath".  You can wrap the burgers in waxed paper if you want, just like they do at the restaurant.  It helps keep all the good stuff in!  Thanks, Carlo - your wife got it just right!

This was very good. I made this with a little garlic powder, paprika, S&P, and beef broth instead of water. The beef itself had a great flavor. With the addition of pickles, cheese, and mustard, a great sandwich was made. UPDATE: Since I make this ALL the time, it has to be a five star recipe. I've used beef broth and chicken broth, both are excellent. To prepare the sandwiches, I spoon the meat mixture onto one side of the bun, add some onions, and on the other side I put shredded cheddar, and broil in the oven until the cheese is just melted. PERFECT.

These are a regular meal at our house now, especially when I don't feel like cooking--these are easy to throw together....I use chicken broth instead of the water & used no salt. The Worcestershire Sauce (like other stated) is a great addition too! This also freezes well.

I made this tonight for dinner. My family loved it. Not being a huge pickle fan I was a little concerned over the choice of toppings. But it was delicious as is. My kids couldn't say YUMMY enough. Very easy recipe I will make over and over again.

Very good. I have never had an actual loosemeat sandwich, but being a huge fan of the show "Roseanne" I had to try them. My boyfriend and I actually searched through Netflix to find the episode where the loosemeat sandwich is introduced on the show and watched it while we ate. We're dorks! 

The taste reminded me a bit of a loose version of a white castle burger, which I love. I modified the recipe a bit per others suggestions and mixed a packet of Lipton onion soup mix along with the water. I also added some garlic, salt, pepper, and a touch of paprika. Very Good.

I just want to mention that most midwesterners would cringe in horror at the thought of adding garlic and worcestershire and ketchup and all these other crazy ingredients. This sandwich is amazing, I've been making it just like this for years. Don't add all the extra stuff until you've tried it just like this first.

I gave this recipe four stars only because I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used chicken stock instead of water and added Worcestershire sauce.  We don’t like raw onions so I added dried chopped onion to the meat.  The sandwiches were good.  Hubby really liked it so it’s definitely a keeper.

With the onion soup mix - just like mom used to make.  Both of my parents are from Iowa and I have family there still.  I eat at this on the way through to visit.  The Maid-Rite was where Dad took Mom on their first date.  Glad to see this.

Excellent sandwich. If you add a packet of Lipton
onion soup mix, you will have yourself a maid rite sandwich. I tried it as is, the first time and we all  liked it very much. The next time I added the onion soup mix and it brought even bigger smiles. It pays to have worked at Maid rite, as a kid. It gets 5 stars either way.

OK, the reviewer who suggested using coca-cola is a genius !!!!!!!!!!!!!   It makes this recipe wonderful.  I added a couple shakes of worcestershire to it and its amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I also use panini rolls instead of regular hamburger rolls, serve it open faced with melted velveeta or cheese wiz (like the cheese wiz the best).  Excellent recipe Thank You !!

Salt the pan before adding the beef to begin browning.  While browning, constantly break up the meat with the back of a spoon to make the pieces as small as possible.  You may not need 1 1/2 cups of water; it should just cover the meat.  With these changes, this will be a lot closer to the real Loosemeat Sandwiches or Maid Rites.  To soften the buns, steam on top of the meat for several seconds.

Meh. Not great, but not bad either. My fiance liked these quite a bit & requested that I make them again - soon! These brought back fond memories of his days at the U of IA. He said that the dorm cafeteria served loosemeat sandwiches a couple of times a month. I have never had an "authentic" Maide-Rite loosemeat sandwich, but am aware of them from watching the Roseanne show, & of course, after meeting my fiance :) These are basically plain 'ol burgers in "loose" form (like sloppy joes w/o the sauce). I followed ravnmommy's suggestion to add a packet of Lipton onion soup mix, but also added several "shakes" of W sauce, a LOT of pepper (my fiance remembers loosemeats having a distinct peppery taste) & a few dashes of garlic powder for a flavor boost. I can't believe other's haven't found ravnmommy's review helpful. It seems as if she knows the "in-house" secret. All of the other reviews, although helpful, offered basically the SAME suggestion (i.e. beef broth or boullion/H2O, minced onion, etc.). I think using Liption seasoning made more sense (IMHO). Oh, I steamed my sesame kaiser rolls for a min. or so (on top of the meat mix.) and really enjoyed that. Topped my burger w/ American cheese, dill pickles & a bit of mustard. My fiance topped his w/ dills. Served w/ chips, this was a quick, effortless meal nonetheless. Thx. for sharing, Carlo :)

THESE are great! My husband does not like dill pickles so put hot pepper hoagie relish on his. I put the pepper relish and pickles on mine. I did brown the meat in butter with onion, used chicken broth instead of water and served in hot dog rolls (all I had) which kept the meat in & less messy. I put white American cheese on and baked in foil for 10 min.  Tastes like a poor man's Philly Cheese Steak.....this will be a regular lunch item in our house. Next time I might try a little bit of pizza sauce on the roll before baking.  USE A POTATO MASHER to help break up the meat!!

(The original recipe was great exactly as is and definitely 5 stars, but changing it up a bit made it even better, imo.) I cooked the ground beef w/chopped onion and covered halfway during cooking to steam beef.  I also followed another reviewers suggestion and replaced the water with one can of chicken broth, a little Worcestershire  and added half a teaspoon of paprika.  This was delicious.

These were really good for something different. I halved the recipe and used half a package of dried onion soup instead of adding raw at the end. We'll probably do these again in the future.

I don't usually review a recipe if I have changed it but this time I will. I took the advice of another reviewer and used cola instead of plain water. I know it sounds weird but it was excellent. I did everything else the same. These were very good sandwiches. It will go in my keeper box.

This was okay.  I've never had a loose meat sandwich.  Tried with chicken broth and a little bit of worcestershire.

MAID-RITE PURISTS take heed! This recipe turns out a dead-ringer!Did not change one thing in the recipe. You must simmer all the water off, this gives you the pure beef flavor and a potato masher works perfectly to break up the meat - do this after browning and again after steaming if needed. Mustard, dill pickles and chopped onion is the customary topping but an added slice of American cheese also is good. Great recipe.

These were pretty good.  I used broth instead of water and added garlic powder & minced onion.

I placed the tops of the buns on top of the meat while still in the pan to steam the buns; maybe for a minute. I also warmed the pickles and onion so that they would blend with the hot meat and added cheese. Tasted exactly like White Castles or Krystals (whichever you normally prefer). Will definitely make this again.

I don't know why I didn't realize this when I read the recipe but the first bite was a dead giveaway...these taste like Krystal burgers! If you're not familiar with Krystal's they're pretty much the same as White Castle, but better in my humble opinion.
This is so easy to make and so very tasty. My family adores Krystals but we don't have one nearby. Now we can get that wonderful flavor without having to leave home. 
Make sure to use the pickles and mustard as they really are the secret to the wonderful flavor of this sandwich.
Thanks Carlo!

I had these in Missouri and these tasted exactly like them. We since moved and now we dont have them here, now we can enjoy them at home. They are so easy as well. These are my favorite burgers! Thanks for this recipe!

We have MaidRites in Ohio as well. I was raised making these with a can of beer in lieu of the water and placed on slider buns.  Yummy with some cuts of onions.

Wow, these were so good. Such an easy recipe but the flavor was surprisingly great!
What does the time simmered in water do to the meat? I just don't understand the reason for that step.

I cooked the meat with water and onion soup mix.  When I browned the meat before putting the water in it didn't have the right texture for loosemeat.  But cooking it in the water gave it the perfect texture!

I used the Lipton Onion Soup mix like another reviewer suggested and the sandwiches turned out FANTASTIC!! My husband, brother, and a friend of ours ate every last bit, and would have eaten more had I made a bigger batch. My husband told me he will be requesting them again soon. These are great with mustard, onions, and pickles.. My brother asked for BBQ sauce and onions and said it was great that way, too!

This was alright, not melt in your mouth great, but not horrible either. I made mine with beef stock, it was easy and I might make it again in a pinch, but nothing that is going to be an over over again meal/lunch at my house.

These were good -- not exactly like the Maid Rites I remember from childhood, but close!  I added some sauteed, diced onion, too.  Update:  I read somewhere that Maid Rite actually steams their meat.  No idea how to do that at home, but I did take some extra that I had frozen and reheated it in the vege steamer and it was really good!

My sister just had a baby and I made this so she could have something fast to throw together. I'm giving this three stars because it was convenient, but not very good. It just seemed bland to me. Maybe if it was a mixture of meats or if it had some more spices it would be good. Needs altering.

At least it was edible.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this basically is nothing more than cooked ground beef with some salt and pepper added in.  Seriously - nothing magical happens to the taste of it when you add on the mustard and pickle.  Is this some depression era inspired dish?  I even used beef broth and season salt to add some flavor to it, and still it was bland. I feel like I wasted my ground sirloin.  My kids liked it; however, my husband and I thought it was not that great.

This has become an instant favorite and we can hardly wait to make them again. Its been a long time since i've had a maid-rite and these lived up to the memory. I halved the recipe and used chicken broth instead of water. We ate them with fries and vanilla malts and were so stuffed that we could barely move afterwards.

This was FANTASTIC!!  I did change a few things.  I carmelized my onion and added it to the meat with the seasonings (with garlic) and beef broth instead of water.  We steamed the buns over the meat before putting them together.  
It was like a great "MOIST" old fashioned hamburger.  YUM!

So yummy!  I used beef broth instead of water, and added a little worchestershire sauce and a tablespoon of mustard to the beef while it was cooking.  Also sauteed the onions and mixed them in.  Reminded me of White Castles!

I used 10 lbs. of hamburger and made them in my roaster for a crowd. They were perfect. Simple, easy, and you can use the leftovers in anything. I cooked the meat right in the roaster. I'm from Iowa and these brought back fond memories of church suppers and potlucks. Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best ones!

When I make these, I add some dried onion (start with 1 tablespoon) along with the hamburger, salt and pepper.  Drain fat and then add the water.  When putting sandwiches together, add a slice of american cheese on bun top and then pile meat on bottom of bun.  Add dill pickle slice on top of meat.  This stuff is wonderful.  Can't get enough of them!!!!  (I leave out the mustard, tastes great without!!!)

I have never tasted one of these and only know about them from the show Roseanne. I came across this recipe when I was trying to find a quick easy way to fix ground beef. This really hit the spot! I only made minor changes; extra salt & pepper and some garlic salt. We did find them a bit messy and difficult to eat but after we wrapped them in wax paper it was fine!

Instead of using raw onions as a topping I added it with the salt and pepper.
My son, who in our house is the pickest eater on the face of the earth, ate an
entire serving with out one complaint.

I just made this for dinner. I couldn't bring myself to simmer
Cooked hamburger in water so I did switch it to beef broth.
Even still it was sort of bland. It did help some adding the
mustard and pickles. Sorry, will not make again.

A wonderful blast from the past. I used chicken stock instead of plain water, as others have suggested. After trying several recipes for this, I've found THE ONE. Thank you, thank you! Tastes just like I remember.

This is a great recipe.  It knocked my sloppy Joe recipe out of our dinner menu rotation for quite a while, as this recipe is quick and easier to make than my SJ recipe.

Very tasty and made a nice hot meal. I used beef consomme instead of water and some onion powder cooked in the meat instead of fresh onion. I enjoyed this.

These are really good.  I read the reviews and added a packet of onion soup mix.  Other recipes for Loose-meat sandwiches call for more water and a longer simmering time.  Because of that, I added 1/2 cup more water and about 20 additional minutes simmering on low.  The meat turned out juicy and well flavored.  There was a Maid Rite down the street where I grew up but I moved away when I was 10.  I think this is close; it brought back some memories.

We took other reviewers' suggestions and went with chicken broth instead of water, and added some Worcestershire and paprika. We loved what the mustard, dill pickles and onions did for the sandwiches. YUM!

This was very good.  I added some Worcestershire sauce and used chicken broth instead of water as others had suggested and it gave it a nice flavor, although it was a bit salty... perhaps from the broth.  Next time I will cut back on the salt.

delicious!  Just like the local burger place I go to but I can make it less greasy by draining the meat.  All the flavor without the grease!  I like mine with american cheese and extra onions :)

Delicious! Reminds me of my favorite "little" sandwiches back home. I did add some spices to suit my own tastes. I used chicken broth in place of water. I used season salt in place of regular salt. I loved it! Easy, quick and low budget! A staple in my rotation from now on. Thank you for sharing this!

Very good recipe, I just added and switched a few things. Instead of water, I used chicken broth. I also threw some chopped onion in to cook with the meat, along with a sprinkle of garlic powder and paprika. And along with the mustard and pickle, I melted some cheese dip, and threw it on top! Very yummy.

As a girl from Iowa, these do bring back memories of the days of going to the Maid-Rite shop and getting a loosemeat sandwich.  Very good, tastes just like the ones from the sandwich shop.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good - my kids enjoyed these sandwiches.  I added a dash of worchestershire like others did - not sure if it made a difference though.  I put chopped onion, pickles and mustard on mine, it was pretty tasty.  I just wish they were easier to eat.  With out the tomato "glue" holding them together - they were way messier then a traditional sloppy joe.

These were pretty good. I sauteed onions in with the beef & added Worchestershire sauce & a dash of garlic powder. I used beef broth instead of water.  I didn't braise the meat as long as I should after about 20 mins there was still a lot of liquid left & my husband drained the meat. I think if I had waited I would have liked these better. I used hamburger buns but I think kaiser rolls would be better next  time. We just topped with mustard, don't like pickles. I will try the recipe again. Thanks.

I don't even know what to say about these...they are just ground beef...  After reading the rave reviews I thought I would give them a try and maybe something magical would happen with the salt, pepper and water...but no...maybe it's because I've never had this sandwich in Iowa like many other reviewers so I wasn't searching for a recipe like this.  My husband loved it--hence the 4 stars.  I would have given it 3.  It's definitely edible, but definitely not spectacular!  It's better with cheese.

Oh my goodness! These were so good!  I must be sheltered as I've never had a loose-meat sandwich in my life.  I stumbled across this recipe when I didn't know what to do with the ground beef I needed to get rid of.  Delicious just as is!  I will be making these often!

Being an Iowa girl, this brings back fond memories.  I did add a little garlic.  These will be a staple in our family.  Everyone loved them.  I loved that they were so easy and simple!

Very good.  Broad appeal with families.  I think the key is the toppings as the meat is mild flavored.  Try horseradish sauce on these also.

The entire family loved this recipe! It's so simple, yet very tasty. I added a bit more pepper and a little garlic, too. I think this may become one of our "regular" meals.:)

I was very happy with this recipe!  It was easy and very good.  I added in beef boullion to the water for some extra flavor, and I cooked the onions and added some mushrooms as well.  It was great! :)

I took a few of the suggestions and made it my own. I used chicken broth in place of the water and added a packet of Lipton Beefy Onion. Topped with pickles and cheese! YUMMM!!

As the recipe reads it is a solid recipe. It is important to start with a cold skillet and keep stirring and breaking apart the clumps so that it is truly a loose meat "Maidrite" style. After doing this recipe several times I do prefer the Lipton onion soup mix added with the water. It makes it taste very authentic to the inspiration of Maidrite. Can't go wrong with recipe especially if you add the onion soup.

This is a recipe I make regularly because it is yummy.  A little labor intensive with the mixing of the meat to break it up, but it is very tasty.

This is the REAL DEAL. I know cuz I asked a gal working at a Maidrite stand for the recipe & this is it. Forget all the fancy add-ins, just make them like this. Serve on soft steamed plain old white hamburger buns (I just put cut halves of buns over top of meat in pan to steam a little bit, & serve ONLY with mustard, dill pickle slices & chopped white onions  ...NO CATSUP ALLOWED !

I chopped the onion very fine and substituted beef broth for water. Cooked over very low heat for about 40min. uncovered until broth was soaked into the loose ground beef. Put on bun with slotted spoon and topped with extra thin slices of provolone cheese. Delicious!!

So simple but sooo good. YUM-MY! Only thing different was beef boullion instead of water. Let it simmer til the liquid absorbed. Steamed the buns on the meat, added American cheese put that back in the pan for less than 1 min, just like the aforementioned burger joints.......will do over & over. The kids LOVE this. Simple, cheap & absolutely delish!!!

I cook the hamburger as he says, sorta chopping it up fine, when water is gone, put on a hamburger bun spread the bun first both top and bottom with mustard heavy if you like more, put hamburger, chopped onions and sliced dill pickles on top cover with top bun, wrap immediately in wax paper.  Do not put ketchup or anything else on this, this is a exact duplicate of a Maidrite hamburger sold in Maidrite restaurants .

Delicious and Easy.  Was suprised by how easy they were.  Will make them again.  Although the broth additions sounded interesting, I like to make and rate recipes the way they are written the first time and this was exactly how they taste from Tastees in Sioux City.

Great, simple meal.  We had this for dinner tonight and really liked it. You wouldn't think it, but the mix of onions, mustard and pickles have a great balance and give this sandwich it's great taste with the lightly seasoned hamburger.

Loved this sandwich, as did my five year old son.  'Devoured' is what I would say he did to it. My other half thought it was ok, but not great.  He skipped the pickles and mustard and put cheese on his which may have made the difference. But if my 5 year old gave it thumbs up it gets 5 stars from me : )

I didn't care for this at all. It's extraordinarily messy and tastes pretty much like crumbled hamburger, which is essentially all it is. Even my boyfriend, who eats anything and everything, ended up dumping the meat into a pot of spaghetti sauce instead of eating it as is. We'll stick to hamburger patties.

These were AWESOME!! I've never been to the Midwest, so I don't know what they are supposed to taste like, but to me they tasted like a Krystal. Used beef broth, topped them with American cheese, and wrapped in wax paper. YUMMY!! Can't wait to make again.

I enjoyed this sandwich very much!  I was skeptical at first, but have to tell you .. I will definitely have this again.  It's almost too simple to be so tasty .. but this gal was pleasantly surprised.

This got mixed reviews: 72M, 62F, and 10F didn't finish theirs; 31M, 28F, and very kind 13F ate two. Made double the amount for guests that didn't show up and it took much longer than expected, and there's lots left over. Tomorrow we will have a burrito bar available! I was asked odd questions while this was cooking ('How does it hold together?') and they seemed unimpressed. Apparently, we don't have big mustard and pickle fans.

I am amazed how good this simple recipe is.  My four-year-old wouldn't touch it and even ate his brussle sprouts first.  After the first bite he asked for a second sandwich!  Will make again.

This was really good and pretty quick to cook up on a busy school night!!  The whole family loved it...my husband said the sandwich reminds him of a Quarter Pounder from McD's-without the upset stomach after!!!

These are great when you're looking for a quick, tasty meal. I like to serve these with potato salad and baked beans...reminds me of cooking out in summer while we're in the thick of winter. Thanks!

A little plain, even with the mustard and pickles.  But still tasty.

I'm rating this right down the middle cause I'm torn on what to rate it...the taste actually was pretty good for all the more it was but they were a disaster to eat...it is like a hamburger...but sloppy joe style...my problem was nothing holding it together so it was falling everywhere.Taste-wise though-no complaints.

I cut this recipe in 1/2 and added just a dash of garlic powder.  It tasted good but really was just a messy hamburger.

Used buffalo meat instead was terrific.  Hit with entire family, and so easy to make.
