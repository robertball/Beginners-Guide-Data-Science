This recipe was very good. Tangy and flavourful. I omitted one can of the tomato paste and the half/half cream only because I did not have them and the recipe still tasted good. I also cooked it with abut 250g ground beef instead of left over meat.

I was a little leery about a pasta sauce recipe that included cinnamon or nutmeg and cream but tried it anyway.  I made a few adjustments but pretty much followed the recipe as written.   I only used one can of tomato paste and used a large jar of my homemade tomato sauce.  I also just used regular red wine and not cooking wine (not sure what the difference is).  I used the nutmeg and added about 1/2 tsp of salt.  It was a bit on the sweet side but very tasty - my husband quite liked it.  I will use this again when I have leftover roast beef.  Thanks.
