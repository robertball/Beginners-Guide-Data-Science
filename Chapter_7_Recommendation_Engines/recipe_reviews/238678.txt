This was just ok for me.  I had a hard time *finding* any of the seasonings and had to resort to pressing my bread into the plate, resulting in a super soaked bite (w/some flavor, though).  I was also surprised to find it a bit salty, which is something I rarely if ever, say.  This is a recipe to use your good EVOO for, for sure, as oil quality will make a marked difference.  While it probably won't be a repeater at the LTH house, YOU should still give it a try for sure.  THANKS for the recipe!

As I was getting my ingredients out, I discovered I had no oregano, but I did have Italian seasoning, so I used that instead and doubled the amount. I also doubled the amount of garlic because, well, you can’t have too much garlic! I let the flavors blend for about an hour. Then, after I poured the oil into my dipping bowl, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top before dipping my bread. OMG! This was the best thing I’ve eaten in some time!

I made this once and it was good on its own... Next time I made it I added 1 tsp balsamic and a few minced basil leaves. That kicked it up to 6 stars!

So simple and delicious. No need to buy the store pre-made seasoning when all these ingredients are right in your pantry! Much less expensive too!
