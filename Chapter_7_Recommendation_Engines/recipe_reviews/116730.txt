in one word... DELICIOUS!!!  the only thing i didnt do was to remove the "hairs" inside the the artichoke because i always have a problem doing that until after they are cooked, my microwave required a little more time only because it's older than dirt but they turned out fabulous! artichokes are my favorite vegtable so it's always nice to have a variety of ways to make them thank you for a recipe that will be kept and used often!

Who knew microwaved would be ok???  I ran out of time and made this as a last resort.  It came out great!  I will not be making it on a regular basis (I prefer roasted) but when I have to watch my time, this was great.  Taste was good and the heart was done enough to eat and enjoy.  (I had worried about microwaving)  I had a hard time cutting out choke before cooking.

This was awesome!  I didn't think it would turn out that great in the microwave,  but it was perfect and my family loved it.  Thanks!

This was an easy and delicious way to prepare artichokes, especially for someone new to cooking them.  I used one lemon that I zested and 6 tablespoons of butter and a bit of fresh cracked black pepper, too.  The lemon-garlic sauce was great to dip bread in as well.
