This salad is summery. Its wonderful flavors glance the taste buds gracefully. I was surprised by the mix of kidney beans and tuna. I recommend this one to anyone. No, make that everyone.

I left out the olive oil and the cheese for a lighter lunch and it is fantastic.  I also add some chopped cucumber.

This was fantastic! I used a 15.5 oz can kidney beans to three cans of tuna; yield was three large pita sandwiches. Threw in red pepper because I had it; omitted olives and cilantro because I didn't have those. BF made his a tuna melt but I left the cheese out. Now, the DRESSING: is great! I was so tempted to throw a little mayo in for creaminess - this dressing is so much better than mayo. It may just become my standard tuna dressing.

Excellent!  I threw in chopped tomatoes and fresh parsley.  Used shallots instead of red onion.  I would double the dressing next time. Served on toasted pita.  A good and healthy lunch!

I omitted the cheese and used black olives.  Wasn't sure which kind to use.  I like the fact I will not feel guilty after eating this salad; it's healthy & simple.  It's almost TOO light and refreshing, lol.  Perhaps a chopped apple would help the textures.

We really liked this recipe on a hot summers night. I made it because we had all the ingredients on hand. Don't know what I could have to done to make it 5 stars but it was a good solid recipe that will be a regular. Thanks!

Made without fresh cilantro, and used a dash of coriander seed instead. Served on boats of Romaine lettuce. Fresh, clean and healthy-tasting. I kept wanting to add more salt at the table, but fought it for that would have defeated the nutritionality of this dish.

i used my own dried beans mixture, cooking them on low heat an hour and Romano cheese and oregano instaed of the parsley.  It was a hit on top of baby spinach.

Different combination of protein: beans and tuna.  I did not have cheddar cheese used goat cheese; had spanish olives, sliced in half, added sweet green pepper for color, no cilantro and used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Using any basic recipe and exchanging ingredients on hand makes for interesting meals.  Had to add sweetness to dressing - too tart.  All in all - tasty, nutritous and colorful.  Still around 200 calories per 1/2 cup.

Very good.  Had to modify it a bit to work with what I had on hand.  Used lemon juice instead of lime, and left out the olives and cilantro.  Would be good to throw in lots of different veggies not listed here.  Also, served it over rice noodles -- yum!

Delicious. I used cucumber instead of celery and diced pepper instead of onion since that is what I had on hand. I also subbed fresh basil for the cilantrol and thyme for the dill. It turned out great. My ten month old daughter agrees!

This is a great "starter" recipe to use as a base and change up the ingredients.  I don't like cilantro, so left it out, used black beans instead of kidney beans, have increased or decreased various things and it changed the taste, but was still great.  The key is the dressing! It is great on rice crackers, too. This is one of the oddest, but best recipes I have ever made!

This was surprisingly delicious!  I stumbled upon this recipe while searching for meal ideas that would fit into my new diet.  This fit the bill, so I gave it a try in the hopes that it would be pretty tasty.  This far exceeded my expectations and is now my favorite way to prepare tuna for my lunch.  I recommend either rolling it up taco style in a lettuce leaf or just piling it on top of a salad -- it doesn't even need dressing!

Pretty good, I didn't have olives or celery (wish I had) so I added grape tomatoes sliced up and tossed with the dressing. It was okay so then I added the mixture ontop of a green salad and drizzled a little italian dressing. Now it is really good and fresh! Next time I will mix all ingredients and omit the dressing, just put on a salad with a store bought dressing, much better this way. Thanks for the recipe!

I used a whole can of beans and 10 oz. of tuna.  The dill taste was a little too strong for me so I will cut that down a little next time.  I left out the olives (don't like them) and the cheese (to cut calories).  I only used 1 TB of olive oil and it was plenty.  I will definately make this again.

I doubled the recipe and had some fresh tomatoes so I added a half a tomato. Very nice. Might want to make a little extra dressing for the side.

WOW - I was so surprised how light and delicious this salad tasted. I would have never thought to put kidney beans with tuna. The dressing is so simple and tasty and the cilantro just puts the flavor over the top! I left out the cheese and olive oil to reduce calories, left out the onion because I didn't have any. Served it over romain lettuce and topped with a couple of sliced tomatoes that needed to be used. FAB! Thanks so much for a healthy, tasty recipe that is quick to throw togther for lunch! Love it!

this recipe sounded good, but i found the combination to have a bitter, sour kind of taste.  though i like dill, in this it was over-powering.  I'm wondering if the measurement could have been for fresh.  i think some form of this could be good, but this one didn't do it for me.  sorry.

OMG!!! This salad is amazing!! was looking for something light on a hot day and this fit the bill. I had all ingredients on hand and did not change a thing. Yummy!! The dressing is the best part and I will be using it as a regular one. I recommend doubling the dressing since it doesn't make much

Wow, this was so good even b4 soaking in the fridge for any length of time! My husband tasted it right after it was done and was blown away!! It takes some time to prepare, but it's worth all the effort. I followed the recipe exactly except I used some pinto beans w/ the kidney beans and added only about 3/4 tsp dill weed. Will definately make this again!!! I would use a bit less salt the next time, though. Update: The nutrition facts seemed way off to me so I did research and discovered that it has more like 300 calories per cup and that is on the high side. I wonder if it should say 432 calories per serving??

If I ate with my eyes this would be 5 stars because it looked really good and colorful. made as written the flavors were just ok though. Sorry. I'll raise if from 2 stars to 3 because it was a good way to use some leftover veggies I had in the fridge.
