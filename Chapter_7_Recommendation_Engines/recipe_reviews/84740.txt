Thank you, I always cook pig tails. Only after the boiling point, let cool and remove all bones. I add a package of baby lima's, a large chopped onion,one tsp. garlic and black pepper. Cornbread goes great. I usually freeze a couple containers and serve as a side for another day.

I wasn't sure what to do with the garlic so I boiled it along with the pig tails. The pig tails came out exactly the way they did in picture, however the meat had no taste. I am not sure how to improve the taste.

I've never had pig tails before.I see them in the store and a friend makes Stone Stew and includes them along with some other "stuff". I think I'll have these along with my blackeyes and collards for New Year's Day. Keryne, you're a true Nubian Soul with your recipes.  Keep them coming!

This is a great recipe, and though I haven't made this recipe exactly, I've been eating pigtails all my life.   I usually take them to the next level of deliciousness, while roasting them, by glazing them with a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce until they are fork tender; alternating between having them covered, and uncovered, with each addition of the sauce, every thirty minutes until done.   Serve with some collard greens, mac & cheese, and cornbread, and you'll slap yo' self for not making this sooner.  This also works with fresh ham hocks, but the pigtails are awesome.

I've tried this recipe because it seemed the closest to what my grandfather used, but instead of the basic seasonings I added some thyme, distilled vinegar, and garlic powder. Plus more salt and crushed peppers than indicated in the original recipe. Also I used a crock pot instead. Turned out perfect!!!

I have not tried this recipe as yet but it sounds amazing. I love salted pig tail and use it in many dishes, it has such an awesome flavour but I've never tried this. I'm going to go out and buy some and try this as soon as possible. I am also from the Caribbean. Thanks for the great idea!
