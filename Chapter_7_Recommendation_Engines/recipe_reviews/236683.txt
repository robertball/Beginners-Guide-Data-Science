I made this last night for my husband and I.  It was OUTSTANDING!!  We are on the Daniel Fast, and this recipe turned quinoa into a mouth-watering, flavorful fusion of fresh ingredients!  I used red bell peppers instead of green, and it just added the perfect amount of color to make the dish beautiful.  I wish I had taken a photo of mine--next time.  I will keep this one forever and even make it for company to introduce others to the wonderful world of quinoa!  Thank you HeidiM!

This was surprisingly tasty. I completely understand the prior reviewer's comment that they went back for seconds--not because they were hungry--but because it was so flavorful (we did the same). I paired this with a sweet slaw made with green cabbage, raisins, apples, mayo, and maple syrup, which made a nice contrast between soft and spicy and the sweet and crunchy (my husband requested that when I make this recipe again that I make the slaw again, too, to go with it.
I made the recipe as written except for a couple of minor changes: I didn't have low sodium soy sauce on hand so I reduced the soy sauce by half; also, because my family doesn't tolerate spicy heat as well as I do, I used only 1/2 tablespoon of the hot chili paste and it worked well for them...just a background hint of heat without being uncomfortable.
Yep, this one is a keeper!

Very easy to make, packed SO MUCH more flavor than a lot of quinoa recipes, and even got rave reviews from meat eaters:).  It was also excellent the next day for leftovers.

I'd never used quinoa in a stir-fry and geatly appreciate this versatile recipe. Previously cooked quinoa reduced the cooking time of this great recipe.  I modified it to use on-hand ingredients: tofu instead of edamame; ground red pepper instead of hot chile paste; ground ginger instead of fresh.  As I was also cooking for a carnivore, I incorporated the Shrimp Quinoa recipe that I found on this site which called for asparagus, raisins, and mushrooms.  Since I didn't have enough asparagus for two (& hubby doesn't care that much for it), I also added broccoli. Both frozen vegetables defrosted in the microwave while I diced the onion, pepper, and garlic. I prepared everything for two until I got to "step 4" (adding the deveined uncooked shrimp prepared while the veggies sauteed) at which time I plated my portion (including the asparagus). Hubby enjoyed his portion too!

Instead of making the quinoa from scratch, just adding two packages of cooked brown rice mixed with quinoa (available at Costco) to the veggie mixture is easier and VERY tasty.  This also does not have to be reheated, it tastes great cold .  I had already cut the recipe down to four servings, so two pkgs of the quinoa/rice is for that setting.

This is so good! The soy sauce and fresh ginger mix so well with the quinoa (it might seem like a lot of quinoa, but trust me the sauce covers it all). You definitely want to use fresh ginger for this. I'm planning to use this as a meal prep recipe for healthy lunches!

So yummy!  Didn't add any edamame.  I wish I could have gotten the water to boil down a bit more in the quinoa

Delicious! I put the quinoa, water and bouillon in my rice cooker and added the edamame to the onion pepper mixture with the garlic and ginger. I left out the chile paste and it was still a little spicy. But so yummy.

Flavor was just ok and the edamame didn't flow well with the texture of the dish.

Enjoyed this flavor twist on quinoa from the other ways I've made it. Great blend of textures and flavors. I tried this because I had nearly all the ingredients on hand already... I subbed Sriracha for the heat and ginger powder instead of fresh. This will be a great dairy-free lunch box food. ...I might try adding crushed peanuts on top before serving next time.

I couldn't find the chili paste so it wasn't terribly spicy but kids ate it so it was probably just as well.
