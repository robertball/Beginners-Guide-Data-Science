I've never made corn fritters before and this recipe came out perfect! At first I thought the dough was a little too thick/dry, but I kept stirring it and did not add any liquid.  I dropped the dough by spoonfulls into the deep fryer and they turned out just right!! My husband even thought they were really good.  This recipe is right on, I got exactly 11 beautiful fritters and didn't change a thing.  Thanks, I'm sure I'll make these again.

Delicious, but I changed sugar to 1 Tablespoon and used 1 can of cream style corn. I'll definitely make them again.

These were terrific! Crisp on the outside, tender on the inside. Even after they cooled and weren't crisp, they had a great flavor. One of my guests was embarrassed because he couldn't stop eating them! And so easy to make, too. I'll be making these again and again. Thanks for the recipe! BTW, mine came out like little round balls, not flat as in the photo posted.

This was very good.  I had never had corn fritters.  I saw the maple syrup to dip them in and thought- GROSS!  Made them exactly as written for my husband.   I tried dipping them in maple syrup and they were incredible.  I was so wrong.  These are great plain as a side for bread/veg or with the syrup or dusted in powder sugar as a bread/dessert.  Thank you!

My mother used to make corn fritters and I did not get the recipe from her before her passing.  When she served them, jelly or preserves were the toppings of choice, and it was a side dish with our dinner.  This recipe is so close to hers, it took all of us back to when she was the cook!  I took the advice of another review which was to increase the sugar as well as the creamed corn.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!

I like the fact that the batter is light.  It's an easy recipe and quick.  I think it needs more corn, because the majority of the flavor comes from the honey or syrup.

Excellent!! They are puffy and very easy to make. I would double the ingredients next time.  Although the fritters are a bit sweet, they would be also good without sugar and dipped into ketsup and mustard.

This was a great way to use up leftover corn on the cob. They were very easy to make. I pan fried instead of deep frying. I thought it needed a lot of maple syrup. They didn't have a lot of flavor by themselves.

This was one of my favorite treats a child, especially dipped in maple syrup. I haven't had them in years but after finding this recipe I made them for my 2 little picky eaters and they gobbled them up. Thank you for posting!

These were good and I might add that I've been looking for a recipe to duplicate my mom's corn fritters for 35 years.  I didn't deep fry them but cooked the batter by heaping tablespoons in about a 1/4" of veggie oil.  I added red paper to maybe three of them (my granddaughter will not tolerate anything spicy), and they were good too.

Excellent.  Omitted the tiny amount of sugar since serving with maple syrup.  That extra bit of sugar is entirely unnecessary.  Delicious finished product.

Made these  tasty fritters. Easy to follow recipe, although, I used a little more milk to thin them out. And, I did drizzle a bit of honey over top.

I used to make corn fritters years ago and for some reason recently started craving them.  I couldn't find my old recipe so found this while on the hunt.  Made the exactly as written and they were FANTASTIC!  Definitely hit the spot.  Thank you!

Was ALMOST like Moms (God rest her soul). The only thing I did different (which my Mom did) was to add a TON more sugar (half a cup) and a tablespoon or two of Vanilla extract. Sprinkle on (when done) a bit with either cinnamon and nutmeg (or both) will "spice" things up, even more. With theses added things; this turned out GREAT!!! (just like Mom made [100%]). I purchased some "premium" Maple Syrup (from Vermont), via Amazon, and it really made my head (and tongue) spin!! - LOL :-) The trick is always to get the batter to form into the proper "ball" form (solution: Make sure your cooking oil is REALLY HOT!!). Use either tongs, or chopsticks, to rotate balls, while cooking (otherwise, one side will get too well done). So overall, dee...lish [5 star, for taste] -- try it out (you will NOT be disappointed!!)

My first time making these and they are so good.  I put powdered sugar on them.  Doubled recipe.  These are easy and my son loves them.  Gets a little vegetable in him.

Mine didn't make the nice patties as shown in the picture, more like free-form blobs, but the taste was amazing and the texture was perfect. I can't say I'll be breaking out the deep fryer for breakfast all that often, but these are worth doing it once in a while!

Fabulous, easy and tasty though I left out the sugar, used whole wheat flour, egg substitute (soy flour n water) with a little lemon pepper and sea salt. I also shallow fried them because I was almost out of oil, but the recipe basically rocked my socks!

Wow!  i can't believe I forgot to rate these.  Came back to make these again because they are tremendous!  I might prefer my apple fritters - but those are quite a bit of fuss.  THESE?  they are faster, and wonderful anyway!  Oh, and the maple syrup is perfect with these!   Thanks, Niki!

Great taste. For some reason mine did not get very flat. I used a fry pan with oil instead of a deep fryer not sure if that mattered but they tasted great.
