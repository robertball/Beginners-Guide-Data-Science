Great tasting recipe!  Just a couple of things, though:  the amount of breading is enough for three preparations of this recipe (this isn't a guess, I actually used it three times ... I divided it up before I breaded the fish, 'cause you don't want to use breading that's touched the fish, obviously).  I kept the extra breading in the fridge b/c of the parmesan.  Also, you can use regular milk instead of evaporated, and much less melted butter than the recipe calls for (I think I used 1/4 cup).  This recipe was great on red snapper as well!  My little girls LOVE this recipe.

My husband and kids really loved the recipe.  I didn't have the canned milk so I just marinated in regular milk for the day in the fridge.  I also added some breadcrumbs to the top before I drizzled the butter.  It was very good and easy to prepare.

Wonderful! I've never had such moist, flavorful catfish-even my kids loved it! Definitely worth the wait to marinate!

The flavor and texture are both wonderful in this easy to prepare dish. I only had time to marinate the fish about 2 hours, but it still came out juicy and tender. Husband and son raved. I did whip up a litte lemon/butter sauce to serve on top, but it really wasn't needed.

This fish was excellent. I marinated my fish in whole milk overnite and I prepared the flour mixture in a ziplock bag so that it would be easy to coat the fish.  I reduced the amount of flour to about 3/4 of a cup but left the other seasonings the same because I like seaoning.  There was extra mixture leftover but the fish was so good I didnt care.  I did reduce the amount of butter to about 1/4 and my fish browned very nicely.  HIGHLY recommend, both my husband and little girl loved it.

Very good and tasty. As stated in a previous review a lot of flour mixture was left over, so I divided it up before I used it. After baking, the coating was slightly wet, so I broiled for 8-10 minutes. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice on top, and use tartar sauce for dipping.

This recipe was great!  I added a few dashes of Essence of Emeril to the breading after reading it could be bland.  The flavor was awesome and my kids loved it!  I even forgot to add the butter after breading the fish and it still tasted good!  Can't wait to try it again...

The taste of the catfish was great!  I thought it was very flavorful.  We followed the recipe to a T and marinated the fish for about 24 hours in the fridge.  Will definitely make again.

Very good recipe.  Made with catfish nuggets instead of filets.  Used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and cut the butter down to 1/2 cup.  The entire family really liked this and called it a 'keeper'.  Served with green beans and tomato salad.  Thank you for sharing.

Didn't like this at all. I cut the butter down by half and was still too much. I felt like it tasted too fatty between the fish and butter. Didn't get crispy at all.

This is the best fish recipe I've ever found, and the best recipe for parmesan dredging flour (which could probably be used for chicken, too). I reduced the amount of butter by half and it seemed perfect. The only problem I had is that it didn't want to brown in my oven. I had to put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end of the cooking time. However, the results were worth the extra trouble.

The flavors of the breading here were great, but - I don't know, my oven is insane, but my fish was cooked through after 10 minutes and never got brown at all.  The coating remained soggy and wet.  My filets were also a bit smaller than recommended, so that might have made a difference.  We liked the flavors well enough to try and make it work, though.  (I halved the breading recipe and used about 1/4 of the butter.)

this recipe was a pretty typical breaded, baked fish recipe. the only change i made was to spray the fish with butter spray instead of pouring melted butter on them - a change i make to any recipe with those instructions - and i don't think that contributed to my ho-hum feeling about this catfish.  the flavor of the coating just wasn't anything exciting to me.  i will say i enjoy the health benefits of a recipe that is breaded and baked, not fried.  thanks!

This was easy to make and very tasty!  I thought there was too much flour in this recipe, and a bit more butter than necessary, but otherwise a keeper!

This was good. Made as stated, we enjoyed it but something was missing. It almost needed something to give it a crunch.

quick and easy, I used whole milk and tweaked the spices because it sounded a little bland for my taste.  The Italian spice give the fish a unique taste that is not everyday. I had a pound of catfish and this recipe was enough for the entire pound.

This recipe is great! I made this for my husband and he could not stop talking about how good it is. The batter was way more than we needed for 4 pieces of fish, but that's okay. I just put it in the refrigerator for next time.

not a big fan...didn't like the italian twist on the catfish.  probably won't make again, although the breading made so much that I set half of it aside before flouring the fish.

About half the amount of this recipe worked for a pound of catfish nuggets.  Very good flavor!  Make sure to use a shallow baking dish so that your fish browns well.  Ended up marinating in milk (2%) and for longer than instructed, but still turned out very well.

Simple, easy, wonderful taste!~ Due to the other reviews I scaled the recipe down to 1, especially since I had olny 3 fillets.... and I still had lots of coating left. This is sure to become a new family favorite.

I cut this recipe in half for 3 fillets and it was twice as much breading as I would need, though I confess I did not measure them so perhaps they're not 8 oz each. The flavor is good, but I'll have to try and take a picture of them next time, because my pollock fillets (which were admittedly probably undersized, and for which I do not fault the recipe) got overdone and a bit unsightly. I've got another batch worth of breading left over, so I'll make these again next week with tilapia and revise my review if necessary :) I was hoping this recipe would be a good copycat for the "Parmesan Crusted Tilapia" you can get in the freezer section at Sam's but it wasn't really the same set of spices. Thanks for the recipe!

My family liked this recipe a lot.  The catfish was easy to make, cooked perfectly, and had a really nice flavor.  The only problem I had was with the amount of butter.  As another reviewer suggested I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and I thought even that was too much.  I would make it again and cut the butter down even more- just a light drizzle would be great. I used 2% milk and thought that was fine.

This wasn't bad. I am looking for a kickin' catfish recipe.  Everything I have tried on my own has failed. I did not have dry mustard or onion, substituted creole and old bay seasoning 1 tbs each. I also flashed it under the broiler at the end. Next time I'll try frying it in olive oil and half the butter.

Wasn't overly impressed with this recipe.  It was bland, and did not crisp up at all.  Wouldn't make it again.

Very good.  Followed the directions exactly except I only used 4 tbsp of butter instead of 8 tbsp.  I thought the leftovers were even better the next day.

Great fish recipe!  Like others have said, there is a lot of leftover flour mixture though.  I'll be making this one again.

I marinated in milk and 1T of concentrated lemon juice overnight. I used half the butter. It was still way too salty..However, no "muddy" catfish taste, just way too much butter. Also, the flour mixture is enough for 12 fillets, not 4, so I'd only make a third of that if you want nothing to go to waste! I put it under the broiler at the end to help brown it as well.

Tastes great! I don't know what the milk does to it and I had to skip it altogether because of time. In the absence of an oven I went for a frying pan and it was perfect. That way I cut a lot of the butter too. I had no onion/garlic powders either, so I simply finely chopped a garlic and a slice of onion. I also used mustard sauce since o didn't have seeds haha ( looks like the only thing I had was catfish). So flavorful I'm now thinking what kind of other wonderful things I can do with this recipe... Shrimp? All kinds of white fish? Chicken wings? You name it!

Added more salt and pepper, not just to taste (1 teaspoon each).  My son loved it, and asked for more the next day!

It was pretty good. Felt like it could have used a sauce. I only used 1/4c of butter. I served scampi noodles and broccoli on the side.

This is actually a good recipe. I recomend going over the reviews. My only added suggestion is to cut the butter by a third to a half to get the fish a bit more crispy, other than that I dig it.

I'm not a catfish fan so I made this just for Husband. He LOVED the seasoned coating but said he would have preferred it pan-fried in butter. I'll do that next time. Great easy recipe. Thanks, Dinah!

We thought this was pretty good.  I made a few changes, as suggested, and thought it was a great change from the way I usually make catfish.  I'll definitely use this recipe again sometime.
