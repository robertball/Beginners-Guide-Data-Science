This starter made delicious healthier bread. For the bread, I omitted pudding mix, used half white and half white whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup sugar, and 1/3 cup each applesauce and canola oil. We loved it!  I made half of the batter plain and the other half added apples and walnuts. I feel better with less sugar and oil and a bit of whole grain. Yum! I froze 3 bags, baked with one, and have one on my counter again to love for  9 more days.
