I thought this recipe was great!  Very light, healthy, and easy to make.  I changed it up a bit though.  I used fresh green beans and cut them up. I thought they added a nice healthy crunch.  I also used a Gala apple instead because that was all I had. I thought it added a nice sweetness. I also read the other reviews and decided to add some white onion also, which I thought helped kick it up a bit. I would definately make this again.  I also added salt and pepper.

I usually don't try recipes that aren't already rated.  This was just ok.  Unusual but just ok.   It seemed to be missing something but I don't know what.  I dont't know if I'll try again.

I added a small chopped onion and some fresh ground pepper and it was a good blend of flavors.

This is a great side dish for those who are on a low fat/low carb. diet.  I didn't add the oil and I didn't have granny smith's so I just used sweet apples and my family loved it.

This was pretty good. I thought it needed something before I started.  I added minced onion, fresh green beans par boiled instead of canned, and chopped walnuts.  To the dressing I added a clove of garlic, pepper, and a little Stevia.  Turned out great.

Unique, and a good way to use up the can of beets you bought on a whim. Although it was good, I agree with the other reviewer that something seemed missing. Green bean salads often have diced onion and a bit of sugar--maybe that's it? (I'd test the theory but my husband liked it fine as is, so it's almost gone.)

The salad should definitely be made with fresh or frozen, par boiled green beans.  I made it exacty as written an I 100% agree it is "missing something".  I will try adding onion to my left overs and see if it works.  My husband and daughter took a taste and then did not eat any of the rest of it.  If it works with the onion, it would be a good low calorie, healthy salad.  It is very easy to make.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I took others' advice and added onion, and would recommend using steamed fresh green beans rather than canned.

It was pretty good. I added a tsp of sugar and a few dashes of salt to my taste.
