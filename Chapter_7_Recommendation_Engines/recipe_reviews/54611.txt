I only gave this recipe three stars because  while it's very easy to make it does need some tweaking.   

One of the reasons the steak comes out tough is because in essence the steak is being boiled in the sauce and not really stir-fried.   

To ensure that your steak comes out perfect every time stir-fry the veggies, remove from the pan.  Then add the beef, stir-frying in a small amount of oil till it's done to your liking.  Remove and keep warm with the veggies.  THEN add the sauce ingredients and cook about 3 minutes, add corn starch to thicken.   Add the veggies and steak to the sauce, tossing to coat and heat through -- about 1-2 minutes.   

The steak will be perfectly cooked and your veggies will stay crisp-tender.

When I make this recipe I cut back on the vinegar and honey to about 2 TBS each and add some fresh grated ginger and red pepper flakes.

It's even better then take-out!   This recipe also works well with chicken cut into thin strips or quickly stir-fried shrimp!

This was delicious.  The only change I made was I used leftover roast beef cut in strips and I used half red wine vinegar and half balsamic vinegar.  My husband loved it.  I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch and water.  The second time I made it, I used teriyaki marinade instead of soy sauce (much less sodium) and added water chestnuts. This is a favorite recipe.  Thanks Maria

Made this recipe last night and I was a little nervous since it was my first time making pepper steak. Fantastic!! I used red,green,and yellow peppers. Used beef for stir fry already cut into thin strips. I also used low sodium soy and rice wine vinegar instead of the red and reduced it to 1/4c. Hubby loved it and said the sauce was so tasty.....I said its only 3 ingredients....it tasted like so much more. I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch/water. Will most definately make again. This was a great meal and very flavorful! Thanks!

I was looking for something to do with my steak and bell peppers, and this was great!  I never would have thought to use honey, but it worked well.  One trick to try if you have time is to marinate the sliced beef first with soy sauce and minced garlic, along with a pinch of baking soda and about a tablespoon of cornstarch.  Work that mixture into the meat with your hands, then just let it sit for half an hour.  It makes the meat really tender and even more  flavorful.

Amazing. I made this recipe as "Beef & Broccoli" (substituting the peppers for broccoli). It came out absolutely delicious! I added hot pepper flakes & garlic powder to the sauce for extra kick.. and thickened it with cornstarch.... I sprinkled sesame seeds for garnish) This dish served over brown rice was amazing!

We LOVE this recipe! I make it every couple of weeks. I've even made short-cuts that do not alter the taste.  I use a bag of frozen pepper/onion stir fry vegtables and stir fry meat (steak or even sometimes chicken).  It is always delicious!!  Thanks so much for this quick and easy recipe.

EXCELLENT recipe!....and I usualy don't eat many meals with peppers and onions. I feel like a broken record because my review seems to be much like everyone elses. But a few key things became apparent as I prepared and enjoyed this recipe. First, follow the instructions of a few others and cook the veggies first. Set them aside and then cook the beef. Set that aside. Then make the sauce and be sure to DOUBLE it - your family will love you for it.....and yes, it will be sweet, so don't hesitate to cut back on the honey a little. At the advice of others I used sirloin instead of flank...and slice it THIN - OH WOW! This meal took me at least 30 minutes to prep (cutting meat & veggies) and about another 30 minutes to cook. Yes, it is easy to fix but it will take you about an hour to get it ready. And do thicken the sauce a little with corn starch. This is an excellent meal when served over rice. Thanks for this recipe Maria.

I doubled the sauce, very good. I sauted onion, bell pepper in oil with meat, beef stir fry very lean. Then I put soy sauce, honey and red wine vinegar in a bowl to the side. After meat was done with vegeatbles I poured out water in meat then added the sauce in bowl to meat with cornstarch and WALA! GREAT.....I love it and will make again...

Absolutuely wonderful. Made this for my family and some friends and even the kids wanted more...and kids enjoying a home cooked meal are a true measure of how good a dish really is. (smile). Anyway, I made some substitutions that I should mention. Instead of flank steak I used a round roast and cut up strips, I added mushrooms, & instead of red wine vinegar, I used rice vinegar.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I think the vinegar was too overpowering.  From reading other reviews I was really expecting for it to taste like my favorite chinese restaurant.  No such luck.  The taste was very "weird" for lack of a better word.  I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

Yum, Yum, Yum!  This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I made a few minor changes though.  I used sirloin steak instead of flank steak, as it is much more tender.  I also used 3 peppers - one green, one yellow, and one red.  I cut the vinegar down to 1/8 cup and the honey down to a little less than 1/4 cup and I added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper to give it a nice little kick.  At the end of cooking time, I added 1 tbs. cornstarch mixed with 1 tbs. water and cooked it on high for a couple minutes (stirring constantly) until the sauce thickened up nicely.  I served it over steamed rice with a side of egg rolls.  My hubbie and I both loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!  :)

This recipe was outstanding.  I was a little eerie making it at first, because of a lot of the negative comments.  My husband and I loved it, and we thought it had a ton of flavor.  I actually used round steak instead of flank steak, and I did put about 1.25 T of flour into the sauce to thicken it a little.  I served it over white rice, and it was fantastic!

Very good!  I used round steak one each of a green pepper, red pepper, orange pepper, and yellow pepper.  Ended up being really pretty.  Everyone liked it.  I think next time I'll try the sauce with chicken, broccoli, mushrooms, and water chestnuts.    Thanks!

This is definitely a quick and easy recipe. I used skirt steak and it was delicious. Definitely need to thicken the sauce, if serving over rice. I cooked the beef the day before and allowed it to take in the flavor of the sauce. Then all I needed to do was cook the vegetables.

This was phenomenal. I followed the directions from another review that stated you should cook the veggies first and then remove them, and then stir-fry the steak. The meat turned out so tender and juicy, the vegetables were still crisp, and the sauce tasted absolutely delicious.

After reading the reviews I cut the vinegar and honey down to 1/4 c. each. Oh, I also added a about 2 C. of sliced mushrooms and used a combination of red, yellow and orange peppers because they were on sale. At the end of cooking I added 1T. cornstarch mixed with 2T. water to thicken it up. It went together quickly, looked great on the plate and tasted wonderful... 5 stars all the way around! :)

Absolutely delicious.   With the sauce, I used rice wine vinegar and then added extra       red wine vinegar, a little more soy sauce (low sodium), granulated garlic, ginger, orange zest and cayenne pepper. I used sliced round steak, which I had to cook longer ( an hour) to get nice and tender before adding the sauteed peppers and onions back in for about  15 min. or so. I also needed three peppers , so I chose a red one. Garnished with sauteed green onions , toasted sesame seeds and served over brown rice. Might add mushrooms next time. A real keeper recipe. Thanks, MARIACOZ!

Absolutely delicious.  Added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken.  Used red, green and yellow peppers.  Served over rice, but egg noodles would be good too.  A "keeper" for our family recipe file!  ****Update**** My family loves this recipe.  I do use about 2 teaspoons of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I don't make it with peppers anymore.  I switched to broccoli and sprinkle sesame seeds on top - thanks to the suggestions of others!  Quick and easy recipe!

I have to admit, I was skeptical about all the honey but I was pleasantly surprised! The taste was excellent! We're not big on bell peppers so I used onions, mushrooms and zucchini instead and added a mixture of black and cayenne pepper. Thanks for this great recipe!

I prepared this using the suggestion to saute veggies, remove, saute meat, remove, boil sauce w/ cornstarch until thickened, add back in meat, add back in veggies, then serve over rice.  It was good, but next time I'll add some hot pepper flakes to give it a kick.  I think the sauce was overly sweet, so next time I'll reduce the vinegar and honey.

OUTSTANDING!! Props to Rhiannon's review - follow that advice for tender meat and a nice sauce. As per other reviewers, I cut the soy sauce (low sodium and still salty enough) and rice vinegar (didn't have red wine vinegar) to 1/4 cup but doubled it; used only 1/4 cup honey and then squirted in a little more when it was in the pan. Used corn starch to thicken. Added some red pepper flakes for my spicy BF. Served over basmati rice. It's restaurant good.

It turned out excellent, my husband and son loved it.  I did however, take the advice of others and made the following changes: (1) substitued Sirloin, (2) doubled the soy sauce, (3) halved the honey and vinegar and (4) sauteed mushrooms with the onions and peppers.  Will definitely be making again.

Great recipe.  I would like to suggest to those who find eating bell peppers "uncomfortable" to use snow peas instead.  Their flavor works as well and even better for some folks.

Don't wait! Make this dish!  The "sauce" is just delicious!  And so versatile you can use it for the base for additional chicken, pork or beef dishes.  I recommend doubling the sauce portions ... but otherwise the ingredients are just right.  I did do as others have suggested and added some cornstarch to a bit of water and poured it in last minute before serving to thicken the sauce. And, because I had a guest who did not care for green peppers, I made two skillets from the same batch by cooking my meat and sauce separate from the veggies.  I then added onion and green peppers to the one skillet and onion and broccoli to the other.  To my surprise, my entire family, including myself, enjoyed the broccoli version better.  Better than chinese carry out!!! So while I won't be fixing this as a "pepper steak" dish any more, but a "beef and broccoli" dish, I so thank the submitter for an awesome sauce I intend to keep for all time!  :O)

Fantastic! I would especially recommend this recipe for venison. This recipe takes all the "gamey" out of the meat.  I did do the recommended adjustments (dash of red pepper flakes, and 2 tbsp of corn startch). I also reduced the honey amount to 2 tbsp. I made this for our deer hunting camp and all of the men LOVED it.

Very easy, simple, and tasty.  It was a little salty and there was just too much sauce.  Maybe that's because I only used a pound of steak and full amount of other ingredients.  I also added corn starch to thicken the sauce up, lots of black pepper for a little extra heat, sliced the onion instead of chopping them up, and fresh broccoli florets for extra vegetables.  Thanks for the quick, simple, and delicious dinner idea!

So impressed! It took no time to make and was absolutely delicious! The butcher at my local supermarket cut the flank steak into strips for me, which substantially decreased the prep time. I omitted the onions,(personal preference)used yellow, red, & green bell peppers, minced garlic instead of garlic cloves, and doubled the sauce to ensure there was enough to cover the rice. I used inexpensive boil-in-bag 10 minute Thai rice that was the perfect compliment. My only regret is not making more to have leftovers for lunch.

Stunning steak recipe.  Very tasty!  I never thought soy sauce, honey and red wine vinegar would make such a great combination!!  I followed the instructions as suggested by Maria and it turned out perfect!  If you want to make it spicy, as I like it, adding yellow banana peppers might do the trick but this recipe is fine as it is!  I ate this wonderful dish with the 'deluxe mashed potatoes' recipe along with 'honey ginger carrots' and it turned to be a great meal.  Of course, adding a bottle of Perez Cruz Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile made the meal even more delicious!  Cudos to Maria for submitted this recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!   Bought an inexpensive flat steak and marinated it for several hours in the garlic, vinegar, honey and soy sauce.  Cooked the veggies first as recommended by others, then cooked the beef in the marinade.  Combined all at the last minute.  Served with the cilantro rice recipe from Chipotle and my whole family loved it.  Will be making again and again!

My review is quite different in that I do not want to change the sauce or ingredients. My suggestion is this. Slice your meat in advance, sprinkle with 1/4-1/2 tsp of bicarb, 1 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp water. mix very well cover and refrigerate. Then continue as the recipe suggests. Awesome!!! Just like best fillet steak.

Fantastic idea.  My prep notes:  
1.  Flank steak is so expensive that it is totally out of range in my house. Other cuts work very well, and don't get tough when boiled in the sauce. 
2.  Steak itself doesn't need to be boiled for 15 minutes; it will cook in 1-2 minutes if thinly sliced, and then stir-fried.
Great taste, great sauce, great presentation.  Looks great on platter with some rice and any kind of stir-fried veggies!  (Try adding some dried lily buds and some shiitake mushrooms along with the red bell peppers!!  Ymmm!!)

Maria great recipe. I used a lodon briol steak and I dont think that was a good choic the meat came out so tough so anyone reading this dont do it...lol. I wasnt thrilled by it but it everyone else seem to enjoy it fairly well. I thought that pepper steak was suppose to have a spicy flavor to it and this did not even though while doing the bell peppers and onions I added chilli pepper and for some odd reason saw paprika and thought yeah throw some of that in there too. I will make this again because it is a good base recipe to tweak.  Thank you again Maria not bad at all.

Wow! Didn't think pepper steak coud be this easy.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I doubled the sauce ingredients, however, I didn't have red wine vinegar. I used 1/4 c. white wine vinegar and 1/3 c. red cooking wine instead.  I used the same oiled pan  that the onions and peppers were sauteed on to cook the meat and sauce in. I forgot to add the garlic by mistake, so I added it to the sauce mixture. I didn't have flank steak, but used (sliced into strips) london broil and let the sauce boil with it, then simmer for 45 minutes in low-med heat. (I had plenty of time before hubby got home).  Hubby loved it! My 4 year old devoured it!   THANKS FOR SHARING!

This was wonderful. The best pepper steak I've found yet. The only thing I did was bump up the garlic and used regular vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar. It turned out great.
Thanks for the recipe!!!!

My boyfriend loved this, its a man's meal! I doubled and thickened the sauce as recommended and eventually added even more soy sauce and honey as I thought the vinegar was too strong.  Served with sticky sushi rice and he was wowed!

Excellent!  

I made the following substitutions because I am an indigent college student:  Used red apple cider vinegar.  Also added frozen mixed veggies (on sale) for extra nutrition.  

It was delicious!  Leftovers tasted even better the next day after microwaving.  Made this with chinese chicken fried rice recipe from allrecipes.com  

I like salty so i would add more soy sauce next time and I thought the honey was too sweet so I would cut that down by 25%.  I guess I am used to the pepper steak from the chinese restaurant and wanted to emulate that one.  Terrific recipe.  

Note:  Just stir fry the steak until it is brown outside rather than a full 10-15 minutes unless you like super-well-done steak.  I like medium well so that is why I didnt leave it frying that long.  It was about 5 minutes and then I added the onions/pepper/garlic.  Remember that the steak sits in the wok for a long time [10-15 minutes] more as the veggies cook so use common sense.  

Also I am cooking with a real chinese wok that heats up quick and also on a gas stove so maybe that is why my cooking times are shorter.  

Thanks Maria!  This recipe is a real winner!!

Easy and delicious. My husband loved this. Thanks to other reviewers for their great suggestions:
1. After you remove the veggies from the pan, brown the meat. Remove from pan, then cook sauce, then add veggies and meat. 
2. Add 1/2 tsp. ginger and a dash of red pepper to sauce. 
3. Make a slurry of 1 T. corn starch and 3 T. water and add to sauce. 
With all those changes, this is a really nice supper. For a pretty presentation use red and yellow peppers.

this was really good and my husband loved it, loved the hint of honey on the meat. The meat was a little tough though, next time I will make this on the crock pot. Thanks for sharing!

I changed this up a bit With Watkins Grapeseed Oil. It is flavored with Garlic and Parsley so it made this dish "pop".

Very good recipe, and so simple to throw together, the only difference I made was to add thinly sliced mushrooms, and baby carrots.

Yummy--me, my husband, and 2 year old all loved it!  So easy, important to really slice the meat thinly.  Also did as others suggested----cooked veggies first, set aside, then meat, set aside, then sauce including 1T cornstarch mixed with some water and added everything back to pan to heat and coat.

My family loved this. Every last bit of it was gone in 10 minutes flat. I served it with white rice though no one in our house likes it much, and they were fighting over THAT in an effort to soak up all the sauce! Next time I'll definitely increase the sauce ingredients to 1/2 c. each. One of my boys doesn't like what he calls "sweet" meat at all, but even he devoured it.
I used 1 green and 1 red pepper and 3 cloves garlic. I cooked the meat seperate from the sauce. Next time I'll just use stir-fry meat, I think. I also used cornstarch to thicken up my sauce. Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

I used sirloin steak, rather than flank, and added a little broccoli, some mushrooms, a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, and used red & orange bell peppers, so it was very colorful.  I did not cook the meat for as long as recipe said; I think it would have turned out tough if I had. I only cooked it until it was browned in the sauce, then added veggies; maybe cooked for a total of 5-10 more minutes after adding veggies to meat.  Sprinkled some toasted sesame seeds on top & served over rice. It was pretty good.  Sauce tastes like teriyaki.
I also added 2tsp cornstarch, at the end, in an effort to thicken up the sauce, but I should have done what another reviewer recommended (Latinacook), and used 1T cornstarch and mixed it with a bit of water before adding.  2tsp did not thicken it up!
Oh yeah, I used low-sodium soy sauce too!

Gives the beef a really good flavor. People who found the sauce too thin probably did not cook it on high enough heat. Cooked on medium to medium high with lid off reduces the sauce to thick and flavorful

This recipe was easy to prepare and very tasty. Followed it exactly and had plenty of sauce for serving over rice.  My husband and son enjoyed very much and asked for seconds! This will definately replace my old pepper steak recipe.  Thanks!

Thank you for the recipe.  It was a little sweet for my taste but my husband liked it.  It was good just a bit too sweet.  Maybe less honey next time.  I gave 4 stars because of the sweetness and the color.  It was very black in color.  I dont think I can serve this to guests.  Overall good though.

Ooh - yummy yum yum yum. This dish was REALLY good. It's perfect for an easy weekday dinner, or for unexpected guests. I used red/yellow peppers (I think they taste better), but decreased the time that the meat cooked. I also used part red wine vinegar/part balsamic, as I am a HUGE balsamic fan. Finally, I also used the red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch. All told, a fabulous dinner that even my (self admitted) pepper disliking husband enjoyed.

I made this recipe using pork tenderloin instead of the beef, as specified.  It is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  My husband & I both just ADORED it & it is going to be a new regular on our dinner table.  The sauce is what really "makes" it -- zingy, tangy, slightly sweet without being overpowering -- truly amazing! My husband likened it to "poprocks" in a peppery sort of way.  Thank you for sharing this with us, Maria!

P.S.  I added a few red pepper flakes in with ours, so that may be a part of the greatness, too :)

This was very good, and I will be making this time and time again.  I used 1/2 chicken strips, 1/2 steak strips.  I KNOW it must be fantastic with the peppers (I LOVE peppers, hubby hates them), but I substituted baby carrots and corn.  I sauted the carrots with the garlic and onion.  And mixed the corn in at the end, with 2 cups of cooked white rice.

Very delicious!  Try it out!

YUM!  I had left over steak I wanted to use up and didn't expect to enjoy this recipe as much as I did.  I used apple-cider vinegar, because I didn't have any red wine vinegar and it was just perfect.  I waited to add the peppers 'til just before serving so they'd be firm - PERFECT!  I'll make this again very soon.

My boys loved this! My 9-year-old son said it was the best thing he's ever had. I did use round steaks because that is what I usually use for pepper steak and marinated the beef for about an hour, stir-fried the veggies separately, then drained and stir-fried the beef in two batches, simmered in the sauce for about 30 minutes, thickened the sauce with cornstarch/water and added the veggies back.

I am giving this a 3 star because even tho it taste good its sauce was to strong with something that made my and my daughters tongue and mouths raw.I have made the recipe"Easy Pepper Steak" on this site and it was 5 star. The meat was tender because I did as one lady suggested and stir fried the veggies and then meat and set aside,made the sauce and then mixed together and let cook a few minutes. I thickened with corn starch and a little beef broth mixture and added a tad of grated fresh ginger. I served with Veggie Fried Rice which I made mild due to the strongness of the pepper steak and we got takeout egg rolls because I didn't feel like making my homemade.Thanks for sharing and I am sure this would be a 5 star for many people. It does have a good flavor.

Made recipe as written, except I cut the red wine vinegar back by half (after reading a bunch of reviews), plus I added 2 tsp. grated fresh ginger into the sauce ingredients. Very good!! I also followed reviewers' advice to first brown the meat, then remove, saute the veggies, then remove, add the sauce ingredients and bring to slow boil for a few minutes, and then re-add the meat and veggies. Next time, I think I will add a 8 oz. can of water chestnuts, and sprinkle some thinly-sliced scallions over the top right before serving.

This was great. I read most of the reviews and made a few changes based on them. We loved it. I added ground ginger, red pepper flakes, and some corstarch at the end when we added the veggies back to the dish. I sauteed the veggies in olive oil first until they were crisp so they wouldnt be over cooked. I then removed them and kept them warm in another dish. I then fryed the meat strips on olive oil until they were done and ONLY then added the juices such as soy sauce, honey, etc. to the meat. Once I added the juices I added the sautted veggies and some cornstarch back to the mixture and cooked it for about 5 or 10 mts until everything was hot. I served it over white rice and it was delicious. Definitly a keeper and easy to make.

Really good pepper steak and the sauce was quite tasty served with rice.  I added a frozen oriental vegetable mix that I had preboiled a bit before adding.

Wonderful pepper steak...I had a recipe for pepper steak before this one but it had no flavor in my opinion.  This recipe has alot of flavor.  It tastes like something you would get at a Chinese carry out.  I did not have flank steak so I used sirloin instead.

My daughter I make this recipe often.  We love it and it is very simple to make.  We usually add flour/corn starch to the gravy to thicken it up a bit toward the end of cooking.  We usually have to double the recipe because we love the leftovers too!

Made it a 5* rating by putting 1/2 the suggested honey and adding a mixture of cornstarch and water to make a gravy in the last minute of cooking.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Turned out excellent!

I made this with KC strip steak just because I had it on hand.  I made no other changes.  It was better than I've gotten at any restaurant.  This recipe is on my list of favorites!  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!!!

Not bad.  My husband liked  it, although I didn't care for it al too much.  I think I'm not too crazy about flank steak.

This is a great recipe that eveyone in my family loves.  It is so easy to make and you can make it to the consistancy that you like by adding a little cornstarch.  Highly recommended.

This recipe had a great flavor to it.  However, it was on the soupy side and I forgot to follow other reviewers' suggestions of adding cornstarch to the sauce.  I also didn't care for the way in which the meat was prepared.  It would be a great recipe with some tweaking.

This is excellent!  I love the taste of the sauce.  I made it with 1/2 cup of everything (instead of 1/3) the last time for even more sauce.  Served on rice.  Just to show how much we love this recipe, we like variety in our meals and seldom make the same thing twice within a month.  But we have made this three times in the last two weeks!

Easy, which is key for me with a 3.5 yr old and 1.5 yr old around.  I didn't have to double the sauce, either.  I marinated the flank steak for about an hour before cooking and threw in some sesame seeds at the end, as well as 1 T cornstarch in 2T water.  Served it Uncle Ben's long grain wild rice.  Really good.  I also followed the recommendation of another review about cooking time - I just browned the meat before adding the veggies and then cooked just 10 minutes more.  Perfect.  Both my husband and I thought it was delicious though the kids wouldn't even try it.

This was very good with a couple additions, I marinated meat in stir fry sauce and minced garlic for about 30 min., added water chestnuts when the meat went in the skillet and sauted mushrooms with the onions and peppers. I thought the sauce was exactly right. Did need to be thickened at the end w/ 1T. cornstarch and 2T. water like some others suggested.

flavor was a little bland. Sauce was a little on the thin side. I cooked the steak only half the time and it was chewy.  Could be good if some of the other suggestions were followed

We loved this!  Followed the recipe exactly as stated, using 1 red and 1 green pepper.  I didn't thicken the liquid, and we didn't mind, even though it was thin.  I will definitely make this again!  Added note:  I have made this twice since the original review, using chicken tenders instead of the beef.  I have also increased the liquid and vegetables.  Just be cautious of the cooking time of the chicken tenders; they don't seem to take as long as the beef.  We really like it this way, also!

This recipe is great but it needs modification. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the soy sauce, but left the red wine vinegar and honey the same...it was still too sweet. It also needed more zing, so I'll be adding red pepper flakes next time. Next time, I will double the soy sauce, keep the red wine vinegar amount and reduce the honey in half...and add the red pepper flakes as I just said. All in all, a nice recipe!

I needed a quick recipe using the few ingredients I had on hand and printed this off as I ran out the door after work and what a GREAT choice this was!  It was absolutely delicious and very easy.  I used slightly less honey than it called for (I ran out) but the sauce was delicious!  I used one red and one green pepper just for color and did add 2 teaspoons of cornstarch which did give the sauce a little more body.  Served over rice this was a HIT.  I will absolutely make this again.

This recipe was absolutely excellent! The only adjustments I made were to add 1/2 tsp of both red pepper and 5-spice powder to add a little spice, and to add a touch of corn startch at the very end to thicken the juices a bit. I served this over egg noodles and it was a huge hit with the entire family. We'll definitely be making this again, as it took very little time to prepare as well.

This was very delicious. I used some of the suggestions and added a little ginger and cornstarch, and I reduced the amount of honey and vinegar. I just added a little honey at a time until it tasted right. I served it with a basmati rice pilaf. Thank you for this recipe! I will be making this again and again.

I made this today for New Year’s Day dinner, and it was very good.  I thinly sliced a skirt steak that I marinated in the honey, wine vinegar, and soy sauce for about 2 hours before stir-frying the meat (and marinate).  I used mostly corn syrup (as I was basically out of honey), and the dish still seemed a bit too sweet.  Next time I would reduce the honey by about 1/3 and add some crushed red pepper flakes for some zing.  DELICIOUS.

MY STARS!!  I was amazed at how wonderful this was.  I was scared of the vinegar, but that was what made it.  It was tangy & sweet & marvelous.  My husband said he would definately eat this again.  I doubled the sauce because that's the best part & you want it to be a gravy for your rice or noodles.

I tried this recipe and it was amazing! The whole family loved it! My boyfriend said it was one of the best meals that he had tried! And the best part was that it was so simple to make! Absolutely delicious! The only thing that I did differently was the cooking time of the meat. I cooked it in a big pot with the lid on, over a medium to low flame for about 40 mins to get the meat to soften and absorb the sauce and veggies. With a little rice on the side, pair it together and it's amazing! Thank you for the recipe! Will deff try again!

Really good recipe - I tried it for the first time tonight, and had to kind of improvise a bit on the sauce, since it was a bit too 'vinegary' for me, but overall a great find! 

I added lots of pepper, and halved the wine vinegar suggested. Since I didn't have any honey (woops!), I threw a bit of brown sugar in there. Had some great flavor profiles, though!

This was the best! This will go in the family recipe book! Everyone loved it, including my picky 8yr old. I didn't like the idea of the meat being boiled in the sauce. I would suggest sautéing the vegetables, set them to the side, add 2-3 tablespoons olive oil, when hot add the sliced meat and fry the meat in batches 1-2 min on each side, med-high heat. When all the meat is done frying, (pour any leftover oil in an ovenproof dish, when cool discard) make the sauce in same pan and deglaze pan, bring to a simmer and add vegetables and meat, serve over rice. YUMMY!!!!

Wonderful recipe.  Made it for the family and the kids loved it.  Will be a new addition to the regular rotation.  Try it with the "Egg Drop Soup (Better than restaurant quality)"...complete Asian meal!

Quick and easy. I added asparagus as well. The other reviewer was right that the steak should be cooked separately. Next time I will marinade the beef.

I'm giving it three stars. I agree with another reviewer that the steak gets tough because you're boiling it. I would suggest adding the steak to the veggies first, and then add the liquids immediately after. Thin steak takes 2 minutes to cook! That's it.

I also am giving it 3 stars only because the sauce was really tart. I had to add a tbl spoon of white sugar and a tbl spoon of brown sugar just to balance things out.

Next time, I'll skip the vinegar altogether. Soy sauce has enough of the briny flavor that vinegar isn't needed, at least not in that quantity. Then I'd add the brown sugar only (not white next time) to the recipe, and a tiny bit of Chinese chili pepper sauce.

This was truly the most easy to make and most delicious recipe I've used! I did only use 2 tablespoons of the honey and red wine vinegar added a bit of pepper flakes for a little kick and added corn starch to thicken the sauce. Served it over brown rice and garnished it with sesame seeds and it was totally delicious! My 14 year old would not stop raving about how good dinner was and she can be quite the food critic! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I made this dish last night and I have to say that it was it was a little too tangy/ sweet. I will definitely cut down on the red wine vinegar and honey next time I make it. Other than that, I think it's a good recipe.

This is excellent, and a 5 star recipe after a couple of tweaks. The sauce is just the right balance of sweet and sour, but I thought it was missing something. I grated some fresh ginger into the sauce and it was perfect. I also agree with the reviewer that mentioned cooking the steak by itself in a little oil after the vegetables are removed from the pan and then setting the steak aside, instead of cooking it in the sauce. Add the sauce to the pan/wok after pouring out any fat and boil gently until thickened and then toss the meat and peppers back in and stir to coat. Very easy to throw this together and can be done quickly since no marinating is required.

A good basic recipe that can be jazzed up to taste.  I was out of rice wine vinegar and used apple cider vinegar instead. The smell with the three ingredients for the sauce was not appetizing, and I have a feeling the same would have been true no matter what vinegar was used.  I added some extra garlic, onion, salt, pepper, and ginger to the sauce, which also needed corn starch to make a nice sauce instead of being so watery.  I thought it was okay, my husband really enjoyed it and went back for more right before bed.  I only gave three starts because it is an easy base using ingredients already on hand.

As written the recipe gets three stars.  To improve it the tweaks many other reviewers noted are necessary.  If you cook the meat in sauce you are boiling it, and it becomes tough.  Better to brown the meat, then add the sauce with the vegetables until heated through (I think 8 minutes is too long).  Also the sauce was watery; next time I'd either reduce it by cooking the sauce alone on high for few minutes, or add a bit of corn starch.  All that said, the combination of flavors was good.

This was pretty good. It was very easy to make and easy clean-up to. It would make a good week-night meal. I didn't have flank steak, so I just used round steak sliced very thin. And, I was a tad short on the honey, so I added about a teaspoon of sugar to cut through some of the vinegar. I served with rice and some asian string beans on the side.

This is the pepper with the most authentic Chinese flavor; it's super easy to make and the sauce is to die for!  If you want more sauce (and you probably will) just add corn starch (not flour!) mixed with some of the gravy with some beef broth, combine well and pour into the steak and pepper mixture.  Smooth and flawless!  Can't thank you enough for posting this recipe; I'll be making it quite often!

This tasted like chinese take-out.  I did follow the tips given by others-I thickened the sauce with a flour and milk mixture.  I also added bamboo shoots and water chestnuts.  The meat was very tender-I removed the veggies, like suggested, and I cooked the meat on medium with all the liquid ingredients til almost done then added the veggies til the meat was completely done.

You might consider not putting the garlic in with the onion and green pepper, til near the end of cooking these vegetables.  Garlic burns easily and you want it to flavor the oil.  Also, adding flour or corn startch to the vegetables so it cooks a little might help with the thinkening when the vegetables are added to the meat mixture.

This recipe is wonderful. I used tri-tip steak instead of flank and it worked wonderful. I also added some cornstarch to sauce and wisked it all together to smoothen out the honey before adding to the pan. I served the dish over white rice and my wife can't wait to have it again. Thanks very much for sharing I love this one.

Very good, but I found the red wine vinegar taste a bit over powering.  Next time I will cut it back to 1/4 c. and add some oyster or black bean sauce to make up the difference.  I added a heaping tbsp. of cornstarch to the sauce and then stir fried all my veggies and meat, then made a well in the middle and poured the sauce into the middle, letting it come to a boil and thicken.  Then mixed the sauce in and served over brown basmati rice.  I also stir fried broccoli, celery, carrots, zuchinni and 1 tbsp. minced ginger.  You could add any veggies you have on hand for a great, full balanced meal.

This was great, I however marinated my flant steak in a mixture of asian teriyaki sauce/garlic and red wine vinegar for 4 hours and sauteed it. The meat turned out very moist and very flavorful. Great recipe though. Thank you!

This is an awesome recipe! The only change I made was to cut down on the honey by about 1/3 because I was afraid it would be too sweet. It had a great tangy flavor! My four year old had three helpings!!! I think this sauce would also be great for the "tofu and green beans" dish my sister and I always got at the Chinese take-out place in the Pittsburgh Airport. Easy and delicious! Thanks!!

This recipe has become a staple in our house....with the exception of a few changes. I added fresh, sliced roma tomatoes after the onions and bell pepper cooked for about 6 minutes. I also cooked the veges in a 3/4 cup of chicken stock. Be sure to add the cornstarch at the end,since the addition of the chicken stock makes the gravy more soupy.

I made the recipe with all the listed ingredients, but I cooked the steak by itself to try to get a sear on it before adding it and the veg to the sauce. I didn't have bell peppers, so I used a couple of big cubanelles instead, and I added some chopped ginger to the sauce. We liked it OK, but it wasn't a 'wow'. I was originally doubtful about the sauce, but I made sure to cook it several minutes to reduce it and drive off the vinegar bite before I added everything back. That made a huge difference, turning it from a real eye-popping nose-tingling experience to a more ordinary sweet and sour. It was pleasant. I need to work on my searing technique with the beef, it ended up boiling a little in its own juices despite my best efforts. We will probably do this again.

My family really enjoyed this. I did add some black pepper to season the meat and marinated it in the sauce for about 45 minutes before cooking it. I served it with rice and cucumber salad and it was a quick and easy dinner.

We loved this recipe and it was sooo easy to make!!  Didn't have red wine vinegar, but used rice wine vinegar and added a touch of red wine.

I thought this recipe was excellent.   Next time I might try to add some zing to it since I like things a little spicy.   Good flavored gravy.

Great recipe! My boyfriend and I loved it! I reduced the honey to 1/4 cup, as advised by other reviewers, added 1tbsp corn starch and 1 tsp crushed red pepper did the trick! :) Will definitely be making this over and over again!

I used chicken instead of beef and substituted balsamic vinegar and a dash of white cooking wine for the red wine vinegar (didn't have any) and I thought this came out great!  I also added some black pepper and crushed red pepper near the end of the cooking time for a little kick.  I ate it over Ramen noodles and it was very tasty.  Easy and quick too.  I will make this again.

This recipe did not work for my family. Luckily I put the sauce on the side and let the family try it before serving.  No one liked it.  I ended up making a huge salad and topping it with the steak and stir fried peppers. Served with ranch dressing. It was great. Just not this recipe. Thanks anyway.

This is good! It's more sweet and sour steak than pepper steak though. I haven't tried yet, but ought to be a good sauce for pork or chicken as well.

Good recipe. Very simple. I altered it by using sugar instead of honey. I didn't have red wine vinegar but just combined wine and vinegar. It was taty with jasmine rice.

I made this for the first time today and I have to say it was outstanding!  The flavor was right on.  The only thing I did change was that I added a little cornstarch to thicken my sauce just a bit, but other than that it was awesome!  Everyone loved it.  This is a keeper for sure!  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

This was a quick, simple and great tasting recipe.  I cut up the veggies & meat the night before so that all I would have to do is throw it in the pan when I got home the next day.  I followed the recipe except exactly as it is except for combining 1 Tbsp of corn starch with 1 Tbsp water and adding it to the sauce to thicken it.  Also added fresh mushrooms.  I didn't think the sauce had to much honey or vinegar but I love a real sweet & sour sauce.  The only thing I would maybe do different is double the sauce next time.  Doubling it will probably make to much sauce but we like extra sauce for the rice to soak up.

I should not have made this recipe.  I don't like sweet meat recipes but I thought this might be good. We cut down on the honey significantly but it was still over the top.  One of my kids liked it. 
Will not make again.

Very nice, very nice. Also works well with Rice Wine vinegar(the wife can't stand red wine). since I can never find flank steak for any reasonable ammount, I tried making it with thinly sliced tri-tip instead, and it works. Even my stepson, who despises both peppers and onions, ate this up. I think it was the honey ;)

Definatly something I'll be making again. Very easy, very tasty, and pretty simple on ingredients. A solid four stars.

My husband hates pepper steak but I love it.  So I made this for myself and I love it. I do chop the peppers into chunks mix it together and pour over fried rice.   Take leftovers to work for lunch and reheat. I love it.  Thanks for the post.

5 Star recipe and very forgiving! I really wanted to try this recipe, but only had beef for stew and another small steak (random cut, I don't even know) on hand so I just used that (I know, ghetto, right!?! :)) But it was still good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used an extra clove or two of garlic. I also added about 2 or 3 teaspoons of cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up. The only thing I think I did wrong was I let the sauce simmer on too high a temperature for too long, because my peppers got soggy. I know a lot of people don't eat the peppers, but personally I eat the peppers and like a little bit of bite to them. So just watch out for that. I served this with House Fried Rice by Lynda (this site) and it was wonderful. It's even good reheated. Thanks for sharing this one!

I halved the recipe, didn't have red wine vinegar so i used a little bit of white wine vinegar instead. I also added some cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce up. It was very good and authentic. 
TIP: Dilute the cornstarch in warm water first and then add to the sauce/meat. I used ~ 1 Tablespoon. Stir it up and you'll see it thicken up  almost immediately.

Pretty easy and it tastes well but it didn’t have that “wow factor”.  I took the advise of other reviewers and cut back on honey and red vinegar - it was a really good advice.

The recipe was right, easy to do with ingredients you have on hand and adjustable! I added a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper, 1/2 t ginger powder, and about 2 t of dried parsley. Per other reviews, I used 1/2 the amount of honey and vinegar. Turned out great--my first time cooking beef, so I probably overcooked.

This was pretty good.  I added mushrooms and doubled the sauce.  Be sure to add your meat at the last minute or it will get tough.

The flavor on this was excellent.  The meat was a touch overcooked.  I'd use the minimum times or shorten them a little more.  Will be making this again.

Added water chesnuts and some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was good but was too sweet for my taste. Very easy though and worth trying for a quick mid-week meal.

My family really enjoyed this one.  I ended up using a wok instead of just a frying pan.  I may thicken the sauce a bit the next time.  But it was fine as is.

Was this ever good! I read the recipe wrong and did ¾ cup of the vinegar, honey, and soy sauce…thought that seemed like a lot! But it worked out good because we had plenty of sauce, which I added corn starch to thicken. We love bell peppers, so I used those, added mushrooms, and served it with mashed potatoes instead of rice. I bought the beef already cut so that saved on time, but this was a really easy and quick meal to make. We all sat at the table and couldn’t stop eating! My kids have already asked for it again! Thanks MARIACOZ…it was fantastic!

I'm a vegetarian but my husband eats meat, and this is the first time I've ever attempted to make a meat dish for him.  I got a new wok for Christmas and decided to try to make his favorite "pepper steak" which he always orders at Chinese restaurants.  He said this was pretty good but a little too "soy saucey."  The flavors sound good to me and I may try this sauce with just some veggies and rice.  Thanks for the recipe, it seems like a great starting point for some yummy dishes.

Hi folks. I replaced the red wine vinegar with rice wine vinegar and I used a low sodium soy sauce. I also reduce the honey to a couple tablespoons and added 1 teaspoon of Trader Joe's roasted sesame oil to the sauce. I also added a cornstarch slurry at the end to thicken it up. Lastly before I started cooking I added a little soy sodium sauce and a dash of sesame oil with the raw meat. I probably should just post this as another recipe!

My family were not fans. It felt like it was missing something. I plan on trying again with my own spin...maybe chili flakes..something to boost the flavor profile.

I love this dinner! I make it all the time but in the slow cooker! I add everything but the peppers and cook in low for 5-6 hours. Then add the peppers until the preferred texture.

This recipe is so good. It has become a stable in my house. I used it for chicken as well and add vegetables. My family loves it.  The key for the steak being tender, is letting it cook longer.

Awesome recipe, and I liked the cut they recommended.  Only things we decided to tweak was to put in less honey - it was a little too sweet with 1/3 cup, so we did about half that the second time and it was perfect, and to add flour to the sauce to make it a little thicker, after everything was done cooking.  We found it stuck to the rice a little better.

I made this last night, and my husband said its the best thing I have EVER made in our life. He said I should start a food cart and just serve this. He said that if we weren't married already, this would be the recipe to solidify that position.  So clearly a winner!

I followed the exact recipe but I used one red bell pepper and I large jalapeño pepper to add some spice. It was very flavorful and delicious. Got lots of compliments on this dinner recipe. Easy and quick to make too.

I thought this was great! I doubled the sauce and followed the advice of another reviewer and marinated the steak for 30 minutes in soy sauce, garlic, and a little bit of baking soda. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so just used red cooking wine. I also added a little sugar because I didn't have enough honey. All very good and will make again.

This was the best peppered steak I have ever made. I did not have any red wine vinegar so I used Sherry cooking wine. I did add an extra onion because we love them. I also doubled the sauce! We had NO left overs and it is only 3 of us! YUM!! I will definitely make this again. Thank you Maria for sharing this recipe!!

I really liked this recipe, will make again, but might cook the steak separately from sauce to see how it turns out.

This recipe was really surprising (much better than i thought it would be).  I've made it twice, once with just onions and garlic, then tossing some baby spinach and chopped celery (adds the crunch of water chestnut) in before serving.  The first time, broccoli and onions were also delicious.

I always add ground ginger, red pepper flakes, onion powder, ground pepper and about a tablespoon and a half of cornstarch. 

It takes about forty minutes and tastes like it takes longer.

this recipe is really good and yes it need some changes but overall you can get good flavor from this my boyfriend..It came out the BOMB.... Now you will need to cook the strips of steak in 3 tables spoon of EVO I put lid over the skillet and tossed the strips around w/ steak seasoning & some added garlic powder.. I did this for about 15 minutes they were good and brown. I then removed the meat let the water that came from the meet to reduce down some added little more EVO an then tossed in the onions & green peppers.. cooked this down some then took the veggies out.. I then poured in my sauce mixture.. Now with the sauce.. I suggest cutting back on the RWV , since I had 2lbs of meat.. I did need to increase the sauce .. but it came out very very good when I added the meat & veggies back into the sauce w/ 1/2 cup of water mixed with a teaspoon of corn starch for thickening .. I let it simmer for 40 minutes..the meat came out so tender...you can add mushrooms to the veggies too.. This same recipe can be done w/ chicken as well if you trying to cut back on red meat..

Great flavors and easy to make.  This recipe is super easy to follow.  I  cooked everything separately, vegetables, steak, and sauce then combined it all.  I made some fried rice as a side dish and my girls loved it!  I did add a little corn starch to thickened up the sauce and added red pepper flakes as suggested.  We love spicy foods!  Super delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

I cooked this tonight and it was delicious. I did add zucchini and squash with the bell peppers and it was yummy. The sauce is so simple, yet great, that I will definitely be trying it for Broccoli Beef. I actually got my picky kids to eat vegetables because they tasted like the sauce lol!

DELICIOUS with the following modifications: doubled amount of onions, halved amount of bell peppers, used 2 tsp sugar instead of honey, used half the amount of red wine vinegar, added 1 tsp corn starch to thicken sauce and added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce.

Fabulous - I used lower sodium soy sauce, and sirloin tip steak, partially frozen and sliced.  I thought this would be too much vinegar or too much soy, but it was just right!  I doubled the garlic and opted to add in a little corn starch and water to thicken the sauce.  Served over brown rice.  Really yummy and super easy!  Great sauce for a beef and broccoli dish, as others have mentioned!

Not bad! This made for a very quick (and tasty!) weeknight meal. While I prefer slow cooker pepper steak (also on this site) a tad better, this was also pretty good. There is just something to be said about slow cooking meat. It's always tender and literally melts in your mouth. Beef cooked on the stovetop just doesn't compare, IMHO. My meat was verging on tough, but my husband thinks this is because I overcooked it... Since I do not care for undercooked meat (I prefer my meat medium-well to well done), I guess I will never find out. :) As Rhiannon suggested, I too altered Maria's cooking method. She's right. Pepper steak is a stir-fry and should be treated as such. Stir-frying your meat will ensure that it remains succulent and tender (unless you cook it too long as I did). I started off stir-frying my veggies in EVOO and then set aside (as directed). I then stir-fried my cut up flank steak in the same pan (added a little more oil), removed it and added it to my veggie mixture. I whisked my sauce ingredients together, added to my skillet, cooked for 5 minutes and thickened it all up with a cornstarch slurry (2 t cornstarch / water worked well for me). Once my sauce was done, I tossed everything together to heat thru and viola - dinner served! Steamed rice and spring rolls rounded out our simple meal. Toasted sesame seeds were a nice touch. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Maria! :-)

Very nice!  My husband kept asking me if it was difficult to prepare...I guess that's because he wants it again?  Anyhow, I took others advice and prepared the peppers first, meat second, and then married with the sauce and added corn flour.  I will definitely prepare it again.  Thanks!  Oh, I may add some ginger and red pepper flakes the next time, that might add a nice boost.  Thanks!

This marinade was awesome. I used this to make a round steak for my boyfriend (1.38lbs-2). I used all of the ingredients in the recipe except red wine vinegar. I used rice vinegar instead.  I reduced the amount of soy sauce, honey, and vinegar to start off with (2 tablespoons each) and added as I went along until I achieved the desired taste using freshly grated ginger, crushed red pepper, & water.  I used a meat tenderizer on the steaks, slit them diagonally on both sides, and seasoned them as I would any other meat.  I let that sit while I sauteed the onions, pepper, & mushrooms in olive oil & then placed them in a bowl to the side. Then, I pan seared the steaks on medium high heat for 10 minutes, 5 on each side. I added the vegetables to the pan first, & then 1/3 of the sauce.  Over the course of simmering the steaks covered for 2 hours, I added the remaining sauce, & alternated 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch & water to thicken sauce & reduce the salt flavor.  My boyfriend LOVED this. This was my FIRST time cooking steak & thanks to Maria, it was a great success!

I love this recipe.  Made it twice in one week, once with chicken.  Did cut back on honey and vinegar as suggested.  Also added ginger.  This is definitely in my "love this" folder.

Delicious! I added a tbsp. of brown sugar because I didn't have enough honey. I also had about 2 lbs of steak so I did a 1/2 cup soy, 1/2 cup honey/brown sugar blend and 1/2 cup red wine vinegar...for such simple ingredients it was VERY flavorful!

I browned the peppers and onions and then browned the marinated steak strips before adding the rest of the marinade. I don't think it would be nearly as good if the meat was essentially boiled in the liquids. Brown everything first. Served it over rice but I think I might serve it over Lomein Noodles next time.

This was FANTASTIC!!! I had made enough for my husband and I to take to lunch the next day and at the end of supper the only thing left in the skillet was the juice.  Next time I have to make more.  Even my kids ate the peppers and onions.  :)

This was delicious. I used the same ingredients but I made the sauce at the end after the veggies and meat were stir-fried. The sauce is made with just 3 ingredients in equal amounts, you can make as much or as little sauce as you like...couldn't be easier to remember. I thickened the sauce with cornstarch to my taste. The recipe is a keeper. Thank you, Maria!

Ginger and red pepper flakes helps this recipe ingredibly! The only difference that i did was cook the steak in a slow cooker for 2-3 hours  adding some corn starch. Then when completely done and tender added the stir fry veggies. It was amazing!!!!

Tasted great! Loved the simple ingredients.  I chose to use chicken instead of steak and rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I also added some freshly grated ginger. My boyfriend LOVED it and commented on how good it was about three times.

We took the advice of others and cut the honey down and only used 2 Tbsp.  Also, used 2 T of water and 2 T of white balsamic vingar.....then I thickend the sauce with a little cornstarch and a little more water....had a really good taste, not too sweet or sour.

This was really good and simple meal. I was shocked I actually had the ingredients in my cabinet. My husband loves soy sauce too so it went over really well with him. I love the way the flavors blend. I will be adding this to my favorites.

Tried this for the first time...it was really good and the wife thought it was great.  I found it a touch to sweet. I think I will cut back on the honey a little next time.

This was delicious. My Hubby loved it. I thought it was a little too sweet. Next time I  might try a little less honey. I also followed the advice of another reviewer advice and cooked the veggies, then the meat and then added the veggies and sauce back into the pan with the meat. The meat was nice and tender. Good recipe, going into my permanent file

great meal, i used all the ingredients just adjusted the serving size. I cooked the meat separate with oil and set aside once done.Then I cook the veggies  in oil once done added the meat. I also added broccoli to the meat and veggies. I cooked the sauce in a separate pan, added corn starch than added the sauce to the meat and veggies. taste was great, sweet and tangy!!! really good, I have already added this to my recipe box :)

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I took tips from past reviews and floured the meat before cooking, which helped thicken the sauce, doubled the sauce amount and only used about 3 tbls rice wine vinegar. Loved the glazed texture of the sauce. Thanks for the simple and delicious recipe!

This turned out really good. I added some broccoli but otherwise made as written. I did end up adding some cornstarch mixed with water because the sauce was way to thing. If I make again (which I probably will), I will use about half the vinegar as it was a bit overpowering.

Toss the beef strips in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, and chinese red pepper before adding, and this recipe is perfect! I also added a little more milk.

Definitely delicious and definitely a make-again for me.  I used the exact proportions of the sauce ingredients, but only about 1 lb meat that I marinated overnight.  Also didn't use bell pepper although this is a pepper steak recipe - but if it is a "5" without pepper, it would certainly be a "5" with pepper.  I used sweet onion, mushrooms, and zucchini which just shows how versatile this recipe is for using whatever veggies you have.  The only suggestion I would make is that if you are going to serve this over rice, I think the sauce would benefit from a bit of thickening.

Mmmmm...good!  Made this mostly as written, but also added tofu, so I made a little extra sauce.  My husband couldn't get enough of it.  I took the advice of a few other people and stir fried all the ingredients separately and then made the sauce.  LOVED this over rice...hubby couldn't get enough of it.  I wasn't sure I would like it with the red wine vinegar, but the sauce had such a great flavor.  Will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation and can see swapping out meats and veggies depending on what's in the fridge.  Great, easy, versatile...thanks for sharing!

I followed the advice of another review and cooked the steak first, then removing the steak and cooking the peppers, then removing the peppers and making the sauce and then adding it all back in to the pan to cook together for about 5-10 minutes.  It was fantastic!!

I had to tweak it to make it a 5 star recipe.  I used a lot of garlic (5-6 cloves) and flank steak cut super thin, against the grain (makes it very easy to chew).  When I started to follow the directions I realized that the cooking times were way off, and the sauce was really thin.  I cooked the  meat just for a few minutes and then added corn starch blended with water to thicken the sauce.  I added back the vegs just to heat up...I don't like the vegs to be soggy.  I also added some red pepper flakes.  Over all it turned out great and my family really liked the taste of it.  I served it over steamed jasmine rice.

This recipe is the bomb!  Twice now my wife has made it.  The flavors melt in your mouth with almost sensuous pleasure!  Make a double batch of the sauce, it's much better that way.  Thanks Maria, you knocked this one out of the park.

This was pretty good and very simple.  The sauce seemed to be missing something, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  I agree with others that the steak simply cannot be made as stated in the recipe.  I put the flank steak in the freezer for about 3 hours, and then sliced it with a really good knife, really thin.  I sauteed the veggies (added pea pods), removed, and then seared meat in batches.  Then threw it all back in the pan and added sauce.  Was really good, but I felt like it was missing something.

I made this for dinner last night. Kids liked it, I liked it. DH liked too. Didnt have enough honey so had to substitute a little bit of sugar, so I dont know if that made a difference... But this will probably be kept on rotation although I may try the other pepper steak recipes on this site as well.

It was so yummy. I added red bell pepper to give color and they taste great with this dish. I also added a pinch of ground ginger for flavor and cut the honey to 1/4 cup like others said to. So good over rice!

As written, this recipe has a whopping 1,200 mg of sodium so I used a reduced sodium soy sauce and halved the amount or it, and added a little low sodium beef broth.  Still great and healthier.

I have to give this recipe a 4 since not only is it too sweet but its more what I expect from teriyaki rather than pepper steak.  I added 1/4 cup more soy sauce and 1/4 cup more red wine vinegar (along with 1 T. cornstarch) and it still was sweet.  It's good but not pepper steak.

I made this the other night for my husband and we absolutly LOVED it! I did everything the same as the recipe except I used the deer steak I had on hand and cooked it in the oven with beef broth and covered in foil for 2 hours. As some of you may know, deer meat is hard to get to taste good nd be tender, this method really helps and we cannot tell that it isn't beef! Thanks for the gret recipe! I will be making this a lot.

This came out pretty good. I cooked the beef first, then the veggies. After they were finished I set them aside and combined the ingredients for the sauce. I used rice vinegar instead of the red wine and reduced it to 1/4 cup. The sauce was too watery so I added corn starch and doubled everything so there was enough sauce. Its much easier to prepare the sauce separate for this reason. Once I got the desired taste I combined everything. My family loved it! I will use this again for sure.

I actually mixed the soy sauce, vinegar and honey and marinated the meat in it. After this I sauteed all the veggies and added the beef and sauce into the same pot and cooked everything together and it came out very yummy. Hubby loved it! I served it with rice. Thank you!

I planned on making this recipe and discovered I did not have any steak in the freezer  so I substituted 1 1/2 lbs.  large raw shrimp. I cooked the shrimp in the honey, soy sauce and red wine vinegar mixture until they were pink. Removed the shrimp from the pan and added them to the already cooked veggies. I then stirred in  a mixture of 1 tbls. corn starch and 1 Tbls. water into the honey, soy sauce and red wine vinegar mixture  into the brought it back to a quick boil,  then poured it over the shrimp and veggies.  Served over the cooked white rice. It was huge hit. My husband and I loved it. He said he thought the sauce was perfect match for the shrimp.

My husband and the 2-year-old triplets love this but I think it has a strange taste from the vinegar.  I used skirt steak and double the sauce and let it cook for an hour.  The meat is very tender this way.

I put this in the crockpot (probably my mistake?). Doubled the sauce, added 1 Cup beef broth and let it cook away for about 5 hrs on low. It began to smell like it was burning and sadly it did not taste great.

yes, yes, this was the BEST ever in the world!! My husband and I fought over who gets the leftovers.  We ended up spliting it and it wasn't enough! I will be making this over and over again! I followed the recipe to a tee and I didn't add or change anything... I put it over brown rice.

Really great flavor!  I make this one often.  I have found cooking the beef as the recipes says does make it rather tough.  As others suggested, it's better to brown it first then add it to the sauce.  Much more tender.  I've passed this recipe on the several others and it's always a hit.

This was a great recipe, but I did follow the suggestions of cooking veggies, meats, sauce seperately, then combining them at the end. My meat came out much better. I also decreased the amount of vinegar as others suggested, but not by too much. I think I might decrease it a little more next time. I liked this recipe alot and will make it again!

This was pretty good.  I used top sirloin steak and cut the recipe in half since I was only cooking for the 2 of us.  I used a combo of broc/red pepper (steamed the broc a bit first) and followed some other reviews by cooking the veggies, removing, cooking the beef and then adding sauce and veggies back (did thicken with cornstarch).  I also cut down on the vinegar and could use to cut down some more as I found it has an overpowering taste in the sauce.  Oh, also added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and served over whole wheat spaghetti.

I am not the best cook.  But OMG!!! This was absolutely indescribably delicious!! It was easy too.  My kids were wondering what that wonderful smell was coming from the kitchen.  They could not wait to get some.  It was definitely worth the wait.  I followed the recipe without any changes. Thanks!

I made this in a real hurry and it was great! Real fast and simple, I  did take the suggetions of others when making the sauce. I added ginger just to jazzy up a bit. Thanks for the recipe. I will make this again.

The taste was great; however, the technique needed some tweaking.  I followed the instructions for the veggies.  But, with the meat, I let it sit in 3/4 of the marinade before I grabbed it out and "stir-fried" it.  After, I tossed the veggies back in along with 1/4 reserved marinade and enjoyed it over rice.  Yum!

really good, easy dinner.  my husband and i loved it, but kids refused to eat it- only reason why it isn't getting 5 stars.  used crushed dry roasted peanuts over top instead of sesame seeds, and i think i would use a little less red wine vinegar next time.

Wonderful recipe! My wife and kids love it. The only change I made was I poured a 1/4 cup of the liquid from the pan into a bowl and mixed in one tablespoon of cornstarch then poured it back into the pan. This created a nice thick sauce.

This was sooo good!  I don't even like peppers but this recipe made them delicious.  And my husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven.  Super yummy!  I added some flour to thicken and ate it over white rice.

I followed advice below and stir-fried the meat separately, and I added a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies to make the recipe go farther. My husband raved over it! I love the sauce.

Delicious! The sauce was so good. I made the following adjustments:
1. Cook veggies first, remove from pan
2. Cook meat by itself, remove from pan
3. Increase the amount of suace by 50%
4. Add cornstarch to thicken sauce
5. Once sauce is thickened add back veggies and meat to heat through.
6. I also added red pepper flakes as someone else had suggested.

I served it over rice, but would be really good over clear noodles as well. Better than takeout!

Good basic dish.  I cut back on the soy sauce a bit (and used low-sodium) and used sirloin steak.  Served over brown rice with fresh pineapple on the side.

This was good,but tasted very rich to me and my family,probably the cut of meat used(flank).I marinated the meat for about 6 hrs in the soy mixture called for in the recipe; this made the meat pretty tender.I served it with rice and it made a good meal.

"Maria's Pepper Steak"  I LOVE YOU MARIA!!  I love this recipe!  The perfect balance between sweet and salt.  The consistency of flank steak is perfect for it.  I've made it several times and everybody always enjoy it.

This was pretty good.  I had a lot of beef to fry up so I doubled the recipe.  It made a lot of sauce which was nice because I served it over rice.  My husband thought it was a nice change for dinner.

If you just read my review, forget about the sugar comment! Got it mixed up with a different recipe! The rest of the comment was correct. Very tasty.Followed some other's suggestions such as:
 Used sesame oil  used frozen oriental veggies. 
 Also added a bit of corn starch  and water to thicken sauce.

Tasty.  My family really enjoyed this. I followed the recipe as is and could think of no changes that would improve it.

A bit too vinegary for my taste, but decent enough.

I was excited to make this after reading the other reviews.  However, it was too vinegary and I felt like it was missing something.  It did smell delicious when I was cooking it.

This was really good, I didn't have any honey so I used sugar, but less than recommended.  I also used expensive meat.  I will definitly make this again.  Thanks

This was pretty good.  I followed the ingredient list exactly, but only had half the amount of red wine vinegar so I substituted the rest rice vinegar.  I am not a big meat buyer and didn't realize how expensive flank steak was!  Yikes! If I made this again, I'd buy a round steak or something.  As other reviews suggested, I stir fried and veggies and meat first then set them aside while I made the sauce. Also, as suggested, I doubled the sauce ingredients.  When I first tasted the sauce I was horrified.  It tasted very vinegary-soy-y.  I put the meat and veggies (I added broccoli) in the sauce for a few minutes before serving and maybe the flavors blended nicely because when I served the dish over rice, the sauce was good.  Personally I prefer allrecipes Asian Beef with Snow Peas, but this was a solid 4 star recipe.

My husband and I had this for supper last night, and it was great.  The whole house smelled so yummy.  The only thing I changed, well really added, was I mixed 1/3 cup of soy sauce with 1/2 cup of water and 2 tsp. of corn starch mixed it together and put it into the steak and pepper mixture during the last 2 minutes of cook time to thicken up the sauce.

We've had this a few times now and it's always good.  I like to cook the meat by itself prior to adding the sauce and veggies.  1 TBSP cornstarch + 1 TBSP water helps to thicken the sauce nicely and since we like it spicy I also add 1 tsp. crushed red pepper.  Served over rice.

This was the absolute best pepper steak I have ever had!  I decided to use a round steak instead of the flank which tends to be a little fatty. 
Wonderful!!

This recipe was not that great.  I was really excited about it but it turned out way too sweet and vinegary.  I added much more pepper (jalepeno and crushed red) to spice it up.  Still it was just so, so.  We ate it but decided it was not to make again.

Excellent. As suggested by others, I stir-fried very thinly sliced top round (London Broil) steak. After dry rubbing it  with Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute. Round steak is
 often on sale. Stir fried vegetables next, then made the sauce. Added back the meat and vegs. thickened the sauce with cornstarch. As recommended by others, increased the amount of sauce. Great over rice. Sliced fresh mushrooms, cooked with the vegs. are a nice addition, and convenient to use are frozen pepper strips.

I was excited to try this recipe after reading the other reviews.  I made some of the changes some others recommended like cooking the meat separately and while the meat was well-cooked, the sauce did not taste good.  I cut back on the honey and added some red pepper flakes and it was still too sweet and seemed to be missing something.

This was wonderful. The only change I made was to use sirloin steak. Next time I will double the sauce because husband liked it so much. I did have to thicken the sauce just a little bit with cornstarch.

AWESOME, awesome, awesome! This is one of the best recipes ever! Everyone in my household LOVED it. There were no leftovers, my son even had thirds! Better than any pepper steak I have ever had at a restaurant... my hubby agreed. I did add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce when it was done. I used sirloin steak instead of flank. This will be a regular at our house now.

Absolutely delicious!  This is right up there on my list of top 10 recipes I have made from this site! I followed this recipe exactly as written with the exception of using sirloin steak instead of flank steak.  It turned out to be some of the best pepper steak I have ever had!  It's right up there with my favorite chinese restaurant's!  I served it over rice that I made with beef boullion, and I almost forgot, I also added a small can of mushrooms to the peppers and onions.  I will be making this one MANY MANY more times!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

I halved this recipe and cooked it up for my fiance and I last night, and it was a massive hit!  I added a few tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds 5 minutes before it was ready to serve to brighten it up a little, which was really effective.  We'll definitely be having this one again!

I liked this version of pepper steak.  I did double the soy sauce, but I reserved about 1/4 c. soysauce to add 2 tsp. cornstarch to thicken.  I had not had red wine vinegar or honey in a stir fry before & I was pleasantly surprised!

This dish was fabulous! I used the recipe exactly and my husband and I both thought it was absolutely delicious! The flavor was perfectly sweet/savory/acidic, and I have definitely added this to my family menu. Even my 4 yr old ate it! (p.s. I did add the cornstarch to thicken the sauce.)

This was an easy recipe. Used 1 green and 1 red pepper for presentation. Did not have red wine vinegar---subbed 1/2 rice and 1/2 cider instead. It was a little sweet for me. Will definitely make again using a little less honey. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't change much for this one- but I did make extra sauce which I personally think was too much. There's so much flavour that it didn't really need any more sauce, and it ended up being to much on my plate. I also added zuchini as well as some cornstarch to make it thicker. It was perfect over rice with a side of steamed veggies. :)

Good recipe to use as a base. I did find it a bit sweet. I will make again, but next time will use less honey and add some red pepper and maybe some black bean sauce.

I am not sure about the dish as a whole..but the sauce it made poured over rice was to die for.  I will probably use the recipe for the vegies and the sauce to make a  5 star great rice dish!

Very tasty. My kids weren't thrilled about it, but I thought it was good. We had homemade rolls with it and we found that putting the steak, onion, and pepper on a roll as a sandwich was terrific.

Pretty tasty stuff, I just thought it needed a little something more, but I will make again!  I did not cook as long as the recipe said, since I thought the steak would get tough and it came out fine.

This is an easy recipe that doesn't require a lot of planning. Definitely use a good cut of beef and I eased up on the sweetness and threw in a couple chilis. Added to the rotation!

Will make it again. The flank steak from our butcher was great.
Not the first time I cooked it, but the meat this time made it better.

I adapted this for the Instant Pot, as follows.

 I made 1.5x the sauce,  and used 1.5 lbs thin sliced london broil x 18 minutes high pressure, then 13 minutes natural pressure release.

Added 4 sliced bell peppers and cornstarch and thickened while cooking peppers. Served over white rice. This is 
really a delicious sauce, this one is going in the rotation.

Ingredient modifications, only because I was out of things: used sugar instead of honey. Used unseasoned rice vinegar and a good size splash of red wine to make up for being out of wine vinegar. Added 2 tablespoons of Sriacha for some kick too.

I used red,yellow, and orange bell peppers. Because I didn't have the green ones. But it was pretty good.

This was so easy to make and it taste great.  While mixing the ingredients I was unsure, since it just didn't sound right, and when it all came together it was like I ordered from the restaurant!

Excellent! We really enjoyed this. Took commenter E’s advice and marinated the steak with the soy sauce, garlic and a pinch of baking soda for 1/2 hour - worked like a charm! Thank you for this recipe, Maria. It is a keeper!

Both kids liked the sauce!  Rhiannon’s suggestion of sauté veggies 1st-remove.  Then meat-remove. Make sauce and add veggies and meat. Don’t forget thickening w flour or corn starch needs to be made with cold water before adding to sauce.  So good!  Thank you!

I don't know where I went wrong.  Followed ingredients as is.  I did cook my veggies and set aside, then my meat in small batches, cause I'm not great with these types of meats.  That all went great but then I put the sauce ingredients in the pan and added the cornstarch and as it cooked, batches of jelly looking patches popped up, not to mention the flavor was Super bold!  I had to dump it and make my own sauce to not ruin dinner.  Can anyone tell me why that happened?? How much cornstarch to water do you use?  Did I add too much?  My sauce was not thickening.

I used a partial red bell pepper and some mini sweet peppers instead of green bell peppers. Sirloin steak choice and purchased an order of vegetable fried rice to serve it over! I garnished the plates with a sprig of basil and sliced it up over the dish as we consumed it. I also placed small dots of siracha around the outside of the plate to allow a little spice if desired. Was amazing! I will see if I can post the picture!

Used some leftover steak. Everything else followed as stated. Overall, very good, just a tad bit too sweet for what I think pepper steak should be. Would definitely make this again, just cut down on the amount of honey.

This was pretty good and really fast. I also made the beef and vegetables separate and combined them with the sauce in the end. Also I used less Red wine vinegar and thickened the sauce with Wondra in the end. Not a very kid friendly dish.

i made it the first couple of times and served it over rice.  the family liked it a lot.  i appreciate that the recipe is simple and quick and most of the time, i have these ingredients on hand, even when i can't figure out what to cook.  this last time i made it, i cut the beef really really thin and made sandwiches -- yummy.  thanks.

I was skeptical because the sauce was so simple, but this was fantastic! Based on other reviews, I stir fried the beef in oil and garlic, and added some ginger. Then I added the peppers and onions and continued to stir fry. I finished by adding the sauce plus a couple of dashes of sriracha. I also thickened the sauce with some cornstarch.

Yum!!! A few minor tweeks from reading reviews .. Definitely cook the meat separately in oil and not in sauce. Set meat aside while cooking sauce. Add veggies. Add the meat last to warm and serve. I used sirloin and it was SO tender! I doubled the recipe for my big family and tripled the sauce. I used 1 c. Rice wine vinegar, 1 c. Low sodium soy sauce and only 2/3 c. Honey I also added some minced ginger and 1 t. beef bullion. Definite repeat!!!!!

This is a recipe for stir frying by someone who does not know how to stir fry. The beef should be stir fried after the veggies and then combined. Sauce was interesting but nothing resembling Chinese.

We had this for dinner last night! And there are some leftovers! It was good. I cooked it in a medium caldero and the meat came out tender. The sides were white rice, red beans, and fried plantains.

Oh my gosh, I made this tonight with just minor changes in the ingredients. Added pineapple and some juice, shrimp along with a piece of leftover steak and julienned carrots. I think my husband and I made a record on how fast we ate our dinner! Great recipe and thanks so much for sharing!!

I also used the soy/red wine vinegar/honey as a marinade for the steak while I was preparing and cooking the peppers. I know flank steak/London Broil can at times be tough so this may have helped. Not sure, but it came out really good either way.

Recipe as is listed on the website is a 3 star recipe. If you want it to be a 5 star recipe, follow my advice and do this:

Once you have cooked the meat in the juices, and the meat has tenderized, mix up some corn starch (about 1 TB) and flour (1/4 cup) in about 2 cups of cold water, and then pour it into the pan with the meat. This will form into a delicious gravy that you can then use to pour over the rice. I didn't measure the Corn Starch or Flour when I was cooking, so the above amounts are only guestimates, however, you can easily adjust things according to how thick you want your gravy to be.

I personally added a few Jalapeno's in with the rest of the peppers to spice things up a bit,

Really good flavor...to much liquid though and as already stated meat needs to be cooked out of sauce so it's not tough. I added crushed red pepper also to give extra heat.

I added sliced water chestnuts which I saw in a review. They added a nice cruchy element. I used pre-sliced round steak from my local grocery store. I seasoned the meat with soy, vinegar, pepper, ginger powder and garlic powder and let it sit while I prepared the peppers, onion , garlic and rice. The meat was flavorful and tender. I'll make this  again.

It was a little bit on the sweet side, but we loved it! I'd marinated the meat with soy sauce and oyster sauce (I didn't properly measure how much I used :P) for about 30 mins before I cooked. I also used 5 cloves of garlic because it's impossible to use too much garlic in food haha I'll be making this again for sure!

This was delicious. I have never used a recipe for pepper steak though I make it often. Thought I'd try a recipe this time. Glad I went with this one. I did thicken the sauce a bit. Also added a couple dashes of hot sauce. My husband said it was probably the best Pepper Steak he's ever eaten. Definitely a keeper.

This dish had way too much vinigar and honey. I would recommend trying a different recipe for those looking for a savory beef sauce rather than a sweet and sour sauce.

I didn't have Red Wine Vinegar so I used Balsamic Vinegar. I also added zucchini strips. I added the sauce after cooking the veggies and meat and thickened it slightly. I gave it 4 stars as it was a little too sweet, but very tasty.

This sounded good with the original recipe, but I substituted rice for brown rice and quinoa. Marinated the meat in the garlic and Worcestershire sauce for an hr. I was surpised that it was liked by whole family, even my picky eaters.

Absolutely delicious. The garlic and the honey combo is sooo good. Made some minor changes though. Seasoned the meat with salt and pepper then fried it separately. And I added a little bit of hoisin sauce and oyster sauce in the sauce. Really came out great! I think the sauce can be used with chicken as well.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because although it was very tasty, it tasted like sweet and sour rather than the savory  flavor pepper steak typically has. I made a few tweaks as suggested in other posts. I added some ground ginger, red pepper flakes and cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I used stir fry meat already cut found in the meat fridge at the market. Also, because I used more beef I doubled the recipe. Despite the different flavor, it was delicious and quick to be eaten.

This was so delicious and easy to make.  I followed the exact recipe. I used red and orange peppers. The steak strips were so tender and I made it over rice and it was fantastic!  My family loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

We make this about once a month. The only change is I use yellow green and red sweet peppers for a more colorful dish and use a thin cut shoulder steak that's less expensive than flank. Super simple and quick.

Overall, excellent recipe, would cut honey in half next time. Awesome flavor. added about 1tsp red pepper flakes for some spice and 1tbs of corn starch at the end to thicken sauce. Also doubled the sauce.

Sooo easy, sooo good!  I have made this recipe countless times, with a few modifications, and it comes out wonderful every time.

I always add a head of broccoli to the peppers, to pump up the veggies, along with garlic and a tablespoon of red pepper flakes (I am a huge fan of spicy..).  I did cover the pan for a few mins to steam the broccoli so that it wouldn't be too raw, but would also retain some crunch.  Before browning the sliced steak (I use London broil), I toss it in a mixture of flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I found this really boosts the flavor and browning of the meat and helps thicken the sauce at the end.  Once the meat is browned, I added the veggies and tossed to blend.  Before adding the soy, vinegar and honey, I mixed them together and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and blended well.  I then added the mixture to the veggies and steak and end up with a really great saucy consistency.  Once blended, I removed from the heat.  The sacrifice of not cooking the meat longer in the flavorful sauce, is more than made up for when the meat is tender, the veggies still have a nice crunch and the sauce is thick and coats everything.

Made this for my husband & he liked it. I thought it was a little too sweet with the honey. Might try it again with less honey and add some green peppers as well.

Really excellent.  The honey and vinegar makes it  although I altered the amounts according to taste and used more soy for more sauce.

I make this often. I leave out the wine vinegar (I just haven't tried it). I also cut the steak into bite-sized pieces (makes it easier to eat), and mix everything and rice together. It makes great leftovers. When I don't have honey I just use a cup of sugar instead. My family and I love this.

Excellent! I changed the preparation a bit by stir frying the red, yellow and green peppers with onion and garlic first and setting aside. Then in the same pan with a little more oil, stir fry the beef steak with a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. Then I added the veggies back and the sauce mix thickened with 1 tablespoon of corn starch.  I also doubled the sauce mix because we like a lot of sauce when serving anything like this over boiled stir fried noodles. This was SO GOOD!! Adding it to my regular stir fry rotation. Thanks for posting this fabulous and oh so easy recipe.

Delicious!! Tweaked it a little bit. Used two green bell peppers, 1 onion, 3 garlic - minced, 2 broccoli heads, a 1 zucchini. tripled the sauce and thickened the sauce with flower. I used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Served over microwave steamed rice. Next time I will try adding red pepper flakes. The sauce was delish!

I enjoyed the taste of the recipe and left all the ingredients as in the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was sauté the steak until browned and then added the sauce ingredients and simmered for 10 minutes.  I added the vegetables last and simmered for a couple of minutes.  I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Next time I will try with chicken breast.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I gave this a try, but should have realized it produces a sweet and sour flavor. It was good but not the pepper steak flavor I was looking for. Perhaps, the name of this recipe should be sweet-n-sour pepper steak.

I followed the recipe to the T, and although the over all flavor was ok, I did not find it to be restaurant quality.  The flavor of the Sherry was too overwhelming and the ginger and garlic were hardly noticeable.   I will try it again with less Sherry and more garlic and ginger.

This was absolutely amazing! Although I had to substitute white wine vinegar for Red wine vinegar it still turned out really well. It's a definite keeper and I can't wait to make some more. But a note for next time would be to marinate the beef in the sauce for an hour or so before cooking just to get really good flavoring.

I wish I would've seen the reviews that suggested the red pepper flakes and the sesame seeds for garnish!  I did not have honey so I substituted Apricot Jellly.  I found a low sodium soy sauce but it was still really salty. Great with a side  of broccoli.

I put mine in a crockpot after cutting up everything. I doubled the peppers and onions and then doubled the honey and soy. I added 3 cups water and let it cook for 8 hours on low. It was exceptional. Will make again.

This is the most amazing pepper steak ever! I've had some that are way too sweet and other's that are not sweet enough. This is so yummy! Easy to make and something that you would not get tired of if you ate it on a weekly basis! Yum!

We made an account just so we could let everyone know how amazing and easy this recipe is!!! The only thing we did different was stir frying the vegetables and steak separate (we actually used venison instead of steak which was fantastic!) and one they were stir fried separately we added them together in a stir fry pan and then added the sauce and a little crushed red pepper.  We used wraps instead of rice and ate them like fajitas and they were fantastic!! I recommend this recipe to everyone! It's GREAT!!

The sauce was not very good. Too salty from the soy sauce and a little too tangy from the vinegar.

I was surprised at how good this simple sauce was.  I will say that I made the sauce as written - after adding the onions and peppers it was a bit sweet for me, but still tasted good.  I did add a little flour to thicken it up and next time I would add some ginger and maybe some red pepper flakes to really take it to the next level.

I made this recipe tonight and I have never used vinegar or honey to cook with. Surprisingly it ended it up being pretty good! I did make some alterations I didnt have soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce and thickened the sauce a little with flour. I used another womans tip to cook veggies, meat, and sauce separately. It was a little bland for my taste so I would add extra salt and pepper but overall amamzing dish! My 4year old loved it and got 2nds my 1year old ate most of it as well. Oh! I dont like hard veggies so I cooked the onions and bell peppers until they were translucent

This easy and delicious! I cut some leftover roast beef into strips and followed Rhiannon's tips on the prep. It worked great...my med rare beef did not get tough. I cut back slightly on the soy sauce and added a little oyster sauce. I did add the cornstarch to thicken the sauce and a little brown sugar as it tasted a little tart to me. Who needs take-outs when you can make this in no time at home? Thanks for the recipe, Maria!

I love this recipe.  I changed the sauce a little and used 2TB each of honey and red wine vinegar from some of the other suggestions I read and it turned out really good. I did add a little cornstarch with water to thicken, too. The only thing I may change next time maybe to add 1/2 the soy sauce and add 1/2 teriyaki sauce, maybe to it, because it was a little too salty. I will definitely make this again.

This has got to be the EASIEST Peppered  steak recipe I have tried.  LOVE the sauce.  Cooking with red meat has never been my cup of tea, it usually comes out "Chewey", you know when you have to chew a piece of meat longer than normal and eventually spit it out in a paper towel or just swallow it with a gulp of water.   With this recipe I've tried it a few times  with the Flank steak (great)  but this last time  I  tried it with   Ribeye (WARNING: little pricey..but worth it). I sliced  it in thin strips, cooked the strips while still pink in the middle, then added it to the sauce for the last 10 min.   OMG, SO TENDER, you almost didn't have to chew the meat... family absolutely loves it, (PICKEY EATERS meticulous husband and two boys 14 & 10).  This one is DEFINITELY staying in my "do over" meal box.  Thanks for allowing me to cook a red meat dish with no paper towel in hand or a gulp of water!

great combo of flavors!  I like the honey's flavor (not necessarily too sweet) with the salty soy sauce and tangy vinegar.  I added some snap peas and broccoli to the mix.  The kids and husband gave it approval for doing again.  by the way, I cooked the steak quickly first because we like it slightly rare.

I don't eat meat but made it for my boyfriend. He gives it 5 stars and says it tastes like it's from a restaurant. When I was cooking it I thought it smelled bad so I added a little fresh lemon pepper but I'm not sure how much that changed the taste. I only put in 1/2 tsp. I did taste a little of the sauce and it tasted good to me. I also added some mushrooms since I had those to get rid of.

I tried this recipe tonight. The flavoring was really good. I marinated my steak in soy sauce and honey prior for about 45 min. That might've been a big mistake bc I found it to be very very salty. Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce and not marinade for so long. I also added a touch of cornstarch to thicken and didn't use red wine vinegar bc I had none. Otherwise, awesome.

I doubled the sauce and it was way to sweet!!!!  If I make again, I will use way less honey...maybe 1/4/ cup.  Tried everything to save it, but it was just too far gone.

Was fantastic.. I did fry the meat a bit with some Montreal seasoning and then drained off some of the liquid that accumulated. When I added the peppers to the meat I also added a can of drained tomatoes and a can of mushrooms.  Thank you.

I made this for dinner the other night and while my boyfriend and I liked it, I did have to thicken it up with cornstarch and water.  It is not the traditional "stir-fry" I have come to know from growing up.  I think what I will do next time is cook the steak first and then add in the vegetables next.  I will make this again though.

This was extremely delicious! We loved this one. I only had 1/2 an onion and for the peppers I went with red and orange. Everything was followed exactly. I just made sure the beef cooked on a lower setting since it is kind of simmering/boiling in the sauce. It came out juicy, thank goodness. I served it over my usual Jasmine rice. This is a keeper!!

My kids helped me make this tonight.  I added peapods for the selective middle-child as he won't eat peppers. I'd definitely cut down on the vinegar, add extra garlic, a little ginger & pepper flakes as some have recommended.  I did thicken with cornstarch as we prefer the sauce to cling to the rice.  I don't like the whole stir fry veggies, take out & then do the meat & readd. I did the veggies then added the meat.  Next time, meat first, then veggies.  Meat came out very tender but I bought already cut meat labelled stir fry as I was pressed for time.

Easy to make with a limited amount of ingredients.  I added some grated ginger, but I think the beef could be pre-seasoned with some pepper of Chinese 5 spice seasoning.  I may try that next time.  Overall, good solid recipe.

Recipe gets 4 stars because it didn't really seem like "pepper steak;" more like a sweet & sour kind of thing.  But it WAS really good; I added cornstarch and some hot sauce and it turned out nicely.  I'll definitely make it again-- just not when I want pepper steak.

Just made this tonight and OMG!  So very good and will definitely make it again.  The sauce was salty so I followed someone elses suggestion and added some sugar.

Completely easy to make. The entire family loved the pepper steak. The only change I made was doubling the garlic. It was pure perfection.

It was easy and fast to make :). I used merlot red wine instead of the vinegar, added about a tablespoon of Worcester sauce, added about a table spoon more honey and used frozen red, green and yellow pepper. It's so yummy and tasty to my liking!

Followed this recipe exactly, however tasted sauce before serving and found it to be too salty so I added about a 1/4 cup of sugar and used the cornstarch to thicken. This was more to our liking and made the meal enjoyable. Will definitely cut back on the soy sauce next time.

Its a great recipe but I did follow the suggestion someone else commented on, to cook the steak and remove it as well like the veggies before making the sauce.  My family loved it, I have made this two times already and will plan to do it again!

Love Love love this recipe!  First time I tried it I was grasping for something to make and only had a sirloin, an onion, and found some frozen peppers I saved.  I thought about making pepper steak, and went to google and this recipe came up....everything you need to go into this recipe you have on hand.  So easy, my husband and daughter (non-cooks) made it up while I was at class!  So tasty and quick to throw together, it is now on the menu almost weekly.

This quick and easy recipe isn't much different from my usual stir fry recipe.  Of course I modified it to my tastes by adding ground ginger, red pepper flakes, black pepper, corn starch, red wine and omitting the red wine vinegar.  I served it over white steamed rice.

Tremendous base flavors,decided to add water chestnuts, broccoli, and mushrooms. I wanted to add some zip & zing so I marinated the beef in General Tsao sauce (6.5 oz) and added 1 Tsp. fresh ground black pepper and 1 Tsp. Cayenne pepper while cooking. It was awesome. Thanks Maria

This recipe is abslutely wonderful. The only thing I did different was I bought New York strip steak. I pre-cooked the steak strips in a little olive oil and garlic powder. Then followed the recipe exact. I didn't have a problem with the thickness. I will make this again. It is very rare that you can find a recipe and follow it almost exact and it come out tasting delicious...

I had to add quite a few things to the recipe to make the flavor good for my family. I thought the flavor of the original recipe was to strong or bitter, so I added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes. A cap full of pepsi cola, one can of beef broth. 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, another garlic glove. After all the extra additions the meal was quite good. If I decide to make again, I will try less sugar and coca cola instead of pepsi.

Took the advice of another review and cut the vinegar and honey down to 2 tb sp. I also used a bag of froze peppers and onions since that is what I had in the house. My hubby loved this and is requesting more! Also, I managed to throw it together in 30 minutes....that bears repeating in my book!

Literally just finished making it. It good! I added a little bit of cayenne pepper and crushed red pepper because we like spice over here. I also followed other's suggestions and dialed down the red wine vinegar and added flour for a thicker sauce. I will make again.

This has become a household favorite that even our picky toddler embraces. It's easy to switch up flavor of the dish by using different vinegars--I've used red wine, balsamic or rice vinegar (or combinations thereof) depending on what I have in the pantry. I just tried making it with chicken instead of steak--just as awesome. Cornstarch is one of those basic ingredients I never seem to have around, so this last time I tried coating the chicken with a bit of flour before cooking. It did the trick--the bottom of the pan got very thick, but then the vinegar deglazed it and the sauce turned out very well.

I absolutely LOVED this pepper steak recipe!  The sweetness of the honey made it so unique and my boyfriend and I are putting this in our regular rotation for dinners.  I didn't have enough soya sauce so I used 1/3 cup of soya sauce and 1/3 cup of worcestershire sauce, turned out great!  Thanks Maria!

this came out excellent. I used sirloin instead of the flank steak and it came out very tender.  If you like your sauce thicker, add a little corn starch.

I followed the instructions exactly until the end.  For me it didn't have enough sauce.  I added corn starch, 2 cups water, and 2 beef cubes.  The sauce turned out great if a little salty.  I might try only 1 beef cube next time.  Great recipe though!

This is so good!  I've never made anything from scratch that was "saucy" but this was really easy and just the right balance between sweet & sour.  Great over brown rice!!

I thought this was going to be a great dish from the reviews. It definitely was a new taste for me. It has a very tangy flavor way to powerful. I wont be making this again but i suggest if you make it use less vinegar.

This was very simple and so tasty!  I used sirloin steak because that's what I had in the freezer, and more garlic (because well, we're garlic junkies).  I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch, but that's another personal preference.  The flavor of the sauce was very good.  This is a keeper!

I have to admit the honey threw me off but this was very good. I did add mushrooms as we all love them and served it over rice with some broccoli. It was very good.

Wow! I was a little apprehensive to try this since my husband generally hates vegetables, but he adored this recipe over some rice pilaf.

This was so good over jasmine rice! I followed the recipe as is, except for adding 1 1/2 tsp. cornstarch dissolved in 1 tbsp. water. Very tasty, will be making this again for sure.

I really liked this recipe!  I cooked the veggies (with the addition of sliced celery and carrots) then meat and placed them in a casserole dish.  I sprinkled this with ground ginger and placed in the oven on warm while I made the sauce.  I added cornstarch to thicken.  I used red wine for cooking as I did not have the red wine vinegar and it turned out great!  The steak was so tender, it was unbelievable!  Next time I don't think I'll use as much honey, though.  Absolutely delicious!   Thank you sooo much for this recipe...

Great recipe! My husband who loves Chinese food said this tasted better than any pepper steak he's ordered from a restaurant. He had the left overs for lunch the next day! We doubled the sauce to make sure we had enough to cover white rice and there was plenty.

This was good because it was easy. I subbed Seitan for the meat (vegetarian). I have cooked Seitan lots of times and I have always had much better results. The sauce was too liquid, and the flavors were unbalances. It needs cornstarch, less vinegar (and probably less honey), and something besides just bell peppers. This recipe needs some serious tweaking to make it good enough to serve for anyone besides yourself.  It didn't take long to cook though, and it is cheap. If it were more involved or expensive I'd rate it at 1 or 2 stars.

Great dish, it was very easy. I went to a Mexican Meat store and got the meat. That the onlt thing I change. It's amazing how good this was. I only hope I can prepare it the same way, next time. I added Red pepper flakes as someone suggested, that was very useful. Thanks everyone!

Excellent and very easy! I did not have any steak so I used leftover chicken, cut it up and added to the sauce with the cooked vegetables.  I served it over brown rice and it tasted just like a dish from our local Asian restaurant!

Delicious over brown rice. Thought it needed a bit more flavor as the honey was very sweet. So added more spices to our liking.

This was sooo good!!  I used leftover london broil from last night (sliced it thin), peppers, onions, broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn and celery.  More like a stir fry but the sauce is delicious.  I doubled the sauce as some suggested but it was too much, next time I won't. Also added some crushed pepper as suggested - good call. Served over brown rice cooked in beef broth.  Yumm...whole family approved!!

The first time I made this, it was good but too much vinegar for my taste so the second time I used less vinegar than what the recipe called for and it turned out great.  I've also used pork when I don't have steak on hand and it was just as good.  Will continue to make it!

I have to rate this a 5 star with only one change, 1/4 cup honey instead of 1/2.  I know if I would've used 1/4, this recipe could be a 6 star.  It is very easy and very delicious.

I have made this sooo many times.  Thanks Mariacoz--the sauce is fabulous--it's so easy to change the portions--just use equal amounts of those key 3 ingredients (honey, soy sauce and red wine vinegar).  The only change I make is I use sirloin steak so it only has to cook a few minutes-just until done.  Makes up very quickly that way.

Didn't have honey, so I used Hoisin sauce.  Tasted pretty good, but still needed something extra.  I'm not sure if using honey would have made much of a difference.

This is the best pepper steak ever. I'm used to having tomatoes in my steak so I wasn't sure how it would be without them. Also when I was cooking the sauce it did not smell very good but it all came together well. My family loved it. I'll never make pepper steak any other way ever again.

This was very good! I liked the tangyness of the honey and soy sauce together.. my daughter didn't like it too much, but it was a nice change from the ordinary Pepper Steak.

I took the advice of others and browned the steak in the oil before adding the other ingredient.  This came out great!

Very nice. Like others, I browned my steak strips in a little oil before adding it in with the cooked veggies and sauce. This recipe is very versatile - I think it would work just as well with chicken, plus you could throw in whatever vegetables you had on hand. Thanks!

I tried this with teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce, like other users suggested, and thought it was too sweet.  Then I tried it with soy sauce and loved it!  If you want to add extra sweetness, my suggestion would be to add more honey.  Great recipe! ** update** Cook beef only until no longer pink. Then stir in veggies and to mix and serve. Don't overcook beef. I added sugar snap peas and it was delicious.

Excelent. I sliced my beef paper thin and marinaded in the sauce for a few hours. I then sauted orange and yellow peppers-added 1 red hot cherry pepper, 2 fresh cayenne peppers,freshed minced garlic and fresh grated ginger-then sauted the meat -put both veggies and meat aside-put sauce in wok till it boiled-added cornstarch-put everything back in wok till hot and served over rice- loved it --thank you!

Great recipe. Can be made with sliced chicken, steak or pork. I chose to saute the beef first, then added the veggies and poured the sauce over top for the last minute of cooking. I Serve it over rice. It was a big hit with my family.

The steak was delicious. I used chuck steak, sliced thin. To save time and dishes, I stir-fried the veggies first, removed them from the pan, then the steak, and added the sauce ingredients right in to the steak. It was really good. I will make this my staple recipe for stir-frying steak and will try adding tomatoes next time. Thanks.

I used sirloin instead of flank steak, 1 yellow bell pepper and 1 green bell pepper. Besides those minor changes I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I serverd it over steamed jasmine rice. I am making this again for dinner tonight. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

The sauce for this dish is excellent.  I used a sirloin for this, but next time I might try the flank steak.  The sirloin didn't come out as tender as I would have liked.

Yum - the whole family liked it. I made it in the wok. Had fresh pineapple that needed to be eaten & I really think that made the recipe. Used less red wine vinegar - I don't like it all that much. Thanks for a quick, delicious meal.

This was pretty good, but the steak lacked flavor, so next time I'll marinate the steak in the soy sauce mixture prior to cooking.

I followed the advice of others and added the cornstarch, otherwise I follwed the recipe exactly, turned out great.  Served it over noodles and my husband loved it.  Update 7/6/08:  This is the 3rd time making this, it is delicious.  Thanks for the recipe Maria.

I made some modifications and used some of the suggested mods.  

1st, I made two batches of sauce, cutting the red wine vinegar in 1/2.  I marinated the meat in 1/2 of the sauce for 2 hours.

I stir fryed the veggies in olive oil 1st as others suggested, and then set aside.  Next I drained the marinade from the meat and cooked it next. then I added the veggies and my 2nd batch of sauce with some red pepper flakes, and cooked a couple of minutes.  Served over rice and it was DELICIOUS!

I highly recommend cutting the vinegar in half or maybe more.
