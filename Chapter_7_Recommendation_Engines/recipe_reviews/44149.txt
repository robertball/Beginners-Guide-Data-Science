My boyfriend, who is Trini, loved this recipe, but I too altered it.  I eliminated the bok choy, then instead of letting the liquid dry out I sauteed some onions in the sauce.  Once the onions were soft I tossed in some cooked rice.  It was so good, my sweetie ate nothing else but this until it was gone, the next day!

The only change I made is that I used boneless chicken because that is what I had in the freezer. I loved this recipe and I especially loved the bright orange the sazon season made it. The bok choy blended in perfectly in this sauce. This was so easy to make and the end result was very impressive.

Dee-licious!  Like another reader said, I was worried about caramelized sugar, but wow did it so much depth to the flavor.  I removed the chicken when half done and sauteed chopped white onion in the pan juices per another reader's suggestion.  When the onion was soft, I deglazed with chicken broth, added more Sazon and spices.   Added the chicken back in.  When the sauce reduced, I coated the chicken pieces and added the bok choy.   Served it all on a bed of rice. So tasty and so easy.  Thanks for my new chicken and rice dish!

My daughter and I loved it, it has perfect balance of sweetness and spicyness.  I made with Bok Choy, I am assuming that's why it was little on the dry side.  Recipe fails to mention stir after carmalizing sugar, I believe that's why some folks have burned chicken.

This was fantastic!  A couple of things you should know:  

1.  It's HOT!!!  I cut the cayenne significantly, and it still was very hot.  I love hot food, but my wife and kids were crying with every bite.

2.  My sazon is in a big jar.  I have no idea how to measure .18 ounce of something.  I went with about a tablespoon and that was good.

3.  The recipe doesn't say how long the sugar step takes.  I'd say it was between 10 and 15 minutes of stirring.

4.  I didn't have bok choy.  I used cut up summer squash and zucchini.  It was great!

5.  Saffron rice made a nice accompaniment.

I made this recipe to the T.  No changes whatsoever.  Honestly, I was also really scared about putting the chicken into a dutch oven with carmelized sugar and no liquid whatsoever.  Thankfully I was brave enough to try it and I am so glad I did!  I lowered the heat from medium to medium low just to be safe and once I lifted the lid off after 25 minutes, I was surprised to see a bunch of liquid in there just bubbling away!  (I used all thighs with bones and skin on btw).  After removing the lid I just continued to follow the instructions and was just wowed by the end results.  My husband also loved it!

We absolutely LOVE this recipe-we found it after my daughter fell in love with bok choy at a local restaurant.  I was a little shy of caramelizing the sugar at first but now that I've made it a couple of times I've found that it's a really great part of the dish.  I have been using a little less cayenne pepper-the full amount is a little spicy for my kiddo!

My BF sent this recipe to make for dinner last night.  He is Trini and absolutely loved it!  It is great to be able to make meals that take him back to Trinidad.   I would just add more bok choy stalks to the recipe.

Wow this was delicious! Instead of bok choy I used rice & reduced the cayenne pepper (I don't like my food too spicy). I had no problems caramelizing the sugar & that added a nice flavor to the chicken. Definitely will make again!!

The seasong was spectacular. However, I was using chicken tenderloin, so cooking time would've varied.  I was in a hurry and didn't think about that at the time and it upset everyone's asthma in the house when it began to burn.  Eh, I learned my lesson.  Not the recipes fault, so I rate this a five despite my mistake.  I saved it and it still turned out great, my dad loved it. I will make again, thank you!

Wonderful, tasteful, and quick. Completed dish as original recipe very good. Only because I like a lot of sauce I removed chicken from pan added addtional tbl spoon of sugar and a little bit of apple juice.  Placed chicken back in pan with the remaining ingredients. Thank you for sharing.

This dish was very good, unique and tasty flavours. I made it with ground chicken and also made my own sazon seasoning. I used pak choy not bok choy, as that's what I had on hand. I was initially anxious about caramelising the sugar, as I'd never done it before, but it was super easy. It adds a very different (and good) flavour to the chicken. Definitely make again, thanks for the recipe.

We loved it!  Browning the chicken in the sugar first was a great idea and made the chicken delicious.  I have since made this with and without coconut milk and also with pork. Great recipe!

This recipe is awesome, salty and spicy, and perfect over rice. I used 2 1/2 pounds of chicken thighs, because that's what i had on hand. I also added a 1/2 an onion for more flavor and veggies, and it tasted great. Love this recipe because its very cheap and easy to do.

I don't know what happened but my chicken pieces didn't produce any liquid so they started to burn..I thought quick and put 1/2 cup of chicken broth in the pot and continued to cook as directed. It turned out delicious.. I also put in 2 tsp. of cayenne instead of the Tbs.. (it was still a little spicy for me but not my friend).. Maybe next time I will even add less cayenne.. Served with white rice.. Very unique taste! Everyone must try!

I loved the taste but I burned my chicken. Be sure to brown  the sugar over medium heat, not high and stir as another reviewer has mentioned. Stir often, turn chicken etc to prevent burning.

This was excellent.  Spicy and flavorful.  Would definitely make again, but this time with bone-in chicken as written.

This dish was FABULOUS! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead because that's what I had on hand. I also found a recipe for and made my own Sazon. It was SO good. My husband raved!

My variation to the recipe is instead if white sugar, I use brown sugar; and half the salt. I serve mine on yellow rice. It's a great dish! I've made it several times!

I did not have sazon, so I used some black pepper, adobo, and lawry's perfect blend seasoning and rub instead.  Watch chicken carefully to keep it from burning in caramalized sugar.  I left the skin on chicken pieces.  Served it with quinoa and brown rice, and fresh pear. 12/12 megf

I must have done something wrong because all I ended up with was a black pan and black bottomed chicken!  The sugar burned and burned and burned and made a lot of smoke!

THis had a good flavor. I misunderstood the recipe and used boneless chicken breast instead of chicken parts with bones. The chicken was a little dry (probably overcooked). The next time I will try this recipe with chicken with the skin on it. However, I could still taste a good flavor.

I consider myself an experienced cook.. but this recipe ruined my pot! It left me with black and burned chicken. I even kept the fire on low while melting  the sugar out of fear of it burning. But after adding the chicken  everything burned :(

After reading all these positive reviews i hoped this recipe would work for me too.

Overall great flavours, heat and presentation. That said. I don't shy away from salty dishes but, this was way to salty for me. I will try again with adjustments. Further review forthcoming.

This was awesome. We used boneless skinless chicken breasts, which was fine, a little dry, but it was great. Made some jasmine rice with it cuz it's my fave. My boyfriend said it was too hot for him, next time we'll use less cayenne pepper. I think nuts or beans would be an awesome addition. He wants shredded carrots too. We'll definitely do this again.

This is an extremely easy recipe. I made this recipe for my husband and myself. It took about thirty minutes. Very delicious!
