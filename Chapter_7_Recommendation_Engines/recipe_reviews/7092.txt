Easy bread. I don't have a bread machine so used the allrecipes site advice on coverting bread machine recipes to regular methods. (You will find it under baking advice.) Definately need to up the water by 1/4 cup and I like a sweeter bread so upped the sugar to 1/3 cup. I also used dry buttermilk powder instead of just dry milk. Really good!

I love this recipe!  I have used it over and over again, and it is always a hit.  I prefer to bake it in the oven rather than in the machine, because the top rises too much for my bread machine.  Most of the time I sub 1 c. whole wheat flour for the white.  I have made cinnamon raisin bread: add 1 tablespoon cinnamon, more sugar and some raisins.  I have made garlic bread: add a couple of minced garlic cloves and some italian seasoning.  This recipe makes great italian breadsticks, just roll it out, twist and bake.

This is probably one of the best bread recipes I have ever made.  It was a great big hit with my family.  I made one loaf on Saturday and we ate the whole loaf for dinner.  I made another loaf on Sunday and we ate the whole loaf again.  I felt it was very easy to make and turned out very tender with a wonderful flavor.  I did not proof the yeast before I made the bread and it did not have a strong yeast flavor.  I'm positive I will make this one again.

Great bread.  I didn't have dry milk powder so I just used warm milk, which worked very well.

Great recipe!! I read the previous reviews and followed their suggestions ie: didn't proof the yeast and used 1 1/2 cups of water.  The loaf rose up to the top of the baking window and was very moist.

This is my favourite white bread.
It is so simple and delicious and my guests just love it.  I don't proof the yeast first and it tastes just fine using bread machine yeast.  I use 1 1/2 cups of water instead of 1 1/4 total combined.

This bread is fantastic!  I mix it up in the bread machine and then bake it in my oven and get 2 perfect loaves.  My 3 kids(ages 13, 10 and 6) prefer this bread over store bought and that is saying something! I will never have to buy bread again!!

My family really liked this bread better than all the rest I've tried. But I had to was a lot more water than was called for. I probably used a 1 more cup of water. It was gone in 1 meal. The whole 2 pound loaf.

One of the best breads on the site.  I did not do step 1 but put everything in the bread machine per manufacturers directions.  The bread rose just perfect (not too high) and the texture was wonderful.  My son requested that I make another loaf right away.  Thanks so much Danielle

Didn't really like this bread... I didn't make it in a bread machine so that may have been part of the problem.  it was very dry and crumbly.

This is only my 3rd successful loaf of bread out of 6 using other recipes after I stopped using my 15 yr. old bread machine. I don't miss the big hole in one end from the mixing paddle. However, I now use a KitchenAid Pro stand mixer with a spiral dough hook followed by a little hand kneading before rising. IMO this is the absolute best yeast bread recipe I've tried. The results: a full high crown, flavorful, light and fluffy on par with store bought varieties and much better than the spongy crusts with the bread machine. I did substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 tsps of instant yeast rather than 2 1/2 tsps of active dry Yeast. I used bread flour rather than all-purpose. I also did a quick--5 minute--luke warm proofing in the mixing bowl first to give the instant yeast a head start. I didn't change any of the other ingredients or water amounts. This recipe is a keeper! A big THANKS!

WOW!!! What wonderful bread! I upped the sugar to 1/3 and used 1/4 cup warm milk-like another poster since I am out of dry milk-and used 1/4 cup extra water. I must say this recipe is SO easy and I don't have a bread machine! Once the dough had risen once I punched it down and halved it making two loaves of bread-one loaf was eaten so fast no one wanted to eat the main course for dinner they wanted more bread! Soft crust-delicious taste- and super easy! A definite KEEPER! Thanks!

I used this recipe to make miniature hamburger rolls.  I made it according to directions, but before the last rise, I rolled out the dough and cut out the dough into 2-1/4 in. diameter.  I used a double shot glass, anything between 2 and 3 in. diameter will work.  I let them rise for 30 min. before brushing them with a beaten egg and sprinkling them with sesame seeds.  Then I baked them in an oven preheated to 350 degrees farenheit for 10-12 min.

This was almost too easy.  I took the dough out of the bread machine, put it in a greased 9" X 5" bread pan (no rolling out needed), let it raise for 30 minutes, baked it and it turned out beautifully!  I wish I could find a whole wheat or oat bread that would be as "user friendly".

I've made this recipe so many times I don't even have to look at it anymore. :)  I do make changes which yield a 1 to 1 1/2 pound loaf in my small Hitachi breadmaker - I eliminate the proofing phase (and the water and sugar used for it), use all whole wheat flour and gluten instead of all-purpose, halve everything except the yeast and water, use 4T of honey instead of the sugar, butter instead of margarine, and bake it on 'Bread - Rapid' with 'light' crust.  It comes out rounded and storebought in texture, which is what I was looking for and I usually just HAVE to have a piece right out of the maker (have to make sure it tastes right with butter, ya know! :D)!  Sometimes I throw in ground flax, or poppy seeds, or substitute half a cup of another flour (like teff) depending on what I feel like eating for the next few days.  This last time I substituted almond milk for the water and powdered milk and it came out just as delicious!

This bread is well deserved of 5 stars in my mind!  It will now be my staple white bread mix.  It turned out so beautifully soft and still perfect for sandwiches the next day, unlike many other mixtures which by then would need toasting.  

I was slightly worried that it would not turn out as I 'converted' from 15 to 10 servings to suit my 1.5lb machine.  Also I asked for a metric recipe (I'm in Scotland!) and the conversions always do look slightly odd in terms of the quantities.  BUT it turned out fine.  A definite favourite and top of the list from now on!

I can't get over the rave reviews.  This was average at best.  I've had similar tasting breads out of box of bread machine mix from the store.  It ended up very dense.  The bread was just a big lump in the machine and never rose well.  I know the yeast was working though because it was bubbly and foamy when the mixture was added to the machine...so I'm at a loss...

As with a previous reviewer, the dough rose too high for my 2-lb machine.  Although the top of the loaf didn't get cooked thoroughly, the remainder of the loaf was great.  I've made it several times since.  I increased the sugar and the potato flakes a little, and a few times I've used 1 cup of wheat flour with 3 cups of white.  Still great!  My favorite bread machine recipe!

I don't have a bread machine, so I decided to make this using my Kitchen Aid. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and all of the warm water. (I cut back the sugar to two tablespoons, we don't like really sweet bread.) After I added the melted butter and the rest of the dry ingredients, the dough was really super dry. It refused to pull together. I ended up adding almost four more tablespoons of warm water before it would pull together into a ball. I kneaded it with my dough hook for about 5 minutes, then let it rise in the loaf pan on my warm stove for about an hour, covered with saran wrap and a towel. Smells great. I'll update on the taste when we eat it with dinner. EDITED: This didn't really work for me making it without a bread machine. The bread had a great taste, but it was really dry.

This was my first time baking bread, but it turned out great. All my roommates loved it. I did add a little water to the recipe. I also do not have a bread machine so I used the oven, but it still turned out really nice.

Too good for words.  I actually tried this recipe a while ago but haven't rated it till now.  We make it about once a week and use the bread machine for mixing then transfer to pans for baking.  Once I used 1/2 cup orange juice in place of half of the 1 Cup warm water.  You can't taste it but I think it made the bread even softer! (Note: If using Potato pearls instead of flakes add them to the water first so they will disolve completely!)

Although this makes a tasty bread, it rose too high for my 2-pound bread machine. The result was that the top didn'r brown well. I did not proof the yeast first, and just used regular bread machine yeast. Letting the yeat get a head start actually makes a bread dough tast yeastier, not less yeasty.

I have 4 teenagers who pack lunches and I make this recipe almost every night.  It is awesome.  A lot like Wonder Bread, but better.  It does take up every bit of my large bread maker. I let the yeast, sugar and 1/4 c water set while I put the rest together, then I add the other 1 and 1/4 c water and the yeast at the end. Perfect every time.

Very yummy!  I used 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour, and used butter instead of margarine.  Also, I didn't used the bread machne: just went through 2 rise periods for the dough to double in size, and baked at 350 for about 25-30 minutes.

This was an okay bread recipe for me.  I like my bread to be fluffy and soft on the inside.  This was a little dense for me and didnt have as much flavor as I expected with the ingredients that was in it.  The bread was good, but Ive had better in my bread machine.  Thanks for the recipe tho.

I've made this recipe through the years and hands down it is our favorite white bread recipe. The bread comes out very soft, almost like the store bought white bread, but with a better flavor and texture. It has some "chew" to it rather than being gummy. I now use potato flour instead of mashed potato flakes and usually end up adding a bit more water than called for in the recipe. This is a keeper recipe.

This was my most successful bread so far.  I only used the dough cycle and baked mine in a loaf pan in the oven (after a rising it in the pan for one hour).  I baked it for 15 minutes, took it out, glazed it with a water and egg wash and gave it another five.  It was wonderful for toast, sandwiches and just eating plain.  Highly recommend this!  (The yeast "sponge" is a must - let it sit until it looks like a pile of mousse!)

Delicious! I just made this tonight and it was wonderful. The white bread I've made in a bread machine so far.  I will definitely make this again.  The only tricky part to me was figuring out which order to place the ingredients in the bread pan, but apparently it worked out fine because the bread was great! I didn't make any modifications.

I messed up and used the one cup of water at the beginning and didn't see to add more water at the end. It was a big mass and I thought it was ruined but I was able to save it and even with that mistake it still turned out good. I substituted honey for the sugar and the jury is still out whether that was a good idea. Overall a successful recipe and I will use it again.

Very tasty, easy, and cheap bread to make.  I replaced the dry milk & 1 cup of water with 1 cup of real milk.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of water per other's suggestions.

The recipe is my first attempt at baking bread and I love it!  My family doesn't want "pillow bread" from the store anymore!  I always exchange skim milk for dry milk.  Doubling the amount and cutting the water needed by 1/4 cup.  As far as the yeast, I use one packet and always proof it. It comes out FAB!

This is a fabulous recipe and I do think the secret is that the yeast, water, and sugar sit for a while before being added to the machine.  The crust was fantastic and the bread truly was one of the best I have made.  Thank you for a great recipe!

A fine enough recipe but I don't see what people love so much.  Maybe it's a difference in machines or personal preferences about bread.

I love this recipe! I was going to give my bread machine away because the few times I used it I didn't get very good results. I tried this recipe as my last chance effort. The results were, as the title sugests - "wonderful" ! Great flavor, texture, slices well. I just bought more yeast so I can continue baking in my bread machine - I wouldn't give it away for anything now!

This bread was pretty good! I had to add an extra half cup water. I used my KitchenAid mixer to mix the dough, and wasn't sure how   to let it rise since I don't have a bread machine. I opted to immediately separate the dough into two medium sized bread pans and let it rise in a warm oven for about an hour and a half, until the dough rose over the sides of the pan. The bread turned out pretty tasty, but the texture left some to be desired. It's good, but not very flexible. I like the flavor of the Country White Bread recipe better but will probably try making this recipe again with bread flour instead of normal flour to see if it makes a different in the bread's consistency.

I love this recipe! I didn't proof the yeast first and it turned out fine. I used bread flour and bread machine yeast. I also added 4 tsp. vital wheat gluten. This bread is so soft on the inside and has a perfectly chewy/crunchy crust. I will definitely make this again and again.

good recipe although i never measure when making bread  it's simple liquid to flour. ratio. but i did not use potatoe flakes. i always boil a potatoe cut up. n use the liquid from that in place of the liquid in recipe.  you will have the softest best bread ever.  all of our grannies from the 30s n 40s did this

Dough VERY heavy. Had to add more water and it ended up still tough like a brick. I'll have to give it a go again and start out with a cup less flour. Flavor was there (used seasoned instant potato flakes) but very disappointed in the texture. Also baked on regular cycle and should have used sweet because the crust was really really dark.

This really is wonderful!  I liked the flavor that the potato flakes added.  I used 1 cup of wheat flour and 3 of regular.  Very nice and different recipe.

My daughter is allergic to dairy, so I modified the recipe... it is wonderful! I substituted better than milk rice powder for the dry milk, and used a non-dairy margarine. This is the only bread recipe I have found that tasted like real bread for my daughter. I use the bread machine, just because  I don't have time to bake bread every day otherwise. 

This is a keeper, truly a great recipe!

This turned out great. It did touch the top of my bread machine though. I used bread machine yeast without the early start & I used 1 1/2 cup of water as suggested by other reviewers. I used the light crust setting & I'm glad I did because it was plenty dark.Very soft & tasty.

Excellent bread, very easy to make and consistent. It also is a wonderful base for other variations, as an example, I throw in a 8 oz container of peach yogurt and replace the liquid with peach nectar for an excellent peach bread. Highly recommended!

My first time ever making homemade bread, and it turned out delicious.  I proofed the yeast till it was foamy, and followed all directions exactly, except for the potato flakes.  I didn't have any so I left them out. No breadmaker, just used the oven.  The bread was great. Since I rarely cook, my relatives almost didn't believe I'd done it.
