LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I don't use a cookie press so I roll and cut w/ cookie cutter.  I use a little more extract and adjust the vanilla accordingly.   I have had one non diabetic try them and one diabetic and both want the recipe.

These cookies were a pain to make and turned out dry!  I do not recommend making the cookies.

Tasteless and difficult to work with the dough, it wouldn't stick coming out of the press, had to scrape it off each time.

Great recipe! I used splenda granular the first time with no almond ex and they had an after taste. The second time I used the 1/2 cup of splenda baking blend and I used all the other ingredents but a little less flour and they came out great but they need sprinkles if only I cound find sugar free sprinkles.

My picky diabetic husband cannot get enough of these.  My children love them also.  They do not even notice that they are made with splenda and not sugar.  They are a little dry, but I have found that with splenda recipes. I substituted lemon extract for the almond extract, personal preference only.  They actually come out better than sugar spritz cookies, do not burn on the bottom.
