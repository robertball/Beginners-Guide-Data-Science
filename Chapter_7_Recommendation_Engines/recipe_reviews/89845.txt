Very tasty.  Didn't use the tofu or the serrano chilis, but substituted 3/4 tsp. chili pepper flakes.

this was a pretty good start for someone (like me) who hasn't ever made this soup before. 

i added shredded carrot, regular mushrooms & some other crazy mushroom i found at market. i also added chili oil and prepared the whole thing in a cast iron dutch oven/jumbalaya pot. it rocked.

This was just OK - it needed more vinegar and more chile pepper - not very hot or very sour.

This was a great recipe! I doubled soy and vinegar and added white vinegar. 1-2 tablespoons of Tamarind soured it up and worked well with the cilantro. It reminded me of a Thai version.

This absolutely surprised me !! I did not expect it to taste so authentic without the lily buds and black mushrooms. I used a combo of fresh and dried shitakes, but other than that made as directed. The balance of sour and heat was pleasant when I first made it. However, I prepared through step 2 about 2 hrs before serving. It lost some of its original zip. I had to tweak it with soy, vinegar and more pepper. I also used a white pepper/black pepper combination for heat. Egg added some cloudiness but did not affect taste. My advice: Have everything prepped, but do not go past step 1 until just before serving.

This was a good start but I ended up having to tweak it a bunch to get enough flavor for our tastes and was still left feeling like it was missing something.  I am going to have to order a bowl again and figure out what I am missing.  Also, I love cilantro, but I have to say that I felt it did not belong.

This was a great dinner. My kids wanted to try tofu, so this is what I picked. They loved it as did my husband. I could not find the tamari so I didn't use it, it was still great

I didnt have tamari sauce in the house so i made it without it. I didnt like the ginger pieces, so i think next time i would use it with dry ginger. I love this soup...and it was SO easy to make

I doubled the amount of everything except the bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and egg. I also added some thin slices of onion and left out the corn starch. Overall a very good recipe.

This was ok. Not sour enough, and black fungus is a must in hot and sour soup. This could become perfect soup, but would need lots of doctoring first.

I had no bean sprouts or shitake mushrooms, so left them out (they would have been very nice) I used dried red pepper flakes adding them to the broth to blossom. I used 'better than bullion' for the broth.I use sherry in place of Marin and I added (thawed) frozen sweet peas. I used pressed fresh extra firm tofu cubed quite fine. It was wonderful. I will make it again soon and add the sprouts and mushrooms.

Just what I was looking for! This is very close to what is served at a local Chinese restaurant. I followed the recipe,  but ended up adding an extra TBSP of vinegar.  I would not recommend the cilantro.  It just does not belong in this recipe. This soup is fantastic when you have a cold.

As written, comes out way too salty even using low sodium soy sauce. As others have I had to add a lot more rice vinegar which fortunately brought the taste more closely in line with what I expected. The only other changes I made were no egg (forgot it), ground ginger instead of fresh, and finely sliced bok choy (stalk and leaf) in place of bean sprouts since the store was out.

I feel like it's missing the the somewhat velvety texture that you get from restaurants, but I also think that probably comes from the usual meat components so you probably won't get that in any vegetarian version.

I used sliced, white button mushrooms and added fresh peas. It's very close to the soup I used to love at my favorite Chinese restaurant. They added some small shrimp but I prefer it without them. Very tasty!

This was just OK for us.  I know there are a lot of kinds of Hot and Sour but this one missed the mark for us.   First - I think White Vinegar is a must (the Sour part) and White Pepper instead of black pepper gives it the Hot part)   Overall, this needs too much tweaking to even be the same recipe.  Sorry

Excellent soup -- flavorful, filling, yet light. It's a great alternative to the thick hot and sour soups that have meat in them. It was also fast and easy to prepare. My husband, who spent years in the Far East loved it, as did I. I didn't have all of the ingredients, but given the great taste, I think this recipe is very versatile and forgiving. This is a definite "keeper" in our recipe box! Thanks for the recipe ReddPanda.
