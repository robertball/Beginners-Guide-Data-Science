This is a very nice recipe and they are so cute. I dipped my cheesecake pops in melted semi-sweet chocolate and rolled it in crushed graham cracker crumbs. This made it taste just like the cheesecake had a bit of the crust on it. Delish!

Oh my gosh!  Be really really careful not to overcook the cheesecake even the tiniest of bits.  I got distracted by the phone, and ended up with a crust.  Picked the crust off, and tried to scoop the balls.  But they had a very poor texture, part creamy, part hard, and I ended up having to reblend the whole cooked cheesecake, which I then put back in the fridge.  The melon-baller wouldn't work because of the blending, so I had to form the balls by hand, which was a mess.  It worked out and tasted good, but I added a lot of extra work and stress, and I was haunted by the idea that they could have been much better than they were (even though they were a big hit). I am here to tell you, do not over-bake the cheesecake!!

Loved these.  Instead of using a scooper I used a little non flavored pam on food plastic sanitation gloves that you can get at Sam's etc. and rolled them into balls.  After making all the balls I then put on new gloves and rolled them into the mixtures that I had prepared ahead of time that we like, used flat hand of palm against top and inserted sticks to the other end then put in fridge.  Made prep time so much easier and everyone loved that they could have there own favorites without having to make twenty different cheesecakes.  Thanks so much for the post.

I made these for a baby shower and everyone just loved them and wanted to know how to make them. They were a bit time consuming, and I forgot to dip them in toppings while they were still wet (so that they would stick) and instead just had some dipping sauces, caramel and raspberry preserves. I had white chocolate on some of the cheesecake balls and milk chocolate on others, and my favorite was the white chocolate balls dipped in the raspberry preserves. YUM!! I will definately make these again, but only for special occasions.

I made key lime cheesecake pops for my husband for his birthday.  It was quite messy and I was worried they wouldn't turn out, but after a couple of hours in the freezer, they were so easy to decorate!  I dipped them in white chocolate and did graham crackers, coconut and fresh raspberries for my toppings.  This is a great way to present cheesecake in a fun and new way!!  Both kids and adults go crazy for it!!  Thanks for the idea!

I can rate the method only, as I used it to salvage a cheesecake I baked that did not turn out as 'pretty' as I hoped it would.  It was still delicious, and I didn't want it to go to waste, so I made these cheesecake pops!  Not only are they fun to eat, but they turn cheesecake 'flops' into something really special.  I'll make these many times in the future--thanks for the idea!

Great recipe. Big hit at the office. We made one strawberry cheesecake and one coconut macaroon cheesecake. We coated the strawberry cheesecake with white chocolate and drizzled the remaining strawberry sauce on top before setting. We coated the coconut macaroon cheesecake in semi-sweet chocolate and sprinkled toasted coconut on top. The possibilities are endless. Thanks for a great idea.

Ok, so I have to admit that I have only baked 2 cheesecake's in my life and this was the 2nd one!  Either way...the cheesecake turned out well and I formed the balls quite simply.  My problem that I ran into was that my chocolate dip became to thick...I guess I need to watch it better.  All in all an amazingly clever recipe but definitely very, very time consuming.  This is a 2 day project but would be perfect for kids to help.  I dipped some in crushed Butterfinger, Heath Bar and Snickers.  I don't reccomend the snickers so much b/c of the caramel but any other hard candy bar would work great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these as a Christmas gift for the cheesecake lovers in our family, and they LOVE it!  I took some cherry pie filling and put the cherries out on wax paper, and then I put them in the freezer for just a little while to get firm.  I used the "gel" to swirl in the cheesecake before baking it.  After I scooped the cheesecake I pressed the firm cherries into it and hand rolled the balls before dipping them in chocolate.  It was a little time consuming, but they tasted just like bite sized cherry cheesecakes!  Huge hit!

The finished product was delicious, but it was a time consuming mess.  I baked the cheesecake according to instruction, and baked until the edge was beautifully golden, then cooled in fridge.  But the majority of the top and sides of the cake were too stiff to be molded into a ball.  Perhaps the cake should be slightly under-baked?  I used two different kinds of chocolate to dip, and the Wilton melts worked fabulously.  The other Almond bar would not melt into a thin consistency.  When I went in to dip the balls, the stick often came off the ball due to the heavy nature of the chocolate.  I did take someone's suggestion and decorate with sprinkles immediately after dipping, as they do dry very quickly.   One mistake I made was to put them in the freezer overnight, and by the time I took them out, several had cracks in the outer layer of chocolate, and they immediately began to sweat, and the cute napkins I used as decoration underneath the display became wet while the candy coating almost became soggy.  Despite these imperfections, I still had many great comments from the people at the baby shower, and they said they were delicious.  First time was lots of work, perhaps next time won't be nearly as hard.  I just wish the popsickle sticks wouldn't pull out so easily.  Perhaps I should freeze them longer before coating in chocolate.

I made these for desert on Easter Sunday, Everyone absolutely loved them. Didn't make any changes to the recipe itself...but I couldn't find Lolipop sticks, so I made the Pops a little bigger and used Popsicle sticks instead. Again these were amazing...but I mus say very time consuming, but so worth it in the end :) I will upload a photo!

Such a Creative and Delicious idea, Cher! Dipping in the chocolate was very time consuming (couple of hours) but they were worth the outcome. Tasty as well as pretty! Thank you for such an elegant & fun recipe!

I loved countrymomma's photo with the pops without the sticks, so I attempted to do them the same way. They did receive rave reviews at the luncheon I took them to this morning, but mine were in no way as pretty as cm's. Thank you Cher for sharing this recipe. Everyone loved them. Next time I will use the stick, it will make it a heck of a lot easier to dip and roll - the toothpick method I used was tedious at best!!

Cher....what can I say.....these were a hit with my Mothers Day BBQ!!!! Followed the recipe to a "T". Great results, although it was a little messy and time consuming....well worth the efforts. I did use a cup of warm water to dip my cookie scoop in while forming the balls of cheesecake. It helped a bit with the sticking. Overall, a great treat and sooo cute. Will make again! Thanks Cher!

Wow! What a nice presentation! It was time consuming (I even took another reviewers advice about using gloves and rolling balls in your hand instead of a scoop)but so worth the effort.  I took these to a bridal shower it they were a big hit!  Thank-you!

I made these for my son's bake sale for his class and they were a huge hit! I used several different kinds of sprinkles as well as crushed Butterfinger candy bars to roll them in once they were coated. Then I added each one to a pop bag and tie. They looked so professional!! This recipe is quite time consuming, so be prepared to work. However the end result is so worth it! They looked and tasted amazing!

I used another delicious cheesecake recipe to make these, but followed these directions on how to make them into cake-pops. They turned out well, looked and tasted amazing, but were a lot of work. Cheesecake is hard to roll into balls. Not sure if I will attempt them again?

Very easy to do but I felt the flavor was not 100% what I'd call "superb". I did everything as directed and came out with more than 24 pops but I really didn't want that many so I disposed of some of them. So, they weren't good enough to keep all.

I made this for Christmas eve as a special treat. The word from my daughter was "this is the bomb," translated," this is really good!"  It was an easy and fun change for dessert. The favorite was a chocolate coating rolled in coconut.

Just a tip - it’s best to dip the stick in a little of the chocolate before you put it in the cheesecake then put in fridge.

This recipe is great. I didn't have sour cream, so I added another block of cream cheese, and I lined a casserole dish with parchment paper and baked it for 35 minutes. It scooped into balls fine, and I just dipped them in dark chocolate and drizzled white chocolate over them. No lolly pop sticks are needed, people ate them like truffles.

My family made these last night and decorated them today. It does take a long time! But, we made a chocolate cake version at the same time and by far the cheesecake balls were easier to shape and keep together on the stick then the chocolate cake version.  We used melted semi-sweet chocolate, crushed  graham cracker crust crumbs, crushed peanut butter M&Ms, powdered confectioners sugar, and raspberry preserves for topping choice. So yummy!
