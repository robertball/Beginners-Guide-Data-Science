Good Grief! I haven’t made this in years, because I can’t find Knorr Mushroom gravy anymore, but this photo makes me so SAD. Lol. Note to self: update recipe from scratch perhaps. 

Just wanted to add a note that KNORR mushroom gravy makes all the difference in this recipe I think. Thanks for trying it!

4.5 stars for this fast, easy, tasty supper.  I made it with different mushroom gravy pkg. mixes, and you are right, Weejackie, the Knorr IS the best.  I also serve it with mash potatoes or sticky rice, and frozen corn.  My 'Boys' lap it up! Real manfood.  Thanks, WeeJackie.

In defense of this recipe, I must admit that the smoked sausage I used when trying this recipe didn't taste very good. However, I think even with the best sausage, this recipe would still be bland. For my family, this recipe was not good at all. We thought it was very bland and had an unpleasant texture. We tried it over rice but no one liked it.

This was quick, easy and yummy. I used turkey smoked sausage and skipped the mushrooms. I used it as a sauce over cheese tortellini.

Easy and tasty.  We served it over rice.  The only change to the recipe is that we let everything simmer a little longer due to our sausage being salty.  Will definately whip this up again.

Im not a fan of brown gravy recopies, and got worried when I started to cook it realized what it was.  Having said that, it turned out pretty good.

Just OK ... didn't find the mushroom gravy added much to the smoked sausage.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I'll stick to grilling the sausage.

Incredibly bland, yet overly salty. Needs some flavor.
