Recently made this for the second time.  I used a bottled peanut satay sauce and preferred the taste to my homemade version last time.  I wrap it up in lettuce with some rice (for more substance) and add asian hot sauce (like you see at the restaurants).  It's great!

I'm Chinese and I thought this was YUM!  This is a traditional Shanghainese dish (Chinese).  I live in Hong Kong but don't know what you mean by "asian peanut sauce".  Never heard of such a thing except there is peanut dipping sauce but that's Japanese.  I used spicy sate sauce (Lee Kum Ki brand) which had peanuts as an ingredient. I skipped the mint leaves as mint is definitely not Chinese and it would have made it taste "strange" to me but maybe more familiar to Westerners.  Great way to get kids to eat lettuce!  My kids gobbled it up--even my 5 year old.  I also used pork instead as pork is usually what we use for lettuce wraps.  Beef would seem rather dry to me in comparison.

These are wonderful! I made them for new years eve and they were a hit! The combination of the peanut sauce and hoisin was scrumptious and the addition of the cucumber and mint added just the right freshness and crunch.  You definitely need a stiff lettuce (romaine would be great).  I used green leaf lettuce because it was what I had on hand and it was very limp and messy. Stick with the recipe and you will enjoy. These wraps are a real treat!
