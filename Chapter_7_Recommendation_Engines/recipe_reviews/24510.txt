I started this recipe because I had cooked veggies, salmon & rice to use up - before I read the reviews & looked at the rating (2 star at that time)... It was dry and bland...so like one of the reviewers suggested, I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup low fat milk and then baked/microwaved til heated thru. Hubby thought it was good, and it was one of those recipes that I would make again if I had the ingredients on hand and needed a meal in a hurry. It's not a company dish by any means, but it is healthy comfort food with the rice & veggies and salmon... Thanks for sharing!

I thought the recipe was a little too dry. Needs something creamy added, like cheese or a white sauce.
