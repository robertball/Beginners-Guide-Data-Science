My mother used to make beer syrup when we were kids. It is out of this world, but this recipe needs a clarification.... you cannot use any kind of beer. Micro brews, pale ales, flavored beer and any bitter type beer will result in a disaster. It is best to use good old fashioned american lager (aka redneck beer) such as Bud or Old Style or Busch. Also add a dash of cinnamon.

We used Long Trail Blackberry Wheat for this recipe. Not only did it take 40 mins to boil down but when it finally did and poured it over pancakes the syrup was so bitter we couldn't eat our food. It might have been the beer I don't know but I'm never trying this again.

I used an American lager for this. This turned out extremely bitter. I don't know what went wrong but I don't think I'll try this again.
