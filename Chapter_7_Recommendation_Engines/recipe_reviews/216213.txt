These super fudgie cookies are pretty good--if you eat them within about 24 hours.  So rich they'll make you pucker.  I made them exactly as written, except I cooked them for an extra minute.  They don't look like they've cooked at all when you look at them.  Just trust that they're done.  I touched the tip of the kiss and lightly pushed it down rather than tapping the cookie.  They really need to be eaten in about a day or so, because they get dry pretty fast.  Oh, and here's a little tip.  Don't refrigerate the dough between batches.  It will dry up and not make good balls.

Be warned these cookies are a sugar bomb!  However, they make a great presentation and people go crazy over them.   They are gorgeous. I actually baked them one minute less than it says, like the other reviews say, they do not look done but they set up quickly so have your Hugs already unwrapped and ready to go for as soon as you pull the cookies out of the oven.   As I removed the cookies I swirled my spatula around with the cookie on it to spread the candy out.   A small tap on the tip of the Hug works great too. I think I might try putting the Hug in upside down next time to create a flatter surface for when it melts.

These cookies are delicious! So easy to make and they were perfect as directed. We also used a Candy Cane kiss for a little bit of mint and they were even better than the ones with the hugs (which were pretty incredible anyway!).

I tried these with both the Hugs and the Mint Truffle kisses and I definitely like the Mint Truffle version better.  Very good either way, though.  Based on other reviews I will put the leftovers in the freezer.  I put the kisses in tip down, waited until they melted a bit, and then spread them around a little with my finger.  I may skip the cinnamon or cut back on that next time as the cookies have a strong cinnamon flavor to them.
