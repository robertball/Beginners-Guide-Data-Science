I found the taste of this really good. The only thing I did different was I substituted a Carolina reaper for the jalapeno and chili flakes. Nice intense heat on top of sweetness of the sauce. Will definitely make this again.

i didnt have rice cakes which was sad, but i instead turned into my own creation, i think.  i call it 'buldak lasagne'  hehe.   i had some lasagne sheets available and made a quick cheese sauce.  not everyone will probably like it but it was fantastic.   who would want a boring lasagne after having a spicy one.
