I did add about 1 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, but otherwise made as is. Family loved these- the spring onion mixed in was a wonderful change of taste to cheddar biscuits.  
And thanks for the note on making your own self rising flour as I do not keep that on hand

I never thought any biscuits would be better suited for soup/stew than my own southern buttermilk ones, but I was clearly, and happily, wrong.  I made these bad boys with Chef John’s Irish (lamb) Stew on St Patrick’s Day and they were incredible.  After making them another 3 times over the following weeks, it was decided they were only to be made on special occasions as they never lasted more than 6 hours in our home.

The kitchen was so hot today after I roasted a chicken that I was real!y worried.  I used the food processor to it the butter in.  I forgot the extra soda.  It came out really good, but next time I will use more cheese!  Did get the Dubliner cheese.  Will definitely do these again!

Lovely flakey biscuit with a puff pastry feel to it.  Did not have self-rising flour however the 2 cups flour, 3 tsp baking power and 1/8 tsp salt and it worked fine.  Thanks for teaching me some new tips for baking biscuits Chef John!

When I dumped the dough onto the work surface, I was sure these were going to flop. I was sure the "shaggy" part was way too much, but I went ahead and smushed it into a ball anyway, and rolled it out. I couldn't find my rolling pin, so I had to use a wine bottle. Worked fine.  It was still looking a little rough after the first addition of cheese and green onions, but by the time I folded and rolled that out, it looked fine. I didn't want to bother with cutting and rerolling, so at the end, I just rolled it out to a half-inch thick rectangle and cut it in twelve pieces. The cooking time was a bit different, but unless you're using exactly the same cutter, pan dimensions and composition, oven, atmospheric pressure and humidity, and ingredient brands, that's always going to be the case. That's what oven lights are for. Take them out when they look done.  They tasted fantastic, but the cheese and green onion layers could have been distributed a little better. Maybe next time, I'll spread the cheese and onions over only 2/3 of the dough each time so there's no doubling up on the cheese when folding the dough into thirds.

These were so flaky and delicious. Made just as noted in the recipe, making sure the butter was nearly frozen. Definitely best when hot out of the oven so don’t bake ahead. These will be a go to that I try with different add-ins in the future.

I used whole milk with lemon concentrate ( the child-proof safety lemons-!).  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I got a nice flaky biscuit and it was delicious.  I will practice some more with these biscuits.  
Thanks for introducing me to a bench scraper; a very good tool.

Excellent! These are much easier to make than I thought when I read the directions the first time. We loved them with soup, and will be making again

As usual, Chef John delivers another winner! These are light layers of biscuit that make a great change from my traditional southern drop variety. Be generous with the cheese and onion, depending on your tastes. It is integrated so nicely with the folding and rolling technique!

I used an English Cheddar instead in some that I made, we liked that better than the  Irish cheddar.
Either way they are wonderful fresh out of the oven or day old wrapped in waxed paper.



Thank you for the "high-five" for making it twice, however we like them well enough that I must have made about seven batches or more by now. Woo-hoo!

These biscuits are out of this world! The only variation that I had to the recipe was that I didn’t have buttermilk, and I didn’t make buttermilk with vinegar. I just put skim milk in. They’re perfect! I used frozen Kerrygold Irish butter, and I used their Kildery cheese. We had leftover sausage, so I decided to make sausage biscuits. This is a great savory biscuit!

These are the very best soft and fluffy biscuits that I have ever made. The addition of the green onion tops and cheese made it an extra special delicious family favorite that we really enjoyed. Thank you for this great recipe.

I layered butter and the cheese and spring onion into the biscuit dough. Warning they puffed up a lot. They were positively delicious, I was hesitant to put the spring onion, but it gave it an excellent flavor. I tried one and decided to have another. An excellent dinner party dish. So good. Two big thumbs up.

These were fabulous!  I skipped the green onion and just used cheese. I've made these twice now and I think that I'm addicted.

These were good, but I felt the spring (green) onions were a bit overpowering. Might make these again, but reduce or leave out the green onions. Dough came together easy though.
