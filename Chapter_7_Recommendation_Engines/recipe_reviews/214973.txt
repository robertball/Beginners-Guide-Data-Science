This one one of the best salads I ever made.  I served it at a bridal luncheon and received rave reviews.  The flavor combinations may sound unique, but they blend so well together.  Each flavor plays off the others making this salad a really well balanced, and healthy meal. I made it a few hours prior to serving so the ingredients could settle in together.  In addition I topped the salad with salted cashew nuts to add a little crunch and cut back on the olive oil to keep it lighter.

A nice fresh salad. I enjoyed the combination of flavours, and the grapefruit was a nice treat. I made a few substitutions/changes. Parsley instead of cilantro, onion instead of shallot, a couple shakes of ground cayenne instead of the serrano pepper, and mixed greens instead of the bed of arugula. I would definitely suggest adding more cranberries.

Wow is this good!! So many fabulous flavors going on!  Changes based on what I had on hand: I did not add the cilantro, cranberries or grapefruit, but did add some steamed but still crunchy - cooled broccoli.  It added another green to the mixture and truly the dish was so good!  I would make this again and again.

Delicious!  I forgot the pepper and the mint, added a little bit of seasoning salt and cayenne pepper.  Subbed in mandarin oranges for the grapefruit for the welcome citrus punch.  Perfect for a fresh summer meal.  Leftovers packed up well and were just as good for lunch the following day.

I was skeptical about the grapefruit, but it's one of my favorite fruits, so I gave it a try. I used parsley instead of cilantro because my husband hates cilantro and baby spinach instead of arugala because that's what I had. It was absolutely delicious! Really fresh and clean.

It really was an odd combo which I normally like but not this time.  I would cook the onion or eliminate it and definitely do something other than grapefruit which is why I tried it in the first place but it left a werid aftertaste. Something sweeter like oranges may work better not sure if I'll try again

A staple in our household. My teenagers ask for it weekly.  I've made it many times following it exactly, and many times switching the fruit.  Always a hit....

Very nice salad.  I did not have a serrano pepper, so skipped that part.  I will try it next time.  
Healthy main dish for vegetarians.

Love, Love, Love.  Just a fun and yummy salad with a beautiful merriment of flavors.  I have made it both with and without the mint and I don't know that I even noticed so if you don't have mint on-hand don't fret.  I also used Spinach once as well instead of Arugula but I do like the spiciness of Arugula.

Very refreshing dish with a medley of highly complementary flavors.  Great for entertaining.  Even without the avocado, it works well.  I only used about 1 tbsp of mint because I was afraid it would overwhelm the dish, but it could have actually used more - next time, will try 2-3 tbsp.

I didn't like this one at all. I followed the recipe, exactly, and found that the 'dressing' simply didn't add very much flavor to the quinoa, at all.  In addition, I was surprised to find the combination of spices in this dressing made it taste very 'asian' which I'm not particularly fond of. I was not expecting that flavor.

Loved this recipe! I adapted a bit, to make it my own, based on what I liked/had available. I cooked the quinoa in 2 c water instead of 4 c, added onion/garlic powder and cayenne pepper to the water (didn't have fresh ingredients on hand). Also, halved the amount of cilantro, upped the lime juice after tasting, and doubled the avocado. Used half arugula and half spinach. Used extra cranberries too. It was amazing!

This is amazing. Lots of interesting combinations of flavors, fresh , light and yet filling. The only thing I did different was to add a whole pepper for more spice. My husband even cleaned his plate!

X the shallots and sub oranges for grapefruit and I'd give it a 5. It's a bit too sour with grapefruit for my preferences. And the raw shallots are very spicy, even when minced.

I've made this salad many times and it's always a hit. I use a whole grapefruit and add it along with the avocado to the dressing. Rather than serving on a bed of arugula, I add extra arugula to the salad. LOVE this salad!

This is such a delicious summer salad full of so many good flavors. I thought that the ingredient list seemed a bit long, but everything worked together really well. The only changes that I made was I cut back the liquid to 1-3/4 cups of chicken stock so that I didn't have to try to drain the quinoa. I also mixed everything together, I didn't serve the avocado and grapefruit on top, and I used a combo of spinach and arugula. I will definitely be making this again.

Amazing.  I rinsed the quinoa well (to remove the bitter taste) and tossed it in a wok to toast.  Once toasted, I added the 1-3/4c water directly into the wok (eliminated the draining).  Cut the oil in half and left out the avocado and cilantro (I will try it with avocado next time).  So, so good!
