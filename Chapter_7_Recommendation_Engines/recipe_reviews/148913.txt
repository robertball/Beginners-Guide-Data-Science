Great, easy dressing!  I will definitely make this again.  Two things I changed:  didn't add the lime zest (didn't have it) and added 2 cloves garlic (as someone suggested). Why buy bottled, when you can make something this good, this quickly. Enjoy!

I love this dressing! It beats any honey mustard dressing you will buy or try on this site- the seasoning's make a huge difference, most of the other dressings are missings something. Some tips:
1. The type/brand of mustard makes a huge difference. My favorite is grey poupon's course ground dijon mustard. 

2. I also use light mayo (kraft or hellmans). 

3. You can also sub 1/4-1/2 the mayo with olive oil for a slightly different taste. 

4. I also add garlic powder..around a Tablespoon because I love garlic! Fresh garlic would be even better but I'm lazy.

Holy cow!  This has to be the favourite dressing at our house- and that's saying something, because we have tried so many dressing recipes.  This works well with fat free mayo, too- just make sure you whisk it well to get rid of the lumps.  Once I substituted agave nectar for the honey, and that made the dressing quite a bit sweeter.  Great either way!

This recipe yields 11 servings, but it only took two days for me and my boyfriend to finish!  I'll make it again with garlic for a little more kick.

I love this dressing, so does everyone else I make it for. The only tweak I made to it was to decrease the apple cider vinegar to 1/4 cup so the dressing is a little thicker and not so vinegary. I like it the original way but my kids like the variation. What I absolutely think is genius is the lime zest, it really makes this dressing unique and was why I tried it in the first place. We think it's the bee's knees!

Very good!  I used lemon zest as that's what I had on hand.

This is good but my husband and I thought it had too strong a vinegar flavor. I will make this again with less vinegar.

This recipe couldn't be more simple or more delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

Kind of runny and a little heavy handed with the vinegar.  Not a keeper.

This is really good. I did make one change. Instead of using all Mayo, I used 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 sour cream. Just trying to keep the fat count down. Instead of food processing, I just minced my onion and garlic (yes, I added garlic cuz I like it.). Other than that, I made no changes. It was really awesome! Thanks for sharing. I love making my own instead of processed foods with all the additives and preservatives.

Fabulous, exactly what I was looking for.  After reading reviews, I went with half of the called for vinegar to start off and found it was enough, also was nearly out of mayo (we use vegenaise) so did half of it with non-fat greek yogurt and it was outstanding.  Lots of cracked pepper, no extra salt here as the mustard makes it salty enough for us all by itself.  Will make again!

Wow. This is the best honey mustard dressing I've ever had. One of the best salad dressings I've ever had.   Based on other reviews I only used 3 tablespoons of vinegar and I used 1/3 cup of olive oil in place of that amount of mayo. So easy to blend this in a bowl with an immersion blender.

This was excellent--exactly how I like my honey mustard--pungent and sweet at the same time.  The only thing that kept it from 5 stars was having no 'heat'--we remedied that by adding some cayenne.  Used on a crudit√© plate and was finished off in no time.
