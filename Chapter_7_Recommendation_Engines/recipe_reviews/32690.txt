The color was not attractive and the taste was overpowered with the grapefruit. I had a shower of 75 and made 64 servings. Boy do I have a lot left over! No one asked for seconds and some requested water. wendy

I did not use "brewed tea", I used instant tea as a time saver and doubled it as the recipe says to.
The color of this punch was "muddy" and unappetizing at best.  The people that drank it loved the taste, but it took some convincing for some to try it.  I made it for my son's baby shower that I hosted.  I wanted everything perfect, spent alot on decorating, and then was forced to serve punch that one commented, "The color is appropriate for a baby shower, because the color of the punch looked like "baby poop".
Try using freshly brewed tea, and let us know if it turned out any better than mine.  And, it wasn't even that good, I believe.

i thought it was good. you should always try it yourself first before serving it at a shower or to guests, im sorry but that is just common sense.

the taste was good, and the color wasn't that bad (haha "baby poop").  Try/test it personally yourself before you use it for company, for your approval.

We made this as well as a cucumber punch and they were good compliments.  I accidently put in white grape juice that was meant for the other beverage, but it was to our benefit I think.  It was delicious!  We used Honeybush tea, you could taste it, but it wasn't overwhelming.  I really liked it.

I made this for my office party and made it to the exact recipe.  It was a hit!  Not too sweet and not too "grapefruity."  Even my boss (male) wanted the recipe!

This punch tastes great! I served it at my supper club where I have some tea lovers and tea haters. The tea lovers enjoyed it but the tea haters stayed away, which is unfortunate because you can't really taste the tea. It's just a great flavor base for the citrus. I'm a big fan of OJ and grapefruit juice together.
