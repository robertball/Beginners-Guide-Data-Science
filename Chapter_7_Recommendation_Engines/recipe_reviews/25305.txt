I made this for my family last night, substituting sausage for bacon, and salsa for the tomatoes.  To the sauce I added some freshly ground pepper and some chili powder.  
Not bland at all, a very quick and simple dish, and very filling.

Pretty tasty I thought. I added lots of salt and pepper and Minced Garlic. Instead of baking I just put the cheese on top at the end and then used a lid to cover , let it sit for 10 minutes and perfectly melted cheese. Savfed me a dish to wash and I didn;t have to have the oven on. Good with a Salad on the side.

Better than I thought it was going to be.  I used canned diced tomatoes, added garlic seasoning, ground pepper, chicken boulion, and seasoning salt to give it some more flavor.  I also didn't realize I ran out of milk so I used half and half.  Nice and fatty, but good!  Will make again.

This recipe turned out pretty good and my small children liked it. I did change a few things to make it more flavorful and a bit more healthy. I used about three pieces of bacon, cooked in the pan first then taken out so I could wipe out the pan and brown the beef, onion and about a 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic. This cut down on some of the fat transfer to the beef. I then added everything to the large sauce pan and used the Healthy Requests Cream Of Mushroom soup and 2% milk. I also used a cheddar jack combo for the cheese because that's what I had on hand. At this point I added some kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. I used Barilla Plus elbow macaroni noodles, they are multigrain and have protein and omega 3's. They did take a long time to cook in the sauce pan, but I think that it probably made the noodles more flavorful than cooking them in water first. Overall, it was a success even with my picky 2 and 4 year old.

This recipe is just a little bland, I did however add a few spices to it, but it still seems to be missing something. I made a couple little changes - I didn't have any canned whole tomatoes so I used a can of diced instead and also I used the pre-crumbled bacon that you get from Costco. I did cook the pasta seperately first, too, and that saved a ton of time, so I definitely recommend that to anyone making this in the future. The spices I added, just for reference, were some crushed red peppers, regular pepper, and a bit of garlic salt. Oh and some minced garlic too. I think I would make it again because it's definitely quick and easy but I'll change something next time. Hopefully this helps anyone else that's interested in this recipe!

We liked this recipe.  I think omitting the bacon, as one person did, is a big mistake because it gives the dish a lot of flavor.  I cooked my bacon first until it started to get brown, then cooked the hamburger and onion in some of the drippings.  I added the first half of the cheese after everything had cooked and the pasta was done, but I couldn't see turning on the oven just to melt the cheese on the top. I sprinkled the rest of the cheese over the finished dish in the pan, then put on the lid it to let the cheese melt.  Tasty and filling!  Ill make it again!

I changed several things.  I did not use bacon at all. I browned 2lb lean ground beef  and onion with Southwest seasonings from Vita Mix, 1.5tbs.  Drained the meat.  I then added 14oz of crushed fire roasted tomatoes, 18oz skim milk and 1/2 cup sharp shredded cheddar. I let it boil and added 6oz shell pasta.  It would have been much better to make the pasta separately and I will next time. Once pasta was soft, I put it into the dish and sprinkled with a cup of sharp cheese. I baked it for 10 min and it really was tasty. I hope you enjoy. My picky guys told me it was good, and they are harsh critics :)

I cooked the pasta seperately to save time, also, when I went to the cupboard to get the Cream of Mushroom soup, I only found Cream of Chicken, so I had to use that.  I used a bit more cheese on top and we thought it was pretty good stuff.

This is very good. It was good as written but I added a package of onion soup mix to it and bread crumbs on the top anyway. It added a new depth of flavor.

Tasty recipe, I converted it to be more of an Italian pasta dish. Didn't use bacon, used diced tomatoes with italian spices instead, added spinach, and added italian spices like oregano and garlic to it. Very yummy! Also easy to make gluten free by subbing gluten free pasta.

I added minced roasted garlic, turmeric,  paprika, and 2 Tbsp of taco seasoning. Also didn't add it to a casserole dish (no need for an extra dirty dish). My family loved it!

I substituted shells for elbow macaroni and it was super awesome. The little bacon pieces get stuck in the shells and you sometimes get little bacon-y surprises. I used a little more cheese than the recipe called for because, you know, more cheese is better every time.

It was very good, however, it took quite some time for the pasta to soften up. I also used more milk, added mushroom and spices. Very good.

This recipe was really good. The only things I changed were: I added some garlic, pepper and chili flakes.I added the cheese all at once and mixed it in and didn't bake it.

This was a very good last minute meal. I left out the bacon since I didn't have any and used colby jack cheese because that's the only cheese I had on hand. Hubby loved it.

I made this but changed a few things before. I read the reviews before trying it and a few people said it was bland so I added salsa instead of just tomatoes. It was very good and it had a kick cause of the type of salsa. Loved it!!!

This recipe was just okay.  Most of our kids liked it, but it had a funny smell to it.  Taste wasn't exceptional, just okay.  Not very pleasing to look at either, but certainly easy and fast if you cook pasta while you're cooking the ground beef!  Probably won't make again though.  Sorry!

Bacon is optional.  I found it wasn't necessary to bake it.  To speed things up, cook the pasta while browning the beef, then just stir into the mix.

Good taste, Pasta took forever to cook so I think next time I will cook the shells while I am cooking the meat to save time.
