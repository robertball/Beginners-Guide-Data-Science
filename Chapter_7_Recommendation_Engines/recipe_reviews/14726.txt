Indirect on the grill means to put the meat in the center of the grill and, on a gas grill, turn off the burners directly under the meat.  On a charcoal grill place the charcoal on the sides of the grill so none of the charcoal is directly under the meat.  Weber grills usually come with an accessory that will keep the charcoal in place or maybe a trip to the hardware store for an accessory.  This is also a good way to cook chicken.

This recipe was fantastic!  I rubbed the tenderloin with olive oil before I sprinkled it with the spices, and turned it often on the grill.  My parents and I all LOVED it!

Ok, so I'm gonna sound like that 1980's Nicholas Cage movie Valley Girl, but OH My God! That like was totally awesome!!!
I have cooked tenderloin so many different ways and my hubby never likes it...ever. This was the best way to cook one, and the simplest! To have so few ingredients, it sure has the best flavor!! Thank you sooo much for this recipe and this will be the only way I ever cook tenderloin ever again.

This was great.  I have always had fear of cooking on my gas grill using the indirect method.  (I have a Ducane.)  I really gave this a try and was so shocked at how nicely it worked, just like the recipe said.  I did put it on the direct heat at the very end to get a little darker color on the coating.  Texture was fabulous.  If you are leary of using indirect method, give this a shot! Served it with a made-up recipe for pineapple fried rice that was very very good.  At the end of the meal, I sliced up the leftover pork and mixed it into the rice for a nice lunch the next day.

This is the best and easiest pork tendeloin recipe yet!  So tender! Just to add to the flavor I placed a foil packet of dry apple wood chips (not chunks) over the front burner and kept the grill temperature at 350 degrees. The tenderloin was at a perfect 160 degrees after the 45 minutes on the grill.  There was a small piece left that we sliced thinnly and used in a salad the next day.  So yummy - can't wait to try again.

I really like this recipe. It's easy and
quick. I put the meat on a greased 
toaster-oven pan over a charcoal barbecue.
It was indeed tender and yummy.

Simple and delicious! This is perfect for when you don't have time to marinate, yet still want something tender and juicy with a lot of flavor. I cut my tenderloins into 1 inch chunks and put the garlic powder, salt, pepper along with a bit of smoked paprika into a large ziploc bag. I put the meat in and shook it up to coat each piece.  I skewered the meat onto wooden skewers and basted with KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce. Just be sure not to overcook to avoid that dreaded dry pork...

We do not use indirect heat. We do keep the burners down lower on our natural gas grill.
Since there are no bones to give false readings, a meat thermometer lets you cook these to perfection. Reminder, the cooking continues after the meat is removed from the heat. We also use a narrow tray to let the meat rest on and 
re-absorb the juices that flow out while it rest. We do not always hide that fantastic flavor with BBQ sauce. Salt and pepper can be totally adequate.

Very fast. Great flavor.  Be careful not to over cook - use a thermometer, remove just before 80 degrees and let it rest...it will continue to cook up to the last few degrees as it rests.

Grilled this on our propane grill using indirect heat. I seared the meat on both sides (450 degree-ish) and then turned it down to 350 degrees for 30 minutes and 15 minutes more with the BBQ sauce. I've also cooked this before at 400 for 25 minutes and then 10-15 minutes with BBQ sauce when I wasn't paying attention to the temp. For someone trying to figure out timing on this without searing just do 350 for 35 minutes and then 15 with sauce. The 5-star rating is for the recipe AS WRITTEN, but I now add smoked paprika and onion powder to my seasonings. That's just a personal preference. Rest assured it is GREAT as written. I always use Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. Another reviewer wrote that they put the rub on and then let it sit in the fridge for a while, claiming it makes it tender and juicy. However, salt, if left on, will leach the juice OUT of the meat (not to be confused with brining, which is a great method, and will happen if left on for longer and more liquid). So, my thought was imagine how juicy it would be if she didn't let it sit. I put the rub on and then right on the grill. I paired this with a pineapple fried rice. Great recipe Cathy Christensen :-)

Great cooked over charcoal; we enjoyed every bite. Moist, tender, with just a light barbecue flavor, made even better using Jim Neely's Interstate Barbecue Sauce direct from Memphis. It just goes to prove that a recipe needn't be complicated to prepare nor require a lot of ingredients to produce a dish that shines.

Quick and easy recipe. Very tasty. I would add that the secret to a moist thick cut of pork, which a loin is, is to cook it slowly so it doesn't dry out. I heat my grill until it's popping hot - 600 to 700 degrees F. After oiling the grates place the seasoned loin over the direct heat for one minute to sear that side of the loin. After one minute turn the loin to sear the other side, baste with bbq sauce and turn off one burner and lower the other 1 or 2 burners to the lowest setting to get the bbq down to 325 - 350 degrees and continue cooking over indirect heat. After about 15 minutes turn the loin again and baste with bbq sauce. Continue approx another 15 minutes. A meat thermometer is recommended to establish an internal temperature of 145 degrees. Remove the loin at 145 and tent with foil at least 10 minutes. Slice diagonally. I guarantee the pork will be moist, tasty and very enjoyable.

Loved it. I'm not sure what "indirect grilling" is, so I put the tenderloin on the top rack of the grill & put a pan underneath it on the bottom rack to catch the drippings. It was delicious. I love garlic, but it did seem a bit overwhelmind (especially the leftovers). I will definitely use this recipe again, but may reduce the garlic powder.

I've cooked MANY a pork tenderloin as it's one of my hubby's favorites.  I had never used an indirect method of grilling.  I am now a convert!  It was the best, juciest method of grilling for this type of meat.  I'm not sure the combination of seasonings makes as much of a difference as the method, as I added my own personal preferences with seasonings.  I did brush with BBQ sauce of choice during the later part of the cooking.  WOW is all I can say.  I also added soaked wood chips on the side (in foil with holes pierced to release the smoke) I can't wait to experiment with more cuts of meat!

Absolutely excellent.  I took from another reviewer's experience and roasted in the oven at 350 degrees, applied the barbeque sauce and lowered the heat to 325.  My husband loved it and he's not a big fan of barbeque!  I will definitely be making this one again.

LOVE!! I usually cook pork on the grill with indirect heat.  I just sear it quickly first and then move it to the unlite side of the grill. Turns out juicy and yummy every time!

This was amazing, but honestly I think anything would have since the meat is just so wonderfully tender and delicious! But the bbq sauce did compliment well. I did this in the oven at around 350 for about 45 minutes then another 15 mintues at around 325 because I don't have a thermometer, I wanted to be sure it was done. Next time this meat goes on sale I'll be making it again and will hopefully be able to grill it!

Don't disregard this recipe because of it's short ingredient list.  It's terrific and very easy to make.  I ended up cooking it on my gas grill over direct heat because it was too dark, rainy and windy outside to maintain the correct temperature over indirect heat.  I even used generic Safeway BBQ sauce.  Despite this, it turned out great and was well-received by my family.  Give it a try - pork tenderloin is an excellent cut of meat.  Make sure you don't get the pre-marinated kind, though.

This was the best pork I have ever had. I read a few reviews, and some of them were prety negative, one user said that all they could taste was the spices...in my opinion, they must have over seasoned. I cook a lot...and I dont normally even measure seasoning out, I just eye it...well, I did that, and I can tell you I used more then what was called for, and I thought it came out amazing!! The only thing that I would do differently next time is, on the last 15 minutes, where you add the bbq sauce, I would cook it about 5 minutes longer, and I would reapply bbq sauce every 5 minutes for the duration of the 20 minutes to build up a thicker bbq crust. Other then that....this recipe is PERFECT!!! So tender, so flavorful...just PERFECT!!

Made this the other night for my sons and the both loved it. Older son said he would eat it as long as he did not have to "fight" with it (he does not like steak like meat) and he was the one that ended up asking if he could have what was left. My younger son gave it two thumbs up. Super tender, I seasoned it then sealed it with my Food Saver allowing the spices to really get into the meat. I will definately make this again.

We loved this!  We regretted only cooking on tenderloin and will definitely always cook at least two each time from now on.  The flavor is amazing considering how little effort is involved.  I love that my husband takes care of cooking these on the grill freeing up the kitchen for prepping side dishes.

Easy! Tasty! My husband ate half of it during the slicing process! I think the rest of the family was lucky to get any... He loved it that much!!!  The kids inhaled it too! Definitely will go on our regular rotation! Thanks Cathy! This is awesome :)

OMG...I am very-very impressed with this recipe.  I consider myself a pretty good chef, but I am a little shy about tenderloin.  Especially about cooking it on the grill.  It is usually dry and boring in the oven, so I don't use it very often.  THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE GRILLED PORK RECIPE!!!  It is easy, moist and very yummy!  The only thing I did differently is to cut the tenderloin thru the middle (Not all the way through) so I could gage how done the inside was.  After I cut it I then tied it with twine to keep it together.  I wanted the Loin done in the middle, but not dry.  The rub prevented the tenderloin from drying out, and it was FABULOUS!!!  Thank you very much for a GREAT recipe!

Who would have guessed that such a simple recipe, could be so wonderful?  I used three tenderloins for this recipe, and I cannot remember ever having such tender, moist pork in my life!  When my husband was slicing it, he asked why on earth I had bought so much meat for us, but low and behold, not one slice was leftover.  Even my 7 yr old had three helpings!  I am so glad I tried this, and will be making it often.

Hard to rate this as not enough info was given - at what temp should the grill be set?  what is indirect grilling?  I made some assumptions on my own, as well as read some of the reviews to get more direction but this recipe really needed to provide more info.

Very good recipe! I followed it exactly but next time I think I will put it over direct heat for a few minutes at the end to really seal in the BBQ flavour. Thanks!

I marinated one 1 lb. tenderloin for 6 hours. Coated meat lightly with EVOO, then used chopped garlic from a jar, dried minced onion, Cavendars Greek Seasoning, and a small amt of rosemary and thyme. Skipped the bbq sauce part. Cooked directly on grill high temp for 5-7 mins(flip and cook 5 mins other side), then moved to upper rack off heat for 10 mins, lid closed. Let stand on platter 10 mins. EXCELLENT. Thanks!

Looking for a grilled tenderloin to BBQ without a liquid marinate and tried this one. It's absolutely tender and delicious...So EASY to make with ONLY 5 ingredients which brings out the flavor of the actual pork instead of hiding it!! The tenderloin was a treat, so plan to make it with pork chops. Definitely use a good quality BBQ sauce. We only use Jack Daniel's and when it's on sale, we stock up :)  This is on our summer-time grilling menu. TY Cathy...AWESOME!!!

Use a pre-soaked cedar plank and cook directly over the coals.   It's easy and you can't burn it. Add a little more time and cook by thermometer.

Really good.  I think my grill was a little too hot because I overcooked it a little bit and it wasn't as moist as other pork tenderloins I've tried, but that was my own fault.

Absolutely wonderful.  We had my folks over for our first BBQ of the season (my poor husband, out in the rain!), and they raved about this one.  This was our first time using the indirect method for grilling, and we were pleasantly surprised -- the pork stayed nice and juicy, but the BBQ sauce got crispy (the way I love it).  This is a definite repeater recipe for us.

Great recipe!  Followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out perfect.    Pre-heated my gas grill.  Used the burners on one side and cooked the Tenderloin on the other.

Great simple, straightforward recipe!  The pork was great, very moist.  As other people said, I would add heat at the end to give it that "bbq crisp" that you look forward to.

I could not cook this on indirect heat, as I was cooking on a Weber Baby Q.  I heated the grill to medium high and seared the meat on both sides.  I cooked it on the far side of the grill as far away from the flame as possible with medium heat for 30 minutes.  I basted periodically with lots of Sweet Baby Ray's. BBQ sauce.  We loved it.  
Served with potato salad, kale salad, and corn on the cob.

Followed prep instructions and ingredients. Forced inside by rain, browned about a minute per each side in cast iron skillet, baked at 325 for 20 minutes, adding sauce during last 10 minutes with small amount of water added to pan to reduce burning/smoking. Removed at 155 degrees, rested 10 minutes. Perfectly pink, juicy, delicious.

This got double thumbs up from both my teenage daughter and her friend. Her friend thinks she should come for dinner more often!  Instead of bbq sauce, I used apple butter, and rather than using the grill, I baked it in the oven at 325 for 1 hr, adding the apple butter at the 45 minute mark.  Yummerific!

This is an odd thing to say, but because of this recipe we learned we don't like BBQ'd pork tenderloin.  For our taste, that particular cut of meat is too tender for BBQ'ing.  However, I'm going to try cooking it in the oven instead.  We found the flavors to be very good.  We used Bourbon Whisky BBQ Sauce from this site.  Definitely a match made in heaven.

Very good!  I don't like using jarred bbq sauce but I did, next time I'll try it with homemade sauce.  Used a grill to cook and kept the flame low.

Simple recipe that turned out better than expected!  The pork was tender and juicy with a nice crust on the outside.  There is only one small chunk left!

Only change I made was to add some red hot sauce to the barbecue sauce for a little kick and rubbed the tenderloin with olive oil before grilling.

I grilled mine on a gas grill - browned it for 5 mins on each side and then turned off the middle burner, brushed it with about 1/4 cup of bbq sauce and then cooked with indirect heat for 20 mins. Perfect!

Great!  After cooking it on indirect heat for half an hour it was still a ways off from being done, so I ended up moving the meat to the direct heat.

This is one great recipe.  The taste was great and the pork was moist when done. Rave reviews rec'd by my wife the next day when she brought some to work.  Her co-workers insisted the pork tenderloin had to have come from a restaurant as it was still tender and moist!

I do NOT like tenderloin.  However, I had the task of cooking one for dinner last night.  So I used this recipe as a basis and it totally rocked!  Followed the reviewer who used the broiler method and it was super perfect.  I guess the reason why I was never fond of pork tenderloin was just the method hubby used for cooking it!

The pork was so tender & good.  I used a mixture of Cajun seasoning, salt & pepper to rub the meat, which added a little kick.  My fiance loved it, & he is usually not a big pork fan!

Grilled Pork Tenderloin Haiku: "DANG, this was so good. And as easy as can be. Marinated mine." I treated the garlic powder, S&P like a dry rub, then poured the BBQ sauce into and over the pork tenderloin in a large ziploc bag for 4 hrs. Grilled as instructed and was rewarded w/ a crazy tender, moist, perfect hunk o' pork.

Very good. Turned after 7 minutes then again after 6 minutes and then again after 5 minutes.  Have to watch that the bbq does not go up to 400 should keep at 350.

I thought I would give this a try but I really didn't expect to love it. This recipe is fantastic.  The only thing I added was to rub the meat with olive oil first.  My boyfriend can't stop raving on this and he doesn't even like pork much!

Great way to prepare this. I marinate the meat for an hour or so before cooking, then sear it on the grill on all sides before closing the lid. Let it stand ten min before slicing so it won't dry out.

Excellent recommendations for cooking times in the comments.  Mine was just under 3 lbs and turned out wonderfully moist and tender.  Cooked for 1 hour, turning every 15 minutes with the grill at a consistent 350 degrees.  Delicious!

This was SOOOOOO Good....Couldn't keep my grill at a consistent 350. So I cooked it about 35-37 minutes before the sauce....Kids loved it too.  I'm going to slice it tomorrow and put it out on the table with Hot Mustard, barbecue, and sesame seeds...

Honestly, it's too bad only 5 stars is the limit.  I have cooked pork tenderloin many different ways, but nothing this simple should be this wonderful..but it is!!  Turning every 10 minutes did the trick.  Perfect as is!

This recipe was so easy and SO good.  I had never tried the indirect cooking on the gas grill so I was a bit nervous but it turned out fabulous!  This is a keeper!!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as shown and it turned out great! I had been trying to find a tenderloin recipe that I really liked for years and had no luck until I found this one.

I've made this now several time and have found that I like it the best (it's the most tender) when I grill it longer and slower.  This is a great and simple recipe.  I do still add the bbq sauce after 15 minutes.

I have never cooked pork before and this recipe made it so easy!  I used chopped garlic instead of powder and used Master's Choice (at A&P) Honey Garlic BBQ sauce.  I had some trouble with the "indirect" cooking method.  Either I didn't really get it, or Canadian winters are too cold to get good indirect heat on the BBQ.  I did the first 1/2 hour on indirect heat, and then flipped it and did another 25 minutes on the grill, flipped it again for another 15 minutes and then put it on the top for another 10 minutes.  In the end, everything was fine and it was AMAZING!!!  I will make this again and again because if its taste and the simplicity of the recipe.

What did I do wrong? The spices were WAY too much - it was overpowering, I couldn't even taste the meat, it was so salty. I can't believe this recipe got such good reviews. I also used a barbecue sauce that was too flavorful, I should have used a bland store-bought sauce. The tenderloin was super tender and juicy, but it's hard to go wrong with pork tenderloin. The indirect heat method was easy, although I wasn't really sure how hot to keep the grill - I ended up at about 450 to begin with, then allowed it to cool to 350 for the rest of the cooking time, and the meat was perfect. I will definitely grill pork tenderloin like this again, only with a tenth of the spices and sauce.

Wonderful! Absolutely Fabulous! I'm still smackin my chops from the meal.
However, I did have trouble with the indirect heat method. This was my first time and I ended up having to put the meat directly over the heat and, Mmmm, Mmmmm Good.
I oil rubbed the meat and then added the seasonings. That's it folks! You must try this recipe!
Thanx

I was skeptical since it was so easy - but it was succulent!!!!  I seasoned the pork with goya seasoning (has everything in it), then broiled it in the broiler for 15 min. both sides, basting often.  Thanks Cathy.

Use grilling planks for easy indirect cooking over a lit burner. Follow directions about soaking. Planks can usually be used more than once and add a nice smoke aroma and flavor. Several wood varieties are available.

Made this tonight and it couldn't be easier! However, the cooking times are different on the video vs. the printed recipe. From my experience, cook over indirect heat for 15-20 minutes, then an additional 10-15 minutes after basting with BBQ sauce - total cooking time for me was about 35 minutes. Excellent!

Used 1 pork chop.  Jack Daniels barbecue  (original) sauce.  It was excellent.  Everything (time, ingredient measurements) needs to be adjusted because I only used one chop.

Needed a quick easy way to prepare pork tenderloin (I always forget to marinate meat early in the day!).  This was sure simple enough and it was amazing.  Followed directions to a T and it was great!!!  Used my gas grill and turned the pork a couple times.  Mine was tender and very moist. Served with a potato salad from this site along with a salad. YUMMY dinner!

I wanted to say thanks for this great recipe. I did it on a T-Fal Opti-Grill. It came out great. I had to wrap the pork in foil, and was worried that it would steam the meat, and make it tough. Didn't happen. Came out perfect. 

Would definitely advise monitoring pork with a meat thermometer. I think that's what helped me!

Coated in mango, coconut dipping sauce. Amazing.

Like others here, I am a pork tenderloin fan and have tried hundreds of recipes over the years. I was reluctant to use this recipe at first because it just seemed too easy/simplistic. Boy am I glad I tried it -- it was wonderful and a definite keeper! I didn't change anything in the original recipe except the cooking method: I cooked mine on a broiler pan in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes, and then an additional 15 minutes after I brushed both sides of the meat with the barbeque sauce. Excellent recipe!

This was my first time cooking pork tenderloin and this recipe made it easy! I did as another reviewer suggested and rubbed the tenderloin with olive oil before sprinkling on the spices. I also made my own bbq sauce. I cooked it in the oven, covered, at 350 for 45 minutes.

Just made this on the grill and I must say I may now be a devotee to the indirect cooking method.  Could not believe how juicy the pork tenderloin was.  Put the barbecue sauce on the last five min and moved it over to the gas side for about two more min just for good measure.  It was exceptional and will be a keeper on our summer/fall menu for sure.

Tender, juicy, and delicious! Perfect pork tenderloin. I cooked it on a gas barbeque and followed the directions exactly. No changes necessary.
Thank you Cathy.

This is great...tastes like boneless ribs.

I rubbed the tenderloins with olive oil and mixed the pepper, salt, garlic powder with paprika as a rub.  Will def make again.  Very moist and delicious!

The meat tasted great but it took much longer to grill than described in the video connected to this recipe. We cooked it about 1 hour. Will still add to my recipe file! Thanks!

Easy, simple recipe!!  We did indirect grilling and added water to our drip pan to keep the Pork moist and it worked like a charm.  Wonderful dish that we will definitely make again!!

Delicious and SO easy!! My first time grilling with indirect heat, and I am not usually very talented with a gas grill. This came out perfect! I put a piece of foil under the grate where the pork was as a drip tray. Finished the last 10 minutes on direct low heat to carmelize the bbq sauce a little. Used my meat thermometer to check the temp, a 1.6 lb tenderloin took about 50 minutes. My husband said "don't ever bother making ribs again - this has no fat, no bones, no mess, and is every bit as delicious". VERY tender and flavorful. Thanks for a great simple recipe that I will be making again and again!

Husband used this recipe tonight.  He changed it up a bit by searing the tenderloin in a hot cast iron skillet and basting in the bbq sauce.  He then continued to cook the tenderloin in the cast iron skillet on the grill while also using a smoker box.  While the tenderloin cooked, he added a little olive oil the pan and cooked up some awesome yellow bell pepper slices and sweet onion slices.  Delish!

Simple and comes out pretty good.  I have a different marinated tenderloin that I like better, but that takes time.  If you don't have the time to marinate the meat, I definitely suggest this.

I ended up grilling for 45 minutes instead of 30.  The meat was so soft when I pulled it off the grill, I was convinced that it was still raw on the inside, but I was very happy to find that it was fully cooked without a trace of pink.  Very tender and juicy meat.  The kids loved it too.

This is the only way we make pork tenderloin at my house. Instead of just garlic powder, salt and pepper, try Magic Seasoning. We get it at Kroger.

Wow, I am soooo not a cook nor griller but followed these instructions on my gas grill and they were FABULOUS!  Pork very easily can get dried out but these were so good, my 15 yr old, husband and I wiped them out...so much for serving 6! LOL!

This wasn't too bad. My coals were burning out and it was getting late so I finished it off in the oven.  Very moist, but too peppery for me; and I'm a big fan of pepper too!  If I try this again I'll definately cut back on it. I would give this a 3.5, but I don't know how to give a half star. My first time to post.

Next time I will try the seasoning as directed, but this time I had already marinated my pork tenderloin and was looking for grilling instructions. These were spot on. I set the grill at about 350 degrees with indirect heat as directed. After 30 minutes I was a bit worried that they were looking dry, but I brushed with BBQ sauce, turned over, and brushed the other side and let cook for 15 more minutes as directed. They were perfectly moist! Thanks for sharing this!

This is awesome! Very good. Very juicy. I did as others did and baked it in the oven since it's about 0 degrees out side and just didn't wanna fire up the grill. I will be trying it on the grill in the spring. I will defiantly me making this recipe again.

Thanks to all the previous reviewers who convinced me to try this! And thanks for sharing the reciipe, Cathy.   Very easy and delicious.  And I learned about grilling with indirect heat - a new one for me!  Mine did come out a little too salty but that was my fault as I used more than called for in the recipe as well as using garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  Besides that it was very moist and tasty.  I'll stick to the recipe for my seasonings next time I make this.

This was very good.  Nice to fix something different occassionally.  I baked it in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes.  I was a little concerned about it being done, but it came out perfect moist and tender.  Next time I'm going to try it on the grill.  I gave it a four because I didn't cook it on the grill.

This was great!!!  Normally we only eat tenderloin sliced, breaded and pan fried cause other wise it looks real icky. But I did it this way and it was sooo good.  My dh even liked it and he was leary.  This will be my new favorite way. Thanks

Absolutely delicious. Amazing that something so simple could turn out so well. We had no leftovers at all - everyone gobbled it up.

Great recipe. First time grilling pork tenderloin. My boyfriend doesn't even like barbecue sauce...and yet he cleared his plate and went back for seconds! I think I should maybe lower the heat on the grill (gas) tonight when I grill the other half of the pork tenderloin. I can't believe with just the 2 of us we ate that whole slab of pork! Good thing there was 2 tenderloins in that package! lol

So simple, and so delicious! I was nervous about the pork drying out on the grill, but used the indirect method on the Weber and it was PERFECT. My 11-year-old didn't even request ketchup!

Very good! I have never cooked with indirect heat, but it was so easy. The flavor was excellent, but I think I cooked the meat a little too long. The grill was on high for the first 30 min. so maybe that was too much. Will definately try again with reduced heat and cook time.

This is one of the best tenderloin recipes I have ever tried.  The pork comes out juicy and tender.  I always double the marinade recipe and marinate it overnight, and take it to tailgates.  Everyone always raves about it, and the meat actually tastes better as a leftover (if there is any).  Thanks for sharing!!

The pork was very tender, but it was way too peppery for me.  My husband loved it, but next time, I will only put a half of a teaspoon of pepper in the rub.  I also coated it lightly with olive oil and let it marinate for a few hours in the fridge before grilling.

Yummy and easy. I used seasoning salt and fresh cracked black pepper on two tenderloins. Upped the garlic powder a bit (just eyeballed it so every part was equally coated). Used Kraft original BBQ sauce.

I am not a big pork fan, but my hubby is. Chose this recipe for its simplicity. It stayed juicy and had great flavor! I skipped the bbq sauce, and it stilled turned out great. So simple but it works.

SO good! I broiled it in the oven  and added onion powder and chili powder as well as minced garlic rather than garlic powder and I was floored with how freaking delicious it was. 10/10 would make again.

So easy to make and delicious. I used Honey BBQ from Sweet Baby Rays. Mine was also at 155 after 25 minutes so make sure to check it so it doesn’t dry out. I’ll make this many more times.

Cooked indirect with a little pecan wood chips in the chip box sitting directly on the coals.  No need to put a clock on this.  I removed at 138 degrees internal and let it rest to 142 degrees internal.  Wonderful flavor with the Blackberry/Chipotle BBQ sauce I had on hand.  If you have a Weber grill, almost impossible to not grill like a pro.

A favorite when grilling season comes around.  Adding the sauce near the end ensures the flavor comes through and complements the earlier rub nicely!

I can't believe how good this was!  I followed the directions with a couple of timing changes.  I applied the salt, pepper and garlic powder about 30 min before grilling.  I applied the BBQ sauce (Organic 365) at 15 min and then turned the loin at 30 min and applied more BBQ sauce and voila!  This is the best tasting pork loin I've had and it is also the easiest to make, we will be doing this for company7 next weekend.

This recipe is great!!  Simple, easy and delicious.  I didn’t change anything, and my family loved it.  I love pork tenderloin but my husband is way pickier; it’s always too “porky” tasting ????.  Even he loved this recipe!  In fact we made this numerous times this winter, grilling at -10 F because we enjoyed it so much??

Absolutely the best pork loin I've ever made.  Other than searing it for a minute on each side before cooking it over indirect heat, followed cooking instructions exactly.  Instead of barbeque sauce, used FISCHER & WIESER's Charred Pineapple Bourbon Sauce.  It was amazing!!!

Followed the recipe exactly except I tented the pork for the entire cooking period and added water to the drip pan.  Best pork I’ve ever made!

07.29.17 ~ Pork really doesn't get much easier than this recipe.  I had a large tenderloin in the freezer that I cut in to two pieces. We add the s/p and garlic powder about one hour before grilling.  My husband grilled exactly as directed with the heat and length of time - and it was perfect!  Served this with 'Pineapple- Lime Rice' from AR.  Took this meal to my parents and grilled out there.  Everyone really enjoyed our dinner.

I rubbed it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and let it sit for about 20 minutes before putting it on the grill. I cooked it on a gas grill in an aluminum pan over indirect heat. I prefer to cook low and slow.....about 2 hours. When it was done, I let it rest. It was the most tender, tasty pork roast I have ever had.

I baked in 350 degree oven for 45 min & then turned temp to 325 brushed with BBQ sauce and baked another 15 min. This was too long. Maybe 350 degree for 30 min then brush with sauce then bake at 15 min. Let stand 10 min.

Inside temp should be 145 degrees.

I'm always looking to mix up the weekly menu a little and add something new.  Sometimes, it's a complete train wreck.

With this and some grilled veggies was a complete home run!

My son loves it so much, if there are left overs, he has them the next morning for breakfast. 

The only comment I got was that it was a tad salty. I quickly realized that I was using the ingredients on one, 1 pound tenderloin and not two tenderloins.  

Other than that, we've added this to the rotation and it's always a welcome surprise.

Cooked it on a baking sheet on the grill for 30min and then I put directly on the fire for about 20min. Didn't even need more sauce!

This was easy to make & tasted great.  I'm not the best in the kitchen so the prep time took a little longer but I attribute that to my lack of skills in the kitchen, I try to keep it simple.  Every once in a while I try to surprise the wife & kids with dinner waiting when they come home, I rarely cook.  This was a huge success and even the picky eaters in my house loved it ??????

I have made this on the BBQ and in the oven and even seared it on the stove first and then put in oven.  It turns out great everytime and guests just rave about it.

Made this for dinner last night for 10 people; so simple and delicious.   Juiciest tenderloin we've ever had!  I rubbed it with olive oil, sprinkled liberally with garlic powder, salt and pepper, and let it sit it fridge for about 30 minutes.  I grilled it with just dry ingredients for 20 minutes on indirect heat.  Then placed it directly on flame brushed with bbq sauce, flipping periodically and repeating on each side until it came to temperature.  Served it with grilled pineapple and sweet peppers charred on the grill.  I will always do it this way from now on... SO good!

Very very good! I wanted to cook without heating up the kitchen, and this fit the bill. I put it on the top rack of the BBQ, and made a little tinfoil drip catcher to put underneath. Cooked just as directed, but left out the extra salt. So so tender and yummy. Sadly, there were no leftovers for tomorrow's lunch!

The cooking method was awesome for pork tenderloin -- I never tried that before but will definitely make it that way again.  The combination of the spices with the bbq sauce was a little weird though.  I might try this again without putting bbb sauce on it.

Very good - tender, juicy and tasty.  I followed the directions exactly, including cooking in the BBQ with indirect heat.  Seasoning was perfectly balanced.  The only thing I might do differently next time is to give the meat about 5 or so minutes on direct heat to caramelize the sauce a bit.

Well, it doesn’t get much quicker and easier than this!  I used two large bone-in pork chops, instead of a tenderloin, and scaled back the garlic powder, salt and pepper to half the amount listed.  Hubs grilled the chops  for a total of 10 minutes over relatively high heat and used just enough barbecue sauce  to coat the chops.  This recipe proves that a few simple ingredients can make for a delicious dinner!  I’ll try it on a tenderloin next time!

This is actually my second time making this . . . when my husband says 'You can make this again!' . . . I do! This time I cut back to 1/2 a tsp of pepper . . . hubby not a big fan of pepper.
Love this recipe! Super easy, super delicious!

Easy, easy, easy. I didn't have a lot of time to marinate this, but even after a couple of hours, this turned out flavorful, moist and yummy. Will definitely make this a regular guest at my house.

I used fresh garlic in addition to the other seasonings and it was great. I also did a quick salt/sugar brine before seasoning, I prefer soak loins in a brine before grilling because it seems to keep it more moist and has a better texture. For the BBQ sauce I made my own, brown sugar habanero. I  brushed some on shortly before removing from the grill. To keep this from being over direct heat you put your charcoal on one side of the grill. You place the loin over the coals with the lid shut until it's got a good char, do both sides. Then finishing cooking on the side where there are no coals and shut the lid. Cooking about 5 minutes on each side for a 1lb roast or until 160 degrees inside. Times will vary on how good of a fire you've got going. I hope this helps.

45 minutes on a charcoal grill was perfect! I made a pile of coals on one side of the grill.  I started by putting the tenderloin over the flame for about 3-5 minutes for each of the four sides (about 15 minutes).  I then put the tenderloin just to the side of the flame for ten minutes each side (only the 2 large sides), then for another 5 on each side with the BBQ sauce (I used sweet baby rays).  I let it rest for 10 minutes under foil, while I made butter parmesan noodles and butter and garlic sautéed broccoli.  This was the best tenderloin I have made to date!! Definitely will make this again!!

We used canola oil, salt and pepper.  No barbecue sauce.  Used mesquite wood chips in foil on the grill.  Was tender and delicious!

Oh man, you have GOT to try this! I made 4.5 lbs of pork loin for my family using this recipe and there was almost none left by the end of the night.

Very tender and good flavor, but I would have liked more browning.  Next time turn the grill higher to sear at the end.

Easy, foolproof and tasty!  Don't change any of the spices.  Grill both sides on HIGH for 5 minutes before switching to indirect.

This turned out perfect as written.  Started with the indirect heat but then my gas tank was empty and I had to change it so I finished it off on low heat so we could eat at a reasonable hour!  Not sure how long it would really take on indirect heat since the video indicates a different time than the recipe.

Our whole family loved it. The only complaint was maybe a bit too much pepper. Was just the right amount for me but if you plan on serving this to anyone who may not enjoy even mild spice maybe cut back a bit on the pepper.

Best barbecued tenderloin recipe ever!  My husband begs for this ever time I buy a tenderloin. It's easy, delicious and so Juicy.  I like it because it doesn't need a lot of tending. So it frees you up to work on other meal aspects. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

Delicious.  Grill died so I blackened it a screaming hot cast iron skillet.  Then baked it at 400 for 20 minutes.  LOVED it.

Cooking under indirect heat is good. Bbq sauce was tasty, meat has to be more seasoned. Not as tender as expected.

Simple and delicious. I did add some Adobo seasoning and next time we'll cut down on the cooking time on our gas grill, though the time called for in the recipe was almost exact for us. The meat was very good and so easy to prepare.

This recipe is great!  I fix it about once a month.  Instead of grilling it I put it in the crockpot and shred it.  It makes fantastic "sloppy joe" sandwiches.

One of the best ways to serve pork tenderloin.  I prefer using a BBQ sauce that is on the sweeter side...some sort of honey flavored.  It carmelizes nice with the slow cooking.

I couldn't believe that a recipe this easy would be so good. After reading all the reviews, I had nothing to lose. It was amazing! I've made pork so many different ways and this is by far my favorite. Yum Yum Yum

This is so good and so easy!!  I had my doubts...the recipe had so few ingredients and looked too simple to really be good, but it was!  My family ate every bit and probably would have eaten more!

First time I ever did a pork loin, and it's now a family favorite. I was worried it wasn't cooking, but boy was I wrong. Juicy and tender. Great recipe! I don't like BBQ sauce, so I omitted it, but it was still a super yummy dish!

This was a great tenderloin recipe.  My wife, who is not a fan of pork, thought that this was excellent.  I added some wood chips to the charcoal which gave the meat a great smoky flavor.

We LOVE this recipe. We've had it twice in the last month. Pork tenderloin is expensive here, but it's well worth the money, plus it lasts us for 2 days. This would be great to serve company.

This was so simple and easy. It was great. The whole family loved it. By the way, smoking or cooking pork over indirect heat is the only way to go. Otherwise it gets too dry. Thank you for this recipe.

The recipe is great. I used fresh garlic and a little bit of thyme with the original recipe and it came out very juicy and tasteful.

I have made this a number of times and each time to great reviews.  The pork always comes out tender, and the recipe is so easy!  It's fun to experiment with different barbeque sauces to change the flavours slightly.  Thanks Cathy.

This was the first time I had ever grilled a pork tenderloin or used the indirect heat method.  My husband and I both loved the results.  The pork stayed nice and moist and the taste was great.  This one's a keeper for me.

I followed the recipe and my tenderloin turned out too "peppery".  I think I may have overcooked the tenderloins, because they were a little dry.  Keep an eye on how much seasoning is on the pork, and don't overcook.
