Omigod!  This is DELICIOUS!!!  I used 4 chicken dark meat quarters.  First I sprinkled them with garlic powder and chopped onion powder as well.  I preheated the oven to 350 and used a metal baking tray covered in foil.  I snapped the legs to break the bone so that I could place the chicken flatter and also, so that the spices would permeate the chicken better.  After 45 minutes I took the tray out and removed the foil.  I used chicken scissors to cut thru the skin because I knew that this way the barbeque sauce would penetrate inside the chicken better.  I used about 1 cup of barbeque sauce "Tony Roma's Brand".  After 15 minutes I turned off the oven...but I left the chicken inside for another 5 minutes.  Then I took it out and it tasted marvelous!  It was fall off the bone tender like the other people said.  A very sucussful recipe!  Next time I will line the bottom of the baking tray with a sheet of foil so that I dont have to scrub the tray so much during   
dish washing.  This is an excellent template for just about any baked chicken recipe whether it be barbeque chiken or herb roasted chicken or pretty 
much any baked chicken recipe that does not  
require you to de-bone the chicken.

This was really good! I followed alot of people's advice...I rubbed salt, pepper and garlic powder under the skin of split breasts and baked for 45 minutes. Then I removed the skin, covered in BBQ sauce, and baked for another 15-20 minutes. It was perfect and juicy! Thanks for the recipe and thank you to everybody who reviewed!

Absolutely wonderful!!  This chicken is fantastic!  So moist and flavorful....my kids ask for this often.  It's so easy too.  Also works with boneless chicken breasts (just cut the baking time in half).  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty good.  I used a pyrex baking dish and sprayed it with non-stick spray in anticipation of difficulty in cleaning as reported by a previous review.  I used only chx drumsticks as that's all I had on hand, 6 of them to be exact so maybe less meat than a whole chicken.  I did not scale back on the BBQ sauce as I love sauce!  I just eyeballed it so I think I may have used more like 2 cups......There was actually a good deal of liquid in the dish after 60 min. (I turned the chicken over at 30 min) so I had no problem with clean up.  I poured off most the liquid before brushing with the sauce then continued for another 30 min. as the recipe calls for.  The meat was already pulling back from the bone after the 1st hour so I turned the oven down to 245 degrees for the 30 min. with sauce.  I was afraid it would be too dry but since I was cooking for myself and left overs I went ahead with the recipe's cooking time to test it out.  The meat was juicy and flavorful and not the least bit dry.  I did end up pulling the skin off before eating so I think I'd just do away with it in the beginning next time.  Other than that, I'd happily cook this for a crowd any night!

No snowstorm (thankfully) but we still enjoyed this.  It's pretty basic - as another reviewer pointed out, it'll be exactly as tasty as the sauce you use - but as a cooking method, it works nicely.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, baked them covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for another 15.  Also, I messed up and added the barbecue sauce in the beginning; it still turned out okay, but next time I'd like to try it as written, and see how it turns out.  I used pre-made grilled chicken seasoning, garlic powder and a little cayenne, as well as salt and pepper, to flavor the chicken.  On a side note:  nonstick aluminum foil is the best invention since slow-cooker liners.  Seriously.  Buy it.

I've made this 2 times in 5 days.  My husband actually "requested" this for dinner tonight and I was amazed.  He loved it and said it was the best BBQ chicken he has ever had...although he isn't a picky eater, his least favorite food is BBQ, but not anymore!!  So simple too, I used a whole chicken the first time and the second time I cut it directly in half down the breast bone and found it cooked better and more flavorful the second time, but I attribute that to the wonderful Easy BBQ sauce I found here by Debi K....it was AWESOME.  Can't ask for an easier meal and if you use foil in the pan, it makes really easy clean up too!!  Thanks for making my dinner menus more diverse!

I have four picky eaters. Three of them loved this chicken the last one thought it was okay. Since I liked it too and am the cook, she's going to be eating it again.   Super simple to make. I took the advice of others and lined my pan with foil. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I cleaned and then pounded flat. I seasoned both sides with sea salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. I cooked it at 400F for 10 minutes, pulled it out, coated it with BBQ sauce, put it in for another 10, pulled it out, flipped them over, covered the other side with BBQ sauce, and gave them 8 more minutes in the oven. They were super tender and had lots of flavor.

This is just a good recipe for taste- but a great recipe for ease and effort. I served with Baked French Fries I, and it was just what was needed for a busy mom on a weeknight. I used legs and thighs - followed others suggestions - took skin off at 1 hour and basted BBQ every 10 min for 30 min. Lined with foil for easy clean up. Thanks.

I used a cut up whole chicken and was NOT impressed for some reason.  I followed the recipe exactly. It was just kind of bland...especially inside the chicken. The chicken did NOT fall off the bone with tenderness like I was hoping. I won't make again. There are much better BBQ chicken recipes out there. Sorry!

I used four skinless, boneless chicken breasts and cooked them covered for 30 minutes and then uncovered them and cooked them for another 15 minutes.  Prior to cooking them, I seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt and pepper.  They were very good and so much easier than putting them on the outside BBQ grill.

I often make chicken this way however I grease the baking pan with margarine and season both sides of chicken with ground black pepper, paprika, and salt and place in baking pan spread margarine with fingers on chicken. I then glaze chicken skin with honey. I chop up some onions and green peppers into rings and spread them over the chicken. I then cover the pan with tin foil and bake it for about 45 minutes. I then uncover the chicken and pour my favorite barbecue sauce and bake it for 15 to 20 more minutes. Do not recover chicken with tin foil.

Well, Julie, we did enjoy BBQ chicken, "even in a snow storm."  We had 10 inches yesterday and the chicken was marvelous!  I would suggest spraying the baking dish with non-stick spray prior to baking.

I used this recipe as a base to create something great! I'm not a huge fan of dark meat but was worried about making BBQ chicken with boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and minced onion flakes.  I arranged the breasts in a glass dish and put pats of butter around them to keep them from drying out.  I baked them covered for 30 minutes.  Removed the aluminum foil and covered with bbq sauce.  I cooked for another 20 minutes.  Chicken turns out moist and delicious.

Easy and good!  I have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I use boneless skinless chicken breasts and bake covered at 350* for 30 min., add sauce and bake an additional 15min. uncovered.  Served with baked potatoes and spinach salad.

I made this with 3lbs of skinless, boneless chicken breast, 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp of onion powder, and a little black pepper.  Cover and bake for 20 minutes at 400, brush on 1/2 cup of bbq sauce and return to oven for 10 minutes uncovered, brush remaining 1/2 of bbq sauce over top and return to oven for 10-15 minutes until chicken is done.   Normally, I don't like chicken done this way because the outside is the only flavorful part, but the onion and garlic powders helped to flavor all of the meat so even the inside was flavorful and moist.

This is excellent if you're looking for a quick, easy, and family-friendly baked chicken dish.  We like the thin sliced bone/skinless breasts.  I lined the baking dish (seriously, a genius idea) and sprinkled season salt, garlic powder, and pepper liberally on the chicken.  Covered and baked for 30m.  Uncovered and basted with the sauce for 15 min.  Broiled for a few minutes more just to kind of glaze it up.  The husband and kids cleaned their plates.  It was perfect and hearty with some rice and a veggie side.  Thanks so much for posting this!

Prepared BBQ sauce is prepared bbq sauce.  These are ok but mine are better.  I'll clue you into one of my secrets though.  Brine the chicken in 1 gallon of water with 1/2 cup of salt and about 4 oz of bbq sauce (adjust to how much chicken you're baking) for 4-6 hours and you'll get the flavor in every bite of the chicken and it will also be so moist you won't believe it.

5 stars for ease of preparation and really yummy results.  I used drumsticks and Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  Be sure to season the meat with a bit of salt and pepper, in addition to generous amounts of garlic powder (the garlic powder really works wonders in this recipe!).  Finger licking good, I'll definitely add this to my go-to recipe file.

Really more of a technique than a recipe this is still EXCELLENT.  it is one of those "why didn't I think of that" ideas.  I season chicken first and place in baking dish skin side up.  Afterr baking covered for one hour drain fat brush with sauce liberally as called for.  I then set the oven  to convection bake for remaining thirty minutes uncovered.  This crisps up the skin and puts a faux grill-char on the chicken.  Great Recipe!

A delicious and easy recipe. To give the chicken some zazz, I rubbed liberal amounts of seasoning salt, garlic salt and pepper under the skin, before baking. The second time I made this, I forgot to cover it and panicked when I realized it. Not to worry, the chicken was just as moist as the first time. I believe the key is to leave the skin on as some other reviewers said. I removed the skin, then doused it with bbq sauce for the last 30 minutes. I added more sauce for the last 10 minutes of baking. To keep chicken from sticking, pour a touch of olive oil to a paper towel, then rub the towel onto the aluminum foil. This is a great help for the torture, also known as cleaning up. Will definitely make again in the cooler months when I can stand having the oven on. Thanks for the recipe.

Thank You JULIE! This is a great cooking technique to make perfectly moist & juicy Bone- in chicken! Make sure to do the following:  Season the chicken under the skin liberally, and bake covered for an hr in a 350 oven, pull out, pour out juice, remove the skin, and apply your Sauce (make sure it’s a sauce you love) and bake uncovered for another 30 minutes. I was very pleased with the results!  I took the advice from other chefs about lining the dish!  It made clean up a snap!  I will def. try this again with different herbs and sauces!

Excellent recipe!!  Easy and very good.  Whoever said to line the pan with foil is a GENIUS!  Cleanup was a snap.  Will definitely make this again, and again, and again. . .

We grew up eating this. It is easy and simple enough to make after a long day at work. A working parent's dream recipe. Kraft BBQ Sauce works great for this. NOTE: I put a dry rub on the chicken before brushing with sauce. My dry rub includes onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, black pepper, pinch of cayenne pepper, dry mustard, sage. You could also just use season salt or cajun spice.

I used bone-in chicken breasts which only required 45 min. (covered) baking time plus an additional 15 min. (uncovered) with the barbeque sauce.  I would recommend adding additional seasoning for the initial baking...at the very minimum it needs salt and pepper.  The recipe is simple to prepare and turned out very moist.

I sprinkled on onion powder and garlic powder while baking. That smell from the kitchen alone was wonderful. And then when I added the sauce, there was another wonderful smell, I made a cheese sauce and served it over steamed broccoli, and homeade garlic bread. WOW! Thanks!

This was simple and delicious. I used some garlic salt too. I used boneless skinless breasts and browned them in a skillet in a little olive oil first then baked them adding the barbecue sauce after twenty minutes as directed.

I followed the recipe exactly, using drumsticks, and I only added some salt while I was sprinkling the garlic powder, and then I used Sweet Baby Ray's bottled BBQ sauce. This recipe is awesome! This is exactly how I always wanted my BBQ chicken to turn out, and it never did. Until now. So delicious! Thank you for sharing this one, it's a definite keeper for sure!

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I rubbed them with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. I then followed the recipe minus the times and it came out wonderful!

Very good and versatile recipe. To my BBQ sauce (I used Hunt's), I added Dale's Seasoning (soy sauce based liquid marinade) to make it salty and smoky, Worcestershire sauce to bring out the tangy BBQ sauce, onion and garlic powder, and  of course salt, pepper, and a dash of sugar. Cook chicken, covered, with about 1/4 c of the sauce.  Drained chicken juices.  Shredded the chicken (it was so moist) and poured the rest of the sauce over it.  Cooked the rest for about 5 minutes.

We use boneless skinless chicken in this recipe and I love that it uses what you'd probably have on hand anyway and is SO simple to make.  Keeps the chicken moist even here in Colorado!

Okay folks, this is a pretty basic recipe and it does taste good, but only as good as the sauce you put on it. It is moist because it essentially steams that first hour before the sauce. It is good, but again, just chicken with sauce poured on it.

Hands down the yummiest bbq chicken I've ever made.  I rubbed the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and put in oil coated baking dish.  After an hour I pulled back the skin off the chicken, slathered the meat with my favorite jarred sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's), and let it cook for another 20 minutes.  I had the baking dish covered the entire cook time.  The dark meat was falling off the bone, but the breasts were a little dry.  I think I will pull them out sooner next time.  I put some baked potatoes in the oven along side the meat and served with corn on the cob.  YUM!

I used chicken breasts and baked them for the initial 1 hour then for an extra 20 minutes(instead of 30). The chicken was not dry at all--a problem I always seem to have with chicken.

Very good I used boneless chicken. I cooked it covered 40 minutes, uncovered thirty minutes. It was very tender and moist. Your sauce will make the chicken, I used a raspberry chipolte sauce mixed with hunts original, it was awesome.

Garlic powder and bbq sauce-cant get any easier than that! It was very tasty. I used my fav. bbq sauce from this site 'Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce' and it was great. I liked the cooking method too. =) I'll use this method again. Comment: Being that this only requires bbq sauce and garlic powder, you must use a good bbq sauce. If it comes out bland then thats your fault...or your bbq sauces fault ;)

Easy and delicious! Use a good flavorful BBQ sauce. I like Austin's Own (find it at HEB) because it tastes really good and it's not too hot if you're serving kids. You can prepare the night before and just pop into the oven when you're ready! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great basic recipe, but like many I modified quite a bit.
I seasoned my drumsticks and thighs with salt and pepper, then with garlic salt, garlic powder, lawrys a dash of cayenned pepper and then sprinkle of brown sugar.  I let this sit in the fridge for a few hours.  I cook it covered for 45min-hour, just depending on my schedule.  Then take it out uncover and brush on a little bbq sauce.  I like a sweet & spicy mix.  Turn on the broil and put back in over for 10-15 min.  Take out and flip chicken over and repeat with bbq sauce and put back in oven on broil for 10-15 min.  Comes out amazing!  My kids love it and so does my husband.  It's been a frequent request as of lately.  Somehow all the flavors just really work well together...

Awesome chicken recipe! We don't have a grill, and I'm always so jealous in the summer of the delicious grill smells. So, I use this recipe, but with 2 small changes. 1: I give the meat a good sprinkling of coarse seasoned sea salt before it goes in the oven. 2: After I pour the bbq sauce over the baked chicken I broil it for 4-5 minutes per side. It comes out dark, crispy and just as good as on a grill. I make this at least once a week with cheap cuts of chicken, like thighs. Usually I only serve a veggie with it, no starch. Best budget family recipe ever.

This recipe was easy. I used chicken thighs that were bone-in and had the skin on. So the last 30 minutes I cooked the chicken at 400 to carmelize the sauce and then broiled on high for 15 minutes to get the skin to crisp. Kid tested and husband approveds.

Fall apart tender as promised! Before adding the barbecue sauce I did add salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper, but I'm sure it would have been delicious without the additional spices.

Very good...Here is how I customized it...I used (4) thighs (2 lbs.), removed the skin, brushed with olive oil, placed in a foil lined pan, then sprinkled a mixture of Garlic, onion powder, rosemary, Salt & pepper. Covered with foil, cooked @ 350 for 1 hr. then removed juices, and brushed with a Tomato based (Montgomery Inn) BBQ sauce and cooked uncovered for another 1/2 hour.   Came out Great. thanks for the initial idea...and I am sure this would be a great start for any type of Chicken or pork you like.

Tastes like the best ribs you've ever had, minus the heavy duty fat content.   I followed the recipe exactly, with two  exceptions:  I basted with  the juice of one lemon before I added the barbecue sauce.  Took one reviewer's advice, added peeled potatoes/halved,  to the pan, with the  barbecue sauce.  (All the fat was removed  before the sauce was added.)  Definitely a recipe for company ; extremely easy to prepare for a crowd.  The pieces did not disintegrate but held their form.  The meat was  juicy and tender.

This was such an easy recipe that I felt guilty serving it to company.  Instead of garlic powder I substituted a home made rub and used the .59 cent a pound chicken leg quarters.  And the final taste definitely depends on the prepared sauce used. The end result was tender, juicy chicken that melted off the bone.

This was just OK for me.  The skin was very rubbery and turned me off.  I prefer grilled BBQ to crisp the skin up.

I used this recipe more for the cooking instruction.  I seasoned the chicken up a little more than recommended before placing in the oven and it came out great.

Nothing special to this recipe, but it's great for an easy meal when you can't fire up the grill.  Made it with boneless breasts and Head Country BBQ sauce and it was great.  Cooked the breasts covered for approx. 40 minutes, and then uncovered 20 more and it was very juicy and delicious.

Man...my family won't stop talking about this recipe, if they only knew how EASY it was!!  The only changes I made was to ad garlic powder, lemon pepper and paprika.  I also mixed babreque sauce with a thick steak sauce (i know it sounds strange, but it is part of my dad's secret recipe for barbeque sauce and sooooo tasty)  Thanks for a GREAT easy recipe:)

thank you julie.  i loved it and more importantly so did my family.  the garlic tasted sooo good with it.  i used Hunt's Honey Mustard BBQ sauce.  and i did this recipe with a whole chicken not cut up peices.  it turned out sooo moist.  and yes...it goes very well with corn and rice.

This turned out good.  It's a very basic, easy recipe and inexpensive to make.  I didn't drain the juices (seemed like a lot of effort for no real reason) and I used Jack Daniels Original Number 7 Grilling Sauce.

I've been making BBQ chicken like this for years.  This is a favorite recipe that is also super easy.  Sweet Baby Ray's sauce is one of our favorite BBQ sauces for this.  But you could use almost any prepared sauce (or your own) and this recipe would turn out great.

I found this recipe a while back & use it all the time . Well, at least the method. As written, the recipe is a bit bland, but the method is spot on. I have changed the recipe quite a bit. I start by marinating bone in, skin on chicken parts with a mixture of  Paul Prudhomme's  BBQ seasoning, chopped garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar & a dash of liquid smoke. Let that sit for a couple of hours up to overnight in the fridge. Cover & cook as directed & finish with KC Masterpiece sauce. I also crank the broiler at the very end to get a little more char. Yum. Making some right now:)

I haven't prepared baked barbecue chicken in a while because it never turns out very good...usually too dry and not very flavorful.  I was very pleased with the results I got from this recipe.  I cooked skinless chicken breasts, sprinkled with garlic powder, salt, pepper and A1 Dry Rub (sweet mesquite bbq flavor).  I baked covered for 35 minutes and after draining the liquid off and adding my favorite sauce, I put on bake/broil for 15 minutes uncovered.  It turned out delicious...very moist and flavorful! I also soaked the chicken breasts in salt water for a few hours prior to baking them.  I always do this because it adds to the flavor and always seems to cook better.  I will definitely be cooking this on a regular basis!  Thanks for sharing!

I've been a vegetarian for almost 22 years and in the last month have added sustainable, grass fed meat back into my diet for a number of reasons.  
So this is literally the first time I've ever baked a chicken!
I did it about like I would have done baked tofu using this as a guide:
Instead of plain garlic sprinkled some garlic-lemon seasoning all over it, cut up some onions and garlic and basted both sides of the breasts with Bragg's (you could also use soy sauce).
I followed the directions otherwise and poured a local/organic BBQ sauce over it, adding some honey to thicken it.  The salt in the Bragg's makes additional salt unnecessary and the flavor is excellent.
Served it over brown rice with veggies.  
Very good, thanks!

Good and easy. I used two skinless boneless chicken breasts so I cut down the time and bbq sauce accordingly. Very easy and the chicken wasn't dry.

This recipe is great and super easy. I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of seasoning on the Chicken. I added salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder to both sides of the chicken and that did the trick! I also used Kraft Chipotle Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce and it made the Chicken perfect!

"Wow" were the words that came out of my boyfriend and I's mouth when we took a bite out of our chicken legs. This recipe rocked!!!! We will be using this recipe again! And... I recommend using Drumsticks like we did! Juicy and amazing flavor! ( I also used: Garlic Salt, Paprika and McCormicks BBQ Seasoning in place of just Garlic Powder)

Awesome recipe!!! I used chicken thighs and drumsticks. I first baked the chicken (skin on seasoned with salt, paper and garlic salt) for about an hr. I then drained the excess fat and took off the skin. I then topped the chicken off with a bottle of Jack Daniels bbq sauce. Served with rice and veggies! Yummy recipe and easy! Can't wait to make it again

This turned out delicious and moist and beats the more time consuming methods for "fix it and forget it" dinners! Made the Roasted New Red Potatoes to accompany and steamed fresh broccoli alongside for a weight watchers friendly dinner. Thanks for sharing - this will be a regular in this working Mom's rotation!

Very good.  You can use any type of bbq sauce to change up the flavors from one chicken day to the next.  Sweet and spicy, honey and just regular all work good.

Very juicy chicken. I made this for myself since the little lady is in Fla visiting relatives. I used 6 Drumsticks. I added Onion Powder and Smoked Spanish Paprika with Black Pepper to the Garlic powder. Gave it a smoky bold flavor.Had it with a leafy green salad with Blue Cheese Dressing. The tang of the BBQ sauce and BC dressing was great.There were no leftovers. Will make it again.

This was GREAT! I used thighs that I removed the skin from, and aside from also seasoning them w/ salt and pepper, I followed the directions exactly. They turned out perfectly moist, tender and flavorful! This is a great way to get bbq in the winter, and I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I liberally rubbed salt, pepper and garlic inside and outside the skin.  I think this is a great technique (foil an hour, sauce, bake 30 min) for cooking bbq chicken.  An hour uncovered usually leaves it dry and this was nice and moist.

OH YUM... I took the advice of others and removed the skin after 50 min @ 350*. (next time I'll remove the skin before baking & see if it makes a difference) REMEMBER to drain grease off. Use a bar-be-que sauce that you like! The 30 minutes baking AFTER the sauce is on is what makes it 'stick' to the chicken. DH told me several times how good it was.

I've been making bbqed chicken this way for years and boost the flavor by drizzling molasses over the chicken after the bbq sauce step. I also use boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

Very good!  I took the advice of another reviewer and baked the chicken thoroughly on each side.  The first side cooked 20 minutes and the second side about 10 minutes.  I used the same method after I added the barbeque sauce but only cooked each side about 7 minutes each.  The chicken was very tender.  The family really enjoyed it!

Love the cooking method, but we miss the crisp skin you get from barbequed chicken.  SO I think next time, and there will be a next time, I will take it out of the oven after 1 hour and baste it with sauce and then put it on low on the gas grill. That should do it for a crisp skin.

This was soooo yummy! There were no left overs and I made two packs of chicken legs! I added some salt and pepper as well and topped it with some onions. Baked it at the time and temp suggested and the meat was very tender. Try it with sweet baby rays sauce and I guarantee you won't be disappointed! Easy, simple, delicious! No special ingredients!!!!Thanks for my new way to make BBQ Chix!

Followed the recipe exactly and it yielded very moist and delicious chicken.  So good in fact, that my husband (who is not a chicken fan) gave his approval for this recipe to be added into our dinner rotation!  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was just ok, considering the skin was left on and it should have been removed. It had a good flavor, but I'm sure it would have been much better if I had removed the skin. Remember to remove the skin!!

This was so delicious! I used boneless skinless chicken breast and sprinkled them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and mccormick barbeque seasoning. Baked them for 30 minutes pulled them out and poured the barbeque sauce mixed with 1/4 cup pineapple juice. then topped each breast with a pineapple slice and baked for an additional 30 minutes. wonderful!

Who knew adding garlic powder could make such a difference to baked BBQ chicken? This was so moist and so good. I also added some salt & pepper. Can't wait to make again.

Delicious and easy!  I've made it twice now and I agree with the baking it for an hour, draining it, removing the skin and then adding your favorite bqq sauce.

I gave it 5 stars because anyone who can come up with a new and tasty recipe for chicken deserves it.  However I did make some of my own changes thanks to ratings from other members.  I did line the bottom of my pan so it would be an easy clean up. Also added the garlic powder beneath the skin and on top of it along with some pepper.  Then knowing that would certainly not be enough seasoning ..trust me on this one...I added some "Louisiana Cajun Hot seasoning Blend", not too much because I really don't like spicy foods.  Make sure you do cover it with the foil paper!  That is the trick to the meat falling off the bone and certainly last but not least...some really good B-B-Q sauce. That makes the whole dish!  Best chicken I ever had...besides actually grilling it on the BBQ. I did cook it a tad bit longer than mentioned due to poking a knife between the thigh and leg and juices did have some blood in it.  Let it run clear and then you know it is done.  But it was so moist!!  Thanks for sharing.

Yea, so my hubby wanted BBQ chicken for dinner, and it is leterally 2 degrees outside, and you know he isn't gonna go out there, so when i came across this, I figured I would give it a try. Well, let me tell you, this was so easy, and the chicken turned out soooooo incredibly moist, I think I will use this recipe even when it is BBQ season. This was AWESOME!! Hubby even commented on how he loved it, and wants me to make it this way more often. I almost forgot...my family is not big on the bones, so I used boneless chicken breast, and halved the cooking time

I think this technique rates 5 stars - my chicken comes out moist, tender and tasty.  The key is to follow the directions- keep the chicken covered with foil during the "dry cooking" stage.  For taste do rub it with garlic, poultry seasoning, pepper and/or whatever else you have on hand and don't forget to shove some seasoning under the skin. Tonight I had no bbq sauce so I heated some honey, mustard, soy and a little ketchup and used this instead and it came out better than ever.

Tasty! This is a great recipe! I also sprinkled the chicken with salt and pepper before baking. My whole family enjoyed the chicken. I served it with mashed potatos, dressing, and garlic brocli spears. (another good AR recipe)

Very easy to make. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and seasoned the chicken first with a BBQ mixture of sugar, salt, ground black pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder (you can get the exact measurements from the Texas Pork Ribs recipe). I let it marinate in the fridge for a few hours and then I baked it at 350. For the last 8 minutes, I put it in the broiler to get crispy and brown. Perfecto!

I modified the recipe a little. I used a salt and brown sugar brine for 4 hours first. Also used the broiler for the last 10 mins so the chicken would be crispy. Turned out great even the picky eating children loved it. I will be making this one again and again.

so great. i thought you were joking when you said the meat was falling off the bones, but the chicken was just so tender. i just made it for my girlfriend and i, and we loved it, simple and excellent. i added some brown rice and some broccoli as sides dishes and a semi-sweet white wine, went great with the barbecue sauce.

I have been doing this for years on those nights when there is no time to cook. One difference now is that I usually just buy boneless skinless chicken breasts and I may use a few other seasonings. I also don't use a baking dish and drain the fat; I use a roaster pan with a rack, line the bottom of the rack with foil and all of the fat drips to the bottom. With the breasts there really isn't that much fat. Thank you.

This is one of the best chicken recipes for the amount of time you put into it.  The meat is incredibly tender.  Next time I will remove the skin before adding the BBQ sauce since the skin was mainly soft and greasy (not crispy).

Use a whole chicken, but cut out the backbone using either kitchen shears or a good knife (Be careful!).
Press down on the breast with the skin side up to flaten the bird. Tuck under or cut off the tip of the wings. Sprinkle both sides of the bird with your favorite "Rub" or just use salt, pepper, garlic powder, etc. Bake as described in the original recipe. Add barbecue sauce for the last 30 minutes. I recommend using a meat thermometer to make sure trhe chicken is done.  (A thermometer placed in the thickest part should read 180 degrees). I hope you like  it this way, too!

Very easy to make and delicious! I removed the skin before I put the bbq sauce on and had great results. Will definitely make this again.

Such an easy recipe!!  I put diced garlic under the pieces and sprinkled garlic powder on top.  Only change I will make next time is to either use boneless chicken breasts or cut the larger pieces of chicken into halves or thirds so that the bbq taste will penetrate more.  Perhaps slashing the chicken pieces will allow the taste to penetrate, also.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

As easy as this recipe was, I was surprised it turned out to be delicious!  I loosened the skin on 
the chicken parts and rubbed the garlic powder under the skin for more flavor, then 
poured a good barbecue sauce, like KC Masterpiece over it during the last 1/2 hour.
My husband and I really enjoyed it and it will be a favorite for those nights  we 
don't feel like putting a lot of effort into dinner.

This recipe's great!  It was easy and the result was absolutely mouthwatering!  I varied this recipe somewhat and it turned out well:

1.  I used chicken legs (drumstick + thigh) for this recipe instead of the whole chicken.

2.  I marinated the legs in my favorite barbeque sauce for about 6 hours instead of adding it at the end.

3.  I didn't drain the juices as the recipe suggested; instead I basted the legs every 7-10 minutes during that last half hour of uncovered baking.

I made this last night for dinner and it came out so well. Nice and tender without a single dry piece of meat. I baked my chicken in a glass dish with foil for the cover and cooker for 1hr15min instead. Also used, oregano, basil and garlic parsley salt instead of just garlic powder. Plus I used a BBQ sauce with added honey on top of the chicken and it made it so sweet. Perf the way I did it...

This is how I make my barbecue chicken in the oven. Turns out so much more tender this way. I do this for my ribs too. Sooo tender!
I used to boil my ribs first but they were so tuff. baking it is much better!

I don't think this would not be something I would make again.  Like another reviewer appropriately stated... "this is steamed chicken with sauce" and to me it tasted just like that.  The recipe gets some points from me though because it was so easy to make and the chicken turned out very moist.

Love this recipe! So simple and the chicken is moist and tender. I used all chicken thighs and a BBQ recipe I got from this site ...just do a search for... Bob's BBQ Sauce. The only thing I did different was add about 2 TBSP low salt chicken broth to the bottom of the pan before placing the thighs in the pan. This is definitely a keeper!

This was good.  Makes for a quick, easy, and tasty dinner.  I used boneless chicken breast--simply cut baking time in half and lower the heat a little, if desired.

I seasoned the chicken and then poured the BBQ sauce over the chicken and baked without doing the first bake with no sauce.  This is great!  Just your basic BBQ chicken!

5 stars because the recipe is super easy, and my family asks for this meal on a weekly basis.  My husband and boys love this and I used chicken breasts seasoned with the garlic powder and chili powder.  My family likes a little bit of "kick" w/bbq.  Meal was great w/oven roasted garlic fries  and pink lemonade.

Really yummy! Followed recipe almost exactly, the only thing I added was brown sugar. I rubbed a small handful over the chicken along with the garlic powder. It added a little sweetness ! Chicken was cooked perfect with the suggested cooking time.

This was pretty darn good.  We forgot to drain the fat but it was still delicious and the chicken was super tender.

Very easy and always turns out tender. I've used the same method to cook chicken with a variety of sauces.

Delicious!  I used boneless chicken breast (baked covered for 50 minutes, added sauce then covered another 30 minutes), shrdded them when finished and we had bar-be-que chicken sandwiches!  My three boys and husband loved them!

In the winter time I still get hungry for bbq chicken. I think this way is great, it dosen't get to tender where it'll fall off the bone, this way is just right.

This was really good and easy.  I used chicken breasts with lots of garlic and herb seasoning and Famous Daves sweet and zesty bbq sauce.  my kids loved it! It only needed about 1/2 the cooking time.

Outstanding in flavor and in just the ease in making it.  I used only chicken legs because the store had them on sale for 1/2 off.  I baked for 45 minutes covered instead of 1 hour.  I used a honey BBQ sauce and they turned out delicious.  This will be my go to recipe when I don't have time to make dinner.  I'm going to serve it with pasta and a salad.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

I usually bake my chicken this way and it always falls off of the bone, but I never thought to pour off the fat and pour BBQ sauce on it uncovered.  The chicken was so moist, even the white meat. I used Kraft BBQ sauce and doctored it up a little.  Loved it!

Thank You for this lovely recipe! It's easy to make and very tasty. I use chicken breasts when making it and took the advice of another member and cut the cooking time in half! It's great and we all love it!

I found this to be bland for BBQ chicken.  I've tried making this with the skin and without the skin, and even taking the skin off partway through and still found it to be bland.  I really think that the chicken needs be marinated for a couple of hours BEFORE cooking.  I think the cooking time can also be cut down by 15 minutes.  This recipe still has good flavor if you don't have the time to marinate but if you do I highly recommend it first.

FOR ALL OF YOU COMPLAINING ON THE CLEAN UP . USE RELEASE (  ALUMNIUM FOIL ) . JUST WRAP COOKING DISH , INSIDE , WITH RELEASE , THROW OUT WHEN FINISHED , OR USE TO WRAP LEFTOVER CHICKEN IN TO REFRIGERATE . NO CLEAN UP AT ALL .I USE RELEASE FOR EVERYTHING . GREAT WHEN BAKING COOKIES . ONE SHEET WILL LAST THROUGH A FULL RECIPE ( NO NEED TO CHANGE EACH TIME . ) RELEASE , YOU DO NOT DO ANYTHING TO ( GREASE UP ) . HOPE THIS HELPS.. IT SHOULD !!

Came out quite delicious, even considering I took off all the skin beforehand. Next time I think I will do what the others suggested and put some BBQ sauce under the skin, then take it off completely before serving to make sure it's as moist as possible. I marinated the chicken with the garlic powder and worcheshire sauce before baking. Overall, I was very satisfied with the flavor and texture. I served this with mashed sweet potatoes.

I baked the chicken with the skin on for an hour, then removed it before adding the bbq sauce and baking for the last 30 min.  It was great.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  My husband doesn't care for bbq chicken but he loves this recipe.  This is a keeper!

I made this recipe for 30 people. It was easy and great. I sprinkled a bar-b-que rub on the chicken inseatd of garlic powder and I added some charcoal spice too. I used a doctored Tony Roma's Carolina Honey BBQ sauce (I doctored it adding some lite beer and coke). 
I will definately make this again. It got rave reviews and was so easy.

The chicken wasn't very tender.  It was missing the smoky flavor of real Bar-B-Que as well.  It was just ok; I wouldn't make it again.

This was a quick and easy way to cook chicken.. just pop it in the oven and then put some bbq sauce on. I used Bulls eye. It was good.. just next time, I would maybe poke holes or something in the chicken so you could taste more of the bbq sauce. Over all, a great recipe. Thanks!

Overall it was good but I think I overcooked the chicken as it was a bit dry. An easy recipe that I will definitely try again. Thanks for sharing.

This is how we make BBQ chicken every time.  
The only thing we do differently is adding salt and pepper when we sprinkle on the garlic.  
This recipe is especially great when you want to make up a big batch of chicken legs, which my kids absolutely love.  We often use more than one kind of BBQ sauce within a batch, so we can have a variety of tastes cooked at once.  
This is a reliable, versatile cooking method that works perfectly every time for us.  
Yum!

So easy and so good although would depend on how well you like the BBQ sauce you use. I used Stubb's original and loved it. I only had two large thighs  so used proportionally less seasoning and sauce. I used a generous amount of garlic powder plus a little salt and MSG which I made sure to sprinkle on all sides of the chicken. I baked covered for only 30 minutes, removed, coated all sides of the chicken with BBQ sauce and baked uncovered for 30 more minutes. One hour total baking time was  long enough for two thighs in a Pyrex 8x8 dish. The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful. Really loved the simplicity and the results, thanks!!

The length of time cooked made the chicken almost unbearably dry. The flavors were decent, but it hardly makes up for having to choke it down.
I use a simple recipe for baking chicken. In this case, I would say change temp and time. 
Preheat to 400 degrees. Bake covered 20 mins, remove, coat with sauce, then bake uncovered 20 mins.

Used a whole chicken ant cut up, season with seasoning salt, garlic powder and ground black pepper.  Season the bottom side then the top (skin side up) and bake at (skin side up) 350 covered with foil bottom rack for 45 mins.  Drain fat from dish, uncover and coat (skin side up) with barbecue sauce and cook for another 30 mins at 350.

BBQ sauce: 3/4 Stubbs original, 1/4 KC Masterpiece, couple spoons of apricot preserves, 1/2 spoon of garlic, chopped and diced white onion (1 slice), couple squirts kethcup-Delicious!

Awesome easy recipe.  I took some advice from other reviewers and added garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I also used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and cooked a little over half the amount of time (because they were not completely defrosted).  Used Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce but may try homemade next time and there will be a next time!

I'm glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews. I loved that it only required three ingredients. It was very simple, and a hit with my little ones. The chicken was moist and very flavorful! I think it works best with any chicken. I used boneless skinless thighs, and a separate pan of chicken tenders with the same seasonings. They both turned out delicious! Thanks for such a great, family friendly recipe.

I spatchcocked my chicken, which I do all the time now, as well as turkey. Your fowl cooks evenly so that the breast is done as the same time as the legs - hard to do when whole. Instead of of the garlic powder I liberally used salt and fresh ground black pepper.

This is a nice and simple way to prepare very good baked chicken.  The chicken was moist and pretty much fool-proof.  I used a molasses based bbq sauce giving the chicken the dark appearance.

The instructions in terms of baking times and methods are great!  But I certainly seasoned the chicken well before applying the barbeque sauce.  I used onion powder, oregano, seasoned salt, fresh ground black pepper, a pinch of cumin and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Then I basted it with barbecue sauce at the appropriate time (Sweet Baby Ray's).  Tender and delicious!

I'd had something similar yesterday and wanted to try and replicate it-this was it. The chicken stays incredibly moist with this method. I did salt and pepper it first. I kept the cover on after the bbq sauce went on for about 15 minutes, then uncovered. I broiled it for about 2 minutes but may try longer next time to get the burnt marks of a grill.

I've always knew how to make barbecue chicken, but everytime I made I figured it was something I was missing . So I looked up this recipe an it's awesome. What was funny to me that when I was about to take the chicken out after 1 hour to remove cover & drain the fat to put the barbecue sauce on... Low and behold I had no barbecue sauce...wth So I went to my creative mode made homemade barbecue sauce from scratch, w/ ketchup, worchester sauce, honey , apple cider vinegar & little hot sauce... came out perfect & it didn't taste Ketchupy at all.

This was simply awesome. The chicken was tender and flavorful and the bbq was cooked on for just long enough to get browned. Yummy with baked french fries I and an ear of corn from the freezer. Thanks for sharing!

The bar-be-que flavor does not penetrate into the chicken. Taste was very bland even though chicken was sprinkled w/salt, pepper, and barbecue seasonings before baking. Pretty much tasted like boiled chicken with bar-b-q sauce on the top. Will not be making this again, sorry

This was so easy and good! I took the skin off of chicken thighs, sprinkled with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Then I put them in for 45 min, added the bbq and put in another 15 and it was great. Thank you for sharing :)

Not really a recipe, it would have been much better if you just dumped the bbq sauce on at the beginning and baked uncovered for 1 hour 20 min. Skip the garlic powder and add salt! Came out much too soggy and not at all bbq-ish.

I am giving this 4 stars because my sons and husband liked them.  I thought they were just okay.  I used bonesless, skinless chicken breasts.  It wasn't bad, just not my favorite.

My husband scoffed at the idea of making bbq chicken in the oven - especially such a simple recipe. He was pleasantly surprised at how they turned out. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast. Next time I will pound the breast so it's flatter and cooks more evenly.

Wonderful! Per other reviews, we pulled off the skin at one hour and put barbecue sauce directly on the chicken for the last 1/2 hour. We will continue to do our barbecue chicken this way! Thanks!

I've been trying to come up with nutritious ideas for my 1st grader's lunch. I saw this recipe and decided to try it. I cooked 4 drumsticks and used the same cooking times and just eye-balled the sauce. They came out delicious! I'm going to get a whole chicken and make it for dinner later this week.

A great way to make BBQ chicken inside.  I did forget to cover it for the first hour so it wasn't fall off the bone delicious, but it still turned out really good. Thanks for the recipe.

SOOO GOOOD! I only had drumsticks so this is what I used.  I ran out of garlic powder, so I added a bbq rub that I once bought and some latin adobo,, just a little and some lemon ( I always add lemon to chicken) cooked it as it says in the recipe. Didn't drain the liquid because I thought it would be a huge mess and I added the bbq sauce. This one for me is a keeper...easier than this, it almost doesn't get!

I also used kosher salt, pepper and garlic powder as the rub. I used chicken breasts and cut the cooking time down to about 40 and 20 minutes for 3 breasts. Very good, even my kids liked it.

I have used this recipe twice now to bbq my chicken.  I either use thighs or thigh/leg sections.  The chicken is always moist.  I season it a bit more - I a little of the following: garlic salt, mesquite grill, paprika and a little canjun mix.  I line my pan with foil to keep the mess down, I turn the chicken once in the first hour.  I use masterpiece bbq sauce - its awesome when served!

The method for cooking the chicken really makes it moist. I used 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts and covered for 30 minutes, removed foil, added bbq, and baked for another 15 minutes. It was very delicious.

I made this last night and we loved it!  Finger licking good!!!  I did add garlic, pepper and McCormick's Roasted Garlic and Herb seasoning (we love herbs and spices!)  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and added some hot sauce to it, mixed them together and basted the chicken on both sides after the first hour.  We don't like our food swimming in sauce, so this worked out wel for us.  I gave four stars because the chicken ( I used legs) had some redness at the bone on a few peices.  I like my bone with no red whatsoever... When I make it again, and I WILL make this again, I will add an additional 15 minutes to the covered cook time.  This recipe is a keeper!

I soaked my chicken over night in some salt and some garlic powder, I also added more garlic powder before cooking. The meat was tough, seems like it needs to be cooked longer and at a lower temperature, the meat barely had any flavor.

I took some advice from another review and put garlic powder, salt and pepper under the skins for the first 60 minutes.  Then removed the skins and resumed as directed.  Very tender and very tasty.  My entire family enjoyed it.

Wow, I have to say I am impressed! Even though it lacked that slightly smokey flavour you actually get from BBQ-ing on a charcoal grill, I felt this recipe was spot on! I did however, marinate my chicken in a mix of herbs we use when we are BBQ-ing. I liked the addition of the garlic flavour and I only used chicken thighs (skinless) because this is what I had on hand. The meat was tender and flavourful! I served this with fried rice and lo mien and spooned some of the extra sauce from the pan on top. Delicious! I will definitely have this again - no need to light up the grill just to get BBQ Chicken! Thanks for sharing!

heavenly!  I baked 4 chicken breasts with the whole bottle of bbq sauce - it was sooo yummy.  I cut the cooking time in half at each step - for 45 minutes total cooking time. My husband, who is not a big fan of BBQ (not sure why, it's the best) loved it and wanted more!  Since I love sauce, I would either make sure the baking dish is nearby with the leftover sauce, or I'd heat up some extra sauce to dip in.  The chicken was so moist.

This turned out great!  I forgot I used to make this from my father-in-laws recipe.  My never turned out as good as his and I think it was because I cut the skin off before cooking.  I hated doing it too! This was tender and juicy and really a hit with my family of 8!!

This was a wonderful way to make bbq chicken without the grill.  I used boneless chicken breasts and cut the cooking time in half.  I also used Buzzsaw's BBQ Sauce recipe from this site which worked out beautifully.  The chicken was tender, moist, and flavorful, and even my dark meat loving husband raved about it!

Great recipe for technique. I used thighs with skin and I followed other advice and added a spice rub under the skin during the 'dry bake'. Made all the difference. This is how I will be doing my winter BBQ chicken from now on! Thanks a bunch!

So reliable! Have made this once a week for many weeks now. Meat is tender, juicy. Oh, by the way, I've been using whole chicken legs as they are a cheap alternative. I've tried different sauces and it's perfect every time. THANK YOU!

Very nice. I added the garlic, some curry powder, parsley flakes, and salt and pepper to the initial baking. Removing the grease to add the BBQ sauce is a great idea!!!  Thanks! Next time I will use teriyaki.

As far as bbq chicken goes, this was really good.  I used just the breast, removed the skin, sprinkled with garlic powder.  I baked for 45 mins, then covered the breasts with bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's), covered and continued to bake for about 20 more mins.  Easy!

I love this recipe.  I used boneless, skinless breasts, thinned them with a meat mallet to about 1/2 thickness and cut the cooking time down a little bit.  The chicken was wonderfully tender and works great for bbq chicken sandwiches!

I gave this 5 stars for its simplicity.  This is one of those meals I make when the pantry is running low...I add a few seasonings, but it always turns out tender and juicy.

This was a great recipe and I'll definitely make it again.  I took the advice of other commenters and used some salt and pepper as well as the garlic powder to season the chicken for the first baking (I don't do onion powder) and also added a little bit of paprika to the mix.  I lined the baking pan with aluminum foil which made it really easy to get rid of all the fat from the first baking, and lined it again for the second, so hubby had very little to clean up (he appreciated that!).  I'm sure he liked it because he took leftovers for lunch today.

This is a very good recipe, the preparation is extremely easy which is what I look for most in new recipes. I also like to add adobo seasoning to the chicken, or sazon goya!

Yummy! I used chicken tenderloins, and marinated the chicken first (for about 15 minutes) using the rub from the recipe "Texas Pork Ribs" and adding liquid smoke and a bit of tabasco (for kick!). I used the Honey Baked Hams barbecue sauce that's been sitting around for awhile in my fridge, and the results were OUTSTANDING! I highly recommend using the rub to season the chicken - the garlic powder mentioned in the recipe just wouldn't be enough flavor on its own.

First, I let my husband do the cooking of this recipe, as I had to be the "taxi driver mom" this evening.  The chicken was cooked following the exact temp. and times, but I found it to be too oily/greasy.  I would definately drain the fat and then baste.  Our 12 and 15-year-old did eat it however, with no complaints.  This is a sure-fire recipe for when you are needing to speed things up.  Thank you for sharing!
PS: I see that the instructions do call for draining the grease...I apologize...I CAN follow directions...

This chicken is a wonderful main dish. If you like a bigger flavor, try this...

In addition to the garlic, use fresh ground black pepper, and some onion salt to the pre-bakeed chicken. Then, don't just use any ol' barbeque sauce, get yourself some Sweet Baby Ray's, it is the most flavorful I have ever found.

this was very tasty and the chicken fell right off the bone. i bought skin on chicken and the flavor was on the skin and not in the chicken, i would recommend skinless chicken in you want more bbq flavor.

The hardest part was cleaning the pan, It took me a while to clean it.  But other than that. The chicken was great! I will make this again.  I used boneless, skinless thigh fillets.  I also used salt and pepper as others had suggested.  Half way through I turned the chicken over to make sure it got cooked even on both sides.  Chicken was super moist.  This recipe is a keeper.  Just watch out for the messy pan.

I am afraid that this was not something my family liked at all. We thought the chicken was slippery and hard to manage. We used wings and legs and didn't remove the skin (maybe that was the problem) but it was not good at all. My husband suggested that he put what was leftover on the grill so we could at least eat them. There was ALOT leftover. Sorry- we will not try this again.

I used a package of foster farms "pick of the chick" which is a combination of breasts, thighs, and drumsticks.  I removed the skin and followed the directions as stated.  I highly recommend lining your pan with heavy duty foil on recipes like these.  Used KC Masterpiece original bbq sauce and it was REALLY good.  Perfect for a summer dinner in February.

Makes a nice, tender, juicy chicken.  Flavor depends on the barbecue sauce you use, but the preparation method makes a tasty chicken dish.  I will make this again.

This dish didn't float my boat.  The skin on the chicken turned kind of gross and mushy.  It also didn't have a lot of flavor.  If I were to ever attempt using this method again, I would use boneless and skinless chicken.

Thank you Julie!! Really, this was truly the easiest chicken recipe I've ever used, and so reliable, especially for a big group. I'm absolutely amazed at how juicy the chicken turned out--it honestly just fell off the bone.

This chicken was pretty good one problem i had was that i didn't let the chicken cook long enough cause i was trying to cook something else at a higher temp so i thought it would get done before it was time but i cooked it some more and turned out really good.

This was really easy! It didn't have tons of flavor as I had hoped, but I think I will try it with a spicier BBQ sauce next time. My son loved it. Thanks!

I used garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper sprinkling on top, bottom and under the skin then baked as per directions. Then I took bottled BBQ sauce, added a couple of dashes of hot sauce, splash of soy sauce mixed and glazed the cooked chicken. Then instead of placing back in oven I put them on a hot outside grill for just long enough for the sauce to caramelize slightly. My husband who doesn't care too much for BBQ said I could make this as often as I wanted. They were very good.

So good and easy to make.  I used chicken thighs that I marinated in Zesty Italian dressing for about an hour in a ziplock bag.   Sweet Baby Ray's Honey barbeque sauce provided a really nice flavor. So moist and fall off the bone delicious. Everyone really loved it.  Will make again.

Simple and easy to prepare. Chicken was very tender and moist, but the flavor was nothing phenomenal.

Very simple, easy and delicious.  My 5 year old declared this to be his favorite chicken recipe, and asked me to make it every night for dinner.  I followed the recipe, but pared it down to only 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts for our family and cut the baking time in half.  So juicy and tasty!

Fantastic! I make this with a whole chicken instead (put a 5lber in for about 1.5 hours then add the sauce and roast another 30 minutes) and I use half garlic powder and half onion powder. It comes out moist and sticky every time.

This reminds me so much of the chicken my mom made on Sundays growing up. I'm not a huge fan of frying chicken (love the taste but I just can't get it right) so this is a go-to for us on Sunday dinners now. Messy but everyone tears them up.

I have a convection oven and thought I only had to bake it 45 mins at 170C but ended up being a bit longer than an hour.  Then followed the recipe as usual and had a GREAT BBQ baked chicken. Will def do again!

LOVE THIS! Easiest recipe ever and the chicken was so tender! I used chicken thigh filets  and they were so good! The meat cut easily and was cooked evenly . I also used paprika along with garlic powder! Yummy!

Chicken came out very moist. Used a home made bbq sauce which was excellent. Whole family enjoyed it. Will use non-stick spray next time for easier clean up. Will also remove skin after first hour of baking. Thanks for sharing.

This was quick and simple! I used chicken thighs and like other reviewers put the garlic powder, salt, pepper under the skin, baked for an hour then removed foil and brushed on bbq every 10 min x30 min. Quick and easy weekday meal.

This recipe could not have been easier or more delicious.  All it takes is time.  I used a thick sauce so I probably should have thinned it out as another reviewer suggested.  Will definitely make again

Great recipe, and nice and simple too! I left the skin on, but pulled it up to get seasoning under the skin, and it was just great. I basted the chicken with more bbq sauce half way through, and then in the last 5 min too.  It was very good!

A little time consuming but an overall good recipe. I used a homemade BBQ sauce from this site (Scott Hibb's amazing grilled baby back ribs) and it was delicious.

Such a great, basic recipe! Very good flavor, meat didn't fall off the bone but was very good(I used all chicken breasts, bone-in). I was impressed that the bbq sauce stayed ON the chicken-it typically slides off into a burnt mess in the pan but, for some reason, with this method, it didn't. We'll definately be making this again & again!

Maybe it was me, but my dish was not "the best." It was definitely good and I probably will try again, but next time I think I'll let my chicken marinate in the barbecue sauce and then stick it in the oven to cook.

This is the easiest way to make Bbq chicken. We usually grill our chicken, but it was so hot out that we decided that we wanted to stay indoors, so I tried this recipe and it was great. It is nice to find an alternative to grilling.

Very tasty! I cut the time by cooking the chicken in a skillet with olive oil, cracked red pepper, paprika, and garlic for about 15 minutes. Then I transferred it to the oven for 45 minutes. Definitely a keeper!

I forgot to cover it for the first part and got a little worried when I went to add the barbeque sauce, but it came out very moist and delicious! Go figure!  I added a lot more barbeque sauce per our tastes, but was a delicious recipe!

This was perfect, although I only used it for the cooking temp/time. I added pepper, tony's seasoning and a few crushed red pepper sprinkles along with the garlic salt on both sides before placing in oven. Followed cooking directions to a T, and it was delicious. (used kc masterpiecr hot & spicy bbq sauce)

This was pretty good and very easy to make.  I did turn on the broiler to crisp it up a little bit.  It was a very enjoyable chicken and even my 6 y/o daughter loved it.

So simple and delicious!  I agree, you need to find a really good bbq sauce to use and stop halfway to drain the fat.  Who says cooking a great meal has to be complicated?

The best barbaqued chicken I ever ate!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few more spices prior to baking (salt,pepper,and mrs.dash) I prefer this chicken over barbaqued chicken on the grill. I think covering the chicken with foil is the key to its juicyness....

I used chicken thighs, bone-in, with skin and they came out wonderfully! I would give this five stars, except I did a little adjustments such as seasoning with salt and pepper and poultry seasoning under the skin. Without these seasonings, I think the chicken would have been lacking in flavor. I will definitely make this again, especially since it is so easy to make!

hubby loved this recipe! It was so simple to make! I found it didnt take as long to bake as the directions state. The meat fell off the bone and was so tender. I used Bulls Eye BBQ sauce, original flavor. I did add a touch of black pepper. Excellent.

I really liked this recipe.  I did not have Garlic Powder, so had to sub Onion powder and Garlic salt.  I also used chicken legs instead of chicken pieces.  I have made this recipe twice and both times it has been a hit.  We have to cook Gluten Free as both my husband and I are on gluten less diets.  This was wonderful over Rice pasta and Rice.

This recipe was the most delicious baked bbbq chicken recipe I have ever made. The chicken was incredibly moist and falling off of the bone. I used chicken thighs (bone in, skin on), and sprinkled them with Garlic Powder AND Adobo prior to putting them in the oven. After the hour, I used Jack Daniel's Original Spicy BBQ Sauce.. delicious! My roommate inhaled hers and asked for a second piece!

This was super easy to fix and very good. The chicken was moist and tender. Out here in the Southwest... it's sometimes too HOT to even grill.  This was the answer to barbecued chicken without standing out in the heat to grill.  For extra flavor I used "Grill Creations... chicken seasoning along with the garlic powder.  I also used boneless chicken breasts.  It's become a family favorite.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Simple and edible. It tastes exactly like you would think, like barbecue sauce. I made it with breasts and cooked for about half the time.
I'd make it again but not if I was looking for something unique or different.

I made this for my family for dinner, it's delicious. I lifted the skin and season the meat with garlic salt instead of powder along with ground pepper and a little barbeque sauce then replaced skin and added more barbeque. It's tender and delicious. I'll remove the skin and shred it before serving on rolls with yes, more barbeque sauce. yummy!

I would give this 5 stars since it was easy and delicious, but it was a little dry. I would try baking it covered the entire time. I think taking the foil off for the last 30 minutes dried it out.

I make this recipe fairly often. I've found that, to really make it flavorful, you have to make some additions to the recipe. I mix garlic powder, onion powder, and seasoned salt on a saucer. Then I rub that under the skin. Next I marinate for at least 30 minutes in a store-bought mesquite marinade. After that, I pretty much bake according to the recipe. The flavors seem to go through the chicken better this way.

I made some minor adjustments to this recipe, Since there are only the 2 of us I used a cornish game hen split in half. I also used a few more seasonings. I added some seasoned salt, black pepper and a bit of sea salt to the garlic powder. It came out very tender and flavorful. Add a baked potato and a salad and it was a great meal that seemed like it was a lot more work than it actually was. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe that we will use again and again.

I used chicken breast instead and it was fine. Just bbq covered chicken. Will probably make again for something easy.

Tried this recipe tonight. It came out very good. The chicken stayed very moist and the barbeque sauce thickened just enough. My son loved it and I will definitely make this one again. Thanks.

I actually did not care for the taste of my chicken but I still gave the recipe 4 stars because I think I used a yucky flavor b-b-q sauce.  The recipe deserved the high rating though because the chicken was very juicy and fell off of the bone.  Next time, I'll use a run-of-the-mill b-b-q flavor and not the special "gold" variety.

This chicken was good.  I made it EXACTLY as stated.  The meat was tender and juicy.  It didn't dry out at all.  This had a good overall flavor, but if you are someone who likes a lot of spice then I would add spices to your liking.  This was also very easy to make.  It didn't take a lot of preparation.

This is sooo easy to make and requires very little prep time.  The chicken turns out so moist and delicious.  I make this at least a couple times a week.

I used chicken breasts that were pre frozen in bbq sauce. I cooked it in a crock pot and shredded it for sandwiches. I wanted a little more sauce but I ran out so I added a little brown sugar and russian dressing. It was yummy.

Great dish.  Very easy to make. I did remove the skin after I baked the chicken.  I didn't drain the fat instead I used it as a basting unit while cooking the chicken the last 30 min.  Will make again and again.

I made this for dinner yesterday and my husband and father are still talking about it...even my very picky 3 year old asked for seconds!  Couldn't be easier.  I used "Sweet Baby Ray's" honey bbq sauce and S/P along with the garlic powder.  My dad said it was the best chicken he's ever had!

Hmmm, mine didn't fall off the bone at all.  It was tender and moist, but we needed hands and forks to get the meat off.  I did do half with skin on and half with skin off, and skin off is definitely better.  It was a good flavor for the chicken and it was stick it in the oven forget it easy.   Next time, I will try putting some sauce UNDER the  skin for the first hour, then take the skin off and add more sauce.  Basting every ten minutes with the dripping sauce during the last half hour would probably really increase the flavor.  I will try this again, and see what happens with the adjustments.

Just cooked this for dinner and it was sooo easy.  No mess.  I used drumsticks instead of whole chicken and it came out wonderful.  Used a honey flavored BBQ sauce...mmm.  I will try this again.

Chicken was very moist. Could have had more flavor though, maybe it was the BBQ sauce. Will make again. Was pretty simple, too. 11/29/05- Ive made this recipe over and over, It always turns out delicious.

Very good for sure.  Not "the best", but definitely a very good way to make barbeque chicken without a grill.  Boyfriend loved it, but he would eat BBQ'd running shoes if they had enough sauce on them, so I don't know if his opinion counts on this one.  :-)  all in all, a good recipe.

This was fine, as fine as our BBQ sauce.  I mean, that's what you would expect, right? Since it's really just chicken and BBQ sauce.  It isn't quite the same as BBQ on the grill, it loses a lot, but if you have a BBQ sauce you love then this is a no-brainer that will please you.

Not bad and definitely easy.  I used cut up chicken instead of the whole bird.  If I try this again, will follow recipe and use whole chicken.
