I had to improvise with the coloring since I was out of red.  I used Wilton's paste colors in burgundy, rose pink, and golden yellow. Turned out moist.

This was my first attempt at Red Velvet Cake and it was very tasty.  The cream cheese icing was incredible - I didn't put as much icing sugar as the recipe called for but everyone raved about it!
My only problem was after the cakes were baked, they were very brown on the outside (about a 1/8" inward) and the centres were the bright red.
I made the cakes again, but unstead of mixing the food colouring with the cocoa powder to make a paste, I mixed it into the buttermilk with the vanilla and vinegar.  I put the cocoa powder (which I sifted) in with the flour mixture.  It was still a little browner on the outside, but not nearly as much as before.
I would make this recipe again!

Everyone loved it, only made two adjustments baked for only 20 minutes, because i made two layers and it prevented it from being a dry cake. i also only used half the sugar  for the frosting and it was perfect!!! will make again and again.

Made this for my daughter's 14th Birthday as per her request. It turned out wonderfully delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and got compliments even on the cream cheese frosting. I have even shared the recipe with friends. Thank you Savannah!

This was my first attempt at a red velvet cake and my family love it. I allowed my four year to assist me with making the icing and he couldn't stop eating it. The cake was very good although I would've liked a tad bit more moisture with it. All in all this is a great recipe,will use again!!

This cake was the most moist cake I've ever made. I am just getting into baking. My boyfriend loved it!! He helped me make the icing( used another recipe) and could not stop eating it. Will make my own modifications and use again. Thanks :)

I just made the batter and followed it except am short on bottle of food coloring...1 tsp of salt is all I taste in the batter?  Not sure the other 1oz of food coloring will balance it, seems like should have been 1/2 tsp salt??

The cake solo was ok, a little dry.  I did not like the frosting!  Way too sweet, not cream cheesey like I like.  I will not use this recipe again.

This is the best red velvet cake I've made. I followed the recipe exactly, and the cake was moist with beautiful texture and flavor. The next time I make it, I will probably increase the ratio of cream cheese to butter slightly only because I like cream cheese frosting to have a bit more tang.

I'm SO disappointed with this cake. I should have known that with butter only and not any oil in the cake, it would be so dry. I went ahead and tried it because the other reviews were good, but now I'm kicking myself for not thinking about this. I made this for my mom's birthday and I followed the recipe exactly. I am a pretty decent baker, and I was embarrassed by how this came out. I am glad I listened to other review in one thing- I only put in 16 oz. of powdered sugar to the frosting, and it was already sickly sweet. I can't imagine how unpalatable it would be with even more sugar. I was so excited to give my mom the red velvet cake she wanted for her birthday, but I could not even eat this. I do not recommend this recipe.

The cake was moist but too crumbly for some reason, when I put the frosting on it, the crumbs mixed into the frosting so it lost  in aesthetic  although some could argue that the red harmonious color in the frosting could have been done on purpose.  I used the same cream cheese frosting recipe I use for carrot cake which is amazing. Good recipe but need to experiment more on making it less crumbly at least to make it an authentic red velvet cake. Strange part is that when I cut the pieces they were perfect and didn't fall apart.

I made this red velvet as a Bundt. When my family tried it, They said it was the best red velvet they ever tasted! If you have some leftovers. Crumble it over ice cream and freeze it to make a ice cream cake!

4. I used Hershey's 100% cocoa Special Dark powder. I

This was by far the best recipe for red velvet cake, it was dense but tender, the only thing we have changed is reducing a little bit of sugar on the frosting, adding a little bit more of cream cheese. The main modification was to add crushed Oreos on the filling and topping, witch turned out fine!

For some reason, just turned out like a regular chocolate cake - the colour was brown, the texture was just normal. Not sure what I did wrong.

The cake was amazing!!!  I used the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I made a two layered cake, so only bake it for about 25 minutes so it doesn't dry out.  If you are making 2 layers, double the delicious frosting.  The frosting was so easy and yummy that I am going to use it on other cakes, like carrot!  Thank you Savannah!!!
