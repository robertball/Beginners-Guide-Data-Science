Nice change from the usual buttered popcorn.  The only problem I had was that the popcorn needed to be stirred sooner than 5 minutes (more like 1-2 minutes) or it was going to burn.  I also only roasted it for maybe about 8 minutes.  By the way I was temped to skip the time in the oven and I am glad it did not, it mellowed the flavors and blended them nicely.  Thanks for the recipe.

This. Is. Awesome. Totally kicked my salty cravings to the curb. I cut this down to four servings, just for me and my two younger boys. We all loved it, even them. I was surprized. I did add just a little more of the spices, but I like mine a little peppier. Totally going to make this again. I might try this with Butter Buds.

Really good recipe!  I cut the butter in half and added a touch of olive oil...to try and make the fats a bit healthier. I like the spices, but they were too mellow for me (hence the 4 stars), so I drizzled some hot sauce over the top and tossed it at the last minute.  Thanks!

I am clearly a minority here but I have to say that this wasn't my favorite.  I couldn't get past the paprika and lemon pepper flavors.  I think this would have been excellent though if I had just added the melted butter and sprinkled it with creole seasoning.  That's what I'll do next time.  ;)

This was really good and addictive.  I made this with microwave popcorn and used about half the recommended spice/butter mixture for it. I also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt.  I baked it but only for about 7 or so minutes as I got concerned about burning it.  One thing I did do was line a baking sheet with some parchment paper before I put the popcorn down.  This made removal easy because I was able to just lift out the parchment paper and it made cleanup even easier (no greasy pans).  Thanks for the recipe!

A 4 from the hubby....more like a 4-5 for me. Scaled down to two servings. Totally elimated the butter /margarine and eliminated the salt. Used Orville's Naturals lightly salted bag of popcorn ......which I shook the seasoning right in the bag of popped corn. I loved the spice of the cayenne and the tang of the lemon pepper.  Yummy!

Good, but you need to like a more savory popcorn. It is spicy, but not too spicy.

Awesome! Didn't have onion powder, but had the rest of the ingredients and adjusted to taste... didn't bake it either, just added the spice to regular popcorn we made on the stove.

We felt that it needed a little sweetness, so we added a drizzle of maple syrup along with the melted butter we poured on top.. made it perfect!

Love this recipe! Made just 8 cups of popcorn for my husband and I. We ate it all! This popcorn is so addictive! The flavors are delicious! Will make this again and again.
