I made this last night with some fresh halibut, and it turned out great.  I did NOT use the full cup of olive oil, as that seemed quite excessive.  I maybe used about 1/4 cup which still was probably too much.  I am thinking that is what makes this recipe 911 calories per serving.  I cut up a 1.3 lb halibut fillet into 6 pieces and baked them in the oven at 375 degrees (F) for about 18 minutes.

This was appealing to me as it is unencumbered by lots of fatty, rich extras like cheese, mayo, sauces, etc. 
I baked this at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, only because I am more comfortable with this method. I used fresh dill, freshly ground pepper and a sprinkle of paprika for color.  You can't go wrong with this flavor combination of lemon, dill, garlic and olive oil, which for any fish is always a winner.

I chose this halibut recipe over others because it didn't smother the pricey fish with ingredients.  I used halibut steaks rather than fillets.  It was simple and flavorful.  I'll make again with slightly less salt.

I used frozen halibut and cooked it according to the package instructions, 375 degrees for 8-12 minutes.  I juiced two lemons, used two cloves of fresh garlic to replace the powder, dried dill weed (didn't have fresh) and I added a teaspoon of melted butter plus about two tablespoons of olive oil.  I placed all of the seasoning in a bowl and whisked it together.  I then coated the fish with the seasoning, placed it in a greased baking dish, and poored the remaining seasoning over it.  I served the fish with steamed broccoli and roasted garlic couscous.  My two year old and husband gobbled it up.  Quick and delicious!

I would give it a five because it was AMAZING, but not as written.  1 cup of olive oil??  That's GOT to be a mis print, because that is just crazy.  Used about 3 tbsps of olive oil, a little extra dill, and fresh garlic instead of powder, got amazing fish from costco, not frozen so that made it better, but it was SO SO awesome.  Yummy!

I thought the olive oil was a bit excessive. I used just enough oil to coat the baking sheet and my halibut steak. For a little variation, I put my halibut steak on some sauteed onions & fennel root. I also added a touch of fennel leaves & ground fennel seeds for a bit more flavour.

I made this with sea salt, canola oil, dill, cilantro, lemon juice, and thinly sliced swiss cheese on top.  I then baked it for 15 minutes at 375, and it turned out amazing.  I highly recommend this!

Excellent recipe.  Mild flavor that doesn't overpower the fish.  Great for halibut and other mild flavored fish.

UNBELIEVABLE!!! This was delicious! I bought some Tilapia and just looked up this recipe today...I then fryed the fish in Sesame seed oil instead of olive oil because I didn't have any. Everything else was the same. This was YUMMY YUM YUM! I loved this taste so much that when I finished eating it I didn't want to put anything else in my mouth just so I could let the taste linger.

Bought about a pound of halibut from Costco and needed a good simple recipe and this was def it!! I only used half the lemon, eye balled sea salt and garlic powder and used fresh dill. Sprayed foil and fish with olive oil spray. Very, very good!

So simple and delicate.  Instead of broiling (scared of my oven's broiler) I baked for about 20 minutes at 400.  I added a bit of fresh ground black pepper.  I used a little less salt and it was perfectly moist and tender and totally worth the impulse buy the halibut was that afternoon.

This only took a couple minutes to put together, and it fit well into my diet.  I used less than a tablespoon of oil, and it cooked under the broiler (several inches away) in about ten minutes.  Next time I will take a little more time and add fresh garlic and dill, but this was easy!

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the olive oil.  A cup is really too much.  I simply brushed both sides of the fish with olive oil and that was plenty.  I used halibut steaks for this and they turned out fantastic.  It's such a simple and flavorful way to cook this fish.  I also melted a thin sliver of butter on top of the fish after I took it out from the broiler.  Even my 5-year-old loved this recipe and ate every bite!

My hubby really loved this recipe.  I used haddock instead of halibut.  I liked that it let the taste of the fish shine instead of covering it up with a rich sauce. My kids liked this a lot as well.

Covering the fish may improve the flavor and keep it from drying out.

This is a delish, quick and really easy way to prepare Halibut.  I managed to get fresh Halibut at the market today and wanted to stay away from recipies with lots of cream or cheese.  This was the perfect one for me.  My hubby and the kids all agree, we will definately make this again - Thanks!!!!!!!

Absolutely delicious!  My father said it was the best Halibut he ever had.  I served it with a risotto and a side of broccoli, which accented it very well.

Pretty much followed the recipe except to blend butter with the olive oil. Wasn't stingy with the herbs but didn't overdo them either. Placed on the middle rack under the broiler for 20 minutes and came out perfectly done, moist and flaky,  Really very pleased with the results.

This was very delicious!!! The whole family enjoyed....I did add a few things to the halibut- lemon pepper and onion powder. This was a very light and fresh dish that I paired with Mushroom Rice Pilaf (also on this website) and roasted brussel sprouts. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I love white fish, and the seasonings were delicious. This is really easy to make, but it's easy to overdo the spices. I used dill weed, black pepper, and some Hawaiian salt (I should've used less), and the fillets tasted a little too salty (I think the salt was really strong). I'd recommend being generous with the dill weed and black pepper, or whatever spices you use, but not using too many different types, and sparing with the salt and olive oil, or the fillets will be really oily.

I only had a 1 lb. piece and mistakingly used the amount of salt, garlic poweder and dill weed that was called for using 2 lbs.  Result:  too salty!  The rest of the flavors were great, but I think if I made it again I would omit the salt completely. It's unnecessary.

It was a good fast recipe but it was a little lemony and salty. I would use this recipe again but I would go a little light on the salt and lemon juice.

We love the taste of halibut and also enjoy it with the creams and cheeses but for a wonderful way to just enjoy the fish this is it.  Wonderful pure halibut flavor gently seasoned.  I did use fresh dill.  We make this often.  Love your recipe Cruisem!  Thanks.

Followed as directed except for I used fresh garlic vs. garlic powder. Fish should be 4" away from broiler. I cooked mine 375 for 18 minutes and broiled for a minute or so near the end. I think fresh dill would be better.

This was quite good... I altered the recipe slightly - instead of sea salt, used a sea salt mixed with herbs (made for using on fish).  Cooked it on the grill wrapped in foil with some thinly sliced lemons on top to kind of steam in the lemon flavor with the fish. I also put a small pad of butter in the foil to keep the fish moist and enhance the flavor... this of course adds fat/calories, but I thought it was for the best...  Def would make again next time the halibut is on sale ;)  Served with saffron rice and steamed green beans!

Wonderful! I was looking for a good Halibut recipe that didn't add a lot of fat. I brushed the oil on lightly. I used some of the items that I had on hand and made just a couple changes. I used Fresh crushed garlic rather than the powder. I just brushed it around and mixed it with the oil and lemon juice. I used a Pampered Chef Dill mix rather than plain dill. I enjoyed it very much!!

Excellent flavor but the recommended 15 minute broil time dried out the texture.  Next time, I'll check it at 10 minutes.

Delicious!  As with other reviewers, I didn't see the point of slathering cheese, cream etc on a choice cut of fish.  The halibut was 2.5 lb and cooked it at 400 for just over twenty minutes.

This is a simple and tasty fish dish.  I loved how the lemon and herbs enhanced the flavor of the halibut--it is very mild tasting without the "fishiness".

Broiling really dried out this fish.  The top layer was tough and the dill and garlic were burned to a crisp ( used fresh garlic not garlic powder).  Maybe baking would be a better option.

So good, the people who don't like are crazy. This is so easy and so worth it. You will not be disappointed. I made no changes except to cut the cheese sauce in half as we had small Halibut steaks.

This was very good.  The ONLY change I made was to add lots of butter!  I also baked it at 400 for 20 min.    My husband was all prepared to make his "famous" lemon-butter sauce, but with the butter and lemon juice already cooked with the halibut, he didn't have to. He really enjoyed this dish!

I used frozen halibut and dried dill, but it still worked fine.  The lemon, garlic, and dill go together very nicely.  I put the oven rack 4 inches from the broiler (the distance recommended on a fish cooking website) so it didn't burn as I worried it might.  I cooked it for 20 minutes but you should check it at 15-- mine was overdone.

The flavor is fantastic, and I am not a big fan of fish! I added 1 tsp of Balsamic vinegar to 1/4 cup olive oil and brushed it on the fillets before I added the seasonings. (It would have been even more fabulous if the fillets I used had been fresh instead of frozen; the texture would have been much better.) My husband loved it, as well. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was okay. Our halibut came out really dry though so I think the time to broil it was too long -- or maybe it was because I have a convection oven. At any rate, the flavors were good and I'm glad I took other people's advice and cut back on the oil. The one cup would have been WAY too much.

A good solid halibut recipe. The olive oil gives it a nice buttery taste, and the dill is appropriately subtle. Better than plain fish, but not a five-star.

This was a great simple way to enjoy delicious halibut!  I made it almost exactly as written - I just baked it at 375 for about 20 minutes instead of broiling because I had thicker steaks.  I also used zest in place of lemon juice to reduce the acidity but it was absolutely delicious!  Plan to make it this way all the time!  One suggestion that doesn't affect the recipe as written - try adding some fennel slices to the pan under and around the halibut and some fronds on top - adds a great flavor!

Easy to make and quick.  The fish I used was either halibut or mahi mahi.  I broiled for 10 - 11 minutes and it was over cooked.  Next time I'll try 7-8 minutes.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  Don't hesitate to use fresh minced garlic-- and pile it on.  So so so very good and very easy.  Nice light taste and texture.  It's nice that it's not swimming in butter.

This was really easy and fast. I used Alaskan cod and some kosher salt, but only half a tsp. My husband cooked this on the grill for 5 minutes per side. This dish had a nice flavor and as my teen put it, "This fish is awesome!".

Excellent....my first attempt at cooking Halibut. I used Shake & Bake for fish but I think next time I'll make my own coating.

OMG! This is my favorite Halibut recipe ever. Didn't measure anything, just sprinkled it on in the order given. Used Halibut steaks and baked for 20 min at 400 degrees. Couldn't have been easier!

Amazing recipe. I love the simple flavors that enhance the fresh fish.  Only giving 4 stars because of the olive oil amount - I agree with others, a light brushing is all that is needed.

It was good. Now, to start, I had 2 freshly caught, flash frozen, Alaskan Halibut fillets, that were about 0.5"- 1.0" thick. I wanted something that kept the natural halibut taste but at the same time enhanced it with some other, good, natural flavours. I read pretty much every single review on this dish that was written so far, so i adjusted only a few things to the original recipe, based on a few of the majority suggestions.  
       First, I used avocado oil, refined for high heat, instead of olive oil ( I have been experimenting with different healthy fat oils because butter is one of the top 10 causes of obesity and Atherosclerosis in America. Just saying [ well, that, and all the preservatives America puts in their prepared foods that are illegal in other countries ]  ). Back on topic; Oil. I did not use 1 cup though the recipe stated to. I instead, used about 4 Tb of my avocado oil ( this is a suggested minimum amount unless you like your fish dry ), and finger massaged it into both sides of the fillets. I also brushed some on the bottom of the foil covered pan, in the location that I am going to place my fillets. 
       I then sliced up a large lemon, a little thicker than normal slices, about 0.25" -0.50" thick and placed 2 slices underneath both fillets ( laying side by side, as to evenly support the weight of the fillet,  [ obviously,  If you have a larger piece of fish, use more slices ] ). I did this because some of the reviews stated that sometimes the Halibut

I took some other reviewers' advice and baked it instead of broiling it.  Had I not cooked it too long, it would have been amazing!  I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little dilly.

This was good, but I bit too simply dressed for me.  I like a bit more flavor for halibut.  I've crusted halibut with herbs and with sesame seeds, and love it.

Ditto with the oil. Needs very little. I put just a bit in ( Tablespoon) and got happy with the lemon juice, dill and garlic and fresh pepper. I put in in my toaster ( broil setting)oven  for 15 min but really 12 min would have been fine. It ws very nice.

This is so yummy! The garlic and dill pair very well with the halibut. I love that it's not covered in butter, so it keeps the meal healthy.

Used white fish fillets.  Did not measure spices; just eyeballed.  Baked the fish in the oven and then broiled at the end for about a minute or two.  Nice flavor.
