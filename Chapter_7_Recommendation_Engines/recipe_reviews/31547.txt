This is a FABULOUS dish!!! My husband and I loved it. I made a few alterations though. I added some cubed chicken, a clove of crushed garlic, and a can of water chestnuts for extra flavor. I only used 1 flavor packet from the rice and used reduced sodium soup to cut down on salt. Any more and it would have been salty! Make sure to stir it up periodically otherwise the rice on top won't soak enough liquid and it will be a little crunchy. I cooked mine on low for 7 hours and it was done properly, but there was a burned layer on the bottom of the crock pot. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm so happy to find a side dish recipe for the crockpot.  I took this to work for a potluck and it got rave reviews.  To cut down on saltiness, I will probably add only one of the rice flavoring packets next time.

This is a good side dish. As another reviewer said, it makes alot so would be excellent for large family, potluck or when having guests for supper. If your family doesn't mind having the same side dish two days in a row make it with servings as given otherwise, cut recipe in half. I agree that sliced water chestnuts would be a nice addition if you like texture variety. I think I will keep several boxes of the instant rice mix handy in my pantry now. Almost forgot, it did take a bit longer for the rice to cook completely than recipe said so you might want to test out cooking time in your slowcooker before serving it for a specifically timed dinner.

New Twist for the LEFTOVERS..read on! This recipe is Delicious and very easy to make. I doubled recipe for a crowd, and thanks to the other reviews I only put in half of the seasoning packets (would have been way too salty otherwise). Here's a new twist...I had quite a bit left over so put whole crock into fridge, next day I added 2 cartons of Campbell's chicken stock and a bit of leftover turkey- slowcooked for about 3 hrs on high and got RAVE reviews on the soup! Next time I will purposely make too much so we can have the soup again. Try it, you won't be dissappointed!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. My only mistake was that I also had stuffing. This came out to the same consistency as a stuffing, and tasted much better! I made only two changes. I *hate* American cheese with a passion, so I made this with some leftover Mexican Cheese Blend (cheddar, jack, queso mexicano). And I cut back on the seasoning pack in the instant long grain and wild rice by 25%, so it wouldn't be TOO salty.

Everyone loved this dish.

This turned out to be an excellent dish! I cooked mine in a Dutch oven for two hours on medium high to high, adding more chicken stock as necessary. I also added two chopped cloves of garlic and halved both the onion and the wild rice seasoning (thanks to the other reviewers who suggested this.)  Omitted the celery as I had none, and used half cheddar cheese and half parmesan cheese and it rocked!  Thanks for posting.

This is a delicious dish with a creamy risotto-like consistency and wonderful presentation. It's also super easy to make. I followed the suggestions of the other reviews and: 1) added 2 crushed garlic cloves, 2) used 1/2 of seasoning packets and 1/2 onion called for, 3) added 1/2 Cheddar & 1/2 Parmesean, 4)added water chestnuts and stirred 3/4 of way through cooking. I also didn't add the cheeses until just prior to serving.

I served this for Easter brunch and it was elegant and so tasty! I added a can of sliced water chestnuts for a little extra crunch. The recipe makes a ton and we had enough for 2 more dinners. Excellent recipe and so easy- just throw it all in the crock pot!

I made this as a Christmas side dish -- it was great! I don't really like mushrooms, so I omitted them without a problem and also used 12 oz of wild rice instead of instant rice mix and added chicken bouillon to taste.

I added chicken to this to make it a main dish.  Good flavor, but since my work schedule requires longer time in the slow cooker, the rice was somewhat mushy--my fault, not the recipe's.  Nevertheless, it was good enough to make again and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

This is awesome!  One change I made was to use unsalted butter, as the soup and the flavor packet add enough salt to this dish as it is.  We really liked this and it makes a ton.

This was fantastic!  I highly recommend reading the reviews before making a recipe because it will save you time, expense, and disappointment.  I thoroughly read the reviews and I practically have this recipe memorized because I almost had a disaster!  Because manufacturers don't want to raise their prices on their products, they are lowering their volume.  Let me explain:  I bought all the ingredients and proceeded to combine the water, soup, and rice w/ only 1 seasoning packet when I discovered that my box of rice only has 4.3 oz. and the recipe calls for 6 oz. box, making it a total of 8.6 oz. so I was short 3.4 oz.  On some ingredients that wouldn't make a big difference but rice needs to be more accurate.  What was I to do?  I went ahead and had to remove some of the liquid and cut down proportionally on the cheese.  Having said all that, I will now tell you what changes I made.  I used cr. of chix soup (son doesn't like mushrooms), 1/2 onion, no celery, butter, or mushrooms.  Cooked 6 hours on low, stirring only once after 4 hours and it was perfect!  All prepared to make soup w/ the leftovers, as someone else suggested, but I didn't have any!  I even doubled this in one crockpot w/o any problems.

OMG!!!!!!!!! This stuff is the best rice dish ever!!!! I used sharp cheddar instead of American cheese (only because I never buy American cheese because we don't normally prefer that kind) we are not big onion eaters so I just used 1 small sweet onion and pulverized it in my food chopper! I absolutely loved this dish and ate the leftovers for two days after! I did use unsalted butter as some of the other reviewers suggested but I am confident that using salted butter next time will not make the dish too salty! I am so grateful that you posted this recipe!!!!! I have decided I am going to experiment with it further and see if I can come up with something almost the same but using just plain brown rice (because I always have brown rice on hand). Thank you sooooo much!!

I loved how easy this was but felt like it needed more flavor.  I don't eat much cheese but decided to substitute the American for crumbled blue cheese and MAn did that kick it up a notch!! I just crumbled it in when it was warming and fully cooked and was very happy with the entire thing that way:)

I thought this was quite salty, but my coworkers loved it.  I'll probably make this again, but with less of the wild rice seasoning.  Also, mine was done in less than 5 hours on low, so your mileage may vary.

Great side dish. My husband raved about it. Next time I might use cheddar cheese instead to give it that extra kick. But, I will definitely be making this again.

I make it exactly as the recipe says and it's perfect.  Now I add broccoli, water chestnuts, smoked sausage, and it's no longer a side dish.  I've made this numerous times and it was a big hit.

I loved this dish! Used Mozzarella cheese, 1/2 the butter, and used a blend of plain basmati rice and plain wild rice. Sprinkled some garlic salt on the top in the last 20 minutes.

It came out a gloopy mess and tasted just so-so.   I even sauteed the onions and rice in the oil before putting everything into the pot.  Will not make again.

Great dish for large crowd. Cut in half for small family. Added 1 1/2 flavor (per suggestions) and cooked on high 3 hours. Hubby didn't reheat leftovers- I did. Next time will cut back hardcore on onions only because onions overpowered way too much. Everything else was perfect in my opinion.

So good – an exceptional side dish.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of making half the amount.  Delicious, creamy and very easy.  The cooking time was four hours on low for me.  I will be making this again.

This was an easy slow cooker recipe. I followed it using the seasoning packets that came with the rice. This turned out pretty salty so I would only use one packet instead of 1 1/2 next time. I also used cheddar instead of american cheese but by the time it was done cooking I couldn't tell it was there. Next time I would add it at the end. Also, I added veggie crumbles for protein to make it a main dish. We cooked it on low for 6 hours so it would not get mushy and that timing worked out well. We will probably make this again, but just test out new spices/seasoning.

Love it!!  I absolutely love this dish.  Yummo!!  Add in ideas I've tried is cubed ham or pork sausage.  I like salt but I can see how some would not like this dish because of the salt content.  A way to reduce salt would be to use sodium free chicken broth and reduced sodium cream of chicken soup.

This was a gloppy mess.I followed the directions exactly but the rice turned to mush. The taste wasn't bad, just standard comfort food that has too much salt and fat to be healthy. I guess if your serving people that can't chew their food this would be ideal.

Very, very tasty.  I made it exactly as stated and it turned out wonderfully.  Others were right, though, it made a whole crockpot full so we had leftovers 2 times.  I will certainly make this again but only once in a while since it is sooooo fattening and full of sodium! (That's why it's sooo good!)

I really enjoyed this recipe and I will definately make again.  I think I made an error in making it however,  the recipe calls for 2 onions, finely chopped.  I took this to mean regular onions and not what I refer to as "green onions"...well I thought it was a lot and only put in the one and still it had too much onion taste for me, but it was still good.  I was wondering if anyone else had this problem since other reviewers didn't mention it or am I just "recipe-reading-challenged" not to figure this out...ha!  I still gave it 5 stars as it was good and I know it will be a GREAT recipe when I use less onion.

One of my kids' favorites.  As recommended by another reviewer, I use 1.5 packets of the seasoning from the rice mix, cook less time than it says, and used light mushroom soup and half the butter.  Still a big hit as a vegetarian entree.

I used suggestions from other reviewers 1) added 2 crushed garlic cloves, 2) used 1/2 of seasoning packets and 1/2 onion called for, 3) added 1/2 Cheddar & 1/2 Parmesean, 4)added water chestnuts and stirred 3/4 of way through cooking. I also didn't add the cheeses until just prior to serving.

I modified this to my family's tastes like most everyone else but used the basics for rice blend to water ratio and the cooking method.  I used 1.5 cups (12 oz) of a wild rice blend (no seasoning), 2.5 cups of no salt vegetable stock (for flavor since I didn't have seasoning packets with the blend I used), the Healthy Choice version of the cream of mushroom soup, 8 oz of sliced mushrooms, half of a large bunch of sliced green onions (what I had) and just about a tablespoon of light butter since my family likes to add butter at the table to their rice.  For the cheese I added about a half of cup of shredded Italian cheese right at the end, any more and that would have been too much for my family, so add according to taste.  I cooked a total of about 3.25 hrs on high in my round crockpot, which was a little bit too much as my rice was a bit sticky (my fault). I will use the basics of this recipe again because my family enjoyed this a lot.

I don't usually like boxed stuff but this was good. I used half the butter and sharp cheddar cheese. Also only used half the spice packet. Topped with toasted almonds. Yum!

Omitted the butter (it definitely didn't need it) and the onions (my husband won't eat anything with onions in it) but put in more sliced mushrooms instead. The only instant wild rice mix I could find was "Uncle Ben's Natural Selections Olive Oil and Garlic". And I have no idea what "American" cheese is but I used shredded cheddar.

This was super easy to make and it tasted pretty good, too, but next time I will add broccoli instead of celery.

I loved this dish!! Used cream of chicken soup and added sliced water chestnuts because I had them in the pantry. Used only 1 seasoning pkt.  (Also subbed colby jack cheese and parmesan...it's what I had.) It looked very unappealing and I had my doubts while it was cooking, but by the end, oh so tasty!  I may cut back on some of the butter next time.  Although it made the rice so luscious, it was a little bit greasy.  I did stir the crock a couple of times during the day for even cooking.  I'm ready to make it again already!  Thank you for a different and comforting recipe!!

Used less butter and Mozarella cheese to reduce the fat. It still tasted great, just less guilty.

I took this to a pot-luck lunch and it received multiple rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception: included probably 1 c. of mushrooms (instead of 1/2 c.), and cubed the butter & velveeta for better integration into the pot.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good recipe. I only added one packet, used healthy request reduced sodium soup, just one onion and added extra mushrooms. Only issue was that it was a little mushy because I had timed it to take 9 hours and low and it probably needed 5-6 hours. Great vegetarian, gluten free side dish!

We really enjoyed this side-dish.  Only drawback was that I expected it to be done in 2 hours and it wasn't.  No worries, we just ate 2 hours later! I did add about 6 oz. more water to try to speed up the process.  This recipe make waaaay more that 8 servings, so it would be perfect for a large crowd.  We are looking forward to the leftovers of this one.

This recipe is a GREAT side dish.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I altered it slightly.  I used Colby instead of American cheese and I replaced the mushrooms with sliced water chestnuts.  They added a really nice crunch.  This goes really well with marinated pork tenderloin from this site.  Thanks for a great, easy sidedish.

Great recipe. I substituted chicken broth for the water for added flavor and used sliced portobello mushrooms for a more meatier mushroom.

This was very tasty.  I had cooked wild rice left over from the previous day and needed to 're-do' it.  This recipe worked perfectly for that.  I only had dried mushrooms that I rehydrated and used.  Everybody loved it!  Next time I'll add some browned ground beef or pork.

Ugghhh. For once I'm glad I have a small crockpot - I was originally going to double this recipe so I had lots of leftovers but since only one lot of the ingredients fit I only made the original recipe size. And just as well. This was bland as and nobody was a fan - not even my 14mo who eats anything I put in front of her. We all just sort of picked at it so I give it 2 stars as it was edible. Too bland and too much liquid. Won't be making this again.

I made the rice on the stovetop, mixed in the additional ingredients and transferred it to the oven for 30 minutes. I also added fresh blanched broccoli to make this an all inclusive side dish. The soup and grated cheddar cheese makes it yummy.

Too much onion for my taste.  I used 1 1/2 onions, and that was way too much.  I would probably use around 3/4 of an onion in the future.  Other than the onions, very tasty.

I did only use one seasoning packet from the rice, but it was still a little strange in flavor - I think this recipie could use a bit of balsamic vinegar, or another flavorful veggie or two added in - otherwise it's got the appearance of brown mushy rice that's very earthy in flavor.

Excellent!  Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I did however use our rice cooker and cooked the wild rice on Gaba Brown setting (3 + hours).  Everyone raved about it!  Will definitely make this again!

I loved it!!!  Easy and yummy.  Altho I did cut back on the onions a bit, seemed like quite a lot to me.

I feel strange being one of the rare few that didn't care for this dish. It was too salty, and I didn't even add salt to the recipe. Not sure if I was supposed to use the seasoning packet that came with the rice, but I ended up using it since there weren't any seasonings in the recipe. It wasn't terrible, just not a fave of mine.

Man did this smell good cooking!  I have to say though that it didn't taste as good.  Not bad though.  It wasn't what I was looking for.  I used shredded cheese, that it what I had and it worked fine.  None of my kids liked it so I won't make it again.

I made this for our Christmas dinner with our family, and it came out great. Very easy, and everyone loved it. I even had people asking me for the recipe.
