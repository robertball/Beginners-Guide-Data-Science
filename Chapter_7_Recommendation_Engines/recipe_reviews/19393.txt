The first time I made this recipe, I followed it exactly. It was good, but a bit bland for my taste. The second time, I substituted a few things. First, I added sweet vidalia onions instead of ordinary white onion. I used diced tomatoes with basil and oregano instead of crushed tomatoes. I sauteed all the veggies except the tomatoes in olive oil along with mushrooms and black olives. I added the tomatoes near the end, just to warm through, along with a pinch each of red pepper flakes and italian seasoning. Also, i used radiatore instead of angel hair pasta just because I like it better. With a few changes, this was so good even my meat loving mother loved it! This is a new family staple.

After reading reviews, I added about a half cup of chopped fresh basil and parsley to the tomatos and let them sit while I prepared the rest of the dish.  I also used olive oil instead of butter when heating the onion and garlic.  I added a little more fresh basil to the zucchini & squash while they cooked. And I used wwhole heat penne pasta.  My fiance and I thought this dish was very good.  I'm still eating the left overs!

Great recipe...delicious! I made this recipe with a few minor modifications. I used one vidalia onion instead of a white onion, 1 (28 oz.) can diced basil oregano garlic tomatoes instead of crushed tomoates and 1/2 cup fresh basil and parsley chopped. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe has very nice subtle flavors.  I skipped the butter and used olive oil in its place to lose the sat fat.  Also added 1/4 cup of chopped fresh parsley.  Very good.

Excellent! I used a quart of tomatoes that I canned last summer in place of the crushed tomatoes, omitted the butter and olive oil (the jar of tomatoes had plenty of liquid). I also substituted whole wheat linguine instead of angel hair pasta (sounded better to me). I added Italian seasonings. Hit the spot!

So yummy! I made this tonight for my roommate and my vegetable-hating boyfriend, and even he enjoyed it! I did take a few liberties with the sauce, though; instead of the crushed tomatoes, I used a can of Hunts tomato sauce and a can of Hunts diced tomatoes, because we like our pasta to have a more liquidy sauce. I also added oregano, because I love that stuff. All in all, even though boyfriend wished it'd had meat, he still liked it, and the roommate and I absolutely LOVED it. Very tasty, and it isn't such a heavy pasta that it makes you feel sluggish after you're finished eating. I will definitely make this again, and will definitely recommend it to others!

Just okay for me. Next time I would use tomato sauce along with the diced tomatoes. Fresh tomatoes would definitely be better than canned, as well as some fresh or dried herbs. I found that 1 lb of pasta was way, way too much for the amount of other ingredients.

This would be better if the zucchini were cut into smaller dices. Also, be sure to use smaller yellow squash, mine were really big so they were too tough for this dish. Over all, it tastes good and is easy to make. I will make it again with smaller dices and just zucchini.

This was a great meal. Easy to prepare. For those who like to have a little protein with their meal. We served it with some grilled Italian sausages.  It worked great together.

Good light summer meal. Great basic recipe, and easy to add new items too. I added more veggies: diced bell peppers (red/yellow), fresh diced tomatoes, onions and crushed garlic. I used a three cheese sauce and it was great!

I made this for my stepdaughters birthday party and everyone loved it. This is something that can really be ate hot or cold and not just as a side dish it really could be a main course also. UPDATE: I have now made this a few times and read more of the reviews I also add mushrooms and use the crushed tomatoes with basil. I also have used different kinds of onions. I also this last time added some parm. cheese and it was great. I have tried different pasta's also but I think the angel hair is best.

Please save your ingredients and do not bother with this recipe. No amount of doctoring could bring this up to par, not even the cheddar cheese someone mentioned...and cheese fixes everything! SO BLAND, terrible. Not to mention, all similar textures, blah. The only positive was that it looked (deceivingly) colorful and appetizing.

Even though it isn't summer zucchini is plentiful right now. I made this meatless dish and was pleasantly surprised that my husband loved it. He even requested that I make to take to a monthly potluck dinner we attend. Made this recipe again and several ladies asked for the recipe. This recipe is a keeper.

Very good and easy dish. I made this for the first time last week and again this week for my fiance and I and we both love it. Only four stars because I had to do a lot of modifications. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3.

My family really liked this. I used spagetti sauce instead of the diced tomatoes.  Cooked zucchini, squash and onions by the directions and they turned out very tender. I think the diced tomatoes would make it a lighter summer dish.

Made this recipe and it was delicious!  very simple and fresh for a summer night.  I made some changes based on the suggestions others mentioned.  For the tomato sauce I used half a can of tomato sauce, a can of tomato paste, and a can of diced tomatoes with Italian herbs.  I also added some fresh basil and dried oregano.  I will definitely be making this again!

wow! This is delicious!! Will be making this alot this summer.  I did change it up a bit and took some of the advice listed in some of the other reviews. Used spaghetti sauce and diced up my own tomatoes instead of the can crushed tomatoes. Also, I added, mozzarella and parmesean cheeses, diced up a green pepper and added a little jalapeno pepper from my garden. It was delicious.. Even my kids enjoyed it!

Very yummy!  I made the recipe as written except adding some mushrooms since I had some on hand.  I love how you can taste the veggies without being overpowered by seasonings.

I think this recipe is good...but I added some things to it.. I added some red pepper flakes to the zucchini and I also added some parmesan cheese while it was cooking as well.

I added italian seasoning and made it with fresh tomatoes.  It still tasted a bit bland.  What made a huge difference was adding parmesan cheese after serving.

This was very easy and quick to make. Very nutritious too.  The flavor was a bit bland for my family's tastes though.
