My family loved this dish! I made adjustments to what ingrediants I had in the house. Substituted honey for molasses, 4 closed fresh minced garlic, and dried lemon peel. The flavor was fab! Our grill is very hot and was done after 3-4 minutes on each side.

This was a quick, simple and very tasty recipe. I used real maple syrup instead of molasses and next time I will reduce the amount of olive oil to 1/3 cup, I think that 1/2 cup was a little too much for this dish. You can see on my picture how the corners of this salmon turned out nice and caramelized, just delicious!

My mom says this is the most she has enjoyed salmon in a long time! Next time, however, I'll use equal amounts of olive oil and molasses and cut the amount of sauce in half, because I had a little bit too much left over for the size of the fillets.  Other than that, fabulous!

I used honey instead of molasses because I didn't have any on hand, used lime in place of lemon peel,  and added a little salt as well.

This is a delicious meal worth repeating.  I had wild salmon from Costco that was skin-on, so when I BBQ'd it I only did just the skin side down.  I finished it off with a little more of the glaze under the broiler to get the top done, too.  I admit that I used 1/3 cup olive oil, and then, because I was a little leery hubby-wise, I only used half of the 1/3 cup using molasses and the other half of that honey.  It really did need salt and pepper.  I will make this again and marinate it a while before cooking it, and I will use the whole 1/3 cup using molasses next time.  I think I will also add a little of the lemon juice to the mix.  When you think of it, I really didn't change the ingredients much in the recipe because the mixture is a good one.  Thanks, Naomi!

I enjoyed this very much. I've been looking for a sweet salmon glaze. A restaurant used to have a maple pecan glazed salmon that I miss very much. I grilled the salmon on planks. Very yummy.

What a quick and delicious meal.  I used honey instead of molasses and doubled the garlic.  I cooked the fish under the broiler instead of on the grill.  (Baby, it's cold outside!)  I'll definitely make this dish again.

I tried this exactly as written. I think that's only fair if I'm going to rate a recipe.  We really did like the salmon, but there just wasn't a huge amount of taste from the glaze.  I gave it five stars anyway because we did enjoy it.  Overall, good recipe.

This was the best! I substituted honey for molasses.  I also cut the oil and honey to 1/4 cup and it was plenty!! Great salmon-- it gives it a nice glaze/crust.

The whole family loved this recipe -- the 9 year old, 14 year old, and 35 year old!  Like other reviewers, I also switched out the Molasses for pure maple syrup, which I think was a very good choice.

Since it is not grilling weather where I live, I broiled the salmon instead. It was excellent and very easy for workday evening! The only change I made was to substitute 3 t. of lemon juice for the lemon peel because I was out of lemon peel.

I made this tonight. I substituted honey for molasses since I didn't have any molasses. It was excellent.

Instead of cooking on the grill, I've made this in a pan as well as baked in the oven. Excellent both ways, and my boyfriend HATES fish and seafood but eats this with no complaints.

This recipe came in my email today and made me feel like making salmon for dinner. Cooked this dish as shown and it was great.  To make this dish even better use a 1/2 of the fresh lemon juice in the sauce.  Delicious!!!

I was really crunched for time, so I made this even easier by using garlic powder and lemon juice. I also added a little salt. I cooked it on a George Foreman grill on my kitchen counter. It was still a raging success and, not kidding, it took 10 minutes from start to finish.

Unfortunately, I didn't like the flavor all that much.  I think it was the molasses I didn't care for.  Maybe I should have tried honey like the other people.

I am not a fan of salmon, but made this recipe for guests that are and it was a huge hit.  And it looked very pretty, the glaze caramalized nicely.

Made this tonight for dinner. Very very good. No changes. I made sure to whisk the marinade until it was emulsified and I made sure that the salmon was dry before basting. No trouble with the marinade sliding off and my family says this one is a 'keeper'.

Hmm I don't know about this one. Maybe I made it wrong. I thought there was too much oil in the glaze. I didn't season it correctly, so maybe that's why it didn't taste amazing. But my family liked it, although they made salmon burgers to that affects the taste. I might try it again with less oil.Thanks

Too oily. I added more garlic as recommended but all you could take was the olive oil. If I try this again, and I doubt I will, I would cut down the oil.

I loved this! I adjusted it to 2 servings. My wife, who does not eat any fish with the exception of Shrimp, said it smelled real good. It does hide the Salmon taste a bit I thought. But that might be a really good thing for anyone who doesn't love the taste of fish, like kids. It's a new favorite for me. And I shared it with my Brother-In-Law who is struggling with grilling fish. I want to get together with them for a Bar-B-Que and do some Salmon Grilled this way. I used bottled minced garlic for mine. Deelish! Thank You Naomi!

Love Love Love this recipe!  I cooked this for my husband for our One Year Anniversary!  We love salmon to begin with so I am always trying different glazes and whatnot.  I also substituted honey for molasses, which tasted great.  Thanks so much!

Used honey instead of molasses and lime instead of lemon. Ommitted the rind because I forgot. I felt like my salmon was thicker in one part and there was not enough sauce to cover it. Other than that very good, but could have been better if I used the correct portion of ingrediants

My husband won't eat any type of fish - he actually tried this and he loved it!  I did replace the molasses with honey as other recommended.  Used the extra glaze for a salad dressing.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe was a perfect summer treat for my husband and I! great on the grill with some potatoes and peas. Changed some things as other users did: 1/4 cup honey, 1/3 cup olive oil, few pinches of dill weed, sea salt, and dried parsley, 2 tsp minced fresh garlic, and about 2 tsp of frozen squeezed lemon juice. I basted these bad boys and kept them moist the whole time (about 15 minutes). I used thawed frozen slamon and they came out moist and flaky. Thanks for a great quick and easy recipe!

This glaze was wonderful! although the serving suggestion states that there will be plenty left over for dipping sauce, there isn't. So next time i am going make extra. Other than that this recipe is great..i couldn't have gotten salmon this good for this price anywhere!

I finally tried this and I agree with many of the reviewers, molasses is a bit too bold of a flavor to pair with delicate salmon.  But I wouldn't hesitate to try some of the modifications suggested, such as using honey instead of molasses.  My all time favorite no-fail salmon glaze is quite simple: real maple syrup, soy sauce, and garlic... measure to your liking.

I rated this recipe three stars not because the recipe was bad but just because I didn't particularly care for the molasses flavor. I was eager to experiment with a new way to sweeten up salmon with something other than honey or brown sugar, but neither my boyfriend or I were a big fan of the molasses flavor. Also, a note to other cooks, use fresh lemon zest not what comes in the jar, it's definitely not flavorful enough! 
This recipe was not bad, and you may like it if you enjoy molasses, but for me personally it needs something a little more. Good idea, and good luck! =)

didn't have a grill, but cooked it on a cookie sheet with aluminum foil at 350.  put it in with the sauce on and brushed once with sauce.  

cooked it until barely flaky and it ended up sooooo juicy, melted in our mouths (nice change since im well known for my dry salmon bricks : )

didnt have a grater so i chopped lemon peel.  our garlic had sprouted so i used garlic powder and somehow we survived ; )

the molasses and lemon zest play well together!

The glaze tended to overpower the fish... I'll try the version with maple syrup rather than molasses next time and see what that does for us.

This was surprisingly bland when grilled with the glaze, but when I added the reserved glaze, and some salt, it really perked up the flavor.

My son love it...it turned out great.  I seasoned the salmon to my taste and then followed the directions for the glaze.  I place the salmon on my George Forman grill for 3 mins then I place the glaze on it for about another min.   LOVED IT !!!  Thanks..very quick and easy.

I think the marinade may have tasted good ... if it hadn't slid right off the fish and into the grill (too oily, maybe?). I made it with the 1/2 cup olive oil and split the 1/3 cup into a 50/50 mix of honey and molasses.  It smelled good, and proved to be an excellent fuel source for a very dramatic fire.  There were flames shooting out the back of my grill!  Luckily I had pulled the salmon off just moments before, and it was fine (albeit somewhat bland).

I like that it was a very simple recipe but it was just so-so.  I found the mixture was hard to mix properly and kept separating and would slide off the salmon.  My family ate it without complaining but I don't think I will make it again.

I absolutely loved this. I have never enjoyed salmon so much. The only change I made was adding a couple drops of juice from the lemon in addition to the zest. It just seemed to need a bit of a boost for the citrus taste to be detected.

I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did. It was great to have lots of extra sauce to serve.

It seems that many reviewers substituted honey for molasses. I suspect that would result in a very different flavor. Honey is much sweeter and lighter than the deep tones of molasses.

I use maple syrup, seal the salmon in foil and bake it at 375 for 35-45 min.

I always read reviews first and did cut back on the oil.  I like using half molasses and half honey or maple syrup and I add a little bit of the juice from the lemon. I cut the salmon into chunks put them in a container with half the sauce and let marinate for 15 mins.  Then I pan fry quickly and serve with veggies I stir fried.   I use the saved marinade for the other veggies. It gets a beautiful golden brown color and tastes yummy!

Very yummy on the grill. Kept skin on one side of fish one time. Turned out fine.

Flavors were good, but the molasses and the oil don't hold together at all and the sauce doesn't really coat the salmon.

This was ok not the best. My husband hates salmon and he said it was ok.  I think the oil needs to be cut in half
