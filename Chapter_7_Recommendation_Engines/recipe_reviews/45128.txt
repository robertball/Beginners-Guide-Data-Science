Wow! This was very good.  I sauteed the garlic along with the onion then added the crushed red pepper flakes.  After adding the crushed tomatoes I added 1 Tbsp. of basil, 1/4 tsp. of oregano, 1 tsp. of parsley, 1/2 tsp. of salt and 2 tsp. of sugar.  I also used a good vodka and half and half instead of light cream and parmesan instead of romano (didn't have any on hand). I used 1/2 pound of penne pasta and served this with garlic breadsticks.  The sauce was even better the next day!

This was absolutely wonderful.  We had invited some friends over and I was looking for vegetarian recipes.  It was a hit with everyone!  I had calculated for 12 people and was afraid there wouldn't be enough when I saw the amount of sauce.  I did use only one 1/2 boxes of Penne Pasta but had more than enough for everyone.

Very good and simple recipe. I used half and half instead of cream to cut on fat. Served over whole wheat penne and some fresh basil.

This was easy and excellent. I didn't have 2 hours for it to simmer and it was delicious after only about 10 minutes of cooking. Added some extra red pepper flakes because we like it spicy. Also added some vegetables to the pasta: greens, chopped fennel, and zucchini. delicious!!

I actually did add about 2 TBLS of chopped fresh basil and 1 tablespoon of sugar to cut the acid of the tomatoes.  Not sure but I think I made it better!!  Really good.

My husband and I enjoyed this rich sauce, but the kids found it too heavy. They preferred Penne with Pink Vodka Sauce from this site. If you make this, add 1 tsp. each of basil, oregano, and sugar.

This was a great vegetarian entr√©e. The red pepper flakes really made this dish work for me. I think next time I'll add some basil and a bit more vodka since I couldn't taste any... and it is a vodka sauce. One tip: don't get cheap vodka! Good vodka = good vodka sauce.

This recipe was so easy to make.  I used parmesam cheese instead of romano and it still turned out wonderful!  I only had heavy cream, i definately recommend using light cream, it was very rich.

Sooooo good.  Easy is right.....this sauce took no time to make....I was a lil nervous about a whole 1/2c of vodka since I have never made this kind of sauce before....but...it was perfect..I did use fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the light cream... to cut the fat.  Glad I tried this....family enjoyed!!! Served with garlic bread and a salad. Thanks!

Mercy this is good! Wish we could rate with more than 5 stars!! Like a previous reviewer, add a bit of sugar. Tweak it a little everytime I make it (which is often - especially good on gnocchi!) Made a chunky version by adding 1/2 chopped green pepper and using petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed. Cooked the tomatoes and other veggies, then stirred in the vodka in the last 5 minutes, then stirring in fat free half and half at the last minute just til it's heated through. Cut the calories, but same taste and texture as the cream. Can't wait til summer to try it with fresh tomatoes!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!

I doubled this recipe for the 8 of us and had plenty of sauce.  I used butter in place of the olive oil and added some fresh parsley and basil.  I used lactose free half and half as well as dairy free Parmesan cheese.  I added a few tablespoons of dairy free cream cheese just to thicken it up a little.  Delicious, simple and better than what I had in a restaurant recently.

Everyone thought this sauce was good.  I liked adding the romano cheese it was different.  I would make it again but this doesn't taste anything like penne a la vodka from an Italian Restaurant in NYC that's for sure. Plus I took the advice from other reviews and added 2 tsp of sugar.  Next time I will do 1 tsp but it def needed sugar.   Also next time i will try a little less vodka

This sauce is really good! I used about 1/4 c heavy cream, and the rest fat free half and half. A little extra vodka, and doctored it up with basil, parsley, and oregano. For me, adding a few packs of splenda is a must. It cuts the acid and gives a hint of sweetness. Served this with sliced chicken breast.

Hmm...the Vodka sauce I've had was really good with just a HINT of vodka. I might try this recipe again but only putting in half-3/4's of the vodka...This burned my throat and mouth. The smell on the stove was not good. I love vodka! Just not this sauce. I ended up putting meat and veggies in and trying to mask the  taste. It still was strong just didn't burn. Anyhow, sorry. Just too much vodka

My family's absolute favorite and super easy.  I add spicy Italian sausage, increase the red pepper by 1/4 tsp, and substitute half and half for cream. Sometimes I double and freeze half, as it always freezes well.

This is a great recipe. It was easy to make and I made a few changes to make it a hardier main course.  
I added  1/4lb Pancetta, sliced thin then chopped, and 3 oz. of Hot Italian Sausage.  I cooked it thoroughly, with the onions, garlic and red pepper flakes.   The pancetta and sausage  I used had virtually no grease so I did not drain off any oils that remained after cooking.  I also added 2 to 3 tablespoons more vodka.  With the addition of the pancetta and sausage,  I did not add any salt or pepper.   
After the sauce came to a boil, I transferred it to my slow cooker and let it cook on low for about 3-4 hours.  When everyone was home and ready for dinner I cooked the pasta, added it to the sauce and then served it.  My gage to tell how good the recipe was is whether or not my husband goes back for seconds, something he rarely does.  Not only did he go back for seconds, he took leftovers for lunch the next day.

Never had vodka sauce before, but will have it again. I added a couple of slices of uncooked bacon (as some other recipes call for) and a pinch of sugar, and used San Marzano tomatoes.  Let it cook for the full 2 hrs. Yum!

Tried this for the first time and it turned out terrible! It does not even come close to being a vodka sauce. I did not understand why the cream and cheese was added so early. Bringing it to a boil curdled the cream. Adding the cheese and simmering for two hours just makes the pan a real mess to clean.

Yum! I changed up a few things. I had a large can of crushed tomatoes with basil but I still added some fresh basil at the end. I didn't cook this as long as listed. My family doesn't think a meal is complete w/o a meat so I did add some sauteed chicken breast. For the light cream I used a little half and half and a few tablespoons of low fat cream cheese. They have some great new high protein/whole wheat pastas out there now that I used. Thank you for sharing your recipe, my family loved it!

oh boy, I'm having a very difficult time choosing the perfect Vodka Sauce. This is delish.  I did sprinkle fresh basil over when serving when I read another reviewer who added some. I also find that using crushed tomatoes in these recipes really reduces the risk of being too acidic.

This is absolutely wonderful. I have used this recipe about 20 time since I saw it here. I use it for all parties I host especially the holidays. A bowl of penne before the main course. It's a big hit.

Excellent recipe - I have made this numerous times and it is always a winner! Definitely let it simmer for the two hours, it makes a difference as at the flavors really meld at the end and the resulting sauce is so complex and flavorful. While it is absolutely delicious exactly as the recipe is written, like most cooks, I have made some small changes. Sometimes it tastes like it just needs 'something' and I have found that adding one chicken bouillon cube (I live abroad so I use either Magi or Knorr) durning the last 30min gives it a little more depth without making it taste chicken-y.  I also use whipping/heavy cream, add 2-3 bay leaves and increase the vodka to one cup. This is fab vegetarian, but with whole Italian sausage I imagine it would be incredible. I have found this to be an excellent recipe, super easy and impressive. Like most sauces, it is even better the next day!!

Really good. I wasn't impressed with the way it smelled while cooking but thank goodness the taste was great. I did add a little sugar to it to cut the acid from the tomato. This one's a keeper.

I've made this a few times with these minor changes:  I use crushed tomatoes with italian herbs, half and half,  1/3 cup vodka and use freshly grated Parmesan cheese added about 15 -30 minutes before serving.  I serve this on cheese tortellini with italian sausage, garlic bread and salad.  I also add about a teaspoon of sugar.   Yum!

In a word...awesome. My boyfriend has been talking about vodka sauce for two years. We've tried sauces at restaurants, but he always seemed disappointed. So i set out to please him myself and thanks to this recipe I hit the nail on the head. The only thing I added was 1lb of lean ground turky and served it was Falfalle pasta. It was delicious.
