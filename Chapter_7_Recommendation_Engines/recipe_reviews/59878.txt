There are some errors in this recipe, I have contacted All Recipes but will put the correct measurements here until they can get around to getting it fixed. Everything else is the same just the amounts.  1 Bottle of Bernsteins Italian dressing   3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/3 Cup Soy Sauce 4 to 6 Tablespoons Brown Sugar 10 Cloves of Pressed Garlic       1 Teaspoon Dry Mustard 1 Teaspoon Ground Ginger  This recipe is the best. Our family also uses this for steak. We tend to let it sit in the fridge for a few days turning it once a day to move around  the seasonings. Keep a spray bottle near the grill because this flares up sometimes. Enjoy!

Easy and tasty.  I decreased the ingredients to marinate 1 lb of chicken thighs:  1/2 cup italian dressing, 1 tbsp worcestershire, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp minced garlic and 1 tsp minced ginger.

Yum, yum, yum! This was THE BEST marinade! I marinated for a day and a half, but instead of grilled, I roasted the chicken in the oven..the skin came out nice a crispy with an amazing flavor! My husband even said this was the best chicken i've ever made, and I cook a lot! I can't say enough how wonderful this marinade is.

This recipe was awesome! Such a simple marinade with ingrediants I always have on hand. I am not a fan of ginger, so I left it out and it still tasted great. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts...grilled 8 minutes on each side. They were so juicy and yummy! I ate mine with brown rice & corn on the cob. My husband ate later in the day, so his were cold over salad and he said they were delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

Good marinade! All the ingredients I keep on hand. I did 1/2 the recipe for 5 large chicken breasts and only needed about 1/2 bottle of dressing. Only had time to marinate for about 6 hrs but will try for overnight next time. Do be careful grilling because it does tend to burn in areas. Overall good recipe.

Loved this! I halved this, used a Good Seasons Italian Dressing packet, added the ingredients called for here, then added the liquids called for plus a 1/2 cup water, then I drizzled in the oil (called for on the package) and mixed with an emmulsion blender to emulsify. After marinating, I boiled a cup of the marinade and basted with it. Be sure to grill over indirect heat, even then, the skin may blacken but the chicken will be tender and moist. Take off the grill, baste lightly one last time, cover with foil and let rest 10 minutes before serving. Oh so good!!

Best chicken marinade around. Sometimes I premix a batch, jar it and stick it in the fridge. Then I just pour some over a couple chicken breasts before leaving for work. Easy and flavorful chicken dinner.

Great marinade!  I only had two hours to marinate the chicken, but it still turned out delicious.  I do believe that this is our new favorite chicken marinade!

I thought this was awesome.  Used boneless skinless breasts and only had time to marinade for a couple hours, but it was very good.  Don't think I used as much brown sugar as the recipe called for, and used a olive oil and vinegar dressing since I didn't have Italian.  Perfect mixture of flavors and the chicken turned out remarkably flavorful and tender without any one ingredient being too overwhelming.  I plan to make this for a birthday bbq coming up soon.

It was pretty good. I used this to marinate both chicken and beef steak. We much preferred it with the beef. Definitely won't use it for chicken again, though.

ehh.. wasn't great, wasn't worth making again. I used revised measurements, marinated for a day and a half. I will say the chicken was very moist, the taste for our family was nothing overwhelming, nothing "must make again".

I only marinated my chicken in this for 2 hours, and it was still good. It probably would have been better if I marinated it longer.I will make it again, just marinate it overnight.

We thought this dish was great partially due to the fact that we did not discard the marinade. I used my stove top grill pan to give my bird legs those nice stripes, placed the meat in a roasting pan, poured the marinade over and finished it off in the oven. End result was some really moist chicken with a very nice side sauce. Good work Jenna!

Very good marinade.  I liked the balance between the tangy dressing and the sweet brown sugar.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and they came out tender and juicy.  Thanks for sharing.

This was okay. My son liked it a lot, my DH said it was too sweet and it had a twang he didn't care for. Due to the  weather, this sat in the marinade for two days instead of overnight. I used boneless chicken breasts.

This makes a great BBQed chicken.   It's not  completely soy sauce based like so many chicken marinades.   It's hard to find a recipe that specifies bone-in chicken like this one.   It's the way I prefer to grill.   The recipe makes a LOT.   I think you could double the chicken (to 8 lbs) if you wanted to.   As written, the chicken is swimming in the marinade.   The only change I made was to add 1/4 cup of olive oil because the Italian dressing I used was fat free.   I will make this one again.

Loved this marinade!  Hubs grilled chicken to perfection, it was so moist and flavorful.  I halved the recipe for three b/s chix breast halves.  Then I prepared as written, with the exception of using some A1 sauce and a smear of anchovy paste in place of the worcestershire sauce (out!).  This is a definite do-over, thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Made this tonight and found that the marinade did not permiate the chicken and was pretty bland. In addition the grill time was nearly double the amount listed. I think I will look for another marinade next time.

This chicken was incredible! I used the 2nd set of instructions, used boneless Perdue chicken, marinaded about 12 hours and cooked in in a pan, and it was phenomenal! My wife is EXTREMELY picky, and she LOVED IT!

This recipe is quick, simple and delicious. I marinaded some chicken thighs and legs for a family vacation, then grilled them, and they were a huge hit.

Tasty and easy. I made 1/3 recipe, and after tasting it I found it a little bland. I doubled the brown sugar, since I was in the mood for a sweeter sauce, and I added some extra garlic. I marinaded boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into generously sized chicken tenders, for about six hours. I cooked the tenders 3-4 min a side. Very good and it kept the chicken moist.

i implemented SMILEJENNA's corrected version of this recipe to marinate an oversized boneless skinless breast (well over one pound) that i butterflied.. bf grilled this on the gas grill on our Island Grillstone.. i cooked up the leftover marinade and basted the finished product.. so delicious! bf said it reminded him of a less tart heinz 57.. i'm in agreement as my first thought was a mustard based bbq sauce.. here are our amounts/measurements: 1/4 c italian dressing, 1 T brown sugar, 4 t soy sauce, 2 t worcestershire, 1.5 t fresh grated ginger, 1/4 t garlic powder and 1/4 t dried mustard.. ty for the recipe! this is definitely a do over

This was good but didn't wow me. I'd make it again, but would probably try something else first.

Insanely good! I used zesty Italian because that's what I had on hand. Also only had time to marinate it for 1.5 hours. Will definitely make again!

Hmm... maybe I did something wrong but the worcestershire sauce is just too strong for me. the chicken ended up tasting way too tangy. :(

Very good! I cut way back on the Worcestershire sauce because the flavour can be a little much sometimes, I think. I probably used only a couple tsps. Very yummy!

Halved the marinade for 1lb of boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Let everything combine in a ziploc bag for a couple of days.  Good flavor, but we prefer other marinated grilled chicken recipes.

This marinade was very good, we made some delicious sandwiches with the chicken, adding grilled mushrooms, onions, barbecue sauce, and cheese.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but added a little extra worcestershire sauce and used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I also used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of bone-in chicken.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the great marinade!
