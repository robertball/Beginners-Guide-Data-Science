Can't go wrong with Brussels sprouts, bacon and garlic and as this recipe's first reviewer I'm happy  to report that experienced and novice cooks alike can prepare this with confidence as the submitter has the preparation down pat.  (Forgot to sprinkle these with the Parmesan.  Too bad, I really would have liked that!)

Always a favorite in my house. Here are my changes,  my sprouts were so big, I quartered them,  I sliced the bacon prior to cooking it and saut√©ed it with the onion. When it was 3/4 of the way done,  I added the brussel sprouts, covered and let it all cook till done. 
So good, served it with Becca's Accidental Fish and steamed white rice.

I love bacon and brussel sprouts so just wanted to see how others prepared it. Garlic seems a natural addition, just wondering why it wasn't included in the directions. ??

Easy and tasty. Only change was two dashes of Cayenne. Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe! Disappeared quickly from the dinner table. It took a bit longer for me to get the brussel sprouts to brown then the recipe said but otherwise I kept everything the same.

This is delicious.. It's also super easy.. I received 3 stalks of fresh Brussels sprouts &  had no idea how I was going to cook them for Thanksgiving. We had bacon and the onions were already out, threw this together & everyone loved it. The one thing that had no leftovers.

A group of my friends planned a grownup girls PJ party. We intended to introduce one of the ladies to a variety of veggie dishes, in hopes of encouraging her to take pleasure in eating them. It was kind of a veggie eating intervention. Each of us brought a veggie dish. I had been wanting to try a Brussels sprout recipe I had, but when the time came, I couldn't find it. I made this recipe instead. It was a huge hit! All of the ladies went back for seconds & thirds. This recipe will convert even the most avid veggie hater. ENJOY,

Delicious!  I steamed the Brussel Sprouts first because my family does not like hard cooked veggies.  They were devoured completely  before the meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make these weekly since even the smallest  children licked their plates clean.  The only complaints I heard were "cook more Mom the next time"!!!

I did add the garlic to the onion during the saute part.  I think that was what was left out of the directions.  I find Brussel sprouts bitter but you have to have the bacon and onion with each sprout to really get the full effect.
