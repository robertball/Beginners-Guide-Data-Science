Delicious! This worked out great because I had a lot of leftover cheeses from a meat/cheese tray that we had on New Year's Eve. I did sub smoked cheddar for the smoked provolone b/c that's what I had but everything else was just as is. I didn't have soft pretzels on hand so we just used regular pretzels and that was fine but I can't wait to get to the store to get some soft pretzels. Really great combo of flavors...I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

This was delicious. I made soft pretzels to go with it and everything was gone by the end of of the night. Personal preference: I'd add more beer to make the cheese just a touch thinner but the flavor was on point. I will definitely make this again!

Maybe I messed it up. But it was really difficult to keep the proper consistency and it just tasted like it was missing something. A few people liked it and a few people didn't.

It came out perfect with a smooth creamy texture. I don't normally drink beer but the one I used was labeled a brown ale and described as "a toasty fall seasonal beer" I think it gave it a really rich flavor. So good with big soft pretzels! Made a large amount and good for a crowd

Definitely a keeper! I didn't have gouda so I used sharp cheddar and added more beer to keep it thinner per other recommendations. So tasty!

The texture turned out nice but the flavor needed tweaking for my tastes. I recommend starting with less Worcestershire and adding it after you’ve tasted, because you might have pretty salty cheeses. I also added a little cayenne and smoked paprika. “4 slices” is a vague descriptor, but I assumed it would be about 4 oz and that seemed right.

Made exactly as directed (I only subbed swiss instead of gouda cause I had it) and it was fantastic! Fair warning it does make A LOT. Like 3x what we needed for a party of 10 people. I made it as a dipping sauce for some sausage cheese balls. It is so delicious that I'm glad there's so much leftover. Now I can make soft pretzels to finish it off. Maybe I'll share. Next time I will try the suggestions to add more beer to thin it out more like a sauce though I thought the consistency as-is was fine for a dip.

This came out creamy and perfect! I used Patagonia Pilsner for the beer. I used the full 8oz of cream cheese, the spicier horseradish (same qty though), and Frenches mustard instead of dried. I will make again!!!
