I read the reviews for this recipe before I made them.  I figured with so little ingredients try them and if they aren't good I am not out too much.  I rolled them into large walnut shaped balls and pressed a fork with sugar in a crosscut pattern.  I baked them for almost 15 minutes and they did not burn.  I asked Husband to rate them.  For him it was a definite 10.  I then proceeded to ask each our our four sons who also gave it a 10.  After the first batch I decided to flatten them more and sprinkle with sugar.  They cooked much quicker.  I have found with this cookie cook them till the top turns slightly white.  let them cool for 5 minutes then transfer to plate or platter.  Ours made 20 cookies.  I ended up making another batch a little later in the evening and made a BIG cookie with chocolate chips pressed into the cookie.  It made 1 pizza pan sized cookie.  Thanks for the great and easy Recipe.  I will definitely make this one again.

for those of you adding baking soda, etc. - those recipes are also on allrecipes, so you're kind of rating the wrong recipe. For a THREE INGREDIENT PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE this recipe is perfect. If you want more than 3 ingredients, go to another recipe for peanut butter cookies.

Great cookies!  I added a splash of vanilla, a small pinch of baking soda and a little salt and they turned out delicious.  Without the additions, they tasted a little off.  With the baking soda, the cookies really spread out!  I also baked them for a total of 12 minutes this time around, and found that I liked them better this way.

FINALLY a peanut butter cookie recipe that I'll eat and ENJOY!!  Peanut butter is probably my favorite food but until today, I never much liked PB cookies because of their dry, crunchy texture that left you gasping for milk.  This recipe was PERFECT and SOOOO easy!!  I felt like a snack today so I halved the recipe-- used 1/2 cup sugar and PB and used only the egg WHITE from an egg (cut out some extra fat and cholesterol).  I rolled the dough into balls and then smooshed them with a fork in the classic criss-cross pattern, baked them for 11 minutes at 350 and let them cool on the sheet for like 3-5 minutes (more like three because I couldn't wait to try them).  The half batch made 9 decent-sized cookies-- perfect for two people.  I'll only use this recipe from now on... it was moist, peanutbuttery and QUICK!  THANK YOU!!

Recipes like this were popular at the start of the low carb diet phase, many even taking it a step further by using a sugar substitute--I was willing to give it a try but my taste buds objected! The texture is unpleasant and the taste disagreeable. There is no substitute for a good, old-fashioned tradional peanut butter cookie, and in this case I think I would have much preferred a spoonful of peanut butter out of the jar.

Reading the instructions on this I see she did not mention you should flatten cookies with a criss cross fork action, I think that would help on the overwhelming peanut butter taste, because it makes them more crispy, and also it DOES only take 8-10 minutes this way...no uncooked peanut butter...they are SOOOO good!!! I make them for Christmas every year, to give out to the neighbors....

Boy, did this recipe make my husband happy. I wanted to make him a treat at 10 o'clock at night and came browsing around this site. He LOVES peanut butter so i searched PB recipes. I printed a few but chose to make this one.  His favorite treat is peanut butter cookies and he loved these more! It's like eating peanut butter out of the jar but in cookie form. THANKS so much for the great recipe, Francie! 

Just be sure to let them cool on the sheet completely before trying to remove!

So fast and easy to make AND they taste great too...that equals five stars in my books!  Read the reviews and used half brown and half white sugars, 2 tbsp of flour and a splash of vanilla, and rolled the balls in sugar before flattening with a fork and baking on parchment paper for about 15 minutes until they were a golden brown colour.  I let them cool completely on the parchment and they are crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle...perfection!  Will make again and again...next time I'll add some chocolate chips!

I love these cookies, we have been making them for years.  We called them "Impossible Peanut Butter Cookies".  The only change we make is a tiny splash of vanilla and we barely dip our fork into flour and make the criss-cross on the cookies.  My daughter is now 20 and has been making them since she was little!  Great recipe!

Pretty good cookie. Dense and loaded with peanut buttery flavor, which is almost a bit too intense for my tastebuds, but...come on, it is a Three Ingredient cookie. I'm not expecting Martha Stewart or Rachel Ray cookies. Which bring me to the point of knuckleheads adding extra ingredients to this, before even trying it as-is, and then whining and rating the original recipe poorly. I despise you kind of people. Please, shoo. I have more respect for the people rate the recipe low because they are use to junk food cookies being stuff into their mouths.

I made a batch of this cookie mix for the church ladies last week and they about passed out from sugar coma.  I like the kind with flour in them much better and don't mind having more than three ingredients since I can count higher than most people. Evelyn

I've used this recipe for years and have always enjoyed it!  Easy and quick. (However, I thought my friend made it up...oh well.)  I press the cookie mix into a small casserole pan and bake for about 20 minutes.  After I take it out of the oven, I pour a bag of (milk chocolate) chips over the top and spread.  When cool I cut into bars.  Yum!

These pb cookies were delicious! I used splenda instead of sugar and added vanilla, baking soda, and salt. I also added raisins and sliced almonds, they came out great!

I got this same recipe from a book of 5 ingredients or less cookbook. They or so quick and easy. Everyone seems to love them. I have found that the cookies have better texture if you combined the egg and sugar together first then add the  PB.  Always have these 3 ingredients on hand.

I found this recipe a couple years ago, and now it is my GO-TO recipe for peanut butter cookies.  Of course, I've memorized it :-).  So simple, so delicious, forgiving, and easy to make variations!  Love, love, love this!

This recipe tastes exactly like what the ingredients call for--basically peanut butter and sugar.  It is VERY peanut buttery...so if you're a big fan of scooping out spoonfuls of peanut butter and eating them raw, then this recipe is for you!  If not, then I suggest you stick to a more traditional peanut butter cookie recipe.  I must add that it IS a really easy recipe though...great for kids!

These cookies were a huge let-down!  The texture was very grainy, and that is not what I was expecting.  I will continue to search for the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe!

I thought these were wonderful cookies for so few ingredients. I bake mine for 10 minutes and I also add 1/4 cup flour for a little more of a bite.  Also, occasionally I press a chocolate kiss into the tops of the cookies as soon as they come out of the oven; makes for a yummy cookie as well :-)

I actually heard about this recipe a couple of years ago from a friend and never made them. I know many people that did and raved about them. So I finally looked up the recipe here and and read the reviews. i did take the suggestions from other reviewers and added some vanilla, a few pinches of baking powder, and a little salt. I also only did 1/2 cup white sugar, about 1/4 cup brown sugar and some honey. I added some chocolate spinkles for the kids too. O rolled into balls, pushed down with a fork once one way, once the other way. I pushed on m&m into the top for decoration and baked it until the corners were starting to brown. I took them off of the pan right away and onto a cooling rack. They were soft but with a spatula they were easy enough to pick up and slide onto the rack. They were good warm but much better later that evening and the next day. My kids loved them, they taste very peanut buttery and not overly sweet. Very soft and a little chewy, good texture. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone, though I would add the couple of things to it if you have it. Im sure the original recipe was great as well since my friends have raved about them.

We tried these last night for a quick treat.  I figured if they didn't turn out, there wasn't much to lose with just 3 ingredients and 5 minutes, but we ended up being very pleasantly surprised.  Instead of parchment paper I used cooking spray and it seemed to be just fine, but don't move the cookies until they've cooled sufficiently or they will crumble into oblivion:).  I added added a pinch of baking soda and the first batch we baked for 10 minutes and ate still warm-they were VERY tasty but SUPER crumbly.  The second batch we baked for only 8 minutes and *actually let them cool* and they set up to crispy on the edges and chewy in the center- So good!  My family devoured them even when they were crumbly!

Disappointing....the cookies turned out too flat even with the baking soda and these burn very easily - was just peanut butter taste. Don't make if you aren't a fan.  Wouldn't make this again.

Very good and easy. Not my favorite peanut butter cookie recipe but you can't beat the taste for how easy it is. I cut the sugar a bit but would have been fine with all the sugar. I think the people that say it is crumbly may be using natural peanut butter or reduced fat. Neither would work in this recipe I think.

This is the easiest cookie to make and taste delicious. I make them all the time and have never had an issue. You do have to flatten down prior to putting them in the oven, but that is normal for a peanut butter cookie.My only hint is take out of the oven, wait five minutes before you remove from the sheet as they do break apart when hot hot.  I throw in chocolate chips (1/2 - 1 Cup semi sweet) and my mouth explodes in yummyness.
A MUST try!  What other cookie can be put together and cooked in 15 minutes or less depending on how fast your oven heats?

Wow! I made peanut butter cookies awhile back for the first time and they ended up terrible..These right here are by far the easiest and best pb cookies! I can't wait to make with my little girls.. I followed the recipe as exactly written.. But I didn't have parchment paper so I used a cookie sheet ...WINNER!!

When making these with my 8y/o daughter we found we only had 3/4cups of peanut butter, so we used Nutella for the other 1/4 cup and they came out delicious!  Perfect starter recipe for kids wanting help out in kitchen.

As written, these cookies don't come out like traditional peanut butter cookies, but they still taste good, and you can't beat the simplicity of this recipe.

What a horrid mess. I have recipes for peanut butter cookies, but wanted one that was more peanut-buttery. Figuring this was the solution, I decided to give it a try. I make cookies once a week and never again will I make these. They were way too wet and burnt before they got dry enough to lift with the spatula. With the remaining dough, I baked it on the top rack of my oven to try and avoid the burning issue. Same story, burnt before dry enough to lift.

My family loves this recipe especially my 7 year old who is gluten intolerant.  We have also used Almond butter instead of peanut butter and coconut palm sugar to make it low carb.  Great either way

These are SO GOOD!  I followed other reviewers and added 1 tsp baking soda and a little vanilla.  My husband and daughter (who helped me make them!) were both big fans too.  It's so simple, I don't know why you would ever bother with a more involved recipe!

wow! these were pretty delicious. i've had better peanut butter cookies but that's not to say these aren't great! i was pleasantly surprised. mmm, they sort of just melt in your mouth. they are crumbly, but whatever, you know? i imagine chocolate chips would be amazing in these...

I just took these out of the oven after 12 minutes of baking.  They are crumbly and don't hold up to even eat without making a royal mess.  I did use Splenda as a sugar sub, but others have done without issue.  Not sure what happened b/c I followed exaclty otherwise.  Will never try again.

I used natural crunchy peanut butter (no sugar no salt), SPLENDA Brown sugar baking blend (use 1/2 as much as sugar)as well as added vanilla and 4 heaping TBS white flour-they are delicious and lovely and not to mention FAST!  If you're having a peanut butter craving for more than just peanut butter off the spoon, MAKE THESE COOKIES!!!

But DON'T drop by teaspoon, I rolled into balls and criss-crossed a fork in the traditional PB cookie way.

These would also be good rolled in coconut and oats, you could also make them thumprint cookies with strawberry jam-YUM!

I've been making these cookies since I was a kid. But the recipe I had used brown sugar instead of white, and I think it makes the texture better.

Made these last night. I saw other reviews, so I added about 1/8 tsp Baking Soda and 1/2 tsp Vanilla. I also mixed the egg with the sugar before I added the peanut butter. Sprayed cookie sheet with Pam since I didn't have parchment paper.  I rolled the dough into about walnut size balls, and then flattened with a fork before baking. Baked for 9 1/2 min. Left them on cookie sheet until practically cooled. They came out perfect! Wouldn't change a thing! The dough was not too dry and crumbly at all! Will make these for all sorts of gatherings!

These are really good!  I flattened mine with a fork before I cooked them as others suggested.  I also pressed Hersheys Kisses onto half of them right after they came out of the oven.  They were amazing!  My daughter and I liked them better with the Hersheys Kisses and my husband liked them better without.  I will definitely be making these a lot!

I should have read the negative reviews before I baked it. I'm gonna streamline the first part of mine:  Easy?  Check.  Fast?  Kinda...  Good?  Nope.   The dough went together quickly and without much work.  Then I scooped the dough onto the cookie sheet and popped it in the oven.  It  took nearly 15 minutes for my 18 cookies to go from the size of an old dollar coin to the size of a hamburger patty and barely begin to brown.  After they came out of the oven, they deflated.  Several of them  didn't survive the transfer from the pan to the cooling rack in one piece.  They taste okay, but they're so ugly and crumbly I wouldn't dare serve them to anyone else or admit to having baked them.

While these cookies were put together in a flash, I only found one problem. Mixing 'til smooth. My mix was crumbly, but when pressed together, they held shape. So I used a small cookie scooper, to scoop onto the parchment lined cookie sheet. And will say, do NOT go past the 6-8 minute baking time. Other then that, no issues with the overall quickness nor the flavor. I can see making these again. The overall outcome to my family enjoying them, was all that mattered to me. TY

these are easy to make, because you need so little ingredients, but they never turn out right, and always take alot longer than needed. It doesnt mention to squish with fork, should you? And they are never cooked properly. It only bakes they outside also

I have to give this recipe 5 stars because it is the easiest cookie recipe I have ever made. It took me about 5 minutes to mix the ingredients, put them on the pan, and get them in the oven! They were really tasty too! This will definitely be my new peanut butter cookie recipe.

By far the strangest thing I have made.  I give this a three because my husband absolutely loved these cookies.  I found them to be way, way too much.  But it is true, this would be an ideal cookie for a child to help make (or a not so kitchen savvy partner like my husband.)  Be warned these are EXTREMELY peanut buttery.

I must admit that I was very skeptical about this recipe turning out--but the cookies were very good.  Most of the time I am bake-from-scratch cookie baker, but I could never find a peanut butter cookie recipe that was as easy, and tasted as good as my favorite peanut butter cookie mix.  But now I've found it--Thanks for the great recipe!

These were great and really EASY!  I substituted 1 cup brown sugar for the white and also added some instant quaker oats too the mix. They were DELICIOUS and as said very easy. I will make this a regular recipe. GREAT! UPDATE: I just made these again and i substituted 1/2 the sugar for splenda. Also, I added some chocolate ovaltine powder to it and it was good.

I made these cookies, but no one in my family liked them.  Since there's no flour, the cookies were too moist and they were also too sweet and the tatse of peanut butter was too strong; Even my sister who is obsessed with PB hated them.  Also, the recipe says to bake them for 6-8 minutes, but I had to bake them for 12 minutes just for the outside to harden a little bit.  Overall this recipe was not that good.  =(

Don't bake much cookies so not sure if I did something wrong, maybe it's my oven.  Followed recipe exactly but baked on foil lined pans...at 8 mins. my cookies weren't done (doughy).  Baked for another 8-10 minutes and they were done.  Okay flavor but lacked something.

These cookies were very easy to make. However they are too sweet and chewy. I probably won't make this recipe again.

I wouldn't rely on these for when I want to bake my other pb cookies, but if you're looking for a quick snack, this is perfect. Also, incredibly handy because who doesn't have those ingredients on hand. Thank you for sharing!

They were good for a *one time try*, but definitely do not compare to regular cookies. Good for a quick time solution or kids to play with.  I will keep the recipe on file, but do not anticipate making them again.  I didn't like them all that much.

I thought it was great considering the limited ingredients. Not exactly like a traditional peanut butter cookie, but not bad.

Ehh...let's be honest you really can't make decent cookies without more ingredients..these really lacked the depth of flavor that real cookies have, they were really easy make, but I was left with something barely fit to eat.  This recipe won't make it into my recipe box. One word=: Butter!!!

Impressive for only 3 ingredients. These were very rich and creamy tasting. They did crumble easily though and fell apart while trying to eat them. The flavor was very good though and very good for a back up if you are out of flour or other ingredients for the traditional cookie. I had to cook mine for 11 minutes. I used a small cookie scoop to portion them out and flattened with a fork in a criss cross pattern. Thanks.

I love this recipe, I have since begun using brown sugar instead, but original is still 5 stars to me. This is the *only* sweet my son eats. Hes a veggie kid and this keep his calorie intake at a healthy level :)
Question though, where it says 394 per serving, is that correct?

OMG,  This was the best and easiest recipe I have ever had to follow. Fast, easy and a great recipe. I love peanut butter cookies and hate the hassle of making them with all the measuring etc. but not with this recipe. Since everyone else thought it was so wonderful I doubled the recipe and glad I did, my 17 y/o Son ate the first batch before I could get the rest in the oven.

I would give this a 0/5 stars if I could.  They were edible and that was about it.  I love peanut butter and peanut butter cookies and these were the worst cookies I have ever eaten.

These were great. I baked them for 8 mins and they were perfect. I like crunch, so I used crunchy peanut butter, and also added 1/4 mini chocolate morsels. My husband will love these!

these are AWESOME and soooooo fast!!!  I added some brown sugar (about 2 Tbsp) and some vanilla (about 1 tsp). I flattened them with a fork and when I took them out of the oven I sprinkled a bit of sugar over them.  They don't taste like you are eating peanut butter right from the jar to me, and they are less dry than some peanut butter cookie recipes.  I will definately be making these again.   Also, i didn't have parchment paper, so I sprayed pam on the cookie sheet, and they came out perfect.

Perfect My 4 year old did everything... So easy and perfect tasting. As everyone said we used the fork to flatten and checked often to make sure to not over cook.  Nice and soft and tons of flavor... Already passed this on to family :)

I dare say this is my new favorite peanut butter cookie recipe. I can't believe it's this simple. They really surprised me, because I was skeptical at first. They didn't flatten out. Fresh from the oven they have a peanut butter fudge flavor. The next day they taste like normal peanut butter cookies.  I think next time I'll use chunky peanut butter, like another reviewer suggested.   I didn't have parchment paper, and just used non-stick cookiing spray, and it worked perfectly. Also, leave the cookies on the cookie sheet to cool for about 5 minutes or so.

 I added chocolate chips to the dough and made a peanut butter cup cookie.  The possibilities are endless with this easy cookie.

As tasty as they are easy!  I used reduced fat peanut butter, substituted Splenda for half of the sugar, and followed another reviewer's suggestion of adding a pinch each of baking soda and salt.  I rolled each cookie into a ball, flattened them with my thumb, and added a dollop of jam in the center (I think the jam really made the cookies).   Bake time was slightly longer than stated in the instructions and it was definitely necessary to leave the cookies on the sheet to cool for a while.  Texture and flavor were terrific and these couldn't be easier to make!

This is the first peanut butter cookie recipe I have not messed up and how could I--it's so simple and incredibly yummy!  I used JIF peanut butter with honey and took another reviewers advice and added a spash of vanilla extract and a pinch of baking soda.  I baked for 7 minutes and then turned oven off and let cookie sit for 5 minutes before removing them.  Excellent with a cold glass of milk!  Thanks for the easy recipe!

This is the only kind of peanut butter cookie I make now! My only variation is I use 1/2 c. brown sugar and then just under 1/2 c. white sugar and a dash of vanilla and salt. yummy.

These cookies are so easy to make.  I highly recommend them!  I've made them several times and find that it is necessary to let them cool for a minute or 2 before attempting to remove them from the pan.  I've baked them at 350 until the bottoms are browned.  This left the cookies quite soft in the middle.  I've also baked them at 325 until they are slightly browned and they are soft and chewy.  Enjoy!

A friend of mine is allergic to flour so I was looking for a gluten free recipee.  This was perfect.  The cookies were delicious and my friend called back and asked for the recipee.  I also tried them a second time using Splenda sweetner in place of sugar and they were still pretty good.  They were definitely better with the real sugar but without the sugar they are a pretty good protein snack.

these cookies are so peanut buttery delicious!  and so eay, i made them one handed while holding my 3 month old son.... i baked them for ten minutes, and do not try to get them off the baking sheet until they have cooled somewhat, otherwise they will fall apart, when they cool, they made a crunchy, yummy 15 minute-to-make cookie!

Got super ripped and needed something sweet but had almost nothing in my kitchen! Then I came across this little hidden gem… They are fantastic just what I needed.. I added a little cayenne pepper and topped them with some grape and strawberry jellys.. I will make these again.. so much fun..

I used Simply Jif for my peanut butter and prepared these cookies exactly as written except that I didn't have parchment paper so I had to grease the baking sheet. They came out super soft and they became a little more firm once they set after 5 minutes. As many others have said, you have to really love peanut butter to enjoy these cookies because that is what hits you when you eat them. I will make these again but I will use less sugar. They were too sweet for my liking but good flavour.

It was great. I honestly was worried that they would form/ set up right if you will. But they did. What I did is because powder sugar gives it the consistency you would get if you were using flower I used half regular sugar and half powder sugar! They were great. Might make more later today!

These cookies were AMAZING! So simple to make, yet better than several other PB recipes you find online.  What I like best about this recipe, is that it doesn't call for butter or shortening; the oil in the PB has plenty itself!  I added a drizzle of melted chocolate to half of these and they were pretty amazing.  Thanks for the recipe!

So.....i added about a quarter cup of almond meal because the dough was runny not doughy....and a teaspoon of vanilla... this enabled me to roll it into 12 balls right away, put them on the parchment, use the fork criss cross, and baked at 13 minutes (i think the oven was slow). So the net result is YUM and even I can remember the recipe :-)

These were really good. Remember to lightly flatten the cookies before baking or they will burn around the edges and stay raw in the middle.

I cooked these this morning, & as I was rolling them into tablespoon size balls, I remembered making them as a kid with my Mum, & she always rolled them in teaspoon size balls..so I quickly did an adjustment lol. I didn't have any white sugar, so I used brown, with a pinch of sea salt, and may I say, the result was pretty dang good! Apart from slightly over cooking them, I am happy, but, determined to get them 'just right'. Thanks for sharing & the memory :)

I have made these cookies several times and my whole family loves them! But, the past two times I've made them, the cookies are coming out flat and chewy instead of the regular size (as pictured) and soft!! What is going on??

Excellent recipe. My absolute favorite cookies to make. They are so easy, they need three ingredients and it is so fast, you have to cook them for 10 minutes at the most. everyone loves them, and i don't have to worry that someone at a party won't be able to eat them because they have some sort of wheat or gluten or carb allergy or aversion. I even substitute in truvia or some other sugar substitute for a diabetic friend I have and they still turn out great, I just use only about 3/4 cups at most of the truvia, otherwise it has this sickly sweet taste. They are always so soft and just perfect every time.

Easy and quick. Using crunchy peanut butter makes cookies seem as if they have real peanuts in them. I roll dough into small balls and make criss cross marks with fork before baking.--Just something I remember about old fashioned peanut butter cookies.

I added a pinch of baking soda and some chocolate chips. I baked them for 10 minutes. You have to let them cool before moving them from the cookie sheet or they will fall apart. I had enough dough left over to refrigerate for later. Love this recipe!!!!!

I grew up making these with my grandmother!  It's Probably the first recipe I ever followed as a kid!  They are really good.  Also, you can put an unwrapped Hershey's kiss in the middle of the cookie for a twist.  The cookies freeze really good too!

I have been using this recipe for years my fav.  Try rolling in walnut sized balls and bake in mini muffin tins for 10 mins and put the mini peanutbutter cups in center, or mix mini chocolate chips into the batter very versital.

I tried this because I was hungry baked goods and don;t have much in terms of ingredients at the moment. I decided to try and cut a quarter of the sugar out and substitute half of it with brown sugar which seemed to work out just fine. I added about two tablespoons of milk, for no particular reason but to experiment and it held up quite well, giving it a creamier taste I believe.

I also used crunchy peanut butter which made it a bit better for me. I think some butter would do this recipe justice, and even with the reduction in sugar, it was a tad too sweet.

We loved these cookies! Just the right amount of sweetness and peanut butter. I was suprised by the texture it turned out like a regular cookie even though you only use those three ingredients. I was sure it was going to be wierd without the flour. My only complaint is the mixing.. next time I will definately mix the sugar and egg first and then add it to the peanut butter because of the stiffness of the peanut butter.

this is a great recipe! it's even better for those that need to make something fast and simple. I made these for my husband bc he loves peanut butter. They are good just the way they are, but to add a little something (especially for you chocolate lovers), i put chocolate chips in them. It adds just the right taste!

These were good but I have had a lot better peanut butter cookies.  Considering how fast, easy, and only 3 ingredients, I do believe they are still worthy of a 4 star cookie.  I made about 15 cookies out of this recipe.  I rolled them into balls and criss-crossed a fork on them to press them down and sprinkled with sugar.  Into the dough I did add a dash of vanilla extract and baking powder.  I cooked these about 15 minutes.  They wasnt the best out of the oven warm.  They was very crumbly.  A few hours later while they cooled and set up a little better they did hold up and tasted better as a cookie.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make again when Im wanting a fast, simple peanut butter cookie.

I was skeptical that a cookie recipe would work with so few ingredients but my boys and I loved them.  We added a pinch of baking soda and a splash of vanilla and we were able to get 15 good sized cookies out of it. We baked them for 11 minutes since I didn't think they looked quite ready at 8.

I also added a dash of salt, baking powder and vanilla.  Then I used a cookie scoop to dip them into mini-muffin pans.  Baked for 8 minutes at 350 and then added a M&M (red & green for Christmas) to the top after baking.  Let them cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan and then moved to a wire rack.  They are very good with just the right amount of chocolate on top!

I didn't think these were possible. I am absolutely amazed and horrified lol. These are delicious and so easy. I will always make these when I want peanut butter cookies. Oh, these only horrify me because I now know I am always only 15 minutes away from fresh baked peanut butter cookies. It's gonna be hard to not eat these all the time! I didn't tell my roommate what was in them until after he tried them; he didn't believe that it was only three ingredients. Thank you sooo much!!!

These cookies are really good for what you put in them. I live where in a place where it is difficult to get butter and the right flour, so this 3 ingredient cookie is a life saver and always a quick "go to" cookie for me and my husband. :)

Just realized this recipe was on the site.  I've been baking these for years (over a decade).  A high school friend of mine got the recipe from her grandmother.  Easy peasy to make and delicious in taste.  Those who gave bad reviews must have messed up the EASIEST recipe in the world.  For a twist add a handful of chocolate chips or swirl in melted chocolate before rolling.

My mother-in-law introduced us to this recipe years ago.  Our adopted son was in an early intervention program where he needed to do a demonstration.  He barely spoke.  This was perfect!  Three ingredients and the same measurement: 1-1-1.  Who can mess that up?  He memorized it and did it.  He was so proud!

I was looking for a quick and easy peanut butter cookie recipe and this one was just that.  I added a tsp of vanilla and a tbsp of brown sugar as others suggested.  I also rolled the dough into a ball and used a fork to flatten them in a criss cross pattern.  Baked them for exactly 10 minutes and cooled them the same amount of time.  The extra brown sugar seemed to make them a little too sweet for me, so I'll either omit it the next time or use a half and half white / brown sugar mix.  I recommend mixing the egg, sugar, and vanilla (if used) very well before adding the peanut butter.  Adding the pb makes the dough very stiff.  A great recipe that I'll definitely make again.  This may replace my tried and true pb cookie recipe I've been making for 20+ years!

It is easy but now I remember why I do't care for this "method". They are just crumbly and dry and no real flavor. But they are okay and easy to make.

I made these cookies as written and they're ok, great if wanting a quick snack and not alot of cookies. i took another reviewer's advice and added 1tsp of baking soda. It changes the cookie completely lightens it up. My friend said they were the best pb cokkies he ever had.

Since I can't update my other review, I'll leave a new one.  I tried these with 1 cup lt brown sugar in place of white sugar.  They were VERY good!  Just watch they don't burn on the bottom (10 min's gives them a dark amber bottom, just the way I like them).  The brown sugar makes them more chewy in the middle. YUM!

These are the most delicious cookies ever. Super easy to pop in the oven at the last minute! I've used splenda, regular sugar, and half sugar/half brown sugar. They always turn out great! Thanks for sharing this one!

I just made these cookies and they were great!!! I read the reviews before I made them and I did add just a splash of vanilla and a teaspoon of baking soda. Those helped with the yummy taste! I did the criss cross fork pattern on the top and sprinkled with sugar. I made 12 cookies and had to bake them for close to 15 minutes because they were slightly thicker than normal. They turned out great! A big hit!

I felt like like having peanut butter cookies tonight and came to allrecipes looking for an easy recipe.  Well, I found THE recipe for peanut butter cookies--this one's a keeper!!! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but added a tspn. of vanilla, half a tspn. of salt, and a little baking soda. I rolled the dough into nine cookie balls, which I then pressed down aand criss-crossed with a fork.  I had no parchment paper, so I  just laid the cookies onto a Pam-sprayed cookie sheet. Cooked these for about 12-15 minutes, and they probably could have cooked a while longer.  Nevertheless, these were the best cookies and I love how quick and easy they were to make! Next time I might try them with half brown sugar and half Splenda or its equivalent, but other than that I won't be messing with success!

These aren't the best tasting cookies you'll ever eat, but they are certainly edible, and it's such a terrific recipe for small kids to make on their own.  Two of my boys just made them tonight and are busily devouring their creation.

For anyone with a celiac in their life, this recipe is a godsend. My boss can't have any gluten and so holiday and birthday parties at the office are always torture for her. Well, they were... now that I found this flour-less cookie recipe, she'll never feel left out again! These are just as good as any flour-full cookie recipe. I added chocolate chips to them to take it to the next level. I have a feeling that these will respond well to all sorts of variations. I'm thinking about incorporating cocoa powder and vanilla next time around...

Recipe is perfect as written but you can change it around by adding a little vanilla or leavener. Usually I make all cookies jumbo-sized and form them with a large ice-cream scoop, but this recipe seems to be best if you stick to smaller, tablespoon sized cookies. Larger size just doesn't bake all the way through correctly for me. I love this recipe since I always have everything I need on hand.

I just made these with my 2 1/2 year old daughter - what an easy recipe (she loves helping mommy bake)  to do with her.  I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla - that was my only modification.  Delicious peanut butter cookies!!!  I never make them from scratch when I make them with Kisses at Christmas time (I always use a mix to save time) - I will definitely use this recipe when I make them this Christmas!!!

I LOVE this recipe!  I used no sugar added natural chunky peanut butter and replaced the sugar with Splenda.  I dipped my fork in Splenda to make the criss cross hatch marks.  Delicious and guilt free!

Ive never written a review before but these cookies were fantastic!! My dad told me, "I usually don't like peanut butter cookies, but these were incredible!" I made the recipe exactly as it said and they turned out perfect. I did cook them a bit longer then the recipe said, but be really careful not to leave them in too long and take them out while they are still very soft. That way when they cool they are still a bit soft.

I have been using this recipe for years! I love it! I do adapt it a bit with a TBSP of flour and increase peanut butter by 1/2 cup.  They do need to be cooked longer in my oven as well.  Can't beat them for ease of preparation! Last time I made them I flattened too much and the cookies were hard, so heads up!

I was looking for an easy cookie with not a lot of ingredients and found this...This is the best "easy cookie" recipe ever!  I followed the advice of others and added vanilla and a small amount of baking soda.  :)

I just made these and they are very good & very easy to make. It did take longer to cook then stated but that is ok. It was just very hard to wait longer for them is all, as I love P.B. Cookies. They are not like my mom’s who's will always be 5 stars for me but for a fast P.B. Cookie they are awesome and come in with 4 stars!!! I will be making these with my grandkids as this is so easy little kids can do it!!! So happy I found these!!!

Wonderful, and extremely easy!  The best part?  It tastes AWESOME!!!  I only added a splash of vanilla flavoring, and less than a handful of chocolate chips. (left overs from my last batch of cookies)  I pressed them into my little PC bar pan and baked for 18 minutes... then I took them out and let them cool... hardly.  I used a pizza cutter to make even bars and had twenty of them.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  My daughter and I love them.

Absolutely delicious, what a great idea!!! As of other's suggestions, I added a bit of salt, baking soda and vanilla extract and baked them for 11 minutes instead of 8. They turned out perfect!!! Thank you for sharing this great recipe, it certainly is a winner!

Although, it took a little longer to bake, the cookies turned out great. I also added a little bit of vanilla extract. It was the first time I've baked homemade cookies- not bad at all.

Perfect for a quick snack! I would really not recommend using a natural peanut butter and I needed to flatten them before I baked them. They came out great.

These are so quick, easy & YUMMY! I used 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup white sugar (the dough seemed too crumbly with the full amount of sugar, and the cookies still turned out great with the lesser amount).

This was by far the easiest cookie recipe I have ever used! I have three different places to bring desserts for on Christmas Eve and these cookies will definately be a part of what I bring. I took some of the advice on other reviews and added 1 tsp. vanilla, a dash of salt and a couple pinches of baking soda and cooked them for 8 minutes then cooled in them in the oven for 3 min. and they turned out wonderful!!!

I used Crunchy peanut butter, gave it great crunch! Was a grainy texture, perhaps I should let dough sit for a bit on the counter or in the fridge before baking. I would also like some dark chocolate drizzled over the top, would give it a needed creamyness.  Overall, good cookies, and so incredibly easy!

You can't get easier than this and the taste is unreal. You couldn't get more peanut butter taste if you ate it straight from the jar! I love how it is gooey in the middle. They are perfect! Thanks!

I grew up on this cookie recipe!! It's so simple and the cookies turn out chewy and very tasty! I added some chocolate chips to mine and baked for approx. 17 minutes. I also cut the sugar down to 1/2 C. They turned out fantastic!

Absolutely delicious! A real peanut butter treat for the peanut butter lovers. Very thin, though, and had to cook a little longer, maybe about 12-15 minutes whole cooking time. Yields more than 12 cookies.

A little too gritty for my taste. My husband thought they were good with a large glass of milk. This is the same recipe as "Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies" also on this web site. I might make these again but it will be at someone else's request.

I only made these because I was craving something sweet and am out of EVERYTHING...I even hadto usebrown sugar in place of white...these are good for eating as cookie dough, but the "cookies" themselves are kinda weird. But it was a great fix for my sweet tooth, and better than eating peanut butter straight from the jar.

Personally, I changed the recipe a lot. Instead of three ingredients, it ended up to be five ingredients. I actually doubled the recipe and instead of two cups of sugar, I added one cup of sugar and one cup of brown sugar. I also added two teaspoons of vanilla extract. I don't know if it was because of the extra ingredients or what, but I was surprised that I got about 45 cookies out of my modified version. Since I doubled the recipe, I also doubled the time needed to bake, giving the cookies 14 minutes to bake. This recipe is good for people who love a good, peanut buttery snack. Perfect with a tall glass of milk.

I’ve made these cookies more times than I can count! So easy to make and always a fan favorite wherever I take them :) I add a dash of vanilla extract to the mix then sprinkle brown sugar on the tops before baking them to add some different textures & flavor. These cookies are also very versatile and you can make them to fit almost any dietary restriction! GF, diabetic (use sugar substitute), Vegan (replace each egg with 1/8cup applesauce) and Vegetarian! A great recipe to keep around for when you need to “bring something” to all those holiday parties you have this time of year ;)

Okay as is. Be careful not to over bake. Switch the white sugar to brown sugar, double the egg and you have a 5 star recipe.  If you're feeling frisky, add a touch of vanilla extract.

WOW!! This cookie recipe is fantastic! It literally took about 5 minutes to put together. I followed the recipe and took a tip from another reviewer and added a tiny pinch of both salt and baking powder. 
I used a hand mixer to mix the eggs and sugar than mixed in the peanut butter on lowest speed. I rolled the dough into balls than took a fork dipped in flour and pressed down the classic crisscross  on top. I made 11 cookies. 10 minutes later I took the cookies out and let them cool. 
THEY WERE A HIT WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY INCLUDING OUR DOG LUCY!! 
This will be my "go to" recipe for a quick treat. I also plan to experiment with adding different mix ins like nuts ect ....
Thank you ALL RECIPES for a slam dunk treat.

The cookies are amazing, but the cook time on the recipe is way off.  It took almost three times as long as the recipe suggests. My addition to this would be to bake until the tops are glossy and just start to crack, this leaves the cookies slightly gooey inside when still warm, but solid enough to still pick up.

Quick fix for a peanut butter craving! Easy & delicious. For convection oven users, I baked at 325 for 10 minutes and they were perfect. Let cool completely on pan.

I made this recipe exactly to the letter of the directions and they were the worst cookie I have ever eaten in my life. when they are done at 6 to 8 minutes they are to soft and fall apart even after they are cool. They are very gritty due to sugar.  I do have to say the texture improved when I placed them on the bottom rack in the oven to bake which they no long fall apart when cooled, but it still did nothing for the gritty texture from the sugar.

I did make this recipe and everyone loved it and especially my sisters and brothers. I liked it even though I thought it was to much sugar so today when I made it I actually put a whole container of abc peanut butter and less sugar. I didn't calculate how much sugar I put I just made sure it was less than 1 cup. I found that today when I made them it took 15 minutes to cook, not 8. I also found that when you add a whole countainer of peanut is then when you should really add 1 cup of sugar. I also found that it's easier if you make the recommemnded amount of peanut butter (like I did yesterday) because mine came out really soft and we're just barely cooked. If I wanted to double the recipe next time I'll just do it in separate bowls intul I can get the hang of things. But if I had to rate this recipe on the cookies I baked yesterday I'd rate it a 5. If I had to rate it on the cookies today I'd give it a 0.5 maybe a 1. The cookies finished and today everyone in my house was let down by the taste and it literally breaks in your finger

I admit, I made a few changes.... I halved the recipe because peanutbutter's expensive, yo. I also added a capfull of vanilla because I live in the land of the free, and just to be patriotic I threw in an unmeasured quarter teaspoonish of baking powder. 'Murca. (and I used Justin's Peanutbutter, which I know has either cocanut or palm oil in it...)

These are little balls of glory that would make George Washington Carver cry tears of pride. sweet, but not too sweet. Intense, but not overwhelming. I did make the cookies pretty small, and I took the bake time down a minute accordingly, but they cooled and finished cooking nicely on the rack.

I went fromt playing TF2 to saying "I want cookies" to having cookies in about 10 minutes. good stuff.

LOVE IT. Super easy and fast as well as delicious. Everyone has those 3 ingredients in their kitchen and everyone prefers to spend 12 minutes baking then an hour or 2.

So amazing! I halved the entire recipe. For the egg, I whisked it and saved the other half for another recipe. I baked mine 7 mins. Next time I would cook for an additional 1.5 mins it so. So great. Ended up with 7 cookies

I had such high hopes for these cookies. I substituted Splenda for sugar due to being diabetic but other than that followed the recipe exactly. They smelled so good in the oven, I baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfectly golden. When I pulled them from the oven I let them cool for about 5-10 minutes before trying to remove them from the pan. Trying is the appropriate word. As soon as I touched them with the spatula they crumbled. I don't mean like a few pieces broke off, I mean into a million pieces. The taste was pretty good, not fabulous, but pretty good. We used the crumbles as a topping for vanilla Greek yogurt but as a cookie this was a fail. I have been baking for 35+ years, have worked in restaurants including one that baked all their bread and pastries on site and worked in that department and I am the dessert girl for all our family events so I know my way around an oven. It just didn't do it for us at all.

I followed this recipe exactly as directed except I did the criss cross on the dough balls. They are super easy to make and they came out perfect and delicous. It really does help to pull them out slightly underdone, they will be doughy but let them sit for a minute, carefully transfer them onto the cooling rack and soon you will have soft tasty cookies.

this recipe is amazing. I was a little bit concerned that it wasn't going to taste good because it used so few ingredients but it was nice and soft and my family loved it. I'm a college student so it's also a quick snack to make with few ingredients

I've been doing a lot of the recipes I see around this website but this one is the first and only one to make me come and give a review. I love making cookies and this recipe is the best one for a quick, easy and delicious treat you want. First of all the texture is amazing. You expect to get some dry and thick taste but it is a blast once you bite one of these. Second; it's so easy that you won't even hesitate to make them once you crave them. Lastly; it's not a simple cookie. It's not boring, it's rich and an interesting feast that will get all the attention on itself once you bring it to your guests.

I made these cookies yesterday and read the reviews this morning. I had no problem with the cookies and just the 3 ingredients. They came out AMAZING and everybody loved them. I only made 13 cookies and I really did only cook them for about 8 minutes. They were GREAT, especially for a pregnant lady who had a late night craving lol. I will be using this recipe again!

Tried this recipe as written: using organic peanut butter and organic coconut sugar, they made about 18 circles instead of 12 and didn't fit one cookie sheet! They took about 15 minutes.

I didn't have much and wanted a peanut butter cookie.  I looked out this receipt and reviews.  I thought not a lot to do or if they are horrible I didn't waste much. Win/win situation I thought but they were awesome to my surprise.  The batch made about 20 cookies and I greased my pan because I didn't have parchment paper. The cooking time is more like 8 to 10 minutes.  The cookies are soft and crumble in your mouth must cool for 10 minutes though but so worth it. Must try great for kids too, my son thinks he's a baker now.

I don't know if I did this wrong or what, but they tasted like I took a spoon of peanut butter and dipped it in a glob of sugar. I cooked them for 15 minutes and was afraid to go any longer because I didn't want to overcook.  Think I should have gone for at least 20 minutes. I probably won't try this again......

This recipe was just what I was looking for. It was a simple. having read the reviews I also added a teaspoon of baking soda and a little bit of vanilla. in my photograph you can see that I baked Them on a silpat this was my second batch I bake them for about 10 minutes at 350 then turned off the oven and left them in for another 15 and they turned out beautifully the first batch was very slightly under done, I only bake them for about 10 minutes.

I just finish making this recipe and when I made it I knew I didn't have all the ingredients to make the original peanut butter cookies, so this recipe intrigued me. The cookies were harder than I like and it taste more like sugar than peanut butter cookies overall it was ok.

I love these cookies! So easy to make and every bit as soft and tasty as those with more ingredients. Also, I tried them with the crunchy peanut butter I had on hand -- turned out perfect. I'm just making them for the second time now!

Cooked on 350 for 12 minutes and cookies still came out soft when I touched them. cooling helped a little but not much. Good if you want a really soft cookie. Great taste...

We're tight on money and I wanted a treat, so these were perfect-- not many ingredients and we already had eggs!  They were delicious but kind of crumbly; I may add a second egg next time and see if that helps.

I think these are the first cookies I ever made, years ago, with my grandma. I love making them with chunky Adam's peanut butter, since that brand doesn't add sugar or hydrogenated oil. The recipe should mention to press the tops down with a fork. I think that does make a different.

This was a really easy recipe and satisfied my peanut butter craving. These cookies don't have the "cookieness" of regular peanut butter cookies, but they're so easy that they make up for it. I followed the recipe exactly, including the parchment paper and flattening them with the fork and sugar. I took them out once the tops were consistently lighter than the original color, about 7 minutes. I also used crunchy peanut butter which I personally like a lot more, and the peanuts retained their saltiness amidst the sweet cookie, so they had a little salty flavor pop that I really liked. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, but I think I could've added more.

I made these for my best friends baby shower. She had developed gestational diabetes and also has a gluten allergy, so I had very specific restrictions. I  Followed the recipe exactly, but used sea salt to sprinkle over the top. All the guests RAVED about these salty sweet cookies. They couldn't believe they only used 3 ingredients! I have made them several times since, and they always turn out great. I sprinkle them with sugar for my husband, but I prefer the sea salt. I usually only bake them for about 7 minutes and they stay soft and chewy. Delicious!

This was the easiest & best tasting peanut butter cookie that I've ever came across....I made one addition...I added a splash of vanilla extract. 
Perfect with a glass of cold milk or vanilla ice cream.

Well, I followed the recipe perfectly but it just didn't turn out for me. The cookies kept spreading, and spreading..It was to the time limit stated and they were still very raw and seemed very off. So I watch them closely, let them bake a couple more minutes (totaling 10 minutes)and they over cooked a little *cough*. The end result was very gritty falling apart slop. I have NEVER had that happen any other time, with OTHER recipes! 

I'm glad everyone else seemed to have no problems. I was surprised at how inedible mine turned out. *sigh*

These cookies are so good!  I took them to work and received raves from all that ate them.  Many even asked for the recipe and thought I was playing a joke on them with only the three ingredients.  :-)  I did follow a reviewers thought and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  I just want to say. . . .YUM!!  I think that even w/out the baking soda they will still get GREAT reviews!!  Thank you for such and easy and yummy cookie recipe!

Tried it but they don't really taste like normal peanut butter cookies. My husband hated them and I didn't like them but my 4  year old liked em. But then he will eat anything containing sugar. They were too dry and crumbly too...maybe it was the peanut butter I used? It was creamy Peter Pan  peanut butter. Shouldnt matter though, peanut butter is peanut butter,right?Maybe with some tweaking it would be better but that kinda defeats the purpose of 3 ingredient cookies. Sorry, but these weren't a big hit with us. I gave the recipe 3 stars cuz my kid likes em. Otherwise it's a one star for me.

These tasted awsome and my husband loved it and he's so picky I didn't have many ingredients and they came out great and didn't fall apart.I did cheat alittle folks.I added about a tablespoon of butter,half brown and white sugars,and and like 1/8 tsp of baking powder because I didn't have any baking soda.Oh and just a sprinkle of salt and something I've never put into peanut butter cookie batter before, lemon jucice.Not much,just alittle juice.I wanted them to be alittle fluffy and they were. I'm happy.

Just like my grandmothers! I have been making these for nearly 40 years with just these three ingredients (I criss cross smash mine before baking too).  Only difference is I bake mine @ 325 for 10 min. Let them cool for 5 more before removing and they are  a perfect simple snack cookie.

I never leave reviews, but I was so impressed with these cookies that I felt compelled to sign up, just so I could leave my praise!

I have recently started weighing my ingredients when baking, so I can replicate the results more easily. 

I chose the metric version, and followed the suggestions of many reviewers by adding 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also added 1 cup of peanut butter cups.

These are fantastic! They are what I have always dreamed a peanut butter should taste like! They flour versions always leave something to be desired, but these... well, I better start shopping for bigger pants!

5 stars for taste, but only 3 for consistency. I let the cookies sit for 5 min before taking them off the baking sheet, and they barely held together- most broke in half in the transfer from cooling rack to Tupperware. I tried adding 1/4 cup cocoa to half the batch, and the consistency was MUCH better- but too much cocoa flavor and barely any PB. Will try again another time with 1 C PB, 1 C sugar, 1 egg, 1/4 C cocoa/flour, for Four Ingredient chocolate/regular PB cookies

Simple and delicious!  These were so easy to make and tasted great.  I did what others suggested and added a dash of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  I rolled them into walnut sized balls and pressed them with a sugar coated fork.  Baked for 15 minutes, but I imagine they could do with even a little bit more time in the oven.  Definitely will make again, if for nothing else, because it's so darn easy!

You can't find an easier homemade cookie. Although, it's more like 6 ingredients. I added a tsp of baking soda, a dash of salt, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla and make sure to lightly press down w/ a fork. And I found 10 min was a better baking time. These came out sooo good. They're soft and so melt-in-your-mouth-peanut-buttery. They're my daughter's favorite cookie.

This is THE BEST recipe EVER!  I've been making this with my kids since they were old enough to stand on a kitchen chair to help me bake--and they are college-age now. Greatest recipe ever for small children--no messy flour!  These are also THE most peanut-buttery tasting cookies you'll ever find.  The only thing I do differently is to flatten the cookies with a fork dipped in granulated sugar before baking.  Add chocolate chips, and they taste like a peanut butter cup.  YUM!!

These were incredible! I made them on a whim after coming across the recipe - they were super easy to make. They were intended for our lunch guests but were so good that I ended up eating one every time  passed the box-guest got only five...delicious!

Easy and delicious - and from scratch, too! My daughter calls these "poor" cookies, because, as a poor college student she could still afford to make them. I have made them many, many times. Tonight I used brown sugar and added chocolate chips. Just great!

SO easy to make! I added a little bit of vanilla and some honey because I love the way peanut butter and honey taste together. They were great. The honey made them a bit gooey-er in the center, but I like them that way. Baked for about 10 minutes (could bake for a little longer if you like them less goey) and cooled them. Delish!

These were very good.  I did as others suggested and added a small amount of vanilla, soda, and powder.  I made them in to rounded balls and pressed with a fork.  I baked them for 8 minutes.  They were perfect.  I will make them again for a fast and easy treat.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla, they turned out great. I couldnt believe how easy they were. I mixed the egg, sugar, and vanilla first then mixed in the peanut butter. I baked them for about 15 minutes.

I made these with the following changes.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  1/2 cup white chocolate peanut butter and l/2 cup dark chocolate peanut butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 tbls. flour. Rolled into balls, flattened and baked for 10 minutes at 350.  We were eating them warm right off the cooling rack.  So easy and delicious.

These were excellent and so easy to make!  My three-year old helped me and it wasn't a disaster.  Also added a pinch of baking soda and 1 tsp of vanilla.  The only mistake I made was not spacing them out far enough.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were quick and easy to make and taste great. Since I am in a high altitude, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of flour. I rolled them into balls and flattened them with a fork, then topped them off with a few choc chips each for an added touch.

So yummy and so fast.  However, they were too sweet for me so the second time around I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and added 1/2 cup of ground hazelnuts and they were PERFECT!

These are great and easy to make. I love soft PB cookies like these! They were too sweet for me, but they were gobbled up rather quick. Since they were so easy to make made a second batch and added 1/2 c. crushed pecans with cinnamon and vanilla. Those were interesting.

This is the easiest recipe ever and it makes a tasty cookie that doesn't last long at my house!  We've made the cookie per the original directions many times, but we've also added a few extras from time to time.  We often add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinammon.  We recently tried adding a single serving of instant oatmeal and that was nice as well.

I have been making these for over a year now. Best cookies ever and so easy to make. Best of all, I can remember the recipe by heart. I add about 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla too. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for sharing this....

These cookies are pretty good...very peanut buttery.  They kind of taste like cookie dough even when cooked.  They don't have the texture of a normal cookie.  Great flavor though!!

Good but quite sweet, I wonder if it's possible to use less sugar without changing the consistency too much. Leave them on the cookie sheet for 5ish minutes to cool and set; they crumble otherwise.

I got this recipe off a motorcycle forum.  I surely thought there were ingredients missing.  I had to try them out.  I was pleasantly surprised on how they turned out.  Hubby and kids loved them.  I, now triple the recipe.

Really good- I bake them for about 10-12 minutes since I like them crunchy.  Sometimes I add chocolate chips or hersheys kisses on top.

I read some of the suggestions and followed them, but added a fun twist. I added a pinch of baking powder (no baking soda on hand), a splash of vanilla extract, and on a whim threw in a package of apple cinnamon oatmeal. When I added the oatmeal it looked too dry so I beat and egg and added half. Mine took 10-11 minutes to cook but they were great! Crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Thanks!

You can call this a peanut butter cookie if you want, but what it really is is a Reese's Peanut Butter cup without the really waxy chocolate coating! And it is delicious!

DELICIOUS AND EASY!  I loved these cookies...although at 350 degrees it took almost 25 minutes for mine to get done!  They came out more moist and thicker than regular peanut butter cookies and my kids loved them...and SO EASY!

These are delicious!  They stay very moist, unlike most peanut butter cookie recipes that have flour in them.  I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips to half of the batter.  I added a splash of vanilla, also.  Yum yum!  I will use this recipe from now on!

I added splenda instead of sugar and forgot to flatten them out( beginning chef) and used the crunchy peanut butter. The peanuts in the crunchy peanut butter gave it a burnt taste so I reccoment sticking with the creamy!

I have to say I was extremely skeptical when I read this recipe, but I figured I'd give it a try. I am still amazed that I'm saying this, but they turned out great! I also added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla extact, and they are truly delicious.

These were super easy and quick to make and they are sooooooo good! Very rich!! I made a double batch using brown sugar, flattened the dough on the cookie sheet with a fork and sprinkled white sugar on top. Baked for 12 minutes and left on the cookie sheet til cool. Will definitely make again!!

I make these often because I usually have the ingredients on hand.  Changes I make: use 1 cup brown sugar instead of white (or 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar blend if you are watching calories), a teaspoon to tablespoon pure vanilla extract, and a 1/2 cup or so plain instant oatmeal.  You can also throw in some chocolate chips too and they hold up fine :-)

I just made these and my husband said they are the best peanut butter cookies he has ever had and he is pretty picky. They definitley were not done after six minutes but more like 8-10. I will make these again posibly adding chocolate chips or M&M's, super easy & quick. Be sure to let them cool for a while before touching them!!

Quick, easy and great tasting - exactly what you want in a cookie.  My six year old son made these and they turned out great.  I did take the suggestion of some of adding a pinch of baking soda and about 1/4 tsp. of vanilla.  We ended up with a dozen large cookies.  We will definitely be making these again and they are perfect for children to make as suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

Abslutely love them my family and I enjoyed them a lot but Jiffy peanut butter works the best. If you are a diabetic and use splenda make sure you use a smart balance peanut butter, I made them for my aunt she loved them

These were so easy to make my four year old helped. However, beware of the EXTREME peanut butter taste. Have a glass of milk nearby! I could eat about half a cookie before my mouth started sticking together. If you are a peanut butter lover these are great. Like someone else noted I did have to bake them about twice as long as the recipe states. My family was happy with these cookies but they won't be made too often.

I'm sorry but these aren't my personal fave.  This recipe should be renamed extreme peanut butter- these cookies taste like a spoonful of peanut butter straight out of the jar.  I made the recipe as written and the cookies were very crumbly and overpowering with peanut butter- so rich that I could not eat a whole cookie.  The saving grace for this recipe is that my girls (6 & 3) enjoyed making them and eating them- with a lot of milk!

Why go through all the trouble of making a complicated recipe with many ingredients, when you can make this??
It is wonderful and easy.  Even easier than the refrigerated dough.  We loved them!

My mom made these cookies often when my brother & I were small.  They are so good!  The key is not to overcook them.  When my grandma first saw the recipe, she thought Mom had made a mistake....no flour???  Make sure you have plenty of milk to go along with these great cookies.

Excellent peanut butter taste - although they are "gritty" with sugar, that's what I like about them.  Do not overbake, or they become dry and lose a lot of their peanut butter flavor.

This recipe is so fast and easy! I made these cookies for 3 different parties for the holiday weekend and they were a hit each time.  Make sure you allow them to cool before you take them off the pan or they will break!

These were pretty good. I used crunchy peanut butter and only used a half cup of sugar. They were done in 11 minutes...and they weren't grainy at all. Next time I think I'll add chocolate chips!

Watch out, don't burn them!! Excellent cookies, my 3.5 year old loved them. I have tiny alphabet cookie cutters, which I used to print letters on the top of the cookies for some extra fun for my little one.

These cookies were very good. I cooked mine for 12 minutes and they came out very soft and moist. It's amazing how they have an actual cookie texture, even though there is no flour.

My peanut butter-loving hubby loved these. You definitely taste only peanuts! Admittedly, it is a tad grainy from the sugar, but you really don't notice. He said he likes this one better than our usual favorite peanut butter cookie recipe. I'm glad because this one is easier and I always have the ingredients on hand. Can't tell you how well they keep because they never last. I sorta like our other recipe better, but I'm not a peanut butter fan.

i give this recipe 5 stars. very easy to make and is the best peanut butter cookie i ever had. i doubled the recipe and got 36 cookies. i also added 2 tsp vanilla. i don't think it made a difference. the cookies are paper thin since there's no flour in them. this si the first PB cookie i made that didn't burn or turn crunchy. if you want a soft cookie, this is for you.

They are sooo easy! I love the way they perfectly satisfy a peanut butter craving, or a "snacky" mood. I set my little sister up with making them, as she is just learning how to bake, and she loved them, too. I made them with Splenda instead of suger (they tasted just as good, I think, but came out REALLY crumbly). Thank you for the recipe!

These are pretty good for what they are.  I grew up making this recipe at Christmas.  I don't rember the amount of sugar in the original but I think it was 1/2 cup.  We used to roll the dough into balls, coat them with sugar and when they come out of the oven place a Hershey's Kiss in the middle, a real treat.

This recipe also works well with a cookie press. If you press them, and want to add chocolate you can melt chips and drizzle them over the top.

These are quite easy and very rich!  I did as another reviewer suggested by adding 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate morsels (mini size).  I also did the crisscross pattern with a fork and they held the shape well.  Since they're so rich, you don't need to eat many before your peanut butter craving is satisfied, which is a good thing.  They're very high in fat.

I was surprised at how delicious these cookies were.  The best thing is how easy they were! Just mix 3 ingredients together, how easy is that!?! Very good taste.  I did, however, when I dropped the dough onto the cookie sheet, I took a fork and made a criss cross pattern.  This gave them the peanut butter cookie look.  Very yummy!

These were incredibly YUMMY!  I used 3/4c (vs. 1 c) sugar and they were perfect.  I also added 1 tsp. vanilla. I put mine in a 350 oven for roughly 13 minutes, just until the bottoms were solidified but had no color.  Ridiculously fast to make!  Visually, they aren't the most impressive, so next time I'll make a pattern on top.

this was too good to be true...so easy and quick. i used a stoneware cookie sheet, so it took longer and kept cooking after i took them out of the oven...next time i'll use the metal pan.  i'll  also make smaller spoonfuls and flatten them abit with a fork.  very rich but delicious

I love this recipe. I make these all the time because they are so simple to make. I recommend doubling the batch though. Your going to need them. At Christmas I sprinkle green and red sugar over top of them before baking. These are great for those who cannot have flour too.

This is my all-time favorite peanut butter cookie recipe. For years, I made the more complicated floury cookies before finding this recipe in a kid's cookbook. Very peanut buttery and chewy. Remember to let them cook 4-5 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing them to a wire rack though ~ they break easily when warm.

Make sure you let these cool on the baking sheet for five minutes before moving them to a cooling rack.

What an easy and yummy recipe! I used crunchy p-nut butter and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and added a splash of mexican vanilla. I did not flatten them, but left them in small teaspoon drops. It made 22 cookies. In my gas oven it took them 14 minutes. I let them cool a little on the cookie sheet and they were done perfectly. They are kind of crumbly and require coffee, tea or milk. Next time I will try them with Splenda.

I got this recipe from a close friend about 15 years ago, and I don't make any other kind of pb cookie now.  They taste great, because all you taste is the peanut butter.  You can mix in chocolate chips, etc. if you want.  My kids can make them without any problem, and they always get gone fast!

hubby made these for me last weekend when i was having a sweet tooth- we were short on everything except these 3 ingredients- these were awesome...
i also used 1/2 the sugar called for and they were plenty sweet... will make these again when i am in a crunch and need something sweet........ but make sure to cook them longer than stated i think hubby ended up cooking them for 17 minutes and they were perfect

These cookies were good but not as good as the type that contain flour.  They were a bit gritty.  But if you need to fix something quickly these cookies are for you.  By the time my oven had preheated I had them ready to pop in.

After baking a batch of PB cookies from a different recipe on this site (which were just so-so) this quick & simple recipe kept popping into mind.  So I figured since the oven was still warm I would go ahead & give this recipe a try.  What an unexpected surprise!  Although on the sweet side, these cookies had the most peanut buttery taste of any cookies I have tried. They did take a good 20 minutes in my over though, and I used a mix of crunchy peanut butter along with regular. Quick, easy & delicious!

I know this sounds crazy considering half the ingredients in this recipe is peanut butter.... But I didn't think they tasted peanut buttery enough!  They were definitely sweet, but I think the sugar kind of blocked out the peanut butter taste.  They were very easy though.  They also took about 20 minutes in my oven (before then, I couldn't lift up the bottom of the cookies at all, they were still completely "wet").  They look quite nice and are perfectly round (very flat) because I rolled them into balls and smushed them before baking.  I wonder if it would still work if I cut down the sugar and increased the peanut butter?  In any case, I know I'll make these again!  Thanks!

I've had better but I've also had worse. They were very sweet to me although my 3 year old loved them. I might make them again if I have a craving for it but I don't think it will be anytime soon. I recommend it as a starter recipe for kids to get involved in.

This recipe is very easy and tastes great but I had to put the cookies in the freezer to set. I substituted egg beaters for the egg because she loves to eat raw cookie dough.

I was very skeptical before I baked these cookies.  However, my kids wanted to bake (9 year old and 6 year old), and I only had some of the ingredients for some of the recipes.  This recipe was easy and I surely had all the ingredients.  I couldn't imagine how they would come out.  The kids loved making them, and to my surprise, they are very good :)  
The only thing I noticed was if I removed them from the cookie sheet to soon, they broke up.  So let them cool before you remove them from the cookie sheet.  If you have kids who like to bake, this one is a winner!

Tasty cookie! I made this with chunky peanut butter for my co-workers here in Germany. And they all want the recipe. Surprising because peanut butter is not well-liked in Germany.

These cookies are the best PB cookies I have ever tasted. My husband asks me to make these often. I have had this recipe for about two years and it is the easiest and best tasting recipe. I dont fool with all the ingredients in the other recipes. These are perfect!!

Not sure if this would be considered the same recipe with my additions.... 
I added a 1/2 cup very ripe banana  and a 1/2 cup of quick-oats.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  I needed to leave the cookies 8-10 min. longer.  Turned out delicious.

Maybe you are supposed to use a conventional peanut butter but I used a "just peanuts" peanut butter - and  I have a tray of crumbs.  I've baked extra time but nothing is going to hold these together :(

I love these cookies! So simple, quick and delicious! I have made this recipe about 10 times now, the first few times I followed the ingredients exactly but every timw my cookies were gritty and super sweet to me. So, I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and I love it even better now.

I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. It gave it a mild sweet taste. Brought out the peanut butter taste instead of being sweet. Suggest maybe for diabetics

Classic recipe. I made it exactly as instructed, and added a little kosher salt on top. Everyone said they were great, and that they prefer these simple cookies to more complex PB cookie recipes.

I wanted something I could make with ease, my dad doesnt really keep much food in his house soce 3 of us live here, he and I both LOVE peanut butter cookies and food with peanut butter so we try to keep as much of it in the house as we can. I made these yesterday and they turned out perfectly, the only change I made was the cook time. 8 minutes didn't cook it all the way, so I left it in for another about 6 minutes and they were perfect. I highly recommend this recipe.

I was a bit skeptical because it was only three ingredients! But I added a square of melted butter into the mix. I let it bake for 20 minutes(the inside was gooey still) and it didn't burn! I think everyone should follow this recipe it's simple,quick and easy.

I would suggest making these with half a cup of peanut butter if you don't like eating cookies with the flavor of straight peanut butter. It was much too strong.

it was an easy recipe. Something to calm my sweet tooth. The directions could be a bit more clear.  I took them out after 8 minutes and they were still in a ball shape. Maybe the directions should clarify whether I should mash them down or not. What do I know, I'm a newb at baking. I ended up mashing them down and putting them back in for another 5 minutes, let them cool off and they were just as tasty.

I added just a pinch of baking powder, but this was otherwise a simple, perfect and yummy recipe for the short amount of prep and cook time. Had a sweet tooth tonight, and this did the trick. I added an extra pinch of sugar to make up for the baking powder. I would recommend this for someone looking for quick cookies on a budget, low on ingredients or not experienced with baking.

Quick and easy to make plus there so good that no one will ever guess that  weren't made from a full standard recipe ..just DO NOT OVER BAKE. It totally ruins them 'cause they do "harden up" once they're completely cool.

I made them exactly like the recipe. They were very good! 
Soft and almost gooey, they melt in the mouth.
It stated to cook at 350F, which I did for 6 to 8 minutes. I baked them for 9 minutes, but In my opinion they perhaps could of used an extra minute or so.

This is my go to recipe for cookies. They are so easy and so fast to mix. Would be great for baking with kids because stirring is so much easier than recipes with flour. Also if you have gluten issues, as I do, these are perfect. Sometimes I roll them into balls and into some sugar before flattening with a fork.

Great recipe, too sweet for my taste buds though, cut the sugar in half and used dark brown sugar, added in some dark chocolate chips and 3 - 4 tablespoons of cocoa. Absolute keeper recipe.

I made them today because I wanted something quick and easy.   And they were all that.   I read other reviews and they suggested baking for 15 minutes.   I baked mine for 12 1/2 minutes but next time I'll do 15 minutes.   I like my cookies on the crispy side and 15 minutes should do it.   I'll be making these with my granddaughters very soon.

Upon first glance the cookies were cute. But when you pick them up they immediately crumble and fall apart. The taste of sugar is also completely overwhelming, I would suggest like 1/4 a cup. I didn’t even use the full cup of sugar when I made it, because I thought it would be too much. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar when making these and even then WAY too much sugar.

I first started making these about 20 years ago and I quickly changed the recipe to suit my taste.  Everyone who doesn't like this recipe should experiment a little.  Try using a little more than a cup of crunchy peanut butter and a little less sugar, add a pinch of salt, some vanilla extract and some mini chocolate chips.  You could even add just 2-3 tablespoons of self rising flour to give them more of a traditional peanut butter cookie flavor and texture.

Thank you.

I've made these for years.  But I do make small balls (rolled in my palms,)  then roll in a plate of sugar to coat before putting onto cookie sheet and pressing with fork in cross hatches.  I pull out of oven when edges are just starting to brown, and let sit on cookie tray for about 3 more minutes before transferring to cooling rack.   Delicious, and chewy soft.   Cook longer for more crispness.

Flavour good but texture terribly grainy...my advice is to cook for at least 8 mins so the edges are golden brown otherwise they won’t stay together and it does help mask the graininess a bit. Maybe I should have creamed the peanut butter and sugar together with the mixer...
Oh, and they MUST  set after they come out of the oven too.
Overall, It’s ok but not good or  fantastic. Too bad Because it is so simple!!!

Very simple and delicious. Although not my favorite peanut butter cookie, they're good for a quick treat!  I think next time I'll add a little butter, a little flour and a little more pb.  Trying to get that melt in your mouth consistency.

I made it with crunchy peanut butter instead of normal peanut butter. With that, I still loved it even though it was a little sweet for me and would definitely make it again.

This is great as is. 

If you have difficulty with the texture, add 2T flour, dash of salt and 1/2t baking soda. Also five stars. 

I made large cookies and baked for 15 minutes. Perfect!

I made the recipe the way it showed. These cookies were easy and delicious. The next one I made I used powdered stevia. Not so good and  much drier.

These were sugar gritty. They cooked up nicely, didn't taste too bad. Will read the "tweaks" next time or find a different version. My family didn't like them.

I had a sweet tooth and wanted to bake something simple so I tried this recipe. Unfortunately, most of the one star reviews were correct. I couldnt roll the dough out or flatten it with a fork cause it just crumbled like dust. The texture of the cookie when finished was grainy due to the sugar. After 7-8 minutes of baking and letting them sit for 5 minutes, the cookies were so soft and crumbly that I couldnt pick them up without them falling apart. The only good thing is they tasted like peanut butter..

It turned out too sweet for my liking, but it was pretty good otherwise; and also an extra egg makes it stay together better.

I made them, and I was not happy because in the recipe says it only takes 6 to 8 mins. to bake. Well it was wrong it took and 30 mins. per batch that I made.

These cookies are amazing. I could not believe how easy and delicious they were! I made them with skippys natural peanut butter. My dad who is on a low fodmap diet could eat them and everyone in the family including myself loved them. They are soft and perfect. My batch made 22 cookies. Cooked them for 10 minutes. Let them sit on sheets for another 5 minutes out of oven. Wanted to eat all of them.

The cookies were delicious. Super easy and I was able to make 26 decent size cookies following the recipe. The only change I made was, I used a 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter and a 1/2 of cup of crunchy peanut butter. Would definitely make again.

Almost too easy, they came out great. Just not my favorite PB cookie. After making these for about the 20th time, I have changed it to a small jar of peanut butter. then fill the same jar with sugar. two eggs. Less to wash afterwards.

Fantastic cookies! I'm allergic to gluten but a peanut butter cookie fanatic so this was perfect! Though, for a full recipe, I would suggest cooking it for a couple of minutes longer. I baked them for 3 minutes longer and they turned out PERFECT!!

These are yummy. They are very peanut buttery and very sweet. What else would they be considering the ingredients. I got 20 cookies. I did press them down with a fork.  I had to bake these for about 14 minutes and they are soft in the centre and crispy on the outside. Just the way we like them. I have to admit I was sceptical of this recipe, but it did not disappoint!

I would make these easy cookies again. I used half of the cookie dough per recipe & other half I added nutella , & chocolate peanut butter chips.

I LOVED THEM!!! They were seriously so simple and had the absolute perfect amount of peanut butter to sweetness. I made my balls a little larger so they made larger cookies but made 12 cookies. I also cooked them for between 11-16 minutes. They were a little on the crispy side, which I like for dipping into milk and coffee.

THIS WAS THE WORST RECIPE I HAVE EVER TRIED...I USED BROWN SUGAR, WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE RESULTS...IF ANYTHING IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HARDER IN CONSISTENCY...IT WOULDN'T STAY TOGETHER AT ALL - BROKE UP INTO LITTLE PIECES - A TOTAL DISASTER - AND I AM NO NOVICE TO COOKING & BAKING...I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE AT ALL...THANKS ANYWAYS...;)

6 minutes to blend, 6 minutes to bake, and 6 minutes to eat them all.  Very good recipe, our new favorite. We added chocolate chips to half the batch.

They taste better the more you eat them. Now I'm not sure if thats because after the first batch you get a feel for how long you actually need to cook them or not. One thing's for certain, they needed about 20 minutes to cook for me. Taste is alright especially  considering how few ingredients were used to make them. Definitely gonna give it another shot next time I'm hankering for something sweet.

These are great to make for my GF sister-in-law!  We do add 1/4 tsp of salt, too, as I find that without it, the cookies are a little bland... and I like a bit of saltiness in my cookies.  I'm sure the type of peanut butter you use would affect that, too, though.

Delish! I added some vanilla, baking powder and a dash of salt, and cooked for about 12 minutes! Then i used a fork to make the criss cross before they cooled. My boyfriend and I are enjoying these treats right now! ??

I felt a bit creative and added a splash of vanilla and a teaspoon each of butter and honey..turned out great, like peanut butter and honey sandwiches. The big kid (my husband) loved them. Will make again.

Really simple and great to make with kids. Personally, I would be adding less sugar because they ended really sweet. They are better with toppings, strawberry jelly or hazelnut spread. I also kept them in the oven longer, about 10-12 minutes, because they wouldn't keep their shape with 6 minutes.

Will not make again, I thought this would be a simple, easy recipe for a beginner like me. I followed the recipe and instructions to a T, but after 6-8 minutes, the top was still floofy and raw. I kept on adding minutes, but every time I checked, they would start to fall apart at the touch. They basically ended up burning, and after just a few minutes, all of the softness and chewiness is gone and now they're all hard. They also tasted so very dry. Don't know if that's because of the burning or what. I don't know what went wrong. Enlighten me.

Not I pressed, to sticky to form a ball and try pressing a fork to make the criss croos effect impossible. It just a big mess. Taste was just ok. Will not use these recipe again.

These were awesome!  My granddaughter made these for me  at Christmas because they are gluten and lactose free.  She did one batch as directed then made a second batch with peanut butter cups, white chocolate peppermint truffles and mini hershey bars.  On this batch, she flatened slightly with a fork  then made an indent in the cookie by pressing a candy into it prior to cooking then popped the candy in when she took them from the oven.  Second batch was a really big hit!

Super easy and fun to make! I’m a teenager and love making this! I would recommend it to anyone who doesn’t have very many ingredients and is new to baking. One problem is that my oven had a hard time baking it due to its oily texture. It tasted really good though I did have to add brown sugar to make up for the sugar that I did not have.

This recipe was easy, fast and delicious. I made it with my daughter in law and we followed the advice of others by using equal parts white, brown and powdered sugar. We also chilled the dough which made it easier to handle. The second batch took a bit longer to bake, so don't go by just the cook time.

Well people'' 
I have some good news and some BAD news about these little cookies.
First of all,I have 356 people in my neighborhood,we had a little get-together for an older vet,that lost his only son a week ago.
Everyone that came brought there own little treats and food ext..But' all the peanut butter cookies I made using this 3# ingredient recipe,were all gone,I even had people asking me for the recipe,I said' sorry' but '' I can't, it's not my recipe to give away,and left it at that.These were very good cookies,thank you( who-ever ) this recipe belongs to.thank you the ''Q''

It’s a great quick recipe. I took others advice and added vanilla and a little baking soda before trying. I molded little balls in my hand then rolled in sugar. Once on parchment paper I did the crisscross with my fork.

I haven't made them yet, but I will. My mother used to make one huge cookie dough, then before chilling the dough, she would divide it up into several smaller chunks of dough and flavor each one  with chocolate, brandy, vanilla and whatever else. When all was done and baked we had a whole bunch of different cookies. She also had an attachment  on the mixer, that would create different shapes or combination of flavors.

Definitely a chewy version of a peanut butter cookie. I put chocolate kisses in mine after baking to make "blossoms."They did take longer to bake, and I would suggest keeping them small. Easy and yummy, though!

Great cookies! Very tasty! I was very skeptical because there was no flour in the recipe. I also didn't have parchment paper so I used aluminum foil and put the dough on the shiny side of the foil and they cooked and came off the foil perfectly. The only regret I have is I didn't make 2 batches instead of one!! I will make this recipe with my Grandson next time he's over. He will love it!!!!

Made hubby a batch of regular PB cookies and made these. Hadn't made them in such a long time I wanted to be sure of recipe amounts. I used swerve sweetener in my cookies because of the carbs in white sugar are bad for me and with swerve baked goods taste normal and bake up normal. They do not need anything more than this in them. I make them small and they are a cookie lovers dream. Firm on the outside so they hold together well enough, and almost fudgy on the inside. Rolled them into about 1/2 inch balls, and did not flatten them at all,  and they baked up nicely and I got a lot of cookies out of this batch. Thanks for the recipe . Its a keeper and once again will be my "go to " for holiday cookies so I can indulge and enjoy.

these are monster cookies so make sure they are spread out VERY far apart or it will be cookie cake. I sprinkled Canes' brown pourable topping sugar on them while they were still baking. You might consider 12 minutes instead of 8.

I did not make this particular recipe but I have made a recipe similar to this for years( found it in an old cookbook). This recipe is actually missing one key ingredient: vanilla. The recipe I followed for yrs uses 1 cup of peanut butter, 1 cup of sugar, 1 egg, and 1 tsp of vanilla. It really makes a difference using the vanilla. Try adding it to this recipe before baking. Also, make sure not to overbake because these cookies will come out hard as a rock.

This was a great recipe to let my 8 year old son take over! He was able to do every part. They tasted great and he added sprinkles just to add to the fun.

Pretty nice cookie, peanut butter flavor not overwhelming but balanced. However, I would lessen the sugar, it was a bit too sweet. Crunchy rim, chewy center, but quite crumby and “grainy,” I guess? I made it a second time, added baking soda, orange juice, and flour, way chewier, less crumby, and moister.

Made these last night 2 batches, 1 following the recipe exactly as written and they were really good.

The 2nd batch I made small tweaks, 1.tsp vanilla, 1/2 c Mini chocolate chips.

I dusted the top w reg. sugar as they cooled.

Both batches were gone this morning.  I live w a man and a parrot.  The parrot had half a cookie in his bowl, pretty sure he was framed.

I probably will not make these cookies again. Super easy but something was off about them. It was missing something, I think it may be the texture part and it just needs some butter or milk. If you like more basic and not-so-sweet of a cookie this is it! But if you love a warm, happily sweet cookie and a glass of ice cold milk then skip this recipe. If anyone has any idea why these cookies are alittle bit on the basic-y bland side let me know! I would really like to add something to this super easy recipe to  get a super yummy cookie!!

I made these and the 6- 8 minutes was no where long enough for them. I had to bake for 14 minutes and my oven runs HOT! Also they were very fragile and soft. I'll keep trying to perfect it cause I've made this recipe for yearsand they always turn out different.

I was skeptical about how they would turn out, it seemed so unreal. It took everything I had to stick to the recipe without adding or taking away from it, but I did it exactly like the recipe said and they came out GREAT! I can’t wait to make these cookies with my grandson. He’s going to love them.

I made these as a quick sugar craving fix. They're wonderful! Really simple and quite tasty. My only advice for these cookies is let them bake for five minutes then watch them so not to burn them because these suckers bake quick!!

This recipe actually turned out to be a really great last minute sweet when you don't have much in the house. I do recommend baking them for 10 minutes, at least that is what worked better for me. Overall, great recipe !

Good taste, I loved them but my husband and kids were thrown off by the texture. They are used to store bought peanut butter cookies and momma had a sweet tooth tonight and daddy polished off the ice cream last night so here we are making 3 ingredient cookies... I'm happy & my sweet tooth is satisfied!!

Pretty good. I am amazed at not having to use flour or milk. This is truly amazing. I am quite surprised. This is probably on a delicacy side of use. Meaning you may not be able to eat much but enjoy 1, 2, or 3 small or truffle size pieces.
And yes, technically I thought I might make a Bundt peanut butter cake by adding milk and flour. 
~Interesting

Very easy. First cookie recipe I ever made. We make these cookies quite often in my house. Perfect peanut butter cookie. Sometimes we add crushed up Nature Valley granola bars, it adds a sugary texture and they come out softer.

So simple and yummy! I doubled the recipe but kept the sugar at 1 cup so they weren’t too sweet. I flattened them with a fork and baked for 12 mins. The result was slightly crispy edges and chewy middles.

I did what a lot of the reviews said - added a bit of baking soda, salt, and vanilla. Super easy and quick recipe, which is exactly what I was looking for to satisfy our late night sweet tooth!

Yes, I get that if you add ingredients its no longer 3 ingredient peanut butter cookies.  But having said that, based on other reviewers, I did add a dash of vanilla, about a tsp of baking soda, 1/4 cup flour and switched half the sugar to brown sugar.  Seriously delicious.  Wish I didnt like them so much as ive eaten half the batch.

I agree, easy to make and  would be great to teach kids how to bake, however does not taste much like a peanut-butter cookie. I had to increase the bake time considerably.  Loved the idea to use parchment paper, easy clean up.

Slick and tasty. I don't even like pb cookies. I made them for my grandsons and had to taste one (of course) when they cooled a bit. Really a fast and easy cookie. I think you could make them as bar cookies as well.

Not to my taste. It was a sugar punch in the gut. Actually made me feel ill. Plus I found it had a strange aftertaste, but maybe that was the nausea haha. 
They cooked up nicely and were easy to make. They looked pretty.
 Just too sweet for me, which is strange because I've got a big sweet tooth but I found them too much.

Best and easiest peanut butter cookies ever. I use brown sugar instead of white sugar and sometimes I add peanut butter chips to give it an even better peanut butter flavor.

Great simple recipe. Substitute 1/3 cup honey for the sugar for a healthier version that packs more of a nutritious punch.

I have fixed these several times and they are a very good-tasting cookie!  I love that there's simple ingredients.  I live far away from my family and I send them treats each year right after Christmas because they love my cookies.  Other cookies i sent travel very well, but not these.  I sent them several times trying different methods, but they always crumble.  They get eaten anyway, but I'm disappointed they crumble.  I'll try something else next time.

My son loves to make these because they are quick, easy, and tasty! Cook time typically ends up being about 12 minutes.

My suggestion; use all the dough right away, try powered sugar, and make sure to slightly under bake. These were okay, they had a grainy texture. I think if I made them again I would try making with powered sugar to smooth the texture.  The batch made more than expected, so I saved half to make a couple days later with niece and nephew. 
They were so oily by then, that my little 3 year old niece didn't want to touch the dough and get her hands oily to roll them out. The dough also got a bit crumbly after a couple of days, which made them hard to shape.

Easiest cookies ever! And I figured they wouldn't be that great because of the lack of ingredients. But it goes to show you, a million ingredients doesn't make the cookie. These were fantastic.

I did try to take a picture right after the cookies were put into the plate because the recipe which was doubled made quite a few. But my husband attacked these cookies prior to taking a picture, so I’m thinking he loves the cookies. To me they have the best peanut butter flavor and are the most moist and chewy cookies I have ever made. The only change I made, and it’s because my husband prefers brown sugar when I doubled it, I used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar they are delicious!

Yes they were quick and easy but they weren’t anything special. It would have been faster to just eat a Tbsp of peanut butter by itself.

My favorite peanut butter cookie recipe ever. I made it original way and it was a hit with my kids. I also made two variations on this, one I added pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice to it then used it as an ice cream sandwich cookie. The second variation I simply added a splash of orange extract to the dough. It’s one of my best selling cookies.

I tried this recipe differently. At first I was going to use regular white sugar, as suggested. Instead, I used powdered sugar since it's smoother than granulated. It was better that way.

Wow...this is easy. I needed a quick and easy recipe to take to church tomorrow. Wanted to make some correctly with all the ingredients and a few without an ingredient to show the kids how important it is to follow instructions.  When you don't follow instructions, things don't turn out so well. I made these at 9 o'clock Sat night. It was quick and easy and I hope it will make my point. I'm sure the kids will enjoy the "good" ones with sugar.  Thanks!

Just awful. Flat, limp cookies. I only gave them one star because they did taste like peanut butter. How they got such rave reviews is beyond me. My husband, son & I each ate one & the rest went in the trash.

I added a  splash of vanilla & pinch of Soda I think i was a little short on PB  so it was a little gooy and tough to get good balls but they came out great. About 12 nice size cookies  I cooked an extra minute  or so &  I had firm crispy cookie top & bottom  with soft middle. Scrumptious  They were gone in an hour, Will try again  with more PB  Quick & easy

First time ever making peanut butter cookies so I wanted to find a easy & simple recipe. I tried this once & it cam out pretty good. I would lower the amount of sugar. I made this recipe with double ingredients for a bigger batch. For me it didn't bake within 6-8 mins though. Maybe 15 mins. Perhaps I made a mistake with the better? Either I would make it again when ever I have peanut butter lying around the kitchen.

What a fantastic quick peanut butter cookie to bake! I also love that I didn't have to add butter or salt, low sodium diet here and although there is some in the PB I didn't have to add more. My husband and 5 year old loved them and she enjoyed helping as well. Thanks for this recipe because we needed a cookie fix fast and this hit the spot!

OH my gosh. These were great. However, I did put a pinch of salt and soda. These were wonderful. Very easy, ya don't have to dirty every measuring cup and spoons in the house. I will always go to this recipe.

I substituted 1/4 cup of mashed banana as a binder to replace the egg because I'm vegan. The added banana actually went very well with the peanut butter flavor. 

The recipe states not to overcook, but at 8 minutes the cookies were actually less firm than when I first put them in the oven. Left them in for a total of probably 17-18 minutes and they were fine. 

Only issue is that the texture of the cookie was like sand,  and it was WAY too sugary. It left a pure sugar aftertaste in my mouth like I had chugged a packet of stevia even though I used plain white sugar. 

If I make these again, next time I'll use powdered sugar to avoid the gritty texture, and I may decrease the overall amount of sugar used, or perhaps choose a sugarless peanut butter instead of Jif.

I make this recipe often because it's just that good. For added taste we use honey roasted flavor peanut butter. Follow this recipe perfectly and they will come out perfect! The key is letting them sit after they are done!

Used Kirkland organic creamy peanut butter (no sugar), 1/2 cup Truvia, mini chocolate chips.  Not too sweet, but a fraction of the processed sugar and calories. SO GOOD and will make again and again!

I used walnut butter in place of the peanut butter ( put two heaping cups of walnuts in food processor and run for several minutes until it forms a smooth paste) and baked for slightly longer - 12-14 minutes.  They are delicious!

I think the recipe needs only half a cup of sugar.  The taste of the sugar over powered the flavor of the peanut butter, and the sugar made the texture of the cookie rocky. I wasn't satisfied with the overall taste. However, I can see how they'd be appealing to children as they are very sweet. I'll try a more traditional recipe next time.

Following some of the suggestions from other reviews, I added 1 tsp. of baking soda, 2 T. of flour, and a dash of vanilla.  I also added in chocolate M&Ms.  I did use 1 c. of sugar (1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar) and mixed it with the egg first. Then, I added the baking soda, flour, and mixed well.  I add some M&Ms, then the peanut butter.  I have used a mix of crunchy and creamy.  The second time around I did not pat them down just rolled them into a ball and let bake.  I tried baking them between 8-10 minutes.  The 8 minute mark was probably the best time.  The first time I made it, I only had dark brown sugar so they came out a little more tan than you would expect when using light brown sugar.  They were still tasty and moist.  ^_^  The hubby loved it.

Maybe it's because I'm new at cooking, but these cookies turned out awful.. They didn't cook very well so I left them in longer than eight minutes. They seem soft still but almost too soft? Like maybe I should have added another egg to hold it together better I'm really not sure. They seemed kind of weird when they came out and the taste isn't too bad, but a bit of a weird texture. I'm going to chalk this up to my inexperience in cooking. Maybe I'll try again in the future..

Fantastic.  I got an extreme case of the munchies (I have no idea why) and these really hit the spot.  So easy.  So rich.  I had to go the whole eight minutes before I thought they were ready.  They might could have cooked another minute or two after that.  But they firmed up pretty well after cooling on a rack.  I used a silicone pad instead of parchment paper and they slid right off.  The batter tends to be a bit crumbly.  I used a nitrile glove and sprayed the finger tips with canola oil and that made it easy to shape them and mold them together because they fell apart a bit when spooning onto the mat.  It also made it easier to flatten them a little for baking.  I might add a TBS of oil next time and see if that helps with the consistency.

Recipe says bake 6-8 mins, but mine were still raw after 8 mins.. I had to cook these for about 15 mins.  Even then, they fell apart very easily when transferring to the cooling racks, which was really frustrating.

I've been making this recipe since I was about 9 years old, ( Which isn't really that long considering I'm 16) and they have always been my favorite! These are super addicting, and always need a huge glass of milk! My dad likes these as well, because he can make them with minimal trouble and utensils. They're crumbly, and he a rich peanut butter flavor! They'll always be my go to!

Being only 3 ingredients, I expected them to be tasteless. I WAS WRONG! These cookies are so simple to make & taste  good. I add unsalted roasted peanuts & protein power to mine for a post-workout snack. Will definitely make again!!

I have made these twice for a teacher luncheon and both times they got rave reviews!!  My family also loves them!  Definitely a keeper!!  The only thing about this recipe I would change is the cook time.  Mine are never done in 6-8 minutes.  I cooked mine at least 10-12 minutes.  The 8 minutes ones were too doughy.

It may have been because I added chopped peanuts but the cookies were incredibly crumbly through the prepping/baking process (I placed them in last though and the dough was already pretty crumbly-looking beforehand) so I added a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil as well to further moisten them so they wouldn't fall apart when I flattened them with the fork.

The flavor is solid though (hard not to be when it's literally peanut butter, egg, and sugar) and the texture is overall moist and soft so it's an easy 4+ star recipe.

I made these a while back and my aunt who absolutely unequivocally HATES PEANUT BUTTER, looooved them. They're too easy to make and are wonderful for a late night snack. I used natural peanut butter so my sugar content per cookie isn't so high.

I really liked the way these turned out! I changed the recipe slightly. I used all the ingredients as they were listed, but I made the cookies bigger. I didn't roll them, I just spooned globs of dough onto the tray. The batch made 9 monstrous cookies. Before I put them in the oven, I decided to experiment and I put small pieces of butter on the top of each one. I stuck them in the oven and since they were bigger I cooked them for about 10 minutes, and they cooled for about 5. I was a little afraid they would turn out crumbly, but they were fine. I think the secret is in the proper amount of cooling time. Super easy cookies, prep time is only two minutes. Good luck!

These cookies were so easy to make that my 5 year old grandson and I made them with him doing most of it and I mostly just supervised. They came out great and yummy.

These cookies were great! The dough was very easy to make, though I did make some changes. Instead of 1 cup of sugar I used 1/2 of a cup of brown sugar and 1/2 of a cup of white sugar. I added a bit of flour too, to thicken the dough. I also used crunchy peanut butter, which gave it a nice texture. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I'm really not sure what I did wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. These turned out thin, greasy, and floppy. I couldn't even hold the cookie by the edge or it'd fall apart. I was so excited about this cookie based on the reviews but I'm certainly not going to try again with this recipe... so sad.

I've made these many times, and they're so easy and delicious! But I add a twist: as soon as they get out, make a dent in the cookies and drop in some jam or jelly! (strawberry and blueberry are best for this) This makes these PB cookies into PBJ thumbprint cookies! Also, use chunky! That adds more texture and a more peanut-y feel and flavor.  It's one of those recipes that don't just claim they're easy, they actually are amazingly easy! (and amazingly good!) Great recipe!

For a quick sugar tooth fix, it's not bad. But it definitely tastes like a 3 ingredient PB cookie. A little too sugary for our taste.

HORRIBLE!!!! This was like eating warm peanut butter balls and came out nothing like the picture suggests, I even went as far as rolling them into balls and then rolled them in sugar before baking. They came out  as flat melted peanut butter patties.  You may as well just leave the oven off and save $1.25 on the electric bill and eat the dough, No difference.  HORRIBLE! Threw them in the trash!

This is my 2nd time making these using this recipe. I got 26 cookies total. I used white sugar on one batch, light brown sugar on the other batch. Followed recipe as is otherwise. The texture is a lil grainy. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla to each batch. The part that was a huge let down to me was that these take LONGER than the baking time calls for. For whatever reason, the middles of these weren't getting done. They were still gooey after 20 min in the oven! The outter edges were getting done tho. I even flipped cookies over thinking that would help. Nope. They were very greasey too.However my hubby said they tasted fine. I like a soft pb cookie, but not a sogged out middle. I used Jif creamy pb.

I added the spash of vanilla and dash of salt, also.  My Grandson must have a gluten free diet and these are easy to make for him.  I got 3 dozen out of the recipe.

This was a quick and easy recipe. You can't go wrong with 3 ingredients. I would recommend using chunky peanut butter. I used smooth, but it would have been nice to have some texture and give it some added crunch! I will be making these again!

These are super easy to make and they are delicious!  Allow to cool on pan for at least two minutes before trying to move to cooling rack.  They crumble if you move them too soon, but they're fine if you wait a few minutes.  My gluten-free friend LOVES these!  Made exactly as directed, except I flattened with criss-cross fork marks (which directions don't say).

I loved it! Cooked mine for 6min- just so the edges were slightly browned, and then took them out to cool and finish cooking on the pan. They turned out perfect, yummy, melt in your mouth, deliciousness. Thanks for the recipe

Use to make these years ago, Hubby loved PB Cookies! Just made them tonight for our little PB lovers. Perfect when you want something SIMPLE & guaranteed to have these 3 on hand. And, since NO ONE wants to use the end of the PB Jar this is the perfect solution. And, I Never Used The Parchment. I found that My oven needs 10 mins. But,  KEEP CHECKING cause a min or 2 over cooked & they taste a little burnt. (My Last Batch =(. I smash them with a fork criss cross, before I put, but, I have forgotten & done it when I checked them at 8 mins.

The whole family loves them. They're super easy and quick to throw together and bake all within 15 mins. When we run out, nobody minds making another batch. Sometimes I throw in a dash of salt, baking soda and vanilla, just because, but I don't really notice a difference. Simple, easy and fun for kids to feel like they're doing something big in the kitchen...

I made these from start to all-cleaned-up in 20 minutes, and I'm not a speedy cook!  I almost always have these three ingredients in my house, so we'll never be dessert-less again.  The cookies were a little crumbly, but I think that's because I used crunchy peanut butter -- I'll try creamy next time.

Fantastic! Very easy, and simple recipe. All of the ingredients are things I usually keep on hand anyway. I followed the recipe exactly, my only deviations were adding a tsp of vanilla (will help along with that overly sugary taste that some reviewers mentioned) and putting them in the freezer for 15 min after taking them out of the oven which helped to stiffen then up. I also left them in for 11 min, checking in on them after 9. 

I would like for those that left negative reviews to go into detail about why it didn't work out for them as this is a really easy recipe, and seems pretty hard to mess up. 

Word to the wise: If you're not a PB fan, DON'T try this as it is every bit of a pb cookie through and through!

When I pulled these out of the oven, grease was blotched all over the tray! They still tasted okay, but they are very crumbly, best to bake them for 10 or more minutes, for they were extremely soft and difficult to hold. Taste best with ice cream.

I love these cookies, they are so fast. I changed the white sugar to brown sugar. They have a richer taste and a caramel smell when baking. Everyone loves them and you always have the ingredients handy.     Nancy Legge

Love these. I cooked them for 12 minutes instead of 8 and it cooked the sugar a little better. After they cool completely they they become perfectly crunchy like a good peanut butter cookie!

I  had to bake them for much longer than it says in the directions. If I had left it at even 8 mins I would've had hot raw cookie dough. I ended up baking them for 12 mins. They were still delicious! I would bake them again.

They're not bad if you are on a tight budget, or in the mood for cookies but don't have the extra ingredients. My family loved them but I thought they were ok.  I used the Natural Jif pb in mine which is probably the reason why I think they are ok.

If I could, I would give this recipe a 3.5 because I made 12 cookies--like the video suggested--they were a little bit too big. And since I did it at 325 in a covenction oven for only 7 minutes, they were under cooked. I will make them again, but make sure to put them in a few minutes longer. The main reason I even thought about using this recipe was because I wanted to make my gluten free and dairy free friend some cookies. Thanks for the recipe!!  :)

If you're a Peanut Butter lover, this sure is the BEST recipe to use. The cookies come out beautiful every time, even if you over bake them, they still are really yummy when they are crumbly. Also, the recipe is so easy, I have already memorized it and whenever I visit my boyfriend's parents, they always love when I bake them a sweet treat. LOVE IT

I was craving something sweet. I was so excited to find this recipe! I didn't have much in the cabinets and I didn't want to drive to the store. I LOVE peanut butter so naturally I had it. This is the simplest recipe ever. It takes no time to make from start to finish. This will definitely be a keeper recipe. YUM!

These were perfect! I'm never picky when it comes to a peanut butter cookie and while snowed in I had just enough supplies to bake these.

I'm not what the other reviews were saying about them being burnt, or falling apart.  I doubled the recipe and they came out light and beautiful brown on top.  I baked them for 14 minutes.

If you love peanut butter these are perfect for you. :)

My favorite part about making this cookie (other than it was extremely fast and simple to make) is that I found that the peanut butter so much more flavorful than recipes that include flour. This recipe is a keeper for me!

I made these cookie according to the recipe. I wanted something sweet that was quick, and boy oh boy is that what I got. I am not a fan though... it will give you a mild heart attack along with instant diabetes. Oh my, it's way too sugary and they all fell apart when anyone touched them. I did get my sweet fix, but sadly, I have find a different recipe. Mixed emotions.

Wow, this is an amazing cookie! I had to bake for about 10 minutes though, at 350°, and yes they do harden up a tad but not much so don't be put off by the softness when you pull them out.  I baked a double batch, 2 cups of each and it made 48 cookies since I made them on the smaller side.I can't believe how delicious these cookies are though! So easy and worth it.

Super quick & easy snack. I even half the recipe for a quick dozen. Took a little longer than 8 min. Not sure if it's the altitude of New Mexico? I'm a peanut butter lover so I think they taste great!

Its was great! I put a little brown sugar in it, and I loved it! Btw if your cookies turned out crumbly then either add baking soda or just put tinfoil over it and let it cooldown

I had my doubts about this recipe, but decided to try it anyway. 
Absolutely love the texture and taste of the final product, they're chewy and soft just like a regular fresh baked cookie. I made my dough with low fat peanut butter and truvia instead of sugar and they turned out amazing. 
I also made my cookies a little bit larger so I cooked them for 9 minutes and then 3 more after adding a peanut butter cup to the middle. This recipe produced 15 palm sized cookies for me. Will definitely be making more of these.

Too sweet for me.  The texture wasn't my favorite either, as after 11 minutes at 350, they were dark and soft inside.  Taken together, I didn't like them.  My favorite cookie is peanut butter, just a more traditional kind.  What I did like was how easy they are to make.  .

I did not make any changes and it was not my favorite peanut butter cookie.  However, it was super easy to make.  If I was on a low carb diet, I could easily see this cookie being added to my list of delish things to eat (by using splenda or stevia), but I personally prefer a traditional peanut butter cookie instead

I will start by saying that I hate to bake because I have the attention span of a two year old and hate measuring. I gave in to this recipe because there were only two things to measure, each was a one cup measurement, and I am an adult, afterall. These were fast, easy, and delicious. I did not have a full cup of any one type of peanut butter, so I used a combination of honey-roasted, creamy, and crunchy butters. Because this recipe yielded 19 cookies I topped some with strawberry preserves, others with chocolate chips, a few with Heath Bar Crunch, and left a few untouched so I could judge the recipe appropriately. Can't wait for the family to get home and taste the flavor!! Thanks for this recipe.

DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE.  These are the worst "cookies" I have ever made.  They are not done in 6-8 minutes and taste horrible.

I made these cookies and we thought they were delicious. Very interesting to only have three ingredients but good nonetheless. We thought they were a little too sweet. We are going to add chocolate chips next time

I followed the recipe exactly, although mine needed more time in the oven. My preschool grandson helped me make these and pronounced them delicious! Very easy, no need to tweak it at all.

I started making this recipe over 30 years ago.  My original recipe included 1 tp of vanilla. For a less sweet cookie use peanut butter where peanuts are the only ingredient.   When I make these cookies I like to mix the sugar and vanilla, then add the egg.  Once will combined, then add the peanut butter.  Keep staring until the dough stiffens a little.  For a chocolate fix, add 1/2 cup mini chocolate pieces.  Just drop them on the cookie sheet.

When I mixed everything together the batter seemed a bit thick so I added a little bit of canola oil to smooth it out a little more. I also added a cap full of vanilla extract and a sprinkle of cinnamon. My fiancé loves them!! I may add a sprinkle of salt on top before I pop them in the oven next time I make them. They are otherwise very delicious!

Such a great, simple recipe to encourage everyone to try their hand at baking. I couldn't resist the slight changes recommended in other reviews (1 tsp baking soda and a dash of vanilla) but I am confident these would have been great without the changes. The final product was so light, sweet and tasty. We all really liked them and it took all of 15 minutes total!

I made a vegan version because I had oil in the house. Basically they taste like I'm eating peanut butter flavored sugar. Tasty, but I feel gross after eating one. 
Maybe with egg or applesauce it would turn out better.

Made it with Splenda for my diabetic husband.  It's a winner and it's quick.  The cookies were delicate and tender.  Tried them with blackberry jelly on top, too.  Yumm!

8 minutes in the convection oven was perfect.

I also dipped the fork in Splenda when I did the cross-hatched top.  Didn't have the nice sugary texture but made it easy to keep the cookie from sticking to the tines.

This is a keeper.  Will make it again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We love these cookies!  They are so easy to make, are soft & chewy, & don't make a huge amount, so are great for just the 2 of us.  I use chunky peanut butter in mine.

This is a great recipe. It was easy and the cookies taste great.  Because of some of the negative reviews, I cooked one batch at first just in case I needed to make adjustments. I taste the first batch; Awesome. Then, I added a little vanilla to the rest of the batter: more awesome.

Theses came out really yummy! I added only a little bit of vanilla for a little more flavoring and sprinkled sugar on top it them before they went into the oven. I was going to double up on this recipe to make a whole bunch of cookies, but I figured that I would try a regular batch first since I was skeptical about how they would come out using only a few ingredients. I did have to cook them longer in our oven, but that could have just been because it's a new oven and I used the convection conversion option, who knows, but  I definitely will be making these again!

This is a great fast cookie. I prepare enough to fill my empty peanut butter jar and pull them out roll some up and have fresh cookies on demand.  If you like almond use about 3/4 teaspoon of almond extract makes a amazing cookie.

I used half brown sugar and half granulated sugar.  These cookies were so tasty. I definitely give them a ten. If you're concerned about them being too sweet which i saw from some of the reviews mix the peanut butter and half the sugar and taste it before adding the egg ( whisk it separately) that way you can determine how much sugar you want to use. Yummy

My 5 year old grandson and I are trying different cookie recipes since he is learning how to bake with grandma. He's a natural in the kitchen. We made these cookies together. My grandson chose JIF crunchy peanut butter. We made 24 cookies for our family and they were all gone in 3 days. We love these 3 ingredient peanut butter cookies. They 're super easy to make and even easier to enjoy. These are my favorite cookies to bake so far.

Thought it was a really great cookie!!! Really sweet, but what do you expect?! It's a cookie!! Baked for 12 minutes and it came out great!! Did not have parchment paper so used foil and greased with shortening.  Would recommend it to anyone who wants a delicious, easy peanut butter cookie. Will probably make again!!

Made it with raw sugar and it didn't melt as well as the finer sugar so next time will make sure to put it in the vitamix to create a finer grain. Other than that...super! Will definitely make them again...might add chocolate chips to them too!

Wow. Wow. Wow!! Having grown up with amazing bakers and now married to an incredible chef,  I just kept thinking, "there's no way this will be good..". How wrong I was!! I will never use any more ingredients! I will say that I was glad I tasted one warm as I had put a tad too much sea salt on them (forget the flaky sea salt requirement...the idea is to balance the sweet with just a bit of savory so if you have a salt packet or two you'll be golden).  Easy fix by sprinkling a bit of granulated sugar on them while they're warm. I also used one big cookie sheet and (since I don't like cookies that are soft) rotated them at 15 minutes for a total bake time of 30 mins. I think my wire rack must be crucial so they don't get hard but if I were a culinary genius I wouldn't be looking at 3 ingredient recipes so who knows? ! I have a 5 star palate and a 5 minute interest in MAKING good food. Yahoo! This is both! I'd pay all day long for these in a bakery and I am picky. Rock on friends!

I used the main recipe as a base and went from there......I added sour cream, cinnamon, oatmeal and nutella. I also spread it in a cookie pan and cut into squares. Baking time takes a little longer but it is a yummy nice and thin and chewy end result. Next time I will place some dark chocolate ganache underneath, similar to Lacey's cookies from trader joes.....which are my fave.

These turned out great! I was too nervous sticking with just the 3 ingredients so added a pinch of baking soda and a small splash of vanilla.

I didn't have any white sugar so I used brown sugar. Not sure how good it is in comparison, but it wasn't bad at all. My cook time was 9 minutes. After letting it sit for maybe 5 minutes it's a perfect cookie. Taste wise I felt like it was missing something but it could be because of the sugar I used. Probably would make again if I was in desperate need of something sweet and had nothing else.

A while ago, I tried a recipe like this and failed miserably. Today I followed the recipe, added some vanilla extract and crushed pretzels, kept them in the oven for about 5 mins, let them cool and got some of the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had. Deliciousness, from start to finish, in 20 minutes. Couldn't be happier

These cookies disappeared before they even had a chance to properly cool, my family loved them so much!  I substituted sugar for Splenda Brown Sugar (1 cup) and it worked out great.

For best stability let the cookies cool completely.  If you can keep people away from them that long ;)

Making these was fun, quick, and easy. Little kids love helping! Anyways, we added some chopped almonds to the batter. We baked them for 10 or 11 minutes, but when the were done, they literally tasted like legit straight peanut butter. Next time we make peanut butter cookies, I think that I'll choose a different recipe.

I was a bit skeptical about these cookies because they only had 3 ingredients but they were pretty good. I also added nutella in the process. They taste amazing but at first the cookies were really soft and I had to put them in the oven for double the time that it said but at the end they turned out really good and really addictive. Personally, I prefer cookies with more crunch and slightly harder but the cookies were still great!

Honestly I thought, 'Hey its three ingredients its gonna be a decent snack'. All the comments I've gotten were positive and they tasted amazing! but  I would say to cook them longer. I cooked my second batch for 10-12 minutes. They came out amazing over all. I am a beginner so this is just right.

Easy to make with only a few ingredients that are usually available without shopping! A little sweet, but good.

I use to make these all the time. I called them WIC cookies. I was a single mom of two boys and was eligible for WIC (free milk,eggs,peanut butter,cereal,beans for children under 5) If you didn't have sugar you could always borrow 1 cup of sugar. My kids loved them and its a treat we could afford.

Oh so delicious. I've made these time and Tim again and everyone always loves them! I will say though, if you love at a high altitude (as I do) you might want to bake them a few mins longer. But amazing.

I put butterscotch caramel in the middle and folded the dough over the top and it worked out great! When you bit in to the crunchy peanut butter cookie warm caramel oozed out and it was scrumptious!

I have made at least ten different recipes for peanut butter cookies over the past year and this was by far the best.  First of all these taste like peanut butter.  I have a problem with all of the recipes I tried previously not tasting like peanut butter to my family or just very faintly.  This are a rich,  creamy, cookies that are just heavenly.  The only change I did to my batch was add a small splash of real vanilla.  We love them and will be making them often here.

The idea of using only 3 ingredients was great. The cookie tastes rather good! My only complaint was the cooking time. I had to bake my cookies for 15 minutes before they were remotely done.

Wow! Only 3 ingredients can make a cookie? I was skeptical at first but it really worked! It's a simple and delicious recipe. The only thing that I'd change about the recipe is the amount of sugar in the recipe. I'd suggest  go down to 3/4 cup sugar.

These were quick and easy to whip up. It made 24 cookies overall. They did taste great. The only issues I had was the cooking time. 6-8 minutes was not enough. I had to put them in between 10-12 minutes. Also, I did add some honey and vanilla extract to give more flavor.

Loved it!     No one would expect cookies this good to come from such a deceptively simple recipe... I added a quarter teaspoon of real vanilla extract, and about a half teaspoon of honey. The cookies came out super soft, with the most amazing peanut butter flavor.. I made a classic (flour brown sugar peanut butter and butter) peanut butter cookie recipe at the same time as this recipe just in case this recipe  didn't come out the way I wanted it to. All the other cookies were awesome list three ingredient recipe won hands down!

OMG these turned out way better then I expected! I added a table spoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to the recipe and they were to die for. I recommend flattening them out so you won't be overwhelmed with the peanut butter taste. this is a great recipe that even the kids will love. I give it a 10/10.

I love this recipe! However, I cooked one batch for 10 minutes and the other batch for 8, I like the firmer 10 minute batch. If you want a healthier cookie use brown sugar

Delicious, fast and easy.  I had 15 minutes to come up with something for a surprise visit from my grand kids.  Will definitely make again.  I did use half white and half brown sugar and JIF p'nut butter.

I ve just made a batch. Very tasty, a bit on the sweet side. Originally baked for 7 minutes at 350°F, but they were like pudding. Baked approximately 3 more minutes. I added a touch of vanilla and sprinkled ginger in the recipe. Thank you!

I love making these for our church crowd, as there is always someone who needs gluten-free. I stretch it by adding another egg and 1/2 cup of almond flour. Very yummy!

I was craving peanut butter cookies at 9:30 pm. These were ok for a late-night fix, but not as good as more traditional recipes. Also, after 8 minutes mine were nowhere near done. It took close to 15 minutes, even though I flattened them with a fork before baking.

I would use chocolate peanut butter since just regular, tastes way too much like peanuts, and is also too sweet.

This would be my recipe:  
1 Cup of chocolate peanut butter
1/2 Cup of powdered sugar
1 Egg

You're welcome ;)

I have been using this recipe for YEARS!!!! And I love, love, love, it!!! I got the recipe from Tony Danza and thought he was crazy to only use three ingredients. I was skeptical to say the least, but tried it anyway and was shockingly surprised by how good they were.  I must say though, the recipe as, is what I think makes it great, totally easy to remember, quick and easy to make, cleanup is a breeze with the elimination of flour etc.  So those of you adding baking soda, flour and all these other little additions, I personally don't think it makes the cookie butter it just clutters up a true three ingredient peanut butter cookie. I mean honestly if it has more than three ingredients is it still a three ingredient cookie recipe?

The base recipe is good, it's quick, sweet and peanut buttery! But add a bit o' vanilla, approx 1/4 cup of flour or less, and a pinch of baking powder and voilà! The pickiest teenager in the state of Virginia LOVED them so....that says something! Fun recipe!

Tried this out with my small kids and it was fun to make and can't get much easier.  I only had about 3/4 cup of peanut butter which I didn't realize until after we'd already added the full cup of the sugar and egg, but they still turned out great. I added a splash of vanilla and used natural pb (which is a little more oily than other kinds).  We will make again and again... my picky kids are already asking for more!

Very simple, and simply a great peanut butter cookie!!! I didn't change a thing, loved it!  I did take the time to cream the egg and sugar together until nice and smooth!! They do bake very fast, must watch them! I only baked mine for 8 min. After they cooled they were a little crunchy on outside and chewy on inside, just the way we like them!!

Love this recipe.   Have been making these cookies for close to 40 years (so no, it wasn't developed as a low carb diet cookie). I used crunchy peanut butter because that is what I had on hand.  If you love peanut butter and want your cookie to scream peanutty flavor, then this is it. If you only like peanut butter, try the other ones with more ingredients to mask the peanut butter flavor.

I don't see how this recipe could get any bad reviews, and that is coming from a person who has never liked peanut butter cookies my entire life! You won't regret making these, don't heed the  advise of the 1 star people.

Great taste. DH loved them too. I confess that I turned them into 6 ingredient cookies, but they were still very simple, and I mixed up a batch in about 5 minutes. I used natural creamy PB since I hate Jif (which has added sugar). I added about 1/2 tsp baking soda (based on another reviewer's comment), 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 2 Tbsp coconut flour so the dough had enough body to make a ball.  Cooking time was also increased to about 10 minutes. Delicious!

On a whim, I added 1/3 cup of gluten free oats and 2/3 cups of chocolate chips.  They were so delicious!  They cooked up like little chunks of goodness.  I will be adding this to my regular cookie line up.  Super easy to make.

These cookies are very simple and easy to make. With 3 ingredients and a very short prep/bake time you can have flourless cookies. We enjoyed them. I would say the cookies actually do need to cool quite some time otherwise the cookie is much to soft and falls apart.

This was so simple and delicious - and great for those on a budget! I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the mix and rolled them into little balls. Pressed with a fork and sprinked with a bit of sugar. My son had one...then two...then three...! A hit at this house!

Taste great, but it took longer to cook. I did not use parchment paper.  I did press a fork into them.  I cooked for 15 minutes and gave up. They were still very very soft.  Once they cooled they were still soft, but crisp enough to hold together and be an actual cookie.  Very easy to make and yummy.

This is delicious!  I would have given a 5 star except for one thing - too much sugar.  I think the sugar could easily be reduced to 1/2 cup and it would still be tasty.  I will try it next time with 1/2 the sugar.  Otherwise - excellent.

It was very high in calorie, but super good!!! You can use less sugar in the recipe, and add some flour instead.

came out too crumbly.  Not enough of anything to hold it together. When you pick them up, they just fall into a crumbled mess.  Not worth the effort.

I love this recipe. It's so convenient when I'm low or out of ingredients that you would normally use. The only thing I have changed is that I only put 1/2 a cup of sugar because a full cup makes the cookie gritty and I don't care for gritty cookies. Love love love these cookies though. This recipe is easy and fast to make. I've told everyone I know about these.

Everyone was saying to flatten them, but I was willing to wait a tad longer (15 minutes) and leave them in a messy spoon dollop. I did use chunky PB and added Chocolate Chips.....  They turned out large and amazing!

I'm obsessed with these.  They're even better than doing it the "real way," with flour and butter and all that jazzeroo.  I added a tsp of vanilla & baking powder, and chilled the dough for 30 minutes for better consistency.  I also add a hershey kiss in the middle of each cookie after they come out of the oven, before they set.  They won't look done when you take them out, but just wait like 10 minutes for them to cool! My gluten-free friends all worship me now for introducing these :)  I love that they're low-effort, but still amazing.
P.S. I've had bad luck with dark pans and letting the oven get hotter than 350.  Cookies get really flat and caramelized.

Alright so I made these today in the afternoon because I was craving something nice and sweet.. I got exactly that! I have to say though I tweaked the recipe by using brown sugar (we didn't have white sugar in the house). However, I was really concerned about the consistency as they were cooking, they seemed way too watery and unstable to even take off the tray once they had "cooked". I took them out when I personally thought they were cooked. First one I tried to get off crumbled to pieces and I was so upset, BUT! If you guys have this problem when cooking them I have the solution!! I know you might want fresh warm cookies but I put them in the freezer for about 15 mins to make them harden and I didn't have the crumbling problem anymore :) They taste really good, a bit too sweet and hard to handle and a bit messy, if it wasn't for that I would give them a 10/10.

Loved these! I'm overdue in my pregnancy at the moment, so I REALLY do not feel like going to the store, I tried to find a recipe with as little ingredients as possible and this was perfect. It was so easy, I didn't change anything as far as the ingredients. I did cook mine for 10 minutes though. Glad to find such a delicious, simple cookie recipe. Definitely satisfied my cookie craving.  :)

i have to disagree with the people who didn't care for this recipe, but it might be because I altered it just a tiny bit by not using plain peanut butter. I used Peter Pan Honey Roast Creamy peanut butter. This made the dough a little stickier and harder to work with, so I just dropped them onto the cookie sheet with a spoon and didn't worry overly about shape or the criss-cross fork marks, since I was making these specifically for myself to try them out. Also, I found that they need to go on the top shelf of the oven or the bottoms can get browner than you might care for, even in 6 minutes or so. Personally, I like the edges a bit crisp, so they were perfect for me, and the honey in the peanut butter added just an extra touch of sweetness to the cookies that I imagine the recipe doesn't have when made with regular peanut butter. So consider giving these extremely simple cookies a try with my little twist - you might find yourself pleasantly surprised!

I searched for an easy low cost peanut butter cookie recipe for a church bake sale. These cookies were a hit! I've made them at least a hundred times. There are NEVER any left over. Not deviate from the recipe. Don't try to use all natural peanut butter or sugar substitute. Do it EXACTLY how the recipe calls it to be done. I'm making them tonight to gift my co-workers for Christmas. Enjoy!

These cookies are magnificent! Very rich and peanut buttery! I followed the advise of one review and beat the sugar with the eggs before adding the peanut butter. My cookies did not tun out grainy and because I let them cool completely on the pan I had no problem with crumbly cookies. The edges are crisp and the middles are chewy. I doubled the recipe which made three dozen cookies. I will certainly make these again!

This is the peanut butter cookie I grew up making. Don't add a thing to it. Be sure to keep an eye on them while they're baking. They turn black real fast, if you get distracted. This recipe works in the cookie press, too.

I was looking for a gluten free cookie recipe as I have three friends at work that have a severe wheat allergy. Fortunately they aren't allergic to peanuts! I doubled the recipe and used a cup of white sugar and a cup of brown sugar. It was a hit with everyone! I did make sure these ladies got first crack at them. All three asked for the recipe. Gluten free flour is very expensive; a gluten free cake mix is around $5! So to find a recipe like this that is so simple and inexpensive, that tastes good is great! I give it a 5 Star rating because it's an easy recipe, less than 5 ingredients, and the cookies taste great.

Super easy and turned out delish.  I did add a pinch of baking soda and a pinch of salt like other people suggested.  I just ate one the 2nd day and it's still soft.  I did roll the dough into balls before smashing with fork, instead of just spooning it on.  Definitely will make again.  Next time with chocolate chips.

I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 crunchy and 1/2 creamy.  Also 1- tsp. of sea salt.   After reading some reviews I baked them at 325 for about 10 minutes.  Just till the bottoms were lightly browned.

When i first saw this recipe i was a little skeptical. But i tried it anyway. First of all these are super good. Second of all there really sweet. Its something you definitely want to have a drink with.  I also would like to add that how you cook it is weird. I put mine in for 5 mins and then i checked them by putting a tooth pic in it. if it is very "dowy" or somewhat liquefied there not cooked. mine was medium cooked. In the directions it said not to cook them over brown but that's not going to be the case. I put them in for another 4 mins which is 9 mins which for me was perfect. These are really easy and fast i am definitely going to make these again.

I've made these before, and they've turned out pretty well. However, for the love of God, do not use unsalted peanut butter....just don't do it.

Pleasantly surprised at this simple recipe. It's very sweet, so if you're not a fan of a rich dessert you might want to steer clear of this recipe. To cut some of the sweetness, I added a bit of sea salt to them before baking, but that's just a personal preference of mine. (I love salty and sweet together!) It doesn't quite compare to the popular standard peanut butter cookie, but great for a late night, quick fix!

My 13 yr old daughter made these and I was nervous to try one. But these are the best peanut butter cookies I've had in a very long time. So simple but so tasty. We no longer use any other recipes for peanut butter cookies and we make these often. Thanks for simplifying this.

I looked at the reviews for this recipe and decided to give it a try. I was missing a couple ingredients for the Betty Crocker recipe I use, so this one looked ok. I did add a pinch of salt and a tsp of baking soda as some others did, and they came out GREAT! Needed a quick dessert for work tomorrow, and this is going to be a hit!

Very good!  Did read reviews and added pinch of baking soda and vanilla (ok,  now more than 3 ingredients, but still super simple), rolled in sugar and flattened with fork.  Cooked for 15 minutes .  Yum!!

Okay, I read the reviews, it took all my strength not to add vanilla. For flavor I give this 3 stars, but for ease I would say 5 stars, so met in the middle at 4! I am one of those peope who like to eat pb with a spoon - but the pb flavour was a bit intense for me as well.  The recipe was certainly quick and easy, but miss the old vanilla, soda and a bit of flour.

The only problem with this recipe is that it's the definition of easy.  Any other recipe in the world labeling itself as easy has to go against this recipe and it will fail.  I literally made these cookies while my wife and her friend went out to the store for less than an hour.  They came home to these cookies and just gushed.  If only I knew about this recipe as a bachelor...

No changes. This was a perfect recipe to make with my 4-year-old son. It was easy and the cookies were delicious! We did roll the dough into balls and then smash them down with a fork to make cross-hatches before baking.

Not quite as good as other peanut butter cookies, but worth making because of how easy they are to make.  Compared to other recipes, these are very sweet, and have a sugary texture.

I made these tonight.  I read the reviews and was a little nervous about how they would turn out.  I followed a reviewer's advice and mixed the egg and the sugar first, then added the peanut butter.  I baked the cookies for 9 minutes, then cooled them on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.  Then cooled them on cooling racks.  My daughter loved them!  She said they tasted like Nutter Butters :)

Really loved it! This is my first time making it. After the first batch (I multiplied it by 4), I went with 7 minutes instead of 6. I would let it sit for about five minutes before putting them on a cookie rack. I tried to do it right away and they were too soft.

These are pretty good..to make these off the chart awesome, I read through reviews and followed one suggestion to add vanilla and a little flour except I used CarbQuick flour to make them lower carb, doubled the recipe and used 2 cups of crunchy peanut butter, 4 tblsp of CarbQuick, 1 3/4 cup of Splenda and 1/4 cup Lakanto Golden and two eggs.  This made them AWESOME!  Slightly crumbly, very flavorful without being too sweet and perfect for us low carb/sugar free dieters.   Not too mention super quick and easy cleanup.

For only using three ingredients they come out pretty tasty!  Easy...worth making again.  I pressed them pretty flat with a fork before baking and they cooked thoroughly in time allotted.

I've been making these for years, ever since my cousin told me about them. She was teaching bible school and found these cookies are a great and simple way to let kids get in the kitchen and make something they'll enjoy. Only difference in the recipes is we throw a little vanilla extract in. After you press the raw cookies w/ a fork, you can either sprinkle with a bit of sugar or sea salt. The kids love them!

They taste a little off but not bad.  Loved how easy cause my son could measure and mix.   I added some semi-sweet morsels which are yummy.  Just the texture of the cookie kind of strange.

Good for a very quick cookie for my husband late at night.  It's pretty crumbly until they cool significantly.  They don't have the yummy melt in your mouth texture of a great PB cookie, however.

We make these cookies regularly and they are always a hit.  I use all natural peanut butter (just the peanuts and salt kind) and they turn out great.  The only caution I have is to make sure the peanut butter is completely stirred so that the oil from the peanuts gets evenly distributed, otherwise the consistency of the dough is off.  Great and simple recipe.

I made this with a rif on the jelly addition, HUGE FAN of chocolate and peanut butter.....therefore I added a chocolate ganache to the top of these. HUGE, ENORMOUS, MODO HIT in my house. They didn't even last a day. Even my husband (not a sweets fan) downed these.  Although he LOVES peanut butter. Will make again this time plain and maybe I can keep one or two in the cookie jar!!!

They turned out really good.  Made them with coconut I had that I just tossed in.  I tried to add different things before I baked them by adding like chocolate then tasting them.  I liked them with just coconut and then melted some chocolate and drizzled the tops of the cookies.  yum

I cooked these for at least 12 minutes and they were still somewhat raw, but did firm up after they cooled down.  My first batch were a little raw inside, 2nd batch burned a little, but I would certainly try them again.

This recipe is SO easy and the cookies are SO good.  I can't understand, though, why people are changing that recipe up. Why? If you want a cookie with more than 3 ingredients, go look for a different recipe. The whole point of this one is the utter ease of whipping together a great cookie! Some people just cannot leave well enough alone.

I did use 1/2 crunchy and 1/2 creamy peanut butter just for a lil texture

I love making these because they're so simple and they taste awesome. Just be sure to have some milk on hand, they're also very rich. I add chocolate chips to mine to make them even better. They're little bites of heaven.

I made this recipe because my friends raved about it.  But when it came time to make, they just didn't have the taste and texture that I normally look for in a peanut butter cookie.  Too chewy for my taste.  I think I'll go back to the peanut butter cookie with flour in it.

This is my new favorite pb cookie recipe! I used Jiff whips peanut butter instead of regular, they turned out perfect! I added Reece's Pieces to the mix and my whole family loved them, they were gone in 2 days! I had to cook them for about 10-11 minutes to have them cook completely, they will definitely look underdone when you take them out but they harden a good amount while cooling!

I wasn't a fan. :( I love peanut butter cookies, and even though I assumed they wouldn't be the best I've ever tasted, I expected them to be better (based on all the great reviews). I liked that they weren't dry, but they didn't resemble a cookie much for me. I won't make these again.

Amazing, followed to a T...just the right amount of chewy. I rolled in sugar, criss crossed & baked for 12mins.  This will replace my "classic recipe". Thank you!

Love them, the first time I made them per recipe but put a tiny bit of blackberry jam in a small indent center.   Delish!  Then made them with Splenda and chocolate chips but they crumbled too easily.

It work but the bottoms were burnt. Just chang the timing a little. 5 to 6 minutes will do. They may be moist on the inside. Just let them cool and it will be perfect. Oh and one more thing sprinkle a little sugar to the tops of the cookies when they are done cooling. That will give them more emph

I doubled this recipe, added one c each of raw, organic sugar and light brown sugar, only the whites of the eggs and added 1 Tbsp of Mexican artificial vanilla flavoring. I have a TINY oven (I live in an efficiency at the moment) so I baked them for only 7 mins and they came out PERFECTLY! I DID do the crosshatching of course. I think it was an oversight on the recipe's author's part but it doesn't matter, you know it has to be done, right? The last pan, I had to rush out so I left it in the oven but with it turned off and when I came home they were these nice crispy, peanut-y crackers and my thought was that with a bowl of rich chocolate ice cream, they'd be the BOMB. I think I have dessert MADE!

Perfect!!!  I really don't like "cakey" peanut butter cookies and because this pretty much only had peanut butter and sugar, I figured it would be just right.  This is great and really easy.  The kids loved them too.

Baking for a lactose intolerant friend and these looked great. Really easy to make, but the actual baking part wasn't very consistent. My first batch went in for about 7 minutes and, though the top looked good, the bottom of the cookie was uncooked in the middle. When I put them on for a few minutes longer, nothing really changed. My second batch went in for over 8 minutes and got way too hard. Maybe I did something wrong, I don't know, but they're good if you like the taste of raw peanut butter...

I want to note that I changed this recipe to make it healthy and THM compliant (makes an S snack) by replacing the 1 c. sugar with 1 c. flaxseed meal and a good teaspoon or so of stevia (liquid). Definitely do NOT overbake! A great, super easy cookie!

Was a very chewy and crumbly cookie.  But I let it cool 5mins on baking sheet before transferring to a plate to cool. Didn't have issues with it falling apart.  I baked a second batch that became a 5 ingredient cookie, using 1/2 Cup of flour and a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  Baked for 10 mins. In the end I love both but I loved my second batch since it was a little more of a cookie that held itself together well which I liked better.

Tried this recipe when I first started baking. They turned out perfectly! I also made a cookie pizza with this recipe and cooked it 14 minutes. I would recommend adding a dash of milk to make the cookies chewier.

These cookies are fantastic!!!!  Didn't change a thing, made them with the kids and we ate them as fast as they came out of the oven.  The best thing, other than they taste great, is that with only 3 ingredients they are so easy and fast to make that any time the kids want them I make them.  No fuss no muss!!!!

I'm a big fan of peanut butter and this 3 ingredients peanut butter cookies are so good. The first batch I made, I made too big so they came out still not done so the second batch I made, came out just right. I left them in the oven a little longer than they say on here. 10-12 minutes and they are yummy! I'm not a pro cooker, so for these to come out the way they did with just 3  ingredients, you should try them for yourself. Like I said I messed up on the first batch because I made them too big, but the second batch, awesome! Thank you for this recipe. I love recipes like these, especially breakfast lunch or supper recipes that calls for very little ingredients.

These are great and easy to make.  We just moved to Angola, Africa and it is hard to find sweets similar to the States.  Everything is from scratch.  So this is perfect and quick!

I took mine out at 8 minutes and they weren't nearly done yet so I put them in for 3 more minutes until the outside was slightly crunchy and the inside soft. The texture is just off IMO.

This is so easy and so good. Here are some things.   1. It made two dozen cookies      2. If you are not a really big peanut butter fan don't make these.     3. Take them out of the oven a little early bc they will finish cooking while they set.

I love this, at least, the dough I do! I have my first batch in the oven and I'm currently chomping on the sugary peanut butter mix beside me... It's almost as addicting as chocolate chip cookie dough!

I changed the recipe to suite my preferences; I doubled the sugar, added a teaspoon of baking soda, three tablespoons of dark brown sugar, and kept the one egg / one cup of peanut butter. I'm so excited to eat the actual cookie!

They taste just fine, and this is coming from a pregnant lady, but unless you'd rather just eat the dough- put them in the oven for more like 20 mins. Also a tip, it's  easier  to do the fork thing if the dough and/or fork is cold

These turned out great! I am a horrible cook and hate complicated recipes. Wanted some cookies, so I googled easiest peanut butter cookies. Couldn't get easier than this, and they were so yummy. No one even believed I only had those 3 ingredients. Thanks for an awesome recipe I will use again and again! :)

It's a little thick. Maybe because I ate one when it was still warm. I added 1 tsp of baking soda and 1 tsp of baking powder and a little bit of vanilla extract. When it was done, it looked like a ball. So I took a fork and did the design.

I tried the recipe,  and it was very runny, really too runny to make cookies,  maybe the egg was too large or something.  

No loss. We added chocolate chips and ate it anyway...raw egg and all. Tasted fine.

These turn out fantastic, but you definitely need to flatten them first if you want cookie-shaped cookies.  My first batch were little peanut butter mounds!  Still extremely tasty though!

Delicious cookie! First batch plain. Second batch I added walnuts. Then some chocolate chips to the walnut batch! I had fun! They were good!

I added chocolate chips, because I wanted chocolate chip peanut butter cookies. They turned out alright. melted and spread a bit more than i think they should have, but no big deal. taste was good, they looked good, and the texture was fine as well.

Absolutely love these! I am a peanut Butter fanatic, These are the best PB Cookie i have had. When I 1st was introduced to this recipie it called for 1 cup of confectioners sugar, I find it really doesn't make a difference, either works well + 1tspn vanilla. This year for the holidays tried to make a day ahead set them up for a slice and bake(not a good idea). Brought to room temp remixed got out my trusty 1.5T OXO good grip scoop. I do not flatten to much with the criss-cross. Bake 375 for 18-20min. Call them my Peanut Butter Biscuit Cookies

This was the first recipe I ever learned as a little girl.  Just three simple ingredients and it's perfect.  Just make sure to press down on the cookie with a fork twice in a criss-cross pattern before cooking to flatten it a bit.

I halved the recipe, and it made 8 good-sized cookies. I enjoyed the simplicity of the prep (I'm not a huge baker), but found the finished product to be a bit too sweet for my taste. They were definitely moist, but I was still reaching for the milk just to wash the sweetness down. Really though, not bad for a 5 minute cookie and a solid sugar buzz!

I adore this recipe -- it's stuff I've always got on hand, quick and painless.

One thing to note, though: this doesn't really taste like a more traditional peanut butter cookie. They're pretty intensely sweet. They taste more like the peanut butter candy filling inside a Reese's cup or similar candy. I happen to love that flavor, so I adore them.

I sometimes mix in some chocolate chips, but since they cook at a fairly low temperature for a short time, the chips don't melt that much, so it's only so-so as an addition. But they're still my favorite go-to cookie recipe.

The first batch were great but the second was not as good. Easy to over cook. I didn't use all white sugar I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, also added 1tsp. Vanilla. They tasted great but watch out not to over cook. By the way my 7 year old grandson did everything to make these ..I just took care of the oven part and I didn't do that great on second batch.

I think this cookie tase great.  My only recommendation would be to cut the sugar down to perhaps 3/4 cup.  I haven't tried that yet but i did make them with the 1, 1, 1 recipe.  The cookie seems a little to sweet and not peanut buttery enough.  I also agree with BrandonsMom11197, this is the 3 ingredient recipe not the one with baking soda, vanilla, and salt.  That is a whole different recipe.

Fairly easy cookie to make:)Ty for sharing this recipe:) The first time I made these cookie I used 1cup of splenda which was a mistake cause they came out way too sweet!! The cookies formed nicely tho and easily crumbled as expecteded
So, I let them cool off before I took them off  the baking sheet.I baked them for 10mins but I would stick with the 6-8mins.The second time around  that I made them I used 1/2 white sugar, 4 tlbs of flour, and a tsp of vanilla.I rolled them in a ball this time and did the crisis cross pattern with the wet fork dipped in sugar.They tasted good but next time im just going to omit the flour and just stick with the 3 ingredients.I found with the flour they easily rolled into balls nicely but came out to doughy inside.I added a drop of jam in the centre of some of the cookies which made them taste even better than expected! I would definitely suggest adding some jam:D

I have made this recipe for years, my grandmother gave it to me when I was just a teenager.  We love them, so fast and just delish.  What I also like is there are just about 12 of them so you don't feel so bad about eating the whole batch in a couple days.

Matter of fact i just pulled them out of the oven. I love peanut butter so i just doubled the ingredients.  It made 20 decent sized cookies i even had about a cup of dough left oover. I cant wait to dig in to these cookies they smell so good. To make them a little sweet i even drizzled a little carmel on the tops.  Amazing!!!!!!

This was an OK recipe.  It is definitely easy to make when the kids want a quick snack.  Had to increase the cook time to 10 minutes. They were VERY soft coming out of the oven.

I used this recipe as is before and was good. Today I decided to try something different and replaced the peanut butter with a knock-off brand of Nutella. First failed cookie recipe for me ever. lol.

I've always made PB cookies with 1 egg, 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of PB. I used this recipe mostly to know the baking temperature and time. My cookies spread thin and were flat and hard. While edible, they were subpar. I'm not sure why these cookies came out so much differently than they used to and so different from the majority of the other reviews.

This recipe is so simple and so perfect! It is my go-to, last minute notice cookie. The odds are good I'll have all the ingredients at any given time.

I also love to make them and then immediately top them each with a Hershey's chocolate kiss. When I brought the Kiss-topped cookies to my in-laws, the reaction was amazing. They looked at me like I was a wizard.

A perfect, easy cookie!

My family loved it, as they are peanut butter lovers. For myself, it was a bit dense and grainy. But, I will make these again.

Love this recipe!  Honestly, I was afraid to taste it after taking them from the oven...was just too simple. I actually didn't realize I was low on peanut butter until after I added the sugar to the egg. I had about 3/4 cups of creamy peanut butter and had to used crunchy peanut butter to make a cup.  My only issue is that the peanut butter taste was a just little strong.  I will definitely make again and make a minor adjustment on the peanut butter. I used Peter Pan.

I absolutely love this recipe. Its so easy and simple I really like the fact that its not to hard to mix and the peanut butter isn't so sticky. My husband and son are cookie fends and they love when I make them for them.

So I didn't have an egg so I substituted 1/4th a cup of vegetable oil. Not sure if that's what killed this recipe for me but for some reason the cookies immediately flattened out once they hit the heat, causing a pitiful looking peanut butter flatland. I decided it wasn't that big of a deal, and I took them out after the sides started browning. Probably took 12-14 minutes I'd estimate. I let them cool for an hour, but they never hardened or became cookie-like. I just popped them in the freezer which will hopefully do the trick, but I'm not sure how this recipe is supposed to work apparently.

These cookies were super easy to make and saved me a trip to the grocery store because of the short list of ingredients.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar and they were good but still a little too sweet for my taste.  I probably would use 1/2 cup or less sugar the next time I make these.  I did flatten the mixture a bit for even baking. I made two batches and added vanilla and baking powder.  I know it's a 3 ingredient recipe but what the heck - I had them in my pantry!

Amazing cookies! It made 20 cookies and they were all delicious. The only thing I changed was adding about 1/2 a cup on peanut butter chips. They only thing I have to say is that they have to cook a lot longer than the recipe says.

Great gluten free recipe!  I chose it because I didn't need to buy any additional "gluten free" ingredients to make cookies for a friend that's gf.  She called immediatly to say how great they were and to ask for the recipe. They were a hit!

This is a great recipe... the only thing I changed is that you MUST have a glass of ice cold milk ready as soon as they cool. I told the fam I was going to whip up a batch of cookies and they would be eating them in 15 minutes, they didn't believe me. I made believers out of all of them and the cookies were gone 5 minutes after they cooled! Thanks for submitting this easy, quick, delicious cookie recipe.

My grandmother has used this recipe for years (since I was little) and I always enjoyed making them with her because they were so easy. The only thing different I do is add a little vanilla (about 1 tsp), and yes, you should flatten these out since they do not contain any agents to help them rise. I have never found a better recipe that has such a rich peanut butter taste!

This made nearly 2 dozen for me! I pressed a little with a sugar coated fork. I made some of them with milk chocolate chips in them (plus I sprinkled some extra sugar on top!), but I think they're better without.

Quick, easy, gluten free recipe!

I have made these cookies with candy kisses for the top. Who knew that with 3 ingredients these would so good. My family loves these. They are super fun to make with the grand kids. If you have not tried them then you must. I use all 3 sugars. 1/3 of regular 1/3 of brown sugar and 1/3 of confectioners sugar. This makes a soft cookie.

I've made these many times; I got the recipe in 7th grade Home Economics class. Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies on this site is the exact same recipe. I think both recipes should state that you need to flatten these cookies with a fork. These are heavy and very peanut buttery. You can't keep them around too long, as they get hard. They are great for kids to make because they are so easy. I make a batch when we want a quick snack, and we eat them warm.

This is a quick recipe and great if you're craving peanut butter cookies. Don't make the same mistake I did and butter the pan! Follow the directions of the recipe and you'll have a peanut butter treat in no time.

This has been my go to "Oh God... I need something gluten free as a treat!!" recipe for years now.  I tend to add a dash of vanilla or some cinnamon to vary things up, but it is perfect as is.  Beware of "odd" peanut butter that might have strange oils or emulsifiers though.  The only time this recipe has failed is when I used a cheap store brand peanut butter that wasn't very good to start with.  I don't criss-cross mine either.  I scoop out in tablespoon portions then flatten with the bottom of a glass... thinner... lighter... YUM!

Having read the reviews, I was very excited to try these! However, I found them to be very grainy as a result of the sugar. Perhaps I did something wrong? Overall, I was not impressed,

Just wanted to put in my two cents on this recipe. I personally have made this one often when I'm craving something sweet and want it quick! I've also found this one to be a great starter recipe as I can throw in just about anything and have it turn out awesome still which I suppose changes it a lot but just saying...its not finicky. You can use honey instead of sugar..prob less though. i have yet to find the exact measurement..but last time I made this I threw in cocao, coconut oil, some honey, flax meal, vanilla, and dates and a splash of coconut milk to perfect the consistency. blended in food processor...it came out AMAZING! Like really rich, moist brownie cookies...I'm currently in the process of making the exact same thing because it turned out so great, just this time actually doing bars instead of cookies :)

Thought this would be a good simple recipe for my 2 year old and I to do together. It was! Very simple, cookies were easy to roll into balls and smash with the fork. That being said, these are the sweetest cookies I have ever made, they are straight sugar. Good, just be prepared for the richness with a glass of milk or the like and you won't be able to eat more than one or two small ones!

Good cookie. Simple and easy. I add some butterscotch chips I had left over from a previous recipe, not alot, made them just a little to sweet for me but my teenagers loved them. I did press them with a fork like traditional pb cookies and baked them for about 9-10 min, cooled for 5, and then moved to a plate. Made about 30 (small cookies).

Well. I love peanut butter. I love sugar. I love this simplicity since I was pressed for time and ingredients. It made exactly 12 cookies for me. I had three small pans, so I was able to rest cook times.  I didn't even attempt six minutes. I went for ten. Cookies were soft and slightly fell apart. Second round I went for 12 minutes. This went well, so I stuck with it. All in all, I friggin love these things.

I'm nine months pregnant and been putting off grocery shopping due to the summer heat. This came back to bite me when I was craving sweets and my kitchen was void of baking staples. I remembered my mom making these as a kid so I looked up the recipe. Not being one too make things TOO easy I added a bit of vanilla and cinnamon,  and a pinch of salt and baking soda per a previous review.  OMG yum! Craving satisfied!

It took mine a little longer than 8 mins to bake because my oven doesn't heat evenly. I thought they would be small cookies but they are actually pretty big. I took someone else's advice from a comment and used 1/2 a cup of sugar and PB, and an egg white instead of the whole egg. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but i couldn't roll mine into a ball lol So i used the drop technique. I dont have fancy parchment paper so i used Reynolds wrap non stick foil, and it worked just fine. I let them chill out for a few minutes to cool, and they flattened a little, but once i got my hand on a cookie, oh my goodness they are so good. They are a little crispy on the outside and soft in the center. These are my new Go-to cookies whenever my husband wants something sweet. For cookies, they really aren't terrible in calories, which is good, because my husband is in the army. I'm so glad i found this recipe!

These are very interesting.  They melted a lot before setting, which made them flatter than a traditional peanut butter cookie.  A bit too sweet for my taste; if I made them again I'd reduce the sugar.  These formed a shiny crust on the outside, like the kind that forms on brownies.  That was my favorite part-the crispy outside and soft middle.  I might make them again.

I LOVE this recipe. I make these with my daughter and we roll them into balls with our (freshly washed!) hands. She loves it because she's able to have her own cookie sheet, I love it because she's able to do more than just pour the ingredients into the bowl. They're super peanutbuttery, which my family loves.
I've seen that multiple people have suggested adding vanilla and baking powder, I may try that next time I make these (probably in a few hours).
I will admit that if you try to eat these immediately they crumble to little pieces, I let them sit for 10-15 minutes before I eat them.

These cookies are dry and crumble. Great when warm and fresh out of the oven, but after they are crisp and hard. I like a soft, gooey cookie so I will not be baking these again.

Wonderful!  I made a few changes according to the reviews. I used half sugar and half Spenda blend brown sugar. Doubled the recipe and used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda. I also added 1/2 tsp salt and they spread a little and tasted great. I also baked them for 10 min

Here's the deal - if you like your cookies tender and soft, like we do, you will love these.  If you prefer a hard crunchy cookie, you won't like these because you have to bake them far too long to get them crunchy, and they will fall apart.

This recipe is wonderful! If I have a party, I will double or triple this recipe, it's so easy to make! I always make these with my friends in my free time for my dad and my brother. I added a tiny bit of vanilla extract and a tiny bit of baking powder. I didn't make much difference but oh well. My mom usually hates sweets, but I made these and she LOVED them!

So stinkin' easy, my little guy loved making them and he could help with all steps but of course putting them in the oven. We did make a criss-cross pattern on them, it just seemed right and my son threw in the last quarter of a bag of chocolate chips. Besides that followed exactly. The 1 dozen really made 2 for me. They come out fragile. Let them cool for about 2 minutes and they are ready to eat.

This recipe is a favorite of mine - I make it for a friend with a gluten allergy and she likes them too! I've made them as above and with 1 tsp. baking soda and a splash of vanilla. I like the additions so I call them my five ingredient peanut butter cookies. The dough is good and these are also good with chocolate chips or M&Ms.

This cookie is the best! Seriously. I've made peanut butter cookie recipes before that were more complicated than this and they didn't even compare. This cookie is soft with a great peanut butter flavor. Simple but awesome!

I have this recipe posted in here too! But with mine I state that you should refrigerate for an hour and flatten with a fork.
These are the best cookies ever and, not being much of a dessert maker, I can make them every day of the week and my whole family loves them!

These cookies were a huge hit at my house. I did take the advise of some of the other reviewers by adding in a bit of baking powder and a small pinch of salt and also rolling the dough in sugar and slightly flattening them with a fork in a crisscross pattern. They took about 12 minutes to cook. Overall, it was a very fast, tasty, and easy treat. I will definitely make these again.

These cookies are delicious. When trying to find a cookie recipe to make with an under-stocked pantry, I came across this. As others did, I added a splash of vanilla and about a teaspoon of baking soda. I also added a pinch of salt. I personally prefer crunchy cookies over soft ones, and these got perfectly crispy with a couple more minutes in the oven. I also occasionally add some chocolate chips for something a little special. Everyone who has had these cookies just loved them! Definitely 5 stars!!

As someone with wheat intolerance, I've been looking for something to sooth my cookie craving. I was lazy when I made these and didn't feel like making cookies so I just smooshed the 'dough' into a brownie pan. I made it with chunky peanut butter and added about a cup of chocolate chips. It is awesome! The texture is a little more grainy than regular cookie, but I actually really like it. I would definitely make it again and want to experiment with add-ins next time.

Normally I don't like PB cookies, but I really like these! I throw in some vanilla and sprinkle with some sort of coarse salt, like Kosher salt. I know it sounds crazy, but it offsets the sweet and makes for a nice little twist.

Amazing! I used this recipe for a spur of the moment dessert for my husband and dad. I dropped little balls of it into a tiny muffin pan and popped tiny reese cups in the middle, i also shaved dark chocolate over the cookies without reeses. Delliicciouus! (i followed the pack and added a taste of vanilla & baking powder)

These cookies are utterly divine, the only changes that I made was I changed the white sugar over to brown sugar. Since that was all I had at the time. I personally really like it better and my hubby doesn't seem to disagree. He loves his peanut butter and goes through this cookies like its his last snack ever. Thanks for the recipe. I will continue to use the brown sugar for it, but very good over all.

Very good! Despite what others may say, it tastes like a real peanut butter cookie. Everyone in the house liked them. The texture and taste are good. When they first come out of the oven they crumble easily. I just let them cool down and have no problem when they are cool. The time varies when I cook them but perhaps it is because the size of the cookie I make varies. Great dessert for Celiac Disease and others who cannot have gluten.

OMG! These cookies were messed up. They were flat, greasy and chewy. Here's what I did (tried to incorporate some of the suggestions):  1-Doubled the recipe using 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs and 2 cups PB, and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Since I didn't go by the recipe I shouldn't be rating but I wanted to send in my input. 2- Baked at 8 mins then changed to 6 mins. 3- BTW is was 20% reduced fat PB. So sad it was a big failure. I'm afraid to try it by going back to the original recipe. I should, but I better not.

These were easy as pie and VERY good. I used regular peanut butter and the consistency was great(I read the reviews that said the cookies were crumbly and figured that they probably used reduced fat).  My family devoured them.  We were able to make two dozen.  The first dozen we took out at eight minutes and they were just barely underdone, but we like them that way so no big deal.  The second dozen we left in a good bit longer and I think we preferred them that way.

These were simple and yummy. I made with soy butter, my son is allergic to peanuts, and they turned out great!!! He loves to help me bake and this recipe was perfect.

Sooo tasty and easy to make!!  One thing I decided to add: chocolate chips.  After about 6 minutes, I pulled the cookies out of the oven and placed three small chocolate chips on each cookie.  Amazing!! :))

These were so fun to make with my boys! I doubled the recipe, and added some vanilla. Also, I changed the sugar to include brown sugar: 1/4 white, 1/2 brown. Be sure to leave them on the cookie sheet for a bit to cool, I tried to transfer them too quickly and it fell to pieces! (Still very tasty though...gave me an excuse to eat them really warm!) I rolled mine in white sugar and crisscrossed them with a fork. The boys loved to help me in the kitchen (they are 3 and 2).

I used the recipe as is, but used a small scoop and scooped the dough into a mini muffin tin.  I then squished chocolate kisses into the center before baking.  I didn't realize you weren't supposed to add the kisses until after the cookies had a baked awhile, but they were still YUMMY.  A little on the gooey side, but what can you say about gooey peanut butter and gooey chocolate?

I followed this recipe exactly as it appears. After 6 minutes I still had a gloppy mess. They are flat when they cool and do not look anything like the picture.

We make these all the time! I got the original recipe years ago from the back of the PB jar and am glad to see it here! It's so easy for kids to make as a first baking project as well. Every once in a while we switch it up by using crunchy peanut butter which make them super good! You can also add choco chips or toffee bits to them and even chopped almonds which make them so good. Perfect cookies every time for us peanut butter lovers! For those who don't like a peanut buttery cookie, then this is not the recipe for you.

These are ridiculously easy and so good!  I roll the balls of dough in sugar before I bake them just to give them a little extra.  A little vanilla extract is good too, but you can make these exactly as the recipe says and they come out good.  Thank you for such a great recipe!  I'm sure I will be using this recipe for years to come.

My kids wanted dessert tonight, but I was on my way out to a class.  I pulled up this recipe, and had my 11 yo DD make them.  We used all natural peanut butter, so I had to add a little milk.  We also threw in chocolate chips.  She used the big scoop, so she baked them for 17 minutes.  I think that was a little long, but they were crispy and chewy at the same time.  Thanks!

I made these cookies, and though they turned out very delicious, they were a bit too peanut buttery. I might use a little less peanut butter next time.

i woke up this morning at 5am craving peanut butter cookies (the joys of being pregnant...) & needed something fast, simple but still tasty & this was it! i did add a splash of vanilla, as well as about 1/3 cup of crushed pecans & substituted the white sugar with 3/4 cup splenda and 1/4 brown sugar. i also ended up sprinkling vanilla sugar over the cookies after they came out of the oven & i put crushed chocolate bar pieces in the center of half the cookies for my husband. they turned out wonderful, thank you.

I loved these cookies as a child. The poorest family at our church always had these available when I came over. The mom even taught me how to make them. I never thought to write down the recipe, how hard could it be to remember three things. I lost touch with the family after college and have lately remembered these cookies. I am glad someone has but them here for me to discover again. Thank you!

My husband put a kink in my cooking style when he started the South Beach diet.  But I discovered that these cookies still work if you substitute 16 tablespoons of Splenda for the cup of sugar.  Watch them though cause they cook fast!

Not bad for only 3 ingredients!  Maybe I was expecting too much peanut butter flavor after reading the reviews, but I didn't think they were very peanut butter-y.  Tasty for the time it took to make them though!

I was craving something sweet and didn't have many ingredients on hand.  This recipe was perfect for something quick.  I made it just how the recipe is stated.  I had to cook it in two separate batches.  The first one I cooked about 10 minutes and they came out mushy in the center and tasted like pure peanut butter and sugar (which isn't such a bad thing).  The second patch, I flattened with a fork and sprinkled sugar on them.  I cooked them for about 12 minutes.  They are much crunchier which is how I like it.  They aren't the best I've ever had, but with so little ingredients, they are perfect for a cookie craving emergency!

These are simple and fantastic. I roll small balls in sugar and set on pan, cook for 8 min.  Keep on pan for a few minutes before removing to rack, or they break. I always use Smuckers Natural PB, in crunchy or creamy (just make sure oil is incorporated into peanut butter before removing it from jar).

I made these cookies almost exactly as the recipe states..except I got a little anxious about the reviews that were saying the peanut butter flavor was overwhelming.  So after I used a fork to press the cookies, I sprinkles them lightly with sugar before putting them in the oven.  I baked for 10 minutes (at 8 minutes they hadn't spread at all) and took them out.  These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had!  Yummy!

AMAZING. Rich PB flavor and extremely easy to make! As recommended, I added a dash of vanilla extract and baking soda. DELICIOUS AND ADDICTIVE, will definitely make again! If you make jumbo cookies, bake for an extra few minutes.

They are ok. I let them just  barely brown around the edges - while still warm the centers were almost liquid which was a bit off-putting, but once they cooled completely they were chewy in the middle. Much better.  I sprinkled sugar on the tops while they were still warm because I thought they needed it. Will make again just because they took about 15 minutes start to finish and the flavors were enjoyable. Just not the best.

Yummy! I used splenda and suger free Peanut Butter. I also used 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and a slash of vanilla. For sugar free they were good I imagine with the real stuff they are incredible!

My boyfriend and I made these cookies today, they were excellent better than the other recipes we have tried and we used to work in a bakery. We made eight and in 20 minutes they were all gone. He joked they must be great because I am an ultra picky eater. We will most definitely make them again and huge bonus, they are cheap to make. Try them, you will not be let down.

I didn't get this recipe from allrecipes but found this same one in a recent Parents magazine. I, like another reviewer, wanted to make my hubby a quick dessert and surprise him. It made about 12 and he LOVED them! He ate six that night.

These are a really quick and easy peanut butter treat.  They are pretty heavy on PB flavor like others have said and do go great with a glass of milk.  I have made these by this recipe and also used Spenda in place of the sugar.  This time I thought I would make them a little extra special by adding a chocolate star to each.  I did not flatten them and baked them about 6 minutes, I took them out and pushed a chocolate star into the top of each and put them back in the oven for 2 minutes.  I had the chocolate from Christmas baking to use up and it made a really good and fast version of the popular chocolate star cookie.  The chocolate also helped to break up the sort of heavy PB flavor these cookies have.  Really yummy!

Easy basic recipe for kids, great as a base recipe to alter and make it your own.  I replace 1/2 of sugar with brown sugar.  These cookies stay moist for days, if they last that long!

Yummy! I flatten with fork and sprinkle with sugar, cook them at 375 degrees about 11 minutes. Let them cool completely before placing on plate.

They were good, I wouldn't say awesome but good! They did fall a part a bit but nothing too major. On the plus side, I have a 2 year boy who LOVES to help cook and this is a good one for him because of the amount of ingredients! I will be making these cookies AGAIN!!! Thank you :-)

I tried this recipe but had no granular sugar so I substituted powdered.  I'm not overly pleased with it.  While they taste OK and even the texture is OK, they're just not like the PB cookies I really love.  I'll give it a good rating on quick and easy though!  Maybe my lack of granular sugar is why they didn't turn out as well as the other reviews!

Amazing! I definitely didn't think I could make PB cookies with hardly anything at all. I now have an excuse to use up the four jars of pb taking up space in my cupboard and both the hubby and kids love them!

These cookies were good. The first half of the batch I cooked came out really gooey so the second half of the batch I cooked for 8-10 mins and they came out better. Very easy to make and great for one of those days where you want the taste of a peanut butter cookie fast! This will do it for you!

Not only simple, but recipe converts well to a low sugar treat. I started out just making half the recipe (splenda too expensive to waste)  I sub'd Splenda for sugar, plus 1/4 tsp.salt and baking soda,1 egg white as others suggested.  Well,it certainly did not go to waste..I'm waiting on my 2nd batch as I type-FULL recipe this time. Delicious

I seen the recipe said it made only six so i doubled the recipe but i ended up with 4 dozen. I wonder how big she made each cookie. My cookies measured about 2 inches across, so i did not make mine small. But the flavor and the ease of making these are great if your are in a hurry.

I make these a lot for my husband as a quick sugar treat. He's a big fan of peanut butter. I usually add a little vanilla and sometimes, I'll either dip
half in melted chocolate or use them
to make ice cream sandwiches after they cool. They hold up pretty well.

AMAZING that anything this simple and easy can be this good.  Anyone who didn't like this had to have gone wrong somewhere - "operator error".  I would make them even MORE peanut buttery next time!  THANK YOU!  Came in handy when money was tight and I wanted something sweet with ingredients on hand!

I just had a craving for peanut butter cookies and these seems super easy...and they were. All I had to have were 3 ingredients! They tasted wonderful...my husband doesn't even normally like cookies and he like these a lot! I reccommend cooking them at least 12-15 minutes though or else they will be too mushy! I will definently be making these again!

These are thick dense peanut butter cookies that are delish!  Huge points in my family that has allergies to wheat and milk too!  I rolled dough into balls, used fork to compress, baked for 8 min. in convection oven.  So excited to have these in my recipe box!

I loved this recipe!  I changed it a little bit. 

Instead of 1 cup of reg. sugar, I did 1/2 cup granulated, and 1/2 cup brown.  I also added a teaspoon of Vanilla and used chuncky peanut butter.  They were AWESOME! The recipe does make exactly 12 cookies.

Pretty good! I added a little flour and vanilla and used 1/2 crunchy and 1/2 natural creamy (just nuts, no added ingredients) and they turned out well! Just after they came out of the oven the kids popped chocolate chips into them like smiley faces for fun.

So good!  I use brown sugar, but I've tried them with white sugar and they're almost as good.  I take them out of the oven before they're cooked all the way.  If you're not worried about salmonella from the eggs, you've baked them too long!!  Once I cooked them until they were somewhat brown on the bottom, and they were not good!

WARNING!!  This recipe is super peanut-buttery.  This recipe is for those of us who love to eat pb right out of the jar.  Super simple and super good.  I added some vanilla, salt and baking soda, but I bet these would be great even without them.  Again, this recipe is not for the faint of heart.  I am only going to make it when I need a peanut butter fix.

Excellent recipe, was able to be made in less than 12 minutes. Excellent taste, and texture, with regular and chunky peanut butter.

I ended up having to cook each batch for about 15 minutes instead of 8, but they were delicious!! My husband and I both love peanut butter and these were so easy to make!! Have your milk ready though....they are full of peanut butter flavor!! Excellent recipe!!!

I made a small batch of eight of these cookies and they didn't last even an hour on the cookie plate!! Everyone loved them and they were so simple to make. I made them low cal by using Splenda and egg beaters. Great recipe!
