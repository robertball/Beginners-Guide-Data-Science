I made these by method as written by cooking the bacon first.  I used parmigiano reggiano due to not having cheddar available to me.  Once out of the oven I served them on a "nest" of mashed potatoes patties.  Mine didn't come out as pretty as the photo but were delicious.  Thank you SammyLamb for the nice idea.

This is a nice recipe but it needs some tweaks. I did not add any salt or pepper to the egg, it gets enough salt from the bacon and cheese! Added a little pepper and a dash of milk. Keep an eye on the oven, I think the cooking time is too long personally. Other than that it's pretty  tasty.
