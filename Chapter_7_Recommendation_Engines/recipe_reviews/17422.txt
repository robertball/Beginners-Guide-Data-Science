Great cake!. I have had many repeat requests every time I take it somewhere. 
I handle the glaze differently than the recipe with much better results.
After I remove the cake and let it cool 20 minutes, I poke holes in the cake, make the glaze, then pour the glaze into the bundt pan and replace the cake in the pan. I let it sit another 20 minutes and then turn it out onto a cake round. All the glaze is absorbed and it gives a pretty finish to the crust. Then I sprinkle a few more finely chopped pecans over the top for presentation.

I have made this cake a few times now and have perfected it...  First, try and use an angel food cake pan... I use a yellow cake mix with chocolate pudding mix- it gives the cake a color that doesnt look "cake box".. Use one cup of irish cream and make sure that mix for the entire 5 minutes..  For the glaze, add 1/2 shot of whisky (its not strong)- just adds a little extra kick.  
If you use the angel food pan, the top of the cake is easier to dress with the glaze.  Use a chop stick to make 20-30 holes all around the top and pour glaze over- glaze will fall in nice drips along the side.
You will  NOT be dissapointed with this cake!

This is a very pretty, moist cake. The pecans definitely dress it up. It is delicately flavored, with just enough Bailey's to make you wonder what that unusual flavor is. Not overly sweet, great to serve as a coffeecake.

I have made this cake twice now.  Once for a dinner at work, and the other for an anniversary dinner for my parents.  Both times it was a success, with lots of rave reviews.  I have since passed this recipe on to several other women (and a few guys).  I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and put the cake back into the pan to "soak" for about 20 minutes (I put approx 2/3 of the glaze in the cake pan...returned the cake...spooned the rest over the cake "bottom" and let it sit for about 20 minutes before removing it from the pan again.  Gives the cake a good chance to soak in the glaze and you get a wonderful sugary crust on the top.

I made this cake last week based on reviews and took it to my hair salon.  Understand that I don't like Irish Cream (such as the Bailey's that I used), but I thought it sounded interesting.  About 30 minutes into getting my hair returned to its "natural" color, all of the hair stylists, the salon owner and 4 customers had tried the cake.  You would have thought that I had baked the BEST cake ever in the history of the universe.  Everyone raved and raved and raved.  I have a home dessert business and I received 3 orders that day for this cake for Thanksgiving.  Weird, because I still don't know how it tastes!!  Everyone loved the glaze and the suggestion from another reviewer about putting the glaze in the pan and replacing the cake really gave the cake a nice chewy/cruncy crust. Thanks Sue!!

I made this cake last night for my coworker's birthday.  The only change I made is that I used toasted macadamia nuts instead of the pecans. Otherwise I followed this recipe very closely.  It turned out beautifully. As for the glaze, you have to gradually put it on or it will end up at the bottom on the dish. I poked plenty of holes in the cake with a skewer, spooned a little glaze around the top, then took my pastry brush and liberally brushed the inside hole and all around the outside of the cake.  I waited a few minutes then repeated that process, then waited a few minutes and repeated again etc. until the glaze was gone.  The glaze hardened into a nice, shiny somewhat crunchy, moist and tasty topping. The macadamia nuts were wonderful and really added nice texture. By the next morning when the cake had cooled it was very attractive and it was easy to box up and transport (with no frosting to worry about messing up). I think next time I would try a cheaper irish cream because Baileys is soooo very expensive. For sipping I think the quality of Baileys is essential but for baking I would think that a cheaper brand would suffice. Another thing that's wonderful about this cake - it is very quick and easy to put together. Cake mixes are wonderful in a pinch but everyone at work thinks this cake was made from scratch!

2/2006 - This is the best cake EVER!!  I made this for New Year's and it was such a hit I had to make it again for my party today.  I'm so glad that I did.  The recipe is perfect just the way it is.  Make sure to use all the glaze.  It's not too much!
12/25/06 - I don't like it when people write a bad review and then change all of the ingredients.  I really like this recipe as is BUT.... I wanted to make this today as a gift for a friend.  I didn't have yellow cake mix, I only had sugar-free pudding mix, and I didn't have enough Bailey's.  So I used chocolate cake mix, the sugar-free pudding mix, and Kahlua!!  It was fantastic!!!!  Remember, you really do need to use all of the glaze.  Too many members here complained that they did not taste the alcohol.  The flavor is in the glaze!!!

I've made this numerous times now (see initial review below) and have some tips. First, use 1 cup of Irish cream liquor instead of 3/4 Irish cream and 1/4 water; and use cake mix WITHOUT pudding already in it. After cake is done, cool for 10 minutes in pan, invert, pour 3/4 of the sauce into the cake pan, put cake back into pan, tilt pan around to distribute sauce. Poke holes into the bottom of the cake and pour remaining sauce onto the bottom slowly, letting the holes absorb some of the sauce, sprinkle with nuts. After 10 minutes, take the cake back out and spoon any sauce still in the bottom of the pan over the cake. VARIATION: chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding, and caramel Bailey's (yum!).

OLDER REVIEW: Followed the recipe exactly as written except did the thing with soaking the cake upside down in the pan. While the cake was nice and moist, it pretty much tasted like a yellow cake. I didn't catch any hint of Irish cream except through the glaze. The texture of the cake was a little more akin to pound cake, in my opinion. Very dense and moist. Not bad, just not super great. I think next time I will use 1 cup Irish cream instead of water and Irish cream. Maybe try it with caramel Bailey's for a little more kick in the taste department. It's a recipe I will make again, but definitely needs modifications, otherwise to me, it's just a waste of good Bailey's if it's just going to taste like yellow cake.

ROCK-MY-SOCKS GOOD!!!!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and the reviews for the glaze- I poured about 2/3 of the glaze into the pan, put the cake back in- poked holes in the 'bottom' of the cake and poured the rest of the glaze over it.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We took this to friends for dinner and it was a HIT!  YUM!  Thanks for this easy and delicious cake!!!

Great cake! I ran out of Irish cream for the glaze, so I substituted Kahlua instead. Worked just fine! I think next time I will leave off the nuts - seemed to take away from the Irish cream flavor a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

A good cake, but not outstanding.  Needed only half the glaze.  I made it for a ladies' luncheon and was disappointed that no one requested the recipe.  Consensus was it was good, but not great.

I make this on a whim after receiving multiple bottles of Irish Cream as hostess gifts over the holidays.  (A happy problem.)  I made no substitutions or alterations to the ingredients.  Beat for the full five minutes; it will make a difference.  Do not skip the glaze and be forewarned that it will seem like too much.  I made the glaze right after the cake came out of the oven.  Used a skewer to poke holes while the cake was still in the pan then poured on about half the glaze and guided it around with a pastry brush.  After another 10 minutes or so I inverted the cake onto a cooling rack over a cookie sheet and removed the pan.  I poured some of the remaining glaze slowly over the cake, again sort of guiding it with the pastry brush.  The directions say to keep at it until all of the glaze is absorbed and this method worked well for me.  With the pastry brush you can also recover glaze that has run off into the cookie sheet below and put it back on the cake where it belongs.  The cake will absorb all of the glaze if you keep at it and I can't imagine using less, given that the result was so good.  Excellent for such an easy recipe with a boxed mix.

I would give this 100 stars if I could...absolutely delicious! Mine baked up perfect at 55 mins with vanilla cake/vanilla pudding and Carolans irish cream. The glaze is to die for!!! *UPDATE* I have made this cake 4 times now and have noticed a difference between cake mix brands. I have used Duncan Hines mix WITH pudding added in the mix several times and the cake comes out SO MUCH BETTER and MOISTER than it does when I use a cheaper brand like Pillsbury or Betty Crocker. It's a few cents more expensive but so worth it!

Let's see... the word "heavenly" comes to mind. I've made this 3 times now and I never got to taste the first 2, so I couldn't comment until now. This is an amazing cake. Decadent, but delicious!
I pour about 2/3 of the glaze into the bottom of the pan & then put the cake back in it to absorb all the gooey goodness! Make sure to poke lots of holes in your cake first though! (Use something bigger than a fork for best results. Maybe a chopstick or a skewer.) Then just pour the last 1/3 of the glaze over the bottom of the cake. Then sit back and let it rest... I think the reviewers who had problems with this did not let it sit long enough. BE PATIENT!!! I give it an hour or so before inverting in onto the serving platter. If you like Bailey's Irish Cream, there is NO WAY that you won't LOVE this dessert!

I had to make a last-minute substitution of Irish Cream-flavored coffee creamer instead of the liqueur (in the same amounts) and it turned out absolutely delicious!  Do you know what that means?  Think about the variety of flavors in the dairy coffee creamer section...Amaretto, Hazelnut, French Vanilla, Butter Pecan...plus the seasonal flavors.  I can't wait to try them all!  I also loved the idea of removing the cake from the pan, putting 2/3 of the glaze in the bottom of the pan, and then putting the cake back in the pan to soak in the glaze (with the rest of the glaze spooned around the edges and on the bottom).

This was simple to make and is disappearing fast at our house tonight!

Rave reviews every time I make this cake.  Aldi has an irish cream liquor 1/3 of the price of Bailey's.  I use a nonstick bundt pan and only use PAM no flour.  Also, instead of 1/4 cup water and 3/4 cup Irish cream, I use 1 cup Irish cream.  I use a skewer to poke the holes and found that a turkey baster works faster to drizzle the glaze.

This is a really great cake, very moist and flavorful!  The recipe just as as shown is perfect!  I have tried it with extra irish cream in the cake based on other reviews, and it is comes out well but I did find that it will bake up higher than the bundt pan when I do that.  I also tried extra irish cream in the glaze, but probably would not do that again as I had a hard time getting the glaze to thicken enough when I did that.  I also tried it with chocolate cake mix and pudding and while it was good, I recommend it with yellow cake and vanilla pudding because the chocolate masks the irish cream flavor a bit, whereas the yellow/vanilla really complements it.  Enjoy!

Yummy and easy.  What more could you ask for?  The cake was done in 50 minutes in my convection oven.  NOte:  the recipe yields a LOT of glaze.  I put strips of wax paper around my cake to catch it - so I get a neater presentation.   Extra glaze would be divine over ice cream with some chopped pecans on top.

I made some changes to the recipe to accomodate the chocolate lovers at work!  I substituted a devil's food cake mix, choclate pudding, & kaluaha.  The cake was a hit!  I've had several requests for different versions... I think I might try a white cake with margarita mix & tequila next!  This recipe is so easy & very versitile.  My only suggestion is to cut the amount of alcohol in the glaze if you're taking it to work or church!

Fantastic cake.  I've been making it for years.  I took others advice this time.  Removed the cake from the bundt pan, poured half of the glaze into pan and then put the cake back into the pan for 10 minutes. I then inverted the cake onto a cake pan, and painted the rest of the glaze on with a pastry brush.  Worked like a charm!  Bunco friends loved it!

I served this on Mother's Day to rave reviews.  It was very simple to make.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and placed the glaze in the bundt pan after the cake had cooled on the rack.  I placed the cake back in the pan for a bit too long and it stuck! I just placed the pan back in the oven at 175 for 10 minutes and the glaze loosened up and the cake came out.

YUMMY! Absolutely delicious! After his second bite my husband was already declaring this, the best dessert I've ever made. (he doesn't need to know a box mix was involved!)
Very simple - I followed the directions exactly except used chocolate pudding. Also, I only needed about 1/2 the glaze.  And thank you to the reviewers who suggested letting the cake sit back in the pan to absorb. - that was the PERFECT way to get it to soak in!
I will make this next time we have company for sure!

This was really good, I served it for a catering function.  I have made it several times and when I made the recipe I used 1 box yellow cake mix and 1 box chocolate pudding.  I didn't like the bright yellow color when I first made it.  It looked like any other bundt cake.  The chocolate pudding gave it a homemade look.  I used more glaze then it suggested to really get it to soak in.  I took it out of the pan while still a little warm and then wrapped them in plastic wrap right away.  After cooled at room temp I put it on a cookie sheet and soaked it in the glaze and let it sit, loosely wrapped.  This let the glaze soak in from the bottom to.   I then made a irish cream sauce which i poured over it.  Delicious!  It came out really moist when I did it this way.  THe traditional way the recipe states made a great cofee/snack cake.

Delicious! Very moist. I did not have pecans so I used butter toffee peanuts, crushed. I used a hint from another baker to increase Irish Cream to one cup. I personally thought this made cake too strong. Stick with 3/4 cup or IC. Also, after I poked holes in cake I poured glaze in bottom of bundt pan and replaced cake back in pan to soak up glaze. I borrowed that from another baker. Great idea!

Wow.  I also soaked the cake in the pan with 1/2 the sauce for about 20 minutes, like others suggested.  Served it with Bailey's drizzled on the plates and a scoop of ice cream, also drizzled with Bailey's.  YUM

My oh my, was this good! I realize there are over 660 reviews for this cake, but I just had to put my two cents in. Made the cake for our weekly family dinner and most of my family had two pieces! We finished up the rest last night and sat there scraping our plates for every last irish-creamy-morsel. I used a full cup of irish cream for the cake, omitted the pecans and threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips, just for the heck of it. I love the suggestions of many for glazing the cake, but knowing me, the neat trick would end in disaster. So I patiently and lovingly glazed the cake with a pastry brush - took about twenty minutes and gave me time to clean up my mess in the kitchen. (Definitely not a dessert to make when you're in a hurry.) This was soooo good. Thank you!

I've made this twice and it was a big hit.  I used a previous poster's suggestion of pouring the glaze back into the pan and then putting the cake back in to soak up the glaze rather than drizzling it on top. But I only did it with about 3/4 of the glaze.  The rest I let cool for a bit so it drizzled nicely and didn't just run off onto the cake plate.

I got to have this on mother's day which was soo sweet!  It was so so good I had to try and make it myself, I'm more of a cook than a baker so I had to up for the challenge.  Sure enough it turned out just as good! Followed the recipe exactly, feel so special to have such sweet people in my life to make this for me! Now I have to share the love :)

A dessert to die for! I used way more irish cream than the recipe called for and I left out the pecans because I don't care for them. I poked small holes in the cake while it was still in the pan and poured on half the glaze. Then I turned it out,poked a few more holes in the top and poured on the rest. I will definitely make this one again.

good cake but I followed some peoples suggestions and poured the glaze into the bundt pan and let it sit about 15 min.  The cake absorbed all the glaze and when I flipped it over, none ran down the sides so the top was very moist but the sides and bottom were plain cake.  next time I will reserve some to drizzle over or as my hubby suggested make a double batch and go to town!! added - I forgot to mention, I used chocolate cake and choc pudding and Kahlua.  Also will add more nuts next time...  I used walnuts YUM

Oh my goodness ~ just so delicious.  Even the aroma coming from the oven was heavenly!  I did change a couple of ingredients.  I used apple sauce in place of the oil and used Baileys coffee cream (the one you buy from the grocery store refrigerator) in place of the baileys irish cream.  The cake was so moist and had such a decadent taste.  I will certainly be baking this cake again!

I only used half of the glaze, but the cake was still too sweet for my taste. I wish the recipe called for regular flour instead of boxed cake mix so I could have reduced the sugar.  Overall, it cost too much for a regular bundt cake, but thanks for sharing the recipe!

This cake is awesome! I make it every year for the holidays (Christmas and Easter for sure). It's perfect as written. Be sure to beat it for the full five minutes, it makes a difference!
I've tried a chocolate version of this, using choc. cake mix, choc. pudding, and Kahlua and it was outstanding!

OMG!  So easy, SO YUMMY!  I didn't put the nuts in the bottom of the pan, instead opting to sprinkle on after I applied the glaze.  I thought it would be a nicer presentation.  I will def. make this again!  Thanks!

This is the same recipe I've been making for years only using almonds and amaretto in place of pecans and the irish cream. This sounds delicious also and I'll definitely give it a try.

This cake is awsome!  I made 2 in two days and I will give my opinion as to how it worked best...  Several people said to use brown sugar in the glaze and pour it in the pan and then put cake back in.  I DID NOT like it this way, the bottom inch of cake didn't soak up any glaze and the exterior was kind of soggy and the bottom dry. The second one I followed the recipe to the letter and put the cake on a rack and kept drizzling the glaze over and over again until most was used.  It was GREAT this way - the glaze got crunchy and the cake soaked up the liquid and was sooooo moist.  Love this cake!

Easy recipe.  Cake was real moist.  The only thing I did different was I made only half the glaze...glazed the "bottom" of the cake before turning it over onto a plate, then also glazed the "top".  Half the glaze was the perfect amount.  Will make this again.

Made this for a get together with friends and everyone liked it. Nothing too special about it and I thought that the Irish Cream taste got lost in the cake. I did leave out the nuts just due to preference. The glaze was good, but seemed too thick. I think next time I will make the glaze with just Irish Cream and powdered sugar.

Delicious!  Followed recipe exactly and everyone loved it.  One thing I didn't see mentioned in the reviews was that it took nearly 70 minutes to bake (just had my oven calibrated so I know that's not the problem).  The other thing I noticed is that the nuts make a pretty crunchy top and I couldn't really poke holes in the top without making a mess, so I just used a toothpick on the sides, etc.  I did try using a drinking straw (which is what I use for "poke" cakes, but the hole was way too big and noticeable.  I used nearly all of the glaze.  I think it would have glazed more easily and quickly had I let the cake and the glaze cool slightly before I started. Oh yeah...I used the Baileys Irish Cream with coffee flavor and it was terrific.  The glaze tasted a lot like butterscotch!  Thanks for sharing...you helped me impress my coworkers!

wow. Quite simple to make. We didn't have time to soak in all the glaze, so we served it on the side. It was FANTASTIC. Will go into heavy rotation at our house.

I took the advice of others and poured some of the glaze in the bottom of the bundt pan after I had flipped the cake out (made sure to let it cool first, or it would have fallen apart in the handling), then flipped the cake back into the pan to soak up the glaze.  I also poked holes in the bottom with a wooden skewer while the cake was upside down, and poured glaze from the bottom up.  Took this to my office today, and they raved about it.  I was afraid that it might turn into a flambe when we lit the birthday candles, as it smelled pretty "intoxicating"...but all was well.  Great recipe, thanks!

Awesome recipe!  Inlaws raved over it, have already been asked to make it again this weekend.  Only change I plan to make is the glaze- will make 1/3 to 1/4 of what is called for and drizzle rather than paint it on.  Personally, the cake stands on its own and doesn't need all the sugar coating, but husband & his family loved that part... This will easily become a staple recipe I'll be asked to make for years to come! ***updating*** I tried this recipe but with chocolate & Kaluha & again got raves from everyone! Next time I think I'll try chocolate cake mix/pudding with the Baileys. This recipe is simply a bo-brainer & turns out perfectly every single time~ EDITED 3/09: I've since made this cake using chocolate cake mix & Kaluha and got rave reviews on it too!

This is an awesome cake. I have been making it for a few years now and not just for St Patricks Day. Different Irish Cream liquors can make a difference. Bailey's and St Brendans are stronger while Carolan's gave it a light, subtle flavor. Just something to think about.

I've been making a similar rum cake recipe for years.  This Irish cream version has replaced that in my recipe book. This recipe is so simply and quick to make, it's great if you don't want to spend your day in the kitchen. I generally omit the nuts because many people don't eat them. The cake is good enough that it doesn't need the glaze. I'm interested in trying another reviewer's suggestion of letting the cake soak in the glaze in the pan. I get asked for the recipe when I bring this cake anywhere.

I've made this cake a number of times and it is always a hit!  What I do a bit differently is that I'll make some holes in the bottom of the cake before I remove it from the pan and pour about 1/4 of the glaze on and let that soak for a few minutes.  When I invert it onto the cake plate I poke more holes and spoon the rest of the glaze on gradually otherwise it runs off too quickly.  I actually "paint" some of the glaze on the sides of the cake with my silicone pastry brush so that the sides get some too.

This is one of my most requested cakes!  Some changes...  I use a butter pecan cake mix.  I don't use the 1/4 cup of water, but 1 full cup of Bailey's.  I toast my pecans.  I also do as one reviewer said...  I put my glaze into the pan, then put holes in top of cake with skewer and place back into pan for 20 min.  Very rich!  Wonderful with coffee!!!

Great cake - rave reviews from everyone who tries it.  We have also done this with chocolate cake and kahlua which isn't as fantastic but still great!

This truly is an amazing cake.  I've made it MANY times.  I'm wondering if it wouldn't be possible to substitute another cream liqueur for a change of pace!  I just bought some Voyant (Chai Cream Liqueur) and might give it a try...maybe add a little nutmeg to the batter, too.  Thanks so much for this OUTSTANDING recipe!

Pure delicious-ness. The Irish cream really flavors the cake. My changes were to use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (I was out) and macadamia nuts instead of pecans. I only had 1/2 cup of Irish cream, so I added 1/4 cup Buttershots. I followed the instructions and my cake baked and rose beautifully. I halved the glaze, and we loved the crunchy crust it made.

I made this yesterday for the first time. I followed the directions for the glaze absolutely to the letter, but my glaze was more like candy than a glaze. It was barely pourable, but I followed suggestions on here about putting the glaze in the pan and putting the cake back in the pan. I hoped that would have helped, but when I flipped the cake back out my glaze was hardened and left behind in the pan. I was able to scoop it out and crumbled it on top of the cake - more like crumbs than glaze. It looked nothing at all like the picture for the cake. In the future I think I will avoid boiling the glaze and just simmer it, and I will go by looks instead of time. 

Despite not looking that great, the cake tasted pretty good. It could have been a little bit more moist for my taste, but I used the butter recipe yellow cake mix instead of the standard yellow cake mix because that was what I had on hand. Next time, I'll try standard yellow cake mix and perhaps bump up the amount of Irish cream or oil.

I recently made this cake (Feb 2011) and as I proudly decorated it I thought it was a beautiful cake.  However - it didn't taste as good at it looked. It was way, way to rich (difficult to eat more than a bite) and almost too soggy for me.  I thought I'd copied the recipe down wrong, 3/4 cup of Irish cream liqueur, but no, that was the right amount.  If I were to make this again I'd use 1/4 cup of liqueur and no veg oil.  The frosting was perfect, the nuts on top were perfect but the texture was like those cheap store bought cookies that claim to be moist but really they're dripping with oil.  Sorry, it's just didn't live up to the hype, but with a little tweaking, it just might. Has anyone else modified this recipe with good results?

This cake is awesome!!!!. I make it and bring it to work and everyone raves about it. I even have fellow employees pay me to make for them! Sometimes I make it in a 13x9 pan when bringing to work.

Wow!! What an awesome cake. I used chocolate cake mix instead of vanilla, and I still used the vanilla pudding mix. It was sooo good. You can't go wrong with chocolate and Bailey's right?? I also did the icing procedure of putting the icing back in the pan and putting the cake back in the pan. My cake got kinda stuck, maybe I didn't greese it enough.. oh well, it still came out awesome. I will def. make this again for st.patty's day!! I'm excited to serve it!

This cake was awesome!  Very quick & easy to prepare.  I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I used chocolate chips.  The mixture of Baileys and chocolate chips were wonderful!  I had many compliments.  I'll definitely be making this again soon!

I've made this cake twice, the first time following the recipe exactly except I did follow one reviewers advice about pouring the glaze into the pan and letting the cake soak in it.

The second time I decided to follow my instinct about the sauce.  Normally for a boiled sauce with sugar in it, you don't stir at all.  It has something to do with the sugar crystals on the side of the pan.  The first time I stirred like the recipe said, the second time I did not stir the sauce at all, just let it boil for 5 minutes.  Then I added 1 shot of Jamison's Irish Whiskey and about 3 drops of Irish Cream extract.  Wow, that was the ticket!  The glaze turned out just like it should, creamy, not sugary.  I guess if you like the sugary grainy texture, go ahead and stir.  But adding the shot of whiskey and a couple of drops of the Irish Cream extract really boosted up the glaze taste.  I will be making it this way from now on, EXCELLENT Recipe!

This cake came out so moist, for that reason alone I would give 5 stars. The flavor is like the baileys. I used 1 cup of it bcuz of reviews I read, also didnt realize I was out of oil so I used the applesauce in place of oil. I cut the glaze in half because it seemed like a lot of sugar. It seemed to be enough but it was kind of grainy. I ended up drizzling a little chocolate on top which tasted perfect and looked so pretty!

Ok, well I took the basic idea and used what I had on hand.  Let me tell you, this is an extremely versatile recipe!  Here's what I did:  First, I didn't have any boxed yellow cakemixes, so I used 2 c. flour, 1.5 c. sugar, 1 T baking soda and vanilla flavoring instead (got the recipe off another site).  I subbed milk for the water, and since I didn't have Irish Cream liquor, I used butterscotch schnapps.  I also only had butterscotch pudding, which worked out well!  I used all the schnapps in the recipe, so I used Amaretto in the glaze.  I did what was suggested with the glaze (poured it in the pan and let the cake soak it up), and this cake is AWESOME!  Yes, I took lots of liberties with it but that just goes to show how versatile it is.  I can't wait to do it with the Irish Cream though!!!

followed the recipe exactly, except I took the suggestions of pouring 1/2 the glaze into the pan and replacing the cake. then glazed with a brush and let it sit for about an hour before I flipped it onto the plate. I've made it 4 times and there's never any left. One time I didn't have Irish Cream so I used E & J Cask and Cream Caramel Temptation and that went over very well! ENJOY!

Fabulous cake. Cool cake outside angel food pan, then carefully place back in pan to glaze for less mess. Expose to air so glaze gets crispy, then keep covered for a day before enjoying. Flavours were still fab after three days - I served slices with sweetened whipped cream and Irish coffee.

This cake was really good. I took another reviewers suggestion and added chocolate chips to the batter as well as sprinkled them on top. I'm not sure if the cake would've been as good with out the chocolate though. This is a keeper though, so great recipe and thanks for posting it.

I'm not sure what happened with my glaze- I tried the putting it back in the pan with the glaze thing and some went into the holes and some pooled along the top and feels greasy- Is the butter supposed to be 1/ 2 cup melted OR half cup , then you melt it with the sugar/water because thats waht i did and I have a feeeling there is too much butter in my glaze :(

I love the infamous Bacardi rum cake. I found this recipe and everything is basically the same as the rum cake recipe, so I thought it's gotta be good! I followed the recipe to a T and honestly the cake was just okay. My husband liked it but I thought it was too rich and too much glaze. I will stick to my rum cake recipe.

this cake was amazing! but beware of the "glaze". i think i messed it up, but it came out as carmel and when the carmel hardened it was near impossible to cut the cake. 

i would definitely make the cake recipe again, it was perfectly soft and moist but i would consider using another glaze next time

I've made this cake at least a dozen times since I first saw the recipe on Allrecipes a couple years ago. Wherever I take this cake, I always get asked for the recipe and there are never any leftovers! This cake is super moist and very easy to make - love it! :)

Can't stop eating it! Very tasty and so light. I used a Dr. Oetkers (German) Vanilla Pudding, which has no sugar added, instead of the intant pudding. I buy it at World Market or a Deli. Cake is plenty sweet. The frosting is a must.

My cake fell, but surely can't fault the recipe.  The glaze was outstanding.

This is a fool-proof awesome cake!     Prepping for this cake was so easy! The hardest part was chopping the pecans into slightly smaller pieces, and that's not at all hard.  I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out perfect! The only difference I made was to follow some earlier suggestions: I poked holes into the cake with a chopstick, removed it from the pan (carefully!) upside down onto a plate, poked more holes. poured 2/3 of the glaze into the pan, put the cake BACK into the pan, and poured the rest of the glaze onto the cake, guiding the excess glaze with a pastry brush.  I let it sit for 10 minutes, and my added trick: turned the pan upside down for 10 min onto my serving plate and DID NOT remove the pan from cake.  This allowed the glaze to harden and have that "just dripped" look when I removed the pan. Perfect! Although the Bailey's I used seemed super strong as I was baking, it definitely wasn't overpowering after baking.  I might try adding and extra 1/4 cup of Bailey's next time, to see how that'll taste. Nice hint: I picked up the "Bailey's with a Hint of Caramel". Yum! Will make this over and over and over again! I'll upload a photo soon!

Great dessert to bring to St. Patty's day meal.  Came out perfect!  Added chocolate chips in batter and on top of glaze.  Also used non-instant pudding and it worked just fine. (photo submitted)

Eliminated nuts (made for a bake sale). Unbelievably delicious, assuming you like Irish Cream.  You can definitely taste it!  I made this for a bakesale at my husband's office and he asked me to make another because some people didn't get to taste and he wanted to prevent an uprising.  Also many requests for the recipe... a definite winner.  Also, I have used the Williams Sonoma Bee Hive pan and the cake is very easily removed... so I wouldn't hesitate to use this in any other 'shaped' pans.

For Christmas dinner this year, I was in charge of dessert. I chose this recipe based on the great reviews. It is always scary to make something for the first time for a big event. Well, this is a winner! I followed the recipe exactly. I opted to glaze the cake, putting the remaining sauce in a bowl of people wanted extra on their piece, which of course they did. My son has already requested it. My husband (seriously, he is a head chef) said this cake was fantastic. This was awesome.

This cake did bake up beautifully. It rose well, it's moist and really lovely to look at. It does have a nice taste but it's very, very sweet. The addition of the glaze makes it sickly sweet, unfortunately. I would recommend not glazing this at all.

THIS WAS AN INSTANT HIT.  I made it 6 or 7 times in 2 weeks for Easter, St. Patricks day, pot luck's and 2 for my husband who says he "hates this cake" them proceeds to eat it all.  It has become a favorite and I get lots of requests for the recipe.  Wonderful texture and flavor.

I used chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding. I also added mini chocolate chips. I Ground the pecans and put then at the bottom of the pan before adding batter. When it came it was beautiful. My husband and I had to utilize self control not to eat it all. I followed the recommendation of pouring the glaze into the pan and putting the cake back into it. Worked well.

I made this cake for my husband to take into work for their office potluck on St. Patrick's Day. It was a huge hit ... people are still telling him how good the cake was. One tip: use baker's sugar, which is a very fine grain, and you won't have grainess to your glaze. I cut way back on the glaze ingredients but increased the Irish Cream, and still didn't use all of it on the cake. Brushed it on the hot cake with a pastry brush, and it soaked right in, and then I just poured more over the top. Still a box cake, but a good version of one. I need to make it again so I can see how it tastes!

To review this recipe in just one word, SENSATIONAL!!  But who can stop at one word...I Made this one day ahead of time in order to give the glaze a chance to soak in.  The cake was so moist and flavorful.  Here are some tips I used from previous reviewers:  I made the cake just as directed and let it cool in the mold for 10 minutes.  When the cake comes out, start making the glaze.  I used a turkey baster to incorporate a little bit of glaze on the bottom and along the sides of the cake while it's still in the mold.  I let that sit for 15 min, then took the cake out of the mold.  I had no problems with it sticking but you really do need to use butter or shortning with some flour instead of just the spray. I used a metal skewer to make the holes.  For the glaze I made a mistake and boiled ALL of the ingredients. I also added 1/8 cup of butterscotch snapps.  The taste was fantastic but it didn't get hard.  I just brushed the rest of the glaze on every 5 minutes until it was gone.  It does make a lot but it's what gives the cake some flavor and protects it from drying out. I will make this again for sure.  Thank you for this recipe.

I prepared this cake per the recipe, but chopped the pecans more finely than in other photos posted.  I used a fluted bundt pan, and drizzled the glaze on top, letting it run down the sides instead of "painting" it on.  Waiting a few minutes between drizzled "coats" of icing helped to form subtle layers of glaze, enhancing the ridged shape.  This was a tasty, moist cake, a perfect end to Christmas dinner.  The only thing I would do differently: Add more chopped pecans and incorporate these into the batter.

I fixed this for company we were having for the weekend - everyone loved it and it was gone in no time.  I fixed it according to the directions.  When putting the glaze on I used a pastry brush and "painted" the cake, let it sit for 5 minutes or so to let the glaze absorb, and went back put on another layer, and repeated until all the glaze was used up.  Excellent recipe!!

I didn't think this was very good. I think you should try Sour Cream Pecan Pound Cake instead..now that was amazing. Irish Cream? The Bailey's sure cost me a pretty penny but I couldn't find even the slightest hint of Irish Cream flavor. The end result for my bundt was similar to a doughnut (with glaze). So I shall call this an o.k. doughnut recipe. Let's leave it at that!

I made this cake today for St Patrick's Day. It was wonderfull! The only suggestions I have are 1) start watching the cake about 10 minutes before it is scheduled to be done, it took me about 5 minutes less 2)Invert the cke imediently into the plate that you will serve it on 3)Start making the glaze as soon as you take the cake out of the oven and it will be ready right as the cake is; once you start adding the glaze, stay with the cake and keep glazing it (if you step away for to long the glaze becomes to crystalized for applying to the cake). This is an incredable cake and well worth the expence of the Bailey's!!!

This turns out beautifully! What a lovely presentation also with the nuts on top. Delicious! I used Bailey's Irish Cream and only about half of the glaze. I am taking this one to the Radiology Department tomorrow for my Secret Pal as he loves Irish Cream Cake; my husband is currently pouting! ;-)

This cake is one of the most requested desserts I have ever served. Not only does it taste great day one it just keeps getting better, if you are lucky enough to have any leftovers that is!I use homemade Baileys in this and serve it with a dollop of freshly whipped cream also flavored with Baileys.

Now this is my kind of cake! I love Baileys and since I got my bundt pan for xmas, I couldn't wait to make this! Wonderful cake. I took the advice of those who stated that the sauce should be put into the bundt pan and replace the cake into the pan to "soak up" the sauce (good idea! Thanks!). Also, I used brown sugar instead of white when making the sauce and personally, I think the "sauce" should be cut in half as it makes the cake a little more "crumbly."  But my family, including my mom and dad who each had some, said it was great the way it was. In fact, my mom went to her fridge to see if she had enough Baileys to make this cake for herself. For those anti-bailey drinkers, the taste is subtle so don't turn this one down b/c of that ingrediant. Will make this one again (and so will my mom)! Thanks Sue for posting this!

I ran out of pecans so I substituted sliced almonds for the pecans and it was delish !!  The glaze was VERY sweet...and mine was a little grainy but still great.  I think I will make this again though with a few tips from here !!! (Brown Sugar for the glaze instead of white sugar, use pecans next time too) A keeper !!

I love using cake mixes, especially when one can't tell a mix was used.  This cake is fantanstic.  It is moist and easy to make.  The best part about it is the glaze, rich and sugary sweet, with that little bit of crunch, like a louisana crunch cake.  The Irish Cream is delightful and not at all strong.

Yay!! It was a hit!! I had all ingredients on hand and followed the directions exactly - great cake. I got a little caught up on the topping. I added cold baileys to the hot sugar and it immediately started to clump up. I had to return the sugar mixture to the heat to liquify it again. BUT, it was perfecto in the end!!!

I didn't change any ingredients, although I couldn't find a 18.25 oun. yellow cake mix and used the 16.5 oun. box. I poked holes with a round chopstick in the top as others had suggested so the glaze would soak through the cake. Perfect!!!

This was amazing!  I made it twice in 3 weeks for two different parties and everyone raved!  I put 3/4 of the glaze in the the pan, poked holes in the cake, put the cake back in, poured the rest of the glaze over the bottom of the cake and let it stand for 15-20 minutes to soak up the glaze.  i also added some mini chocolate chips to the cake batter.   I used 1 cup of irish cream instead of irish cream and water.  It was the best cake ever!

This was good but not as great as I thought it was going to be. The glaze is amazing but the cake itself is so so. If I decide to make this again, I think I will not do a yellow cake mix. I also may try and pour the Bailey's over top of the cake as soon as it gets out of the oven? Not sure if that would work but I felt like it could have been more moist and flavorful inside.

This is now my go to cake. I brought one to a staff luncheon and everyone asked for the recipe. Changed it up a bit by adding chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla since I am a huge chocolate fan. I am making a bunch of them for Christmas parties this year.

Great cake!  This cake is moist and delicious.  I made it twice in one week.  Once to 'test' it for my hubby's office Christmas party.  I, then, made it for the office party.  I substituted chopped almonds for the pecans.  I also did the glaze like another reviewer.  I made the glaze as the cake was cooling.  I put the glaze in the pan and poked holes in the cake and returned it to the pan to soak up the glaze.  This cake was a hit at the office party.  I highly recommend this cake.  Tasty, easy and looks like you spent hours on it!  Thank you Sue!!!!!

I wanted to love this cake but, was dissapointed overall. My husbamd didn't care for it either.The cake itself is good but the glaze was a little to be desired. Don't think I'll make it again. If I do, I will use a different frosting.

I poke holes with a wooden skewer into the cake the second it come out of the oven, then pour the hot glaze over it immediately & leave it overnight.  The next day its 100% perfect !

This cake was wonderful! It was very good the day I made it however it was even better the next day. The glaze was a little time consuming in terms of the basting process but it was well worth it. My family gave it rave reviews. I will make it again for sure!

this was extremely moist and  delicious. I made as directed except for putting the glaze in the bundt pan and adding the cake back into it.  It worked great.  Just make sure the cake is not so hot so you don't burn yourself.

I followed the directions exactly but I wasn't all that impressed. It still tasted very much like a boxed yellow cake. My dinner guests on the other hand loved it.

Everyone enjoyed this.  It is a rich, dense, moist cake.  Make certain you mix for 5 minutes on high, and also boil the glaze for the complete time so it thickens nicely.  Made as directed, except took another reviewers suggestion and poured 1/2 glaze in bundt pan, returned cake to the bundt pan and let sit for 20 minutes or so.  I then turned the cake out on plate and spooned remaining glaze over it.  This allowed it to soak up the glaze without it draining on the plate and then spooning the remaining glaze gave a nice presentation.  If the remaining glaze gets to "gelled", just heat for a little bit and then spoon it on.

As if this recipe with 600 plus reviews needs another.  But, I just made this cake for the first time and it is simply divine!  I followed the directions exactly and did not make any modifications.  I love love love this cake..... My husband loves this cake and he is typically not a cake fan.  Awesome recipe!

Amazing cake!! I made it last night for St. Pattys with corned beef and cabage and Brennan's Soda Bread recipe from this site.  It was a great meal!  I did have to exchange vanilla pudding for cheesecake pudding because I forgot to buy vanilla and I used a full cup of irish cream in the cake batter.  It is really rich and I will make it again!

DELICIOUS!!  Very, very, very good!!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and after pouring half the sauce over the cake, I put the cake back in the bundt pan, poked holes in the bottom and poured the remaining sauce over it.  Then I sat it in the refrigerator and heated it up for a few moments before I set it on the cake plate.  Will definitely make this again!!!!

Love !love! love! This cake and so does everyone I make it for. I have been making it for years for my annual St. Pat's day party and everyone just raves about it. 
It does make a lot of glaze, you just have to be patient and keep coating the cake until it is all used up. It is worth the time and effort I promise!

If you ever have any cake left over it is also great in the morning with a cup of coffee!

Didn't change a thing except for adding a smidgen more Irish Cream when making the glaze because I wanted a stronger flavor. I just took out half of the 1/4 cup water and replaced it with the I.C. Loved every bite. Thank you for sharing this. I could not think to change anything.

I started making this cake at the holidays of 2010.  Everyone loves it and has now become my go-to sweet to take anywhere!!  If fact it will make an appearance at the St. Patrick's Day parade party in 2011!  Although, I am sure this appearance will be brief!

Very good.  Made this with my homemade irish cream liqueur.  Reminds me of Bacardi's rum cake, very similiar.  A hit at the office.  Very moist. Just the right bit of irish cream, not overpowering.

I will admit that I did not use the glaze so this review is only on the cake portion of the recipe.  I followed the instructions to the letter and the cake part came out very moist and pretty but rather tasteless.   I am just not sure that any glaze could add that much more taste.

Wow was this super moist!  It turned out wonderful!  Like others, I didnt use all of the glaze.  Partly because I was getting to impatient and wanted to slice myself up a piece:)  I just wanted to note that the taste of alcohol was a tad strong in the glaze but that's fine by me!!  Delicious!

This was wonderful! If there is a way to mess up a recipe, I will find it, but not this time. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and poured about 2/3 of the glaze back in the pan.  I returned the cake to the pan and poured the rest of the glaze over the bottom of it. I let it soak for about 20 minutes.  I might have finally found something that I can take in to work for potlucks (usually I buy something to spare my coworkers the misery of eating something that I made).

Amazing perfection!  I used a butter pecan cake mix and french vanilla pudding.  I doubled the glaze and did the trick of pouring some in the pan and then putting the hot cake back in the pan to soak it up.  I poured some over the top (really the bottom) while it was soaking.  After I inverted it on my plate I continued to drizzle the glaze on top until it was thoroughly coated.  It was SOOO good!  Everyone used the extra glaze in the center to spread on their slices.  The pecan part at the top tasted like some sort of delicious pecan pie!  So good!

Wow...this is a phenomenal dessert!  I did as others suggested:  used a full cup of Bailey's in the cake, beat on high for the full 5 minutes, added 1/2 shot whiskey to the glaze; and then put 2/3 glaze in the pan, returned the cake to the pan, and then punched holes in the "bottom" of the cake and poured the rest of the glaze on it, let it sit for about 30 minutes, and then turned it back out.  Fantastic!

Delicious Recipe. I did as other reviewers suggested. Instead of adding 1/4 cup of water and 3/4 cup of Irish Cream to the cake mix, I didn't add any water and added 1 full cup of Irish Cream. It was delicious!

This cake was amazing. I took the advice of others and poured some glaze into the pan and replaced the cake to let it soak in, I then poked holes in the bottom of the cake and poured the glaze all over the bottom. I will be making this again very soon.

I made this for a party we have when the St. Paddy's Day Parade takes place near your home. I put it in the garage refrig. and with all the people and festivities I forgot to take it out. The next day during clean up my husband found it. It was the best coffee cake ever! I think that the extra day did the cake a favor. It soaked up all the icing I had poured over it right and it went through to the middle. It was moist but not musy and the pecans at the bottom are a must have. They add a nice crunchy topping and the Irish cream liquor gave it a wonderful flavor. I will make this again for my next parade party and maybe I might share it with the guests:)

This cake is amazingly good!  Followed the exact recipe for the cake except added extra pecans mixed with a little brown sugar and cinnamon in the bottom of the pan and more in the middle of the batter as well.  I wasn't sure about the glaze ingredients so I used the butter, with confectioner's sugar, a little vanilla and milk instead of water. Still added the irish cream to the glaze & it was very rich and very good.Thanks for a great recipe that I will use again!

Although I don't usually make cake from a mix, this was just the right recipe for a large crowd.  I made it with my own Irish cream liqueur.

This is the tastiest, albeit, ugliest thing I have ever made but that is my fault, not the recipes.  The cake itself turned out fantastic without making any changes!  But when I went to make the glaze I overcooked it.  I could have overcome this but instead I poured the glaze into the pan and stuck the cake back in.  As a result the glaze turned into a giant, hard lump on top.  I would recommend if you are unfamiliar with making glazes, do not try the cake-back-in-the-pan-and-let-it-site method of glazing.  I am familiar with glazes and allowed this mistake to happen!  That being said - I'm on my way down to the store right now to get ingredients to remake it.  It's just that good!

Excellent!!! I didn't have irish creme so i substitued the starbucks liqueor instead.  For the vanilla pudding I used 1.5 sugar free vanilla pudding and .9 oz sugar free banana creme pudding. This was what I had on hand in my pantry.  It still came out so wonderful.  My husband said it was the best cake I have ever baked.  Yummy!!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Yummm.  Tastes great.  One question....glaze calls for "white sugar".  Would this be granulated or powdered?  I ueed granulated and it didn't soak into the cake but tasted wonderful.

Another keeper recipe! Made this for our St. Patrick's potluck at work and everyone loved it! Smells heavenly while baking, too! It does have a good kick to it, so it might not be the best choice for kids or folks that don't imbibe!

Add me to the millions of fans of this cake!  I made it this weekend for my daughter's birthday and because she is a chocolate lover I used a chocolate cake mix and a chocolate instant pudding.  Turned out fantastic, and when my daughter left to go home, the remaining cake went too!

Absolutely delicious!  The glaze makes the outside of this cake a little bit crunchy and really soaks in well.  The only thing I'd warn about is to make sure that you spray as well as flour the pan before pouring in the mix.  The Flour is a crucial step to the success an in tact bundt once you turn it out onto a platter!  I discovered this the hard way!

I made this recipe twice- once using devil's food cake mix and Kahlua, and once using a spice cake mix and Tuaca. They were both phenomenal!! The second time I increased the pecans to 1.5 cups and drizzled melted white chocolate over the top. YUM!

This cake is great.  Instead of putting the nuts on the outside of the cake I put them in the food proccessor with a little cinnamon and brown sugar and layer that in the cake.  I also decreased the amount of sugar in the glaze to 3/4 cup!  Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly and I found this cake to be on the dry side and the glaze much too sweet. It reminded me of a dry Krispy Creme donut. There are a lot of great cake recipes out there but this is not one of them. Sorry

made this cake for 'Bunco'...the night before, following some peoples' advice to glaze using the bundt pan.  Found that if you leave it more than a few minutes, the cake may stick to the pan... since I wasnt serving until the next evening, I found the glaze to be kind of unsightly after 24 hours...tasted fine though...sugar in the glaze crystallized, has anyone else found this to be the case?

I just made this for a Thanksgiving dry run.  Wanted to make sure it tasted good and that the silicone bundt cake pan I was going to use would really work...thumbs up to both.  I will be taking this to work tomorrow or I will eat the whole thing myself.  When I do make it for Thanksgiving I will likely use less of the glaze and probably mix the pecans into the batter.  Outstanding!

ETA:  I did substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil.  I almost always do.  I have found that one of the lunch snack cups usually works perfect for half cup and i don't waste applesauce that way.

I am so bummed I didn't like this recipe.  I tried making it for a party and no one was really impressed.  I have never tried a five star recipe I didn't like but I don't think I did anything wrong.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good.  I won't be trying this one again.

Delicious cake, and easy to make.  One tip, make the glaze AFTER the cake is out of the oven.  I made mine while the cake was still baking, and it cooled to the point of being too thick for the cake to soak up.  The glaze however, is so yummy, it didn't make a bit a difference!  This is one I am definately keeping in the recipe box.  Thanks for sharing, Sue.

This cake was a snap to make and tasted heavenly (especially since I loooove Bailey's Irish Cream).  I baked it first for my family and then for my co-workers and the votes were unanimous:  delicious!

This turned out great! I used 1 cup of Bailey's and deleted the 1/4 cup water. Also, I did 2 batches of the glaze ... one slightly under cooked for it would be easier to pour into the wholes and then put the rest into the bundt pan and replaced the cake for 20 min. I then poured the well cooked glaze over the top ... was great!

I've made this recipe a number of times and only have this to add.  Once you remove the cake from the oven let it sit 10 minutes in the pan - in the meantime prepare the glaze.  For the glaze bring to a boil the butter, water and sugar - remove from heat.  Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup Bailey's (depending on your taste preference) and stir.  Remove the cake from the pan - using a long tine fork (a meat fork works well) liberally poke holes all over the cake.  Put the cake back in the pan and pour the glaze at the middle and around the edges of the pan.  Lightly shake the cake and tilt back and forth to make sure the sides get some glaze.  Let sit a couple of minutes so the glaze gets absorbed.  Invert cake on serving plate and let cool.

This was a hit with my Soup Club and with my husband.  I was worried about the 18.25 oz. cake mix because all of the mixes in our stores are now between 15 and 16 oz.  I used a cake mix that was about 16 oz., made no other changes to the recipe, and it worked fine.  I used a nine-inch bundt pan, and that was a good size for the amount of mix.  One other suggestion I'd make is to make sure you get the glaze to a full rolling boil before you start the five minute timing.  If you don't, the glaze may not set up and will be too runny.

So yummy. Everyone loved it.  Did what the previous people did, to put the icing in the bundt pan and put the cake back in.  Turned out great!  Will be making this for years to come!

This was simple and delish! I followed the other review and instead of brushing the glaze on, I removed the baked cake, poured the glaze back in the pan and then let the cake soak in the glaze (after poking holes in the cake.) I took it to an irish food-themed party and it was given rave reviews! Will def make again...most and delicious and not too sweet or heavy. I like that it wasn't paired with chocolate like most other recipes with bailey's.

A lovely, moist cake which I will definitely make again! However, I couldn't taste the Irish Cream in the cake and my friends who tried the cake had the same comment. I'm wondering if it's because I used another brand of Irish Cream and not Baileys. 
This is recipe is a keeper and is going in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing!

It was good, but no one at work could identify the irish cream flavor even though I put in more than the recipe called for!!!   Not sure it's worth making, although the pudding in the mix makes it very very moist.

I made some cupcakes with this recipe.  Didn't use the glaze but topped with Irish cream butter cream frosting.  First time, I used the Oreo cookie and cream pudding mix since that's the closest pufpddung mix I had in hand.  I let my husband take these cakes to his work and he said tpalk cupcakes were gone less than an hour.  In fact, they asked me to make some more again since some people didn't even get any or some people couldn't have the 2nds.

Delicious, but I think the ingredients speak for themselves.  it was an expensive recipe, especially if you use Baileys.  Everyone thought it was very  decadent and rich.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This bundt cake is AWSOME!  I love how the pecans are baked on the top of the cake.  It is a very moist and RICH cake, however, I would suggest if you don't want the strong taste of the Irish Cream add less of it when making the icing.  I found this recipe by chance, tried it and we absolutely loved it!  EXCELLENT!!!

This is so unbelievably good.  It's a lot like a rum cake, only with Irish cream instead of rum.  I didn't change anything about the recipe and we completely devoured it in a matter of days.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Tried this on a whim for Thanksgiving dessert.  What a delicious dessert...an unusual bundt cake in that it is light, moist and fluffy as opposed to rich and dense (which is also good).
I don't like drinks made with Bailey's but I LOVED the subtle taste of the liquor in this cake.  p.s. EVERYONE had seconds!

Awesome, moist, must make again cake!  Made for Thanksgiving and the family LOVED it.  Added mini chocolate chips to the pecans for the topping.  Didn't make any other modifications.  Will definitely make this time & time again.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Good moist cake. I will make again. I halved the butter for the glaze and boiled for 4 minutes, made a real thick glaze, that had to be brushed on with a pastry brush. Thanks for a great cake recipe!

This cake had so much flavors! Instead of using 1/4 cup water in the recipe, I used a whole cup of Irish cream (Baileys). I do not agree that you cannot taste the Irish cream within this cake. Everyone who tried it could not stop talking about how moist it was and how delicious the Irish cream made it. I also agree that you only need to make half of the glaze, I ended up tossing half in the garbage. This is definitely going on my favorite's list.

One last note. People were saying that there was too strong of a yellow cake taste. It is not the yellow cake you are tasting, it is the vanilla pudding taste. Next time I will try a different flavor, such as Cheesecake pudding.

Delicious cake!! I did one thing different though, I bought a cake mix that already had pudding mixed in and added another pack of pudding any way. It was amazing. I also used green food dye in the glaze and marbled it in the batter. This will be a staple in my St. Patrick's Day menu.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it was deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious. I made two 9 inch rounds and stacked it. I baked them at around 27 minutes at 325 degrees. I followed directions exactly except I put a full cup of Bailey's instead of 3/4. I then made a basic white frosting with egg whites and put two tablespoons of Baileys in it!! So Yummy, Moist and flavorful!! Definitely will be keeping this in my recipe box!

Hubs said, "This is restaurant quality!" so I guess he liked it! Wonderful ending for our weekly family dinner.  Not overly sweet which was a nice surprise.  Very moist and rich with just a hint of the liqueur. Reminds me of a rum cake I used to make.  If I ever have Irish Cream leftover again I will  be sure to make this cake -Thank you Sue!

Simply amazing.  Followed the reviews of others and poked holes, etc.  Worked like a charm and I will definitely make this again, especially since I now have a bottle of Bailey's in the house...that's if I don't drink it on the rocks first.

Very good!!!! (Suggestion)-Put cake on cookie tray during the glazing process. Then transfer to your cake dish for presentation. I think I will also try this in a 9x13, baking at a lesser time. And glaze the top with the glaze and pecans. (I also added crushed Heath bar to the top of this. THE GLAZE IS ULTIMATLY DELICIOUS!!!! (Glaze would taste great on ice cream for a topping!)

This is by far the best bunt I have ever had, let alone made! Besides the fact that I am a horrible baker, and usually loathe the dry and tasteless 'bunt', my family was very pleasantly shocked and have now promoted me to amateur cake baker...(only cake for now).

Very soft cake even after it was only loosely covered with saran wrap for 5 days! I chose not to use the pecans and it was wonderful!

Love this cake made one with and one without nuts. Loved them both. I used really cheap cake mix and pudding mix in one and couldn't tell the difference. Everyone at my meeting loved them both and gobbled them up.Will make again and again.

Many requests for this cake to be made again, and my husband said this is the best cake I've ever made with presentation and taste. I used a white cake and chocolate pudding because it's what I had on hand. I made this in a monkey bread pan. I followed the reviewer who suggested pouring the glaze back in the pan and putting the cake back. I also poked holes in the bottom while it was soaking and drizzled with sauce.

Delish! I took the advice of other reviewers and took the cake out of the pan, poured about 1/2 the glaze in the bottom of the pan and then put the cake back into the pan.  I poked a lot of holes in the top (bottom) of the cake while in the pan and then poured the remaining glaze over the cake to absorb. Perfect!

The cake does have a nice flavor, and the cake mix makes it very easy. I would question the advice to put the glaze in the bottom of the pan and putting the cake back into the pan to soak it up. I did that, and when I tried to remove the cake to the serving dish, the whole cake split apart. What a mess! It seemed the glaze acted like a glue. I will try this cake again, but I will just do the normal glazing method that has worked before: poke holes and drizzle!

This cake was very good! The glaze was definitely the best part!  Other reviewers said the cake was too sweet and too much like a doughnut... personally I didn't find it too sweet (although by tasting the batter I thought it would be) and I can see why it was compared to a doughnut as it was very dense and somewhat "dough" like in texture. I enjoyed the addition of the pecans and next time I may mix some into the glaze so they aren't just concentrated at the top of the cake. I only ended up using enough glaze to coat the cake a couple times and so I would suggest cutting that bit in half (but keep the amt. of irish cream the same - that's the best part!). Overall, good flavor and everyone really enjoyed it (even my picky younger brother!) and some even wanted the recipe.

The cake itself was very moist, but I wasn't a fan of this recipe. I guess I was expecting (and hoping) that the Irish Cream would be the dominant flavor, but it just wasn't. I think the cake itself was great, though, and I would make it again, but maybe use milk instead of the Irish Cream and then a citrus glaze.

I made this exactly as posted. Very nice flavor and very moist. I thought there was plenty of irish cream flavor. As far as the glaze, it thickened as it cooled so I poured it slowly, a little at a time. After all of the glaze was used, I used a brush to pull the glaze that fell to the plate back up and just kept brushing it up the sides until there was very little left on the plate. Beautiful. Will definitely make again.

My family polished this off in two days flat.  I thought the Irish Cream flavor was weak, I prefer the Rum Cake recipe made with rum instead.

Just made this using Drambuie Sylk and it is one of the prettiest and tastiest cakes I have ever made!   I read comments and put the glaze in the pan and the cake back in to soak up the glaze.  At first I couldn't get it to turn back out of the pan, but a couple of minutes in the still warm oven softened the glaze enough for it to come out beautifully!  I reserved some glaze to drizzle over and sprinkled a few more nuts.  I will definitely be making this again!

This cake is perfectly moist and sweet for my taste.  I have made this cake several times.  It has become a tradition to make it for our New Years Eve family gathering. I still have problems with the glaze getting a grainy texture.  Next time will try adding the Irish Cream slowly to the glaze as recommened by other reviewers.

A few years ago, I had a friend at a job that made me a kahlua bundt cake all the time.  It was so incredibly good and I've never forgotten about that cake (I no longer work there).  Well, this is that cake!  Only, of course, with the Bailey's instead.  Probably the best cake I've had in my life.  I used regular vanilla pudding (not instant), 2 boxes and 1 box yellow cake mix.  And I used a full cup of Bailey's instead of the water, as suggested by others.  Also, when I made the glaze, I followed the directions exactly, only I SLOWLY added the Bailey's and I had no problem with it being grainy or anything like others have said.  Oh - also I didn't have a bundt pan so I used a large rectangle one instead.  Worked fine.  I will definitely be making this one again and again.  So, so good.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

update:  I made this again at Christmas with some creamy Jamaican liquor that my sister had and it was equally awesome.  I heated it up and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it.  So, so good.  Thanks again!

A true staple.  Brought this over to the family and it was gone in a snap.  Very moise and just delicious.  Did not use the glaze and it was great without it.

We served this at my baby shower and it was a huge hit! The flavors go so well together. I thought it might be too sweet, but it was just right. The alcohol, nuts, and irish cream are the perfect match. You have to try this! It's even better day #2

YUMMY! This was great. Followed the recipe but as other said I put the glaze in the pan and them put the cake back in the pan.  I poured some on the bottom of the cake while it soaked up the glaze.  I don't know if this was really a glaze, but it was sure good.

The hit of my St. Pats party!  Incredibly moist and delicious.  I also poured glaze in pan and returned the cake to the pan to let it soak up the glaze.  Absolutely perfect.  Even my husband loved it and he doesn't usually like dessert that doesn't have chocolate in it!

I made this cake for my sister's birthday. I have mixed reviews, I found the cake a bit dry. My family loved it however. The thing we all agreed on was the great flavor of the glaze.

This was great and easy! I think that the other reviewers might have something with pouring the glaze in the bundt pan before inverting it, but mine still turned out wonderfully. Also, maybe warm up the Irish cream before pouring it in the glaze? Maybe mine got a bit lumpy. Still good!

This is excellent.  Even better when it sits for a day.  I made it with homemade irish cream, which by the way is much better than the purchased Bailey's Irish Cream.

My friends gobbled this stuff up! They liked this cake even more than the ones I spend over 2 hours to make! Excellent recipe. I add a little more irish cream to the batter and you don't need as much glaze as the recipe gives...but you can always use the leftover glaze on your next one! You WILL want to make this more than once.

Made this cake for a St. Patty's day party and EVERYONE loved it and asked for the recipe.  I did use chocolate pudding though, only because that was all I had.  You can really taste the Irish Cream.  I thought there was a little too much glaze though. I am making it again today for a birthday.  Great recipe. A real keeper!!

I didn't try it but made 3 for offices that I visit and got RAVE reviews.  I mean, for 5 days after people were calling to say how tasty it was and asking for the recipe.  I did up the Baileys a bit, but other than that, no changes.  Thanks for the hit!

Made this for St. Patrick's Day and it was the perfect finish to our ham and cabbage meal. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I only had whole pecans so I did have to put them in my chopper and they made the cake look wonderful. My husband thought that it was really good but I couldn't get the kids (teenagers) to even try it. Oh well, their loss more for hubby and I! Thanks for sharing.

I made this cake a few months ago for a friend's birthday. Everyone loved it. I got 3 requests this past month from people who remembered me making it. It is moist and actually tastes like there's alcohol in it. A good tip for the glaze is to take the cake out of pan and pour half of glaze into bottom of pan then put cake back in to soak it up. Pour other half over it.

Excellent cake!  This was my first attempt at a bundt cake and my family raved about it!  I didn't have any plain Bailey's, so I used the mint chocolate Bailey's with a white cake mix and it was just fabulous!  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely AMAZING!  It's my new favorite cake.  I've made it several times and it's loved by all.  However, I don't put all of the glaze on as it made the center of the cake a bit too mushy.  LOVE IT!

This went over great with co-workers and was easy to make.  I like to let the cake soak while still in the pan, and usually for at least 12-24 hours.

Left out the nuts and didn't make the glaze. It would've been too sweet for us. Regardless, this is the BEST CAKE EVER!

Great cake texture. Wish it had more of a Bailey's taste. Next time I would at least double the amount of irish cream. After the cake cooled a bit, I poured the glaze into the pan and put tried letting the cake soak up the glaze.   Wouldn't try this again. It would be better just to pour it over the cake.

Used Baileys with a hint of caramel for the glaze, and it turned out excellent.  Moist and yummy.  Some debate on the nuts among my guests, but that seems to just be a personal preference.  Putting them on top made it hard to pierce the top, so I'd like to try it with them mixed into the batter.  Great recipe.

I brought this to work and everyone just loved it.  The only change I made was I used chopped walnuts because I didn't have pecans.  It was still very yummy!  The sauce is SO good!

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day party this past weekend.  There were many desserts there but this was by far the best one.  The cake is delicious and very easy to make.  You can cut the glaze amount in half.

Very good and quite popular at the party.  Based on other comments I made only half the amount of frosting and there was still plenty.

Wonderful! I had to rate this one! I too skipped the nuts and used devil's food cake mix and chocolate pudding.  It tasted like an irish cream-glazed, devil's food doughnut.

I have made this cake a lot using Crown Royal instead of Bailey's.  Also, I prefer it without  nuts.  When I do the glaze, I start it while the cake is still in the oven, then pour some of it over the hot cake (while still in the pan).   Then I take a baster and inject some of the glaze directly into the cake. Then I let the cake cool and turn it out.  It's really tasty, and if it sits for a week, it's even better.

This bundt cake ROCKS!  I've made it a few times for different crowds and got rave reviews.  I'm a big Irish Cream fan, so this cake was perfect for me.  Didn't use Bailey's the second time I made it, though -- used some other cheapo Irish Cream.  This substitution made no discernable difference in the taste.  Absolutely wonderful!!! (Plus, you can sip the Irish cream while you cook.  Bonus!! *thumbs up*)

This cake is just awesome!  I changed the Irish Cream to Kahlua.  I also put the cake back in the pan to glaze it. I was really afraid it won't work but it was easy.  The cake is so moist you have be careful with it so it doesn't break apart.  Every time I bake it people want the recipe..Thanks Sue for this great recipe.....

I NEVER write reviews, but I always get recipies off of this site.  This cake was SO GOOD that I had to write back in!!!  I took someone's advice and added green food coloring to the glaze.  It was perfect for St. Patty's Day!!  I tested it out on my family this weekend, and I'm definitely going to make it again next weekend for a St. Patty's Day party!!!!!  My house smells so wonderful too!

All I can say is WOW!  Not only was it a cinch to make, it smelled awesome and ended up tasting incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  There was a lot of glaze, but I used it all anyway.  Made it for work and it was gone in a flash with everyone asking me to make it again soon.  Thanks Sue for sharing such a sensational recipe!! :)

This was awesome!!! I have one of those fancy bundt pans and I was in search of a good cake to make in it for the presentaion.  I FOUND IT!!! I made the cake the day before my party and glazed it the next morning, and it was soooo moist!! I did not use the pecans, (someone is allergic) and it was still the best!!!!

Fantastic! Very moist & tasty. My husband said that it was the best cake he ever had. It was a big hit at the party I took it to. I wouldn't change anything except to cut the amount of icing in half.

What can I say...it was outstanding and everyone loved it!! After finding out that our planned dessert had fallen through, I took a chance and made this for the first time on Christmas Day in my new Nordic Ware Holiday Tree bundt pan. After reading all of the rave reviews, I figured it couldn't be bad. (I have to admit, it was hard to believe all of the hype!) But, worthy it was. I had made the Original Irish Cream for gifts and had a couple of pints saved for today's festivities and was able to use it in the recipe. The cake came out PERFECT! It even filled the 10 cup pan exactly. I did heed the advice of others and only made half of the glaze. And, the next time I use the tree pan I'll probably tint the glaze green...probably this week for the office crew! Enjoy!

This is great! I took one of reviewer Linda Mclean's ideas and put 1/3 of the batter into a pot of melted chocolate chips, mixed it all together, and then sandwiched that layer in between two layers of the regular batter to make a chocolate swirl. That turned out very pretty! I didn't make the glaze for this cake, we served it with ice cream instead. Also, I left out the nuts, as my husband doesn't like nuts. Will make this one again!

I made this for some relatives that were in town for a funeral and it was a big hit.  One of the men NEVER eats dessert, he had 3 pieces before the evening was out, that should tell you how good this is.  I did make one substitution.  I didn't have any vanilla instant pudding, so I used cheesecake instant pudding, plus I had to bake mine a little longer than 60 minutes.  One word of caution.  BE SURE YOU GREASE AND FLOUR YOUR CAKE PAN INSTEAD OF USING THE COOKING SPRAY.  I used the cooking spray and mine stuck to the pan in a couple of places.  I just got it out and put it together anyway.

OH MY GOD!!!  This cake was so so good.  It reminded me of a "Tortuga" rum cake.  This cake was gone in one day and there are only three of us here.  This is an easy recipe and one of the best cakes ive ever eaten.  Id give it 10 stars if I could.  The only problem i had was too much icing.  Id cut that in half next time.  Overall... AWESOME!!

This was an excellent cake.  It came out of the pan, picture perfect, after baking.  I made half the glaze using light brown sugar rather than white.  Removed the cake from the pan after 10 minutes, poured the glaze into the pan, then inverted on a plate within a minute or less.  Everyone loved it.  I'll make this again and look forward to trying other cake flavors and other liqueurs.

Awesome!  I also used brown sugar instead of white for the glaze and boiled it for about 4 minutes.  I used Kahlua instead of Irish Cream and it was divine.  I let the cake cool in the pan, poked holes and poured on the glaze.  After it cooled, I turned (carefully) it over onto a serving platter.  It's a hit.  I'm making this one again.

This is the best cake that I have ever made!  I did take the advice of others and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also cooled the cake and then placed it back in the pan with 3/4 of the syrup and poured the remainder over the top and let it sit for 45 minutes.  PERFECT!  I have made this cake twice in the last two weeks!

Excellent flavor and very moist.  There is too much glaze, though.  Next time I bake it I will half the amount of the glaze ingredients.  Everyone enjoyed this cake on St. Patrick's Day this year.

This is a great cake.  Just made it for my father's 59th birthday.  One night weekly we get together and have coffee with Bailey's so this cake was perfect for him.  The liquor taste is subtle.  I did "soak" the cake in the glaze in the cake pan.  It made a wonderful sugary-crisp coating.  This is a great cake for when you don't want to be bothered with a frosting.

I made this recipe for St. Patrick's Day on a recommendation from a friend. It was so good that I shared some cake with two neighbors so it wouldn't go to waste. One neighbor said it was the best cake they had ever had in their life. No exaggeration. The other said they loved it too.
Personnally, I think the icing makes it. But the cake is extremely smooth as well.

Oh wow!!!  This was soooo yummy!  My only drawback was that when I tried to take it out of the pan, it broke apart, but that was probably my fault (sometimes my cake comes out perfectly, sometimes it doesn't!).  It was still incredibly delicious!  I left out the nuts because I don't care for them.  I will definaltly make this again!!
**UPDATE:  I made this for a get-together last night and I realized that I put 3/4 cup of Irish Cream in the glaze instead of 1/4 cup.  It still turned out delicious!!!

This is WONDERFUL! Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Of course you can always drizzle a little Bailey's over the ice cream too....

I made the cake following the recipe and suggestions from previous bakers:  I used 1 C Baileys in the cake instead of 3/4 C and 1/4 C water, I used a Duncan Hines cake mix and I poured 2/3 of the glaze into the pan and put the warm cake back in to absorb it.   
I brought this cake to a party last night and it was a hit.  It was super moist with a nice crust on the outside and the Baileys flavor was smooth and perfect (I used real Baileys because it is so much better than the other options as it contains whiskey and not wine)  I had to save a piece to bring home for my daughter who was begging to have some the whole time it cooked- it made the house smell amazing!  My friend, who is a caterer, told me it was a top 10 cake she has had.  I will definitely be baking it again.  Love it!

Very easy to make and has great flavor. I did add a little extra Bailey's to the glaze for a stronger flavor. 
I highly recommend once its cool, removing the cake from the pan and adding half the glaze to the bottom off the bundt pan. Poke some holes all around the cake then place it back into bundt pan and pour the rest of glaze over the bottom.  It absorbs very quick and is nicely covered. 
Enjoy!!

I will definitely make this again.  I had Kahlua  on hand, so used that instead of Irish cream. I didn't have a box of pudding mix so I just omitted it. The flavor and texture were excellent. I did follow other poster's  advice about putting glaze in the bundt pan and putting the warm cake bake in the pan to soak it up.

Used Duncan Hines white cake mix...IMO it's the best mix, cakes always come out moist with nice texture.  
As others have recommended, used Bailey's full strength instead of diluted with water; inverted cake after cooling about 20min, poured half the glaze in the pan, added the cake back in, then poked holes in the bottom and poured some glaze across.  
Once the cake came out, brushing the rest of the glaze on worked quite well, instead of just pouring or spooning on.

although I am not one to enjoy cake mix recipes, I made this for a family St. Patrick's celebration and must say that it was quite good and everyone enjoyed.  It not only was moist but stayed moist.  I had to make this ahead of time and then travel with it in a cake keeper.  it travels well, and stays moist for days on end.  The only thing I did differently was  in making the glaze; I used all irish cream and no water.  I loved the buttery tasting, creaminess of the glaze made this way.  thanks for this super easy keeper recipe.

Outstanding. I followed RBFOUR instructions for glaze application with excellent results. I saved some of the glaze, placed a few more pecans over the top of cake after it cooled, then poured the reserved glaze over the top.

So delicious! I used O'Donnells (Aldi's version of Baileys) caramel cream, instead of Irish cream; and it was AMAZING! If you're a fan of caramel, I would definitely recommend (re)creating this as a caramel creme cake! It was so impressive that my sister-in-law insisted that I make it for her 30th birthday.
Update: I since have used many varieties of Baileys! My absolute favorite is the vanilla cinnamon! Oh, and instant chocolate pudding mix instead of vanilla! You won't be disappointed!

WOW . . . this has to be the best cake EVER!  It's even better w/o the sauce poured over it and served as an add on.

NOTE:  To adjust for smaller sized boxes of cake mix . .  
ADD 3 Tablespoons of extra cake mix for every missing ounce of mix.  To keep from having to always buy 2 boxes, I keep an extra box of mix to adjust other boxes as I open them.  That extra box will adjust about 5 cakes.

Everyone raving about this cake. It was a hit. The only thing I did differently was add a small amount of batter to the pan, added the pecans and then the rest of the batter. I found this makes it easier to cut the cake.

So great recipe.  Cake came out cooked perfectly! I personally enjoyed the cake tasted wonderful with the pecans on top. 
But no one in my family has had an Irish creme cake before and did they did not like the alcohol taste it had. So this one will be in the not bake again pile, just for that simple fact.  
But again great recipe,  easy to follow and comes out perfect!

Baked this cake for Christmas this year - it was absolutely delicious. Since this recipe was submitted, boxed cake mix sizes have decreased in size depending on the brand. I used a cake mix "upsizer" recipe found on this site to bring the box cake mix weight to this size needed. Wonderful cake! Thanks so much!

I was unsure how smart it was to choose this as my first bundt cake, but it turned out to be very easy to make and it tastes wonderful! My husband likes it, and I can't wait to share it with our family for Christmas! My only new-be thing was not knowing how long to wait between glazing. I wasn't sure what it meant by waiting for the glaze to set before adding more, so I probably ended up with more on the paper towels under the drying rack than was necessary.

I started making this cake, though with rum, about 30 years ago. It is essentially an old Bacardi recipe, though I've found it better with a good quality dark rum such as Myer's. I've substituted various liqueurs, and my personal favorite is amaretto with almonds instead of pecans.  I prefer the yellow cake mix myself, though for chocolate lovers I've found a marble cake works best for both taste and appearance.   This is my first time using Bailey's, and I was not disappointed, and it was a hit as always.

Alcohol was WAY to strong. Followed recipe exactly. Won't be visiting this one again. Also use confectioners sugar instead of white sugar when using the glaze. Otherwise it's just not as pretty as it is in the photo.

This was amazingly easy and delicious!  I made it for a St. Patrick's Day party at work, and I suspect it will be the first of many occasions.   A couple of things.....first, the average box of cake mix is only 16.5 ounces, not 18.25 ounces.  I kept all the other ingredients the same, but shortened the baking time by five minutes, and it came out perfect.  We have a pecan allergy in our family, so I used chopped hazelnuts instead of pecans, and they were delicious with the Bailey's flavor.   For the glaze, I used organic turbinado sugar and organic sweet butter in addition to the water and Bailey's.  It cooked into a rich caramel sauce that was just heavenly on the cake.   A great special occasion dessert, but easy enough to make anytime!

Made this when my in-laws were in town Unanimous 5 stars all around. Had this for dessert after dinner with coffee.  i bought 5 of the small airplane size baileys.  2 were caramel flavor, 3 were original (just because that is what they had on hand at the liquor store).  Came out great.

OMG this cake is awesome! I made this for supper on the weekend and my guests kept asking for another slice until it was all gone. My only change was to sprinkle half of the chopped pecans into the bottom of the Bundt pan and then pour in some of the batter and then sprinkle in the rest of the pecans before adding the balance of the batter.

The cake was so moist! I used Baileys Vanilla and Cinnamon Irish Cream. I also followed some other people's suggestions of pouring the glaze in the bundt pan and then submerging the cake in it for about 20 minutes. This cake was a big hit at a dinner with girlfriends!

A superb cake . . . very moist and the Irish cream glaze and chopped pecans take it over the top. Mixed Spectrum Organic All Vegetable Non-hydrogenated shortening, oil, and Wondra flour (1 tablespoon each) into a semi-liquid paste, and brushed Bundt pan for easy release of cake. To upsize a 15.25 ounce boxed yellow cake mix to 18.25 ounces, mixed 4 tablespoons all-purpose flour, 2-1/3 tablespoons white sugar, 1/3 teaspoon baking powder, and a pinch baking soda which was combined with cake mix. This achieved a baked cake perfectly filling a Nordic Ware Bundt pan (10-15 cup). Subbed ¼ cup almond milk for same amount of water in making batter and glaze. Used safflower oil and Carolans Irish Cream. Poured the glaze into the Bundt pan as described by others. When a recipe achieves a full five star rating (greater than 4.75 average) by hundreds of reviewers over a 13+ year period, you know you’ve found a winner unless your taste preferences differ from the masses or mistakes were made in preparing this cake. See ‘View Notes’.

I made this for St. Patty's and it turned out great! My husband and I aren't heavy Bailey's drinkers, however, so in the future I would go easier on the Irish cream in the icing. It was too overpowering for us, but not for our friends! They practically inhaled the cake.

Cant add any more to the other reviews except to mention, it really does help to pour 2/3 of the glaze  into the pan and put the cooled cake back in then add the remainder of the glaze, letting it sit for 20 minutes.  Also, I plan on experimenting with this recipe because I think it lends itself to a struesel swirl through the middle.  Also, I might use a carmel cake mix next time.  A wonderful any occasion cake!

I made this cake for my husband's bday.  We celebrated with some friends and have one member who is a huge critic when it comes to dessert, he absolutely loved it as did everyone else!  It was super easy to make (as I am not a baker). I took it out about 12 minutes earlier than the directions said, it was incredibly moist.  I will definitely be making this again.

Tried this on many occasions with rave reviews. Tonight, I only had about 2/3 a cup of Irish cream. I topped that off with Frangelico and then used Frangelico in the glaze: delicious! Also followed the suggestion of those who poured the glaze in the bottom of the pan and tipped the cake back in while both were still warm to the touch. The glaze soaked into the cake about half an inch and then created a nice crust as it cooled.

It is great. I followed one of the reviews and made one without nuts and used chocolate pudding, the other was the regular recipe with nuts and vanilla pudding.  I cut both in half and kept one for family, the other halves sent to work.  Well, the chocolate without nuts topped in cake tasting.  Thanks to one of the reviews idea.

I made this recipe for my family for St. Patrick's day and they loved it!!  The cake came out moist and delicious.  I found the Bailey's to be a little overwhelming, but the cake still turned out really well.  Made it exactly as the recipe says to and will defintely make it again.

This is a wonderful, moist, flavorful cake. I used 1 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream coffee creamer in the batter in place of the 3/4 cup I.C. and 1/4 water.  I also used applesauce instead of oil, 1 egg white, plus 3 eggs and toasted the pecans.  I let the cake bake for 60 mintues and then sit in pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a plate. As others suggested, I filled the the bottom of the bundt pan with 2/3 of the glaze and put the cake back in for an hour. I used the rest of the glaze for the bottom and sides. The cake is the perfect consistancy, taste and texture. The Irish Cream adds wonderful flavor without being over powerful.  I can't wait to try many different flavors for this recipe.

This cake is awesome esp if you like Irish cream. I followed several of the tips:  poured glaze back in pan and put cake back in, put 1 cup of Irish cream in mix and omitted water. So yummy!

Saw it, made it and love it!  This is fantastic although my personal opinion is that it does not need the nuts.  I made it with a few and it would have been overkill with the amount it called for.  Again, that is just personal opinion.

I made 12 baby bundts with this recipe and baked until a toothpick came out clean - the glaze is what makes this dessert over the top and I will definitely make it again! Everyone loved it, but it's definitely got an Irish Cream kick!

Thanks Sue for the Great recipe. It was a hit with all ages youngest (7yrs) & oldest (80yrs) alike. Asked to bring it to all our future get togethers. I made a couple of changes-decreased Irish Cream Liquer to 1/2c and added 1/4c Baileys Coffee Creamer, didn't use the pecans because of possible allergies.

this cake is amazing, follow directions and you wont be disappointed. The only thing i did different was adjust the glaze. Only because i want a lot of it. I applied the glaze on the bottom while it was still in the pan, but then i added a lil more baileys to the remaining glaze and powdered sugar. If i didnt make the change the cake would still be 5 stars. Great cake

one of the best cakes I've ever made!  Even my finicky relatives at a family reunion loved it!  Took the advice of another reviewer and removed cooled cake from pan, poured in glaze and returned cake to pan so glaze would soak in.  Works like a charm!  Don't change anything else in recipe.

A very easy, tasty cake recipe.  I followed some reviews by halving the the glaze recipe and I think it worked out well.  My glaze turned out kind of thick, and didn't soak in as much as I thought it would.  But it dripped nicely down the cake, and tasted great.  Consensus was the cake tasted better the next day or even the day after that - the flavors seemed stronger.  Would definitely make again - thanks again!

I'm giving this a 4 for taste - it was delicious. However, the glaze seemed to be a little too much and when I tried to move the cake onto a serving dish (I probably should have left it alone) it fell apart. Poor execution on my part but I made this for a St. Patty's celebration and everyone loved it despite it's appearance. One note, the Irish Creme isn't cheap so if cost is an issue, make sure this is the cake you want to make.

Made this recipe with a Pillsbury pudding in the mix cake on top of the dry pudding and made everything else as the directions called for. It was FABULOUS! Use it for a bundt cake competition at work and needless to say I won!! Will definitely be making this again and may add some more pecans next time (we love nuts). Can't wait to try these as cupcakes too or in a mini-bundt pan. Delish!

Simply wow.  This might just have become my favorite dessert.  We used St. Brendan's Irish Cream and the finished product was definitely one of the best cakes that I have ever had.

Delectable!   I followed the recipe as written; however, in my opinion, there was twice as much glaze as needed for one cake.  I solved it by making a second cake and using half on that!  LOL.

This cake was absolutely delish!!! I made it for our St. Patty's day dessert. The only problem is I can't stop eating it...lol! Just make sure you don't use a small sauce pan to make the glaze. I made that mistake and it boiled over. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe! I will definitely be making this again :). It was moist and scrumptious!!!

Well, I am now on to making my second version of this cake - I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and removed the cake from the bunt pan to pour the glaze in and then put the cake back in - the problem I had was that the cake broke on the way out - so if you do this make sure the cake is totally cooled!  I had another box of cake mix so now I decided to make it into a layer cake for St Pattys day- the other cake (broken version) did taste great, but this time around I'm going to leave off the pecans, I don't think you need them - there is so much flavor with the irish cream, the nuts are a bit too much in my opinion.

One of our favorite desserts...  especially around St Patrick's Day!  We've taken this to several parties and it's always a huge hit.  My husband is usually the one that makes it and has switched it up a bit by replacing the water with Jameson...  Either way, it's absolutely delicious!!!

This was really good...made this for a St. Patty's party. I followed the recipe and didn't make any changes. Turned out great! I especially love the pecans in this cake. I used Bailey's (a little pricey) but I think next time I will try a cheaper Irish Cream and see how it turns out.

Exellent - very moist. Took it to a function without trying first. Huge hit. The only thing I didn't do was I left out the nuts.

Delicious but sits in your stomach like a brick.  Cut down on the "frosting" - you definitely don't need a cube of butter!

We have fundraisers in our office for Relay for Life with volunteer chefs.  Today was my day and made this cake to go along with the corned beef and cabbage.  Everyone raved about the cake and most all had 2 servings.  Needless to say the recipe has been requested by many and will be added to my recipe box...the most frequent words I heard was "to die for"....

This is a great bundt cake.  Not the fanciest looking but great tasting.  The tip to poke the cake with chop sticks before icing is excellent.  Next time I would probably poke the cake with something smaller for reasons of appearace.

great texture, delicious flavor.  Important to beat the full 5 minutes.  I greased the bundt pan with butter, then dusted with flour.  Pecans really make this cake outstanding!  I used brown and white sugar in the glaze (2/3-1/3) plus a pinch of salt while cooking it.  Flavor went well with the Bailey's.  The warm glaze soaked into the cake well.  Any "extra" around the edges, I picked up with an off-set spatula and frosted the top as the cake cooled completely, about 15 minutes or so.

Everyone loved this CAKE!!!! One of my closest friends told me I must have had her grandma tucked in my kitchen cabinets it was so good!!! Did recipe as is, PERFECT!!! Plus I noticed if you let glaze cool a bit, it thickens, and holds to the cake a lot better:-) Oh yeah!!!!

AMAZING!!! You have got to make this cake. Super easy! I have made it 3 times in the past week because all of my friends and coworkers keep asking for more!!! The only thing I would suggest is that you make sure to poke many deep holes so that the glaze soaks completely into to cake!!!

Very delicious.  Used Godiva white chocolate liquer instead of Baileys.  Used sliced almonds for the nuts.  Sweet, but not too much.  Very moist.  Would definitely make it again.

Oh My! This cake was fabulous!! One thing I had to change. My bottle of irish cream was questionable so I used Kahlua in it's place. Everything else, as written. All of my guests raved over how moist and delicious this cake was. Will for sure be something I will make anytime we are having company.

I made this cake for my sister's 21st birthday. I am still getting raves about it! I didn't use nuts. I used the suggesting about poking holes in the cake and replacing it in the pan which made the cake really moist. I also used Kahlua in the cake along with the Baileys and I sprayed the cake heavily with Kahlua before I put on the glaze. One last thing, I added a drizzle with powdered sugar, Kahlua, and milk.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! Clearly more of an adult recipe, due to the irish cream. Some reviewers didn't seem to think the irish cream flavor was strong enough, so I didn't think twice about adding it the first time I made it. However, to my taste, it was quite strong. I like the flavor, so it didn't bother me, but just a warning, how strong the irish cream flavor tastes is definitely a matter of individual preference/taste, so add less and taste, you can always add more. That said, this cake is very moist and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious. One small serving is enough as it is very rich...it gets a YUM rating from me!

This is my favorite bundt cake recipe - SOOOO delicious!  Slivered almonds also look very pretty (we're not pecan-eaters).  I follow the directions for glazing, and end up with about half the glaze left over.  I use the extra glaze to drizzle on top of each piece when serving.  I've served vanilla ice cream alongside this cake with the glaze on top of the ice cream as well - just like a heavenly caramel sundae!

This was really good! I served it for St Patty's day and they whole thing was devoured. I added chocolate chips to the batter and omiited the nuts. Let the cake sit covered overnight to soak in the glaze and then glazed it again with a chocolate glaze made with three parts chocolate chips and 1 part heated milk, mixed well.

This cake is incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly and served it on St. Patrick's Day. It was a huge hit.  I will make this year-round.  One tip:  Save some of the glaze to drizzle on individual cake pieces when serving.  It makes it extra special :)

Excellent cake. Very easy to make vegan. I've found that boiling the glaze for 5 minutes creates a much thicker glaze that is harder to work with. I boiled mine for about 2 minutes and added 1 tbsp of soymilk. It came out great!

I got rave reviews on this cake from my family and friends. It was so moist and creamy. I used a tip from another allrecipe.com user suggesting putting 2/3 of the glaze back in the bundt pan and then putting the cake back in the pan. This trick worked great! Glaze came out even and looked really nice. I followed recipe exactly but did not include any nuts. I plan on making this cake again. It is a great St. Patrick's Day tradition I plan on continuing.

This is a wonderful cake!! If you have'nt tried it yet, DON'T CHANGE A THING!! It's awesome as is. I never rate recipes but with this cake, I had to. It's very moist and tender. The fact that you use a mix as a base ( for lack of a better word) makes it that much easier. Give it a try!! If I could give it more stars, I would.

I made this cake for a small family dinner.  My niece's husband said it was "off the chain".  There were no leftovers.    It was so yummy and easy! I poked the holes in the cake and took time to spoon the glaze over and over the cake until it was all on it. I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla in the glaze because I like it. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the cake is so moist.

Awesome!  Made for a New Year's party and it was a huge hit!  I made a double batch and only used pecans on one for our non-nut fans.  They both dropped out fine after greasing and flouring.  I did follow RBFOUR's advice regarding the glaze but it was still wayyy to runny and unabsorbed.  Next time (this weekend) I'm going to lessen the liquid for the glaze and let the cake & glaze cool longer.  Otherwise it's a stickey goey (delicious) mess all over your cake stand - overflowing off the edges!  I'll give you an update if it's less runny next time:)

UPDATE: Tried several things with the glaze and still haven't found a perfect match.  It was still quite runny with much less water and way to lumpy to be very pretty.  I took a 2nd shot @ it with confectioners sugar and it did improve but not the glossy look I was aiming for.  Although sifting might help I think I will just use a can of choc. frosting next time and melt/pour to simplify and make it prettier?
*Always delicious though - a couple extra pecans on the outside jazz it up and it is a party favorite!

This was pretty good!  I'll admit that I'm more of a cook than a baker, but this seemed so easy that I tried it for new years eve and brought it to a party.  I stayed true to the recipe except leaving out the water and replacing it with irish cream like other reviewers recommended.   If I make it again I would let the cake cool completely and even let the glaze cool off a bit before brushing it on the cake because it soaked it up when I put warm glaze on slightly warm cake rather than turn into a crunchy glaze.  Still tasted great, but the pics with the whitish glaze looked so good!

Great. Moist. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used an oblong one. Baked for 35 minutes. Makes plenty of glaze. If you love Bailey's, you will adore this cake.

This was a hit with all my family members (young and old) at our Thanksgiving dinner! Next time, I would reduce the Irish cream liqueur in the batter to 1/2 cup and add some heavy cream. I went ahead and only used 1/8 of a cup of Irish cream liqueur in the icing. Overall, it was very light and moist.

Liked this recipe however, made the following modifications. I used the darkest chocolate cake I could find. Soo Good!  However, the glaze was a little too grainy. Would reduce the amount of sugar but 1/4 cup and increase the irish creme to 1/3 cup next time.

Wow, this is a great tasting cake, and easy, too!  I couldn't taste any of the alcohol in the cake, but could taste it in the glaze.  It was not too strong, though.  I think just a white glaze without the Irish cream would be good as well.  My cake only took 55 mins.  I would make this again.

I used French Vanilla cake mix and French Vanilla pudding, since that's what I had. This cake was even better the second and third day! Next time will use about half of the glaze, though, seemed a bit too much.

Have made this cake often. Followed the directions and it was perfect. Don't have to use just Baileys as any Irish Cream will do. Everyone raves and even had mother-in-law request it for her birthday!!

What an awesome cake!  I followed other reader's advice and let the cake cool for 10 minutes in the pan, 20 minutes out of the pan, put the glaze in the pan and then returned the cake back into the pan for 20 minutes before removing and serving.  Everyone raved about this cake!!! I can't tell you just how yummy it is!  I will make this again and again.  Thank you!

Very tasty! I used a white cake mix, french vanilla, and vanilla pudding (not instant). The only thing I wish I had done differently is poke the holes a bit deeper so the glaze could soak further into the cake. I followed another user's idea and poured the glaze into the bundt pan and put the cake back in there for about 20 minutes. Awesome flavor!

This is the second time that I made this for my 'family' at work.  This time, I didn't have enough Irish Cream so, I used half Irish Cream and half Kaluha.  I had gotten raves before and I got raves again! I loved it and so did my co-workers.  They said it really helped them get through the overnight inventory...hopefully all the counts are OK! Thanks again for the awesome recipe!

I have never given a 5star ... but this recipe totally deserves it! I am not an Irish Cream fan, but this cake was amazing! Light, sweet, and intensely flavoured - you just can't go wrong with this beauty! Thanks so much to the author for submitting it.

The recipe is perfect as it's listed.  The second time I made this cake, though, I added a handful of white chocolate chips with the pecans.  This makes the cake even better.

I wanted to make an easy dessert to bring over to my in-laws' house for Easter dinner. This recipe really fit the bill - it was really rich and tasty, and everyone loved it! I'll definitely be making it again! I just drizzled the glaze over the top after poking holes in the cake - it was too sticky to brush on. Yum!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Need to figure out how to get the glaze less "grainy."  Next time try with chocolate pudding and mint chocolate Baileys.  Great Cake!

UPDATE (ST. PADDY'S DAY 2010): MADE THIS EXACTLY AS LAST TIME, BUT FOR MY (NOW) FIANCE'S OFFICE COLLEAGUES. NOT A SINGLE CRUMB LEFT. MY MIL "TO BE" REQUESTTED THAT I MAKE THIS FOR EASTER! St. Paddy's Day 2009: OMG!!!! OMG!!!! This is incredible!!! Made a batch of mint brownies for St. Paddy's Day and was very disappointed with the end result. I was still craving something "minty" and came across this recipe. What is better than Bailey's Irish cream on St. Paddy's Day (or in my case, a few days after the fact...)?!??!? My bf didn't care for this, but he doesn't like Baileys (I've declared that he is just plain wierd - haha!). I made this in my new Williams-Sonoma heritage bundt pan. I wish I would have taken a picture before we cut into it :) My only change to this recipe was to add about a cup of mini chocolate chips that I wanted to clear out of my cupboard. Next time, I think I'll prepare this in my regular stoneware bundt pan and in place of the nuts called for, add regular sized chocolate chips on the top of the cake (bottom of bundt pan) as Eagle A did. I will also pour a bit of the glaze over the top and brush the rest on as directed (this time, to preserve the pretty shape of my cake, I just brushed it on... which worked GREAT and made for a very nice presentation!). Served generous slices with some Baileys to wash it down :) Thanks SOOO much for sharing such a WONDERFUL recipe. I will be making this for St. Paddy's Day and at Christmastime from now on!

Excellent recipe!!  I took the suggestion of using chocolate pudding.  I made mine in mini bundt pans so that I could share with neighbors, otherwise I would have eaten it all!! :-)

I made this for our St. Patrick's Day dinner and WOW this is good.  I do not like "liquer-y" tasting things but I have to admit this was good and did not have a strong alcohol flavor.  It tasted more like a rich butter pecan flavor.  The cake was very moist.  It got rave reviews from the adults at supper.

I read quite a few reviews and went with the chocolate cake mix and vanilla pudding.  Used an infuser to get right into the cake with the glaze.  There were only 3 people eating it and it was half gone in a day.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

For more of a kick, increase the Bailey's in the glaze.  After turning the cake out of the pan, clean the pan, put the cake back into the pan (upside down, reverse of how you removed it from the pan).  With a skewer, poke holes in the cake and then pour the glaze over the top.  The glaze will seep into the cake.  To remove the cake from the pan the second time, float the pan in a sink of warm water, being careful not to let water enter the pan.

A party favorite wherever I go.  For the glaze I bring it just to a boil add the Irish cream and then remove from the heat.  It's a little more liquidy but seemed to keep the cake softer as more glaze absorbed into the cake.

This was a really easy cake to make. The glaze turned out well, and I just kept brushing it on. It eventually all soaked in and hardened to a nice soft glaze just like on a donut. Everyone loved it. I did not use the pecans, or any nuts. I found it did not taste too much like Bailey's, but was good just the same. I would definitely make this again simply for the ease of making it.

I loved this cake, although I made a couple small changes (chocolate pudding to give a more homemade look). I took it camping and it was gone so fast. Everyone loved it and asked for more on our next camping trip.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it is wonderful.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I end up with more glaze than needed, so I'll probably cut the glaze in half next time.

Every time that I have made this cake, people have gone nuts over it. Especially my boyfriend and his friends. I also made it and brought it to his mothers house and she (being a much better baker) was very impressed. Good recipe, I always put more Irish Cream in it because I love it!

My husband like this but I did not. It has a terrible aftertaste and I could smell the alcohol. It was just nasty to me. It really tasted like cake with syrup, that is cough syrup. But I will give it 2 stars because my hubby liked it.

Super easy and delicious! I made this for a dinner I hosted at my house and everyone had 2 pieces! I've made a similar cake for years that uses chocolate cake and coffee liquor.  Everyone including my husband said this is even better. Thank You!

EVERYONE has complemented this cake so far!!  It was requested 3 times for parties. FYI the cook n serve pudding mix works too.  I did it on accident once but came out good and tasty as usual.  Thanks again for the great recipe 
from me, and my friends and family!

I made this as written and it was good, maybe 4 1/2 stars, but I wouldn't give it 5. Maybe I was just expecting too much because of all the rave reviews.

This cake is the "winnah!" I make mine extremely moist by poking holes in the bottom with chopsticks (after it has cooled for about ten minutes) and pour some of the sauce in the holes before flipping the cake over and pouring the remaining sauce over the cake and covering it with the pecans. (Double the amount of pecans and throw some onto the sides also). Just be prepared to give out the recipes.

Ok, not great.  Seemed to get better the a couple od days later.  I used the method from a previous poster of putting the glaze in the pan and then putting the cake back in the pan.  It resulted in the top of the cake being almost soggy, and the bottom of the cake without glaze.  If I were to make this again, I will try glazing the cake directly.

Everyone raved over this cake.  The plate was scraped clean!  Personally, I thought the sauce was grainy, and I know that I made it correctly.  The sauce wants to be caramel, but has too much sugar to become smooth and ends up grainy instead.  Next time I'll make a caramel sauce and add irish cream to it.

Everyone Loved It!!!  i used a 9 by 13 pan because that was all I had, and doubled the glaze so I could pour a lil more on after I cut it.  It turned out great!!!

Wow!  This was the perfect dessert for our St Patty's day dinner.  The cake was even better the next day (but there wasn't much left over!). My husband liked it so much he asked me to make it for him for his birthday in November!

I made this cake for a coworker's birthday that happens to be on St. Patrick's Day.  What a hit!!!  Everyone in the office talked about this cake for 2 days.  My coworker liked it so well she's making it for Easter.  I took everyone's advice and put the cake back in the pan with the glaze and it worked beautifully.  No mess and no fuss.  I will definitely be making this cake more often.

Excellent Recipe!! I used the advice of poking holes in the cake pulling it out and pouring the glaze in the pan. Then placing the cake back in for 15 minutes to soak it up reserving some of the glaze to pour into the holes. It came out beautiful and there was none left!! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is great!  I used a butter cake mix and french vanilla pudding.  I did as RBFOUR suggested and poked holes in the cake, glazed it, then put it back in the pan for 20 minutes.  Once the glaze hardened it was difficult to get the cake back out of the pan.  I also will use less pecans the next time as most of them stayed in the pan.  My guests from CA had seconds!

I made this cake for the superbowl today.  It was an overwhelming crowd pleaser.  It was very easy to make.  I used all of the glaze and found it to be the perfect amount.  It only took about 15-20 minutes to glaze the cake.  Just be a little patient layering the glaze.  It did not taste like alcohol as other reviewers stated.  We will make this again!!

This was probably the best dessert I made out of all my baking for the holidays. I put in amaretto AND Baileys and used cream cheese flavored pudding. I caught people skipping plates and eating right off the plate! Delicious!

A total hit at my business potluck today! Out of all the desserts brought mine was the only one to have only crumbs left at the end of the day. For me the Bailey's taste was a little strong, but if you like rum cake you will love this!

I made this for a small gathering of friends and everyone loved it.  Took the rest to work and it lasted about 5 min!!  I was asked for the recipe from almost everyone who tried it.  I used a cup of Baileys in the batter, and a little extra in the glaze.  I also used brown sugar for the glaze, but will try half brown/white or all white sugar next time since the final cake was very tan in color.  I did sprinkle some finely chopped pecans in the bottom of the bundt pan first.  Most of the nuts were grinded up with brown sugar and cinnamon and layered in the cake instead. It made it look prettier.  To put the glaze on, I used chopsticks to poke some holes, and poured about 1/3 glaze in the cake and around sides.  After the cake cooled a bit and was out of the pan, I used a syringe to "inject" the rest of the glaze throughout the cake. This method was really easy, efficient, and fast. This cake really does taste yummy!  Especially if you sip some Baileys while enjoying it.  And if you can let it sit for a couple days, it tastes even better!!  I may add some Kahula next time and maybe butterscotch pudding to compare.  Definitely try this cake, but make sure to use all the glaze if you can!!

Very good.  It was rich and I couldn't wait for it to cool before sinking my teeth into it.  Can't wait to try it again tomorrow just to see if the glaze has sunk in more.  I wish I'd read the review about putting some of the glaze in the pan after cake was out and then putting cake back in before making it.  Sounds messy but what is a little more mess when the kitchen is already a wrack?  Thanks!

This cake was really good.  However there wasn't a real distinct flavor of coffee.  I did however save the recipe by adding a concentrated coffee mixture to the batter. YUM.

Very good flavor. Very moist and rich.  I wish it didnt taste so much like a cake mix though. I may try it again with a different mixture of cake and pudding. I mixed the nuts in the batter.

Love this cake! Have made it several times and everyone raves. I only make half the glaze as the first time I made it, most of it ended up on the plate instead of on the cake.

This is an amazing and simple recipe. The first time I ever made it I entered it in a baking competition and won second place! Booze and sugar are a winning combo! Perfect amount of sweet for me. Thanks so much

Very rich.  I used extra Irish Cream in the glaze so that I could empty the bottle.  Based on other reviews, I put the cake back into the pan and poured 2/3 of the hot glaze on it and let sit about 10 or 15 minutes.  Then I flipped it onto a plate and carefully topped with the rest of the glaze.

Really very good.  It had a great nutty flavor.  I omitted the nuts.  I omitted the Irish Cream glaze, instead opting for a bit of melted, store-bought, vanilla icing which complimented the nutty flavor well.  I drizzled that over the top of the cake. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.

Simply divine!!!!  After reading all of the wonderful reviews, I had very high expectations about how good this cake would be. It is fantastic.  Be careful with the glaze...boil in on med-high heat.  Otherwise it will get too thick to handle.  I used Feeney's Irish cream, it is just as good (or better) than Baileys but way less expensive.  Anyone looking for a great cake, especially to "wow" guests, this is the one!!

WOW.  SO good, and so easy.  as suggested by other reviewers, I used chocolate pudding and added a little whiskey to the cake mix.  It was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely make it again.

This cake is FABULOUS.  I toasted my pecans and cooled them before adding them to the mini bundt pans.  I chose mini, so that I could take them to the teachers at my daughter's school.  They are light, have a wonderful taste and everyone loved them and even asked for the recipe. This one is a keeper!

We just had a potluck at work and this got great reviews!  My family, including 2 and 11 year old boys, loved it.  I made one with vanilla pudding mix, and one with chocolate pudding mix.  In both, I used a whole cup of Irish cream.  Pecans were a must.  Not only did poking holes in the top help with the glaze, but my husband suggested injecting some of the glaze into the cake.  That worked too.  I'll definitely make this again.

Absolutely wonderful! Rave reviews from everyone when I make this. Tips:
1. I use less pecans, about 1/2 cup, and that works fine;
2. I use 1 cup of Irish Cream liquor for the cake and cut out the water. 
3. Instant pudding mix makes the batter almost sludge-like, but it bakes up just fine;
4. The glaze absolutely requires a brush for application, because if you spoon it on it goes everywhere AND the cake which is no fun for clean up!

I give this recipe a totally RAVE review!

i omited the pecans because i didn't have any. i also reduced the glaze by about half. that was more than enough. otherwise i followed the recipe to the letter. i recommend you change the name however. it should be called the 24 hr. cake because that as long as it lasted. making another one, this time with chocolate liqueur, choclate cake & pudding mix.

My husband says "give it a 5-star rating only because there isn't a 6-star rating!" I followed the recipe and used the glazing tips of other reviewers. I added the glaze while the cake was still in the pan; turned it out on a cake plate and added more glaze. Super good.

This is a fab recipe! I didn't use the nuts, but other than that, I followed it to a "T". I've found that it's much more flavorful if you let it sit overnight (covered, of course), and glaze it a few hours before serving. If you're having trouble with the glaze being grainy, just cook the glaze a bit longer, and it'll smooth out.

This one is a keeper!  The cake is moist and delicious even days after you originally make it.  The recipe did produce extra glaze, so you may want to reduce by 1/3 or so.

Wonderful receipe! Made per receipe. Would not change a thing. It is a very moist and a beautiful cake. I have a beautiful bundt pan so I put the pecans in the middle of the batter so it would not ruin the straight lines of my pan. Thank you for the receipe. I have passed it on to many others.

Fantastic!  I made it yesterday, and between my fiance and I, it's almost gone a day later.  It's a great alternative to a rum bundt cake.  I really prefer the taste of Irish liqueur over rum, so this was perfect!

Fabulous recipe. I usually bake in a castle shaped bundt pan and only use half the amount of glaze recommended. Let sit overnight before service to allow glaze a chance to soak in.

I have to make this cake for my mother's church group every March for the past 4 years - they LOVE it.  They like it at work too, strangely enough even though I like irish cream - I don't care for the cake, BUT I seem to be the only one.  Making it from a cake mix helps a lot.

I made this tonight for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I just used an angel food cake pan and it turned out fine. The glaze will thinkin as it sits on the cake. It's a keeper!

Everybody loved it, but I think next time I'll bake it for only about 50 minutes and boil the glaze for about 2-3 minutes. My glaze was turning to candy at 5 minutes. Very tasty, but not very pretty. Oh, and I mixed the nuts into the batter, which turned out great.

My sister-in-law made this one year for a Christmas dessert and I loved it. She sent me the recipe and I have been making it ever since. It's very moist, easy to make and everyone loves it.

This was delicious. I made this for a Christmas dessert party and it won the most overall votes for the night. :) It was gone in 3 hours! It was very moist and extremely easy.

This was a good cake. Not amazing, or earth-shattering, but a good cake. There were leftovers in the office, which never happened after the "better-than-sex cake". I guess I'll stick with ooey-gooey cakes for my co-workers!

This bundt was not only easy to make, but it was FABULOUS!!!!  This is the best bundt cake recipe I have ever tasted.  Needless to say my guests and my family loved it!  

I suggest making extra glaze to pour over individual slices.  I baked mine for a few extra minutes to give a nice crust, the middle stayed just as moist (just to appease my husband's personal preference).  I used walnuts instead of pecans (because that's all I had in the pantry) and that came out just as tasty.

Note the recipe calls for 1/2 cup butter but appears to use 1/4 cup. Is there an error or am I missing something?

OOPS! Just re-read the recipe. My eyes playing tricks. Recipe is correct. Sorry.

my family isn't really big on cakes but i thought that i would give this a try anyway. i took some advice and made only half of the glaze which i thought was plenty. at first i was a little disappointed in the cake, i guess i was expecting something unearthly but that didn't stop me from having 2 slices. went away for an hour or two and over half the cake was gone, next day it vanished. even my mom liked it and she hardly ever has anything nice to say about stuff i make. this was super easy to make and i know i'll definitely be making it again.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day party, and at the end of the night I had a few dozen requests for the recipes, plenty of compliments, an empty cake platter, and even a marriage proposal from someone I didn't know.... all for the cake!

Wonderful cake although I made a few changes. I put the liquor and two tablespoons of instant coffee into my mixer and then proceeded with the rest of the ingredients. I then removed 2/3 cup of the batter and mixed that with 1/3 cup melted chocolate chips and set aside. I placed half of the batter into my pan and layered half of my chocolate batter on top with a sprinkling of a cinnamon/sugar mixture. I repeated the layers and then took a knife to gently swirl the batters. Once the cake was baked and cooled, I microwaved a container of ready made chocolate frosting for twenty seconds and poured it over the cake. I then sparingly drizzled warmed fudge sauce over that. While the cake was baking, I melted chocolate and thinly spread it onto a cookie sheet and placed in the fridge. Once cooled, I make chocolate curls and decorated the top of the cake. Because I didn't have a bundt pan, I used a tube pan and filled the center with halved strawberries. I took this to a dinner party and everyone said it looked like it had come from a bakery. Fantastic recipe Sue and thanks a bunch!

I thought this was a wonderful cake considering I'm not a big fan of Irish Cream.  I had made a batch of "Original Irish Cream" from this site for a gift and didn't know what to do w/ the leftover liquer.  I followed the recipe as written except 1/2 c of nuts.  I brushed on the glaze w/ a pastry brush which worked well as it thickened (I didn't think there was too much).  The glaze hardened nicely and the cake had a subtle Irish cream flavor.  The kids loved it and I had to package the leftovers up and give away so I wouldn't eat the whole thing!

I made it without the pecans (didn't have time to go to the store) and it was fabulous.  I'll bet it's even better with the pecans.

Great! Great! Great! My family and friends cannot stop raving about this cake.  Instead of using the glaze in the recipe I used 1 cup of icing sugar, 1 tablespoon of butter, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and enough Irish cream to obtain a consistency great for drizzling over the top.

I made this cake for work for St. Patty's Day and for the last 2 days I have been getting the best reviews from everybody.  I am making another one tonight for a fund raiser at my husband's work for tomorrow and it was requested again for next week for a birthday at work.  It's a true keeper.

Just baked this cake last night for St. Patrick's Day. It came out perfect, following the recipe as written. I did reduce the amount of water in the glaze by about 1 Tbl., and made sure to boil the glaze for the full 5 minutes to insure a smooth consistency. Also, by letting the glaze cool to almost room temp., stirring regularly, you will have a thicker, easier to control consistency. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Great recipe!  I've made it twice, once using the "soak in the pan" idea from previous reviews.  The second time I just poured the glaze over the top, following the recipe exactly & it turned out just as good, if not better - and it was much easier.  It hardened up pretty well, and everyone loved it.  Using a pastry brush to brush the glaze on the sides seems to yield the same result/thickness of the glaze.  I also used brown sugar, and both times only used about 1/2... so next time I'd only make 1/2 - 3/4 the amount of glaze as indicated in the recipe.

This was a very tasty moist cake. I halved the ingredients for the glaze and it was just the right amount. I also used brown sugar instead of white for the glaze. My co-workers ate this up ( but they'll eat anything ) I thought this tasted good, but something was just not 5 star. I can't put my finger on it.. maybe I should've used white sugar, maybe another liquor.. not sure. I will experiement with this as it is a good recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe for the holidays or a party.  Very moist and keeps moist for a very long time.  I halved the glaze recipe and found it was enough to cover the whole cake.  I followed the recipe for glazing the cake and it turns out great every time.

Very easy and tasty.  I took the advice of others and put the glaze back in the pan and put the cake back in to soak it up, but had a bit of a time getting the cake back out again.  At that, I would just pour the glaze on top next time.

MMM mm MM MM Mmmmmmm!!!! This was amazing! I love to bake, but am trying to lose weight, so everyone at work LOVED it! I don't care much for nuts, but the pecans where the best part - well besides the Irish cream. I use Emmets instead of Bailey's - less of an alcohol kick.

This cake is fabulous!  Two little notes:  when you purchase shelled pecans, be sure to dig out the hard part where it was attached to the shell.
If you don't, sometimes you get a piece of hard shell in the topping.  Ick.  Also, I halved the glaze recipe, as even half was more than the cake needs.  But it was outstanding & I have made it twice already.

Great success!  Everyone loved it (except the kids - they could taste the liquor).  A couple of suggestions : I omitted the liquor in the glaze and used brown sugar instead of white, in addition, I used sugar-free pudding mix (helped to cut down on the overall sweetness) and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I've made this recipe twice with great feedback!  Thanks!!

I made this cake for dessert and my family loved it.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  The flavor of the Irish cream in the cake itself isn't overwhelming.  

I did find that about half the glaze would have been enough.

Family loves this cake. I make it every St Patrick's day. Because my kids were little when I started making it I used Bailey's coffee creamer instead of the alcohol. Turns out great and the kiddies don't have to be exposed to the alcohol  It's also cheaper and the leftovers can be used in your coffee!

It smells delicious.  I took advice one of the reviews and did 1 cup of liqueur and skipped the 1/4 cup of water in the cake recipe.  The glaze turned out amazing, the key is to start glazing right away as soon as glaze comes off stove while it’s still thin and then add more as it thickens.  Had some left over so saved it in a jar for ice cream topping it is such a good caramel! Cake was very easy to make and can’t wait for holiday guests to try it...added a little holiday flair to top!

Cannabis infused vegetable oil for the bundt cake and cannabis infused butter for the glaze.

I substituted the Irish Cream Liqueur with melted Baileys Irish Cream baking chips in the cake and the glaze.  Ended up with a delicious chocolate cake with an almost candy chocolate glaze.

I've made this about six times and it always gets great reviews. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, and the second time, thought I'd be smart and make the glaze first so it had time to cool off before I used it. Don't do this. It hardened, and while you can melt it again, probably better to just make it as the cake is cooling. 

Two helpful tips:
1. I did coat the pecans in a little flour to keep them "floating" throughout the cake batter (a little trick I learned from a master baker pal) 
2. I think it makes a LOT of glaze so I don't usually use all of it while coating. I save the excess and heat it a little and drizzle it over the next day (if there's any left over).

Watch carefully when it bakes. Mine didn’t take the whole bake time and would have burned if I had not caught it. Also, the glaze was like fudge! Very good.

I followed the advice and added the glaze to bottom of pan and waited 20 minutes. When I lifted the cake up the delicious glaze stuck to the pan, then the cake came off without the pecans or the glaze. When I took it from dish to cake dish, the bottom stuck again. You don't want to see a picture. Be careful adding that glaze. Just put it on the top while you still have a top.

I thought this cake was moist & delicious! I didn't change a thing (except adding a 1/2 shot of whiskey to the glaze at the very end, as one reviewer suggested). I did beat the batter for a full 5 minutes and it is super thick. I cooked for the full 60 minutes . The awesomeness to this recipe was the pecans & the glaze. The pecans elevated the dish and the glaze added a great flavor that was unexpected. I did poke the cake and poured the glaze in the bundt pan and put the cake back in to let it soak for about 15 minutes, and poured some glaze on the bottom while sitting in the pan. Placed it on a plate and it was beautiful. It was the best cake I have made in a really long time!

Made it with the changes suggested by Selune13, and it had a nice irish cream flavour to it.  It's tasty and uses handy shortcuts, but it's very sweet, and in the end it still tastes like  box cake mix and instant pudding mix.

Simple with really good flavor. I followed the other suggestions and soaked the cake in the pan with the glaze. I used walnuts instead of pecans as a matter of personal taste and I added a little coffee to the glaze (instead of all water) which added additional flavor. It has a lot of Bailey's taste without being too boozy.

In case the other 900+ 5 star reviews didn’t convince you-make this cake!!! So delicious! I followed the tips and put the glaze in the pan and inverted the cake back into it. Cannot express how moist and delicious it is!

It was a huge hit at our family’s St. Patrick’s Day celebration! I added the syrup after the cake came out of the oven while it was still warm and in the pan.  This allowed the syrup to be absorbed by the cake.  Moist and delicious!

I make this every year around St. Patty’s. Everyone loves it. Super easy to make. There is a lot of glaze which I use a pastry brush to brush up around the inside and all over the outer sides as well.

This is a question and comment. My family doesn't like pecans. Other than leaving nuts out, If I do use nuts, any suggestions for a substitute ?
Secondly, why do people who completely change the recipe bother writing a review ?  It is then their own recipe they are reviewing. A little tweak here and there is understandable

This was wonderful and I am NOT a baker!!  I found a pretty sunflower cake pan and wanted to use that for a party. Picture attached. ( I followed the suggested directions of the ladies who used 1/2 to 2/3s of the sauce in the bottom of the pan  after removing the cake.  Make sure you put the holes in the top of the cake before you put the cake back into the pan to soak it up.)  It was amazing.   I also used the $11 irish cream vs. the $20+ Baileys. (I added the photo twice, sorry if it doesn't upload)

This cake is amazing, I always get so many compliments from anybody who happens to snag a bite before it disappears off of my kitchen counter. I only modify this recipe a bit, by not using pecans. I also like to add large sugar crystals to the top after I add my glaze to give the cake a little texture!

First time I made this cake, I  are used Bailey’s Irish Cream as directed. The second time I made this I thought I had Irish cream… but apparently we enjoyed too much of it making the first cake. I substituted vanilla rum instead and this is now become one of our favorite cakes!  Unlike regular rum cakes; it’s not too heavy/dense and the vanilla rum enhances the flavor. I am making one of these cakes tonight but I will try the glaze techniques from the other reviews , letting it soak it all up in the pan. So excited!

My family absolutely loves this cake!  I have made it over 20 times for family , friends and co-workers.  The pecans give it that extra crunch.  I've also used the Strawberries and Cream Holiday edition Bailey's and it's a winner!

Made this for our family cabin trip.  Everyone Loved it! The kicker is I didn't even use Irish cream, however I did use Irish cream flavoring! For the cake I used yellow cake mix with pudding in it but I also used 1/2 the amount of pudding mix called for - in chocolate flavor - to give it a brownish color.  I also threw in about 1 Tbsp. baking cocoa as well.  Since I didn't put in the alcohol I used almond milk for the liquid.  In the glaze I simply added the flavoring but no extra liquid along with the other ingredients. In both the cake and glaze I used about 2 tsp. flavoring each.  Delicious! Will make again.

This is a tasty and easy to make recipe, very popular around our house. Moist and delicious! As some other reviewers suggested, I upped the Bailey's to a full cup and eliminated the water, which increases the alcohol but IMO improves the flavor.

I made this cake exactly as written, and it came out fantastic. Just an FYI , the batter is very sticky and thick, (I'm assuming this is why it needs to be beat at high for 5 mins), but the cake rises up a lot in the pan and has a very fluffy, moist texture. I did butter and flour the bundt pan, the cake popped out very easily. When I tried to poke holes in the top, it kind of just crumbled down that section, since most of the top is structurally pecans. But this isn't a bad thing, it let the glaze seep down into the cake. And it even looked great, kind of like the top of a crumb cake.

Didn't have a bunt pan where I made this recipe, so I made cupcakes instead.  Turned them upside down and put the syrup over the bottom.  I never got to try it, but the reviews were great!  I Also took the advice of a full cup of Irish creme in the batter and no water.

I make this cake every St. Patrick’s day. It never fails to be a hit. I do follow the reviews when adding the glaze by taking the cake out of the pan ,pouring 2/3 of the glaze in the bottom of the pan after poking holes in the top and sides. I replace the cake, poke holes in the bottom of the cake and add the rest of the glaze. This cake is sooo delicious!!!!

Made this exactly as the recipe directed. Ok....typical bundt cake. Almost too sweet and didn't really taste the Irish Cream too much. Probably won't be making again.

I made my own cake mix  mix, and used it instead of a commercial one. it had great taste, the liquer really comes through nicely. a hint with bundt pans is to spray them with the nonstick spray, then put in a few tablespoons of plain flour and twirl it round to coat the inside of the pan. comes out more easier than just the spray.

This is a great cake! Took the advice of other reviewers and used a cake mix without pudding already in it and used 1 cup of Irish cream. The batter seemed a little sticky once mixed, so I added about 1/4 cup of water which made it perfect. I didn’t use any nuts (allergies). I soaked the cake in the pan with the glaze and poked holes in the bottom, adding the remaining glaze to soak for 20 minutes. When I flipped it onto a plate, the glaze perfectly covered the cake, but I did transfer to a new plate once all the glaze dripped down. Everyone loved it and I will definitely make again.

I consider this a success, as when I served it to our bridge group, 2 out of 3 couples requested the recipe. As mentioned in previous reviews, I used a full cup of Irish Cream instead of 3/4 cup with 1/4 cup water, and I put the cake back in the pan with the glaze. The glaze is the most time-consuming part, but also makes it so tasty. I am not a cook--or a baker--but I'd make this again.

White  cake mix with white chocolate pudding mix helps the Irish Cream flavor shine thru. Tried the yellow cake and vanilla pudding, did not enjoy the flavor as much. But, to each his own.

Great cake!! Rave reviews from potluck dinner!! 
One change - I would apply glaze in stages. Brush over poked cake lightly, then wait a few minutes for glaze to set up a little . Continue at 5-7 minute intervals until cake absorbs all the glaze. If you apply it all in a short time, it pools on the plate and you have to pull it up with the brush to get it on the cake. Patience pays off!!

This is sooooo good. Comes out perfect. I use (1) 2oz. package of chopped pecans(which comes out to almost 2/3 cup), a 15 oz.  yellow cake mix and larger box of vanilla pudding. You could add more Irish cream to the glaze if you wanted to. Amazing, and I get so many great comments on it.

I came across this yesterday and decided to make it.  I followed the suggestion of pouring the glaze in to the pan and then putting the cake back in for 20 minutes.  But we decided to try it without pecans.

We loved it! The crunchy, but soft glaze topping made it extra delicious.  My coworkers loved it as well.  Definitely a keeper.

Awesome, made several times. I add about a 1/4 nuts to the batter and more to the bottom and side of well greased Bundt pan instead of just on top. Other than that follow the recipe and you'll have an awesome cake everyone will ask for again and again.

I make this cake in individual pans for gifts at Christmas.  I replace the veg. oil with melted butter (to make it richer in flavor) as well as replacing the water in both the batter and icing with an equal amount of Irish Cream (in addition to the original amount the recipe calls for) to give it a more pronounced Irish Cream flavor.  I usually replace the water  with milk in a box mix, but here the Irish Cream was a no brainer.  Also,  replacing melted butter for veg oil and adding an extra egg or just the yolk makes any boxed cake mix recipe taste much more "from scratch" and soooo much less like a boxed mix.   I'm always asked for the recipes, and told the cakes taste amazing, as well as homemade.

I have made this cake twice and everyone loves it!  First time I followed the recipe with the Irish creme and the second time I used Raspberry Schnapps instead and a chocolate cake with chocolate pudding.  Both are extremely moist and delicious!

Wonderful cake. Followed suggestions to soak the cake in pan, really good. The only thing I'd change is to use less pecans, I also didn't use all the glaze. Will make again!

I didn't have vanilla pudding so  I used pistachio instead.   I used almonds in place of pecans because  I didn't have pecans.  I need to go grocery shopping!  Great tasting cake.  My husband, who doesn't drink any kind of spirits loved this cake and said he really liked the "different" flavor.

The cake was phenomenal!  I did have to add a portion of  a second cake mix bc cake mix makers have changed the size of their mixes. I also added another egg and a wee bit extra Irish cream liqueur.  I used the liqueur instead of the 1/4 cup water.  Next time I will add a little bit more nuts as well.  EVERYONE said it was SO MOIST.  Warning - it is time consuming bc of the inverting & cooling times.

So perfect.  Making it again and trying with some leftover amaretto.  Perfect texture, flavor, EZ to make.  Gonna be a go to for all time.  Thinking a chocolate kahlua combo might be nice too.

Made this cake for the 1st time for  St  Patrick's day and it was awesome. I did not have vanilla instant pudding so I used French vanilla. The cake was better the next day because the glaze had time to soak in. I will be making this again.

This sounded so yummy but needed a chocolate cake plus that is all I had. So the chocolate version was a huge success! Did follow other review and turned the cake back into the pan with the glaze to absorb. Definitely is a keeper and can't  wait to make the original version. Thanks so much for sharing!

PLEASE NOTE! When mixing, batter is very thick. Kept creeping up the beaters and almost hitting the mixer itself. Had to keep shaking it down = messy. Also - I tried the trick of putting the glaze in the pan and re-inverting the cake back in. I DO NOT recommend this! I let it sit for 30 minutes and couldn't get the cake back out. The bottom ended up falling onto the plate and the top (glazed part) stuck to pan. I had to use a spatula to get it out and it was a mess. Just poke holes and use basting brush like others suggested to avoid this. CAKE TASTES AMAZING! Didn't change anything.

This cake is flavorful - but a bit dry which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  It definitely needs something to moisten it - perhaps a tad more oil.  I followed recommendations to remove the cake and add glaze to the cake pan and put cake back in with poked holes.  Unfortunately when I took the cake out of the pan later, all of the glaze was stuck in the pan along with many of the pecans that had been on the cake.  I scooped out the glaze, put it in a saucepan and stirred it at medium heat until it turned liquid again and poured it over the cake.  The nuts were mixed in with the glaze which added to the texture and made it so good!  A happy accident.  This cake tastes delicious but is definitely dry (and I baked for less time than called for).  If I make again, I will add additional oil.

This cake is moist and I will make it again. I did as mentioned by another that you pour the glaze back into the bundt pan and add back the cake for 20 min.

This is a little time-consuming at the end but it is so very worth it. It is one daughter's go-to cake for her birthday and I MUST bring at least two for work every St. Patrick's Day. It's embarrassing to see colleagues try to lick the plate.

This came out amazing!  I added the pecans to the batter instead of in the pan  as someone else  had said and sprinkled a few on top when I iced it.  Another reviewer had suggested painting the icing on with a brush and that worked very well.   This received rave reviews from family and friends and I will be making it again this weekend!

The basic recipe sounded great.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you look at it.  I didn't have the yellow cake mix or the vanilla pudding.  Instead I used a 16.5 ounce box of French vanilla cake mix and the 5.9 ounce box of chocolate pudding mix I had on hand.  I kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  There was way more glaze than there needed to be to pour over the top.  I took the extra and injected it throughout the cake.   It turned out amazing with great comments.  Can't wait to try the original recipe.

Easily made gluten free (with GF yellow cake mix).  This has become a family tradition for our very festive St. Patrick's Day parties.  People are already excited to eat it again!

Moist cake. Made it 3x already. First time I didn't adjust any measurements, followed it religiously. The glaze is too sweet for us. So the next times I made it, I only used 1/2 cup white sugar.
Also check your cake at 50 minutes, coz mine is already done by that time.
Will definitely make it again.
12/18/17 Still the most requested cake from our friends and still 'adores' everytime I make it. Today, I'm making it for a potluck at USPS OC.

This is one of my "go to" cakes for company, pot luck dinners, holidays, family gatherings, everything.  I make it just as the recipe calls and it turns out perfectly each and every time.  It is delicious.  Everyone loves it.  Once, I was distracted and accidentally put the pecans in the batter instead of in the bottom of the Bundt pan.  It still turned out great.  Thank you for such a wonderful and tasty recipe.

This is a great cake, very moist and everyone loved it!  Didn't have the Irish Cream so I used whipping cream and vanilla instead.  I know that kinda messes up the Irish part but it is all I had.  I did put some cinnamon sugar in once I had about half the batter in the pan, then used regular powdered sugar glaze with some added vanilla to complete.  Enjoyed by all!

Amazing. So delicious.  My friends still bring it up regularly....even in random moments.  Have now made a few times (in less than 6 months!)  at their request. Will definitely be in the loop for colder months.  I followed suggestion of making some holes to pour in glaze (almost like tres leches) - made nice and dense. Definitely recommend.

Probably the best cake ever!  Thanks for sharing.  This one is beyond good!  I am making this for the second time .  This is the best cake ever.  My husband took first one to work and they could not rave over it enough.  Gave one to the priest's and they loved it!  Ignore anything less than a 5 star rating.  It is that good.

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day party that I serve all Irish food. The cake was supremely moist and stayed that way for a few days. I did not make the frosting however I made the cake exactly as directed. The only reason any was left over was because I forgot to label the cake on the table. Once I labeled it halfway through the party it started to go quickly. Luckily I had a small amount left because it goes excellent with coffee. This recipe is a perfect brunch/coffee cake recipe. I may even try it with Kahlúa sometime. The texture is slightly fluffier than a pound cake.

So moist.  Every tasty.  Big hit every time it's made.  It has become my "goto" recipe.  
Hint with the glaze to keep from getting gritty - add 1 teaspoon Cream of Tartar.  Keep heat low to just barely boiling.  Makes glaze very creamy.

I have to give this five stars simply because of how easy and presentable the cake is. Prep for both the cake and glaze took about 12 minutes total and it's just beautiful; perfect for showing off or giving as a gift. As for taste, it's delicious, but the boxed yellow cake flavor really stands out. I think next time I might opt for a homemade cake recipe, but that's just my preference. Maybe I just need to find a better boxed brand or experiment with a different flavor.

I took the advice of the several of the other reviewers and used the full cup of Irish Cream, leaving out the 1/4 cup of water. It is wonderful. I will certainly make this again.

OMG this is absolutely delicious.  I took others advice and eliminated the water and added additional Irish Cream.   I also did as other, put 2/3 of the glaze in the pan and put the cake back in (after punching lots of holes), punched more holes in the bottom and poured the rest of the glaze over that.   Let it sit for about an hour, turned it over in a plated (Had to tap the bottom of the pan a bit).    Delicious, Delicious, Delicious

Very good!  Tip about putting it back in the pan to soak was great idea but it only took my cake 10 mins to soak all the glaze.  I changed nothing and it was perfect.  Thanks for a good one.

This cake was a big hit on New Year's. I was out of pecans so I skipped them, and used olive oil, and it tasted great. I would make a half recipe of the glaze next time, it was too much.  I can't wait to make it again for another event.

I made this for my husband for his birthday.  He said it's the best cake I have ever made him!  I can't have it, but I did try a bit of the "sauce" and it was awesome!  I have to make it again today for him.  It's a keeper!  Thank you!

Amazing as is!! The topping makes this cake! Just make sure to take the cake out of pan, then pour the sauce in the bottom of the empty pan after cooking and replace cake, then poke holes in the bottom of the cake and pour over as well. Amazing!!

Awesome Cake!!! I have made it more than 5 times and it comes out beautiful each time. I do use a whole cup of Rum Chata (a sweet creamy white Caribbean rum) instead of Baileys. I pour the glaze into the pan and soak the cake in it. This cake disappears every time! Thank you for helping me look like a genius! ;-)

This is the best bundt cake recipe ever.  I was looking for a bundt recipe for my new bundt pan.  I came across this and decided to give it a try.  The aroma was awesome.  This will be the recipe I will use for gifting to neighbors for the holidays.  The texture is similar to that of a cake donut.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

I'm an avid home baker, baking/designing around a dozen wedding cakes a year, plus special occasions, and I had someone request an Irish Cream cake, which wasn't on my current flavor list. I did a test bake with this cake today and OH MY! It rose so much higher than I thought it would, being in round pans not a bundt pan, and it turned out absolutely beautiful! It tasted amazing too! I used two 6" cake pans to test, but I'm certain it would perfectly fill two 8" pans after baking. I didn't add pecans, due to request, but I bet the pecans add an extra touch and may remake it with those for my next family event. Thanks for this recipe!

I made this cake tonight and it was delicious!  Everyone in the family loved it, even the ones that don't usually prefer yellow cake.  I will keep this recipe on hand and will plan to make many more times!  Thank you for sharing!

I have made this several times.  People always ask for it.  I make the cake as directed then pour the glaze back in the bundt pan and carefully put the cake back in the pan.  Let the glaze soak in until cool.  Dump out on cake platter and cut in pieces.

What I liked most about this bundt cake is that it completely filled up the pan, often I make bundt cakes and they're about 3.5-4 inches tall, but this was at least 4.5-5 inches tall!  It was big and lovely!  I would recommended getting the glaze on top AND bottom because the slices are so big you will want it evenly distributed for taste.

The cake was very good, though next time I might take it out of the oven a bit sooner.  The glaze would not thicken and remained the consistency of water, possibly due to the fact that I used raw sugar.  I used a mixture of water and red sherry instead of the Irish cream.  Not my most successful cake.

I read on one review that this cake was boozy, so (by mistake) i did the glaze mixing all three ingredients at once then boiling. And, I don't like pecans, and I used almonds. Everyone loved it! Only thing that would have made it better, a cup of coffee.

This turned out really well. It was easy to make and got rave reviews. I did follow instructions from reviewers to put icing in the bottom of the Bundt pan and then the rest on the top (bottom of the cake). I only had butterscotch pudding and that worked fine. I will definitely make this one again!

I thought it was just okay. The idea of putting the glaze in the pan that was suggested by others was brilliant. I will use that idea with other recipes. This recipe would be fine for a quick and easy dessert for the family. I would not make it to take anywhere for a special occasion.

I made this last weekend and we ate the entire thing!  It was so light and delicious.  I made the scratch yellow cake mix from allrecipes and used it as I don't buy cake mixes, to many additives.  None the less the cake was delicious and I didn't change a thing.  The yellow cake mix recipe made twice as much as needed so I have another mix to make this cake again for Christmas.  MmmmMmmm

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I found the cake to be light and moist with just the right hint of the Irish Cream. I would certainly make this recipe again.  Our dinner guests loved it as did my husband's fellow teachers when he brought in the leftovers (had to get the temptation out of the house).

My MIL makes this on a regular basis. I decided to try it myself and found this recipe. It turned out perfectly using the recipe and also using the 'glaze in pan' idea of the reviewers. 

I also added "coffee" extract (in addition to the Bailey's) to both glaze and cake, which gave a richer flavor. 

A family favorite, I will make again and again!

I made the recipe using all of the same ingredients but I used a little less Bailey's in the glaze.  When I made the glaze I put the Irish cream in and I didn't immediately take it off the stove.  I have an electric oven so I just turned it off and left the pot on the stove and kept stirring it for another minute or two to cook off any alcohol taste.
The cake turned out super moist and I received rave reviews from the BBQ I had taken it to.  I will make it again.

This was an unusual cake.  It was moist.  I didn't care for the frosting/glaze too much.  I think that would be the only item I would change.

Followed recipe and suggestion of another reviewer to return cake into form with glaze and let it sit, brushed on reminding gaze after.
I do suggest to leave plenty of time for t to cool. It tastes so much better and also the glaze will be dry.
Everyone loved it at the party. And I took some leftovers to family the next day. It is all gone! And I have been asked for the recipe numerous times!
This one is a keeper for sure!!!

Followed the recipe exactly, tasted the batter and added another splash of Baileys.  Next time, I will plan on adding 1 Cup of it to begin with.  I used an angel food cake pan because I did not have a bunt pan and it worked just as well.  1 Cup of pecans seemed like a lot, but it was perfect.  I had a little trouble with the glaze.  It hardened before I could put it on the cake.  Next time, I will have the cake out of the pan and immediately poor the glaze on it.  Will definitely make this recipe again!  YUM

TASTES GREAT but my cake broke in half.  I follwed everyone's rec ommendations about pouring the glaze into the pan and returning the cake to the pan to let it soak up the glaze.  My problems began when I tried to turn the glazed cake back out of the pan onto a servng plate.  The cake broke in half horizontally and it almost seemed as though the top half of the cake was glued into the pan by the sticky glaze.  Eventually, I got the top half out and patched it together as best I could. Needless to say the presentation was terrible but tI served it anyway and the taste was PHENOMENAL!!  I will definitely make this cake again (I followed the recipe exactly) but will glaze it the traditional way.  I am stll giving this cake 5 stars because it tastes so good.

Really like this recipe.  Follow the recipe exactly and then soaked the cake upside down like a reviewer suggested.  It was a big hit with my family at Christmas.

Terrific! This recipe is definitely going in my folder of favorite recipes. It was easy and delicious. The only changes I made were I used an angel food pan because I don't have a bundt pan and I forgot to flour the pan after spraying. Also, in my different pan I probably got a tad over done at 55 mins. of baking but still turned out great.
From this day forward I will always keep on hand Irish Cream, yellow cake mix and pudding so I can make this cake at a moments notice.

I made my first bundt cake last week useing this recipe and i made it again yesterday. We are just waiting to start eatting it. I read that when you make a dessert like cake, cookies and other goodies with liquor, you should let it sit for about 2-3 days  so the flavors all come turn out that much yummier.
Thanks for sharing your recipe.

P.S  my son took half to work to share with his co-workers (concrete guys) and they love it and want more.
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

This is amazing.  I'm relatively new to baking and I had no problems with it.  I followed suggestions to add 1/2 shot whisky to the glaze, and it was very good.  I will definitely make this again.

could have used a bit more liquor - the flavor was a tad too mild, and maybe some more oil - not quite moist enough. good flavor, though.

I had a supper club night at my friends house, this recipe was a hit.  Use all the glaze as the recipe states.  The pecans are a great highlight!

Although I used a butter pecan cake mix (it's what I had in the pantry) this cake was a definite do-over!  Delicious, just sweet enough.  We even enjoyed some of this as a breakfast cake.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day.  We had company and all 9 of us LOVED this cake!  I cut the glaze recipe in half (for calorie reasons) and it was still delicious!!!

WOW! This cake was just fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just so moist and full of flavour - the irish cream is just the perfect amount. I did make a mistake in adding the glaze as an "icing" on the top rather than a glaze all over - don't recommend this.  Appearance wise it didn't look that great, so the pot luck it was destined for, didn't make it, so we had to eat it ourselves.  Oh well!  What a tasty mistake :)

Delicious! Made this cake for St. Patty's Day with friends and ate the whole cake! The only change made was instead of granulated sugar I used powdered sugar and only used about 1/4 cup of Smart Balance for baking instead of butter. Cooked up to perfection and glazed the cake beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe - will definitely make again!

This cake was AMAZING!  My family LOVED it! It was so easy to make. I followed the directions exactly except for adding a little green food coloring to the glaze. It has become an instant tradition for our St. Patty's day celebrations. Thanks for the recipe!!

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a Devils Food cake mix. Had a few left over pecans in the container so I layered them in the middle of the cake batter when pouring it in the pan.   Made my own glaze, using several spoonfuls of Chocolate frosting, heating it in the microwave til smooth, then I mixed in the Baileys and drizzled it over the top.  Wonderful! Perfect with a cup of coffee and some friends to share it with!

Rave Reviews for your recipe Sue! I did not change a thing because I wanted to see how it came out "your way". Took it to a family dinner - everyone raved about it! Some even had seconds, which is rare with this weight conscious bunch. Very easy and very delish!

Excellent Recipe!  Everyone loved this cake.  I did let the cake cool 20 minutes then took it out of the pan, poured the glaze into the pan and put the cake back in for another 20 minutes.  It was fantastic.  The glaze hardened to form a sugary crunchy topping.  Definately a keeper!

This is more like a 4.5 star cake! I made this for my birthday party and it was so, so good. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Would be 5 stars but I had issues getting the cake out of the pan. I'm sure it was user error.

I didn't have a yellow cake mix, so I referenced the "Cake Mixes from Scratch and Variations" recipe on this site. In that recipe I replaced the shortening with butter, creamed the butter with the sugar and vanilla, then added the eggs, water, oil and liqueur according to this recipe.  With the dry ingredients from the other recipe, I combined with the instant vanilla pudding mix, then added this to the mixer. It sounds more complicated than it actually was, but this explains how you can make this cake without using a cake mix.  I made the glaze as directed. My husband loved this, he said it was better than Irish Whiskey cakes that he has ordered through catalogs.

I followed the recipe to the "T" this time and everyone thought it was very good; however, the last time I made it I doctored it a bit and people were falling over themselves to get more. Thanks for a great foundation recipe.

Absolutely delicious, omitted the pecans due to guests with food allergies. Cooking time was far too long for my oven...it was done is 40ish minutes.  Thank goodness I checked or it would have been dry, dry, dry as some other reviewers complained about.  I have tried brushing the glaze on a warm cake and putting the glaze in the empty pan followed by the cooled cake and still haven't gotten a result that I loved.  The top seems to get all the glaze, with very little on the sides.  The bottom of the sides are completely bare.  I have to keep trying to perfect my technique.

Great recipe!!!  Made this for Easter, everyone loved it.  I was afraid of the glaze, I thought it would make it to mushy so I did not put it all on.  I wish I would of, it would of made it that much better.

Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU, for posting this recipe.  I made this today for the adults at my daughters birthday party.  There is no cake left, and I had to give the recipe to several people.  I did omit the water and used a full cup of Irish Cream.  This cake was so yummy!  I will be making this again....SOON!

Excellent cake!  Great Irish Cream flavor and wonderful texture.  A big hit with my husband, a former chef, who usually won't even try "cake mix" cakes.  Delicious!

I made this recipe using a chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding.  It was delicious!  I left off the pecans because they didn't seem to fit the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This was the hit of the St. Patty's party.  We had quite a few desserts but this one went fast and first!  I'm going to make it again to take to work for me and for my husband!

This is a very good cake!  I only used half of the glaze because my husband doesn't like things to get soggy! But I wish I had used it all!  It's very good!

I made this for a St. Patrick's day party at work and I ended up sending a group email to the whole office on where to get the recipe because EVERYONE wanted it. Our boss brought in Sticky Buns and Bagels for breakfast and no one hardly touched them, but this cake was gone before 10 a.m. YummmO!

Very simple to make. Everyone liked it very much especially with a dollup of whipped cream! Patience with the glaze, let it soak in the poked holes. next time I am going to poke larger holes so glaze goes deeper down into the cake.

This was an interesting cake! I'm not a huge fan of nuts in cakes so I added chocolate chips and toffee chips instead and mixed them into the dough. They complimented the Irish cream taste very nicely, I think. I don't usually like the taste of alcohol and you can definitely taste it in this cake, but it didn't bother me. The glaze didn't turn out so well (too runny), but it tasted good all the same. I poked holes into the top of the cake and glazed away. Loved the taste of the glaze on the cake once it all cooled down.

I thought this was pretty good.  I baked as directed but used half as much glaze as was called for.  The cake was moist and had a nice flavor w/o being over-powered by the irish cream.  Would recommend.  Easy recipe!  Thank you!

Good recipe, good flavors!  I followed other's advice and added 1 cup Irish Cream to the batter.  But I made the mistake of adding one large box of pudding.  I never looked at the ounces in the box.  The cake came out very dense and flat.  Come to find out that not all boxes are created with equal ounces!  I should have used two small boxes of pudding.  I also made the frosting/sauce as called for and it was way too much!  But the flavor was excellent.  I will try this again and hope for a fluffy, light cake!

This is a delicious cake!  I have made it more times than I can recall, always with yummy results.  I make it every year for the cake walk at my kid's school.  I make it without the nuts, just because it is my preference.  Also, really good for breakfast, almost like a glazed donut.  YUM!

This cake presents very well. It would be a wonderful addition to any brunch or shower party. I followed the suggestions of others and let the cake cool for 20 minutes. I next poked holes in the cake, made the glaze and added the glaze to the cake pan. I then put the cake back into the pan to soak up the glaze. Next time I would poke holes in the cake while it was still warm. Also, it suggests mixing for 5 minutes. Make sure to do this as it makes for a nice dense cake. I will make this again for sure!

Today is St. Patty's Day! Last night made this recipe into individual muffins with shamrock muffin papers! Wow! Very nice. The glaze seemed greasy at first with that amount of butter, but it works in the final product. Didn't find the liqueur too overpowering. Very nice, will repeat next year! Top rating!

the cake was easy to make and tasted great, what failed me was the glaze.  I don't know if i did something wrong.. but i wish i had not put the Baily's in the pot.  It curdled right away and it tasted terrible.  But again the cake was great.  Next time i make it i will make a very different glaze.

I just made this as a birthday cake and got many, many rave reviews.  It's very moist and really does have a good irish cream taste. I didn't put all the glaze on because it was taking so long.  I think you could cut the glaze quantity in half.

Have started a tradition of making this every year for son's birthday, now he wants it for Christmas too!  Made it first using yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding...very good.  Next time I used chocolate cake and chocolate pudding..both were wonderful.  The longer  it sits the better the flavors blend.

This cake was just okay.  The glaze was delicious, but the cake rose was above the bundt pan.  IF I make this again, I will only pour about 3/4 of the batter into the pan.

VERY GOOD!  It was a hit at christmas eve dinner.  You can make this a day or two ahead.  When I removed the cake from the pan, i poked holes in it, poured some glaze in the bottom of the pan, and brushed a bit of glazed onto cake, then put it back into the pan.

I've made this cake many times and people LOVE it!  My friend calls it the "donut cake" because it reminds her of a donut.  People ask for the recipe and always comment on it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Most moist cake i've ever tasted. However, both time I made this cake, my cake kept overcooking. May have been the pan.

This cake is killer!  It's a bit messy and time-intensive as you pour the glaze over at the end, but well worth the trouble.  I've made it several times and I do think it helps to poke holes into the cake to allow the glaze to soak in.

I made this over the weekend for a family gathering and my mom who has never drank alchohol in her life asked for the recipe. I followed other's advice and added a full cup of irish cream to the glaze and it was perfect!

Fabulous!!!  I used irish cream coffee creamer in the cake because Bailey's can be expensive. But I used the real stuff in the glaze. It was awesome and I will definitely make it again.

Very moist, you definitely taste the irish cream with every bite.  I did not remove my cake from the pan.  I poked the holes and poured the syrup over top and let it soak in.  I used an angel cake pan so I did have to invert my cake at all.

This cake was delicious! It was rich, but not overwhelming, and the nuts added a great flavor to it. My entire family loved it and they all wanted seconds! I will surely make this again.

Keep Cooking! ;o)

Yum!  Try this with a little bit of ice cream when it's warm.  It's so good!  Brought this to a potluck at work and sliced it in small slices, which held together fine.  It was definitely a hit! Thank you.

Excellent.  Very moist and tasty, nice him of the Irish Cream. The cake rose beautifully to my surprise.   When I made the glaze, I made it too soon and had to reheat it to make it easier to pour. Next time I will try pouring the glaze into the pan and reinserting the cake to speed up absorbtion.

Delicious! I used a white mix and butterscotch pudding mix, it really brings out the irish cream flavor. Also I omitted the 1/4 cup of water, it was perfect.

I love this cake. It is very moist. I also like the fact that even after the alcohol cooks off you can still taste the flavor of the irish cream. I use this one always for Christmas potlucks, people always rave about it. Thank you.

I brought this cake into work and within a 1/2 hour it was gone! I didn't use the nuts and only half the glaze.  I also used french vanilla pudding instead of regular vanilla pudding. The cake was moist, yet not soggy from the glaze. It had just the right flavor, especially if your not a big drinker of alcohol beverages. Two thumbs up for a great receipe.

What a great, flavorful cake! I didn't do the glaze although I did do the nuts. I served it sliced with the chocolate swirl on the plate and a handful of raspberries.

Excellent! My friend brought this cake yesterday to a Labor Day BBQ.  It was sooo yummy that I ate four pieces.  When I heard it was mostly from a box, I was even more impressed.  This is a keeper.

This cake was wonderful. I've made a cake similar to this using coconut & cream of coconut. I had some Bailey's and thought this would be perfect. I was not disappointed. Wonderful!!  Thank you for sharing.

I have made this cake several times and it turns out great every time. It's a moist and dense cake so if you're looking for light and airy you may be disappointed. When pricking the top and sides of the cake I used the large-pronged fork I carve meat with, this made the perfect sized holes, big enough for the glaze to sink into yet not so big that it falls apart when cut.

I made this cake for a St. Patrick's Day party last week. Very tasty and moist.  And very easy too. I used a cough syrup syringe to inject some of the  glaze into the cake. I'm going to try it with Devil's Food cake and chocolate pudding  this week for a family get together.

Following one of the recommendations, I made two chocolate cakes for work. I used devils food cake mix, chocolate pudding, and no nuts.  Followed recommendation of using powdered sugar on one of the cakes and then made a second cake with the glaze.  The cake with the powdered sugar was good but basically tasted like a regular chocolate cake.  However the chocolate cake with the glaze was delicious!  It was so moist and flavorful.  I will definitely make the cake with the glaze again.  I would recommend that if you only use powdered sugar then plan to have some ice cream or maybe cool whip flavored with the irish cream.

mmm delicious. I brought it to work and it was gone in 5 minutes! Everybody loved it and wanted the recipe. I used Bailey's Irish Cream and cut the glaze to have of the amount asked for. I only had one bite to taste it and my co-workers gobbled it all up before I could get a slice :)

I made this for the people at my husband's office for Christmas and he came home saying he needed 20 copies of the recipe to hand out tomorrow- it was that good!  I baked the cake the night before and did the glaze the next morning, and it still absorbed in pretty well, although I didn't use all of glaze either.  Great taste!

Everyone is wild about this cake!  I've given out the recipe several times just in the past couple of weeks.  

I did a "trial run" of this for my family, using a milk chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding.  I also skipped the nuts and glaze and dusted the cake with powdered sugar.  It was wonderful, even in this dressed-down version.  

If you like Irish Cream, give this one a try.  You won't be disappointed.

Very moist, very good cake.  Everybody at work loved it, and some even asked for the recipe.  You can definitely taste the alcahol in this cake - it does not cook off as much as someone else had posted.  I didn't use all the glaze (it seemed like a lot of glaze, plus it seemed like it would have been too strong).  Thanks!

I rarely give fives but this one deserves it!  Next time I'll leave out the nuts.  The glaze is kind of time consuming but worth it.  I refrigerated my cake overnight.  Big success!

This cake is amasing!  I have taken it to several occasions, along with several copies of the recipe.  The only change I made was mixing the nuts up in the batter.  When I put them in the bundt pan before the batter, this causes a problem with cutting the cake, through all the nuts on the top.  When they are mixed itm it's easier to cut.

I made this cake and took it to a potluck.  It was a huge success.  It is truly as good as everyone says.  My only problem came with the glaze.  I used a stick of light margarine instead of butter.  I can usually do this in recipes with no problem.  But my glaze never thickened - as I assume it was supposed to.  It would have been impossible to put it all on the cake.  So I poked holes and brushed on as much as I thought would work.  It was delicious and I'm certain no one knew it wasn't exactly right.  Still got plenty of oooos and ahhhhs and lots of people going back for seconds.

Wow.  Wonderfully moist cake that even my children (yes, they ate some) LOVED.  Everyone wanted seconds and my husband can't wait till I make it again.  I also made with chocolate pudding as that was all I had, still great! Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy- Bailey's is perfect.  I found that at 50 minutes it was done and 60 minutes was overcooked but I'm sure this depends on the oven.  Thanks for sharing! :-)

I have made this receipe several times and it is very well liked.  I have used Irish Mist, Baileys Irish Cream, and even Kalua and it comes out great.  I also use 1/2 br and 1/2 white sugar for the glaze. Usually have enough left over for a sauce on ice cream.
I did bake 1 hr 10 mins and then turned oven off and left another 10 mins. It is not hard to make and it is great.

This cake was amazing!  It was easy to make and the taste was unbelievable.  I used a cheaper brand of Irish Cream and it was still wonderful.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it Sue.

This is just fantasic.  I leave the cake in the pan and pour the glaze over it while still hot.  Let it cool a bit, then invert directly to a plate or cake pan.  It's easier and less messy.

Very good, but it makes a very rich glaze.  I had plenty left over after I poured it on top of the cake.  Perhaps the extra glaze could be saved to pour over the slices?

Excellent cake; rave reviews.  Made it exactly as printed and was awesome.  I did not use "Bailey's" but the cheapest Bailey's type liquor I could find and it was still fabulous!

I don't know where all the rave reviews came from...  tasted a bit like butterscotch and was very moist but certainly wasn't worth the effort.

Made if for St Patrick's Day.  It was a supreme hit.  Just took it to a gals luncheon. EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  I agree to glaze it while still warm as it seems to absorb better.  Word of warning:  make sure you have a crowd to serve this to, otherwise a bite here and a bite there and it will be all gone to the cook.

This was the most fabulous cake I think I've ever tried.   I took it to work on St Patrick's Day and everyone in the office raved about it AND ate it
all.  I got to take home a plate with nothing on it but crumbs.  Next time I'll bake 2, 1 to go and 1 for home.

I loved the texture of this bundt.  It was a little heavier than a cake but not as heavy as a pound cake.  The Bailey's (what else?) taste was very subtle, if at all. The nuts under the glaze made it particularly pretty.   I do like the cake mix/pudding cheat for a change.  It was quick and easy and the lack of a heavy frosting didn't send everyone looking for a sofa 20 minutes later.  Thanks Sue!

This cake is delicious, and perfect for St. Patty's dessert. It is also so easy to make.  It uses lots of Irish Cream liquor and so can be expensive, but worth it!

this was pretty darn good! I followed the recipe to a "t" and it turned out great. A lot of people have been saying too much glaze but I disagree, it reminds me of those old fashioned glazed donuts and they are my favorite! Yummy. it's a keeper.

Nothing spectacular.  I made it in a cathedral type bundt pan so it looked very nice but I couldnt even give away the leftovers to 3 different families.  Made exactly as directed. Not worth wasting your liqueur.

This was a very good cake, however I have a recipe that I also make that is almost identical to this one.  The only difference is substituting brickle chips in place of the Irish Cream, and adding no glaze.  Both are very tasty!

Wow, this was the best ever!  I only made a few adjustments- I omitted the pecans, used a vanilla bean cake mix, and used sugar-free pudding.  The 60 minute bake time was right on. Could not have turned out any better.  Everyone loved it, especially me!

WOW! I made this for St. Patricks Day and my family went crazy! They raved about it over & over (which is always nice)!  I will certainly make this again.  It would be nice anytime of year!  I read several reviews that said there was too much sauce.  I didn't find this to be the case at all.  The cake absorbed nearly 95% of it, and the little bit left over just pooled around the bottom, but this truly was so little it didn't matter.  Fantastic!

Made on Sunday to serve on Wednesday.  Still very moist.  Left out the nuts as aunt can't eat but put in a few chocolate chips.  Only made 1/2 the glaze and made w/brown sugar.  Delicious!  Everyone enjoyed it at the St. Patrick's Day dinner.  I asked if it's a "repeat" and everyone said yes!

Moist, even after 3 days. Smells great during baking, and when sliced. I'm giving this 4 stars because I did not care for the enormous amount of glaze! The nuts on top was an attractive quality, but the glaze completely covered it. I would definitely bake this cake again, but with much less glaze - perhaps a few drizzle.

The flavor was very nice.  Smooth and tasty.  I did get compliments on the taste as well.  I need to play with this, though, as the presentation wasn't that great.  Will experiment to find what works for my style.  Thanks for a great start, though!

This was so amazing!!  It was so easy to make and it was so moist. I made it for my entire family and everyone was just loving it! I used Amarula instead of Irish Cream (cause I didn't have any) and it was just as amazing! GREAT cake......LOVED it!!

Great recipe!
The nuts are on top, and then topped with the glaze for a delicious crunchy "icing" effect.  We served this at a party last week and everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe.  We will be making it often!

I tried this recipe and surprised my friends and husband with it. Everybody loved it including American and Hungarian people. It was easy to make. I will probably use this recipe for Christmas and for other holidays as well.

Every year I have a St. Patrick's Day Party and am always looking for new recipes.  This year I tried the Irish Cream Bundt Cake, and what a hit! I believe this will be a family favorite and will be served at every St. Patrick's Day party at my house!!  Thanks!!!

Fantastic recipe!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used brown sugar for the glaze.  The glaze cooled a bit too hard, i.e., it crumbled when cut, but that can easily be remedied by adding a little more liquid to the glaze.  It didn't detract at all from the wonderful flavor of the cake and glaze.   Thanks for sharing, Sue!

I am a Realtor and made this for an open house held during St. Patricks.  I added a drop of green food color to the glaze.    Everyone loved it and I got more calls for the recipe than I did on the house itself!

This cake is the same as a rum cake I've made but with Irish creme instead and everyone liked it so much better...I agree that their was too much glaze, so I would definately cut back on that next time. I looked beautiful  in the cathedral bundt pan....

I made this for St. Patricks day and family and guests thought it was wonderful. I tried putting the glaze in the pan and the cake back in, but I must have cooked the glaze too long because it got hard and glued the cake into the pan. I had to heat it up to get it back out. I put the cake on a rack and poured a new batch over it and it was much better. I will be making this again and again.

Made this for our St. Patty's Day feast yesterday and it was AWESOME!!! My husband couldn't stop "MMMMMMM"ing after each bite. Instead of the liquer, I used the real stuff-Bailey's Irish Cream. Absolutely delicious!! Will definitely make again and again. Thanks Sue!!

We has this at a family get together for St Patrick's Day and everyone enjoyed it.  I found the glaze to be a little too much so I will try some of the suggestions offered-1/2 the amount, soaking it up in the pan.  I found out a bit too late that it spilled over the sides of the Bundt pan as others had observed.  But it was delicious and I will definately make it again!

Wow!!  I made this yesterday for St. Patty's day dinner and it was a huge success.  I brought the remaining left overs to the office.  It was gone within 30 minutes and everyone loved it.  They are asking for more.  I highly recommend this recipe!!!  I will be making this again and again.

This is absolutely AMAZING!  I made this for a St. Patrick's Day dinner, and it was a smash hit.  Plus, it's so easy to make.  I only used about half the glaze, though (but, I saved the rest to dip shortbread cookies in.  I couldn't bear to waste it!  *smirk*)

After reading previous reviews, I also used brown sugar (instead of white sugar)to make the glaze and returned cooled cake to pan and poured the glaze down the sides of bundt pan.  Needed about 1 hour to soak in.  This cake is so good.  I will definately make it again!!!!

This cake is quickly becoming a family favorite.  It is light and sweet, and the glaze is so buttery and wonderful....YUMMY!!  The glaze IS rather runny, but it is soooo good I use every bit of it. :)

I made this for a Saint Patrick's Day party then my husband insisted that I make it for Easter as well.  I brought the leftovers to work and had to give the recipe to 4 people because everyone liked it so much.  I would only use half the glaze from now on.

Although a little expensive because of the 
ingredients, it is definitely worth it. This cake
is one the most moist and tastiest I have ever
tried. DELICIOUS! I omitted the pecans, but that
didn't take anything away from it.  Will pass
this recipe on to my friends. A must try!

I made this exactly as the recipe called and it was really the best "pound cake".  I had to divide the rest amoung dinner guest in "to go" plates!  FANTASTIC  -  THANK YOU.

Be sure you have the correct bundt pan size because there is quite a bit of batter.  Put a sheet pan underneath while cooking to catch any excess overflow.  This cake was really delicious, it did  not last long, just like the other reviewers said.

This is a favorite dessert in our house - SO GOOD! The batter comes over my bundt pan when cooking, so be careful of drips in the oven. But it is worth every minute of making this--TRY IT!

great cake! easier than it seems and really impressive for company. I must admit that there's a lot of Baileys trown in, and I really don't know if it's worth it, as you really cannot taste it. You realize there's "something" alchoolic in it, but I dare you to guess it's Irish cream. So maybe into the batter at least something less expensive may do. The sauce seems a lot, but don't you dream of using less of it, it truly wants it all!!!

I made this for a fourth of July picnic and it went over really well! I only had chocolate cake mix and pudding available, so that's what I used and it was absolutely blissful. It was a great use for the rest of the O'Mara's that I had in the fridge and the family loved it!! :)

I had to reduce the cooking time by about 10 minutes.  The cake is sinful.
I made homemade Irish Cream ice cream to go with the cake - heck with dinner.
