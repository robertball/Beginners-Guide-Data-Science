Delicious and nutritious! I greatly reduced the portion for just me and for convenience used baby kale greens, I find them to be tender and sweet and because they were baby greens I did not have to massage the dressing into the leaves or wait an hour to eat. For anyone who doesn't know what liquid amino acid taste like it taste like soy sauce. I grow my own sprouts so this salad was an ideal way to enjoy them! The dressing is great and what makes the salad. I added sundried tomatoes because I like them. Nice recipe hawkeye154. Thanks for sharing.

Love the savory dressing which is not so common in salads. It's got great texture and plenty of protein and nutrition and it's easy to make with 'clean' ingredients. I added tomatoes and some avocado. Yum.

Don't make it with tamari! I used 1/2 c. lemon juice, 1/2 c. olive oil, and only 1/4 c. tamari--trying not to make it too salty--but it came out with a noticeably harsh flavor. It's probably better with the aminos?
Also, I added some chopped red onion, a little shredded red cabbage, and some shredded carrots. Mainly for the color--the carrots really brighten it up.

I found this recipe through a comment here at Allrecipes. The woman says she worked at a deli that served this salad and wanted to share the recipe because is so good, customers lined up to order it! I must have been one of them! Now that I've moved, I have wished to make it myself and savor those days at the deli, waiting my turn to order this salad. I've made it several times and I'm giving it a 4 star rating is because I can't seem find a good balance using equal amounts of ingredients for the dressing without it being too salty. I believe it is best to start with less Amino Acids and adjust to taste. I also like Meyers lemons for their slightly sweeter lemon flavor. This is the only two adjustments I make. ENJOY!

This is really good and has become our go-to kale salad recipe. I like it when it's still crunchy but also after a couple days when the kale has softened and really soaked up the juices. Sprouts tend to get slimy after a couple days though, so we often leave them out if we know we won't eat it all in a day - and it does make a lot.

Very good! I used sweet onions instead of red onions. I added more kale to it 6 hours later to crisp it up again for dinner and it was even better
