This was an easy dip to prepare on the stove top. I added chipotle powder, but felt it was still missing something. I will add chipotle peppers & red peppers next time. It is a good base for a dip, but needs additions.

Pretty tasty! Needed a bit more umph off of flavor for us. Maybe a dash of hot sauce next time. Don't get me wrong good as written. I found it nice that it cooks on stovetop where many similar dips are in the oven. Would be perfect for dinner party as an appetizer when you need your oven space.  Comes together quickly. Thanks snack factory!

The dip was just OK as written for us. We felt the amount of cream overpowered the spinach & artichokes. I will make this again, only I'll add more of the spinach & artichokes, more garlic & red pepper and maybe a squeeze of lemon. I will definitely say the Pretzel Crisps were the star! They really were delicious! Very crispy & held up well to the dip.

I'm a big fan of Pretzel Crisps (especially the 'everything' variety), so I gave this dip a try. It was a huge hit - and the pretzel crisps were perfect for scooping the hot dip (they are firm so they didn't  break which is nice)I definitely recommend this recipe.

It was a big hit with the Superbowl crowd. Very easy to make.
