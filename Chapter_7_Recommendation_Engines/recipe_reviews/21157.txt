This was good.  I made half, but used 3 chicken bouillon cubes.  I also made it on top of the stove instead of baking it.

My husband and I really loved this rice~ I like butter flavor so I used butter instead of olive oil..also i added about a cup and a half of fresh mushrooms (gave it a little more flavor)..I added an extra cube of chicken bouillon and didn't have a oven proof skillet so I added an extra 1/3 cup water...It was Perfact!! Thanks for the recipe!

This is such a nice twist on regular rice. It is so easy to do that I use this recipe every time I make rice now. Delicious!

I doubled this recipe, so instead of putting the skillet in the oven, I used a 2qt baking dish. I also added a little parsley flakes for color.

Very good rice. Subtle flavor. I added about 1 cup frozen peas to the rice when cooking was almost complete. Will make again! Thanks for sharing.

I made this with a few additions and it was delicious.  I also made it on the stove top, but added about 1/2 cup of water and more bullion at the end as rice was getting too dry.  I also added some frozed peas and carrots and fresh chopped parsley at the end of the cooking. Very good flavor.

OK, my sister and I are doing the Michael Thurman's 6 week body makeover and this recipe is perfect for it.  The only thing I change is the amout of rice and water, 3 1/2 C water and 2 C rice. I also sometimes add a can of veggies to it after it comes out of the oven and lid it again for 5 min letting it sit on the stove off of the heat. This is my 11yr old's new favorite rice (EVEN WITH THE VEGGIES).

I didn't even get to taste this recipe, the rice went black before I had even put it into the oven.  I almost set my house on fire and that's not a joke!  I'm very disappointed.

This recipe really jazzes up rice, which is a staple in my diet. And it goes great as an easy-to-make side dish. Absolutely delicious!

This was good and flavorful.  I've been looking for a homemade option to the flavored rice in the store and this is it!  I used 3 chicken boullion and at the end when I added salt, I added a liitle garlic and onion powder.  I might add some minced garlic with the onion next time.

Really easy! Goes great with almost any chicken dish. I added frozen peas to my rice to make it a "bit" healthy.

EXCELLENT flavor!!  I was super surprised given the minimal ingredients in this.  The changes I made were to add slightly less onion and I also used about 4 oz of white mushrooms which I sautee'd with the onions.  This came out PERFECT!  The flavor was great.  I made this with the "unbelievable chicken" from this site along with garlic asparagus.  WONDERFUL!

I made this for the first time tonight.  I think next time I'll add a little salt, but only because I used low-sodium boullion.  I also added some fresh mushrooms (sauteed them with the onions), and they were a welcome addition.

This is delicious.  I do not usually even eat rice, but I needed a side dish and this one had the ingredients I had in my pantry.  I used Pam instead of oil and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light instead of butter to reduce calories and it was outstanding!

Wonderful. Just like a recipe from many years ago which I hadn't been able to find. Even my youngest son loved it - and he isn't fond of rice in general.

Very simple. I actually combined all the ingredients and baked them in the oven in my circular ceramic baking dish for about an hour. I served it with the Reunion Meatballs, also from this site, and steamed broccoli. I found it bland, but we ate all of it.

I made this tonight. I loved it! I added an extra chicken cube. It would taste great with ham added or bits of real chicken, but perfect as is.
Will make again for sure!

I have always gotten store bought rice because I felt making my own was a pain.  However, this recipe is easy and tasty.

I've been making this great basic recipe for years with slight modifications.  I use "converted" rice for great results.  Use 3.5 cups of water, 4 bullion cubes and 2 cups of rice....for unsticky results.  Bring all ingredients but the rice to a boil, add rice, stir, bring back to boil, stir and cover and reduce heat on stovetop to its lowest setting.  Perfect results everytime.  Can mix finely chopped veggies and herbs into cooked rice and recover the pot for 10 min to add additional colors, textures and flavors.

This rice was the perfect side dish I was looking for. I wanted something savory, similar to the boxed brand but not as salty. This rice had a lovely, mellow flavor and everyone really liked it. I made it with bacon-wrapped chicken (by LaDonna Reed) from this site, and the sauce from the chicken on top of this rice was fabulous. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

My family loves this--it makes a nice side dish for BBQ, and it adds so much more to the meal than just plain old rice.  Whoever it was that said it turned black before they got it in the oven was NOT following instructions, because this was super easy to make!

I made this tonight!  My 4 year old granddaughter had seconds!  I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 onion.  I used powdered bouillon. I used parboiled rice.  I cooked it on the stove top.  I did not add extra salt and no pepper.  We served it with tilapia.

Simple and flavorful. I cooked this on the stovetop rather than in the oven and it came out wonderful. I also substituted chicken stock for the water and this enhanced the flavor.

This was great, I cut back on the recipe and made one cup of rice with two cups of water and added chopped red pepper. Very flavorful and my husband and I enjoyed it.
