This soup came out incredibly watery and tasted mostly like sour cream flavored milk. I added double the amount of cucumbers, the last batch unpeeled and that helped to give it more thickness and texture and spiced it up with pepper to start with. After that it was servable... Nice and refreshing

I served this at a dinner party last night and received rave reviews.  I found the toppings sank - except for the parsey and nuts but that was not a bad thing - eash bowl received equal amounts of tomato, green onion etc.  Eating outside with a full moon over the harbor helped the ambience.

This is so refreshing and light!   I LOVED the relish on top. I have been giving this recipe link out to a ton of people.  They are all excited to make it for themselves!   Great spring/ summer soup to dress up any table.

The longer it sits the better it tastes.  I like to use Greek Yogurt.  This is wonderful for a hot summer day.

Personally I would not have given it five stars but my guy LOVED IT! He said it was probabaly one of my best soups - and I make lots of soups.  He had it every night before dinner until it was gone.  I followed the recipe exactly. He loved the almonds in it so I guess I won't leave that out the next time I serve it.

I love this soup.  I even sometimes make it with fat-free yogurt, fat-free sour cream, lowfat versions, whatever, it always tastes great.  I always try to use fat-free chicken broth.  It keeps very well in the refrierator, too.

I really enjoyed this.  I made a few changes out of necessity: added a whole avocado because I had one on hand and didn't want it to go bad.  Used 1C Light Sour Cream + 2C Fage Total (fat free) greek yogurt.  That's what I had in the house.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will certainly make it again!

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this recipe was definitely a disappointment. I will definitely give it another go, though - in a smaller batch. It was runnier than I expected it to be. I realize this is a summer soup, so I don't want it to be overwhelmingly heavy or rich. I would just like a bit more body.

EXCELLENT for a hot day - can be made early and held for a day.
I reduced the amount of chicken stock by one cup and used 2cups of sour cream with one cup plain yogurt.
Rave reviews at my dinner party and the presentation was gorgeous!

For this soup, we substituted chicken broth for veghetable because of a poultry allery. We used one cup whipping cream and one cup sour cream instead to make it less rich, and thinner. Finally, instead of using the toppings, we used herbs from our own plants and added chives and parsley.

Very good recipe and quite easy!

This was a great recipe!  It was so hot here in Atlanta today that my husband decided a cool cucumber soup would be great.  We had only 2 cups of sour cream, so added 1 cup of plain yogurt.  DELICIOUS!  Highly recommended.

This was pretty good, I've never had cucumber soup before so I don't have much to compare it to. I'll probably make this again. The almonds on top were perfect for this recipe.

I don't like giving a bad review, but this was just awful. And Costly, it cost me close to $10 to make the watered down sour cream. I made it as is, the tasted it and it needed flavor, was like eating slightly garlic flavored water sour cream. But it smelled of chicken broth. I added some fresh dill and a bit of mint. It made it edible, but not enjoyable.
In the end, my cats adored it, so I guess it's not a huge waste.

The recipe was very easy to make, and it made a good quantity.  But I think the sour cream flavor took over the soup-- it was just too strong.  The soup was also not as thick as I'd hoped.  This wasn't bad, but it just did not impress me.  Sorry, won't be making this one again...

This was quite refreshing and yummy! I did use 2/3 Fage Greek Yogurt and 1/3 low fat sour cream. (It is a healthy substitute for sour cream.) I also added some garlic salt and Hot Salt (cayenne salt) instead of regular salt. This gave it a little extra kick. Did not use all the toppings, but still it was yummy. I also did not need to refrigerate for 4 hours. It may be even better, but I did not have the time.

10-19-11: Has a good, refreshing taste, would not be good without the garnishes.
10-20-11: Upped the rating to five stars given how it mellows in the refrigerator.

Didn't make the garnish- used crumbled bleu cheese instead, but this was very good- tasted more like cucumber flavored yogurt (I used yogurt instead of sour cream)... still nice and light, tasty with salt and the cheese.

i substitute with vegetable broth, balsamic vinegar, and a 2lb container of Greek yogurt- if it sits overnight, it's not too thin-for the topping i use the Publix Italian diced tomatoes along with slivered almonds- my wife loves this soup in the summer!

I've been making this soup for a while so I thought it was about time I reviewed the recipe. I love how light and refreshing this is, but I do make some minor changes that I think improves the flavor. I use greek yogurt instead of sour cream, Fage specifically. I also try to get home grown cucumbers from the farmers market -- this recipe really allows the flavor of fresh produce to shine. I recommend as many as five cucumbers to get the full cucumber flavor. Don't skip the toppings, they add dimension and texture. Enjoy!

omit the salt & use lower salt chicken broth, this coming from a real salt lover
