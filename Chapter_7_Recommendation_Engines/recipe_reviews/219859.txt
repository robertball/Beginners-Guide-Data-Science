I did not care for this recipe.  The cupcakes looked great, but both the cupcakes and the frosting had a terrible aftertaste and neither was sweet enough.  I see there are other variations with real vanilla, honey or agave and also dairy products, like whipped cream -- those modifications might be a lot better.  I think the combination of erythritol, stevia and melt substitute was just too much substituting...

Finally! A gluten free sugar free cupcake recipe that's quick and easy. I couldn't find erythritol at the store anywhere. I have xylitol at home and knowing that xylitol is much sweeter than erythritol, I used 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. I wish I would have did half instead because it was just a little too sweet. Also, the xylitol is a little grainy. I'm not sure if they make powder, oh well - not the recipe's fault. I also couldn't find sugar free food coloring so I just skipped it. I will be making these again!

The cake was super grainy and the sweetness of the erythritol was unbearable.  I made these for getaway for a bridal event and I was so embarrassed by their taste.  The frosting was delicious though.

I made the red velvet gluten free cupcakes with liquid buttermilk,  I still found they are a little on the dry side. The cream cheese icing is very tasty. It made up for any of lack of moistness in the cake.
