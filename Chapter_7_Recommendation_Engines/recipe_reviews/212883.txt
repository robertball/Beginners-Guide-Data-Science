I found this recipe bland. I added 3 cloves garlic, a little bit of fresh ginger, and used 2tsp garam masala curry powder. I also added 1 tsp chicken boullion paste. Thanks for the recipe.

I liked how simple this recipe was. Since I couldn't find fresh okra, I used frozen okra that was already cut into 1 inch pieces. I also used one 14oz can of diced tomatoes and it turned out quite well. With the extra liquid from the tomatoes I had to add more spices. I also added some cayenne pepper for heat! Will make this one again-thanks for sharing!

I love okra and this is without a doubt the best okra recipe I have tried. Spicy but not overbearing.

I wasn't WOWed by this recipe. I added onion and garlic and more spices to it to amp it up. It's pretty basic at best.

This is a well-balanced, flavorful recipe! The "spicy" comes from the curry alone, so choose a curry that you prefer.  The most awesome thing I learned from this recipe is the trick to reduce "okra slime".  Just nuke the cut okra, and the slime goes away!

I thought this was just great - a good choice for a busy night, if you plan ahead enough to have okra on hand, that is.

Maybe it's because I just don't like Indian food, or maybe it was because my tomato was too big.  Either way, after halving the recipe, I felt that there was not enough spice flavor, and WAY too much salt in the recipe (I would halve the amount).

Easy, solid recipe.  I used ghee instead of oil, probably had more onion and tomato than listed in the recipe proportionally, and I think this worked out well.  I also didn't have whole cumin and used ground, but this added extra flavor to the curry.  I did not think it was bland as other reviewers said and will definitely be making it again.

This recipe is great.  Easy for beginners (like myself).  I made the recipe as-is (but halved it).  The only thing I will change next time, is the amount of salt, it was a bit too much for me.

The recipe was really good, but, I changed it up somewhat.  Instead of fresh okra, I used a 1 lb bag of frozen cut and for the 2 fresh tomatoes, I substituted one 14.3 oz can of fire roasted diced. Still, the dish came out great and I'll definitely make it again.

I made it with ground cumin. I would make this again and add jalepenos or another pepper to make it spicy.

Good directions and general recipe, but needed more flavor.   I added a little coriander, garlic, and Garam masala for some more spice.

maybe I used the wrong curry, but I didn't find it at all spicy. I added garlic and jalapeno and then garnished it with cilantro...excellent dish!!

I love this recipe! I made it as a side dish one night when I had a lot of extra okra and it ended up being everyones favorite part of the meal. This will definitely become a regular in my household. Thank you so much for sharing!
