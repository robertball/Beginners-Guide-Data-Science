This was easy enough to throw together after working late AND it tasted good too. The texture through me off a bit with the corn "skins?". I think I'd puree and THEN add the corn. I used beef stock in place of beef base and water. This would be easily customizable for personal taste too. The red pepper added a nice heat. THANKS for the recipe!
