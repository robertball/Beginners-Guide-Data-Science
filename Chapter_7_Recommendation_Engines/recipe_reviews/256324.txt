8.22.18  You do have a lot of pans for a side dish clean up, but I think it’s worth the  effort.  I didn’t deviate at all from this recipe, and the only thing that I would change would be to cut back on the brown sugar, but admittedly, that’s probably personal taste preference.  You get a nice chew from the wild rice, a good crunch from the celery and almonds, the red wine vinegar perks it all up, and the OJ and zest brighten the overall flavor.  I think this would be awesome with roast pork.  This is just a really nice rice dish that I wouldn’t hesitate to serve to company.  TANYABOP, thanks for sharing your friend’s recipe, and I must say this is quite a treat for a weekly poker game.
