Very English (i.e. little taste)!  It wasn't bad, it just didn't live up to my expectations.  With the coffee, cinnamon and nutmeg I was expecting something really tasty, but it's not very striking, but it does go nicely after a spicy dinner.

The description of this bar cookie is accurately delicious.  I made these for a cookie swap to send to college age daughters.  They were the only 'healthy' option.  The response on them was great.  One girl thought they were a good quick breakfast-on-the-go.  I made them with unbleached flour and a little less sugar.  I personally prefer them without the sugar frosting and wrapped some individually to freeze for a few weeks.  I served them this morning and think they tasted even better!

Very subtle spice flavours. I added a confectioners sugar and lemon juice glaze which brought out the flavours a bit more. Very cake like texture and rise and had to increase cooking time by almost 20 minutes to get center cooked. Would be a great breakfast sweet.

I thought it was delicious, very moist. It was more like a cake so next time I will use a jellyroll pan. Too me bars should be thin. I used 1 cup brown sugar I didnâ€™t have raisins so I used dried cranberries. I gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe! I think a glaze would be nice.
