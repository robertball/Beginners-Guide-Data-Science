Okay, I was a little wierded out by the thought of eating straight cabbage, but this dish is amazing! I also tried it with apple cider vinegar in place of the wine, and it's great either way.

A friend of mine showed me his version of this.  He added sliced onions to the cabbage, salt and pepper. It was awesome!  It is amazing how simple a dish it is and how good it is!

A good complimenting side dish for other Asian cuisine.  I used rice vinegar instead of wine and added about a tsp of white sugar.  Using cole slaw mix with carrots and purple cabbage gave the recipe some additional color which was nice.  Served with a little hoisin sauce on the side for dipping, the flavors reminded me of a vegetable egg roll minus the wrapper.

I liked this. I served it on the side of a ginger glazed salmon and the flavors combined well.  I first carmelized one onion.  Then, I added the cabbage along with 2 chopped bok choy bundles and garlic.  I used rice wine vineger to finish.  We eat vegetables at each meal and this was a new idea for me and a welcome change my usual fare.

Oh my this is good and easy to make. Didn't have the wine so substitued  rice vinegar as others suggested.  Used Napa cabbage cooked for about 3 min and kept warm in oven (at 190deg) while I stir fried the rest of dinner..  This is not a spicy dish and so it was a nice balance to the spicy pork and fried rice main course and also had a cucumber salad (rice vinegar style).

Oh my, oh my. Delicious. I did saute a vidalia first. I then carried out the recipe exactly. I even had the Chinese cooking wine. This recipe got a whole lot better when I took a bowl to my neighbor who is from Hong Kong and she loved it. Now that's what I call a 10 star recipe when my neighbor enjoyed MY Asian cooking when I only know how to cook Polish. Thank you, iken.

I usually make this when I have left over coleslaw mix. It is quick and easy. I sometimes add a couple drops of sesame oil or some sesame seeds for variation.

Great recipe! I use the vegetable spray instead of oil, works great cuts the calories.  I never have wine or anything like that so i omit that.  If I don't have fresh garlic I use garlic pepper seasoning tastes fine.  And I mix my soy sauce with equal parts oyster sauce and water. I also like to separately stir fry onions and add them to the finished cabbage. Add some steamed chicken for a main course!Super Healthy!

Simple & delicious!  We loved this side dish w/ our Burmese curry & steamed rice dinner.  The flavors of the ingredients are well balanced w/ the sweetness of the cabbage.  I used 1/2 medium sized cabbage & it was perfect.  Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!  Will definitely use again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was so delicious.  We have lots of cabbage in our garden this year and I have been looking for recipes to use it up.  This is one recipe that I will be making often.  I served this as a base to my stir fry, instead of rice or noodles.  My husband is not a fan of cabbage, and he loved this.  Thank you for sharing.

Simple and amazing! I needed something to balance out my dinner of dumplings and rice, and this was the perfect thing. It'd be even better with a little shredded carrot for color.

I really liked this dish and it was super easy.  I used apple cider vinegar because I didn't have anything else and at first thought it smelled weird, but wow, it was really good!  Thanks!

This recipe is almost exactly the way my mother showed me how to stir fry cabbage except she adds a bit of grated ginger and 2 crushed red peppers when adding the garlic to the oil. Mmm-mmm-good!

Pretty good.  My husband usually does a cabbage stir fry, but I was trying to pull dinner together with left over Chinese while he was busy.  I used a minimal amount of canola oil and towards the end used a little bit of sesame oil and threw in some toasted sesame seeds also.  I used rice vinegar as I had it on hand.  I liked it. My husband usually adds more ingredients, but this worked and was quick and easy.

This was very good. I didn't measure anything, just threw the ingredients together until I thought it tasted good. I used butter, but oil would be good too. Used Japanese cooking wine because that's what I had. I liked the sweetness that it gave the cabbage, very good mixed with the saltiness of the soy sauce. I also added some rice vinegar because I love vinegar with cabbage. Oh, and extra garlic. I agree with the reviewer who compared this to an eggrole filling. Thanks!

A very versatile recipe!  Add a small onion, or a 1/4 cup of sesame seeds; substitute mirin, rice vinegar, or apple cider vinegar; use sesame or peanut oil; add a teaspoon of white sugar, or a teaspoon of ground red pepper.  Minor changes in this dish can affect the flavor in subtle ways to make it the perfect custom side dish to any Asian entrée!  An excellent recipe!  5 STARS*****!

Family didn't like this recipe at all. May be because I used savory cabbage.  Didn't turn out very tasty.

Delicious!  We subbed rice wine vinegar for the wine, added a little kale and some extra firm tofu (that we browned in a little oil) to make a full meal of it.

Very simple, fast and tasty. Used La Choy teriyaki sauce to supplement the soy sauce and rice vinegar instead of cooking wine.

Was a bit dubious about a cabbage recipe but had some left over I wanted to use. Wow. Recipe is great. I added onions also and some fresh red chillies . Cooked it a bit longer until a bit crispy..mmmm yum. Happy.

I followed the instructions exactly, including using Shiitake mushrooms.  I wanted to see if the type of mushroom would make a difference, but next time I will save the money and use button mushrooms.  To garnish the dish, I added some cashews - Delish!

Definitely a keeper and will have cabbage haters swooning! I used chili oil instead vegetable oil and added a teaspoon of mirin and it was delicious.

I have no idea what chinese cooking wine is (and wouldn't try to find it for one dish) so used seasoned rice vinegar instead. Also added a few dashes of red pepper flakes. If you don't think you like cabbage, try this recipe. You will change your mind!!

Like others I used bagged cole slaw. Also added 1 TBSp of sugar with the soy sauce.
A perfect addition to the Asian chicken recipe.

Something is definitely missing here. The only thing I can think of is that this must be Bok Choy and not your ordinary green cabbage. It was sweet to start with too!  (I have been cooking since I was a teen - and I can serve up some gourmet meals...)

I used 1 large Vidalia onion sliced into thin half circle strips, a medium head of cabbage cut into small strips. Then cooked it all in 2 Tbs of EVO with a Tbs of Ghee, ¼ cup Merlot, 1 Tbs low sodium Soy sauce. Then finished it all with a Tsp of corn starch to make the remaining liquid adhere to the cabbage and onion. Seasoned with fresh ground pepper and Himalayan fresh ground salt to taste. Cooked it all on a Wok on medium high. It turned out delicious.

This was bland to me. I think next time I might nix the wine and add more soy sauce.

I followed the recipe with a few exceptions. I didn't have the Chinese wine so I used Mirin (sweeten Japanese sake) about a tbsp. and used a tbsp. of oyster sauce and this dish was to my liking. I used leftover chicken as well.  This would make a good rice bowl but just on its own it was really good. I do not recommend using rice wine vinegar or any type of vinegar as it changes the taste of this dish ( unless this is the way you prefer it. ) If you do not have mirin, but have sake you can add a bit of sugar to it.

I thought it was bland. I added more soy, rice wine vinegar, sugar, salt and pepper but it didn't help.
