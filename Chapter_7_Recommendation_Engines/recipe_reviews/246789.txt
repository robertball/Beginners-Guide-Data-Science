7-6-2019 ~Lovely take on the traditional Caprese salad with a beautiful presentation.  Not generally a fan of balsamic vinegar, I chose a lighter option of a simple lemon vinaigrette.  I used a medley of various color tomatoes which made this especially pretty.

Delicious!! I love burrata.  It is one of my favorite cheeses with it's creamy center and firm exterior. I have been making this for years. The roasted tomatoes added a nice flavor. Drizzled with a really nice balsamic and fresh herbs you really cannot go wrong.

I quartered small tomatoes and used garlic powder, LOTS of basil and balsamic glaze. Such a delicious combo!
