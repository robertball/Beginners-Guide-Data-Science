This was wonderful! Very moist! I followed the recipe leaving the mushrooms out and added some McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning (suggested by my sister). This recipe serves 16 so I did cut it in half and still had gracious plenty! Thanks for the submission! We really enjoyed it.

This is by far the most unique, heavy duty meatloaf I have ever tried. It seemed nearly as big as a turkey (and flew away just as fast). It was gone quickly. I too subbed mozzarella for parm.,and it still came out wonderfully. I will definitely make this again

Love the concept but find it easier to stir it all together instead of making it into a roll. Tastes the same or better.

I didn't use the ham, salami or mushrooms. I used pepper jack cheese and slices of chili poblanos as a filling. I also made a homemade sauce to spread ontop in the final minutes of baking, consisting of chopped onion, fresh garlic, chopped red and green bell pepper and chopped fresh tomatoes. Sauteed for a few minutes and allowed to thicken.

YUM!  My family loved it!  I didn't have rice so I put rolled oats in the beef instead.  I just used what I had to stuff it as well-- spinach, parmesan cheese, chedder cheese and pepperoni.  We'll be having this again!

I modified this ever so slightly due only to what I had on hand, and was told it was the best meatloaf ever.  Used 2 lbs beef, 1lb ground pork and a mix of breadcrumbs and rolled oats in place of the rice.  It's ridiculously hearty and the heaviest meatloaf I've ever personally made.  Can be stuffed with whatever meats and cheeses you have available.  Keeper for sure!  Thanks!

I'm not sure that I liked the green peppers in the meatloaf and I probably would have put some more cheese in there.  This will make for some good leftover meatloaf sandwiches though.

The recipe tasted great, but if I made it again I would cut the recipe in half.  It made a GIANT loaf which was a lot if you aren't having a party.  It also took longer to cook because it was so thick in the middle.  Very tasty, though!

The recipe itself gets 4 stars, but the concept definitely gets 5 because its so easy to modify, trying new "stuffers" every time I make it.  It never gets old.

Tasted great!  Used rolled oats instead of rice and added a little milk.  It was a hit with my husband who isn't a big fan of meatloaf.

My husband is a picky eater, so I had to take out the spinach, mushrooms, and peppers. He isn't a big fan of meatloaf, but he loved this one.

I didn't really understand how you roll the loaf with wax paper while removing the wax paper at the same time?

Loved it!!  Reduced amounts by half - except the egg.  Substituted  mozzarella and Montreal Steak seasoning as others have done. What a great dish. Thank you for sharing.
