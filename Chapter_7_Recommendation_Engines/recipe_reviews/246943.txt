This is a perfect enchilada sauce or could be used to make tamales. A couple of notes.  I used all the same ingredients but a little different method.  First add the oil to the pan and saute the onion and garlic for a few minutes then add the cumin &  cook it with the onion for a minute.  Then add the tomatoes & vinegar, stir that all together and loosen any bits on the bottom and the pan.   Then add the stemmed and seeded peppers, broth, brown sugar and salt and pepper.  I did have to boil for more than 2 minutes to fully hydrate the peppers.   The more pepper seeds you leave in the hotter the sauce.  If the dried peppers are fully hydrated you can use a hand held immersion blender right in the pot.
