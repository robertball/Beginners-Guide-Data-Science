I'm a HUGE fan of sweet sauces and pork. I flour dusted the chops to attain a crispy shell in all that drippy sweet sauce-it also thickens it up. (threw it under the broiler for a while-the honey sauce can handle the heat).

Great marinade!  My husband loves pork and this came out very nice.  I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day.  The pork was nice and tender with just the right amount of sweetness.  It went great with steamed broccoli and rice.

Pretty good pork chops, thanks!  Since it's a bit cold here at the moment, I didn't grill them and instead fried them in a skillet on the stove top.  I didn't need any additional oil, and they fried up easily--about 10 min on each side, maybe a bit less.  I made these ahead of time--about a month or so--by putting the marinade in with the chops then freezing until I was ready to take them out.  Works perfectly for make ahead marinade:  all you have to do is defrost, and voila!  it's ready!  this is a nice combo of flavors.  I added more garlic like usual but otherwise I think kept it the same.  thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is pretty good. I like how simple the marinade is. I usually toss a few pork chops in a Ziploc bag before work and when I get home I don't have to worry about dinner! I always find that it tastes better the next day as leftovers than it does right after I make it.

These were great. I used 1/2 inch thick bone-in pork chops and I marinated them almost 24 hours. I had great grill marks on the chops. Too bad I didn't have my camera.

This was very good. I made it exactly as it is written. I wouldn't change anything. I think I am going to try this on Chicken too.

Made this with the real thin cut pork chops and only marinated for an hour and they still turned out to be one of the best grilled pork chops I ever made! I servered with fresh broccoli and baked diced potatoes with red onion (coated in olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, basil and curry powder). It made for a pretty interesting meal that even my 4 yr loved. I don't think I have ever seen him clean his plate like that!

Very good!  I don't like pork chops, but after making these...I do!  Used the basic recipe, but flour dusted the chops, poked holes in them before placing them in the marinade (which I marinaded for about 6 hours, flipping them every so often), added a little extra garlic and didn't quit use all the ginger...I'm just not big on ginger.  Threw them on the grill and yummy...a great dinner.  Thanks!

My husband loved these, while I just thought they were good.  I think that I might need to allow them to marinate a little longer to really get the flavor in there (they sat for about 5 hours).  The flavor was good, I just wanted to taste it a little more in the meat.  I'll try again, maybe marinating overnight next time!

OMG---SOO GOOD! My family ate this up like a pck of hungry wolves. The only change I made was with the honey. I had no honey and used corn syrup, and then added a bit of pineapple juice to thin it back out. So delcious! Next time I am going to add a bit more corn syrup and sesame seeds and make sesame chicken... Thank you for this yummy recipe!

These were pretty good - a bit too salty though.  I was expecting more sweetnee with 3 TBS of honey but it really didn't come through.  If I make these again I would add extra honey and not baste them while on the grill.  I think the marinading would be fine and less salty without basting.

Came out great!!! I marinaded the chopes for about twenty hours. My wife said to say "she was stuffed to the gills". We both loved it. This one is a real keeper.

I prepared this recipe last night. I gave it 3 stars because we found it to be nothing special. It was bad just not good. The flavor was rather bland for our taste.

I did not like this recipe. The meat was way too dry, even after marinating for 8 hours. It may be better if you use pork chops with  the bone-in. But even overall this receipe did not do it for me.

These were very good, I marinated them over night and the only difference was I used Veri Veri Teriyaki sauce in place of the soy. It was very good and they smelled awesome grilling. Thanks for the recipe!

My boyfriend loves to cook these on the grill. we have cooked these two times this week! the longer they marinate the better the flavor. they have the perfect amount of sweetness complimented with the bitter/sour lemon and garlic. i used nutmeg as a substitute for the ginger which worked well according to our taste-buds. this is such a great marinade, it keeps the chops perfectly moist. best pork chop that i have ever had!!

This recipe sounded so good.  I marinated the chops over 24 hours.  Somehow, we thought flavor was lacking.  I may choose thinner chops or fry instead the next time I attempt pork chops.

These were okay....nothing great, the sauce isn't very well incorporated with the chops, just kind of sitting on top. Good flavor though!

I actually used these ingredients mixed with egg and breaded the chops without any marinating beforehand. I pan fried them and they turned out delish.

This was great! The only thing I did differently was to add 1 tablespoon of Siracha chili sauce. I cut the pork chops up into strips and marinaded them in the sauce for 4 hours. Stir fried them up with some chinese vegetables and served over rice! I'll definately be trying this marinade with chicken too!

Good flavor definetely needs to be marinated over night, marinade ingredients need to be tripled for 5 pork chops, there was not enough liquid to soak it in the way the recipe reads, fry these about 15 min. depending on thickness of pork chops.

I prepared the recipe just as stated - it was delicious.  I marinated the pork chops for 8 hours (will try overnight next time), threw them on the the grill and they were great!  Definitely will be a repeat in the household.

Great flavor! We also tried the sauce on chicken and was it ever good! I think it would taste good over rice, as well. Maybe I'll try that next...

The others in the house enjoy a chicken dish that I make which is seasoned similarly to this, so I thought I'd try a pork chops recipe for them. Followed recipe exactly, and chops came out nicely seasoned. I think next time I will marinate them overnight, turning the meat a few times during marination.

I don't like ginger. I have made them several times without the ginger and they are great!

This is a great marinade.  I let my pork chops marinate for about 5 hours and pricked the pork with a fork to help the meat soak up all it could before grilling.  Will definately make again!

Tasty and flavourful recipe! I omitted the ginger but it was still good. I let it marinate overnight. I would make it again!

Tasty!  I marinated overnight and grilled on our george forman grill.  These were very delicious.  Served with a nice salad but I think these would be great with steamed rice.

This was very tasty.  I used boneless chops that were about 1 1/4" thick, marinaded for 5 hours then threw them on the bbq.  They were tender, juicy and flavourful.

Good. My husband even liked them and he doesn't like pork. I used bonein chops  because that's what I had and 3 tsp jarred minced garlic and marinated 9 hours. not as sweet as I expected with all that honey but still good.
