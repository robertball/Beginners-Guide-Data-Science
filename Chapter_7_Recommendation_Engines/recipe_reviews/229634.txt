I have  been doing my potatoes like this for some time now and I love it I add a couple of cloves of garlic which makes it even more tasty. I can't tell it is not done with sour cream and better still neither can my husband.

If you let your greek yogurt drain in layered coffee filters (think flat bottom drip filters), it makes for a thicker greek yogurt and less liquid in your mashed potatoes. The amount of chicken broth and yogurt is really up to you, depending on how thin you want your end result. I like adding homemade roasted garlic to mine.

I like the flavor that the Oikos gives to these mashed potatoes, just a little bit of tang.  I scaled this down to four servings, mashed the potatoes, and they were pretty soft, so I did not add the full amount of either chicken broth or yogurt.  They just would have been too wet.  I most likely will start adding yogurt to mashed potatoes in the future, as everybody liked the flavor that it adds.

Ok, so I used russet potatoes and plain store brand greek yogurt. They tasted ok, but everyone in my family stated they love my plain old mashed potatoes consisting of potatoes, milk, butter and salt and pepper. They said the yogurt made it taste sour.

Added horseradish and wasabi for some extra spice.  Shredded cheese added some texture and flavor as well!
