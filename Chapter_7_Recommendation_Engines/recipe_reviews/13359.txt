I thought this was good.  I wanted to cut some of the cooking time, so I browned the meat most of the way first, which may have contributed to my soup being less like "mush".  I also upped the celery and added some diced carrots.  I only used 1.5 lbs of ground beef and it was EXTREMELY hearty. I can't imagine using a full 2.  I think the other user may've had problems because I'm pretty sure the pot is supposed to be covered for most of that simmering otherwise you will definitely cook off all the liquid.  I used all vegetable juice and no plain tomato juice.  Also added some worcestershire, which I thought gave it a nice kick.  Nice for cold weather with grilled cheese sandwiches (mozarella went very nicely)

Really tasty, solid soup. Would be fantastic on a cold winter day served with some hot, crusty bread rolls.

I've eaten this every week since I found this recipe.   I usually make it with left-over stir fry beef or roast and add some extra no-starch veggies.  YUM!

Really good soup. I browned ground beef & drained it really well. I also added a package of frozen mixed veggies to make it heartier.

This is a good recipe. I really liked the diced toms. May add some more next time and a little chicken broth. It's actually a great proportion of liquid/other ingredients. I think the person who mentioned that there wasn't enough liquid must have not known to cover the pot while simmering. If you don't forget that part this is a good one!

This isn't so much soup as it is vaguey tomato-flavored beef mush.  This recipe either has too much beef or too little liquid.  I became concerned after step 1 reduced the liquid in the pot to almost nothing.  In an attempt to prevent the same thing happening to the scant 4 cups of liquid in step 2 I simmered VERY slowly for only an hour and still wound up with poor results.
