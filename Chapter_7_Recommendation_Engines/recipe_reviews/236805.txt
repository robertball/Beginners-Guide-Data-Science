Wonderful dish, used artcat's  idea and put pepperjack cheese on top - nice touch to a good dish. Thank you artcat - as for Doug_B there is nothing on this site that says you "have" to try a recipe - if you look at the ingredients and don't like them then just move on, there is absolutely no call to be rude.

This is a pretty good version of a truly ubiquitous dish of Texas. Sort of an "inside joke"--the King Ranch is one of the biggest ranches in the world. They raise CATTLE, not CHICKENS! So it really has nothing to do with the King Ranch, per se.    Here's a tip. Don't worry about finding or using fresh corn tortillas. I always have those on hand, but King Ranch Casserole is best made with tortilla chips. Yep--Tostitos, Santitos, even Doritos! They will soften up in the sauce & provide a good corn flavor. I've never, ever used actual tortillas.

I also shy away from the condensed soups, but this is a great recipe and all you have to do to make your own is increase the oil to about 1/3 cup (I actually use butter!), cook your onions in that and when they are soft, add about 1/3 c. flour, stir and brown it a few minutes and add about 2 1/2 cups of milk/chicken broth and make your own sauce. Yummy, and homemade.

I haven't made this recipe in years, but as soon as I saw it, knew I had to pull out my recipe book,will be making it again real soon. As for those who hate anything to do with condensed soup, get off your high horse! You don't know what you are missing. Better still, get off the site.

Wow.  The seasonings & spices made this a perfectly delectable dish. This really was very tasty with or without using canned soup (I tried it both ways & enjoyed it both times)... and I am sending my thanks to Chef John for once again giving us another option for a great-tasting chicken casserole. :)

I made this recipe exactly as stated, since that's the only way to really give it a fair shot. (I don't put much stock in reviews that don't evaluate the actual recipe!) Honestly, the flavor is good. my only complaint was the texture. There needs to be something in there with some crunch. Maybe I cut the chicken into pieces that were to small. It would have been better if the peppers or onions had maintained some of their crunch. I'll try it again and maybe not saute the onion and peppers. Or perhaps garnish the top with crushed corn chips. It just needs something to give it more structure. But again, the taste is great!

Hubby & I loved this! Changes I made:  mix of red and yellow onion, low fat/sodium version of the condensed soups, light sour cream, only 1 tsp of cumin, twice the amount of chili powder, 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. of onion & garlic powders, a Tbsp. of minced garlic with the peppers & onions, several grinds of black pepper and sea salt, 1-2 Tbsp of Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo sauce, couple dashes of Tabasco. Believe it or not, it wasn't very spicy-hot after all that. But it definitely needed something, since I was using the healthier soups. That's the great thing about this recipe-- you can make it your own! I also added some tortilla chip pieces on top of each serving for added crunch.

Amazing, and easily adjustable to taste.  My kids are picky eaters and I just watched everyone go back for seconds!  Hallelujah!  My daughter LOVES cheese enchiladas and queso dip, however, she somehow scrapes anything red or green off her chip and only eats the cheese.  So, I usually don't review a recipe I modify, but for those of you with kids, these tips may help:

I was in a hurry so I grabbed two cheap rotisserie chickens and used the breast meat.  Fast, easy, cheap and lots of flavor.  I think dark meat might be too greasy, especially if you add extra cheese.

I substituted the green bell pepper for a 4oz can of chopped green chilies.  

I sauteed the red bell pepper and onion together and added some minced garlic until pepper and onion were soft.  Added the green chiles and Rotel and put it all in a blender to "hide" it.  PERFECT!  

I only used a 1 1/2 tsp cumin and plain chili powder in place of the Ancho and Chipotle (my kids are more familiar with these flavors).

HUGE HIT!  Will definitely make this again.  I'm sure the original recipe is also amazing, but doing it this way, my kids got some veggies - bwahahaha.  40 minutes was the exact right time and there was plenty of sauce.  I will absolutely make this a regular meal in our house.

I gave it 3 stars is because it's a good generic recip. I myself prefer to substitute chopped green chiles for the RoTel or other brand of tomatoes and chiles, making it more a 'green' as oposed to 'red' casserole and use only white cheeses like jack or asadero or a combination of the two and going with the green chile powders with the exception of cooking the chicken with a little red chile.

Excellent recipe! I have never had a King Ranch casserole before and I was surprised at how good it was! We've been missing out! I used a whole chicken that I boiled on top of the stove with garlic, onion, bay leaves and spices and then cooled and shredded. I used the broth from it for the broth called for in the recipe. I subbed poblano peppers for the green bell peppers since they are a little tastier , imo. I don't have chipotle or ancho chili powder so I just used California chili powder(1 tsp.) and smoked paprika(1/2 tsp.)Took the cumin down to 1 tsp . Followed the instructions, using 3/4 cup chicken broth. This recipe makes plenty of sauce to cover all the layers and comes out creamy and delicious! I probably used a little more cheese than called for and added some fresh chopped cilantro to the top. Served with tortilla chips and salsa. My son asked me to make it once a week!  Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

I just made this and tweaked it to yumminess, my kids and hubby luv it! 1) I used broken not crushed,organic tortilla chips instead of tortillas, gave a better texture. 2) I used organic cream soups. 3) Changed rotel for small can of green chiles...only used a little broth to not make it too soupy... did not use all the different chili powders just a big spoon of Simply Organic chili powder and 1/4 tsp himalayan salt... added celery with the onions... and a big dash of Louisiana hot sauce. Flavor was fantastic, not too spicy and texture was perfect after allowing to settle for an hour, as with most casseroles. I rated this a 4 simply because i felt it is a good base recipe but needed something. My recipe gets a 5 of course! ;)

The flavorings of this are great,  but it needed more sauce to pull off the bottom layer properly.  An extra can of cream of chicken soup and a 1/2 cup of milk were the right amount with the bottom layer, so it has the proper base layer.  Also, use whole and halves to do the bottom,  and dip the corn tortillas in the sauce before placing.  This is a great recipe we have been serving for 20 years.

This recipe was so good! My husband and I wanted something savory and flavorful and this dish totally did it for us.  I did substitute roasted poblano peppers for the bell peppers for a little more flavor and used multi-grain pita bread instead of tortillas since I didn't have any.  With these adjustments, we devoured it and my husband said, "Can you put this in the recipe box."  Sure thing!

This is my kind of recipe! Simple! Most ingredients mixed in one bowl. Use one pan for sauté. Slather everything into one baking dish. Simple and good. My wife who normally eschews any recipe with condensed soup likes it. As for modifications it is a good recipe to alter to your own desire. Personally I delete the chicken broth--it makes it too soupy. I add garlic when sautéing the onions and peppers. I double the cheese using a sharp cheddar and pepper jack getting tang and cream. . . or one can use cream cheese, etc. I also use tortillas as the base and have three levels of tortilla to firm up the casserole. And yes, the video reference is incorrect. King Ranch refers to the ranch in Texas. . . likely the largest and oldest cattle ranch in USA. Also I sauté the chicken in spices and sauce. -mwo

I've made this twice now and the second time was definitely better.  First time I followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out a little too "sloppy" and we ended up adding tortilla chips as we ate it.  The second time I added a few more tortillas, used hot Rotel, and also used leftover brisket instead of chicken.  I got rave reviews and can't wait to eat the leftovers!!  
Wonderful recipe and it will definitely be used again:-) I use tortilla chips instead of tortillas & they are wonderful. I also leave out the broth, as it is liquid enough.

This is an excellent recipe that my family has enjoyed.  Being from Minnesota, I know my way around casseroles (or "hot dish," as it's called there), but I had never heard of King Ranch or knew it was a staple in the Southwest.  This has just the right amount of spiciness and different textures... bell peppers & onions, creamy sauce, and earthy tortillas.  And it's super hearty.  To me, it tastes a lot like chicken enchiladas, without the fuss of rolling filling into tortillas.  Try this, you will love it!

Made this per recipe but didn't find ancho chili powder or chipotle chili powder so I just bought a chipotle taco seasoning and used some of that along with some regular chili powder.  Turned out great! The whole thing got eaten up.  I will make this again; and probably often. YUM

Having lived in Texas for almost 10 years it's hard to believe this is my first time at the King Ranch Casserole rodeo!  I changed it up by using leftover Thanksgiving turkey and homemade turkey broth - wonderful! Added some minced jalapeno to the veg saute, and garlic powder to the seasonings.  Not having any cream soups in the house, I added about 4 tablespoons both flour and butter to the softened vegetables to make a roux.  Added my broth to thicken, then the tomatoes and 1 cup sour cream. Stacked it per the original - We loved this!

My husband and I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. We didn't like the combination of cream soups and tomatoes. They don't seem to go together too well, at least for us.

I made this recipe exactly as posted. It turned out WONDERFUL! I absolutely LOVED the flavors in the fillng/sauce. I also added more than a "few tablespoons" to the bottom of the pan since it did not seem to be enough. We loved it. The sauce itself I will use for a dip for a party! Wonderful flavors; love the chile powders. I did use smoked paprika because I didn't have any ancho chile powder. I had a hard time not eating the filling/sauce as I made this! LOL! I agree with others, if you have not made this yourself, keep your negative, condescending remarks to yourself. Please mature.

Delicious! Like artcat, I hadn't made this for a long time. My mom-in-law gave me her recipe a few years ago, but it was much simpler. This one is so much more flavorful!

Ok I did make some modifications due to what I had on hand and also other reviews, but it still turned out GREAT and I don't think it changed the fundamental recipe.  Here goes: used an Anaheim chili instead of the green pepper; did not use any broth, it just didn't need any; used about 1/4 cup sour cream and less cumin; used regular chili powder instead of the 2 listed; used fresh cilantro, about 1/4 cup instead of oregano; and used crumbly tortilla chips instead of the tortillas.  It made a wonderful dinner and TO DIE FOR leftovers the next day.  I had never heard of this before, not living in Texas, and I will certainly use this recipe again, thanks for posting, Chef John!

This recipe's a keeper.  We like a little more zip, being from Texas, so next time I'll substitute another can of Rotel tomatoes instead of the broth. It needed a little salt as well.  I'm looking forward to trying it with the layers of crispy tortilla chips, as other reviewers suggested.

Loved this, and so did my husband. Ate it 2 nights running because there are just 2 of us. Froze the rest for later. Made a couple changes just because it was what I had. Added a pkg of quesadilla spices to use it up, and, of course, more cheese. That was it - delicious!

I grew up in Texas and have really missed this dish. My husband and I enjoyed this recipe, but decided we would like more tortillas in it next time. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

I have made this several times and it is one of our favorite chicken casseroles ever. You can substitute ingredients if you don't have everything and it still turns out great.  We like it spicey so I use jalapeño peppers instead of bell but you can make it to your own preference. I don't often use canned soups but for this they work great.  It's even better the next day.  I've made it with corn tortills and with corn chips and I prefer the chips. Yummy!

We really liked this. I used a package of taco seasoning mix because it was all I had on hand and it came out great. The idea of the pepper jack cheese kicked it up a notch.

This recipe was easy to prepare and tasted like a chicken enchilada casserole. I used fat-free ingredients (except for the cheese) and it came out very creamy and flavorful. I adjusted the servings down to 3 and used an 8x8 baking dish.

This is a "kicked up" version of the King Ranch casserole I've been making for 20+ years.  I've never added the green and red pepper and chile powders; instead I add 1-2 TBSP. of adobo sauce from a can of chipotles in adobo.  The adobo sauce adds a nice, smoky heat to an otherwise bland casserole.  One other change I made is to use cream of onion soup instead of the mushroom; it's divine, and for some reason, it tastes like you've added sour cream to the casserole.  A delicious family favorite.

I followed the VIDEO instructions, which specified only 2 layers of corn tortillas. The results were tasty, but too much liquid resulted after baking. Next time I bake this, I will use 3 layers of tortillas. This should yield a firmer result, similar to the firmness of a meat lasagna. The only changes I made was to use regular chili powder instead of ancho and poblano powder, and a 4 oz can of green chilies to sub for half of a green pepper (so I used half a green pepper and the can of green chilies along with the whole red pepper and onion).

I followed the recipe except I used poblano peppers instead of bell.  I also used tortilla chips instead of flat corn tortillas.  The flavor of this dish is really outstanding -- not too spicy, but full of flavor.  Using a store bought whole cooked chicken, I found the recipe to be really easy and quick to prepare.  The bottom was a little soupy as casseroles go, but I'm betting the leftovers tomorrow will be perfect.  Great recipe!

I loved this! I didn't have any canned soups but had everything else, so I made my own filling. I used chicken broth, flour, the spices, and about 1/4 cup heavy cream--basically the same method as in Chef John's Chicken a la King recipe. I used corn tortillas, which I baked first, since I like the idea of using tortilla chips instead. Delicious comfort food--and I'm also from Minnesota, like the previous reviewer. Big fan of a good casserole. :)

My family ate this up and really reminds me of the King Ranch casserole my mother-in-law makes. My only substitution was using flour tortilla instead of corn because that's what my husband grew up with. This was an easy recipe to follow and do, especially if you use rotisserie chicken or leftover chicken (cooked) meat.

This one's a keeper but take the advice other reviewers who suggested 1) leave out the chicken broth and 2) make sure it sits for about 20 minutes for the tortillas to soak up the liquid.  As written, I can see how it would end up a soupy mess.  Just personal preference, I'd  saute the vegetables for longer as they came out somewhat crunchy.  Also, next time I'm going to take the advice and use tortilla chips instead.  As is, the regular tortillas disintegrate into the sauce.  Ok, I'll stop my whining and just say that, with a few tweaks, this is an excellent recipe!!!

I did not have sour cream, onion, or the listed chile powders.
I used onion powder and regular Chile powder. 
I also substituted 3 large chicken breasts for the chicken.
I had never tried this casserole before, but I like it now.

I loved this casserole. The first time I made it with 3 large chicken breasts, cooked and cut into small chunks. Second time I used a store bought rotisserie chicken.  Both turned out well, but thought the chicken breast meat came out better in the casserole. Next time I'll definitely use a hotter Rotel, due to personal preference.

Imy husband can't stand bell peppers so I made his recipe exactly as shown except instead of bell pepper I sautéed the onion with a jalapino pepper seeded and chopped. I then added a can of corn and a can of sliced olives to the chicken. Amazing!

Interesting, recipe sounded good but as I made it I started regretting my decision. Then we ate it and everyone liked it!  I did cut back on the onion and bell pepper and probably would cut back a little more and I think I would also use tortilla chips next time, but we all enjoyed.

This was okay, but there was a flavor that I'm not familiar with, possibly the cumin, that seemed to be too much. Except for the corn tortillas, my son said it was okay, and he's a picky eater.

Substitutions made for on-hand ingredients include: yellow instead of white onion, 2 large poblano peppers in place of all bell peppers (saute onion & pepper 5-7 minutes,) 4 minced cloves of garlic added to the saute pan for 1-2 minutes, one can of cream of celery soup in place of cream of chicken, 3-12.5oz cans Tyson Premium Chunk White Chicken in water, drained & broken up slightly, using 1-1/2 cans on each layer, omit oregano & sour cream, add extra ~1/2 cup chicken broth, 1/2 teaspoon salt, generic chili powder in place of ancho chili powder, Mexican-Style Diced Tomatoes, 14.5oz in place of Rotel tomatoes , 12 oz. (3 cups) grated cheddar cheese instead of 8oz, using 1-1/2 cups in each layer. Quartering  tortillas is unnecessary. Use 6 tortillas (total of 12 instead of 10) overlapped in 2 repeated layers in pan. Chef John says to leave out base layer of tortilla at the bottom, but use it anyway, on top of that first smear of sauce, to give a "base" to the first layer, half of each: chicken, sauce, and cheese. This is a flat enchilada casserole so don't skimp on the main "enchilada" ingredient. Repeat same for 2nd layer, ending with cheese. Cover with foil, bake 40 mins, uncover & bake 10 mins more. Replace foil to hold in warming oven till ready to serve. Plated garnish: chopped cilantro & scallions (green & white parts.)

I made this for dinner last night and it was a hit. I’ve already been told I have to add this recipe to my regulars. I used corn tortillas and fried them into chips before assembling. I also added cayenne pepper, next time I will not, there was plenty of heat. I also used a rotisserie chicken, they are always tender and juicy unlike frozen breasts.

Crazy delicious and filling. Easy to make. Not healthy at all haha, but just know that this is comfort food and a great weekend meal that goes well with a football game on a lazy Sunday.

This is a great recipe, as are all of Chef John’s recipes. To make it more “Tex-Mex”, I also add taco seasoning to the sauce and top it with Monterey Jack cheese. Hold on to your hat! Even my mother-in-law complimented it, and she’s an excellent cook!

Overall a really easy dish. Like any recipe I will make a few changes next time around. Will use skinless and boneless chicken thighs and grill them on the BBQ and leave them whole when adding them to the casserole. That will give it a bit more spice and flavor.

Fresh veggies raise this version above some recipes that are completely a can of and a can of.  I added a little sausage and used the spicy gravy I made from roasting the chicken. Wowza :)

Very good casserole. It could be just a little spicier/hotter. I'll try it with the spicier Rotel next time. Otherwise an excellent meal, and not that hard to prepare (I'm a newbie cook). Thanks for a great recipe!

It was delicious but very sloppy.  I like to make a recipe according to instructions the first time before I start to make changes. I like the idea of using chicken bullion powder rater than broth and adding corn. Will drain tomatoes to help reduce the sloppiness.  With changes I think this dish will become a 5 star.

This was a very good and quite delicious recipe! Next time I will just leave the tortillas whole and layer them like a lasagna. I served this with salsa and nacho chips. Also a great make-ahead casserole for busy work nights!

Nice variation on usual layered enchiladas. Didn't use chicken broth (but could try it), and used about 2.5 cups boiled, shredded chicken--could probably use more. I also used 1 small can of green chilies.  Without chicken broth, it needed about 3/4 tsp salt.

Liked this recipe. What I did different? Deleted the 1 cup broth & used 1/4 cup water. Added corn & 1/2 small can green chilies.   Saw in other reviews of people using tortilla chips. I went with fresh corn tortillas and toasted them a bit in the oven first. So they were semi crispy when I broke them up for the casserole. Worked out well and the texture was perfect.  Served topped with avocado and it was very good

This is a great recipe, very flavorful. I tweak it a little to taste, usually just adding minced garlic and/or garlic powder and onion powder for added flavor. I also sometimes use American or Velveeta cheese to give it a creamier texture. Have also used green enchilada sauce instead of the broth for a little different flavor. All just for variety though as it's very good  as it stands.

Can't wait to try this one!  My Mom made this when I was a kid.  I always thought the name of this dish referenced the King Ranch because it was served to the ranch hands and was so satisfying and delicious, it just had to be shared!!

Yummy! I used tostadas instead of regular tortillas to add some crunch.  I also drained the tomatoes because I know in the past King Ranch chicken has been too soupy.  I also learned that if you make the chicken mixture and let it sit for 30min. the chicken soaks up some of that juice so it will be more like a casserole.

This had a good taste but was runny.  If I make again, I will leave out the 1 c. chicken broth.  I also used more tortillas then called for (about 4 more).

The hubs and I really liked it! I had to make a few changes. Mainly, doubling up the cream of chicken soup because of a mushroom allergy. I also used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas. DON'T USE FLOUR TORTILLAS!  Sauce + flour = gooey mess! My friend made this and found out the hard way. I loved that it's very easy to personalize it to your taste. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! I just used regular chili powder. Easy recipe to freeze. I recommend letting it sit out of oven a good 20-30 min otherwise it's pretty goopy.

Five stars ARE NOT enough to be fair. It was the hit of my dinner party for my daughter's baptism. I did not add the chicken broth, and it really made the difference. Also, using the tortilla chips, instead of regular ones makes a big deal. Loved it. Per another reviewer, I topped the casserole with Pepperjack cheese. Wow! One rotisserie chicken was enough. And, I used green chile peppers ( 1 med. can)instead of the fresh green peppers, and it was a nice touch. This casserole was large...I mean big. No need for doubling. Chef John, you are one amazing chef! Thank you...and "Muchas, muchisimas gracias, Chef"!!!!!!!!! Que viva Chef John!

The fiance and I LOVE this recipe, I've already made it twice in less than a month. Made a few changes - I cooked three boneless chicken breasts, seasoned with taco seasoning, plus all the veggies (and two diced jalapenos, we like the heat) in the slow cooker on high for 3 hours, then shredded the chicken and combined the veggies with the soups (I used Campbell's Creamy Poblano Queso and Cream of Chicken) and other ingredients. Used Pepper Jack cheese instead of Cheddar, to give it even more kick. I've shared my version with several friends, all of whom loved it.

This recipe is fantastic!  Had to make a few minor changes due to what I had on hand.  2 cans mushroom soup as no chicken.  1 tsp chili powder and 1/4 tsp smoked paprika (only had one kind of chili powder).  Used quite a bit more tortillas as I wanted full layers.  I also only used 1/2 cup of broth as I thought it might be too runny.  I don't think anything I changed affected the taste to any real extent.  This was fantastic.  Served with rice, sour cream, tortillas, hot peppers and salsa.  Thank you so much for sharing this!  Oh they had legs and thighs on sale so I bought 6, baked them then pulled apart, I think any large amount of chicken would work great.

It was alright. It needed salt. I thought it'd be a little better to be honest and I love chef john.


EDIT: 
Soooo The next day while at work, hubby texts me and says wow this is amazing!! I asked him, the casserole??? (He wasn't home last night for dinner)  he says YES! I come home to three men with three empty plates. Hmmm. I heated some up for dinner and like they did, put a little Texas Pete on top and its soooooo much better! I don't know if it's because it got thicker or what but it definitely is better!

I made this recipe as described and was a little disappointed. It had a nice flavor overall but the flavor seemed a bit off. Next time, I will reduce to one pepper and add green chilis to balance it.

This was sensational!  I substituted crushed tortilla chips for the corn tortillas, but other than that, it was perfect as is.  To trolls karenmulhern and Doug B - take your vacuous comments elsewhere. You can't rate a recipe you haven't even tried.

Great filling protein filled dinner. I used check breast and would salt the water or prepare the breasts differently for more flavor but other than that it was awesome. Using a whole chicken (as instructed) would also help my issue.

I made with tortilla chips instead of tortillas and added an extra can of soup (probably had more chicken too), and it was scrumptious!  I only had reg chili powder, cayenne and cumin and it was still amazing.

Mild spicy flavor, I tried cutting corners and used frozen peppers and onions, they made it runny, even when cooking the water off. Plan to try the Dorito suggestion next time.

Followed DebbiK’s instructions to not use canned soups but instead used 1/3 cup butter plus 1/3 cup flour to make roux than added 2 1/2 cups of milk. Added a can of black beans too. The extra filling that it made I saved for the next meal and dubbed it Cream of Chicken Ranch Soup. It was hearty and filling.

Fry your corn tortillas or use tortilla chips. This was a sloppy slurping mess. I made a red sauce with New Mexico chiles and cooked chicken in it. Only 1 can of soup. I used cream of poblano.

This casserole has delicious flavor but it definitely lacks texture. What I do is skip putting the tortillas in this casserole and after baking it, use flour tortillas (whole, not torn up) to make burritos using the casserole to fill them. So yummy.

This is a good 'base' recipe for King Ranch Chicken, but being a Texan, I can't recall EVER coming across one made with green or red peppers in it.  Generally it has chopped green chilis in it and rotel tomatoes...  Be that as it may :-), one easy 'hack' is to use tortilla chips in place of the soft corn tortillas.  Broken bottom of the bag chips work just fine and taste just the same!  Making cooking easier (and just as tasty) any way I can is something I believe in....

Love It!  My husband thought it was wonderful and so did I.  I only used one of the chili powders and the spice was just right.  Would be great for a family gathering or a Bring your own plate dinner.  I've made it twice and both times it was yummy!

This is the perfect King Ranch Chicken recipe. It is exactly what King Ranch Chicken is supposed to be. I hate when people give recipes lower ratings when they changed it, or prefer it to be a "green" casserole or prefer this or that. If you prefer it another way, then you are not rating the specific recipe. You are rating it against your idealized inauthentic version. Make your own recipe for that non-King Ranch Chicken dish and see how the ratings hold up for you. King Ranch is what it is, and it has specific flavors no matter how you like to make it or prefer it. 

I am from Texas and have eaten this my entire life. This tastes the way it is supposed to taste. Chef John is always great too. I make this recipe as is, unless I have a jar of roasted red pepper that needs to be used and use that instead of fresh. Sometimes I use a mixed cheese if I have some I need to use. That's it. I don't lower the ratings b/c I don't have fresh peppers. If I use another cheese, I don't lower the rating b/c it doesn't have the tang of cheddar. 

I make the dish, top it with salsa and sour cream and enjoy it!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I was really worried about how it would turn out because I didn’t have either kind of the chili powders and didn’t realize I was also out of oregano so I was concerned it would lack a lot of flavor. I decided I would improvise by adding a bit of garlic powder and smoked paprika. It turned out delicious to my surprise! Only thing was it turned out a bit soupy. The hubs suggested we serve the leftovers over yellow rice, so that is what I did and it was even better the second time around. This recipe is a keeper!

Great recipe! This was my first time making this dish and it turned out great and the family loved it! The only thing I did differently was I added a little smoked paprika to the soup/ chili powder mixture, and it gave it a nice, smoky taste. This will definitely be one of my make-again meals!

Perfect. I halved the recipe, and had to use regular chili powder instead of chipotle chili (couldn’t fine it at the store). I was a little worried there wasn’t enough sauce, but it was the perfect amount. Some people commented how it was too mushy and used tortilla chips instead. I personally like that casseroles are mushy, but with the top layer of tortillas crisping up I thought it had plenty of texture. Next time will use a different kind of chicken, just because I don’t want the work of shredding an entire chicken.

The casserole was a hit.  Made as written other than my sour cream had gone bad so I used 2 T greek yogurt. And, didn't have the red and green bell pepper, so used a small can of green chili peppers.  Also used cayenne and sharp white cheddar.

I must admit I went very far from this recipe, but it inspired me and I used what I had on hand. First I read the recipe and then due to gluten free needs for my sister and me, I knew I was going to be creative.  I had Amy's Southwestern Soup with beans, and corn, chicken, cheese and chips.  So I heated the  first 2 ingredients and thickened with cornstarch and layered per the recipe. It was very good.  I do want to use the recipe again with gluten-free  soup adding sauteed mushrooms some celery and make it creamy with sour cream, but this was a great meal prepared with ease.

It was a hit with my guests.  Curious but mine was a bit runny.  Was I supposed to drain the tomatoes?  Any other hints for it to set up better?

My family really liked this, I did make a few small changes.  I did not have any cumin so that was left out, and I added a can of cheddar cheese soup to the sauce.  We like things really cheesy so that added a nice extra layer to it.  Other than that it was by the book, I will make again.

This one is a keeper. My only modification would be to drain the can of Ro-tel, as the sauce ended up being a tad runny and I would up the tortillas by 25-30%. Also, I'm not crazy about al dente peppers so I let the peppers & onion simmer in butter for a good 15 minutes. Otherwise, it was awesome and the leftovers were great too! Flash to 2 weeks later and I did this again with the above referenced modifications, and lightly salted the sauce mix before building the casserole.  Too bad I can't give it 6 stars!!

Excellent recipe! The flavors are delicious together. I followed this exactly with only two changes. Instead of plain Rotel, I used Chipotle flavored and I mixed the corn tortilla chips with chili and garlic flavored tortilla chips from Walmart. My pan was almost clean and received rave reviews! Thank you Chef John once again for an excellent recipe.

This was a very good casserole. I have to admit however, that I did adjust the recipe to make it Weight Watcher friendly.  Both my husband and myself really enjoyed it. I’m always looking for new recipes and different ways to fix chicken. Thank you

I think Chef John might be a genius. I am a many (many) generation Texan and yet have never really liked King Ranch casserole (or Dr. Pepper - shh, don’t tell); however, this one is the best I’ve had. It works really well if you use roasted chicken in it and it also reheats well which is a definite bonus in a dish like this. I have had numerous KRC’s with chips and numerous casseroles with corn tortillas - it’s really just a matter of personal taste. One is not “more authentic” than the other. And don’t break your brain trying to figure out why its called “King Ranch” - I have relatives at the highest levels of the actual King Ranch and NO ONE KNOWS. Nevertheless, if you’re going to try a KRC, try this one and, actually, everything else Chef John shares. You’ll be happy you did.

Well this sounded good. I was skeptical because of the cream soups, I should have listended to my intuition. This was beyond bad. Followed the recipe exactly. It was a casserole dish full of slimey soup and peppers waaaay to saucy.

It turned out really well! This was my first official time cooking and I was super nervous. The only thing I need to do is make sure to pay attention to the ingredients. I didn’t buy a whole chicken because I didn’t see it so I just make it with chicken breast and I put two tbsp of chipotle Chile powder instead of two tsp. Other than that it was just a little spicy but super good!

I just downgraded it. Night one it was too runny and bland but edible. Today, I reheated some for lunch and it was so tasteless that I threw it away.  I suppose it goes with the territory of casseroles made with canned soup (although I sometimes like them), so I can’t completely complain.

This is outstanding!  I did the two layers as requested.  This is the only recipe besides tuna noodle casserole that I use canned condensed soups because they are high in fat and sodium. I make an exception for this recipe using lower sodium products. I also cut the broth down to 1/3 cup.

Super easy and it feeds a crowd.

I don’t use tortillas- I use Doritos! Also don’t use any chicken broth and completely leave out the onions/peppers. Still great!! We serve with a side of rice, handful of tortilla chips and a scoop of salsa on the side. Yummm

Everyone loved the casserole. I added a couple of different things, including one can of corn, and substituted one poblano pepper for the red bell pepper. Also, to make the chicken have real flavor, use a cast-iron skillet to sear the chicken first, then lightly cook the vegetables.

The only change i made was to put part of a poblano pepper in for a little bit of bite. Oh, and tostito chips instead of tortillas.  It was excellent. It was even more excellent for leftovers. Now if I could only develop the willpower to put it away after making it instead of eating it right then...nah.

This has become one of my go-to recipes for my family-it gets devoured every time we have it! The only mods I make for this recipe to help with aggravation and budget (only makes a very slight difference) is that I use tortilla CHIPS, and use only green peppers (where I live in NC, the green bell peppers are generally 40-50% of the cost of yellow/red/orange bells). A huge hit, and will definitely be keeping in our rotation for dinner meal plans!

I really liked the taste but the recipe was very sloppy, too much liquid, next time i don't think i'm going to add the chicken broth.

I used a small can of green peppers, one red bale pepper because I didn't have green pepper. It was beyond delicious!!!

I made it twice! The first one I shared with my 87 year old father-in-law. The second one is all for him at his request. The third one will be made soon for my family. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. I don’t think I can improve on this perfection. Thank you so much.

Delicious casserole. I made it with a rotisserie chicken, baked covered with foil at 375 for 40 minutes and browned the top under the broiler. Ate it with sour cream, sliced avocado and mixed vegetables.

Made it with rotisserie chicken, would try boiled chicken breasts next time. Did not have all the seasoning recipe called for (chili and chipotle)  so would needed a little more hear for our liking. Keeper of a recipe, easy to throw together and family loved!

Was pretty good, it was missing a little flavor but that could have been due to the gluten free soups we had to use. Thanks for the tasty recipe!

We loved this recipe!  I added the Chipotle version of the Rotel  as well as a little smoked paprika, and the added smokey heat really perked up this version.

Coming from Kingsville, Texas I can tell you that the King Ranch makes no claim that this dish was from them.  Ahhh and so what! I loved it before when she made it for me and now I found it here. Thank you. It came out great and was a real crowd pleaser at Bible study. I THOUGHT I had made enough to take in to work the next day. I was wrong. Nothing left.

I made this but used tortilla chips instead. The results were awesome. With the soft tortillas, the casserole is kind of doughy, but with the chips, it's a little more crunchy. Everyone  loved it

Excellent! I used frozen bell peppers and onions and whole wheat flour tortillas. My husband doesn't normally cook and he said the layers were complicated. I made this myself later and I didn't find it complicated but I did skip tearing the tortillas and placed them whole.

Lord this is good! I was afraid it would be too spicy for my 7 yr old, but a three yr old could eat this. You can still use half of Thebes chipotle if you are nervous.  I found the different chili powders in bulk spices at the grocer.

Pretty simple and easy recipe for a big chicken casserole. I cut this recipe in half because I was just feeding my husband and I. To do so, (staying close to the recipe) I used (2) boneless, skinless chicken breast and simply cut them into slightly smaller chunks and fried them in a pan. I pulled them out, cooled and shredded them. I saute the peppers and onion in the remaining oil in the pan. I used only half of each pepper. I mixed the peppers and onion with a single can of cream of chicken soup, used the whole single can of tomatoes and added no broth. Adjusted spices, cheese and tortillas accordingly and made this is a 9 x 9 casserole dish. It was filled to the brim. Tasty and lots leftover for my husband and I.

This is a really nice recipe. It is a new take on chicken enchiladas in my opinion. Some minor changes that I did included reducing the amount of tortillas to only about 5 and reduced amount of chicken broth.

Delicious!  I subbed a can of cream of poblano soup for the cream of mushroom and added a can of drained and rinsed black beans along with the chicken.  I think I'll throw in some corn next time as well.

I made this as written and it was very good. My 7 year old son did not care for it though and my husband thought it was good but did not love it. I will make this again but probably play around with it a little bit to suite our tastes. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best recipe for this casserole, and I even have the original recipe.  Made it exactly as written.

Very easy to make and was better than I expected. I usually expect these kinds of dishes to be soggy and runny. This one held together very. I will make this again.

I added a bunch more seasonings, two packets of taco seasoning, extra sour cream, I used a big can of cream of chicken, cream of mushroom about 2/3 a big can, two cans of regular rotel (mild would be better if kids weren’t eating) very simple and good. Another way to make it is with crushed up Doritos instead of tortillas Which I’ve done in the past and it was really good.

This was really good!  Thanks for great recipe.  Followed exactly but added artcar's recommendation of topping with slices of pepper jack cheese.  Prepared in the morning and refrigerated until dinner time, then followed baking directions.  So good - little bit of spice - just enough to make tasty without overpowering.  Served to a group and people raved!

It was okay. I bought a roasted chicken from Wal Mart and added recommended seasoning plus extra. I poured liquid off the tomatoes and chilies. Dish was a little juicy for me.

My family does not like mushrooms, so I used cream of celery soup with the cream of chicken for the sauce.   I also cooked the peppers & onions for much longer, until they were soft, as my family does not like crunchy onions & peppers. Instead of corn tortillas, I crushed tortilla chips, and put in the bottom of the casserole dish.  I stirred the shredded chicken  into the sauce, then topped the tortilla chips with the chicken/sauce mixture.  I topped it all with cheese.  We liked the crunch of the tortilla chips on the bottom.  Next time, I may top the tortilla chips with some cheese, then add the chicken/sauce mixture, then more cheese.  Obviously, we like things cheesy!  Great spices made this one of the best King Ranch chicken recipes I've tried.

Mine came out a little runny, so I will reduce the amount of broth next time I make it. The flavor was great. My hubby loved it and ate leftovers. That is a big compliment.

I didn't have canned soup so I made cream sauce as suggested with. 1/3 c of oil/butter  1/3 c of flour browned then added a mix of 2 1/2 c homemade chicken broth blended with a  Ancho chile powder and Chipotle powder.  Also added diced poblanos. Everything else as suggested in the video. Served with crushed tortilla chips and spicy salsa.

Had a very good flavor with a touch of heat.  Only addition was to add some minced garlic to the peppers and onions.  Make sure you have a hungry group as I made this for my wife and I and we have a lot of leftover meals.

The first time I made this, I followed the instructions perfectly, we had some people over for dinner and there were no left overs.  My husband asked that I make it again that same week!  Now that I've made it a couple of times, I add a jalapeno just for a little kick.  My husband took some to work the other day and told all the guys he wants me to make enough for them so they can try it because it is so amazing.  One of my daughters friends was also over for dinner the other night and asked me to send the recipe to him so he could give it to his mom.  It is one of our favorites!

I'm not a big casserole fan, but this was excellent!  I increased the chile powders slightly, and used a large poblano pepper in place of the green bell pepper. Also increased the cheese from 8 to 12 ounces and used a mixture of sharp cheddar and a Mexican mix. Plated with fresh pico de gallo, diced avocado, sour cream and fresh cilantro! Yum!

My family really liked this. I had orange bell peppers, had to punt on the seasonings a bit using what was on hand. Next time I won't add the broth since this was 'juicier 'than it looked like in the picture. But we liked it& will make again.

AMAZING!! I made this exactly as the recipe specifies except I only used one green bell pepper and a can of green chilis instead of Rotel, and it was awesome!  I have made many King Ranch Casserole recipes, but none even come close to the flavor of this recipe!  I went ahead and bought the ancho and the chipotle chili pepper and I'm so glad I did.  Another FABULOUS recipe Chef John!!

We made this with a few subs that worked out beautifully! Due to food alergies, we used all gf ingredients and used as many dairy free as we could without compromising taste. Everyone loves it, including the super picky 9 yr. old.

I went a little heavy handed on the chili powders and the sour cream, and cut the chicken broth in half, but no other changes.  Oh, and added a can of chopped green chiles.  Great recipe!!!  Definitely in the keeper file.

I made this exactly as is.  It was flavorful BUT it was extremely soupy.  Too much liquid. IF I make it again, I will reduce the liquid.  We had to crunch tortilla chips in a bowl and pour the casserole over the chips for it to be edible with a fork.

Wonderful!  As written, this is a great recipe!  However, I made some substitutions based on a recipe I used many years ago, but have since lost.  I substituted cream of onion soup for the mushroom soup (hubby doesn't like mushrooms), added a can of chopped green chilies, and did not cook the onions.  Also, the recipe I used years ago used flour tortillas -- not corn. I tore up 3 tortillas per layer into bite size pieces. The flour tortillas soak up the liquid as it cooks and become puffy yummy morsels of flavor!  Also this would address the consistency issue that others had noted in their review. Using flour tortillas gives the dish more "substance".  Chef John, thanks so much for this recipe!  It's been years since I made this (lost recipe) and my hubby kept saying how good this was and licked his plate clean lol.

I have made this recipe twice. I recently made it for a church luncheon for 60 people (just made it times eight). Everyone loved it. I did cut back on the Ancho chili powder. 

My only question is it seems the be very soupy without the body shown in the picture.  Any suggestions?

I Made this recipe according to the directions.  The flavor was excellent.  The texture was too soupy. Next time I plan to omit or add much less chicken broth.  Maybe increasing the sour cream would help.

We enjoyed this recipe but I would make a few changes.  I'll drain the tomatoes as the finished product was a bit too liquid.  I just used regular chili powder but I will likely opt for either using a pepper jack cheese or add diced chilies to add more flavor. I bought a rotisserie chicken and just shredded that up. Very good.  We'll have this recipe again.

I'm sure people who like peppers would love this. However I did not use 10 tortilla's in this dish way too many carbs and don't tolerate peppers at all!

Very easy to make. I have picky eaters so I left out the bell peppers and they ate it. Even went back for seconds. Used three chicken breast and had to cook them before so the recipe took 45 minutes longer. If short on time, I will just use a roasted chicken from the grocery store.

This is a definite "keeper".  A bit runny but great flavor.  I should have followed recommendations and eliminated the broth, and maybe drained the tomatoes.  I missed a crunch, but my husband loved it.  I'll just crunch a few tortilla chips on mine next time!

The Pepper Jack Cheese was a great idea plus I added garlic (which I add to almost every dish I cook) & Tumric. Also I put my chicken in the crock pot w red pepper flakes & black pepper.

When I saw this recipe I knew I had to make it but it seemed like a lot for just two of us.  Tried it out on company yesterday and it was a huge hit!  After reading some reviews I did add some minced garlic.  I also cut corners by using a bag of Tyson Grilled Chicken Strips rather than deboning a rotisserie chicken or cooking one from scratch.  While the "sauce" seemed really thick it did get a bit more watery than I expected after cooking.  When I make again, I will cut back on the broth by about 1/4 cup.  This is an easy super flavorful dish.  I served with cornbread muffins to which I'd added corn, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese.

This recipe is great for using left over chicken.  I love this and it comes together nicely and taste great!  I will be making this recipe again and again.  Even the kids liked it.  
Thank you for sharing this free King-ranch-chicken-casserole recipe.

Wish i could find a corn tortilla that did not dissolve into the sauce on the bottom layer(short of making homemade ones). Added some Tapatio to punch it up a bit. And next time I'm going to drain the Rotel to remove some of the extra liquid. It is now in our family meal rotation.

Excellent version of a Texas Classic! One ingredient that cannot be omitted or substituted is the cumin (we call this comino in Texas). When I try KRC without it, it misses the mark.

This was a good change of pace from the usual fare I make. It was very spicy . Not hot, mexican spicy.  The adults and older kids really liked it but it was too spicy for my 10 year old.  I used tortilla chips instead of corn tortillas.

My husband said this is definitely a keeper.  We both loved it. I followed the recipe for the most part.  The only thing did differently was that I added a can of green chilies to the mixture.

I made some changes, I used a purple ( some say red ) onion, no sour cream and I just used a Mexican style chili powder and a regular chili powder. I used cream of chicken and a can of Fiesta nacho cheese! SO good! I also used Dorito nacho flavored chips instead of flour tortillas and I think the dish really shined!

Had good flavor but definitely needed salt.  If I were to make again I would lightly fry the tortillas and add another layer of them on top of the 2 Tbls of sauce.

Family loves  it! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because I wouldn't call it a casserole.  I made per recipe using suggestions of tortilla chips and topped off with slices of pepper jack cheese.  Also added extra green chile's. I served with a side of tortilla chips for scooping. Will definitely make again.  Thanks chef John!  Been a long time fan and subscriber to your YouTube channel!

I was kinda nervous because I've had this dish a million times but never actually made it myself.  I didn't alter anything except I couldn't find chipotle chili.  It was so good.  My entire family ate it including my 16 month old.  It was very easy and will be a regular on our menu! Thanks!

I've made this several times, but I wanted to cut the sodium a bit and amp up the flavor.  I used low sodium soups and instead of broth I used no sodium chicken bouillon.  I didn't have chipolte powder so I used hot chile powder (more than called for) and added a small can of diced green chilis.  YUM!

I would bump up the heat by using jalapeño peppers instead of green peppers, but I like a bit of heat. I also changed the cream of mushroom for cream of onion.

My family loves this. I jazzed it up with other seasonings and topped with sour cream and cilantro and fresh lime. Next time I will use less chicken broth. It was a little too liquidy, but, the flavor was great! Paired with black beans and avocado slices!! Delish!!
