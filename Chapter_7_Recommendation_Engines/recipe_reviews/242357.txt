Got a winner here folks! This recipe is perfect for everyone, not just those following specific diets. It is that wonderful. The paprika sets this apart. I used smoked paprika. The description is right on. The coating does create a shell and all the juices do stay in, leaving you a moist and tender chicken with a crust, even though there's no skin on the chicken. There is nothing in the flavour or texture that says this is made with nuts. It tastes like my grandmother's baked chicken made with wheat flour and spices. I messed up the method though.The amount left me a lot of flour so I used another thigh. In the end I used 5 bone-in thighs and after 25 minutes at 175°C, I cranked it up to 190°C and cooked another 37 minutes and they were perfect. Thank you Irismac for sharing your recipe.

Such a tasty recipe and the whole family loved it! Including my picky 5 year old. I made the mixture exactly as written then used 4 chicken breasts each cut in half. It made just enough to cover them all.

We did not enjoy this recipe. I followed the recipie precisely. The texture was soggy and most unappetizing. I will not make this recipe again.

This was very good! Even my picky eater boyfriend loved it. Nice and crispy, not soggy at all like other reviewers said. However, I had to cook it twice as long. 30 minutes is nowhere near enough time.

I used smoked paprika, for a bit more flavor, and doubled the recipe.  I believe 8 thighs released too much liquid and made the dish a bit soggy.  Next time, I'll try this on a rack over a foil-lined pan at 375.  Nice flavor, low carb, needs more time to reach 165.

Too much paprika made it a little too spicy for my kids, but husband loved it and i loved it!  I rolled my chicken breast in egg whites prior to dipping in the almond meal, thought it would stick better that way.  Will make again....just a little less spicy next time ;)

Delicious! All my guys (hubby, 14 yo, and 11 yo) and I love this chicken.  Such a simple, fast, and healthy recipe.  This is one of my go-to recipes for throwing a meal together on busy days.   A couple of notes:  1)  I usually go a little lighter [ ~ 3/4 of what is called for] on the salt and pepper.  2)  I always double the almond mixture for 4-5 thighs otherwise I run out  before they are all coated.

I use boneless skinless thighs and triple the recipe.  Because we are dieting, I trim off as much fat as possible.  It turns out perfect and is enjoyed as written.  I've not had the problems with it being too soggy, etc.  A family favorite!

Delicious and great recipe for celiac who craves expensive gluten free frozen chicken strips, and much tastier and healthier.  I used bay seasoning in place of paprika for some zing. Not real crunchy but not soggy at all.  next time I will experiment with dipping in eggs first.  still really good.

I had to make changes as I cannot have nightshade veggies so I replaced the paprika with herbs de province.  I had chicken tenders on hand so I used those.  I baked on my ovens  convection setting to avoid sogginess.  Since I am not avoiding fat I brushed a little butter on each tender for the last ten minutes of cooking. I was very pleased with the recipe.

You will not realize this was made with nuts, very nice crispy coating. I did this with chicken breasts and they  came out nice and juicy.

Pretty good, but could use some tweaking. It was too salty for my taste, and my kids thought it was too spicy. Otherwise, nice for a change of pace while my husband is on a grain-free diet.

We loved this chicken, tasty and cooks quickly. First we had no almond meal so I substituted buckwheat flour. The change was that I cooked it in a countertop Cuisinart toaster/convection oven. I used the regular oven temp and time and did not switch to airfry.
I was skeptical that it would cook as quickly as it did. This is one of the best recipes I have used for chicken thighs and certainly the easiest to make. No picture the food is all gone.

The trick to baking these is to use two elevated cookie cooling racks on top of a cookie sheet while baking. I bought mine at dollar tree.  I use 2 lbs of chicken breasts, double the almond meal and don’t double the spices. It’s too spicy if you do. Cut into tenderloin or tender sizes, roll or shake breading, place on racks and bake 20 min on 375-400, flip, cook 20 more minutes.

From the reviews about this being soggy, I decided to up the temperate to 400 and lay the meat on a cookie rack while baking. Additionally, I really should add that I used this recipe with chicken wings, which I put in a little bath of olive oil prior to the breading. Nice and crispy, low carb. Happy, delicious chicken.

This was delicious! I’m a picky eater and trying so hard to not lose interest in eating healthy like I always do. So I’m on the hunt for easy recipes and this one fit the bill. It was a little too salty for me. Not sure if it’s because I used table salt instead of sea salt though. I pounded some of the thickness out of a boneless skinless breast and baked for 25 mins on 350. I will definitely make this again!!

Made this for dinner last night. Did add a few more spices like garlic n onion powder and husband said it tasted like the dorito crusted chicken :) But we are also on Keto so the almond meal is all i can use to coat food with so finding this was great. It didnt turn out soggy but wasnt crispy. I used almond flour instead of almond meal because its all i had but was still yum. Will make again.

I added my own seasoning.  Onion and garlic powder, cayenne.  I also made this family sized.  I used 4 cups of Almond and 12 chicken thighs.  My issue is counting my macros for this.  I'm on a Ketogenic diet.  Otherwise, it came out great.  The family loved it.

Made it just the way the recipe calls for but halfed it as I use only one big chicken breast.   It was pretty good.  Will make it again.

This was a super yummy dish however, I used thick pork sirloin chops instead of chicken, and I added garlic and onion powder. So delicious. Another variation I did was the last five minutes I lifted the rack to the upper area and turned the heat up to 500 so that the breaking would get crispier.

I had to use GF blend because I forgot that I threw out my almond meal when I moved across the country 3 weeks ago. I used 5 thighs because that’s what came in the package, so I doubled the coating to make sure I had enough. I baked it x 27 minutes, & my thermometer read 165, as instructed. The coating wasn’t cooked, so I put it under the broiler x 5 minutes. (Usually when I make a recipe for the first time I’m super careful to make it exactly like it’s written before I make any changes.) The coating never appeared to be cooked. The meat got tough, the flavor was Meh. This was the first thing I’ve cooked for my BF that he told me he didn’t like, & he threw it out.

Did not add paprika but it was still amazing! Cooked it for 45 minutes instead to cook the chicken breast thoroughly.

A no-brainer! If you like some variety, just switch-out the spices! We like it made with curry spices, dry mustard & honey (make an egg white dip & add honey); even Italian herbs.  Thank you for this timeless dish!

Made the recipe as stated and really liked the result.  Next time I might add some extra spices but the recipe is great "as is".  Also had a lot of fun with my 3 year old grandson helping me with the shaking!  He had a blast and loves to help out in the kitchen.

This was good, but I had to cook it longer.  Next time I want to try it on fried chicken.

Soggy coating! Weird taste. Do not recommend. Will never make again. Family teen wouldn't even eat more than one piece.

GREAT, TASTY AND EASY!  SMOKED PAPRIKA, A BIT OF GARLIC POWDER AND GO! MIGHT ADD A BIT OF OREGANO NEXT TIME.

The first time I cooked this it was good but a little dry, the second time I poured a half tspn on each piece(in my case chicken breasts) and that seemed to help. For as quick and easy as it is to cook this it is hard to beat and has a very good flavor.

This was easy. I made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts cut in two and cooked for 30 min at 400. It was tender, but way too salty. I will make it again, but cut the salt in half.

I keep forgetting to buy pepper and I omitted the salt for my own taste reasons, but it's my go-to chicken breading recipe now for chicken fingers

I loved the idea of an oven "fried" chicken that didn't use flour. I did use smoked paprika because I love it but I wasn't thrilled with the final result but I will try again. The chicken just didn't taste right to me. So in all fairness I will try again using a higher quality fresh chicken (not prefrozen) and regular paprika.

Easy to make.  Great texture. However too salty. Maybe 1/4 tsp the next time.

Love this recipe.   It was my first attempt at a totally gluten free meal.   It came out awesome.   I read done others say they Pan fried too so I tried it both ways (baked and fried in coconut oil).  I liked the baked but LOVE the flavor of the coconut.   I served this with rice and a salad.

Wonderful recipe. I used bone in chicken breasts because i had them out,  just had to adjust the cooking time. Took 40 minutes to bake and worth the wait. Tender and moist, will make again. Thank you IrisMac for the recipe.
