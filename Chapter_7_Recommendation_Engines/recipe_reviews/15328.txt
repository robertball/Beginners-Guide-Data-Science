This is by far the best bread pudding I have ever had.  The only change I made was once using dried cranberries instead of raisons. I also add a little more spice to mine.  I found it important to pour the liguid slowly over the bread and then let it sit 5-10 minutes before baking. I bake for 30-40 minutes though.  when knife inserted comes out clean.  Thanks Nancy

perfect...i used just scant of 3 cups of milk and used 5 slices cinnamon raisin and 5 slices regular bread.  I let it soak a good 10-15 min before baking and at the end improvised by topping with a leftover bag of sliced almonds dotted with butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar.  it is fantastic.  great texture! thanks.

This recipe is a family favorite, and I've made it so many times, I have it memorized. The only change I make is to soak my raisins in boiling water for 10 mins or so so that they plump up and give all of their flavor in the dish. I also don't use nutmeg, because I don't like it. This is so quick and easy, it's perfect for unexpected guests! I usually serve it by itself, but sometimes I make a hard sauce to go with it.

I took this recipe and another recipe and put the two together and made a great 
bread pudding. One thing soak the bread for 20 minuts. I also use white raisins
they are sweeter.

Great recipe Nancy thanks! I had lost my original bread pudding recipe and this sounded good so guess what? I'm keeping this one and tossing the original if it shows up. Since I don't like raisins its the only thing I omitted but the next time I think I'll serve with some French Vanilla ice cream for extra decadence....in fact this Thanksgiving its on the menu.....

This was pretty good.  I tried it and thought it had too many eggs or not enough bread.  Maybe next time I'll adjust the recipe next time.  It was super easy to make and with a little Cinnamon-Ice Cream it was good.

This turned out fantastic.  I used thick sliced bread and Half & Half instead of milk because it was in the fridge.  As others commented it took much longer than 25 minutes to cook. Just a note, I researched scalding milk and discovered that it is unnecessary.  It was something that needed to be done before the pasteurization of milk.  It was a process used to kill bacteria.

This recipe represents (to me) some of the characteristic best of North American traditional cooking.

First, the balance of richness in the milk,egg, and butter is excellent.  While your mouth experiences the bloom of a "cuisine" dessert, the knowledge that the ingredients are homely brings it down to earth.

Second, however, you have the spices: cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg.  These are vestiges of our heyday in world trade stemming from the 1800s.  Again, the proportions bring a rush while not overwhelming the palate.

The relative ease of preparation and the wealth of satisfaction in the resulting dish are indisputable.  I had ends of bread in the cupboard and mentioned "bread pudding" on a rainy Saturday afternoon to my wife.  I then came to All Recipes and this recipe seemed to stand out among several candidates.  It was my 10-year old son's first taste of bread pudding, but I felt confident that this recipe captured the essence of this dessert I'd had at mom's table many times.

It was perfect.  Thanks.  I can see this this coming winter season as the conclusion to a stew or pot-roast or roasted chicken meal.  Can't you?

I also make this quite a bit because it's so easy to make and I always have most ingredients on hand.  I always make it exactly as the recipe indicates and it turns out wonderful.  One note of advice for anyone who has not made bread pudding before, and that's to make sure you give the bread time absorb all the ingredients before putting it in the oven.  Otherwise, it'll take for ever to bake and it'll fluff up.  Learned this the hard way :o)

I just made this using the heals from 5 loaves of bread and it turned out perfect! It had the right amount of moistness and sweetness.  I really don't see how this recipe could be improved. Delicious!!

My family loved this.  It's great!!  I made it with leftover hamburger and hot dog buns instead of bread slices.  I used five buns instead of 10 slices of bread.  I also let it sit for about 10 minutes after I poured the milk mixture over the bread cubes.

Big fan of simple pleasures, and this hits the mark.  This is just a really good bread pudding.  My thoughts: 10 slices of bread is a bit nebulous.  A slice of raisin bread is MUCH smaller than a slice of homemade bread.  So many of the reviews jumped between adding more bread or fewer eggs, but it really comes down to consistency.  When you let the bread and egg mixture soak for about 10 minutes, there really shouldn't be excess liquid.  It should be like a wet sponge, well soaked without floating in a pool.  I used 9 out of the 10 slices in a 1 pound loaf from Sprouts, and cut off crusts.  I didn't think pouring a little bit of butter and cinnamon over that much bread made sense, but it really works...just do it.  I like a casserole dish instead of a 13X9 because it seems to retain moisture better.  It did take closer to 40 minutes than 25.  It will rise kind of like a souffle, and have a good brown top.  A little "wiggle" left in it.  Be patient.  After you take it out, it will probably fall.  We put it in the fridge, and thought it might be too dense.  However, after a 20 second nuke, it became the moist, sweet bread pudding I was hoping for.  Added a whiskey sauce to take this one over the top.  The boy gave it a 10 without the sauce and an 8 with, so your mileage may vary.

Love it! The only change I made was I added cranberries. I did find that you have to cook it about an hour. 25min it was still mushy!

Delicious!  Only changes I made were to use dried cherries since I was out of raisins and I added nuts.  I also made a fruit syrup to top it with.

I combined several modifications to this recipie as suggested by other reviewers and it turned out amazing! Instead of 3 cups scorched milk, I used one 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk, and one 12oz can of evaporated milk. Then just a few tablespoons regular milk to thin it out. Also used jumbo raisins for more plump. Cooked in water bath to prevent bottom scorching, and cooked for 40 minutes.

i've never tried making bread pudding, but i've tried eating bread pudding and this is nothing compared to restaurant bread puddings.  however, this was tasty - i had to scramble the pudding and rebaked it after baking it  for 25 minutes because it was too wet for me.  if you're wondering, this bread pudding taste like common french toast.

I have made so many bread puddings, many from allrecipes, trying to find the perfect one.  I've always been dissapointed...until this one!  So delicious, exactly what bread pudding should be!  I think the technique is key, tossing the bread with butter. And so important to let it sit and soak, at least 20 minutes.  We enjoyed it warm, but it was even better cold the next day.  Thank you!!

Kept it plain and simple! I omitted the raisins. Very easy recipe and from things that are always in house. Be sure to watch it rise in the oven, it gets puffy! Oh and I used dinner rolls from my local warehouse store and it was perfect. I'd definitely serve this for breakfast for a crowd rather than fuss with actual French toast.

I'm a big fan of bread pudding, so I was excited to try this recipe. I used a loaf of cinnamon swirl bread, omitted the ground cinnamon and nutmeg, and used golden raisins. Like others have stated, I had to bake it for a good hour for it to set. I topped it with caramel sauce - a very tasty bread pudding, similar to what they serve at my favorite diner (they refer to it as "Cinnamon Brown Betty").

Just finished the first serving of this.  This dish is simple comfort food at its best.  I prepared this in a 9x13 glass pan.  Followed the recipe as written with the only exceptions being soaking the bread in the milk mixture for 10 minutes and baking an extra 10 minutes.  A wonderful snack on a cold day.

My family loved this. It was very easy to prepare. I mixed the milk with all  the other ingredients (other than the bread, raisins, and eggs) in a pot on the stove. I did not boil the ingredients, just heated them thoroughly. I poured the liquid over the bread cubes and then poured the beaten eggs over that, added the raisins, and tossed it all together. Avoid stirring too much, you want to have a chunky, yet soggy mixture. If you stir too much you will get gruel. I omitted one egg, added extra butter, extra sugar (brown and white), and extra cinnamon. I also added pecans. I cooked it 10 minutes longer than recipe, and served it with rum sauce.

Yummy, easy recipe! I think it's important to know what type of bread is being used because it definitely makes a difference. I used plain old sliced white sandwich bread (the cheapest grocery store brand available). I loved this bread pudding & received rave reviews, even by a couple of people who have never had bread pudding before! It was a little eggy, so next time I may cut 1 egg out and a little bit of the milk & see how that goes. I even added 3 slices of bread. Other changes: I used a 9x13/3q glass baking dish, thanks to review recommendations. (I have NO idea how anyone could use the recommended dish size and not have it spill over.) I sprayed the baking dish with nonstick spray and used 1/2c white sugar & 1/2c brown sugar and added chopped pecans. Per other reviews, I let it sit for about 10 mins before baking to soak in. Tastes great the next few days as well! Great recipe, I'm looking forward to experimenting with different kinds of breads.

This is very good, even better if you add chopped pecans.  I sprinkled the top with sugar and nutmeg.  Next time I will bake it in a 9" X 13" pan instead of the deeper casserole.  I think the crunchy sugary top is the best part.

Good stuff.  I used up all the random breads that were collecting in the fridge.  Nice flavor.  I made the sauce from "Berry Bread Pudding with Brown Sugar Sauce" on this site the next day and it made this bread pudding much better.

I'm not so much a fan of bread pudding to begin with but if I were this would be a 5 star!  I didn't bother scalding the milk and it turned out just fine I did however bake mine in a water bath.  I used vanilla bean paste to up the vanilla flavor and substituted dried cherries for the raisins.  Turned out great... for bread pudding.

I made this for my 87 year old grandmother and she said it tasted just like the one my great-grandmother used to make.  It's really great paired with vanilla sauce. (recipe available on this website).

This is a great recipe for bread pudding, the only thing i would recommend is to omit the salt. Does not do favors for the dish. I also added nutmeg and topped with a vanilla custard sauce and it was delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used two cups of milk and one cup of heavy cream, and wheat bread instead of white bread.  I just took a little taste of it and it was pretty darn good for a simple recipe!  Not too moist, not too dry.  I just might make it again!

The nutmeg is overpowering, and you need to use white bread as the recipe calls for, no substitutes,or the texture and taste will be off.  I cooked longer than the time called for and was still too moist, did not like the texture and it tasted too much like french toast, not worth the effort.........not very pretty either, had to add raspberrys and whipped cream to make it more presentable.

This recipe was awesome!  The only thing I added/changed was adding apples.  I sauteed apples in butter and cinnamon and added those to the mixture.  It's a good way to get rid  of all those apples this fall.  My husband loved it!

This bread pudding was excellent.  I have tried other recipes but this one is by far the best.  I cooked it for about 30-35 minutes and poured a vanilla sauce over it after it was done.(see Grandmas Bread Pudding Recipe for Vanilla Sauce recipe)  My husband said it was the best bread pudding he had tasted.  Thanks for the recipe

I changed this recipe to about a one pound loaf of fruit bread (I used apple) torn or cut in bite sized pieces, 1/4 cup butter, melted or soft, 1 Tablespoon Cinnamon & 1/2 cup Raisins mixed altogether.  Added & beat in blender:  6 eggs, 3/4 cup white sugar, 1 Tablespoon Vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon Nutmeg.  I added to the blender 3 cups milk (not hot, right out of the refrigerator).  I poured this all over the bread mixture.  I used a 9 X 13 glass pan & baked it at 325 for 30 minutes then 350 for 20 minutes.  Delicious!  I doubled the Vanilla Sauce & we spooned it over!!  Will make again!

yum. Yum. YUM. We loved this. I made it with some leftover white cake I had, and a few slices of leftover bread. I only had 5 eggs, but I cooked it in a water bath for 35 minutes and it was so moist.

First time making bread pudding...it was easy and delicious.  Took advice and baked it for 35 minutes, also soaked raisins in hot water for a few minutes before using them and let the mixture soak about 10 minutes before baking.  Will be making it again soon...

Awesome bread pudding! It took longer than 35 minutes for me too...maybe closer to 45. I personally like it better when I replace the raisins with chocolate chips and omit the nutmeg...and definitely serve with either vanilla ice cream or a vanilla cream sauce. Deeeelish.

This was a great recipe, I used some leftover cranberry, blueberry and pumpkin bagels and threw in some chocolate chips to make it even richer. Delicious.

When I set out to make a bread pudding I wanted one that was so perfect you didnt need to add ice cream or syrup to it at all. THIS ONE ROCKS!!! I hate raisins though so I did NOT add those, instead I added about 2/3 cup of pecans to the bread mix, they went perfectly with the dish! I also let it soak for 10 minutes before baking and used cooking spray instead of butter (it's cheaper). In less than 12 hours every single bite of this was GONE! And I have picky eaters!! I will DEFINITELY be making this again and again! I cant wait to play around with it and see what adding chopped apples and walnuts does to this! Simply WONDERFUL recipe!!! Thanks Nichele!!

This was an excellent and incredibly easy- and fast-to-make recipe. I made a lot of substitutions - used vanilla soy milk instead of regular, skipped the butter entirely, used whole wheat bread and whole wheat hamburger buns and added walnuts - and it still turned out absolutely delicious. It's amazing how the cubes all melt together for a smooth pudding structure - I shouldn't have worried about what size I should cut them to start with! Anyway, next time I'm planning to incorporate some alcohol (baileys perhaps?) in the pudding for an extra flavor/kick. And definitely add more nuts.

Easy to make bread pudding. I added an extra apple (granny) that i cut in tiny bits. I think it'll taste like real Dutch apple pie with the apple, raisins and cinnamon...It's in the oven right now!

i used challah bread and doubled the cinnamon, substituted half of the regular sugar for brown sugar, i also found this baileys irish cream sauce on another site and used it :  2  tablespoons  brown sugar  2  egg yolks  1/2  cup  2% reduced-fat milk  1  tablespoon  Baileys Irish Cream  combine 2 tablespoons sugar and egg yolks in a medium bowl, stirring with a whisk. Heat 1/2 cup milk in a small, heavy saucepan over medium heat to 180° or until tiny bubbles form around the edge (do not boil). Gradually add hot milk to egg yolk mixture, stirring constantly with a whisk. Place milk mixture in pan; cook over low heat 6 minutes or until mixture coats the back of a spoon, stirring constantly with a whisk. Remove from heat; stir in liqueur. Place pan in a large ice-filled bowl for 5 minutes or until sauce cools to room temperature, stirring constantly. Serve sauce over warm pudding.  delicious!

This is exactly what I envision when I think of bread pudding. A perfect combination of flavors and so easy to make.  The only issue I had was in a part of the process. After mixing the bread cubes with the cinnamon, raisins and butter I found that most of the raisins congregated in the middle after I transfered the mixture to the baking dish. A minor issue, but next time I will place half the bread crumbs in the dish, sprinkle half the butter, cinnamon, and raisins then repeat. Also, because I lOVE the taste, I increased the nutmeg to about 1/2 tsp.   I plan to experiment with flavors in my next batches by using peaches, apples, cherries, blueberries, or raspberries instead of raisins.

I never use just plain white bread.  This recipe was created to use up old bread around the house. I used old buns,bread and donuts instead of just white bread.  This is the perfect recipe to get rid of those dried out old buns that never freeze well in the first olace.  Also, add a bit more milk.  Happy baking!

I added more eggs than the recipe called for and soaked the raisins in the beaten eggs and vanilla for about 45 mins. to soften them up and flavor prior to baking.  I also added some rum to the egg/raisin/vanilla misture. I also dusted the pudding with powdered sugar after taking out of the oven.  The heat of the pudding melted the sugar and gave it a pretty look.  I used a stale french baguette for the bread.  Great tasting comfort food.

This is a great base recipe!!  
I used oatmeal brown bread (because that's what I had) and brown sugar (because it goes nicely with the bread)
It worked out perfectly because the proportions in the recipe are perfect!

I have to admit that I read most of the reviews and tried to incorporate some of the ideas.  First, I sprayed the pan with PAM for baking instead of using butter to grease the glass baking pan.  I was concerned about the amount of bread before I started, so I used twelve slices because I didn't want it too runny.  It wasn't until I had prepared the mixture ( a few cocktails and baseball game between Tampa Bay and Boston) that I re-read the instructions which indicated stale bread, however that being said, I used twelve slices right out of the package.  I also compensated using just a slight amount of milk in addition to that which was part of the recipie to compensate in case twelve was too many slices of bread.  I used a combination of dried raisins and spiced apples and threw in a 1/4 cup of finely chopped walnuts (personal favorites).  I still used just the six eggs and required remaining ingrediants to complete the desert.  I continued to watch the game while it baked and was I surprised how it turned out-absolutely.  I was amazed that baking, drinking, and baseball went hand in hand, so to speak.  In any event the bread pudding turned out to be very moist,  VEREY, VERY tasty, and equivalent to that which I have had in some of the best eating establishments in Des Moines.  Thanks for the recipie and extra pounds THAT i AM SURE i WILL GAIN I am sure to gain.  A small amount of maple syrup over the top set things off in a great fashion.

Wow! Some of the best bread pudding I've ever had! I used a random mix of breads I had in my bread box. Blueberry coffee cake, cake donuts, and homemade whole wheat bread. All mixed together and allowed to soak for a few minutes before cooking... delicious! Will definitely make again!

This pudding is strongly flavoured by the bread used, so use good bread! I used a home-made white loaf. As this recipe calls for raisins, milk and cinnamon, I figured brown sugar would complement those flavours better. And since my bread was stale and rock-hard, I soaked it for 20 minutes in the liquid before baking. I was afraid the result would have the texture of soggy bread, but it was more like a moist pudding. It turned out fluffy and creamy, with a nice crunchy top. All the raisins sank to the bottom though.

Perfect! This is exactly what bread pudding should taste like - buttery, eggy, creamy and not too sweet. I mixed it all up and then let it sit while the oven preheated. I also baked it slightly longer than called for - about 30-35 minutes.

This is one of the few recipes that is a "regular" around here - maybe the only "regular"!  This is especially meaningful, since I grew up hating bread pudding - I prefer a more solid pudding, and my grandmother made something rather soupy instead.

I do tweak the recipe - I tried white bread once, and hated it.  Way too bland.  Now I stick to the darker breads that I prefer - honey wheat breads work wonderfully, and mixing bread types is best (IMO).  I double the cinnamon, add 1/4 tsp of cardamon (my favorite spice :-) and omit the raisins (I don't like them).  I also find that the cooking time is short by about ten minutes.

This recipe is great as a base for other modifications, too.  I tried adding honey, orange, and sliced almonds once - very good, but will try w/out the almonds next time.

Very good, but this recipe is also under Bread Pudding (by Nancy) and under step 3 in the orginal recipe is says to soak the bread for 5 minutes before putting in oven.  I also use a vanilla sauce (other could be used) to add before serving.

I made this tonight and it was just okay. I used half and half as a substitute for 1 1/2 cups of the milk for a richer flavor. I used french bread and when I cooked it, it seemed to separate into three layers. A top layer that got crunchy because of the heat, a middle layer that was perfectly cooked and creamy bread, and a bottom layer that was like a custard, with no bread pieces. This was my first time making bread pudding so I don't know if it was supposed to be that way or if maybe the bread floated to the top of the mixture. I served it with vanilla ice cream and my husband said it was good, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Very easy to make, and oh so so soooooo good!!!

I took other reviewer's advice and let the egg mixture soak in for about 10min. and baked for about 35 minutes. It came out perfect. Will make it again and again.

This recipeis very similar to one I have always used but in this case I used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of milk, both room temperature.  I also added rum flavoring. Delicious!

Very Tasty, but I had to cook it for about 25 extra minutes to get it nice and crispy and cooked throughout....I also used crasins instead and added pecans. YUM! I think it's better for breakfast though...

Very simple to make and delish!!! It was the first bread pudding I had ever made and even though I didn't have nutmeg it still turned out awesome! My boyfriend loved it! I would probably bake it 5 - 10 minutes longer or used 4 or 5 eggs instead of 6 but it could've just been my oven! THANK YOU for this recipe!! I will absolutely make it again and pass it on to my friends!!

wonderful recipe. this is my first attempt at a bread pudding and it came out great. i used a different kind of bread, so it was a bit too much bread, but it tastes great. this is something i will be making in the future hands down.

I just made this up using some gluten-free bread that I made a couple days ago and it turned out great!  The bread I made ended up being too dense to eat solo and this was a great way to keep it from wasting.  I did let it sit a bit longer before baking so that the bread would be nice and soggy and it worked perfectly.

There is a saying that nothing tastes as good as being thin feels. This bread pudding comes pretty darn close. Comfort food at its absolute best. I added a half cup of pecans and made a basic caramel sauce, and this is one FANTASTIC recipe. Definitely a new staple for my holiday table.

I enjoyed this recipe.  My family, as well as myself, thought it was like french toast.  I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than called for to have it set properly in the center.

This recipe was perfect for the changes I wanted to make. I used a whole loaf of Publix breakfast bread which is loaded with nuts, raisins, and apricots. Therefore I omitted the raisins and did 1 1/2 of this recipe. The baking took longer and I watched it knowing it was done when a knife poked in the middle came out clean. Fresh grated nutmeg and real whipped cream topped it off.

Fantastic! I used all raisin bread since that was the only white bread I had and cut the sugar down to about 1/3 cup because raisin bread is so sweet. My husband thinks I'm a master chef, now! Thanks for the recipe, I'll use this often.

This is a very easy recipe to modify. The first time I tried it, I replaced the raisins with fresh blackberries and used day-old french bread- yummy! The second time I tried it, I used sour dough bread, replaced the raisins with 2 fresh plums sliced, and replaced the cinnamon with 1/2 tsp cardamom and 1/2 tsp orange zest- also yummy! My only issue is that by using bakery bread that I'm slicing myself, I'm overflowing the container at 5 slices. I can't imagince how you can fit 10 slices in one dish! Also, I agree with the other suggestions to let the dish sit and soak for a while before putting it in the oven- I find that if I start my oven once I've put everything together, the pre-heating time is just about right.

Excellent! Instead of "10 slices of bread", I had a loaf that was about equal to that. Also, I used crasins instead of raisins. The baking time was 10min more than the recipe stated. I recommend drizzling honey, maple syrup or a little icing on top just before serving.

I absolutely love the basic tenant of this recipie.  I did omit the raisins and used biscuits that were left over from another meal.  My family, who had never had bread pudding, fell in love with this dish.....p.s. this was my first attempt at making bread pudding!!!!! A hit and will make again.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! All I do differently is add a little more cinnamon, a little more sugar, and I add walnuts and orange zest too. I cooked it for 8 minutes longer than instructed and once it was done I mixed one cup powdered sugar with the juice of one orange and a teaspoon of vanilla to make a glaze to go over it (this really makes it). My family went crazy for it, it's usually gone by the next day. The first time I made it I used a cinnamon raisin bread and it was great, the second time I used a french bread and it was JUST as good if not better. This recipe is a keeper :)

Wonderful.  Just like my Gramma used to make.  I only suggest a bigger bowl to cook it in.  a three quart instead of a 2 quart would work out better.  Ours was absolutely YUMMY.

10 STARS!  When I married my husband gave me his mother's fool-proof recipe.  I have made it several times and always got "this does NOT taste like my mom's".  I gave up and started looking for something new.   I followed the recipe to the letter...almost?  ;-)    I DID cut the recipe in half for 2 people and used LESS sugar since I made a sauce for it which was the added sweetness.  AND I followed the other suggestions and let it sit for half an hour AND did not add the melted butter until just before baking. (I poured it over the top of the pudding)  I think that covers it?  BUT...bottom line it was GREAT and I am NOT a bread pudding fan but my husband LOVED it and said "this is IT"!  I guess that say's it all?  THANK YOU SO MUCH for posting this.

This was really, really delicious and so simple to make.  I was planning on making a New Orleans bread pudding souffle but got lazy (and too full) on Thanksgiving so instead I snacked on it for a few days after thanksgiving. Especially good with coffee!

Absolutely the yummiest bread pudding recipe I have made. My daughters (19 and 14) LOVED it and this has now become MY bread pudding recipe! I did not change a thing  but did let the dish sit before baking for about 30 minutes. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is awesome! I did change a couple things - I used skim milk, stevia instead of sugar, dried cranberries instead of raisins, and added lightly toasted and broken-up pecans on top. I let it all soak for 10 minutes and baked it for 35. Oh, my! I've never made bread pudding before, but this came out perfectly and was super-easy!

This was amazing, just like I had in a local restaurant.  The only thing I did differenet was to add a confectioner glaze to the top. I had my sister-in-law over and she couldn't believe the flavor-so easy to make with ingredients you usually have on hand - Thanks for the recipe

Very delicious bread pudding! I made a very slight change to the recipe: I used 5 slices of raisin bread and 5 slices of white bread instead, and added 1/2 a tsp more of cinnamon just because I love the taste of cinnamon.  It turned out amazing.  Definitely a keeper. : )

I used a 1-pound loaf of Cinnamon Raisin Swirl bread instead of the white bread, and I did not add any additional raisins.  This was excellent!  I usually make a more traditional recipe from French bread, but this was easier and just as tasty.  I also made a whiskey sauce (butter, sugar, a beaten egg, and a tablespoon of whiskey) to top the pudding.

This was so easy to make. I cut down the sugar to about 1/2 a cup and used day old vienna bread but otherwise followed the original recipe.  This one is a keeper. Thanks!

I made this recipe yesterday and by evening it was almost gone. It is so good, I really like the custard base. My son, who is not into puddings decided to try it and wow, he said it was pretty good.(darn, less for me)I followed the recipe and did not change a thing, I really don't think you have to. Try it and enjoy.

This bread pudding was delicious! I read some of the reviews, and let it soak about 10-15 minutes before baking and baked it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe said and it came out great. Soooo easy to make!

I made this yesterday, it was wonderful! I did add twice as much cinnamon and raisins. And I did scald the milk, seems to soak in well right away because it was hot. Increased the baking time by 10-15 minutes and it was perfect. I will definitely make it again, and I'm thinking about adding some diced apples and craisins next time.

Good old-timey recipe - I believe it needs to be cooked longer than the 25 minutes - it took around 32 minutes.  Flavor was good- I, also, thought it needed a sauce - I made a rum sauce to go with it.

Great combination of flavors!  This recipe is very versatile.  I had some left over croissants and they worked great.  I prefer a denser bread though, so next time i'll try using bagels.  Nice sweetness but I like things sweet.  Try using brown sugar for a richer taste.

I made this recipe almost to the letter, the only thing I changed was used a dried cranberry/spiced apple mixture instead of rasins and added a 1/2c chopped pecans.  It tasted wonderful, but I am going to cook it for 45 minutes next time as there was exces liquid when I dished it up.

This is very sweet and very good.  I used old whole wheat bread and sprinkled nutmeg on top.  Scalding the 2% milk was interesting..

My husband isn't a fan of bread pudding but he loved this. As it was cooling, every time I went into the kitchen a little more was eaten! I only had 1% milk, so I used 1/2 cup of cream in place of some milk. Outstanding! This recipe is a keeper.

I used croissants in this recipe in place of the white bread, because I had some extras to use up.  (yes decadent) I also let the croissants soak for about ten minutes before baking.  Served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  My husband loved it and said it was the best he'd ever had.  Will make again.

This is the best bread pudding ever!! I am not one for bread pudding either but it was the right blend of everything! The consistency was great. Wasn't too sweet and just the right amount of raisins! Just perfect! Wouldn't use another! thanks!

I made some blueberry muffins that weren't the greatest taste treat in the world and didn't want to trash them. I got the idea to turn them into a bread pudding. Using this recipe as my base, I cut them into cubes and dried them out in a 200 degree oven for about 45 minutes. I used 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 cup of whole milk, cut the sugar to 1/2 cup since the muffins already had sugar in them. I just pulled it out of the oven and it is much better than I dreamed it would be. It does seem to have a rather fluffy base due to the custard part settling to the bottom. I don't think I'll have a hard time getting rid of this. What an awesome way to take something plain and turn it into a killer dessert.

This recipe was very good and easy and quick to prepare, only I had to make a few changes. I had some cookies left over from a cookie tin I bought from the store and didnt want to waste them, so I crumbled them in the baking dish along with the bread cubes and raisins, and instead of 6 eggs, I used 4 (there's an egg shortage on this side of the planet  lol), and because I had no nutmeg, I substituted it with cinnamon, and I added a 1/2 cup more sugar. When it cooled, I dusted it with confectioner's sugar. As an extra measure, I drizzled some strawberry jam I warmed up in a small pot w/ a little water over it (It was so good, one bite threw me into a trance). I was very pleased with this recipe, Thanks for sharing.

Very moist and nice recipe. I added the mixture into a muffin tin, and they created  nice single serving bread-pudding muffins. 

I substituted dried cranberries for raisins, as suggested by another reviewer.

This was a good recipe to start with as a foundation, but like most foundations you need to build upon it. It was a little bland. The bread pudding I grew up with was sweeter. I think the next time, I'll start with cinnamon raisin bread, use a little more sugar, and add some rum. I made a homemade caramel sauce to this recipe to give it some oomph! But this is a good basic recipe.

Very good.  I do not like raisins so added a chopped apple.  I forgot the vanilla but it really did not need it.  Added a bit more cinnamon than called for.

This was my first attempt at Bread Pudding...LOVED IT !!!  I too thought too many eggs or not enough bread, so I added 5 more slices of bread, and let it soak about 15 to 20 minutes and added a little brown sugar on top.....very, very good.... Will make again!!

This was a great recipe!
A friend wanted a way to use loaf ends she didn't want to waste, it was quick easy and very tasty. It was sweet enough for the kids to enjoy and not too sweet for the adults.

Very tasty and good consistency. I used a brioche bread  and soaked the raisins in hot water to plump. I also waited for the liquid to absorb the bread before placing in the oven. Overall  it’s a decent recipe.

A good bread pudding recipe. Looked like a piece and tasted pretty good. I halfed the sugar and it was still pretty sweet. I also had to bake for an extra 10 minutes. I don't mind it a bit wet, but it was really pretty juicy.

It turned out better than I thought. After 25 minutes in the oven, it was very soupy.... I actually cooked it an additional hour and that helped a little. It formed up after cooling, and ended up being good!

DELICIOUS!!! I made it with some left over brioche rolls and old bread that I had around that was due to go bad. Other than 2% milk this was the only change that I made in the recipe. I shall certainly make this again . This is a terrific way to use up any extra hotdog or hamburger rolls !!!

Wow. Absolutely delicious!  Thank you for sharing. I tweaked a little by adding more cinnamon and replaced half of the milk with condensed milk. Also required an extra 10 minutes of baking time.

It turned out great. Everyone loved it, but I thought it was a bit too sweet for me. Not to mention, I think it would have been best to include in the description to let the bread soak up the wet contents for at least 10 minutes prior to baking. Still a fun dessert to make.

Made is several times and honestly the recipe above was the best I've ever had. I did not use any raisens or fruit. Was just plain. I did add an extra overflowing teaspoon of vanilla but other than that it is so super delicious. I did use a bread called artesian so I'm not sure if the bread makes the difference. Anyways totally worth it and delicious. Be fully confident when making this!!

Very tasty with just a few changes!
By using chefsharro recommendations:
I doubled the cinnamon, and added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, for the bread cubes, and  then 2 pinches of ground nutmeg on topping.
I let poured the liquid slowly over the bread and let it sit 5-10 minutes before baking.  I baked it for 40 minutes when knife inserted came out clean.

Great base recipe! I did add one more egg and instead of raisins I used craisins and walnuts. Pecans would have also been good instead walnuts. Served it with French vanilla ice cream.

This was really good. Easy to make and tasty. It did take closer to 40 minutes to bake.  Also, although I used the ingredients called for, I happen to have duck eggs which make everything raise higher and gave the pudding a light spongy texture. I don't know if chicken eggs give the same result or not.

The best Bread Pudding my family has ever had!  I have been making this recipe for years.  My now grown daughter, still insists every year this is what she wants for her birthday.  No cake, not even a present, just this bread pudding!
I would not change one ingredient or add more of anything, but I do suggest doubling it!

Perfect recipe, I love it!! I make this as often as I can. I usually double the recipe. The only thing I do differently is use one loaf Pepperidge farms cinnamon raisin bread and one loaf brown sugar and cinnamon bread of the same brand....and maybe a little more butter Shhhh!!

This was easy and delicious!  I doubled the amount of raisins and mine was not nearly done after 25 minutes.  It took 43 minutes to be browned all the way and to no longer have any "jiggle."

This really came out delicious.  The only reason I only gave it four starts was because I had to guess at the amount of bread to use.  How much is 10 slices of a two pound loaf of homemade bread?  Or left over baguettes?  Or Italian loaf bread?  How many cups of bread is 10 slices?

This was my first time making bread pudding and I thought it was greatly benefited from first rum-soaking (actually Kahlua soaking) the white raisins first. Great addition to an already great recipe!

I used two large french rolls for my bread, other than that, I didn't stray from the recipe.  I haven't ever made bread pudding or eaten that much for that matter, but I can testify to the awesomeness of this recipe!  SOOOOO delicious.
** I did use two cans of evap (almost exactly three cups) and had to cook for much longer.  Close to an hour.

We really liked this, I did cook it an additional 15 mins as it was very soupy still. But it was great. I have been trying to find an answer to the heals from the loaf bread, and this is a great solution. Thanks.

I started with 14 oz of white bakery bread, cut in half inch cubes.  Dried in the oven 375 for 15 minutes.  Toss half way through.  Let cool.  I used half cream and half whole milk.  I left out the nutmeg.  Baked as directed.  AWESOME!!!!!  I made "Bourbon Walnut Sauce" from the Food Network site  That sauce ROCKS!!!!!

Delish...but, it took longer to bake than recipe called for and the center still seemed a little undercooked.  But over all, it tasted good and I will try this recipe again.

i've made this recipe before and it's just great. however, this time around i totally customized it to be healthier, which i would have put under the customs option if they didn't charge me for it (lame). so, instead of white bread i used wheat; agave replaced sugar;  replaced butter with organic coconut butter; and milk with almond milk (regular). i cut the recipe in half exactly, to fit in my non-stick tie pin. oh, and i dried out my 5 slices of wheat bread in the oven at 250 for about 10-15 minutes.  at 375 degrees, it was still not done after 50 minutes (not burnt at all, a little brown)--so i realized i should have added more bread as I was missing sugar as a dry ingredient (and then had more wet ingredients with the agave)--after 5o minutes i turned it down to 300 to let it bake slower and longer. i baked it at 375 for  53 minutes, 300 for 25 minutes and then at 350 for 13 minutes. all in all, it about 1.5 hours for this to bake (until not super soggy wet in the center, but still quite wet) in my small apt-sized gas oven (remember, i cut the recipe in half). I also didn't add any raisins since i didn't have them on hand. the end result for this custom recipe was pretty tasty but kind of wet. maybe i'll have better luck with a less wet healthier version next time. But I’m still eatin’ this bad boy…love me some bread pudding (just not all the calories that go with the traditional route).

I added a small can of mandarins ( a bit less milk) plus one sliced apple on top of the bread and sprinkled the top with Craisins. Came out great with maple syrup for Boxing Day breakfast. Also, I increased the baking time to 45 minutes to make sure the eggs set. Easy recipe, will definitely make again with other variations.

This is the easiest and tastiest bread pudding I have ever made.  I omitted the nutmeg because I do not like it and used Splenda instead of sugar.  I made no other changes and my entire family LOVES it.  I have some in the oven right now and it makes the whole house smell like Christmas.

3 cups of milk is too much (had to cook for about 50 minutes because it wasn't set yet) maybe 2 or 2.5 cups would have been better. It's a great recipe though and I'll be making it again!

I'm not an expert on bread pudding, I couldn't even tell you the last time I've had it, but this was so good!! I think it might have been a touch too soft and liquid-y. Also, it took a lot longer to cook then the recipe instructed, but the flavors are amazing!! I left out the raisins as a personal preference, maybe next time I might try other dried fruits.

My husband and I loved this! Did change it a little since we're lactose intolerant. Used egg beaters and lactaid milk.  I also cooked it for 45 minutes because I used left over hamburger rolls from the summer bbq and wanted the pudding to be a little browner. Will definitely use this again!

I made this as a dessert for company, using left over hamburger buns. I let it soak for 20 minutes before cooking. It came out a little drier than I expected, but perhaps I used too many hamburger buns (8). The flavor was good but my family didn't appear to enjoy it and no one wanted the leftovers the next day. I think they are not bread puddings fans. I don't think I'll make it again, but I this is more due to family preference than it is to the recipe.

Overall, this is not a bad recipe but when followed exactly as written, mine came out quite soggyand had a strong eggy taste. I think in the future, I will use less milk and perhaps fewer eggs.

This was the best bread pudding . I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown suger. I also used 1 cup coconut milk and 2 cups milk. No raisins kids don't like them. I ended up cooking it 15 minutes longer and it was perfect husband and 7 kids said it was the very best. Thanks for sharing.

Very good! I didn't add raisins because I do not care for them, but It was still delicious!! The taste gets old after a while though and could only have a few bites. Also I do not care for nutmeg, so If I made it again I would leave that out.

This was a great recipe as is. The pudding was moist, not sweet and everyone loved it....even my 1yr old. What I did different taste wise was to half the milk...substituting with coconut milk...yummy. I then made a coconut sauce to complement. If not for baby I'd have made a coconut-Rum sauce! I also used the bread sides to form a crust ...by arranging them on top.

I thought this was really good. I added 2 apples, peeled and diced. I used challah bread. I also pressed the bread mixture down a bit once it was in the pan with the liquid to help it soak up the yummy goodness.

It's a little soggy on the bottom, but beautifully crisp on the top.  I used two day old french bread, vanilla soymilk( how i get away with using soymilk instead of milk! it makes great biscuits!), and no raisins.  I think 6 eggs is too much, and it needs a little more than just cinnamon and vanilla.   I used a 9 x 13 pan and it looks great.  Tastes fine except it's a little eggy on the bottom. I also let the mixture soak for 10 minutes before i put it in ( maybe that's why it's soggy!).   very easy to make and will try it again.

I love bread pudding but had never made it before I found this recipe.  It came out fantastic and was so easy!  I didn't let the liquid ingredients soak into the bread as other reviewers mentioned and I thought it came out perfect.  I've made it 4 times in 3 weeks...definitely a keeper!

This was very good.  The only thing I did was to add a brandy hard sauce when it was done and a dollop of whipped cream.  The brandy sauce was store bought but boy did it make it.

Super easy to make. I've never made bread pudding, but my husband wanted something like a local dessert made here. I thought it was a little dryer than I remembered bread pudding, but I think that's because there isn't a sauce. I would make a sauce for it next time.

This is a great old fashioned bread pudding recipe. I made a few changes to accommodate my tastes, after reading other reviews. I used 5 eggs instead of 6, 1 ½ tsp. cinnamon, no nutmeg, 1 ½ cups of half & half in place of half the milk, soaked raisins in boiling water for 10 minutes, used 12 slices of bread instead of 10, added melted butter to milk mixture, did not heat milk, put in a 9 x 13 pan, soaked for 20 minutes before baking, baked for 40 minutes. I made a whiskey sauce from “bread pudding with whiskey sauce” recipe to put on it. (½  cup white sugar, ½  cup butter, ½ cup heavy cream, ¼ cup whiskey, warm over low heat stirring constantly.) The whiskey sauce and bread pudding were both warm when served and just delicious together!

I made this for a Ladies Social and had several ladies ask for the recipe.  Only change I made was I used "Texas Toast" bread & used only 8 slices.  It was so yummy!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Wow this is tasty!  I made a couple changes but nothing to alter the recipe.  I used day old cinnamon bread so I omitted the cinnamon and used fresh cranberries instead of the raisins (about 1 1/2 cups).  It is really tasty and I let it brown a little on top as that is how we like it!  I will make this again and might experiment with the fruits and flavorings.  I want to try a rum flavored bread pudding next time.

I recently had bread pudding for this 1st time in new orleans with a whiskey(?) sauce and it was so delicious I had to try to make it at home. It reminds me of the flavor of french toast. I halved the recipe because we're a family of three, and still had to put it in a 1.5 quart dish, which I would go larger next time because mine came out somewhat mushy, even after baking for 35min. I also used white bread and apple cinnamon bread, and no raisins. Overall good, but may try a different recipe next time.

Delicious. My wife made it so I actually don't know how difficult it was. I do know she said it was really easy, without complications and was fantastic. The only thing different was she used currants instead of rasins and soaked them first so they would plump up.

Mighty fine pudding! My brother visited from the mainland this week. He hasn't had bread pudding sense our mom pasted away. So I made this recipe. Jim was really happy with it and had I used raisins instead of dried cranberries it would have tasted just like what Mom used to make many years ago! I did add a little extra cinnamon and sugar to the top just before baking.

This is a really simple yet fantastic recipe! I doubled the cinnamon and added extra nutmeg as well.  I also left out the raisins, since I didn't have any, and used a peach instead!  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still sweet enough.  For the bread I used challah, which seemed perfect. Very good recipe, highly recommended.

This made me the life of the party!  I hardly ever cook but I brought this to two pot lucks because I had some stale bread and sour milk.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar the first time and it was great.  The second time I used 3/4 cup organic maple sugar and it tied in with the cinnamon and raisins quite nicely!  This is an easy and tasty recipe for any occasion.

This is by far the best bread pudding recipe I have tried!  I left out the rasins for the picky eaters in the family, but I don't think it hurt the recipe one bit.  This is a definate keeper!  Thanks!

I made this recipe for my grandparents because my grandpa loves sweets.  I myself am not a big fan of bread pudding but I rated this a 5 because EVERY time I go visit (at least 3 days a week) I have to hear about this bread pudding.  Needless to say for someone who does not care for bread pudding, I make this very very often!  They swear it is the best bread pudding they have ever eaten in their lives, and they are in their late 80s! :)

I made this recipe with a few changes.  I only used 4 eggs, and I substituted dried cranberries for raisins and added some white chocolate chips.  It turned out really well.  Will definitely make again.

I have never had or made bread pudding before and was stunned by how yummy this was! I did use some leftover whole wheat cinnamon raisin bread for part of the bread. But even my friends who did know what bread pudding is supposed to taste like loved this!

Changed this a little. I used cinnamon raisin bread (no need to add raisins), 5 eggs (all I had),1/2c brown sugar,1/4 c white sugar, no salt, 2 cups milk and I warmed the milk didn't scald it. The cinnamon,nutmeg,vanilla, and butter I kept the same.  Cooked it in a water bath. My hubby loved it. I usually follow the recipe exactly the first time but my bf told me her recipe so I mixed the two recipes. (Mine is better) Thanks for a great starter.

I made this last night for the first time, and my husband loved it!  He said it reminded him of french toast but better.  The only changes I would make are to add a little bit more cinnamon and maybe one less egg.  But even without those changes, delicious!

I thought this was pretty good.  I've only made Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding before so I've never had the original version.  I thought this was really yummy.  Definitely more of a breakfast food.  I liked it served with milk.  I didn't use raisins because my husband doesn't like them.  Although, I think adding apples or something would have given it a little more interest.  I was worried that it would be to eggy (I don't care for eggy custards) but it wasn't.

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using french bread.  I used 1/2 a loaf and which filled an 8x8 baking dish nicely.  Will definately make again!

Beautiful golden bread pudding; perfect moisture.  I microwaved the raisins (+ craisins and prunes) in rum-water for a minute before adding it in, so it'd be plump.

I have made this many times now and our company really enjoys it!! My husband can't have seeds, so I was very excited to find seedless raisins as I double the amount of raisins in recipe. Only because we like them so much. This bread pudding tastes so much like the one in a restaurant I worked in and it was always my favorite! Thank you for sharing! :)

This recipe sounds exactly like my mother's recipe but the prep is a little different in that I toast the slices of bread until they are slightly golden, then I butter both sides of each piece and then cut the pieces in half either down the middle or on the diagonal and place them in the buttered baking dish layered like shingles on a roof, then I pour the other stuff over it as is stated in this recipe.  I'm going to make this tonight, but I already know how good it is so I gave it 5 stars.

My VERY picky husband loved this! I used 4 cups of 1" cubes of Costco dinner rolls. Once bread was wet with egg mixture, I let the 2qt glass bowl sit on the hot oven exhaust for 10 min before backing. Or time while heating water for bath in oven. Baked 375 for 25 min. Took it out of the oven & realized it was still raw on the bottom after cooling an hour. Spooned pudding from the bottom on top to soften bread and further baking. Placed back in the oven at 300 for 10 min covered and then uncoverd 20 minutes longer. Made vanilla sauce (from website). No complaints & making again!

AWESOME!  I usually use whatever bread I have on hand, sometimes a little of my banana bread or friendship bread or even oatmeal raisin cookies.  Then I serve it with Rum Sauce. It's my most requested dessert!

fantastic!!!  i made this with leftover hot dog buns, and even accidentally added the melted butter to the milk mixture and it still turned out perfectly.  next time i will sprinkle with brown sugar, or mix in some white chocolate chunks.  this was my first time making bread pudding and it turned out perfect.
