WOW, these are fantastic! I had no fresh garlic (I KNOW!), so I subbed some granulated garlic powder, and that was fine. Also, I used dried chives b/c that's what I had on hand, but I can't wait to try these w/ fresh. We are deviled egg people, and these are a keeper, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this recipe evening for Easter. My guinea pig (husband) was made to try them. The recipe is a keeper. Can't wait for the rest of the family to try them. By the way I do not eat them. I don't eat a lot of the things I cook. I just love to cook to please. Never make it my job though. I will stick to antique furniture restoration.

These were pretty good.  The cream cheese gave this a very crwmy texture.  It was a nice change.

I followed this recipe's ingredients exactly and these were the best deviled eggs that I have ever eaten!   The only modifications that I made were that I added two more yolks and two less tablespoons of the cream cheese.  Oh, and one more dash of Franks.  Mmmm...

I've made this a few times, my husband and I love Deviled Eggs and often times just have a couple to accompany our salad for dinner.  The first time I made them was the first time I have ever added cream cheese to deviled eggs.  But you learn something new everyday!  A couple of pluses for me are the ease now in which these can be made, one; is using the Instant Pot for cooking the eggs so those shells just slide right off, the second; is using the cream cheese. I like piping the mixture for a prettier look and the cream cheese gives it body so it can be made ahead and will keep it's shape.  One change I did make to the over all recipe was to omit the garlic entirely, the cream cheese and chive has enough flavor from the onion family.
