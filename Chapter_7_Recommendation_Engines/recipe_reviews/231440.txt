An addendum to my review.  I found that if you use high quality powdered milk, it's better.  I bought Carnation, which was very fine powder, and it worked the best with this recipe.  Buying cheap generic store brand powdered milk, which tends to be more granular, doesn't work as well.

Looking for something to put in spaghetti sauce jars I've been saving all year for Christmas gifts and choose hot cocoa.  After looking at lots of recipes and comments, I chose this one because of its simplicity and preference not to use powdered creamers (unhealthy and full of ).  Unfortunately, the cocoa tastes much better with the powdered creamer.  However, it can be made as is, and then add real half-and-half to the cocoa when making it. I increased the sugar to 1-1/2 cups, increased the cocoa powder to 2/3 cup, and added 2 cups powdered creamer.  I also blended all the ingredients in a food processor to make more refined.  Next I'm going to try a batch and add crushed up candy canes while in the food processor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for my boys this morning and they loved it! It wasn't too sweet (like most mixes we have) and was great for a rainy, cold morning. Will make again!

Very good and easy! I took note of what a previous reviewer said about cheaper powdered milk being more granular, and since the cheap stuff is what I had on hand, I put the dry milk in the blender first and made it into a nice, fine powder. Then I blended the rest of the ingredients in with it (I also used powdered sugar instead of granulated). My husband usually turns up his nose at homemade cocoa mix, but I think with the smooth texture of this method he might actually approve (and hooray for going without the artificial sweeteners and other garbage they hide in the store-bought stuff!)

I really try to follow directions exactly then if my personal preference differs adjust. The recipe prepared as written is indeed wonderfully chocolatey but I needed to adjust to suit me by adding another 1/2 cup powered milk. That made the beverage perfect for me, perfect relation sweet and chocolate to the milk. I absolutely concur I do want chemical other stuff in my hot cocoa, thank you so much for sharing.

We use milk to make our hot cocoa, so I decreased the powdered milk to 1 packet (roughly 1 1/4C).  I also increased the cocoa and sugar to 1C each. We use 2 heaping spoonfuls per mug of hot milk. Fantastic!

This is a yummy recipe. I didn't have high quality dry milk but once i mixed it all together i put it in the food processor until it got very powdery and it was easier to dissolve. I used about 3 tablespoons of it in an medium sized mug.

This is a good alternative to the store brands, just simple ingredients.    It works better if blend the dry ingredients in the blender. The milk powder will dissolve better when you make the hot chocolate.

Easy and great to have a mix that is on hand.  It needs a bit of vanilla to boost the flavor.

Made as directed.  I liked it a lot; partially because it tasted great, and partially because it has just four simple ingredients.  I use it mostly with coffee.

This is such a good recipe.  I replaced the powder milk with powder creamer and it made this so much more creamier.  I also like my cocoa rich tasting so I added 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa.

We enjoy this very much.  I add a little more cocoa and put it all in a blender or food processor to completely mix into "store bought" consistency.

This was too bland for my taste. I added an additional 1/4 cup cocoa powder and 1/4 cup sugar and it was better, but still not as chocolaty as I like it.

This was a great base, but I made a few tweaks. I mixed 2 cups of dry milk with 1 cup dry goat milk, doubled the sugar and doubled the coco. I also used demerara organic sugar that I ground into a fine power in a coffee grinder. Using the organic sugar and goat milk give it a more "homey" flavor

This works really well, I like using less sugar, and it works well with splenda, too. I've found that using a flour sifter makes a finer, easier to blend mix.

This recipe needed a lot of tweeking. It wasn't  sweet enough and didn't have much of a chocolate flavor. I added 1 cup more of cocoa powder and about 1.5 cups of powdered sugar and used 1/2 cup mix per 1 cup of water or milk instead of a 1/4 cup as recipe said.  It was a big improvement

I made this for Christmas gifts (included a small bag of marshmallows and some candy canes).  Everyone loved it!   I added some cinnamon to the mix as a bonus.

So Yummy!  I read the reviews and used 1 1/4 c of the cocoa, 4 cups of the powdered milk, No Salt, and 1/2 c of Truvia Cane Sugar Blend. Very chocolaty and the perfect sweetness. Obviously a LOT fewer calories and of course No Sodium. :-)  Oh yes, I threw it all into the food processor to mix and create a fine powder that dissolved so easily.

Made this as is and it’s great!  I did put all ingredients in my Ninja to grind up fine.  If you like it sweeter, you may want to add more sugar.  My daughter LOVES this hot cocoa ;)

This recipe is actually really great, and I like it as it is, although I did add extra cocoa. But my kids kept complaining about it not being sweet enough, and I ended up doing something based on this but not the same anymore.

The packet of instant dried milk that used was 3.2 oz. I measured that, and it was ~ 1 1/4 cups. I scaled down the recipe to 7 servings to be close to that amount. I also used confectioners sugar in place of white. After reading reviews, I put all of the ingredients in my mini-processor, gave it a whirl, and got a nice, powdery mix.  I could not wait, made a half a cup of cocoa and found it could be sweeter. I then sifted more confect sugar and just added it to the rest. Looking forward to a cup later. UPDATE 2/9/18: Even with the added sugar, it still wasn't sweet enough. It seems confect sugar doesn't carry the same sweetness as regular.

It's a good recipe to start off with. I cut the dry milk powder in half and added buttermilk powder. Change the ratios to your liking. I also put everything in a bowl and whisk mix it. Then I use a big sieve to really sift the ingredients together. It's important to do that.

Personnally, it was terrible.  I had to add like, 3-4 more cups of the cocoa and sugar to get it so that we would drink it. Generally  hated it as a cocoa,  works as coffee creamer though.

An excellent mix for anyone, but especially those of us that shudder at the word "Non-dairy creamer"  ugh...
  Made this as original, and then branched off and made it with organic black cocoa and a sugar/stevia mix.  Awesome.  Added a 1/2 tsp of chipotle pepper and 2tsp cinnamon.. Rave reviews!!
   My thanks (and from thos ewho are still asking me to make it again) to teh creator of this recipe! :)

This was kindoff flavourless so I added additional cocoa, sugar and crushed some dark chocolate chips that I had. So much better!
