4-22-2016   ~This was a nice, fluffy, substantial biscuit; as I expected them to be since this is a Bisquick biscuit mix recipe.  However, the first taste was a mini-assault of garlic and salt.  The salt isn’t necessary at all, and half the amount of garlic powder would be a big improvement. (I could taste it hours later)   I found using a 1/4 cup measure was exactly the amount needed to evenly produce eight biscuits, however, these eight biscuits were unnecessarily large.  If I were to make these again I would make them a little smaller, perhaps for a total of one dozen, more reasonably sized biscuits.  Also, watch the baking time closely!  I pulled mine from the oven at 15 minutes – any longer and they would have looked like a baking mishap!  Addendum:  For what it's worth, Hubs disagrees with me on the garlic powder and salt, believing both are fine just as is.

How does something so simple taste so heavenly?!?  This recipe is perfection, I do not change a thing!  I loved the hint of Old Bay, in our house Old Bay makes everything better!

Amazing recipe! Only thing I do differently is use a little less salt.

This recipe does not render properly on the AllRecipes app for iPhone 8. There are no headings for “Topping” and “Biscuits”, so I had to go to the website to figure that out. Great recipe, however.

These were unbelievably good!  I honestly wasn't expecting much - just wanted a quick biscuit to go with salmon chowder BUT they stole the show!  The only thing I changed was that I didn't add salt to the topping mixture as I had used salted butter - perfect.

These were delicious! Only thing I did different was to add a little garlic powder & Old Bay Seasoning to the biscuit mix as well as the topping mix, just a dash or two!

Simple and incredibly flavorful! 
My husband- who is something of a bread connoisseur lol- thought they were even better than the ones from Red Lobster. There is more depth of flavor. Only thing I changed was putting a shake or two of Old Bay in the dough as well as in the topping. Oh, and I used fresh parsley in the dough instead of dried in the topping.

Don't change a thing!  Though, for the topping, if you just soften rather than melt the butter, each person can put on as much as they like (with a knife instead of a brush) and it makes leftovers better.

Made these many times, so delicious! I use my Pampered Chef large scoop and they come out perfect. I use fresh parsley and go a little easy on the salt.

I mixed the toppings in with biscuit mix, baked it in muffin tins, & it tasted really good! Hubby loves them! It yielded 12 mini muffins for me. Oh! I also added a little dill weed.

Biscuits were a little too dry. Could be  because I used a basic muffin recipe instead of  Bisquick. The flavor was amazing. I will try again!

I love these biscuits but had to tweak the recipe. Had to double the old bay seasoning and garlic. omitted the bisquick mix, and used the ez-drop biscuit recipe and baked them for 18mns in a muffin pan. they came out great.

These turn out so good! I made them in two days using the recipe as it is and then made my own bisque mix. They both just like the ones you get at the restaurant. If you don't know how to make your own baking mix, here's the recipe I use for that:

I mixed these up quick and easy. 
I ended up with 9 biscuits instead of 8.
Only thing I did differently was I used shredded taco blend cheese since that's what I had on hand, cut back on the salt and instead of using 1/3 cup butter for the topping, I used 1/4 cup since that's what I had left over from making the dough. I couldn't see adding more from another stick. 

Made these to go along with a hearty ham and bean soup, I don't think my husband will complain.

These biscuits are identical to the ones we get at our favorite seafood restaurant. My husband loves them. I made the recipes exactly as written only cut it in half because there is just the two of us. I could have cut the amount of topping in half again. I brushed the tops generously twice and still had at least half of the topping left over.

I've made these biscuits many times. The recipe is right on the side of the bisquick box. The only thing I did differently was the salt. I only use a pinch because 1/4 tsp. made it too salty the first time I made them. Otherwise they came out fabulous.
