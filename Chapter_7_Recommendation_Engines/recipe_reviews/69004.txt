Very easy to fix, don't be scared by the ingredients list.  However, don't use all white meat ground chicken or you will have dry sausages!  I used a loaf of wheat french bread.

It was really good! It was really bright and appealing looking, and smelled and tasted great! I would add less parsley though, as it was a little strong, but overall pretty good.
