Yummy! I think the sugar could be reduced because of the cinnamon, but it wasn't too sweet.

This recipe is wonderful! I had a Mexican Hot Cocoa at a local coffee shop and was thrilled to find this recipe! It tastes wonderful!

I made this recipe last year for a Christmas party and I am just now writing the review on this wonderful cocoa! Sorry. Everyone that tasted this cocoa last year absolutely loved it. I myself wasn't too sure about adding the cinnamon but it gave it an absolutely delightful taste. Another thing that is great about this recipe is it can be tinkered with to suit your own tastes so easily. Try it, you will like it!
