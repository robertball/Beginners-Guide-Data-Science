This is a classic! I mean what's not to like -anytime you have chocolate chips combined with nuts and coconut it's bound to be good.  And, there's really virtually nothing you can do to mess it up. It's straightforward and all the ingredients come together to compliment each other. I crushed my graham crackers by putting them into a ziploc bag and going over them with a rolling pin. I used a throw away baking tin to bake these in that I sprayed with a little Pam so nothing would stick. I followed the recipe exactly using chopped walnuts for the nuts as that's what I had on hand. These were so easy and oh so delectable! Ya just gotta love Ghirardelli chocolate!

My mom makes these every year, but only during the holiday season. They always go fast at our house. The only thing we do differently is use cornflake crumbs instead of graham cracker crumbs. It cuts the sweetness a little bit and makes them just right!

I have made these cookies for over 30 years. (With whatever brand chocolate chips I have on hand.)  They are so easy, and totally addictive. The condensed milk, combined with the real butter, holds it all together and imparts a lovely caramel undertone to the whole concoction. For best taste, use real butter. Delicious, easy cookie recipe!

Two suggestions that I love:  1) replace half the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips and 2) cut into large squares, top with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzle with caramel and chocolate sauce... looks amazing and has always gotten great comments from our dinner guests.

Very easy, almost TOO easy for how good they are!  I made 1/4 recipe in a loaf pan, which made 8 squares.  Used cinnamon grahams and did half semi-sweet chunks & half Heath chunks and used salted sunflower seeds instead of nuts.  SUPER YUMMY!!!

I made these just the other day for a city swim meet where I serve about 300 people in the course of a weekend.  They disappear faster than any other baked good offered throughout the weekend!  If you are not a coconut lover, YOU WILL BE!

My mom made these all the time when I was growing up (we called them Hello Dollies) and now I make them for my family as well.  They are easy and delicious!  Very rich, so we cut them into small bite sized squares.

I did not have graham cracker crumbs, but had the chocolate crackers which I ended up using.  OMG...these are absolutely delicious. I call these a "Premium" brownie.  The coconut is an added crunch. They disappeared in no time.  I will again make these with the chocolate crackers.  Probably the graham crackers are just as good, but when I am totally satisfied with a recipe, I like to stick to it.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

Delicious! I made an error by forgetting to firmly pushing down on the cookies, so they are a little loosely packed, but the taste is unaffected! Will make again. I used peanuts (unsalted) -- worked out great.

I read all reviews and made the recipe exact. It looked delicious but it seems 1 1/2 cups of graham crack crumbs wasn't enough and 14 oz of sweetened condensed milk was too much. They were gooey and mushy on the bottom.

These are good but I will lessen the chocolate chips and add some butterscotch next time! Then it will be fantastic!

Very good, very easy. I'd use less butter, maybe half, next time. I did use less coconut (1 C), less nuts (0.5 C), less chocolate (1 C), and I added toffee bits (1 C). I was hoping the bottom layer would caramelize a bit more.

These were very tasty and so easy to make!  They were a hit at the summer potluck picnic I brought them to.  I used a cup of graham cracker crumbs since I wanted a thicker crust and a few butterscotch chips on top just for taste.  I will make these again soon!

I LOVE this recipe!!!  I have followed it to the letter in the past but recently have made the following changes:  
I use about 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs and put the crackers in the blender...it saves your arm and its quick:)
I also increase the coconut to 1 3/4cup
1/2cup white chocolate chips
1/2cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
1 cup peanut butter chips
SO GOOD!!!  Another variation I use is the same changes w/ crumbs and coconut but use
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup butterscotch chips
Also, very good, but I prefer the peanut butter one;)  This recipe is very easy to fool around with so try your own variations, you pretty much can't go wrong!  I have also added a tsp. of vanilla extract to the condensed milk and that is great as well:)  Have fun and post your variations for all of us to try!!!

Delicious!  Made half the batch with coconut, and the other half without.  Mine was a bit soggy, so I guess I needed to keep it in the oven longer for the milk to harden some, but it still was AWESOME!  A keeper!

The end result was delicious. Instead of the nuts, I just substituted a cup of butterscotch chips and mint chips (I made two pans). I found they were nearly impossible to get out of the pan - almost need to be a body builder to get them out! I will probably try greasing the pans next time I bake these to see if it makes them any easier to get out...

I would decrease slightly the chocolate chips and add about 3/4 cup of butterscotch chips. This is a wonderful bar cookie, very sweet.

I just made these cookies for a cookie swap and they were a hit! They were also so easy to make. I will definitely make these again and again. I added dried cranberries to give it some extra sweetness and texture and also used a combination of Ghirardelli semi-sweet and milk chocolate chocolate chips. I also used a bit more graham cracker crumbs to give it more of a crisp on the bottom.

Delicious and incredibly rich! ...I don't care for coconut or nuts (i know, there's something wrong with me) so I didn't add any, wish I had. Next time I'll for sure try coconut. Still delicious without, I have to wonder if doubling the graham crackers would help cut down on the richness....either way, SO EASY! Be sure to grease your pan!

These are yummy, but the recipe is a little confusing in that it is not clear as to the order you should add the chips, coconut and nuts.  not it makes a difference though.  Next time I make it I willadd the chips after the milk and the cocnut last.  I give it a 4

This was a good recipe, however theres a few things I had issues with, first in Canada our condensed milk is labeled by mL not FLOZ. and its 300 mL cans which is less than 14 fl oz but two would be too much. Also way too much chocolate on it for us so next time would half that, other than that it was very good, used walnuts as our nuts and liked those. 1 1/3 cup of coconut is way too much I dont even think i used a full cup and it was more than enough.

I made mine a little different, I wanted to cut down on some of the sugar. Not a big fan of sweetened condensed milk -- it's just TOO sweet. However, this is the glue that holds it altogether. Here's what I did: for the crust I used 1 stick of melted butter and 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs, combined in a bowl and pressed into my 9x13 sprayed with non-stick spray pan, then I drizzled the sweeten condensed milk down the length of the pan and again width wise. I probably used no more than half the can. Then I proceeded to add my walnuts, MINI chocolate chips, and coconut. After each new addition I pressed them down into the crust. I didn't measure the nuts, chocolate chips, or coconut...just sprinkled an even layer with each. I chose mini chocolate chips because I felt they would stick better. I baked it for 25 min. I allowed them to finish cooling in the fridge. I cut them an hour or so later and they cut nice. They hold up well! So you don't have to use the WHOLE can of milk. I want it to be sweet but not overly sweet.

This is one of my all time favorite treat recipes and the go to dessert in our house because we always keep the ingredients on hand. The only time I actually measured was the first time I made it; once you have the butter, graham crackers, and sweetened condensed milk down you can just throw whatever you want on top. Any combo of nuts, chips, candy pieces, marshmallows, etc will work. I just eyeball the amounts until it all looks good, and we've never had a result that everyone didn't love.

I make these all the time. They are my Pappy's favorite. He is in the hospital right now with bone cancer and failing kidneys and asked that I make these again and bring them up. Making them again right now...with an extra cup of love.

I made these according to the instructions given they were excellent. They held together well. After reading other comments I was careful to press the topping ingredients down into the bottom layer quite well.

I haven't tried this particular recipe myself, but my cousin makes these EVERY Christmas, they always disappear without fail, I had to fight her sister's fiance' just to get some for my mother they disappeared in less then five minutes after my cousin arrived at my aunt's house. They are SO good, I avoided them for years until recently because I hadn't been a big coconut fan... But with age comes wisdom. I have SEEN THE LIGHT! Long live coconut and long live "Magic Squares"!

A great bar cookie for any time of year, but a tradition for our family at Christmas. This year my husband is going to be traveling on his birthday so I made these as his birthday treat and packed him a container to take on his trip.

I made these for Teacher Appreciation Day at my daughter's school, and took some to work to share with my co-workers, who were very happy that I did so. I had made a double batch, and I'm glad I did, because the first batch I had forgotten to grease the baking dish and they stuck pretty badly. I put that batch in the fridge in hopes it would loosen them up (it did) and remembered to grease the second dish, which turned out fine. The only change I made was using chopped pecans instead of walnuts (not a fan) and they were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Will definitely be making more, especially during the holidays. Two thumbs up!

I had a can of condensed milk and not sure what to do with it, so I found this recipe and got very excited.  I even bought graham crackers so I could make it. I love all the ingredients separately but it just didn't come together for me.  I think the condensed milk flavor was off-putting after being baked.  Not the worst thing I ever tasted, but didn't make me go "yum" and I definitely will not make again.

YUMMM!  I made these omitting the nuts and coconut (allergies) but since it's fall I mixed 1/2 cup pumpkin and some pumpkin pie spice into the the evaporated milk before pouring onto grahams.  So delish!

This is an old recipe that I have from the '60s that was called Hello Dollies.  It has always been a family favorite and I am sure the use of Ghiradelli chocolate verses regular chocolate chips just adds to the deliciousness.
