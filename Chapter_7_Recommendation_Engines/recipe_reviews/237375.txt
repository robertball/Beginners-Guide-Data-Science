I liked this and will make it again. I couldn't find paleo Italian sausage so used paleo chicken sausage. I really liked the lemon and red pepper flavoring. 

I did add some water to the pan when I added the broccoli rabe, and a lid, so that the broccoli rabe would steam and cook faster.

Thank you for trying my recipe from mangiapaleo.com. Glad you enjoyed it. I agree with Carla that it would be nice to have with pasta but unfortunately that's not paleo. Try spaghetti squash or zucchini noodles! :) Mangia! - Laura

The flavor was really good, but I thought this would have been better served with Pasta or Rice.  The Broccoli Raab really shrinks down as it cooks.

I really didn't like this one because the lemon was way too strong.

It was super easy and super delicious.  I didn't change anything. I served it with a side of quinoa which went nicely. Maybe try some red pepper flakes for an extra kick.

I didn't have broccoli rabe so I used spinach instead and it came out GREAT! A good paleo option! The sausage really gives the spinach a rich flavor.
