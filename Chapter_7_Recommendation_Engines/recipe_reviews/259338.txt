This turned out nicely. We ate it over baked salmon. I used tarragon and white pepper for the spices, half and half instead of heavy cream. It was still quite thick of a sauce.

I added garlic and deglazed  with sherry, like someone suggested.  Also used a little more butter.  Delicious.

Good, but would deglaze pan of mushrooms/shallots with dry sherry before adding cream. I also added minced garlic to the shallot/mushroom saute.

This recipe is delicious...first and foremost!
The photo shows sliced mushrooms, not finely diced. Our cream sauce never was creamy, but buttery in nature. So, slice next time and turn down the heat to keep the sauce in place.

I didn't use the flour water mix, the cream is enough. Delicious over rice.
