Excellent.  I was looking for a chicken salad recipe similar to one at a favorite local restaurant, and with a few minor additions it was just right.  I used reduced-fat mayo and added a tbsp of fat-free Greek yogurt.  I also threw in some toasted pecans and Craisins.  I will make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!  I have enough for leftovers which I will enjoy. It took me a bit longer to make this but I'm slow and don't chop food up very quickly. I cooked the orzo a tad too long but it was still OK. I didn't have curry powder and used some chili powder with some cumin instead. It worked for me.
