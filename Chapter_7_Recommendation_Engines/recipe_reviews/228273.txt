Yum!  Very tasty!  I made my own self-rising flour using the recipe here on AR (1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 cup all-purpose flour).  I used semisweet chocolate chips for the chocolate, and had it been for me rather than my granddaughters, I would have used a bittersweet chocolate bar cut into chunks.  I used the whole 6-oz container of raspberries in the mix.  This was very yummy!   Thanks for the recipe!

I just made my first batch of these tonight, even though the submitter of this recipe said to wait until they cool before cutting, sorry but my hubby and i could not wait, it was heavenly biting into these wonderful brownies!! since raspberry season just wrapped up here in Nova Scotia i didn't have fresh raspberries so i threw in frozen and i tell you there was no difference, i just took them out of the freezer and into the bowl and they were not juicy at all, in fact i think frozen ones are better as they don't break apart while you stir them in, everything else i followed to the letter, so all you chocolate lovers go ahead and try this with the raspberries you will not be disappointed!!!

These were very good! I used regular sugar b/c that's all I had and followed Marianne, and made my own self-rising flour. I may have used a bit more raspberries and chocolate chunks than called for too, lol! These smelled great while baking and the flavor was wonderful. I would def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Mmmm good brownies! Decadent and very rich! One small piece was enough for us! I've always loved the combo of raspberries and chocolate together so I had to try this. I used semi sweet chocolate chips and extra raspberries. It wasn't until I was reviewing the recipe that I noticed I only used one stick of butter instead of one cup but I don't think it affected the recipe at all and we don't need the extra calories,  so next time I'm only going to use 1 stick of butter add 1/4 tsp of almond extract and try to reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and see how it goes... We'll definitely make again! Thanks.

I made these for a family get together and got rave reviews.  People came back for seconds and thirds!  I didn't have any self-rising flour on hand so I used the substitution that Marianne suggested in the reviews. The substitution recipe for self-rising flour is also on this website.  I also substituted frozen raspberries for the fresh. No need to defrost. Baking time was 35 minutes using a 9 x13 inch baking pan.

I used dark chocolate cocoa and butter (rather than margarine).  I was worried the butter would affect the texture, but wow, these were amazing!!!  My husband responded that I could make these anytime I wanted. :)

Five stars for the recipe as it is.  It couldn't be simpler.  I would give it a bonus star for the addition I made:  I drizzled raspberry syrup over the top of the mix before baking, making a swirl.  It added a perfect raspberry finish.

EXCELLENT flavour and texture with the raspberries and chocolate chunks.  These were a big hit with my kids and the pan was empty the same day.  Thanks to previous reviewer Marianne, I also made my own self rising flour ….don't be shy with the chocolate and raspberries…delicious!

I'm always a bit skeptical of less tried recipes, but these really proved themselves. My family just could not stop eating them! I used Marianne's formula for self rising flour by adding 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder to 1 cup all-purpose flour (thanks Marianne!), regular sugar (not exactly sure what was meant by "superfine sugar"), semisweet chocolate chips, and about 2/3 a cup of fresh raspberries. They finished baking just under 40 minutes and they were perfect! I will definitely make these again.

This is wonderful.  I made it as the recipe calls for except for putting the berries in the bowl of batter.  I had fresh berries and didn't want them all mashed up.  So I spread half the batter in the pan then put the berries on,  then spooned the rest of the batted over the berries.  Everyone loved this recipe.

My only adjustment was to add a teaspoon of pure vanilla. I've made the recipe twice now. I do find that the squares are extremely tender due to the moisture content from the raspberries and will fall apart. These are an excellent base for a brownie sundae, if you're of a mind. If I had a restaurant, I'd be offering raspberry brownie sundaes as a summer treat.

These brownies came out perfect.  I substituted the margarine for unsalted butter, and I used coconut sugar instead of ultrafine.  Also, I used regular flour and added baking powder.  For the chocolate chunks I used enjoy life allergy friendly mini chocolate chips! I cooked fir for about 35 minutes in my 13x9 le cruset stoneware and they were fully cooked inside with a slight crispy top. Easy to make in one bowl with the hand mixer, I will definitely make them again!

These were very good. I couldn't stay out of the batter! I cut the recipe in half and used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of 1. As I didn't have chocolate chunks on hand, I used semisweet chips. I used an 8x8 pan which worked just fine. The brownies were a little more cakey than I like my brownies. I wish they were a bit more chewy and dense but was pleasantly surprised with the flaky top. The flavor was all there but I'm rating it just at 4 due to personal brownie preferences.

Big hit!  Used full sugar (didn't seem TOO sweet but I may alter it in the future), frozen berries and the leavening combination listed.  Rose up nice and fluffy and delicious!

Great moist brownie recipe! I made my own self-rising flour, cut sugar to 1-1/2 cups granulated and used real butter. I will be using this recipe in the future w/ nuts for the raspberries which I don't usually have on hand.

Good recipe! Tweaked by using less sugar, 1C, as my cocoa was sweetened. Also used raw chocolate nibs & fresh raspberries. Definitely a keeper!

I made these for Valentine's Day for my office and they were a TREMENDOUS hit.  They are perfect - fudgy and moist in the middle and crunchy on the top.  Beautiful flavor and a real crowd-pleaser.  Huge win.

I had to increase the baking time (9X12 pan) an additional net 20 minutes to get the pick to come out clean.  Just keep an eye on it.  

Used butter instead of margarine (1 cup) and 12 oz of raspberries per other reviewers saying more raspberry would work; the ratio worked out fantastically. 

I also had leftover tiny semi-sweet chocolate chips, so I sprinkled some on top before baking.  Nice aesthetic touch.

DELICIOUS!  I made with the self-rising flour recipe as submitted by another reviewer (1 c flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder and .5 tsp salt) - only used 1/2 cup of Earth Balance - added about a tablespoon of vegetable oil to make sure there was enough moisture.  Baked in a 9x13 glass (Pyrex) baking sheet, and it took 46 minutes to be done in the middle.

07.15.17 ~ Wow, what a RICH brownie.  My husband loved them!  I found a container of raspberries in the freezer so I thawed and drained them before folding in.  The raspberries added another layer of flavor to delicious brownie.  Plus......it was a great way for me to use up the raspberries and get another container our of our freezer.  I added a light dusting of powered sugar to the top as I usually do this with all brownies, because my grandma did.  This recipe is definitely company worthy.

I wasn't sure how these brownies would turn out, but I've gotta say they're yummy. I too used flour, baking powder and salt, as well as folding in frozen raspberries--probably double the amount--at the end. It took a little longer in a 13 X 9 pan. I want to make them again.

Followed recipe exactly, but put in a 9x9 on accident. They were SUPER yummy,  but I think next time more raspberries- I added a pint this time.  Crunchy on top, moist & tasty on the inside!

This is my favorite brownie recipe. I was looking for something to do with the raspberries that were growing in my backyard and this was the perfect solution. The brownie itself  was perfect and the raspberries made them a little lighter. Delightful dessert. I did change a few things, however. I used regular flour instead and added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. I also used 1 cup of butter instead of margarine. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

These were amazing! I made them for a coworker's birthday and they were a definite hit! They were kind of gooey and fudgy, which was exactly how I like my brownies.  I made my own self rising flour was suggested by Marianne and that worked well. I used dark chocolate chips instead of chocolate chunks and that was delicious. Unfortunately I just couldn't wait until they were fully cooled to cut into them, so they looked like a mess and tasted like heaven. I will definitely be making these again!

We liked it!  I might even use a few more raspberries the next time I make these...although, they are great as is.  A great combo...chocolate and raspberry!

Loved these! I did need to make slight adjustments as I live at 9,oo0 foot elevation. I added 1 Tbsp of raspberry liquor. And as I only had butter not margarine I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil. Baking at elevation is always hit and miss and these hit the mark!

This was okay on it's own. It turned out really cake-y and not fudge-y. I wanted to serve it as a really high-end looking dessert, so what I did was drizzle the plate with white chocolate, place a piece of brownie on the plate, add some raspberry sauce and then drizzle with dark chocolate. Add a squirt of homemade vanilla whipping cream or vanilla ice cream.
I got lots of great feedback from my guests on this one, but only with all the extra garnishes.

I made these because I was given fresh garden raspberries and didn't want them to go waste. I made these for work. But also made a few in cupcake form without the raspberries for my husband. Just cook them for a less time as a cupcake.
I did not have self-rising flour, so I used the suggestion given on another review, that uses salt, baking powder, and regular flour.

According to everyone that tried them and myself, this was really really good. Not too strong with chocolate or raspberry. Not too sweet. The only thing I would have liked different, is if they set up to be thicker. When I cut them, the next day, they did not cut as square as I liked. But I wasn't trying to impress anyone with looks. haha

Oh. My. Gosh. This was so, so amazing. I can't believe how moist and delicious it was. I made my own self-rising flour per the reviews, just used regular sugar, used chocolate chips (not 'chunks'), used a 9x9 baking dish, and fresh raspberries from our backyard. We'll be making this one again and again every time raspberries are ripe!

Really good, standard brownie, that has me going back for more.  I increased the raspberries and still didn't think their flavor came through.

I also made my own "self rising" flour and Special Dark coco powder as others had recommended.  I used a mini muffin pan instead of a regular pan and put an extra 1/2 rasberry on the bottom prior to adding the batter.
