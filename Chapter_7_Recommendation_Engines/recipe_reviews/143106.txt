This was enough to feed two young men one half for each. I did add a little more mayonnaise than what was asked for as well as a few spices to the tuna mixture (onion powder garlic powder fresh ground black pepper) as well as a little chopped dill pickle. They LOVED these. They asked if I could make these again tomorrow. Tuna salad really is very personal everyone likes it their own special way.

Overall pretty good for a quick lunch but the tuna salad needed a little work. I added finely chopped onion and celery garlic powder salt pepper and dried parsley. I toasted the bagel first then topped it with the tuna salad sliced tomato then cheese and stuck it under the broiler until the cheese melted and got nice and bubbly.

Definitely a good idea but it needs some work. What I did is use an onion bagel that I toasted then mix the tuna mixture up and microwave that. I also added about twice as much Dijon then I put a piece of cheese on top of the bagel then the tuna mix then microwaved it for about 30 seconds. I finished it with some salt and coarsely-ground pepper.

6 oz of tuna turned out to be way too much for one serving. This should have been a 2 serving recipe. I cooked mine for a 10 minutes because it the tuna was not hot at the reccomended time. I also mixed some cheese in with the tuna mixutre as well as sprinkling with cheddar and mozz on top. I also added fresh tomato on top as well as pepper. This was not something to eat with your hands. You will need a fork if you make only one serving. 3 stars for the way written and 4 stars with my changes.

I've made a similar tuna melt for years and my family loves it. I usually add dried onions chopped pickles and sometimes chopped tomato along with the shredded cheese. Sometimes I add a little shredded cabbage (cole slaw mix) to give more nutrition and a little crunch. These are also great on toasted buns.

I left out the Dijon mustard because I didn't have any on hand. I added some sliced tomato between the tuna and the cheese and baked for 5 minutes. Quick easy and delicious!

I thought 6ozs was too much for 1 serving. Here's what I did. Halved the recipe and used a 3oz can of albacore tuna. Next I wanted to cut down on the mayo so I used 1tsp of plain yogurt 1tsp light ranch dressing and plain mustard. I didn't have cheddar so I used montery jack cheese. I didn't want to heat up the oven to 300 for 5 mins so I toasted the "mini" bagel then added the tuna fish mix with shredded cheese dash of salt and pepper on top and heated in the microwave on 20 seconds. A nice change of pace and very tasty.

These are great for fast meals. Not a lot of ingredients and super easy to throw together. I used the bagel thins instead of a full size bagel and it was perfect.

OMG these were so yummy. We tweaked it just a little bit because it was what I had but it was still yummy. Instead of bagels we used left over hamburger buns and instead of chedder we used colby jack. My kids 5 and 2 gobbled these up!!!

I only had a 12 oz can of tuna so I doubled everything. Made 2 giant melts out of it. I didnt put the tomato on until after I heated it up so it had that fresh taste to it. It was soooooo good!

Great recipe. I make this when we have company for lunch. Serve with fruit and it's a satisfying lunch.
