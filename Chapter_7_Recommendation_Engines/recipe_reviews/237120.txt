This is nice, but I tried one that used chicken broth instead of water this time and it was an improvement. Happy cooking!!!

I thought I didn't like enchilada sauce.  It turns out I don't like enchilada sauce from a can!  This sauce is so much better than canned, yet still not quite as good as a Mexican restaurant.  Thanks for a much tastier, yet still quick, alternative.

I've made this twice and I love it. I will be sticking with this recipe. I make it with chicken broth instead of water, but as prescribed otherwise.

I had to use tomato paste and two types of Mexican chili powder,  because that was what I had on hand. Better sauce than you can get at a Mexican restaurant.  LOVED IT!

I used butter ranther than oil for the base and I only had regular chili powder.   I added minced onions and garlic to the butter as it melted and cooked lightly.  This sauce was delicious and a big hit with my family!

My kids think every enchilada sauce is "too hot!", so I gave this one a try and it was a hit. My kids love it and request it often.

Made this tonight to pour over loaded chimichangas and it turned out perfect. It came together fast and tasted fresh instead of the aluminum taste of cans. I used homemade tomato paste with some extra water, and for our taste I added a tsp of sugar to cut the bitterness of the tomato and chili powder. Alterations aren't required though, to make a good sauce.

This was a help, as I live in Brazil and can’t buy canned sauce, but it was a little flat and lacking in something...not quite sure what.

I’ve learned it’s best to mix the chili powder and flour before you add to oil. Great recipe!

The only chilli power I had on hand was hot Indian chilli powder o_O
Needless to say, even though I used 1/2 the amount of chilli powder (1 tbs, not 2) I still had to double the rest of the ingredients!
I saved the sauce, but will deff try it again with "regular" chilli powder LOL!

I forgot to buy my usual enchilada canned sauce for my chicken enchiladas. So I made this sauce and wow, sooo easy and it tastes better than canned! I substituted chicken broth for the water as someone else suggested. This is a keeper!

I had stopped buying/making any dish with enchilada sauce (canned) as there was always an odd, unpleasant taste about the sauce I didn't enjoy.  This sauce is so much better. I didn't have onion salt so combined salt and onion powder. A little too salty that way, but my fault and I will adjust accordingly. Thanks for the recipe.

I used chicken broth instead of water, and I didn't have cumin or onion powder, but did use garlic powder, chili powder, oregano, brown sugar, salt and pepper and it came out amzeing! I spread over chimichangas and it  was  awesome!

Excellent recipe! Once the flour was browned I added the other dried spices into it  then added the tomato sauce and water (very slowly). I hate canned enchilada sauce so this was perfect  :)
I now use chicken or beef broth instead of water.

I'll never buy canned sauce again! this recipe was quick, easy, cheap, and tasty. I did not read the recipe closely, but I did find a recipe for making self rising flour out of AP flour on allrecipes. And I had no tomato sauce on hand so I used spicy tomato juice to sub for tomato sauce, water and chili powder. Still great

I will never buy enchilada sauce from a can again! I used tomato paste, chili powder I had on the rack and  chicken stock. 
My family loved it. They have already requested it again.

I thought it was excellent.  Although I've just made chicken enchilada for the first time.  I skipped the flour altogether though, as I have celiac disease, and don't think it was missing anything as a result.

I live in China where enchilada sauce is no where to be found so I was looking for an easy to make recipe that still has that's authentic taste and this recipe is pretty good. The only thing I changed was the Indian chili powder and only because I couldn't find any near by. I used Mexican chili powder from a local Mexican market I picked up in the States which is already seasoned a bit so it gave it even more flavor. I'm super happy with this recipe, I usually make a large batch and freeze it for later.

I love enchiladas, but rarely make them at home because I do not care for canned enchilada sauce. I decided it was time to try making it from scaratch...much to my surprise, it was quite easy! My family (including a very picky 10 year old), loved it! The changes I made were: I used chicken stock instead of water, used only 1tbsp regular chili powder (personal preference), and used 1/8 cup vegetable oi, and 1/8 cup butter. I will make it again, and will use the left overs for chimichangas tomorrow night!

Super easy and very tasty.  We pretty much inverted the water to tomato sauce ratio as we wanted a thicker, richer sauce, and it was just right.  Will definitely make again!

This is easy like it says and delicious! I used Ancho chili powder and Guajillo chili powder that I ordered especially for making this. I also won't be buying canned anymore! thanks for posting recipe.

Tripled the recipe since I had a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes- tripled all ingredients and used the 28 oz. can.... Used regular flour too- this is so easy to make and absolutely delicious! I have made this 4 times so far- I tried another recipe with chocolate and my husband hated it!! He loves this one- I don't think I will ever buy enchilada sauce again!! Thank you!! I used my triple batch with a Mexican lasagna type recipe  in which I layered veggie fillings in between corn tortillas with this sauce and cheese- soooo yummy! I have also made chicken enchiladas with this sauce!

Really delicious. I just used regular flour and had to add a bit of water as it was a bit chunky.

Wonderful! Just the right amount of spice and not overly salted
Doubled for my crowd and it was a big hit. No more canned sauce for us.

Everyone liked it. I felt like it was missing something, but I haven't figured out what yet. Maybe a squirt of lime juice? I'll try that next time.

Far superior to canned at a fraction of the cost.  Quick, easy and customizable -- prepared while getting the rest of my stuff assembled.  Thanks.  Won't buy canned again.

I tripled the recipe and used chicken broth instead of water.  We like hot so I used all chili powder as stated in recipe conversion.  The result was great....

This is an awesome enchilada sauce!  I have an over abundance of tomatoes right now and wanted something different.  I added garden fresh tomatoes instead of the can of sauce, and also chopped a red jalepeno from my garden.  I will be making more of this to freeze and use up some tomatoes!
