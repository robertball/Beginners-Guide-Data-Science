I've been making this pumpkin recipe for years, it is the same recipe I found in a church cookbook given to me about 20 years ago and it is by far the best! You can add more or less of the spices to suit your taste with no problem. The only thing I would most definately change is the cooking temp. If you use a large 9x5 pan, cook at 325 or the bottom and sides will be hard and dried out, if not burned by the time the middle is cooked. Bake at 325 for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Also, you can get 7 mini loaves out of this recipe which is great for gift giving. Cook time on the mini loaves is about 45 at 325.

Extremely easy recipe, which makes it especially nice for the holidays, when we all have plenty of other things to do! Moist and delicious.
I recommend stirring the spices into the dry ingredients, rather than the wet. The ground cloves tend to clump a little bit in the wet ingredients, and nobody likes to get a mouthful of clove.

This bread was easy to make and delicious. It was a little too sweet for me. In the future I might add only 2 or 2.5 cups sugar. But others seemed to like it as is. Also my bread took nearly 1.5 hours to bake (for the center to cook). Coming out of the oven the outside was very dry but the inside very moist. I wrapped the loaves in foil overnight, still warm, and by morning, including the crust, the loaves were very moist. The bread got rave reviews overall so the recipe is a keeper I'm sure I'll make again. Great for the fall/winter holidays.

Awesome recipe, I have been looking for a recipe that mathces the Starbucks gingerbread and here it is.  I substituted 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, applesauce for the oil and egg beaters for the eggs.   But I did add cream cheese frosting and candied ginger on top.  Awesome.

This is really good and moist. I made it for Christmas in a 10" well-greased tube pan. Everybody loved it. I used a simple glaze on it.

DELICIOUS!  *Adjusted OVEN TEMPERATURE TO 325 & INCREASED BAKING TIME: Lg loaves-325/1hr 15 min; Mini loaf 325/45min; Muffins 325/20 min. **Increased amount of Spices by 1 1/2 to 2 times.  Added ginger in with other spices **Used 1/2 white & 1/2 dark brown sugars **Used whole wheat flour or all purpose or 1/2 & 1/2 of each flour. Any ingredient variation comes out good. **MOST IMPORTANT IS THE OVEN TEMPERATURE DECREASE TO 325 and INCREASED BAKING TIMES. ENJOY!

Awesome - best spicy pumpkin bread ever (and I've made ALOT.  I followed a lot of the suggestions.  Reduced sugar 2 cups(1 c white/1 c brown), 1/2 oil/1/2 applesauce, removed allspice, doubled cinnamin and cloves, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, used 1/2 white flour & 1/2 whole wheat, reduced salt to 1 tsp.  Super moist and very autumny.  Definite add to my sweet bread collection.

An absolutely fabulous bread - easily my favorite.  Incredibly moist and spiced with just enough ginger.  Perfect for winter breakfasts.

Traditional gingerbread is made with molasses and brown sugar- not white sugar. Speaking of sugar, there is waaayy too much sugar in this recipe. And not enough spices. I had to add more and still didn't taste them very much -that was the only thing I changed about this recipe. The taste was just OK. Nothing special

Take the ever popular, wildly popular Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread, and just vary the spices a little bit, most importantly with a heftier measurement of ginger, and you've got this Pumpkin Gingerbread. The recipes are essentially the same. But would I like the added ginger in this recipe?  Yes I do! This is moist, pleasantly spiced and, just as I enjoy with the Downeast Maine recipe, includes no nuts,raisins, applesauce or...whatever.  Just plain ol' darn good pumpkin bread. So if you're torn between the two recipes make either one and you'll be happy and equally satisfied.

This makes the best bread!! I took the advice in the other reviews and upped the spices by 50% and it smelled and tasted so good! The only other changes i made were just using 2 cups sugar, 1 white and 1 dark brown, and instead of 2 cups oil i used 1 cup oil and 1 cup cinammon apple sauce. Perfect!!! And don't forget the cloves even though the recipe forgets to mention them again! I'll be using this recipe dozens of times for the holidays!

I usually make Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread, but have been really unhappy with it the last few times I made it.  I am so glad I tried this recipe, if you are looking for gingerbread, keep looking, but if you want a pumpkin spice loaf, this is it!
I halved the sugar and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c fat free sour cream for the 1 c oil, for the spices I used 2 1/2 tsps cinnamon and 2 1/2 tsps pumpkin pie spice, made 6 mini loaves, baked in 40 minutes, beautiful domed loaves that were nice and moist.
Made again as muffins, I halved the sugar and oil, used whole wheat flour, got 24 large muffins, baked in 22 minutes, 8 minis, baked in 17 minutes.
I have also added cranberries and pecans which were really nice additions.

This was PERFECT! I did make some changes just for personal preference! I only used 2 cups of sugar (perfectly sweet enough) and I used 1/2 cup of oil + 1/2 cup applesauce to cut down on the fat! I also only used 3 large eggs. I added 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract and I only used 1 tsp. of salt. This took an extra 10 minutes to bake. This will be my 'go to' gingerbread recipe from now on!

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic! I have made this 3x in 2 weeks to give to friends, for company, etc and it will be my go-to quick bread recipe all autumn/winter long! the only things I changed the second time (original recipe = 5 stars) that I thought improved it were I changed the sugar to brown, used 1.5x the spices and replaced the water with apple cider. Next time I plan to try a 50/50 mix of oil and applesauce to cut down on the fat a bit. Definitely amazing!!

This is a favorite I make each year for the holidays. I bake mine in the mini loaf pans (9 loaves per pan)with bread liners @ 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. Then I mix an 8 ounce brick of cream cheese with a 7 ounce jar of marshmallow cream for a very tasty spread for the breads. Everyone loves them and looks forward to them every year.

Absolutely 5 stars!!  I had planned to bake gingerbread for my Christmas get-together.  The recipe I had called for cake flour and I had none.  So, I started looking for another recipe.  When I ran across this one and read the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, but prepared it in a 9 X 13 pan.  About half way through baking, I topped it with a mixture of butter, brown sugar, flour, and chopped pecans (from my other gingerbread recipe).  It took about an hour to bake.  Oh my goodness....is this ever delicious!  The pumpkin and spices smelled so good and the taste is perfect.  It is very moist also.  I like the addition of the crunchy topping, but this bread would be delicious plain, or with added nuts.

I used fresh pumpkin (1 3/4 cups) instead of canned & did 1 cup each of granulated & brown sugars. I like my bread to be slightly sweet & not overly sweet, so this ratio seems to fit the bill. I also went with a suggestion of another reviewer & doubled the amount of spices, except for cloves (1 tsp.) and it turned out wonderful! This is a very easy, moist recipe. Also, if using fresh pumpkin, omit the water since fresh pumpkin tends to have a little more water content. If you want your home to be filled with fragrant pumpkin spice aromas, then you found your recipe!

This is amazing! The only thing I added was 1 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg.  Like one person suggested I baked at 325 and it took 1 1/2 hours to bake.  This won't be sticking around here long - it is tooo delish! This will be a new family favourite.

Man, I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It tasted like fall perfection!  It was perfect as written, but I made a couple changes just to make it a tad healthier.  I only used about 2 1/2 c of sugar.  I used 3/4 c applesauce with 1/4 c veg. oil, and I substiuted whole wheat flour for half of the flour.  I wouldn't dare mess with the flavors in this recipe.  It is perfect as written.

This is excellent! 3 cups of sugar is too sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 2 cups. Used 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup oil to lighten it up, since other reviewers said it was oily - turned out fantastic, and low-fat too! I also added an extra 2 teaspoons of ground ginger to make it more gingery.

Made this in a bundt pan and it came out moist and marvelous. I substituted buttermilk for the liquid because I had some in the fridge and added walnuts and a sugar glaze with just a splash of rum. Served with whipped cream flavord with a bit of rum and cinnamon sprinkled on top for garnish. FABULOUS!

I'm really skeptic about pumpkin anything but I loved this bread.  I will surely be making it again next year.  The house smelled really like christmas.  Added dried cranberries and my husband loved it!

Easy to put together and delicious!  I followed others suggestions and added more spices (I put too much in, though--I can still taste the cloves and cinnamon!) I also substituted half the flour for 'white whole wheat' (it's whole wheat, but not as "wheaty"), applesauce for the oil, and 1 1/2 cups Splenda, 1 cup brown sugar, and just a 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of 3 cups white sugar. Next time I'm going to cut the white sugar out completely and add some flax seed. Overall, even with all the substitutions, the bread came out moist, dense, and flavorful. This recipe will be a keeper!  Thanks!

Awesome!  I made it this morning, and it was a huge hit with my husband and 4-year old daughter!  I made a few suggested adjustments to the recipe:  apple cider in lieu of water, and I doubled the cinnamon.  It was done in exactly one hour and turned out perfectly - moist inside with a crispy top.  So delicious!

I have made this recipe many times.  Like the other reviewers I include doubled spices.  I like an extra spice to my bread.  I also use 2 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup molasses.  It  makes the gingerbread taste even better.  I cut my water down to 1/3 cup.  I have made these as muffins and they are terrific.  Bake for 25 minutes or until toothpick comes clean in the center.  I am going to top these with cinnamon cream cheese frosting.  YUMMY!!!  A must try.

Phenominal!  No joke.  The outside edges of this almost taste like they caramelize.  I replace 1/3rd of the vegetable oil with apple sauce to skim some calories without changing the taste, and add an additional 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  The only negative about this bread is it's hard to stop eating it!  So eat your veggies and protien first at dinner time, because once you reach for this bread, it's all over!

This bread had a wonderful rich spice flavor.  I loved the influence of the ginger.  I made the recipe as printed zero adjustments.

Ok, yes I tweaked. I used 2c white sugar & 1c brown sugar & used 4 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices called for. The result was the BEST pumpkin bread I've ever had! Tossing my old TOH recipe out & replacing it w/this one!

Quite possibly one of my favorite recipes 'discovered' on Allrecipes. I've made a few modifications:

For the puree, I bake a butternut squash (halved, seeded,face down on a lightly greased cookie sheet) for 40 minutes at 350F. Then I scoop out 1 cup of squash, puree it in the food processor, and set it aside until the wet ingredients are ready.

I also made the following substitutions:

- 1/2 cup Unsweetened Applesauce (instead of oil)
- Whole Wheat bread flour
- Splenda (white)
- Fine Sea Salt

The spices are spot on. Never sway from the suggested in the original recipe. I eat this every morning with vanilla yogurt. This bread's so good, I wake up in the morning happy, knowing I get to eat a couple slices!

Thank you frosty for this ridiculously amazing bread recipe!

I changed nothing in this recipe. It's terrific as is. I made half the recipe and baked it in one 12 cup mini bundt pan and one mini muffin pan at the suggested temperature for 20 minutes. Drizzled with a spiced glaze, this was a warm, spicy and delicious treat.

IMPORTANT TIP***  This is delicious, but I only noticed after the bread was in the oven that in the written directions it does not say to add the cloves. They are listed in the ingredient list but not in the written directions. Without the cloves it is alright, but I bet it would have sent it over the top with them!  This recipe is a keeper!

****This was a hit with my family BUT I MADE CHANGES-reduced sugar from 3 cups to 1 1/2 cups, added 1/2 cup molasses, also cut water to 1/3 cup and added raisins. Cooked it in a bundt pan for 1hr 15 min @ 350. It looked wonderful. Served it with a Lemon Sauce(for company) but it was good on it's own and plenty sweet.

This was sooo moist and delicious! I didnt add the allspice because I didnt have any, and i only put one tsp of ginger, cause i didnt want it to overwhelm the bread.  i added also a little nutmeg.  And i used brown sugar for some of the sugar, it gave it rich flavor! It was marvelous! im so glad i made this, and will be making it during the holidays.

This was very good.  I didn't double the spices like other reviewers suggested because I wanted a milder flavor.  I put it in a bundt pan and topped it with cream cheese frosting from this site and sprinkled the top with cinnamon for presentation.  UPDATE: I made this again but doubled the spice and replaced half the fat with applesauce and everyone liked it this way better.

I made this for an after Thanksgiving party and it was a hit! I followed the other reviewers and doubled the spices. I also added the nutmeg and pecans. I used only 21/2 cups of sugar but I don't think it was very sweet. It was just right. I may next time add 1 cup of dark brown sugar and just do 2 cups white and add more ginger. Thanks for the recipe. Update 11/7/08 I made these today and doubled the recipe. So I bought the 30 oz can of Pumpkin, however, I made a huge mistake by buying Pumpkin Pie Filling instead of Pumpkin Puree.I have to say I was very worried that it would come out too sweet and too spicy because I used 4c white sugar and 2c dark brown sugar and increased the spices by 50%. No fear...it came out great, not too sweet or spicy. It was very moist and rich. Absolutely wonderful....even after the mistake.

WOW!!! This is my absolute favorite bread. I've had so many people ask me for the recipe and everyone loves it! I love how the crust is a tiny bit crunchy when it comes out (at least from my oven!) And the bread tastes even better after a day or two.

My husband can attest to my obsession with this bread. There have been times when I've made this for multiple weeks in a row. This bread's aroma always brings back memories from Fall 2004 when I was first married and discovered this recipe. It always gets me excited for the cuddly feeling of fall. :)

Thank you so much Terri!

We call this "sell your home bread" we recently sold our home and each time we showed it I had one of these loaves baking in the oven!  This is so good and makes your home smell great!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice.  The bread freezes well and everyone loves it...thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe!  I added 3/4 cup of sour cream, 2 tablespoons of molasses, vanilla extract, substituted buttermilk for water, and substituted 1 cup of brown sugar for 1 of the white sugar.  I also used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I baked in a 12 cup bundt pan for one hour - it was an absolute hit!  Thank you for the recipe - it's a keeper!

This was a fantastic pumpkin bread! The whole family loved it and it disappeared quickly.  I made half a batch which was perfect for one loaf (wish I made the whole batch now!) Only thing I did differently was to add a tsp of vanilla to the half batch. Wonderful! Thank you!!

Oh my, this was fabulous!  I made muffins with mine, and decided that I had way too much batter(I had made 12 jumbo ones) so the next morning I added a little milk, and made pancakes with the left over batter!  The family LOVED them, and it may be a new "pancake" recipe for me.

I thought this was better as a bundt cake than as a loaf cake (For me the recipe made one of each)  It was very light and flavorful and especially good with an orange glaze I found in another pumpkin cake recipe  on this site:  Orange Glaze: 1 cup confectioners'sugar + 3/4 teaspoon grated orange peel +
4 teaspoons orange juice  -- Drizzle over cake and sprinkle with chopped walnuts.  I only gave it 4 stars because it really needs some sort of icing to finish it off.

Great flavor! I'd read other reviews before baking this and increased the spices by 50% - definitely gave it a good flavor without overwhelming the taste. Also reduced the sugar to 2c. so it wouldn't be so sweet. This recipe is a keeper!

I can't give it a five cause it really isn't anything special, however I make this recipe a lot in the fall, it's a no fail type of recipe.  I have experimented and find that using 1/2 to 3/4 whole wheat flour is really good.  Doing the whole thing whole wheat was too gritty.  I make the bread in muffin tins for convenience.  I have also substituted 1/2 the oil for apple sauce successfully and plan to try to substitute it completely next time I make it.  I also double the spices, otherwise it's kind of bland.

I have NEVER liked Pumpkin Bread.  Made this recipe to give as thank you gifts.  I sampled it just to make sure it wasn't too dry, flavors right, etc.  HOLY COW, THIS WAS FANTASTIC! It was hard to give these away, I will definitely be making another batch and will make for years to come!  Thanks, this changed my perspective on Pumpkin!  My oven runs a little hot so I kicked my temp down to 325 and since I was making mini loaves, (as someone else suggested) I cooked these for 45 min and they did make 7 minis.  If you do make minis, Make sure you rotate front to back half way through cooking.

I almost didn't make this but had some extra pumpkin puree left over, I am so glad I did.  This is really good!!  I also followed the recipe exactly, well, I may have had a heavy hand on the cinnamon and I glazed it....but other than that ;-)  Its perfect!!  Moist and flavorful and perfect for the holidays!!

I made the recipe as stated, adding a little extra of each spice for added yumminess.  Then I baked it in a well-greased bundt pan at 325 for an hour and 20 minutes instead of two loaf pans and topped it with an easy glaze I found on this site. It turned out moist and scrumptious, the pumpkin flavor is not overwhelmed by the taste of gingerbread.  This is definitely a new addition to my holiday offerings :)

This is the first time I ever made bread and it is very easy... It filled my apartment with delicious scents! The bread is moist, and it has a perfect amount of spice. I ended up baking it for an additional 20 minutes, but that could be because of my old oven. I used one glass pan and one aluminum. It cooks *much* better in the aluminum pan.

Not enough stars!  This is hands down the best baked good to come out of my oven.  I make it exactly as stated, but I like to add about a cup of walnuts to the mix and I top it with a nutmeg glaze (1/2 cup icing sugar, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1 tbsp milk) that brings out the pumpkin even further.  Since this makes two loaves, I enjoy sharing this treat with family around the holidays--although I must admit some separation anxiety!  I also find that in a 9x5 glass loaf dish it needs 1.25 hrs, but in an 8x8 1 hr is perfect.  And, enough can't be said about using freshly grated and freshly ground nutmeg and cloves :)

After a long stressful week at work joined with a week long of rainy, drizzly weather in Southern California my oven was begging me to bake.  I selected this recipe and so glad I did.  It was wonderful. Other than my standard rule of thumb for every baked good recipe (cut sugar amount in half and use 1/2 all-purpose/1/2 self-rising flour) I made it exactly as written.  I can't not think of one think to change about it.  The batter mixed up well, baking time was right on and flavor was definitely pumpkin and gingerbread.  It baked beautiful and sliced perfect.  Only problem I had was waiting for it to cool enough to have with my morning cup of coffee.  Definitely try this recipe.

TO DIE FOR.  This was a huge hit with everyone.  I didn't have any cloves, so I substituted nutmeg.  I also used applesauce in place of the oil to make it more heart healthy. I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

I've made this twice now. It is an excellent recipe, turning out great even with some ingredient substitutions.

My first batch I subbed whole wheat flour for white and mostly Splenda brown for the white sugar, to make it heavier, more like the James Beard version. (He says, “Many people consider gingerbread to be a cake, but it was originally meant to be a bread served at lunch or dinner with sweet butter.”) Anyway I spread it in a 13x9 cake pan, cut it into squares while warm and served it with barely sweetened whipped cream. It got raves. Today I made it and only went half white whole wheat and half unbleached all purpose flour, and used mostly a white Splenda sugar blend, but a half c. of Splenda brown. Then I added dark chocolate chips & split the batch in half. Half went into a muffin tin & the other half into a bread pan. Still turned out amazing! 
Confession time; I didn't use pumpkin. I used homegrown roasted mashed butternut squash leftover from dinner, buttered & seasoned. So I cut the salt back by about 1 tsp also.
Since I really like it good and spicy, I used 2 and 1/2 tsp ginger, 2/3 tsp allspice, 2 heaping tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ground star anise, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, a couple of grinds of fresh nutmeg and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. (If I weren't serving it to my grandma and daughter I would've put a little snap into it with a bit of cayenne, and/or possibly subbed in some candied ginger for the chocolate chips.)

Anyway, great recipe Frosty, thanks!

My DH claims this may be the best quick bread I have ever baked!!  That being said makes this a 5+ star recipe for sure.  I got 7 mini loaves, which I baked for 40 minutes.  Will be making this for holiday trays for years to come I have a feeling!!  Thanks for a great recipe frosty!!

I just made these today.  Moist, delicious flavor! Followed Lynn's advice ad baked them at 325 for 90 min. The last 10 min I covered them with foil so they wouldn't burn. Will split them into 7 small loaves to give this season.

Really good.  Because "gingerbread" to me means molasses, I used 1/3 cup molasses and only 1/3 cup of water.  I also used 1/2 cup less sugar, and doubled the ginger and cinnamon, because I like gingerbread spicy, but don't really like allspice.  Next time I'll probably use a little more cloves too, but that's all just personal preference.  I made 12 muffins and 1 large loaf and will probably make all muffins next time, just because that's what we like to eat, it's faster, and it's easier to get the baking time right with our oven.  This was a great recipe, and easy to modify to what you like.

UNBELIEVEABLE!!! I literally had to kick my friends out of the kitchen to keep them from eating all of the batter before I could get it in the oven. I changed the recipe slightly- left out half a cup of flour, and added 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and about 1/3 cup of molasses. I baked them into cupcakes, and and topped with a cream cheese frosting and sprinkles. One of the best things I have ever baked- PERFECT for the holidays. I'm making several loaves to frost and give as Christmas gifts. Thank you for this one- a new favorite!

Great flavor! This dessert-y bread was the first thing gone from the table at a Christmas party I attended! :) I replaced all the oil with unsweetened applesauce (for healthy reasons!) and cut the amount of cloves in half since I'm not a fan of the flavor (very strong otherwise). I did double most of the other spices like other reviewers had suggested. After it cooled, I melted cream cheese frosting and drizzled it all over. Amazingly moist and yummy! :) Thanks for my new holiday favorite!

Definitely DOUBLE ALL SPICES, and ADD NUTMEG!!! That's what i did, and it came out moist and delicious! Also, instead of baking two loaves, i filled the first pan then mixed golden raisins and pecan pieces in with the remaining batter and poured a batch of muffins! Why not - they may be even better than the loaf;)

OH MY! This is wonderful! My changes: substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup brown sugar (dark, preferred) for 1 cup white sugar. Call me frugal, but I also substituted the reserved liquid from fresh-cooked pumpkin for the water in the recipe. Apple cider would also be a good substitute.
Top this with whipped cream,  and you have dessert.

Awesome!  It smells absolutely heavenly while it is cooking!  I shared it with many people since it makes so much ( I made one loaf pan and 4 mini loaves using my Pampered Chef 4-loaf stone). You must try it!  One little change I made was to substitute 1 cup brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar.  Delish!

9/15/2014 - Made this today with some changes as recommended by others.  Baked at 325 instead of 350.  I decreased sugar to 1 3/4 cups using half dark brown and half white.  I replaced half of the oil with cinnamon applesauce and used olive oil for the other half.  I also increased spices by about half and added some freshly grated nutmeg.  Cooled to handle and wrapped while still slightly warm.  Beautifully moist and intensely spiced and absolutely delicious. Thanks for recipe and suggestions for changes.

Made two moist and delicious loaves of this pumpkin gingerbread for the Thanksgiving holidays. Followed the recipe as written with the exception of using my own pumpkin puree and adding in a cup of miniature chocolate chips. I also drizzled a powdered sugar glaze made from powdered sugar, milk and vanilla extract over the top of each loaf.  Everyone loved it with several people saying it was the best they had ever eaten. Thanks frosty for sharing your keeper recipe!

Oh yeah!  This is the pumpkin bread/muffin recipe I have been looking for.    Sorry, but this one is just better than the oft reviewed Downeast Maine recipe - it has more flavor and bakes evenly.   Although it is delicious as published,  the second time I made it  I reduced the sugar  and slightly increased the spices. You could make 3 smaller loaves - it would bake up quicker.

I changed this recipe by substitution of water to buttermilk and using less sugar with 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of granulated. Allspice is a strong spice and some people do not like it, so you may want to go easy on that one. I then added chopped walnuts. The cooking time was a tad longer- maybe 5-8 minutes. I loved it and was asked for the recipe by several people at work. I will make again and again.

I halved the recipe, half white and half brown sugar, used egg beaters, used half oil and half yogurt, used OJ instead of water, doubled most spices, added pecans, made 2 mini loaves and 11 muffins. Iced with cream cheese icing, 2 cups powdered sugar, 4 oz cream cheese, 2 Tblsp butter, 1/2 tsp ginger, a little milk.

This is the best quick bread recipe I have ever found!  Didn't change a thing.  I needed to bake it an extra few minutes only.  I was looking for a recipe so that I can give out desert for the holidays and I found it.  My husband says that it tastes like Christmas so I knew this was it!  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!

Absolutely Fantastic! We were salivating as it baked!

I did make a couple of adjustments:
1. Rather than pumpkin puree, I used a mixture of Acorn Squash & Butternut Squash - 2 cups.
2. I was REALLY in a Ginger mood, so I used 1 tablespoon of Ginger.
3. For reduced sugar, I used 1-1/2 c. of sugar and 3/4 c. Splenda.
4. I was short on eggs, so I only used 2 eggs. Then, I pureed together 1 cup of applesauce (in place of the oil!!!) and 1 banana. You can't really taste the banana for all the other flavors!!!

Also, rather than 2 loaf pans, I used 2 square cake pans; they baked in only 50 minutes.

I can't wait to share this with my co-workers tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!

So yummy!  Even my kids loved it!  I made it just as the recipe says (minus a cup of sugar because that's just insane to have almost as much sugar as flour) and then I made it again using applesauce instead of oil, egg whites instead of whole eggs, 1 cup less sugar, and the flour half whole wheat half white.  It turned out GREAT both ways!

I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, substituted half of the oil for applesauce, used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup egg beaters.  Baked at 325 for an hour.

Delicious! Moist.  I doubled the spices (with the exception of the ginger).  Baked two 9x5 breads at 325 for 1 hours 9 minutes.  Perfect!

This is the best pumpkin bread I have every baked (so far.) I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and added in 2 t. of vanilla to the measuring cup before I added the rest of the water to measure 2/3 cup. I also added dark chocolate chips to one half of batch, that way had one loaf with chocolate and one without. I served this with homemade honey butter spread and coffee. I will take this to Thanksgiving dinner along with another couple of desserts.

The best pumpkin bread I have ever made.  This was definitely "pumpkin bread with ginger" and not "gingerbread with pumpkin".  Its a bread, not cakey, and it is delicious and moist and flavorful.  I made it exactly except was a little heavy-handed with the pumpkin. Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I'll probably add some nutmeg.  Other than that its perfect- I had to cook it for 75 minutes and it could have used another 5 minutes, so plan on a long cooking time.  And an extra work-out the week you make it because its so addictive :)

Very good bread.   I baked it like a few people suggested at 325 for 1.15 hrs and it is wonderful.  I'm giving some to my sister and to my daughter and we'll see how they like it.  I think it's very tasty.

Delish! Beware that it makes a lot though. I got 24 regular muffins plus a smallish loaf out of this. Baked muffins for 30 mins and the loaf for 45-50 mins. I went with 2 3/4 c sugar (half white & brown), 1/4 c molasses, 2 tsp vanilla extract, and milk instead of water based on reviews.

Super Delish! I made a couple changes. I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 3/4 cups and added a 1/2 cup of molasses, used milk instead of the water. and added 1 tsp. nutmeg. The bread turned out sooo good and it was sooo moist. I made the recipe again using applesauce in place of the oil but the bread came out spongy and not as moist??
This recipe is for sure a keeper!!

It's better than Starbucks!! I took the advice of other bakers. Replaced 1 cup white sugar with brown sugar, bake at 325 for 1 hour 15 min., increased the ginger to 1 T, and added a pinch on fresh nutbeg. I also topped it with a heafty layer of cream cheese frosting. Delicous!!

Wow! I'm really just an amateur baker who does it on the weekends for fun. I'm usually not very good! However, everyone who is always very honest with me LOVED this bread! It came out perfect and we all thought it was better than the Starbucks pumpkin loaf!

I love them as muffins. They're moist and have a nice crown. I substituted applesauce for half the oil, used 2c brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, kept the spice quantity the same. Sprayed muffin tin with Pam with each batch. Bake at 325 for 20 min. made 2 1/2 dozen

The pumpkin gingerbread was absolutely fantastic!  I made 6 mini loaves and topped each with clear sugar sprinkles before baking.  The house did smell divine while baking, and everyone gobbled up lots of the gingerbread.  I'll be making more loaves for our neighborhood Christmas cookie exchange.  Delicious!!

I was looking for a basic gingerbread loaf recipe and thought I'd give this one a try ... I used unsweetened applesauce instead of pumpkin and it came out WONDERFULLY. I'm sure it would taste great with pumpkin too but I wanted to share the substitution. I followed others' suggestion and doubled the spices and loved the results - I expect gingerbread to have a little bite to it. I also switched out 2/3 of the white sugar for brown, because I wanted a richer, more molasses-y flavor. This is definitely a keeper - thanks!!!

This was incredible! I made this last night to have with coffee in the AM, but by the time we went to bed it 1/2 gone! Great recipe! Smells so wonderful while baking. It really is starting to smell like the holidays now!I am definately making this again in small pans for gifts at Christmas. I also made the spread of cream cheese and marshmallow cream, was delicous! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

A great recipe, and a new favourite. I added double the ginger, used half whole wheat flour, and replaced the oil with applesauce. It turned out really well and smells amazing.

First I want to say that if you change the recipe but give it 5 stars you are not accurately rating this recipe. You are rating your own, so put your own recipe on this site for other reviewers to pick apart and rate based on their changes. Ok, this recipe was absolutely perfect. I made as written with no changes and my whole family loved it. I think if I had added more spices as other reviewers did it would have overwhelmed the pumpkin flavor. This was moist and delicious and perfectly spiced. Thank you for this recipe. This is now a favorite!

Excellent.  I used all 3 cups of white sugar, but would probably would be good with one cup white and one cup brown sugar.  I also added 50 percent more spices, except kept cloves the same.

Very very good!! I even made some modifications to cut fat and sugar and it still turned out amazing. The changes I made were: completely substituted the oil for unsweetened applesauce, used 2 cups splenda and 1 cup brown sugar is place of the white sugar, and then 1/2 cup eggs whites in place of the eggs. Because of the changes it was a little heavier so I had to bake it for about 10 minutes extra. The flavour and texture was superb though and it didn't taste like low calorie baking at all!

Used all applesauce instead of oil. Baked in a bundt cake pan for about 1 hr, 15 min. Turned out beautiful & delicious. Can top with frosted cranberries or pumpkin dip (both from allrecipes) for a subtle "cake."

YUM! I made this yesterday and my boyfriend and I have been devouring it.
The only changes I made were: to  cut the recipe in half, so there is only one loaf. Also, prior to baking, I diced some fresh ginger that had been used to make tea, and caramelized it in some of the leftover tea with sugar. I then topped the bread with  the little bits of ginger. It was great!

This is excellent. The only changes I made were using 2c white and 1c brown sugar, heaping my spices, and I made one loaf pan and one muffin pans' worth. I sprinkled plain crumbled walnuts on top of the loaf prior to baking. (Candied nuts, like walnuts or pecans, would also be a good addition.) The only change I would make next time around would be to double most of the spices. It was plenty 'spicy' as is, but I think adding a little extra would really push it over the top. This recipe makes great muffins for breakfast!

Fabulous! I literally ate half a loaf by myself before it even cooled.  OJ makes a great substitution for the water, but if you use fresh pumpkin (which has a higher moisture content), reduce the water (or OJ) by half, otherwise it's a little damp and sticky.  Gotta tell you - even damp and sticky, it's deee-lish!

This was delicious! I came very close to only adding 2 cups of sugar but decided to make this as written the first time and see what I would change, if needed. I wouldn't change a thing! It was moist, not too sweet and the spices were perfect. This is what I'll be having for a quick breakfast the morning of Black Friday.

I made this recipe without changing a thing.  It was delicious!  It was a hit at our breakfast buffet at work, and my husband and I both loved it.  I will be making this for Christmas gifts this year!  FYI, This recipe is almost identical to the Maine Pumpkin Bread recipe.  The only difference is in one of the spices and spice quantity, and the addition of baking powder in the Pumpkin Gingerbread recipe.

Delicious.  Only problem is I can't stop eating it.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup oat flour, and 1.5 cups white flour.  I would try cutting the sugar to 2.5 cups next time.

This bread is super moist and delicious!  I used fresh pumpkin that I cut and boiled with cinnamon rather than canned.  I also used olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  Quick and easy!

This is a fabulous recipe. This bread is so moist and full of flavor. Just as a personal preference I used 1 tsp. ginger and 2 tsp. cinnamon. I love pumpkin bread and this is one the best ones I've tried.

Love the bread! Thank you for sharing. I didn't have enough pumpkin, so I added 2 bananas, kids said it was the best ever. Also, I added crushed left over ginger snap cookies ( the really hard ones, that kids don't like) it increased the flavor with a crunchy topping, I will use again

So Good and moist.  I can't stay out of it, and the whole family loves it.  The only adjustment I made was substituting 1 cup dark brown sugar for one of the cups of white sugar.  The spices are perfect.  I will make this again and again.

So moist and tasty! Made half of batch into loaf and did the other in muffin form. The loaf batch was gone practically overnight. I've managed to keep the muffin ones a bit longer. Wrapped each muffin individually and froze them. I take one out before work and microwave it for a couple of seconds to thaw and eat it on the way.

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars! The absolutely perfect pumpkin bread, with these modifications: sub 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 c. oil; sub 1/2 c. brown sugar for the white sugar and may reduce white sugar by up to 1/2 c.; add one shy teaspoon on vanilla to wet ingredients; and mix spices into dry ingredients.  I didn't have all the spices on hand, so subbed 3-4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice plus a big dash of cinnamon for all the spices.  Baked my loaves for 1 hour, 25 mins to perfection. Made 2 big, supermoist, perfect texture loaves.  A must for the holidays and would be great for gift giving!  We spread cream cheese frosting on each slice as we cut and ate it and devoured the first loaf within 2 days.  Planned to freeze loaf 2, but it didn't make it to the freezer - fantastic!

It's REALLY good! We love it! I also made it with spelt flour, changed the serving amount to 12 servings, and put some brown suger/flour/ cinnamon/butter topping on it. We made three mini-loaves that when done, were over the top!

Holy YUMMY recipes, Batman. But definitely cut the sugar down to 2 cups. And I used half brown and half white sugar and 19 ounces of pumpkin because I had it in the fridge already. Everything else I did exactly as the recipe called for and the loaves turned out perfectly! I'll keep this one for sure.

This stuff is awesome!  I made 6 mini loaves of this yesterday and my son consumed almost an entire one by himself. Its spot on with the ingredients and I did as one viewer suggested by baking at 325 instead of 350-came out perfect. Thanks for this recipe that is going to be a family favorite from here on in!

I LOVE this recipe for the fall and winter seasons.  It was a huge hit for my family and friends.  I changed the recipe just a bit using butter instead of oil, and using half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I am making some more tonight for a church brunch and I think I will double the spices because I like to really taste the spices.  Overall great classic pumpkin bread recipe.  I don't think there is a way to mess this one up.  Blessings,

I love all things pumpkin and have tried several of the recipes on this site. This recipe in particular is very very similar to the popular "Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread" recipe...both are EXCELLENT but I prefer this recipe which has a lot more flavor and spice! This recipe is versatile and works great as a muffin, loaf, or cake because it is so moist.  Since the recipe is so moist on it's own, I made some changes the second time around. I used 3/4 cup Brown Sugar Splenda Blend, and 3/4 cup white sugar, 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 cups white all-purpose flour, and substituted applesauce (cinnamon flavor) for the oil. The recipe is a 5-star on it's own, but with these changes it was still moist and delicious and a bit healthier!  Thank you for this recipe. :)

This was a great recipe! I didn't have canned pumpkin, so I used fresh pumpkin that I had roasted and pureed myself.  Other than the pumpkin, I followed the recipe exactly. The bread was so moist and had a very balanced flavor.  I was a little afraid that it would be too strong with the amount of spices used, but it turned out perfectly! This is going to become my go to recipe this fall/Thanksgiving!!  I ended up making 1 loaf of bread, 12 cupcakes, and 1-9 inch layer.

Delicious!! I followed this recipe exactly, though I added nutmeg instead of cloves bc I didn't have any. I made this into muffins and cooked them maybe 20 minutes at 350. I also added a few butterscotch chips to some of the muffins, which caramelized and are so yummy! I highly recommend this recipe!

The first time I made this exactly by the recipe and it was very good, but I felt it needed more spice. The second time, I used 1/2 c. vegetable oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce plus used 2 tablespoons of ginger instead of 2 teaspoons and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 1. I baked it as a cake in a tube pan (45 minutes) and topped the cake with a simple frosting made of butter, confectioner's sugar, and lemon juice (put it on the top and let it drizzle down the sides). I grated candied ginger and sprinkled that over the frosting. It made a delicious, professional-looking cake that got rave reviews from my guests! This is perfect for the holidays -- sweet, but not too sweet.

This is the perfect fall bread.  The recipe made two very big, flavorful loaves.  They came out nice and moist.  Great with a cup of coffee.  I'm looking forward to breakfast the rest of the week.

This was really good, however I did tweak it quite a bit. Instead of oil, I used vanilla yogurt. I only used two cups of sugar and used half agave nectar half sugar for the rest. Then for the flour I used half white flour and half ground walnuts. I also used extra PP spice. Alot of changes but still amazing!

Really, really, really good!!  As some previous reviewers suggested, I substituted milk for the water, and added nutmeg.  I also wanted to make it more "gingerbread", less "pumpkin", so instead of 3 c. of white sugar, I used 2 c. of white, 3/4 c. of brown, and 1/2 c. of molasses.  It was just a little sweet, so next time, I think I'd cut the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  But it disappeared FAST, this is an instant favorite for me!

I've made this recipe for YEARS and never changed a thing.  I must say - I did change something - and it's been for the better.  I borrowed an idea from my Amish Friendship bread.  After coating the pan with butter, I create a mixture of all the spices used with sugar and then coat the bottom and sides of the baking pans and then I sprinkle the mixture on top of the bread before cooking.  It doesn't change the YUMMY taste of the bread at all - but it does add another layer of texture.
I make this bread at least 2 times a week throughout November and December.  I bake mini loaves and give them as gifts and take the large loaves to work (where there is never a crumb left behind).  Not only does it taste WONDERFUL - but it smells divine!
ENJOY!

This bread is just so good. We are burning our mouths on piping hot pieces right now & I can tell it's one of those breads that will taste even better as it sits.  I baked in a 7x11 pan for 45ish minutes AND for 50 minutes in a 9x5 pan.  Makes a lot of bread.  Subbed 1/2 apple butter and 1/2 oil for the 1 cup of oil.  In addition, you can cut back on sugar with good results. But don't omit all the oil b/c the end product will be more spongy, less moist.
It's a keeper!!!  Do not skimp on spices, especially ginger.  And if you can restrain yourself, it gets better as it sits.  EDIT: made again using bundt pan & cannot emphasize how delicious it is.

This dessert sure lives up to it's high rating. I followed the directions exactly except that I had to bake it an extra 15 min. (probably 10 would have done it). Perfect texture and a lovely colour. I am glad it made 2 loaves as 1 went out the door with my son tonight. All of these wonderful "Autumny" treats are why this is such an awesome time of year for baking.

I had such high hopes for this bread.  The first time I made it I followed the directions EXACTLY and it turned out to be a wet soggy almost-burnt brick...but I really wanted it to work so I went out and bought ALL NEW ingredients, thinking that may have been it (not that any of my ingredients are that old)...but nope happened again!

This is the best pumpkin bread recipe I've ever used!!! Usually when I make pumpkin bread I feel as though it isn't flavored enough but this one has the perfect blend of spices, smells great while baking, and does not dry out! I took it to my son's mommy and me class and got raves! Thanks so much for sharing!

I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour with 2 cups all purpose flour, and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup. Delicious! Moist and sweet, despite my changes.

This is a wonderful combo of pumpkin bread and gingerbread. I made a small loaf, 12 mini-muffins, and an 11 X 7 pan to eat like gingerbread. Fragrant, moist, spicy, and homey--great recipe!

This cake is the best.  I have make it twice and it has not failed me.  The first time I made it according to the recipe (with high altitude changes).  I was good and moist.  I am not a real fan of pumpkin so the second time I  made it I used chunky applesauce  and it was even better.  I baked it in a tube pan and put a cream cheese frosting on top and sprinkled with pecans.  This cake is wonderful.  Give it a try.

I agree that the spices need to be done at 1 1/2 times the amount listed on the recipe. It is then very good....great for holiday gifts! I normally get about 6 or 7 mini bread loaves out of one recipe here.

This recipe was amazing! I made a few changes to make it a bit healthier; I used 2 c. Splenda, 1/2 c. dark brown sugar, 2 c. all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, and 1 c. applesauce instead of oil. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I thought the clove taste was a bit overpowering, so next time I'll try 3/4 teaspoon cloves and 2 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I made this last night. The amount of spices compared to the 3+ cups flour and 3 cups sugar prompted me to up the spices by about half...i was pleased with the result. The cake is moist and very good. I baked two loaves at 350F and it took about an hour and a half. Since this was my trial run with the recipe, next time I'll maybe add some walnuts and/or try a cream cheese frosting. Very good.

I made this bread, with some modifications, to make it a bit healthier.  I used 2 eggs and 1/2 c. egg substitute.  I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup and added 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups--it's a matter of taste.  This turned out beautifully, very moist.  The next time I try this, I may reduce the oil a bit more and add more spices--I agree with other reviews that the spices could be doubled.  Overall, a very flavorful, yummy quick bread.  A definite keeper.

My husband and I enjoyed this bread very much.  The changes I made were doubling the spices, making muffins instead of loaves (made 30 muffins) and I used Tree Top Naturally Sweetened Cinnamon applesauce instead of oil.  They are great!  Next time I will put some walnuts in some of the muffins.

Very tasty.  I made a nine inch loaf pan, a small (4 in loaf pan) and 12 muffins out of the recipe.

For half of the recipe, I added craisins and pecans and the other half I used raisins and pecans.  Both were great additions.

Great as bread or as breakfast muffins.  The muffins needed to cook only for about 30 minutes.

Delicious and so easy to make, a word of warning, though, use a BIG mixing bowl, my largest was barely big enough for the batter.  I made this to take to a dinner party at a friends house and everyone went back for seconds.  Simply wonderful bread.

If you like pumpkin and gingerbread, this is the recipe for you!  We had to make two batches since we ate the first one right up (none left for Xmas gifts).  I made no changes to the recipe and it was perfect. Thanks for the holiday bread, Terri.

This bread is so good.  It tastes like a mix of pumpkin bread and gingerbread.  There is nothing I would change about the ingredients.  It makes a lot, but my family always manages to eat it up.  This is the best pumpkin bread I have eaten.

Great recipe.  Fantastic for a nice fall morning.  I think the amounts of spice (especially the ginger) really make this an exceptional bread.

Wonderful Ginger Pumpkin Bread.  I did substitute 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 of the oil (everything else was as written except I sifted all the dry ingredients in with the flour) and I will try all applesauce to save even more on fat and calories next time.  The bread got rave reviews from the family on Christmas.

I know people get irritated when you rate a recipe that you modified but I still feel like this recipe is great on its own. I just happened to change it to suit me and it still came out fantabulous. Smells friggin awesome while it's baking. I halved the recipe and used my standard loaf pan (8x4). Used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, the rest AP. Used orange juice instead of water cause why not? Increased the spices by about 50% except the cloves (blech) cause I wanted it super spicy and added some cardamom to the mix. Applesauce instead of oil. Baked for exactly an hour with foil over top the last 20 min or so. Because I had them around and didn't know how to get rid of them, threw in 3/4 cup of chopped fresh cranberries. It has an interesting spongy texture when it's done but I don't mind it. It's still super moist and tastes yummy especially with some low fat cream cheese spread on top.

Tried this yesterday and it turned out really well! I used half brown sugar and replaced the oil with applesauce, and both substitutions turned out really well. Mine took exactly 1 hour to bake at 350 and I was happy with how they turned out at that temp and time.

It's just fine the way it is, no need to tweak this recipe! I didn't have ground allspice so I went a little heavy on the others to make up for it! The first loaf is almost gone as I type this!!! Kid & husband approved!

This is delicious!  I always read a number of the reviews before I try a new recipe, to see how others may have tweaked it to get it to the next level, so, this is what I did differently:  I used 2 cups of sugar.  I baked a 9 x 7 loaf at 325 for about 80 - 90 minutes and it came out perfectly, as did the 3 smaller ones baked for about 40 - 50 minutes.  I followed the rest of the recipe, but I think the amount of spices could easily be increased by maybe 50%.  Just a great way to start off the fall.  I plan on using this recipe again - soon!

I discovered this recipe last year and made it multiple times.
Success and raves with each loaf. It also freezes well when wrapped appropriately. It is currently mid-September and this recipe is most welcomed! Thank-you for its submission!

This really isn't gingerbread - at least in my book.  Ginger is not the predominant flavor, "spice" is. It's a pumpkin quickbread with ginger & other spices in it.  I had a bakeoff between it & baked pumpkin bread.  I liked baked better - & it's lowfat.  Who woulda guessed?!  Not me.  :)

No, this isn't authentic gingerbread.  But it's still delicious, with a few alterations.  First, the sugar.  I used 1 cup of white and 1/5 cups of light brown - helps with the overwhelming sweetness everyone kept referring to.  Second, I doubled ALL the spice amounts.  Finally, I baked it as directed at 350 for 1 hour... after which I turned the oven down to 125 and baked it for another 15 minutes.  Perfect texture.  A nice crispy crust with a delicious, perfectly cooked center.  I rated this four stars instead of five, because the actual recipe listed just didn't work.  However, with my alterations, it was amazingly delicious and I would eat it everyday.

I loved this. I used almost a whole large can of pumpkin (minus half-a-cup) and it came out remarkably well. I baked it in a fluted bunt pan for an hour. My niece suggested that I pour in some milk chocolate toffee bits, so I poured them on top and then swirled them around because, of course, it was already in the pan, but it came out perfectly. Thank goodness that I got the last piece.

Wow this is good!! I think it's the perfect balance of pumpkin and gingerbread. The second time I made it I changed it up a bit- I used 1.5 cups of sugar and .5cup of brown sugar with 1 tsp of Mexican Vanilla. Either way this recipe is amazing and would be a fantastic addition to a holiday dinner or even given as gifts. 
This is probably the moistest quick bread I have ever made! Love it! Thanks for sharing!

Between the combination of spices, the pumpkin and the generous amount of oil, this was a BIG hit.  I made two loaves and they didn't last the day.  One I added raisins to one of the loaves which was great.  If I make it again, I will add nuts as well.

I substituted whole wheat flour for white flour, used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of 1 cup oil, used just 2tbsp canola oil, and decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups. Delicious & a healthy variation!

We've made this several times this year, and many times last winter.  It's the best "pumpkin" bread I've ever made.  We usually cut the sugar and oil a bit, and I usually use some white whole wheat flour to boost the fiber and nutrition.  It's incredible with a cup of tea laced with ginger syrup.

Loved, loved, loved this bread!  Moist and delicious!  I picked this recipe because I only wanted to make 2 loves and only waned to use a 15 oz can of pumkin.  I only used 1 tsp of ginger because I was afraid 2 would be too much.  It was perfect!   Used nutmeg instead of allspice (didn't have allspice).  Will definitely make again.

This is very good and flavorful.  I nearly double all of the spices to bring out the flavor that much more, and I cook at the lesser time.  Consistently moist and a favorite by all who taste.

Awesome recipe!!! Super easy to whip together and comes out moist and delicious. Added some chopped candied ginger to mine, and some crystallized ginger for the top.

This is a very tasty pumpkin bread. The gingerbread feature makes it pop. I followed the recipe exactly, good results.

WOW delicious! Made 2 beautiful loaves last night.  Having a piece now. Yum!  I did use half brown sugar and half granulated sugar and cut it down to 2 cups. It's PLENTY SWEET. I also used Apple sauce instead of oil. It's incredibly moist. Everything else I left the same including the temperature and time to bake. Mine came out in 1 hour 10 minutes. Definitely going to make this next year again. This is much better than Starbucks!  Thank you so much for posting this.

This recipe is wonderful, and produces TWO loaves, which is great because all one's friends will want in on it.  My friend mis-heard me one time when I mentioned it, so now I call this stuff "Pumpkin Ninja Bread," which is pretty appropriate.  The only change I've made has been that every time I make this recipe I keep reducing the sugar. I'm down to 2.5 cups and have not noticed any change in flavor, and I think even less sugar could be used.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe exact (I did make one regular size loaf and a pan of mini loaves).  Fantastic!  Moist and flavorful.  So far everyone loves it!
Update: I've made this recipe several times and it's always a hit!!!

I've made this recipe twice now with fabulous results.  I read the reviews and cut the sugar slightly with 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown.  I didn't have enough oil so did 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup melted butter.  I also upped the spices with a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice - love that stuff!  Ice it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.  Makes a wonderful Christmas gift with bits of candied ginger sprinkled on the frosting.

Excellent, my husbands favorite. Cut the sugar to 2 cups, 1 cup white & 1 cup light brown. Also doubled the allspice and cinnamon.  Added 1 tsp of vanilla.

This was so delicious and moist! I cut the sugar down to a scant 2 cups and used sucanat sugar. For the oil I used half cup applesauce and half cup of coconut oil. I also substituted orange juice for the water and added slightly more spices than called for including nutmeg. The flour I used was white whole wheat flour. No one could even tell that I had made healthy changes to the recipe!

Easy and yummy - The batch makes two BIG loafs, so I always make one big one to keep and 3 small ones to give away.  Everyone always loves it.  It also keeps very well in the fridge.

Yummy, moist, and just the right amount of spice!  I reduced the sugar and it's still quite sweet.  I also cooked them as muffins so they fit in the kids lunch boxes better.

This bread was not nearly as gingery as I would have hoped. If I make this again I will probably double the ginger. It needed more of a punch because it was kind of boring when made just as the recipe directs. This also made three loaves, not two.

This is a nice pumpkin bread. It is not gingerbread however. Simply adding ginger to the batter does not make it gingerbread. That requires molasses and brown sugar. There is an excellent pumpkin GINGERBREAD recipe available on Simply Recipes.

This is probably the easiest recipe ever!  Amazing flavour and very moist.  I didn't change a thing!  After cooling I made a cream cheese icing to top the loaf with.  Great recipe; Thanks!

LOVED this recipe!! Since it's only my husband and I at home, I halved the recipe EXCEPT for the spices! I did this on accident but it turned out to be extremely flavorful and the favorite pumpkin recipe in our house !

So delicious - I cut the sugar to 2 cups and replaced all the oil with sugar free applesauce and it tasted wonderful.  Also, it makes A LOT.  I got a 9X5 loaf, 12 regular muffins and 6 large muffins from this recipe.

Followed the recipe to the letter except I didnt have loaf pans so I used one large cake pan and it came out fine.  Not too sweet, just enough pumpkin and gingerbread flavors, worked really well together.  Husband loved it with a little Cool Whip on top and a nice hot cup of coffee.  Will def make this again!  Made the house smell nice and spicy!

5 stars if you cut the sugar to 2 c (was plenty sweet this way) and use half oil, half applesauce.  I made one loaf and 6 large muffins.  I added raisens to the muffins - tasted GREAT!

I can't believe people think this is a 5 star recipe.  It's genuinely average.  I made it exactly as written in mini loaves for a bake sale. It smells amazing as it's baking, but I thought, "meh..."  as soon as I took a bite.  I think I'll be adding some kind of glaze.

This is a very good recipe. I made exactly as written except for the baking time and temp. I made three loaves (my baking pans are 4x10 and white on the inside which keeps my breads from getting to dark during baking), baked them at 340 degrees for 50 minutes. They were moist, and the texture was perfect. I have already added to my little recipe box. No need to look for another pumpkin bread recipe after finding this one. The spices are perfect.

Awesome!  I converted it to gluten free by using Gluten Free Mama's Almond Blend flour.  Also added about 2 1/2 teaspoons guar gum to help replace the missing gluten.  Oh and since I had some, I added about 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger.  I baked it in a pampered chef fluted bundt pan stone.  Yummy!

Yum!  I only had cinnamon and ginger on hand so I used 2-2.5 tsp. of each; used 2.5 cups of sugar; used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour.  My kids are gobbling it up!

It is so good, I put some chocolate chips in mine which tasted great, my only suggestion is turn the temp down a little and bake it for longer as I found it harden the top of it a little too much:)

I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 2 cups sugar as opposed to 3 and I think even less sugar could be used and it still tastes awesome! Thank you for submitting this recipe!

I made this for Christmas 2010 and everyone loved it.  I am about to make it again just because I have plenty of pumpkin in the pantry.  I will add extra ginger due to personal taste, but this bread is moist, flavorful as is and also delicious toasted with butter or apple butter.

This is superb. I had something similar at Starbucks and wanted to find a recipe to make similar. Everyone who has tasted it (even those who wouldn't touch pumpkin, I didn't tell them) have loved it. My daughter's volleyball team has a standing order as do the parents of the volleyball team!

I made this into muffins, used banana instead of oil and doubled the cinnamon. They were delicious, though not as gingerbread-y as I'd have liked. Next time I will double all the spices :) BTW, cook time for muffins is about 20-25 min.

This was very good!  It made 2 large loaves and I froze one of them.  After thawing, it seemed as fresh and moist as it had been the day I baked it.  I might try to add seeds next time.  Delish!

Great bread! I customized this recipe by using ground flax and water in place of the eggs, 1 1/2 cups turbinado sugar and 1 cup of dark brown sugar in place of the 3 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup of oil in place of the 1 cup of oil, and I doubled the spices. Yum yum! I made a loaf and about 18 cup cakes out of this recipe. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks!

Very good. Baked in a tube pan with walnuts and dried cranberries sprinkled on top. Baked for one hour and it was perfect. Great for dessert, snacks and breakfast.

Delicious. The recipe made a 9x5 loaf pan and a 7x11 baking dish (which I will cover with lemon icing and take to work).   I made quite a few changes to make it better/more nutritious. I replaced all 3 cups of sugar with 2 cups of honey, used white whole wheat flour, milk instead of water, added walnuts. I halved the oil and was going to add applesauce but was out, so I threw in some greek yogurt I had left. My alterations have made this an incredibly healthy AND delicious treat!

Excellent quickbread.  I changed the 3 cups (white) sugar to 2 cups white sugar, 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup molasses to pump up the gingerbread flavor and cut down a bit on the sweetness.  I also added about 1/2 t vanilla and baked 75 min at 325.  Very moist, great texture.  Because of the extra moisture from the molasses, I intended to use less water but forgot to make the adjustment.  It still came out great - very forgiving recipe!  I will definitely be making this again (and again and again...)

A whole loaf was gone in my office in about an hour.  One lady I didn't know even hunted me down for the recipe.  I liked it myself, but I did have trouble with the moist factor.  I followed other people's advice and turned it down to 325, and even then the outside was a bit crispy by the time the inside was done.  But I wrapped it up while it was still warm and it was perfect the next day.  I also only used 1 tsp of ginger, but only because I ran out.  :)

As promised...delicious! And it's a very forgiving recipe. I completely forgot the water, and the loaves turned out just fine. One note, though...if you're using dark metal baking pans, keep an eye on the bread. My outside darkened very quickly.

If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I would! I prepared exactly as written, and baked it in a prepared bundt pan. It took a about an hour and 10 minutes. I let it cool in the pan about 20 minutes and then cooled it on a rack. I frosted it with vanilla butter frosting, and topped with some chopped pecans. It was moist,had a wonderful aroma and had a delicious flavor, that was a big hit at a luncheon. I had to print the recipe for  some of my guests before they left! This is a keeper!!

This is fantastic! I already have a go-to pumpkin bread recipe, and most others don't measure up, but this...this is wonderful! Moist, fragrant, evoking that I'm-eight-again Christmas feeling.   I followed the recipe pretty closely, but we can't use all-purpose flour because my daughter has a barley allergy (read the packaging), so we used our own home-ground wheat. She is also allergic to corn, so we can't use baking powder (contains corn starch), so we replaced it with half as much cream of tartar. Also, I only put two cups of sugar in, and didn't have enough white, so used 1/2 cup of brown--it was plenty sweet for us. Finally, because I didn't want to wait the whole hour, I used giant muffin tins and made twelve big-uns, baked at 325 for 30 minutes to absolute dreamy perfection. Can you see me drooling?

Moist, flavorful pumpkin bread.  Made 1/2 batch which yielded 3 mini loaves of bread.  I also used 1/2 applesauce instead of the oil.  Drizzled with gingerbread icing from this site.

Awesome! Just beautiful and delicious.  I made a loaf for a bake sale and was approached by the woman who purchased the loaf days later.  She said she'd intended to freeze a 1/2 of the loaf for visiting friends, but couldn't resist eating it prematurely.

Easy recipe that makes the house smell wonderful!  I, too, lowered the baking temperature to 325 and cooked about 10 minutes longer for 2 standard loaves.  Did not burn or dry out.

Delicious and easy. I lowered the fat and added fiber: 1) replaced 1/2 cup of oil with 1/4 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup ground flaxseed and 2) replaced 2 cups white flour with 2 cups whole wheat flour. Really good!

this came out very, very good---i used Splenda, canola oil, EggBeaters, and a cup of whole wheat flour (in place of one cup of the all-purpose white flour);  the result was slightly darker and flatter than the cake in the photo, but delicious, moist, and gently spicy.  I would definitely make this again!  thank you!

Very tasty. Cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. Subbed Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus for all the spices. Better the next day! Freezes well too.

Excellent recipe. I added 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped pecans, then sprinkled raw sugar over the top before baking. So good!

I didnt have allspice so I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead. All I can say is WOW this was a big hit. Definitely going to make this one lots. My 3 year old grandson just loved it.

This was great. I used self rising flour instead of the baking soda/powder/salt. I also used 1 whole tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, since it contains all the spices called for, and another tablespoon of the ginger. I also reduced the amount of sugar, just using 1 cup white sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar. Next time I may add a little molasses to make it more gingerbready, and increase the ginger. I baked it at 325 for an hour and 15 and it was moist and not dry at all.  Overall great recipe!

Just made this tonight with my three-year-old. We followed the recipe perfectly with one exception: We baked one large and one small loaf in dark tins, so we lowered the baking temp and monitored the time closely. (Baked at 325 for 45 min. for the small loaf then lowered to 300 and baked the larger loaf for an additional 20 min.) It turned out perfect -- moist and delicious! I will definitely make this again, although for our own personal tastes will likely add more spice (we like a LOT of kick) and will substitute the oil for even more pumpkin and applesauce and use some brown sugar instead of all white. I felt quite guilty using so much oil and sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!

Used the last of the fresh pumpkin puree I made in this bead. It is fabulous and sweet even though I cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup. I will definitely make this again!

Followed this recipe to a T and the bread was amazing!! While it was baking I was concerned that the outside was going to be a little overdone but it turned out fine. The inside of the bread is VERY moist- even days later. I made a cream cheese frosting and spiced it up w/ some pumpkin pie spice, which I drizzled over the bread once it was done. I will definitely be making this again!!

I made this bread as written. It is delicious but VERY sweet. In the future, I will reduce the sugar to 2 cups. Also, try throwing in a few dark chocolate chips. I put about 1/3 cup of semisweet chocolate chips into one of the loaves and it was amazing!

This is so-o-o good ! I made it for a family gathering. My sister couldn't leave it alone. She was supposed to be cutting it into slices for everyone, but was sneaking bites as she did it. We all loved it, and I will make it again. Soon....

I made this recipied with the following changes: 1. Instead of canned pumpkin I baked and used a real pumpkin.  Fresh is almost always better! 2. I didn't put in cloves since one of my friends requested it without cloves. 3. I put in about 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 1.  I love cinnamon. :-)   My friends loved it!  It was gone really fast.  It turned out really moist and I believe using a fresh pumpkin helped.

This was Awesome!!  I doubled the recipe and made a bunch of mini loaves thinking to freeze some for the holidays.  Yeah, Right!   My husband who doesn't like pumpkin bread fell in love with it.  The rest of the family kept "stopping by" and now I need to make more if I want any for the holidays.   Fantastic flavor and easy to make.  What more can you ask for.

This is great bread. Personally I expected it to be more gingerbread like but it was more of a spicier pumpkin bread. Bake a day ahead so that the flavors really develope! If you are looking for more of a gingerbread I would maybe sub some of the water and sugar for molasses and add a little more ginger but really this recipe is fantastic! Not too sweet either! I will definitely make again and again and experiment with the molasses and spices to gain the perfect recipe for us.

I love the way this made my house smell!! It was so easy to change for healthier a little as well. I used 100% fresh ground whole wheat flour in place of all of the all purpose flour (add a smidge more baking powder and baking soda), along with applesauce instead of oil (added a small splash of Canola Oil) and changed the sugar into 1 cup white, 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup Mollasses (decrease the water by just a smidge since you add a bit of liquid this way)... perfect for gingerbread! We also used fresh pureed pie pumpkin that we roasted the day before. Awesome!!

Loved it! And tried it with a few changes---like many others, dropped sugar to 2 cups (one cup white, one cup brown), but plus 1/2 cup of molasses. Substituted 1 cup buckwheat flour for 1 cup of the regular flour. Added small amount candied orange peel for extra oomph. Substituted 1/3 cup of applesauce + 2/3 cup oil, rather than 1 full cup oil. All turned out wonderfully well and was very very well received by guests.

Excellent pumpkin bread all on its own, but I've also made variations by folding in pecans, walnuts, craisins, dried cranberries right before pouring into the pan(s).  The only piece of advice I could give here was already mentioned by others in the reviews.  First time through, I baked at 350 and the edges dried out (and started to burn) by the time the middle was done.  Back the temp off to 325 and raise the cooking time to 1 hour 15 minutes and it'll come out golden brown with a little bit of "resistance" to the edges.  My wife hates anything with ginger in it, so I used exactly 2 Tbs and she couldn't detect it.  My parents, on the other hand, LOVE ginger, so I bumped it up to 3 Tbs; they said it was perfect.  Also, if you're looking for a great icing to use, try the Cream Cheese Frosting II found on this site.

This recipe is very tasty!  I added just a pinch extra of all the spices.  I cooked these loaves for 50 minutes at the suggested temperature and then for 30 minutes more at 325 and they turned out perfect!  I gave one to a neighbour and they loved it.  Another good thing about this recipe is that it costs only $2.50 a loaf!  Thanks for this :)

I cut back the sugar to 2 3/4 c. of sugar
and added 1/4 c. molasses, to add to the gingerbread taste and added a little vanilla. Other than that I made no changes. This makes two really large loaves. I plan on freezing them for Christmas gifts. TIP: Cover the loaves halfway through baking to keep them from burning on top.

This was a delicious and perfect for the post-Thanksgiving season!  If you prefer ginger over pumpkin, then follow my modifications:  split the sugar with brown and reduce slightly, double the spices, triple the ginger, and add 1/2 c. of molasses.  I baked mine in a tube pan for 1 hour at 350 and topped with cream cheese frosting.

Very good! I used one cup white flour, and the rest in whole wheat, as it was all I had on hand.  Made 10 mini loaves, and baked for 45 mins.  Awesome - thanks for the post.

Outstanding!  I used applesauce in place of the oil and water (with wonderful results - no one could tell!), and I also increased the ginger per other reviews.  Everyone loved it.  This will be my go-to pumpkin bread recipe.  Thank you!

I tried this recipe out this Thanksgiving, my mother actually baked us each a loaf. She added brown sugar to the recipe. It was simply fantastic and so moist. I love it warm with Cool Whip on top. Sinfully good!!

This recipe is ALMOST perfect - however I added one thing that I think is important to really set it over the top. I sprinkled brown sugar very liberally on top of the loaves after I took them out of the oven, it compliments the bread just perfectly!!! paired with a good cup of coffee or a glass of mile it makes for a great breakfast too.

Good recipe. I didn't really find that it tasted like gingerbread.  It was however very good pumpkin bread.

This is a fantastic base recipe, it's wonderful as is.  It's pretty easily "healthified" by substituting stone ground whole wheat flour, applesauce for part of the oil, etc. without changing the flavor.  Or it can be made into more of a dessert loaf by drizzling a cinnamon/butter/sugar recipe over it.  Since I found this recipe I make it at least twice a month, definitely one of my favorite recipes!

Great recipe.  Freezes well and stays very moist.  Would taste great with a little cream cheese icing drizzled on top.

I followed the bread almost exactly. I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and I used 2 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar in place of the 3 cups white sugar. I think next time I'll add another teaspoon or a half of ginger - I like SUPER gingerbread. I used just one big square pan and put melted cream cheese icing (with pumpkin spice) on top (the icing tasted better after it cooled down). It was very difficult to mix the dry ingredients in to the wet - I'll try reversing it next time. This time I just added the dry bit by bit, then I stopped my mixer to stir it all up, then I turned the mixer on until all the lumps were gone. I turned out really yummy and the house smelled great while it baked!

edit:
Okay I added another 1/2 tsp of ginger, 1 capful orange extract, and used 1 full cup brown sugar, then drizzled it with Orange Glaze II (well, my rendition of it). Even better than the first time!!

Oh my God! My daughter begged me to butcher her Jack-o-lantern so that we could make pumpkin pie. WEll, I hate pumpkin pie but I agreed to meet her half way. WE butchered the pumpkin, made the puree and the next day, made the bread. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!! I never knew that pumpkin could taste so good! It was easy to make and a great way to spend time with my daughter. My whole family raved about it and it certainly gave my daughter a huge boost in confidence. This is a great food to make with your kids especially during the holiday season. Great job!

When I tried making this the first  time, I followed some reviewers' suggestions for substituting the oil for applesauce. Unfortunately, the loaf came out with the wrong consistency and didn't taste great. Now after using the oil (as the recipie called for, which I should've used in the first place), light brown sugar, and fresh pumpkin puree, this came out GREAT. Even my mom, who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, loved it.

I’m rewriting my review because this bread gets BETTER in the fridge!  I would suggest not trying it right out of the oven (it’s a little bland when fresh) and instead wrapping it in cling wrap after it cools and sticking it in the fridge overnight.  As I had said in my previous review, I made some healthy changes to the bread so I can’t really rate the original recipe as written. I cut the sugar by half and used brown sugar instead of white, I used 1 ½ cups of wheat flour in with the white, and substituted applesauce for all of the oil.  I followed another reviewer's advice and turned the heat down to 325 degrees.  It came out really well and made low-calorie, tasty bread.

Easy & excellent recipe. I made minor changes by such as: increasing all spices except cloves (too strong),and adding 1/2 tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice.  I Substituted 1/2 cup apple sauce for oil(sweetened) and cut back on the sugar.  Used 2 cups brown sugar. I used milk in place of water  For one loaf I added White Choc. Chips (handful).  Lastly, I baked the glass Pan at 340 for one hour and the metal pan for 65 min. Glass pans produce the best results.  I will make this recipe time and time again. Wouldn't a lemon sauce be good spooned over the top?

Yum!  My family loves this recipe, especially my finicky toddler.  It makes two loaves, so we are good to go for about a week and my daughter wants to eat nothing but this moist, delicious bread.  Perfect combination of spices and so easy to make.  This has become a family favorite.

I am a gingerbread fanatic.  This was a really, really good and moist pumpkin bread.  It's spicy and delicious but it's more like a spicy and delicious pumpkin bread than any kind of gingerbread.  But as a pumpkin bread, it definitely deserves five stars.

This was so good and moist.  I did add a bit more of the spices and it turned out great.  I know this sounds a little crazy but we sliced this after allowing to cool a little then put butter on it and ate it for brunch.

Delicious! I love pumpkin and had a little over half a can left over from Thanksgiving pies, so I halved the recipe, added some raisins and pecans, and baked 12 big muffins for about half an hour. Moist, spicy, and wonderful! Great recipe!

The best pumpkin bread I have ever had! I made it for my family last Thanksgiving. Rave reviews! I also changed the seasoning a little I put in 1 tbs of Cinnamon and added 1 tbs of Nutmeg. My Sister-in-law asked for the recipe and made little Thanksgiving loafs for her neigbors and co-workers this year. I grow persimmons and wondered if I could just puree them and substitute it for the pumpkin. It turned out fabulous. My husband said it was the best thing I have ever baked, moist and almost too yummy.

I've made this twice in the past month, and have gotten many requests to make it again! I like the recipe just as it is; I wouldn't change a thing. The second time I made it, though, I had a problem...the bottom and sides burned and the middle collapsed because it was still raw. My husband performed "surgery" to save the good parts...it was worth the save! I may turn down the heat and cook longer next time to see if that helps. My kids (7 and 4) love this, too.

I love this recipe so much that I don't know where to start.  First of all the house smells amazing while it is cooking.  It is so delicious either straight from the oven or cool.  The combination of spices is perfect.  I made mini loaves of this and gave them out at Christmas.  It was a big hit.

This was one of the best quick breads I've made.  I added about one and a half times the amount of spices but noticed that the directions don't instruct you to add the cloves so be careful that you don't leave them out.  I wrapped them and gave them as Christmas gifts with some crocks of flavored butter.  Excellent flavor.

This recipe is SO good and very soft and moist.  My husband doesn't like pumpkin, so I didn't tell him what was in it till after he ate a slice.  He LOVED it. I gave one loaf to my daughter, and her four children devoured it in one sitting. It was good plain, just as-is, but next time I will try it with some of the added suggestions, like nuts/raisins etc.,  I will definitely be making this again.  It was so easy to make and foolproof.

Lowering the baking temp to 325 is perfect.  I had smaller pans available of 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 x 2-1/2.   I first set 45 mins on a timer,  not quite done in the middle with a knife test, put another 15 mins on it.  Perfect.   Be very careful on the pan sizes, I thought these were 9x5 and even that half inch less makes a difference.   The batter was divided between these 3 smaller pans and it's perfect.  I had someone taste test the batter who said it was good.  I thought it was a bit sweet, but that seemed to even out after the bread was done.

I used the Splenda & sugar blend, used 1-1/2 times the spices to not overwhelm the overall flavor (but will double it next time), only 1 teaspoon salt,  unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, and cut the sugar to 2 cups and I may cut it a little further next time to 1-3/4.  It's plenty sweet enough with 2 cups. 

I will be freezing one loaf for now and keep the other two out.   This bread is fantastic.

this got rave reviews from my co-workers.  They all mentioned that they liked the fact that they could taste the pumpkin but it was perfectly spiced.  followed the recipe exactly except I don't level off the spices but rather heap the measuring spoon but kept proportions the same.  bake time was perfect, and is very moist.  will make again.

WOW! Are you kidding me? This is awesome... cannot stop eating this. Made for my father-in-law for Father's Day and he loved it.  He ate more the next day for breakfast and then for lunch. He couldn't stop! Amazing bread...just the way it is written.
Thank You for a keeper of a recipe.

I made this recipe twice in two days because I was sure I must've messed up.   First time around, I did it with a few changes that many reviewers recommend  (upping the spices,
 doing an oil/applesauce mix to bring down the fats, and taking the sugar back some too).     The bread was surprisingly dry and a little bland.   SO...I thought, this just can't be.   All these 5-star reviews!   So I made it again following the original recipe (except I still upped the spices by 50%).   Definitely better and moister this time with full fat and sugar content, but just not that exciting overall.    It was perfectly OK to eat, but I was expecting a bigger "wow" factor.   I will continue to search for a better autumn loaf.

Yummy.  I was afraid that it would be too spicy so I halved the clove.  Wish I didn’t do that.  I will make this again.   I’ll also try if with GF flour for my sister.  I did use 2 C brown sugar and 1C white too.

I have made this bread at least a dozen times and it's delicious! I love that it is moist and makes two loaves--one can be frozen for later. I always add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and some nutmeg and sometimes add chocolate chips. This basic recipe is a keeper!

After reading some of the other reviews, I made a couple of changes as did others.  I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts, additional 1 tsp of fresh grated ginger, & 1 cup of applesauce in place of 1 cup of the cooking oil and cooked 325 for 1 hour.  (One pan was done with a tooth pick, the other came out not done).   Cut the oven off and left both pans in the oven another 10 minutes.  Cooled 10 minutes in the pans, flipped onto cooling rack with no problems. My thoughts are that the sugar needs to be decreased to 1/2 of what it is called for if you are using applesauce. (and mine was unsweetened).  If you are concerned about reducing to 1.5 cups, try to reduce to 2 cups to start off (the original recipe calls for 3 cups). It was very moist, had plenty of spice and I enjoyed it.  Next time I will reduce the sugar at least 1 cup for starters. I was amazed that using the applesauce in place of the oil at the same ratio that the bread/cake was as moist as it was.  I'd recommend butter or whipping cream to top it with. If you would like a drizzle topping of lemon frosting or sour cream frosting with some crystalized ginger, I would even reduce the sugar to 1 cup with the applesauce in place of the oil.  This was genuinely a nice recipe choice.  Oh, I almost forgot.  I used two 9 x 5 heavy loaf pans with pam sprayed into the pans. After cooling on the rack 15 minutes, I cut into the bread; it was moist & did not fall apart.  Blessings.

This is a moist pumpkin bread, that freezes well and is perfect for wrapping up as a gift. sweet enough so it does not need frosting or chocolate chips. I recommend stirring spices into dry ingredients, rather than the wet for better distribution.  Love this one, especially with some walnuts thrown in!! - Paula Akbari

I have made this as is and it is fantastic!

My changes to make it suited to me:
2 c. sugar
1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce (to replace the 1 c. of oil)
2/3 c. milk with almost. 2 tsp. lemon juice for buttermilk (to      
            replace the water)
2 c. White flour and 1.5 c. Whole wheat flour (not a huge fan 
         of whole wheat so next time I will try just 1 c. of whole   
          wheat)
I cooked this for 1 hr 15 min. at 325 degrees (maybe 5 minutes less next time).

I love this recipe; it is so easy and bread.is delicious. Family and friends rave about it. The one change I make is I use only 1/3 cup of water and add 1/3 cup of molasses instead of 2/3 cups of water. 
I use 9×5 pans but I need to bake it for approximately 1 hour and 20-25 minutes at 350°.  The bread is never hard or dry or burnt on the top or sides and always completely baked inside.

This is very good, though I would recommend adding some molasses because the gingerbread flavor is overpowered by the pumpkin.

This was our first "pumpkin gingerbread" and we loved it!  It's sweet and spicy, it smells delicious and tastes even better.  It's fantastic with a cold glass of milk or a mug of hot coffee.  We halved the recipe, since I wasn't sure if we would like this.

Instead of pumpkin, I used a roasted sweet potato (when mashed it was just shy of one cup).  We also used 1 1 1/4 cups white whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of bread flour, instead of just all-purpose.  AND we substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for the oil.  Ok, so we made some changes- it's a very forgiving recipe. 

We loved it.  We will definitely be baking it again.  We didn't add any frosting or topping, it didn't need it.  It's sweet enough on it's own.  I may cut back on the sugar slightly next time.  Although, it is really good as is.

Thank you Frosty for a delicious recipe that my little 4 1/2 year olds and I enjoyed immensely.

UPDATE:  We have baked this bread SIX times already!  My kidabunks keep devouring it.  It's a great Kids in the Kitchen recipe.  We did cut back on the sugar to one cup (for a half-recipe) and used two tablespoons of orange juice as part of the water.  It was still plenty sweet.  We have one more sweet potato and only two tiny slices of Pumpkin Gingerbread, I know what we'll be baking today.

Oh my goodness. Firstly, this recipe was purely amazing. I made this for supper dessert one night and my family loved it. However, I did make a few changes. First off, doubling the spices is a MUST, as without them, it's really rather flavourless, just really sweet. I also dropped the sugar about a half a cup, which made is just the right amount of sweet to compliment the spices. The amount of pumpkin and ginger went really well together and taste fantastic. Again, doubling the spices is a MUST. :)

The bread came out near perfect. I thought it could have used a crunch such as nuts or raisins added to it, or a sprinkle of sugar on top during the baking process. Cooked it at 325 for 75 minutes.

Love this recipe. So easy and comes out perfect every time.  Only thing I changed was to exclude the nutmeg because I don't like it.

I followed the recipe almost as listed with the exception i made a 1/2 batch and muffins instead of loaves. As a pumpkin bread alone I think this is a good recipe. However, I did not think it was the mix of gingerbread and pumpkin I was wanting. The muffins came out nice and moist/fluffy. They did have a good taste. I would make these again and maybe next time add more ginger as some of the other reviewers stated. On another note, I did not find them too sweet as other reviewers have stated. 
*Edit* I came out with 17 regular sized muffins

Very moist and very simple.  I used whole wheat flour and fresh, frozen pumpkin.

My family and friends love this cake and are always asking me when I'm going to make it again.  I replace the water with Guinness for a little extra richness and dust the top with powered sugar.  Also bake it in a bundt pan (70-75 minutes) for larger parties or in mini-loaf pans for gift giving (about 35 minutes).  We often have fresh pumpkin available so I use that instead of canned pumpkin for a wonderful texture.  Love, love, love this recipe!

I used milk instead of water and substituted a mixture of molasses, butter, and applesauce for the oil.  Other than that, I made as written.  I cut the recipe in half and got one large loaf.  It rose well.

I tried this recipe at Christmas and it was a "lip-smacking" success! Everyone, young and old, marvelled at how moist it was. I added fresh-grated ginger and dried cranberries, to rave reviews. Had to make several batches. Pumpkin Gingerbread is now a new Christmas tradition for our family. Thank you, Allrecipes.com!

I would recommend TRIPLING the spice content. I doubled it and it still wasn't enough. I also cut the sugar by 1/3 and the oil by half and used applesauce instead. I was pleased with the results, it tasted especially good the next day. :)

Love love love this bread! I tend to double the spices on most recipes and this is no exception. Sometimes I throw some candied ginger bits (about 1/4 cup) for some extra texture and bite. I also agree to lower the temp to 325 and cook for an hour and 15 to 25 minutes. It starts to smell a little scorched, but after it cools it doesn't taste like it at all

This recipe was perfect! I made it according to the recipe exactly and will not change a thing. I used a loaf pan for half of the batter and baked the rest in an acorn tartlet pan for 15 minutes at 350. Turned out so well. I'm having a hard time staying away from them.

I am glad I read the reviews first. I made some adjustments. I reduced the sugar by half and replaced half of that with brown sugar. I didn't include ginger and doubled the rest of the spices. I added maple syrup and reduced water to 1/4 one loaf. I also added a streusel/pecan crust which was amazing. (3 tbl flour, 1/4 cup brown  sugar, 1/4 tspn cinnamon and 1/4 cup chopped pecans. Cut in small slivers/chunks butter and sprinkle on top).

Made half with raisins and half without. I actually like the bread with the raisins best. But both were great. Used a cinnamon cream cheese spread on some slices and boy was it yummy! Used 1.5 times the seasonings. Baked at 325 as recommended by others. Made one large loaf and three minis. Nicely done frosty.

This is absolutely delicious! Don't wait until Christmas to make this bread. It is good anytime.  I added raisins because I love raisins in my pumpkin bread. I served with coffee.

The only change I made was to replace the oil with applesauce, but the flavor really fell short for us.  The ginger stood out, but was unbalanced.

This is pretty darn close to the one sold at Starbucks! I followed recipe except for the allspice (I don't have any so I subbed with cinnamon/nutmeg/clove combo). I did reduce temp to 325 (I have a crazy electric stove) and did bake about 10 mins longer. SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! Thank you! VERY MOIST too!

AWESOME!!! Definately double spices, except cloves ( I added only a 1/2tsp. more. Instead of adding water, try apple juice or even ginger ale. Followed baking advice; 325 1-1:15 minutes. My family loves this bread and request it often.

Excellent recipe!!  I made them into mini-muffins and mini-loaves.  My girls aren't huge pumpkin fans ( I make a lot of pumpkin things because of our garden, I freeze my own pumpkin puree), BUT they can't stay out of these!  They are already begging me to pack them in their snack bags for school!  Thanks!

Love it!  I made this more times than I can count during the holidays and everyone loves it.  I found small single service size bread bans and was able to use this recipe to make 8 individual loafs for gifts.  I love the kick from ginger and actually upped the amount and chopped up candied ginger, still came out fantastic

So good! I changed my recipe to make it a little healthier and not super sweet. I also made mine in mini pans. 14.5x8.4x4.7. This recipe made 5 minis and they took about 45 min to bake. Changes I made to actual recipe:
I pureed a fresh pumpkin (followed a recipe on this site on how to bake a pumpkin bc I never did this before) Substituted 3/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil for the 1 cup oil. Also I only used 2 cups sugar after reading other reviews plus I felt this would even out the extra sweet from the applesauce. I also added cream cheese whipped frosting! Yum!

We loved this pumpkin bread.  I made three different pumpkin breads on the same day, and happy to report this was everyone's favorite, by a long shot.  It is nice and moist and packed with flavor.  Thanks frosty for sharing this recipe; it most definitely is a keeper.

I have made it using the recommendations by others. I replace 1/2 amount of sugar with brown sugar and double up the spices except ground clove. This is a keeper!

I don't know if this really classifies as a gingerbread but it certainly is delicious. Very moist. I tried adding more pumpkin to have more flavour but it turned out too moist. Oh well. Still very tasty.

This was really great.  I made it more healthful by using a heaping cup of applesauce instead of oil.  I also used only half the sugar and was glad I didn't use more.  By my calculations, these substitutions cut the calories per serving down from 236 to 134.  I baked it at 325 for about an hour and ten minutes, covering the top with tin foil the last ten minutes so the outside didn't get too brown.

When I made this is turned out delicious! Here are some changes I made:
1) I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (to be healthier) This made the batter thicker, but in the end it turned out alright.  2) I added 1 tsp. nutmeg, and I doubled all of the other spices.  3) I kept the amount of baking soda the same, but I put in a full teaspoon of Baking Powder instead of just 1/2 of a teaspoon. It made the bread fluffier. 
This recipe was an all around favorite! Definitely 5 stars!!

This recipe provides everything you want in a pumpkin bread.  It was moist and spicy with that devine pumpkin flavor.  I only had 2 cups of sugar in my pantry and it was too late for me to run to the store, so I just made it with a cup less than the recipe called for and hoped for the best.  I was pleasantly surprised that it came out delicious!  We didn't miss the extra sugar at all, but I think 2 1/4 cups would be perfect.  I didn't have any cloves in my pantry, so I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I am self-admittedly not a "baker" (sometimes my baked goods come out flat), but it rised beautifully.  This ones a keeper!

Just writing this review is making me miss the sweet, spicy taste of this bread. I have made this several times and it is so easy to make! I follow the recipe to a T and my family/co-workers are still talking about this from when I made it during the holidays. Will be making this for a long time.

Great with chocolate chips and/or walnuts and soo yummy and convenient in mini-muffin form. Word of advice, however, do NOT use splenda baking sugar - completely ruins the texture (perhaps half half?)

Very easy, very delicious. Almost overflowed my two metal pans...topped with cream cheese frosting for an extra special touch. Update 8/2014: Made this today, half recipe in my Pyrex pan. Used 1 c sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. Convection baked at 325 for just over an hour. So yummy!

I used 15 oz frozen pumpkin pulp from Halloween, and added 7 oz okara (soy bean pulp loft over after making soymilk). I only used 1/2 c oil, increased to 1 c water (maybe too much), added about 2 Tbsp of molasses, and used 2 Tbsp ground ginger (I might use 3 next time). I used small loaf pans, but it was a little too moist to cook evenly.

I cooked this at 325 for exactly 1 hr 15 min in a bunt pan and covered it in a cream cheese frosting with a little cinnamon for garnish and it was absolutely delicious!! The only change I made was doubling the spices, but that is only because I like a strong flavor.

I didn't have cloves so left that out -- excellent anyway.  I added some chocolate chips to one loaf --that one was a hit with my son.  But I prefer the loaf with out chocolate chips -- the ginger stands out more without the distraction of chocolate.

Made this for people at work and my family.  Everyone really liked it and it was very moist!  This bread is perfect for gift giving because the recipe makes 2 loaves.  I didn't change anything with the recipe and would not post if I did because then you are not reviewing or rating the recipe as it is intended.

This has become a family favorite! The only thing that I change is add less salt as I find it salty at times with a 1 1/2 tsp salt. I add one tsp and that's fine. Brilliant Bread!

This pumpkin gingerbread is becoming legend in my office. Faculty, staff, and students alike drool over it. It's moist, smells wonderful, and tastes even better with some cream cheese frosting on it. The only tiny change I make is to add nutmeg. Everything else is exactly as published, and it comes out beautifully every time, whether in a regular 9" x 5" pan or mini-loaves. YUM!

Great flavor.  My only issue is the batter divided in half made way too big of loaves.  Next time I will either make 3 maybe even 4 loaves.  2 loaves cooked way too unevenly!

Great recipe!  I did not have all the spices on hand so I used 4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice plus 1 tsp of ground ginger and it had great flavor.  Also, to save on fat I replaced the oil with 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I got 3 small, about 8x4, loaves and split the batter up so one was plain, one has raisins and one has chocolate chips, yum!

I made this exactly as written, and it came out great. I did have to bake it for 1 hour and 20 minutes, but baking in the very center of my oven, that made it absolutely perfect. We love it, and I will definitely make this again!

Super tasty! Even my picky kiddo asked for more (and more, and more). I used olive oil, doubled all the spices, and used nutmeg since I didn't have allspice.

I love this bread.  Usually do a cream cheese frosting to top, and some toasted pecans.  Very yummy!

I have made this multiple times for my family and they love it! The only thing I changed is I used 3 smaller pans rather than two. I will definately be making this for years to come!

I halved the recipe because I only needed one loaf of bread.  For a half recipe I used 1c white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, and I substituted a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves for the allspice since I didn't have it on hand. Lastly, I used 1.5 cups white flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour.  I put it in the oven at 325 degrees (my oven cooks hot) and it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to bake.  Overall the end product was a nice, moist gingerbread, with a hint of pumpkin flavor.  Everyone enjoyed it, although no one raved.  I would make again.

Very good recipe.  Turned out really delicious but that I almost doubled the spices and it still didn't have quite enough spice.  Easy enough problem next time.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it turned out awesome.  I then added homemade pumpkin cream cheese icing to the warm-from-the-oven slices and there aren't words to describe the deliciousness.  Pumpkin cream cheese icing: one 7oz container of Trader Joe's pumpkin cream cheese (seasonal), 1/4c butter (softened), 1c confectioners sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, mix until delicious.

EASY! I didn't have baking powder and it still turned out great! I also added the spices to the dry mix instead of the wet so the spices didn't clump. I used a glass pyrex bread dish for half and the other half I poured into NordicWare Cars muffin pan... AWESOME! (NordicWare muffin pan=30 min baking time, glass pyrex dish=1hour10min baking time)

I usually make the Libby's pumpkin cranberry bread, so I thought I would try something different.  I cut the sugar down to 2 cups (one white, one brown) and I added an extra teaspoon of both cinnamon and ginger.  I only had 2 eggs and it still came out great!   It was just sweet enough, moist and had a wonderful flavor. Next time I will use all brown sugar, use 4t ginger and substitute applesauce for half of the oil.

The perfect pumpkin bread.  That's it, you don't have to look any further.  I made this as is and it turned out moist and good.  I baked it for between 50 and 55 minutes and it was definitely done.  I will for sure be making this for a long time, it came out perfect

I made this for a neighborhood brunch and was very pleased with the results.  The loaves were so moist, sweet, and tasty.  I used a sugar blend and egg substitute and it was still wonderful!  I added a 1/2 cup of golden raisins and they were a perfect addition.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This bread is SO GOOD! My husband who normally hates pumpkin loves this and I can't make enough of it for the both of us. However, I only had 1 1/4 cups of white sugar, so I substituted the rest with brown sugar. I also doubled the amount of spices and added milk chocolate chips into the batter. YUM! :)

Yum.  Found this recipe last fall and just baked this year's first batch.  Trying to be healthier, so I substitued EVOO and it still tasted great.  Also used fresh baked pumpkin.  Might try some brown sugar next time.  Also, made only one loaf and 18 muffins (30 mins) -- easier to freeze leftovers.  Thanks for a great fall recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly( but baked at 325 degrees),  and it came out great!  Instead of loafs I made 24 muffins and one mini-loaf.  I topped them with pecans for decorations and they were great.

I used half oil and half applesauce, and used 2 cups white sugar with 1cup brown. This alteration may have made the texture not what I expected and the aftertaste was too sweet. Would not make again as I did.

Love it.  Like other reviewers, doubled all spices (except cloves) but actually I wish I hadn't since the spices were a tad too overpowering.  Baked at 325 for exactly one hour and it was perfect, beautiful and moist.  Will make it again but will not double all spices next time, maybe just cinnamon.

First bake was the exact recipe as posted. a bit dry and not enough spices.
I had frozen pumpkin so like another reader i had left out the water.
Second bake. Doubled all spices except cloves...for ginger i did 2 tsp dried and 2 tsp grated. Added two heaping TBSP of ground flax seeds, did 1.5 cups white whole wheat, 2 cups AP. Cut oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup yogurt. cut sugar to one cup granulated, one cup packed.
Again left out the water because my homemade frozen pumpkin is more watery than canned. Added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  This batch came out GREAT. two big loaves, baked at 330 for one hour.
toothpick just barely comes out clean. Baked in clay loaf pans so that may help with keeping the sides from getting overdone....due to the adjustment to the recipe i give it a 4..but it was a good base to work from, and the comments helped with where i needed to tweak for my own taste.

Very yummy. I put mine in one round mould... had to cook it for much longer. Served cut into pieces, warmed in the oven with homemade caramel and ice cream. Thought the Gingerbread flavour could have been a bit stronger.. but still unreal!

I thought this was excellent. I modified this recipe out of necessity. I had a butternut squash that I wanted to use. I cut it in half and roasted it for 45 minutes in the oven on 375 F. I scooped out the pulp and used that instead of the canned pumpkin. Also, I added a small grating of nutmeg. In place of the ground cloves (which I did not have), I crushed 4 cardamom seeds and added that instead. It came out really well!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it is delicious. I did have to bake mine for an hour and half, but it may be my oven because I've had the same issue with other quick-bread recipes. The bread did have a bit of a crust because I baked it so long, but I actually liked it that way. The rest of the bread was incredibly moist and I will be adding it to my Thanksgiving menu this year!

My son's love this loaf, as do I but I did find a bit too sweet. I also added unsweetened applesauce in addition to the oil and it is very moist. I cooked it at 350 for 1 hr and 10 min, and it came out perfect! Next time I will only add about 1.5 cups sugar. Very Yummy afternoon snack!

I love, love, love this bread. I didn't change a thing and it came out perfectly. I made full loaves, min loaves and muffins for holiday gifts and received so many compliments. My husband and three year old also can't get enough. So yummy and the house smelled delicious while the bread was baking. This is definitely a keeper.

These came out great! I set the oven to 325 and had no burning issues. Made about 2 dozen muffins and one large loaf. The muffins baked for 25 minutes and the loaf for 1 hour. Great as gifts for many people since one batch made a large amount that could be split up and shared. I will be making this again and again!

I turned the oven down about 10 degrees and cooked it a bit longer and that seemed to help keep the outside from burning.  The recipe says to "lightly grease" the pans, but next time I'll grease them better because I had one loaf stick and I couldn't get it out in one piece.  I would also stir the spices into the dry ingredients first because they seemed to clump up when added directly to the wet ingredients.  Overall a great recipe.

Delicious! I made in a cupcake pan and topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. It makes about 30 cupcakes, which I baked at 325 for 25-30 minutes, testing with a toothpick for doneness. My kids loved them!

I made this today exactly by the recipe.  Since I wanted to give several smaller loaves as gifts, I used 6 mini ceramic loaf pans, filling them with about 1 cup each of mixture, and put the remainder into one regular loaf pan.  It took the mini pans about 30 minutes to bake.  It is delicious!  I'm so glad I found this to add to my Christmas baking file.  Thanks, Frosty!

I will definitely be making this again!  3 cups of sugar seemed excessive, so I decreased to 2 cups and when I tasted the bread I thought I could have gotten away with just a cup and a half of sugar.  I also decreased the oil, since there was so much liquid already.  One thing I did because of the other dishes I was cooking simultaneously: I had added everything except the baking soda, salt, and baking powder, and had to take the batter and set it aside for 15 minutes while I tended to a different dish.  I came back to it, and it seemed much thicker, almost like cake batter.  It also looked smoother, like the lumps had worked themselves out, so it seemed like less stirring for me.  So if you want to make things easy on yourself, set it aside for a while.  Just make sure the baking powder, salt, and baking soda are the last things- add them just before baking because they need to be freshly added in order to do their jobs properly.

I baked one 9x5 loaf at 325 for 1 hour, and 4 mini loaves for 40 minutes- they turned out moist (but not dense), light, and delicious. I only give it 4 stars because I prefer breads with nuts, fruits, chocolate chips., etc. But, this was delicious, truly. Also, I only added 1/2 tsp of cloves as they tend to over power the flavor, i feel.

This was really good and it got good reviews from my co-workers.  I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil and only 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  I didnt have ginger so I used pumpkin pie spice(doubled the amount) and eliminated all the other spices. Baked at 325 for 1 hr and 15 min.  Perfect!

I've been using the same old pumpkin bread recipe one of my elder sisters came home from school with back in the 70's, it's good, but not this good!!  Just shared some with the co-workers and they agree that's it's very yummy and a keeper!

Really good, except the spices are too strong and you don't taste any of the pumpkin. Otherwise, the texture and baking time is perfect. I assume you can mix in some carrot shreds too and top it with a little cream cheese frosting.

I'm making this as a gift for a friend today and picked this because of the great reviews.  it's still in the oven but smells wonderful!  It's taking longer than the recipe says. probably more like 75 mins. I added 1/ cup of roasted and shelled pumpkin seeds to the batter and sprinkled another 1/2 cup of the seeds evenly over the top of both loaves.  I can't wait to cut into it!

Excellent, This got rave reviews. Skipped the cloves and allspice. Made 1 loaf and the other half muffins to which I added shredded coconut, walnuts and raisins. Very good indeeed. Also used FRESH baked pumpkin, made a world of difference to the flavor and texture. Thanks

I would rate this 4 1/2 stars.  Very good and rich - the only changes I made were substituting half the oil for applesauce and 1/2 cup less sugar.

This is delish!  I usually make the Downeast Maine Pumpkin bread...also delish...but wanted to try this one.  They are very similar except this one has a little bit more spice and a tiny bit of baking powder.  Since I haven't made the other in a year, I can't say which I like better but both are exceptional so you can't lose!  I tried making this in a tube pan....oops...too much batter and it came out monster size.  I could have made it in two pans.  For the holidays, I'll be making them in smaller pans.  This is a no fail gift that everyone loves every year.  Highly recommended!

this was sooo YUMMY!!.. My son has a egg allergy so for two eggs i used egg sub.. then for the other 2 I used 1/2c apple sauce.. i also used half the oil and the other half i used more apple sauce. Because of that i held off half of the water and waited till i had everything mixed so see if I needed more. I didn't want it too spicy for the kids so on the clove, allspice and ginger i cut 1/4 tsp out. and sub 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and only two cups of white. (i figured the apple sauce adds sugar too.) made muffins out of them and added chocolate chips too some.. so yummy a definate keeper.

Wonderful and easy.  I added chocolate shavings to the recipe and toped it with the orange cream cheese icing on this web page.  This was a big hit at Halloween.

Fabulous!!! Followed the recipe exactly.  I did one 9x5 pan and four smaller loaf pans.  Moist and delicious.  When it calls for a large mixing bowl, it means a large mixing bowl.  I ended up doing the liquid in my 6 quart electric mixer bowl and the dry in a regular large mixing bowl.  It was just right when I added the dry to the wet ingredients.  I put three loaves in the freezer wrapped in plastic and aluminum foil and put those in a large ziplock freezer bag.  We ate the rest right off the bat.

I made this exactly as written and made 4 mini loaves, baked at 325 for 45 minutes.  I could have made more mini loaves.

I made this delicious bread today for the first time and I had to change a few things to make it a total 5-star recipe. I am an "organic" person and I used ALL organic products in this recipe.  I had to alter a couple of the ingredients to make this more delicious and organic.  The changes are as followed:  I used ORGANIC sugar and I used 1 1/2C of organic white sugar and 1 1/2C of organic brown sugar (TOTALLING 3 Cups as listed), I also used 1 C of ORGANIC COCONUT oil (instead of veg. oil), I used 3 C of ORGANIC whole wheat pastry flour, 1/4 C ORGANIC ground flax seed, 1/4 C ORGANIC unprocessed bran (TOTALLYING 3 1/2 C as recipe lists) and the last thing I did was use FRESH GRATED ORGANIC GINGER (instead of powdered ginger).  I bought organic canned pumpkin and organic spices, too. The best part of the changes was definitely the fresh ginger.  The bread just bursts with flavor and it's all due to the fresh ginger.  I highly recommend these changes.  The bread was also very, very moist!!! Instead of using PAM cooking spray in the pans, I recommend using butter (ORGANIC, of course). My family couldn't even wait to have a slice.  As soon as it was cool enough to eat, we polished off 1/2 a loaf!!!  Can't wait until breakfast time to enjoy more bread with my morning coffee!!!

I add lots more cinnamon and ginger- probably 2 TBLS each.  I used 1/2 C. applesauce and 1/2 C. oil, added 1 tsp. instant coffee to the wet ingredients, and 2 TBLS. cocoa to the dry to give the finished bread a dark color without altering the flavor, and baked 2 9x5 loaves at 325 for 1 hr 10 min.  Great recipe!

Awesome recipe!  This is the BEST thing I've ever baked - thanks for sharing.  The only thing I changed is that I added a tiny bit of grated ginger.  Next time I will try less sugar like some suggested - it is definitely sweet (but not terribly so) however I think the spices might come through more clearly by cutting out 1/3 of the sugar.  I cut the recipe in half and only made one loaf, and baked it (as some suggested) at 325 deg, but because it was only one loaf it was done in 1 h 15 m.  You have to try this recipe!

Very good, very sweet!  I added 1T of vanilla extract to the pumpkin mixture. For the sugar I used 2 cups white, and 1 cup of brown.  Im not sure if that made this bread more sweet then it should've been, but I will definitely reduce the sugar next time.  I also added up all the spices, and used that amount of Pumpkin Spice.  Easy Peasy, and definitely a keeper!

I made this exactly according to the instructions, but ended up with a super dense lump of banana bread wannabe. The loaves smelled fantastic, but even after doubling the cooking time, they were doughy and yet burned. I have made pumpkin bread before with great succes, but not sure this is the right recipe for me.

This is so yummy and my house smelled amazing for hours (an added benefit).  I made a few alterations:  I can't bring myself to eat all that oil, so I substituted unsweetened, organic applesauce.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla and a tbsp. of molassis to the wet ingredients before adding the dry ones.  The molassis gave it a bit more of a gingerbread taste.  LOVE IT!

Delicious. Only made half, and I was still short on sugar but it was GOOuoood. Also I sub'd some apple sauce for oil. Baked as muffins, they came out moist and perfect. Topped with a swirl of cream cheese frosting.

5-Star recipe.  I never would have thought I'd like anything with pumpkin in it so this was my first try at pumpkin anything.  Taste so much like a spice cake.  No alterations and the bread turned out perfect.  I've made this many times now, shipping it out of state to friends, etc.  A must try!!

Wow!  I am allergic to cinnamon, so I was looking for an alternative recipe that would highlight other spices. This was perfect.  I added just a splash of vanilla, but the rest I did as written and without the cinnamon. Ginger with the nutmeg and cloves are delicious!

OMG this is so good. Very flavorful, very light and moist.  I halved it and baked it about 10 more minutes than called for, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. And the smell in my kitchen is heavenly!  Strongly recommend this recipe to everyone.

Great recipe.  Even my non-pumpkin eating husband loved.  To keep it healthy I sustituted 1 cup of Egg Beater for the 4 eggs and 1 cup of applesauce for the  oil. Turned out wonderful.

This recipe was DELICIOUS!  I reduced the amounts to reflect only 1 loaf.   I did not have ground allspice, so I substituted it for more cinnamon and cloves.  I also added vanilla to the wet mixture.  I used more pumpkin puree, since it was left over.   I also substituted 1/2 the vegetable oil for applesauce to make it a little bit healthier.  It took a little longer to cook because of the changes, but in an hour and a 1/2 we had a wonderful smell coming from our kitchen!   Will definitely make this again!!!

This recipe was amazing.  My husband didn't like pumpkin bread until now.  I took the advice and doubled all but the allspice plus I added about a teaspoon of nutmeg.  I also cut the sugar to 2 cups because I added a cream cheese filling.  1 thing of cream cheese, 1/2 c sugar, 1 Tbs flour, and 1 egg.  Then I filled the middle with it. It turned out great.  My husband is already asking me to make this every Christmas!

Phenomenal! My baking powder must have been old and it didn't rise much but they ate it all in one setting. Second time with fresh baking powder it was lovely.

This is so good! the spices are soooo seasonal and lovely. I made w/ 1.5c whole wheat flour and 2c a.p., which made them a little denser than the normal recipe probably, but they were so filling. I used 1c white sugar and 1c brown, and that was the perfect sweetness. The recipe made 7 giant muffins (6 in a giant muffin tin and the rest of the batter in a ramekin) and I made them for a special winter breakfast. They were such a hit! Thanks for the keeper recipe!

AMAZING! I made two regular sized loaves, and a smaller "test" loaf..the smaller one was done faster (which was my plan) and so I got to try it while the other two were still baking. OH MY GOODNESS! It's amazing! When I was mixing it, I did add a bit more cinnamon, cloves and allspice, a tiny bit more ginger. Everything else I kept the same. For my test loaf, its amazing as is, better with a bit of butter, and superb with a chocolate glaze! (search chocolate glaze here on the site, highest rating, omit the vanilla) This will be a fantastic breakfast bread, with the chocolate it'll be a lovely dessert bread! Thank you for this keeper!

I know it's hard to accurately rate a recipe when you don't follow the directions to a T but I loved this bread. The changes I made were; I doubled the spices except the allspice, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups all purpose flour and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour, in place of the oil I used 1/2 cup Lighter Bake, 2 whole eggs and 1/2 egg substitute, 2 cups fresh pureed pumpkin, and by mistake threw in a teaspoon of vanilla. The results were yummy and is a healthier version. Next time I might try adding some shredded carrot just for texture but it's great as is!

This really is as good as everyone claims. My DH (who doesn't like pumpkin) ate about half of one loaf by himself. I did add some pecans & coconut to one loaf that another recipe had suggested but really it was great as written.

I made Cream Cheese Icing to frost one loaf and left the other plain; the frosted loaf vanished quickly, but the plain one didn't last long either.  Everyone raved how moist and perfect the texture was.  Delicious!

I followed this recipes exactly as it was written. Tried the batter and it definately needed more spices. The end result was way way to sweet. Very disappointing.

A great bread for the autumn and winter holidays!  The spices can definitely stand to be doubled though.  There were a number of opinions with regard to the amount of sugar to use; I used one cup white, one cup brown, and approx. 1/3 c. molasses.  Next time I will add an additional 1/2 c. of brown sugar as it wasn’t quite sweet enough (I don’t have a big sweet tooth, either).  I substituted most of the oil with applesauce, but I think a 50/50 ratio would work better next time.  Also, I made one loaf and a batch of muffins with this recipe, but I wasn’t thinking and baked them both for 75 minutes at 325°.  The muffins shouldn’t have baked anywhere neat that long!  They were still salvageable though, but not quite as soft as I’d like them to be.

I made this for a Bridal Shower, where I also had profiteroles with chocolate sauce and heart-shaped shortbread cookies.  I gotta say that this loaf was the only dessert that was eaten up! (and there were only 8 women!) Wonderful!

This bread is wonderful!! I did make some changes so it would be a little more healthy. I used applesauce instead of oil, and half whole wheat flour. I also add extra of each spice to give it more of a "gingerbread" flavor. I've baked it as muffins and mini loaves. Makes great snacks!

The best pumpkin gingerbread BY FAR! I use fresh minced ginger in place of the dried....2 tbsp fresh to 2 tsp dried and substitute brown sugar for white...it is wonderful!

I do agree that you should bake this at 325 degrees F and add about 10 minutes to cooking time...

Delicious! Beautiful, tender texture. We tried it after it had cooled to room temperature and it was great. It was even better the next morning for breakfast! The hubs said it was one of the best quick breads he'd ever eaten. Definitely a keeper. I was about 1/4 cup short on oil so I substituted the difference with applesauce. That's the only change I made (out of necessity) to the original recipe. Oh, and I made this into mini-loaves, which cut around 20 minutes off the baking time.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now, but kept forgetting to rate it.  It is the perfect balance of spices and always moist.  The best part is the way it makes the house smell while it baking!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I wanted to find a recipe that put my husband's pumpkin for roasted pumpkin seeds to more use.  I was not expecting to like this recipe since I don't really like anything pumpkin flavored, but I was pleasantly surprised.  We both really liked it!  I followed the recipe to a T, except that I reduced the cooking temperature to 325 and put the mix into muffin tins (cooking for a little longer than 30 min).

A great recipe - I wanted to put a scoop of vanilla ice cream next to it!  I even substituted 1 cup of all purpose flour with one cup whole wheat flour and it turned out great.  Couldn't even tell I made the switch - but it still had the added nutrition.

Way too much fat & sugar in this recipe for me,so made many changes to make this a healthier bread. Cut the sugar in half, used 1/4 cup oil & 3/4 cup applesauce, substituted with light spelt flour & added 1/4 cup ground flax. Still turned out moist & delicious!

Very good. We really enjoyed this. I greatly reduced the sugar amount. I only use 1 1/4c and it was plenty sweet. (we topped with a bit of powdered sugar for presentation) I also replaced 1/2 oil with applesauce.  Will make again and again!

I love this recipe.  I took the advice from another reviewer and made it in a 10" bundt pan.  While it was still warm, I spread some canned cream cheese frosting over the cake.  It was a huge hit at the office. So moist with just the right blend of spices.

I have been baking this bread for a couple of years, but never reviewed it. It is delicious! I substitute half of the oil with applesauce, and it is very moist. I also use 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of white, but will probably try cutting out some of the sugar next time. I always make mini loaves and give them as holiday gifts; this time I added chocolate chips in some loaves and pecans and dried cherries in some loaves. You can't go wrong with this recpie.

Absolutely fabulous!  I took one loaf to my office to share.  It disappeared in minutes, and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I love the perfect balance of spices and the moistness.  This would be a perfect recipe for mini loaves to give for homemade holiday gifts.

this recipe is great! It's quick to whip up and while its baking I have time to spend with my kids!  It's easy to make and tastes great! My kids gave these loaves to their teachers as Christmas presents and they loved them! I received several calls from the teachers asking for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe, and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is I made a couple of changes to it to make it slightly healthier. I substituted 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour for the white flour, doubled the spices, added in about a cup and a half of raisins and added about 2 tablespoons of wheat germ. It still came out incredibly moist! And stayed that way for the entire week it was in my ridge. I live alone, so having a recipe that stays moist as long as it takes me to finish it is great! I gave some pieces to friends as well and everyone raved!

Fabulous bread!  It was important for me to find a pumpkin bread that was really flavorful AND really moist......this had was both.  Super moist and full of flavor.  I loved the perfect amount of pumpkin and ginger. I only had one loaf pan, so I used that and a small bundt pan.  The bread in the bundt pan came out fantastic.  It was so moist and had a wonderful outer crust.  It cooked in about 35 min.  The loaf pan took longer; my oven tends to be hot and cooks quickly.  After about 45 minutes, some edges were burning so I decided to cover the loaf in foil and continue to cook.  I cooked it for another 20 minutes after placing the foil over it.  This bread is super moist and has wonderful ginger flavor....thank you!

This recipe had a great flavor...very spicy. However, I erronously followed advice from another reviewer. I sprinkled a sugar and spice mixture on the top before baking, which sounded like it would be yummy. However, I believe this caused the loaves to NOT rise during baking, which was a major disaster. Therefore, I cannot fault the recipe itself (since I willingly changed it). It tasted great, but obviously had the wrong texture. I am writing this review in hopes I may save someone else from making the same mistake.

This was fantastic! The top has the most wonderful little 'crunch' to it. Wonderful texture. I did not change a thing except for baking at 325 for about 1 hour 5 min. I will most definitely make this again.

Absolutely loved this bread! I followed one reviewer's advice and cooked at 325 for 1hr 15 min. They turned out beautifully and I'm looking forward to making these again. 
Oh, and if you just follow the written recipe, she leaves out adding one spice from her list. Make sure you get all the spices she lists!

Good bread! I made it with real pumpkin and it was wonderful! Defintiely needs to cook the whole hour when using fresh pumpkin, otherwise it won't rise and cook through. I will definitely be using this again!

Yum!  This was so moist and baked up beautifully.  The only changes I made were used 1 Cup of brown sugar and 2 Cups of white sugar and replaced the oil with an equal amount of applesauce.  I baked it in three 8x4 loaf pans for 70 minutes at 325.

The most delicious gingerbread ever!!  I add a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and otherwise follow the recipe.  Instead of using 2 9x5 bread pans - try splitting the batter between two bundt cake pans - one for home and one to give.  Makes a huge bundt cake - with a longer baking time - if you use the batter all in one.  I did that the first time I made it and have split it into two ever since!  Don't ask me how many times I've made this since i discovered it in August....I've lost count!  Just try it, you won't be disappointed if you're looking for a pumpkin gingerbread!

This bread was wonderful! My 9 year daughter who is not big on anything cakey loves this! I had baked our jack-o-lantern and frozen it in zip lock baggies. I took out 2 baggies and let them thaw and poured the excess water off, and that is the pumpkin I used. I didn't have any allspice so I substituted 1/8 of a tsp of nutmeg 1/4 of cinnamon and 1/4 of cloves. I poured the batter into a 9 x 13 cake pan and it was baked through in just 30 minutes. The house smelled wonderful too!

Very good! I increased the spices a bit, because I like a little extra. Next time I might half the recipe, as I didn't realize it made two loaves! That was my silly mistake though. Very good pumpkin bread.

This is a very fragrant bread.  It makes a dense, moist, strongly spiced loaf.  Was enjoyed very much.

I love this recipe! I have made it several times, and I can't stop eating it until it's gone. Lately I have resorted to giving some away as quickly as possible, so I don't have the chance to gorge myself on it. I do have some trouble getting the middle to cook all the way through when I make full-size loaves, so I switched to mini-loaves and that works much better for me. This bread smells and tastes GREAT, and of course it fills your house with that wonderful spicy baking scent. Awesome!

Easy and delicious.  My boyfriend's exact words were "THIS is what I'm talkin' 'bout!"  Stayed moist for days (well, until we managed to finish it off).  Will definitely make this again.

I should have rated this one along time ago. I have been baking it for over a year. Always a hit. I don't add cloves but do throw in some pumpkin pie spice for a little extra flavor. Love it!

Good. It was very moist. Virtually the same thing as the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread, but the spices are a bit different. I like the extra kick of the ginger. Didn't have allspice, so I used another teaspoon of cinnamon. I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree. Made one 9x5 loaf and 12 muffins. Definitely try this recipe.

i agree with the others who said this is more of a pumpkin bread, but that doesn't take away from how amazing it is! i followed the recipe exactly except i added 1/2 C less of sugar and added 2 C of semi-sweet chocolate chips. delicious!

Tastes really good...but I had some issues. First, it's a lot less bread-y and more cakey than I expected or wanted. I know there's a fine line between pumpkin bread and cake to begin with, but this was really cakey. Second, it's been in the oven for about an hour and 20 minutes and the center is still mush. I am cooking one loaf, and make muffins out of the leftover batter (which is how I know it tastes great). Even the muffins took about 25 minutes, and we're not talking jumbo sized. 
I also didn't have allspice, so threw in extra cinammon, some cloves, and nutmeg. I think a 9x5 pan may be a little large, which is causing my cooking problems.

This is an excellent bread. I made it exactly as written but doubled all the spices (even the cloves!). Instead of adding them to the wet mixture, I added them to the dry and then combined with the wet. Just seemed like an easier way and kept the mixture from being overmixed and risking it getting tough. It has a great texture and although it may not be the healthiest of recipes, makes a wonderful gift!

Wow, this is a really fabulous and moist recipe.  I made it into a bundt cake and sprinkled powdered sugar on it for a Thanksgiving dessert and it got rave reviews from young and old alike.  Like the other reviewers, I doubled the spices in the recipe.  I also mixed the spices with the dry ingredients first to distribute the spice flavors evenly.  Instead of water, I used milk and I decreased the sugar and the oil by half a cup each, and it still came out fabulous! The bundt cake took a bit longer to bake though... I had it in the oven for about one hour and 20 minutes before the toothpick came out clean.

Delicious! Very flavorful and moist! My modifications: used 2.5 cups Splenda instead of sugar. Didn't have ginger on hand so I added all the spices as called for PLUS about 1T pumpkin spice...gave enough ginger taste.
I baked in three smaller loaf pans (approx 8/3). I called it a Trio of Flavors: regular, cinnamon chip, walnut. What a hit!! Just sliced them and put in a 9x13 and took to work. People were impressed and loved it!

This bread is awesome!!! I make this all the time and everyone who has tried it raves about it. It is like eating a piece of Autumn with the pumpkin and all the spices. I also love that this recipe makes two loaves, one to give and one to keep! The recipe is perfect as is, don't change a thing.

This pumpkin gingerbread is delicious but the recipe calls for ground cloves but in the directions it doesn't mention them again.  Also it says cooking time 45mins. in the intro. but the directions say cook 1 hour.

I enjoyed this bread a lot.  The recipe is almost identical to Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread also on this site, but this has more spices, so I actually like it better.

Excellent! I cut the recipe in half and made 1 loaf. It had to be baked about 70 min (it was still a bit doughy in the middle after only an hr.) It was moist, flavorful, and smelled heavenly! My 9 1/2 yr. old daughter ate 3 pieces.  :)

Very dense, moist and full of flavor.  I frosted one with cream cheese frosting and it was excellent! I froze the second one, which will be great to just pull out of the freezer when I need a dessert but don't have the time or feel like baking. I will make this again. Thanks!

A winner!  I threw in a couple of handfuls of mini chocolate chips and then I divided the batter between mini-loaf pans.  I believe it made about 7 small loaves.  I sliced it up and it made a great finger food at the party.  Everyone wanted the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe as is.  However, I took the advise of a few others and used some substitutions... I used apple cider instead of water, substituted 1 cup brown sugar for white, used 1 cup whole wheat flour for white and omitted the allspice (just because I didn't have any at the time) but doubled the ginger, cinnamon and cloves.  It was so good that I had requests for the recipe.  I took this loaf to church for a bake sale and it was all gone.  To top it off, I also frosted with white canned frosting from Betty Crocker.

This bread is awesome! It's SO moist. I substituted milk for the water and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  I also threw in some pie spice because I like my pumpkin with a kick! My kids devoured this and we will be making MORE!

Really good!  I used buttermilk instead of water because I had some on hand.  Also, I added walnuts.  These ideas were from other reviewers.  This recipe is good as is, but variations with rasins, nuts, and/or frosting will also work well.

I didn't care for the ginger flavor so I substituted it with 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and it was the best pumpkin bread I've ever made! I made several of these loaves for Christmas presents and they were a real hit. Very moist, tasty and easy to make.

My mother and I have been making gingerbread every year for Christmas for as far back as I can remember.  I talked her into making this instead of the usual, and it turned out great!  It was so moist and fragrant!  We will be using this from now on.

Everyone LOVED this recipe! I thought I'd need to make a cream cheese frosting for it but it was sweet enough. I handed mini loaves of these out for Christmas 2019 instead of cookies and they were a hit. I instead used 1.5 cups of brown sugar and 1.5 cups granulated sugar. Additionally, when making mini loaves, the back time is 30 minutes (learned that one after the first batch was rock hard on the outside lol!)

I used my Oster bread machine to make the dough only. I like  the light airy fluffy texture. Two loaf pans for the batter. I am going to use *muffin pans on my next bake. 
I also added one cup of finely chopped walnuts with a tbsp of molasses.
It goes incredibly well with *Pumpkin and *Allspice.
I am a new member, in the future I will share and post some of my bakes.

This recipe is awesome.  I subbed brown sugar for half of the white sugar and tripled the spices.  Absolutely amazing.  I used an eggnog buttercream to top it off.  Best recipe I've tried this year!

I rarely give anything a 5 star rating. This bread truly deserves it. 
I found this last year and returned to it cuz it is so good, it is easy to make, and nearly everybody enjoys it. 
While baking this bread your home is filled with the scent of the season. 
I’ll be making this one for a good long time to come.

We really liked it. I did decrease the sugar a half cup and added extra cinnamon. I made mini loaves and only baked them 30 minutes. Next time I`m going to use a cream cheese glaze on them while they are warm.

Would definitely make it again! Moist and delicious-- with a real spicy kick. Following some other reviews, I substituted half applesauce, half oil and half brown sugar, half white sugar. Doubled all the spices (except ginger) and added 1 Tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup walnuts. Has a real spicy kick... perfect with a glass of apple cider!

This recipe is very nice. The bread comes out moist, and with a very nice flavour. You can add icing but I prefer it alone. Perfect for October and November season

Tastes great!  I used gluten-free flour, 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar , and lowered the oven temp to 325 for 1 1/4 hour as suggested by other reviewers.  Yield was  loaf and three generous mini loaves.

This was a delicious recipe, and (Since I'm such a sucker for pumpkin spice) adored the flavor. It's so simple too, and I enjoyed the warm spice flavors. Idea: if you don't have ground cloves, put them in a plastic sandwich bag and crush with the back of a spoon.

Double the recipe!!  If you don't take 2-3 loaves to the office and leave one at home (as I do), it freezes beautifully.  And not just for the holidays, but any time of year.  I did play with the recipe a bit, due to husband's diet.  I substituted half the oil with the same amount of unsweetened yogurt, as well as replacing half the regular flour with whole wheat.  No change in taste, but feeling a bit more virtuous when eating it (and feeding it to people).

Super easy and super tasty. I might add more spice next time, but recipe is great as is. Made it in a bunny pan instead of a loaf (325F for about an hour) and it came out BEAUTIFUL. Great quick-bread for a nice occasion.

I've made this twice.  Both times I found I had to bake it for an hour and a half for it to be done inside.    My oven is a Kitchen Aid and fairly new.  Followed the recipe exactly with one minor adjustment.  I  substituted a half cup of whole wheat flour for some of the all purpose flour.   Someone at church has already asked me for the recipe.   It's a keeper.

I expected a much stronger gingerbread flavor, which can be overwhelming, but was pleasantly surprised to taste more pumpkin than gingerbread! I made this as a Thanksgiving day breakfast, and the whole family loved it! The recipe made enough for 19 muffins and a small loaf.

Excellent bread.  I did follow the other reviewers recommendation of reducing the sugar a bit and mixing the spices with the dry ingredients.  It was moist and delicious.  I am going to make it again using fresh ginger.

So delicious!! I baked at 325 for an hour in a bundt pan.  Doubled the spices and mixed with the dry ingredients. Used 1/2c applesauce 1/2c oil. Instead of 3c sugar I used 1c white sugar and 1c dark brown sugar. Turned out fabulous. Not very sweet. Just came out of the oven and is already half gone.

This is really delicious & easy. I did reduce the sugar to 2 cups & I baked it in 3 smaller loaf pans & set the oven to 325 for 60 minutes!! Turned out perfect. I think the next time I will reduce the sugar even more.

Made a ton of changes including the amount of spices, pumpkin, flour, and sugar- this recipe would have been way too sweet and bland without some edits. Please don't leave a 5 star review for a recipe you had to change!

Love this recipe as a starting point -- I reference it often in making variations.  I took the advice of others and made these modifications to make a bread that was a little healthier: Reduced sugar to 2 cups and when I have it use half/half brown and white sugar.  Replaced 1 cup veg oil with .25 cup veg oil and .75 cup applesauce.  Replaced AP flour with half/half AP and whole wheat flour.  Doubled the spices.   
 I live at 7500 feet and bake this at 350 for about 1 hour 20 minutes and it comes out perfect.  I'm about to try this recipe with gluten free flour for my girlfriend.

I replaced oil with applesauce and added 2 tablespoons of vanilla, also upped the spices, removed cloves and added pumpkin pie spice. So I guess I sorta made this cake, loved my results. Also drizzled a maple syrup icing. Delish

I tend to find many loaf recipes too sweet and oily.  In this case I cut back a bit on the sugar (2.5 cups) and oil (3/4 cup) and the recipe turned out fine.  I also added about 1/3 cup of finely chopped crystallized ginger which definitely gave it an extra gingery zip.  It's a nice autumn recipe that's good hot or cold, for breakfast or dessert.

I have used this recipe for years now, and I honestly see no need to try another recipe. This is everything I would want in a pumpkin bread recipe, and the added spices are just an incredible bonus!

I was able to make this into 1 loaf and 2 pans of muffins. Both were absolutely delightful! Thankfully, it was the right amount of spice. Not overwhelming at all. I made these for people at work and they loved them! I will be making these again.

Have made this a few times and the family loves it!  It is so moist and full of gingerbread flavor.  It is also very easy to make.  I do have to add just a little extra time to get it done all the way through.

Excellent. Will cut in half next time, because my largest mixing bowl was barely big enough for all the batter, but turned out perfectly. Don't listen to the reviews saying it's too sweet- it's actually not that sweet, to me. Will definitely make again.

I only had enough left over pumpkin for one loaf. I have two young kids. They’ve been home 15 minutes. Half the loaf is gone. Math unnecessary.

Pretty much the perfect quick bread recipe.  I had a mystery squash from the garden, so I roasted it like a pumpkin in the oven, pureed it, and used it instead of canned pumpkin.  Delicious!

I used orange juice in place of water.  I added chunky applesauce in place of oil.  I added a bag of chocolate chips.  It turned out really good.

This was fantastic.  The only thing I changed was cutting out 1 cup of sugar.  I routinely cut some of the sugar out of most recipes due to diabetics in the family.

This was one of the best things I made over the 2017 holidays.  I used half brown and half white sugar but did cut down on the sugar by half a cup.  Used half white and half wheat flour.  Used applesauce instead of some of the oil.  For the spices, added to the dry ingredients and used 1.5 times the amount.  My friends and family LOVED this.  Makes a lot - I got 12 big muffins and one big loaf.  The loaf was better for serving.  Topped it with a dollop of Cool Whip.  My son said "Mom - you MADE this?"  I love making them happy.

This recipe was a hit. I followed the suggestion of the previous reviewers and reduced the cooking temp for a slightly longer cook time and it worked beautifully. I know that I will make it again and add a cream cheese frosting!!

I used gluten-free flour blend per diet restrictions.  I used 1/2 apple butter and 1/2 oil, dropped the clove, increased other spices. yummy!

These are delicious! Giving this a 4 star because I had to decrease the amount of sugar to 2 cups. 3 cups of sugar would have been super sweet.

Made this with some reviewers alterations: half white and half brown sugar.  Keep the remainder of the recipe as is and you will have a very moist and delicious !!!! gingerbread.  Made this for my Visiting Teachers...I was asked for the recipe when she got home and had tasted it.  Lol  
Thanks, Frosty!!  This is now my go-to gingerbread base.

I could not stop eating this gingerbread - it was so easy and delicious! I cooked it about 10 minutes longer than it said too because the middle was still raw and added only 2 cups of sugar. Highly recommend this recipe!

I feel bad for recipe authors when recipe reviews have so many changes the recipe isn't the same, but I did make 2 little changes to an awesome recipe. I didn't have allspice so I replaced with pumpkin pie spice, same amounts.  I also cut the sugar to 2 1/4 cups just because I prefer my bread a tad less sweet. But you really can't go wrong with this recipe-- just as its written!

As it stands, pretty decent recipe. With the added reviews, AWESOME! It was a family hit! Everyone loved it. We doubled all of the spices. Since it made 2 loaves, we made one in a nonstick, which was super moist. The other was in my pampered chef loaf pan, which was somewhat drier. Although there was a difference, it was def still moist. This will be a family holiday staple going forward. I adjusted for half brown sugar half white sugar and double the spices. I also baked at 325 for 1hr 15 mins, as Granny suggested.

I've made this Pumpkin Gingerbread dozens of times, but with one very delicious variation: I replace the 2/3 cups of water with Guinness stout.  This adds another layer of rich flavor to an already wonderful recipe. Now friends, family and neighbors asks me to make this cake whenever there is a celebration or get together.   If you double the recipe, it takes one full bottle of Guinness.  Best if you open the bottle the day before and let it loose some carbonation before you start, but it will still work if you don't.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used fresh pumpkin so I eliminated the water.  Reduced the cloves to 1/2 tsp and baked at 325 for 1 hr 15 minutes. Based on suggestions in the reviews.  Came out perfect.  Added Hershey’s cinnamon chips on top of batter before cooking.

Great flavor!  Very sweet. Spices up the old traditional pumpkin nut bread!  Next time I should stir the spices into the dry ingredients rather than the wet so the cloves don't clump together. Middle takes a while to bake, may want to adjust temp. to 325 & increase baking time: Lg loaves-325/1hr 15 min; Mini loaf 325/45min; Muffins 325/20 min. (Made first time at 554 ft. elevation)

This  is a favorite Fall bread recipe , I esp. liked the flavor ginger added to the pumpkin. I made one change, for vegetable oil I used coconut oil which is delicious!  Now I am making it again.

This was the best, it got great reviews from my family and friends on Thanksgiving weekend. The only thing I did was do half white and half brown sugar, but everything else was according to the recipe.

I will make it again. I use 1/4 tsp of ground clove,  just because
I  don't like the taste of cloves.  I replaced the white sugar for brown. The loafs turned out great,
Very moist and tasty.

Great bread , moist & very tasty. I added more ginger because we Love gingerbread. I make blueberry gingerbread very often served with cool whip or whipped cream an very tasty. So I might try a piece of pumpkin gingerbread served that way also.   Will make this bread often too. 
Going to try the Banana pumpkin bread next!!!

I halved the recipe for just one loaf and I used pumpkin puree from a sugar pumpkin I grew in my garden.  I also added candied walnuts on top. The bread is excellent, but it's not a true gingerbread. Still excellent tho.

This turned out pretty great! The main  changes I made were as follows: I  reduced the oil, sugar and water a bit because I added in 1 cup of sweetened yogurt I needed to use up.  To compensate for liquid, I also added in sour milk.  Added 1 chopped  old(unpeeled) apple, dredged that and also crushed walnuts in the dry ingredients before putting it all together.  Added a very generous amount of vanilla, too.  I always put way more cinnamon than called for cuz we love it. I also am generous with all other spices. I even add some black pepper and nutmeg  to add to the flavor party!   After the fruit and nut additions, this made 9 mini loaves. Despite other warnings of burning and dryness, I stuck to my preferred muffin method and baked at 420* for about 25-ish minutes. I usually bake muffins at 425, but these were baked in the flimsy aluminum disposable pans, so i lowered the heat. after the 25  minutes, i quit timing, just checking every few 4 minutes or so with a skewer. Also, my tried and true trick for a great rise is to let eggs warm a bit in hot water from the sink while I am putting the rest of the recipe together.  That pretty much brings the eggs to room temperature, as you usually read in other's advice.   LAST BUT NOT LEAST! I ALWAYS SPRINKLE WHITE SUGAR ALL OVER THE TOP OF EVERY QUICK BREAD OR MUFFIN I BAKE! HELPS BEAUTIFULLY BROWN THE TOP AND ADDS A PLEASING CRISP TO THE CROWN!  Very happy  with the result, not dry at all, had a lovely rise and round shape to the l

This is one of my favourite recipes.  It is difficult to get tinned pumpkin in the UK as it is not always stocked in the supermarket but when it is I bulk buy.  I double up on all the spices as the given amounts in this recipe are a little mild for my taste.  I also bake on 325/170c/150fan assisted oven for 1hr 15 mins for a loaf & 25 mins for cupcakes.  Try making a ginger frosting with this as it is delicious!

My go-to recipe, I have made this 4 times and everyone who tries it, loves it.  
Changes I have made:  oven temp at 350 for 1.25 hours in silicone bakeware.  Makes removing the loaf so easy!
I  doubled the ginger and added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the dry ingredients, along with all the other spices.
Pumpkin comes in 398ml cans in Canada - so I just add it all - cooks great.

the best bread I've made to date!  I usually double the pumpkin and add 2 tab. of vanilla.  this makes the bread wonderfully moist from first slice to the last and the flavor is fantastic!  this bread freezes beautifully!  I usually have enough for three loaves, and everyone begs me for a loaf and I get monthly requests to make it.  this ius definitely a keeper!

Great loaf, moist, fragrant and delicious. I did cut down on the sugar, 2 cups instead 3 cups. And I did 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup molasses. I also added some chopped candied ginger. I recommend this recipe!!

Lovely texture, aroma, flavor.  Quick to make and great to give as holiday gifts.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and enjoyed the effect.  I think I will try it again using fresh ginger.

This is such great bread!! I had made it before and forgotten about it. I'm glad I saw it again today!! I did substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to bake it at 325 for 1h15. It worked perfectly!!  We will make this again and again! My husband and kids love it!!

This turned out amazing!!!  Only change I made was cut the sugar in half.  The 3 cups, I felt, was just too much.  I did put a sugar glaze on it so that probably made up for the reduced sugar but it turned out perfect even without the glaze!  Will definitely make this again and again!!

I've been making this recipe for several years now and am finally saying thank you! The only change that I make is that I peel and mince fresh ginger instead of using powdered. How much fresh ginger? I've found that more is better -- I probably mince almost a quarter-cup for these two loaves, and people rave. A big hit every time!

Instead of making two loafs of pumpkin bread I made one and used the rest of the batter to make cupcakes. The cupcakes cook in about half the time. I am going to be using this recipe for thanksgiving.

Inconceivably delicious!  There's some kind of crazy voodoo w this bread -- my people can't stop shoveling it down.  I stayed true to the recipe with the 1 exception of using oj instead of water, which I do with most all spice breads.  Can't go wrong with even more flavor!  Baked into muffins rather than loaves... it took 20 min for regular size muffins and 14 min for minis. These are divine.

I dont like "breads" of any sort ie banana bread etc because they are just so greasy so I followed some of the healthy tips on here and it was excellent. I used the cream cheese frosting from this site to top it off.  These were my tweaks......1 cup white sugar and 1 cup packed brown sugar. 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil. I doubled the ginger, 1.5 of cinnamon and allspice. I also baked it at 325 and added 15 minutes.  Came out perfectly .  Took the 2 loaves to work and they were gone in less than 30 mins and demands for more were made.

A good moist  quick bread that I would make again.  I would probably add more pumpkin and spices, as I found the flavors didn't really come out.  Otherwise, a good recipe.

Only change I made was using apple sauce instead of oil, and it came out amazing. The ginger gives it such a fun zing!

I just made this and I cut the recipe in half because I had a half can of pumpkin left.  I used three mini loaf pans really filled .  They baked at 325 for thirty minutes .  Glad I checked them when I did . They were done.  I added more spices even though I cut recipe in half and added a handful or so of mini bits.  This is so moist and fantastic.  My grandson is here after school and does not like pumpkin bread but I convinced him to try it . He loved it!

Delicious! Soft and full of flavor. Works in High Altitude without any changes. I followed recipe without changes. I used a metal pan and a stone one, and the metal one performed better (it was done in less time and seemed softer). Next time I will line the pan with parchment cause it got a little stuck. So good!

Made this tonight. Instead of oil I used a cup of butter. I also added walnuts. I dusted top with powdered sugar after getting them out of the pan. The flavor was absolutely delicious. Family members came back for seconds. There was no greasy feel to this bread that the oil will bring. The crumb was moist, but did fall apart a little. Not sure why. The butter?

I halved the recipe, then accidentally added too much water, switched the amounts of baking soda and powder, and had to put it in two very irregularly shaped, small baking dishes. It's still delicious!

Not the strongest flavored pumpkin bread I've made, but good -  moist, tasty, and easy to make.   Will  make it again with more pumpkin and spices for additional depth of flavor.

Less sugar method: This turned out great for me. The only thing I changed was instead of 3 c white sugar I used 1 c white sugar, 1 c brow sugar, 1 c molasses. I liked the result but I'm sure molasses changed the flavor from the original recipe quite a bit. It also makes it a very dark brown color bread. I think with the spices in the recipe though the molasses doesn't taste overly strong and is a much healthier sweetener alternative. I also didn't have ground cloves and still tasted great. My family loved it as well, but we don't have strong sweet tooths.

This is a wonderful holiday pumpkin recipe. I used a 16x11 Pyrex glass dish. Also I only used 2 cups of sugar which was perfect. Topped it with "Heath, milk chocolate, toffee bits", and served it with vanilla ice cream. It was perfect.

This is excellent.  Best recipe I have had for pumpkin bread.  I made it in two loaf pans.  The only thing I had to change was the baking time.....from 50 min to 65 or 70 minutes.

REALLY good, with just two tweaks. First, I reduced the sugar to only two cups (next time I'll reduce it even further). Second, I used a half cup of unsweetened applesauce and a half cup of oil. It turned out very moist, and the spices stood out from the sweetness. My fifth grader and I are both very happy with the modified recipe!

It came out excellent! I did double (maybe triple) the spices. It only took about 45 minutes to cook at 325. I ended up using a 9x5 and 6x6 pans. May try diving it up into several loaf pans next time.

This is a wonderful recipe which is good to make any time of the year. I use 2.5 cups of sugar and increase the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons but decrease the cloves and allspice to half a teaspoon each keeping the ginger per the recipe...just personal preference. Takes exactly 1 hour in my oven at 350° just as the recipe states. My husband who does not like pumpkin, eats this bread spread with Kerrygold butter although it's delicious on its own. Everyone loves it including the grandkids!  For ease of removal from the pans, I line the length of the pans and up the short sides with greaseproof paper. I let them cool slightly then place on cooling racks.  This bread also freezes very well. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this today and it smells and tastes amazing. It could definitely go for a little more ginger if you like it a bit more spicy. I went ahead and added an additional 3 TBSP of flour and 1/4C of molasses for a more authentic gingerbread taste. It came out excellent.

Excellent. I wish I had seen the reviews about the lower oven temperature, but at 50 minutes, I did reduce the oven from 350 to 325. Glad I did since it appeared to be getting "too brown." Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Excellent recipe.  The only change I made is using applesauce instead of oil, just to cut down on the fat.  It made two nice big loaves but could also do three smaller ones.

I used about 26oz of canned pumpkin instead of 15 oz--it was really moist!  Next time, I will add more ginger in the recipe and maybe drizzle some gingery-something on top!

Very nice bread!!
I replaced the oil with Apple sauce -with that, I only used 1.5 cups of sugar rather than the 3 cups and it was still a subtle sweetness!
I will be making this every year!

Wow this bread is amazing! 24 muffins gone in about 8 hours. I've never had this much success with a new recipe. I baked the muffins at 375 for about 20 minutes. I only forgot to add 2 teaspoons of ginger and added one instead but though the ginger was less pronounced the bread was still good! :)

What a wonderful recipe!  I made muffins with it (24 per batch) Perfect crumb, aromatic, easy, and delicious!  I've made this recipe 4 times now in just the past few weeks, and it will be a permanent recipe for special mornings, gifts, etc.  Everyone loves it.  I did use real pumpkin from one we baked, (it yielded 8 cups by the way), so I'm not sure how using canned pumpkin would change the flavor, but I know it would be good.  The second time I made it, I doubled the spices as someone suggested, but then I decided I liked just that hint of ginger.  And I sprinkled walnuts on top because we are nut lovers and they look nice.

This one is a winner. I make this for Friends and Family, and it is one that is fought over.
I do make a changes though (who doesn't) I add one cup of real sour creme and 3/4 of a Tsp. of nutmeg. I also use 1-1/2 cups of brown sugar and 1-1/2 cups regular sugar.

This recipe is yum m m i e!!!  The bread comes out moist and the amount of spices were just right to give the flavor of fall. I did add a sprinkle of almond slices to the top to add texture and I dusted the lightly greased pans with cinnamon and sugar for added sweetness.

Very good.  Not too sweet and the spices are just right.  I followed the recipe exactly as it's written, but also added some flax seed and chia seeds to it.  I made muffins and baked them for 18 mins. at 350 degrees.  Came out perfect!

This came out SUPER GOOD. I made a couple changes though! I baked my loaves at 325 instead of 350 for 45m-1hr. My leftover batter was made into 4 little muffins baked at 20m. Also I just used 2 cups of sugar (half packed brown, half regular) then added about 1/2ish cup of regular sugar to taste. I added a lot more spices, about 1-2 tsp more of each (I like really spiced foods, especially with the cinnamon & ginger) and it balances out the sugar amount really well. I also used 2/3 oil and 1/3 apple sauce to cut down on oil. And for flour I used 2.6ish cups of gluten free flour & a little less than 1 cup of coconut flour. I let them sit out for 10 or so minutes before baking and they have a nice soft crust on them. They didn't rise as much as I'd hope but that's probably because of the coconut flour. They're VERY moist and get better after a day or so. Reminds me of the pumpkin bread at Starbucks without the streusel topping (If you add that, you'll never need to make Starbucks trips again)

Excellent flavor compared to most pumpkin breads which are usually sweet and kinda bland. I didn't make any changes to the recipe and will definitely make it again.

This turned out great! I made the following changes:

Instead of the 3 cups of white sugar, I added:
1 c. white sugar
1 c. brown sugar
1 c. molasses.

I had only 1 egg, so I made a chia egg using 1 tablespoon chia seeds and 3 tablespoons water whisked together, and then let stand for 5-10 minutes. Since the recipe has pureed pumpkin (pureed fruit can be used as an egg substitute), I didn't feel the need to replace all 4 eggs, and it turned out great with my changes.

I made this lower calorie by replacing all the oil with applesauce and used 1 cup of granulated Splenda with 2 cups regular sugar.  I also used fresh pumpkin puree and omitted the water in the recipe. Turned out great!

Wonderful. Perfect blend of flavor. Slightly crusty on the top, soft and moist on the inside. Easy to make. I will be making this again, closer to the holidays! May even bake some as gifts!

Made as directed with a minor exception… lowered the baking temp to 325 as others suggested… and I made them as muffins (regular and mini).  This made plenty of muffins to freeze -- 2 dozen regular and 4 dozen mini!

They are moist and pretty yummy, but as some others have said I personally think they need a little more spice.  I will also try adding nuts to them next time.  But will definitely make them again.

This is the BEST pumpkin bread recipe out there. I've been making this for years and it is consistently fabulous. I don't change anything (except sometimes I make muffins or mini loaves out of it). Truly, look no further.

I prepared the recipe exactly as it was written.   It was a tad dry on the ends, but the middle of the bread was moist and delicious.  Perfect amount of spices.   I think I will reduce the oven temp by 25 degrees and start toothpick testing at 10 minutes before timer goes off next time.    I think I will add some largely chopped pecans next time.  Perfect holiday gift for friends.

Truly exceptional quick bread. Wonderful texture.  Maybe it should be called Ginger Pumpkin Bread instead of Pumpkin Gingerbread as it is not as spicy as a gingerbread. Doesn't matter to me - it may not have been what I was expecting but it was great.  Easy, moist and flavorful.  This will go into my file.   Thanks!

I added raisins and pecans to this recipe and it is very tasty . It will be added to my 'go to' recipes for breakfast breads. The pumpkin base is a nice change but the title of gingerbread is sort of a misnomer. The recipe is really pumpkin bread with ginger, but that is apparent when one reads the ingredient list. Loved it!

Amazing!  Didn't have bread pans, so I made them as muffins and baked them for about 35-40 min.  Also, I only had brown sugar but it didn't seem to make a difference.  Will DEFINITELY make these again...so yummy!  Thanks Frosty!!!

I made this today and it was delicious! I made one change...I substituted the water for apple cider. It gave the bread a nice rich flavor. Excellent recipe....I'll defiantly be making this again!

I baked it following some reviewers advice: using 325F for 1h and increasing the spices 50%. I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups and substituted half the oil with apple sauce. Fantastic. Next time I will add 100% more spices over what the recipe says.

The best pumpkin bread I have ever made and tasted!  The only change I made was adding an extra teaspoon of allspice since I did not have cloves.  Will make it the same exact way next time!   Thanks for the great recipe.

I actually made a gluten free version, I used rice flour, coconut oil and 1 cup of coconut sugar and 1 cup of splenda, I also increased the amount of ginger cause I like it.
I used 6 mini tins and lined  them with parchment paper and baked at 325 for 45 minutes. we ate one  the rest I froze.
great recipe

Excellent flavor, wonderfully moist. I omitted cloves because of an allergy in our family and added a little more of the other spices. Doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves and 24 muffins. Cooked muffins for about 25-30 min.

Fantastic. However, I cut the sugar by HALF and it was still very sweet! I do this with many cakes and have never been disappointed. Followed to the letter otherwise, and used olive oil and about 1/2 spelt flour. The result was light and delicious and everyone loves it.

Just made it using Granny's suggested changes.  Her reduced temp and cooking times are spot on.  Doubled all of the spices and thought I was wrong doubling Allspice based on the taste of the batter but it turned out great.  Added walnuts I had on hand - a bit less than a cup.  I got one regular loaf and 3 mini loaves out of my mix.  The batter was very wet - would use some other contributors suggestions to cut sugar and oil to test that out but it was really very good.

I made some pumpkin ginger muffins for my boss a couple weeks ago and he loved them. I couldn't find the recipe again so I used this one. I modified it a bit for my needs, but I could tell it was a good base recipe. I took some hints and used more spices, but next time I am going to go a little heavier on the ginger. Also decreased the sugar to 2 cups as others suggested. It was PERFECT! Thank you so much for the share!!

A M A Z I N G !!! This recipe has just the right amount of spices to make it an irresistible dessert. Best if served warm with vanilla bean ice cream and/or cool whip. I baked mine in a 9X13 glass pyrex dish at 350 for 53m on the third rack (from the bottom), and it came out perfect. Thanks for sharing this wonderful holiday recipe!!!

Added pecans - and just made one loaf. Great flavor & moist! I was hesitant to let it bake a full hour - so I started monitoring at 45 min - but true enough it took just over an hour with me opening up and baking other cookies - for the toothpick to come out clean. DELISH!

So my baby was crying as I was adding the spices, so I ended up rushing and not following the recipe as closely as I otherwise would have. I Added two teaspoons of cinnamon, and I thought it called for pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice. Otherwise I followed this exactly and it smells as good as it tastes! I did have a longer cooking time since I baked both loaves at the same time.

This bread is yummy!  I did as others suggested and turned the oven down to 325.  I also cut the sugar down from 3 cups to 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce as well and doubled the ginger, allspice, and cinnamon.  I used 1 3/4 fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned.  Delicious!

Great recipe! Made whole house smell lovely. I made the following changes: used coconut oil in lieu of veggie oil; used 1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of 1 tsp each cinnamon, cloves, and all spice; used 2c wheat flour and 1 1/2c white all purpose; divided sugar into 1c coconut palm sugar, 1c brown sugar, 1c raw sugar. Used pumpkin seed, b sugar, and butter as a crumble on top. Recipe made 3 dozen small muffins.

Yum!  Moist, spicy, easy to prepare.  Works beautifully in a bundt pan.  I substituted coconut oil, and cut back the sugar to 2 cups per others' suggestions.  I used half coconut sugar as well, which seemed to add a depth to the gingerbread.  Next time I may cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, cause it's still plenty sweet.  Oh, and I did bake at 325 for 1 1/2 hours.  Great recipe!

Substituted apple sauce for oil, only used 1 cup of brown sugar, used 1.5 cups of ground oatmeal, 1 cup of almond flour and 1 cup of all-purpose flour rather than 3.5 of all-purpose. Cooked batter in muffin tins and they turned out great! Cooked muffins for about 25 minutes, but be careful not to overcook or they will be fairly dry. Yummy recipe!

This bread is delish!  I cut the recipe to 1 loaf but still used the whole can of pumpkin. I added slightly more cinnamon and ginger than called for based on my tastes and other reviews. It was so moist - loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I really liked the ginger addition to this bread. I had some leftover frosting from Paul's Pumpkin Bars and tried it with a slice of bread. Also tried with some butter. Whether plain, frosted, or with butter, the bread alone was great!

Delicious!  WOW, my entire family loved this recipe.  The only change I did was lower the oven temp to 325 and up the baking time to 1 hour 15 min.  The bread came out perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing!

What a yummy recipe!  My son and I made this together.  He normally doesn't like anything pumpkin, yet loved this bread!  We even freshly ground some cinnamon, allspice, and cloves.  We also cut back on the sugar to 1 cup sugar and 1 1/2 cups Splenda and couldn't tell the difference.

Wonderful recipe. Thanx. Followed exactly by the recipe... the only thing I did differently was switch the oil for applesauce and reduced the sugar to 2 cups and used Substitued sugar. Very heavy and moist loaves.. my hubby says it tastes like pumpkin pie?? LOL... Enjoy !

More like 10 stars! This bread is so delicious - perfect flavor and aroma and so moist...and did I mention delicious? I followed the recipe pretty closely but did adapt slightly based on other reviews and personal preferences. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, and instead of oil I used 3/4 softened butter and 1/4 plain yogurt. I used the spices as called for and then threw in a couple dashes of pumpkin spice blend for good measure. I used mini loaf pans so after a few minutes at 350° I dropped the oven temperature to 325° and mine were perfect at 40 minutes. I cooled the loaves in the pans for close to 10 minutes then transferred to a cooling rack, poked a few holes in the top with a toothpick and glazed them with cream cheese frosting that I had warmed to a pourable glaze consistency. Absolutely divine - my husband and toddler son couldn't get enough!

And one more thing - I agree with another reviewer who said this reminds them of the Starbucks Pumpkin Bread. It's definitely at least as good, if perhaps a bit less dense.

Halved the cloves. Cut down on the sugar. Added a tsp of dried orange rind and some chopped walnuts. Home-roasted pumpkin. VERY good.

This has become a family favorite for every holiday meal. I have made it as loaves, as mini loaves (Bake 22 min.; makes 16), as muffins (Bake 17 min.), and as mini-muffins (Bake 12-14 min.; makes 14 dozen). I usually bake one large loaf, and another smaller form to share. My great-nieces love the mini-muffins they can pop into their happy mouths!

Everyone who had a piece wanted the recipe. I changed it up a little: instead of 2/3 cup water, I substituted 1/3 cup water with bourbon! I may also add raisins the next time and soak them in an alcohol for that: "...hmmm, what is that delicious back flavor?"

I made this 3 days ago and it was a huge hit with my boys. We loved it. The texture was perfect, moist and oh so delicious. It was quite spicy, but it IS a gingerbread. It's already been requested that I make more. This one is a holiday keeper.

I make this using a gluten free mixture of almond meal(1/2 the amount) and brown rice flour(1/2 the amount). I also agree that it is way too sweet so i've lessened the sugar content down to 3/4 cup. It is absolutely delicious & my kids preschool class even loved it! making more right now. oh, we also use fresh ginger sometimes too.

Followed recipe but made muffin loaves instead of full size 9x5 loaf, made it easier for serving to crowd.  I added some white chocolate chips to some and butterscotch chips to others everyone really enjoyed and there was none for me to take home! Definitely a keeper.

Really great pumpkin bread!  I did follow the suggestions of some reviews and only added 2 cups of sugar rather than the full 3 cups.  But I have to say I wish I had used all 3 cups because it didn't turn out quite as sweet as I would have liked.  But other than that, I made this exactly as written and loved it!

This is really great.  Next time I would only make one loaf as it overflowed my food processor when mixing.  I also only had one cup of pumpkin so I substituted banana and it was marvelous. Great recipe. I might cut the sugar a bit but this is about it. Thanks for sharing.

I only gave this three stars as I feel like this recipe doesn't allow the bread much pumpkin flavor to come through.  My favorite things to bake are pumpkin, banana and apple breads and this recipe called for entirely too much sugar, and I can't say it enough little pumpkin flavor.  I have tried the Downeast Maine Pumpkin bread recipe and I prefer that much more.

I was able to make this gluten free by using a store bought GF flour mix. I also only put in 2C sugar. I baked it as directed and it was perhaps a few minutes too long. I would perhaps add a little bit more spice but that's just personal preference... my friends enjoyed it as is :) Will make again!

My neighbor gave me a loaf of excellent gingerbread and when I asked her for the recipe, she pointed me here. Such a tender loaf. I used to think gingerbread loaves were awful, but clearly I hadn't tried a good one until now.

Wow! Texture on this loaf is amazing! I cooked it at 325 for 1h and 15, I cut the sugar in half, and I also substituted gluten free flour for the regular flour and it turned out amazing.

This is really tasty and moist. I had to bake mine an extra 10 minutes but it was likely because I used fresh pumpkin puree as opposed to canned. Next time I do that I may omit the water and see what happens. Solid recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

Love pumpkin and ginger so the combination is great but away too much sugar for us and even cut it in half.   This is because we do not like anything too sweet and also cutting back on sugar for health reasons.   You could  substitute some Splenda for the same reason.

I have made this recipe for years in mini loaf pans as Holiday gifts. The only changes I make is adding 1/2 c. molasses and decreasing sugar by 1/2 c. I wanted a little more gingerbread flavor, not just pumpkin, and took some previous reviewers suggestions. Breads always come out moist!

I love this recipe. I make several loafs and hand them out. They claim theirs is never as good. I do add half brown sugar instead of the full white sugar amount and bake at 325 for high altitude. very moist.

I tried making this bread on a random autumn day a few years ago. Since then i have made this recipe for nearly every event in the fall for friends and family of all ages.  There are never leftovers!  Easy, delicious, and great for the season.

I took other reviewers advice and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Very good, got rave reviews from everyone who had it.  My father-in-law declared it was "absolutely fantastic" and that says alot coming from him and he doesn't like pumpkin, that's why i didn't tell him it was in there until he had some.  Thanks for the great recipe

Fantastic bread!  Was easy to make and tasted delicious.  Even better the next day when the spices made it more flavourful. We had it with just butter but it would be even better with a cream cheese spread or even icing...

I made this in the hopes that it would be more like a pumpkin bread than a gingerbread, and I was not disappointed.  This is very moist and dense, just as I always feel a pumpkin bread should be, and it has a great flavor.  I may have used slightly more pumpkin that needed (I only made one loaf, since I was low on sugar, and I eyeballed half the can of pumpkin), but either way, it tastes great, and has just the texture I was looking for. :)

I made mini loaves and larger loaves for gifts this year, and everyone who got it absolutely loved it.  This is a fabulous recipe, easy to make, and will definitely be a Christmas tradition for us from now on.  The only thing I changed was using 2 cups of sugar instead of 3.

I was expecting more of a gingerbread taste; I'll try again and double the ginger. Overall, it was moist and pretty good. I made an 8x4 and 4 minis. My mini loaves baked perfect, the full size loaf fell in the middle and burned around the edges at 50 minutes.

I always make pumpkin bread at the holidays but this recipe is more of a cross between gingerbread and pumpkin bread...and it's a great one!  It tastes very much like my favorite coffee shop's pumpkin bread.  It stays moist for a long time too.  I will be making this one from now on!

This is a family favorite. I have to bake it about 1 hr 15 minutes, but I think that has something to do with the climate/altitude here.  It comes out moist every time and never falls in the middle.  Perfect for Christmas gifts! Thanks for a great recipe.

This bread was VERY easy to make and DELICIOUS!  I made it for Thanksgiving.  Everyone in my family liked it and I have three kids ages 4,8, and 14.  My Grandmother even complemented me on how good it is and she is the baker in the family!  I plan on making it again for Christmas.

made this recipe as written, but it took more like an hour and a half and even then it was on the less done side.  I didn't want to over cook it.  The sides were done well, but the bottom was not. WIll make again, though!

A great pumpkin bread, but I wouldn't call it a ginger bread. Either add chocolate chips to make it a pumpkin chocolate bread or increase the ginger.

Excellent!  I've made this recipe twice, doubled both times.  I substitute applesauce for half the oil, and I also bake at 325 for 1 hour 15 minutes.    I forgot to add the water the first time I baked this bread--it was still quite delicious with no discernible dryness.  Friends will be getting this for holiday gifts, assuming we don't eat it all first.

I made this Pumpkin Gingerbread, and I thought it was great!  My husband, who usually does not like pumpkin, also liked it.  It was quite moist and not overwhelmingly pumpkin or ginger-y.

I love this recipe.  Of course, I have messed with it, and will continue to do so.  In general however it's good as it is.  If you are shooting for greater healthiness, replace the oil with applesauce, and use 20 drops of stevia extract to replace 1 c of sugar.  Still bakes up moist and dense, without the extra fat and sugar.  If you are a lover of spicy gingerbread increase the ginger to 1 1/2 T and cinnamon up to 1/4 c, add more nutmeg and clove, also a shot of coriander, a bit of mace.  As some other reviewers have suggested it can hardly be gingerbread without subbing in molasses for some of the sugar.  I've done so with good results, although as long as you use brown sugar the difference is negligible.  I plan to try it with a 2/3 c of Chai tea instead of the water this time. Baking time warning, using two loaf pans, it takes much longer to bake than the instruction suggest, almost an hour and a half.  Maybe this is just an indictment of my oven's calibration.

OMG!!!  I was looking for a good pumpkin bread recipe when I came across this.  I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and I added maybe a 1/4 cup of applesauce and it was so moist and yummmy.  This recipe though made so much - i got two loaves and 24 mini cupcakes.  I topped the mini cupcakes off with an icing, some confectionary sugar and water.  I would cut the recipie in half next time, but YOU HAVE TO TRY THESE!!!

It was okay.  I don't know what I expected - maybe for it to be sweeter or spicier??  It was so moist so props for that but I found it to be kind of eggy tasting.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did use the suggestion to lower the temperature and cook it a bit longer and my crust was not overdone.  I would not make this again.

This is hands down the most delicious pumpkin bread recipe that I've ever made and the only one that I will make from now on.  Super easy, wonderfully spicy and soooooo moist.  After reading some of the other reviews I took their advice to lower the heat to 325° and increased the baking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes and it came out absolutely perfect with no hard crust. This recipe makes 2 large loaf pans.  Give this recipe a try - it will be your favorite new recipe, too! TIP: wrap the loaves with stil slightly warm and seat the moist-ness in. I also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.

Fabulous!  Added 2/12 cups sugar instead of 3 and it was GONE!

The texture is great, but I felt like it needed more spice.  To make it more like gingerbread, I subbed the white sugar for a mix of brown sugar and molasses.

These just finished cooling and I had to sample, they are awesome. I did change it a bit since I didn't have any oil. Instead I added 1/2c melted butter and 1/2c crab apple sauce. I also cut the sugar down to 2c because my crabs and pumpkin are very sweet. Turned out perfect. Can't wait for hubby to get home and try some. :)

I agree with some other feedbacks: it is way too much sugar. Spices are not enough and you can not taste any ginger. Salt is not necessary at all. 

I added only 1 cup brown sugar, more spices, fresh ginger and fresh shredded pumpkin flesh. It turned great after the changes. 

Tip: for pumpkin flesh don`t use the pie pumpkin( flesh is too hard) but the big one that you want to carve. Remove flesh with a spoon and put into the dough. It has a juicy flesh and resolves when mixed with other ing. Way better as can :-)

This was fantastic, but I would say they turned out "unexpectedly fantastic." Let me explain. I opted to use 5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of adding the spices separately. However, in a moment of preggo-brain, I accidentally added "apple pie spice" instead. Good thing I tasted the batter before I stuck it in the oven because it tasted terrible! I then compensated by adding another 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp. cloves, and a pinch salt. I wasn't sure what to expect when I tried it out of the oven but it was amazing! My family loved it so much they begged me to make it again the same week and I ended up doing it exactly the same way (apple pie spice plus added ginger and cloves) on purpose this time. Great recipe that allows for some wiggle room and still turns out delicious!

I make this bread every year as soon as it's fall, and again at Thanksgiving. I always get the best compliments on it and many requests for the recipe. In my oven it only takes 55 minutes for two loaves and the top does get a little crusty. Once cool, I go ahead and slice it up and store it. It stays extremely moist. Very good heated up with a pat of butter!

I don't know where my review for this went, I made it the week after "lisa", on September 6th, because she made it sound so good. We liked this but it wasn't as gingery as I expected. I made this into muffins and now I have no idea how long I baked them for since the site ate my original review! They sure were good though. Thanks for sharing!

This one is excellent!  I made just one loaf and I did make a number of changes based on input from other reviewers.  I cut the sugar and for my “half” recipe used 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white.  I mixed the spices into the flour mixture, cutting back on the cloves as a personal preference, and cutting the salt to 1/2 t.  I was concerned because the batter was quite thin compared to other quick breads I have made, but it rose up beautifully. I decreased the oven temp to 325 degrees and baked for about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Thank you frosty!  This one’s a keeper!

SOOO moist. Everyone LOVED it. I didnt have all spice and it was fine without it. I added 1/4cup coconut oil in place of 1/4 cup of the veggie oil. I also ommited some of the sugar and it was JUST as good, im sure.

AWESOME!!!! Even better in the days after baking as the flavor continues to develop. Made some changes: subbed 4 oz applesauce for 1/2 cup oil; used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar; subbed fresh squeezed OJ for the water; used heaping measures for all spices because I like things spicy. Made 12 reg. size muffins, 12 mini muffins and one 8 x 8 cake. I frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting. Did not take as long as stated to bake so watch the oven. Very moist with super fantastic taste! YUMMMMMMM!!!!!!

I was shocked how easy this was to make and how tasty the bread was. My two loaves turned out perfectly, and were deliciously gingery without being too sweet. They got even better after being chilled for a few hours. Will definitely make again!

This was really good and moist and had a nice flavor--not overwhelmingly pumpkin or ginger, but a good mix of both.  I cut the sugar by 1/2 c and it was still plenty sweet.  I also substituted brown sugar for some of the white sugar.  I served it warm with whipped cream and it was delectable!

This is a wonderful recipe! I halved the recipe to make one loaf. I did keep the pumpkin amount the same and left out the water and cut the oil in half again. I also left the spices same amount because I like the hit of spice! But it is a keeper!

I prefer to double up on the spices for that extra autumn/pumpkin pie zing.

Perfect. I added pecans and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil. Moist and delicious. I followed the other reviews that recommended cooking at 325.

This was everything you want in a bread - sweet, moist, flavorful. Everybody liked this, but I think next time I'll add more ginger...I like it spicier. Thanks, Frosty for a great recipe. I will make this again and again!

Based on others reviews about being a little too sweet, I only used 2 cups of sugar.  The end result was PERFECT! I didn't miss the extra sugar.

I used whole wheat/white flour mix which obviously changes the texture, but I think it needs more ginger flavor - maybe double the ginger or add fresh ginger to the recipe...very moist and plenty sweet - could reduce the sugar by 1/2 c without missing it.

This is a great recipe. Everybody loves it and everyone who tastes it wants the recipe.  We ice it with a little cream cheese frosting and at Christmas or other holidays appropriate decorations could be used on the frosting. Thanks Frosty for sharing.

This recipe is a huge winner! True to form, I did mess with it a little and it came out moist and dense and delish. I sub'd the oil with homemade applesauce, sub'd the pumpkin with fresh steamed squash, and heaped the spices. So delicious!!!

I am a college student and my spice closet is pretty limited, so I just used extra ginger and cinnamon instead of cloves and nutmeg.  I also had to halve the recipe.  Turned out great.  Very strong ginger taste (predictably), extraordinary orange-brown color, and lovely moist texture.  Leaves a spicy-sweet taste in your mouth; impossible to stop eating it.

Hands down my favorite pumpkin bread/gingerbread recipe ever. It took longer than an hour, almost 15 minutes more. Check the bread in both pans with a toothpick to make sure it's ready!

This was the perfect pumpkin bread ever - and oh so moist! It has so much spice in it and is heavy and dessert-like without being too sweet! I will continue to make this every Thanksgiving, but the spiciness will be perfect to make for Christmas morning and Christmas dinners too! Five starts all the way!

Recipe was delicious.  Not as sugary as one would think with 3 cups of sugar. Enough batter to make two loaf pans... I added about 1/2 a cup of walnuts to one loaf by folding them in after the batter was mixed in.  I left one loaf without walnuts and it wasn't really a hit.  The pumpkin bread with the walnuts was much tastier than the one without.

I can't believe I haven't added my rating to this amazing bread recipe yet!  Can't EVER get enough of it and I've shared it with many friends.  Other than using 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil, I don't make any changes.  I bake it at 325 for 75 minutes too and it comes out beautifully every time.  Muffins or loaves and sometimes add raisins because I like raisins.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Fantastic!!! I made the 2 loaves, kept one at home and took the other to the Thanksgiving Dinner at the inlaws. The hostess (a VERY accomplished baker) was blown away by how moist this was and asked for the recipe! I decided to make the recipe as written except for doubling the spices (kept the cloves as written).  Next time I may try to substitute applesauce for some of the oil but the moistness is what really makes this bread stand out!

I followed this recipe exactly (which I almost never do) I will defiantly make this again. The loaf was nice and crunchy on the out side and extremely moist on the inside. The spices were perfect. I had to add an extra 10 mins for my oven.

OK, I was baking challenged today for some reason.  I almost forgot to put the pumpkin in and then forgot the water, but the loaves were already in the oven so I just went with it.  Not sure what the water does, but even without this bread is delicious.  I actually like it BETTER then the down east maine pumpkin bread from this site.  Spice is right on and it is moist.  I took a loaf and froze it for later and we'll work on the other one for now.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe exactly the same but followed someone else's advice and doubled the cinnamon.  It was sooo moist!  I also made this in a bundt pan, which I prefer over loaves.  I had to add 10 mins, but COVERED the pan for the last 10 as well.

There's a reason this recipe is 5 star. It's amazing! I had to add about 20 minutes to the baking time for it to finish, but that's the only thing that was different than the original recipe. My house smells so good right now!

This recipe is phenominal! My family loves it warm right out of the oven or warmed up in the microwave. It didn't last the day at home. My office coworkers said it's the best they have every tasted and enjoyed every last bite. I made 6 small loaves and one regular size.

I made this bread in a 9x13 pan instead of the loaves and it turned out great.  My husband was so impressed that he wants me to make another one, and said it was the best cake I have ever made.  I used fresh pumpkin puree and doubled the spices.  I iced it with cream cheese frosting.  It was a hit at our house :)  Highly recommended!!

Excellent! Only change was to use egg whites (3/4 cup of the kind that come sin the carton) and made 5 mini-loaves and one 7" x 3" loaf.  Smells and tastes delicious!

I made this recipe for a meeting I had at my home and for my co workers.  I can't tell you how many compliments I received.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was put large granulated sugar on the top. Absolutely delicious!

This was absolutely delicious!  Gave a loaf to the neighbors, who love pumpkin, they ate 1/2 loaf that night.  I did make some changes to this receipe as others had suggested.  I only used 2 3/4 cup sugar, skipped the ginger (as it is not a taste I like), increased all remaining spices to 1 1/4 teasp and baked at 325 degrees for 1 hour & 15 minutes.  It came out perfect -- no hard crusting and so moist.

This is delicious. I give loaves as gifts all the time - and get many compliments and requests for recipe. Stays moist for days. I do double the spice amounts as that's just my taste preference. Gingerbread should be kinda spicy!!

I made a few changes and the muffins turned out great. I used 1 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1&1/2 cups white flour.

This is a great recipe. I did make a few modifications; I baked the recipe at the proposed temperature for 15 minutes and then decreased the heat abt 25 degrees for the remainder of the time while adding 20 minutes to the cook time. I used less flour and sugar, more cinnamon. I kept running into this problem where the middle of the loaf was really thick n heavy so I had to make those adjustments but the flavor is awesome. My uncle actually called and gave very high remarks; I sent some to him and my aunt and they absolutely love it. So, I have to go bake more now, lol. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

It turned out just how I hoped, and my house smelled heavenly while it was baking.  It took me about an hour and 15 minutes to bake it completely.  I cut the recipe in half for just one loaf, and I used applesauce instead of oil and nutmeg instead of cloves.  We all enjoyed it and I think it won't be long before I make that second loaf, after all.  Thanks for a new fall favorite!

This was amazing.  My step-daughter, daughter and I peeled 2 fresh pie pumpkins (yields just under 2 cups when put through a cheese cloth) and kept the rest the same except insead of allspice we used MACE and wow.  This was absolutely amazing.  Thanks so much.

this is very close to a recipe I had/liked/lost. I do remember the one I lost had a box of instant vanilla pudding mix and only cinnamon as a spice. So....to get this closer the The Lost One I cut the cloves/allspice in half and doubled the cinnamon. I didn't want the delicate pumpkin flavor overpowered by the strong allspice/clove flavors. Mine was not done in the middle in an hour/did need longer to bake (took closer to 1 1/2 hours to bake through) but that may be from my adding the pudding mix to it. Overalll.....came out darn close to what I was looking for!!

This was fabulous! Wonderful pumpkin/gingerbread hybrid! We all enjoyed it. I replaced the oil with unsweetened organic applesauce and it was just great - super moist. I'll be making it again.

I have finally found my perfect pumpkin bread recipe-- no need to look any further. It was fabulous. I did make minor changes, though: I added a teaspoon of nutmeg, and because I don't eat dairy, I used egg replacer to match 4 eggs (the egg replacer also has a lot less calories). Next time I will replace half the oil with applesauce-- I've had success with that with other types of recipes. But this recipe was so good, I now feel free to stop researching this bread and look for other vegetable/fruit breads to play with! Thanks so much!

I have been making this recipe each Thanksgiving for the past 4 or 5 years, and it is still a huge hit.  I've experimented with using 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose white flour, which gives it a heartier taste and sticks with you longer.  I also usually decrease the amount of oil to 3/4 cup and use both brown and white sugar.  It usally only takes about 30 minutes to cook at this temperature in my oven.  Thanks for the great recipe!

i thought it would be more gingerbread like but to me it was just a pumpkin bread.  i left out a cup of sugar and it was just sweet enough.  the two year olds each had two muffins and the rest of the kids all had one too.  my mom and i thought it could use some more spices but my step dad and sister thought it was just right, so next time i will make it two ways.  i used all whole wheat flour and i don't think anyone in my family noticed.

I halved this recipe, substituting molasses for half of the sugar (for more of the true gingerbread taste), using some whole wheat flour, and using fresh pumpkin puree that I had on hand. This was so good! The loaf turned out dark, rich, and very moist. Great for breakfast with some eggs and coffee!

Very dry and bland but edible. If I made this again, I would double the spices and use crisco shortening instead of vegetable oil. If this had been for a party I would have saved it with cream cheese frosting.

A very good pumpkin bread recipe. Made exactly as described, turned out perfect. I frosted with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe also found on this site. My husband who isn't a big fan of pumpkin enjoyed this as a dessert.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using only 2 cups of sugar, and cooking at 325 for a bit longer.  Very tasty gingerbread; definitely the best I've ever eaten.  It is very flavorful and moist.  Thanks!

This was excellent!  I decided to make them in muffin form to take to choir practice.  1/2 of this recipe yielded 21 medium sized muffins, and I reduced the cooking time to 13 minutes.  I added cinnamon cream cheese frosting which made this more like a dessert... yum!

Made this for Thanksgiving morning and it was a HUGE hit. Don't change a thing. You can cut through it like butter!!! It has been demanded for all Thanksgivings to come. My family has called requesting I make it on a weekly basis. Thanks frosty for making me look so good on my first baking attempt!

This is the best pumpkin bread ever. I usually have trouble with batter breads being burnt/too dry. Since I bake in a dark pyrex pan, I lowered the temp to 325 and baked for about 80 minutes. Came out moist and delicious.

Very moist. Like others, I subbed applesauce for all of the oil. Double spices, but kept allspice as written - too overpowering doubled. Made in a bundt pan. Needed to bake a bit longer at 325 degrees. Frosted with cream cheese frosting. Made day before and wrapped tightly in aluminum foil prior to frosting day of. Delicious! Will make again and again.

I made this as is, its an alright loaf. It was very, very moist loaf. If I were to make it again I'd up the spices and lower the water. Also there was too much batter for my 2 silicone loaf pans.

Delicious.  I substituted 3/4 cup of pumpkin butter I happened to have for 3/4 cup of the oil and added more spices, threw in a bit of nutmeg, a tiny shake of black pepper and a pint or two of cardamon.  My boyfriend doesn't like pumpkin but liked this saying it's more of a spice bread.

Turned out beautifully.  I couldn't find ground cloves or ginger in my supermarket here in Japan, but I substituted a bit of ginger paste and it was fine.  I made it using a Japanese kabocha pumpkin, making the puree fresh, and it had a very delicate pumpkin flavour.  I also used light brown sugar instead of white, and I cut down the oil by 1/4 cup and added a bit more pumpkin puree.  I loved it!  Will definitely make it again.

I had no white sugar so I opted for brown and used two cups instead. It wasn't sweet enough to me. So I decided to add some cream cheese frosting and whola!!! sealed the deal.

This recipe is perfect- I didnt have allspice, so I added more cinnamon. I also used 3/4 c. applesauce + 1/4 c. oil instead of 1 cup of oil. These came out super moist. I also made them into muffins instead of bread- just cook for less time- about 15-20 min.

This is absolute BEST recipe I have ever used for bread.  Unbelieveable texture, moisture, and flavors! I added Raisins & Topped with a basic Icing and everyone, including my 1 year old LOVES it....I will make this for years to come, thank you SO much:)

This bread was ok.  I cooked it at 325 as suggested by another user, but my two loaves cooked for at least 1 1/2 hours.  You need to like clove for this. Otherwise, I wouldn't add it...as the allspice has it too, maybe use xtra cinnamon.  If I make this again, I will use applesauce in place of the oil.  I added a streusel topping and to me, this was the best part! Br. sugar, marg, flour and cinnamon...mixed together sprinkled on top.  Thanks for the recipe, I may try some other spice/pumpkin ones.

Easy to make and very delicious.  Simple and just what pumpkin bread ought to be.  I used 2 Cups sugar and Pumpkin Pie Seasoning instead of original ingredients.  I also used parchment paper in the bottom of the pan for quick and easy removal.  This will be a family recipe for many years.  Thanks for posting it.

I used my own pureed pumpkin and maybe it wasn't as dry as the canned one.  The batter was thin and it took 25 minutes extra to bake through. The sides were almost burned by the time the middle was done. I will certainly make this again, with less water, and in smaller pans at a lower temp as recommended by other viewers. The flavour is excellent as is.

Wow! What a delicious bread!! So moist and spicy -excellent! The 3 cups of sugar and full cup of oil was too much for me, so I tried one and one-half cup of sugar plus a half cup of honey. I also reduced the oil to a half cup and added a half cup of applesauce. Turned out GREAT!!  And I felt better feeding it to my family with less sugar/fat. :)

LOVE IT!!!! My grandma gave me this recipe 10+ years ago and it's great!  The only thing I change is I use 1 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup veg. oil.  The recipe is perfect the way it is!!!

Yummy!  I cut the sugar down to a little over a cup and only used 3 eggs, and it was plenty sweet for us!  I also did 3/4 c. applesauce and only 1/4 c. oil.  Used some whole wheat and some white flour to try and keep it a little healthier.  I didn't have allspice so threw in some pumpkin pie spice instead -- the only thing I would change is to maybe increase the ginger next time as I couldn't taste much of the gingerbread, just the pumpkin.  But my ginger is getting old so that might have a lot to do with it!  I cooked this in a 9x13 for somewhere in between 50 min. and an hour (I forgot to set the timer but that's my best guess).  It was moist and delicious!

Very good bread...I took others' advice to cook at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I made two loaves and two tiny bundt cakes.  I put a sugar/cinnamon sprinkle topping on one of the loaves and on both loaves.  Good stuff!

This is ever so moist and delicious! Instead of a full cup of veg oil, I used only 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup apple sauce. I didn't have any allspice. Baked for 1hr and 20mins at 325 degrees. I froze one of the loaves and I think I'm going to top it with a cream cheese frosting and sprinkle with walnuts. It would even be great with just a dollop of cool whip:D

This was a great pumpkin bread! Everyone loved it. I had some trouble with it sticking to the pan, but I probably just didn't grease it good enough. I also sprinkled some cinnamon/sugar on the top of both loaves, which tasted good. I will definitely make it again.

Honestly the best pumpkin bread recipe I've ever tried. The only thing I changed was that I used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice (didn't have it on hand). Absolutely fantastic. Crisp on the outside, soft and moist in the middle. Definitely a keeper.

This is a wonderful recipe. Makes really moist bread. I substituted the vegetable oil with one cup of cinnamon applesauce instead and it was fabulous.  Makes 2 loaves with one batter. Was a hit with my families!

UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!  I used half the oil, and used pumpkin butter for the other half, and used the Splenda Blend 50% sugar in place of all the sugar, and NO ONE knew!  It was wonderful.  I used chopped pecans in mine.  I've already made this recipe 2 times for Thanksgiving, and will be making more for Christmas gifts this year.  Good stuff!!

This is a great recipe!  Some other reviewers had stated that this was more pumpkin than gingerbread.  I added 3 tbl of dark molasses and some pumpkin pie spice, and that evened it out nicely.  The oil helps to create a pleasant "crust" on the top.  I put a mixture of cinnamon, sugar and pumpkin pie spice on the bottom which turned out well.  I did a loaf pan and 12 muffins.  In hindsight, I could have made mini muffins or six more normal sized muffins, because that was a huge loaf!  It also took an hour and twenty minutes on 350 and was on the verge of burning.

This was great.  I added extra spices as per some reviews.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan--it took about an hour.  I iced it with cream cheese frosting.  I sprinkled my greased pan with cinnamon sugar before baking.  It was sooo good.  Thanks!

I made this for my family to nibble on for breakfast on Thanksgiving day, and they all loved it! I substituted the canned pumpkin puree with 15 oz. fresh pumpkin that I steamed and pureed in a food processor, and used apple sauce instead of oil. I'll defintely be using this recipe again at Christmas!

This is excellent & makes a ton of batter (great for gifts). I baked at 325 degrees;  substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for white; used applesauce instead of water; added 2 TB molasses, added pecans to some loaves. Wonderful!

This bread is DELICIOUS!  I used egg-replacer instead of eggs to make the bread vegan, and fresh ginger because I didn't have ground.  It is so flavorful, I'll definitely make it again!

This is really good! I made 5 mini loaves but probably could have made 6. 40-45 minutes at 350. I was heavy handed with the spices and also added ground cloves by mistake, but it was really good. So easy to make!

My first time making pumpkin bread, and it certainly won't be my last!  We just loved this bread.  I made it as is (two loaves, 400 degrees, one hour) except I did not have any all spice, so I added freshly ground nutmeg.  I also increased the amount of cinnamon and cloves because I prefer my pumpkin pie to be a little extra spicy, and I thought I would feel the same way about my pumpkin bread.  The bread is moist and perfectly cooked, and tastes great just out of the oven!  Although I'm sure it would taste great at room temperature, as well.  Not to mention the house smells so good now! :)

This recipe is awesome! The bread was nice and moist, not dry at all and absolutely delicious! I baked a loaf for our Church Sunday Potluck and everyone loved it, I had none left over and several asked for the recipe! Five Stars from my family, we loved it.

Wonderful flavor, but it was waaaaaay too much batter for even extra-large bread pans. I will do this again for sure, but will use cake pans so that it will cook though. I baked my loafs for 1 1/2 hours but they never cooked in the middle so I gave up and we just ate the edges and threw away the middle.

I have made this recipe into mini loaves and regular sized loaves and every time it comes out beautifully.  I always have to take the recipe with me b/c people always ask for it after they try it.  We like it without any glaze and put cream cheese on it when we eat it.  It is my families favorite treat.

Last baking I did at Christmas and it was the best.  Followed recipe but added dried cranberries, rasins and nuts, (all leftovers from previous baking)about 1/2 to 1 cup each.  Came out great!! Very moist. Everyone loved it.

Mmm! This is so good! The only changes I made were using 2 cups of whole wheat flour, decreasing sugar to 2 1/4 cups, omitting the allspice, and adding 1/2 teaspoon EXTRA of each of the other spices. I might add more spices next time, even. It took about 70 minutes to bake.

Nice blend of spices in this bread. I thought it had a nice subtle taste of both the pumlin and the gingerbread; neither was overwhelming. Very moist and tasted great with cream cheese frosting. I'll be making this agian for sure.

Delicious! My oven is on the fritz, so any baking I do has to be mini sized and in my 6 qrt. roaster oven. So first I halved the recipe; then, I divided the recipie between 3 mini loaf pans and baked them. I also topped with Cream Cheese Frosting II. The entire family loved it.

I love this recipe! I made it last year and it was a hit. Last year I used the mini loaf pans and gave them out as gifts. This year I used a mini muffin pan(and baked them for 15 minutes)and gave them as gifts again. I love that this recipe makes so much and stays so moist. Like others I substitute applesauce for the oil and I usually double up on the spices.

This is delicious.  All my friends loved it.  It tastes just like pimpkin pie!  The mix is quite liquidy when you've added everything, and it makes a lot - I poured it into three of the 8" round cake tins.  This recipe is staying on my list of things to make because I KNOW it is good.

This was awsome.  Everyone loved it.  But everyone agreed with me the name is a little deceiving.  It is much more a pumpkin bread then a gingerbread.  Will be throwing away my old pumpkin bread recipe and using this one from now on.

I agree with the other reviewers.  The texture was perfect.  I ran out of allspice so substituted pumpkin pie spice for some of the spices.  I also added molasses which may have contributed to my only complaint. It was a little too sweet, but perhaps the molasses (about 3 tablespoons) was the culprit. I did like the extra molasses taste so next time I would probably just cut back on the sugar.

Perfect!!  I was so pleased when I opened the oven and saw how beautifully the loaves had risen.  And the aroma that filled the house was just what I needed to get me into the holiday spirit.  The bread had the perfect proportion of spices - moist and delicious!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I will most definitely be making this again and again!

Love this bread! It was just what I was in the mood for. It does have a nice slightly crispy crust and is very moist and soft. Is a nice blend of pumpkin bread and gingerbread. Perfect recipe for fall! I think it is sweet enough on it's own it that with icing it would be too sweet for me, but I did try a little powdered sugar sprinkled on it and that was good.

This recipe was great! Easy to follow and delicious. I made a great yet simple cream cheese icing for it that made it a hit with my family! 1 part Cream Cheese, 1 Part Cool Whip, 1 cup of white sugar whipped together and sprinkle some crushed walnut on top and wah laa!! Delicioso! Bon Appetit! Oh I also made it in a bundt pan and it took about an hour and 25 minutes..Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I used pumpkin pie spice and used about 5 tsp and then added 1 tsp cloves and another tsp of ginger.  Because I was making it with Splenda, the bread was done in about an hour at 325.  I drizzled melted cream cheese frosting on it.  It was delicious the next day, warmed slightly in the microwave.

This is a great recipe!  My whole family loves this.  I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned and it turned out wonderfully.  The recipe is perfect for 2 small loaf pans.  I was first skeptical about making pumpkin bread, but this tastes a lot like a pumpkin roll without the cream cheese filling.  It remained moist for as long as it was around...which wasn't long! :)  I am definately passing this recipe along to anyone who asks!!

I made this yesterday and was extremely happy with the results.  I used only 2 cups of white sugar and omitted a tsp of ginger.  This is basically the same recipe as the Maine Pumpkin Bread except for the additional spices.... I like this one better!!!

This was good.  I omited the water as I used homemade pumpkin puree.  I noticed the directions said to add dry ingredients to wet ingredients.  It took a bit longer to try to smooth the lumps of flour into the batter. I think next time I might try wet into dry.

Amazing!!!! Makes a melt in your mouth bread and if your feeling frisky...whip up a batch of cream cheese frosting and it is a wonderfully moist cake that keeps for at least 3 days...(it never lasts that long in my house)

This was really good!  I wanted a spicy birthday cake so I made it in a 9x13" pan and baked it for about 55 minutes at 325 degrees.  I topped it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II that is also on this site and it was delicious!  I think it would probably be even better made with applesauce or maybe some cider so I will try that next time.

I was looking for a nice orange bread (like the picture).  When I tried this one, it was pretty dark and the spices were strong.  I finally settled on a recipe I found in a Southern Living magazine...no allspice or cloves.

Extremely moist and tastey. I didn't have ginger so I used pumpkin pie spice and it was wonderful. I can see how this pumpkin bread would make a great present during Christmas time!

Per others suggestions increased spices and used applesauce and wheat four.  I also added mini chocolate chips to one of the loafs.  Needed a little longer to bake but excellent texture and taste.

I was making this to give to coworkers for Christmas gifts so I baked it in mini loaf pans. It made 8 mini loaves but I had to cut the baking time down to about 45 min. And I was out of allspice and ginger so I just added a little extra cinnamon and cloves. Everyone that tried this bread loved it and most people asked me for the recipe. I will definatly make this again.

This is an awesome recipe! I was out of allspice so I used nutmeg and I used whole wheat flour instead of white and these still came out great. I also made 1 dozen muffins and 1 loaf instead of 2 loaves. The muffins were light and moist and so was the bread. Of course, the muffins came out of the oven first. All around, great recipe. Thanks!

I made this recipe for Christmas Dinner.  This was very moist and flavorful....I baked half the batter in a loaf pan and the other half in mini-muffin pans.  The adults loved the loaf and the mini muffins were perfect for kids.  I will make this again and again!

This was really good and moist. My husband loved it. The only thing I changed was I had limited canola oil so I used 1/4 oil I had left and the rest apple sauce. Came out great and a lower fat version of the original!

This bread is delicious! It's moist and very tasty. For people who are not too crazy about baked goods that are too sweet this doesn't seem to be super sweet but to each his own. If the ginger taste is too potent I would just reduce 2 tsp. to one and a half teaspoons. Great bread!

Sooo yummy! I thought this was a perfect Christmas treat. I brought it to two Christmas parties with a jar of store bought cream cheese frsoting, and it was all eaten both times. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added some extra of all of the spices, and added some nutmeg.

Very good!  Rave reviews from firefighters I bake for!  Cut in half for 1 loaf with no problem, added nutmeg.  I agree - add more of each spice.  My cook time ended up being nearly an hour and a half.  Very moist, nice flavor.

I love this recipe.  I've made it lots for family and friends.  It's great to give as a gift and tastes delicious on it's own or with cream cheese icing.

Very good.  Nice and moist with good flavor.  I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the ginger (I'm not a fan).  Made 1 large and 8 mini loafs (baked for only 30 minutes).  All came out perfectly.

Simple to make.  Nice and tasty.  Tried it with walnuts, but raisins would be a nice addition.  Halved the recipe and it still came out great!

This recipe is great. I substituted applesauce for the oil and it still turns out great. It does take a while to cook, and comes out dark, but is well worth the time. I make it into 2 loaves and 6 muffins (30 m.).

GREAT recipe.  I did not change a thing with this recipe, except cook for about five minutes longer.  Wonderfully aromatic and simple, I baked it as an alternative to zucchini bread in late summer.  Will do so again many times around the holidays, thank you!
