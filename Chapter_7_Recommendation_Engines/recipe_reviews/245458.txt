Wonderful!  I did tweek it a bit...I added a tablespoon of Maker's Mark whiskey to the glaze mixture.  Also, once meat was removed from oven and resting, I poured residual juices/glaze and onions from foil packet into a small sauce pan, used kitchen shears to chop up onions in the pan, and brought to a boil on stove to reduce a bit.  Added another tsp of Maker's Mark and a tbs of butter to finish and used as an AWESOME sauce over the cooked/sliced pork.

Followed the recipe to a T. The tenderloin was very tender & juicy, but we found it a bit too mild in flavor for our tastes. It may just be personal preference, but we tend to like very bold spices with on pork.

While we liked the flavor, we weren't crazy about the texture of the tenderloin after cooking in a foil pouch for most of the cooking. We will make it again, but  just roast it in the over without the pouch

Kids loved the brown sugar-mustard coating. We didn't put it in the aluminum foil, but baked it in a pan instead.  If I did it that way again, I'd double the brown sugar-mustard mixture.

This is a great recipe for a company meal.  It is easy to prepare, tastes great and the sauce is to die for with the addition of the Grand Marnier.  Thank you for a recipe I will make again and again.

Super easy and delicious.  Baked covered in tinfoil but next time will maybe keep the foil off for the entire cooking time so the meat browns rather than steams.  Made a half recipe for one tenderloin.  Added a good splash of bourbon to the mustard mix. So yummy.

Super easy and delicious.  I used onion and garlic powder in addition to salt and pepper on  the meat.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of balsamic vinegar to the mustard and brown sugar mix.  Loved the no clean up!  Will make again.

This turned out great. I never used mustard and brown sugar together before and I was surprised how the two balanced each other. I added a tiny bit of honey to mine, but aside from that made it exactly as directed.

Simple and delicious. We used fresh sage as an herb in our mixture. Yum! We tried the same glaze with chicken and was also good. Better w pork though

This was a bit to bland for my tastes. Don't think I'll make this again. Not to say that it wasn't good. I just like to have more flavor to my pallet

I made this with bone-in pork "loin" chops,. b/c that is what I had on hand. I followed others' advice and added 1 tbsp whiskey to my glaze. I didn't have Members Mark, but I had Apple Cider flavored whiskey, so used that. I had "spicy brown" mustard in the fridge, so I used that...and I had dried crushed thyme, so I used 1 tsp of that instead of fresh thyme. I baked for about 30 minutes on 350 degrees, then opened it up, added the rest of the glaze and broiled about 2 minutes. Sooooo good!!! I will definitely make again!

I made this to put on top of the roast only. Then I covered it tightly with foil so it would seal and baste itself in the oven. All of the flavors infused into the ham. It was delicious and really easy. Didn't have the onions, so I skipped that part. But as a stand-alone marinade/rub, this is fantastic.

This was a hit at our house.  I thought the flavor was really good and the pork was moist.  Most importantly our kids asked for it to be made again!

We doubled the recipe.  It was good, but I think the next time I double it, I will wrap each tenderloin separately to help speed up the process.  We added markers mark to the sauce which was  a great touch.  Will be making this again.

Followed the recipe, except tenderloin was only 1 1/4 lbs in size.  A real keeper in flavour, and tenderloin was very moist.
