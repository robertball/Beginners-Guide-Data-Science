Oh my goodness were we pleasantly surprised and rewarded on this! It looked just beautiful on the red leaf lettuce and the taste matched its presentation.  The combination of creamy sour cream, buttery smooth avocado and smoky bacon was just out of this world. Whether eaten on its own as a salad, or served in tacos, you will not be disappointed. This will be my new guacamole, and because of this recipe we will be eating a lot more avocados. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

THIS IS THE BOMB.!! But...I didn't use it as an actual salad...lol  It is KILLER RICH.  I doubled this recipe - and only changed two things.  I used low fat sour cream and fresh lime juice instead of lemon.  As suggested by another cook I made up the lime/sour cream sauce earlier in the day so that the flavors could mingle and "get happy". About 30 min before serving it I cubed up the avocados and mixed them in.  HOWEVER.. I served this at my burrito bar dinner and it was inhaled!  What wasn't slathered into the pulled pork burritos was eaten as a heavenly chunky dip with chips.  Not one drop was left over... :)  Next time I'll try a little fresh Cilantro...then it will be 6 stars...

I'm originally from the Tampa Bay area and I grew up with avocado and key lime trees in my yard, so I grew up with fresh guacamole in the wintertime, or what passes for winter in Florida.  When it comes to regular guacamole, less ingredients are better, but the avocados must be very ripe or it will lack flavor and creamy consistency.  This salad is excellent but especially good if your avocados are a touch underripe for standard guacamole. I added a clove of garlic and substituted key lime juice for lemon.  Key lime is tarter than regular lime and gives it a unique flavor.  I would even suggest regular Persian lime instead of lemon in this recipe.  Overall, excellent as a dip or even condiment to tacos or fajitas.

SOOOO GOOD!!!!!!  Ingredients wise, I followed the recipe to the "T", except used iceburg lettuce because that is what we had in the house.  What a pretty presentation this salad makes & I think it would be even nicer with romaine.  I mixed all of the dressing ingredients together (minus the avocados) and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving.  Just before dinner I then chopped up the avocados and very gently folded them into the sour cream mixture.  My dad RAVED about this salad and said about 5 times how good it was; he never, ever does that!  Thanks TXG for such a simple & tasty recipe!!!  I plan on making this often.  :)

Awesome! I prepared this a day in advance and served with the crock pot carnitas recipe on this site. I tasted it when I first prepared it and it was good. The second day...it was delicious! The flavors really combined having sat overnight.

Wow, wow, wow!  I LOVED this!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used low fat sour cream(all I had) and threw in a little extra bacon(maybe half a piece).  I will make this over and over and over again!

This is a delicious way to use avocados as a side salad.  Very refreshing and yummy!  My brother doesn't even like avocados and he ate a huge helping!

This was a perfect addition to our meal. I served it with a spicy baked chicken and the two dishes really complimented eachother. I wasn't sure how this would taste but it has quickly become a favorite in our house! I also used fresh lime juice and the taste was amazing.Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious!  I tried the recipe with lemon and then with key lime, and the key lime was impressive!  The only other difference was I used about 1/2 the sour cream and thought it was better.  I served it over lettuce lightly tossed in olive oil.

I made a couple substitutions, but they worked just fine! This was delicious! Very surprising how tasty it was, for such a simple recipe! I used lime instead of lemon, and I used pancetta instead of bacon. I will definitely share this with others!

I made this as a side dish for Chicken Enchiladas. Delicious and refreshing, just as the recipe poster suggested! Will definitely make the rounds with other south of the border inspired dishes.

As suggested by another member, I used this as a condiment on the Slow Cooker Carnitas.  As a condiment, I reduced the avacados. It was delicious.

This salad is outstanding.  Even though my hubby doesn't like creamy salads and isn't wild about avocados (can you believe it?) he liked this.   I used regular sour cream, but next time I make this I will try the fat free.  I am a Lifetime Weight Watcher, so always whittling away those calories and fat wherever I can as long as it doesn't ruin the taste.

I ate this salad 2 days after I made it for dinner and it makes a good leftover lunch the next day.  Didn't lose it's color at all.  I look forward to serving this to guests in the future

This is a lovely base and we found it a little bland as written.  The second time we added another onion, a good handful of cilantro, a couple shakes of tabasco and used key lime instead of lemon juice.  We liked that better.  In subsequent attempts, I also added cumin to the 'sauce' and did let it sit for about an hour before adding to the salad.  This batch has been our favorite so far. Thanks for the idea - it's a great one!

Absolutely delicious!  It has become staple in our house. I usually cut back on lemon juice in recipes but DON'T in this one.  Once it's mixed, the lemon really marries all the flavors very well!  Best to serve about 30 min after prepared.  Love it!!

Excellent!  I would have given it 5 stars but I found it was a bit too heavy on the sour cream so it was too wet for me.  I'll definitely make it again though and this time will use 1/4 cup of sour cream instead of 1/2 - just a personal preference.  I did use low fat sour cream to cut back on the fat.  I'm also wondering if a pinch of taco seasoning might add a touch of Mexican flavour??

OMG! This is one of the best things ever made with bacon and avocados. I did change it slightly as I used lime juice instead of lemon as thats what I had on hand. I also mashed one of the avocados and left one diced to thicken it a bit. Once it was all mixed I folded in about 1/4 tsp of Aleppo pepper flakes and served like guacamole with carnitas.

This was lovely.  I didn't really measure, just estimated, and I added some cilantro, and it was perfect with my Mexican dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love it!!!  I saw this as a recommendation for a carnitas topper and it for sure would be amazing on its own.  My boyfriend hates avocado and he loved it too.

What a good, simple topper for so many dishes! We used this on top of fish tacos. Using this as a topping was about the only thing that saved that particular recipe...

I followed reviewers suggestions and mixed together all but the avocados ahead of time so that the flavors could come together and ‘get happy.’ I folded in the avocados when I was getting ready to serve and ended up adding more sour cream and lemon juice because it was just too thick. I guess my avocados were really big. Served over a bed of mixed greens, even my non-salad-liking dad enjoyed it.

Interesting salad, I like it. Definitely spreadable & creamy. It's a bit too creamy for me to just place on top of lettuce. It needs a rivaling texture; perhaps entertainment crackers or toasted bread?

Delicious!  Made as directed except I used 5 pieces of bacon.  Very very good!  I used it as a side to carnitas, but could see it as a dip for tortilla chips.

This is one of my family’s favorite recipes from this site. Like many others have suggested, goes wonderfully with Carnitas. Thanks so much.

If you're looking for an alternative to the normal guacamole then this is one to try. I stuck right with the recipe as I always do the first time so I can rate the true recipe.   I just ate as a salad by itself but could see how it really would be great on a taco or along with a mexican dish.  The reason for the 4 is just that I like it better without bacon, but it definitely worth a try.

This salad was great! I did add a little shredded chicken to the mixture to make it a little more filling since we were eating it as a main dish, but everything else I kept the same. I must have had large avocados because it was a lot thicker than what I was expecting, but still very good. I will have to make this again as a side dish to a taco night or something similar soon. I love the flavor of avocado and bacon together; there is just something magical about that combination!  My middle son, husband, and I all really liked it. Thank you for the recipe, TXGIRLSX3!

I used half the sour cream and used lite sour cream.  I also added a clove of garlic.  I seasoned with coarse salt and fresh ground pepper.  I served this to a crowd with carnitas and every bit was gone!
