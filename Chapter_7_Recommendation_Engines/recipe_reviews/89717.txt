This is my new favorite way to serve corn!! Instead of red onion I used a Vidalia, also I sauted the onion until it was soft and then added in the corn. Use fresh corn for sure, it's definetly worth the hassle to remove the kernels yourself!! The dish is slightly sweet but not over powering, good either warm or cold.

This is very, very good! The natural sweetness from the fresh corn and vidalia onion (personal pref) and light herb flavor from the fresh parsley and chives makes this a very refreshing summer side dish. Followed the recipe with the exception of cooking the onion for a few minutes before adding the corn and then proceeded as written. Perfect addition to our grilled pork chops tonight. Everyone here is looking forward to enjoying this again soon. Thanks for sharing!

This was good and two ears of corn was PLENTY for four of us.  Company was a little late so I kept it on the stove for a while so it wouldn't be cold...it made the onion more brownish than purple and too soft compared to the corn.  I agree, crunchier purple onions are perfect in this and the result is beautiful!  Next time I'll add the corn before adding the onion.

This was FANTASTIC! I made this exactly as written, except for subbing vidalia onion for the red because that's what I had on hand and using light butter~YUM. I will definately be making this often! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have made this several times and always forget to rate it.  This is a great way to jazz up corn.  I have used both fresh corn and canned corn and either way it's delicious.  I usually use a little less onion, because of my little guy, but I otherwise keep it exactly the same.  Thanks for the awesome recipe is that a definite keeper.

4.5 stars - I substituted a large shallot for the red onion. I also let the shallot cook for a while before adding the corn. I don't like raw onion. Very good recipe.

Since I'm on a low salt restricted diet I substituted salt for Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Six Spice.  Was delicious!!!

It was great.  Used frozen corn and added a little sugar.  My only complaint is that it was very small serving sizes.

AMAZING! However it was winter when I prepared this so fresh corn wasn't easily found. I used two cans of corn drained and rinsed! Corn has always been a blah side dish in my family now everyone loves it prepared in this way! Thank you for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, except I doubled it.  This was so much better than plain corn.  I don't make corn too often, and probably will only use this recipe once in a while, but it will definitely be a repeat.  I did notice that the recipe stated that it serves four and you are only supposed to use two ears of corn.  I'd use more than two ears if cooking for four, probably one ear per person with maybe an extra thrown in for good measure!  There was no way my doubled recipe would serve eight!  There were only two of us, but I used four ears because I wanted leftovers : )

This was OK, but not much better than just canned corn by itself.

Really enjoyed this warm salad.   I used a sweet onion and some dried herbs as they were all I had on hand and it turned out great with our grilled pork chops.
