I did not really know what to expect and decided to make these.  I must confess that since my three year old was going to eat some, I originally omitted the pepper flakes; that dulled the flavor.  Once I added some flakes to mine, I can say that the spiciness really helped.  I also dusted some of them with smoked paprika: wow!  I will definitely make these again since I pretty much ate half the batch by myself.

This recipe was excellent! I used 2 cups of cheerios instead of rice crispies, and 3/4 cup of olive oil in place of butter, and these were so fantastic, I loved them! Thank you :)

Just tried this recipe last night and am really pleased with the results.  I substituted cayenne pepper (1/4 teaspoon) for the red pepper flakes and added chopped fresh rosemary for a little extra taste.  They turned out to be very tasty.  I can't wait to try it with different cheeses (Swiss or Gruyere) and maybe other herbs.  Very versatile!  I've been disappointed with the results of similar recipes but this one is a real keeper!  Thanks for the recipe, Domestic Chef.

One of my favorites!  But the ball-rolling thing is too much trouble...roll into logs on wax paper, refrigerate overnight, slice in 1/4 in slices, and bake.  Lasts forever in the freezer and you can bake some up whenever you need to gain a few pounds.

YAY!!!  These taste just like Cheez-Its, only better and I can control what goes into them.  They are light and crispy and cheesy little crisps of awesomeness!  We all like them, even the dogs, which I found out when I accidentally slid some onto the floor.  I used a Sil-Pat to bake them on, and (as usual) it worked beautifully!  Thanks Domestic Chef- I will be making these on the regular  :)

So yummy!  I tried this recipe to replace a similar recipe that I used to make, but honestly these little cheese crackers are much better!  Instead of red pepper flakes, I used cayenne pepper (1/4 tsp. plus a couple of extra shakes) to get the flavor I was looking for.  I was surprised what a difference the rice krispies made -- they lighten up the crackers and give them a nice crunch while still letting the cheesy flavor come through.  Be sure to cool them on paper towels when they come out of the oven to absorb the excess fat.  This recipe also makes a lot which is good because once you taste them, you're going to want more!

Everyone loved this recipe. I used Imperial cold pack old cheese.  Comes in a red and black round cardbord box in dairy section. It has a very strong cheddar flavour. Better than regular old cheddar. Will mix easily by hand if room temperature.. Next time will make double recipe as I ate half before I could pack up for gifts. Taste great with wine !

I used 1 1/2 cup of flour so I could add 1/2 cup of other ingredients: sesame seeds as mentioned by the author, but also some corn meal, poppy seeds and sunflower seeds. I was really surprised at how the rice crispy cereal made each bite light and extra crispy. I normally never use so much cheese, but yum! A really nice experience to cracker crunching!

I made these crackers the first time a few months ago. We ate them up much too quickly for having only 2 people in the house! The crispy, cheesy flavor is so much better than any commercially made cheese crackers. I made no changes to the recipe. The dough didn't "roll" into balls, I had to compress balls by hand and I found it much easier to flatten them by hand rather than with a fork. We could taste the red pepper in them, but it's just a hint of heat. I'm putting a bit more pepper when I make them just for us as we like spicy foods. I've also made them twice for coffee hour at church and they were a big hit there, with people coming back for more.... and more.

I made this recipe for a crowd of people who all loved them. I used the other reviewers suggestions for substitute ingredients I didn't have to hand: oil instead of butter, 1/4 tsp Cayenne in place of Chilli flakes & crushed potato chips instead of Rice Cereal. I'd add more Chilli or Cayenne next time as I like more zing but will def add this to the snacks menu at ours.

Tasty.  I just made them, and am already imagining them alongside some cream of tomato soup or with an iced glass of tomato juice w/lemon, or maybe with some different dips.  They were done in my oven in 23 minutes.  I baked them on parchment paper, so I don't know how they'd come out on a plain cookie sheet, but with all the butter --- probably fine.  One possible tip:  Maybe it's our high altitude, but the cracker dough didn't "roll" into balls for me.  They needed to be compressed by hand and "formed" into balls.  I wondered if they would fall apart during the baking process, but they came out fine.  I'm thinking of trying some pepper-jack cheese in them next time.  Or some fresh chives.  How about oregano or basil ?  They're a fun, new treat, though.

I need to 1/2 this recipe so we won't eat so many.  We don't like a lot of heat so I only used a sprinkle of cayenne.  Really liked the rice krispies in them.  I think it would be good with corn flakes too if you didn't have any rice krispies in the house.  I flattened the balls of dough with the heel of my hand.

These are fantastic! Used very sharp cheddar and they were definitely not bland.  Followed your recipe except for using cayenne (1/4 tsp).  Next time may try topping with sesame seeds and a light dusting of paprika.  The heat wasn't overwhelming so everyone enjoyed them. I almost forgot the last pan and they were golden brown--a bit too done! 25-30 min. was perfect in my oven. My suggestion would be to watch carefully after 20 min. because once they begin to turn color they over cook very quickly.

I really liked these a lot.  Like another reviewer, I used Cheerios instead of the Rice Krispies as that is what I had on hand.  Very nice indeed!

I felt like this was too bland-it was like a very dry, flavorless cookie that was supposed to be savory. I prepared it as close to the recipe as I could. Perhaps I still messed something up.

I used a very good quality English cheddar and I think that is key for full flavor.  Really easy recipe and great for a party because you can make them in advance.

Love this one!  I had been searching for a gluten free cheese cracker recipe that my kids would eat.  

I tried the recipe with white flour so I would know what it's "supposed" to taste like.  Then I made it with brown rice flour and gluten free Rice Krispies.  Tasted the same, the kids love it.  We used extra sharp cheddar cheese from Tillamook, the kids won't eat it plain generally but it was great in the cracker.

Made these for my son to take to college with him this week.  The cooking time had to be adjusted...  I added 1 tsp ground red pepper instead of flakes... Cooked on 275 for 20 mins.  When I cooked first batch on 300 for 30 mins they burned up.  I guess  every oven is different.  Just monitor them when cooking... if the top starts to get brown you need to pull them out.

These needed to be rolled out-they came out with a crumbly cookie texture and extra baking would not crisp them up.  I suggest using a rolling pin and making these almost paper thin to get the right "cracker" consistency.

I just made these for a barbecue and although it's a bit time consuming (the 1/2 inch size yields a LOT of crackers and each tray takes 30 min to bake but...) it was well worth it.  They are cheesy and buttery and just a tad spicy (even the guests who shy away from spicy food enjoyed them).  And the leftovers (like I said, it made a lot) were great for the next week or so (in an airtight container).

I've used this recipe for years, only with 2 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Your temp and time are different so I'll try that to get them crisper next time.  I only fix these at Christmas as you can't eat just one!

I tried these because of the great reviews it received and I am not a fan.  They taste more like flour than anything else.  Very disappointed :-( I even tried sprinkling them with a little paprika like another review suggested.  I did enjoy the heat in them though...just the right amount.  If I were to make them again, I would use a little less flour!

They had great taste. I think I did something wrong because mine were too crumbly. Will absolutely make these again.

Slice n’ bake worked perfectly. I added bacon bits purchased and 10minutes before done, I flipped them.  Nice crispy cheese cookies. Love them for breakfast or parties. Dogs love them too! WOOF!

I find it odd that people who make the recipe yet DON'T by substituting all or most of the ingredients then say they made the recipe.

I adored these as written & various seasonings to my taste! Just a tip here: remember there are no raw eggs etc that might prevent you from tasting your dough to get a better idea of adjustments you may wats try. Recipes like this I put together but only place a few in the oven to not only give the recipe as written on honest try before I make my variations. From the 1 recipe I enjoyed several varieties of crackers that boxed in the store would cost a pretty penny!!

Love these! They never last long because everyone else does too. Quick and easy to mix, the hardest thing is taking the time to role and press each cracker.

I made this according to the directions, and they were very hard to form, very crumbly dough.  The taste was not as cheesy as I wanted.  Really disappointed in these.

These are really, really good.   Having the cheese at room temp is helpful for kneading it into a dough.    Use a flavorful cheese... I used sharp white cheddar once and a blend of gruyere and cheddar and swiss another time.   And I put cayenne pepper in as well to give them a bit more bite.  Quite delicious!

I did it exactly as instructed and it came out great. Did them on convection at 300 for about 20 minutes on parchment lined cookie sheets. These don't spread like cookies do, so you can put them pretty close together on the sheet (get more per load).

My mother made this in my childhood and I decided to make it this year when some friends and I were baking Christmas goodies.  They turned out just like I remember.  I use cayenne instead of red pepper flakes.
