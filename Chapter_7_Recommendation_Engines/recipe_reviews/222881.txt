I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka in this recipe. I felt like making this "fizzy" so I topped it off with club soda which cut the sweetness a bit. VERY good.

I used Pinnacle Whipped vodka and topped with whipped cream - delicious.  Sometimes I add shaved chocolate to the rim of the glass.  Delicious!

This drink was great. I quadrupled the recipe and didn't add the full amount of creme de cacao as I wanted more of a coffee/espresso taste.  I also used Starbucks double shot espresso with cream in place of the brewed espresso which comes in 4 pk cans. It was perfect and I won 2nd prize in a beach party contest!  It was tasty! I also added a few brewed coffee ice cubes to keep the drink cold

Wow! This recipe was absolutely perfect! I was worried it would be too boozy but it was very sweet and mocha-like in flavor. Bought kahlua especial on accident, thought it was a better option but really itâ€™s 70 proof, still worked great
