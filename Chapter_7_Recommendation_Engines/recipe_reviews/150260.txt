Made this for my boyfriend's birthday since he ALWAYS orders beef satay at thai restaurants, and he practically got down on the floor and kissed my feet. may i just remind you to SOAK THE SKEWERS, though!! this step CANNOT be skipped or even done halfway.. i forgot to until i was ready to broil everything, so even though i soaked for a minute, most of my skewers caught on fire. apparently the most delicious thing i've ever cooked, regardless of skewer fires, though!

To be fair, I have nothing to compare this too as I have never had Thai food. However, this was delicious! So easy to make and our 2-year old daughter loved it as well (she loves spicy food though) my husband loved it, will definitely be adding to the regular rotation due to the simplicity of it it makes a great weeknight dinner...served it over jasmine rice. Delicious!

This recipe is the bomb.com! I do recommend letting the meat marinade longer than 30 minutes but other than that I wouldn't change a thing. I grilled mine as the recipe submitter mentioned and my steak stayed super tender. This recipe is so simple  yet it blew my socks off! This would make an excellent marinade for venison, wild duck, or other wild game. This just may be the best recipe I've had this year so far! Thanks for sharing Aaron!
