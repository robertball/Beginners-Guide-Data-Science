I used Florida Seafood Seasonings Garlic Butter Crab and Shrimp Boil (Available on Amazon).  I triple the water to make sure it was not too spicy for my wife.  It did not need to be watered down that much.  Everything was incredible.

We are so happy with this recipe! It is flavorful, easy, and we can feed tons of people with it. We did add cauliflower, and the cauliflower was just as good, if not better, than the potatoes.
