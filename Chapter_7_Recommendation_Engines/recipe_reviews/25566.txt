At first I thought it was going to be a dud cake, as the batter tasted really weird. But I baked it anyway, and it was 5 stars! It was tested by 3 adults and 7 kids, all of them said "2 thumbs up!" and the 10 year old said "you should go make this cake at a cake making place and be the manager cause this cake is sooo good!". This is a great, chocolatly, thick and creamy cake! YUM

Don't let the mayonaise deter you.... this is the most delicious cake I have ever tasted.  I use sweetened chocolate instead of unsweetened but other than that, I change nothing.  The last time I made it, I topped it with "whipped cream cheese frosting" and it was talked about for days.  Thanks.

I made this cake for Mother's day for my mother-in-law. She and the rest of the family loved it. I have one piece left one day later. I topped it with a chocolate glaze. It was super easy to make, the batter was extremely runny, but baked perfectly. I used a bundt pan and cooked it about 50 minutes. This chocolate cake tasted and looked just like a chocolate cake. Very pleased with this recipe and have already recommended it to friends. Super easy to make and delicious too!!!  here it is over a year later and I am still making this cake, I just made it twice in the past week. I used the Hershey's recipe for their perfectly chocolate chocolate icing on top, my best friend told me it was divine! It never lasts in this house or when I take it somewhere. Its a keeper!

To those who say the cake is gummy with a weird texture , I have made it enough times to know it doesn't always turn out right. I have found that if I over mix the mayo chocolate mixture the cake doesn't rise right and is gummy. To avoid this use room temp mayo and mix chocolate, mayo, vinegar and extract til creamy. If it looks shiny and curdled the cake will be gummy. HTH :)

was looking forward to having a great chocolate cake.  Was easy to make.....
looked good when it came out of the oven (although I had to keep it in for an
extra 10 minutes) but ended up tasting gummy!  Not sure what I did wrong

This cake was the most moist cake I have ever made.  I made it in two 8 in pans and put a candy bar icing in the middle and chocolate glaze over the top... Amazing!

I made this cake for my Granddaughter's birthday.  It is easy to make with ingredients most have available.
It was fantastic for such different ingredients.

Definitely a keeper!!!  I just made this recipe and I fear I may have 1/2 the cake eaten by days end. :)

I never have bakers chocolate on hand, so I used 9 tablespoons of cocoa powder and 3 tablespoons (grape seed but any oil will work) oil instead (the recipe on the back of hershey's cocoa)

This is the perfect recipe, especially when you don't have any eggs in the fridge!!!

Couldn't stop eating this cake! It was amazing without any frosting and was sooo moist and dense. I actually suggest handmixing the chocolate and the flour mixtures and then using an electric mixer to incorporate the hot water because the consistancy won't be so fudgy, but either way the flavor was outstanding!

Hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever used.  I've found that it needs a good 10-15 minutes more of bake time than the recipe states and since my husband loves it extra chocolatey I use milk chocolate squares instead of the unsweetened ones and often double the amount of chocolate.    Absolutely amazing with a cream cheese frosting!

I made this twice - once following the recipe and once changing the recipe to make it healthier. The recipe itself is fantastic - rich and moist. To make it healthier, I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, Erythritol (a sugar alternative found in most health food stores under various brand names- no nasty aftertaste like Splenda) instead of sugar, and reduced fat olive oil mayo instead of the regular kind. The results were also fabulous. The texture was a bit coarser due to the whole grain, but it was still moist and chocolatey - and 200 calories a serving!

WOW!  I did have concern when the batter turned out so runny, but was more than surprised when this moist cake came out so perfectly.  You can tell Aunt Joyce that this is a wonderful cake!  Top with dark chocolate frosting, and you will be in heaven!

Overall Rating: (Taste, texture, consistency and appearance) = Poor    Fortunately, I had the time to try this recipe before serving it to anyone.  It takes twice as long as the submitter said to bake, it has unsavory gummy texture and taste and barely had any chocolate favour.

I didn't have unsweetened chocolate to melt, so I used the 3-1 ratio with cocoa powder and butter. Everything else I kept the same. I had to add another 1/2 c. of flour and another 1/4 c. of cocoa powder because the batter was SO wet. This recipe reminds me a lot of the chocolate cake recipe on the Best Foods mayo jar.

This did turn out really moist and chocolate-y, even more so with the Mocha Frosting I used from this site to frost it with. 

Not too hard to make and took just a little more time as it would have making a boxed cake but with a less processed flavor. I doubt I'd make it again, only
because it's so similar to the Best Foods
mayo cake. I'd like to try something different, a little more unusual.

EDITED TO ADD: So, with the extra addition of more cocoa powder, the chocolate flavor of this cake was phenom. With the mocha icing on top, this cake was my best PMS chocolate craving killer EVER. I ate two pieces and was in chocolate/coffee heaven.

This is a very good cake. I used the cocoa conversion (3T.cocoa+1T.oil=1 sq.baking chocolate) and the cake turned out very well, moist and tasty. I will surely use this recipe again.

I made this cake for my sister-in-law's birthday. Everyone moaned over how good it was. It made a really nice cake, very moist and scrumptious. Best chocolate cake I think any of us have had. I frosted it with Buttercream Frosting submitted by Diana Wilson. WONDERFUL!

I hate giving a recipe a low rating.  The texure was grainy and it wasn't as chocolaty at I anticipated.  That's not the worst part.  After I had thoroughly cooled it and took it out of the pan.  The middle stuck to the bottom of the pna.  I needed another choc cake in a curry so I bought a mix and nothing stuck (The first time I sprayed and dusted the cake pand.

I made this for my husbands birthday and it was fantastic! Instead of the baking squares I used 9 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa and 3 tablespoons canola oil and instead of sugar I used 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. I also put a butter cream frosting on and it was a hit! He ate almost the whole thing by himself straight from the pan!

Delicious!!! Perfectly moist. I've tried a few chocolate cake recipes using mayonnaise, and this one is a keeper.  I found that I had to add half the flour mixture, then half the water, then repeat the process, as the batter is otherwise quite stiff if you wait to add the water last. I used a glass baking pan, so I lowered the temperature to 325F, and it took about 40 minutes to bake, and came out perfect! Everyone in the family loved it! A definite recommend!!

There was an odd flavor that was off-putting, possibly from the vinegar? The texture was nice but not as moist as the submitter claimed, and the flavor improved a bit after the cake sat out on the kitchen counter for a day or so, but not enough to save it. My 8yo sugar-fiend who's never met a sweet she didn't like took one bite and pushed it away.

Recipe is just okay and not exceptionally good. To prevent lumps and overbeating due to efforts to take out the lumps --- it would be better to mix the flour alternately with the warm water, intead of adding the entire liquid after adding the entire flour. I still prefer my traditional recipe in terms of taste, flavor and consistency.

Easy to prepare & didn't take long to make.  However the cake DOES NOT taste like chocolate. My sister asked what flavor it was although it clearly looked chocolate.  It wasn't sweet and I don't know how other people could rate this as "the best". To say it's meteocre is even a compliment.  I'd rather make something from the box like Betty Crocker brand or something, at least it'll taste like what it says it is. BOO two thumbs down. Even my cream cheese frosting couldn't help this cake.  *I made it EXACTLY as the recipe states.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday and he couldn't speek, he could only moan with his mouth full!  I followed the recipe but changed the chocolate a bit.  I added a tbsp. of hershy's unsweetened cocoa, used only two squares of unsweetened, and then added about 3/4 cup of semi sweet chips, and 1/8 cup of bittersweet.  I topped it with the recipe on the back of the cocoa for perfectly chocolate chocolate frosting, and it was absolutely amazing and moist!  The batter is runny and it took a while longer to bake but delicious!

I made this for my husband birthday and we loved it!!  We love moist, rich cakes and this was perfect.  I used the Chocolate-Genache Icing recipe from this site and it was just the right touch.  Not too sweet.  I also made it in two round cake pans and put cherries into some of the icing to make a "filling" between the layers.  Yum!!!

Love it! Several times during the prep I was sure I'd ruined it...it was alarmingly liquid compared to other cakes I've made, but  it rose beautifully and the texture and taste were perfect. I didn't have any white vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and was sure that would ruin it, but I couldn't tell anything was wrong. Very moist and very good. I topped it with coconut flavoured icing and then a layer of shredded coconut and it had a very nice flavour overall. Very different cake for me, but everyone seemed to like it!

I just made 2 of these cakes and I was not happy with the taste, it was very bland.  I thought that maybe I read the recipe wrong but I found that I didn't. This cake would be great if you want to serve it with a drizzle of chocolate sauce on top or maybe add a bunch of chocolate chips in it.  I served it at a bbq yesterday and I got the same feedback.  It's just not chocolatey!

I tried this recipe and didn't really like it. I thought the cake was really gummy and I even had to keep it in the oven 10 min. longer than the recipe called for. I also thought it didn't have much flavor even with frosting.

This recipe turned out wonderfully! At first, I was a little skeptical, because of how much mayonnaise was called for, and because the batter ended up so liquid. But when the cake came out, it was light, fluffy, moist, and very rich.

Sorry, the chocolate cake was lacking the rich chocolate taste. In fact, it tasted almost rubbery. I'm not too sure what went wrong. But I won't be trying this recipe again.

Easy to make and very moist, but not enough chocolate flavor for me.  Everyone ate it, but nobody raved.  I could taste the tang of mayo in it and found that slightly off-putting.

I call this the OMG!-Chocolate cake!  What some people may be calling "gummy", I call Fudgie!  this cake is so moist, and rich, it needs no icing.  Seriously!  It is like having a mouthful of cake, fudge, and icing all at once.  A very serious keeper!  The only thing I would recommend is waiting for it to cool about 15 minutes in pan, and then completely cool before cutting to allow the cake to kind of settle into itself a little, or it may initially be a bit crumbly, but who cares, the crumbs were even moist!

I honestly thought at first this cake was awful but then...oh wow it is dense not fluffy, and the more it sits, it just keeps getting better..used a bit more chocolate chips and one cup of coffee in place of one of the cups of water, then just sprinkled it with chocolate chips after baked...oh served it with chocolate wine swirled on the plate simply perfect,

Sorry, but I made it exactly according to directions, only exception being I cooked it in a Bundt pan.  The entire outer layer stuck to the pan (which had been well greased.)  So, I couldn't serve it at my daughter's birthday party, but I could taste the cake.  Hardly any chocolate flavor at all, too salty, and an aftertaste of baking soda.

When I was in grade school, (many, MANY years ago) my best friend used to bring chocolate cake in her lunch and I would beg her for some of it.  It was THE best chocolate cake I had ever had.  I have spent the last 40 (or more) years looking for a recipe that came close to that cake.  I think this recipe is it.  The texture is perfect.  It isn't soft like a mix cake, it's dense, and moist and fabulous.  Alternately add the flour and water to the chocolate mixture and mix gently with a spoon or spatula...no need for whisks or power mixers. You simply must try this cake.  It goes together quickly and is really, REALLY good!

I've made a fair number of chocolate cakes in my time but this is now my "GO-TO" choc. cake.  This is what Grammy made....this is what little kids dream of...this is what you make when you're DYING for a piece of choc. cake and you positively KNOW that nothing at the store or in a box is going to be worthy of your desire.  This is also what you make when you don't have any eggs or oil in the house!!

Because I have two friends who are gluten intolerant, I used this as a base and revamped it.  THANK YOU AUNT JOYCE.  Because it's different enough, if I can figure out how to get it on here, I'll enter it as Auntie Nee's APPLE Gluten free chocolate cake.

Nice, moist, chocolaty flavor.  I made this for the 4th of July and took it to work.  Kind of tough to use as a cake to decorate with because of the texture but the results are really good.  Everybody loved it!  The batter looks really runny before you put it in the pan but it bakes up great.

This cake did taste good, but it was a little odd.  It was sort of chewy and had pockets in it that reminded me of a sponge.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

Well, I am one of those unfortunate ones that was not pleased with this. It had a good flavor and it was moist, but I just couldn't get past the weird texture. Hard to describe. I followed the recipe to a T and I definitely won't waste my mayo on this again.

Sorry Aunt Joyce.  Really disliked this cake. I made it exactly as written. Strange flavor, gummy (I didn't bake it quite long enough - it needed more than 35 minutes - my fault, but even on the edges where it was cooked thoroughly, it still wasn't very enjoyable).  The one thing I will say - I turned it into a "Hello Kitty" cake for a birthday party, and the texture was perfect for that! Cutting out the cat shape was easy, and it came out of the pan nicely.  I just wish we enjoyed the flavor and texture more.

No more box cake in this house. Yes, the ingredients are different but it came out so moist and has a wonderful chocolate flavor. I followed this recipe to a "T" and topped it with Mom's Buttercream Frosting by Adora Marchi from this site. Its a very fluffy frosting but not sweet, a wonderful compliment for such a great tasting cake. Thank you Karen for an awesome cake !!!!

Mind you that I was on a diet for three months before I tried this recipe, so that might have influenced my star rating. I thought this cake was fantastic! So much so, that I saved a little batter for myself after I put the rest into the cake pans. Very moist and rich. It is dense but that is a plus. A side note however, when making cupcakes with this recipe would want to lessen the baking time to keep the dense moisture. Great recipe!

This is the BEST chocolate cake I've ever made! Very moist.  I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception- I had no baking chocolate so I substituted 9 Tbsp. of cocoa mixed with 3 Tbsp. canola oil.  I also could not taste the mayonnaise! I'll make this one again and again.  Thanks

Well, I had to make this cake when I saw the ingredients, it was just so unusual! 
It looked fantastic, tasted chocolatey (I used the cocoa powder and oil) but the texture was slightly rubbery. However it didn't detract much from the cake, nearly all my family loved it!

This was AWESOME!!! I was unsure of this recipe because of the mayo but I tried it and LOVED it.  This will be my chocolate cake recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I took it to work today and everyone raved about how moist it was.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I have been looking for chocolate cake recipe for a 13 x 9 inch pan and this is deliciously moist with a great chocolate taste. I did use the cocoa powder and butter alternative for the chocolate squares. This cake rose well and did not sink after coming out of the oven like other chocolate cake recipes I have made in the past.

I was very optimistic about making this cake given so many previous 5 star ratings, but was disappointed with the final product.

The cake texture and moisture was great, it just had no flavor. I used high quality choc squares, but still no luck. The only saving grace for this cake was the peanut butter frosting I put on it!

This was the first time I ever made any cake. It came out ok. My suggestion is to use semi-sweet choclate instead of unsweet.and It needs more time to cook, like 10 min more.

My dad is a huge fan of mayo cake, so I made this for his birthday.  It was super easy and came out very delicious.  I made it in a bundt pan, so I had to cook it about 50 minutes.  Every time my mom tried to make mayo cake it breaks apart.  This one came out of the pan very easily.

Wonderfully moist and delicious! I love that you don't need eggs for it too, those always go so fast in our house. I follow exactly, and it turns out great. I was skeptical the first time I made this because of the watery consistency of the batter, and it didn't really taste amazing when licking the spoon. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the end result was. My favorite from-scratch cake, and beats the heck out of Betty Crocker.

My favorite cake, by far!
Batter is runny, but never fear, this cake will turn out amazingly well...have faith in the recipe. :)
I use cocoa powder and oil instead of chocolate squares and have always, always had wonderful results.

Excellent chocolate cake!  Very moist with good chocolate flavor and not overly sweet. The batter seems very thin when pouring it into the pan, but it's always come out fine. This has become my go to recipe for chocolate cake.  I did try the recipe once with cake flour instead of all purpose flour and the texture was wrong; so I will stick to all purpose going forward.

I made this tonight for the first time while getting dubious looks for using mayo and vinegar, but the skeptics were silenced and we all LOVE this cake!  It's definitely the perfect chocolateyness, not sickeningly so like most chocolate cakes are.  the only alteration i made was to use 3 tbsp of cocoa powder and 1 tbsp of vegetable oil in place of the unsweetened chocolate squares; after i thoroughly mixed the two i nuked it for about 1 1/2 minutes and it blended beautifully with the other ingredients.  this is such a great recipe, i will be whipping this one out whenever i want to impress!

Made this per directions the other night and it was wonderful and thick and fudgy.  You do need to bake it about 15 minutes longer.

I made this cake for my daughters birthday last year and at her request, again this year.  It's dense and moist and very chocolaty.  I used a chocolate ganache recipe to top it off, talk about rich!  Perfect remedy for any chocolate craving, thanks you!

Word of advice: try to make the recipe once first before planning on bringing it to an important event so you know what to expect (and decide if this is really the recipe you want to go with...). I was in charge of dessert for my friend's Easter dinner, and this cake didn't quite turn out like I expected. It tasted GOOD. But it wasn't cakey (very moist, like a cross between custard and cake?!). I found out that the texture had improved after a day of sitting on the counter (yes, there were left-overs...), so you might think of making it one day ahead.

The recipe was very simple and the cake was, indeed, moist. The sugar was just about right but I think I would probably add more chocolate next time.

My DS wanted a chocolate cake for his birthday so I decided to try this one.  He loved it!  It wasnt until later that I told him what was in it.  He got a little grossed out but now its a big joke.  He wants the cake every year.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it came out perfect.  Word of advice though, dont tell anyone whats in it, just tell them its a secret recipe.  I've had a few people who loved the cake until I told them what was in it, then they wouldnt touch it.  Try it, you wont be disappointed.  Its delicious and I dont even care for chocolate cake.

I was looking for a moist dense chocolate cake and I found it in this one.  This was so good I didn't even frost it.  I only had semi-sweet chocolate squares so that is what I used.  Didn't cut back on the sugar either but was wonderful.

This is a fantastic recipe.  The cake is one of the moistest cakes I've ever made and is really simple to make.  We live in  NJ (sea level) and it took about 55 minutes for the cake to bake, not the 30-35 minutes recommended in the recipe.

Do not let the mayonnaise scare you away!!  My mom made mayonnaise cakes for years and one day I couldnt find the recipe but I found this one. This is the one I make all the time now! I NEVER tell people what it is until they try it and when I do tell them, they are amazed that it is made with mayo.  Something about the mayo that makes a dense, moist yummy cake!  I followed the recipe exact except I had to cook mine a little bit longer and it came out perfect.  I brought it into work and got rave reviews over it.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

WOW... this was incredible!!! I really had my doubts as I added water, no eggs and my batter came out so loose.  But this cake was by far the best chocolate cake.  I actually do not care for cake, but I found myself wanting more.  I paired this up with a chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache, and finished it off with some chocolate shavings, delishhhh... My grandfather who's been a chef for years couldnt get over this cake.. def a keeper!!

The cake was very moist, but flavor was barely okay. The texture was awesome, denser than most cakes, just how I love it. However it was not very chocolatey, so would probably not make again following this recipe. It was thin, a little cracked on top. If i made it again I would probably just add 3 ounces of sweetened chocolate and add it while melting the unsweetened chocolate.

I made this cake with Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, which worked OK.  The moist, chewy texture is very nice but I have to agree with the reviewer who said it's not very chocolaty (using cocoa, not squares).  I think it would be nicer with frosting, but it's a bit bland when left plain.  Still, the texture is fantastic.  Next time I will try twice as much chocolate and a little more sugar.

Sooooo good!!! If you want a chocolate cake that is moist and delicous....make this! I was a little scared with the whole mayonasie thing but it works! I made for a party and everyone loved it. I had to take the rest of the cake to my mom's house so I wouldn't eat the whole thing! MAKE IT! You won't regret it!

LOVE IT! I only had 2/3 cup of mayo, so I subbed 1/3 cup of plain yogurt.  It is moist, chocolatey, goodness!  This is definitely taking the place of my boxed cakes.  Yum!

This is the first time in a long time I've made cake from scratch... and it turned out really well! I'm very pleased. I actually made cupcakes, it yielded 18 and they were done in 20 minutes.

I always make this recipe and this time I halved it.   Turned out perfect. Just needed more time to bake in a loaf pan.

I had never tried a cake recipe with mayonaise but this may have been the best cake I've made!  I used rich dark chocolate and it was the best!

Awesome! Moist! Chocolatey! Made it according to the recipe. Don't worry that the batter is liquidy. It turns out great. Rave reviews at work. I combined it with Seven Minute Frosting I by Karen Davenport and people couldn't keep their hands off it.

I have tried four or five different chocolate cake recipies in the last two years and this is probably the best.  It is full of chocolate flavor, and is it ever moist!  In a 9x13 pan, it rocks...and is even better the next day...if it lasts that long...oh, and you've got to use Tracy Larsen's "Creamy Chocolate Icing" with this cake.

This cake was very, very good! The texture and flavor was great. I only made a small portion to try it out, since I thought the mayonnaise was a bit unusual, and then it never saw the next day, my family ate it up!

This cake was great! It was easy to make, tasted good even in the batter (Though I was preparing for it not to based on a previous review). My family finished it in two days. They were a bit surprised when I told them about the mayonnaise, but hey! they still ate it! And that shows something. It's great. Moist, not too sweet or bland. It doesn't rise that much, so don't expect it to. Enjoy it!
