If you're having a hard time getting the rice to cook all the way, cut the sugar back.  Otherwise, this is quite good!

Well, my gf made some changes and they must of been the wrong changes because this receipe did not turn out!  She used brown rice in place of the basmatti and used brown sugar instead of white.  Somehow the rice never cooked. It never absorbed the water.  My guess it that the sugar coated the rice so much that it couldn't cook.  She cooked it for at least 45 mins and it was still hard.  We tried to eat it- but it was very very sweet- and the cashews were soggy.  Seems to me the cashew and the raisins could be added last- instead of cooking them with the rice. - and use add less sugar- as the previous review suggests.

After spending about 15 bucks for ingredients for this I was highly disappointed. It was WAY too sweet!! I had a guest refer to it as tasting like fruit loops. :( I might try again, but I will omit all the sugar and use chicken stock.

i really did not like this rice.  it did not cook all the way, and it was very very sweet.  i think that a lot less sugar may do the trick...

I really enjoyed this recipe! I wouldn't make it every day, but for something different to do with rice it was delicious. I did make some changes though. First, 1/4 cup of sugar seems way too much so I only used 1 tablespoon. Next time I'll try it without any sugar because the raisins provide plenty of sweet. I also used regular butter and just threw everything together into the rice cooker at the same time, although I did let the saffron soak a few minutes first. Much simpler and a delicious result!

Actually 4 1/2 stars.  I was skeptical, but this is really good and I would have given it 5 stars but fora few things.  The method of cooking the rice and adding the ingredients doesn't really work.  Use your usual method, add the saffron to the water and let it cook together with the rice then add the rest of your flavorings as soon as you determine all the water is absorbed,  stir it all in, cover tightly and allow to rest for five minutes or so.  There is enough heat and residual moisture.  I cut the sugar to 2 tbs.  And last, fishing for the cloves is a nuisance, I just used 1/4 tsp ground cloves and left out the whole.  I just wish I knew if this is meant to be a sweetish side dish or a very mildly sweet dessert.  Either way, it is very tasty!
