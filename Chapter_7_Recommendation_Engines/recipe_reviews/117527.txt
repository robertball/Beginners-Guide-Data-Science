Wow--SO good!  I would have never thought to do broccoli on the grill like this. Hubby was way ahead of me and grilled it before I had a chance to shake it in the Parmesan, so I had to sprinkle it over once he came in with it. Grilling gave it a nice, smokey flavor, and I can only imagine how much better it would have been with the cheese getting all brown and bubbly. Great idea!

Holy smokes! This is a great recipe!  Makes amazing broccoli, I almost ate them all myself!  I made them in the oven (it's winter and soooo cold outside!) so I put them in a 400 degree oven for 17 minutes and it roasted them to perfection! This would actually probably work well with cauliflower & asparagus too.

This lemon/cheese marinade is perfect. I also opted for the oven, because I have a short attention span and tend to ruin fragile veggies on the grill. Turned out great! Thanks Alice!

I love this recipe! I didn't grill it though. I put it on the stove top and put a dash of red pepper flakes for color and spice! Thanks so much for the great recipe (:

Absolutely delicious! Not your boring old broccoli at all. Well, the grill would not work so I just baked these in a foil packet in the oven at 350 degrees F for about 5 minutes. Lemon and cheese add a delicious flavor, almost reminds me of chicken picatta. Try this!

This was really delicious!  I grilled it for about 15 mins.  It came out perfect and had TONS of flavor.  Just make sure it is covered tight.  I drizzled some more olive oil over it before grilling and I didn't have to tend to it while it was cooking.  The broccoli really sucks up that grill taste.  Super duper good and I will make this again!

The flavor was great, but I ran into a few problems.  I needed more liquid to coat the broccoli, so I drizzled on a little extra olive oil.  Most of the parmesan fell off and burned on the grill, and the broccoli was dry.  That may have been my fault, though.  I'll probably give it another try.

We put our grill pan on the top rack and gave the broccoli a shake every time we fussed with the turkey tenderloins on the lower rack.  Really nice bright lemon taste.

This was a very good and easy recipe, maybe a little more lemon juice next time to punch up the taste.

This was excellent!  I was looking for a "non boring", easy broccoli recipe and this fit the bill.  We didn't put the broccoli directly on the grill, but instead enclosed it in tin foil.  It still turned out great and I didn't have to go to the store for extra ingredients.

Good flavor.  I failed to closely watch the grilling progress and overcooked the broccoli.  With diligence, presentation would have been fabulous as well.

I didn't measure the ingredients, I put them on skewers, didn't cover, and cooked them for 10 minutes, turning once. One of my new favorites.. already cooked it twice his week! Next, i'm gonna grill some to put on top of grilled pizza!

I added small bella mushrooms and asparagus on hand. I used grated Romano cheese which was a little soft so maybe mine turned out a little different. Used a grill skillet with holes in it. The cheese had a nice crunch.. Pretty good! Not sure if I'llill try again, if so will use parmesan cheese.

Yummy. I marinated as instructed but decided to grill my broccoli in a foil packet. Right before I put in i threw some cheese on and mixed up. Grilled over low heat for 15 minutes, flipped then grilled for another 15. Super good!

Must have done something wrong, probably too high heat---burnt on the outside --raw on the inside.  Really wanted to like it.  maybe will try again

Loved the bitter and cheesy taste. I'm all about the grill this summer and I'm so glad I tried this recipe. I didn't use fresh but frozen broccoli because we are moving this month and all the food has to be eaten. During the winter, I'll have to try these in the oven. served with Marinated Pork Chops and Roasted Garlic Cauliflower (grilled).

I really loved this recipe. I tried to do this all in a large bowl but ended up having to use the large ziploc. It took a lot longer for ours to cook but grilling recipes tend to vary so much on time you just need to judge it yourself in my experience. I would say ours took twice as long to cook. We didn't use the foil, just made sure the stalks were long enough so they didn't fall through the grates as suggested. Even with the extended cooking time they retained quite a bit of crunch, which I liked. Served with grilled buffalo chicken legs and grilled "baked" potatoes. Easy and delicious. I made some broccoli soup with the leftovers and the grilled broccoli gave the soup such great flavor. The leftovers would also be wonderful in pasta, I think. I will definitely make this again with leftovers in mind, of course. If you don't like crisp veggies I would suggest blanching the stalks first.

These were GREAT!  I put everything in a bag and added the broccoli and let marinate an hour or so.  Placed broccoli mixture in a tin foil packed and grilled.  Yummy!

Wow!!  My husband's favorite vegetable is broccoli and this was an amazing way to make it.  I would have never ever thought to make broccoli on the grill but I am so glad that I found this recipe.  The only changes I made was to reduce the oil by a little bit and squeezed two lemons into the marinade.  Also, I let it marinade for a few hours and cooked it a little bit longer over lower heat and just sprinkled the cheese on it while it was on the grill.  Everyone was eating it right off the grill it was so good!  I can't recommend this enough for an inexpensive, and super healthy bbq side dish!

This is SOOO yummy!!!  I had it at a friends house when she made it for dinner.  I wasn't sure by the looks of it if I would like it or not...guess what?  Not only did I LOVE it, but the kids loved it too!!!  I now have a way to get them to eat broccoli!

Wow! This was great! I am not a broccoli person (unless it is doused in cheese or some other sauce), but my husband likes it, so I bought some with the intention of making some stirfry Chinese style dish...but dinners got mixed up, as always & I needed an easy side tonight. This was perfect! The flavor was great, we both gobbled it up, I will definitely be making this again & passing on the recipe- I did not think it was that lemony at all (I used about 1/2 a lemon, didn't measure the juice) and I used a grill basket on a grill heated to about 400 degrees, tossing regularly. Thanks!

I originally got this recipe from Light & Tasty Magazine and have been making this dish for a couple of years.  It is a family favorite.  You can prepare the broccoli and marinade ahead and just let it hang out until you are ready to grill.  I use a grill pan sprayed with Pam.  I was glad to find this recipe on your website, so I wouldn't have to look thru all my magazines.  

My adult son (who hates vegies) ate this up and wanted more.

It doesn't look anything special - but both my husband and I separately said "WOW" after the first bite.   Love that I can add it to the grill repertoire.  I didn't measure exactly but did what they said directionally and went a little heavier on the lemon.

I made this today without the parmesean (just didn't have any) and it was good. My husband, who I expected not to like it (because he's used to vegetables being boiled to death), really enjoyed it. We both really noticed and enjoyed the lemon flavour. Next time I think I'll try it in tin foil, as my broccolli did get  bit over charred.

This was a fantastic way to change from the standard broccoli dishes. I followed the recipe pretty closely with the exception of adding crushed fresh garlic to the marinade and coating the florets by hand with parmesan. I also didn’t use the non-stick spray on the grill. The cheese stuck to the broccoli really well and got nicely crispy and toasty. Wonderful! Thank you Alice! Even the teenagers who must typically be forced to eat their veggies loved it.

Made it just like it said to and it was great. The lemon really did add that extra little zip.

Love this recipe! Made it exactly by the recipe. My son even liked them, and he is very picky about broccoli! I loved that they were still crunchy, and still very flavorful! I'm going to try this on asparagus! ;0)

Delicious! We made it while on vacation. Marinated it a little longer in a zip-lock, added extra lemon juice and olive oil, since the amounts given seemed not quite enough. We didn't have any Parmesan and it was still excellent!  I made a multi-layer foil pouch (to try to prevent scorching) and just flipped it over  a few times on the grill while cooking the meal.  Yummy!

I think it has potential to be a great recipe...apparently, my grilling skills failed. The broccoli was burnt on the ends and still raw in the middle, and the cheese just fell off into the grill. Someone help me! I love broccoli, and this sounds so good...

I LOVE broccoli cooked like this! I usually just bake it in the oven (line a baking sheet with foil) at 400 degrees. I like to add garlic powder to it as well. I don't know the amounts of the ingredients I use, because I just throw them on there, but I don't think the amounts really matter. You can pretty much eyeball the whole thing! Mmmmm, so good!

This was AMAZING!!!Some changes I made...I used lemon and lime juice along with the olive oil.  I also added Italian seasoning along with the salt and pepper. The broccoli turned out really good.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a fabulous side dish. I loved the tang of the lemon, and the savoriness of the Parmesan. However, I did think that the recipe called for too much lemon, and not enough oil, so I'll probably alter that a wee bit next time. Overall, fantastic.

This was very good, but a little too strong on the lemon flavor for us. We made it on the grill using a grill basket.  That way we didn't have to deal with flare-ups from spraying the grates and it made clean-up easier.  We'll definitly be making it again, but I will reduce the lemon.  Thanks for the great summer recipe!

OMG!  Didn't know broccoli could be sooo good!  The combo of lemon and parm was just amazing. The only change I made was to cook it in the oven at 400 degrees for 17 min. as a previous reviewer did.  Oh yum!  It came out perfect!  This recipe is so easy and quick to put together.  Can't wait to have it on the grill this summer.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I thought about giving this a four star because I thought it had a bit to much of a lemon flavor but then I think I put a little too much lemon juice in it. And didnt cook it long enough. So it gets a five star because it was a very good recipe despite my mess ups. I will make this agian.

Broccoli on the grill is easy. I put to much olive oil on the first time, thinking all of the brococoli needed to be covered. It was crunchy but didn't taste right.  The second time I drizzled a little over the broccoli and it was better.  Next time I plan to spray it with butter or drizzle melted butter over it.  My kids love veggies with butter so I'm gonna give it a try.

Simple and delicious. I've made this on the grill and under the broiler. Trader Joe's Quattro Formaggio shredded cheese mix works well.

I love grilled broccoli! Every time I make it, no matter how much broccoli I buy, it all gets consumed. I definitely use less cheese than the recipe and have gone without it (vegan version). Grill the broccoli over charcoal and add some wood chips to give the broccoli a slight smokey flavor.

This was very, very good -- and that's coming from someone with an aversion to broccoli! :)  I made the recipe as directed, but crushed up about a 1/4 tsp. of minced garlic with the salt and lemon before adding the other ingredients.  It really rounded out the flavor.  Highly recommended.

This was an okay recipe, but nothing to rave about. I guess it's better than just steamed. One reviewer complained that the lemon was too strong, but it wasn't overpowering.  I'd make it again if I had broccoli lying around. I'm going to look for a better broccoli recipe.

Wow - Broccoli on the grill is outstanding! Be sure to leave the broccoli pieces large to not fall through the grate. We did ours on a charcoal grill with outstanding results.

We thought this was okay but we prefer our usual.  We just coat broccoli florets with butter or butter spray, drop them in the grill basket, then grill until they look "ready".

This was very good but I have to admit that I did make some changes... I added califlower and onions to the vegetable mix. I also omitted the lemon juice and added some season salt, all together it was very tasty.

I liked this recipe.  I would have never thought of putting broccoli on the grill.  I used a grill basket.   My husband, though, wasn't a fan of the lemon with the broccoli.

this is my favorite way to have broccoli now!  we don't have a veggie dish for the grill so I baked it for about 10 minutes at 400.  I also threw in some mushrooms to the mix, they went well with the broccoli.

Quick, Easy and Tasty!  As some others suggested, I roasted this in the oven at 400 deg for approx 17 minutes(it's Feb in Ohio, haha)     I didn't have time to let it stand for 30 minutes, just tossed and spread on a cookie sheet sprayed with Pam. I also only sprinkled the cheese over the top of the broccoli once I put it on the cookie sheet, and it still turned out great! I can't wait to try it on the grill!

Absolutely delicious! I would also reccomend adding either fresh or jarred garlic. For easy flipping on the grill, try using skewers. Delicious!!!

This was so good.  I did add some garlic powder to the marinade because we love garlic and also placed it in an alum. container along with the corn we were grilling.  It was so good and easy.  I did let it marinate longer than the recipe called for because our dinner was delayed.  It was still perfect.  Thanks for another keeper.

This was a neat recipe.  We used our grill basket and although we got a burnt sort of taste (surely our fault as we had a lot going on the grill), it was good.  Make sure to grill long enough unless you like crunchy broccoli which I do not.

I thought that this was really good, but hubby didn't care for it as much.  (However, it soaked in the marinade overnight)!  We also grilled in a foil pan - and I thought they turned out really tasty.

This is excellent, thanks!  I baked as others did, and it worked very well.  Very lemony--and that may be bc I didn't really measure and just tossed it in.  But very nice, quick, and a good way to eat broccoli.  Only thing I didn't use was the parmesan bc I don't have any, so just sprinkled with shredded mozzarella.

The taste was ok, but the cooking time was way too long. Even in the foil packet it burnt quickly. I don't think I'll try this again.
