i have made this pie so many times and thought it was about time i gave it a proper review:).  obviously... since i have made it a million times... i LOVE this recipe.  the crust is easy to work with and the filling is so yummy... i sometimes use all brown sugar for my filling.  but what makes the pie is the topping.  the honey topping puts this pie above other pecan pies.  i have made the topping by itself to serve with apple pie, banana cheesecake, ice cream, etc.  but for this i add a little cream or milk to thin the sauce before i add the pecans because otherwise when it cools it's like hard toffee.  please people... make this pie:).

This is the BEST pecan pie recipe I have ever tried. I made 2- one to take for Thanksgiving and one to keep for myself. The first pie was in a glass pan and was beautiful with perfect consistancy. I only had a foil pan for the second and it turned out undercooked. I suggest using a glass pie dish for a perfect pie.

I originally wrote in saying that my filling had the consistency of scrambled eggs but since I liked the taste so much I still made it for thanksgiving.  Anticipating the "eggy" problem, I noticed my filling was not smooth when I was getting ready to pour it into the pie crust, therefore I strained the filling and it came out perfect!  Everyone loved it.
Thanks!

I have used this recipe for over two years and the complements never stop!  It is the best pecan pie I've ever had.  I add extra vanilla to the pie mix and pecans to the pie and topping.  ( I use store bought pie cruse--a good one-- and bake it for a few minutes before filling it)  If you cook the topping while it boils for at least two minutes it will not be runny.  And I like to make this pie ahead of time.  It needs to be refrigerated for several hours to firm up or it will be runny.

DOUBLE YUM!  I loved this pie.  I used my own crust and baked in a 9" glass pie pan.  For others who have had runny filling, please note TOTAL baking time is 45 min. to 1 hour and 5 min.  I gave half of this pie to my parents.  I don't know if they liked it yet but I don't care.  This is the only pecan pie I'll be making from now on.

I MADE THIS PIE THREE TIMES TO ENTER INTO OUR LOCAL FAIR BAKING CONTEST.  I WON 1ST PLACE IN THE PIE CATEGORY!  I USED A DIFFERENT CRUST RECIPE, THOUGH. MOST PEOPLE THAT TASTED THIS PIE LIKED IT BECAUSE THE TOPPING WAS CRUNCHY AND THE PIE WAS NOT SICKENING SWEET LIKE TRADITIONAL PECAN PIE.

The pie was yummy. However, when the PieRecipe.com editors rewrote this recipe, they left off a couple things. 

I only discovered this because I went and found the original recipe on piecouncil.org

Like many reviewers, I loved the topping, but the filling was not to my liking.  My favorite pecan pie recipe on allrecipes is the Kentucky Pecan Pie.  I am going to try adding this honey crunch topping to that recipe.  I believe it will make an awesome combination!!!!

Listen to the rest of the reviews:  You really should use a 10" pie pan.  The filling will overflow the smaller crust & you don't want to waste any!

The HIT of Thanksgiving at my house, and my best friend's house! Puts other pies to shame. If you are concerned about curdling your egg mixture with the hot butter, try introducing a little of the egg mixture (like a tbsp) into the bowl with the melted butter and whisk  for 30 seconds. Repeat another two times and the butter should be at the right temperature. This pie is worth the extra effort!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I prepared this with the "help" of my 2 and 5 year olds and despite this :) it came out great!  Loads of compliments at Thanksgiving.  Like another reviewer, I, too, prefer less "goo" inside, so I added approximately 1/2 cup more of chopped pecans.  It was perfect.

The first time I made this recipe my partner and I decided the topping made the pie too rich, so the second time I made this recipe for I omitted the topping. We both decided that without the topping it was one of the best pecan pies we had ever eaten. It received rave reviews from our guests at Thanksgiving. The only other adjustment I made was to decrease the corn syrup from 1 c to 3/4 c as I like my pecan pie a little less sweet. Also, I used one of the already made dough crusts to save time.  The texture of the filling is so creamy, probably due to the 4 eggs. Very easy to make. If you want to make a delicious traditional pecan pie this is the recipe for you:)

I own a Pecan business & make Pecan Pies for the public.  I have my usual one I make which is a lot like this one but I don't use the brown sugar. So this year I added this one to my choices. Now the glazed Pecans on top not only add a special "crunch" but the presentation is outstanding. Now here is your hint... and this is not just because I own a Pecan store...take this to the bank..Use FRESH Pecans not store bought. Pick some up & shell them or go to a Pecan shop that gathers them. It makes ALL the difference in your pie. You spend a lot of time cooking & nothing is more horrible than an old rancid pecan out of a bag.

My 2nd time making this since 3 years ago. Always a hit! I used coarsely chopped pecans instead of the halves, left out the bourbon, and used a pie crust from Dorie Greenspan's book. Pecan pie lovers will love this one! "It's not too sweet like others".

This recipe has the perfect amount of pecans and filling.  It is by far the best pecan pie recipe I have tried-not too sweet, but buttery and delicious.

I received the ultimate compliment on this pie from my mother-in-law, who declared it the best pecan pie she had ever eaten--and she has always made THE BEST pecan pies! My husband also declared it the best, even though he loved the recipe I used to use. This recipe has a very similar filling to my recipe, but the topping, as amyt's review stated before, is what puts it above all the others. I used brown sugar in the filling, as well as brown sugar Karo for the corn syrup; I used about 1-1/4 cups pecans altogether; and I did add the bourbon (and loved it!) I will add less salt next time, maybe 1/4 teaspoon, because I thought it tasted too salty, but since no one else complained, maybe it was just my taste. This is THE recipe my pecan pie-loving husband wants me to stick with!

The pie is GOOD...no doubt about it, but!  I wasn't crazy about the filling texture.  If you like a smoother filling, this recipe doesn't give you it.  The filling was the texture of soft scrambled eggs.  However!  I loved the topping. Excellent flavor. So I will use my favorite Pecan Pie recipe and add this topping to it.  Thanks Sarah.

Good recipe.  I tripled the pecans in the pie recipe (to 3 cups) and used a frozen, premade pie shell.  I'm not a fan of the typical pecan pie "goo" so I always either double or triple the amount of pecans.  I made this for my dad (for Father's Day) and being the pecan connoisseur that he is, he definitely appreciated the additional pecans.  Next time, I'll do my "usual" dressing up of the pie, by drizzling semi-sweet chocolate over the pie, and then do the honey crunch topping. Overall, it's a good recipe.

Fabulous!  Took a few pieces to the office for my friend and somehow the scent attracted others out of THEIR offices and they were begging for a piece!  I had to bring my friend some more the next day cause everyone gobbled hers up!

I absolutely love pecan pie.  This version is no exception.  The crust was a little heavy but not too overpowering.  Otherwise, the honey and the bourbon are excellent additions to this recipe.

I don't eat pecan pie, so I relied on taste reviews from my family.  They all said it was good.  That's why I gave 4 stars.  I will not, however, make this again.  I too thought the consistency was a little odd (think eggs).  Also, I used a deep dish pan, and it still bubbled over onto the crust.  Much to my dismay, it also went under the crust, which made the crust stick to the pan.  Of course everyone was standing around witnessing this. How embarrasing!  It could have gone without the topping, too crunchy, too much...

The first time I made this pie I entered it into the Tunbridge World's Fair and it got the Judge's Choice Ribbon for the best pie!  One of the judges looked at the underneath side of the pie and said, "It's nearly perfect."  All I could think was, "So what's not perfect about it?"  It's an awesome recipe!

I am a novice "pie maker", but I had no trouble with this recipe.  It was beautiful to look at and received rave reviews.  I cheated and used a pre-made crust (a sin, I know) - but it was still delicious and a great recipe.

The Honey did add a very nice flavor but it was too sweet for our taste.  You also may want to use less of the filling so that when you add the topping the pie doesn't overflow quite so much.

This was excellent!  Made as directed but added more nuts (just so I could use the up).  I don't normally like pecan pie so I was a little hesitant when one was requested of me.  One bite made me a convert, though.  Not too sweet, not too heavy, just delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I decided to try this recipe for my first attempt at homemade pecan pie. I baked it for my in-laws' Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge hit! Every Thanksgiving my mother-in-law buys homemade pecan pies from the market and this one tasted better! It was not too sweet and the filling set perfectly. As with all of my pies, I used the Easy Pie Crust because it is quick, easy, and delicious. I also added more chopped pecans to the filling to ensure it was not too syrupy and sweet, a common characteristic of store-bought pecan pies. One important tip: be sure the melted butter is not too hot when you add it to the filling, or you will scramble your eggs! I think this was a problem for some reviewers. Try this recipe, the honey-glazed toasted pecans in the topping were amazing!

I really liked the honeyed pecan topping, but I kept getting little rubbery pieces of scrambled egg in the filling. I used my own crust, and next time I would probably only use 3 eggs. The flavor was very good, though.

My father-in-law is a pecan pie connoisseur, so I have been trying for several years to impress him by making the "perfect" pecan pie.  He told me I could stop trying with this recipe!  It's FANTASTIC!!!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.  It is the BEST EVER!!

I highly recommend this recipe. This is the second year I have made this pie and it is always the first to disappear. Like many others I used a pre-made crust to save time; definitely use a glass pie dish to bake this.

THIS WAS GREAT!  I USED THE BOURBON, AND THIS GAVE IT A REALLY GOOD FLAVOR. THE TOPPING WAS REALLY GOOD.  TALK ABOUT A "SUGAR OVERLOAD"!!  THIS WAS THE 2ND TIME I HAD ATTEMPTED PECAN PIE, AND WILL DEFINITELY STICK WITH THIS RECIPE. THANK YOU!

This pie is fantastic. I used a premade, frozen crust becasue I'm scared of making my own! It still turned out beautifully :)
Tanks for a great recipe!

I was always told that pecan pie is so difficult to make... ha!  Not with this recipe.  It was easy and delicious!  I made it for Thanksgiving for my boyfriend who LOVES pecan pie.  He said it was the best he's ever had and loved the crunchy topping!  We ate every last bit of it and didn't share with anyone =)
Note: Too much filling for a 9" pie crust, especially with the topping.  Make less or use a 10" pie crust.

I had mixed emotions about this pie. I love pecan pie so that alone scored points with me. But, like other reviewers, I had a problem with my filling having the consistancy of very soft scrambled eggs. I wonder if four eggs is just too many? I thought the addition of the topping was beautiful, especially if you take care to position the pecan halves prettily, but it made the pie too hard with the chopped pecans that were already in the filling. Unless you love a crunchy, nutty, pie, I'd suggest eliminating some of the chopped pecans.

Made this for Thanksgiving in lieu of a traditional pecan pie and I loved it. The honey perfectly complemented the pie and I enjoyed the extra crunch on top. My family also were happy with this dessert.

This recipe is a true winner. I just won first place in the dessert category with this pie at a local Hinkelfest cooking contest. I made the pie crust in the food processor which I highly recommend. This recipe might look time consuming to make but it goes together very quickly.

Don't get me wrong, this was quite delicious. The topping, however, wasn't really worth the effort. It didn't "pour" and I had to pick it out in clumps and place it around the pie. A big, sticky mess. And then the end result just wasn't really that much different than the standard recipe I've always used (mix all ingredients, pour into shell, bake). It does have more pecans than other pies I've made. YUM! But I think that can be accomplished without the "topping" hassle. JMO.

I have never been a lover of pecan pie until now...  I did not want to use corn syrup so I used another recipe on this site for the filling.  I used the other recipe for the filling and the glazed pecans from this recipe for the top.  Oh my!  AMAZING!  I think pecan pie is my new favorite!  Thanks for sharing the original idea of glazing the pecans.

I cheated and used a ready-made pie crust and it was truly the best pecan pie I've ever had. My kids don't usually go for nuts of any kind but there was not a single complaint about this pie. Make it! You won't be sorry.

This pie was so good. I made it for Christmas supper and it was just excellent. The honey topping adds just enough of a different twist that it makes it better than most traditional pecan pies.

I made this recipe for our first Thanksgiving in our new house.  I made so much food that we all got too full to finish, but everyone came back for seconds on the pecan pie!  This is the best recipe for pecan pie I have made.  Highly recommended.

I like to make this Maple Crunch Pecan Pie-- I substitute really good pure maple syrup for the honey and it is fabulous. I never liked pecan pie before I made this. The whole family loved it...couldn't even get them to touch the apple pie (usually my specialty!) once they tasted this!

These pies are very good and easy to make.  One thing though, they get really puffy and this is ok.  I am a novice and I had no idea that pies get puffy so don't fret if this happens to you.  The pies sink as they cool.

Absolutely delicious pie.  I left out the bourbon (didn't have any), but thought the pie was perfect without it.  This is very rich, so cut very slender slices (this pie will easily serve 12-16 people).  I topped each piece with a dollop of lightly-sweetened whipped cream.  Yum!

Simply perfection! My mom makes the best pecan pie, and this tops even that. I accidentally dropped the pecan pie when getting it out of the oven, I scraped the spilled pie off the oven door and back into the pie shell and it was STILL the best pie ever. I am very snobby and fastidious when it comes to cooking, and this pie is a showstopper!

I made this for my father-in-law, who is the connoisseur of pecan pies, and he really liked it.  He's told me before that his favorite recipe involves a little bit of Kaluah to cut the sweetness, but I think the whiskey does the same thing to this recipe.
I think this recipe tastes better every time I make it.  My husband even told me that he likes it better than the pies at his family gatherings now!

If you're a beginner at pie crusts like I am, I'd do some separate research first. After following the recipe exactly, my filling was incredibly good, while the crust was hard, floury, salty and gross. My wife watched me do the crust part, so she made sure I didn't over handle it, but I didn't know about chilling the ingredients. Thought I might save somebody some trouble. In all, addictive pie, maybe a bit too much pecan for me.

I have tried a variety of pecan pie recipes, and this is clearly the best that I have found yet.  Like several other reviewers, I also added about an additional cup of chopped pecans to the filling to get a thicker texture.  Great flavor.

This pie is awesome.  I was very impressed with the results.  It presents well and tastes great!!  I will be making this one again.  The only difficulty was covering the edges of the crust with tin foil.  Any suggestions?

I am 33 years old, and grew up with family members who always brought pecan pies to Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners. I really loved their pecan pies, but THIS PIE IS THE BEST PIE I HAVE EVER EATEN!!! My grandmother has a pecan orchard in her estate. I get all the free nuts I want, and now I have a good use for them!

THANKS!!!

Not worth the extra trouble.  My husband loves pecan pie, so I thought that he would be thrilled with this one, but he prefers the classic pecan pie.  Takes more than twice the pecans that a "regular pecan pie" would, but is not any better.

A very tasty pie!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  It was kind of hard to eat with all those pecans on top I think next time I would only put about 3/4 cup of nuts on top.  Also, I think it was better in a 10 inch pie pan instead of 9 inch.  Excellent tasting pie!

I'm not a fan of pecans, so I didn't even taste this.  But it was devoured quickly, and I was told it's better than original pecan pie.

i made this for father's day, i followed the recipe exactly, followed other reviewers suggestions to add more pecans to the filling, and use a glass dish, refrigerated overnight, but the filling was just WAY too liquidy. it's cool if i put it in the freezer for 20 min. before serving, but i like warm pecan pie! i like the topping part, i think next time i'd arrange the nuts on top of the filling, then put the honey mixture on top of that. i don't know, why was the filling no more viscous than maple syrup? y'know, i probly messed up somewhere along the line.

This cake was delicious and got rave reviews at my work party.  The only problem I had was that it overflowed my 9 inch pie pan.  I would recommend using a bigger pan, or cutting back / leaving out some of the filling. Other than the mess in my oven, it was excellent.

I was wary of baking this pie, because I'd never made a pecan pie before. With all that said, this turned out to be the BEST pie I've ever made. And the presentation was just as amazing as the pie itself. :) I did add extra pecans to the top second-go-round.

I have never eaten Pecan Pie, let alone baked one. So I had no idea what it was supposed to look like, texture, etc. A client of mine asked me to prepare one.. After a million searches, this seemed to be the best one...I was RIGHT!!! I used a pre-made crust, and I subbed one of the tb of honey for a tb of Michelle's honey creme syrup (just a personal preference) I didn't change anything else. It was BEAUTIFUL, and I was told that it was the best one he'd ever had, hands-down. The topping was absolutely gorgeous, and had a great candy-like taste/texture. This one is a keeper!

This recipe tastes great, but has a major flaw IMO. What is with step 5? There is no way possible to evenly spoon sticky 1/2 size pecan pieces over the top of the pie. They are molten hot, so forget trying to arrange them nicely! You can't get the pecans on evenly. Once this baked, the top created a VERY hard crust, that was next to impossible to cut thru. Next time I will do either two things: either place the "topping" mixture on the bottom of the crust, or pour the hot honey/sugar mixture over pre-arranged pecan pieces already on the top of the pie.

This must be a great recipe because by the time I got to the Thanksgiving dessert table, it was all gone. Everyone raved about it, and my husband keeps asking when I going to make it again. Guess I'll have to so I can get a taste. I've been taking the pecan pie to family functions for years and that was the first time I didn't bring some back home.
UPDATE: using brandy instead of bourbon makes this pie taste wonderful. I didn't have any bourbon this year, so I substituted brandy and it completely changed the taste into something divine. Amazing! Also, the last cook time should not be 20 mins. - that's too long. Cook for only 10 or else the pecans will get too brown.

This was a very yummy pie...my only problem was that it was still "runny" after cooking for the full cooking time and i wasn't able to tell that till after the pie cooled and was ready to cut. Not sure if it needed to cook longer or what. Thanks for the great recipe!

My pecan pie-loving husband declared this the best pecan pie he has ever had!  I used brown sugar and brown sugar corn syrup in the filling as Grannyloohoo suggested and I felt that the addition of the bourbon gave the filling a nice flavor as well as cutting the overall sweetness that I tend not to like in a pecan pie.  The crunchiness of the pecan topping was perfect.

I was really disappointed by this recipe. It looked beautiful, the topping by itself was awesome and generally pecan pie is one of my favorites. But, this is definitely too sweet for the average person. I was so proud to take such a beautiful pie to Thanksgiving, but once I got my own slice, I was really upset that everyone would have to force down such an incredibly sweet mess, just to be polite. Maybe, it will be better if I leave the topping off as another review says, but then it won't be as pretty either. I may try this again and attempt to cut the sugar, however I'm not hopeful.

This was a very good pecan pie, although I'm going to keep looking for the perfect pie.  The topping didn't add quite as much oomph as I'd hoped.  And, not to get into the issue of calories, but it looks like this pie has almost 200 more calories per serving than other pecan pies on this site.  I don't know if there was anything so special about this pie to justify the extra fat!  But I can't deny that it was really tasty.  Oh...and I used a pre-made crust, and would really recommend pre-baking it for a few minutes before adding the filling.

The filling was good - not too sweet, but we didn't care for the whole nuts on top, and it took much longer time to bake, which made the crust overbaked, even though i covered it with foil.

Loved it.  Definately rivalled the famous goode company pecan pie.  The only thing was I found the vinegar in teh crust to smell and taste stronger than I expected.  Don't know if that was just something I did.

This was very good, I loved it.  I think it would have been even better with a little bit more honey crunch on the top, but overall it's great.

The absolute BEST pecan pie.  Make extra honeyed pecans for the top, cause they are wonderful to just munch on.  Also, I like the top pecans to be roughly chopped, not just cut in half like the recipe calls for.  The halved pecans make it too hard to cut into and too hard to bite into.

I have never made a pecan pie before and so i decided to try this one because it had good reviews. I am only 18 but i like cooking and the pie came out really well. I used a 10" tin and the pastry was sticking up about 3/4" above the topping but and i didn't bother about the aluminium foil around the edges because they weren't burning but then i found that the topping boiled over in the oven and made a real MESS of the oven. Next time i will be either using a deeper dish or putting foil under the dish in the oven so i don't have to clean toffee off the entire oven. But i will definitely be making it again.

The crust on this pie was great.  I will keep it for future pies.  The pecan topping was fabulous, I made extra just to snack on.  But I made a fatal error for the filling, I didn't have corn syrup so I used maple syrup.  Mistake.  The texture was gross and the taste did not match the rest of the pie. My husband didn't seem to notice.  I think my palate is more refined...he said just picky.  I will try this again with the exact recipe...it probably is a 5 star

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was great and really easy to make. The honey crunch topping is definitely what makes this pecan pie better than any other I've ever had.  I used a pre-made piecrust and topped it with caramel ice cream.

Forget pecan pie.  This is flat out the best PIE I've ever made.  Everyone went crazy over it.  It's definitely going to be a new Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition in our family.  I highly recommend this one.

I made this a few times over the holiday season and thought I had reviewed this.  I know I made a few minor changes, but I can't remember them.  All I remember is what a hit it was.  Pecan happens to be my husbands favorite, so he was very pleased!  He said it was a keeper, and I had to search no further for another recipie.  Pretty lucky considering this was my first one!!

This pecan pie was extremely good but turned out runny when baked for the written amount of time. Next time I think I'll add less eggs and bake longer or maybe test with a knife first. It might even be too much sugar (excruciatingly sweet) that is making the filling run. Anyway, these are just surface problems. It's a great tasting pie.

This pie is delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved  it. It was pretty easy to make and only took me about 25 minutes or so to prepare. a tip- i had to bake it an extra 20 minutes and some extra nuts to the topping.

The filling is great (though I prefer more chopped nuts and less goo (if I may call it that)), the crunchy topping is excellent (I used maple syrup instead of honey and did not have bourbon)!, but the crust is a disaster!! It looked like playdo when raw, and it tasted like playdo when done.  Make sure you use your own good pie crust recipe.  I thought I would risk it because of all the good reviews but the crust was yucky and sort of ruined the rest of the exerience...  :(

I used this recipe for my first ever pecan pie and it was wonderful! I did not make any changes to the recipe, used a pillsbury refrigerated crust and it turned out great. The family loved it, it wasn't too sweet which was awesome and the amount of nuts were perfect. I now have a standing request to be the official "pecan pie" person in the family. Thanks!

That pie is SO good! I followed the recipe without changing a thing, and it was perfect. One thing though: There was way too many pecans on top, I suggest to put only 1 cup, and add the rest to the filling.

This was one of the best pecan pies I have made.  I loved the honey crunch topping...it tasted like the toffee you find in candy bars.  The butter adds a nice touch not found in many other pecan pie recipes.  I'll use this recipe for pecan pies again, and am planning to throw out my old recipes.

This is by far THE BEST pecan pie I have ever tried!  The cup of chopped pecans makes the filling exquisite and the honey-coated pecan topping is delicious. This pie even impressed my aunt, who NEVER liked pecan pie because of the gooey-sweet filling. 5-stars!

I liked this recipe but not better than the original. The inside was a little thicker and had a different texture and I prefer the other. I liked the top and I think I might try the original middle with this pecan topping. I am glad I tryed this and I will probably make again with provisions.

This pie looked amazing and I loved the crunchy topping layer, but the 1st layer didn't really work out for me.  I believe it was overcooked even though I went by the directions.  I will make it again, but cook the 1st layer a little less.

This was the BEST pecan pie I have ever had. I'm not a great pie maker, but this was soooo easy and worth the time. People literally fought over the last piece. The only one I will make from now on. My husband is already begging me to make him another one!

Pecan Pie is my husband's favorite.  He loved it and so did everyone else.  I didn't need to put foil on the crust during baking -- and the crust still was a nice light brown.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  It was definitely the best pecan pie I have ever tasted and it got the thumbs up from my co-workers.  It's a keeper.

I was really excited to bite into this pie because of all the good reviews. I was disappointed however. I thought it was too rich and had way to many pecans. I think a traditional pecan pie is much better

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was excellent!  My family and I loved it!  Not only was it the best pie I've ever tasted but it was also one of the prettiest pie I've ever made.  This pie will most likely be a new tradition for our family's Thanksgivings!

I consider myself somewhat of a pecan pie expert.  I like to try many different recipes, though many are very similar, I have to say that this has to be at the top of the list.  It is one of the best tasting pies I have eaten!  I love the crunchy top!  If you are looking for a good dessert, this pie takes the cake!

If you like pecan pies that aren't too rich...this is your pie!  I didn't use a deep pie pan and so it was a little heavy.  Next time, I know exactly what to do for my own little "blue ribbon winner"!

The only thing that I found to be inconvenient with this pie is that the topping spills over the side of the pie pan when baking.  (The foil idea does not work as well as it is made to sound). As for the pie, itself, I believe this is one of the best that i have ever eaten. Everyone else agreed, as well!  Also, as another member mentioned, there were some ingredients missing from this recipe that I had to find on the Pie Counsel website.

I made this pie for book club and everyone liked it.  I made it exactly as written.  I wish that I would have read the review that said to use a 10 inch pie plate because the topping will spill over in the oven.  The crust was very easy to make and work with.  I will make this recipe again and either use a 10 inch pie plate or short the filling a little to avoid a sticky oven.

My first pecan pie since over 20 yrs. ago. Followed the recipe, excepting the  bourbon because I had none, and the result was a spectacular presentation. Loved it because was not overly sweet. Next time will decrease pecans to 1 cup for topping. Just a note: as a new bride and fledgling cook, I was afraid to make a pecan pie because I thought you had to hand-arrange the pecans on top. Thought that was too much work. How silly, they float up and arrange themselves. I've come a long way since.

Very very nice!  I made this because it made a bigger pie than my usual recipe.  I liked the consistency and the crunchy glazed top.  I did however prebake my crust just a little though.

For the record, I'm sure this pie is amazing if made by someone else. The top layer tasted amazing! The filling on the other hand...not so much. The only thing I deviated from on the recipe was using brandy instead of bourbon. The filling turned out bitter. I am willing to give this another shot though.

This was my first time ever making Pecan Pie. My husband essentially begged for it. The pie wasn't bad flavor wise. I think the crust needs to be a little better it was quite bland. I will probably try a couple others but overall flavor was good. I didn't make any changes to the recipe

This pie is delicious. However, the filling was runny and never set when I made it as directed (and I made it a lot as directed). Finally I changed it up a little. Used 1/2 cup each of brown and white sugars and 1/2 cup of corn syrup. When made like this, it sets up perfectly every time. The topping is the best part and is what makes this pie truly special.

I have made a lot of different pecan pies and this one is still my favorite.I've made it many times for Thanksgiving and everyone really loves it.The honey topping adds such a delicious flavor.I do add the bourbon to the filling which I love as well.The only thing I change is I use a deep dish frozen crust.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it didn't firm up like I wanted.  Actually, it was on the runny side...otherwise - it's great!

I just use a 9" deep dish store bought pie crust.  I have been making this every Thanksgiving/Christmas for years now.  Everyone LOVES it.  And it always turns out great.

Not only was this the best pecan pie I've tasted, but I used the crust recipe with Grandma Ople's pie recipe to make the best apple pie.  Truly awesome!

Really nice appearance, good taste and it served beautifully - but quite frankly I prefer the taste and ease of preparation of a classic pecan pie.  I personally thought that the recipe called for an excessive amount of pecans - one cup was plenty.  Thanks!

I needed more water than suggested to make the crust (about a tablespoon or 2 more).  I didn't like this crust, but the filling was awesome and got many compliments at the potluck I brought it to.  The crust was also not cooked after the first 15 minutes, so I took the filling off for the last 20 minutes of baking as well to brown it.

A bit of a late review, but I made this for Thanksgiving this past year and everyone loved it!  I was afraid it was going to be too sweet but it was perfect.  It looked beautiful and tasted very yummy!  I will definitely be making this again!

Fantastic Pecan Pie recipe!  I received many compliments on this pie at a recent Christmas party.  People wanted to know who made "the pie to die for!"  I used a premade pie crust but will definitely make the original crust recipe next time as my crust simply could not keep up with the pie!

I made this on Thanksgiving and it recieved rave reviews. It was the only desert to get completely eaten. The bourbon adds that little extra oomph that separates this recipe from a regular pie.

I've just made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I don't even have to taste it to give it five stars! It's the most beautiful Pecan Pie I've ever made! It's plump and gorgeous. I did save a smidge of the topping to taste it-really REALLY yummy! If you are still hunting for a pie recipe for Thanksgiving, don't hesitate to make this one. Very easy. I can't wait to present this tomorrow!

Wonderful Pecan Pie - It was even better the next day - I would definetly chill it before serving, it does get pretty runny when warm and I also added the bourbon for the extra kick.  Very Good!

I made this pecan pie for our family's Thanksgiving celebration and it was AWESOME!  It is loaded with pecans (the more the better).  The pecans added to the top were carmelized since they are mixed with sugar and butter before adding.  I liked this pie better than the regular pecan pie, it had a lighter flavor.  This recipe sure deserves the awards won at the Pie Championship.
BTW, I used a prepared, frozen pie crust.

After the first bite of this pie, one my male friends proposed marriage to me (unfortunately for him, I'm already hitched)! This is a great way to modify the traditional pecan pie w/out losing the pecan flavor.  I used dark corn syrup (only thing I had in the house) and it still was wonderful.

Very very good, though one HAS to be really careful not to burn the pecan topping.  I made that mistake the first time, so teh second time I added the pecan crunch topping later abd it worked out very well, one of the best pies I have had.

Absolutely fabulous pie.  I do believe it was the shot of Jim Beam that we added to make this pie truly a Southern specialty.  I used the Grandma's Pie Crust Recipe from this site, and was more than pleased with the results.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Excellent pie, but I did cheat and use a store bought crust instead of making one from scratch. The homemade crust probably would have warranted the extra star.  Made this for the boss's birthday and he loved it. He only shared with a few people in the office and took the rest home to serve for dessert that evening since he was having company.

Very good pie. A much more beautiful presentation than other pecan pies. The crust makes a little too much though...

Sarah this recipe is fantastic!!!! I decided to try it out on my boyfriend who loves old fashion pecan pie and he can't get enough of it.  I don't normally like pecan pie but your recipe has made me change my tune.  It was wonderful.  Thanks!!

This truely was the best pecan pie this woman has ever made in her whole life. My husband favorite pie is pecan. He wasnt sure about trying this one because it was different from the one I usually make. He fell inlove with it and requests it all the time! Excellent!

This is the best pie!  I baked one for Thanksgiving, and was asked to bake another one for the weekend.  I chopped the nuts for the filling really fine. The topping was beautiful and really made for a great presentation.  I think this is 'my signature pie' now.  I already have requests for Christmas! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

First of all I would like to say that I am an amateur baker, but a Pecan Pie fanatic! I chose to make this version because it had the most and highest ratings. I used a differnt crust recipe. The filling in this recipe is probably the best I have ever tasted for Pecan Pie, and yet still easy to make. However I did omit the Bourbon because I don't like the flavor of it.

This was the first pie I have ever made, and at first I was nervous it would come out too gooey. However, it turned out great and the texture was perfect. If I can make this without messing it up, then the recipe must be fool-proof!!!

I am not sure WHAT I did WRONG with this recipe, But I ended up not  having enough dough for the pie, AND it was pretty runny.I made it for my husbands work party and he CLAIMS they all loved it.He even made me write the recipe for all of them...So, I guess it was not too bad, Iwas just very disappointed in the end results..

Easy to put together, have tried it twice and the flavoring is exceptional. Just can't figure out what I am doing wrong still comes out very runny will keep working at it, cause I love the taste combination just the right flavoring to make it worth it.

This is a great pecan pie!!  The calorie count will probably scare some more health-conscious types, but for those who choose to indulge, this is perfect!!  The crust is great and I've used it on a few other pies now.

I certainly thought I did everything right but this recipe wasn't quite what I thought it would be based on the reviews.  The crust taste like shortening - not doughy pie crust - and the pie itself wasn't what I normally think of when I have pecan pie.  Maybe I'm not used to eating homemade pecan pie??

This is literally the first pie I have baked in 20 years.  I made it with my 5-year-old daughter.  We entered it into an informal pie contest among friends, and it took first place among eight entries!  What more of a testimonial can I give?

This is definately one the the best pies I have ever had. My sister and I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone just loved it. My husband wants me to make him some of the topping to to snack on. An excellent pie. I am making it again for Christmas. TRY THIS PIE!!!

This is the best pecan pie I have ever had!  My family fought over the last piece.  I have had difficulty with the tenderness of my crusts recently, but I am now sold on this crust recipe for all my pies.  My pie reputation has been saved!

My fiance is an extremely picky eater and very hard to please. He almost ate the whole pie by himself! I made it for Thanksgiving, and my parents raved about it too! I wish they would have saved me an extra piece! It was the first dessert gone.

A great pie. It was hard to wait for it to cool, but well worth the wait. Better than Mom's.

I LOVE pecan pie and am very picky about them...this one was by far the best I have ever tasted.  I made it for Christmas and my whole family LOVED it!  There weren't ANY left-overs!
