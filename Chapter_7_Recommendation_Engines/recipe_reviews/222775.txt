Very good.  Highly recommmended.  No changes needed.  I baked the chicken after using this rub and letting it sit for a bit, but grilling it would be wonderful as well.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

I wish I could do 3.5 stars for this, because I feel it was better than "ok" but I can't say I will make it often.  At least not without some changes.  Perhaps it was my preparation method.  I followed the recipe as written, although I had to omit mustard powder because I didn't have any.  I lightly coated boneless chicken breasts in olive oil and then rubbed generously with this spice mixture.  It sat in the fridge for a few hours before I baked it.  The chicken was fairly moist and the spices were pretty good, but it really felt like it needed something to help it along.  I really think this could be greatly improved by doing a yogurt marinade with these spices, or making some kind of tomato-based sauce to go over it.  I still have some of this spice mixture left over, I may try one or both of these ideas to see how it turns out.  I would also reduce the turmeric by about half as it is not my favorite flavor.

This was delicious! I had to substitute a few things I didn't have in my pantry (no garlic or onion powder, so seasoning salt and no extra salt. no dry mustard so I ground up some mustard seeds). I thought it was going to be REALLY strong from the ingredients and the smell so I didn't put it on super thick. Next time I'll be putting it on extra thick because it was surprisingly not as strong as I wanted! I also added an extra tablespoon of curry powder because this mostly smelled of cumin and I wanted it to be more curry.

The mix was average, not great. The turmeric tasted too much, I would recommend putting 1 tsp instead of two.
I tried the mix a second time, with 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. It tasted better, but was still far from great.
Will not do this recipe again

Whoa. Thank you for sharing this. It was absolutely delicious! I ended up using this rub to marinate drumsticks along with some oil and some of my favorite ketchup (Annie's brand). I let it sit for a couple hours (although letting it marinate overnight would have been even better!), then I baked it at 350F until cooked through, flipping them once halfway through (my very large drumsticks took about an hour total). It was simple and very tasty. My family loved it.

This is very good. Anyone who likes Indian spices will like it. It is a little bland, in spite of the fact that I used Madras curry powder, so the second time I made it I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne, which improved it. Next time I may add more. I omitted the onion powder, since I never use it. I also omitted the sage and fennel, used more than a pinch of ginger, and upped the dried mustard by 1/4 tsp.

Smells amazing and tastes even better then it smells. I used it on beef and it worked great as well. This will be a staple in my spice mixes for sure

Using it for chicken rub on grill.  Works great and adds nice flavor to the meat.
