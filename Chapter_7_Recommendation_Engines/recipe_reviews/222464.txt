These are delicious!  I made them for my husband's new boss who is allergic to dairy.  Problem was I wanted to eat them all myself.  I used a cookie scoop to form the balls, and this worked well.  I baked a bit longer for a crispy bottom.  Cooled on sheet a bit before transferring.  Will actually be making another batch just for us today!  BTW- His boss loved them!
