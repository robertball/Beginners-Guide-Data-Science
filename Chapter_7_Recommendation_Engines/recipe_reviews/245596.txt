Simple and delicious.
1.  Double sauce even for 1/2 amount of meatballs
2.  Didn't wait one hour to add meatballs
3.  Used 1 tsp ginger instead of Chinese 5 Spice Powder
4.  Used Heinz chili sauce in place of chili garlic sauce
5.  Cooked only 3-1/2 hours

Very good! I had some homemade mini meatballs in the freezer, so I just used those and cut the recipe down accordingly. I did only use 1/2 of the Chinese Five Spice, b/c I know it can be strong, and that was perfect for us.  Also, I used a bit less Sriracha b/c I didn't want it to be too spicy for my girls. The family really enjoyed these. I think they'd be great not only as an appetizer, but as a main dish served over rice, which is how I plan on making them next time. Thanks for sharing. :)

We are making this regularly. We also like the sauce prepared simmered on the stovetop until the sugar is dissolved, then poured over oven baked popcorn chicken. Very good!

I love this recipe and I also agree with the suggestion to make double the sauce.  I did and most of the sauce was absorbed by the meatballs.  I wondered if this was going to be too spicy and it wasn't at all so will add more chili sauce to the next batch.  I highly recommend this recipe if you are tired of making bbq meatballs and want something new.

Did it as written with home made meatballs over rice  then pasta. Good flavor, but the 5 spice goes a loooong way. Will cut it in half next time. Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good! About a couple hours in I added extra ketchup and honey because the meatballs soaked up a lot of the sauce. I put my meatballs on quinoa rice and very good!!

Delicious! Easy to make and oh so decadent. I didn't have enough ketchup, so I used some Jack Daniel's bbq sauce and it came out to rave reviews at my potluck!

I made my meatballs from scratch and made this sauce.  After my meatballs were baked and done, I added them to this sauce, simmered for about 5 minutes and it was delicious.

This was awesome! It's my go-to recipe for meatballs right now. Me and the hubby loved it! I made it exactly as written the first time and my only regret was not doubling the sauce. So that's what I did this time. I'm looking forward to dinner already and it's not even noon yet! This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Made 3 different styles of meatballs for a party, these were the favorite! I had to make a 40 minute trip to get the Chinese 5 spice, but it was worth it. I doubled the volume of the glaze for the bag of meatballs I used because I wanted it to cover them. I baked frozen meatballs first before tossing them in the crock pot and they were perfect. Didn't care for the brand of meatballs I used, but the sauce was AWESOME!

I made a double recipe of this for coffee hour after church on Christmas.  They were a big hit!  Will definitely make these again.  Love the Asian flavors.  A 4-lb. bag of meatballs fit fine in my 6-qt. slow cooker.
