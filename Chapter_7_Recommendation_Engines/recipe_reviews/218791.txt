I am re-posting my original review dated August 16, 2011:  I had a lot of fresh tomatoes that I needed to use, including some super sweet cherry tomatoes and baby romas, so I went about this a little differently. I chopped all my tomatoes and threw them in the pot including the skins, seeds and juices that had accumulated on the cutting board. I sweated them, covered, along with the onions and carrots as the recipe instructs. Then I added the chicken broth, black pepper, basil, celery salt and garlic powder and simmered, again covered, for another hour. I allowed the soup to cool somewhat and pureed it with my emersion blender right in the pot. Then I forced it through a fine sieve, discarding the skins and seeds that were left behind in the sieve. At this point I seasoned it with the sea salt, and less sugar than indicated, because some of my tomatoes were very sweet. Because I intended to freeze this I did not make the roux and add the milk. I will do that step when thawing/re-heating the soup, although I will say, it is delicious just as is. This soup is a wonderful way to highlight the taste of fresh summer tomatoes. The seasonings are perfect, enhancing the tomato flavor without overpowering it. I should note that my photo was taken before adding the roux/milk mixture. Thank you SHORECOOK, and thank your hubby for this wonderful, classic tomato soup! YUM!  Yield was 9 cups of soup.

I sauteed the onion and carrot (plus a mess of fresh minced garlic) in a little butter before adding the tomatoes and chicken broth. I did go light on the sea salt. After it cooked, I ran the soup through the blender for a smooth consistancy. This was a nice tomato soup that paired well with Italian Grilled Cheese Sandwiches--NO LEFTOVERS. Next time I think I'd use fresh basil and I would omit the celery salt and go with sea salt but really that's a personal preferance, not reflective of the recipe.

this is a very tasty soup, thanks Shorecook. I used fresh basil, celery, frozen chicken broth and 2 garlic cloves because I had them in the kitchen. I ate mine with cheese bread and the boys added mini fish crackers-everyone enjoyed it. The sugar is very important to bring out the tomatoey taste and cut some of th of the acid.

Recipe Group Selection:  17, September '11.  This was my first attempt at making homemade tomato soup.  Wow - is this a great one to start with!  The taste of the fresh tomatoes, carrots and onions totally come through with this soup.  I used fresh chicken broth instead of canned and I only had 1% milk.  Other than those 2 changes I made it as written.  I made on Sunday, refrigerated it and we had for dinner on Monday night.  Served with cheese toasties, this was the perfect meal on a cold and rainy day.  Thanks SHORECOOK for sharing your recipe.  RG made a wonderful selection this week.

I made this soup in May, 2010, before fresh tomatoes were available.  My review follows, as the recipe was unpublished at that time: Really good tomato soup, even though I had to modify by using canned tomatoes in lieu of fresh. Even the so-called tomato soup haters in my house enjoyed this soup! Thank you for sharing your recipe, Shorecook!

There’s nothing I love more than cooking with fresh ingredients, especially when they come from my own garden.  I chopped up the entire tomato, skins and all.  Once all of the vegetables had cooked, I gave them a good whirl in the blender and pureed until smooth.   My soup turned out so thick that I didn’t add any flour.  In fact, I had to thin it using tomato juice and water.  I attribute that in part to leaving the skin on and perhaps because the majority of my tomatoes were Romas.  The soup was excellent!  To complete, I topped with grilled cheese croutons and additional sandwiches on the side.

Awesome tomato soup! This is a fantastic recipe to showcase vine ripened tomatoes. I did add fresh basil and a couple cloves of minced fresh garlic also. I served this with garlic bread it was a good accompaniment. So delicious, definitely 5 star, my family just loves it, thanks for sharing your recipe Shorecook!

It's a month before Christmas here in Ontario and I took my last green beefsteak tomatoes off the vine 2 weeks ago and ripened them on the window sill.  I used all the ingredients listed but was too lazy to skin and seed them so I did what another reviewer and just chopped and boiled them with everything else.  Just before roux time, I pureed it all with an immersion blender and put it through a sieve, added my roux and spices and let it simmer for the hour.  Incredible!  Can you say comfort food?  Nice way to end the Fall season and herald in Winter.

This was the AR recipe of the week selection Sept. 17th. - I've only made tomato soup with canned tomatoes and this is my first from scratch tomato soup. I bought some really big fat plum tomatoes on sale at the market since it is past season for them in my garden. I also have never peeled a tomato so the AR article on the side bar was a great help and worked perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly except added fresh garlic and basil and used my own chicken stock. Was very good and worth the extra work of the fresh tomatoes. I'm sure Jersey would have been even better. Next year I'd like to make with my fresh garden tomatoes and freeze since my tomatoes are at peak when it is hot as blazes out...not soup weather. Thanks Shorecook for a great recipe...we all enjoyed it. Goes great with grill cheese sandwiches.
Update: We ate some leftover soup the next day for lunch...was even better the second day.

We’ve never been raging fans of tomato soup but read another reviewer saying she had never been a tomato soup fan either until making this. And then there were the rave reviews and overwhelming number of 5 star ‘loved it’ ratings. We generously give this recipe a 2* rating. Of the four people served this soup, only one finished their small bowl. All agreed of having had better homemade tomato soup. No one had any interest in having more the next day.

I honestly think this may be one of those rare recipes that you just can't mess up.  This was sooooo good!!!  Even though I had a few of those uh-oh moments, I couldn't ask for anything better.

My first "gotcha" was that substituteded canned tomatoes for fresh.  I used one 28oz petite diced and one 28 oz can crushed.  This didn't quite equal out to the 7 1/2 cups so I added another 14.5 oz petite diced.  It was just a little shy of 8 cups...  not too much over.

I followed all other instructions exactly.  Once everything was combined, I was like- this is good... but too tomatoey.  I know, its tomato soup.. but then I realized that the sub'd tomatoes was WAY more than if I had fresh.  

Off to "The Buzz" I go looking for suggestions, thanks so much to  "Sassyoldlady", "sueb", "misskitty", "manella" and "Cheryls cooking now!" for all your suggestions!  I added 1 TBS sugar, I sprinkled Basil and onion powder 2 TBS butter and about 1/4 cup milk and let simmer for a few minutes.  That fixed the flavor right up!

Once it was all done... In used my immersion blender to smooth out the bits of carrts and tomatos.  It had a texture I was accustomed to... I was thinking it should be more creamy.  The immersion blender didn't quite cut it for me and the sieve made it too liquidy.  I put it in on liquefy in the blender and voilà, it was just right.  No tiny bits of carrots or tomato and extremely creamy!  LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!

This recipe turned out to be amazing.  I had 7 or 8 medium to large roma tomatoes that I needed to use, and they were too soft for salads, but not yet beginning to rot.  I removed the seeds, but didn't bother to peel them.  I pureed the tomatoes, onions and carrots in my Ninja blender/food processor before starting them on the stove.  Otherwise I followed the recipe closely, aside from leaving out the salt and using a bit more of each spice instead.  I just heated the leftovers after they sat in the fridge over night and have to say that it may even be better the next day.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Made this for recipe group this week- I have never liked tomato soup, don't like canned and homemade always seems to taste like I'm eating pasta sauce. I want to like it though so I keep trying and this recipe finally did it for me. Good tomatoes are a rarity here so I used some really tasty ones (also on the sweet side so I left out the sugar) that we picked and canned last year  but that was the only change. I made a half batch & used a full quart of tomatoes in their juice. I drained the juice into the pot to simmer the veggies and waited to add the tomatoes after the first 30 min since they weren't fresh. I did run the immersion blender through the jar of tomatoes once since I didn't want tomato chunks but didn't process the soup as a whole.  Looking at the recipe, I also just realized that I forgot the salt, but we didn't miss it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks

I have never been a tomato soup fan until I made this.  We have a CSA Subscription with a bountiful variety of tomatoes.  I make huge portions, but they never stay around long.  I have made it with fresh basil and it's very good.  When I freeze large batches, I wait to use the flour/butter/milk addition.  I add that when I defrost.  I'd like to have a large quantity for the winter time, but unfortunately, as soon as it's seen in the freezer it mysteriously disappears!!  Also, I have made it and added a stalk of celery for extra flavor, but take it out before you blend.

I made this soup for our work "Souper Bowl" event. Glad to report that mine was the first one gone of 6 different entries. Delicious soup and so incredibly easy to make. I had 3 fresh tomatoes (it is winter after all) and used those along with home canned tomatoes and a large can of tomato sauce. Eliminated the extra salt, because I truly felt that there was enough in there already. Once everything was cooked to my satisfaction, I did use my immersion blender to make a nice and fairly smooth (left a few chunks for good measure) puree. I also did add some fresh basil along with the dry. Made it last night and warmed slowly in the crockpot at work. Gone by 12:30, it was a hit. Thanks Shorecook for another winner.

Great comfort food.  I added a couple tablespoonsful of parmesan cheese along with the milk while making the white sauce. Sprinkled chopped fresh basil over the top before serving. Deeeelish !

For those of you out there who are like me reading this recipe and thinking to yourself "Oh, Ill just use canned crushed tomato/pureed tomato because that's all I have on hand" DONT DO IT! Just go buy the fresh tomatoes! And while you're at it go pick up a pint of heavy cream. The roux with milk was a disaster every time I re-made it and came out chunky in my soup (ew). Looks aside, the flavor was halfway decent. Thick and slightly chunky tomato soup spiced up with chilli powder and a couple dashes of Franks Red Hot sauce in addition to the above seasonings. Made an OK bowl of tomato soup to be paired with my grilled cheese sandwich for tonight's dinner. Any remaining soup will be tossed.

Very good soup, but more of a vegetable flavor than tomato.  

I used a immersable blender to make the soup creamy and didn't need to cook it for the extra hour.  It was ready within 10 minutes of adding milk.

Made Sept. 20th, 2011 - This is an  awesome, solid 5+ star Fresh Tomato Soup!  The only changes I made were: Because our garden tomatoes are gone, I used homegrown tomatoes which had been frozen for two weeks, fresh chicken broth, added an additional 1/4 teaspoon of garlic and sprinkled cheddar cheese on each serving.  I'll never want to open another can of bought tomato soup.  Shorecook - you have a winner!  Thanks for sharing!

Once again Shorecook dazzles us with her culinary expertise.  This soup is wonderful.  The garden freshness of the tomatoes shines through perfectly, the seasoning well balanced.   I didn’t have celery salt so I substituted a stalk of celery and used 1% milk because that is what I had.   I also used my immersion blender for a smoother texture.    We all loved it.

Tomato soup is just OK and I would prefer to not eat it-- but THIS tomato soup I would sneak away alone and eat  all of it myself!  BTW, husband loved it too as I did share and am now giving your recipe to those in our community garden as we wait for the tomatoes to get ripe.  Hope to be able to freeze plenty this year.  Thank you for this recipe.

Wow, this was a really delicious recipe. I didn't really change much at all except I used 1% milk instead. I also can't stand blanching and peeling tomatoes because it is so time consuming, so I just sliced them all up and threw them in the pot and then once everything was stewed, I blended in the blender, then strained in the strainer... it removed the pulp, skins and seeds and made the soup nice and smooth. Then I added the chicken broth, sugar etc. I usually add way more herbs, but I decided to keep it simple to enjoy the taste of the garden fresh tomatoes. I added a bit of cayenne and chili flakes, but that's my personal preference. The soup that resulted was the best tomato soup I have ever eaten. The consistency was to die for. I am making it again tonight because I have another huge batch of ripe tomatoes I need to use! Thanks for the recipe!

This is pretty good but not quite as flavorful as I expected. But I fixed it, at least to my taste, by adding about 2 Tbsp of beef "Better than Bullion" and a Tsp of smoked paprika. That put it over the top.

LOVE this soup! Tastes awesome, however, it was more work than I had anticipated. It took about an hour to peel and chop the tomatoes, plus the stated hour and a half prep & cook time. Next time I'll make a bigger batch and freeze the leftovers so it's not so much work every time we want this tasty soup.

Made this September 11, 2011 before it was published (or at least before I realized it was). Excellent! This is a great way to use up alot of tomatoes from my garden and fortunately i have the privlage of being able to use Jersey tomatoes. I made this with only a few minor changes. I used homemade chicken broth instead of canned, fresh basil and 1 clove of fresh minced garlic. My only question is how did you keep yours in the picture so red mine turned orange when I added the milk? Thanks Shorecook! This is a definate keeper!

I followed the recipe as written. The flavor was good however I didn't like the use of the flour roux to thicken - it interfered with the fresh taste of the tomatoes.

I followed the suggestion of some reviewers and didn't seed nor peel the tomatoes.  I blended them afterwards and it saved a lot of time as it was already thick so no need to simmer for one hour.  I also used fresh celery instead of celery salt.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  I will NEVER buy canned tomato soup ever again!

This is a tasty and fresh soup. I received a bunch of tomatoes from a friend's garden that were perfect for this recipe. I wasn't sure how I would feel about the carrots but they added the perfect amount of sweetness to balance the acidity of the tomatoes. I was lazy and didn't peel the tomatoes but my immersion blender took care of the peels.

Insanely good.   I didn't change the ingredients but the order of cooking.   I sauteed the onion and carrot in the butter/olive oil...About 1T of each.   When soft I added 2T of flour cooked for about a minute.  Added the chicken stock then tomatoes all the spices.  I used tomatoes from my garden so I only used 1tsp of sugar and that was plenty you will need to adj that amt based on the sweetness of your tomatoes.   Cooked for 35 min, let cool for a few min added 1 cup FF half and half then used the emersion blender until smooth.   Super super good.

I rated it as a 5 star for a vegetable soup, but if you're looking for a traditional tomato soup (like grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup) than this isn't quite it. As for the soup itself it was very yummy. We only use almond milk at our house and it still came out great. Made everything else exactly as directed.

Easy to make and absolutely delicious!  The tomatoes are truly the star of this soup.  I used the new immersion blender I received for Christmas and the texture was smooth as can be.

I used a 28oz can crushed tomatoes (sorry, it's almost December), and halved the rest of the ingredients.  I ran almost everything through the food processor, then cooked it.  And to save on dishes, I melted the butter in the microwave, mixed the flour in, then threw that all in the food processor with the milk.  I added it directly to the hot tomato base without cooking it first and it was fine.  It made plenty for 3 adults and everyone loved it. I added tuna melts on the side and it made a great and simple weeknight meal.

Love this recipe! I have been searching for a recipe that is similar to our local cafe and this is it. A few changes were made: No need to peel or seed tomatoes.  After cooking tomatoes, carrots and onions, process them in a food processor and proceeded with the recipe. it was perfect!

Who needs canned stuff when you've got this? I'm not too close to New Jersey so I used local tomatoes ;-) This hit the spot with some grilled cheese sandwiches to let this misplaced girl feel at home again. Thank you Shorecook for your recipe!

I skipped the peeling and seeding.  I put the tomatoes, carrots and used fresh garlic instead of powdered in my Vitamix.  My first time making fresh tomato soup.  Excellent.  Thinking next time I'm going to make it with coconut milk and coconut half and half for a richer version.  Would love to have garden fresh tomatoes year round.

This was a bit more labor intensive because I used frozen cherry tomatoes from my garden but the results were delicious. The only actual ingredients that I changed was to add a dash of liquid smoke to it and I think it made the flavor a lot richer and a little more complex. Excellent recipe. I will use this again with my frozen garden tomatoes.

Though I haven't made too many fresh tomato soups, this one was certainly the best out of any I had tried.  It was delicious, creamy, and sweet.  I doubled the recipe and had plenty to share with others who also loved it.  The only change I made was substituting the chicken broth with vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  Highly recommend this recipe!

I've made this many times, and have frozen it also when making big batches.  All I can say is, its wonderful.  I generally use whole milk and ground celery seed in mine, just because that is what I have on hand all the time, without any notable difference in flavor.

My husband and I made this last night. First, if you have a vitamix or something similiar you wont need to peel and deseed the tomatoes. We just used the vitamix to liquify them, I cooked the carrot, garlic, and onion then threw them in with the tomatoes, made sure everything had a smooth texture then started cooking everything. The only thing I would suggest is waiting until it's simmered a little while to do most of the seasoning. The longer it simmered the more flavor we got- it ended up being a little spicy from my heavy pepper hand but we still like it, and I will make it again.

This is excellent tomato soup. I saved this recipe this past summer while we were putting up our very large supply of tomatoes from our garden. I couldn't wait to make it. Well, tonight was the night. The only change I made was to use Lactose Free Whole Milk. Best creamy tomato soup ever! Thanks Shorecook! BTW, I love that there's carrot in it.

This was so much better than anything that comes from a can!
Instead of peeling, seeding, and chopping my tomatoes, I put them into the blender and made a tomato purée.  I used 2 cups of homemade chicken broth (instead of canned), left out the sugar and used about 2 Tbsp of butter, maybe a little less.
This soup was delicious, probably my new favourite homemade tomato soup.

What a delicious tomato soup! I used our own tomatoes from our garden and it was a big hit for the whole family! I didn't change anything about it...Thanks Shorecook!

Good soup but the onions were too strong for  me. Maybe I will cut down to 1/2 cup next time I try this recipe.

Recipe Groupe selection 9/17/11. Being basically lazy, I just rough cut my tomatoes peels and all and added them to the pot with the onion and carrots, which I had grated in the food processor.  I omitted the sugar because I felt the carrots would add the needed sweetness and added celery seed instead of celery salt.  When this mixture had cooked down I put it back in the food processor until it was almost pureed.  I didn't strain it at all because it was too thick.  I didn't think it needed any salt but I added a healthy amount of fresh ground pepper and fresh basil and just a pinch of dry thyme and the garlic powder.  It turned out so rich and satisfying we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will be hitting the farmers market again this week and if I can score another batch of ripe tomatoes, I'll make the base and freeze it for use on a cold winter night.  Thanks, Shorecook, this is another simple but yummy classic.

This soup was so good and so much better than canned. The best part...it's delicious and really isn't hard to make! I roasted the tomatoes in the oven for about 10 minutes (broil) to allow for easy removal of tomato skins. Also, I used fresh basil instead of dried since that's what I had on hand. I used an immersion blender for a smooth texture. Other than the fresh basil, I made the recipe as written. Don't think I'll ever be able to buy canned tomato soup again in this house! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe Shorecook!

It was really great, although more time consuming than anticipated. I did not choose to put carrot or onion in, but everything else was followed as written.  It had a hard time getting my tomatoes seedless. I strained and saved the juice out first in a small mesh strainer. Then I strained the rest of the mixture in a colander to get the seeds to fall out but retain the tomato pieces. It worked reasonably well. The few seeds that remained did not affect the overall taste.  I am also posting a picture: I may have added too much milk because its more bisque-like. But it was still tomatoey and delicious.

I made this today, and I love it! I doubled the recipe to make 4 pint jars full.  The flavor is wonderful. I used tomatoes and carrots from my garden, and as some other people suggested, I added a bit of minced green pepper (also from the garden).

My only comment is that it took longer for the carrot to get soft, so I cooked it for an hour instead of a half hour.

The result is a delicious, flavorful soup.

This was pretty good. It reminded me a bit of the creamy tomato soup I have at a restaurant. I thought it was a bit heavy on the dried basil and black pepper, but otherwise the flavor was great. I didn't have celery salt, so I added a stalk of celery with the veggies. Personally, I thought the finely chopped carrots added an odd texture, and thought I should have pureed them instead. However, DH liked the texture. One thing is that I only got most of the tomato seeds removed. I didn't like having the few seeds that were in the soup, but that's my fault. Overall, it was a nice recipe, which I expected from Shorecook, and I'm sure we'll try it again.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit in my household. Fresh ingredients make a big difference. I sub the celery salt and garlic powder for the real thing - 2-3 stalks of celery and garlic to taste (at least 6 cloves in my kitchen). Last time, I ran out of tomatoes around 5 1/2 cups, so I replaced the rest with some broccoli. This was a surprisingly wonderful addition! Going forward, I don't think I'll ever forget to have a bunch of broccoli on hand for this one.

I tried this recipe earlier today.  I'm getting over the flu and was craving a hearty soup.  I decided to make this recipe and it came out great.  I ended up blending it afterwards for a creamy and smooth consistency.

I thought this was really good!  I made it with almond milk instead of milk (we don't do milk) and veggie broth, and it was delicious!  For the basil, I picked basil from our garden, and the tomatoes were from our garden as well.

For anyone that needs to use tomatoes from the garden, this is the best recipe I have come across.

First off, put whatever tomatoes you have in, do not have to be all the way ripe, can be soft, etc..  They all get pureed together, skin and all, I do squeeze out the seeds.  I put 3-4 carrots in for color and sweetness vs the sugar.  I also put in several fresh basil vs dried.

I have made this recipe 3 times this week, in batches for freezing, as perfect for the winter months and easy take to work lunch.

If you have the tomatoes, play with several batches to get where you like it.  This can be more of a bisque then soup, which is perfect for Dinner guests.  I do not not cook down the tomatoes as  long as stated in recipe, as I like to keep as many nutrients in a dish as possible.  I leave skin on, core and stem and just tear the pieces after I remove the seeds.  Make it easy.  Then once cooked down for abotu 10-15 minutes I blend the carrots, onion, garlic cloves and tomatoes together to a puree.  Then proceed to the milk/flour step.  Once reduced>>>PERFECT!

Excellent!  I don't usueally follow a reciepe for soup but I did for this one. Well almost.  To make it easier to skin the tomatoes I qauartered them taking out the stems, put in a pot and cooked them down.  I then put it through a food mill keepping the skins and the seeds back. I then measured the tomatoes and contingued with the reciepe.  It was great.

This has a good flavor. One thing I would absolutely do differently next time is to boil my onions and carrots for awhile because 30 minutes was not enough to fully cook my diced baby carrots, so even with an immersion blender there are tiny quite crisp bits in my soup, which I do not care for. I served this soup with AR's "Elvis Sandwich" but I think in the future I would just add the bacon on top of this soup and skip the rest of the side sandwich. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made this for the Recipe Group and it was delicious!  I was only making this for myself so I basically just eyeballed the ingredients.  I used some tomatoes I had peeled chopped and froze from my garden this last spring.  Loved the addition of the carrot, which I've never had in tomato soup.  Mine only needed about 25 minutes to thicken since I cut it back so much.  Wonderful tomato soup ;)

yep!  A winner for sure!  I had almost enough fresh tomatoes but had to open one can of chopped.  Instead of using 2% milk I used heavy cream.  Actually I don't even like tomato soup but I had never had any kind but canned. Now I can say I like tomato soup.  I used my brand new immersion blender to make this really smooth.  Definitely will make this again!

My friend introduced me to this awesome recipe. When I said I just had to have that recipe she told me it was on All Recipes. Best tomato soup EVER and I typically don't care for soup. Used canned tomatoes because they aren't in season now, not to mention it's super easy using canned tomatoes.

Loved this!!!  I needed a soup recipe for a lady at church that had all her teeth pulled out and I tried this recipe.  Oh boy, not sure the soup will make it to the lady's house! Very yummy!!  I used roma tomatos and I could have left the rue out because it was already very thick.  I also added a little velveeta cheese- sooo yummy! Will make this summer with all the tomatoes my dad plants!! Can't wait for them to try it.

This was so GOOD! Substitutions I made, three cans of petite diced tomatoes (since it is off-season and tomatoes are expensive), 1/2 tsp extra basil, and vegetable stock in place of the chicken broth to accommodate a vegetarian diet. I was scared the canned tomatoes would ruin the soup but it was wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great! I only have one critique which may be on my part. It takes MUCH longer than 2 hours to cook this dish. The first time I made this tomato soup it took 3 1/2 hours. The part that takes the longest is peeling and seeding a tomato. I stood at my counter for two hours peeling seeding and chopping tomatoes, but hey, maybe it's just me. Also I thought 8 cups of tomatoes would be around 15 tomatoes. I was wrong; I would have need over 50 tomatoes for this! So I was short on the serving size and had to cut it down to one serving which still made a lot. A part from my tomato struggle it was the best soup I have ever had in my life, everyone loved it!

YUMMY!!!! I did modify some. I sauteed the onion, garlic, carrot, and fresh basil in butter. I then added a 1/2 quart of chicken broth, along with sea salt and pepper. I used 2- 28oz. of Dei Fratelli tomatoes (stewed) after adding tomatoes and heating I added the milk along with corn starch. Soooooo GOOD!

This was a delicious way to use tomatoes out of the garden. We froze the soup to eat on a cold winter day without the milk as a review suggested. We made it the other day and added the milk when we had heated the soup. My only suggestion is to freeze in smaller batches if you are only feeding a couple people at a time.

My version.
Used roughly 9-10 tomatoes, put in the food processor with my celery and carrots. I left the seeds in it. My husband doesn't mind. Added fresh basil, thyme and parsley. Celery seed instead of celery salt. I omitted salt completely since I added 1 32oz carton of campells soups torilla soup. With the extra liquid I had to use more butter and flour.

The base of this recipe is definitely on the road to perfectly delicious, but my outcome was way too salty.  Perhaps due to the combination of chicken stock, celery salt, and salt, I would recommend ommitting and simply adding at the end to taste.  My result will be eaten b/c it is truly a delicious soup, but overshadowed by a ridicious amount of saltiness.

This soup is fantastic!  The only change I made was to use celery seed and garlic salt instead of celery salt and garlic powder because that is what I had.  Best tomato soup I ever had.  It took longer to prep because I used smallish tomatoes.

It was good and fresh.  Next time I make it, though, I'm going to totally blend the tomatoes and onions in my Cuisinart.  Needed to be a smoother texture than it was.

WOOOHOOO!!! Score! I am going the vegetarian route and this soup just looked so good I had to try it. I did modify a bit hoping it would turn out and it sure did!!!! I chopped up two large carrots and 1 good-sized onion. I boiled all that in 2 cups of chicken broth for half an hour and then blended it totally in my Vitamix. I then poured it back into my soup pot and added 2 cans (15 oz each) of tomato sauce-a Sams club oops that I've been trying to use for the last 6 months!!! I added 1.5 c of homemade almond milk (not sweet like the store-bought kind) and added the seasonings, leaving out the salt, sugar, butter and flour. WOW!!! I am going to make this again, doubling the batch for freezing (leaving out the almond milk) because it is awesome and will make such a beautiful quick meal when I need it!!!!

This was my first attempt at tomato soup.  Great recipe--very fresh tasting!  I will definitely make this again. I used beefsteak tomatoes, and followed the recipe pretty much.  I ended up with about 8c of tomatoes.  I did put fresh garlic in with step 1, used low sodium/fat free broth, skim milk, omitted the sugar and used celery seed (doesn't need more salt) and fresh basil toward the end.  It was delicious.  It makes quite a bit of soup. Prior to step 2 I put it in the blender and pulsed for a minute or two--not too much as I prefer my soups to be somewhat textured (for lack of a better word) or chunky.

I did blend it after it was done and it had great flavor. It could have used a bit less salt after all was said and done, maybe it's because I didn't use reduced sodium broth. I also used canned tomatoes with a bit of the liquid drained and it was the right consistency. I will definitely make this again, it's got such a full flavor and even though the ingredients are simple, it doesn't need anything else.

This soup is delicious!  My 3 year old kept asking for more - and he *thinks* he doesn't even like tomatoes! I use whatever milk I have on hand and I cut down on the salt because I am sensitive to it.  I also use fresh basil instead of dry.  I have been looking for a tomato soup recipe that doesn't taste like spaghetti sauce for so long, now I've found it!

I made this recipe tonight but made two substitutions along the way. First, I used two 28oz cans of diced tomatoes because fresh tomatoes in February taste more like wooden table decorations. Next, since I didn't have any celery salt I used celery seed instead.   
Before adding the rue to the tomato mixture, I used an emersion blender to purée the mix. 
This was by far THE BEST SOUP I'VE EVER HAD!  Great recipe and so easy to make.

Very Awesome soup!  The only two things I would change are these:
1- Roasted red pepper added to this is excellent.
2- Using fresh or even canned tomatoes is fine, but I like a smoother consistency in my soups, so I chose to puree it.

Loved it. I did use 5 cans of diced tomatoes and fat free milk since that's what I had on hand, and 2 tbsp frozen basil from last fall's harvest. At the end I transferred it to the blender in small (2-3 cup) batches and got a nice smooth puree out of it.

This soup was fantastic.  I made some adjustments as follows: I used about 4 cups of tomatoes, 3/4 cup carrots, 3/4 cup of onions, 1 cup of chicken broth, 1 1/2 tb of pure sucuant, couple twists of salt, 3 tb of butter, 1 cup of 1% milk, 3tb of whole wheat flour, shakes of dried basil, shakes of black pepper, shakes of garlic powder and garlic salt. I needed to get rid of some other vegetables, so I added fresh spinach and a handful of cilantro in it.  This cooked faster because I used less tomatoes, it was awesome!!! I will def cook this again.

Yum! This recipe is so yummy and easy. I only made it because my husband wanted homemade tomato soup but I loved it too! We followed the recipe almost exactly but our toms were pureed and frozen and we didn't use carrots. It was delicious the second and third day too. This recipe is a keeper, thanks shorecook!

In a word…this is spectacular!  Hearty and flavorful.   I will admit that I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand  during February in Minnesota.  However, my daughter wanted grilled cheese and homemade tomato soup for the Super Bowl game so I had to improvise.  I used (3) 28 oz cans of crushed San Marzano tomatoes in lieu of fresh.  Otherwise I made just as stated.  I can't wait to try when fresh tomatoes are in season here and will be sure to can extra this summer so I have some on hand during the winter season.  Thank you for sharing!  This was wonderful!

This soup is wonderful!  I make it often for my husband with a couple changes because of dietary restrictions.  I use chicken broth instead of milk (he cannot have dairy) and use buckwheat flour (he cannot have wheat) for the final ingredients. I use Land O Lakes butter with olive oil ..that little bit of dairy doesn't bother him.  He loves the soup!

I make some to eat and some to freeze. I use the blender to chop tomatoes . I use whole milk. It is really good. Sometimes I double the recipe because I have so many tomatoes in the summer. Love it.

This was an interesting twist to tomato soup. I'm a former Jersey girl. Though my soup didn't have any red coloring--maybe due to needing more milk or tomatoes--it tasted good. I've used one cup of tomatoes and use iodized salt, since I didn't have any celery salt (it's too expensive to buy).  I've paired it with grilled cheese with tasted well. I would love to make it again.

Delicious! We added 1 T ketsup and 1/2T more sugar. Great with a grilled cheese sandwich.

Did as someone suggested and cooked tomatoes with skins and seeds and then strained after I blended it. Was perfect, no thickening needed. Totally awesome soup.

I added finely chopped zucchini that was in season, otherwise followed the recipe. Lovely flavor and consistency. To make gluten free version, use 3 tbsp cornstarch mixed with a couple  tbsp milk to thicken.

This is the best tomato soup recipe I have ever tried. I used fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden. I also added some finely chopped celery in addition to the carrots and onion. A sprinkle of parmesan cheese was a wonderful garnish. Thank you for sharing!

Everyone gobbled it up. They had choices of topping it with either cheddar, mozzarella or parmesan cheese, or any combination thereof. I did add a shake of cayenne pepper for a bit of a bite.

I mixed it up a bit. Replaced green bell pepper for carrots and sauted, onion, pepper and chopped garlic before adding to soup.  I also think 1/2 t. was a bit much for the black pepper.

However, overall it was great and I will definitely make again.

Only difference was I sauteed finely chopped onion, celery, carrots in butter;  used 4 cups homemade pureed tomatoes, 1 heaping tablespoon sugar, 1 cup chicken stock, 1tsp. Basil, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, regular salt, garlic. Simmered in low for 1 hour. Added 1 can evaporated milk. I didn't thicken or puree soup as I like it  a little chunky.

I used canned peeled diced tomatoes. It was yummy. My friends loved it; my husband and I thought that not only was it the best tomato soup we've ever eaten, it was also the best soup I've ever made. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great recipe when you have lots of garden fresh  tomatoes.
I changed nothing and everyone in my family loved it.
Serve with grill ham & cheese, it is simply delicious and so very simple to make.

For the person that only gave this 2 stars you may not have had good quality tomatoes. We make this all the time with our own home grown plum tomatoes. It is outstanding and deserves 10 stars or more. We make it exactly as written. 
We do put it in the Vitamix to make it a cream soup but that is all we do different

Perfect autumn soup.  My modifications: fresh basil, cut back on sea salt to one tsp, peeled but did not seed tomatoes, and used better than bouillon chicken flavor.  Used a combo of fresh and canned tomatoes.  Yum!!!

A delicious recipe- thanks for sharing! It was a great way to use up all of those end-of-summer tomatoes. Since my tomatoes were already over-ripe/sweet, I left out the sugar in the recipe. I  also substituted granulated garlic and celery seed for the powdered garlic & celery salt, since that is what I had on hand. After cooking it down, I pureed the soup with a immersion blender and then pressed it through a fine mesh strainer, as I missed the note about seeding the tomatoes to start. After demolishing the first batch, I made another two to freeze for later this winter. I'm following another reviewer's advice to add the roux when I thaw.  Fingers crossed it is just as tasty from the freezer!

My husband has told me for years that he did not like tomato soup, yet he ate to bowls!  I however oven roasted the tomatoes, onions and garlic, along with caramelized onions carrots and celery. I also added a little basil pesto. I topped each bowl with a little mozzarella cheese, croutons and fresh basil.  Can't wait to have more tomatoes from our garden to make again!

So easy and loved that it was low-fat.  Most call for heavy cream.  Great way to use up the abundance of tomatoes in the fall.

Excellent taste and texture.  The only change is that I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and I used cashew milk instead of milk.  Will prepare base and freeze for easy dinners during the winter.

The things I did differently barely count as changes, using fresh garlic and basil instead of powder and dried. I also pureed the soup in the blender, prior to adding the thickener, preferring a smoother soup. The whole family loves it!

I followed the recipe as listed with the exception of using whole milk (I already had it in the fridge) and it turned out great! I especially loved the chunkiness of the soup. Will do again for another windy day. :)

Super easy and super yummy! Only thing I would suggest would be to pulverize the tomatoes if you want it to be creamier, if you like chunky tomato sauce then leave as is!

I did not peel and remove the seeds of the tomatoes.  Once finished cooking I put everything in a blender .  The soup was great.  I used a combo of 1% and whole cream in place of 2% milk.  I also used some tomato juice to thin the soup a little.  Highly recommend.

Used fresh basil leaves (3 finely chopped),1 clove garlic and 1 celery stalk-chopped and added with onion. Used an immersion blender before adding milk/flour thickening.

I did not make the roux, but instead thickened it with 1/2 cup mashed potatoes to keep it dairy free. I did not seed the tomatoes , but used an immersion blender to blend the tomatoes, and then strained out the skin and seeds - a lot less work.
Used vegetable broth to keep this vegetarian.

Though I didn't get to use every ingredient, (no carrots) it still came up very good. My neighbor liked it and asked for seconds. So this is a great recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! My husband went back for seconds, and we will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe, but instead of one cup of carrots, I did 1/2 cup carrots and 1/2 cup celery. I also added a quarter teaspoon of onion powder based on some other reviews. Thank you for sharing, this one is great!!

The first time I made this soup I used roma tomatoes and orange grape tomatoes. It made the color different, and really sweet, so I did not add sugar. Love the chunky texture better. I did add some basmati rice and rainbow chard. Soooo yummy with some cheesy biscuits.  

I am making it again today, and adding a lot more veggies, the last of my corn, green beans, gypsy peppers, zucchini, and chard. And I'm using the BIG pot, gonna want to put some away for later.

This was both easy and delicious. I blended out the soup once it was cooked to get a smoother soup but besides that, followed the recipe exactly. Both my parents and my brother were nicely impressed.

This soup is the best way to use up tomatoes from the garden. It's alot of work to peel and seed the tomatoes, but well worth it! I've actually made this several times. It's just the first time I've reviewed it. It's a family favorite for sure!

Used the garden tomatoes that were everywhere in the kitchen.  doubled the recipe, used half as much basil as I used dry, and skim milk with a little half and half and powdered garlic..  Both my husband and I loved the taste, it was mild and sweet but still a bit tangy.  Used the immersion blender after cooking the tomatoes and again after adding the roux.

I also added a few things. I wanted my tomato soup to be more substantial and go further (I froze some for a lazy day), so I added 32 oz of tomato juice along with celery, carrots, squash, additional fresh minced garlic, and a literal bunch green onions. I used "Cento San Marzano Organic Peeled Tomatoes, 28 Ounce" in place of the recommended peeled tomatoes.

I don't know where my other review went, so I'll do it again. I had homegrown cherry tomatoes. I omitted the celery salt. I did not add fresh garlic. I don't think there really is a need. I did use fresh basil it came out fantastic. I don't eat bread, but with a nice grilled cheese sandwich, regular or gourmet, it would be awesome.  I think I would add fresh celery and maybe cream to turn it into cream of tomato soup. Also, I am not a tomato soup fan.

I followed the recipe except blended the tomatoes, etc., for a smoother soup.  Even though I am not a tomato soup lover, I really enjoyed this meal and plan on making it again.  My husband, who likes tomato soup, loved the recipe and only recommended that the carrots be removed.

It is a cold winters day and this was a hit.  I am off of meat products for a short time so did not add chicken broth.  I put in a tablespoon of horseradish and two bay leafs.  I used canned tomato juice and canned tomato chunks from last summers garden.  Rather than blending it, I served it with vegetables in spoon size pieces.

Wife and I made this recipe to spec. The only thing I would change would be to maybe pre boil the carrots some or some other method to soften them up. There were still a bit hard. Other than that.... easily the best tomato soup I have had.

Truly one of the best things I've made in a long time. My sister-in-law said it tasted like something you'd get in a nice restaurant.  Will definitely make it again. A keeper.

I didn't exactly see the point of cooking the tomatoes, carrots, and onions first, so just added the broth and seasonings at the beginning and simmered for about an hour.  Slightly pureed with a hand blender and thickened with milk/cream and cornstarch, and a little cream cheese.  Very yummy!

This was great , I went by some suggestions here such as sauteing the onion  first.  I did not use carrots.  And no sea salt.

I will make it again, it was great.  I used 2T of butter and sauteed the onion and carrots.  I used home made chicken broth, no flour or milk.  Small bits of bread as a thickener, and added one clove garlic.  It was tomato season, so the fresh tomatoes were excellent and flavorful

I got a little carried away with the tomatos this summer and then it rained over and over, so lots of moisture and heat gave me a bumper crop the likes of which I have never seen before!  I put up abut 50 Pt. jars of "Baking Sauce"  (like spaghetti sauce but more versatile), 10 Qt jars of salsa. Now, this wonderful soup which is so good.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly but used my hand blender to puree half of it, still leaving half of it chunky. We'll add fresh basil as we use the soup....have a lot of that too!  
Thank you "Shorecook" for posting this.

Amazing. I think it must be the carrot that makes it so good. I am a vegetarian and used veggie stock.  Also I did not add salt as between the stock and the celery salt it is plenty salty enough.

I made this last night after sitting in the freezing rain at my son's baseball game.  Since it was on a whim, I only had canned plum tomatoes.  I used two-28 oz. cans and otherwise followed the recipe closely (only subbing celery seed for salt and fresh basil for dried).  SO much better than canned soup!  I made some parmesan crisps to go along with this.  Looking forward to making this soup with fresh tomatoes.

So tasty! This recipe inspired me to make from-scratch spaghetti sauce this weekend. There were no leftovers for our tomato soup and grilled cheese lunch. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am a vegetarian and made this soup using unsweetened almond milk and vegetable broth. It was very good and my two boys both liked it. I thought it was a little sweet and if I make it again, I will omit the sugar.

This was delicious! I ommitted carrots (don't like, didn't have) but followed thr recipe closely except for that.  Maybe aseasoned it up a bit more but the basic recipe is a 5-star for sure!

Awesome! Made a couple of small changes. Sauteed the onion and some garlic before adding tomatoes. Left out the garlic powder and celery salt, but added fresh rosemary. Wonderful.

I've only ever had canned tomato soup.  This was my first attempt at making it from scratch and I must say it was the best tomato soup I have ever had.
