I'm very sad to tell you this recipe flopped.  My starter has worked for me really well, so I don't think it's the starter.  Recipe called for baking cake 30-35 minutes.  I baked it 35 minutes, put a knife in the center, it came out doughy, so I baked it 10 more minutes.  I checked the center of cake with knife again, it came out doughy, so I put it back to bake for another 10 minutes.  It was getting late by that time, so when I finally took the cake out of the oven after at least 55 minutes, I set it to cool on counter.  The cake fell as it cooled.  I spread it with homemade cranberry sauce and sent it to church the next day.  People usually eat all of the goodies I bake for after church - not this time.  I tasted it too.  The taste was not horrible; it just was NOT the consistency of cake.  It looked like fudge when cut.  This recipe needs to be reworked, or perhaps something has accidentally been left out.  Usually, all recipes I try on this site get 3 - 5 stars - not this one. :o(

This cake has made my family adicted to it. First of all when they were hungry I was offering them this cake because everyday they eat the same thing and are picky picky children. Suddenly they tried it and said "I will eat this cake until I die." From that day onwaards we all ate they same things!

Have baked this recipe twice for my wife's co-workers and they still want more.  It's a great icebreaker and a great recipe.  I top mine with a thick layer of chocolate icing and let the calories fall where they may.

Made cranberry sauce to control sweetness--added lemon and orange zest to brighten it up.  I made the 2-layer version (changed white sugar to dark brown), frosted the top of each layer with buttercream and lapped the cranberry over the frosting on each layer (that is, the sides were bare so guests could see the beautiful colors: chocolate cake, white frosting, crimson cranberries; repeat).  GORGEOUS!  got many raves for looks and for taste, but personally thought it was too rich.  Cream cheese frosting next time??? Great way to use my Herman for festive occasions. THANKS!

Very moist cake, needs to be stored in the refrigerator. Baking time should read 45 minutes.  Good flavor!

This did not turn out at all. I went to a local bakery to get the sourdough starter so I know the starter was ok, but the mixtrure never got "bubbly." I cooked it anyway in 2 pans. I added extra flower to one and it was a little better, but the cake was still too wet and a little too sweet. It looked kind of like pudding!
