Wowzer!! This recipe will knock your socks off! 

I've been looking for a recipe that re-creates the delicious Tex-Mex borracho beans I find in South Tx restaurants. Eureka! I've found it.

The only changes I made to this recipe were cooking in a crockpot all day, and using one minced fresh jalapeno instead of pickled jalapeno. I soaked the beans overnight, then placed all ingredients in crockpot early in the morning and cooked all day. Fabulous! Mouth-watering aroma and rich, full flavor. Oh, and I also used a little fresh oregano from my garden instead of dried.

This recipe was very hot and spicy using one jalapeno. My family likes spicy food so it was great for us, but if you prefer milder flavors you might want to leave out or reduce the jalapeno.

Absolutely wonderful. Thanks, Kiki!

Fabulous flavor! I did not soak my beans and they cooked in approx. the given time. Beans that are old will take much longer to cook. If you don't live in a "bean eat'n state" like Texas, try to get your beans at a local Mexican grocery where you KNOW the stock will be freshest. Also, if you need to add water while the beans are cooking, make sure to add BOILING water. It's not going to help the cooking time to add cold water and drop the cooking temperature!  I always have a tea kettle of hot water going on the range when I cook ANY beans. I used Pacifico beer (a beer similar to Corona) because that's what was in the fridge. In fact, that's what's ALWAYS in the fridge! hahaha. (Make sure to bring the beans back up to a boil quickly when you add the beer, tomatoes, etc. and then drop the pot back down to a simmer.) My only modification was a large jalepeno, diced and a about 4 tablespoons of Goya Liquid Sazon (If you read most of my reviews you'll find that Sazon finds it's way into most everything!)If you can't find the liquid Sazon, most large grocery chains sell the packets... try it out! (I usually use one packet per cup of dry beans in a recipe.) I'm going to serve it over cooked, crumbled chorizo and top it with queso asadero and put it under the broiler until the cheese is melted.  Just scoop it up with some tostaditas and you have a meal..or an appetizer! Thanks, Kiki for a great recipe.... your abuela is smiling!

WOW. IF I COULD RATE THIS A 10 I WOULD. I AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHER RATERS. THIS IS A GREAT DISH.I LIVE IN THE SOUTH (BIRMINGHAM) AND NEEDED SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT MADE WITH SALT PORK OR HAM FEET OR WHATEVER.  DID NOT HAVE BEER TOO. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. I DID HALF THE AMOUNT OF PEPPERS. AND ONLY HAD HALF OF THE CILENTRO. BUT TURNED OUT WONDERFUL. AND PUT A GREAT SMELL THRU THE HOUSE ALL DAY. WILL MAKE THESE BEANS AGAIN AND AGAIN. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE. I HOPE YOU HAVE MORE RECIPES LIKE THIS TO OFFER.

I've made this twice and I have made 2 changes to suit my tastes.  I used 2 fresh jalapenos, seeded and chopped and I didn't care for the flavor of the dark beer last time so this time I used a Corona.  Served with smoked beef brisket, oven fried red potatoes, rolls & fruit salad. A Labor Day feast. Delicious!

Delicious!! Had no beer, but was still great without it. I fixed this the day after Christmas and added a leftover ham bone. The red and green from the tomatoes and fresh cilantro gave this dish a festive look. Don't cut back on the garlic. Six cloves seems extreme but this dish can handle it.

I'm sorry, but I really was disappointed in this.  It wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it would be, and even though I cooked the recommended time (and then longer) it still had a strong beer taste.  I'm sure the alcohol cooked out, but I did not like the flavor it left.

Not the worst, but really, just not that good.

I've just moved to Texas, and all my neighbors make great pinto beans.  This was a good starting place.  I added a hambone to the dried beans.  When they were almost done, I added some sauted kielbasa with the vegies and seasonings. I added the cilantro closer to the end.  The cilantro is essential!  These were almost up to my neighbor's standards!

I needed a crockpot full of beans for a last minute family gathering so I made the following modifications which turned out excellent. I look forward to trying the recipe as is and anticipate a similarly wonderful result! I used a 6-lb can of pinto beans, drained and rinsed (this about filled my crockpot). I added one can condensed chicken broth plus 1 can water in place of the 2 quarts chicken stock and half of a 24-oz Dos Equis beer. I added the remaining ingredients as listed and let the whole thing cook on low for about 5 hours. I pureed about 2 cups of the beans in the blender and added them back to the crockpot to thicken the mixture. They were excellent served over brown rice or with cornbread. Nobody missed the meat!

So simple and so favorful!  I left out the beer and instead added about a 3/4 cup of red wine.  I also used fresh jalapeño, instead of pickled.  My husband raved over this recipe!

I have cooked these many times now. Best Mexican beans ever and they freeze wonderfully.  I did 2 lbs. in a slow cooker, soaked beans night before.  Used 1 1/2qt. chicken broth. 2 bottles bud light. 1lb lean bacon/sliced into 1" pieces and cook, partially drain,  add 1 onion and 9 cloves garlic to bacon and sauté. 1 cup or so leftover pulled pork.  Sliced/slight 1/3 cup jalapeño from a jar, the fresh that I used the first time was to hot for my family. The jarred kind are always heat  appropriate. 3 cans of diced tomatoes w/ onions, green pepper etc. cut to smaller pieces.  Only used 1 1/2 bay leaves and 1 1/2 large Tbls. oregano and added fresh as needed toward the end. 1/2 bunch of cilantro in the beginning and add the rest toward the end. Along with some cumin and liquid smoke.(last two hours).  Cooked all day in 6 qt slow cooker on high 10-7pm.   When I finished they tasted even better than the best retaurant borracho beans in TX!!  Yum!!!! My friends and family can't get enough of these. Thanks Kiki :-)  

I also have made them with rib meat minus the bbque sauce.

AWESOME!!!  I did not add the beer.  I did not have any and I think it may not have needed it.  I seeded one jalapeno and quartered it.  That added plenty of heat.  However, after soaking the beans overnight I put them in the crock pot on high at 7 AM.  By 3 PM the beans were still hard.  I had to put them on the stove in order for them to be ready by 5-ish.  This recipe was a big hit.  I think it would be great with ham or chicken in it. But it made a great side dish for a mexican dinner.

Very close to what is served in San Antonio, with a few tweaks.  I used only one can of tomatoes and drained about half the liquid off.  I used only 2 Tablespoons of pickled jalapenos, and that is plenty of heat, along with only 3 large cloves of minced garlic.  I subbed 1 tsp. of cumin for the oregano, because that is more authentic, and we prefer it.  About 1/2 cup of fresh cilantro is enough to give it good flavor without overpowering the dish.  To be truly authentic, it needs a little bacon, but I will add that next time.

The only thing I did differently is that I used Corona instead of a dark beer. The flavor was excellent! My only complaint is that there was too much liquid in the end and I didn't want to use a masher to mash the beans to thicken as suggested due to the sake of appearance. Next time I will just elimante the water. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not including the beer completely defeats the prupose of the recipe. They are called drunken beans, because they are swimming in beer. I used Dos Equis and thought the flavor was so good and so much better than the ones at Fuzzy's tacos. My husband thought so as well. I think it's probably an aquired taste for some, and maybe one those who dislike beer will never aquire, to each his own. But if you like beer, and you like beer in your cooking, you'll probably love these beans.

Love!Love!Love this recipe!  I've made it with and without the beer and it's great both ways.  I use fresh jalapeno because we've got a pepper plant.  I've served it with chorizo, but also made a meal of the beans alone.  I added shredded chicken once - also great.  Everyone I've made these for has raved and begged for the recipe.  I live in south Texas where you can get good Tex-Mex beans on every corner, but my husband would rather I make these.  I love to make a huge pot and send some to work and some to the neighbors.. everyone loves them.  I love that this is an inexpensive meal that can fill everyone up.  Gracias, Kiki!

I am making these today (Memorial Day) for probably the 4th time.  I absolutely LOVE these beans.  After soaking the beans overnight, I throw everything into the crockpot and wait for the house to fill with that wonderful aroma. They are a nice change from the sweet baked beans that I often make with BBQ.  They go great with every kind of meat - today they'll be accompanying my grilled baby back ribs.  YUM!  Thanks for such a great recipe Kiki!

Awesome Beans!  I made a double batch for a Tex-Mex party and everyone raved about them.  I left the beer out because I didn't have one and the beans were great.  I think that it is very important to use a good quality chicken stock.  It adds so much flavor.  I paired these beans with Spanish Rice Original (recipe on this site) and all I can say is YUM!

Using chicken broth in place of water is brilliant and such a no-brainer.  I don't know why I never thought of it.  Makes the beans so good!  I omitted the cans of tomatoes and replaced them at the end with fresh tomatoes.  My recommendations:  cook this at a simmer for a bit longer or in the crockpot on high -- don't let the mixture come to a boil.  It will help keep the broth for the beans clear.  Don't add salt until after the beans have cooked.  It can make the beans tough plus there's already plenty of salt in the chicken broth.  I recommend adding salt to taste at the end of the cooking process. Make sure your beer is at room temperature.  If it is cold, it will make your beans split when you add it.  As for the seasonings, I omitted the bay leaves, cut back on the oregano to 1 T and added about 2 teaspoons of cumin.  About an hour before the beans were done (when I added the beer, garlic, oregano and cumin), I cooked about 4 thick slices of bacon, then cooked my onion in the bacon fat.  I crumbled and added the bacon to the beans.  About ten minutes before serving, I stirred in the onions, the jalapeños, 4 chopped Roma tomatoes and about 1 cup of chopped cilantro.  Yum!  It was so good!

Followed the recipe exactly and the flavor is pretty good. I don't think they are too spicy as some other reviewers have suggested. I do however find the garlic flavor a bit too biting and the beer flavor too strong. (As in, the beans taste like beer). I would recommend sweating the onions & garlic in a little oil before adding to the beans to get rid of bitterness, possibly cutting back to maybe 4 cloves. Also recommend using about 8 oz of beer instead of 12.

Amazing dish! I was eating a very similar dish (made with black beans instead of pinto) at a local brunch place practically every weekend and needed to figure out how to make it for myself (for budget purposes). I used this recipe but replaced the beans with black beans and Oh.My.God. it's even better than the $10 dish I was ordering. I serve this over grits with a dollop of sour cream and a hard boiled egg sliced in half on top. Perfection. Also, I noticed a real difference when I used a higher quality stout--it's even better!

These were awesome!  They do taste like Taco Cabana beans.  I added a packet of the Goya Saxon and it really made a difference..yummy!  Also a little trick that works really well (not 100% but does help tons w/ the musical fruit if you know what I mean :-)  Add a teaspoon of baking soda earlier in the cooking process.  I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could!

These beans are great! The seasonings are just right. My only variation is this: I have found that oil or fat is essential to excellent beans, so I use a few tbsp of olive oil and sautee the onions, garlic and herbs in the oil then add it to the beans. The flavor is the same, but it is just so much more amplified!

We loved this recipe.  The only changes I made were:  I added 5 slices of chopped bacon to the pot with the chicken stock and the water.  I did not add the salt and pepper until this mixture had cooked for 1 1/2 hours.  I used 1 tablespoon of kosher salt instead of table salt as kosher salt is less salty tasting in soup, stew, or beans.  I replaced the pickled jalapeno peppers with two fresh jalapenos, chopped.  My husband said that "this is a keeper."  It is soupy, but we liked it that way.  I served it with jalapeno cornbread.

This recipe is way too salty!  If (and that's a big IF) I make this recipe again, I will cut the salt down to one-fourth of what the recipe calls for.  The dark beer was also not to our liking.  If I make this recipe again, I will either leave out the beer or use a blonde instead of dark beer.

I've never knowingly had Borracho Beans before but I'm always looking for some new ways to fix beans.  I have a new found appreciation for pickled jalapenos also so I figured why not?  Well I just don't know.  I don't hate the beans but they really aren't doing anything for me.  There is a weird taste which I really can't identify.  I'm hoping my opinion will change when I try them again tomorrow and they've sat overnight.  But for now, I don't know that I'd make this recipe again.

Since I didn't prepare for this meal ahead of time, I put the dried beans into a large pot and covered them with water about an inch above the beans.  I brought the pot to a boil and then covered the pot and removed it from the burner.  After an hour or so, I drained the water and then began following the recipe.  I only had Miller Lite on hand so I used that.  I was concerned that it wouldn't taste right because it gave off a weird odor with the oregano, but it was fine.  I added extra jalapenos to the pot since we like our food spicy.  This was absolutely delicious and worth the time put in.  This is a definite keeper!

Mmm...this recipe is cooking in my stock pot now, and my house smells great.  I doubled the recipe for a family barbecue, using two bottles of Shiner Bock Beer, and the flavor is amazing.  I also added a fresh jalapeno instead of pickled because my mom loves jalapenos, and this gives the beans a pinch.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  I've never gotten the right flavor, and this is what I was looking for.

You cannot skip the beer on this recipe if you want to taste true borracho beans! The beer gives the juice such a famliar distinct taste, without it, they are just beans! I added a few slices of bacon in the beginning to add flavor and a bit of fat to keep from sticking. Also, i added a serrano pepper because the jalepenos did not make it hot enough.

These beans are fabulous! I served them with grilled chicken, which we ended up tossing right into the beans.  I did wait until the end of the cooking time to add the cilantro. Thanks Kiki. These will be a family "keeper"!

These were fantastic.  If you don't like this recipe, then you probably just don't like borracho beans; if do like them, and you're looking for recipe to recreate the real thing, no need to look any further.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

These beans needed a little bit more so I added chili powder, paprika, and cumin. I substituted the pickled jalapeños for two fresh ones (discarding the seeds). I also made it in the crock pot on low for 10 hours (turned it on in the morning before work and ready by the time I got returned). Since I made it in the crock pot, I added some turkey sausage. Super delish!

Made this according to recipe and had enough for me and hubby and the entire congregation of our local Methodist church.  This serves at least 20-24 as a hearty side dish...and a very tasty one at that!!!  The flavor is very different and impressive.  Gracias!

True and authentic borracho beans. I also added chorizo and jalapeno juice when the other ingredients were put in which gives it a bit of a kick. My Mexican family loves it so much for our family get togethers I'm always asked to make the borracho beans! Thank you for sharing Kiki!!

I have made these several times and actually prefer them without the beer and oregano.  I also use fresh jalepeno instead of the pickled.

Amazing. Perfect. I made two small modifications: added two packets of Sazon Goya and used cilantro from a jar (Goya) instead of fresh. Delicious!

The first time I made these they did not come out at all. I must have underseasoned them because they were bland and strange tasting.
Luckily, I tried again! We love beans and I wanted to use up some old MGD. So I used what we had on hand and mimicked this recipe, and they were AMAZING. I love the flavor. My only real innovations were that I used some leftover pork fat, and added some of the vinegar from a jar of sweet jalapenos. The fat and sugar brought all the flavors together beautifully. Thanks for sharing this!
P.S. My beans had soaked almost 24 hours and cooked fully in about an hour.

Fantastic taste! I followed the ingredients list exactly. I soaked the beans overnite and then all to the crockpot, except for the beer and tomatoes.  I added them the last 2 hours. I cooked it on high all day for 8 hours. They had incredible flavor and were at hit at my Cinco de Mayo party. I think Mexican cornbread is a perfect pairing. Definitely a keeper in my recipe files.

Doubled the beans and after soaking them overnight cooked everything in the crock pot. Used Mexican stewed tomatoes and left out the jalapenos as I was cooking for an office function. I couldn't believe that I didn't have any leftovers!

I had been looking for a good bean sidedish annd Kiki's Borracho filled the bill.  I cut the recipe in half because it is only my wife and I .... but it still turned out great.  I also decrease the jalapeno pepper because my stomach just can't handle it as it could long ago.  Thanks Kiki with sharing your memories as well as this recipe.

I'm a gringo living in El Paso, Texas so that will set the stage a bit.  I've made these beans many times and they are always a hit whenever I take them parties or potlucks.  Sometimes people will ask if I could bring my 'wonderful beans.'  I can't take the credit, but they ARE wonderful.  The only small change I made is using a 'lighter' beer rather than a dark one, and I also add a little chili powder and cumin. 
They are just amazingly delicious.   THANK YOU Kiki for sharing your fabulous recipe!

This is a good recipe, not very spicy although it sounds like it should be. I added more Jalapenos and cilantro to pick it up a little. But it is a good side dish.

Way to much work!  Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and use canned pinto beans.  Took them to a tailgate party and came home with half the pot left.

I absolutely LOVE Borracho Beans! I eat them in Mexican restaurants a lot, but never had a clue how they were made to get this great flavor (although I did know what Borracho means and that they probably had beer in them).  I will be making these often.  Thanks for the recipe Kiki!

My family thought that these were the best beans that they were tasted!!!  The only changes that I made were to use one can of mexican stewed tomatoes and a bottle of Shock Top Beligan white beer.  That is what I had at home.  I did let them cool some before serving.  This was very important.  It brings out the flavor!!!

I followed this recipe pretty closely. I don't measure. I know I put a little less cilantro as I don't care for the taste but it is necessary for borracho beans. I maybe added half a cup of water, but definitely had less than two inches of liquid above the beans. Used Shiner Bock as I've found it perfect for cooking. Also I used the canned stewed tomatoes labeled Mexican Style for those extra spices. I also added cut bacon and fried the onion (I added green onion as well) and garlic in the drippings before adding to the beans. The flavor was awesome and my Mexican husband demanded I not change a thing. The secret to beans is letting them cool for as long as possible. Will be serving in ramekins topped with crumbled queso fresco and garnished with a sprig of cilantro. Will be making again.

I need to add to my original review...that I used Coors Light instead of a dark beer.  We always just use a light beer.  Still fabulous.

This recipe is perfect. I soaked my beans overnight and cooked them in my crock-pot all day. My family loved them!  The only thing I added was ham hocks. With those, I wish I would have reduced the amount of salt. I had already cut it in half from the amount called for but they still came out a bit salty. Definitely recommend.

This turned out really good and my hubby really liked it too.  I did use two fresh jalapenos instead of jarred.  I served this as a side dish to my Carnitas.  It made A TON for a side dish.  I think next time I will simmer with all the ingredients all day to really incorporate the flavors.

I was really trusting Kiki's abuela, but that whole tablespoon of salt really overpowered me and is why I only gave 4 stars. I'm not an anti-salt fiend, either. I will try them again, though ... just with less salt. Thanks for sharing.

These were very good, I didn't get to let them simmer, but they would be delicious if they had about an hour at least of simmer time.  Yummy!

My husband and I moved to Utah from South Texas a year ago and we have been DIEING for some Tex-Mex!  Nothing here satisfies our cravings!  So I came to All Recipes looking for a borracho beans recipe.  These are fabulous!  My husband was so happy with the results, and so was I.  I must have done something wrong, though, because even though I soaked the beans overnight, cooked all day, and only added the salt at the end, the skins were tough.  Maybe it was the beans themselves.  I've cooked my fair share of beans before without this problem.  I'll chalk it up to a fluke.  I will be making these again, next time adding some sausage.  Yum!

this is a great platillo but if you add bacon and weiners... to the Frijoles Borrachos (Drunken Beans) it would taste much better.. you cook the bacon seperately then take bacon out and you sauteed the tomatoes, onions in little bit of the bacon grease to give it that flavor then you pour the sauteed tomatoes,o nions in the pot with the beans and jalapenos..beer.. the cilantro you put it at the end.... dont forget to cut the wieners and bacon in small pieces

Really bummed that I forgot to buy the cilantro for the recipe. This was just ok for us. Everyone thought it was a little on the bland side. I used a fresh jalapeno. Did not have much luck with the crock pot. After five hours on low the beans and chicken broth were still to firm. So I had to dump the whole thing into a pot and do it stove top. Luckily, I came home in time to realize it wasn't going to be done in time for dinner.

I wasn't really crazy about the flavor, but that's just because I'm not a huge fan of cooking with beer, but with that being said, everyone else loved this and thought the flavor was great.

I made this last night and it was delicious!  Very flavorful on it's own, but I served this with chopped onions, cilantro, tortillas, and all the fixings for a make your own burrito dinner--very tasty!  Please use vegetable broth to make this vegetarian--SOO good!

Totally great. I served with rice and leftover chicken in a spicy sauce.  We had plenty of leftovers for another couple of meals.  The aroma in the house was fantastic as well. Istarted out using the slow cooker and my beans were hard after six hours, so I read the tips that I had "old beans" and moved it to the stove top.  Perfect.

I made this in the crockpot too.  I combined this recipe with a Frijoles a la Charra recipe by adding some meat (two smoked ham hocks) and sauteeing the onions, garlic, peppers and tomatoes before adding.  The bay leaves really add to the flavor.  I wasn't sure about them, because I usually add them to navy bean soup (not mexican cuisine, but I figured, what the heck, I'll give it a try).  I added a pinch of cinnamon, paprika and coriander too, they are spices you'd find in Sazon.  I added too much water, I wasn't paying attention, but in the end it didn't matter at all.  This is a very forgiving recipe and the beans were superb, better than restaurant quality.  Thanks Kiki!!!

This is a great recipe with a nice depth of flavor.  I made some slight changes - halved the broth, used veggie broth, cooked beans in the first stage of cooking in a pressure cooker, added 1 can diced tomato instead of 2 cans stewed, used lager instead of dark beer, used a seeded serrano instead of jalapenos, also added 3/4 of a big green pepper, fake ham seasoning (I'm a vegetarian but know that flavor pairs nicely w/ beans), and about 1/4 tsp cumin.  The consistency is not that of refried beans or whole cooked beans, but a looser concoction, a little like a thick soup.  I served with homemade spanish rice and it was delicious.  Today I'll try with quesadillas and I'm sure it'll be a smash!  As others have stated, soaking the beans overnight and starting with fresher beans are very important as this drastically reduces cook times!

Everything turned out very well.  The beans were flavorful and there was just the right amount of liquid after about 5 hours of total cook time.  There wasn't any particular flavor that stood out to me, it all blended very well.  Tasted like the beans from back in San Antonio :) People have to remember to SOAK THE BEANS OVERNIGHT!

I found this recipe while looking for a way to use up leftover pinto beans and some chicken I had in the fridge.  I made a half batch in the crockpot using two tomatoes from my garden in place of the stewed tomatoes, fresh jalapenos in place of the pickled ones, and fresh cilantro and oregano.  I didn't have any beer so I left it out.  I added some leftover cut up chicken from two chicken breasts.  After cooking all day it smelled wonderful.  My entire family enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, we will be using it often!

I loved this recipe so much that I am rating it at 4 stars now and we haven't even eaten them yet!!! Very simular to a recipe my bf's mother who is dominican makes and serves over white rice.....I did opt (like another reviewer for corona rather than dark beer...I dont like the taste....) I also only put one can of tomatoes rather than 2 so as not to mask the other flavors....on a personal note cilantro (fresh) is ESSENTIAL!!! For authentic carribean taste and flavor....ENJOY!!! I know we will!!

Excellent. I wondered about adding salt with the first cook of the beans. It slows down cook time. Bean cooking 101. I left out salt until the end when beans were soft. The rest to the tee.

Wonderful recipe, I have made this several times.  Fire roasted tomatoes and a little cumin and chili powder added even more delicious flavor.  This is great with or without the beer, so don't worry if you don't have one.  thanks for this staple recipe!!

I don't like beer but I followed the original recipe anyway. The beans were good, but I could smell and tase the beer and I just couldn't finish what I had served on my plate. My Mom like them a lot. Next time I'll try wiyhout beer.

This is a very good bean dish.  Serve with some rice, and you've got an entire meal.  I've never used the beer.  Other than that, I usually follow the recipe exactly.  It's cooling down now this August, and I'm looking forward to eating this again all fall and winter long like we did the past two  years.

Very good. I didnt' have pickled jalapenos so I substituted dried small red chili peppers. It was good, but next time I will try and get the jalapenos, I think it would make a big difference.

I skipped the onion, used canned diced tomatoes and can diced green chiles for the jalapeno. Wow! We sprinkled a little cheddar and a dollop of sour cream on top one night, and crushed tortilla chips another. Wonderful as a main dish soup.

This cake out wonderful and so tasty!! I didn’t use pickled jalapeños because those can be so vinegary. I used fresh instead. And I also added some thick cut smoked bacon pieces for a little more flavor. About 8-10 slices.  I will definitely be making these again.

These beans were so good! Mine weren't drunk, as I don't like beer, so I used just a half teaspoon of liquid smoke instead.  I added some of the beans to some pulled pork cooked in enchilada sauce and made chimichangas.  Wow!  Along with Chef John's Mexican style shrimp cocktail and roasted corn off the cob, we had a wonderful meal.

Agh, I didn’t finish reviewing! Anyway, I’d reduce the liquid by quite a bit if I made this again so as to make it less soupy. I didn’t have jalapeños so I used some powdered aji amarillo, which gave it a nice warming feeling rather than adding heat. Otherwise, made it as suggested (with the exception of using the crockpot). It’s okay, not sure I’d make it again. It sounds like it’s something you get very nostalgic about if you grew up with it, which I didn’t.

My family loves this recipe!  I used canned beans and added black beans and great northern beans.   Used an 18 oz bottle of beer and fire roasted diced tomatoes.  Served it with pulled pork sandwiches and mac n cheese.

the meal turned out great, there were a couple of things I did differently. I add three tablespoons of pinto bean seasoning from my local grocery store that I had sitting on my shelf from a time before. Also added a half pack of cut up bacon and only used one can of stewed tomatoes. However, all in all the meal turned out great.

I've made this twice (first time was disappointing), but the second time I made the following changes with WONDERFUL results: Since I used a slow cooker i used only 1 cup water; add: 1 smoked ham shank, 1 Tbsp dried onion flakes, 1 Tbsp cumin, 1/4 tsp ground chipotle powder, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. Double the oregano and triple the garlic (we like garlic).

Made one pot with Corona, and one pot with no beer. Both very good. Prefer without. Thanks so much for sharing.

YUM!!!  One of the best pot of beans I've made!  I added a ham hock and only had a light beer, so that's what I used.  Also used fresh jalapeno.  So good and the hubs went back for seconds :)

I LOVE this recipe! The only thing I did different was instead of using salt, I added extra crunchy cooked BACON (about 1/2lb) ! Oh and I didn't have jalapenos or a can of stewed tomatoes, so I substituted them for 1/2 can of El Pato tomatoes sauce...I also added a little bit of cumino because my husband and I LOVE it. 
Great recipe! I'll keep this one forever!

Really didn't care for this. Very bland and way too much liquid. Was more like a soup than a bean side dish. Maybe, I missed the point of these. I've never had Tex Mex beans.

Very good!  I made it in a crock pot.  Next time I will cut back on the jalapenos as it was a little too hot for my wife.  Also will bring the beans to a boil; then soak overnight.  In the past this has worked better than just soaking overnight.

No changes, will make again and use very little bit of cilantro "1 1/2 cups " ?  Way to much!  I liked it until I put about 1/3 cup of cilantro in it.

I just made this for the first time and it turned out great. Thank you for the easy to follow recipe. I did add some bacon to it and topped it with more cilantro and some fresh avocado.  Yummy. I will definitely be making this again.

These are really good. Next time I will cut down on the garlic just a little bit. I did not use the dark beer because of the reviewers that noticed the taste ( I am sure I would, not  beer drinker), but the chicken broth gives a nice flavor.  I also put the tomatoes in the food processor for just a few pulses. I served them with enchiladas and the next day just flour tortillas with the leftovers.

This was delicious! My kids both loved it, too. The only thing I would change would be to use two or more hocks, because I like the extra pieces of meat.

This gets 5 stars in my book, definitely  do not need to search any farther for that traditional restaurant flavor. It makes it into my recipe book to use often. Being from South Texas,  I visit a lot of Mexican restaurants and their beans are generally good and pretty much basic, but this is so much better. Might be a bit spicy for some, but perfect for my taste buds. I used Bud lite, as that was all I had but it still had an excellent blend of flavors and ingredients. Kiki might need to market this stuff. Ole, eat, drink, and be happy!

I make this for all family celebrations when we are serving Mexican food! I never have left-overs because it is the star of the table! The flavors are rich and well developed! I do  add some fresh jalapenos. A lot of people in my family top it with sour cream and pico d'gallo! (warm tortillas are great with it as well!)

This was my 1st time cooking Borracho Beans so I looked at several other recipes before going with this one. Some other recipe used 1/2 pound of bacon cooked crispy (approx 10 min) chopped and adding the bacon grease as well. I thought the Oregano was very overwhelming so next time (yes there will be a next time) I'll try about 1/2. 1 whole (large) jalapeño chopped and seeded is barely noticeable...fyi.

Delicious!  I've made this several times - the first exactly according to the recipe, which tasted good but a little bland for my taste.  After that, I made a couple of changes - substituting 2 jalapenos for the pickled jalapenos, and Heineken instead of dark beer.

I have never had these before, but liked the sound of the recipe and made it. I used fresh jalapeno's, Old Speckled Hen beer and reduced the amount of chicken stock. Also I used 4 different canned beans. It is awesome!!

I made this to try to use up some pinto beans I was given, and boy am I glad I did. Its was so delicious. First of all, any recipe with beer as an ingredient is welcome in my kitchen! We put the beans in some flour tortillas with cheese, cilantro and onions and it was the best!

The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I felt like it had too much oregano. The flavor of everything else is great, but overwhelmed by it. I will definitely make these again, but cut back to maybe half the oregano called for. I used a Sweetwater 420 beer which is a medium stout and had no beer aftertaste.

I was looking for a copycat recipe for La Hacienda Ranch's Drunken Beans.  This is nearly identical in flavor.  Absolutely fabulous!  I used Black Butte Porter for the beer.  We love it with a sweet cornbread on the side.

I grew up in San Antonio and living now in the Midwest I really (REALLY) miss the food. This wasn't exactly like the borracho beans I'm use to but it was still delicious! I didn't soak the beans overnight (didn't have time) but I did soak them for about an hour. I found that to be adequate. I used Dos Equis instead of dark beer (just don't like dark beer) so it may have lost some flavor because I did that. Otherwise the only adjustments I made were using fresh jalapeno over jarred because I have a ton from my garden. I also used cilantro paste because I hate cilantro leaves. This is one I'll definitely make again so thanks!

We really enjoyed the flavor of these beans but I had a tough time getting them to cook (after soaking overnight we put them in the crockpot on "high"), hence the 4 stars and not 5.  Now I'm wondering if it took forever b/c my beans were "old"?  We used 1 whole fresh jalapeno instead of pickled.

Yum!  I followed another reviewer's advice and threw everything in a crockpot and cooked on low for several hours.  When I came home it smelled SO GOOD!  It's important to mash the beans with a potato masher; this changes the texture and taste of the dish.  This can be served as a main meal...kind of like a soup.  Full of flavor and fiber.  The dark beer is an interesting ingredient and gives it a unique taste!

I was really excited about making these beans. But, I feel like the flavor fell short. I did cut the recipe in half, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. They are not a total waste, but they weren't as I expected. Thank you for sharing. EDIT: So I served these beans over Absolute Mexican Cornbread from the site, and then topped with cheese & sour cream. Served this way was great.

These are good beans paired with fajitas. I used a giant can of pinto beans because I didn't have time for soaking, but used all other ingredients as listed. I added Shiner Bock for the dark beer and the flavor worked well. Very Good!

This recipes had the taste that I was looking for. I used one can of tomatoes instead of two and eliminated the beer and jalepenos. I served it with Marie Callender's Southwestern Corn Bread Mix. I added a can of corn to the corn bread and it was wonderful.

I made this recipe, as is, on the stove top. I used Shiner Bock beer.  Had them for our Labor Day cook-out and got rave reviews. One said better than any they'd had in a restaurant!  Next time I would add another 1/2 lb of beans to the recipe.

I love this recipe and make it often. My favorite tips:  Fresh Jalapenos (in addition to what's called for, we like a little fire in my family)Add CUMIN, about 1 Tbsp.  Use dry beans soaked overnight, but if you're short on time, canned pintos will work. Great in a  crock pot - just let it cook - long and low overnight - WOW!

Healthy & easy!  I've made this several times and found that it turns out better with a dark beer like Guinness.  Also, I save on ingredients by using canned diced Italian tomatoes and canned diced tomatoes w/ jalapeno.

My family has always liked my chili but now this one has replaced it.  It was truly wonderful.  I added chicken to give it some meat.

I LOVE this recipe!  I add the peppers to my own bowl so the kids won't think it's "too spicy."  For adults who love traditional borrachos, this is the one!  Awesome in the crock pot, too!!

This isn't my kind of dish at all, but Husband really enjoyed it. I made it with Amber Bock beer (nice flavor, not too heavy) plus I threw in some finely diced fresh jalaps as well as the jarred kind. I omitted the oregano, and added a few good shakes of Adobo seasoning. I mashed everything up a little, and served it with flour tortillas and sour cream. It would be great with some homemade guac too. Like I say, I wasn't wowed by it, but Husband was extremely appreciative. Thanks, Kiki!

This was really good, something different. I followed the recipe but did not have beer. It is very filling and healthy! I keep making it but have to remember to tone down the jalapenos just a little for me. Delicious with or without cilantro but makes it a totally different dish. Thank you!

I cooked in the crock pot for 5 hours on high, 4 on low and then pureed.  I think because of this cooking method there may have been excess liquid and it was definitely a soup.  I used a Guinness stout and the flavor was very mild at the end.  I topped with fresh pico de gallo, diced avocado grilled chicken and a couple of tortilla chips.  For added spice you may want to add extra "heat" at the end of cooking.

I am not much of a bean eater and have never cooked dried beans before in my life! These were very good and easy! I did not soak them overnight. I cooked them several hours on low, stirring and adding more liquid every so often. I only had chelada beer (beer with tomato juice in it) and it was great...added 2 fresh jalapeno peppers, probably could have used 1 more for a little extra bite. My family loved it and all had seconds! This will be a great recipe to take camping with us.

I just made this for dinner tonight. We all loved it! The only variation I made was leaving out the chicken stock (because I didn't have any). In it's place a used water and about a cup of chopped Canadian bacon(I did have on hand) and it gave a subtle flavor to the recipe.  
We ate it with crusty bread and a salad.

Thanks very much for this one. It's a keeper!

We decided to try making this in the slow cooker and it worked pretty well. We used all the broth called for, next time we'll cut it down by about 2 cups. We cooked it for 8 hours on low then mashed. Very tasty. Great on a potato.

I was looking for a way to use up some pinto beans I had in the pantry.  This was amazing. I've never had drunken beans before, but if I ever travel to Texas, you can be sure I will order some.

I cooked the beans in a crock on low for about 7 hours and they turned out perfect.

Absolutely delicious.  I did not use the beer as we do not consume any alcohol-this is the best bean recipe I've found!
