Really good recipe! I used half butter & half applesauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup Splenda & cut down on the oats. I also omitted the water since I saw no need for it. I got about 30 from this. Thanks so much!

These are great cookies, i have made the multiple times over this past winter.  I keep a tupperware of cookie dough balls in the freezer so I can pop a couple in the oven whenever we feel like fresh warm cookies.  The key to make sure they don't get dry is to watch your baking time.  Take them out just before they look done.  They continue to cook slightly on the pan as they cool.  Yum, they are always a little crisp on the outside and chewy inside, Yum!

This is the only oatmeal cookie recipe I use.  As I do with any cookie recipe, I half the amount of sugar.  A delightful cookie!  Thanks to the submitter!

I made these the other night and they came out very chewy, just the way my family likes them.  I added cinammon to the batter and chocolate chips to half of the batter for my daughter and raisins in the other half for my son.  I recommend this recipe for anybody who wants to add more complex carbos. to their diet.  Very good!

I followed this recipe exactly and they are the best I have ever had.  I made giant dough balls for very big cookies.  Don't over bake.  In the future i may try to play with the amount of sugar and try using applesauce instead of butter just to make it even more healthy.  But if that does not work I'll be using it as is.  Thanks for a great cookie!

I made these for DH.  Like others, he said they were a little dry, but he still really liked them, and was suprised when I told him they were made with whole wheat flour.  I quartered this recipe since I wasn't sure how they would turn out, and I added a few dashes of cinnamon, as well as a dash of nutmeg, and raisins until it looked like there were enough!  I would make this again, but would add either an extra egg or some applesauce.

I added a mix of dried cherries, dried cranberries and raisins.  Actually thought they tasted better the next day.  Baked 2 trays on Release foil and 2 trays using baking spray with flour in it - both worked, no problems with cookies sticking to the sheets.

I made these with dried blueberries instead of raisins (thats all I had) and they came out great!  My family really enjoyed them.  Nobody knew they were whole wheat until I said so.  Also, they freeze well.

I really liked these cookies.  With the Whole Wheat flour and Oatmeal I feel better about the kids eating them.  They turned out great, the perfect cookie, chewy and not flat. I did add Chocolet Chips.

I was looking for a recipe using whole wheat flour and these were great. I couldn't tell the difference from my usual oatmeal cookie recipe. I did add 1 cup of raisins because we love them and also 1 tsp of cinnamon. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipte is an okay oatmeal cookie base.  Nothing spectacular.  I have had better.  You have to make sure to let the dough sit after it is made and form a little, otherwise I got flat, greasy cookies that ended up in the garbage.  I can't way I will hold onto this one.

These are very good! I made a few modifications to make them a litte healthier (used about 3/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. splenda, used 1/2 cup Smart Balance 50/50 butter blend and 1/4 c. applesauce and used 1/3 c. egg white instead of an egg). Then I counteracted those healthier options by adding 1/2 a bag of chocolate chips! :) I made about 32 small cookies and baked them 12 minutes per batch. I shaped them into balls and flattened them by hand to get a nice smoothly shaped cookie.

Very, very good!  I added an extra egg in place of the water, and they turned out chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges.  We threw in some raisins, and could have cut the sugar a bit, since they added sweetness of their own. The dough was so good, I  didn't think I'd have any cookies to review, but the finished product was even better!

I've tried a lot of whole wheat cookie recipes, and this is by far my favorite.  I've made it countless times.  Everyone always loves them.  I'll usually add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and double the salt for a sweet and salty cookie.  Also, take them out of the oven at 12 minutes so they don't dry out!

My new favorite cookie!!!!  I mad some modifications.  I add 3 tb of natural peanut butter, toasted pecans and 1 cup of chocolate chips and use milk instead of water.  AWESOME!  Sometimes I have to add a little extra flour to keep the cookies puffy.

These are really good. I was looking for oatmeal cookies without white flour since I wanted healthier and these are great. I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. I will make these again and next time I might add chocolate chips. These also had the perfect sweetness, not to sweet. I found my cookies where done after 11-12 minutes.

I made a lot of modifications to make these healthier: used 1/4 c butter, 1/2 c apple sauce, half the called for sugar, ommitted the water, used 2 eggs, added 3 T flax meal, cinnamon and raisins.  I used a 3/8 oz scoop(Tablespoon sized) to measure out the dough  and got 80 cookies.  Mine did not spread at all so had to press them down before baking, and there was no problem with them sticking to the pan - it probably doesn't need to be greased. My cookies turned out to be ugly little health balls, but they are SO DELICIOUS!

Perfect!! This is a great recipe, the only way I am making cookies from now on!  My entire family LOVED them.  I used chocolate chips with this recipe.  Next time I am going to try dried cranberries.  I'm passing this recipe on to friends and family!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I halved the recipe, added a 1/4 C. of unsweetened apple sauce and reduced the butter by 1 Tbsp. I stirred in Craisins and semisweet chocolate chips at the end. Don't overbake these...just until you see a slight golden brown on the edges. Let them cool, before handling them and you'll have a perfectly chewey cookie! Excellent!

I used all purpose flour, half water with half orange juice, and added 1 cup raisins. Best oatmeal cookies EVER! Next time I'll try half applesauce and half butter like a reviewer mentioned to cut calories and fat.

Really good flavor. I threw in some peanut butter chips. Make sure you grease the pan, though. I forgot, and they were really hard to scrape off, especially because they are pretty crumbly while warm.

Finally!  I had been looking for a basic oatmeal cookie recipe.  These almost have a granola taste to them.  Whole wheat flour and 1/4 less butter than most oatmeal cookie recipes make these a little better for you too!

On our low-fat, low-sugar diet, these cookies are a life saver! Sooo good. Chewy, not too sweet. We make recipe as written, just add chocolate chips.

I really loved this cookie!  I gave it 4 stars because even though i thoroughly greased my cookie sheet, they still stuck, afterwards I used Reynolds Release foil wrap and they didn't stick that much.  Great flavor though thank you for sharing!

I've made this several times. After making it as written, I've reduced the sugar by 1/2 and added chocolate chips. This is a great recipe, allowing for changes based on what you have available and your personal preferences.

Excellent - I'm eating them as I type!  I may try less sugar next time for more of a chewy granola bar taste.  I like that they're hearty and not cake-like.

We love love love this recipe! Everytime I make them I forget to add the water, but it makes no difference, and also the only thing I do different is we add about 3/4c dark chocolate chips, and I make them smaller, so that we get about 85 or so bite size cookies...5 out of 5 all the way!

This are very good and full of oats!  I did add 1 cup chocolate chips for sweetness.  I did use more dough per cookie than what they reccommended, so it didn't make as many cookies.

Since my husband's bypass surgery I am looking for healthy ways for his favorites and love this, although I substituted lowfat margarine for the butter (ouch!) and 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1 cup Splenda - I used the 1/4 cup water to warm up and soak a few raisins.  They are very good, though I am sure the original is wonderful, forgive my messing around with your recipe, but thanks for posting it.Diane77346

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut back sugar. Wish I would have also cut back water because after a day of being in a container, these became very soggy. I agree with the others who said there are better oatmeal cookie recipes and I too do not understand how you get 60 cookies from this recipe.

These cookies were wonderful.  I did take the advice of another viewer and instead of using all butter, I used half applesauce.  I also cut back on   the brown sugar, I think they would have been too sweet, so I used 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/2 raw sugar.  I added raisins and they were great.  My family loved these, and you can't even tell that they are made with whole wheat flour.  Definitely a keeper!

Great cookies you don't have to feel guilty about!  I found the sifting tedious and it removed the wheat germ, so I just stirred this back in at the end for the fiber.  I added chocolate chips and walnuts and it was a big hit.  I even burned one batch and it was still good.  But if you bake them correctly, they come out slightly chewy and just fabulous.  Good stuff.

These were great! I did cut back on the sugar to 1 cup only of raw sugar (so I felt okay giving them to my toddler). They were not too sweet and made for a nutritious snack. I also used 2 1/2 cups oats and 1/2 cup flax seed to add another boost of omega 3s.

These didn't turn out too bad... I prefer an oatmeal cookie that's a bit chewier than this recipe yields, but to compensate I found that patting the balls flat before baking prevented them from getting all puffy and "cakey" like the first batch did, and made them more chewy like I like. A good, solid recipe but it didn't make anything near 5 dozen cookies... more like 2 dozen *small* cookies. I'll try this one again with some adjustments and see if I can't make it a bit better.

I would absolutely disagree that this cookie doesn't taste like a sweet treat!  It is as good as any good oatmeal cookie I have had.  It definitely doesn't taste "natural" though it doesn't have any processed sugar or flour!  If you are looking for the perfect "brown" cookie...you have found it.  Great with chocolate chips, too.

Very simple and EVERYONE loves them!!  A GREAT recipe, thanks! An addition: I've found that if you add half whole oats and half quaker quickie oats, the cookies are much  tastier.

These are the best oatmeal cookies ever!  I used light olive oil instead of butter, sea salt and added about 1/2 a teaspoon of fresh ground cinnamon.  These were yummy, and probably won't last until tomorrow!

Excellent. And all 4 kids loved them also. And they are picky. I did change a couple of things, added 1/4 teaspoon or so of cinn. Replaced 3 Tablespoons of the water with honey. And reduced the brown sugar to 1 1/4 cups. thanks Betty for the great recipe. Love all the oats and whole wheat flour also. Hard to sneak in that flour with my bunch, but no one can tell. Will make them over and over again.

Pretty good cookie, I made a few changes, used only about 1/4 c. brown sugar and a 1/2 c. splenda to make it more South Beach friendly and added an extra egg based on previous reviews. I added about 1/3 c. mini choc chips and a splash of molasses and they turned out good. They didn't flatten when I baked them so I had to flatten them first, good fairly healthy cookie, I'd make again and add raisins instead and some nuts.

Very good cookie - thin, moist, chewy and just the right amount of sweetness for a good healthy snack. It didn't get 5 stars because I prefer a thicker, drier oatmeal cookie. I added 3/4 cup of raisins to bulk it up a bit. Next time I may add some pumpkin pie spice and some chunky applesauce. Yum!

These are at least as good as the recipe on the oatmeal canister, and even better for you because of the whole wheat flour. I reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup and added an extra egg white and some cinnamon and nutmeg. I also substituted 1/4 cup of the butter with peanut butter, and added choc.chips to half the dough, and raisins to the rest.

I enjoyed these very much with dark chocolate chips and walnuts. I found that the longer the dough sat before baking the better they turned out. I think I remember something about whole wheat flour taking longer than regular  flour to absorb moisture, maybe something about it having more bran and/or being less refined. I would guess 30 to 45 minutes in the bowl after mixing and before placing on the baking sheet should be enough time for the dough to set up. My third batch was the best in terms of form, holding together, and not turning into a greasy looking mini pancake.

I was searching for whole wheat low sugar cookie recipes and this one was wonderful with a few modifications that I settled on after several experiments.  I used a white whole wheat flour (because that is the kind I had).  Instead of the brown sugar, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar/splenda blend and 1/2 cup of splenda (they were totally sweet enough with very little real sugar).  Instead of the butter, I used 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) and 1/4 cup of spreadable light butter (I previously tried to use less real butter and more light butter, but the flavor seemed to suffer a bit too much).  In the end I used about half of the recommended amount of water (in early experiments, I didn't add any water and the cookies seemed a bit too dry).  I also stuck with the 12 minute time limit that several people suggested.  This seemed about perfect to me.  Next time, I might try to add all of the water and and/or stretch the baking to 13 minutes.  Overall, I loved these cookies so much (and so did friends that I made them for) that I gave up my search for another healthy oatmeal cookie recipe.

My 19 year old son had been asking for me to help him make an oatmeal cookie recipe and the whole wheat flour sold me on it,they were a little too sweet for me but my whole family loved them. Will be making again with 1/2 cup less sugar.(maybe the fact that he added crasins and raisins was too much ?)

These are very good.  Did not make any where near 60 cookies though.  More like 24 normal sized. I put raisins in 1/2 the batter and walnuts in the other 1/2 (didn't combine them because of the different taste in my family but I bet raisins and walnuts together are great!).  Also added a little cinamon.

These were great.  My family loved them.  I did make two changes:  I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar because 1 1/2 seemed way too sweet and I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Wonderful.  I will make these again and again. Thanks!

I have a grain mill that makes fresh whole wheat flour so I've made many a whole grain items.  This wasn't my favorite.  It was dry, and the first batch fell apart.  The other batches seemed to stay together better after sitting a while as dough.  I added chocolate chips when I figured out how bland this cookie was going to be.  Still, they are a healthier choice as far as cookies go and my husband and 4 year old seemed to like them just fine.

Wow! Very good cookies!  I used 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also added 1 TBL of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  Then I divided the dough into three parts and made one part with any add-in's, one part with Craisins and one part with Reese's Pieces.  All three were delicious!

I made some changes to the recipe. I used applesauce instead of margarine. I also used 3/4 c splenda and 3/4 c brown sugar. Finally I added raisins.

This recipe is very oat-y in texture. I think next time I will cut back on the oats and add more flour. Also, using a cookie scoop I got 42 cookies from this recipe and they are not big at all...not sure how you would get 60.

A very good healthful treat!  Like another reviewer I omitted the butter entirely and used olive oil instead (needed to up the flour by 1/4 cup probably because of the substitution). Also chopped up a Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bar (5oz) and added at the end.

We loved this recipe, especially since it has whole wheat flour and oats.  It seems healthier so you don't have to feel so guilty!  I followed the recipe exaclty and added 1 cup of dried cranberries.

Good recipe.  It was a change from our regular fatty cookies, but really good considering the fact that it's more healthy.  We added raisins and a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Next time I won't add the chocolate chips (Guess I got carried away). My children and my husband liked the cookies so I am sure that I will be baking them again.  Thanks for the great healthy(er) cookie recipe.

I followed this recipe to the tee, except that I used light margarine so I omitted the water.  These were just what I was looking for.  The cookies are moist and have lots of oatmeal in them unlike most oatmeal cookies I've seen.  Great warmed up with a cup of milk!

This cookie was so easy to make. I don't usually bake cookies and I had no problem at all. They come out very sweet. I make half the amount every time and it's so good warm out of the oven. I just want to ask anyone if they have a way to cut the fat/calories in this recipe?

Only used 1 c. sugar and added an egg, as suggested, but probably should have added 1/2 c. more flour to thicken things up a bit.  Also added 1 c. toffee pieces and 1 c. chocolate chips.  Delish!

Excellent recipe. I modified it a bit by using only a third of the sugar and adding 4 packets of Splenda. I also added an egg as other reviewers suggested. Finally, I added nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and pecans. They were fabulous. I'll definitely make them again.

These cookies are AMAZING! I was a little skeptical at first of how well they would turn out, because it seemed like hoping for such a healthy cookie to taste good would be too much to ask. But my skepticism didn't last long! These cookies disappeared just a fast as I made them! I did personalize the recipe a bit; I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup of raisins. This is the ultimate oatmeal cookie recipe!

This recipe is a keeper! I added semisweet chocolate chips and walnuts to mine. I also used organic extra thick old-fashioned oats by Bob's Red Mill instead of quick cooking oats. It gives it more of a bite, similar to a granola bar. I replaced the margarine with half butter and half Earth Balance. The only change I would make next time is I would use less sugar - maybe just 1 cup. They're a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall, GREAT "healthy" cookie!!!

I made these my own. 1/2 cup butter, 1 small container prune baby food. 1/4 cup brown sugar Splenda, 1/3 cup white sugar, splash maple syrup - no water. 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips, 1/4 cup pecans. Used whole wheat pastry flour. Chilled dough 1/2 hour. The dough seemed wet, but they baked up beautifully! Crispy edges and chewy inside. Yum!!

A great starter kit for oatmeal cookies!  My additions to the recipe were 1/2 cup craisins,1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup walnuts. Used half the butter and half the brown sugar and substituted  a half cup applesauce. Added 1/2 cup of oat bran also and NO egg. Upped the water to 1/2 cup.  Fabulous! A very healthy snack!

These cookies were a nice texture, very chewy. I thought they were a little on the bland side for some reason, but still pretty tasty. I added dried currants to them :-)

So easy to work with, very good! Like other reviewers, changed a couple things. Used 1/2c butter and 1/4 applesauce, little under 1c br sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, few dashes nutmeg, and a coarsly shredded apple.. so then only added a little water because of that. Also added just a few sprinkles of mini-choc chips.. Yum!

Thank you all for your great feedback, especially the 3 who said that the recipe did not make nearly the number of cookies as listed. Since the nutrients are not truly accurate, I will not be using this recipe unless I can figure out how to reduce the protein. I am on a restricted protein diet and need close to accurate nutrient content. I urge those submitting a recipe to not over estimate the yield. Again, thank you all for the great tips !!

My cookies were too runny and spread way out on the sheet.  So I added about 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour before baking the second batch.  I grind my own flour from wheat berries - so maybe it has a different consistency than store bought?  I added a teaspoon of cinamon - and they were delicious!

I added maybe half a bag of cinnamon chips to the batter and made 68 cookies. The flavor was good and they were chewy but they spread out and were kinda flat.

Wow, what a great cookie! Never thought a cookie with all whole wheat flour and 3 cups of oats could be so good. I added some flax meal (1/4 cup) and 2 tablespoons of soy flour. I might use less sugar next time, they were sweet, not too sweet but would be fine with a little less sugar. I also added craisins which were great in them.

Great recipe, the cookies turned out crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, just the way I like it. When it is just out of the oven, it is soft, but will harden upon cooling. The cookie does not spread out, so I could place them close together on the tray. I added only 1 cup of rolled oats, and some chocolate chips into the mix. I do not have a sweet tooth, and therefore I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. As I was craving coffee, I added 1 tablespoon of instant coffee into the water. Next time I will add more coffee!

Yummy,  but didn't hold together well.   I used half the dough for oatmeal cookies.  the other half I mixed in some peanut butter, m & m's and chocolate chips for a cowboy cookie.  Both turned out great.

Agree that sugar needs reduced.  I also added spices - taste is good but they are a pain to get off the baking sheet due to softness when they're hot.  I'll probably stick with my previous recipe.

what i do that makes these cookies blow my mind: use 1/2c. margarine and 1/4c. shortening (didn't have any butter).  used only 1/2c. flour and made up the rest with oat bran and wheat germ (gives it a nice nutty crunchy yummy taste). also added about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon...and added an egg. and lots of raisins. only used 1cup of brown sugar. i used quick cooking oats, not regular (recipe doesn't specify). oh and i forgot about the water until the very very end so it was the last thing i added. so i guess it's not really the same recipe at all. but still, SO good. best if you keep them small and round.

These cookies are the best!  I followed the recipe exactly and added about 34 cup raisins, and my husband, whose favorite cookies are oatmeal raisin, raved.  Not too sweet, but you could probably safely reduce the brown sugar to 1 or 14 cup.  Thanks very much, Henry and Maudie!

Thanks for this nutritious recipe!  I used a sugar substitute for 1/3 of the brown sugar, and it was good.  If you want to add extras like chips, nuts, or raisins, I'd either add an egg or cut down some of the dry ingredients to help them stick together when you're dropping them on the cookie sheet.  I loved the taste of whole wheat flour in them!
