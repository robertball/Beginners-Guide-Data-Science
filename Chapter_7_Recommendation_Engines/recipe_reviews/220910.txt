I am the writer of this recipe, and am so glad that others have enjoyed it! I wanted to mention a few things. First, please use REAL bacon crumbles, NOT imitation bacon bits. Hormel makes these, as do others. I can't imagine this would be the same with imitation bacon bits. The dry ranch dressing mix adds a great amount of flavor, so don't skip it. However, if you don't have dry ranch dressing mix, you can make your own (below). It makes a large amount, but is great for so many things (on meat, in soups/chili, burritos, etc.) To make it, simply combine and store in an airtight container:
    1/4 cup dried chives
    1/4 cup dried parsley
    1/4 cup dried dill weed
    2 tablespoons garlic powder
    2 tablespoons onion powder
    1 tablespoon salt
    1 tablespoon ground black pepper
Another variation my family enjoys is adding 1/2 cup-1 cup of Velveta Cheese. Also, for clarification, the 10 red potatoes are small-medium sized. If you buy the large ones, that are about the size of the palm of a hand, I would significantly cut back the number.

I doubled this recipe. Because I did not have chicken bouillion granules on hand, I used 6 cups of organic chicken broth. I also used homemade dry ranch seasoning mix. I needed this to be more filling (as in more meat.....my husband does not think that soup is a meal, I have to beef it up a bit), I chopped up two packages John Morrell smoked sausage and sauteed them with the onion and garlic before throwing them in. VERY GOOD. All the ingredients work together perfectly and there's just enough creaminess and just enough cheese to give it flavor without a lot of fat. Everyone liked this soup, my husband even!

Great recipe! I have already shared with several people at work. Freezes & reheats well. Serve with fresh loaf of French bread.

This is awesome! It's been simmering all day (well, 5 hours on high) and just finished about 1/2 hour ago. Here are my modifications: I doubled the recipe, used 3 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups water, added about 6 teaspoons chicken bouillon powder to round out the 'chickeny' flavor, used onion powder instead of onions (onions aren't my favorite), and pan fried the bacon myself (I didn't want to use the store bought bacon bits). About 10 mins after adding the half and half, I also added about 5 oz of the reduced-fat 2% milk Velveeta (per the authors suggestion!) and it turned out AMAZEBALLS! I ladled myself a bowl and garnished it with shredded medium cheddar and sliced green onions. My fiancé was walking out the door and I told him (the guy in the profile pic is my fiancé) to take a taste. His reaction was 'Oh MAN that is delicious. I don't think we'll have any left to share!' Keep in mind I doubled the recipe lol. This dish is a winner, winner, chicken dinner and I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

For those of you who think this came out too watery, just add some instant mashed potatoes until it reaches desired consistency.  Instant mashed potatoes are a great staple to keep on hand to thicken sauces and gravies.

Great tasting soup! I made this yesterday in my crock pot on the high setting and it was done in easily 4 hours. I opted to make it completely vegetarian so I left out the bacon and used vegetable Better Than Bouillon (a concentrated paste vs. a bouillon cube). I also added finely diced carrot for color and used one medium shallot instead of red onion. And I didn't have half & half so I replaced it with whole milk. I kept to the spices list exactly and it turned out delicious. I think the recipe is a great base. I can see other vegetables being added or meat variations. Don't be shy to swap the chicken base for vegetable. It really was delicious. I also saw some people mentioning the use of Velveeta. In my opinion, if you are going to make soup from scratch, best to use "real" food as much as possible. The traditional cheddar cheese I grated was perfect. Thank you for the recipe.

Love this recipe! So easy and comes out great if you cook it on high for 4 hours. I have already made this four times and every time it came out tasting great.

As written, this recipe is way too salty. A single serving has almost 70% of your daily allotment of sodium. With some modifications, this soup has become one of my favorites. I use half the bullion, omit the season salt, omit the red onion, and leave the bacon until the end as a garnish. If the soup comes out thin I add some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it.

This was easy, flavorful, and very rich. I subbed veg broth for chicken and used fresh parsley. I love the addition of ranch dressing mix. This is much more interesting than your typical potato soup!

This was delicious!  Family says this is a keeper.  I had medium to large size red potatoes and decided to do my best with this subjective quantity; I think this is why the reviews vary so much on taste.  Here's what I did: I used about 8 med to large reds (3 lbs), chopped in 1/4" to 1/2" cubes.  These filled a 4 quart oval crock pot to just about 1" from the top.  After adding remaining ingredients, there was still about 3/4" from the top.  I changed ingredients to:  6 tbsp flour, 1 c crumbled real bacon, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 oz. packet ranch dressing mix, 4 tsp parsley, 2 tsp seasoned salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 5 c water and 2 c half and half.  Kept rest of ingredients same as original 4 serving recipe.  This combination was not too salty for any of us.  Only thing I added was more black pepper on top to serve, then topped with shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream (made huge difference) and green onion.  This was perfect for 5 persons and was served with rolls.  No leftovers!  Prep time was a exactly 30 minutes; I cooked on low for about 10 hours (time away for work).

I have made this two times. The second time I mostly mashed the potatoes with a hand masher before I added the half and half. It made it thicker.

This is a nice and easy recipe for beginner's potato soup.  Using bacon bits is great for a no-mess clean up, but the smoke flavor from the bacon doesn't come through as much as it would with freshly fried bacon.  The only real issue is that the recipe comes out slightly under seasoned.  At the end, crack some fresh black pepper over the entire slow cooker, or on each bowl if you're serving a family member who likes bland food.  After adding the fresh black pepper at the end, the soup was very good.  It cost me $3.38 per serving to prepare.

This soup was delicious! I didn't have time to do it in the slow cooker so I did it on the stove and the only thing I did differently was fried 4 slices of bacon and browned the onion and garlic in the drippings . then added the rest of the ingredients. It did't take long at all and had a wonderfull flavor.

It's great. Mine turned out kind of watery at first, so I let it cook a few hours longer. It wasn't as creamy as I'd like either, so when I served it I put a dollop of sour cream and some cheddar shreds. After that it was perfect!

Wow!  I was looking for a recipe that woud remind me of a local restaurants potato soup my family loves, and this was spot on!  I made two small changes.  One was the bacon bits.  I used real chopped bacon in place, as we do not like imitation bacon bits.  The other was the ranch packet.  By mistake I thought it said ranch dressing!  So, since I did not have the packet, I used a 1/2 cup of the dressing.  Wonderful flavor all around!  I'll definitely be making this often!

Good solid soup. Reminded me of a chowder. I added some shredded cheddar when I added the half and half like others mentions. Next time I think I will mash the potatoes a little. Other than that it was fine.

This was the best soup ever! I did make some minor changes tho. I didnt have red potatoes so i used approx 7 medium brown potatoes. I peeled half and left the peel on the others. I also shredded 2 medium sized carrots into the soup. I was worried it would be too watery as some other reviews stated so i used a little less water. I cooked it on low for 7 hrs. I also left out the added salt and garlic.  I smashed some of the potatoes at the end to make it more thick. I also fried up 6 pieces of bacon instead of using the bacon bits. It was beyond good. I added scallions and shredded mild cheddar cheese on top. Pretty much the best soup i ever had!!!! Such good flavor! Better than any restaurant soup ive had. U gotta try this!!!!!!

Great recipe, after cooking I like to mash some of the potatoes for thicker soup, we like diced ham added to the mix. Other than that I followed the recipe. Good stuff :)

I made this recipe in a whim for the first time. I had to have something for a school function that lots of palates would enjoy; and wow, they sure did! 
This recipe is straightforward and easy to follow, although I did make a few shortcuts to save time. They are listed as follows, but I'm sure the original would just as tasty:

Substitute 1# of bacon for a 6oz package of precooked bacon, and cut with scissors into the soup.
Substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour (thickens faster) and replace the 1 cup of heavy cream with half a cup of milk and half a cup of sour cream.

This didn't get thick for me, so I whisked some flour in with the 1/2 & 1/2 before adding.  It was OK, but I prefer another recipe on here - Slow Cooker Creamy Potato soup.  I will stick to that - though I may try adding the dry ranch mix to that for a little flavor boost.

we threw in some pre-cooked chicken andouille sausage and used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. Turned out amazing - nice level of spice and a hint of smokiness. Also helped make it slightly healthier. Totally will make this again.

Thank you for posting!  This may be the best thing to ever come out of my slow cooker.  I didn't have chicken boullion, so I substituted 3 cups of lower sodium chicken broth and added a bay leaf. I also added about 1/2 cup of frozen corn, defrosted and 1 celery stalk, chopped.  This gave the soup some color and made it even heartier.  I crumbled cooked  bacon on top of each bowl of soup (along with cheddar and green onion) instead of cooking it in the soup, just out of personal preference.  It was so delicious and perfect on this cold and rainy day!  I'll be making this soup often this winter.

I loved this soup - very filling and perfect on a cold winter night.
I modified the recipe to make it vegetarian-friendly, using veggie boullion in place of chicken, and frying bacon separately to add to the bowls of those at the table who eat meat. It worked very well.

LOVED!!!  Quick and easy.  Three small changes, just because that's all i had in the house; Did real bacon instead of bacon bits, did 6 bouillon cubes instead of bouillon granules and did yellow onion instead of red.

Love this recipe.  I did add a dollop of sour cream when I sprinkled on the cheese and green onions.  Perfection!  And even better the next day!  Will definitely be in my recipe rotation.

We have made this base recipe a few different ways now.. different kinds of potatoes, different add-ons. Generally I don't use ranch simply because we don't have it and I can't be bothered to make it. It is great without it :) I also don't have seasoning salt right now somehow, so I just put in paprika & salt. Still good. We prefer it with freshly cooked bacon added at the end to give it a little crunch, and the girls in the family like to add broccoli at the end. I love how easy it is to modify! Thanks for a great recipe; it is so hard to find meals everyone in the family likes.

I doubled it as well, it tastes good but looks yucky.  It turns a pinkish color from the bacon. I cut the potatoes small so it was done within 4 hours on high. I'm sure i would make it again.

Delicious on a cold winter night! I made the soup according to the recipe but did not include bacon bits at the beginning because we like the chewy/crunchy nature of freshly fried bacon pieces (used 8 slices diced and fried). At the end also added 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 bunch diced green onions and also increased the cheese - 2 cups Sharp cheddar - added into the soup. No need to add anything at the table.

Made this for my family this past weekend and my husband gave me two thumbs up and said I can make it again!  My son said it was awesome!  The only thing I would do is add some more seasoning as in salt and pepper to taste!  I made ham and cheddar crescent roll ups to go along with the soup and it was perfect together!  Perfect cold and rainy weather meal!  Will make again....SOON!

This is fabulous! To get a great texture, I pureed about 2/3 of the potato cubes in the blender right at the end when I added the cream.  We'll be making this one again.

I made this recipe today.  It turned out with a really good flavor, but I did have to make some adjustments.  When I put everything in the crockpot, the amount of water called for did not even cover the potatoes, so I added about twice as much.  When I was ready to add the milk, I noticed it wasn't as thick as I was hoping for.  I decided to stir some more flour into my milk to thicken (however this led to some lumps of flour I had to skim off).  I had some leftover mashed potatoes in the fridge, which I heated up and stirred in to the soup and this provided the thickness I was looking for.  I think in the future (when I may not have leftover mashed potatoes on hand) I would just add additional flour to the potatoes when putting everything in the crockpot.  Also, I used 2% milk instead of half and half because I did not want all the calories and fat of the half and half.

I was not enthused by the texture of the bacon bits having been cooked in the soup. If ever I make this again, I think I would leave them as a garnish with the cheese and green onion. Otherwise, it came out alright. I mean, it's potato soup. It tasted like potato soup.

The soup was good, however, I didn't have any ranch dressing mix on hand so made some using the recipe found in the comments of the original recipe writer.  WAY too much dill -  ruined the soup for me.  I made two more batches of ranch mix with NO dill and mixed them together so now I have a lifetime supply, but at least it's usable now.

After a couple of days of potato soup, I added some celery, more bacon and a can of chopped clams to the leftovers and called it clam chowder :)

I thought this was very good.  I'm not a fan of bacon bits, but aside from that, this was my choice to try a crockpot potato soup.  I used diced ham instead of bacon bits and used cooked crumbled 'real' bacon as a garnish. I also wanted this to be 'meatier' for my husband's taste, so that is another reason I used diced ham. I did not have the Ranch dressing mix, but I"m going to try it with that the next time I make this. I used the entire 3 lb bag of small red potatoes.  I did mash up the potatoes a bit with a manual potato masher after I added the milk, which thickened up the soup perfectly.

This soup was wonderful. I actually only used seven potatoes, and I wanted a little more liquid contents so I added two extra cups of water and an extra half a cup of half-and-half. I didn't have a red onion so I just added 1 teaspoon of onion powder. I fried a pound of bacon and cut into pieces and added that instead of bacon bits.  This recipe was a winner with the family. Will definitely be making again.

Absolutely delicious and reheated great. I did cook my own bacon and added some cubed ham to the recipe, I think it turned the soup from a good side to a good meal.

This is super yummy once you make a few small adjustments.
It was very salty to me.  Once I made the adjustments it is amazing and my kids can't get enough.  I make this one every week.
So the adjustments I made were, No season salt, no chicken bullion, and instead of Water I use Chicken Broth.

I followed the recipe exactly. I loved using the bacon bits, because it still gave the soup that yummy bacon flavor without having to fuss with cooking bacon. My main problem with the soup is that it is too thick for my liking. I also put some up to freeze, and it doesn't reheat very well. There is water and the potato that doesn't mix as well when you reheat...kind of a potato slush.

Made exactly as written, except I halved everything because I was making it just for myself.  Soup is VERY salty - next time I'm leaving out the seasoned salt and adding bacon to each individual bowl. Also there's a lot of onion in it, with the ranch mix (I made the mix the author of this recipe suggested - The-Baby-Bow-Lady comment) and the onion in the soup and the garnish of green onions - my stomach was a little upset, so next time I'm cutting down on them also. I think this soup sort of tasted like clam chowder without the clams. I'm going to try adding clam juice and chopped clams. It's very easy to prepare, and cooking it in the slow cooker took only about 4 hours total, 2 1/2 on high, and 1 1/2 on low, maybe because I cut my potatoes up into small bite sized chunks.

OMG, this was amazing soup. I was a little skeptical at first since it seems so simple but the flavor is so good. I did make my own bacon crumbles, and I used 1 can of chicken broth along with the water and cut back the bouillon to 1 tbsp. I added more water as it was cooking because I thought it was too salty. I did omit the extra salt. Next time I think I will use low sodium chicken broth and cut out the bouillon to keep it from getting too salty.

This was the best potato soup recipe I've ever tried.  I stuck to the recipe as this was my first try.  For bacon bits, I chopped up hickory-smoked bacon slices and fried them first.  I liked how the recipe read and wanted leftovers so I doubled up on everything. I set my slow cooker for LOW for 7 hours as I had time.  Next time I'll try HIGH for 4-5 hours as suggted.  The soup was SO delicious and hearty.  TIP - I would not normally use full fat half and half but this recipe certainly calls for it.  I would imagine you would lose the thickness and creaminess with a low fat or fat-free substitute.  Try it!  You will love it!

I tried this recipe out on Friday because it sounded like the ideal hearty meal on a cold snowy day. It turned out fantastic! I had doubled the recipe and did a lot of the suggests ChefESQ made in their review, except I did not add the Velveeta cheese. 

I did buy bacon at the store (I purchased a free-range bacon) and cooked up the whole packet. I also, quickly, sauteed the onions in a bit of the leftover bacon fat for added bacon flavour. I also used 3 vegetable bouillon cubes instead of powdered chicken bouillon because I didn't want too much salt or too much of a chicken flavour. I also used a salt-free chicken broth, because a lot of comments mentioned the soup being a little too salty. As for the salt, I just sprinkled to taste instead of measuring it out. Also, when doubling the recipe, I did not double the parsley, I just added a bit more than the original amount required. 

Overall, it was AMAZING. I cooked it on high for 5 hours, then another 20 minutes after adding the cream (I used 15% table cream - 473ml - an half a cup of milk). My boyfriend had three bowls and my dad, right off the bat, said that the recipe was a keeper. I love the added cheese and green onions at the end, it was the perfect little addition. 

5/5, I will definitely make this again. :)

Followed recipe as written.  My husband and I really liked it.  Only change I would personally make would be to reduce red onion by half.  A bit too much of an onion taste for us.  But, again, overall good.  Thanks for posting.

This was excellent! I doubled the recipe to serve my large family and everyone loved it (and that's saying something since everyone in the house is a picky eater but me). Definitely something I'll do again. Had to tack on a couple extra hours in the crock pot for all the potatoes to get right, but like I said I doubled up on the recipe.

Made this soup for Sunday dinner for the family! Everyone thought it tasted great, like a baked potato!  We added a dollop of sour cream! Thanks for posting this recipe!

Easy simple delicious recipe. I used russet potatoes instead of red. I didn't have bacon but the soup tasted just fine. I had left over duck broth and used that in place of chicken bouillon. I cooked on high for 4 hours. I added kale 1/2 hour before it was done and the kale added complimentary flavor to the soup. I accidentally added a packet of ranch instead of 2 tablespoons so I added an extra couple of cups of waters. I used shredded harvarti instead of cheddar and the flavor of the cheese complimented the flavor of kale. All in all a great recipe.

I made it as written, but added carrots and broccoli just to get a few veggies in. I had fresh parsley so I used it, and substituted chicken broth because I didn't have bullion, I think both substitution were minor and did not affect the recipe. Family loved it! Easy to make, tastes great as it is written. Next time I may tweak it a little to meet my tastes, but its a can't lose easy meal to make out of things you have on-hand. I also cooked on high 5 hours and it turned out perfect.

This soup was so delicious! I had some spicy sausage links in my freezer I wanted to use so I sauteed it with the onion, garlic, and bacon. I also used fat-free half-n-half and couldn't tell the difference. My partner says it's a winner and to make it more often.

A tip for those who don't eat flour: I pureed a raw russet potato in the Vitamix and threw it in with the other ingredients - it came out plenty thick.  I'm sure you could use your cheesegrater or a packet of frozen hash browns as well.

This recipe is soooo delicious!  I doubled the recipe, using about 7 cups swanson broth rather than water and bullion cubes.  Around the last hour of cooking I added a hunk of velveeta cheese with the 1/2 and 1/2.  Topped with green onions and cheddar cheese and served with rolls. My family devoured this soup and I will definitely make it again.

I used "beer n bratwurst" sausages (cut into small pieces) instead of bacon bits and it worked great! I also grilled the extra sausages, cut them into small pieces, then baked them a little to give them some crunch. I put these along with the shredded cheese so that each person can add as much as they like after serving. By the way I just bought my slow cooker and this was the second thing I made with it, so I would agree with the 'easy' part :) Oh by the way its VERY filling. I made it as one of three courses, and everyone practically ignored everything else and filled up on the soup. So I suggest serving light sides.

This is greaat!  Skipped only the seasoned salt since the bacon gives it salt.  My family loves it and also my Aunt who doesn't typically care for potato soup.  I did add more garlic but I almost always do.

Such an easy and delicious soup! I didn’t have any red potatoes so I substituted them for about 6-7 peeled regular Idaho potatoes and it’s still turned out wonderfully. So far this is my favorite recipe to make in my slow cooker and I will definitely be making it again.

I loved this recipe and so did my husband! The fact that it was made in the crock pot made it even better! It's one of those that will definitely be on the remake list when fall/winter gets here! 
I didn't have any trouble getting it to thicken up. I just put in the half and half at the 7 1/2 hour mark, and let it thicken for 30 minutes instead of 15. That's the only change I made to the recipe.

AMAZING! I tripled the recipe to feed a party of 21 and everyone said it was better then Olive Gardens Zuppa Toscana. I replaced the water with Chicken Broth and added a little extra of each of the seasonings, especially fresh minced garlic which I quadrupled.  
Super easy to make!!! 
This will definitely be added as a family favorite.

Delicious!! I omitted the chicken bouillon as I didn't have any and added diced ham and corn. Also mashed the potatoes some when it was done and it made the consistency perfect! Will definitely be making again.

The best soup ever. Only changes I made was I used 1,5 cups of reduced sodium chicken broth and 1.5 cups of water, and I also did not add the extra season salt.

This was amazing!! Instead of water and chicken bouillon, I used 3 cups of chicken broth. By accident I added 2 cups (1pint) of half n half, but it turned out perfect. I let it cook uncovered on high for about 15 min and that thickened the soup. This is definitely be made again.

I followed the recipe exactly, but found the soup to be really salty. Maybe it was the bacon? And too much dill for my taste, and perhaps too much seasoning (I made my own ranch mix per the recipe owner's suggestion). Not really a traditional potato soup in my opinion.

I peeled ALL my spuds, so will not do that next time. Only 1/2 I think. I used 1 tbls of minced garlic from the jar and 2 envelopes of chicken bouillion. I also used 1/2 cup of ranch dressing from the jar. Was afraid of it being salty so caut back to 3/4 but will go full bore next time. My pepper was butchers which is much more coarse than the fine ground. I also used 1 cuo chicken broth low sodium plus 2 cuos of water. Cooked on high 5 hrs. Great but needs the bacon which I didn't have on hand. Left overs will have the oink.
I would like to know the approx wt of 10 red poatoes because some of mine are huge (Idaho size)and I may have had more potatoes which would have watered down the tast. Still a 4 on the way to 5

This actually tasted pretty good. It just LOOKS disgusting. It is also too liquidy and watery.

DH says this is his favorite soup I have ever made. I used about a half a pound of fresh bacon crumbled, and half a pound of sausage. 7 hours was plenty of time to get the potatoes nice and soft.

It's a keeper! I've made it three times and the third time was the charm. I use chicken broth in place of the water and bullion and since I'm wheat-free I used sweet rice flour in place of the ap flour. The biggest reason I switched out the bullion for broth is it was too salty with the bullion.

WOW, this recipe was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. I love that it doesn't require as much milk and is easy to assemble and throw in the crockpot so that it can cook itself. I would have never thought to use ranch dressing mix and this made a huge difference in the taste.

The crispy bacon in the soup adds great flavour.  I used my immersion blender for a few spins to make it a smoother texture and also topped it with sour cream, cheese, green onions or chives, and bacon (whatever you'd put on a baked potato!).  Great hearty soup!

This is super!! I used 8 medium red potatoes. I would recommend peeling some of them. I didn't peel them and the soup has a lot of red skins in it. But they are healthy! I used 6 tbsp of flour. That and the breakdown of the cooked potatoes made it a perfect consistency. I put in 4 tsp parsley and only one chicken bullion cube. Was careful about salt because of previous comments about it being too salty. I did, however, put in 2 tsp. seasoned salt. I put in 2 tsp. black pepper and that gave it a wonderful zing. And I put in 2 cups of half and half at the end. Adding the toppings makes a great presentation, as well as adding great flavor. The dolllup of sour cream on top is beautiful and adds a perfect baked potato flavor. I will definitely save and make this soup often. It is very filling!

This was soooo good! I noticed the video was a little different from the written instructions. They shot the video using the Baby-Bow-Lady's suggestions, so I pretty-much followed that.

Many users mentioned the soup being too salty, so I decided to just use low-sodium chicken broth, no bullion.I also omitted the season salt, garlic and the red onion; didn't think it was needed since I would be using the green onions and dry ranch dressing.

Other than that I pretty-much followed the recipe. I was very generous with the bacon and I did chop and brown some smoked sausage into mine to make it more meaty. That may have added a bit of saltiness, but no more than I'd taste with a regular baked potato in my opinion.

One reviewer mentioned giving your soup more time to thicken after you add the half-in-half, and I was glad I saw it! That may be why it's turning out too thin for some. I thought I had ruined mine because it was so thin when it came time to add the half-in-half. But after a little more cooking and stirring time (mostly with the lid off) it thickened to the perfect consistency. Creamy, hearty and delicious. Even better then next day. My girlfriend was definitely impressed!

I just had a bowl of this soup! I love it. I adjustedto 12 servings which filled my large crockpot. I followed the recipe mashed the spuds before adding the half & half and added some instant potatos because I like thick soup. I do not know if I was suppose to peel the potatos but I did not since I like to keep the vitamins. Yes it is salty but I expect my soups to be salty. I would adjust a tad next time to decrease it just a bit.Cooked on high as I started late. I am having surgery and I thought this would freeze well for a quick meal post op.

Great recipe! Thanks! I've made it twice now. I used real bacon (1 pound, pre cooked and cut into 1-inch squares) instead of bacon bits to really bring out the bacon flavour and I substituted the Ranch dressing for Ceasar dressing - the first time because I didn't have any Ranch dressing and the second time because it tasted great!

Made this tonight and oh my goodness. Yummers.
alterations:
Didnt really measure stuff. Eyed balled and was generous.
Crumbled 3 ck bullion cubes instead of granules.
Minced garlic instead of clove. 
Cajun season salt.
Added half bag of Jimmy deans precooked turkey sausage crumbles.
2.3 oz bag of peppered real bacon bits.
Didnt use crock pot but rather piled it all in my large soup pot. Brought to a boil. Then Simmered til potatoes were done. Follow other instructions as per recipe,  I just impovised mine a bit!

If you have made it this far through the reviews, stop and add give this recipe a try.  It was definitely easy, and the flavor was great!  My only modification was the amount of bacon...I used about a cup (12 strips) instead of 3/4.

This was good. The kids really liked it. I have another Potato soup recipe from this site we love (Baked Potato Soup V) even more though. Thought I would try this one since it involved the crock pot. I made make a few modifications and try this again, but if I'm really craving Potato soup would probably make my other one.

Easy to make, smells delicious while cooking. When I make it again I will skip on the salt the bacon bits do enough for adding saltiness to it. Very good I recommend!

This turned out really delicious! I didn't use ranch dressing mix though, I used a little more chicken bouillon (3 tbsp) and mixed a tbsp of corn starch to a little cold water and put that in. I used regular salt instead of season salt and added cumin and a little chili pepper for some bite. Instead of parsley I used Italian seasoning. Also I used 5 cups water instead of 3. And 8 red potatoes instead of 10, mozzarella instead of cheddar. Really yummy

I made this recipe exactly the way it was written except for the red onions which I didn't have on hand and I used russet potatoes instead of red because it's what I had. I used about 5 of those. Super yummy! Flavorful and filling. A lot of people said they actually cooked bacon instead of using the precooked kind and said not to add it til the end as a garnish but I used the precooked and it was fine adding it in at the beginning. Loved it and will definitely be making it again this fall and winter.

We like potato soup but I don't make it too often because my other recipes are labor intensive. This soup was fantastic, good flavor, and minimal prep. With this recipe in the arsenal I see my family enjoying potato soup more often.

So scrumptious! I pretty much followed the recipe. I didn't have seasoned salt on hand so I made my own (look online for recipe). I also couldn't find real bacon bits so I fried up my own bacon and then chopped them into little piece. I think using freshly cooked bacon gives a more flavorful soup. Only suggestion that I have is to chop the potatoes into smaller pieces (approximately 1 inch cubes or less) so that all the potatoes cook evenly and it's easier to eat.

So good!  I followed the recipe exactly except had to use 1/2 cup of evaporated milk and 1/2 cup of milk because I didn't have any half and half.  Rich and delicious!!!

This was a simple and delicious soup! Since I didn't have the exact ingredients, I did switch out a few things.  I used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  I also switched out the water for low-sodium chicken broth and the bouillon cubes for the Swanson's Flavor Boost packet.  Finally, when it was about done, it still had not thickened up, so I made a quick roux and added it at the end.  It was perfect!!!

Loved it but I made a few changes --
1. Instead of 3 cups of water, I used 1 can of condensed cream of chicken and then 2 cups of water.
2. I used 2 cubes of chicken bouillon instead of the crushed kind.
3. I left out the bacon bits and added real bacon at the end when you add in the half and half.

Turned out AMAZING and my husband loves it. (:

Cannot consider it baked as the red potatoes were raw and I peeled them.  No salt and blended it up for Mother in my new Vitamix after it cooked, awesome!!!!  Just a bit more garlic added but that was it.

I don't know what went wrong here, but this tasted SO strange to me. I followed the directions exactly aside from adding about 1/2 less red onion than stated in the recipe (my onion was a little big, but the total amount I used would have been less than 1 small red onion). Still, the finished product tasted way too oniony (I like onions, so it's not just my preference).  I like the concept of this dish, but I think it would improve tremendously if white onion (or maybe even scallions) were used instead of red. I also think the ranch seasoning made it taste a little odd. If I make this recipe again, I'll cut back on the ranch seasoning and substitute the red onion with scallions or a small amount of chopped white onion.

This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for. I made a few minor changes, I omitted the onion because I don't like onion and I replaced the bacon bits with thick cut bacon I pan fried myself and instead of bullion I used Knorr homestyle concentrated stock and I peeled the potatoes.  My changes were based on personal preference and what I already had on hand.  With that aside, I'm thrilled I tried this recipe and thank you for sharing it!  The smell as it cooked in the crock pot was amazing, I wanted to eat it hours before it was even ready because of the smell alone.  The half and half at the end really pulled it together nicely.  I like that I know what's in it vs a canned soup on the store shelf.  This did make wonderful leftovers, it thickened upon sitting in the fridge so I added milk to it and voila!  I had a nice leftover piping hot bowl of potato soup!  I shared this recipe with friends and within days they tried it and said they too loved it!!!  This recipe is a keeper!  Like everyone else said this doesn't photograph well and tastes better than it looks. :)

Delicious! The only thing I changed was using real, cooked and crumbled bacon. Even my super-picky kids loved it. It will be added to our regular rotation!

The was the first time I made potato soup and it was great! Instead of the bacon bits, I cooked up some bacon I had and added it to the pot. I also added roasted garlic, delicious. It's a keeper.

Very good!  My Husband, who is a big " meat and potato "guy, ( not usually a fan of soup) LOVED it!  Also, a picky teenager and young one ,went back for seconds, as well!  Just for note, I had 3 different types of potatoes on hand, so I just used those- and it was still very good!  I, also, only had real bacon.  This was so  easy to prepare-!  Thanks for a good recipe!

This recipe is the best! I don't normally spend time reviewing recipes, but this one was too good not to give it 5 stars.  I have made it multiple times and I have to ask my wife to save me at least one bowl.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I LOVED this but I have to admit I changed some stuff even though I didnt intend to. 
I used only 1 bouillon cube because I used mostly chicken broth instead of water. I also added some celery and a cup of frozen mixed veggies to try and trick the baby...  stirred cheese into the whole pot at the end. Was AMA

Great flavor. As a novice cook I didn’t cut my potatoes small enough. It was a little too thick for me since most of the water cooked out but I think that was because it was on warm for so long. Worth a try.

Made per directions, only exception was that I fried and crumbled my own bacon.   Odd flavor, very salty.  Some people complained of this being too watery, mine was very thick-?  Wasn't inedible, but will not be making again.

Amazing recipe. I modified it a tiny bit. Added 4 chicken breast shredded to the crockpot as it started cook. Used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of cubes. But it turned out amazing and even my picky eaters enjoyed the meal

Very good soup! We ate it up! I would add an extra 1 cup of water next time to have more liquid, but that's more of a prefer thing. I stopped my slow cooker at 7 hours.

This is my new favorite potato soup recipe.  Four hours on high did the trick for me. I diced and dropped in eight ounces of Velveeta for a cheesy twist, and it was excellent. Without the cheese, it was excellent too.  I did use chicken broth rather than water. This recipe tastes rich and delicious. It's my new go-to potato soup recipe.

Alot reviews noted that soup was too thin so I took out half of the potatoes and used an immersion blender and pureed the rest of potatoes. Then added the half & half and the potato pieces back in. Turned out pretty good

3 cups of water were no where near what this needed. I ended up adding 3 additional cups of water because it was soooo salty. I was trying to dilute the salt since that's all I could taste. If I make it again, I will cut the chicken boullion down to 2 tsps. and eliminate the seasoned salt.

A fantastic recipe. When we made it, we got large red potatoes instead of baby potatoes. As a result, we had to double the rest of the ingredients except for the potatoes and onion. It still turned out really well.

Our family of five loved this soup. Per other reviewers I did mash some of the potatoes and it created the perfect thickness for us. Since this was my first time making this recipe, I made this recipe as is and it came out wonderful. Next time I make this soup I will try adding some kielbasa sausage to the soup.

Turned out awesome. I didn't think at first there was enough water or broth so I added more and I was in a rush so I cooked it on high. Stir more frequently if you cook it in high but other than that it turned out fantastic. Will be making this again

Loved this soup!  Instead of bouillon & water I used 32oz Unsalted chicken stock & 24 oz regular chicken stock.  After 5 hours in the crockpot on low the potatoes were still too firm so I switched it up to high but it still required another 6 hours of cook time.  I shared some with my neighbor & she loved it so much she is supplying double the potatoes next week so I can make it again.  My husband says it's the perfect consistency for saltines or oyster crackers.

I thought this was pretty bland, but I omitted the ranch mix because my husband doesn’t like ranch.  Maybe that caused the blandness.  He liked this so I’ll make it again.

I have made this soup several times, and it is great. I think the secret ingredient is the ranch dressing (and the pre-cooked bacon, usually in your cupboard along with a packet of ranch).  It really does taste like a fully dressed baked potato. One of my faves.  Cheers, Kent

I made this pretty close to the recipe.  I used yukon gold potatoes instead red and cilantro instead of parsley.  It was excellent so it will be made again soon.

This was a good soup. It definitely didn't "wow" anyone at my house, though.  I used chicken broth instead of water and chicken granules, because that's what I had on hand.

Delicious. I added about 2 more cups of broth as it was VERY thick. I may have used 10 larger red potatoes. I added fresh crumbled bacon on top of each bowl rather than adding during cooking. The flavor was great. Will definitely make again!

When I first made the soup, I was unimpressed. I waited a day and then gave it another shot. I put batches of the soup into my Cuisinart and pulsed the soup until it was in small chunks. I also added some cheddar cheese as well. After that, it was SO GOOD!! I made the soup as per the recipe, just leaving out the bacon. I followed everything else exactly. I cannot overstate how amazingly wonderful it was after sitting a day and going through the food processor. I will definitely make again!!

I did have to add more water as it cooked, probably because my crock pot is a 6-quart so I think it cooked a little faster than what the recipe stated.   Very good and easy to throw together.  Will definitely make it again.

This is the best soup! I make it at least once a month, even in the summer because I crave it. It is perfect. It’s creamy, savory, but light and so flavorful. Recipe just how it is!

Wonderful soup.....should not have had a second helping, but we couldn't resist.  I cooked on high for the first 2 hours, and then put on low until the potatoes were very tender.  It was 3-4 hours tops.  I actually put my masher in the crock and mushed a little just to make it a bit more  thick.   Will make again!  Thank you.

Doubled the recipe, then in step 4, cooked for 10 minutes on high in the Instant Pot, then five more minutes with the half-and-half. Tasted absolutely delicious!

This was excellent. Followed recipe exactly as written with exception of seasoned salt which I did not have on hand. Used a garlic sea salt/parsley mix in place of the seasoned salt. Broth consistency was perfect. Hubs absolutely loved it. I did garnish with the scallion and shredded cheddar cheese. Tasted exactly like a loaded baked potato. New England has been in a deep freeze for several days with sub zero wind chills. This 
soup hit the spot.

I did add some ham because I had some left over and used chicken broth instead of the chicken bouillon and water.  I like my soup thicker so I used more potatoes and mashed some of them roughly at the end.  It was delicious!  My husband and 4 kids gobbled it up!

Used 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water, a little extra ranch seasoning and 1 cup cheddar cheese. I used a few more potatoes and ended up making a cold slurry with corn starch to give it a little more thickness since I added extra liquid. This was so good. The ranch is a difference maker. Will make again and often.

It was delicious! I doubled the recipe so I used half the amount of half and half and substituted fat free milk. was some runny, so used potato startch (didn't have corn startch). Used real bacon as opposed to bacon bits.  I try to use what I have on hand rather than use processed foods/ingredients.  Will be making his again!

Everyone from 2 to 67 loved this soup! Easy to make for the whole crowd. The only changes I made was I cooked the onion ahead of time, didn't use the parsley, and added some carrots. It was yummy and I'll make it again!

Loved this recipe! I only made a couple minor alterations - i used 10 medium-large size potatoes, 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the water, a little extra ranch dressing seasoning, and 1 1/2 cups half & half. I cooked it for about 11 hours on low before adding the half & half, and then another half hour. It was perfect! I will be definitely be making this one again!

I added a little more ranch mix and season salt. I used white pepper and chicken broth instead of black pepper, bullion cubes and water. I used heavy cream (instead of half and half) and mashed it with a fork before starting the last 15 min. The result was creamy deliciousness!!

This is a staple in our house during the winter months when you want to come home from work and have a ready to go meal.
I cut way back on the salt because I found it too salty the first time I made it... but that might have to do with ham and bacon I added.
I don't use red onion because it turns the soup pink for me. Any time I make a ham I vacuum pack and freeze the smaller trimmings and will throw them into the soup to make it meaty. Maybe a half cup or more depending on how much bacon I'm using. If I made and froze ham stock I'll replace some of the water with that and cut back on the bouillon. 
We serve with a fresh-cooked take and bake baguette.

Really delicious! The only changes I made were to omit the onion, because everyone in my family hates onions except me, and I used a few slices of cooked, chopped bacon in place of the bacon bits because it was what I had on hand. This was really great comfort food on a cold day, and I will definitely keep it in the rotation for winter.

Great soup!!! Made this tonight. I am sick so I needed something easy, as my husband was doing all the prep (chopping potatos/onions etc) while I directed him from bed. On another reviewer's suggestion we added smoked sausage, and I used corn starch to thicken up the soup. it was GREAT! WILL definitely make again.

Super easy!! Instead of the bouillon granules and water, i used chicken broth. Also, this recipe makes a very small batch, i would recommend at least doubling for a family of 4.

Wow, this was so tasty! I will definitely make it again. I followed the advice of the author and added 8 oz of velveeta. I also added the whole ranch season pkt, 6 bouillon, and a bag of frozen veg (broccoli, carrots, and cauliflower). After 7 hours  I used a slotted spoon to remove the veggies and some of the potatoes and blended the soup with an immersion blender. I added everything back in and proceeded as directed. I skipped the bacon and added 1 lb of ham. The soup turned out lovely and partner loved it as well. This one is going into regular rotation. Thank you for sharing!

This is my favorite recipe for Potato soup.  I've made it over and over and never get tired of it.  I've also received many compliments on how good it is.  I  had to make some changes because I am lactose intolerant.  I didn't use the cream or cheese.  Instead, towards the end of the cooking time, I scooped out about a half cup of potatoes with a slotted spoon and blended them.  Then I poured this thick mixture back into the soup and it thickened it nicely.  Instead of the bacon bits I use a small piece of salt pork, chopped in small bits and a ham hock.  I browned them first then put them in the soup at the beginning of the cooking time.  I didn't use salt because the salt pork adds enough salty flavor.  Now and then I like to add a minced green or red bell pepper in the last hour.  Delicious!

This is fabulous.  For those that said it was watery, there are a couple easy things you can do to fix that. One, use a potato masher to mash it for a few seconds, before adding the cream, so the potatoes break up. Also, you can use whipping cream instead of half and half. I used heavy cream and 2%.   I did use ham instead of bacon, because I had some to use up. But in terms of ingredients, I did it as written, other than subbing the ham.  The only thing I would do next time is maybe cut out the salty ingredients a bit, or just not use the seasoned salt at all.  It is delicious, but it's also pretty salty, as others have mentioned.  But the texture is perfect with the mashing and cream used, and the smell while cooking is wonderful.

When this went in the crock I thought no way this was gonna work out but it turned out terrific.  Love that it is light on creams.  Mine did not come out runny at all like some have said.  everyone loved it.  I cooked freshed bacon and used 2 bullion cubes instead of granules because i did not know what that was.  So pretty much as exact as I could and it was great.  does not make enough though, make 1.5 recipe or 2x next time.  will make again for sure

This soup was way too salty and not creamy at all like baked potato soup should be. It's disappointing when you have to throw out an entire crock pot of food.

Used almost 3lbs of red potatoes (peeled), 4 extra large bouillon cubes.  Next time I need to use less bouillon or not add the salt as it was incredibly salty.  Still thought it was a good recipe!

This was super-easy to make and came out well, with almost everyone giving it high praises.  The creamy consistency of both the potatoes and the soup itself was excellent.  Could it have used more spices?  Depends on your taste... I had no complaints but I'm sure I could have added more bacon and some additional seasonings without harming the body of the recipe.  The soup was definitely not watery and 10 hours on low produced just the right amount of softness for the potatoes.  For those who like more of a stew consistency, all you need to do is increase the flour you coat the potatoes with in the beginning.  Lovely recipe-

I halved most of the recipe and added some chicken breasts, then shredded them with a fork before adding the half and half at the end. I left the lid off to let it thicken. Turned out quite yummy.

This was so easy and "quite tasty" as my grandson puts it.  I followed the recipe exactly. The only modification I made was to cook on high for a couple of hours then turned to low for a couple more hours because I got started late and didn't have 7 hours to cook but it turned out great anyway.

My husband raved about this. It is the easiest potato soup ever.  I did make a few subs.  I had Yukon gold potatoes so used them, in place of bouillon and water I used chicken broth, I made my own ranch dressing mix, my flour was gluten free, and I used 1/2 tsp seasoned salt. When it was done I mashed some of the potatoes to make it thicker.  Leftovers are wonderful as well and would freeze well.

This was amazing, I did tweak it a bit. Instead of chicken bouillon, I used beef broth. I used 1 3/4 Cup broth-since that is what I had leftover in the fridge from a previous recipe, then reduced the water to 1 1/4 Cup. This turned out so thick and creamy. I will be making it again very soon!!

I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the bouillon and water, omitted the season salt (MSG) and added 1/2 tsp salt and it turned out great. The second time I took out some of the potatoes and mashed them and added them back in. Both ways were equally good in my opinion.

Very good recipe. I cooked it on high for about 3 hours because I started it too late. It came out fine at that cooking time.  I used about 6 large russet potatoes because that's what I had on hand and I used a regular onion instead of red onion.  And lastly I puréed about 1/4 of the potatoes just before adding the half and half to thicken up the soup. This was a really nice soup and my husband really raved about it, which he doesn't often too.

Loved the recipe.  Used chicken broth instead of water and only 1 tbsp chicken flavoring.  Also cut up 1 bacon strip and fried it first always prefer bacon for flavor in most all soup recipes. A keeper for sure.

My changes:
7 medium russett potatoes,  peeled and cubed.
1 pound mild pork sausage  (instead of bacon), browned and added the last 2 hours of cooking. 
I added too much of the bouillon and dressing mix so had to add extra water to tone down the saltiness.  This worked out just fine as after mashing some of the potatoes the soup was very thick, just the way I like it.
I am giving 5 stars because my changes were minor and am sure it would be great as written  for those that like bacon in their soups.

This was good but a little salty for our taste. Next time I make it I'm going to omit the season salt, chicken granules and water and replace it with 3 cups of either homemade chicken broth  or low sodium . We will see if that does the trick.

Super easy to make. I did it on high over 4 hours. The only thing I wish is that it specified how many cups of potatoes because red potatoes come in all sizes. I just added more until it looked like enough (probably 7?) because some were so much bigger than others.

better than I expected. didn't have the ranch mix, so just used available herbs. closed - but not tight for some evaporation- for 6hrs in cooker, added (eye-balled) heavy cream, frozen corn, green onions at end. if still too watery- thicken w/corn starch. 
hearty like a stew/soup.

on stove top, I chop the (white & sweet) potatoes smaller to quicken cooking time to 40 min.

I love this recipe! I can't have dairy so I substituted soy milk for the half & half, and used lactose free cheddar.

Love this recipe. It's easy and tastes great. I did add chopped celery and two bay leaves to suit my personal preferences. Husband and guests ate heartily barely leaving room for dessert!

My husband loved this soup. He went back for 3rds! I accidentally added the half and half in the beginning but it turned out fine. I didn't see a need to thicken it at the end as a lot of reviewers seemed to do. We topped ours with sour cream, sharp cheddar cheese, green onions, and bacon bits. I will definitely be making this again!

This soup was amazing.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written, except for only using slightly less bacon and it was so delicious.   I did take the others suggestions of mashing up the potatoes before adding the cream, which made it a thicker,  creamier texture. And because I procrastinated, I did have to cook on high.  It turned out great at about 5 hours.  I will for sure be making this again.  It was so easy!!

This was really yummy!  Thanks for sharing!  I followed the recipe except I only used 1 TBSP of chicken bullion, I used a white onion instead of a red, I threw 2 boneless chicken breasts in there for good measure (or protein), and I stirred in 8oz sour cream just because I wanted to.  :)  It turned out great!  I will be making this again!

When I make a recipe for the first time I find it's imperative to follow the directions as written. I must have added too much of the seasoned salt so we really couldn't enjoy it as we should have. I am going to give it another try and update my review at that time. Besides it being too salty for us the flavor, otherwise, was really good. I'm really hoping the next go round will be better. Thanks The-Baby-Bow-Lady for such an awesome recipe, I can't wait to try it again.

I made this recipe exactly as stated (minus the green onion at the end) and it turned out amazing! The only thing I wish I had done differently was cut the potatoes into smaller cubes. Other than that, I give it five stars!

I don't even know what to say except wow. Made the recipe pretty much like it said. A little extra onion and garlic plus 6 ounces of velvetta and a dab of sour cream and some fresh green onions. I'm basically speechless. Wow.

Delicious!  I made it as it was written, except we sprinkled bacon bits on afterwards so my vegetarian husband could eat it, too.  Loved it and plan on doing it again soon.

I loved the texture of the potatoes (not mushy) and the consistency of the soup, but  it is unbelievably SALTY!!!!!  Next time I make it I'm omitting the the chicken bouillon and water all together and using 3 cups of chicken stock instead.  Also, only use the seasoning salt very sparingly, if at all.

Great potato soup! I went exactly by the recipe except I used Idaho potatoes (about 5 large ones, cut into small nickel size cubes) instead of red potatoes,  and I did a mix of yellow and purple onion, turned out great! I filled the crock pot up till about half full with potatoes. Some people complained that the soup was thin, however by following the recipe it came out perfect. When you put the liquid in it doesn't quite cover the top of the potatoes but over time it evens out and becomes the perfect thickness. I cooked it on low for about 6 hours. Added shredded cheese, bacon bits, green onion and sour cream as garnish. Will definitely be making this again in the future.

the only change i made was i used beef bullion instead of chicken, because that's what i had on hand. I made this planning on eating half and freezing the other half, and between three people, two of which are picky eaters, we ate the entire batch. I'll definitely be making this one again.

This recipe is very tasty, but a bit salty as others have mentioned. I would just not add any salt at all if I were to make it again. I also took the advice of others and added in instant mashed potatoes to help thicken the soup a bit more, as it was very watery.

This was a hearty, and delicious meal to help my household recover from cold sesason! I used 3/4 cup half and half instead of a whole cup, because I didn't want it to be runny. Very filling, and tasty. Will definitely make this again.

Made this recipe in the crock pot a couple nights ago after a co worker sent me the recipe. This is an amazingly easy recipe. Took me about 20 mins to prep, I doubled the recipe. I made a substitution, added chicken broth instead of water. Let it cook on high for 4 hours, mashed up some of the potatos and cooked it for another hour. Mashed up more potatoes, added the half n half. Waited for about 30 mins and we were at the table

I made this for a office potluck and it went over so well that I have MANY people asking me for the recipe!
Iv made some recommendations to avoid problems. 
-Don't constantly stir it, as you add the ingredients, leave it all alone until the end when you add the Half and Half
-For those of you who complained that it was to salty you  either read the instructions wrong or probably used a high salt bacon.  I recommend a low sodium bacon.  Also its chicken bouillon granules NOT bouillon cubes. Use Season Salt, not regular salt and especially not sea salt.
-For those of you who complain its mushy, you either cubed your potatoes to small, or stirred your ingredients after adding them.  Dont!
-For those of you who say it was to watery,  you most likely used small red potatoes, next time make sure you used a Medium sized red potato. Will make a very big difference.
-For those who say it was to dry, just add a little more half and half stir it once and give it another half hour before serving.

O-M-G!!! This tastes like a loaded baked potato one you add the cheese and green onion.  I've made potato soup for years, but this is in a class of its own.  My soup came out thick and creamy. I was expecting the opposite after reading the reviews. I used 6 medium/large red potatoes cut into approx. 1 inch squares. I used 3 cups of boxed chicken broth. I cooked a full 4 hours before pureeing approx. 3/4 of the soup in a blender and adding the cup of half & half.  This soup is perfection!

I used baking potatoes, sweet onions and packaged chicken broth. I also omitted the ranch dressing. I got one of the squeeze sour cream containers and set it by the slow cooker so everyone could put their own dollop along with the cheese and green onions on the top. Good reviews; several asked for the recipe :)

I had been looking for a "restaurant quality" potato soup for awhile.  I thought the ingredients in this one made it seem tasty and easy to prepare.  It did not disappoint, I really enjoyed the soup paired with a ham sandwich to make it seem more like a meal.  The only changes I made were to the amounts of seasonings I used, I halved the seasoning salt (1/2 tsp.) and pepper (1/4 tsp.).  I also used chicken bouillon cubes instead of granules, and used 4 cubes which equates to about 1-1/2 tbsp instead of 2.  The rest of the recipe was verbatim.  It was very tasty and I plan to make it again.

I love potato soup and this is a great recipe to work off. 
I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also added more garlic and two bay leaves. 
I mashed the potatoes a bit at the end and When I added the half and half I also used a little instant mashed potatoes to help thicken it up. 
My husband loved this. And it was awesome the next day too!

I made this for our Potluck last week and got rave reviews! The only change I made was to use the bacon bits as garnish instead of cooking in the soup. Great recipe!

Love this soup!  It's one of the best potato soups out there and super easy which gains big points for me.  The only thing I add is cooked sausage towards the end.  This one is always a hit!    Thanks for sharing.

the basis of this easy soup is great. I made a few alterations: added carrots, celery, lots of green onion and a lot of parsley and fresh ground pepper. This recipe does not need any added seasoning salt. Also at the end I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it slightly. It was a big hit!

It is hard to determine how many potatoes to use - would be better if a number of cups of cubed potatoes were called for. I used 5 medium sized baking potatoes. The soup was too thick, just all potato. So I added a cup of water and a cup of half and half. I also cut the chicken boullion down to 4 tsp because the amout called for seemed like alot. This came out wonderful! I will definitely make it again with these changes. I'm sorry to post a review of the recipe when I didn't make it as stated. This is actually a huge pet peeve of mine, but since the website doesn't allow personal notes to be attached with a recipe, this is the only way to record my changes.

This was pretty good and easy to put together. I used fresh cooked bacon and cooked the onions in the grease breifly before adding to the pot. 

I didn't follow the layering step exactly. Husband put it in after I had left for work, so he tossed the potatoes and flour, then stirred the pre-prepped bowl with the remaining ingredients in with 4c water (then added half and half at the end). Definitely don't skip the cheese and chives on top.. They help!

This is in my crock pot as I type this.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it just smells sooo good!!  I can't wait to see what it tastes like!  I did make a slight mistake, and I'm hoping it still turns out ok.  I added the whole packet of dry ranch seasoning instead of the 1 Tbsp...oops...I guess we shall see :-).

Yummy, warming, and filling. I used Tex Joy Steak Seasoning as the seasoned salt. Think I used a little too much. It was a little too salty. Other than that it was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Definitely a family favorite. The calorie intake is a bit high. This served 6 of us so it was 530 calories a serving. I used minced dried onions and garlic powder instead of fresh as that's what I have on hand. Perfect recipe though.

Fantastic!! I used real bacon, and put about half in the soup, and saved the other half to sprinkle on top once I put the soup in the bowl.  I used the immersion blender to blend the potatoes up and make the soup thicker. 
I served with warm bread and butter!!!  One thing...I served this to my hubby and two boys and my hubby had two servings, and we still had leftovers.  This has more than just four servings.

Yum! I made this tonight for dinner with a few tweaks based on what I had on hand. I replaced the water with reduced-sodium chicken broth since I didn't have bullion. I also thickened it up at the end by  ladling out a cup of the broth, whisking in 3 tbs of flour, and adding it back to the crock pot. All in all it came out great, but next time I think I'll add the bacon at the end.

Delicious!  I threw this together earlier today but made a few changes based on previous reviewers.  I used corn starch instead of flour in hopes of thickening the soup.  I didn't have chicken bouillon, so I used "Better than Bouillon" instead.  I also used chicken stock instead of water.  I cooked it on high for about 5 hours.  I didn't incorporate bacon into the soup; instead, I cooked real bacon before serving it and garnished each bowl with the bacon.  I also didn't have any half and half, so I used cream instead.  I think the cream created a much less watery soup.  Everyone loved it, including my two daughters, who are VERY picky.  Put this in the "win" column.

Perfect for a cold winter day or anytime!  I was impressed that the potatoes were done perfectly and held their shape well even when reheating leftovers.  I didn't have bacon bits so I used a few strips of fully cooked packaged bacon and cut them into very small pieces and it flavored the soup nicely.

The best thing about this version of baked potato soup is that it is so easy.  My daughter has a better recipe for baked potato soup, but it is a little labor intensive.

Awesome!!! I don't like cutting regular onions and I don't buy fresh garlic, so I put dried minced onions and garlic powder. I don't measure the ground pepper. We love ground pepper

Came out perfect!!! Added some corn and celery(celery, 1 hour before it was done), used a package of thick cut bacon, left some for toppings of course. Cooked on high for 5 hours. Used low sodium broth, with 4.5 teaspoon of the bouillon powder. It was amazing!!

To address the comment that the soup was too thin, use an immersion blender to mash somd of the potatos.  It works perfectly.  Yummy stuff.

Not quite what I was looking for. Not much flavor for me, but the option to make it in a crock pot seemed like a great idea. I might try it again with more options to increase the flavor.

Very good and tasty soup, perfect for a cold winter night!  Both of my picky boys even enjoyed it.  I substituted whole milk instead of the half & half, and I added a cup of cheddar cheese to it the same time as when I added the milk.  Will definitely make again!

Always wanted to make potato soup but I was worried about it being bland.  This recipe is amazing!  A bit salty, but very flavorful!  I did add Velveeta cheese after the half and half and the thickness was perfect!

Totally delicious!! I made this soup on a cold and windy weekend, and it couldn't have been easier. I actually added a 4th cup of water because I didn't think I'd have enough broth, and I was left with a creamy, smooth, delicious soup. I left it on Low for about 5 hours (my crock pot is notoriously hot) and tried to mash up the potatoes once they were cooked, which yielded a velvety consistency...SO GOOD. I thought this soup had a ton of flavor, and I'll definitely be making it again!

This was easy and very good. Minor changes after reading all reviews. I used low sodium chicken broth vs bouillon , real bacon vs bits and did not use any season salt. Instead used healthy pinch of dill and parsley. At last min I added frozen corn 1/2 hour before I added half and half. It was not too salty nor too thin as some have complained. Next time will make a double recipe.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. So easy and quick to throw together. Like some others, I used real bacon and crumbled it. It gave the soup a nice smokey flavor. I also used low sodium chicken broth instead of boullion and water. The consistency was just right. Not to soupy and not real thick. Just right for my taste. Definitely a keeper.

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it.  My daughter tasted it and wanted some cheese in it, so I did end up adding some Velveeta after the half and half.  But, in my opinion, it really didn't need the cheese.  This is going in to the rotation.  Thanks!

Loved it!!! Added a little more onion and a little more ranch mix. Also, I put a few cups in the blender then mixed it all together to make it more creamy. But the flavor is unbeatable and the prep was maybe 5 mins... AMAZING for this single working mommy!!!!

I used this potato soup recipe just because I had all the ingredients, but I did not like ranch flavoring.  Also with the other ingredients it seemed too salty.  I will keep looking for a new recipe or just create my own.

Great. Only real problem was I didn't make enough. Every single person went back for more, and there wasn't any left over for lunch the next day. So I'll double it next time. My wife asked me to please make it again soon!

I made this soup and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  I also doubled the recipe, cooked my own bacon, and added the 2% milk Velveeta cheese.  It was absolutely delicious!  We have plenty of leftovers.  I am looking forward to having it for lunch tomorrow!

What an easy recipe, and so yummy!  Could be a meal in itself.  I used white potatoes,  because that's what I had on hand.  I also used ham instead of bacon for the same reason.   Also included a turnip, so I could sneak it in and no one even noticed!   Very simple ingredients.   The ranch dressing mix was the only thing I don't normally carry. 

This will become one of our regular recipes!

Very easy. Omitted the bacon. Maybe that is why it was pretty bland.  So we added dill and celery.  In addition to the green onion and cheese garnish, we also added smoked paprika.

So YUMMY.  Made just like the recipe called for.  There were a few comments saying the soup came out runny.  Well I chose large/medium potatoes and it was the perfect consistency!

Too thin? Try too thick. But that can be helped. I took everyone's advice and put the setting on high for 5 hours or so. It's only 20 more minutes til it's ready, but the soup isn't soupy at all. It's like mashed potato consistency. I just added more chicken broth and I'll wait until I add the half n half to do anything more with the consistency. Hopefully it works out well. So far, it tastes fine. Can't wait to eat it. It's been smelling up my house all day hehe! It's also a brownish color...I think that has to do with the bacon bits I used. They were bright red. Also, putting it on high did cause the potato skin to stick to the bottom and I had to stir a couple times so it wouldn't burn.

Loved how easy this recipe was to make and delicious!! I changed a few things since i love cheese I put a can of Campbell's chedder cheese condensed soup in it and instead of water I used a brown ale beer that I brewed myself! I don't think I've ever not cooked anything with beer or rum in it but it adds so much flavor!

Excellent, easy recipe everyone (kids and adults) enjoyed.  I used the recipe for Ranch Dressing mix, and I added a tablespoon of sour cream to milk at the end.  We'll definitely make again.

I love baked potato soup and was very excited to try this recipe.  The flavor was great, and my husband even loved it.  I took other reviewers advice and doubled everything.  There was more soup to go around and left overs.  The only negative was the amount of salt flavor.  This was because of the chicken bouillon.  I only added 4 instead of 6 like others have suggested but the soup was way too salty.  Next time, I may add the chicken broth, or the chicken gel.  Less salty flavor, but other then that, this soup was amazing and I will be making it again.

Excellent potato soup and  "comfort food" recipe. My family loved it! Added 1 cup of chopped celery for flavor. To thicken before serving, I took a cup of cooked potatoes and some broth from the crock pot, pureed them in a blender and added back to the crock pot. Will definitely add to the Fall and Winter menus!

My family and I loved this recipe! I did follow the recipe, except i did not use the bacon bits and used real bacon cooked then crumbled, and I also had to make my own seasoned salt (I had none on hand). I did add a teaspoon of flour after I added the half and half just to thicken it slightly. Thank you for this recipe I will be making it to serve this year for Thanksgiving.

Neither my husband or I liked it all that well. On the positive side, the potatoes remained firm, not hard or mushy. On the negative side we both felt that it came out tasting far too salty. I used low sodium chicken broth and Mrs. Dash table salt so I'm not sure why it tasted that way.

This was very yummy! I already have requests to make it again && I've already given the recipe out. Followed the recipe exactly as written except I fried up bacon instead of bacon bits. Also made bread bowls (recipe from this site also)  to go along with it.

I followed the recipe exactly. I found it to be way too salty. I had to add an extra cup of Half and Half just to eat it. I would change this next time by omitting the bacon bits and add crisp low sodium bacon. Omit the seasoning salt altogether.

Thank you.  This is one of the best recipes I have gotten off of this site in a long time. Made this for the first time today to serve to company and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I substituted low sodium chicken broth for the water and bullion.  I did make a  mistake though.  I was on a roll adding ingredients and put the half and half (non-fat) in the soup for the full cooking.  It made the appearance of the soup a little different but the taste was still very, very, good.  I did have to add some instant potatoes at the end to thicken it up.   Very, Very good stuff. I served it with a Caesar salad and beer bread.  Next time I am going to double the recipe to have more leftovers. Actually, we are going away for the weekend and I think I will make some of this to take with us.  Excellent.

A little salty for me but other than that, it was perfect. Next time, I would like to try it with real bacon and less season salt.

Love this soup. I didn't use the bacon, I did add celery. After I added half & half I add two tablespoons of butter. Fantastic. We did not use the cheese or the green onion. I did use chicken broth, instead of granules.

I love this soup. It is so easy and so delicious. I usually add a few more potatoes to make it go further but other than that follow the recipe as written. It is so, so good. I have made it using chicken broth instead of bouillon when I had some broth to use up and it turned out great also. Enjoy!

This was really easy to make but I've created a better potato soup on my own. I made this almost as stated except made for vegetarian so I switched the chicken for vegetable broth. I really liked the texture of the red potato skin in the soup, as I usually make potato soup with peeled yellow potatoes. The ranch dressing mix made the soup taste funny at first (and I am a HUGE fan of ranch) but after this sat overnight in the fridge, the flavors blended better. I ended up adding some extra spices just to mask the ranch and give the soup a more balanced flavor, as stated was somewhat bland.

Very Awesome.  My 16 y/o daughter demands this at least twice a month and invites friends over. I like to use the hormel jalapeno bacon bits.

This  is very yummy! We don't like any sort of onions or minced garlic. So I used a tsp of garlic powder. I also put all the dry ingredients into a gallon ziploc bag with the cubed potatoes and shake it like crazy, coating every potato piece before I put it all into the crockpot. I also left out the parsley.

Very good recipe!!! I scaled it back to 2 servings for my husband and I.  I substituted russet potatoes for the red and left out the onion since i didn't have any on hand. Also used shredded Co-jack cheese instead of the cheddar and used a bouillon cube instead of the granules.  Perfect!!!  Will definitely make this again.

Ok, I had posted that it was too salty because of the 2T bouillon, but my family loved it!
Personally, I'd probably unsalt it a bit, but the recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

I made this recipe exactly as listed.  I really liked it, but found it to be super salty!  I think I will make it again but cut back on the bouillon.

Cooked today on high for 4 hours. I skipped the parsley. The soup turned out wonderful!!! I checked in on it a few times thinking, "oh boy, this is not going to turn out good".  I butchered the garlic clove and only used a 3/4 of the red onion. My red onion was a wee bit large and I didn't want to risk using it all. I too cut and seared smoked sausages for a more filling soup. However, I kept the sausages in a separate dish, allowing others to add as they pleased. This is a keeper! Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This was fantastic! I used real bacon instead of bacon bits, and bouillon cubes instead of granules.  Everything else was just as written.  My kids loved it! Want to serve it for a vegan...thinking of using soy or rice milk, vegetable stock and tofu bacon. I'll let you know if it turns out well!

Tried this tonight and it was soooooo good! A nice change from regular ol' potato soup. Made exactly as listed, except I didn't have a red onion and used a sweet yellow onion. Also didn't have bouillon granules and threw in one bouillon cube. It was ready after 6 hrs on low. My 3 year old ate three bowls!! Very good on a cold winter evening. I'll be making again and again...Thanks!

Very easy, onion can be substituted with leek and less bacon (I used 2 tablespoons) to make it a little heathier.

This is just wonderful!  I followed the recipe for the most part except cooked my own bacon and added some velveeta when I added the 1/2 and 1/2.  I used Lawrys new seasoned salt with black pepper.  It will replace my old baked potato recipe.

Very Good!!!  I am a very nervous cook (always reluctant to try new recipes) and this was very easy and very delicious.  I also added some garlic and guyere cheese sausages to this.  It was a hit even with the picky 6 yr. old :)

Very good recipe, pretty easy too. Cooked bacon instead of bacon bits as others did. Before I added the half and half I put batches into the blender for a smooth and creamy soup.....this would have been much easier with a hand blender. Only other labor intensive part was peeling the potatoes. I used chicken broth instead of bouillon and water. Will make again reserving some crispy bacon for the top:)

This turned out great! The entire family ate it after a day of skiing. I used the potatoes I had at home rather then red potatoes. Will definately make this again, very easy! Served with some soft french bread that was perfect for dipping into the soup.

Loved this soup- doubled the recipe for my slow cooker but I did reduce the amount of pepper to about 1/3 teaspoon and still plenty spicy.  I added the cheese to each individual bowl at the end and left out the onions and it won raves from my guests.  This recipe is a keeper.

very easy to fix--cutting potatoes took the longest.  It is tasty, easy, and filling.  I will fix it again and add the sausage and/or the Velveeta.  Yummy!

A winner! I made a need-to-grocery-shop version using only potatoes, ranch mix, chicken bouillon, and cream. It was easy and fantastic. I can't wait to make it again when I have bacon and cheese. It can only get better!

Sooooo good! I used half a red onion, pan fried bacon, and added 8 oz. of velveeta with the half n half. Can't wait to try it with other variations, like ham or chicken sausage.

This is so easy and delicious.  I adapted it so that it was Gluten Free (for my daughter) by using corn starch instead of the flour.  It was perfect!!  I just made it for our neighbors and they raved about it too.  It's a new family favorite!! :)

My family enjoyed this soup!! The only thing I changed was the bacon. I cooked it and cut it in to pieces. I added the bacon to the soup when I added the milk. Very yummy!! I will make this again!
