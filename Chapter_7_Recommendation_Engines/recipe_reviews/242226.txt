I love this recipe for chicken quarters and have made it several times when my butcher has chicken quarters on sale. My husband even though he said it was ok, ate 3 servings. He said it was too sweet, but I did halve the cayenne pepper to please my 8 and 9yr old daughters and they loved it! My only suggestion is to double the sauce, I've even tripled it before, kept half of it separate and used it drizzled over the side dishes. Thank you for such a yummy, quick and easy weekday meal. I'm going to try using my crock pot this time to cook the chicken and then maybe throw the chicken under the broiler with the glaze or just serve the glaze for dipping.

I used smokey paprika and  smoked sea salt. Didn't have the celery seed so had to leave that out. I used all organic as well and we loved it!! Came out perfect. We both thought that it was like the best barbecue! Definitely a repeat recipe in our house!
YUM!

I usually drizzle the glaze over the chicken, and not coat it heavily as the spice rub has lots of flavor. The glaze just gives it a little more colour and sheen. If you want enough to coat the chicken, then you may need to double the glaze or just use it as a dip after the chicken is cooked. I hope you enjoy!

Made this after a friend served it to us.  I used 3 1/2pounds of split bone in chicken breasts and I doubled the glaze amount. Loved this recipe.  Great combination of sweet and spicy.

OMG!!!  This was amazing!  I added extra cayenne pepper b/c I like stuff hot, but that was it.  I made it for our block party of nearly 83 people.  Local grocery store had leg quarters on sale in these huge bags for .49 cents per pound...  myself and 4 others went in together to make enough chicken to be the entree for the party using this recipe.  I also printed out 100 recipe cards to set next to the huge pans of chicken.  Everyone went nuts over the chicken and every recipe card was gone!!  We all thank you for this recipe.... home run!

I added some additional spices to the mix and had to turn on the convection roast feature to get the skin crispy.  But, the chicken came out great.

I didn't have any yellow or spicy brown mustard, so I substituted stone ground and Dijon mustards respectively. This is SUCH a delicious recipe, and it made my apartment smell good, too! :)

I took the advice of another cook and brined it for about an hour before. The chicken was very moist and flavorful.

This was excellent and tasty!  I followed the recipe as written, and as other reviews stated, I doubled the glaze.  I would recommend lowering your rack into the center of the oven so the glaze does not burn.  I also did not have time to marinate the chicken, rather just put the rub onto the chicken and popped it in the oven.  It was excellent!!  I made chicken salad with the left overs the next day.  Yummy.

I did not make the glaze, just the spice rub mixture on chicken leg quarters but I put them in my crockpot and they came out very moist and flavorful. Will definitely make again. Did not add or substitute anything

Probably  the best chicken recipe ever! It has a flavourful spicy crunch with a gooey coating.  I was  scraping it and eating it off the pan...

Loved this recipe-really upped my chicken game, which was in serious jeopardy of getting boring. This is anything but boring-sweet and spicy. I followed the recipe closely, but doubled the sauce which was perfect. Also, used smoked paprika-that added a nice flavor. I would halve the celery salt-that is pretty pungent. Overall, this is my new fav!

This was Very Good!  A little trouble for this "older" lady but well worth it!!  I did brine the chicken first.  Didn't have dijon mustard on hand so substituted for that, but essentially went with the recipe except for that.  Thank you for submitting this!

It was delicious to note if you like a little more flavor in your chicken add a lot of the rub under the skin so it can really soak in the flavor. Overall good meal and the kids loved it to, my picky eater enjoyed this which is say something in my opinion.

I actually ate the skin!  I NEVER eat the skin.  I used leg/thigh quarters and this came out absolutely delicious!  I cant wait to try it again with a whole chicken cut up.  Thank you for this recipe.  I didn't change anything except the measures because I had 5 lbs of chicken.

I loved this. I took the suggestion of pre-soaking but I didn't know what brine was so I used chicken broth and water. I patted them dry but did not rinse them. I also did not know I needed to sit them in the fridge for an hour with the dry rub, not a big deal I dry rubbed them and put them in the freezer for 20 minutes. I used this recipe on (2) quarter chickens but did not use all of the rub or the glaze. I had no spicy brown mustard or dill seed but I used a coarse mustard with mustard seed and it worked. Next time I will lower the upper rack to give a good air space between the chicken and the top of the oven to avoid burning the glaze. The burnt glaze gave a smoke flavor and when I gave it more air space on the final 15 minute cooking you couldn't see the burnt glaze so I am not sure. Very good.

Didn't have any celery seeds, used Dijon and yellow mustard. It worked fine. I used it on 6 leg-thigh quarters, the recepie will run you short on the dry rub (but not by much), the glaze is the perfect amount.

This was delicious.  I used chicken leg quarters, and I added some mushrooms when I basted the chicken.  Kids and adults all loved it.

I cannot have sugar at this time in my life so I simply deleted it. I added three other spices that I can have: turmeric, fennel seed, and celery seed.
