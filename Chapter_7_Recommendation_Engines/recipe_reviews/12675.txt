This was a good recipe to work off. I made several changes to the recipe. I browned the onions first, added the meat to the onions with garlic and ginger. Once the meat was almost cooked I added green peas, corn, bell peppers and mushrooms to the meat. After a few minutes I added the nutmeg, sage, salt, red chili powder and some basil and parsley for taste. Once the meat and peas/corn was cooked, I added about 4-6 tablespoon of pasta sauce to give it some texture.Make sure you do not put too much to the point that it is saucy...add just enough so the meat is not so dry. Then add the mashed potatoes and bake in the oven with some cheese on top. When I made this dish I had several people over for dinner and they all went back for seconds and thirds. I hope all these ideas help you!

Super!  A minor change: I simmered the peas & corn along with carrots and mushrooms, herbs & spices in a can of beef broth for about 10 minutes, then used the liquid to make a gravy for the meat.  Combined meat, gravy & veggies, poured into baking dish.  Layered potatoes on top.  Baked & then sprinkled with shredded cheddar.  No leftovers!

This recipe is wonderful.  Used to have Shepard's pie all the time, but my family lost the recipe.
The only thing I do different is I add a gravy made with 1pkg Onion soup mix, 1TBSP flour and 1-2 cups (depending on how soupy you want it) water, and pour that over the veggies and meat, before topping it with the potatoes.

What a nice, homey kind of meal.  Like the reviewer before me, I floured the browned meat, used onion soup mix, but replaced the water with a can of beef broth.  The nutmeg and sage lend a nice addition.  I happen to have fresh sage growing in my backyard, and it was put to good use in this comfort food.

I did a combination of all the reviews added some garlic to the mashed potatoes,   I took a pack of brown gravy mix a pack of onion soup mix and some water and flour and mixed it with the grease from my meat to make a gravy. Then I put cheese on some of it because cheese didnt seem like it would go well with this meal but definately liked the cheese.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I lived in Ireland for a year and this what shepherd's pie tastes like.  I love the idea of the potatoes on the bottom very good. Just a reminder don't omit the spices esp the nutmeg it was so good.

Good but slightly bland. Could be given more flavor with some additions, including minced garlic, diced green bell peppers, and diced celery. Simmering after adding a half cup of inexpensive red wine can also give an added dimension to the flavor if you do not object to cooking with wine.

I enjoyed this dish very much.  There were some slight changes I made to suit our family.  I used ground turkey instead, as we do not eat much red meat.  I sauteed garlic with the onion in a little bit of olive oil with the paprika.  For my herbs I used the ginger, chili powder, some sea salt and marjoram.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes to the mixture. I then sauteed a frogen variety pkg of corn, green beans, peas and carrots.  Added beef broth and flour.  When I added the mashed potatoes, I put some French's french fried onions on top.  Came out great!  Thank you.

I've tried many different Shepherd's Pie recipes, all to which were alright but could never find one that I would make continuously. At least until now. My family loved this, and my incredibly picky son claimed how great it smelled while I was making it. My husband absolutely loved it, as did I. I was a bit nervous about the nutmeg but it was such a lovely addition. The only changes I made were that I added a little flour just to give the meat mixture a thicker consistency, I used green beans instead of peas for the simple fact I don't like peas, and put the potatoes on top with a bit of shredded cheese. This was the best Shepherd's Pie I've had. This will definitely be made in our house time and time again!

I made this recipe as is.  I was a little skeptical about the nutmeg but was glad I followed the recipe and didn't improvise because the taste was wonderful.  A great comfort food meal.

I added much more than a dash of all the spices, to enhance the flavor.  Everything turned out wonderful.

Really is not fair for me to rate this.  I was looking for a base to make shepherds pie.  It is one of my childhood favorites.  This recipe has way too many onion, cut it down to one and cooked with the groung meat.  I added garlic powder to the mashed potatoes.  I used one CAN of corn and one of peas.  I left out the nutmeg, sage, salt and pepper.  I did as anthoer review suggested and mixed 1 package of onion soup mix with 1 can of beef broth and 1 tbs of flour.  Poured that over the meat/veg layers before topping with the mashed potatoes. Turned out great.  My daughter ate it even though she HATES mashed potatoes.

Ok, but needed more spice.  I added garlic, and would probably use lamb next time.

We just finished dinner and my husband said this is definitely a recipe to put in rotation ... probably during our Texas winters as the dish retains its heat very well!  We like savory/aromatic/spicier food so I tweaked this toward our taste but appreciate a very good basic recipe to build upon.

I've tried shepard's pie recipes before and have been horribly dissapointed, but this was great. Not only did my house smell great while cooking, but even the picky eaters of my family came back for seconds. I did add a little cheese on top, and the next time I make it I will add some seasoning directly to the potatoes on the top layer (the main complaint of the house was they were too bland), but this is definitely going in the rotation at our house.

My family liked this a lot.  I will make it again. I did use a can of beef broth and poured about 1/2 the can over the mixture before topping with the mashed potatoes. Also, I mixed all the vegies with the meat and added fresh corn from the cob. Delicious!

This recipe was pretty good. It was my first time making it. My one year old loved it. I suggest putting a layer of mashed potatoes down first, then the ground meat mix, then another layer of mashed potatoes. Top off with cheddar cheese the last 15 minutes in the oven

Shepherd's Pie has been one of my specialties and this simple recipe was very nice, although I added celery, carrots and some herbs. I served it with a salad, rolls, Brussels sprouts, whole cooked cranberries and a very nice Merlot. The wonderful thing about this dish is you can prepare it ahead of time.

This was really good, in fact my husband said it was probably the best shepherd pie he's ever had. I didn't layer the meat and veggies (peas, corn, onions, mushrooms and green beans,) rather mixed them all up and sauteed them, but that was pretty much the only thing I did differently.

I've made this a couple times now. It's a good base recipe. I add lots of sage. And last time, it was really good when I added a layer of cheese on top of the beef when assembling the casserole. It's too dry otherwise. It would probably be good with some brown gravy instead of cheese.

I thought this was way too onion-y and I only  used 2 onions instead of the 3. My husband loved it, but I didn't think it was that good. We will try other recipes. Thanks, though!

Very good recipe.  Everyone liked it.  I did as the other reviewers and added onion soup mix and water.  My daughter requested more fluffier potatoes and my sons requested more ground meat.

Great base.  I substitute Italian seasoning for nutmeg since I like it more savory.  I also add in some flour and water to make a bit of a gravy that keeps it nice and moist.  It's always a hit!

This is a great shepherd's pie, and I've made it quite a few times. Today, I made it with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and it is even better! Healthier, too!

Absolutely yummy! I, too, was very skeptical about the nutmeg and the sage but they made all of the difference. This was the only dish that my college roomate could make and I haven't had it in 30 years!  What a pleasant surprise...this will become a "regular" for my family.

To make it simpler, you can use instant potatoes.  Also, instead of peas, I put in green beans (just for something different). And, the best tip...add a little shredded Chedder on during the last five minutes of so...delicious!

My husband and I agreed that this recipe was bland.  It needed more flavor.  Next time, I'm going to try it with the gravy that some of the other reviewers suggested.

I think I may have gone overboard on the mashed potatoes which made it very dry. The filling was ok but no sauce or gravy to bind it together. So, we found that too was a bit dry.

I have made this recipe quite a few times exactly as written and enjoyed it every time. Sometimes I will add mushrooms to the meat and onions.  I made it a few times with ground lamb, that's a really good variation. I can also say it is just as good with ground bison.

I guess this is typical English fare. It was pretty bland even when I added four cloves of garlic to the potatoes and increased the spice quantity. We even had to salt our portion before eating. I would recommend additional salt being added to the cooking process to bring out the subtle “flavors”. I don’t think I can recommend this recipe enthusiastically.

I did use a frozen vegetable mixture, liked the twist with the layer of potatoes on the bottom, and the seasoning. I always make my beef mushroom gravy to go with this recipe. I would consider making it this way again.

I used fresh corn, and chopped carrots (also blanched) instead of frozen and peas. Really enjoy this recipe. Picky boyfriend loves it too! I also put the potatoes into a food processor to make them extra smooth.

Great! I substituted MorningStar Grillers Crumbles for the beef and instantly had a vegetarian Shepard's Pie! It came out really well and was super easy. My husband and I both had seconds and it was just as good for leftovers. Next time, I might try adding cream of mushroom soup, carrots, or cream of celery soup.

I made half the recipe to produce two individual (rather large) crocks.  I'm not sure how the original recipe would feed 16!  I added 2T onion and 1 clove garlic to the ground beef.  I added about 1 teaspoon each nutmeg, sage, salt, pepper.  I thought that it still needed more sage.  I used leftover mashed potatoes for convenience.  Overall a very good recipe.  Next time I will use ground lamb.

Good starting recipe.  Kind of bland.  After making this recipe a few times I decided to change a few things so people didn't have to use so much ketchup to make it taste better.  I added more potatoes, more butter, and a can of beef gravy.  It makes it creamier and gives it more flavor.

Excellent recipe!! My husband loved it! Altho, I did take one of the recommendations to add the onion soup mix w/ water and flour. I found that it was too liquidy. Maybe I should have added more flour? I will definitly make this again but not make any changes to the original recipe. Thanks for a great meal!

This was great comfort food! I needed a recipe o utilize leftovers, and I wanted something different from my mother-in-law's shepherd's pie. I scaled the recipe to 4 servings, but kept the herb and spice amounts the same, and the potatoes. I added a pinch of sugar and salt, to carmelize the onions. I added a bit of leftover ribeye steak after browning the ground beef, and as some other reviewer suggested, chili powder, about a half teaspoon. This is definitely in my list of recipes for the future.
