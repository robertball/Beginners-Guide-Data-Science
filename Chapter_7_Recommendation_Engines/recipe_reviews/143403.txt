Only things I changed in this recipe is use chopped pepperoni in place of the bacon (I forgot to take the bacon out of the freezer the night before....whoops!) and omitted the ketchup. Tasty eggs. I sprinkled some Tabasco over mine for a little morning kick. This would be great for a hangover cure paired with a beer.

Great for breakfast and definitely "a quick and easy spin on scambled eggs" as the submitter states.  I cut the recipe in half and cut back on the veggies just a bit as it was more veggies than eggs.  I added a little minced garlic, but other than that it was delicious with a side of whole grain toast and OJ!  Next time I might put this "egg mess" in a tortilla for a nice breakfast wrap!

I wouldn’t exactly call this “a savory makeover” of scrambled eggs as the submitter describes. After all, it’s just scrambled eggs with stuff in it.  I think a half cup each of onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers and bacon is a HUGE amount for a mere four eggs!  I would recommend the additions of each of these ingredients “to taste.”  I took a big-time short cut on this, however, so other than the bacon I didn’t have to be concerned about chopping and measuring anything.  I made extras of “Personal Portobello Pizza” last night expressly for this purpose and I was grateful for the ease in which it allowed me to get breakfast on the table this morning with a minimum of fuss or muss.  A “mess” this Aussie Breakfast Egg Mess” is, but this mess sure was good.  Still, because I believe 2-1/2 cups of add-ins to be extraordinarily heavy-handed for just four eggs, I can only rate this 3-stars.

This was a really good mess. I love this recipe. When I read it I thought, I don't have all the ingredients so I had to substitute a few things. I did not have mushrooms but I had some hot peppers so I added that in. I made this yesterday and I am making it today. Delicious!

Tried this recipe and it's by far the best breakfast food I've ever had.  I did vary it up a bit; I used olive oil instead of butter with a clove of garlic, and added a little dill, crushed red pepper & thyme from a spice rack.  It came out awesome with shredded cheddar mixed in at the end.  Can't wait to make it again.

It's neat that I found this recipe today. I was planning on making a variation of this for supper tonight. I make it every once in a while and wrap it up in a tortilla, but I like your suggestion with the bacon and cheese. I usually use just cheddar, but I'll be trying some of the other tonight. Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious! I did make a few changes as I did not have some of the ingredients on hand. Instead of the Parmesan cheese, I used boccocini and cheddar cheese. I did not have any mushrooms or bacon. I used 3 baby bell peppers in yellow, red and orange (looks pretty), hot pepper and lamb slices. Everything else as stated in the recipe.  I bet this would be really good with crumbled sausage as well.   Will be making this again! thanks for the recipe!

Coincidentally, I had the required veggies left over from other cooking projects, and this was a unique way to use them up.  The finished product is a smite unaesthetically appealing, but I'd be willing to wager it was cook misadventure :)  BF and I really enjoyed the flavor, and this is a dish we would try again.  Thank you for the submission!

My wife loved it.  I used less butter but added in a little olive oil. It turned out great.  Also, I didn't use the ketchup but wished that I did.  Thanks for a great meal.

Love this! It's the kind of thing I make all the time with whatever fresh veggies I have on hand.  It's delicious and really sticks to one's ribs for hours.

Just made this exactly as written, even with the optional ketchup, only I used spicy ketchup for some kick. With the ketchup I would rate it 4 stars, without it's a 5 star recipe for sure. To me, the ketchup seems to cheapen the overall taste of this recipe.

Next time, I would cook the bacon first.  Then cook the onion; substitute diced potatoes for the tomatoes and leave out the ketchup.

I make eggs like this all the time.  I love the over abundance of veggies.  
I am not sure why anyone uses Egg Beaters anymore since science has proven whites  and yolks make no difference on the effect of cholesterol as told to me by my doctor.  In fact, the yolk has the most vitamins and more rich in these and the whites have very little.  My doc told me cholesterol levels are genetically inherited.  For example, I eat several eggs a week and my labs prove my cholesterol is good.  Ask your doctor and research.
