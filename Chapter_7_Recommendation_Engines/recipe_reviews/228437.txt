I make this regularly for parties and such and without fail, I always get folks begging me for this recipe. A few modifications: 1) I take a giant bar of Toblerone milk chocolate and grate that. I use that instead of the chocolate called for in the recipe. 2) Pudding mix, make the instant vanilla pudding per box instructions, blend in the cream cheese, then add in the cream or heavy milk as needed. Start with one ingredient and play with it until the consistency and tase is just right 3) Lady fingers: If you can't find lady fingers, another great substitute is pound cake cut very thinly and into smaller pieces. Sara Lee pound cake is great for this. 4) Cut up the strawberries or slice them. 5) Layer the cake, strawberries, pudding mix, grated Toblerone. Repeat 6)Douse the whole thing with a mix of strong coffee mixed with either Kaluha or Baileys.

I made this recipe x4-had a little trouble getting the cottage cheese mixture smooth with electric mixer.  I substituted angel food cake broken up vs. ladyfingers since I could not find them at store.  It turned out very well, however.  Easy and no baking required on a hot summer day!
