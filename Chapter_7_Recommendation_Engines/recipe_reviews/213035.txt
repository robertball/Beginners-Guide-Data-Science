I made this recipe with my 7 yr old daughter. It was easy enough that I cored the apples and showed her how to wrap them and she did the rest. They are a delicious twist to the baked apple. We'll be making these again! Thanks for the recipe

Perhaps I did something wrong? The concept of this recipe is a good one but it certainly didn't turn out the way I had hoped. The pie crust didn't stay on the apple but instead slid down and formed a mess at the bottom of the apple. Also I cooked it for more like 40 mins but the crust never browned. =( I'm going to try it again - because the apple tasted really good. But as written this is not a 5-star recipe. Note: It could also use some cinnamon and vanilla ice cream on the side.

Brush the crust with beaten egg whites to help it brown. Also the crust stays on better if you peel the apples and this makes them easier to eat. Make sure you bring the crust up to the top of the cored apple hole and pinch it to make a lip. Spray your cooking sheet with cooking spray and lightly flour it.
