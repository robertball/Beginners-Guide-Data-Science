Delicious, followed the recipe except did add a little orange marmalade to the cranberry mixture as well.  Took a little longer to bake than called for.

Excellent recipe!! I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than what was stated but it was no bother. Very fresh taste with the whole cranberries and a lot easier to make than what the directions seem.
