Awesome recipe! I served them standing in a tall crystal vase. Tip: Don't roll the dough too thin or cut the strips too narrow. I used turbinado sugar--great effect! This went great as a finish to a Moroccan dinner. My guests still rave about them.

Hmmmm....mine turned out nothing like "straws".  Following the directions exactly, mine turned into burnt little doggy biscuits.  I tried again making the dough thicker, but the results were nothing special... just gingerbread strips.

I've been searching for a recipe like my Grandmother used to make when I was a child.  Finally, here it is, although she used a glass to cut out the cookies.  If you like crunchy, spicy gingerbread cookies, you will love this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I absolutely love these Gingerbread straws.  They are very flavorful and crisp.  Perfect with a cup of coffee or tea.  They also keep well.  People always ask for the recipe.
