I did not use the cream of soup to make this. 
I made the filling as directed - topped the burrito with sour cream mixed with green onion & the cheese.  Because everything was already warm, I just heated under the broiler until the cheese started to brown and the sour cream sauce was hot.

I make these so often. Always scrumptious. I don't smother and bake them and they are still awesome. This is my seasoning recipe I use now for everything applicable. I don't have to buy Mexican seasoning packets anymore with preservatives and junk in them and it is easy and so much better.

We loved it! I substituted 1/2 the ground beef (I used lean ground beef) for turkey and used plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream to lighten the calories. No one could tell the difference. Topped with shredded romaine lettuce, salsa. Chopped avocado and black olives. Better than a restaurant and looked awesome!

Delicious.  I added 1/2 cup green chili salsa to the soup mix. Hamburger mixture is great though the red pepper flakes do add a kick.  Enjoyed by all at the table.

This is a inexpensive, easy and delicious meal to make! My kids all love it and it makes the perfect amount for our family. It is very filling. We do fresh veggies and dip on the side and no one is left saying "I'm hungry!".

I made this mostly for my wife. She likes Mexican food much more than I do. 
She said it needed more sauce and was not spicy enough, so I will be taking that into account next time. 
Other than that, it was great.

This was really good! My whole family loved it! I minimized the beans to half of a can. I doubled the seasoning, and put the extra seasoning in the sour cream mixture. Delicious

Very good, my husband liked it very much. I used mince fresh garlic instead of powdered. Will make again. Thank you.

This was great, but next time I'd like to find a substitute for the mushroom soup to make it healthier. I skipped the pepper flakes and it was still a tad spicy for my 7yr old so I'll tame down the chili powder next time as well. I always use plain Greek yogurt for sour cream and you'd never know the difference. I recommend fat free refried beans and ground turkey instead of beef. My husband even commented he really liked it and he doesn't usually like refried beans. This made 8 good size burritos, not 4. If you did 4, they would be HUGE.

Overwhelmed with all the different burrito receipes, but chose this one because it was closest to the one I had "years" ago with the cheese melted on top. However I did use shrimp in it, also used chicken and steak, (I'll admit I marinated the steak from another fajita receipe), they all turned out great. I ended up with too much and froze the rest. My husband and friends loved it!! Will be making this again!

I added a little more cumin and chili powder. Instead of just green chilies, I used a tomato/green chili mix and less water. 
I thought it was very good.

My husband loved them. I wasn't as big of a fan as he was. I felt like they were a little bland. I may try more beef and less beans next time. I did appreciate how quick and easy it was though!

Made this for dinner tonight. I was a bit skeptical reading the recipe (i.e. mushroom soup), but the family loved it! Very good!!

I was leery to try this recipe because it hasn't had many reviews yet but I was NOT disappointed! I did make some changes because I had planned for a pork green chile to top this. Therefore, I did not add green chiles to the beef. I also don't like mushroom so I did not add cream of mushroom soup. I put the sour cream on the side. I did not add many red pepper flakes because I thought it would be too spicy for my little one and me. And I did not have refried beans so I used black beans. Everything else stayed the same. These burritos were SO flavorful and yummy (without my pork green chile on top). My 3 year old loved them. I will definitely make these again!

My family, including picky children, loved this recipe. I cut the amount of cumin, chili powder, and red pepper flakes to 1/4 t each because of the kids, but I'm sure the full-flavor version would be delicious if you don't mind spiciness.

I did not make any changes to this recipe except to add chili sauce to the table as an option since we enjoy spicy food.  I was very curious as to how the cream of mushroom sauce would taste on the burrito. My picky sweetheart and I REALLY liked this recipe.  No left overs tonight. Thank you for sharing!

I added some cilantro to the beef mixture and instead of putting cheese/sr crm mixture on top I put cheese inside the burritos and served sr crm on the side.  Just my preference.  I didn't use the cream of mushroom soup.  They only needed about 10 minutes in the oven to heat/melt the cheese.
