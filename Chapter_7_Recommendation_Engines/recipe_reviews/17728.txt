I LOVE this recipe.  This is nearly identical to a Rhubarb Cream Pie recipe passed down through my family.  Mine has a 1/2 cup more sugar, 1 more Tbl flour and 1 Tbl butter and 1 cup more of rhubarb and I bake it in a 10 inch.  This is a family favorite and many people who normally don't like rhubarb pies have loved this one.

This recipe is fantastic.  If you like your pie intensely fruity without the underlying bitterness that can accompany rhubarb, this is the one!  I used half frozen and half fresh rhubarb, resulting in 4 cups of fruit, and I didn't experience any of the problems mentioned (flat pie, spillover) by previous reviewers.  I pre-baked the shell for 15 mins to prevent sogginess.  I cut the scraps into shapes for a loose top, and sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over the whole thing. The egg mixture mellowed the rhubarb, yet intensified the fruity tartness.  Great!

This was a great change from plain rhubarb pie -- I added strawberies, too, from teh freezer - YUM!!
Also - only use a 9-inch pie pan.  The only one I would find was a 10-11 inch glass one and the pie was rather flat!  (But delicious!) I can't wait to try it with fresh rhubarb again soon!

This recipe was pretty good!  I am on a low carb diet so I did make some changes, leaving off the crust and replacing the sugar with splenda.  Since no crust it baked about 40 minutes.  I think it would be wonderful with strawberries also and I will definitely add more fruit next time.  My first real 'cake' since I started this plan months ago!

I'll give this an actual review when this works, but I wanted to warn people against substituting berries for the rhubarb.  This might be a no brainer, but I'm entirely an amateur cook, and switching this out didn't work.  It was delicious, but the inside of the pie was completely liquid.  Nothing wrong with the recipe, but just wanted to warn anyone considering this.

Absolutely delicious! I wasn't certain the custard would cut the tartness of the rhubarb but it did just enough to balance sweet with tart. I used about 4 cups rhubarb and made 1.5 times the custard as my stoneware pie plate very deep and baked it about 70 minutes. Will definitely keep this one! It was a nice alternative to the regular ol' strawberry/rhubarb combination.

I made this pie for company and they enjoyed it very much. I served it with whipped cream. Next time I will try it in a tart pan or lower sided pie plate. I will definitely make it again!

We liked this recipe. I added 1 cup more of rhubarb and did everything else the same. Kinda had a browned sugar crust on top. Thanks.

This one is a very tasty pie, yet pretty thin; next time, I'll probably use a tart pan. I'll probably also try it with other fruits, such as apple, pear, apricot, ... The custard filling seem the be a reliable base for any kind of fruit pie.

Very good - I doubled the recipe for my large pie plate, but I didn't quite double the sugar.  Next time I would probably increase the rhubarb and omit the nutmeg for a slightly more tart, rhubarb-y flavour.  Good all the same!

To be fair, I made huge changes to this. I didn't use a crust, I used splenda instead of sugar, and I added a bit of cinnamon as well. I also doubled the recipe since I had 4 cups of rhubarb. It's odd, but good. There really isn't enough of the custard though, hence the lower rating. I will likely try this again, but at least double the custard.

I found this creamy pie to be a delicious change from the pies I usually buy at the supermarket. There was rhubarb growing in my neighbor's yard. She let me take just enough, and I cooked it up into this wonderful pie. It smelled so good cooking, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! I'd better tell the neighbor she needs to plant more rhubarb before I use it all up making more pies!

I've made this 2 days running now.  It's wonderful.  I did not double the custard as others recommended - I didn't want to increase the sugar content per serving. I increased the rhubarb to 3 cups and made sure to drizzle the sauce over all the fruit.  It was perfect, though next time I may well add the rhubarb to the custard mixture and then pour it all into the pastry shell at once.  I also didn't bother covering the edges with foil and the pastry was perfect.  I nixed the nutmeg and added almost 2tsp cinnamon instead. It wasn't overly cinnamon-y. Cinnamon and Rhubarb= perfect companions:-)

This is a great recipe, very sweet and it set up well. I added a tiny bit of vanilla to tone down the nutmeg, and it turned out very yummy. I'm not a rhubarb fan, but I'll probably make this again!

I made this with a graham cracker crust instead of pastry.  I was looking for a good, custard-y rhubarb pie, but ended up with more of a rhubarb tart.  It would be delicious as a bar, but there really wasn't enough custard to fill up the pie pan.  I think I'll use a recipe that calls for more eggs & more milk next time.

This recipe turned out terribly. I don't know if it was something I did or what. The sugar seemed to form a very hard crust at the top. The custard did not taste at all like custard. I will definitely not try this recipe again.

This pie was excellent. I followed the recipe as written and didn't have any trouble. I had never had rhubarb before, but this pie made me a fan. This recipe even got the "thumbs up" from my 87-year-old neighbour. She even said it was worth cheating on her diet for!

I really liked this pie, but it came out with a dark crispy meringue-like crust and I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like that or if it did that because I mixed the eggs, sugar, and flour together and then let it sit for about 10 minutes before I poured it in the pie shell.

This pie is really excellent.  It has just the right amount of sweetness (you can still taste the "tartness" of the rhubarb) and the *custard* like filling is wonderful.  A great rhubarb pie!

I was trying to find a recipe that was closest to my grandmother's recipe...this came close.  Tried it with the nutmeg the first time around (even though I don't remember her ever using it).  I was right, it didn't need it.  I made it the second time without it and was more pleased with the results.

in my opinion not enough rehubarb.  Too much sugar-too sweet.

Delicious!  Just about too easy to make.  My pies took 15 min. longer to cook though.  I cooked them on the middle rack on a cookie sheet.  Will definitely be making this one again!

I cut this recipe in half and made in a large (14 ounce) ramekin.  Because it was deep, I think it needed longer to cook because it was still runny after the time was up.  Tasty though!

Great recipe.  The nutmeg adds a good flavor.  I used a deep dish pie pan so I adjusted the filling & used 3 cups rhubarb & 3 eggs and a little more of the other ingredients. I was looking for a single crust rhubarb pie recipe.  It's a keeper!

All in all a good pie a little sweet for my liking but that's just me.  I did think maybe there should have been more filling.

This was different, but delicious.  I'd definitely make it again, it was quite simple.  And it was the right consistency, the custard balanced the tartness of the rhubarb.

This pie is great! It's so easy that it will stay in my regular recipe box. I used half rhubarb and half peeled and chopped granny smith apple. I replaced the nutmeg with cinnamin (because I really can't stand nutmeg). It was yummy hot but best the next morning. It really isn't a custard (as others have noted) but it taste great! Thanks!

This is a delightful recipe, with one edit.  Using the two cups of sugar made the pie too sweet for me.  Next time, I would reduce the sweetness to 1 1/2 cups.

Just OK. Made it as written.  Too much nutmeg, not enough fruit, kind of just sweet and bland other than the nutmeg.

Oh my goodness! I think this is the best pie I've ever made and I am a committed pie baker. I too increased the rhubarb to 4 cups, did 1.5 the custard and used light cream instead of milk, and a 10 inch pan. Must confess I got up early the next day and polished off the leftovers before anyone else could get to it

I read through several of the reviews and adjusting based on their experience. I had been planning on making a (my first ever) rhubarb custard pie all week, and then had a potluck come up, so I tried this recipe, which I thought looked simplest.
First: I made my own crust with lard+butter.
I used two cups chopped rhubarb plus about a half cup frozen sour cherries that were thawed and drained.
I increased the flour, egg, and half and half (instead of milk) by 1.5 to make up for the reviewers' noted "flatness." I used only 3/4 cup sugar, but I sprinkled about a tablespoon more on top of the pie after it came out.
Baking timing was spot on. Using a 9" glass pie plate, there was no overflow, and I didn't experience over-browning of the crust even though I didn't protect it.
And it is absolutely amazingly delicious. I will definitely make it again!

Great taste! First I did not add the nutmeg.  I agree with the other reviews that next time I would 1 1/2 times the custard. Otherwise it is a keeper of a recipe. Top with your own whipped cream. Skip the Cool Whip. Buy heavy whipping cream and add sugar to taste as you are beating. Chill bowl and beaters to fast track it.

Rhubarb omelette. It must have over cooked, even though I followed directions. I suggest checking it regularly towards the end, the center should jiggle like creme brulee.

Followed the recipe exactly, but not sure what happened.  It tasted absolutely wonderfully, but it was still runny after the hour of cooking.  Maybe I should have cooked it longer?

The pie did have good flavor, but I thought the custard layer was very thin. The whole pie was less than an inch thick and I made it exactly as directed.
