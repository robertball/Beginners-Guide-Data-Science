AMAZING! This was delicious.  The only change I made was to use pumpkin pie spice instead of the recipe spices, but only BECAUSE I was out of nutmeg.  Without trying to sound too snarky, I have to add a comment to fellow reviewers.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when somebody changes most of the ingredients in a recipe and then has the nerve to rate it with 1 or 2 stars & give it a bad review. Seems to me that you might have ruined the recipe yourself with the changes & that if you'd followed the recipe as written you may have liked it. If you made changes to a recipe thinking you'd improve it & you didn't, it's rude to then come back here & blame the creator of it for your error.  I'm just sayin'.....

I used my own pancake mix, buttermilk and melted butter. I also used brown sugar in the whipping cream for a deeper taste. Everything else I kept the same. Everyone enjoyed them. TIP: You might want to up the spices if you like them to be more defined.

This recipe was amazing! I did not change a thing and they turned out perfect.  They require a shorter cook time than regular pancakes so keep a close eye on them!  Delicious!

Since I make my pancakes from scratch, I had to modify the recipe slightly... but WOW!  My family LOVED these.  They are DELICIOUS.  My husband can't get enough.  I'm cooking my second batch as I type this.  Thank you thank you thank you!

I halved the recipe and used 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices and used jiffy baking mix instead of pancake mix. There was VERY little spice and pumpkin flavor.  Definitely needs more of both. They really just tasted like normal pancakes.

My kids and family LOVED this recipe. Kids rarely ask for second helpings of pancakes, and they woffed down several of these. We had overnight guests who also raved about these. They were fluffy, sweet and easy to make.

These pancakes were wonderful!  The only thing I "changed" was I doubled the cinnamon because I love cinnamon.  :-D  I didn't get to make the whipped cream because I didn't have any whipping cream readily available.  I'll due the entire recipes next time.  This is definitely a winner!  Thank you!

These were great!  I did not make the topping.  Increased the spices just a bit and added pecans into the batter.  The flavors were wonderful and the pumpkin flavor came through just right.

yummy! i'm going to try them with the Krusteaz whole wheat/honey pancake mix i use; that you only add water so would adjust recipe accordingly leaving out the eggs etc. i used butter and maple syrup instead of whipped cream. this is great to vary how desired...nuts, more pumpkin, varying amounts of spices.

Made almost exactly as the recipe says, and it was great!  The only difference in mine was a homemade bisquick mix and fresh pumpkin.  The homemade bisquick mix makes a much lighter pancake than the storebought kind.  Will probably use twice the pumpkin next time, though, because I really love pumpkin.  I tripled the recipe and stuck the leftovers in the freezer in ziplocks.  These will be great to stick in the toaster for a quick breakfast for the kids when needed.

5 stars no question!!!  These were an awesome change to regular pancakes.  My 1 yr. old ate them until I wouldn't give him anymore!  I made them exactly as the recipe called (minus the whipped cream).  Yum Yum Yum!

Perfect for a special holiday breakfast.  I couldn't believe how fluffy these turned out, but I also made my own pancake mix (2-1/4c flour, 4tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt.)  I refrigerated the leftovers and reheated the following day.  I can honestly say that they were just as good the second time around.

These are so good. I loved how fluffy they where. the only change I made was that I put 1/2 cup pumpkin instead of 1/3 cup. To me it didnt seem like it would have been enough. I still think I could have added more. After I made them for breakfast my husband told everyone about them all day. Thank you.

I had leftover pumpkin from a recipe I used yesterday so I made these. I cut everything in half. Reviews that mentioned a need for more seasoning caught my eye so I did add 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. The batter was very thin so I did add an extra spoonful of Bisquick and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.   The pancakes were thin and dense but very good. Next time I will use a bit less oil, only 1 cup of milk.  I don't keep heavy cream on hand so I didn't make the whipped cream but I am 100% certain it would only make these pancakes more amazing!

This was a quick & easy recipe. I used what I had of the seasonings and they came out great. Were a total hit and was asked for more! I used a dollop of whipped cream instead.

Pretty good, but I agree with other reviewers that the pumpkin & spices need increasing. I made 1/2 a batch as written and could barely taste the pumpkin. Will try again w/ more spice.

The nutmeg whipped cream is what makes this recipe extraordinary.  I folded the top pancake in the photo in half with all of that cream and ate it like a hotdog, and I was in heaven.  Don't know if I will for sure make the pancake part again (we prefer the other recipe on this site), but I will make the cream again.

These were wonderful! I made them Thanksgiving morning and they were a big hit. Everyone in the house liked them even the picky ones. I didn't make the cream topping, I am looking foward to trying it the next time I make these.

This recipe was extremely bland & totally doesn't deserve the title of "pumpkin pancakes". I used pumpkin pie mix (the already sweetened & spiced pumpkin in a can) instead of plain pumpkin plus the cinnamon, nutmeg & ginger. I even added an extra tsp of pumpkin pie spice & the 2.5 Tbsp of sugar to no avail. Definitely won't be bothering to try to revamp these.

These would have been great if they weren't so thick. Maybe at a higher altitude the cooking time is different but I just couldn't seem to figure it out.

Anything that yields comments like "You're the best mom ever" is a keeper.  YUM! I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the separate ones and these turned out great!  Don't skip the nutmeg whipped cream, it really is the perfect topping for these delicious pancakes.

Good!  Made them for Halloween breakfast.  Quite flavorful.  One taster said it tasted just like pumpkin pie.  I did not try the nutmeg whipped cream.  The pancakes taste good with syrup too.

These were so good! I only made the pancakes and they turned out so light and fluffy. It was a nice, subtle pumpkin flavor. I substituted honey for sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Perfect. These are going to be a staple.

I love making pancakes from scratch but it's nice to have some quick recipes using mix to go to. This recipe was the perfect taste of fall. The nutmeg whipped cream reminds me of a lite eggnog and my whole family loved these! Thank you!

I'm a huge pumpkin fan so these pancakes were really great however, I added more pumpkin after I made the first batch of pancakes because I didn't feel it had much of a pumpkin flavor. After I added more pumpkin they were wonderful pancakes. Next time I make these I will make sure to use 1/2 cup of pumpkin instead of just a 1/3. Thanks for the great recipe which I will be using every year from now on!

these were really great and easy! but, after the first batch i did a taste test and couldn't really taste pumpkin, so i added about 1/4 cup more and they were just great! i do like really strong flavors so i'm sure it's just me that needs more pumpkin!

Tried the pancakes -- didn't have the stuff for the whipped cream and I'm very sad that they seemed kind of bland.  I was very excited about this recipe and anticipating a bolder flavor.  Maybe it is because I didn't use canned pumpkin but pumpkin I had cooked yesterday and refrigerated.  I will definitely try this again (my kids are pancake fanatics) when I have the stuff for the whipped cream because I think that would add the extra dimension that the pancakes were lacking.

I made these to have for lunch with my child care kids.  They were a hit!  I made them exactly as the recipe said to, and they were super delicious.    I did not make the whipped cream.  They were wonderful with just a drizzle of maple syrup.  The kids all wanted me to make faces on their pancakes with the syrup so they'd look like jack-o-lanterns.  :)

didn't make the whipped cream, but made the pancakes with pumpkin pie spice instead of all the separate spices, and did end up adding about 1/4 cup of additional milk to thin it out a little, but it still had a good flavor.  I did the "spread it out with your ladle" when I poured onto the skillet/griddle and they came out thin enough and tasted great.  Daughter requested them a second time the day after Thanksgiving!  I like these!

Love this recipe. My extremely picky 2 yo and husband loved them. I added 1/2 c. of pumpkin and a little extra cinnamin and nutmeg and it was perfect. This will be a new fall season favorite.

Very good, followed the recipe exactly. Whipping cream is a nice touch, but not really neccesary.   Second time I made them I used 1 T white sugar and 1 T brown sugar. I also used only 1 cup of whole milk and upped the pumpkin to 1/2 cup. Liked that even better. Next time I will probably throw in the pecans like another reviewer. Yes, it's a keeper.

I added muscle gain protein powder and did not put nutmeg in due to realizing I was out after starting the pancakes.  I don't normally like pumpkin flavored things but had a can of pumpkin that needed to be used.   These were quite tasty and not too pumpkiny.

I used Krusteaz mix, 2/3 of a small can of pumpkin (1 cup), doubled the spices, added chopped pecans, a splash of vanilla and used a half stick of butter instead of vegetable oil.  Not the same recipe, I know, but it was awesome.  Thanks to the original poster for a good base recipe!  Next time: more pumpkin and spices still.

Made this for dinner after trick or treating last night, it was fantastic! I only had pumpkin pie spice so I used that instead and just used cool whip since I was being lazy, next time I'll make it all exactly as written. Can't wait! I also made ghost shaped pork sausage patties and green eggs, yum :) New Halloween tradition for sure, thanks!

OMG sooooo good.  It made a dozen for me, and three were VERY filling.  They puffed up as thick as grilled cheese sandwiches, and were even good cold later on.  I wasn't able to make the whipped cream cuz I didn't have any, but maple syrup was FANTASTIC with this.  I don't use ginger, so instead I used 3/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg....perfect!  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  The batter is thick like muffin batter....just leave it cuz it works.  Just use the back of your measuring cup or scoop to flatten them a little when you put them in the pan.  What to do with the rest of the can of pumpkin...?  Just found out you can stir a little into cream of wheat or oatmeal...or maybe portion it out and freeze it for the next batch of pancakes  :))

OK, Let me preface this by saying I am NOT one of those folks who's usually going to change a recipe and then review it according to my changes, BUT I wanted to make this SOOOO bad and have to follow a Gluten Free Diet, so here goes!  I made this using King Arthur Flour's Gluten Free Pancake Mix.  Using that, I could see by the box that I might need a bit more liquid than was called for in this recipe, so I upped the pumpkin to 2/3 cup.  WOWWWEEEE!!! WHAT A GREAT PANCAKE!!!  This stuff was AWESOME.  Cooked up SO easy, PERFECT consistency, and totally cured this GF Girl's craving for a short stack.  THANK YOU! for a great base recipe for me.  :)

I think I threw my family for a loop with this one.  It was very tasty but, I know my family prefers regular buttermilk pancakes.  They did agree that they enjoyed it and would eat it again around the holidays as a special breakfast pancake.

These were really good.. Although I would have liked it to taste more "pumpkiny", thats why I didn't give it 5.  Also, just a little side note... don't use Aunt Jemima Complete (it came out gritty).

Made these without the cream and they were a hit at our annual family Christmas brunch.  Just enough spice to be cheery.

I didn't make the cream topping. Instead of syrup I used agave. Delicious! I actually couldn't wait until I was done cooking the whole batch. I ate two just plain right away while they were hot!

Easy to make, I used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. Might need to make it 2 tsp next time. Not the recipe makers fault since I changed it.

These were more flavorful than plain bisquick pancakes; although I would have liked to have more pumpkin flavor. I might try pumpkin pie spice next time and up it a bit. I subbed 0% Greek yogurt for all of the oil in equal amounts.  I didn't make the whipped cream and instead served with maple syrup and butter.

Perfect pumpkin pancakes. I think bisquick mix makes the best boxed pancakes. I added two teaspoons of baking powder because it makes the pancakes softer and melt in your mouth.

Wonderful simple recipe. I used about 1/2 cup BRM whole grain pancake mix, rest bisquik. Added a lot more spice, maybe 3x, and added vanilla and pecans to pancakes. The whipped cream was wonderful as well, added cinnamon to it. Really felt light and was  very flavorful!

This is a good starter recipe, but it needs WAY more pumpkin and spices! I used buttermilk instead of milk, substituted brown sugar for the white, doubled or tripled the pumpkin and probably tripled (or more!) the spices. I just dumped a whole lot of pumpkin pie spice in after the initial spices. You can tell when you have enough...you can smell the spices and the dry mixture turns a light brown. Everyone loved them and the cream is such a nice topper! I also added more spice to the cream. I've made these twice now, and it's a keeper for us!

Yummy!  I substituted canned pumpkin pie mix because the store was out of canned pumpkin and then omitted the spices and sugar to make up for it and they still turned out delicious.

Perfect pumpkin pancakes! My 4 and 2 year-olds had 3 pancakes each, and they are such fussy eaters! Delicious!
