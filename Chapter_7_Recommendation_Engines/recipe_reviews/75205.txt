I took the advice that others have written (thank you!) and added oregano, basil, and crushed red pepper. I substituted regular tomatoes for grape tomatoes, which I added at the last minute (if you cook them as long as you cook everything else they will be mushy). I also put in significantly more feta than the recipe recommends. With these changes, it was extremely delicious.

Great EASY recipe for all those fresh garden vegetables (with a few changes).  I added oregano, basil, parsley, ground red pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.  Without the spices it was bland.  I used whole wheat penne pasta instead of spaghetti.

Was pretty good for being so quick & easy. I'm not a big fan of tomatoes, and with so much of them in this recipe it made it a little watery. My boyfriend [who is the vegetarian one, not me] gave it an "8" out of 10. If I made this again, I'd probably use more garlic and a little less vegetables.

Wow, this dish was really tasty--added a few extra ingredients to give it more flavour [some oregano, basil, pinch of chili pepper, lots of garlic, salt&pepper] 
it turned out great, just threw in whatever vegetables there was in the house and it was a major hit!

Quick and delicious dinner! This dish is perfect for summer. I did not use mushrooms (allergy); I only used half of a red onion and two tomatoes, and I added a sprinkle of basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes. It turned out well and was great when served with wine.

Made it as written and it tasted a bit bland so I added a few sprinkles of oregano and dried basil, as well as a bit more garlic.  It's pretty good as written, but it does need the herbs to make it really delicious.  Thanks!

Good basic recipe which could be made great with the addition of some seasoning like oregano, basil, s&p or maybe something a little spicier like a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. I would also julienne the vegetables instead of chopping them.

This was very easy to make.  The balsamic vinegar comes through nicely without any bite, and gives it a rich flavour.

This recipe would have been 5 stars if there had been suggestions of seasonings.  I found it to be a bit bland as written, but really good when you season it.  I used Italian season, onion powder, basil, salt & pepper.

Like others, added herbs to spice up. Had those fresh in the garden as well to use up.  Also, when cooking the veggies, I waited to put in the tomatoes until a few minutes after the other veggies to keep them from getting too mushy.

A very good vegetarian recipe.  I didn't know if there would be enough flavor without any spices added, but it really was excellent.

Not a good recipe and not worth your time!  I took other users' advice and added basil, oregano, and extra balsamic vinegar and it was just terrible.  It took me 45 minutes from start to finish.

This was tasty, filling and easy to make. To make it healthier I used less pasta in my dish. I also like that this pasta isn't high in sodium. The only thing I changed was adding tomatoes at the very end just to get them heated. Surprisingly my husband liked his pasta, although he is not a zucchini or cooked peppers eater.

The veggies of choice are amazing with this dish, and the feta cheese gives it the best flavor punch. The only things I changed when I made it is that I used some spices-- basil, oregano, pepper, and I used quite a bit of fresh garlic. Extra balsamic vinegar. And next time I'll use cherry tomatoes, as they are a bit tangier. I suggest thin pasta it balances the veggies well; there really is no need for a thick pasta that would hold chunky sauce.

My son who is a teenager just loved it. I used ww spaghetti and added s & P, a little more garlic and more feta cheese. Next time will add oregano and red pepper flakes to see what it tastes like then.

This was surprisingly good however I did add my own twist. I used penne pasta, canned diced tomatoes with garlic, bell pepper and onion. I also added some basil and Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes as well as a few green olives to give nice salty bite to contrast the balsamic vinegar. Finally, I topped it with some parmesan cheese. Turned out great, will definitely make again.

I didn't think my husband would like this but he did! The balsamic vinegar gave it the perfect flavor. This is a nice change from red sauce and a great way to include vegetables. I used whole wheat pasta. Very nutritious. Very good. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some basil and oregano and just a little red pepper flakes.

Awesome! I made it almost as the recipe instructed except I didn't measure my balsamic vinegar or herbs. I added generous amounts of both. I added the sliced tomatoes at the very end. Next time I'll use way more vegetables.

This was an excellent treat. I made it as more of a side dish and only used one cup of pasta with a whole mess of veggies. I did season the veggies with salt and pepper while they cooked, but other than that, no manipulation. Came out very tasty.

Unlike most others that made this recipe, I thought it was rather bland. I thought it needed more vineagar or salt or something to give it more flavor. If you're going to make it, I'd take the recommendations of others and add spices and/or more vineagar.

My husband liked it, I followed advice and added oregano, basil, salt and pepper and it was tasty.   Not a favorite for me though I think  it was good.

Delicious! I made it with the addition of basil,  oregano, red pepper flakes and extra feta cheese as suggested. I also used the grape tomatoes, which I halved and added toward the end. It was not watery at all. The key is to put pasta in the vegetable mixture and toss to coat over low to medium heat.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very good. Next time I make it though I will use less spaghetti. I added some artichoke hearts and a teaspoon of tomato powder plus salt and pepper and Italian seasoning.  I think I am going to try this using spaghetti squash. Thanks for sharing this.

I have made this recipe 3 times and it has been a hit at my house and boyfriend's house each time, with some tweaks. This is an excellent base recipe and you can change the vegetables and always end up with a delicious recipe every time. I always add basil, oregano, chili flakes and use grape tomatoes (which I add at the very end). I also double the balsamic vinegar. This time I added some organic, store bought tomato and garlic sauce (very little, just to add a little liquid to the recipe) and added a spoonful of brown sugar--delicious! The only reason I've given this recipe 4 stars is because it does not suggest spices and the recipe is extremely bland without them.

A healthy, lighter alternative to pasta dishes with heavy sauces.  I suggest adding the tomatoes last so they don't fall apart too much.

I did not enjoy this meal at all.  It was very bland/tasteless.  I am disappointed since I had high hopes for it.  Oh well, moving along.

I really liked this dish! The only change I made, based on other reviews, was instead of using chopped tomatoes, I got a can of Hunt's Diced Tomatoes with Basil and Oregano. I used red and green pepper as I didn't have any yellow peppers. Topped with feta, it was great. It took a minute to grow on me but after a few bites, I really liked it!

Loved it!  I made adjustments per other reviews.  I added the tomatoes at the end.  Plus, I added fresh basil and oregano at the end as well.  Very good recipe!

We LOVE this recipe - it's one we make weekly now!  I increased the amount of zucchini, added fresh basil, 2.5 tbsp of Italian Seasoning, and another tbsp of Balsamic vinegar.  With the spices, it's amazing :)
