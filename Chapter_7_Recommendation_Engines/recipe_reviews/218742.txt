I tried this recipe and they fell apart quite easily when being cut with serrated knife.  My suggestion is to course chop the pistachios before adding to batter.  Otherwise fantastic taste.  I will make these again with the chopped nuts.

Loved this recipe, I did add a few things.I replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with almond flour. I also added about 1/4 cup chopped and  lightly toasted mix of almonds and cashews(kept pistachio amount about the same..or maybe a little less?)  Couldn't find cinnamon chips. But it turned out so good! Have made several times, a keeper for sure. Thanks for recipe!

I never made biscotti so it was great to try something new. I found the recipe quite easy to follow. Unfortunately I didn't have the cinnamon chips, so I added 1 more cinnamon spoon to the mixture. It turned out great. Two pieces crumbled a bit while I cut them, but otherwise they turned out great!

I made a variation of this recipe yesterday with a friend of mine.  I substituted the cinnamon for fresh ground cardamom seeds and the cinnamon chips for butterscotch chips.  I also replaced the pistachio with walnuts and afterwards I dipped the biscotti in semi sweet giradelli chocolate and then in more walnuts.  I would say that they can out fantastic. The recipe works perfectly.  The only downside is that it's much more complicated than most.  There are a many more steps it seems for this biscotti than most other biscotti recipes.

4 stars as this recipe needs tweaking. Taste is great but..... I recommend to shape your log more into a biscotti shape because the dough does not change its shape too much. Then I would reduce the intial baking time as the bottom was too dark even with parchment paper when cutting into indiv. cookie. The top cracked and sawing was difficult to keep any kind of shape. I would def. lightly chop pistachios the next time. I would try this again just to see if the tweaking made it easier. But I have tried much easier biscotti before.
