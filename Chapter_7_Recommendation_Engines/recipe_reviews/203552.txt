This is really good!  I made it once without the fennel because it was unavailable, then again when I found it in a grocery store. Great both times! The flavors combine well, and it looks nice.  I have been eating this as a salad, not salsa!

This salsa recipe is just so yummy and fresh for summer cooking! I had some fennel that I got from our local CSA that I needed to cook, so I found this recipe here - thanks so much for posting it! It is fresh tasting, a bit crunchy, and is great either with pita crisps or other semi-salty chips, OR even better served over grilled salmon or chicken! I added a bit of lime juice too, and added an additional avocado, and used a regular cucumber from the CSA too, and it was perfect! I think you could also add a little dijon mustard (1/4 t. or so) or a dash or two of green Tabasco to kick it up a bit... but otherwise, it's perfect as is! My semi-picky husband and 6-year-old daughter loved it too!

I belong to a farm share, of which we sometimes get fennel in our share.   Having no idea what to do with my fennel, it said sadly in the back of the refrigerator.   On a quest for salsa recipes (for all my tomatoes) I ran across this and gave it a try.   Amazing!   I've made it a couple of times for cookouts, with rave reviews from the guests.   My only change is that I used fresh lime juice in place of lemon juice,  and I left out the banana peppers.

I tossed this with arugula and had it as a salad, and it was very good. I doubled the avocado and used shallot rather than red onion (I prefer the milder flavor), and I used a touch of olive oil to soften up the arugula. Next time, I'll add more banana peppers for more of a tangy/sweet kick. A nice, light, flavorful dish!

I had fennel I got from the CSA program from a local farm.  Having never used fennel before, I didn't know what to do with it until I came across this recipe.  FANTASTIC!  It's light, fresh, crisp and perfect for hot summer days!  Everyone loved it and now they are even requesting I bring it to BBQ's!  I used lime juice instead of lemon though, as I read in other reviews.  We ate it with pita chips.  I will definietly make this a summertime staple. :o)

This was a great combo of flavors.  I made it without the avocado and the peppers as I didn't have those.  We had it with tortillas, warmed refried beans and falafel.

Yummy!  The only changes I made were using shallots instead of onion, and agave instead of honey.  Eating it with a spoon!

great recipe as is.  I have made it several times.  it is forgiving with substitutions like parsley instead of cilantro, no avocado, added drained and rinsed black beans, pickles instead of peppers. A keeper. thanks for sharing.

Surprisingly good. I added in a little tomatillo-jalepeno sauce my husband whipped up for something else, just to give it a little bite. Also a finely diced beet for color. We used it in a burrito and also in salad, and it added both flavor and crunch. I'm making it to hand out to friends. Didn't have avocados and didn't miss them. Not something I'd eat tons of, but definitely fun and different and tasty, and very easy. Nice change-of-pace and party dish.

This is really good salsa! I bought a fennel bulb at the grocery store for the heck of it, and then went looking for a recipe to try out. I am so glad I chose this one over the risotto! I stuck to the ingredients, but changed the quantities to taste - absolutely fantastic!

I bought a fennel bulb because I needed the greens in a fruit compote.  Found this recipe via ingredient search.  Most of our family loved this salad.  Those who dislike fennel agreed it would still be an awesome side dish minus fennel!  Definitely will make this again... probably for company, 'cause this is a really different and pretty dish.

Ooo-wee this is yummy! I used zucchini instead of cucumber and fermented red bell peppers instead of banana peppers because that's what I had on hand. I added a splash of the lacto-rich cultured liquid from the fermented peppers and a dash of balsamic vinegar. I loved this served with a side of lightly steamed and chilled asparagus -- will definitely make this again for me & my girlfriends, but probably not for my kids (who wouldn't touch it).

I HATE fennel, until now.  This is so good.  I made it yesterday and I thought we would have it during football, but didn't break it out until now.  Very, very good.  Thanks for sharing.  Glad I took a risk on this one.

Mmmm. Big thumbs up!  Very fresh and perfect on a hot summer day. My only change was to sub agave nectar for the honey to make it vegan.

Gave 5 stars.  I really appreciated the core recipe, but I made many changes and really love the results which I wouldn't have gotten without the core recipe.  For me, I didn't like the idea of fennel and cilantro and the dressing sounded bland to me, but I like stronger flavors.

Substituted 1) Fresh Mint for Cilantro. 2) Jalapeno pepper for banana, as that's what I had.  I didn't include the seeds.

Dressing: ground about 1.5 tsp fennel seeds in mortar-pestle.  Combined that with zest from 1 lemon & 2 clementine oranges, juice from 1.5 lemons (large size) and juice from 1 clementine, and just about 1 tsp honey.   Plus salt & pepper of course.  That was the extent of my changes.  The mint & fennel with everything else was really marvelous and refreshing.

To serve initially, put on a bed of lettuce and added cooked shrimp.   Refreshing and delicious.  Would be yummy served with chips or fabulous on fish tacos, which may be what I do next with it.  I would also think about making this again and with addition of tomatoes adding in cold quinoa or bulgur for a tabbouleh like dish.

Really enjoyed this combination. Looking for fennel recipes, as I am trying new vegetables. Picked one up at farmers market and had no idea what to do with it. Very summery and fresh tasting. I added the avocado last right before serving.

Wow!!! I would give this ten stars if I could.  Be sure to chop veggies small and cilantro fine so the flavors mix well together and don't overpower on a single bite.  So delicious. I made exactly as written- next time I might add two avocados instead of the one.

Got fennel in last week's CSA, like others, I don't like fennel, but I LOVE this recipe! Added black beans so it's a meal. Shouldn't have used the fennel stalks, just the white bulb, but hey, a little more fiber isn't going to kill me. Thanks!!

Thanks for providing this recipe! It's so refreshing, I've made it several times now. We've used it as as an appetizer as well as a side. Due to food allergies, I replaced the honey with maple syrup and the onions with either chives or the green part of scallions and it still came out great.

I have been trying to reduce heartburn and fennel is amazing for that purpose.  So, I made this salsa.  I really liked it and it worked well for chips.  My boyfriend would probably have given this 3 stars.  I did find that it was a bit runny/liquidy, but I suppose you could simply pour out the excess liquid.

I made this for a second time yesterday.  It wasn't too wet.  I wonder if we measured the ingredients wrong the first time.  I took it to my cousin's and all of it was eaten in one day.

I can't believe it!  I actuallylike this and I HATE fennel (ok. I can choke it down but it is not my favorite...). Like another reviewer, I used lime juice but that was the only subs. Also used only 1T honey. The flavors really do each other justice. We will be eating this with homemade tacos tomorrow for lunch. Delish!

Interesting!  I had purchased some fennel by accident and didn't know what to do with it.  This was good

Wow this is good! I used only half the cilantro and honey called for.  Waited about 20 minutes and tasted.  Then I added another avocado, a couple extra banana peppers and about 10 leaves of mint (from suggestions of other raters - which I always read and appreciate).  So good!  Thank you so much!

Yummy!  I used parsley instead of cilantro and stevia instead of honey - trying to satisfy different diets and tastes.  And it was still amazing.

This definitely a keeper in our house. Loved the fresh taste the cilantro gave it and the crunch of the fennel. One change I made the second time was to mash the avocado and mixed it with lemon juice and honey then mixed everything together. We liked it slightly better this way.

Omgoodness! A wonderful change. Everyone loves it and the common comment is "refreshing"!  The only thing I might change is slightly less honey. Itherwise, delish!

This was delicious. I think it could be good on cold spaghetti noodles, in pocket bread with lunch meat, or on tortilla chips. We just ate it in a bowl like a salad..... Yummy. Will make again.

This was delicious as is. Didn't change a thing. Loved the freshness and the taste of the fennel. Makes quite a bit but lasts quite awhile stored in the refrigerator. Will so make this again.

This is an amazing salsa! Light, a little sweet, a little tangy. I've made it several times and each time it was a HUGE hit! Good with tortilla scoops or even better served with salmon or other fish!

I have given out this recipe more than any other. It's good the way it is, however, I tweak it a bit. First, if I can't find fennel, I use a second cucumber. Second, I perfer parsley rather than cilantro. I put only a dash of salt in, because I serve it with potato chips. I find the salt on plain, regular potato chips give it a nice salty flavor, and potato chips are lighter than tortilla or pita chips.  I love this recipe.

I left out the avocado & banana peppers & I did not like it this way. As I made it, the cilantro tasted very strong (and I normally love cilantro!). This recipe seems pretty forgiving, so I would like to try it again with avocado & less cilantro.

Very  clean fresh taste. I made a few changes due to preference and did not have some items.  I used lime juice (whole lime) instead of lemon because I just prefer cilantro paired with lime. I used a regular cucumber, and omitted the avocado. Also I didn't have banana peppers so I used the pepperoncini I already  had in the fridge. End result was fantastic.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it is wonderful! Don't be afraid to use the fennel; it does not overwhelm the recipe. It tastes delicious with pita chips and as a small relish beside your meal.

My cilantro had gone to seed so I crushed several green coriander seeds in place of the cilantro.  I worked great.  Love the recipe.   It makes a light summer salad treat.

This is so good! I used green onions because that's what I had on hand and we added Franks hot sauce. When you say Salsa it means heat to me. This had great flavor. I might add a jalapeno next time.

This was the first time I've ever used fennel, I had everything on hand to make it so that's what I did.  This was very easy tom put together.  I did use lime instead of lemon juice, just my preference.  Has a very fresh flavor that I'm sure will go well as a side or topping to fish or salads.  Very easy and yummy.

This was amazing. I am not fond of fennel taste, however this was amazing!
This would be great with fish. I also added some lime juice. Tonight I ate it in a chicken burrito with some cabbage and added tomato salsa to top off.

I personally do not like licorice so when i cut into the fennel and realized how powerful the smell was I decided to brown it and the onion (i used yellow as that's what i had) in my cast iron skillet with olive oil and then continued with the recipe. I also added tomatoes. YUMMMMMY! Will definitely do this again.
