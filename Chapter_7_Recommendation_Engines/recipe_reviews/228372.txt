I loved this affogato, I had made it before using another recipe with hot coffee, but icecream melted fast, then when I tried this i chilled the cups brefore filling them,I could not believe the many flavors coffee can develop just brewing it using cold water, I just came back from the icecream shop and will have it handy so I can treat myself again! Here in Buenos Aires is super cold right now but I don´t care! Tiramisú icecream was my choice and It was fab. It is terrific, cheap, & easy to to.This is a keeper!

This was just what I needed today! I prepared the coffee last night and threw this together at lunch today (after my morning, this was definitely a lunch time deal, lol.) The taste was great, not too sweet and not the least bit bitter. I wouldn't change a thing. Definitely a winner in my book, I plan on fixing it again soon!

This is so good! I dont really understand the coffee brewing method. I just used 1/4 cup cooled strong coffee. For the ice cream I used Edys half the fat French vanilla, and added about 1~2 tsp chopped chocolate to the top. It was so good, I made another one with PB2 chocolate to taste as a shake. Calories are not too bad either with 100 calorie ice cream. ty

I'm a big coffee drinker, and this might be one of my favorite ways to brew now. It doesn't have the sour aftertaste you sometimes get with overbrewed coffee, either. I may let it sit with cinnamon or ginger next time around.

Disappointed. If you want a nice smooth drink you don't want to wait for 12 hrs while it is cold brewing. Think we'll stick with using espresso & put in fridge, add ice cream & shaved chocolate.

If you are a coffee lover, you will love this! I can't believe I waited so long to make it. I made the cold-brew  in my coffee press and had no problem with having to strain coffee grounds. This is such a perfect after dinner dessert, especially for coffee lovers. I completely forgot the chocolate shavings and didn't miss them one bit.
