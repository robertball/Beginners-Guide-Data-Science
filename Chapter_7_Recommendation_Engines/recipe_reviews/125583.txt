This was a pretty good recipe overall. I did make a few changes to the dough. Instead of using all white flour i used half white and half whole wheat, it came out delicious. As for topping my focaccia i added fresh ground pepper, rosemary, and carmalized onions. As it started to bake i could smell the rosemary aroma wafting in the room. When i removed the bread from the oven i let it sit for about 5 minutes, then cut into it. The edges where crispy, not like the normal kind of edges you'd get if you make the yeast kind focaccia,i also think it's partly because when i tried to make the focaccia fit the pan the edges where the thinnest part. The middle of the pan is nice and soft. Overall it's a good recipes, but i'll probably try the yeast kind and compare it later.

This recipe was pretty good, but there's one really important thing: a whole teaspoon of cayenne pepper is way too much.  1/4 tsp would have been much better.  Also, it didn't rise as much as I thought it would, but that's probably just because it has no yeast.  I will make this again, but I will have to experiment with it.

excelent base and sooo easy!   top it any way you want, I used finely choped green onion,thym, sage, oregano, garlic powder, basil, cayene, grated marble cheese and lots of rosemary. It came out perfect!   It also makes a good pizza crust if you stretch it out over a large round pan, then top it with sauce, cheese and whatever your heart desires!  I have made it both ways many times, with many variations, always a hit!

What a pleasant surprise this bread turned out to be. Like some of the other reviewers before me, I had my doubts about a non-yeast focaccia and how tender it might be. I doubled the amount to make 2 loaves for a dinner event, (mixing in my KA w/ dough hook) and took the advice of one other poster to bake in my two round 9" cake pans. I did have to add a bit more flour (1/3 C or so)so that it would all come together nicely. It is a sticky dough but with well oiled hands, it settled into the pans nicely. I did let it rest in the pans for about an hour prior to baking. Don't know if this made a difference or not but it certainly didn't hurt it. It rose somewhat and was very soft and tender. I also topped with a parmesan, cheddar, mozzerella combo. Easy as could be, and great bread with on hand ingredients. Will make again.

It was 11 o'clock at night and I was in the mood to bake bread. Looking in my cupboard and fiding no yeast, I went googling for yeastless bread - this recipe came up. I had all the ingredients, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Incredibly easy! I had to add extra flour to get the dough to the right consistency, but it came out fluffy with a bard crust at the bottom. I baked it in a large frying pan, and it turned out beautifully. I HAD to add some rosemary to it. One of the easiest, most delicious bread recipies I've tried! Thanks a lot!

This was pretty good for a quick bread for a meal I made this with soup for dinner. Which was nice to be able to put out fresh bread in 30 minutes. I did have to add about an extra 1/2 cup of flour before it was able to be handled. And for the top I used Italian seasoning, garlic, cayenne and a little bit of salt. Oh and parm cheese.

This does NOT need any additional flour added to it.  This is a batter dough, which is meant to be wet & sticky.  I used a cookie sheet lined w/ parchment paper, and lightly sprayed w/ cooking spray.  It's quick to make, and easy to adapt to personal tastes.  I didn't use the cayenne pepper.  I added 1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning & garlic powder into the dough.  I used oregano as opposed to basil, and did a combo, of parmesan, mozzarella, and muenster cheese.  I will add this to my recipe box, thanks for sharing!

I have been using this recipe for a quick-go-to bread I think for almost two years; during that time each making returns a soft, moist, delicious bread that can be topped with ANYTHING you like--not just what the recipe says.  I have yet to have this ever turn out badly, so I eye the low reviews with a critical grain of salt. If you do not follow the recipes instructions to the exact when you make this bread, it's no wonder you'll be disappointed. 

I have literally topped mine with half the spices in my kitchen--it's a versatile, quick and delicious yeast-less bread.

Very different from yeast-made focaccia, I'd hardly even call it that. But still really good! I made some changes to the spices because I read the reviews that there was too much pepper. I changed the measurement to 1/4 teaspoon and it was STILL too much. I'll add less next time. Instead of garlic salt, I used garlic powder and onion powder, actually a good teaspoon of both, and then I sprinkled the top with coarse sea salt. It was super. I wonder if it keeps, though?

Great simple recipe that is quick and easy to make when I am out of bread (takes about the same amount of time to buy at the corner grocery/bakery as it does to make). Sometimes I vary it by adding other ingredients such as wheat bran or cornmeal and they all came out to be tasty,

We stopped eating yeast five years ago. This recipe is perfect! It doubles nicely. After baking the sections can be split to be used as sandwiches. For a change we divide the dough into two pans decrease cooking time pull out add toppings throw back into the oven. It makes wonderful, fast pizza dough. Many thanks to the person who shared this recipe.

Thank you so much! No yeast was the best part.I used it and stuffed cooked and spicy ground meat. I used the suggestion(thanks) not to use so much oil and I sprayed it instead. I did not have the sugggested amount of parmeson so I mixed in a bit of mozarella.

The dough turned out crunchy instead of fluffy. I know I should have seen it coming because of the absence of yeast, but I was hopeful anyways. I wouldn't make it again!

Great recipe, so easy to make and tasted really good. I added sesame seeds, garlic powder and Italian seasoning along with the parmesan cheese. I didn't feel like cayenne pepper but will try it next time.

Incredibly simple, yet impressive if you make a few easy changes.  Bake it in a 9x9 or round pan to give it more depth.  I added dried onions, Italian seasoning, and cracked sea salt to the top in addition to the cheese and other recommended seasonings.  Do NOT add the full amount of cayenne, 1/4 t. is plenty.

Thank you so much! This bread was delishh! I changed the seasonings a bit and I didn't have the cheese but it was still a great. I served it to my 6 younger siblings with some basic salad dressing which I added balsamic vinegar to. And caramelized onions and garlic. They gave it great reviews and were so happy they were even willing to help me clean up. If I remember to I want to attempt to fast on bread and water on Good Friday (I'll probably fail though)So this would be a great bread to make. Maybe I'll use some whole wheat flour though to make it a little more healthy.

My only problem was that I undercooked it slightly (my fault, I was in a hurry and mistimed the meal) however, it is definitely soft and chewy, and like others have said, is pretty versatile as far as toppings are concerned. Keep in mind, my bread was undercooked and still delicious, so give it a try! My boyfriend and I enjoyed it dipped in oil with herbs.

If you're out of yeast you land here.  My first batch was terrible, and heres why:  While stirring the dry ingredients into the wet, I never got a dough that would pull away from the bowl, so I kept adding flour.  Even while kneading it, I had to add flour.  My dough got tough and the baking powder rise ended way too early. Dinner was a dry dog biscuit.  On the next attempt,thanks to others comments esp. the daily gourmet, I got the dough into the oven right away without trying to make a dough ball or kneading.  Just stir it, dump it, spread it, and bake it.  It's very craggy but its great.  Very crispy on the outside, very soft inside.  I like basil dipping olive oil for the oil in the wet ingredients for flavor.  There will be no slicing this bread, just break it off and eat it- in 1/2 hour. Dare me to stir in some crumbled sausage ?   Thank you Julia, I've been wanting to make something good for years.  In the end, we experimented, then we ate it, and now we'll release our dangerous selves on the world.  (I wonder if my hard well water was the problem with the first batch ?)

Very good and easy! I needed something without yeast (guest had an allergy). It really didn't miss the yeast at all. Made the dough as directed (added 1/4 C flour) and let it sit until supper (6 hours). I sprinkled some applewood smoked cheddar, parmeson, and some garlic seasoning from Mrs. Dash right before throwing it in the oven. Very good!

This is so good! I made the dough exactly as written- in a Kitchen Aid, with the dough hook. I spread the dough into a round 9 inch cake pan which gave me chewy, soft, evenly baked bread. This tasted way too good to be so simple. I added pepper and fresh rosemary, drizzled it with olive oil and dipped it in balsamic vinegar - yum!

I've been looking forever for a focaccia bread recipe without yeast because I have never really used yeast before.  I used the dough recipe to make a dessert focaccia bread stuffed with a plum filling by adding sugar to the dough instead of salt and it turned out wonderful.  Will definitely look to this again, and could probably apply this recipe to different dessert pastries by changing the recipe up a little.

I came home from class tonight and found a half eaten loaf of bread on the counter. My husband made this recipe while I was gone & I ate the rest. It was delicious; like homemade artisan bread.

This was fabulous!
It was nice and fluffy, despite the lack of yeast (I'm not much a fan of yeast) it was just what I was looking for for a  last minute bread.
Thanks!

Very good and very easy. You can strip this down to the basics (no cheese, no basil etc.) and it's still good. I also add rosemary, other cheeses or whatever as I feel like. It always works.

I thought it was pretty good! Although I added some chopped roasted red peppers to the dough and parmesan cheese for more flavor. Then on the top added more parmesan and some oregano. Came out super tasty!! But way too much cayenne pepper.

This was tasty. Not like traditional focaccia, but yummy all the same. I topped mine with carmalized onions, garlic, and feta cheese. It was not hard at all as other reviewers mentioned. Maybe they made it too thin? I followed recipe, and it did not cover the entire bottom of the pan. I could have made it in an 8x8 and filled it edge to edge.

Loved this recipe it was great when supplies are low. I don't usually keep things like yeast laying around in my pantry so for me to have all the ingredient was great. For all those who just have Italian seasoning in your pantry this recipe works fantastic with it. I also just used Veggie oil instead of olive oil and it tasted just as flavorful. This bread recipe is definitely something to keep around!

I've made this recipe several times now, and I love it! It always turns out with a crispy outer crust and soft and dense inside- which is to be expected with a no yeast recipe (people need to understand this beforehand- it is going to be dense!). I have never had any trouble with the ingredients ratio (the dough is meant to be wet do not add more flour) and have tried several variations including putting olives and feta cheese in the dough itself, all of which were just great. You really can do anything you want with this dough it is fun to experiment with! Personally I find it a little more dense than I'd like, but that is what this is supposed to be and it is so easy and fast to make it certainly deserves 5 stars. Definitely suggest trying!

Thanks for this great recipe. I like that it doesn't have any fat! The first time I made it I followed all the instructions and it was really good. Second time I put in parmesan cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, fennel seeds, celery seeds, hot pepper flakes, basil and dried parsley in the dough. I think its better all mixed in with just a little paprika sprinkled on top. I like the way you can make it thick, thin, like crackers, or medium. The third time I added a cup of cornmeal and increased the water to 1 1/2cups, it makes a dryer bread. I think I'll try making a cookie version with cinnamon & Splenda.

Very easy with a stand mixer using a dough hook. Everyone should try this recipe if for no other reason than to get to know your dough hook.

I followed this recipe exactly. The dough was liquidy and would not form a ball, and so I had to add more flour. The result was hard and untasty. My family's response was "You win some, you lose some"...

Well, it was all gone, so everyone must have liked it!  I used 1/3 whole wheat flour and replaced about 2 Tbs of water with olive oil to make the dough more tender.  I did have to add a little extra flour and the dough was still sticky, so I used greased hands and it was easy to pat into the pan.  I had increased the recipe to 1 1/2 times, so I used a cookie sheet.  Not sure if I made it too thin, but it was more crispy than soft.  I also baked it on convection and probably regular bake would make it softer.    I used olive oil, salt, garlic powder and finely chopped green onion on top.  No cayenne, though a little would be nice.  My son wished I had used crushed garlic instead of powder and I agree.  I will try it again and maybe add just a very light smear of tomato sauce also.  I like the idea of carmelized onions too.  I think there are some good possibilities with this recipe.

Too much pepper. My boyfriend and I like hot and neither of us could eat the bread. I will make it again, but next time cut down the pepper and maybe add some spices to the bread itself. Was very easy and quick.

Really good if you know what to expect--this is NOT a yeast bread. I cooked this in an 8x8 pan and it was perfect, crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle. Used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour. Delicious and super easy!

This was just wanted I wanted, something that would bake quickly! As others noted, it's a batter-like dough so I didn't knead it or shape it into a ball, which also made it easier to pour and spread into the pan. I did stir it a bit too much, which may have affected it rising, but it still came out great - chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges. I tried the recipe again the next day and added an egg, which helped it rise more.  I improvised with the spices, including just a sprinkle of cayenne as opposed to 1 tsp.

My husband and I like how this focaccia turned out.  We eat it with pizza sauce. We appreciate the cayenne pepper seasoning as we are spicy eaters. I especially like how easy it is to make this dish.

I would not change anything about it.

This is so delicious and easy to make. I used gluten free flour and substituted nutritional yeast for Parmesan. My family raves every time it's served.

I tried this recipe out a few nights ago, and then again tonight. I tweaked it a bit tonight as far as toppings go, and placement of cooking. I moved the rack up higher in the oven (bottom was a bit hard last time) and it cooked beautifully. Tonight I took out the cayenne pepper, and added minced garlic, jalapeños, and sun dried tomatoes. Added a little parmesan cheese and TADA! I now have to hide the focaccia from myself :)
Great recipe. Will definitely make again.

This was such a surprise. Took 5 minutes to make by hand. I added rosemary to the dough, parmesan and cheddar to the top 5 minutes before it was done. The result was a tasty, slightly dense bread perfect for chilli, soup, pasta etc. Can't wait to experiment with other ingredients. I baked it in a cake tin and it rose a little and kept its shape. Am about to bake it plain for toast. Fab recipe - bread in  25 minutes!

I tried it almost exactly as written to use what I had on hand. I used cake and pastry flour (which usually makes my pancakes extra fluffy so I thought it would be great for this) and regular ol' "parmesan" off the shelf, not real parmesan. The dough was so sticky there was no point in kneading it on the counter. It blended perfectly well in a bowl with a spatula, and then straight to the baking pan.

The bread itself turned out flatter (about 1/4 in.) and chewier than I expected, so more of a pizza crust-like texture than something I would use for a sandwich -- but perfect for dipping in soup. Also, the parmesan didn't stick to the top at all, which made it quite messy to eat. 

Overall delicious, and made the house smell AMAZING, but I think next time I will omit the cheese and sprinkle coarse salt, or use something more "melty". I might also use a smaller pan to ensure a smaller shape and therefore a thicker bread. It was also very very quick to make.

Perfect. I made this according to the recipe, except to make it vegan, I omitted the cheese and used 1 Tbs of nutritional yeast for the cheesy flavour. I also added 2Tbs of flax seed meal for omega-3 content. Came out wonderfully!

Tried this tonight and paired it with a chicken stew I was struggling with.  The bread was REALLY spicy.  I think next time I'll either make it thicker or bake it for less time.  Also, I added mozzarella cheese on top of the parm.  Turned out okay.  Will probably make again and play with it a bit.

As a focaccia bread this recipe was a disappointment. It was too thin and crunchy to be served along side soup or any other meal that you would like a soft bread to go with. This recipe would, however, be SUPERB for a flat bread pizza or cheesy flat bread or anything like that. If that's how it was advertised I would have given it 5 stars! Last note - if you make it as is I would suggest cutting the cayanne by at least half - with the amount as is it is quite strong and doesn't complement the meal but instead becomes a feature in and of itself.

Pretty good if you don't have time for a yeast bread. I loved the topping combination (but only used a dusting of cayenne pepper.  Next time I will add a little olive oil to the dough to give it a bit more tenderness and flavor. Given the ease of the recipe, it is bound to be a new spaghetti-night staple.

This recipe was amazing!! It tastes just as good as a breadstick you would get at a high-end restarant. About the Cayenne pepper - I didn't put anywhere near 1 tsp, I simply sprinkled some on with my fingers. I also added a little more flour to it, and added a little olive oil to the flour. After It came out of the oven I poured a little white vinegar on it - and YUM. Goes great with soup! Thank you for this easy-peasy recipe.

Not sure what went wrong but this ended up bad. It seems to be a good recipe, based on the other reviews, so it might be a user error. Didn't have any cayenne pepper but it was the texture of the bread itself that was so unappealing. The backyard chickens loved it so it didn't go to waste. :)

You can make it in a toaster oven! Yay!

I think I did something wrong. The texture was great. The taste was blah. But I wasn't paying much attention. Next time, I will definitely follow the recipe a bit closer.

I was reluctant to try this recipe because of the mixed reviews, but I am So glad I did! I tripled the recipe because I have a family of 7 and this was going to be our main carb for dinner. I did a few other things differently which I believe effectively fixed the issue of the bread being too hard. This bread isn't going to be "soft" anyway you cook it. It's unleavened - so you shouldn't expect it to be fluffy. I didn't triple the cayenne pepper, added 1 tsp to the rest of the tripled ingredients. I cooked the parm in the bread and added crushed rosemary, oregano and onion powder. I coated my cookie sheet w/ olive oil and used my bbq brush to coat the top of the bread w/ olive oil as well. I cooked at 425 for 25 minutes and it was PERFECT!!! I will cook this AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!! Oh - and I mixed, balsamic vinegar and EVOO w/ salt and pepper for dipping - DELISH!

The recipe calls for way too much cayenne! It also tasted mostly like flour. I’ll have to see if a recipe with yeast tastes better.

Great versatile recipe, used less cayenne, added sliced olives , rosemary and parmesan.  Next time will put parmesan and garlic in the dough not just on top.  Also more oil on the outside the better

Ran out of bread & came across this recipe. I added dollops of Garlick butter instead of cheese. Yummy!
Thanx.

Needs less salt by a large margin. Changed to garlic powder and cut the salt in half.

This was wicked easy and exactly what I was looking for! Instead of olive oil, I used vegetable so that I could use cinnamon and sugar to make it a dessert bread. We dipped it in melted chocolate and sprinkles. A quick, easy, (CHEAP) way to get the kiddos sugared up for a sleepover. The boys got to help and they loved it (woohoo child labor)!

I make this all the time and use it as a pizza dough and my nine year old daughter loves it. I change the recipe just a little though due to gluten allergies butt it still comes out great! I recently made with 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of parmesan to substitute and it was amazing!

used this for pizza dough and stretched it out onto a 18" round pan.. Was a little thin and hard to stretch but will all do a one and half next time.. but overall it was a good crispy crust and loved it because it didn't need any yeast..

Ok so I have now made this so many different times. This is a great base recipe, can be a little dry. So an unhealthy Edition I like to add is half a stick on unsalted butter that has been frozen than shredded like cheese.  need it into your dough right before you plop it onto your greased baking dish. Don't need it too much or you will make your bread a little tough.   also I like to add about a quarter cup of shredded cheese into the dough directly, that also helps with moistening the focaccia bread.

I only used about half of the seasoning mixture and it was still super flavorful. I did end up having to use some extra flour because I literally could not work the dough without doing so. I don't know if altitude and/or humidity has something to do with it,  but I ended up using probably an additional 1/8 cup or more.

I used whole wheat flour and the dough didn't seem wet enough. I spread the dough evenly to the edges of the pan and it looked like pizza crust. Added the parm after 15 min and then took out at 20min. Turned out rock hard dense and hard to cut with a knife.

If you want fresh baked bread in 30 minutes, this is the way to go. Dough will be very wet but that's okay.  I chopped fresh garlic on top and sea salt, but you can top this with just about anything.

Made the dough exactly as told and had no issues with it. I put a rosemary mix and some Parmesan on top instead of what was suggested. Overall it was really nice but the time and the temperature were very wrong. At 425 my bread was done in around 10 minutes time. Next time I make it I'll put it in for maybe around 350 or 375 instead and see how it turns out. It was a little bland so I think I'll mix the herbs into the dough next time instead of putting them on top. All in all it was worth making again. Just needs some time and temp tweaking.
And I plan to try making it into pizza next time. It'd be a good pizza dough. lol

My husband loves this.   I made it to go with some white bean chowder and it was a big hit.     I don't think I would use cayenne again but that is a matter of taste.    You could use almost any spices that you like - or none - your choice.    This is now on my list of regulars for meals.

4.5 stars.  Very good.  I doubled the recipe.  I added some pepperoni and 2 cups (?) mozzarella cheese (one circle of fresh moz).  I didn't add the chili pepper or garlic salt (I didn't have it).  My oven only goes to 350 degrees.  It was done in 30 minutes.

I have never made bread before and was craving a cheesy garlic bread at about 2 am. I found this little gem thank goodness! I followed the dough recipe to a T, because what do I know? Plus it was super easy to mix up with my hand mixer and dough hook (never knew what that attachment was for!). This was way less mess than mixing by hand on a floured surface. 

I changed up the spices a bit because I did not have dried basil on hand. I added the teaspoon of cayenne, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 2 teaspoons of fresh flat-leaf parsley, 2 cloves of fresh garlic, sea salt and the Parmesan cheese. This was way too spicy but still so delicious. The bread puffed up in a few places and had just the right amount of chewiness. Next time I'll cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 a teaspoon and add in Rosemary. Still a great, quick focaccia for this first time bread maker!

This was so easy and so good!  I did chop up 1 teaspoon of fennel seeds and add it to the herb mixture.  I also replaced the garlic salt with 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I also cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  A really great basic recipe. So many variations can be made with this recipe!  I will never purchase focaccio again!

This was okay.  I mixed the herbs into the bread before baking. Next time I won't flatten the dough out as much.  The bread came out very thin and crispy.  I'd prefer it slightly softer.  I might also shorten the baking time.  I liked the parmesan cheese on top though.

not the traditional focaccia but very good - more chewy than crunchy but lends itself to be jazzed up depending on how you dress it with toppings.
a good starting point for sure

I goofed and put the Parmesan cheese in, IN the bread dough.
It was wonderful !!!

I happened on this recipe, planning spaghetti for supper. The yeast that I had on hand wouldn't 'proof'...

It's simple, and tastes great with the salad & spaghetti supper that I'd planned. I left out the cayenne altogether, and used a teaspoon of that "Italian Seasoning" we all keep handy, plus some additional dried basil from last year's garden, all mixed in with the dough.
Topped it off with a brush of olive oil and sprinkled, dried Rosemary, and highly recommend this for any Italian themed dinner.

I used Crushed Red Pepper/Paprika instead of Cayenne, Himalayan Salt & Garlic Powder with freshly grated Parmesan for mine. I used 1/4-1/2 teaspoon extra Baking Powder & +/-3 Tablespoons of Olive Oil. Soft center with a cracker-like crunch. I also adjusted the amount of water slightly, as with any dough it's by feel & texture not recipe to the T. I will use this again as a side dish/snack & appetizer for gatherings.

REALLY wish I had of read the reviews before I dumped a whole whack of cayenne on the bread!!! Super spicy is an understatement!! BUT AMAZING other wise!! Will DEFINITELY be making it again but with a pinch of cayenne as we are not into super spicy food.... You will get a good sweat going if you use all the cayenne!!! I like the reviews about mixing up the spices etc... Great base bread you can pretty much customize anyway you want!!! I used and 8x8 pan for a thicker bread and we dipped it in marinara sauce. Would be a great party food cut into strips to dip!!

Gave it 3 because following the recipe exactly gave me a super spicy  glob. I had to add more flour at least four table spoons and it still never formed a ball. Over all the texture was good and so was the flavour. I will make it again with the additional flour and my substitutions.

Way too much cayanne and that spwaking from someone who loves spicy food.  Also the center of mine seemed uncooked. Not sure if I spread it out enough.

Made this and LOVED it!! I made mine with soup as a last minute side and it was a hit!! However, you probably need to add a few more spoons of flour (too your liking). Also, I mixed garlic powder and a few other seasonings into the dough instead of putting it just on the outer part. I seasoned the outer crust with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and a little salt! Was amazing!!! Def making again:)) i am in love lol

I've been baking this recipe on and off for years. Its my go-to bread craving recipe. From start to finish I can have a meal put together and the dishes done as it comes out of the oven. I do like to add some herbs to the dough, plus some minced garlic. But I've used it to make foccacia, breadsticks, pizza dough, and mini focaccia without issue.

Made this when in need of a quick and easy pizza crust and was quite pleased with the result. I mixed the spices in with the dough instead of sprinkling on top. The dough was very sticky and difficult to work with, but ultimately worked well. Homemade pizza from scratch in thirty minutes!

I had made this before at my vocational class and brought the recipe home to make for my family. they have stomach acid issues so i cut down the amount of cayenne pepper in the recipe and it was still too spicy for them. If you or your family has sensitivity to spicy foods, i would omit the cayenne pepper and put a little more parm. cheese on it. i found that the parm cheese in the container works better than the fresh.

I thought this would go well with our sausage, onion and pepper dinner and I had everything it called for so I went for it. I had already started measuring out the ingredients when I saw that my baking powder was really out of date. Oh well, I forged on and amazingly it turned out great! I can't wait to try it again and get creative.

Disappointing.  The recipe called for a 9x13 pan. I used one that was smaller, but the dough still seemed too small.  I liked the flavor (added in some herbs, etc.) but the texture was like bread jerky.  It barely cut, and that was in an oven that actually runs a little slow. I thought it would be chewier, like the picture showed.  If I make it again it's absolutely going in a smaller pan!  Like a square.

I added rosemary and crushed red chili pepper flakes to the bread mix which really added flavor. 
After 20 minutes of baking, I pulled and added green and red bell pepper flakes with parmesan cheese and chopped shallot to the top with the drizzled olive oil and cooked for 10 more minutes.  Eating now with butter and it is excellent.  
I think adding something to the bread dough gives some flavor after reading all the entries relaying poor taste.  It's really good!

This SO wasn't "exquisite". It wasn't even "Good"! I was very disappointed in the texture of the bread, and the lack of flavor. It was like eating a wad of pizza crust with parmesan on top. Blech.

I let my 9 year old daughter make this with me and it was quite easy and pretty tasty. I used rosemarry instead of basil and put fresh garlic cloves on top of the dough before baking. I also omitted the cayanne pepper. We dipped the bread in olive oil and balslamic vinegar.

I liked this because it was very easy to make and we didn't need yeast or any unusual ingredients. The parm we bought ended up being bad so we didn't use that, and so that's probably why the bread didn't taste "exquisite" to me. But I think this is a good base for a potentially delicious and easy bread!

The bread wasn't at all what I was looking for. Flavor had no punch, if anything it tasted like fluffy white bread you purchase at the store. The herbs and spices to top the bread seem like a pleasant combination. Fun recipe, but not worth the effort.

I used this as a basic flatbread recipe to go with chicken kebabs, altering the seasonings to go with that meal.  I made the dough a little stiffer and patted it round, then baked it on a pizza stone.  It came out quite good and is a good basis for many other uses.  I used half white and half wheat flour.  I may make this as a breakfast bread sometime, making it sweet and brushing with butter and topping it with a cinnamon/sugar mix.

Fast bread, but not as tasty as Unyeasted Bread (this site) when baked plain (a little dry). Great for pizza or breadsticks, not meals that focus on bread. Didn't use cheese, garlic salt, or cayenne, and substituted spelt flour 1:1. Also, didn't use a food processor/blender. First, I sifted the dry ingredients plus an extra tsp salt thrice, then mixed in  seasonings (1/2 tsp each of sage, basil, oregano, rosemary). I added 3 tsp lemon juice (for more rise) to the cup of water and stirred it in the mix until just blended.

Tasted terrible. I did use less cayenne pepper as others suggested & it was still to strong. You couldn't cut it, the bread was hard. Not worth the effort even though it was easy to make.

I took other raters' suggestions and added an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  This was still way to sticky to work with.  Also, it was absolutely hard on the bottom - couldn't cut through it.  And it was not burnt at all.

Delicious and easy but best if eaten on the day it is made.

Delicious!  I didn't sift the dry ingredients (because I'm lazy) and used all whole wheat flour.  We LOVED this served with olives and feta cheese while we watched the movie "Australia".  perfect!

It was pretty good.  Mine came out a little tough, but the taste is fine.  that is to say, it basically tastes like a biscuit unless you add enough spices etc.  Be generous!
