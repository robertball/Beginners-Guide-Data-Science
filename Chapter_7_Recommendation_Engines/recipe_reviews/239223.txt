This tasted great. I changed the servings to 1 and put all of the ingredients in my large Allrecipes mug. After following the recipe exactly, even adding the black pepper, I realized I was out of pumpkin puree! I decided to microwave it anyway. I am glad I did, and followed the recipe exactly otherwise, because the base flavors are balanced well. After heating, I did still think it tasted like a pumpkin spice coffee regardless. I did spray the whipped topping on as recommend. I plan to buy the pumpkin and try it again though. I liked the kick to this and that it did wake me up. ty

This recipe encouraged me to finally try almond milk.  Absolutely delicious!  I now keep 1/2 cup containers of pumpkin pur√©e in my freezer  to whip this up when company knocks on the door.. Thanks getting the spice just right and the pepper is essential.  Don't leave it out

Took a while to make but it was worth it. I did add a bit more sugar since I'm not really a coffee drinker

Delicious! I used 2% milk and skipped the pepper. It needed more sweetener, probably because 2% is not as sweet as almond milk, so I just added a tad bit of agave honey and hazelnut syrup to taste. I like coffee, so I used half the pumpkin spiced milk with 10oz coffee and saved the other half of the milk for later. Will be making this again and again!

It was kind of Bland, and it really didn't need the Black Pepper. Re-made it again with more sugar to taste, Dutch Cocoa Powder, plus an additional teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice. Also whole Milk was used instead. That in itself made a big difference.

The ratio of spices to pumpkin to milk to coffee all seem perfect. My biggest problem is that I'm not terribly fond of the texture pumpkin gives to my coffee. I wonder if the blender would fix this personal issue. I like the flavor of this coffee though. I'm thinking it would especially be nice in the fall of the year when cool weather sets in.

I made the recipe as is the first time. Wow. Spicy indeed. The pepper is overwhelming. Cut it down significantly the second time around and it was pretty tasty!  2-stars as is, four stars after the adjustment.

I'm always open to trying new things, but I honestly didn't like it. Too much pumpkin pie spice, not very sweet, and adding the pepper was a no-no. I had higher expectations.

I used maple syrup instead of sugar but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. After tasting it I added more maple and more soy milk to suit my particular coffee preferences. It was pretty good.

I didn't add the whipped cream but I don't think I would have liked it any better.
