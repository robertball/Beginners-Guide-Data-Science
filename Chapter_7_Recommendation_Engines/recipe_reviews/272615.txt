I found a sirloin tip roast and used that for the meat.  I followed the recipe pretty exactly except I used the pressure cooker then finished it simmering on the stovetop until the sauce had cooked down to a thick consistency.  And I'm mildly allergic to peppers so I left them out and used a can of Ro-tel instead.  It was really delicious, and the meat turned out very tender.  The leftovers were incredibly delicious over eggs the next day.

Followed the recipe and it was a huge hit. Even my picky 11-year old son loved it. I was shocked! Look forward to making it again.

Followed Chef John's recipe and it was excellent ! I did use flank steak and I'm glad I did. Will definitely make again.

Loved this - and so did my kids! I used chuck and cooked it a bit longer. I might try with some tomatoes next time.
