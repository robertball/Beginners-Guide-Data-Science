These are spicy, as promised. The one thing missing is salt. If I make these again I will try adding a little salt with the spices. I used a heavy pan with a dark finish and my pecans smelled done after 12 minutes total baking time.

The recipe was very good. I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and salted the pecans. I think next time I make this I will add brown sugar to get that sweet/hot taste I love and omit the smoke flavor. great recipe, thanks

Very yummy. I used pecans, almonds, and walnuts. I added some salt, brown sugar, and cumin and omitted the smoke (didn't have any on hand).

I made these last night and they were a huge hit. My husband likes things really spicy, so I added more heat then called for and even I liked them. They are very addictive.  He took some to the office this morning and I can't wait to hear how they were received. I will definitely make these again.

Very good!  Nice and spicy.  Used fresh cracked walnuts off our tree, instead of pecans.  I had peppercorn medly so used that instead of black and white pepper.  I made this before I read other reviews so next time will add garlic salt.  Will definitely make again.

Disappointed. Made according to directions...no changes. Rather bland. A little salt might have helped bring out some flavor, but won't be making again. A nice roasted pecan is all I can say for it. Guess I'll use the pecans in salads.

Crunchy, spicy, perfection.  Have made this for years exactly as posted.  Big hit every time I serve them.  Try them;  you wont be sorry unless you don't do spicy.

Peppered Pecan Haiku: "Not enough flavor. I liked not using butter. But lacking in taste." I was anxious to give this recipe a try, as most roasted nuts go into the oven in a butter-bath, but if I were to try these again, the seasoning would need some serious amping up. (Salt, for starters, and maybe some garlic and paprika.) After they cooled, the taste was kind of "yawn", but later on, I mixed them into my Goldfish Gorp (pretzel sticks, raisins, mini M&Ms', Goldfish crackers) and only then were they alright, b/c they were just added crunch to other tasty tidbits.

Yum!  I did add a teaspoon of garlic salt for more flavor and spiciness.  Also, after reading through the whole recipe, I found that it was South Beach Diet friendly if you can refrain from eating too many!

I was looking for a recipe without oil, butter or salt and found this recipe.  So good!  I did do 2 things differently:  I used a mixture of nuts, not just pecans.  And I used parchment paper instead of spraying the pan.  This one is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly. As another reviewer noted, the recipe needs salt. Spicy hot but bland.

I used all the ingredients included in the recipe. I put all the ingredients in my vitamix adding 3 cloves of garlic, 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, and a shot of rum. I then smoked them using mesquite wood chunks in my Big Green Egg at approximately 325 for approximately 30 minutes until they were toasted. Be sure to stir them frequently about every 5-6 minutes.
