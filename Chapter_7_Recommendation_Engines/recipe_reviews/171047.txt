I followed the recipe exactly, only adding a tablespoon of cocoa powder and ommiting the chocolate bar. I also used half the amount of dark chocolate chips. The flavor of the cookies is good, but they were VERY VERY dry. Using the agave nectar probably added the much needed moisture to the dough. I plan on trying these again either with agave or more applesauce.

I didn't grind the oats because I like the texture the whole oat brings to a cookie.  Instead of using Splenda- I used 1/4 cup organic agave nectar and a little under 1/2 cup light brown sugar.   Turned out great!
