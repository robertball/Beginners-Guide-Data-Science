These were very nice. I was expecting outstanding flavour for five stars though and this just didn't make it. Next time I would add sweet chilli sauce, more tomato and garlic. Fresh basil is a must! UPDATE: I have now modified this recipe to suit our family's taste and I have to say that it is worthy of 5* now. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a whole can of diced tomatoes, doubled the garlic, more basil, 1/4 cup sweet chilli sauce, 1 tblsn of red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup oil and pulsed the lot in my food processor. Verrryyy nice.

For a small Oscar Party I made an arrangement of skewer recipes.  My friend Kristi ABSOLUTELY loved this one.  But a word to the wise, if you for some reason not to grill the shrimp and instead make it on the stove, BIG mistake.  I became lazy and mad waiting for my boyfriend and decided to use the stove and a skillet.  It had to be scrapped, the grill allows some of the seasonings to air out especially the garlic and adds a great taste that can not be replicated on the stove.

This is a super simple and yummy recipe.  The only thing I did differntly is used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, as I didn't want to open a large can of tamato sauce for such a little amount.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  Made these for a 4th of July party and they literally flew off the table.  After reading other reviews, I used the largest shrimp I could find, replaced the tomato sauce with chili sauce, upped the cayenne pepper, marinated them for two hours and then grilled.  People were raving about them and calling to each other to come try them.  Definitely a success.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

I marinated 1 lb. of shrimp (the frozen, peeled and deveined kind) in a full batch of the marinade (enough for 2 people).  I used dried basil, white wine vinegar, and extra garlic.  I then made a seperate double batch of the marinade with a huge piece of elephant garlic which I then emulsified in the blender and then heated on the stove. I cooked the shrimp in a skillet over medium-high heat until pink and served it over angel-hair pasta with the extra sauce and some parmesan cheese.  My husband raved over it and even has me passing out the recipe to his co-workers!!!  Definitely a keeper!

Just perfect and delicious as written, though I didn't bother with skewers since I only made enough shrimp for hubby and myself.  No need to change a thing, unless you feel some compelling desire to do so. Just enough flavor and seasoning--enough to be noticeable, but in a way that enhances the shrimp rather than overpowering its own wonderful and delicate flavor. This is an example of how using a few simple but flavorful and fresh ingredients is usually best.

OMG, this is hands-down the best shrimp i have ever tasted in my whole entire life.  this marinade is soooooo good..i think it's the combination of all the ingredients that makes this so tasty.  i brushed the left-over marinade over the shrimp while it was on the grill.  this recipe is highly recommended!!!!!  TIP: even if you don't have time to let the shrimp marinate for one hour, just throw everything together and brush the rest of the marinade on the shrimp while its grilling...it still tastes amazing!!

This was very good!  The first time we made it we used small pre-cooked shrimp and grilled it on the Foreman Grill (without skewers) and it came out great.  The second time, we doubled the marinade and then cooked the shrimp and marinade in a skillet and poured it over rice.  The heat made the sauce pretty thin so now I reserve 1/2 cup marinade and add one tablespoon cornstarch to it, then combine it all in the skillet.  *TIP: One thing I do different is I only use a quarter or a third of the olive oil called for.  It doesn't really add anything and it just kinda separates into this oily layer floating on top, not really blending with the tomato sauce.  Now I usually quadruple the marinade (with the exception of the olive oil) when using the marinade as a sauce.  We've also made this with small pieces of chicken and it is very good!  Thanks for this recipe!

I'll admit, I was skeptical at first....the ingredients seemed a bit odd together.  And then I ate it.  WOW!  This is fantastic, the BEST.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, and it has gained the highest rating in my cookbook, "The Standard", which means look no more for a better recipe!  It's the closest I've come to the best shrimp I've ever had in my life, which was at a Cozumel beach bar/grill and the owner was NOT coming out with the recipe.  This makes me fantasize a little less about HIS shrimp.  :)
ADDENDUM 2/16/03----------Still LOVE this recipe, and I'm delighted to find that it turned out great after just two minutes in my George Foreman grill.  Don't forget to soak the bamboo skewers!

Great stuff.  The only thing I did differently was keep it in the fridge longer...I think it was almost 2 hours.  I am a big seafood lover.  Have to admit the cayenne pepper scared me a bit....but it was just the right amount.  Thanks for a new shrimp meal.

I made a few changes -- I used cilantro instead of basil in the marinade (I didn't have basil) and balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar.  I then later added the marinade to a can of diced tomatoes (roasted garlic) and the rest of the tomato sauce left over from the marinade and sauted the shrimp.  I served it over angel hair pasta. Really good.  I'm sure it's great the orginal way too.  I just felt like having a sauce to serve with it.

I chose this to serve to guests at a dinner party - without a test run - because of all the terrific ratings it received.  I was not disappointed.  I marinated the shrimp for about five hours in the fridge and then grilled them and served them on salads.  The flavor was outstanding - folks were fighting for the last few.  About a week later, I marinated another batch over night and then made an extra serving of the marinade. I prepared a pot of linguine and grilled the shrimp - then, just before serving, I added the second batch of marinade to the linguine and heated it on the stove top. My husband tells me that this is probably his all-time favorite dish.  Incredible flavor.  The fresh basil is really the key to this recipe, so don't use dried spices - or you'll be disappointed.

Yum Yum!! I had a dinner party at my house last night, everyone wanted the recipe.I have been viewing this site for years and never bothered becoming a member. I did just so I could share with others what a great marinate. I served this on top of another recipe I found on this sight, Creamy Pesto Shrimp.I also made a great salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing. What a great dinner. Thank you

I must rave about this recipe! It was delicious, but I did improvise a little. I used Spicy Hot V8 juice instead of tomato sauce and white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. While the shrimp was marinating I boiled some fettuccine and chopped fresh aspargus spears into 1/2 inch pieces. Instead of discarding the marinade I put it into a large skillet, brought it to a boil, and added the asparagus. I cooked the asparagus until it was bright green and removed it from the stove. I added the cooked fettuccine to the skillet right before I put the shrimp skewers onto the grill. As the shrimp were cooking I mixed the fettuccine mixture over high heat. When the shrimp were done I removed them from the skewers and served them on top of the fettuccine mixture and garnished it with shredded asiago cheese. Everyone in my family loved, loved, loved it! It was sooo good I'm thinking about serving it the next time we have guests.

We love it, but I dont marinate or grill the shrimp!  I saute the shrimp in part of the olive oil and garlic.  Remove it from the pan.  Heat up the "marinade" in the pan then put the shrimp back in.  I serve it over rice.  It is one of hubby's favorite dishes!

We followed the directions exactly as given and even used yummy fresh shrimp we brought home from our Gulf vacation, but I thought this was very blah. Even with loads of fresh basil and marinating it for a solid hour, I found it just okay and my husband said it tasted too tomato-y. Disappointed for a five-star ranking.

Without a doubt the best shrimp marinade.  I forgot the garlic and it was still outstanding.  I marinated for 2 hours.    If you want the full flavor of any marinated shrimp recipe DO NOT use pre-cooked shrimp, it won't soak up the flavor nearly as well as uncooked.

This recipe is awesome.  I prefer to thread the shrimp on skewers then marinade it.  The marinade actually stays on better this way.  If doing it this way, you need to double the recipe for the marinade.  I also increase the Cayan pepper in this recipe.  For a double recipe I use 3/4 teaspoons Cayan pepper.

Wow!  This recipe is great!  I have had many different shrimp marinades over the years but this one takes the prize.  I marinated the shrimp for about 1 hr 45 min and then put them in a grill basket over the charcoal grill at about 250 degrees for 6-8 minutes.  Perfect!!!

Wow, this was incredible. I hate when people rate a recipe after making changes but thats what I am about to do. I did not have tomato sauce so I used half ketchup and half cocktail sauce and instead of red wine vinegar I used 1 T. of white wine vinegar and 1 T. of balsamic vinegar. I also accidentally used 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of 1/4 tsp. This dish still turned out better than i ever would have imagined. The wife and kid (11 year old boy and very finicky) loved it, as did I.

I cooked the shrimp for my anniversary dinner for two.  Although, I broiled them in the oven instead of the grill.  They were fantastic! I add a little extra spice my hubby is from Nigeria the land of hot spices.  I would definitely recommend this dish to others. Thanks!

This was WONDERFUL!  My husband and I are on Weight Watchers so I cut the oil to 2 TB (from 1/3 c) so it would be a little more healthy for us.  It was still great!!  This is definately a keeper!!

2011-06-19  I grilled 6 pounds of shrimp using this recipe for Father's Day & left out the salt and halved the cayenne per personal preference.  It was light but delicious.  I prefer a stronger flavor with marinades so I'll be doubling the seasonings when I make it again.

Very tasty! I added a little more garlic. Will use this recipe again but with a little less cayenne pepper...my 2 yr old said it was to spicy.

This was AMAZING! I kept all the ingredients the same, but I adjusted the amounts according to my taste. I served the shrimp over a salad and made extra marinade to use as salad dressing. Yummy! My 9 and 10 year old boys gobbled them up. I was hoping for left overs, but that was wishful thinking. I'm making them again this weekend! Thank you!!!

Yummmmy! The best shrimp I've ever had! I served this with Stew Cabbage (you can find the recipe on this site as well) and they went really well together.

Delicious, easy and no extra shopping required!  We didn't have any fresh basil, so I substituted for dried basil.  Other than that, we mixed up the ingredients in a 9 x 13 Pyrex pan, skewered the shrimp, basted each skewer, put some cling wrap over the pan, popped it in the fridge for 4 hours, then grilled.  It was outstanding!  Plus, only one pan to clean up.  Thank you for a new family favorite!

I squeezed a piece of fresh lime over it and poured myself a Margarita and Kansas City turned into Mexico.  It was magic.

Part two of the review:  I made this again (on the grill) and had Trimbach Riesling (Alcase France) white wine with it ($14).  Devine.  Saute spinach and black beans too.  Yummy.  This is a really good recipe.

Absolutely delicious.   I substituted ketchup, and can't imagine it being any better.    It was the hit of the party, and everyone wanted the recipe.
Edit: our local Sam's club has 2 lb bags of raw peeled shrimp - makes this recipe super quick as well!

Delicious marinade!  I let sit for about 4 hrs. I did not have red wine vinegar so i used half balsamic vinegar and half red cooking wine. Will definitely keep this recipe :-)  Would recommend using a little less salt.

I thought this marinade was OUTSTANDING!!  The flavor of the shrimp after it was grilled was scrumptous.  I didn't have tom. sauce so I used diced tomatoes and pureed them along with  other ingred. Some chunks of the tomatoes added to the texture. Just wonderful, will do again for company.

This marinade was delicious! 

I used double the marinade for about 2 pounds of shrimp just because of reading all the reviews that said it wasn't very strong-tasting. That worked well because I boiled down the extra marinade and we brushed it on the shrimp as they grilled. 

The weird mix of ingredients works very well together, I know it looks strange. 

But with 1,465 reviews (mostly positive), you know it's something you should try making. Right? So make it!

Delicous and easy shrimp marinade!  I had a pound of leftover shrimp from a dinner party (overpurchased) and wanted to use it for my family. While the recipe called for 2 lbs versus 1lb of shrimp, I used the same amount of marinade and it worked perfectly.  Also, substituted diced tomatoes for tomato sauce and cooked on stovetop.  Great result!  My entire family (including 3 teenagers) loved it!

I have made this recipe several times for family and friends and everyone loves it. I don't have red wine vingear, but use balsamic vinegar instead. I also use extra garlic, about 5 cloves.The more the better. I am going to try marinating chicken in this and I'm sure it will be wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

Couldn't be easier!  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I had to use dried basil instead of fresh and decreased the cayenne to 1/8 teaspoon for fear that it would be too hot for the kids.  It was perfect!  If you haven't tried this recipe, you don't know what you're missing!

I altered this recipe a little...I used smaller shrimp, used tomato sauce with basil and oregano and then sauteed it.  I then served the shrimp over a rice pilaf with a little of the marinade "sauce" and it was wonderful!!!  I can't wait to try it on the grill!

Even with 2 kids 2 yrs and under to care for, this recipe was pretty simple to put together.  The best part was that my 2-yr old ate the shrimp with us!  We will definitely use this recipe more this summer.

This is truly a wonderful marinade.  It is very quick and easy to make.  I served the shrimp over rice with chopped broccoli on the side.  It is a very colorful and tasty dish.  Makes a wonderful, quick company dish.  I highly recommend!!

We love grilled shrimp and this recipe is  now our favorite!  I do 6 cloves garlic abd substitue sweet chili sauce in for the tomato sauce.  We like a little spice, so I add 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Goes great with fettuccine alfredo!  We eat this about every other week!!!

I made this tonight, but used a can of diced tomatoes since i didn't have tomato sauce.  I let it marinade for less than an hour before skewering and grilling.  WOW!  It's amazing!!!  I'll definitelly be making this again for sure!!!

So good! I used thawed frozen shrimp and cooked this in a pan just for a few minutes, long enough to warm it up. I added about a half teaspoon of Sambal Oelek garlic chili sauce, but I can see completely enjoying it without that too. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Not a very strong marinade flavor which is perfect for the delicate meat of shrimp. I was out of plain tomato sauce and substituted Newman's Own bottled Marinara. It was very good.

From one Perez to another.....THIS WAS SUPER DELICIOUS! I made it exactly with all the ingredients and I loved it. I made 4 skewers with 6 huge shrimps on them and marinated for 30 minutes. No need for longer marination because these skewers were packed with flavor!!! This is going to be a staple in my home along with a great "go to" recipe when I have visitors or have to bring a dish along to someone's home. I still have more shrimp in the freezer and guess what?? I'm makinng this again tomorrow!!!!!! Great, great, great find. THANKS!!!!!

I've been making this recipe for two years now, and I never rated it!!  Shame on me.  These shrimp have been the star of many get-togethers at our home.  I remember making them for my daughter's first communion party, and everyone raved about them.  Tonight I served them with long-grain rice and grilled asparagus with parmesan cheese.  This is my go to recipe whenever I'm in the mood for shrimp.  I make it frequently when the basil in my garden is plentiful, as I hate spending $2.88 for a small bunch in the grocery store!!  My kids love this recipe too.  If you haven't tried this one yet, you must.  It's a keeper!

This was full of flavor.  I used homemade speg. sauce that I made ealier in the week. I  also cut up two fresh jalapinos and let it sit in the marinaide as well.  We used a grill pan with the holes in it to grill.  It was nice and spicy and full of flavor.  I only used 1.5 pounds of shrimp and had just enough sauce... I think two pounds of shrimp would of been too much for the sauce. I will for sure make this again.

I have been making this for over a year and everyone thinks it is just fantastic!  I have tweaked it a little...I use ketchup instead of tomato sauce and I add 1/4 cup of sweet red chili sauce.  Also, make sure you use either fresh basil or the basil that comes in those squeeze tubes in the produce section!  I also found it easier to place the shrimp in grilling baskets then on skewers.

best recipe I've tried. It's always a challenge pleasing 3 kids & this recipe was a big hit. The kids said that they thought it tasted like a dish from an expensive restaurant. I doubled the sauce & used seasoned diced canned tomatoes instead of plain tomato sauce. Fantastic over angel hair pasta using the warmed marinade as sauce!!!

This is quite possibly some of the best shrimp I've ever had.  I've made them twice, once grilled and once pan fried.  I've also tried with fresh and dried basil.  I prefer it with fresh basil.  Also, I think next time I make it.  I'm going to make extra marinade to reserve on the side.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers I'm eating today!

This turned out really good.  I set aside some sauce and added cornstarch and cooked shrimp in a skillet on the stove with the sauce.  Served over rice.  Really yummy.

A great and simple recipe. You don't even have to wait 30 minutes to an 1 hour as the recipe calls for. Do not change any of the ingredients. They make all the difference. I will definetly use this recipe again.

I made a few changes to add more flavor!I used tomato paste and a little water to make a thicker marinade that would cling to the shrimp for better grilled flavor.  I also added a little sugar so the sauce would carmelize on the shrimp as it grilled.  I soaked wooden skewers in water for 30 min.  so they would not burn on the grill.  The shrimp turned out very nice flavored and we enjoyed them very much.

Fabulous! We used a grill basket rather than skewers; it held exactly 2 pounds. When it had cooked 3 minutes on one side, we simply flipped over the basket to perfectly cook the other side. This is the ONLY change I would suggest.

This was such an easy recipe, and flavorful without overpowering the shrimp or other flavors in the meal. 
We made it exactly as listed, but cut the recipe in half as there were just 2 of us, and it came out just fine. 
I will certainly consider this for company as well.

At first I was a little doubtful because the marinade didn't smell yummy.  I ended up having to marinate the shrimp overnight instead of an hour and when I opened the bag up for grilling it smelled scrumptious!!  Cooked even better.  Thanks!

FLAVORFUL! I did use ketchup, as one reviewer did, I used balsamic vinegar instead, and used 1 t dried Italian seasoning instead (only because I was missing the ingredients the recipe called for). TASTY! Then I was only cooking for my little ones who wouldn't appreciate the labour of skewered shrimp, so I pan fried them for a few minutes, drained the liquid into a bowl and then let the shrimp get a little crispy, then added some of the liquid back in to coat them. Thanks for the great starter recipe!!

I have made this recipe 4 times in the past month.  It is the most flavorful marinated shrimp I've ever had.  I had to substitute white wine vinegar for red wine vinegar b/c that's what I had in my house and it's still fabulous.  I made it for my relatives and everyone loved it and it's so easy.

I was only making 2 skewers' of shrimps, but I made enough marinade for about 4 servings. While I cooked the shrimp on the Foreman grill, I simmered the marinade on the stove. I poured it over angle hair pasta, and topped with the shrimp. Husband enjoyed it. Thanks, Rachel!

This was delicious.  My father-in-law wolfed down 5 skewers.  I bought frozen shrimp that was already peeled and deveined.  Couldn't get much easier.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

Made this exactly as described and they were spectacular.  I served them on top of Italian style polenta for a spin on shrimp and grits and it was a huge hit.  Will be making many times again.

Update:  In the winter months (and summer months when I'm too lazy to grill) I just dump the shrimp and marinade right into a large skillet.  A little different flavor without the grill, but still great.

Made this as written with 50% more cayenne as noted by other reviewers.  I used a bit less salt. Everyone loved it grilled. The most important part is not over cooking it. I grilled my shrimp on a medium heat for 3 minutes a side and texted it by poking them for doneness. Then did some an extra minute.

ok, like this really needed another large thumbs up. that being said..it is what it is...5 stars! i used fresh heirloom maters, elephant garlic, shallots and variaged basil. added a pinch of salt and honey. it marinated @ 10 hours. i pan fried this until shrimp turned pink. maybe 20 miuntes started from a large cold pan, mh. raining like crazy outside, no grilling. i used large shrimp. an excellent recipe that can beadapted to personal  tastes as long as you follow the the sweet/heat diameters.  i used an immersion blender in a short -sided glass bowl...don't use a short-sided bowl, believe me   :)

Heavenly shrimp!! My sister made these as an appetizer for Easter & it almost spoiled our dinner appetite, we all ate so many! I went straight home to look up the recipe & made some of our own. Dried basil worked just fine (Sis used fresh). I would add more cayenne if you want to feel the kick.

My BF and I loved this recipe with a few tweaks to "kick it up a notch". I used Emeril's kicked up tomato sauce, about a tablespoon of Frank's hot sauce, a sprinkle of black pepper and chili powder and I doubled the cayenne. Absolutely De-LISH!! 100 stars. Thank you!

My husband has deemed this the best marinade ever.  We use it for shrimp, beef and chicken.  Whatever we marinade turns out delicious each and every time.  You can use crushed dried basil instead of fresh and it is still wonderful.

This was excellent! Instead though i marinated it for over 24 hours and heated it up on the stove. I cooked up a Pastaroni angel hair box and tossed the shrimp and marinade in it and let the sauce reduce. It was amazing! Great flavors.

This was truly wonderful!  Living in a small apartment, we were not able to grill them, so I simply cooked the shrimp with some of the marinade in a wok.  And we made a surf and turf dinner by adding a small steak on the side.  Simply fantastic, and I didn't deviate from the menu at all.  YUMMM!!!

Excellent marinade - I didn't have any fresh basil and had to use dried, but the recipe was still wonderful. Since it's miserably cold outside, the Foreman grill was popped open and the shrimp still tasted great - we'll use this again and again. Thanks for posting!

Excellent as is. I made this recipe exactly as stated however i marinated it overnight and used dried basil instead. The shrimp tasted strong but i liked it i recommend following exactly as stated(marinate 2 hrs tops) but it definitely taste better than any restaurant I've been too. Use fresh basil as stated because that is one of the stronger tastes in this recipe and having it fresh probably makes it taste even more amazing.

Good, but not amazing.  I felt that Robbie Rice's grilled shrimp recipe surpassed this one.  We tried them both tonight and everyone agreed that this just isn't as good.  If you're looking for a milder flavor, however, this one might be better.  Robbie Rice's is a tad spicy (but coming from someone who doesn't like shrimp OR spicy food, Rice's is still awesome).

This was easy to prepare and delicious!!  I threw a tad more of the wet ingredients in to make more marinade and I used both dry and fresh basil.  My kids loved it and wanted more!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Amazing!  I like to grill shrimp sometimes as a side dish with steak so I only bought a little over a half pound.  I subbed ketchup and used the equivalent of double the cayenne pepper to offset the ketchup's sweetness and only a drizzle of olive oil.  I have to tell you, the shrimp tasted like it had been drenched in butter! We all devoured it!

Delicious!  I used crushed red pepper in place of cayenne and decreased the amount of oil, but otherwise left everything the same.  I made an extra batch of the marinade to toss with pasta.  I will definitely be making this again!

These were so simple to prepare (other than cleaning 2 pounds of shrimp) and had such a nice grilled flavor that complimented and enhanced the good shrimp.  These disappeared from the table.

I followed recipe as is, next time I may kick up the heat a little in cayenne...but perfect as is.

I followed the basics in the recipe, but added a small finely diced serano pepper (sans seeds), 2tbsp finely diced red onion, and 1/2 tsp cumin.  I used a basil, oregano, and garlic tomato sauce and marinated everything for about 15 minutes refrigerated and 5 on the counter top.  I decided to cook this in a pot because I wanted to use the sauce.  Served over rice.  BF LOVED it, would give this 5 stars because it reminded him of ettouffe, expect with a little kick.  I'll save for when it gets colder and keep my changes as is.

So simple, so delicious.  Ive tried a lot of shrimp recipes and this one is the best. I added a bit more cayenne since we like a bit more heat.  So good.  I would also cut back on the salt if you don't use a full 2 pounds. I had about 1 1/2 pound of shrimp and half tsp was too much.

Wow! This is an incredible marinade! I'm not really big on "spicy" but the use of the cayenne pepper was perfect! Just a hint of heat. I made this as written. Marinated for 2 hours. My guests devoured this! I also used the "Tzaktiki" recipe as a dip for this shrimp and found it was a perfect compliment of flavors!!  Thanks *Blondieperez* for this excellent recipe!! It will be enjoyed regularly at my house!!

These were awesome! I didn't have much time to prep before grilling - maybe 30 or 45 minutes. I used what I had on hand, meaning I subbed ketchup, and I used a few pinches of a spicy blend of herbs, plus about a 1/2 cup beer for good measure. Covered it all and let it marinate in the fridge for 20 or 30 minutes. Skewered and grilled following the directions and they knocked everyones socks off. This is my new favorite!!

This is good but lacking flavor. olive oil needs to be decreased so that the shrimp can absorb all of the yummy flavors. Skewer and throw on a grill!

Verrrry delicious! This was such a simple/fast recipe to throw together and the result was a great amount of flavor, talk about instant gratification!  Right before serving, I mixed 1cup cooked orzo in with the marinade and shrimp.  Next time I will add way less oil though, maybe 2T, otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Great recipe!  Definately don't need cocktail sauce. I used just shy of a 1/4 cup of ketchup with about 2 tblsp of water instead of the tomato sauce since I didn't have any plus I didn't have to come up with a recipe to use the rest of tomato sauce.

I made this dish on a whim just to try cooking shrimp, and boy was it great! I didn't have red wine vinegar, so instead used apple cider vinegar, which was a fine substitution. I let the shrimp marinade for about 2 hours, turning them in the refrigerator just to make sure all of them were getting coated and soaking in the flavor. I (unfortunately) had forgotten to buy fresh basil at the store and had to use dry basil. I was surprised that it still yielded a scrumptious marinade, although next time i will try the basil fresh instead of dried. I used a little sandwich grill inside and did not need to oil the grill because it was non stick. Make sure to watch them as they cook fast!

Delicious marinade!!! I will use this recipe again next time I marinate shrimp. Very easy to put together. I did use tomato juice because it's what I had on hand. Picked basil from my garden. So fresh and perfect for a hot summer night!!!

I really liked this as a marinade for grilled shrimp but I REALLY loved this recipe as an actual dressing for a cold shrimp salad.  I had leftover shrimp from the night before and I tossed the shrimp with fresh tomato, cucumber and the leftover marinade (do not use any leftover marinade that the raw shrimp touched).  A pinch of finishing salt....delicious!  I will be using this recipe in the future both as a dressing and a marinade!

This was easy and good but not great. I still love Alton Brown's broiled shrimp recipe.  We used V8 instead of opening an entire can of tomato sauce.

This was outstanding! I only had 20 minutes to marinate and it could have stood a little bit longer. Overall it was the best homemade shrimp I have ever had or made! Even my 5 year old loved it!

Oh wow, this is delicious. As someone who does not like shrimp, I prepared this for my husband. As I was making it, however, I could not resist trying one as it smelled like heaven in my kitchen. I LOVED IT! I could not believe that I ate half of what I made (no leftovers! ha!) This is a keeper and one I will definately be making again.

Shrimp was great!  Would go well with a key lime alioli.  If making for guests, would cut down on the cayenne just in case.

Made this exactly as the original recipe suggested--but substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce and 1 1 and 1/2 tablespoons dried basil for the two tablespoons of fresh basil.  I didn't even marinate at all, just put the shrimp, with marinade on the stovetop griddle and cooked for about 4 minutes first side, 3 minutes second side.  The marinade was AMAZING!  I have done this in saute pot before too and the sauce was so good it could have easily been used as a soup base or pasta sauce.  My boyfriend said "Wow" (nodding his head) "Remember this one!"  It wasn't too flavorful, but he liked how it didn't mask the shrimp flavor.

I served this with Italian Kale.

Finally, a recipe I had to rate!  At first bite, my husband and I looked at each other in happy amazement. The marinade thoroughly and deliciously flavored the shrimp (I marinated them for about 2 hours) and the hickory charcoal just added to it.  I made 12 large shrimp (1 lb.), cut the oil to 2 T. and used dried basil.  Took a chance and used the full 1/4 tsp. cayenne - perfect!  I would make at least half again the amount of marinade for 2 lbs. of shrimp.  Thanks for a most delicious recipe, Blondieperez!  I'm going to try the marinade on chicken breasts.

As is, my guys thought this recipe was average.  It seems like many of the grilled shrimp recipes I've tried need adjustments when it comes to spices and heat. They like it spicy!

This is awesome as a shrimp appetizer! For the tomato sauce, I substituted Taquera salsa, a tomatillo and Chile de Arbol sauce that I found at Trader Joe’s. Since this is very spicy salsa, I omitted the cayenne pepper. I also used cilantro instead of basil to better blend with the flavor of the salsa. I would recommend marinating the shrimp for a full hour to allow all of these wonderful flavors to be thoroughly absorbed prior to grilling. You can cook the shrimp on an indoor grill pan, which eliminates the need for the skewers; just flip them over with a pair of tongs. I left the tails on the shrimp, which makes for a fun finger food!

This recipe is wonderful: easy, tasty, and healthy.  I grilled the shrimp on my Foreman grill because I didn't want them to stick to the barbeque, and they came out just perfect.  Would definitely make again, even for guests.

I'm not a huge fan of shrimp, but since we went shrimping this year and have a freezer full I had to figure out something.  I get 99% of my recipes from this site and have yet to rate a recipe until this one.  This recipe is super amazing! Even though I had red wine vinegar on hand I used balsamic instead, ketchup instead of tomato sauce and dried basil. I soaked for a couple of hours and threw on BBQ.  I don't think I will try any other shrimp recipes....this one is a WINNER!  I did add twice the amount of cayenne since I am a spicy junkie :)

Cooked the shrimp in a skillet on the stove top with the marinade and used as a sauce (since it was snowing out side and the grill was not really an option).  Served up the shrimp with red beans and rice, poured the sauce over the top.  What a great dish!!!!!!!!!  Strongly recommend

I doubled the garlic. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried basil but I used 3 tbs instead of 2 tbs. I also subtitute 2 cubes of beef bouillon instead of using red wine vinegar. It was very yummy!!!

Excellent! Only 2 changes: had to use dried basil, and cooked in a 425 degree oven for five minutes instead of skewering and grilling. Loved the flavor! Definitely a company-worthy dish.

This needs more than 5 stars!!!   It is SO good, so very very good!   Simple ingredients, quick & simple to make, and comes out tasting fabulous.  No need to look further for that one wonderful shrimp recipe -- this is the one -- just FOLLOW THE RECIPE (I realize this is difficult for some of you :) and you will have amazing results.   I made this for Valentines Day, and we are having it again the next night -- he has not stopped raving about it yet!

Very good recipe. I just put these all in a ziploc bag with the shrimp for an hour or an hour and a half and tossed them on the grill on skewers. It was a big hit at the party, very good flavor. I upped the cayenne a bit to get a bit more heat.

Delicious recipe... the only thing I added was a tablespoon of asian garlic chile sauce for a little heat. It was perfect!

This is the reason why I love Allrecipes. This is my very first recipe that I've ever tried doing in this website. It was definitely an instant hit in my family. And I've been doing this over and over again. Thank you BlondiePerez for sharing this =)

My daughter (very fussy eater!) said it tasted like restaurant shrimp and is begging me to make it again soon.  I didn't have tomato sauce handy, so I used organic ketchup, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I had to cook it in the broiler, but it came out just fine.

I like to double the vinegas and add some brown sugar.  Instead of cayenne pepper I like to use siracha hot sauce.  The fresh basil really makes the recipe!

This recipe is amazing! The four of us ate all 3 pounds of shrimp and probably could have eaten more! I usd a combo of red wine vinegar and white wine vinegar, but otherwise followed the recipe. I made extra marinade to baste the shrimp while on the grill. I will defintely make this again and again!

I followed the recipe just as it is written.  They were the best shrimp I have ever prepared on the grill for dinner.  Dinner consisted of the shrimp over rice with carmelized fruit on the grill and grilled vegetables.  I will use the original recipe but will now add to it to maybe spice it up even more.  This is a keeper and I may share it with others.

My FAVORITE Shrimp recipe!!!! I LOVE the flavor of the sauce. DO NOT THROW AWAY THE SAUCE, its way too good! I cook the shrimp and the sauce together on stove top.  Took less than 5 mins to cook.  Pour the Shrimp and lots of sauce over a bed of roasted potatoes, onions and bell peppers.  My Boyfriend was so impress with this dish.  I'm so glad I found this recipe.

Wow!  This recipe is delicious.  I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce.  Didn't change anything else.  I made extra and had to hide some for me because they vanished in a matter of seconds.  Great recipe, will make again and again.  Thanks

Wow! I was surprised how delicious and yet so simple this recipe is. I was concerned the tomato sauce was not going to have enough zing. Instead, I used chili sauce. A keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! Definitely will be making this one repeatedly! I use a grill basket for shrimp on the BBQ. It is easier than putting them on skewers, but the result is the same. Thanks for a great recipe!

Hubby and I grilled shrimp for the first time.  We decided to try this and the Basil Shrimp recipe also on this site.  This was my husband's favorite, while I preferred the Basil Shrimp.  But I agree this was very good.  I definitely would cut down on the oil next time.  These shrimp were a little greasier than the other recipe.  And I think I want to try doubling the spices as another reviewer suggested.

This is a good and simple recipe. I used easy peel shrimp as they cook more evenly on the grill without drying out.

People beg me to make this.  Perfect on the grill.  Remember to soak the skewers (if wood) to prevebt them from burning.

These are very tasty. It is important if you are using an inside grill to dry off the shrimp after they come out of the marinade or you end up with a poach and not a sear. A seared piece of protein is always better!! Otherwise, the receipe is great.

Had Cilantro, so subbed it for Basil.  Subbed lime juice for the red wine vinegar.  Everything else the same and oh, so delicious!!  Reserved a little marinade to baste the shrimp as it grilled.  A real winner!

Delicious!  I threw a bunch of these shrimp onto a homemade salad and took other reviewer's suggestions by making a shrimp pasta out of the marinade to go with it.  Everything came out fantastic.  Thanks!

I made this for my husband and kids for Valentines Day...and it got rave reviews...he wants it again tonight. The only thing I did different was let it marinade about 1 1/2...and i didn't do it on the grill, but in the broiler.  I left it in longer than the suggested 2-3 minutes...but it was awesome, so I know doing it on the grill will be even better. thanks.

This has become one of my all-time favorite recipes. I make it exactly like it's written with the exception of dry basil instead of fresh. It's absolutely delicious. It's great as an appetizer for a party or served on top of pasta. In the winter, I just broil it in the oven.

Absolutely fabulous!  At first it seemed like an odd combination...but now it's my hands down favorite recipe for grilled shrimp (the bigger the better).  I always use extra virgin olive oil (more robust flavor).  Recently, I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used chili sauce as another reviewer suggested.  Even better!  Love to serve it with a big Mexican style salad (romaine, avocados, tomatos, cucs, red onion, black beans, fresh corn kernals and vinaigrette).  Friends and family roll their eyes into nirvana and all say the same thing...OMG.

Fantastic!! I think this is my favorite shrimp recipe from this site. The combination of ingredients sounds odd, but it really works together perfectly! I didn't have fresh basil, so I substituted dried and added some fresh parsley. I'm excited to try it with fresh basil next time.

Loved it, loved it, loved it! Only change i made is I used double concentrated tomato paste (just a squirt) instead of sauce... and, I let the shrimp marinate most of the day. Everyone in the family loved it. Served it with a big salad, garlic bread, and a couple of rib eye steaks cut up in chunks. A great surf-n-turf meal if there ever was one!

I made this dish for several get-togethers....it was a HIT each time!  I suggest substituting tomato paste in place of the tomato sauce.  The paste allows the marinade to stick to the shimp much better.

Delicious!!!  I added 1/4 cup of sweet chili sauce to the mix and blended the marinade in the food processor.  I think next time I make this, I'll cook the marinade on the stove top, saute the shrimp, and then add the mix and serve over rice.  This definitely doesn't need to just be for grilling!

This is delicious!  I bought a grill pan for the BBQ and cooked them in that and they were so good!  I marinated for 24 hours and the only change I made was adding some red pepper flakes.  Will definitely be making this often!

This was OUT OF THIS WORLD FANTASTIC! We loved it I marinated the shrimp for 8 hrs and poured the leftover marinade over the shrimp while they were cooking. I did not use the 1/4 cup of tomato sauce instead I used 2 plum tomatoes chopped in a handi chopper. I think this marinade would even work great with steak or as a "sauce" served over angel hair or thin spaghetti. I will definately be making this again. Thanks!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe, but after just a few bites, I found the flavor combination a bit odd to my taste. Also, I used small shrimp, which is definitely not what you want for this recipe!

All I can say is "WOW"!  Don't be afraid of the cayenne. It's adds just a little bit of flavor and no heat since it's only in the marinade.

I know a recipe is a keeper when my friends volunteer to buy the shrimp if I will just marinade it with this recipe. Only change I made is double the cayenne just because we love everything to be a little spicy. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and they always come out great. Would recommend using at least large shrimp (31-40 per lb.) to make it easier to get on skewers.

This was fantastic!  I served the shrimp over a salad of mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes, using a little reserved marinade as the salad dressing.  I've tried numerous "BBQ Shrimp" type recipes, but this the best. I definitely will make this again, however, my source for fresh, beautiful, wild shrimp is becoming a polluted mess.

I made this according to the recipe and it was fabulous. My husband and four children ate it happily--my 7 year-old devoured them! Just the right seasonings and the cayenne pepper gave it a little kick without overpowering it. I'll definitely make it again!

Sadly, I took the advice of the "most helpful" review when making the shrimp this time.....I'd made it several times following the original recipe.  BIG mistake.....the "revised" recipe is way too bland for our tastes.  The original recipe produces an incredible-tasting shrimp AS IS.

This was truly delicious. What a taste treat, the flavor was unique yet something anyone would love. My husband and I both love to cook. I followed the recipe as posted except for the tomato sauce and the red wine vinegar. I used what I had on hand, tomato paste and apple cider vinegar in place of those two ingredients. It is the best grilled shrimp we have ever eaten and we have tried quite a few including restaurant varieties. The color was exquisite, a beautiful presentation I would be proud to serve guests. If you are fussy, as we are, this will become one of your favorites. Thank you for sharing with us, you earned 5+ stars in our opinion.

Skeptical with almost 1,000 reviews and a FIVE star rating....but this was FABULOUS!!!  The only change I made was that I used dried basil flakes because I could not find fresh basil anywhere (OMG)...small town!  Anyway....try this - it is incredible!

These were awesome.  I did add fresh parsley and more fresh basil than in the recipe.  I also marinated with frozen shrimp all day.  They defrosted and marinated at the same time.  I also put in a grill basket.  Easier than the skews.

I made these and paired them with a sauvignon blanc.  Simply perfect!  I followed the recipe with only one minor exception.  I used the recipe for 2 lbs of schrimp but actually used only 1 lb.  There was a little marinade left over, but not enough to matter.  This is a keeper and will become a staple in my bag of food tricks.

Wished I took a picture before I devoured the dish! Followed recipe with some additions. Used about 20 frozen, tail-on, shrimp. Sauce additions: 1 cup of Red Pack diced tomatoes seasoned with garlic and basil (in place of tomato sauce), dash of red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce (buy in Asian markets), extra minced garlic and basil to own liking. Marinated in sauce for 30 mins in fridge. Grilled on grill pan on stove top, lightly greased pan with olive oil. Cooked and removed shrimp as directed. Brought marinade to boil, adding 1/4 cup of chopped parsley. Served over pasta w/ organic vodka sauce (Trader Joe's). Smelled and tasted great!

Made this useing frozen shrimp. Made only one change as posted by another reviewer. I used Balsamic rather than red wine vinegar. Marinated in the frig. over night, and cooked under the broiler as I don't have a grill. Came out great, everyone raved about the flavor and couln't seem to get enough. Served with Provincial Tomatoes (from this site), my Cinnamon Carrots, and pasta salad.
Try them, you won't be disapointed.

This recipe turned out really good. I was actually surprised because the mixture of ingredients sounded kinda strange to me. I left out the cayenne because I was afraid my daughter wouldn't eat it.

Delicious tasting. Easy to make. After marinating them for about an hour-and-a-half, I double skewered them  and cooked them over a charcoal hibachi for a firework display that we were going to see. I couldn't get them off the grill quick enough. I had to claim the last two skewers for myself! Thank you BLONDIEPEREZ for sharing.

When I first saw this recipe, the tomato sauce in the ingredients list really threw me, but with all the wonderful reviews I decided to try it anyway, and I'm so glad!  It's fantastic!  Just the right amount of heat from the cayenne, and wonderful flavor.  Served with garlic rice and sauteed green beans.  Thank you!

We love this recipe and have made it several times.    Our family likes it best when I leave out the salt and cayenne and substitute our favorite seafood seasoning, Old Bay, instead.  I use 1 tsp of Old Bay  in place of the the salt and cayenne.  Also, ketchup does do in a pinch, but we like this dish better when made tomato sauce.

HUGE SUCCESS – it’s so nice when a recipe works as easily as this.  I followed the directions exactly, using JUMBO shrimp, which fit 3 to a bamboo skewer (be sure to soak the skewers in water first so they don’t catch fire).  At $20 a pound, I prayed the shrimp would turn out okay… but these are easily the BEST shrimp I’ve ever eaten and I’ve traveled the world! Absolutely, use only FRESH basil.  Toss everything into a large ziplock bag, squeeze out excess air; put in refrigerator.  I think I marinated it for a couple of hours. Really excellent – all of my guests gave this RAVE REVIEWS!  Was served at a birthday dinner with Crustless Spinach Quiche by Susan and Grilled Portobello Mushrooms by Michael (also from this site and 5*****).

I was raised in FL eating shrimp all my life, but I have to say this is the very best shrimp recipe I've ever had. I almost passed it by because the tomato sauce sounded so odd in the marinade.  Don't skip it though - it's great. Using fresh ingredients is key, esp. the shrimp, garlic and basil. I double the marinade and soak all day or overnight for best flavor. Don't throw that amazing sauce away! Baste liberally during grilling to keep shrimp moist and extra flavorful. Serve with fresh garden salad and crisp white wine (recommended: Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc). We make at least once a week. Amazing.

This is waaayy beyone AWESOME! It was just amazing! The shrimp came out perfect. They were moist and flavorful.  I made a couple of changes based on what I had in the house. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. I also had a new product called "Garlic Juice" that I used instead of the fresh garlic. I also used dried basil since I didn't have fresh and used 2 tsps of that. I also doubled the recipe for 2lbs of shrimp because I love marinades and sauces and hate to not have enough. I made it the night before and I refrigerated it overnight. The next morning before I went to work I poured it over the shrimp. It marinated for about 9 hours and was still excellent with only about a quarter cup of marinade left over. For those that don't care for spicy, these were a teeny bit on the spicy side so you might want to cut back on the pepper a bit.  Personally, I love spicy and unless it makes my upper lip break out in a sweat, I don't consider it too hot! Wonderful recipe. I'll make this for the rest of my life! Thank you!

Made this last night exactly as written. I got rave reviews from my son and husband-made exactly a half recipe, serves with salad and fresh corn on the cob. Used wooden spears that I soaked for 1/2 hours. GREAT!

I just made this today  for my husbands birthday. I made 3.5 lbs and thought I made WAY to much... well there wasn't a shrimp in sight after 5 minutes. Everyone (even my really picky husband) LOVED them. I already have request to make them again! ... I followed the recipe exactly and marinaded for about 3 hours.

This is just wonderful!  I made this for a cookout we had.  I marinated for about an hour and grilled on skewers over medium high coals (Weber kettle with lid on).  Everyone raved.  Great smoky flavor with just the right amount of spice.  Thanks for sharing!

No wonder this has five stars with so many reviews - this was DELICIOUS!  I brought to a boil and then simmered the leftover marinade as others suggested and used it as a sauce over the shrimp and spaghetti noodles - WOW!  Next time I'll double the sauce because it was great.

This marinate was really good. This was the first time I've ever grilled shrimp and it was excellent. I marinated the shrimp for a few hours instead of just one hour. Served with rice and broccoli. Great healthy dinner.

Outstanding! I've marinated these for as long as 5 hours (or as short as an hour), and they were wonderful! I accidentally bought COOKED frozen shrimp, but I just thawed them, marinated them, and heated them up in a skillet; they were delicious! These shrimp are extraordinary over pasta with a red wine marinara and parmesan cheese.

This was VERY good.  I ran out of tomato sauce so had to use a mixture of pasta sauce and ketchup.  The fresh basil is definitely a must.  My shrimp was very fresh and I didn't grill them for too long so it had a nice sweet taste to it as well.

I tried this out today, and my family liked it a lot. I  marinated the shrimp overnight, in a ziplock bag. The flavors were great, not too overwhelming. We used the George Foreman grill, since it was raining outside. YUM! The best part is the fresh basil- don't scrimp on the dried stuff, and you will love the taste!

I used this marinade on mahi mahi fillets and then grilled them. It was delicious. I used balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar and doubled the cayenne because we like spice. I also didn't want the added fat of the full 1/3 cup of olive oil, so I reduced it to just a drizzle and added extra tomato sauce. I definately did not miss the fat. This dish will be served again soon.

The marinade smelled wonderful and the shrimp itself would've been out of this world had it not been so salty!  I followed the recipe exactly, made no changes whatsoever and it was REALLY salty!  I'll make this again, but I'll omit the salt.

A very excellent marinade.  I reduced the salt since the tomato sauce had salt in it.  Also used half the amount of dried basil at times and it turned out great.

The shrimp was Great.  They were tender and seasoned just right.  My family was impressed at how they looked-they thought it looked like something a restaurant would serve!  I did as another reviewer suggested and used Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine.  In my opinion, it could use a little more cayene pepper.

I love grilled shrimp, and this recipe is excellent!  It is so simple.  I've served it for guests more than once - they always want the recipe.  I usually make the Grilled Romaine salad as a 'side' - you'll be in for a treat.  Don't try the shrimp on your stove top though, the results are mediocre at best.  Happy grilling!

Had to try this recipe based on the number of people that loved it!  It was fantastic.  Took the shrimp to a New Year's Eve party and they were gone in 15 minutes.  It was a huge party with many people and appetizers galore.  There were several other shrimp dishes that were there already when we got there...and were still there by the end of the evening!  I'm going to try this marinade on chicken as well.

This recipe is a definate winner!  We had it with garlic butter penne pasta and my husband said it tasted like restaurant cooked.  I will surely use this recipe again...although for some odd reason it tasted a bit too salty...so next time i will just use a dash of salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was my first attempt at cooking shrimp, and it turned out fantastic! I reduced the recipe to two servings and then halved the amount of oil called for and increased the cayenne just a pinch, and it still turned out moist with just the right amount of kick. This is such a healthy and tasty dish - we will definitely be making it over and over again. :)

Absolutely AWESOME! Everyone loved the shrimp, my only regret is that I didn't make more. The cayenne pepper adds just the right kick...not too much, it's just right! Thanks for sharing.

I used the George Forman Grill too and it was so easy. The shrimp cooked really fast though. I dont think they even needed three minutes on the GF grill. THis was super easy. It was my first try at cooking shrimp and I would definitely do it again.

This was OUTSTANDING and so quick ans easy. I cooked this in the oven with garlic bread and sopped up the yummy marinade. Just a little cayenne kick. Definitely a keeper!

These shrimp are wonderful!  You've gotta try this marinade.  I cook them on my indoor grill and they don't need the skewers.  They cook in about 3 minutes.  Fabulous, the whole family loves them!

The first time I made this I used the original recipe and marinated for about 2 hours. We enjoyed it very much. The second time I used V* vegetable juice instead of tomato sauce and marinated overnight. It was spectacular. Served it to guests who were equally impressed. Planning to try the marinade on chicken strips soon.

I added some achiote paste for flavor, and also used cilantro instead of basil. The leftover sauce was poured over the shrimp while they were on the grill, which really boosted the flavor. Next time, I'll use more cayenne! Yum!

With a few changes this was excellent!! My family loved it. Used diced tomatoes instead of sauce. More garlic. Definitely FRESH basil! I grilled this on my stove using a stove top grill. Served it with angel hair pasta and the remaining marinade warmed on the side with a tossed salad. Delicious!!

I really like this marinade, it's very simple.  I did use BBQ sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I like to use quite large shrimp when grilling, this is a summer favorite!

This was very easy and delicious! I followed the recipe except added more garlic because I like it. Since it's winter I grilled the shrimp on a grill pan without the skewers and it came out great!!!!

Everyone who tries this loves it. "Restaurant grade" and amazingly good for being so fast and easy. I like to alternate chunks of sweet red pepper and onion to the shrimp on the skewers. This allows me to stretch the shrimp, add nutrition, crunch and color.

My new favorite shrimp marinade! I have made this twice now and got asked for the recipe multiple times. One change- I used chili sauce instead of ketchup because I had it. Loved it so much that I used the chili sauce the second time too!

Did not have tomato sauce the first time I made this so used Heinz Chili Sauce - amazing and have done it that way ever since.  Makes great shrimp tacos - put some crunchy slaw in a tortilla, add shrimp then some avacado and you got a great summer meal!

We didn't have any tomato sauce in the pantry when we started to make it so I took one of the reviewers substitution ideas and replaced it with sweet chili sauce. Wow! It was perfect! Mixing all the ingredients together was an amazing combination. This is definitely a keeper. We'll still try the initial recipe next time but our heart is already on sweet chili vs. tomato sauce. Thank you for sharing

I will admit that I was skeptical about whether this recipe would live up to 5 stars...but I can't give it less.  I mostly stuck to the recipe, though I highly recommend tweaking it as I did- I used significantly more cayenne (I would suggest closer to a tbsp) and instead of the sauce I used fire roasted tomatoes and blended all the ingredients very briefly just to break down the tomatoes.  I spooned every bit of extra sauce on the shrimp while on the grill and you'd be a fool not to do the same.  Don't read this and think it's over-hyped, as this recipe is better than the reviews.  I also regret that I didn't make double the marinade and quickly boil some angel hair that could then be tossed with the extra sauce in a skillet to be topped with the shrimp...you too will regret it if you don't do the same.  I have never reviewed a recipe on here, but I went out of my way to come back to do so because I can't stop thinking about how good it was.  I will be making this again very soon.  FYI- I made this for my wife and a couple of friends and they were super impressed.  While the recipe is very simple to make, the flavor is so exceptional that it will have people thinking you are a professional chef.  I could babble even more...but they limit the number of characters you can use.  In summary, just make this and you will see that you'll go out of your way to review it as well...it's too superb not to.

Great flavor.  I used a can of diced tomatoes in place of the sauce, dried basil and some crushed red pepper for some spice.  I made 2 batches, 1 for marinade and 1 to serve over the whole wheat penne pasta.

I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could!!  The only thing I changed was added a bit more cayenne, since we like it spicy... but this is an AMAZING recipe!!  I'll be trying it on beef, chicken and pork too!

I thought this was one of the best grilled shrimp recipes I've ever had.  I made a few small modifications: used apple cider vinegar and red wine instead of the red wine vinegar (didn't have any), reduced the olive oil to 1/4 cup (and probably could've reduced a little more) added a little extra garlic and cayenne (we like things spicy!) and used dried basil since I didn't have fresh.  I grilled it on the Foreman since my husband wasn't home and he's the "grill man" and they turned out great.  I doubled the marinate and saved half to which I added a can of diced tomatoes and a little pasta sauce to pour over angel hair.  Delicious!

These were so good!  I used dried basil and didn't have enough so used the balance of the 2 tbsps of dried oregano. Also used whatever pasta sauce I had in the fridge instead of the tomato sauce. Everyone loved them.

This was very good.  I only give it 4 stars because I had to make some substitutions.  I didn't have basil, but I had cilantro so I used that.  I also used some leftover pasta sause in lieu of the tomato sauce. I will try it with basil next time. I actually just put in my grill pan for a few minutes and served with pasta - came out great!

Very, very, VERY good!  I used just one pound of shrimp (jumbo size) but kept the measurements the same for the marinade, it was the perfect amount.  So I would suggest making more marinade for two pounds.  I love cooking with shrimp, Tomato Shrimp Scampi usually being my favorite, but this recipe is number one on my list now.  The flavor is exquisately yummy!!!

These were AWESOME!!! Everyone raved about these. a huge hit. I made a double batch of the marinade in my magic bullet. Marinated two bags of collosal shrimp in the fridge for about 3hrs, put four shrimp to a kabob and they were fantastic appetizers for my b-b-q. everyone wanted the recipe afterwards and not a single shrimp was left!!!!

I really wanted to find that 5 star marinade for shrimp but this just wasn't it.  With all the rave reviews I thought for sure this would end my search for the perfect grilled shrimp.  I made exactly as stated except I used dried basil as that is what I had.  I also added 1/2 TB of chili garlic sauce as others suggested.  It turned out a little too spicy for the kiddos.  I made twice the sauce and then extra for basting.  Turns out, there is just no time to baste so that was a waste.  Lesson learned.  Anyway, I might try these again if I end up with fresh basil around the house.

One of the reasons I love Allrecipes.com is for the reciepe IDEAS as well as recipes, so I normally eye ball or tweak.  Did the Diced Tomatoes and hot Chili Paste, Sriravca - the one w the Roster on it... instead of tomato sauce. We LOVED it. Side rice was a good and easy idea. Can see why pasta will go well if you follow the recipe.  I will try that next time but keep my tweaks in my rotation for sure!

Awesome marinade!  We've found it's easier to grill shrimp in a basket, so we did that instead.  Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter and will DEFINITELY make again!  My go-to marinade for shrimp!

Took the advice of a reviewer and used a small can of diced tomatoes (no added salt) and 1/4 c of sweet chili sauce. I also guessed on the basil. Fresh basil is not optional if you want a top quality dish! This would make a great pizza sauce...Excellent!

These are great. If you want a stronger flavor with the shrimp, marinate them for a longer period of time. I think 30 minutes to 1 hour is way too short. I always marinate for 2-3 hours and they turn out delicious every time! They are very versatile. You could serve them with rice or pasta or as an accompaniment to steak or fish. I have tried all the above combinations and love them all! Great recipe!

This was decent but kind of bland. I would add more garlic or something to make it stick to the shrimp better.

These shrimp were good, but I felt they were lacking something.  Everyone really liked them and they were gone in no time, but I think the tomato sauce should be replaced with something that has more flavor to it.  I gave it 5 stars because it was enjoyed by all.

These shrimp are AMAZING!! I'm not a big seafood eater, and we usually grill chicken or beef. We will be eating these more often. Great for entertaining. A good grill is a must. My husband loved them as well and so did our guest.

I was skeptical because I don't like cocktail (tomato) sauce on shrimp. However, of all the shrimp recipes I've tried this is now one of my favorites. I've made it twice, once with some changes (lime juice instead of red wine vin., more garlic, used 1/2 tsp cajun spice instead of cayenne) and both times I used clamato intead of tomato sauce. Made as stated I rate this recipe 4 stars. It is very good. With my changes I gave it 5 - and so did my guests.

The first time that I made these I only made a pound of shrimp because my 5/4/2 year olds weren't loving shrimp at that time.  They devoured it!  Such an easy recipe.  We normally eat ours with a salad for a light supper.

Absolutely delicious!  Instead of tomato sauce, I actually used a whole can of Rotel tomatoes, which I would recommend trying.  Everyone loved them.

Had special guests over for a summer afternoon. Didnt want to do the old Hot Dog and Hamburgers thing. I wanted something easy and different so I tried this recipe. Well, I couldnt get them off the grill or skewers fast enough!! I went thru 4lbs of shrimp in record time!!

 The only thing I changed was adding Ketchup instead of tomato sauce, it added just a little extra spice.

Wow.  This dish was excellent.  We didn't have any canned tomatoes, so we used a combination of ketchup and chili sauce.  We didn't have any fresh basil so we used 2 teaspoons (not tablespoons) of dried basil.  Finally, we heated the grill and placed the shimp in a basket.  Will definitely make these again.  I think next time I will saute them on the stove top with a little olive oil and include a little portion of the marinade in the cooking process so that they are a little saucy.

This was wonderful on a recent camping trip. The cayenne pepper adds just the right flavor without excess heat. Even my boyfriend who is super heat sensitive loved it. 

I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce and fresh basil from my garden. We used frozen shrimp and butterflied them before we put them in the marinade. Definitely keep some aside for basting if you decide to butterfly the shrimp instead of skewering them. 

I can't wait to try this on chicken and fish. At the end of the growing season I'll be mixing up a huge batch of this and freezing it for the winter!

Wow, simple yet delicious.  I think this was better than shrimp I have had dining out!  The marinade doesnt overpower, you still taste the deliciousness of the shrimp which I like.  I also made this on an indoor grill and it was still amazing!

OH MY DELICIOUS !  I didn't have plain tomato sauce so had to use my simplest tomato pasta sauce but don't think it could have changed it all that much - and I only had the pre cooked shrimp so I just heated it up the whole mixture in a sautee pan instead of grilling and OH MY- I literally wanted to drink the extra marinade !  Next time I will make more sauce and serve over pasta.

Made this last night. I ran out of skewers and had a happy surprise when I took he rest of the shrimp, placed on grill with foil and the marinade. My children liked this better then the skewer version!!!! The flavors really popped.

This was the first time my husband and I attempted grilled shrimp, and they turned out fantastic!  The only substitution I made was vegetable juice in place of the tomato sauce, and I marinated the shrimp overnight.  They had a nice garlicky flavor!  Maybe a little too salty, perhaps because of the veggie juice substitution, so I might cut back on that next time.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was amazing!  I subbed Heinz Chili Sauce for the tomato sauce, added a touch more cayenne and about a tsp of dried red pepper.  This had the right amount of heat for us.

This was great!!! I have used this marinade for chicken, steak, & veggies. I did sub the tomatoe sauce with ketchup & instead of cayenne pepper I used crushed red peppers. Be careful though it can get spicy fast like that. Besides that I have found my new favorite!

Everyone loved it, even my picky middle child!  I mistakenly used Sherry Cooking Wine (2 Tbsps) and then tried to fix it by adding 1 Tbsp White Wine Vinegar.  I only had dried McCormick basil leaves, so I used about 1/2 Tbsp. Also used leftover tomato sauce from a pasta dinner. The cayenne wasn't too spicy, although it was probably because I didn't allow it much time to marinate. I just let it sit for 5 minutes and started skewering.  Ran out of skewers, so I pulled out a tin pie pan and cooked the remaining shrimp in a little bit of marinade sauce on top of the grill. Delish!!

This was so good and so easy.  I had to make a few ingredient exchanges since I didn't have on hand what was orginally called for in the recipe.  Used about 1 T. tomato paste from the tube (it is much more concentrated then from canned paste) and used apple cider vinegar.

I was pleasantly surprised with these.  The flavor was really good.  I used 1lbs jumbo raw and the other were small frozen.  I marinated seperately and cooked the jumbo's on the grill with skewers.  The smaller ones were cooked in a skillet with the marinade sauce.  They were delicious and it was great to have the sauce, which went well over rice.

I used the same marinade because the shrimp were already cooked and not raw.  Otherwise, I would NOT have used the same marinade.

My husband raved about this marinade (I, myself, do not eat sea food) It was very easy to prepare. I used dry basil instead of fresh. This and sirloin steaks were a great way to start the BBQ season off!

loved it.  I copied other posters and added a little hot sauce.  I also used pre-cooked shelled shrimp I removed the tails and marinated for a day or two.  They were delicious on some salad.

Wow, this is a great recipe! Love it just the way it is written. I've also used this with fish too and it's equally yummy.

This was very easy to do but it wasn't the best that I have found on this site. Could have been better but overall it was fine for a lazy night. Could've had more seasoning and pow. Probably won't make again.

My husband and I grilled shrimp for the first time last night and we used this recipe.  We both absolutely loved it, which speaks volumes for my husband as he isn't a huge shrimp fan!  In my opinion, this made the shrimp taste like shrimp you'd eat in a restaurant! We will definitely be using this recipe again and recommending it to our friends!

This is so good. I didn't have any basil, but I didn't miss it. The shrimp tastes just like Red Lobster's grilled shrimp. I'm very excited to try this marinade on some grilled chicken. 5+ stars!

Excellent - I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried. It came out great. I cooked it in my George Foreman grill for about 3 minutes. Great flavor and the cayenne pepper was flavorful but not hot to the taste. Awesome recipe and definitely a keeper!!

positively the best grilled shrimp that we have ever had...even after eating at all the places on the San Antonio river walk.  We did the black eyed pea gumbo as a side dish...one complimented the other wonderfully.

I was worried about the amount of cayenne pepper but needlessly as it turned out amazing. I also didn't have fresh basil so had to substitute with dried. I also let this marinade over night and the flavors blended nicely.  I didn't even bother with the skewers, just pan fried in a non stick skillet. YUMMY!!!!!

These shrimp are amazing. I don't grill them since I don't have a grill. I cook them on the stovetop and serve over pasta or spaghetti squash. Since I don't discard the extra marinade, there is enough sauce to coat whatever you choose to serve it over.  I only made one change and that was reduce the amount of olive oil. I made it with  1/3 cup of olive oil the first time and it was too greasy for me. I reduced it to 3 Tablespoons which was perfect for how I serve it. I don't like a lot of oil in my food so this worked very well for me.

Don't change a thing about this! I will say from reading other reviews that it IS easier to put them on skewers just so they will not fall through the grill (we learned this the hard way). Another expected plus is they were yummy and filling!

This was the best shrimp I've every grilled!  I made the recipe as is with the exception that I put the washed shrimp in a large ziplock bag and added the ingredients to the bag and then mixed it in the bag.  Took an idea from one of the photos and used pineapple and sweet peppers on the skewer with the shrimp.  Fantastic!

This shrimp recipe is perfect as written.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I do add a little more cayenne from time to time to change it up a bit.  But otherwise, I think this is as good as any restaurant shrimp.

My whole family loved this including my two year old. This was great and I made no adjustments at all, I used my griddle because it decided to rain before I could grill, the griddle did a great job and allowed the shrimp to cook in some of the marinade.  Loved it!

I'm not a seafood eater. But my boyfriend is, and he raves about how delicious this is. I've also tested it on other seafood-loving friends, all with the same result. Believe it or not, this is actually the first seafood that even I, the I-Won't-Eat-Anything-Fishy diner, enjoy.

This was great.  I tried what another reviewer wrote and used ketchup in place of the tomato sauce.  I used a mix of ketchup and barbeque sauce.  Very easy and delicious.

This recipe makes the most delicious shrimp you'll ever taste.  I usually always "tweak" recipe for our personal taste but this one needs no changes except maybe marinate for a little longer.  Seriously amazing.  Look no further for a grilled shrimp recipe....you've found it.

AMAZING shrimp! I made them for an at-home date night with my husband. Served with angel hair pasta and steamed asparagus. We both agreed that this was a better meal than we've had in nice restaurants. The shrimp had so much flavor. We'll be making this again...this time for the whole family. Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't like shrimp.  I LOVED this shrimp.  Phenomenal recipe.  I used my fresh herbs straight from their pots outside as well as fresh garlic and I could not have asked for better results.  I impressed myself.  This was better than any restaurant shrimp I've ever tasted.  I highly recommend!

This was an excellent marinade and huge hit with my husband.  We eat a lot of seafood (shrimp in particular) and he gets bored with my regular saute of butter, white wine & Garlic.    Only changes I made were using dried basil from the spice rack (didn't have any fresh), and then i cooked them on the stove on a grill pan because it rained the night we were giong to grill them

I personally am not a 'shrimp' eater; however, we just grilled out tonight and it was awesome..so my husband, dad and brothers-in-law said.  Thank you for this great marinade!

HOLY FREAKING MOLEY!  These were absolutely AMAZING! The marinade for these shrimp is unbelievably delicious.  It didn't really seem that exciting when I mixed it up, but somehow it gives this wonderful flavor with a bit of a kick.  We also skewered some fresh veggies and brushed the marinade over them and the shrimp while grilling and they tasted just as good.  This is a perfect recipe, as is, which is a really rare find!  Thanks so much for sharing!

As it was 30 degrees out and my indoor grill is on the fritz, I pan fried the shrimp in a bit of olive oil and then simmered them in the marinade.  I also made a few adjustments:  I had white wine vinegar instead of the red wine, and used diced tomatoes that were already flavored with balsamic vinegar, oregano and basil.  Overall, the result was stunning.   I made it a second time for company and it was a huge hit- this time, using the red wine vinegar.  It didn't make a difference in the taste.  Very easy - fantastic!

Since I didn't want to open a whole can of tomato sauce for just 1/4 cup, I did as others suggested and used ketchup instead.  It would have been fine if I had also remembered to leave out the salt when using ketchup!  It was too salty, but that was my fault.  Next time I plan on trying cocktail sauce instead of ketchup.  The olive oil makes the spices stick to the shrimp.  They look very appetizing.

I followed this recipe with the following exceptions: 1) used one tablespoon of dried basil since I didn't have fresh; 2) used frozen and thawed cooked jumbo shrimp since I didn't have fresh. The flavor was great except next time I will use fresh shrimp as the pre-cooked shrimp get dried out and rubbery on the grill even for 2 min. on each side.

So Good! I made it exactly the way the recipe says. And it was perfect. I took the suggestion of grilling romaine lettuce, and topping with the extra marinade....so good. This has now become our "go-to" shrimp recipe. Thanks

Amazing!  I followed the recipe with no changes.  Fresh basil and garlic are key.  I used a ziplock bag rather than a bowl to marinate.  I also sauted the shrimp rather than grilling them.  I used the remaining juice as salad dressing.

The recipe the way it is written, isn't very good. It's not bad tasting because it barely had any flavor at all. My boyfriend wouldn't even finish his. Definitely add extra cayenne pepper and maybe some red pepper flakes and maybe some of seasonings. Won't be making this again.

Absolutely awesome!  My wife and I have four children ranging from 12 to 3 years in age and they all loved it although the red pepper was just a touch more than we like so I will tune that down a little next time, otherwise it's perfect! Make sure to use very large shrimp.

This is absolutely the best grilled shrimp recipe ever!  It goes way beyond the 5 star rating.  I found this on "allrecipes" many years ago and have been making it ever since.  It's quick, easy and does not require any ingredient modifications... the recipe is perfect as is. My 2 best suggestions - 1. Always use fresh basil - it puts the flavors over the top & 2. Have copies of the recipe on hand to pass out to friends - I'm always asked for the recipe when I serve it at parties!

This has been a family favorite since I found it last year. The one change I made was to use chili sauce in place of the tomato sauce for spicier flavor.

FABULOUS --- WITH 3 LITTLE CHANGES --- Now the #1 recipe in my grilling book.  This recipe is fantastic ... The shrimp is so flavorful I could not believe it . I would suggest 3 little changes which I did when I made this.  1) Double up all of the ingredients in the marinade --- with the same 2 pounds of shrimp, 2) Cover all the shrimp in the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours in the refrigerator before grilling and 3) Serve it over a rice pilaf.

These were good shrimp! I only had 1 lb. of shrimp, but kept the marinade the same and it was perfect. I didn't skewer them, but grilled them up for shrimp burritos instead.

I am the hit of parties & BBQs with this recipe. I use Basil Garlic and Oregano flavored tomatoe sauce, lots of garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for EXTRA flavor. I also marinate over night. DELECIOSO! I don't even like seafood except or these shrimps.

Good Stuff!!!I fixed this as a last minute recipe tonight using a bag of frozen peeled and deveined shrimp.  It was great!!!  The only change I made was to use balsamic vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar.  We grilled and served over herbed pasta!!  Great, easy and quick recipe.  We'll have this one again!!

Very quick and easy recipe. I've made it a few times now and it always comes out perfect. We use large shrimp and leave out the cayenne. In order to save time we also just broil the shrimp instead of grilling on the outdoor grill. Wonderful paired with rice with pineapple juice mixed in and a green veggie. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

Turned out wonderful.  I liked the hint of spicyness from the cayenne, not too overpowering.
Also, I forgot to add the basil and it still turned out great.  Would serve this to dinner guests.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. I didn't expect much flavor from the mild ingredients. I made very few changes - I used white wine vinegar and I added about a half teaspoon of Old Bay. DH really liked these, I think this was his favorite recipe so far. Very nice for such simple ingredients. Oh, I did cut back on the oil. This will go on regular rotation, I will up the cayenne next time. I think it could use a bit more heat. I think a good quality tomato puree would be good in this as well. Thanks for a good, solid recipe.

Without a doubt the best shrimp I've ever eaten.  I substituted Old Bay Seasoning for the salt and it added a little extra flavor.  Awesome!!

This shrimp is amazing.  I had never thought of marinating shrimp before.  Everyone loved them.  I'm a super-light-weight when it comes to spicy food, and this was a tiny bit too much for me.  I'll reduce the pepper a little next time.  But for the average person, it's probably great.

My review will mirror most of the others. This recipe is fantastic. I found that a 2 to 3 minute cook on each side wasn't quite enough so I just cooked mine a little more. That was the only change I made. I tried this recipe over rice (good) and later with a baked potato (EXCELLENT). I will make this dish often - my wife and I love it. I have many grilled shrimp recipes but this one is the best.Many thanks to Rachel for submitting this delicious recipe.

I love this recipe.  The marinade is fantastic--the only change I make is to use ketchup instead of tomatoe paste.  I have used the marinade with great results on chicken, fish and vegetables.

The best!  I loved every delicious bite and my husband just raved about the flavors.  Easy to prepare & so so good.  We were popping them in our mouths right off the grill!!  :)   Will serve to company for sure.  I used ketchup insead of tomato sauce but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The cayenne was exactly the correct amount for semi-wimps like us.  Cut it down a bit if you are a real wimp but don't leave it out as it really is important to the flavor blend.

This is the best grilled shrimp recipe!  I added some summer veggies to the marinaide and grilled them together, simmering a sause of the same ingredients and served over pasta.

Excellent recipe!  I've served this as a main dish and as appetizers depending on the size shrimp I had on hand. Extra large shrimp for dinner and large for appetizers.  I added a little more pepper but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  This is a backyard grill favorite. Thanks

I wish I could rate this 10 stars.  Perfect.  I cannot wait to make this for tailgating.  Totally a keeper.
I did not have any fresh basil and even with dried basil it was still wonderful.

Followed directions except reduced olive oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 bloody mary mix.  Instead of tomatoe suace Iuised Bloody Mary mix what a wonderful flavor.  My wife enjoyed them very much she said it was like the $20.00 platter you pay for in a restaraunt.  This is a keeper

Awesome.  Not spicy at all, in case you have folks who don't like spicy shrimp.  Marinated for a few hours, making it nice and tender.

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  I serve this about once a month over rice and my husband absolutely loves it. Instead of opening an entire can of tomato sauce to only use a tiny bit, I skip the tomato sauce and the cayenne pepper and instead add my own favorite hot sauce. It turns out the same, with less ingredients.

I know I'm not the norm here, but I really thought these just tasted like shrimp with tomatoe sauce.  I followed the recipe to a T, allowed to marinate for 4 hours and then grilled...only about 2/3 of them were eaten amongst my other Christmas feast items.

I've never served this to anyone who didn't love it.  Try using smaller shrimp and serving at room temperature as an hors d'oeuvres. You can cook some of the sauce that remains after marinating and use it for dipping.

Very good.  If you're an apartment/dorm dweller, and you don't have access to a grill, you can use the george foreman grill- I did that the second time I made this, and it worked well.  The red wine vinegar gives it a great flavor.  Next time I'm going to add more cayenne, to give it a little more "kick."

At first I was unsure of this recipe just because tomato sauce and vinegar sounded odd to me, but I am glad I trusted the reviews and went ahead! This is GREAT! It was pouring down rain, so I didn't get to grill them, but just simmered them in the marinade in a hot pan, still delicious! I can only imagine how tasty they'd be on a grill! My family loved them too, including my picky 4 and 6 year old kids!!

Good recipe.  I subbed basil for cilantro, used only 2 cloves of garlic, and served it with brown rice.  My boyfriend loved it and asked me to make it again.  Next time I will add diced tomatos, cut back on the red wine vinegar, and serve it over pasta along with the sauce. Thanks!

Very tasty! I usually make extra marinade and simmer it to serve over orzo. Sometimes I simmer the shrimp in the sauce instead of grilling. Delicious either way!

This recipe came to my attention through the allrecipes RSS feeds.  I made it last night for dinner, using no salt added tomato sauce, only a dash of salt, and 2 teaspoons of dried basil in place of the fresh.  Both of us really enjoyed this recipe and I will consider using the marinade as a barbecue baste for other meats like chicken just to see how it turns out.  I marinated the shrimp for 45 minutes, stirring everything together every 15 minutes to keep things mixed.  I will also consider using cilantro in place of the basil and perhaps less olive oil.  I will make this again.  Outstanding!  Thank you, Rachel!

Fantastic! An absolutely delicious way to grill shrimp.  We served these as appetizers and our guests raved about them.  The combination of spices in the marinade is perfect; not overwhelming...and the shrimp stay succulent and moist; not dried out. I followed the recipe exactly even though I was afraid of the cayenne peper; but just as the original poster said; it is not too spicy.  Great summer recipe....my super picky husband loved it and wants it for dinner at least once a week!!

This marinade was easy and oh so yummy!  I made extra and used it to marinate bell pepper, zucchini, and cremini mushrooms to grill along side the shrimp.  Fantastic!!

If I could give it 10 stars, I would have.  I don't know if it makes a difference with pre-cooked shrimp, or raw, but for a non-shrimp lover, I found myself unzippering these lovely things as fast as I could so my husband wouldn't eat them all by default!
Just less than 5 minutes in a grill pan on high, and cooking in their own lovely sauce, then poured on top once down.
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!
Never had anything this good in a restaurant!

Oh yum!!  These shrimp were wonderful!  I used frozen shrimp and grilled em up on the Foreman.  These were wonderfully easy to prepare...and with only about 3 minutes on the grill..a VERY quick, delicious meal!!  I served them with Garlic Red Potatoes, a salad, some french bread a red wine.  Very great meal!  Looks almost gourmet!  UPDATE: We finally bought a real grill, so I was able to make this the "right" way. I thought I loved this recipe before... man!  SO freakin flavorful.  The marinade smells like heaven - tastes just as good!  The grill lends an extra special element.  My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about what an AWESOME meal it was.  Thanks again.  :-)

I was somewhat disappointed in this recipe, especially after reading all the rave reviews...I must have done something wrong, somewhere.  Anyway, the marinade didn't taste too good, and the shrimp really shriveled in size after grilling them.  The only thing I might do differently in the future is add a little bit of sugar to the marinade.

We grill shrimp often and thought our regular
marinate couldn't be beaten. This was very good
and will be used often at our house. I served with
the Baked Mashed Potatoes and I made points with
my family.

Try using ground chipotle pepper instead of the cayenne.  It gives it a great smokey flavor. I keep copies of this recipe on hand, because I am asked for it whenever I serve it.

This is a great recipe. I make it all the time. I change a few things:

1) I use a lot more fresh basil than the recipe calls for.Cut it up in tiny pieces.
2) Save the marinade. While the shrimp are on the grill, add the entire can of tomato sauce (little can) to the reserved marinade and bring to a boil on stovetop.
3) Cook linguine noodles. After the marinade boils for a few minutes, add it to the cooked and drained pasta. 
4) Stir the grilled shrimp into the pasta. 

FABULOUS!!! Everyone always wants the recipe.

This recipe is fool proof! Full of flavor and easy to prepare.  I used ketchup since I didn't have tomato paste and it turned out wonderful.  I've made this a few times and I always double to marinade.

Wow! We loved the flavor of this recipe. I also followed the advice of others and used ketchup/chile sauce, (half and half), less oil and a tad bit more cayenne. I was surprised the recipe didn't call for lime, so added some lime to the recipe. I would advise not using precooked shrimp.

YUM!! This marinade is incredible. My husband, who is not a huge seafood fan, loved this and asks me to make it all the time. I tried this recipe with garlic flavored red wine vinegar and it gives the shrimp a delicious garlicky flavor. Thanks so much for sharing.

10 stars. This was delicious. I was so skeptical but the shrimp had so much flavor. I grilled the shrimp on the grill pan. I used tomato paste in a tube. Will make this for every special occasion!

SO GOOD!! The ingredients didn't sound like anything special to me, but it was even better than I was expecting! I even used dried basil and garlic powder instead of fresh, and it was still great! My husband, who LOVES shrimp, said this was some of the best shrimp he's ever eaten. Can't wait to make it again!

Based on the reviews I really expected better of this marinade. My wife really enjoyed them but I thought that they simply didn't have the flavor that I was expecting. My taste buds, instead of going "Wow!" were left going "Ho-hum".

Don't get me wrong, this marinade isn't bad but as-written it just doesn't impart the flavor that I was looking for. Next time I will experiment with the herbs and spices to see if I can get the flavor to pop more.

Wasn't the BEST but it was quite good!!  I added Sriracha to the marinade as well as lemon juice.  Next time I will add more garlic and maybe slit the shrimp so it really soaks up the marinade.

The first time I tried this recipe I followed it exactly and the shrimp was very good.  However, my husband and I both like our BBQ shrimp with a bit more heat, so the next time I added sirachi chili sauce and fresh lime juice to the marinade. OMG…SHRIMP NIRVANA!!! Fed 6 people 4 pounds of shrimp and they would have eaten more had I made more!  This is an excellent basic marinade.  You can tweak it however you like to make it yours.

These were fantastic!  I took the suggestion of some of the reviewers and used sweet chili sauce (Frank's sweet chili) instead of the tomato sauce and also used it for dipping.  Very flavorful!  UPDATED: 7/9/17 I tried the recipe using the tomato sauce as the recipe stated and still find that I like subbing the tomato sauce with sweet thai chili sauce.  If you can find Pink Argentina Shrimp give it a try in this recipe.  They are sweet and have a texture similar to lobster.

I replaced the tomato sauce with ketchup, because I didn't have any tomato sauce in the pantry and used dried basil instead of fresh.  Left everything else as is.  We all enjoyed it.  Next time I will try the tomato sauce and see which way I liked better.  But if you don't have tomato sauce, ketchup is a good sub in a pinch.

I give this 4 stars only because I made the changes according to aussiemum1 but LOVED this dish.  I followed her ingredients but not exactly.  I only used 1 lb. of shrimp but made the recommended amount of marinade for 2 lbs. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a whole can of diced tomatoes, 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp of dried basil (no fresh on  hand), 1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, 1 Tbsp of red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup oil and pulsed all in a mini-processor.  I reserved about 3/4 cup of the marinade and heated that on the stove for dipping.  My husband and all three of my 3.5 year-olds loved it.  The kids ate more than me and my husband.  Next time, I'll make the 2 lbs and double the marinade as they loved the sauce for dipping.

These were really good.  I do add a 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3.  I don't put the shrimp on skewers.  We just grill them on top of a grill grate or over foil. Thank you for the recipe.

The hardest part of this recipe was peeling the shrimp! AND it tasted great. Served with some rice and grilled summer vegatables. My husband was a happy man with this meal!

Very tasty and a big hit with all the family!!  I spread the marinated shrimp on a pan covered in foil and broiled 5 minutes each side, without skewers.  Definite repeat!
The second time I doubled the amount of marinade so shrimp were fully immersed :)  Kids loved it even more!!!

This is one of the best recipes I have tried from here, it was simple to put together, marinated the shrimp for over an hour.  Followed directions to the tee and the shrimp came our perfectly.  Everyone in the family enjoyed them, will definitely make this recipe again.  Next time will add more cayenne but seriously the grilled shrimp were just delicious!  I used large, meaty shrimp.  The shrimp is good hot or cold and does not really need a cocktail sauce as the shrimp is well seasoned.  Great recipe!

Supremely Good! My wife isn't a fan of grilled shrimp and after she finished eating hers, ate half of mine as well!

I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, so like others, I used ketchup instead.  Because ketchup has vinegar and salt in addition to tomatoes, I didn't use anymore salt and reduced the vinegar by a bit.  You could easily triple or quadruple the cayenne pepper if you like a bit of kick.

Best new recipe I've tried in a long time - thanks!

I have made this recipe for bbq with numerous people.  It is very easy especially since my store puts the shrimp on the sticks ahead of time for me.  I make the marinade and multiply it by5.  I put all shrimp skewers in a disposable aluminum tin, poor the marinade over and use as needed.  They cook extremely fast, easy to eat right off the sticks and all the kids will eat them too!  It is a huge hit in my house for dinner or large parties.  I highly recommend.  Fresh and light, common ingredients that you would have in the house (I have used dry basil before when I didn't have fresh) and it's always delicious.

This was SO good!! I was happy to see that the ingredients were simple and ones I had in my house.  I used dried basil and it worked just fine! I can't wait to make this again.  I've already shared it with a couple other people today.  Definitely worth trying.

I can't believe such simple ingredients can make such delicious shrimp! Always a big hit. I love to serve it as a starter at our BBQ's. Interesting thing happens: no matter how much I increase the amount of shrimp it is still gone in the same amount of time. It's magic!

Easy and delicious! I used dried basil because I did not have fresh and just a few shakes of cayenne, then just threw them in a grill basket.

Tastes great! Only difference is that I used 1 pound of shrimp instead of 2 pounds...but still used the same amount of marinade.

Delicious! My guests loved it, too - I even heard a couple of "mmm's" after tasting it which is always nice  for the host to hear : )   Some changes: Added another 1 - 2 cloves of minced garlic, used ketchup in place of the tomato sauce and substituted freshly ground black pepper for the cayenne.  I loved how the marinade was thick and so it clung to the shrimp nicely in preparation for the grill.  I would definitely make this again!

This marinade is awesome!  The first time I made it just like written and used grilling shrimp - split and deveined with the shell on - then cooked in a grilling basket instead of skewered.  That makes it almost too easy!  Planning to make them again tonight with the shrimp peeled and deveined and definitely in the grilling basket again.  Will use a little less oil this time and a little more cayenne pepper.  Thanks for a great recipe!

VERY good and simple!  Followed recipie exactly except I used dried basil.  (would have used fresh if I had it).  I used 1/2 of an 8oz can of tomato sauce for this recipe.  I took  the other 1/2 and added some garlic salt, dried basil & ground pepper and poured over sliced zucchini & onions tossed w/ olive oil-- threw that mixture into tented foil and grilled w/ the shrimp.  Served all over rice.  Delish w/ no complaints from the picky children.

Easy, fast and so so tasty!  This is one of those recipes that you don't have to write down and when you are at the grocery store and can't think of what to cook that night - you can pull up the few ingredients from your memory bank and have an easy winner!  Delicious!!!

Great recipe!  I used a can of diced tomatoes (as others suggested) blended with the other ingredients.  These turned out amazing!  My BF was so impressed that we just made them for a second time in a week.

These shrimp are the bomb!!! I used the Franks Red Hot chili sauce as recommended by another user - it is a key ingredient.  I also changed the tomato sauce to diced tomatoes and fresh basil to fresh cilantro for a bit of a kick and food processed it all. Let it marinate in a freezer bag for a couple hours. I have made them multiple times and will make again!!

This is truly fantastic! I followed the recipe as written and it was the best grilled shrimp I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It is so easy. Just make sure you soak the skewers if they are wood/bamboo for at least 30 minutes. We will make this over and over and over and over :)

I wish I could give this a 4 1/2. I really do! It was delicious. The only thing I added was a squeeze of lime near the end of grilling to give it that extra OOMPH! Aside from that, it was perfect.

Really enjoyed this!  I looked at a few different recipes for grilled shrimp but I chose this one because of one of the other reviewers.  I always trust anything Naples 34102 rates a 5 star.  She recommended following the recipe exactly and that's what I did.  It worked wonderfully and made a BIG splash at the next door neighbors cookout.  Because we are right next door I was able to wait until the very last minute to put the shrimp on the grill and have them ready when all the other guests were ready to begin eating.  And such Ooohs and Ahhhs they caused!  Such a simple and wonderful recipe!  And in the unlikely event that there may be leftovers-well, these shrimp are even good served at room temp.  Don't know about serving them cold, they didn't last long enough!

I used less oil and chilli sauce and it was good.  Maybe use slightly less red pepper.  Don't put potatoes on skewers they require more cooking than the shrimp.

Excellent!  My grill ran out of propane so the shrimp marinated overnight.  I served them over a garden salad.  Delicious!

I was disappointed in this recipe for all the high ratings it received.  I followed the directions exactly but the marinade lacked flavor.  I think tomato sauce is a strange ingredient in a marinade for grilled shrimp.  The receipe calls for medium heat and 2-3 minutes per side or until opaque.  I used a gas grill maintained about 400 but it was not hot enough and cook time was more like 10 minutes total until they were opaque.  Taste was lacking for my husband and me and they still didn't looked cooked.  I would not make this again and was glad I had not made it for company. Meself in Lakeland

I made this with kethup, and dried italian seasoning, and one guest actually chose 2 skewers of that and none of the grilled chicken! Huge hit!!!
Hint, use the largest shrimp you can afford, much jucier.

3.5 Not bad but I probably wouldn't make again. I scaled but upped the garlic and marinated for about 5 hours. Served over a grill and chill salad (very lightly grilled veggies that were then chilled before tossing with lettuce and dressing) for a light meal on a hot day.

nice recipe! only changes i made were to add some black pepper and used pizza sauce instead of tomato sauce, because the jar was smaller and i didnt want to waste opening a whole jar of tomato sauce when i only needed 1/4 cup. i also added pineapple to the skewers and it paired very nice with the shrimp. thanks for sharing, will be making again!

Amazing recipe! I did substitute the tomato sauce for Sriracha hot chili sauce. Everything else was left the same. Yum! Served with grilled corn on the cob and fresh garden salad. Ahhh, I LOVE summer!

Excellent. I used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce and red chili powder instead of cayenne (just what I had on hand). I also used 3 HUGE cloves of garlic as suggested by someone else. I defrosted the shrimp the day before and marinated them overnight. We also,brushed the marinade on them while grilling. My 11yo couldn't get enough of them.

This is a new family favorite. Made it last night and everyone raved about these shrimp. My daughter's friend who joined us for dinner asked if I would "PLEASE give the recipe to my mother"! The only changes I made was substituting 2 tablespoons of Trader Joe's Sweet Chili Sauce for the cayenne as I was concerned about it being too spicy for the kids, and I marinated it for about 2 hours, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe as it was written, and the flavor was outstanding!  I used Trader Joes Wild Blue Colossal Shrimp, fresh picked basil from our yard, and it is a dish I cannot wait to make for guests. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!

A beautiful blend of flavor which made it even yummier on the grill! I used dried basil and had to improvise by using foil, since I didn't have time to go back out and get skewers! Delish!

Great! My wife and I are usually not big shrimp fans. We came across this recipe because we were looking for something to grill that had basil in it. These shrimp were excellent. I would recommend buying shrimp that are already deveined though, I spent about 45 minutes cleaning shrimp today.

This is absolutely amazing. I am by no means a great cook, but this was easy, and delicious. I kinda feel like a little chef! I am not one for spicy foods, but this was spicy enough to leave a tingle on the lips but it didn't leave my tongue throbbing. If I could make this every day, I probably would!! Amazing!!

Awesome and quick!  I always triple the ingredients and add alot more garlic.  I often do not have fresh ginger when I prepare this, but it tastes just fine without.
I have used this with chicken too.
Tip for using with chicken, cook the chicken first or the sauce has a tendancy to stick to the pan.
If you need to leave on the stove longer than anticipated you can easily add more water to the pan.

Excellent! Definitely need to soak your skewers first, though.

Excellent marinade. First time grilling shrimp and we loved it. So good, I even thought of using this marinade on steak.

Awesome recipe! It's kinda tough to get the shrimp from the grill to the table while it is still hot, but the flavor is amazing. Brushing on the leftover marinade while on the grill makes the dish.

This came out great!  I took the advice of a few others and used ketchup rather than tomato sauce.  I only had pre-cooked frozen shrimp so I used that.  It still came out amazing!  Best shrimp I've ever had.

After many years of using Allrecipes.com, this is my first review ever! I am a terrible cook but this recipe turned out perfect. My husband and I made only 1# of shrimp (versus 2), put it on some angel hair pasta and mixed in the sauce (our shrimp was precooked, so no worries about mixing in sauce from uncooked food). We figured it cost us about $9 to make the whole thing but would have cost about $35 for 2 people in a good restaurant in Atlanta. Sooooo easy and soooo yummy! Thanks for this great recipe!

Very good.  My husband and all 4 kids loved these shrimp.  I doubled the ceyenne pepper, and I personally wished I put more, because it wasn't spicy enough for me, but the flavor was great.  We enjoyed these over Quinoa that we mixed the remaining of the sauce with and grilled asparagus.  Excellent!

This was another that we made while camping.  We sauteed it on a big wok.  I put everything in a ziploc and then in the ice chest, so it marinated a little longer than it should have and then we probably cooked a little too hot for a little too long, so it was tough but the flavor was great!  I did use dried Italian seasoning instead of fresh basil since we weren't cooking it right away.

Yet another five stars for this great recipe. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, since it calls for such a small amount.  However, I wish I had made it with tomato sauce and doubled the marinade, to use half as a sauce over the pasta I served the shrimp with.  My hubby said it was the best shrimp he'd ever tasted.  Will be making again!

I have never made shrimp like this and thought it absolutely incredible!  The flavors go well together and I let my shrimp marinate for abou 45 minutes.. My son said this is his favorite way to eat shrimp now. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for something a little different!

Excellent!!  I was pressed for time, so I just mixed the ingredients and cooked the shrimp in a pan on the stove.  The taste was mild and good!  If I do that style again, I will substitute the tomato sauce for tomato paste, just to make the sauce a bit thicker to stick to the shrimp.  Will definitely make again!

Very good flavor. Served as a topping to grilled steak. Next time I will save the marinade and turn it into a sauce. It looked and tasted so wonderful, I hated to throw it out.

I made these along with Beef and Veggie Kabobs, for a surf and turf on a stick dinner, when company came to visit us.    My Sis-in-law stated she didn't like spicy food ( bummer ) so, I tryed this recipe in order to not offend her delicate tastebuds!  Overall a very good marinade for the faint of heart, and the fresh basil really was a nice floral note to the shrimp.  I will make this again when I have folks over that don't like the heat.

This was really good.  You have to eat it immediately after they come off the grill.    Next time I think I'll marinate and cook on the stove and serve over rice.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent and SO easy! I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 c. Chili Sauce-- DELICIOUS!  I highly recommend doing so!  I also subbed diced tomatoes for the tomato sauce, reduced the vinegar and oil and increased the basil and garlic.  What's more- I through everything in the skillet at the same time and served it over Quinoa that I made with some white wine, garlic and lemon.  Super good.  Oh, but if you do it this way and do NOT like spicy food (we do!) then I recommend reducing or eliminating the cayenne.  Enjoy!

This is sooo savory!  Even my vegetarian husband sneaked a couple and agreed.  I've made this several times and have marinated as long as 6 hours and as short as 30 minutes and found no difference in flavor.  I put cold leftovers on a salad the next day.

SO YUMMY!  I make this exactly as written, except for doubling the marinade (except olive oil) and adding 2 Tablespoons of Sweet Chili Sauce.    I marinade the shrimp for 90 minutes, grill on the Foreman Grill, boil the remaining sauce, and serve over white rice and broccoli with the extra sauce poured over the top, and cornbread on the side.  If you're a shrimp lover you will love this.  Thanks for adding!

Fab!  The only variation was that I bought precooked and frozen shrimp, and I also marinated for 3 or 4 hours before placing on the grill.  I just put everything, minus the shrimp, in a mini food processor and blended.  Put the shrimp in a ziplock bag and added marinade, put in the fridge.  Super good, had tons of leftovers that will be great in salad or in a tortilla with fresh veggies!

Easy and delicious. Not at all spicy. I sometimes saute in a small pan and that works just as well.

These were quite tasty, very Italian influenced. We grilled ours up outside and loved the flavor the grill imparted.

I was expecting much more flavor. I used medium shrimp but if I try this again I will use large, and will increase the cayenne and dust the skewered shrimp with garlic powder. Fresh basil is always a good idea. Good basic recipe that can be punched up as you like it.

I followed the recipe just like it said and it was great!! Instead of letting the shrimp marinate for a hour it was more like three hours because I had to leave for bible study...but it turned out great!!! My husband loved them and my 2 year old even came in the kitchen after eating one bit and said these are good mom!!!My heart melted...I'm DEFINITELY trying this recipe again nothing needed to be changed!!!Superb

This wasn't bad but I was hoping for more flavor. The absolute only change I made was to use Heinz Chili Sauce instead of tomato sauce but it still lacked it flavor. It was good, I just couldn't taste anything extra. Maybe next time I'll double the basil, cayenne and garlic.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I actually use ketchup most of the time as I hate to waste a big can of sauce for such a little bit.  It still tastes fantastic though.  Thanks for sharing!

was pleasantly surprised.  My kids and hubby are very picky eaters.  I thought I would be eating this one by myself, but they loved them.  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used half red cooking wine and half white vinegar, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T.

OMG THIS WAS PHENOMINAL.  I couldn't believe just how tasty this shrimp was.  I was a little concerned when my husband commented about how much it smelled like vinegar, but according to the taste test it was amazing!!!  I didnt have cayenne pepper, so i used 2 TBS of hot pepper sauce.  I think I may add a little bit more next time.  I like things spicy.  Great recipe!

I made this last night for my family, and they all loved it. The shrimp wasn't the best quality, but the marinade really saved them. My mom said it was the best shrimp she's ever had.

Thank you thank you thank you!!! This was an amazing marinade/sauce for raw shrimp. Instead of the tomato sauce I used 1 whole raw tomato and blended everything in my mini food processor. It was cold outside, so we just sauted everything in a pan and served it over basmati rice. Very yummy and my husband loved it as it was good for his diet.

So easy and so good!  Had to use dried basil.  Still good.  Cut it back to 1/3 of what was required.  Make sure you use raw shrimp.  The marinade is absorbed better.

This is a FANTISTIC Recipe... I  followed the recipe with only a couple of twiks.  I used the marinade amounts for EACH LB. OF SHRIMP.  I then marinated it overnight.  The shrimp smelled so good my family wanted me to cook up a few so they could try them before the barbecue.... P.S. Dont try and take a shortcut and use precooked shrimp.  Fresh shrimp as stated in the recipe is the way to go......

This is an amazing recipe.  I made it for some good friends who are foodies and they loved it.   Additionally, I gave the recipe to my college-bound and kitchen-newbie son and it worked great for him too.  I followed the recipe exactly the first few times and the shrimp were just delicious.  But you could easily experiment with a bit more pepper, spices, herbs, etc.

Made this for an appetizer for Father's Day.  Any recipe that has for a thousand reviews and barely any negative is worth a try.  We have grilled shrimp in the past on skewers, but none have been so tasty, moist and delicious as this recipe.  We couldn't stop eating them.  This recipe is already typed and in my cookbook....a definite keeper.  Thank you for sharing blondiperez.

Very good.  I upped the garlic by 3 cloves and my 1/4 t cayenne pepper was heaping but next time I think I'll up it to 1/2 t - I would have liked a little more kick.  Overall it is a great marinade and I'll definitely use it again.  Update:  the leftovers were even better the next day - I warmed them up and put them on a salad and the flavor was wonderful.

My husband and I loved this shrimp! I didn't read the directions carefully and didin't realize we had to grill it on a grill, so we just did it in a frying pan. I doubled the ingredients because the shrimp I used was the extra large kind, and it was just enough. We marinated it for 2 hours because I think all food is better when marinated longer. We used the extra sauce and cooked it for a little bit and poured the whole thing over spaghetti and it was very tasty. Thank you!

I have to believe this is definitely worthy of 5 stars, BUT, not the way I made it.  Based on another reviewer who subbed chili sauce for the tomato sauce, I did the same.  Well, this had excellent flavor, but by using the chili sauce, it came out too sweet.  I won't do that again.  I really liked the fact that this marinade is thicker than most and had nice "cling" to it.  These grilled up beautifully - had very nice color.  I'll be making this one again, but I'll use the tomato sauce next time!!  UPDATE: 9/4/10 - I made this again and used tomato sauce as directed by the recipe.  Wow, much better!!

This was not the recipe I thought I was going to make, but rather a spur-of-the-moment substitute because I really did want to grill my shrimp.  I couldn't have made a better choice!  YUM!  My only variation from the recipe was to use catsup rather than tomato sauce.  It was totally delicious and was done on the grill in about five minutes.  Very delicious!  Our guests loved it!

Very bland. I made the marinade as written but I only had 1 lb shrimp. I even let set in fridge for 1 hour before grilling. Disappointed.

This was great my family loved it and we have had it a dozen times since. Fresh gulf shrimp makes it taste even better.

These are pretty good.  My husband viewed "tomato sauce" as spaghetti sauce and these still turned out good.

Made this for dinner one night.  Although my 3 year old wouldn't eat it, my husband who doesn't like shrimp much, devoured it and requested that I add it to our regular recipe book.  Definitely best right off the grill while hot.  Would make again as appetizer.

This was GREAT!  I made three batches of the marinade and marinated shrimp, chicken, and some veggies.  I served it all with pasta and french bread.  My kids, hubby and in-laws all loved it!  There was not a bite left over.

Fantastic.  Doubled the marinade, added a little more cayenne, and the dish was a grand success.  Already got a request to make again; good thing Costco's shrimp isn't too $$$$.  Great recipe.

So simple, absolutely awesome.  Hands down, the BEST grilled shrimp I've ever had.  The 40+ people that I served it to at a BBQ also agreed.  No reason to make another shrimp recipe again.  Thank you blondieperez for sharing this with all of us.

Adding a little citrus, such as lemon or orange juice, along with twice the amount of Cayenne and red pepper flakes will kick this recipe up to where it should be.  Otherwise, while decent, it tastes like spicy ketchup.    Chardonnay?  Uh, no.  Try an ice-cold Rose or a chilled Zinfandel.  Seafood does not always = white wine!  Peace

WOW!! This was a great recipe. Everyone loved and wanted more. I did one subsitution..I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce because that was the only thing I had on hand. It still came out wonderful! If you love shrimp then you'll love this. I was afriad of the re pepper but after tasting it, you really couldn't tell it was on the shrimp.

This is a great recipe. I added a little more tomato sauce and garlic. My husband boiled the marinade and used some as a dip for the shrimp. I also used the marinade on a chicken breast which turned out fantastic.

This is AMAZING!!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!  I made alfredo sauce with linguine as a side and it was a perfect addition.  I did everything as listed in the recipe except used my own home made sauce since I has some in the fridge.

AWESOME!!  This was some of the best marinated grilled shrimp we've ever had.  We have never grilled shrimp at home before but get grilled shrimp out alot.  This is better than any I've ever had at a restaurant.  My mom does not even like shrimp and ate several, so that says alot.  I followed the directions exactly and marinated 4 hours.

Incredible!! When I made this, I just wanted simple grilled shrimp and didn't think I would like the tomato sauce marinade... but given all the reviews, I had to try it. And I'm so glad I did!! I can't believe how amazing this recipe is! I'm glad I made extra! I marinated the shrimp for about 45 minutes and eye balled most of the ingredients and it turned out fantastic! I did use quite a bit more fresh garlic and did not brush the marinade on the shrimp while grilling. Thank you for the great recipe! I will make over and over again!

We had never cooked shrimp before. We were nervous. We tried half the shrimp this way and half with just butter and garlic powder.  Guess which one won?  Hands down, easy and tastes great.  Thanks for the recipe.

So good! Per other reviewers, I used less olive oil (2 tablespoons), a ton more garlic, and more cayenne pepper. Super tasty. Served this with grilled pineapple. This is a keeper!!

Just noticed that I have had this in my recipe box since 2007 but have never tried making it until a week ago.  Wonderful flavor!! My husband and I love the recipe just the way it is.  Thank you so much.

These were really good. However, I do recommend grilling them longer than the recipe states for more of a crunch.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made one change because I couldn't find basil in my local Harris Teeter supermarket (?) so I added cilantro instead. I don't think it made a difference, because the great thing about this recipe is that you taste the shrimp flavored by the marinade rather than the marinade itself. I served it with fried rice and Turning Leaf Pinot Grigio. It was quick, easy and delicious.

This recipe didn't lie, you don't need cocktail sauce with it.  It was the highlight of the meal and it was only meant as a side dish.  It could have used a little more cayenne pepper, but I like my dishes a little spicier.  Great recipe!

I made a delicious stir fry dish out of this shrimp and marinade! I doubled the marinade and then poured half of it over the shrimp in a glass dish to marinate. I cooked the shrimp in a skillet with sugar snap peas and sliced mushrooms in chili oil which gave it an extra kick. During the last minute of cooking, I poured in the rest of the marinade. When everything was heated, I mixed in some cooked brown rice. It was just the right amount of sauce. Yum.

Awesome!  We didn't use skewers but cooked them in a grilling basket lined with foil.  My husband had said prior to cooking them couldn't I cook it another way...I don't like grilled shrimp.  But he changed his tune after eating these!

Very easy and delicious. I used ketchup instead of sauce and found it needed less salt. Next time I might omit the salt entirely.  I also doubled the garlic for my family's taste.

These is the best shrimp recipe I have used. I did not have tomato sauce so used some of my homemade marinara I had on hand, and added a dash of lemom juice - other than that I followed the recipe and the was AWESOME!!! My huband could not get enought, I skewered and cooked on the grill with our porterhouse... Great combo! I will be making this over and over again... You have to try this recipe!!

This was excellent and easy.  the only changes I made were to use balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and 1 Tbsp dried basil instead of the fresh.  Next time I might up the garlic since I love it!

WOW!  My whole family loved it!  I was out of a few ingredients so I improvised with ketchup, garlic powder and tabasco sauce... then the rest as called for.  Still fantastic.  Next time will use ingredients as called for to see if it's any different!  We had this with the tri tip roast using the tri tip rub!  The best combo of surf & turf!

This shrimp is so very good tasting! I let the shrimp marinate for about 3 hours before grilling. Also I used ground dried basil instead of fresh basil. It has just enough spice for me. You may want to add a little more cayenne if you like a lot of "hot" Husband loved these shrimp! He is a hard sell on most foods. It has to really impress him before he will say a word. He said"these shrimp are really good! :) You won't be diappointed.

My husband couldn't stop raving about(or eating!)these shrimp!  The kids even gobbled them up.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce and marinated them for about 8 hours.  I was out of fresh garlic and basil so I used garlic powder and dried basil, and they still were full of flavor.  Next time, I will use the fresh garlic and basil, but if you're in a pinch, the dried varieties work with great results.  I have a feeling hubby is going to be requesting this recipe a lot!  He labeled it "the best shrimp I have ever eaten."  Thanks for a great-tasting recipe, with a great "WOW" factor, that is also quick and easy to prepare.
UPDATE:  I made 6 lb. of these this weekend and took them to two different picnics.  They were the hit of the party with both crowds.  I swear I've NEVER received so many requests for a recipe before.  That makes this a 10 star recipe for sure!
Tip:  You can easily cut down on the oil a bit.  I didn't this time but did the time before.  Doesn't hurt the final results at all, just makes them a little healthier I suppose. I also think the marinade sticks to them a little better when you use less oil.

I multiplied the marinade for some zucchini and tofu.  I planned on grilling all of it, but thunderstorms changed that plan!  Put in separate cassaroles and baked all of it then broiled for a minute to brown the tofu and zucchini.  It was delicious and I can't wait to try it again outside.  My husband loved his tofu too!

My dinner tasted exactly like a dish that I eat (every time) when I visit my favorite Italian restaurant! My guests couldn't get enough of it and I found myself craving it the rest of the evening! I'll definitely make it again since I'll probably dream about it every night until I have it again. -It's THAT good!

Very good, thanks! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 chili garlic sauce; I didn't have basil so I used about 1/8 a teaspoon of Italian seasoning; and I used red pepper instead of cayenne pepper. Came out great!

This recipe is awesome and is so easy! I just threw all of the ingredients in a large Ziplock bag let it sit for about an hour and it was amazing!

This was good.  The marinade smelled great.  I used garlic powder because that is what I had on hand.  I don't know if my rating isn't higher because my shrimp was the bagged frozen kind or because I skimped on the cayenne because of my kids.

These were definitely a hit.  Used ketchup in lieu of tomato paste as others suggested.  A sprinkle of black pepper while on the grill was good !!

We absolutely love this recipe!!  However, we've stopped grilling it.  Instead we marinate cooked shrimp in the marinade (we substitute garlic-flavored tomato sauce).  Once the marination is complete, we put the entire batch into an oven-proof dish and add a stick of margarine, and bake for about 10-15 minutes.


oooh, yum yum!!  An easy shrimp-scampi like dish.  Easier than grilling and doesn't dry out at all./

I made this exactly as written, and unfortunately, it just didn't do it for me. I normally love shrimp marinated in a tomato based sauce but this recipe just didn't work for me.

I used this recipe and cooked my shrimp in a rotisserie that I got for Christmas.  Excellent. I've already made more and doubled the batch. Will inject a chicken with it and cook it the same way.

This is by far one of the best recipes I have ever made from AllRecipes. The flavoring was phenomenal. We eat these over a bed of angel hair pasta with some additional pasta sauce. I also add more cayenne pepper to give it more of a kick. You cannot go wrong with these! A+++++

Excellent recipe! Very flavorful and aromatic. I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 of the marinade on 2lbs. of large shrimp and the other half on boneless skinless chicken breast. (Hubby doesn't care for shrimp.) I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce and canola oil instead of olive oil (I was out of those two ingredients). The chicken turned out very tender and moist. My husband was nodding his head "yes" when he was eating the chicken, which means he likes what he's eating. Will definately make again.

Like other reviewers I was skeptical.  I loved it so much that I made it twice in one week!!!  I used 3/4 t. dried basil instead of fresh.  The second time I made it I also added sea scallops.  Definitely a KEEPER!!!

WOW!  This shrimp is incredibly delicious!  The only changes I made were to cut the olive oil back to about 1/4 cup and the cayenne to about 1/8 tsp, although next time I'll probably inch it back up a tiny bit.  I grilled on a grill pan instead of on skewers.  Served with fresh green beans and angel hair pasta that was tossed with a quick sauce made with olive oil, lots of garlic, the rest of the can of tomato sauce, basil, and a couple of fresh tomatoes, diced.  The whole family loved this, and I will definitely be making it again.

I have made this so many times and everyone gobbles it up.  I tend to add more garlic because we love garlic.  

Grilling Tip: If you are using wooden skewers - so them in water for at least 1 hour before you put the shrimp on them so they will not burn.

This recipe tasted a little bland (cooked on the grill as noted),and i mixed all ingredients as instructed.I wanted to give it another try so i added everything for a second time and put in  a ziplock bag in the freezer(marinated for 2 days).This time i cooked them on the stove top on med-high and they came out great! 

Overall i think this should be cooked on the stove top for better results

Wow!  So easy and delicious!  I made it yesterday for Father's Day.  My husband, father and brother in-law loved it.  They said it was a good thing the shells were still on as they would have eaten them too fast!  I didn't have any fresh basil yet in the garden so I used dry, which seemed fine.  Thought it was a little heavy on the salt so I may use less next time, because there will definitely be a next time!

Used only 1 lb of shrimp, but kept all of the other ingredients in the marinade the same, with the exception of the cayenne pepper, which I doubled.  This shrimp was outstanding, with great flavor and a nice kick to it.  Made it with grilled onions, from this site, and a grilled veggie medley.

I don't cook from recipes very often, but boy, I am glad I cooked this one! The marinade was spicy and yummy and instead of grilling the shrimp, I let it simmer in a pan (with marinade) for about 5-6 minutes, then drizzled the marinade over some crusty bread and topped it with shrimp.  Yum, Yum, Yum!

I just made this and it was absolutely fantastic.  The only thing I did differently was to use 2t dried basil instead of 2T fresh.  I did let it marinade for the full hour.  Don't put the skewers on the grill and walk away.  Shrimp cooks so quickly.  I grabbed the middle shrimp with tongs and flipped them back and forth until opaque.  Nothing worse than overcooked shrimp...

This was a winner in our house!  I used ketchup instead of the tomato sauce.  Very easy to prepare.  Very easy to get addicted to.    Served with broccoli   with garlic & cashews from this site.  Can't get enough of that either!  Do try, you won't be disappointed.

10 plus stars I made this to recipe form, with one exception, did not have any tomato sauce, used ketchup, worked out fine will make this many more times, and will use ketchup, only other thing I did was to add some red wine, the fresh basil in this dish is a must ( I grow my own) and let me say it's much cheaper than buying it and it's easy to grow. Outdoor grill these ONLY!!!!. I think cooking any other way would take away from the flavor. 10 plus stars. Thanks Rachel girl!!!!.

Excellent!  I cheated and used cooked shrimp.  Marinated it for 2 hours in the fridge.  Broiled in a pan in the oven for 15 minutes.  Great taste all the way through.

This was very good.  My husband and kids liked the recipe.  I dipped my shrimp in lemon butter.  I served this dish with broccoli fettuchine alfredo.  I will make this again.

This recipe was very easy, and the shrimp were delicious.  I made these for a few friends, and everyone loved them.  My husband doesn't like shrimp, and he ate two skewers full.

This was very good.  The only change I made was to use 1 TBSP dried basil, instead of fresh, because my store was out of fresh basil.  It still turned out great.  I saved time by grilling them in a grilling basket instead of skewering them (quick and easy that way!)

Very good and very easy, a little too greasy with 1/3 of olive oil.  I cut it down to 2TBS on the next bach and it was just right.

Excellent!  We followed this simple recipe with two substitutions, parsley for the basil and balsamic for the red wine vinegar.  Everyone at the table declared it to be the best shrimp ever.  The triple combination of fresh shrimp from Mexico, flavorful marinade, and grilling worked beautifully together.

This is the most requested recipe that I make. The shrimp are fabulous in this marinade-I always add more tomato sauce than the recipe calls for as well as more garlic. I marinate overnight for best results. you won't be disappointed! Superb everytime.

I made these shrimp skewers for a large family party...and it was loved by all. The cayenne gives the perfect "kick" while not overpowering the dish. Tasty on skewers or over pasta!  Both are DELICIOUS!!

Delicious!  My husband is pretty picky when it comes to how his shrimp is prepared and he loved this dish.  I added a little bit of Old Bay seasoning to the marinade and next time I might increase the amount of cayenne just to give it a little more kick.  Definitely a keeper!

The only ingredients I added to the shrimp were a drop of honey and a pinch of chopped ginger.  You can cut back on the olive oil and salt. And you won't even notice the heat from the pepper, trust me. We didn't put the shrimp on skewers but simply placed on a griddle in the gas grill.  They were ready to eat in a matter of minutes. A perfect meal to end the Memorial Day weekend.

SOOO delicious.  I also marinated some steak and alternated the steak and shrimp on the skewer.  I think it would also be good with some onions or peppers on the skewer, too, if you wanted to stretch the meat with a crowd.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was a fantastic marinade.  I doubled the recipe and added extra garlic.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used crushed canned tomatoes and I used dried basil instead of fresh.  I marinated three pounds of xtra large shrimp and then grilled them about two minutes per side.  Everyone raved.  The shrimp were a beautiful color from the tomato marinade.  I served them over a curry type brown basmati rice with chickpeas.  Yum!

A fantastic grilled shrimp recipe!!  Easy to make and delicious even for those who aren't big seafood fans.  We substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce and added some lime juice and it was excellent!

This is a consistant winner.  All ingredients are always on hand, everyone enjoys it, and is easy to make.  You can place frozen or thawed shrimp in the marinade (I recommend thawing first but if you can't is ok, just marinade about 1.5 hours and nuke in the microwave for a minute).  Keeper for sure!

My husband said this is the best shrimp he has ever had.  My shrimp was frozen so I mixed up the mairinade and let the shrimp thaw in it in the fridge.  I cooked them for 4 minutes on each side and they turned out perfect.  I didn't have any olive oil on hand so I used vegetable.  I also used dried basil instead od fresh.

Thought the tomato sauce would make the shrimp taste like they were dipped in cocktail sauce, instead it just threw the whole taste off.  I think I'm just a butter garlic shrimp person.  Sorry!

Its about time I finally found the perfect marinated recipe from shrimp!  I cooked these for the 4th of July using 4lbs of shrimp.  Grilled them outside on skewers.  I couldnt get over how everyone made a comment on how great they taste, even the kiddos!  I LOVE this recipe and wouldnt change anything.  Thanks for Sharing this Recipe Rachel!

Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!  This ranks as one of our all-time favorites, if not the favorite shrimp recipe.  We eliminated the salt and did not miss it.

I'm not a shrimp eater by my husband gave this 5 stars, easy. He said it's very tasty and didn't overpower the taste of the shrimp. I'll say it's very easy to prepare and easy to cook. Instead of tomato paste I used spaghetti sauce.

Excellent!  I didn't have basil so I used fresh chives and it was still excellent.  Can't wait to try the basil next time and there will be a next time!

This was my first time cooking shrimp, and they came out great. This is such a quick and easy dish. I used about 1.5 lbs of shrimp, and it was just enough of the marinade. So if I used the whole 2 lbs of shrimp, I probably would've wanted to make more of the marinade. I used dried basil instead of fresh. Will probably make again, since my husband LOVED them so much.

I took the advice from some other people and put this over pasta.  I halved the shrimp, thinking the marinade would serve as a sauce.  Which turned out wonderful, but not enough sauce!  So I would double the marinade.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine.  And I halved the cayenne pepper for fear of the taste with my sweet balsamic, which wasn't needed.  It wasn't too spicy, and could use the whole amount.  Next time I would add some chopped cooked tomatoes to the sauce. But overall this is a great (easy!)recipe, Thanks Rachel!!

Lovely absolutely lovely. I love grilled shrimp, but despise fried shrimp.  I just couldn't fix it often I didn't have a recipe i thoroughly enjoyed as I do this one.  Thanks so much Rachel.  Grilling shrimp now I will no longer frown upon.

I beefed up the garlic and left the rest of the recipe the same.  (used dried seasonings). Marinated for a couple of hours, skewered and grilled over hickory.  this was paired with our Christmas prime rib and though we have trolled through different shrimp recipes each year all agree that this was the best and we will likely stick to this one going forward.  the tomato base and smoke pair this shrimp recipe with beef extremely well.  we had a dry cabernet with tobacco notes and would recommend a red over white with this fish recipe.  Thanks for this find!

I've made this many, many times. Great recipe.  One day I was out of cayenne pepper so I used an Asian Garlic Chili sauce instead.  We loved it!  That's the only thing we use now.  Try this, you won't be disappointed.

Delicious! I didn't have tomatoe sauce so I used pizza sauce; maybe that was the difference. I also cooked it in a skillet with all of the marinade so there was this incredible sauce for the rice.  Really good.

After reading reviews I modified the recipe using a can of diced tomatoes and substituted dry basil and garlic.  Pulsed it in the blender prior to marinating. Family loved it and the shrimp were gone in no time!

I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted with balsamic vinegar.  The shrimp turned out great. I added skewers of veggies and angel hair pasta for sides.

We did not care for it.  We made the recipe exactly as detailed.  We used fresh caught shrimp, all quality spices and even our homemade tomato sauce (which we love). We thought there was just way too much sauce.  I would maybe try it again with half of the sauce.

If you were going to eat this with pasta, it might be a good combination.

Not as tasty as I thought it would. It tasted like its missing something.  I had to do a second batch and did the basic, lemon pepper and grilled it.

Only change I made was to use ketchup instead of tomato sauce because I was halving the recipe and didn't want to open a can for such a small amount. If you are worried about the cayenne, don't: My non-spicy wife and three year old though it was fine (although I could definitely taste it).

This was so easy and excellent. We even brushed some of the marinade on some eggplant that was cut in half length wise. BBQ'd it all and yum. Served with lemon basmati rice. We used the extra large jumbo shrimp, so tender.

Have made it several times - it is a family favorite!  I basically follow the recipe, but usually substitute ketchup for tomato sauce, so as to not open a  full can for only a quarter cup.  I have used regular, spicy, and a combination of both types of ketchup.  Also used only white wine vinegar once because it was all I had on hand.  The shrimp still tasted yummy.  Have also used one tablespoon white wine vinegar and one tablespoon red wine vinegar and achieved wonderful results.  If we feel like kicking up the heat, I will add one-quarter teaspoon crushed red peppers.  No matter how we try it, we absolutely LOVE this recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

We can't get over how delish this was! I only had 1lb shrimp but two people gladly ate every one of them:) The suggestion of adding a can of diced garlic basil diced tomato and throwing everythg into food processor was the clincher! Outstanding, can't wait to make again over angel hair pasta. BEST FLAVOR SAUCE!

This was delicious! I only did two minutes in the Foreman grill, however, and it was too long, so they were a bit tough.

This is the BEST shrimp marinade!  If you are in a hurry and don't want to have to let it sit for a half hour, or bother starting up the grill, these are great broiled.  I just mix the shrimp with the marinade, throw it on a foil covered cookie sheet (or broiler pan), and put it under the flame for a few minutes on each side.  I like to broil it until the shrimp gets slightly blackened on the edges.  My husband likes his spicy, so I add some Cajun's Choice creole seasoning or Tabasco sauce to his.  Yum!

This is an awesome recipe, without changing a thing. I broiled without turning (in the oven) for just a few minutes, and they were perfect. They are also delicious as leftovers, cold or heated.

EXCELLENT....EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THEM AND WE HAD THEM AS AN APPETIZER. I had 42 jumbo shrimp which I skewered first, put the shrimp and sauce in a ziplock to take to a party, which were then cooked on a gas grill about 5 mins per side. They were marinated about 2hrs before they were cooked. I did use chili sauce instead of just tomato sauce and lots of fresh basil.

Not a big fan of shrimp, but these were delicious!  Very simple to make as well.  I used tin foil tent to grill as it was storming outside and I wasn't going to stand out there.  3 minutes each side.  Will be making this again and again!

Perfect as written. I can never make enough of these to satisfy everyone. The spice is subtle and kids love these shrimp as much as adults!
Personally I love strong flavors so I added additional basil, garlic and Cayenne (I've also used crushed red pepper flakes which have worked well with this recipe). Dont forget to soak the bamboo skewers before grilling :)

My 12 and 14 year olds made this shrimp on the grill and ate the entire batch of shrimp themselves (about 60 shrimps!). Didn't have tomato sauce and apple cider vinegar so used ketchup and white vinegar. It worked fine.

I sometimes look at the ingredients of recipes, and think really.  So that is when I look at the reviews, and thought almost 2k people cannot be wrong.  I had all ingredients on hand less the fresh basil. I used peel/eat shrimp, doubled the recipe to include 2 pieces of fish.  Mixed items together in the morning, and allowed it to marinate for the day.  I was nervous being as I was unfamiliar with the recipe.  Threw it on the grill, and dinner was done in about 10 minutes.  Served with a salad, and baked artichokes.  I must say this was the absolute BEST grilled shrimp recipe I have ever had.  My husband, and son raved about it as they were licking their fingers.  One change I made was throwing in 2 tablespoons of a spicy mango sauce I had on hand.  I intend on using this for the Fourth of July, and throwing in scallops, shrimp, and fish.

Wow - amazing flavor.  And I used cooked frozen jumbo shrimp and broiled them in the oven.  I also used dried spices vs fresh and this was a hit.  Will do again with fresh everything just to compare.  Can't wait, based on all the reviews.

An immediate family favorite.  This got the thumbs up from all family members that tried it.  The only substitution I made was chili sauce instead of tomato sauce so I could save what was left over for another recipe.

I used Tony Chacheres Cajun Spice instead of cayenne pepper and left out the red wine vinegar. This was amazing. Be sure to reflate the shrimp with the sauce towards the end for maximum flavor.

This is the BEST marinated shrimp i have ever eaten!  I highly recommend it!  I threw my shrimp in the marinade in the morning, and so all i had to do was grill them up at dinner!  I popped them off the skewers and layed the shrimp over a simple salad.  I put out dressing, and nobody used it it, because the shrimp were that delicious!  5 stars!

Excellent! This was the first time that I ever fixed shrimp at home.  I made it without any changes, but only had about 1 1/2 pounds of medium, raw, peeled and deveined shrimp. I used a scant 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. It was so good, and gone in a flash! Already requests to make this again! Wondering why I waited so long to try shrimp at home!! Thanks for this winner!

I took this to a BBQ and everyone raved about it.  I don't eat seafood so don't taste which makes it hard to be sure people aren't just being polite. Since people kept talking about them I'm confident in giving 5 stars. The only change I made was to reduce oil to 2 tbsp. thank you for making me the hit of the BBQ.

This recipe is hard to beat.I just made sure I used fresh garlic and fresh basil. I let them marinade for 6  hours plus after 3  hours I stirred the marinade to make sure all shrimp were adequately coated.One last thing you have to use a  grill to get maximum flavor. If you have a party ya better make a ton because hot off the grill because they will not last.One last thing  ( I promise )   Its always best to use fresh shrimp if at all possible. but you can use frozen uncooked shrimp if need be. The recipe is one of our favorites...Hope you enjoy them..

Absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly.  I added whole mushrooms and marinaded them with the shrimp.  On the skewer I alternated shrimp and mushrooms.  Both tasted awesome!

It was awesome! I followed some of the other suggestions and doubled the marinade and put half of it on the shrimp. The other half I put over linguini and served with fresh parmesan cheese...... I will definitely be making this again!!

Tried this recently but didn't use basil because I didn't have any on hand. It was really delicious even without it! This is easy enough for week nights, but delicious enough to share with guests!!

This recipe is not the same as the one featured in the video - there was no red wine vinegar,basil or tomato sauce in the video - they used tomato paste and oregano.  Also black pepper and I believe red pepper flakes ...........hmmmmm something screwy here! Anyway - i did the recipe with the individual 2 Tbsp packets now available  of tomato paste, the red wine vinegar, seafood seasoning,  several dashes of cayenne, parsley. a splash only of olive oil and a good squeeze of fresh lemon and salt.  This turns out excellent and best yet if you leave the shells on  - it protects the shrimp during grilling in which you can skip the skewers if you get the bigger ones.  Definitely a favorite!

This IS the Shrimp dish to IMPRESS COMPANY! It is DELICIOUS! Better than at the best restaurant.  I would give it more than 5 stars... If you want to fancy it up.. put it on some mini skewers with some cherry tomatoes and green peppers. YUMMO!

While I was mixing the ingredients together for the marinade I was a bit concerned the taste would be a bit bland.  However, the cayenne pepper definitely gives the recipe a kick.  I used dried basil instead of fresh basil.  I can't wait to try this recipe with fresh basil.  Great recipe!

This was one of the best shrimp appys. I went a bit heavy handed on the garlic. Also depending on the skewers used always soak the cheaper wooded ones first to eliminate burning and the burnt taste.
Will be making these again and again.

This was awesome!  I let mine marinate a full hour, which was key!  Don't be afraid to use the cayenne pepper, even if serving to kids.  It's not spicy at all.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is 10+ stars.  Absolutely perfectly magnificent.  I use this amount of marinade for just one pound.  I can even let it sit for the afternoon.  You will not be sorry.  So easy and simply the cream of the crop perfectomundooooo!

Probably one of the simplest, tastiest shrimp recipes I've found in 20 years. One tip: If you find using skewers a pain, you can grill a whole whack of sumptuous shrimp by simply grilling them loose in a fish or veggie basket designed for grilling.Shortly after color changes they are done. Served on top of your family's favourite rice, everybody will be most satisfied. It's become a family favourite. Keep a bag of frozen shrimp on hand because this is quick and tasty and you'll be making it quite often once you try it.

This Marinated shrimp was very good my hubby loved it a lot. Only chances I did was add chipotle instead cayen peper, and instead of tomotoe sauce I add crushed tomotoes. Great recipe.

Oh my goodness, just made this recipe yesterday. It was absolutely divine!! I marinated overnight (not on purpose, it just ended up happening) and they were sooo flavourful!! I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. I also didn't have red wine vinegar and used rice vinegar as a substitute. Even with all the substitutes I had to use the shrimp turned out wonderfully!

Easy and Delicious!  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dry. This marinade is subtle and doesn't overwhelm yet gives the shrimp a nice clean taste. This is the second time I have used this recipe. The first time I marinated 3-4 hours for. This time about an hour. The tase was the same. I used frozen raw, deveined, tails off shrimp - could be easier and was a big hit with our dinner party. I mixed my own serving with wild rice and it made a meal.

This is a brilliant recipe! I've made it many times and love how vivid the flavors in the marinade are without overwhelming the shrimp. It's so easy to throw all the marinade ingredients into a mini food processor to combine. Lots of flavor for not a lot of work. Thanks BLONDIPEREZ!

I tried this awhile back with recipe exactly as written.  We liked it and just returned to try again.  This time I did not have tomato sauce so I substituted with ketchup.  Couldn't find my skewers so I tossed the shrimp onto the George Foreman grill and cooked for a couple minutes.  Yum!  I like tomato ketchup better than the sauce - and now I don't have to worry about what to do with the leftover canned tomato sauce.  Excellent recipe either way, so easy and very tasty.  I think the fresh basil is a requirement - don't try to skip it.  The shrimp made a nice addition to the top of a spinach salad tonite.  We will use this again and again!

Only giving it 4 stars since I just moved,and didn't have tomato sauce.  Used chili sauce instead, and was great with this!  More subtle flavor, but kicked it up with some cajun seasoning.  Thanks for sharing!

Super good!  I made it with cocktail sauce and grilled the skewers for 1-1/2 minutes on each side.  Really healthy and goes great with a green salad.  Next time we might tossing the shrimp in with the salad -- they tasted great together!

YES!!  So good.  SO, so good.  I used the rest of the can of the tomato sauce and added more of the other ingredients (olive oil, vinegar, basil, etc.)to make a sauce to toss with angel hair pasta and serve with the grilled shrimp. I did not measure the ingredients for the sauce, but followed the marinated recipe to the letter.  Delicious!!

I love this marinade and use it on boneless skinless chicken breast and fish fillets too. My son calls it "Steak Chicken" because he thinks the marinade makes the chicken taste like it has BBQ sauce on it. I don't care what he calls it as long as he eats it all up! I have used both fresh and dries basil in the recipe and both work great.

Made it for a Memorial day cookout.  I have alot of guests who don't like hot/spicy food, so I made it as stated. Everyone loved these and were getting others to try them.  The guests were also trying to figure out what gave it that little heat.  I left them in the marinade overnight and used large already butterfield or deveined shrimp.  I soaked wooden skewers in water.  About two hours before the party, I put the shrimp on the skewers and let them continue to marinate in the sauce.  Didn't have to spend time preparing them after guests arrived.  When they were done, I slid the shrimp off onto small plates and put them out as appetizers.  They were a big hit.  Going to make them again for the 4th of July.

This was great. Using RAW SHRIMP is key. I sub'd tom paste for the sauce and cut back on the olive oil. I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand so I just used a splash of red wine with a drizzle of vinegar and that worked just fine.

I don't eat shellfish, so I can't tell you how good it is, but I've made this three times for friend's BBQs and everyone absolutely RAVED about it.  Better than anything you'd get in a 5 star restaurant, or so I'm told.

Easy recipe and very delicious. It tastes so wonderful my husband, who doesn't like shrimp even loved it!. I had to use 1 tbsp of dry basil instead of fresh because that's what I had on hand. I will make this again and again!! Low-carb and high protein...perfect for IR people. I grilled it and I suggest that is how it should be cooked it just gives it that little extra something.

I also subsituted the tomato sauce but with shrimp coctail sauce. I didnt have red wine vinniger so i used balsamic. I increased the cayenne a bit. And instead of grilling them i sauteed them in the marinade and served over boked whipped garlic and cheddar potatoes. So yummy! My toddler and hubby gobbled it up. Will make again!

my 11 yr old doesn't like shrimp but when he tried this after I ask him to take a bite he kept eating them and said mom this is delicious.  This is a recipe I will make over and over.

This has become my go to recipe for shrimp, I make it  at least 2 times a month, the best way to make it is skewered on the grill but its still awesome on the stove top.

Wow, tripled the recipe for 44 oz. large shrimp. Do not use iodized salt. Too salty. Tripped use I Tbls kosher salt. Shrimp depending on where it comes from may be saltier in oriagin.  Used leftover marinade with left over tomatoe sauce to use lightly over pasta. Will share and use again.

With all the rave reviews, I had to try it.  As others have said, this is amazingly simple and GREAT!  Already a shrimp lover, this marinade took my love for shrimp to a whole new level !  This will go on my list of favs! Thanks!

Made these alongside the "Grilled Salmon I" recipe from this website, for my daughter, who won't eat salmon.  She loved 'em, and shared a few with my son and his girlfriend, and they loved 'em too!

There's not enough I can say about this recipe, it was delicious!  I don't understand the poor reviews from some individuals but you can't please everyone.  I marinated it for 4 hours, and added more Cayenne.  I don't have a grill so I just baked it ant it was fantastic.  I also didn't have fresh basil so I used dried :-)

I added a heaping tablespoon of basil from the squeeze tube (produce section)instead of fresh basil. I used precooked shrimp and cooked it in the sauce in a saucepan, adding two tablespoons of butter. EXCELLENT. Thank you for this recipe.

Everyone raves about this shrimp recipe. I make it on the grill 3 minutes per side. I add a few drops of tabasco to the marinade and it
is yummy!If I don't have red wine vinegar, I have used fresh lemon juice, or rice vinegar. Turns out great!

Delicious!  Also substituted Chili sauce for tomato sauce and only had apple cider vinegar so substituted it for red wine vinegar.  Absolutely a keeper.

I cut this recipe in half it was perfect amount for 2 for dinner along with some veggies. It is very flavorful and not too spicy although you could make it more spicy easily. This is easy and quick and tasty!

Excellent recipe.  Best grilled shrimp I have ever had.  My family loves this dish.  Made it for friends who insisted on getting the recipe.  Made is the first time exactly as written and have never changed a thing.

WOW. Wonderful. It started pouring rain unexpectedly just before I planned to cook out--- I used my electric grill and it was still wonderful! Kids loved it and previously they only liked popcorn shrimp. Thanks, very nice, definitely added to my recipe box!

yum yum yum!  i liked this marinade so much i also used it for whole grilled trout. my man said it was the best fish marinade ever.  after making a few times with tomato sauce, i have started making with tomato paste - sticks to the seafood better & i don't end up throwing away a bunch of unused tomato sauce.  :)

We loved this recipe!  I made one change, though.  I didn' have any tomato sauce on hand, so I decided to use barbeque sauce.  Turned out excellent!  When my husband actually goes out of his way to tell me it's good...I know I hit something on the head!

This recipe is a keeper..I marinated it overnight and it was perfect. Don't keep them on the grill too long though..maybe 2-3 mins per side..

This tasted amazing! My shrimp, however, was a little under cooked so it may need to be cooked a little longer. It may just be me, though, because I had just bought a bag of frozen shrimp. Great recipe - went perfectly on top of pasta!

Great Recipe! Really quick and easy to put together and tasted great. I paired it with rice and broccoli for an awesome dinner. I followed the recipe exactly but used a grill basket in lieu of skewers. Even my 14 yr old daughter (who doesn't like shrimp) came back for more.

These shrimp are off the charts! I grilled mine on the George Foreman since the weather was undesirable. I brushed the marinade on them while they were grilling. The sun may not have been shining outside but it was in my belly! You know what I mean... they were tasty.

Only change I  made was to use ketchup rather than tomato sauce. Purchased already skewered shrimp, marinaded the shrimp, and then cooked cooked on a George Foreman Grill.  Served with Filets (surf and turf), but they would be good served as appetizers.  We will make again.

Great summer recipe!  Easy.  I used chili sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  And basted the shrimp as it was grilling with the remaining marinade.

I made these tonight and they were great!  I goofed and neglected to put in the red wine vinegar, but they were still great!  I used 4 blend peppercorns.  This is a keeper!  I will make sure I use the red wine wine vinegar the next time!  TY!

Super easy and delicious! I followed the recipe but used diced tomatoes and suggested, more garlic and basil and red wine vinegar. I didn't pulse it in the food processor, I just mixed it really well and they sat in the fridge for 3 hours. I'm still eating left overs after two days!

I have made this recipe several times with a few variations.  Most importantly, fresh basil is a MUST.  Dried basil from the spice rack doesn't add any flavor to the shrimp.  Watch the amount of salt that you add, especially if the tomato sauce is salty.  The cayenne adds a subtle zing to the flavor.  If you like it more spicy, increase the cayenne.  Excellent recipe.  My family and friends love it!

This marinade was delicous.  I have tried many others and did not like them.  Wonderful flavor.  I had to substitute chilli sauce for tomato sauce because I did not have any tomato sauce on hand.

Fantastic!!!! Added a little cajun seasoning for an extra kick. Used charcoal grill with a handful of mesquite. Can not wait to make these again. This is a must try recipe!!!! Would give more than 5 stars if I could.

again ... i have to say how scrumptious this is! everyone who tries it is shocked by the LACK of ingredients. This is my go to for salads, wraps and just plain old snacking. Love it, love it, love it!

I just need to say that even a few years later I STILL use this as my go to shrimp recipe. It is a 'must bring' to any bbq or party. Just wanted you to know how much it is loved by all (even kiddos) who demolish it. I say demolish, because I now time how long it lasts! Luckily I always bring a 'second helping' :)

We made this tonight, pleased to find we had most of these ingredients on hand (a few items easy to substitute).  It was outstanding alongside grilled fresh sweet corn!  Dessert was homemade coconut ice cream.  Loved it; great dinner.

Everyone who tried these shrimp really liked them.  I substituted prawns for the shrimp and cooked for 3 to 4 minutes on a grill pan over medium high heat and they turned out really well.  A very nice (and simple!) marinade!

I've never met a shrimp I didn't like but this was one of the best I've had.

Added a bit more cayenne.

What's nice is the marinade doesn't burn off since it cooks so quickly -- so you have a nice sauce on the shrimp when you're done. If you add a little more tomato sauce you'll have a good amount of sauce on each shrimp.

Recently made these for a party.  I made them to accompany a pot of chicken Jambalaya.  They were a huge hit and everyone asked me for the recipe.  Not bad for my first time grilling shrimp.  I didn't measure the herbs and spices in recipe exactly and probably used more basil than called for (basically an entire bunch).  They were awesome, even using frozen raw shrimp instead of fresh.

I have a favorite recipe for cajun shrimp, which everyone loves. I decided to try something differenet and very glad I did. This was super easy and delicious. I used chilli sauce instead of the tomato sauce and I can't imagine doing it different. Friends at work, who are afraid of spice, tried the leftovers and loved it. They ran out to buy shrimp. Definitely a keeper. I am trying it tonight with chicken.

Loved it! I followed the recipe to the dot, and the shrimp turned out great. I used a Foreman grill (lean mean machine) to grill them.

The shrimp had great flavor. I used the left over marinade to put on the angel hair pasta. My kids even loved it and asked for more. I would maybe reduce the amount of red wine vinegar because it was a little strong. The cayenne pepper gave it that extra kick. Very easy dish and great for busy schedules.

Very good! Took the advice of the more seasoned chefs reviewing this recipe and did not marinate the shrimp for as long as called for. All turned out exceptionally well. Definite 5 stars!

Mmmmm, it makes my mouth water just thinking about this dish! I made enough for 4 servings using medium precooked shrimp and dried basil instead of fresh. I threw everything into a ziploc bag to marinate for close to an hour and cooked it in the skillet on the stove (we got lazy) and yum! This was SO good! I served it with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. I will most definitely be making this again, this recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

After eating at a VERY expensive restaraunt, I wanted to make shrimp and grits for my daughter and myself.  These shrimp were PERFECT to go with the grits.  I did let it marinate for about 2 hours.  REALLY good!

Excellent marinade.  I didn't put these on a skewer, made angel hair pasta and added broccoli the last few minutes of cooking the pasta.  Wonderful recipe.

Used this recipe this recipe several times this summer.  We skewered them with peppers, onions and mushrooms and served with steamed rice and green salad. Everyone asked for the recipe. VERY GOOD, thanks for sharing.

This is hands down my favorite marinade to date.  It is good for veggie kabobs also.

Great taste!  Try to eat them fresh off the grill so they are still hot.  Microwaving them makes them rubbery.

Perfect. I have a two year old who loves  this dish. Not too rich & not too spicy. The only change I mae was 1.5 lbs of shrimp, because that's what I had. It seemed to be a good ratio of shrimp/marinade.

Easy with phenomenal flavor.  The seasoning blends well without overpowering the flavor of the shrimp.  Don't change a thing.

We were able to whip this up in no time, and it was great!  We aren't big on cayenne so substituted paprika and got a nice smoky flavor.  We weren't able to give it a full 30 minute marinade, but it was still pretty good.

We made this recipe as is, and although it's good on the grill it's even better in a frying pan.  The reason is that the shrimp then cooks in the marinated juices, which brings the flavors out more!  Great recipe!

I love shrimp cooked in just about any manner, while my husband only likes it fried, BUT I tried this recipe anyway and he absolutely LOVED it! We don't have a grill, so I heated the shrimp and marinade mixture in a deep iron skillet with extra sauce, and served over rice. I served a green salad along with it for a complete meal. Definitely a "keeper" recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This is by far the best marinade for shrimp I have ever found.  I did add about 1/4 a cup of chili sauce to my second batch. Fabulous!

Delicious and easy.  Didn't have tomato sauce so I substituted bottled chili sauce.Threaded shrimp on skewers before marinating so it wasn't so messy.  Started to rain so I grilled on my George Forman.  Served over rice.  Wonderful!!

Yum! Made these for a crowd on a camping trip. Marinated them before we left. These are great! The basil is so refreshing and it makes the shrimp.

Delicious, delicious, delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and after a wonderful meal, I wouldn't change a thing...except, next time I'll make more! Thanks for a terrific recipe! I'm so glad I found it. I served the shrimp with a salad and Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes which I also found here. You need to try both recipes. You won't regret it.

OMG!  No wonder this marinade has such wonderfu reviews and ratings!  Followed recipe except for cutting inhalf due to my lack of shrimp.  Love the fresh basil and garlic coming through with just the right amount of heat from the cayenne.  Will make this for company later this summer.

This is my husband's review, since I don't eat seafood (and may I add that we live on the water and can get an abudance of seafood) he said that it was really good. He loved the flavor and so did my son.

Use a touch less oil and marinate for a lot longer I did for 4 hrs. Also soak the wood skewers in water for 30min so they don't burn

Had these as an appetizer for the 4th of July, all two pounds of shrimp were consumed within 5 minutes of coming off the grill. A hit! And terribly easy to make! I prepped the marinade the day before, and stirred the shrimp in it an hour before going on the grill.   Thank you for this recipe!

This was THE BEST shrimp recipe I have ever made! I didn't have hot pepper sauce, so I used a small amount of red pepper flakes, and I also substituted ketchup for the tomato paste (I didn't want to open a can just for a tablespoon!) and it was excellent! I love this recipe and will make it many more times! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

The shrimp was slightly flavorless, not rising up to my expectations from the rave reviews I read, but pairing it with a lemon dip brought out a nice flavor. Everyone thought this dish was wonderful and they can't wait for me to make it again.

I made this (as listed) for a 4th of July get together with family.  It disappeared quickly and received rave reviews!  I used pre-steamed, peeled & deveined shrimp.  We decided that this dish is delightful grilled or not.  Will DEFINITELY make again.  Thanks!!

My boyfriend LOVED this. I skewered the shrimp with grape tomatoes bell peppers and onions and soaked them all in the marinade. I made about 12 of these and I only ate 2 because my boyfriend DEVOURED the other 10. Delicious

I made this today for a poolside lunch with friends.  The only modifications were that I used 4 large cloves of garlic, and I grilled the shrimp on a grill pan over the stove and didn't bother to skewer them.  There were only 3 of us, but the 2lbs of shrimp were devoured in no time.  Too bad because I was really hoping for leftovers!  These would be great over pasta.  The 1/4tsp of cayenne gives nice flavor but not too much spice.  If you like things a bit spicier, I would increase the cayenne a bit. Overall, this is a terrific, easy recipe that is much better than many of the other grilled shrimp recipes I've tried.  I WILL be making this again!

These were really good.  I didn't have any cayenne so substituted chili pepper flakes and powder.  I also didn't want to open a whole can of tomato sauce so just used a small can of V-8 juice.  We also had veggie kabobs of green, red and yellow peppers, onions and fresh mushrooms that I basted with the marinade.  Quick and fancy enough for my husband's BD dinner.  Definitely a keeper!

I am on Weight Watchers and so I decided to try this recipe.  I used less olive oil and it still turned out so delicious.  I am one of those shrimp eaters that the only way I can eat shrimp is to have cocktail sauce.  I didn't need any with this.  I normally have shrimp left over and this time my husband and my daughter were asking if there were any more.

I've made this a bunch of times and it is always perfect!  Super easy...I've used my grill pan on top of the stove and my George Foreman too.  Both work just about as well as outdoor grilling for the winter months.

This was excellent and so easy!  We added lime juice to the marinade and also squeezed some on top once the shrimp were done.  Will definitley be making again!

I didnt use fresh basil or garlic but it was still AWSOME!  I mixed it all up first thing in the morning and let it sit all day.  When I grilled it I put down aluminum foil and poured the leftover marinade over the shrimp while they were cooking.   I have already recommended this recipe to all my family.  Even my 1 1/2 yr old loved it.

Amazing on grilled shrimp!!! Also tried on chicken. Not as earth-shattering on chicken but a fast and easy marinade for summer months.

This grilled shrimp is fabulous!  I made it this week for my family before I tried it for a party this weekend.  The cayenne pepper is not overpowering at all.  Don't be shy with it.

i joined allrecipes just to review this recipe... it is SO GOOD!  i didn't have fresh basil or tomato sauce on hand but i did have trader joe's tomato and basil marinara sauce open so i used that and some ketchup to make up the 1/4c.  then i just added about a tsp or so dried basil... it was ooooooh sooooo good!  absolutely no need for cocktail sauce that would have totally ruined it!  i served it with salad and baked potatoes and everyone's plates were cleaned and smiles were on everyone's faces!  i don't think i will ever go with plain garlic butter shrimp again!

Followed the recipe (I did use ketchup instead of tomato sauce), marinated for 45min, grilled them perfectly and the "Giant Prawns" looked great.  My husband and I both thought they were OK, but not our favorite.  I think that hint of vinegar just did not go with our idea of a perfect flavor.  Probably won't make this again with so many other great recipes out there.

This was absolutely wonderful. I made it exactly as directed and the whole family thought it was a HUGE hit. I made whole wheat linguini and after everything was done, I threw all together in a fry pan with a tiny bit of EVOO and some of the leftover marinade just to combine all the flavors. I let it cook only a few minutes. Truly delicious!

The marinade tastes like spicy ketchup and it seemed like it might overpower the shrimp, but once they were cooked the tastes were very complimentary.  The garlic grilled artichokes (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grilled-Garlic-Artichokes/Detail.aspx)  made for a perfect paring!

These were great, kids even loved them.  I would reduce the tomato sauce and or increase the vinegar next time.  Just a tad too sweet for my taste, but the family loved them.  Don't be afraid of the cayenne.... just a hint of heat.  Good recipe!

A lot of my guests raved about this skewers but I myself wasn't wild about the tomato flavor.  I did follow other recommendations and only marinate for 20 minutes.  Good recipe.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I love shrimp and always keep some in the freezer but I've never cooked them on the grill or marinated them (I know, its terrible). Mine sat in the fridge for a little over 2 hours (bad time planning on my part). I know everyone hates when people change recipes and then review them, but that's what makes this site great! I didn't have fresh basil or tomato sauce (I swear I was a mess today) so I added ketchup and dried basil. I also squirted a little lemon juice over my shrimp while they were marinating (what's shrimp without lemon juice?). Once my boyfriend put those things on the grill them smelled wonderful! Some of the best shrimp I've ever had...am planning on making these for a get together in a few weeks!!!!

I've made these shrimp a bunch of times now and they are consistently amazing, earning their five stars every time. You really can't go wrong with this recipe because it's very simple and quick, and since you only have to marinate for an hour you don't have to plan that far ahead to make something delicious.  I usually toss in extra cayenne pepper and I've also added a small amount of balsamic vinegar in place of some of the red wine vinegar before.  Since I personally like things to be fully submersed in a marinade, one warning is that this recipe doesn't make a lot of it.  I generally make a full batch of the marinade for one pound of shrimp (instead of two as listed), otherwise it ends up being a thin coating instead of something that is surrounding and covering every shrimp.  Of course this is a personal preference and the first time I made the recipe (using the full two pounds of shrimp) they still came out perfect.  You will not be disappointed by this recipe.  It lives up to the hype.

okay, i've just mixed this up, stirred in the (cooked) shrimp AND IT'S ALL GONE!! Didn't get to refrigerate or grill them. Family devoured them as is. So, its just steak tonight. Not sure if i should be mad about that....  Will be making this again and again. Made according to recipe except took another reviewers idea to use ketchup re no tomatoe sauce. Didnt' look like it would be enough marinade for 2 lbs of shrimp but it was plenty.

Excellent with pasta.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger for a little extra zip.  I also made a little extra to use as baste, spooning over the shrimp a little as they grilled.  I also reserved a couple of tablespoons to toss with the pasta.  The flavors are very complex so it is not obvious that the marinade is tomato-sauce based.

December '09: I marinated thin sliced fresh turkey breast & then grilled.  Excellent for those tired of roasted turkey.

I wanted a chilled shrimp for a party and thought this might fit the bill--it did!  I made the marinade as written with one exception--I had only rice vinegar.  Fresh basil and garlic is a MUST--don't substitute that dried stuff.  I refrigerated for two hours and then steamed them quickly.  Chilled in fridge and served cold.  Yummy!

Easy and a big hit with family and friends.  I served with black beans and rice and a salad.  I marinated for 24 hours.  Next time I will buy shrimp that is already peeled and deveined - that alone took over 30 min. since I doubled the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful.  I didn't change any of the ingredients and it turned out perfectly.  I marinated for about 3-4 hours  - - I like to marinate in big freezer bags vs bowls..turns out better this way and takes up less space in the fridge! I had never tried grilling shrimp before - so easy and quick.  I was VERY happy with this - - thanks so much for the recipe!  Will definitely make again - especially when we have guests.

My family liked this so much, I finally signed up to write a review.  In fact, it's marinading in the fridge now.  I have tweaked from the reviews and leave out the salt, add Old Bay and a touch of lemon juice.  Our favorite marinade for shrimp by a mile.

WOW!  So good, this is a new staple when family comes to visit! I thought it was even better the next day... cold. I think it would be fantastic on a salad- but I can't think of a salad dressing that would compliment the flavor.  Any suggestions?  If so, please email me at ccrinaz@cox.net Thanks in advance for any help!

This is officially our go-to shrimp marinade. Great for grilling - also great to do on the stove, add some extra tomato sauce, and serve over pasta. Very versatile and just bursting with flavor!

This was fantastic.  I made it for an end-of-summer cookout, and everyone loved it.  I followed the directions exactly, except subbing cilantro for the basil (a friend is allergic to basil, poor guy) and while the cilantro was good, I can imagine that the basil will make it fabulous (I love basil).  Next time I might try using ketchup for the tomato sauce; I personally thought that a little sweetness would have added something....or maybe a dash of Worcestershire or even some brown sugar.  The cayenne amount was just right for me, but my husband likes SPICY, so he could've taken more heat.  A dash of Tabasco, maybe?  The Chipotle Tabasco is really good, that might be worth a try sometime too.  Anyway, this one rated 5 stars the first time I tried it; I'm very excited to add my own personal touches and see how it comes out.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My hubby said this was very good.  I'm not a big fan of shrimp, but I tried a piece and liked it... I can't say I loved it, but the fact that I was able to eat it at all is saying something.  Thanks!

We succesfully executed this recipe!  Kids and Adults all loves it. I made two modifications.  We used Ketchup and we reduced the pepper to 1/8th of a tsp.  Both worked out very well. The pepper was still there and the hint of it was ok with my very sensetive family!  Thank you for this great recipe!  Made it again Sept 2011 even better this time!  Kid loved it!

Very simple and quick.  Like some of the others, I saved the marinade and brushed the shrimp during grilling.  I may add a bit more cayenne pepper next time.  Thanks!

I will also saute the shrimp in the marinade when I don't feel like sitting and waiting for our charcoal grill to heat up. Still tastes yummy!

Awesome!  These shrimp are totally kid friendly--my picky 8 year old daughter loves them.  They were recently a hit on our summer houseboat trip.  So easy, you'll make them all the time!

This recipe was really good.  I used tomato paste with a little water cuz thats what I had on hand and also used garlic salt since I thought I had cloves and didn't.  These were gone in no time.  I will be making this again!

This was so good! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used some marinara sauce, but the taste was delicious! My husband, who isn't a big fan of shrimp, liked it as well. Definitely high praise from him. I really liked how the ingredients are things I always have on hand.

I honestly LOVED these shrimp.  I thought the flavor was AMAZING, but I may have cheated a little.  I didn't have tomato sauce, but I DID have Mrs. T's Bold & Spicy Bloody Mary mix in my fridge.  While it didn't exactly add any spice, it probably added flavor.  And, boy!  What a flavor!!!!  I'm going to make these for a large group of guests this week, and I cannot wait for them to try it!

Made this as an appetizer for a family cookout (grilled steaks were the main dish).  An absolute hit!  Everyone loved them, even more than the steaks, which are my specialty.  I used frozen peeled and deveined shrimp, and substituted 2 tsp. dried basil as I didn't have fresh basil. Fabulous!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exacely except instead of putting the shrimp on skewers I used our BBQ Wok pan and just stir fried them for a few minutes until done.  Can't wait to make this for company.  Don't change ingredients.  Perfect as is.

this was really good.  I did it all at the very last minute - like an hour before we ate!  I didn't have any tom sauce so I just used tom paste and added water.  marinated less than an hour - still good.  definitely use fresh basil.  I used the "grill shrimp" from heinens - in a bag - sooooooo yummy!  just put them on the grill about 10 min

This is a great simple go to weeknight marinade for shrimp.  The ingredients are things I almost always have around the house, and I have used dried herbs when I didn't have fresh on hand for an equally delicious effect.

Excellent.  My very picky husband who only likes the best of the best said this one's a keeper.  Didn't change a thing. Marinated about 45 minutes. Thank you for an excellent, easy recipe.

The tomato and vinegar combo give the shrimp a sweet kick while the basil adds another layer of flavor. Very nice!

Really enjoyed this.  Only made a few changes:  added a little bit more garlic, instead of tomato sauce I used half a can of diced tomatos, and whipped up everything for the marinade in the food processer.  Can't wait to have this again.

This was delicious.  I accidentally used pre-cooked frozen shrimp, but I just marinated it overnight in the fridge and heated in a pan, and it worked well.

This went into our weekly meal rotation, which is saying a lot. I mean every single week we eat this now. We buy frozen shrimp at our local warehouse club and defrost under running cold water.   Great with bowtie alfredo pasta and grilled zucchini or steamed veggies.

Used half the shrimp but the full amount of marinade. Added some red pepper flakes and reduced the olive oil to 1/4c based on other reviews. Excellent.

We've eaten this 3x in the last month...that's how much we love it! We marinate our shrimp for about an hour and brush the shrimp as we coook it on the grill. We had a cookout and made this for some friends and family and EVERYONE loved it.

I made some of the slight changes that others suggested: cut down red wine vinegar by a tablespoon, used 1/4 cup olive oil, used 5 cloves garlic and since I didn't have any fresh basil I used dried but these were soooo delicious! My husband likes them and I will definitely make them again.

Fantastic, I followed the recipe exactly as written. I wouldn't change a thing it is a perfect combination of flavors. I had left over fresh basil and tomato sauce so I made the marinade again the next day this time using chicken breasts...and once again fantastic.

This shrimp was the BEST. I was unsure of the combination of ingredients but they worked perfectly and complimented each other. I served it with fresh romaine salad and pineapple salsa it was amazing!!!

This was very good. I think I will actually add more cayenne pepper next time. I made angel hair with margarine, garlic salt, pepper, parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.   I think this would also be very good with fettuccine al fredo.

OMG! Absolutely delicious. I made this exactly as directed, except I didn't have cayenne so i used red pepper. It was awesome but the boyfriend said he would've like it better with cayenne.  I cooked the shrimp about 5 minutes per side on gas grill on lo. Will definitely try the marinade on chicken kabobs too!

This was excellent. I used 5-7 shrimp per pound (Big) cooked for about 15 minutes on the Weber at medium heat. I doubled the cayenne because we like spice. I had to substitute dried basil for fresh but it worked out just fine.

The recipe is easy and delicious.  I followed it as is and wouldn't change anything.  I don't like spicy hot and I could handle this recipe.  You can reduce the cayennne some if you absolutely don't want any kick to it.

This shrimp recipe is absolutely amazing! I always triple the recipe and freeze the extra for later. Definitely grill instead of saute the shrimp and definitely use fresh basil. Ya'll have to try this one... I promise that you'll will fall in love with it like I did.

Yummy!  I added zucchinis, yellow Squash, and mushrooms to my shrimp skewers.  I made them for our Easter Sunday family gathering.  Everyone absolutely loved them...  I will definitely be making more of this.  Best shrimp ever!

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve. Since there were only two of us, I halved the recipe. I used frozen shrimp, instead of fresh shrimp. I substituted the basil for oregano and the cayenne pepper with red pepper. After I placed the shrimp on skewers, I cooked them on a George Foreman grill.  The recipe was good, but not something I will probably make again. I will keep looking for other shrimp recipes.

Excellent.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I used pizza sauce and it worked.  I also was out of cayenne so I used Mrs. Dash extra spicy and that gave it great flavor as well.  I made this with the pecan brown rice recipe from this site and my husband loved it.

THIS is my new favorite recipe! And really easy. I thawed some frozen shrimp, and skinned them (tails, too). I tossed these babies on the Foreman grill. 2-3 minutes later, I open the grill & my jaw dropped, they looked so good! AWESOME!! Can't wait to make 'em again! (Be sure to use the drip tray)

This shrimp was fantastic! I used extra fresh basil and garlic. You really must use fresh basil on this dish, it gives a nice flavor.  Served with basmati brown rice and "Roquefort Pear Salad" from this website.

All I can say is that this is the best shrimp I have ever tasted. Made it for my wonderful wife as a part of a Valentines Day candlelight dinner along with pork chops, and it was a real hit. The shrimp brought praises to me from a woman who is usually on the receiving end of praises from me!!! Thank you for a great dinner and for making me look like a genius by sharing this wonderful recipe!

10 Stars!!  Super!  I used thawed frozen raw easy peel shrimp, they contained salt so I'd use 1/2 the salt next time. Used dried basil, didn't have fresh. I did wind up marinating for about 4 hours while I was away from home. This will not disappoint!

This is the best marinated shrimp I have ever had!!!  You should definitely try it!  I did cut the oil down to 1 tbsp to make it healthier.  I also didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I used dry basil.  It was wonderful!  Cutting down the oil does make this recipe spicier, which is fine by me, but some people don't do spicy.  If you don't do spicy and want to cut down the oil, then cut down the cayenne too.  I can't wait to try this marinade on chicken!

I love this recipe...   I substituted Heinz Chili sauce for the tomato sauce (what I had), and balsamic instead of red wine vinegar (personal preference).  Stir fried in a grilling pan on the BBQ. Fantastic.  My guests kept coming back for more!

I made a triple batch of the marinade using white wine vinegar, dried basil, only about 3/4 of the olive oil and frozen cooked shrimp.  I sauteed it instead and added pasta.  It turned out great, next time I might use chicken and a little less olive oil.

This is a great recipe that I have made several times. I use garlic & onion powder as well as some hot sauce to kick it up a bit more. Another variation is sauteing the shrimp in the sauce, make sure not to overcook then they get a rubbery texture. A very easy and delicious recipe, thanks!

I made it for a Christmas Eve appetizer and we all thought it was O.K. but not great. The marinade tasted very similar to Catalina salad dressing except for the garlic. I think I'll try that next time. That'll not only make it quicker and easier but I can use as much of it as I would like for the marinade and still have some left for salad.

This is a wonderful way to grill shrimp.  The flavor is outstanding!  I add some Heinz Chili sauce to the recipe and it makes it even BETTER.  The fresh basil and garlic are a must... it is not the same with the dry stuff.  I've even used this to cook the shrimp indoors on a grill pan and it is still great.

This is so yummy! The first time we made it I didn't feel like it had enough flavor, so now I let it marinate for at least 5 hours and the flavor is perfect. I also doubled the marinate part for my 2 lbs of jumbo shrimp. As the description says, don't let the cayenne pepper fool you. I can taste it, but as someone who's super sensitive to spicy foods, I found it to be just the right amount.

My husband called home and announced that he was "in the mood for shrimp kabobs."  Still not entirely sure where the craving came from... but I turned to this site first.... and found that I had everything I needed for the recipe in the pantry.  It was easy to combine, no weird ingredients, and marinated quickly.  I put the shrimp on soaked bamboo skewers and alternated with lightly steamed zucchini, yellow squash, red grape tomatoes and red onion (both of those unsteamed)... and these were a hit.  They took a little longer to cook than the recipe stated... which was either the cold weather and/or my additional ingredients but I just covered the grill and that picked up the pace.  Excellent flavor.... and not spicy at all for us.  Thank you!!

Overall the family rated this 4 stars, meaning, "it's really good- make it occasionally."  That works for me!  I used 1 lb with sauce doubled. Shrimp were partially thawed, so cooked unevenly- hence most were overdone as they continued heating while waiting for others to finish.  When in the bag marinating, it does NOT look like enough, but when cooked in covered skillet, it made enough to put over rice,  Did not like it left over as it was too "fishy."  YUM!

Takes so little time and very little effort but makes a wonderfully tasty meal. A well blend of flavors that does not over power the flavor of the shrimp. Can't wait to serve this to my discriminating parents, they need to step out of the "fried" shrimp box.

This marinade is AWESOME!  I've made it twice.  I didn't use it with shrimp, I used is with tuna.  On vacation we got a couple of tuna steaks cut them in cubes, marinaded them with this marinade then grilled them (med.rare) for an appetizer.  Delicious!  I think it would be great for anything, shrimp, scallops, chicken, anything.

This was okay...i thought with the reviews it would be better. I marinated the shrimp overnight in freezer bags and grilled the following afternoon. Followed the recipe exactly as stated...maybe i did something wrong but I don't plan on making this again.

This recipe was fabulous!  The only thing I changed was to double the recipe of the marinade and add a little more garlic than it called for.  I also basted the skewers during grilling.  Fresh garlic and fresh basil is a must!

This was is the only way that I will prepare my shrimp.  Whether for a pasta dish or by itself, I will always marinade this.  I marinaded for 1.5 hours and they turned out perfect.
Note:  I didn't add salt....the tomata paste has enough.

These were yummy! Used frozen shrimp and also used 1 jalapeno for the heat. Marinated them for 5 hours. They were not spicy at all, just good flavor. I sauteed the shrimp and boiled the marinade for a few minutes, then served with the marinade poured on top. Got many compliments from my book club.

This recipe is amazing.  Me and my boyfriend LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  Only 1 complaint.  I also made this for my twin 4 year old girls and it was too spicy for them.  I followed the recipe to the T except I let the shrimp marinate for 4 hours instead of 1.  So I don't knoow if that is why it was too spicy.  I am going to make again and only let it marinate for 1 hour instead.  If that doesn't work I will just make them a seperate batch without the cayenne pepper.

Excellent recipe--needs no improvement.  My company loved it, and it was really easy to prepare.  I didn't have skewers, so just grilled it on a wok type pan.  Served it with pasta and a salad--perfect.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was great. I don't like seafood but I made this dish for my boyfriend and some friends, and they loved it. Although, instead of garlic cloves I used garlic powder & instead of the cayenne pepper, I used Tony Chachere's "Original Creole Seasoning". The recipe urned out great. I recommend it highly

I would rate this recipe a 4.5 stars.  It was good.  It didn't necessarily "wow" me, but it was tasty.  It reminded me a lot of pizza. I would definitely make it again though.

YUM! I didn't get to marinate it an hour and I used chili powder cause I didn't have cayenne pepper, but it was delicious!

I not only marinated shrimp, I also marinated chicken too.  I used seperate skewers for chicken and shrimp, as the chicken obviously needed to grill longer.  It was excellent.  My family loved it.  I currently have boneless chicken breasts in the marinate for tomorrows dinner.

Delicious and a crowd favorite every time. I have marinated a little longer than called for, and added a dash of red pepper for extra kick. Turns out perfectly every time.

I have to admit that this recipe is fantastic!!!  I can't imagine it being as good cooked any way but on the grill so I wouldn't try to saute or broil them.  It's just not the same flavor.   I usually change things up based on what I have in my kitchen...and that is one of the reasons I loved this recipe so much!!!  I had all the ingredients right at home.  I used frozed ez peel shrimp and everything else was standards in my kitchen.  Thanks!!!!  I can't wait to try this on chicken!!

We loved these, both the kids and the adults.  Lots of flavor and a little kick.  Substituted chili sauce for tomato sauce and dried basil for the fresh.  Yum.

i must admit i was doubtful that this recipe would live up to it's reviews but i was wrong. i substituted a sweet and spicy chili sauce for the tomato sauce and cooked them over a real charcoal grill. fabulous! juicy and tender and full of flavor! thanks a million for this super easy recipe.

I tried making the recipe exactly as written (with the exception of reducing the salt)but I wasn't able to get to the store for some fresh basil. Still with dried basil, this was the best marinade! My husband doesn't care for grilled shrimp as they can become chewy if over cooked but he said this was the best shrimp he has had. I think this would also be good using chicken instead of shrimp. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This turned out ok.  I was trying to use up some fresh basil and tomato, so I do agree that using the fresh ingredients is a must. I guess we're just not a basil-friendly family.

This is one of the best recipes we have had. It was excellent. As previously suggested, I used 4 very large cloves of garlic instead of 3. We also increased the basil (use only fresh basil) from 2 Tablespoons to 3 tablespoons. It was great, my 3 year old daughter who has not liked shrimp in the past ate 2 full big shrimp. My whole family loved this recipe!!!

I made a few changes and it turned out great! I used 1/2 c. diced tomatoes instead of the sauce, 1/4 sweet chili sauce (found in the asian isle) and cilantro instead of basil. I blended up all of the marinade ingredients and marinaded the shrimp for 1 hour. I made 'Tomato-Cream Sauce for Pasta" from this site along with angel hair noodles and topped it with the grilled shrimp. Will def make again. Thanks!

mmmm...how could something this easy be so good?  i marinated about 15 mins. longer than the hour stated because i lost track of time. i added probably half again the cayenne pepper called for because i like that 'edgy' kick, and it was in no way too much--had my kids been here they could and would have eaten it--but that was the only change i made.  this truly was perfection in the making as the combination of ingredients couldn't have been better...so surprisingly flavorful.

Used the marinate on shrimp as well as the steak.  Very good - hubby loved the steak especially.  Used ketchup, regular pepper and dried basil as that is what I had on hand.  Will use again for sure!  Thank you.

Any time my husband proclaims it's the best he's ever had, I know it's a winner!  Excellent marinade!  I will definitely make this again.  Only change I made was to cut back the olive oil by half.

Best Shrimp my boyfriend & I've ever had at home!  I didn't have cayenne pepper so used a little cajun spice as a subsitute, but didn't even taste it in the finished product.  I used more fresh basil & garlic than called for.

Will cook this over & over!

I'll be making this again. It was really nice. 

I did do a few things differently though, based on what was available. Instead of hot sauce and tomato paste, I threw in some spicy/peppery steak rub, and ketchup. And instead of dried oregano and fresh parsley, I used fresh oregano and fresh basil. It was still a hit!

Fabulous shrimp! If you like spicy, then increase the cayenne and/or toss in a little hot sauce. It wasn't quite spicy enough for my taste, but I was making it for some extremely tender-palated people. Next time I'm spicing it up!

I was amazed at how good this recipe was. I made it for my husband for our anniversary dinner and he couldn't get enough. He said it was even better then going out to a nice restaurant. It was easy to make as well. Absolutely the best shrimp I have ever had!

One of my favorite marinades is McCormick's Tomato, Basil Garlic and this marinade taste just like it!  I use it on chicken or shrimp kabobs with yellow squash, green bell peppers, sweet onion, mushrooms and roma tomatoes.  One of my favorite meals and it's actually healthy!

I strongly urge you to try this recipe! The flavor is outstanding! I did not change anything. I just added some onions, tomatoes, green peppers and jalapenos to the skewers and brushed them with the marinade while it was on the grill. It will be hard to eat shrimp any other way!

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it was great! I did have to make a couple of changes to it due to lack of ingredients, but it worked out well. I substituted ketchup mixed with equal water in place of the tomato sauce and I substituted dried basil for the fresh basil. If using dry, be sure to use less than what the recipe calls for since it's usually stronger in flavor.

Something I hadn't planned, but I'm glad it did was that the ketchup imparted a sweet flavor which was awesome. The shrimp had a spicy / sweet taste and I loved it. I had also only bought 8 shrimp, so I had to make much less marinade. I put a little too much of the pepper, so it was spicier than it should have been. Still very good. 

I've used Allrecipes for a while now and I had to create an account just so I could review this recipe!

This was a wonderful recipe! So easy and tasty, too. I made double the marinade, boiled it and set aside before adding the shrimp so I had something to dip the shrimp in after it was cooked. It took mere minutes to throw together and only a couple of minutes on the grill. I can't wait to make this as a quick appetizer for parties.

YUMMY!!!  This was so quick and easy.  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was wonderful.  I used jumbo pre-cooked shrimp instead of raw and it worked out just fine.  Since the shrimp were already cooked (no risk of cross contamination) I put the remainder of the marinade in a sauce pan and heated it to a boil to pour over my shrimp which I put over some rice with orzo (rice a roni garlic flavor...whole grain).  It was the perfect dish.  So, not only good, but healthy too.  Thanks for sharing this.  I'll make it over and over.

This was delicious!!!  I like shrimp, but I don't LOVE shrimp.  I made this because my husband and 6 year old son LOVE shrimp. The flavour was fantastic. I kept wanting more. I would not change a thing! Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

My whole family loved this shrimp! Right down to the 2 year old!  Very good and doesn't need dipping sauce on the side. I did leave out the cayenne for fear that the little ones would whine it was hot and not eat it but I bet it is even better with it. Thank you, I will be making it a lot!

This is an excellent recipe.  My whole family raved over it and even my small children asked for seconds.  The key really is to not over-cook the shrimp (which can be a little tricky on a grill.)  We grilled it on the lowest setting and removed the shrimp as soon as they turned pink.

This is definately a recipe you can make for company.  It is sure to impress!

I have started trying seafood within the last five years.  These are awesome I loved them.  We fixed them for a picnic and everyone loved them even the kids who a lot of them are not into trying seafood.  I give you an A+.

Very good...I would reccomend marinating for longer than 30 minutes.  Also, I think it could use a bit more Cayanne Powder.  Will also add beef and chicken next time I make this recipe!

I took others' suggestion and used fresh cilantro. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to the bold flavor I was expecting. Maybe I should have added more salt, pepper, vinegar. Overall very good though. We ate it up happily. Thanks!

Incredible. I added 1/3 of a chopped onion and doubled the cayenne pepper. They got devoured instantly.

I made a few changes, a little bit less olive oil, I used the basil, garlic, oregano tomato sauce, I added 1 tsp Worstershire sauce, 1 tsp. hot sauce to replace for cayenne pepper and I only had dried basil so I cut portion in 1/2 because dried is stronger.      I only had 1 lb shrimp so I changed the servings to 4.  Very good!

I made this same recipe years ago, and found it again today after my hubby wanted shrimp po boys like our local restaurant does them grilled. I tried this again only I baked the shrimp at 400 degrees for approximately 15 minutes. AWESOME!

I have been using this for a couple years now and love it! I have tweaked it a bit though.  Instead of basil try cilantro in the same proportions.  If you like cilantro you won't be disapointed!

Super delicious!  I also went with another reviewer's idea to marinate with a can of diced tomatoes with oregano, etc.  Threw over a bed of angel hair whole wheat pasta and there you go!

This was pretty good, we ate all of the shrimp, but nothing really outstanding to me.  I followed the recipe except for substituting dried basil for fresh.  Maybe the fresh basil would have made all of the difference.

Great flavor.  I left the shells on the shrimp - they grilled up very nice and moist.  I marinated for 30 min. will marinate for closer to an hour next time.  My 1 1/2 year old ate more than me!!

Yum.  This was fantastic.  My husband made this (that speaks volumes alone) and followed the recipe exactly.  Used Hunts tomato sauce with Basil, Garlic and Oregano.  Next time we might try it sauteed with the marinade over pasta.

I used 1 pound of shrimp, double the garlic, balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, then steamed it (instead of grilling like "Lynn S" suggested) added a can of diced tomatoes with basil, oregano, and garlic, then served it on angel hair pasta.  This was the BEST shrimp I've ever had!

I really liked the shrimp. I used ketchup and it was fine. I didn't grill the shrimp, I actually sauteyed the shrimp AND the marinade. Then I cooked some pasta and blended it all together.It was great!

We didn't care for these shrimp too much. Not much flavor.  However, I had to use Italian Stewed Tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, since I was out of it.  I wish I had thought to use ketchup like another reviewer suggested!  Who doesn't have ketchup on hand, especially if you have kids.  So I will try these again, with the ketchup, and see if my rating changes.

Wow!  This shrimp was GREAT and very easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly; marinated the shrimp for an hour) and was careful not to overcook it on the grill.  

My husband and I enjoyed the kick that the cayenne pepper added, but people who are very sensitive to spicey foods may want to take caution. I put this recipe on my "definitely make for company" list.

This is it!  I've been trying out a few bbq shrimp recipes to serve the whole family on the 4th of July, and I'm glad to say this is the one.  It was easy and very tasty.  Don't change a thing, and you'll be pleased with this recipe.

These turned out pretty well on the first try.  We added onions to the skewers as well.  Next time will up the pepper though!  Either more cayenne or some Tabasco.  Not sure how anyone would have thought these were too spicy!  Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

FANTASTIC! I marinated the shrimp overnight and cooked some on the regular grill and others on the Foreman grill. Both were amazing. Will make again - soon!

Oh wow, this was so good.  My other half even said so before I had to ask.  The only change I made in the marinade was to cut down to 1/4 c. olive oil.  I also only used one pound of shrimp, poured the remaining marinade over the skewers and popped it all under the broiler to cook.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious!  The longer you marinate the shrimp, the better they taste.  I was out of fresh basil so I subbed in two teaspoons of dried which worked just fine.

Holy wow! This is the best shrimp ever! That's all there is to say about it, why make any other kind of shrimp again? My husband uses ketchup instead of tomato sauce, but that's the only change he makes. We serve this to company for appetizers alot. You can't go wrong with this.

Excellent!  I will probably half the salt next time, as it was a tad on the salty side.  I also doubled the garlic, fresh basil, and cayenne because I really enjoy those flavors :)  It turned out great! I think the fresh basil really gives it a nice flavor.  Instead of skewering the shrimp, I simply cooked them on my George Foreman grill.  Saved a lot of time :) I will definitely be making this again!

We loved this.  We like spice, so we sprinkled with extra cayenne when grilling.

Amazing, such good stuff.  I don't usually even like shrimp all that much, but this marinade makes them so tasty.  I've made these many times now and they always turn out great...they are pretty much goof-proof.  Super easy to make and everyone gobbles them down.

I read several reviews and decided I had to try the recipe.  My boyfriend (the grillmyster) and I had a contest to see who's shrimp was the best.  He had to admit that the shrimp I made was absolutely outstanding. WOW - we both loved it! It was easy and I would recommend it to everyone who likes shrimp.

Some of the best shrimp we've ever tasted!  I used pre-cooked shrimp, marinating 8 hours and grilling 1 minute per side.  Served this with Mid-Summer Italian Bread Salad, and the flavor of the shrimp didn't get lost at all (and that salad is powerful!).

These were pretty good.  Like many others, first time grilling prawns (used instead of shrimp.)  Remember that if you are using wooden skewers, you need to soak them for about 20 minutes prior to using, so make sure to start soaking immediately after making your marinade.  I marinaded for 1.5 hours, and the taste really sank into the shrimp.  I cooked a minute or two more than called for.  Don't worry about them being too spicy- I can't handle spiciness at all, and these were fine- they were tinged with spiciness, lol.  Very quick and easy to make, and taste great.

This is my first experience grilling shrimp.  I WAY over-cooked so the shrimp came out very tough.  I see the potential in this recipe so today for Father's Day I am attempting again.  I will definitely flip the shrimp and pull off grill after only 3 minutes on each side....as suggested in the recipe.

this recipe was pretty good. definitely flavourful. though a bit too much so :) i found the marinade a bit overpowering for the shrimp. i would make this again but with less tomato sauce. i found that was the overwhelming taste. but generally a very good recipe.

The weather is dreary, so I put the entire contents into my wok and cooked the shrimp.  I put the shrimp over a lightly oiled vermicilli with the marinade as sauce and it is amazing!

This is a really great recipe!  It tastes like something from a restaurant and is so easy to make.  I usually jazz it up a bit and to make it a bit more spicy and have used dried and fresh basil, it is always good.

Made for a dinner party of important people.  Was a BIG hit!  Made the marinade the night before.  Used fresh purple basil.  Added shrimp morning of.  Later skewered 3 shrimp per skewer and grilled.  Awesome.  Served with cocktail sauce but really didn't need it.

I don't know what all the GREAT reviews were all about.  This is an okay recipe.  I am only keeping it because it is a good way to use up the extra pizza sauce from the "Personal Portobello Pizza" recipe from this site (great recipe!).  Otherwise there are a ton of other ways to make shrimp that are as good or better than this recipe.  I would not go out and buy ingredients just to make this.

Not like this one needs another review-but this was incredible.  I marinated for three hours.  I almost forgot the vinegar-probably because I despise vinegar, but added to shrimp after the rest of the ingredients.  My husband originally asked for the cocktail sauce and I told him we were out of it.  I then told him based on the reviews we didn't need it. He is not into shrimp, so he was hesitant.  After he devoured about 3 sticks-he agreed that it was perfect the way it was!  Guaranteed hit!  Thanks so much-will be served often.

WOW! This is by far the easiest and best shrimp recipe I've tried.  I followed the recipe exact and marinated for about 2 hours.  My husband cooked the shrimp over an open fire. What a wonderful flavor the marinated shrimp and oak fire created. It received the highest rating at my dinner table!!!  I've added this to my "BEST" recipe list and am planning on serving at my next party. I don't think you could be disappointed with this one. Thanks Rachel for sharing this great recipe.

The shrimp were really nummy!  Even husband who doesn't care for shrimp was fighting for more.  Also three year old really liked them and she usually likes only "plain" things!  Thanks for recipe.

This dish was absolutely wonderful!  I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!  I made an extra batch of the marinade and heated it on the stove to dip the grilled shrimp in afterwards.  Next time I think I might cut back on the salt just a bit but other than that, this was better than some of the dishes I get in the restaurants!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Made this for father's day.  I made it with some substitutions as I did not have the ingredients called for.  Used spagetti sauce and garlic vinegar, it was still very yummy.  I enjoyed it very much and it was a hit with the family.

I've made this twice - once for family and once for company. Both times turned out excellent even though I didnt have white wine vinegar (I used red wine vinegar). A couple of other tweaks I would do next time is use chile sauce in stead of just tomatoe sauce and a few drops of liquid smoke is a nice addition to an already great recipe. My 9 yr old who has never eaten shrimp, willingly, asked for a second and third bite.

My sister and I spent a cold, rainy March evening making this on the indoor grill.  I added extra garlic and it was fabulous!  I made roasted red skin potatoes, garlic bread and Caesar salad to complete the meal.  It was very easy and a good recipe to get the family involved.

I made it. Sounded too good to be true but I went with all the good reviews. They were right. Simple recipe but very tasty. I added 1/4 tsp cayenne more and also let it marinade in the refrigerator for about 3 hours. Recipe saved to my favorites and I will make it again.

Shockingly Good. Simple ingredients with an outstanding result. Followed the recipe and used Cholula for the hot sauce. Five of us loved it and I will make it again. My husband said, "Make sure you save that recipe!"  I did.

I made as written, my usual way to check a recipe, although I’ve been known to “wing it” when I just have an idea or have to make do w/ items on hand, or just flying on my own idea. This recipe got great reviews and I had all on hand so I went w/ it. Just spicy enough...our lips were buzzing just like we like. I only used 12 large shrimp, plenty for the two of us. I had to surrender what I couldn’t eat to hubby, often the case. Served with angel hair pasta, and boiled the marinade to make as sauce. YUM!! Needed more. Used more garlic (I always double the amount b/c we LOVE garlic! So I guess I did make an adjustment—-we always double the garlic, no surprise there. No leftovers but will double amount of shrimp next time. I tasted the marinade once made and I was looking forward to how that would end up. Tasted a bit vinegary, but not once cooked, yummy! Thanks for the recipe, we’ll be doing again!

I made this pretty much per the recipe except substituted ketchup for the tomato paste per one reviewer's suggestion (because I didn't have tomato paste).  My whole family loved it and asked that this dish be added to the dinner rotation!

Loved the flavor! I used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce like some reviewers suggested. Make sure your grill is Hot and you stay close by, wouldn't want to burn or dry out your shrimp. This one is a keeper.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and didn’t have tomato sauce, so I did the same as another user and substituted with ketchup. I marinated my shrimp for an hour, stirring s few times throughout the process. It had TONS of flavor. We ate by itself with guacamole and tortilla chips, would be easy to use in tacos or top a salad. Going on our favorites list for sure.

I make this shrimp at least once a month.  I use 2 pounds of shrimp, but double the recipe for the marinade (except for the cayenne).  We cook the shrimp over the stove and then remove shrimp when finished cooking and then boil the remaining marinade so we can eat.  We serve it with a side of lipton knorr's rice pilaf.  So delicious.  Fresh basil is key!

Instead of lemon zest and pepper alone, I used Lemon Pepper seasoning  and I ran out of basil, but had tomato and basil marina mix, so I used that with a little bit of Italian Seasoning.  It came out really delicious!

I was out of tomato sauce, but it still tasted amazing!  Basting the shrimp with the marinade provided a flavor boost.  I will definitely make this again.

Amazing flavor! Like others, I subbed out the tomato sauce (habenero sauce and tomato paste). Such a crowd pleaser for husband and our 3 young kids. Will definitely be making these again!

This was delicious!  I only had 1 lb of shrimp, and I would guess that the recipe as written would make a very skimpy amount of marinade for 2 lbs.  I used a whole 8oz can of tomato sauce and didn't measure the spices carefully but otherwise no material changes.  I cooked the extra marinade & served it as a sauce with the shrimp and linguini on the side.  This is a keeper!

I made this for a group of 8 people. Everyone said it was “fine” or “ok”.  I had read the other reviews so I decided to kick it up a notch and add a teaspoon of Sriracha along with extra garlic.  Even with the addition of Sriracha, people thought it was a little boring.  I may try again with chili sauce next time

Great recipe! Plenty of flavor.
Decided to do something different for memorial day BBQ.
My whole family (including my 12 year old son) love it.

This was amazing.  I love the flavor balance.  It has a little spunk but not too much and the tomato influence was a pleasant surprise.  Grilled on skewers for guests and everyone LOVED them!

It was very good, but I need to find a shrimp recipe with a little more spice to it.  I like a lot of spice, but this was very easy to make and again it was very good.

Excellent shrimp marinade. I followed the recipe, but used less than a pound of thawed shrimp with the shell on. I removed the shrimp from the pan when they were done cooking, mixed a small quantity of flour with a bit of water in small cup, and whisked it into the pan to thicken the sauce. The sauce was delicious over plain basmati rice.

I wanted to love this due to the high ratings but me and the kido didn’t care for it but my honey enjoyed it so I went with a 3. Was fun trying something new but won’t be a repeat. Thank you for the recipe.

Made this last night along with lobster tail, king crab and scallops. the flavor was amazing. I did use the recipe almost exact except for the minced garlic. I didn't use the fresh garlic but instead used the seasoning it marinated the shrimp with a better flavor I also topped it off with fresh pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper. Marinated in the refrigerator for an hour and broiled on skewers at 550. I will keep this recipe for a long time.

Giving this 5 starts because of how simple it is and because I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.  I usually leave out most of the cayenne since I have kids who can’t handle heat, but the marinade is super tasty.  As other reviewers have said, the fresh basil is essential.

Fantastic receipt.  The Cheyenne pepper gave it some nice heat and the basil, garlic, and tomato sauce gave it a great flavor.  They were scarfed down at a family bbq!

I will make it again and the only change  will make is to increase the amount of garlic.

It seemed to be lost in all the other spices.

But i won't change anything else.

I used sriracha sauce instead of tomatoes sauce. Fresh basil and garlic. I marinated hem for a little over an hour. These shrimp turned out delicious, they had just enough heat without any compromise on flavor. I grilled them and then served them with a spring mix salad and parsley potatoes. I would definitely make again.

I'll make it again. I used much less tomato sauce, and added a little Teriyaki sauce.

This was so good my toddler even ate a little. My husband was skeptical bc I never cook shrimp but he loved it too and didn’t even use any condiments!!! (He sauces everything!) I used our George Foreman - just needed like a minute to cook on there, the rest was just as stated in the recipe... for you shrimp rookies - my lesson learned - shell out the extra cash for pre shelled deveined shrimp. That’s a disgusting hour of my life that I’ll never get back.... any ways love this recipe!!!

This recipe was the first time I braved the grill  (aside from the odd wiener or frozen burger) but it looked so delicious and foolproof that I had to give it a try. SO glad I did! The recipe is easy, the shrimp was delicious and now I’m no longer afraid of the BBQ. Will definitely be making this again.

What an easy and yet amazingly delicious recipe. I prepared it yesterday with friends (only 4 of us) and we finished it all. I didn’t modify any part of the recipe but doubled it due to the container I marinated it in. Highly recommend it, even my husband who was apprehensive and enjoys just garlic and butter raves about this dish. Cheers to the recipe creator, no reason to make it any other way.

I made the changes as suggested by one of the reviewers involving canned tomatoes. Also we like spicy so I added Cajun seasoning. I will make it again.  I placed the shrimp on skewers with peppers and onions.

I thought it tasted pretty good but unfortunately my family doesn’t like basil as much as I do. Great base for some grilled shrimp though! Maybe more garlic less basil ??

Made it exactly like the recipe called for, except I doubled the marinade and held back about a third of it to baste the shrimp while cooking. Some of the best shrimp I have ever had! This will definitely be my go-to grilled shrimp recipe. Excellent!

The whole family loved this.  It was very easy.  I thought the cayenne was the perfect amount.  Rather than grilling, I threw the shrimp in my toaster over at 500 for 5 minutes on each side and served it with rice and veggies.

I followed the recipe for the marinade, but used only 1 lb of jumbo shrimp. I only had time to let it marinate for 30 minutes, but even so, my husband and I thought the flavor was great; it was just enough to set off the taste of the shrimp. I’ll definitely make again!

I have never grilled shrimp before, so I was a little nervous.  This marinade was so easy; everything I needed was in my house, so it was inexpensive.  At first I thought the ingredients were odd, but it is absolutely delicious!  There were no leftovers, it was fantastic.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Definitely making it again.

This has become one of "go to" grilled shrimp recipes.  It's  flavorful, easy and made with pantry staples.  My mod's are to cut back to a couple of tablespoons on the oil, and ketchup instead of tomato sauce.   We up the basil, garlic and add crushed red pepper to give it a bit more kick.  My husband loves these shrimp as an accompaniment to grilled steaks and it does pair nicely.

LOVE this shrimp!  The only thing I do different is sub out Thai sweet chili sauce, for the tomato sauce.  Make sure the shrimp is really dry, pat it with paper towels, when you put it in the marinade so it will soak it up and won't be over watery.

4.28.18 Wouldn’t change a thing in this recipe, IMO it was absolutely perfect!  I had my doubts about the tomato sauce in the marinade, but WOW, it just works folks.  Marinated large, beautiful Argentina Red Shrimp for an hour.  I simply can’t get enough of this Argentinian shrimp, and I live on the Gulf Coast of Florida, so if it's ever available in your area, try it.  Hubby was the grill master this evening, and he cooked them perfectly.  So simple, so flavorful, so easy, nothing but OH YEAH for this recipe.  Served with Lemon Pea Salad (with chopped mint), Muffin Tin Potatoes Gratin, both recipes from this site, and a big wedge of fresh lime for the shrimp.  Thanks for an awesome new recipe, going into my Favorites folder.

Very good! As others suggested, I added sweet chilli sauce. I used 1/2c and cooked down the extra marinade to use as a sauce.

Hands down the best shrimp dish ever imho. We saved the marinade, added a bit more Raos marinara sauce to it and heated it up. Just a little on top of the grilled shrimp over rice is just fabulous! We will be making this for an upcoming dinner party. YUM!

I discovered this recipe on this site several years ago and is one of my faves for grilled shrimp. The first time I made this I didn't have tomato sauce but did have salsa and have been doing it that way since. Love it.

Made it exactly as written and it was FABULOUS!  Served it over Mexican Rice with fruit salad.  My teenagers loved it and gobbled it up. Grilled for 3 minutes each side on wooden skewers (soaked in water for 20 minutes while shrimp was marinating).  Will definitely make it again.  Very, very easy

I always like to try a recipe first and if needed make changes the second time. I feel that making changes before you make it does not make sense to me.

This dish is just plain awesome

Amazing! I changed the recipe a bit by doubling the marinade and adding a bit more garlic and fresh basil, the result was phenomenal! The family loved it! This flavorful shrimp marinade will totally knock your socks off! Looking forward to making this again.

Made it for cocktail night with girlfriends.  Added the spicy chili sauce like another reviewer recommended.  They all loved it, even the ones who say they don't like spicy!  Perfect with anything... side salad, hearty dips, soup...

Was pretty apprehensive about the amount of oregano in it but this is really good! I did use dry parsley added some dry basil, i did use ketchup, and increased the amount as others and rice wine vinegar I also added  a few shakes of Chef Paul's seafood seasoning, the garlic cloves I used were jumbo this probably doubled the garlic called for and it TURNED OUT AWESOME!!!

I am going off my husband’s opinion as I don’t eat shrimp but It was a big hit. I used shell on frozen shrimp (all I had in the freezer) and put it on the indoor grill. He liked It as did my toddler after the shells were removed for her. Simple, fast, and good!

I use the recipe exactly as shown and it's great.  Once I accidentally used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and there was hardly any difference.  Texas Gulf Shrimp are wonderful with this recipe.

I've made it 4 times now. Yesterday I substituted the Red wine vinegar for Balsamic Vinegar.  it was the best yet. The original was amazing but the Balsamic kinda brought out a sweet edge to the Shrimp. try it both ways. You casn not go wrong with this recipe....

Did not have tomato sauce so I used tomato juice. Marinated shrimp shell on but split for about 3 hours then grilled medium direct heat. Super delicious! Served with multi colored baby potatoes and a cucumber salad. Should have made more!

I've made this several times.  Little substitute here and there based on what I have on hand - but this is my go to shrimp recipe.  Plain, in stir fry, with grits - it's all good.  THANKS to the chef for sharing.

I know people hate when others do this but I'm doing it anyway; I followed other reviewers suggestions and did a can of diced tomatoes, 3 cloves minced garlic, lots of fresh basil, and 1/4 c of sweet chili sauce. I mixed those together in a food processor and tossed in a ziplock bag and marinated the shrimp in the fridge for 1-2 hours. Then I lined a grill rack with an aluminum foil open face packet and grilled the shrimp in its marinade for like 20-25 minutes.

It was ok. The flavor was sweet but I balanced it out by serving the shrimp and its marinade over idahoan red skin parmesan and garlic potatoes.

I can't decide if I'll make it again but no one was raving or anything.

Did not care for this at all. Maybe it was the fresh basil that over powered the taste but will not make again.

Will definitely make this again! I cooked the shrimp on George foreman grill, in a saucepan I poured the rest of the marinade in with cooked brown rice and some boiled broccoli and added the shrimp again. It was great! Although next time i will probably make some extra marinade to throw in and possibly add more basil and garlic to have a stronger taste!

Delicious!  I followed AussieMom1's advice and instead of tomato sauce used an entire (12 oz??) can of diced tomatoes with onions and garlic. Followed the rest of the recipe and pulsed the ingredients in my blender.  I marinated for about  2 hours. I put the shrimp on skewers and grilled on the top rack of my gas grill. I flipped every 2 or 3 minutes - I'd say it took about 10 minutes total.  I also cooked some of the leftover marinade for dipping sauce. My family of 4 devoured a 2 lb. bag of shrimp!

Absolutely Fantastic!!! I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand, so I used a can of "petite diced tomatoes with garlic & olive oil" in its place.  I doubled the recipe and used a Vitamix to blend all of the ingredients together. I put the shrimp on the skewers and then I let it marinate overnight in a plastic Ziploc bag. 
Now,  my absolute favorite shrimp dish is the "shrimp tray" from Ports O' Call Village in San Pedro, CA and I would have to say that the flavor profile of this particular  recipe is a very close match and quite possibly, even better!

This really is the best marinade/bbq sauce for shrimp I have ever eaten. Very tasty but not over powering. I brush it on while cooking just to get more of the sauce on the shrimp.  Cooked it for my son while he was over and he even are it cold the next day. Very good.
 I marinated it for about 3 hours as we were waiting  for people to arrive one time and it didn't change  the taste so you can go a little over with out worring.

I keep coming back to this marinade. Everyone loves it - amazing how much shrimp you can eat when it's this flavorful!  Must use fresh basil and garlic. Little bites of heaven.

Really good!!! I used a little more garlic. It's true, you really don't need any sauce although I heated the leftover sauce to a boil and we used it for dipping. Will definitely make again!!!! Thank you!!

After reading the reviews, I made some changes.  I altered the amount for 3 lbs of shrimp.  I doubled the garlic, used 1/2-2/3 cup olive oil, 1/4 tall can of tomato sauce, 80% of the chili sauce jar, 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1 bunch fresh basil, 1/2 t cayenne,  salt. I pulsed it in processor.

We tried the recipe as written and thought the shrimp were good.  The next time we made it, we used El Pato brand tomato sauce (spicy Mexican tomato sauce) instead of plain tomato sauce (& doubled the amount of tomato sauce).  We also added a Tablespoon of brown sugar.  We doubled the fresh basil, and when we skewered the shrimp before grilling, we sprinkled with Creole seasoning.  Even with all of the added spice, the shrimp are still not super spicy.  The young and old gobbled them up.  This is now our go-to marinade for grilled shrimp.

I love cooking and I pride myself on the fact that I have ruined certain meals at restaurants for some of my family members. For example, my wife won't order lasagna at restaurants anymore and my wife and daughter won't order baby back ribs at restaurants anymore, because mine "are better" (their words, not mine). Many of my recipes have started out as someone else's recipe that I tweeked and/or perfected over time. However, this may be the first recipe I have ever used that I followed to the letter and I would not change a thing. I made this shrimp recipe with sides of herb & butter rice and grilled asparagus and the meal was restaurant quality. Again, I wouldn't change a thing and I definitely plan to make this again.

Quite easy and flavorful. Do not overlook or shrimp will become tough. Only substitution was chili sauce instead of tomato sauce.

Everyone in my family loves this.  Kids included.  You can make it more or less spicy by adjusting the cayenne pepper.  I have marinated it for as little as 1 hour and as much as overnight.  In both cases the shrimp turns out great.  This has become a regular menu item in our house.  YUMMY!

OMG! I made this for a dinner party and everyone said that this was the best shrimp that they ever had. I used heinze chili sauce in place of the tomato sauce. I also used white truffle oil in place of the olive oil. I marinated the shrimp for almost 2 hours. I will never make shrimp any other way. This recipe is so easy and I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to impress their guests.

I like recipes that are  easy to make with things we had on hand. Was quite tasty. Hubby said it was better than going out to eat! Also easy to adjust seasonings (garlic and hot pepper) to taste. I used a tad bit less garlic and still tasted great. Will use again.

As with most of us, I had to make a couple of changes. The main one was that I added Cajun seasoning, and chili powder to the marinade.  It made for wonderful shrimp tacos the first time, then was a great accompaniment to grilled, blackened chicken thighs over brown rice!  I'll use this regularly throughout the summer! Thanks.

Did I exactly as the recipe called for. It was wonderful!!! My son even asked for the recipe. I think I will change it up to see what a little lemon or lime or substitute cilantro  for basil would do to give in a little Latin try. But it is fabulous just the way it is!

If half stars were possible I would give this 4.5 stars. These were delicious but lacking in flavor slightly. Next time I make these I would add more garlic & fresh basil. Overall an excellent quick, easy grilled shrimp recipe.

Delish! I used balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar and it still turned out great. Do not use frozen shrimp unless it's all you can find, raw shrimp soaks in more marinade. Frozen works but it tastes about half as good. You can also use foil wraps in place of skewers, this way flipping is not required.

We used all of the ingredients for the marinade but I only had a pound of shrimp.  So, we went with that.  Oh my goodness!  It was incredible.  My daughter-in-law, who is so picky about what she eats, said that this was the best shrimp she had ever eaten.  I don't know if it was so good because we had more marinade and less shrimp or if it was just the recipe.  Needless to say, we will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Blondie!

This was so easy! I prepped this in less than 10mins and left in the frig for a few hours. The whole family loved it-even my 7yr old!! It was absolutely amazing! I was afraid of the cayenne at first but you won't even taste it. This is a new favorite in our house

This was one of the best shrimp recipes.  Did substitute catsup for tomatoe sauce.  and  added parsley and 1/2 tsp onion powder to recipe.  It was fantastic.

The only change I made to this recipe was using dried basil and garlic rather than fresh, because that's what I had on hand.  It was delicious, and I have to echo some reviewers who say don't skip the grill because the grill added wonderful flavor.  I made two pounds of  shrimp and it was gone in a flash!

Delicious!  Easy , few ingredients , taste and texture of fried without the mess or added calories. I did not make any changes with the exception of doubling the marinade reserving half for pasta as suggested by another reviewer. I did add butter to the pasta topping for thickening and to stop the oil from separating.

Excellent.  Based on reading reviews, I doubled the garlic and used Red Pepper Chili paste versus cayenne pepper.  My husband and I agree - this is the best shrimp dish we have ever had.  So easy too.

I don't even like shrimp, or seafood, but I thought this was very tasty!  I did add SLIGHTLY more garlic (around 1 extra clove) based on other's recommendations.  I could definitely taste the extra garlic, which I love - but if you prefer less garlicy taste stick with the recipe.  Very good, and very flavorful.

This recipe is simple and flavorful! I followed the recipe just as it's given and marinated the shrimp for about an hour and a half before grilling. I only had one pound of shrimp on hand so I used those with the full marinade recipe and used the leftover marinade to baste the shrimp while they were cooking. The next time I make them I may add some lemon juice for a little more tartness, but they're pretty darn good just the way the recipe calls for! This is definitely going in my dinner rotation. Thank you!

So easy, so delicious!  I make this all the time for parties and get compliments every time.

When I don't have tomato sauce, I substitute ketchup or spaghetti sauce and it's still delicious.

Simple to make. Followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing it; my family and I really enjoyed the shrimp.  The instructions where easy to follow and didn't take long. My 11 year old son is not real big on spicy foods but couldn't get enough. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Excellent! The only changes i made was to reduce the amount of olive oil to about 2 Tbsp, and used chili sauce instead of tomatoe sauce because it's what i had.

Easy recipe and great for a first time to grill shrimp. We did double the recipe for two pounds because it  simply wasn't enough.  Great thing is we keep all these ingredients with the exception of basil on hand!

Changed recipe due to ingredients on hand.  3 cloves garlic, 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/3 cup tomato passata, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, large bunch of cilantro, 1/8 tsp cayenne.  Grilled on BBQ.  Delicious!

I used dried Italian seasoning instead of the basil, and a generous pinch of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne.  To make it even easier, I poured shrimp, marinade and all into a very hot skillet and stir- fried it all until nicely colored.  YUM!

Will use bigger shrimp next time,  and less oil.  I used it on an indoor grill as it was -30 outside.   I would like to try it on the BBQ.   The hubby wanted more sauce to mix in  with his side of rice.  Very tasty  indeed. Will make again

I was worried about it taking too tomato like. But my picky boys LOVED it. I DID add the sweet chili sauce and lots of garlic and basil.  I also used 3 pounds of large raw frozen shrimp in order to feed 5 people and we had a few left over.  I marinated it for 2 hours on the counter and the shrimp still never thawed completely, which didn't matter.  I will for sure make it again but it is a bit expensive.

My husband made this for an appetizer for Thanksgiving this year.  His family is not a sea food loving family (but because of a special diet for his mom, we tried this). Everyone loved these. I don't normally like shrimp but could have kept on eating these. Very delicious. One thing, we substituted taco sauce instead of tomato sauce because that's what we had on hand.

I did not have tomato sauce on hand and used stewed tomatoes chopped. Cayenne gives nice kick. Flavorful easy recipe. So good, am trying with chicken.

I followed the recipe to the T and my husband and daughter absolutely loved it! Very pleased with the taste and it goes well with rice and salad. I grilled it on a gas BBQ on top of a tin foil instead of with skewers.

Delicious! Only thing we did differently was used garlic granules instead of chopped garlic (out of fresh garlic...facepalm!). Family loved it! Was better than from a restaurant (and cheaper!) and kids considered it a treat to have kabobs on a weekday night :-)

delicious! will make again for sure. I don't have a grill so I cooked it in a small cast iron skillet with a couple tablespoons of olive oil and served over rice. the skillet held the oil and marinade and made an awesome sauce. I highly recommend trying it this way. and when I buy a grill I'll try it out with this recipe.

This is a great shrimp recipe!!! I have made it many times. It is best to use the biggest shrimp you can afford. I have made minor adjustments over the years. I like things spicy so I add a little extra cayenne and a few squirts of Sriracha. if you don't like spicy make it exactly as the recipe is written. It is mild yet full of flavor. 
It is very important to use fresh basil. I tried dried once it was way off. If you don't have fresh basil, skip the dish. large shrimp are expensive so do it right. You will be so happy you did.

Awful. Didn't taste like shrimp anymore and texture broke down. An hour is way too long to marinate with a strong acid and I should have known better.

Very good. I only used one pound shrimp for this amount of marinade. I cut back on the cayenne and marinated about 4 hours.

loved this!!   I only had tomato paste which worked perfectly.  The paste was thinned out with the oil and vinegar and stuck to the shrimp easily.  I used dried basil and pan fried on top of the stove for a few minutes  until slightly pink.  I served it on angel hair pasta which i used the remainder of the sauce to coat the pasta.  Excellent!  The added spice from the cayenne made this a delightful dish.  I cant say enough about the great flavor in this dish.  I think the tomato paste i had on hand made all the difference for this dish.

Loved this.  I used just 1/4 cup olive oil, and added chili sauce. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used baslmic, plus a splash of white vinegar. Fresh basil is a must.
We thought the flavor was a little robust for shrimp, so we also tried it on pork tenderloin medalions. This was good too, but will put some extra on the side next time, to use as sauce.

Perfect as is!! Has excellent taste. Made it again and this time I used the same ingredients and also added some 2 tbl spoons of Heinz sweet chili sauce just to get a different type of flavor. Very good!!! Excellent as is and any modification you choose to do is in addition to this already flavorful dish.

Mostly followed the directions but I used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce. Was pleased with the outcome even with just a 30 min marinade. I added a squeeze of fresh lime juice right before serving when they came off the grill.

I didn't try this but made it for DH and kids, sans cayenne. The said they really liked it! I made enough marinade for the shrimp then made that much again to pour over pasta...not sure if I needed quite all of the 2nd batch, though...

This was a great recipe!! It was pouring rain that night so we ended up making it the oven using the broiler and it still came out great. We quadrupled the order because everyone likes shrimp and we didn't want any fights but there was still a squabble over the left overs the next day. We will be making this recipe again! :D

I wanted so badly to like this because it smelled great but none of the flavors transferred - none. I made a total of 30 shrimp and out of my portion, there were mayby 3 that had some flavor.. My husband, however, ate every one of his but didn't comment the way he usually does. That means I will make it again but I will use chili sauce instead of tomato sauce, skip the vinegar and use lemon juice, use a lot more garlic (powder?) and let it marinade longer.

Solid recipe! We didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so substituted it for equal parts tomato sauce and water. Also, rather than create skewers we just sautéed them in a frying pan. 

Not my favourite shrimp flavour, but still quite delicious and will make again.

I really like this recipe. It's very easy & quick to make. I often times have most the ingredients on hand. I used a pound of shrimp because it's just my husband and I. I used a total of 5 gloves of garlic (both of us love garlic.) I also didn't have fresh basil so I used fresh frozen basil leaves. We like using very large shrimp for this recipe, I buy ours at Sprouts. Both of us enjoyed the recipe. I will defiantly be making this again!

I made these for a graduation party/cookout. I have never shared a recipe so often or gotten so many compliments!!! Yes, it does use a small amount of tomato sauce from the big can. I measure the rest of the can into freezer bags and freeze...ready to go the next time !!

This is what shimp on the barbie should be. A flavorful marinated shrimp skewered and seared on the grill with nice garlic, tomato, basil, cayenne for a little heat, and some red wine vinegar for tang. My family loves this! We put this over pasta and serve it with a nice salad or grilled veggies. A regular at our house.

I was expecting bold flavor (I doubled the garlic, used balsamic instead of red wine vin., & marinated longer), but it was just subtle.  Will try again, and hopefully I can 'up' the star rating!  ;)

They crowds aren't lying: these are incredible. I did mine with Creole seasoning instead of the recommended salt/cayenne pepper blend, and blackened them in a cast iron skillet. They are simply out of this world. 

Another idea for these is to use them in shrimp tacos. My family has done this a few times.

Similar to other garlic shrimp recipes I've tried.  Tasty though.   Ingredient ratio was excellent.  Spice level was great. Very quick and easy.  Followed directions with two exceptions: Not  having  fresh basil on hand,  I substituted 2 tsp. dried basil, which I crushed before adding to the marinade.  Having an opened can of crushed tomatoes on hand, I substituted 1/4 cup of these for the tomato sauce.  I don't think either substitution drastically affected the taste.  I think I will make this recipe again.  I will try  substituting  chili sauce, just for a  taste comparison. I used large frozen  shrimp .  Next time  I will use  extra large or jumbo shrimp.  I think the large shrimp shrank too much while grilling. I used my indoor Jen-Air kitchen grill with excellent results.  I marinaded the shrimp for 1 hr.  Although the penetration of the marinade into the shrimp was good, I think I will lengthen the time the shrimp stays in the marinade an extra 30 mins. to 60 mins., just for some extra  flavor.

Thanks BlondiePerez for  posting this recipe.  It was fun to make and tasty to eat.

I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend loved it. Next time I will season my shrimp with salt and pepper first. I like a little more seasoning and stronger taste. It's definitely worth a second try. I also broiled these instead of putting them on the grill.

I totally bootlegged this recipe  made it too easy, but still delicious.  I got home late & had company waiting.  I didn't have time to dice & mix as planed.  So I took a can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano already added.  Mixed the red pepper into it then added the shrimp to marinate 30 minutes.  Grilled the shrimp as instructed.  Served with spicy marinara & accepted the compliment

I made this tonight and it was delicious!! Although, I used white whine vinegar because I didn't have red wine vinegar, and it still tasted great. I also don't have a grill or skewers, so just used a grill pan on the stove top. I made my own sauce out of the marinade and poured it over the shrimp and linguine. It was really good.  Simple and easy :)

Wow--this was amazing. I'm not crazy about shrimp, but my family is, so I thought I'd try this recipe and I'm so glad I did!  Everyone raved about it. I served it with Kentucky Garlic Cheese Grits, also from this site, and it wound up being an amazing combination. The only thing I would change is I'd make it spicier; this wasn't spicy at all. Next time I think I'll grill some smoked sausage to go along with it and the cheese grits--that would be perfect.

This marinade is really good. I did not have olive oil so I used coconut oil.  I also used pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper. For flavor I did add some white wine and dark amber honey.  I put all the ingredients in a pan and brought other to a boil. I believe this brings out the flavors. Then I poured it over the fresh shrimp to marinade a few hours. The flavor of the marinade is amazing....

Hardest part was peeling and deveining the shrimp.  Used balsamic vinegar (all I had on hand) and marinated over night.  Other than that followed recipe.  Very good and tasty (left overs were wonderful too!

The first shrimp I didn't even think of dipping in cocktail sauce...delicious! I wouldn't change anything except for the size of shrimp. Next time I will purchase the jumbo shrimp!

I did it exactly as the recipe indicates, and it was spectacular.  I thought the flavors were excellent, and I have nothing more to add.  This was quite the hit tonight at the BBQ with several friends.  I will make this again definitely.

Amazing and easy. My 4 year old loves shrimp and said these were her favorite so far. Rich coating, not spicy, and versatile to use in tortillas or on rice.

This was pretty good  and I WILL use this recipe again, however, next time I'll thaw the shrimp first.   A lot of liquid comes from shrimp as it thaws - it watered down the marinade quite a bit.   They tasted quite fine but I would like to have had more of the marinade stick to the shrimp.

Really good recipe.  I used another reviewers suggestion and used chili sauce in place of the tomato sauce.  Marinated for 2 hours.  Fresh basil really hit home.  Served with a rice pilaf and small salad.  This is my go to recipe for grilled shrimp.

I made some changes as another  reviewer suggested:  Instead of tomato sauce, I used  can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, along with the basil, garlic, cayenne, and some shirahcha to a blender .  I marinated the shrimp and reserved some of the sauce to dip the shrimp in because it was delicious! I served the shrimp over some rice.  My boyfriend raved about it and will definitely make this again!

Good, easy and quick recipe. You will want to buy larger shrimp for this. If they're too small they cook much too quickly, and don't have much time for the flavors to set on the grill.

Best recipe for shrimp without all the butter.  Used ketchup since I had it on hand and it worked great!  And dried basil which is another pantry staple.  Can't wait to make this again.

I really enjoyed it however  it was a bit to spicy for most and if you don't like tomatoes or tomato sauce, its not for you. Double the garlic if you like it. I grilled it with chicken, cherry tomatoes, onions, zucchini , and mushrooms on skewers. Served over rice pilaf.

Was not sure about this recipe, as it seemed it could be a bit bland (even with the cayenne), but I I used  Rao's Arabbiatta tomato sauce and added a little more cayenne pepper, and it was delicious.  As other reviewers have said, using fresh Basil is definitely key.  Making it again tonight for the 4th time.  Would like to try the chili sauce instead of the tomato, but I keep forgetting to buy it :-)

I've made this several times over the last few weeks because it was quite a hit in our house! I have learned a few things about the recipe. 1. Fresh basil rather than dried really does make a tremendous difference to me. I couldn't find fresh basil at my local store (crazy, I know!), so I substituted dried once and it wasn't as good. Also, I use chili sauce instead of tomato sauce and balsamic vinegar rather than red wine vinegar, and it turns out just as amazing. I let the shrimp marinate all day or overnight whenever possible. This is so easy and so delicious!

Wow!  Great, easy recipe!  I substituted garlic powder, dried basil and red wine (avoiding a trip to the store) and it is superb!  Served it with a salad of mixed greens, fresh fruit, chopped nuts and parmesan which was a cool, sweetie contrast to the spicy shrimp.  This is a keeper!

These were just great!  I only changed one thing and that was leaving out the cayenne pepper as we have a picky eater who dislikes spicy food.  It was an easy and wonderful dish!  The hardest part was putting them on skewers, I will probably leave them off next time and just fry them in a pan to make it easier.

These were amazing. I didn't change the recipe at all. They were also a hit with everyone and I've made them a few times now.

I had high expectations in this recipe and would love to give it 5 stars but it gets a 3 from me. Shrimp was good but it just didn't encourage me to eat seconds. I had 5 shrimp and was done. The red wine vinegar was a nice flavor but this recipe was missing something I couldn't put my finger on. I added cajun seasoning that seemed to help the flavor but wasn't enough to make me want to make this again.

This is our go-to, works great for thawing frozen fresh shrimp and marinading at the same time.

Most recently, we were out of red wine vinegar and substituted a blend of white and balsamic, this was actually a nice upgrade and we'll do that from now on.

The idea of the tomato sauce threw me off, but I decided "what the heck". I had a jar of Prego and used it for the tomato sauce.  Holy !  This is incredibly delicious.  My whole family LOVED it!

We really liked this recipe.  I was a little hesitant simply because I thought the ingredients were a strange mix but it turned out great!  Paired it with roasted new potatoes and a salad for a great meal!

Didn't have tomato sauce but substituted red chili sauce like earlier post suggested.  This was so tasty.  Boiled down the marinade with a little chicken broth and served this over zoodles with black beans and roasted corn in a bowl.  Family loved it.

i made this recipe as stated, and thought it was fabulous...no ingredient changes needed! the only thing is would do differently is marinate the shrimp for at least two hours, instead of an hour. had some cold the next day, and the flavor was even better!

I used two tablespoons of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce and let it set in the refrigerator for an hour before adding the shrimp for more flavor.

I thought this recipe was absolutely fabulous. Everyone just loved it. I made this just as the recipe called for. Do not fear the tomato sauce as it is great in this marinade. Thanks Blondie Perez, I'll be making this dish quite often.

My husband loved this recipe.  I think, however, that the next time we make it I will add a little hot sauce or seasoned salt to give it. A little more kick.

Super simple and tastes great! I added a little extra cayenne to give it a little kick. I also usually mix a little extra marinade and saute it on the stove and serve shrimp over rice with a little of the sauce over top! This recipe has become a regular meal at our house! Love it!

This was yummy!!!  I put 3 shrimp on small skewers and served as an appetizer at a BBQ.  Some people felt it was too spicy so I will probably cut the cayenne in half next time I make it.  The kids definitely thought it was too spicy.  I will definitely make it again.

I looked at AUSSIEMOM1 review and took it from there. Disclaimer: I didn't measure anything so this is all guessing. I added more basil (about 3-4 tblspns), 3 tblspns Sambal  Oelek, 1 1/2 tblspns of cayenne powder,  and 3 Thai peppers open and crushed to release the oils and the same amount of oil. I also omitted adding salt because the tomato sauce I have had plenty of sodium. Clearly,  only use this recipe if you like some heat. It doesn't come off super spicy but the heat builds as you eat. Again,  only try this recipe if you like spicy.

Made these for a family BBQ and they were a hit. I put everything in a grill safe bowl and cooked them on the grill in the marinade since there was not much excess and they turned out great without the tedium of skewering them all. Although they were a hit, I found them to be a little one note, so next time I will turn up the spices a bit.

One of the best recipes for grilled shrimp I've found so far! Have made it twice...once with fresh basil, once with dried. Fresh is definitely best, but if you're in a pinch (or just don't feel like it) use dried...the shrimp are still tasty.

Made Grilled Shrimp Kabobs for this past Memorial Day weekend. It was a BIG HIT with the family. I did tweak the recipe a tad but not too much. I added some Emeril Essence, Mrs Dash Southwest Chipotle and Classico Tomatoe & Basil sauce (didn't have tomatoe paste on hand). It was so good! I made some homemade Spicy Vegetable Rice to go along and it was delicious. I'll have to make this again. Thanks for sharing a great marinade

Just an excellent flavor. The only thing I would do differently is eliminate the 1/4 tsp of salt as the raw shrimp come in a salty brine. Make sure you rinse your shrimp under cold water. You can always add salt later to taste.

We thought this was very good. We followed the recipe exactly except we did not have fresh basil on hand so we used dried. It did end up marinating for a couple of hours. I'm wondering if it could be that much better with fresh basil... the kids did not like it (14yo and 9yo), too spicy. It wasn't too spicy for us but it was definitely spicy - I would cut down the cayenne in half if you've got whiney kids who think bell peppers are spicy o.O

Amazing.  I am not one to change the recipe but had no choice as I was out of tomato sauce so used mild salsa instead.  The rest I did exactly and they were incredible.  Cooked them over charcoal and my wife who does not care for shrimp has two and said they were very good.  I devoured the rest, and will def be throwing some more shrimp on the Barbie soon.  I couldn't resist.

This is an easy fabulous way to grill shrimp.  The marinade is easy and creates an absolutely delicious entree.  Nothing else is needed.  Served it with wild rice and green salad, magnificent!

I am not a shrimp eater but I made it for my husband who is.  I made the recipe as-written, no modifications.  He said it was very good but didn't rave about it, either.

got no complaints from 2 picky eaters. 1 does not like spice so they cayenne spooked me a bit esp. when I tasted it but then added more olive oil, vinegar & tomato sauce and it was perfect. Grilled the shrimp in a foil pan on the bbq grill and put the them on a bed of lettuce with cut up red & yellow bell peppers, sauted onions & grilled pineapple.

Very, very good, but I prefer the recipe for Grilled Marinated Shrimp by Robbie Rice.  This recipe was close, but missing a little something.  I like that this recipe uses things I almost always have on hand.  I made it as written, except that I only used 1-1/4 lb. shrimp.  It was just enough marinade for that amount.

Wow, excellent  recipe. When using 2 lbs jumbo shrimp, combined 14.5 oz petite diced tomatoes, 6 lg cloves garlic, 2 TBL each olive oil, dried basil, 4 TBL red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp cayenne. Then used immersion blender to combine and marinated for 5 hours. Can't stop thinking about how good this was! Update: sauteed unmarinated shrimp on stovetop in 2 TBL butter and used heated marinade as sauce over shrimp and angel hair. Decreased cayenne to 1/4 tsp and used frsh basil. Yum.

It was good & quick, I bought pre-skewered shrimp from the grocery store, placed in gallon ziplock bag & poured marinade in & moved the marinade around in the bag 2-3 times in an hour of marinating. Reminded me mostly of less intense cocktail shrimp which isn't a good thing, honestly.The cayenne is unnoticeable. I feel like it needed more punch. We ended up putting horseradish on each shrimp & eating that way. Good but needs improvement.

Changes:  Dash of cayenne for the heat.  Frying pan instead of grilled.  Garlic in pan instead of marinade.
We absolutely loved it.  Definitely will make again and hopefully try it grilled next time.

I'll admit that I was skeptical, because I love cocktail sauce. On this day, keep the cocktail sauce away from my shrimp!  Can't wait to do it again. 

I didn't have basil, so I'm leaving the extra star. Could it get better? If it doesn't, I will not complain.

Very nice marinade! All I did after tasting it, was add just a little ketchup.  I had frozen cooked cleaned shrimp with the tails left on and I just rinsed the frost off and then stirred them into the marinade. I had them defrost on the counter, stirring occasionally, while I made the rest of the dinner. Only needed a minute or so on the BBQ to warm up. Delish!!

I broiled since my grill was broken. Seasoning was ok, I guess. I think I realized I don't like shrimp. Rubbery snappy fish bugs.

These were fantastic. I marinated them for 2 - 3 hours in a zip lock bag in the fridge,  mixing them every time I open the refrigerator.  I used a rounded ¼ tsp. of cayenne  pepper and they had just the right zip. I forgot to add vinegar. The flavor was great. The secret is not to over grill the shrimp. Only 2 minutes on each side over medium heat. Be sure to dry the shrimp before putting them in the marinade.

Easy and fast BBQ shrimp recipe.  I added more garlic and sweet chili sauce as other reviewers suggested to enhance the flavour.  Next time, after reading this recipe more closely, I will peel the shrimp prior to threading them which should provide more sauce.  I'll make these again.

Super easy I had to make nearly 3 batches cause my sister and my boyfriend  (he hates shrimp) were eating faster than I could cook them just to try some!
Due to some IBD issues I did leave out the  Cayanne pepper. Such an amazing dish, great for the summer!

This shrimp is amazing! I don't think I have ever eaten more shrimp in one sitting in my entire life! I didn't even use fresh shrimp (they were some frozen farmed ones I keep in the freezer and wanted to clear out) and I will definitely  be making this again!

We made the recipe and we loved it... this is one of the few times I've cooked shrimp. We found fresh and large shrimp that was already de-veined which made skewering them easy. I skewered the 2lbs of shrimp first, then put the marinade on, and found out that for next time I need more marinade. Grilling them imparted a great smoky flavor.

We served it with corn on the cob and baked sweet potato fries.

OMG! This marinade is amaaaaziiiing! I was hesitant about it bcuz of the tomato sauce part...buuuut I made it exactly how it is written, let it marinade for 45 mins (stirring every 15 mins) and IT WAS SOOOO GOOD!! We grilled the shrimp in a grill pan & made veggie kabobs. Definitely a keeper & making again and AGAIN!

We loved this recipe.  I added just a bit more cayenne pepper to give it a little more zing, but even the most finicky eaters ate it all up!  I had no leftovers.  Great recipe!  I am always asked to make this.

I've made this so many times and it is always great.  Depending on my guests, I have minimized the oil and added more sauce and/or lemon juice instead.  I've also done it with more cayenne pepper for a bigger kick too.  This recipe is always my go-to appetizer.  I and everyone who has tried it, loves it!!

This was fantastic and it might be my new favorite shrimp recipe!  Used garlic powder and dried basil in place of fresh and added a few dashes of crushed red pepper flakes.  Let it marinate for about an hour then threw it on the grill using a perforated grill pan.  Squeezed a couple lemon wedges on it just before serving.  Delicious!  Next time I'll use fresh garlic and basil but I can't see how this can get any better.

Great flavor! We were a bit skeptical of the tomato sauce, but it melded with all the other flavors and made the shrimp taste wonderful.

Love this recipe!! I doubled the marinade, but kept the amount of olive oil at 1/3 cup based on other reviews saying it was too heavy on the oil. Marinated for an hour and grilled outside in a grill pan instead of using skewers. Served over rice and my husband and extremely picky sons gobbled them up. Not one shrimp of two pounds left. Will make again with more marinade so I can reserve some to pour over rice. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I wish there was a 4.5 stars... me and my husband both reaaally, really loved this dish.  I didn't make any adjusments...except for use the gorge foreman and no skewers (didn't have any).  
I added a little more cayenne to my own plate, but my husband kept it as is.  So simple and easy to make! We added some spinach rice and broiled veggies (with oregano and salt).

OMG! Amazing!!!! I felt there wasn't enough marinade so i tripled the amount and let the little guys swim in it for a few hours, buttered up my skillet , got it hot and let them fry for about 2 mins per side. This will be the new go to meal in our house. 5 Stars!

Fantastic. I tried the marinade for chicken breast pieces as well, since one of my daughters doesn't eat seafood. It was excellent on the chicken too. I stir fried both separately and put them on a fresh angel hair pasta. As for the heat, I thought it was perfect, one daughter thought it was on fire and the other said it could be hotter, haha, just shows it's a matter of preference. Oh, I took one of the reviewer's suggestions and added some stewed tomato. Loved this recipe!

I followed this recipe almost to a T.  I accidentally used 1/3 cup too much tomato sauce and it didn't matter.  They were outstanding.  .  I always wanted to learn how to make something like this and let me tell you, it was a hit.  I bought 4 pounds of shrimp and had this for our Super Bowl party.  I made jasmine white rice seasoned with adobo including pepper.   You must soak the bamboo sticks in warm water for at least an hour so they don' burn up on the grill.  

They went so fast and everybody kept coming over to me expressing how flavorful they were.  My wife invited friends over the next day and demanded I make a fresh new batch.  

Thank you so much for this simple recipe which I for sure will use at every single tailgate party.

This is the Williams-Sonoma recipe from the Grilling cookbook, I've been making it for at least 10 years now.  It is by far the best grilled shrimp around.  I usually cut the cayenne pepper by half and add some lemon juice to thin it a little.  Then I use the left over marinade to baste the shrimp after I turn them them on the grill.  These are really good either hot or cold.

Followed the recipe but added 3 tablespoons of ketchup and used 1 tsp paprika instead of cayenne, didn't have. only 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Will finish the review when done ;)     So good. served with zatarans red bean and rice and steamed broccoli. All gone :)
next time hubby doesn't want paprika too spicy  :/ I thought it was great!

Maybe the best shrimp I've ever had, but certainly best I've ever made!  Marinated them about 2 hours, maybe even better longer. Used large raw shrimp, perfect when they shrink up while grilling. I upped the garlic and the FRESH basil, and per other reviews used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce or ketchup. Not too spicy, just perfect.

Great recipe, so easy to make - whole family LOVED it. The second time I did put a smidge less cayenne in because my daughter said it was a little too spicy...

Great recipe for shrimp. Just remember to soak the skewers in water if using bamboo or wood, beforehand or they will burn and make it hard to get the shrimp off.

I marinated the shrimp by the recipe but added a few spurts of Tabasco. I also cooked it in a pan rather than on a grill and after the shrimp was cooked I put them on cooked corn tortillas and topped them with cilantro, chopped onion and lime juice. They turned out to be really awesome SHRIMP TACOS!

They were great. I used coconut oil instead of why they used and used more seasonings. Coconut oil made it sweet and savory.

Will definitely make this again, my family loved it.  I made slight changes, substituted half sweet chili sauce and ketchup for the tomato sauce, 1 tbsp. dried basil for the fresh, and added a few more cloves of garlic and 1/8 tsp. of hot "Slap Ya Mama" Cajun seasoning .  Would be excellent on chicken wings as well.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this as written with the exception of a little more garlic and I used fresh Thai basil. Then I marinated a couple pounds of Argentine Pink Shrimp tails for a few hours in it. I can't say for certain that this is the perfect recipe for Argentine Pink Shrimp but, my wife and I agree that this was the best shrimp we've ever eaten! IMPORTANT!: If you use Argentine Pink Shrimp, resist temptation and DON'T overcook!! I hope this helps. We really did enjoy this meal!!!!!!

My new favorite shrimp recipe!  I used 2 different flavored olive oils,  a tuscan herb and spicy harissa.   I made orzo with parmesan and basil (also on allrecipes.com)  to go with the shrimp.  I wish I had remembered to take a photo.  Guess I'll just have to make this meal again!

I tried this twice -once as is and once with catsup(small amount) and asian chili sauce(larger amount) instead of tomato sauce, cutting the hot sauce some and adding some cayenne. The recipe shown here gets about a 2; the modded recipe Is an easy 5. 

Sorry I don't know the exact amounts; I usually go by taste and feel rather than exact amounts. Works well if you don't stray too far.

Luckily for me, the modded recipe was done with guests, as the stock one would not have gotten rave responses.

Certainly the hot sauce you use can make a difference, but I suspected the amount of tomato sauce recommended was not a wise choice. I was worried about using catsup in it's place as I don't have a sweet tooth, but going light with it and adding asian chili sauce is amazing. I got the catsup idea from someone else, so you might want to find that review and compare.

I've made this twice, and it was absolutely delicious! The shrimp is excellent on the skewer by itself, but it's also perfect to use for making flavorful shrimp tacos with lettuce, cheese, pineapple/mango salsa, etc.

Great flavor. I've made this several times and will probably become a standard for guests.  Used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce, think this enhanced the flavor. My basil may be mellow, so added a teaspoon more, as well a a bit more salt.

my opinion....this is The Best shrimp marinade EVER!  Other than adding a pinch more cayenne (cause I like the spice), I wouldn't change a thing on this recipe.

Added just slightly more salt but they would have been perfect just the way the recipe is.  The heat from the cayenne pepper adds a very slight kick.  Will definitely make these again.

I made exactly as written and it was so good.  No need for cocktail sauce and I'm a sauce kinda gal.  I marinated mine longer than I meant to and the vinegar started cooking the shrimp a little bit so be careful with that.  So tasty.  So easy.  A winner in our house.

If I could give this 10 stars I would. Have made this  several times  and  it is ALWAYS a huge hit. Had some guests not show up last minute so I had left over shrimp. Served it cold the next night with left over marinade as a dipping sauce . I did drain the extra oil off the top before serving the sauce..EXCELLENT AND BOY DID I LOOK GOOD IN THE EYES OF MY GUESTS.

Great recipe! I followed it exactly the first time... The second time making it, I added a lot more garlic, culantro, cilantro, and less olive oil. This will be a staple in my household as everyone loved it! Thanks for sharing BlondiePerez

Excellent recipe. For those who say it's bland, it's critical that the shrimp are not wet when you put them in the marinade - it makes a huge difference in the flavor.

Trying to come up with something "different" for dinner, I came across this recipe and had all the ingredients except the skewer sticks. When I went to buy them I saw that they had ON SALE 12 oz packages of shrimp already skewered. That is MORE than enough for two of us. I halved the recipe, added a bit of Old Bay Seasoning and marinated the shrimp in its frozen state for about four hours, in my refrigerator, turning occasionally. It thawed slowly and grilled easily. We loved this SO Much I went back next day and bought two more packages of skewered shrimp for my freezer! My husband loves the idea of serving this on pasta so maybe next time I will try that.

Great recipe, definite keeper, will do again and again. The only tweaks I made, which is subjective to my family, was upped the amount of garlic and substituted cayenne with 2 tbspn srircha sauce. This is a MUST grill and we smoked cherry wood with it, which added just another demension to the flavor. This was an absolute hit.

I make this all the time.  The first time I made it I didn't have tomato sauce so I had to use a spicy cocktail sauce.  It was delicious!  I like it a bit more spicy.

Followed recipe exactly and my family loved them!  I used the 2 lb. bag of frozen, raw, deveined, peeled shrimp from Costco and and it was perfect. I marinated them for about 5 hours. We will definitely make these again!

Truly my favorite shrimp recipe ever, it was incredible for the 4th of July picnic. Don't be afraid of the cayenne, it's not hot but adds just the right hit.

Wow, seriously excellent recipe!  I used one tablespoon basalmic and one white wine vinegar because that is what I had.  I also doubled the cayenne and it had good heat but wasn't too spicy for us.  NOT tomatoey at all which is what I was afraid of from another review mentioning it but I did not detect tomato at all.  Can't wait to make this for company.

Absolutely Fantastic!  I am only giving 4 stars because I did not use tomato sauce as I had none on hand which altered the original recipe.  I used diced tomatoes instead, but other than that I followed the recipe. I heated up the marinade on the stove with the shrimp instead of grilling, added some fresh asparagus and angel hair pasta. This is definitely a keeper!  Very fresh and light.

This was a nice marinade. I used shrimp & scallops in a basket on the grill.  I served it with rice and it was very dry so, I suggest doubling the marinade and using half as the marinade and cooking down the extra portion with red wine & butter in a sauce pan as a topping.

delicious. I had spicy garlic pasta sauce which I used in place of the tomato sauce. Next time I will omit the salt altogether. Overall this will be our "go-to" shrimp recipe especially when close to the ocean for the day's catch!

This was my first time making shrimp on the barby and this recipe was perfect! No sauce needed as it was delish on it's own. I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce as that's what I had to hand.

Everyone loved it even the kids and hubby! I used ketchup instead of tomato sauce because I did not have and used much less oil and it was still amazing. I took off one star because it was a little too spicy for us so next time I make it I will lessen the cayenne pepper or omit it. Great recipe!

Doubling the sauce made WAY too much. Not a winner with my family.  Added some sweet chili sauce and made a double batch to put over rice. The sauce overpowered the shrimp   Not a terrible dish but definitely won't be making again or recommending.

I mixed up the marinade exactly as written and it was delicious.  I actually used it on pre-cooked shrimp, grilled them for just a brief minute to heat up, and my husband and I thought it gave amazing flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Five stars certainly caught my eye and I have to agree 100%. Outstanding flavor!! Did nothing different...served it over black beans and rice. Next time will try serving it over angel hair pasta as some did. I can also see it as a summer picnic dish!

I tried this last night and was thrilled with the result. I used jumbo frozen uncooked shrimp. I cooked them on skewers in a grill pan on top of the stove, which closely mimics an outdoor grill and is much easier. 

Instead of the tomato sauce, I used half cocktail sauce and half ketchup. I used less than a 1/4 cup of olive oil, 3 tbsp basil, and a generous dose of cayenne. I like things on the spicy side. My guest doesn't like things too spicy, but she said it was fine. I LOVE this recipe and it will become my new GO-TO for shrimp from now on. I'm eating it cold off the skewer as I write this and it's fabulous the day after too.

This is a great tomato based marinade for shrimp.  I substituted a 50/50 ketchup and cocktail sauce blend for the tomato sauce.  Also added oregano and dry basil to the blend.  This created an amazing taste.  I also tried this marinade on bbq chicken.  Just amazing!

This recipe was only mediocre. Didn't taste great, but wasn't bad. It kind of felt like I was marinating shrimp in tomato soup, with a couple of spices thrown in. Very bland and predictable.

When I am unable to grill this I put it in a wok and cook it and put it over a salad and use the cooked marinade as a warm dressing! Yum!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed AUSSIEMON1's recommendations and used diced tomatoes and chili sauce.  I puréed everything with the use of an immersion blender.  This shrimp is so good and tastes like something from an expensive restaurant.  I will definitely make shrimp this way again.

not as awesome as i thought it would be. needs to marinate overnight for best flavor. doubled the spices the second night, and it was slightly more flavorful. did not fulfill my palate.

This recipe is SO good! I've made these shrimp skewers three times already in about two months - they're always a bit hit and they're super easy to make. The only thing I do differently is use half a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and then I throw all the marinade ingredients into a food processor.

This was the best shrimp I have ever had.  My kids loved it too!  My daughter's friend swore she would never eat shrimp.  I got her to try a small bite and she loved it too.  I might have to make a double batch next time so I can, hopefully, have some left over for a salad the next day.

Everyone loved it! Followed the recipe ...almost...added more garlic and did not add the lemon juice to the marinade to avoid rubbery grey acid cooked shrimp...instead squeezed fresh lemon on them as they came off the grill! Delicious, easy and healthy!

divided it by 3, which was a good coating for 6oz of shrimp. Let it sit in marinade for 2 hours. Doubled the cayenne, which was just a tad too hot for my personal tastes.
Really good flavor overall. I cooked it in a Weber vegi basket over a thin layer of coals, lid on, 2:30 each side.

Love this!!! I have made this so many times since I came across the recipe. My "I don't like shrimp" child absolutely loves it and asks for it at least once a week. I follow the recipe as it is written.

This recipe is awesome! My husband wants to use it for our next party. I used ketchup instead of opening a whole can of tomato sauce like the other reviewer suggested. I also ran out of basil and used Italian seasoning instead and it still turned out really good!

This is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe, but this was so good, I had to weigh in. The only change I made was to use ketchup instead of tomato sauce. Like others, I didn't want to waste a can of sauce just for 1/4 cup as called for. This was restaurant tasting good! I can't wait to try the marinade on salmon filets on the grill. Bet it's just as good.

Tweaked this recipe a little bit. Added one teaspoon of parsley and one teaspoon of Cholula hot sauce. Changed cayenne pepper from 1/4 teaspoon to 3 teaspoons or so. Added 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and lastly squeezed in one small lemon. Marinated for 1 hour. Used uncooked jumbo shrimp on charcoal grill. Family LOVED this recipe. Made about 7 or 8 skewers full. Tasty and quick recipe. Easy to get full on before dinner so watch how many you eat!

So flippin good. Second time making this. I cut the recipe in half for 1pd of shrimp for 2 people, but kept the cayenne the same + some (We like it with some kick, but still wasn't too spicy). Tried it with ketchup just for ease and it was delish as with tomato sauce. Served over rice with veggies on the side. Will be making this again and again!

This recipe was delicious. I knew I would be short on time, so I made the marinade the night before, put the shrimp in a Ziploc bag with the marinade when I got home from work and let it set for about a half hour. I would have grilled, but it has been pouring rain all day. I didn't use the skewers, but just poured the whole thing on the broiler pan, and broiled for just about 2 -3 minutes each side. I used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce and may have gone a little heavy on the cayenne, but it was still delicious. Thank you for this! We will definitely make it again.

Made almost exactly like the recipe, except used ketchup instead of tomato sauce and only used half of that amount. Also I added just a little of garlic chili paste. Yum! We made in the oven and used the extra cooked sauce to flavor some herb rice! Healthy and will make again!

Great recipe, and easy!  Did follow a recommendation to try 1/4 Cup Sweet Chili Sauce instead of the regular tomato sauce. And, typical me, increased the cayenne to 1/2 tsp.  I served w/ Angel hair pasta.  Really good!!

Just made this tonight. Changes.. used 6 cloves of garlic 'cause we love it at my house, used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce, added 2 links of andouie sausage 'cause hubby loves it. Served it as is with baked potato and salad. Grown ups and 5 kids 2-15 loved it. This recipe is a keeper. Could have easily served over rice, just didn't have any in the pantry. :)

Excellent marinade! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used ketchup. The cayenne provided a very nice, subtle kick.

This was a great recipe.  Lots of flavor.  I didn't have skewers so I used uncooked fettuccini noodles!!  I could eat this 2-3 times a week if the price of shrimp was cut in half.  I have children that love shrimp so I could go broke real fast feeding them this.

I've always used Aussiemum1's tweaks, and it's amazing!!!  A definite fave of mine, as well as the hubs. I usually double the marinade (or halve the shrimp depending upon how many I'm cooking for) and reserve half of it to toss some angel hair pasta in. The marinade is really light and flavorful with a bit of a kick - so tasty and really simple!!!

Made this last night for dinner.  Only made 1/2 of the recipe because I only had 1 pound of shrimp (13-15 count).  Made marinade as directed, except added slightly more garlic and cayenne peppe.  Marinaded for about an hour and a half.  The shrimp had a good flavor, and went well over spaghetti. Will definitely make again.

I have cooked this recipe Many times and get nothing but compliments. I always make more then we can eat and refigerate the leftovers as this recipe is just as good w/ the shrimp being cold. All my co-workers loved them when I brought some to work.

This is the best grilled shrimp I have ever made.  Fresh basil is a must.  I used uncooked frozen shrimp thawed, large fresh peeled shrimp would make it to die for!  Cannot wait to make it again!

Wonderful recipe! It was very easy and turned out great. I added about 1 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro and substituted ketchup for the tomato paste as some other reviewers had recommended. I used fresh basil from my garden and marinated 1 lb raw jumbo shrimp for about two hours before cooking. My very picky husband has asked to have these again, so it's a keeper!

From the reviews I was expecting much more flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except for using a pound of shrimp and doubling the sauce. I marinated the shrimp in a ziplock bag for about 2 1/2 hours. I used the other half of the marinade as a sauce for the pasta. At the table, I added red pepper flakes and it really added that little extra something that I thought it needed, thanks for the recipe!

Originally gave these a lower rating because I neglected to adjust the amount of basil from 2 tbsp to 2 tsp when I used dried basil instead of fresh.  I tried again with my mistake corrected and now give them a well deserved 5 stars!

I made these today and cooked on the grill, and they were AWESOME. The marinade is sooo delicious and is simple to make, i used ketchup instead of the tomato sauce. I also let them marinate for 4 hours Everyone loved them. This recipe is a keeper. Thanks BLONDIEPEREZ

Really good, not outstanding. I used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce and doubled the garlic.

We made this for dinner tonight. I followed the recipe, after reading the reviews, I added some lime juice.  I only had about 40 minutes to marinate it.  We put the shrimp on skewers and grilled it.  They turned out really good.  I may try marinating it longer, as some reviewers mentioned, but I've got no negative comments. Tasty!

I love shrimp and have cooked it many different ways. Butter and garlic used to be my fav until I tried this. Hands down the best tasting shrimp i have made. As is, perfect.

I did not have plain tomato sauce, so I used a tomato and basil pasta sauce, which worked fine.  I also had large frozen shrimp already prepared to be grilled, and did not need skewers.  The shrimp were very tasty, and we liked the cayenne bite.

Marinated shrimp for about an hour.  Had to sub ketchup for tomato sauce because I was out.  Skewered and grilled shrimp.  Was absolutely delicious!  Slightly sweet with a little kick from cayenne. Loved it!

This marinade was so good! I didn't have any fresh basil since it's not in season yet, so I used dried basil. I can't wait until it gets warmer out because I think the fresh basil will make this even better.

This was amazing!!!!  Best shrimp!!!  The BBQ added great a great smokey flavor to it.  I used garlic paste rather than minced garlic and it was fabulous.  Thanks so much for the recipe, it was one of our Easter appetizers :)

These were delicious! They took slightly longer to cook than suggested, but they were still tender and juicy and delectable. I also made Paula Deen's cheese grits and broccoli rabe with garlic and cannellini beans and they both went perfectly with the shrimp. The shrimp were flavorful on their own but I jazzed them up a bit by serving with a sprinkle of Emeril's Essence and a wedge of lemon.

It was okay, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's flavorful without overpowering the shrimp, but it's nowhere near as good as a compound butter

I admit, shrimp has never been my favorite seafood so I don't have much to compare this to. I made this for someone else and they really liked it. I normally think of shrimp as being slightly rubbery in texture, but this recipe they came out more meaty. I really liked that. As it was cold, I threw them in the broiler. I avoided the skewers as all they do is burn in the oven. I lined a baking sheet with foil and sprayed it with PAM. I marinated 1 lb of uncooked shrimp and made 1/2 recipe. I almost forgot about them and they were in the broiler on high for 14 minutes. Although, they seemed cooked just fine. I will try this on the grill another time too, for my shrimp lover.

I had this for a gathering at my home and it was a hit. Let me tell you, I had a lot of shrimp and it went so fast. After it was gone people kept asking for more. I followed the recipe, but I had to triple up on the recipe because I had a lot of shrimp. I will sure stay with this recipe. Thanks!

These shrimp were fabulous!  I used RoTel original tomato sauce with zesty tomato and green chilies, because that's what I had and a little extra cayenne.  This didn't appear to read as though it would pair well with cocktail sauce, so I mixed 2T mayo, 2T sour cream, 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. hot sauce and 1/4 tsp. salt.  It went well with them.  My husband likes to have something to dip his seafood into!!  I think this would also be good with a squirt of lime and has anyone substituted cilantro for the basil?

I had never cooked shrimp before so was a bit nervous. The first time I over cooked it a bit, but it was still good, the next couple times it was great! Thanks

Love it.  Have used San Marzino canned tomatoes, and added just a bit more to 1/3 a cup.  Amazing and such a hit!  Thank you for a terrific recipe!

Fabulous! I did have to make one change due to not having an ingredient. I used white wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. This was a hit with my husband and I will definitely make it again.

I made them on the grill and they were great but I wanted the sauce too so I fried them in a big skillet with the sauce to dip bread in.

Tried to make as is, but had to use balsamic, and a tad more cayenne, because I will always use a tad more cayenne.  This was an excellent grilled shrimp!  Tasty and pretty. Thank you!

My wife and I thought this was a very good recipe. It had a little bit of kick which we liked. I only gave it 4 stars since I whipped it together 1/2 hour before we cooked the shrimp (and scallops). Next time I'd like to let it sit overnight for a more intense flavor.

These were AWESOME. I like spicy food, so the only change I made was I used a spicy bloody mary mix in place of the tomato sauce. (I think spicy v8 juice would also be good). Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and they were so yummy! Enjoyed by everyone!!!

Made it twice now and it is simple and fantastic. The second time I used the meat from garden tomatos and the meat from garden jalepenos (i was making salsa) then strained to get the seeds out. Added a little tomato sauce to thicken. Came out perfect with a little warm heat that jalepenos give. Great recipe for shrimp!!!

7/10 not so great, i listened to reviews and used chili sauce, but kathleen followed recipe exactly.  i didn't care for the flavor either way. try something else next time.  also, don't pack too much on the metal skewers, because they won't fit in the rack. leave an inch on the end.

great tasty recipe!  I used 2 lbs. of jumbo shrimp (8-12/lb) but doubled the amount of marinade because the original yield didnt seem like it would be enough.  Worked out great with a little extra to pour on at the end of grilling.  I also used a Farberware barbecue basket made for cooking burgers and the 2 lbs. of shrimp fit in it perfectly.

I made this with a few of the suggestions from other reviewers.  1 can of diced tomatos, extra garlic and basil, 1/4 cup of sweet chili sauce, and a couple red pepper flakes (because I didn't have cayenne). All into the food processor to chop and mix together. Then I marinated the shrimp for about 3 hours, and it was fantastic.  Stuck them on some skewers and grilled them, YUM! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Made this last nite and even my son who doesn't like seafood said to me "Mom that looks really good."  He tried it and was pleasantly surprised.  Very good.  Will make again

This has become one of our favorite marinades for summer grilling. It is absolutely dynamite on shrimp but we also love it on grilled chicken breast. This is a very easy recipe and the taste is outstanding! I didn't change a thing...and give it all 5 stars for how it is written!!

This is a keeper!  We served with a small steak (surf and turf).  Our grandson, who won't be 2 for another month, ate 2 skewers of shrimp, 4 each!  Followed the recipe exactly, only used 1 lb frozen shrimp and whole recipe marinade.  Basted shrimp with marinade while grilling.  Can't wait to do again soon.

This is delicious as is.  The flavor didn't overpower the shrimp, which is a problem I've run into in the past.  No need for me to look for a better recipe.  This one tops them all!

This is a GREAT shrimp marinade. I was getting tired of the same old lemon and oil marinades and decided on this one because of all the reviews. I glad I picked this one. I didn't change a thing and it turned out great.

This was a great recipe.  I added 1/4 cup tomato paste (because I didn't have any tomato sauce), then thinned it out with 1/4 cup pineapple juice and 3 tablespoons of tequila.  YUM

yeah, this is some pretty good stuff and what i like best is that it's so easy, not a million diffferent ingredients. i didn't have basil and for the garlic i used some minced from a jar but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. the first time i grilled some shrimp, scallop & chicken kabobs on a cedar plank . . . nice smoky flavor !  last night i grilled some bonelesss chicken breast cut into strips on kabob sticks (chix on stix ?) this time i used about 1/2 tsp. ea. of garlic powder & onion powder. again it came out excellant  ! think i'll try some filet-migon/shrimp kabobs next time for some surf & turf . . .

Awesome recipe.  Didn't have fresh basil so I used dried and it was still a great flavor.  I let the shrimp marinate longer than 1 hour and it only enhanced the flavor.

The only change i made was that i bought white shrimp that was already on a sewer because it was easier and i cooked it on the George Forman, they were pretty tasty. Not the best shrimp i ever had but there was good flavor.

So, all I had was pre-cooked shrimp but since I had company coming over, I really wanted to make these. The only change that I made was the grilling time. My husband put them on just long enough to get warm. I marinated for about an hour and I asked my guests what they thought of the dish. The one comment that I got is that it could have been a bit spicier. They suggested old bay or cayanne. I loved it so it's getting 5 stars.

The shrimp were good...not "oh, wow, these are the best shrimp I've ever put in my mouth" good, but tasty nonetheless.  I took the suggestion from another poster and only used 2 T. olive oil. I also didn't have fresh basil, so I substituted dried. I doubled the cayenne pepper, and my husband and I still felt it could have used more. 8/6/11: Made it again and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce (didn't want to open a whole can), sweet chili sauce, and dried hot peppers from the local farmer's market. Still not 5-star amazing, but really good!

This is such a good recipe.  The key to this dish is the subtlety of all of the flavors.  They mix together so well, and the cayenne pepper adds the greatest touch to it.

One of my top 10 ever! From a previous rating, I did not have red wine vinegar, but used white wine vinegar. Served over angel hair pasta with can of canned chopped tomato, garlic and Italian seasoning with a side of garlic bread. Wonderful!

I had everything on hand and decided to make these last minute.  I marinated about 45 minutes and that was plenty of time.  They were so flavorful, no dipping sauces required.  My husband grilled steaks to go with these and mentioned that we can often make a better tasting meal than going out to eat!  Uh, yea...hello!  5*

AMAZING. Hands down the best marinated shrimp I've had. I am a huge garlic fan, so I doubled the amount, and I also added almost double the cayenne since we like things spicy. I used dried basil since we didn't have fresh. These were beyond my expectations. We grilled all types of things tonight, but this was the favorite. I will definitely make this again.

Easy and delicious, my husband raved. I let the shrimp marinade for only about 30 min, then since my shrimp were smaller, I sauted them in batches so they wouldn't get soupy. Served with rice pilaf and a salad. I found the cayenne pepper a little too spicy, may cut it down a little next time. Delicious overall.

This is marvelous as a meal (which we did) or an appetizer (we took the remaining shrimp from dinner and visited freinds).  We only had dried basil, so we reduced the quantity a bit.  Didn't hurt the flavor!

This was delicious!  I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic and even forgot the garlic...next time I'll make it as written, but I can't imagine it being that much better!!

Very good!  I followed a reviewer and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce since I didn't have any.  I also doubled the basil.  I would ensure you don't marinate for over an hour as the vinegar will cook the shrimp and you'll end up with ceviche!  My guests were late and it didn't turn out as well as I think it could have but will definitely try it again!

There is nothing new for me to say except to repeat what has been written again and again.  I did nothing to change this recipe and it was the best shrimp we've ever eaten.  So very easy to make but tasted like it was purchased in a 5 star restaurant.  Excellent recipe!

Yum!  We really enjoyed this.  Very easy to make, and very flavorful.  I cooked the shrimp in my George Foreman (too cold outside) and served over spaghetti with marinara sauce.  Excellent recipe, I will definitely be making this again!

This was very good. We used frozen shrimp that was thawed. Marinated about 2 hours. You just don't want to over grill or the shrimp becomes rubbery.

Ive had this recipe saved for months and just now tried it. I cant believe I have passed this one up for so long.One of the easliest and best recipes from this site. I served it with the balsamic glazed filet from this site, but the shrimp ruled! Next time I'll try it with or in Pasta!

It's the middle of winter in Minnesota so the grill isn't an option- I sauted these on the stove, I think I over cooked the shrimp a bit but the overall flavor of this dish is excellent! I served it with rice and broccoli.

I’ve been having a craving for shrimp the past few days… and this definitely hit the spot. The only thing I did differently was double the marinade. I served this on a bed of “Curried Rice Pilaf” from this website and a side salad. My guests were pleased. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe along with flank steak and roasted garlic reds for a dinner party. Everyone commented that it was the BEST shrimp they'd ever had! I must mention...It was the frist time I'd ever made shrimp!

I halved recipe for me and hubby. Used ketchup  instead of tomato sauce and dried over fresh basil since that's what I had. Cooked on the stove using my griling skillet. We both enjoyed it. Will make again folliwing recipe and will cook on grill. I'm sure it will be even better.

Really great flavor and just a little spicy.  We really enjoyed them.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used a splash of lemon juice for some acid.

I love shrimp, and this recipe is excellent!!! I could eat this all the time. Our family also tried this marinade with fish (blue gill), and it was just as good on the fish. The fish was a lot harder to grill, so we ended up grilling it on foil. This recipe is one of my favorites. I will cook it again and again!! Thanks for the combination of excellent flavors!!!!

I first encountered this recipe for my high school's Four Seasons Catering program in my chefs class my senior year, my cooking teacher knows that I ABSOLUTELY detested shrimp and still made me cook it anyways in short all i could say was: "OH MY GOD ITS GOOD!" Since then ive made this one of my top recipes and have cooked it over 10 times already, using a little more cayenne pepper and doubling the marinade recipe! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE! since then i have been loving shrimp and open to try an even broader variety of seafood :D thanks!

Very good marinade, worked very well. My only concern, and this might have been my fault, was I was expecting a bit more spice. So if you are worried about the abundance of cayenne pepper, relax, it ends up not being spicy.

This is excellent!  (Definitely should double the recipe though for 2 pounds of shrimp.)  This is a great recipe - will definitely be making shrimp this way again.

I don't eat seafood but the wife loved them! Maybe a little more cayenne pepper but she likes it hot :) A little lemon juice on top and they're perfect.

The easiest "gourmet" dish you can make. People come over and rave about my "country ham grits and Barbq shrimp. Actually I use this recipe for the shrimp and just add a little country ham to the grits, made with fish stock instead of water. I'm such a cheater. got a cheese lover in the house, add some grated parmesan.

I had some left over pasta that I wanted to use up, but wanted to add a meat to make it a meal. I found this recipe and upped the spice and then poured the marinade and shrimp into a skillet to cook. Poured the sauce and shrimp over the pasta. My boyfriend thought it was great!

I just made this marinade and it was great! I had to use things I had on hand since I havent gone to the store this week. But I followed the recipe exact other than I sub. the tomato paste for diced fire roasted tom. and instead of cayeanne pepper I used, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (but only 1/2tsp to 1tsp) gave it amazing flavor. Blended it in my blender and it was done. thank you.

I cut the recipe in half because I wanted to make sure I like it before cleaning all the shrimp.  My boyfriend was manning the grill & decided to do a taste test.  He ate half of them before they made it inside.  They tasted great, going to clean the rest and have them again tonight, but I will do the grilling!

This is a good MILD shrimp recipe.  I can see how kids would like it. I gave it a 4 because it didn't "wow" my group of friends at a BBQ. I did follow the recipe to a T.

Besides for peeling and skewering the shrimp this was an amazingly easy recipe and it tasted awesome! My kids chowed down on it too the point that I was worried they would get sick from eating too much. My oldest is already asking when we can have it again. This is a keeper!

The marinade was perfect for giving the shrimp a little flavor but not too much as to overpower it. I have used this several times and love it.

I have made these several times and always get requests for the recipe. I double the recipe and reserve half of the marinade. I emulsify it, heat it and serve it over rice or pasta.

Absolutely wonderful!  We were still talking about it days later.  I had leftovers over a bed of romaine the next day for lunch.  They were delicious cold, too.

This was very easy and very amazing!  I'm not the best cook, so I need recipes that are fool-proof.  This fit the bill.  I took the fish basket off the hot part of the grill half way thru and poured more marinade over the shrimp to make sure they would be juicy.  I did it over the cold side of the grill so I could just burn it off, rather than dirty up the kitchen.  One word for this recipe:  YUM!!!

I'm rating this 5 stars to get your attention, because as written, I think the tomato sauce makes it a bit bland.  I was going to add Chili Sauce, as one reviewer suggested, but found that I had none on hand.  Hmm--what to use?  Well, I decided to use half ketchup and half Tiger Sauce, which you can buy in your grocery store near the hot sauces.  It's a delicious spicy/sweet sauce.  I marinated the shrimp on Saturday, and  grilled it on Monday.  Well, let me tell you, the flavor was out of this world.  I served it over "Orzo with Parmesan and Basil" from this site, and my husband and I are still talking today about what a wonderful meal we enjoyed last evening.  It truly was to die for and so delicious over the orzo, which I made exactly as the recipe is written.  Give it a try, because these shrimp truly were scrumptious!

Delicious--pleases everyone in the family, and it is so easy! I buy frozen peeled/deveined shrimp when they're on sale and with a few ubiquitous pantry items can throw together what's become the family's favorite dinner.  And in just minutes!

I'm not a shrimp person (at ALL) and I thought it was ify only b/c it didn't cut the "sea" taste enough for me.  Hubby gave it 4 stars.  He said he liked it but it wasn't WOW enough for 5.  Thanks for the recipe though!!  It'll be great for a grillin get together.

The best shrimp I have ever eaten.  Made this recipe twice and it is fabulous. Used up some fresh basil from the garden too.  The second time I made it I hade no tomato sauce, so i used a few tablesspoons of cocktail sauce and ketchup as a substitute.  Also we add a couple dashed of hot sauce in addition to red pepper flakes.  If you are a scampi fan this will knock your socks off!

I loved this recipe.  I took a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes and blended in a small handy chopper with the other ingredients instead of using the tomato sauce.  Doubled all the ingredients except the basil.  I did not use fresh basil, but it turned out excellent.  The few that were left over the next day were awesome as well that were put in the fridge.

I tripled the recipe, using 1/3 to marinade the shrimp and the other 2/3 to cook on the stove to put the sauce over pasta.  I also added pearl onions and cherry tomatoes to skewers with the shrimp to put on the pasta as well.  I added about a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce to sweeten it a bit. It was excellent.  Even my picky boyfriend loved it.

What a yummy recipe!  Made it based on what I had onhand - substituting red wine vinegar for apple cider vinegar, dried basil for fresh, and V8 for tomato sauce.  Biggest change was to cook it on the stove instead of grilling.  Even with all the changes, it was still really good (served it over egg noodles to make it go a bit further).  Even my cranky-pants husband (bad day at work) admitted that it was really good.

I made these because I was looking for recipes with fresh basil. All I can say is this is the best shrimp I have ever had! I alternated pineapple with the shrimp on the kabob and I will always do this. This is a simple healthy meal served on a bed of rice!

This is out of this world! Everytime we have used this marinate we get asked for the recipe! It is a huge hit. This is delicious. I always make the marinade the night before. I put the shrimp and marinade in a large zip lock bag over night in the fridge...it always comes out great! We have also just thrown the shrimp in a pan on the stove and on the george forman grill. It is fantastic!

This was delicious!  I think the marinade might work nicely with salmon or chicken also.  Next time I will marinate for a little longer than 1 hour though.

Update:  I have used this recipe repeatedly since my first review.  It is easy, but I ALWAYS marinate for at least 5 hours, even overnight, and it comes out great!  sometimes I don't grill them, but just saute them and they're just as delicious.

Wow.  Excellent recipe.  I used catsup instead of tomato sauce and marinated for 4 hours.  I served it as an appetizer and it was a major hit.

I tried this recipe and tasted the marinate and didn't think much of it but with all the great reviews I decided to give it a try.  I marinated the shrimp for 12 hours and cooked them over a charcoal grill.  I will have to say they were the best shrimp I ever cooked on the grill.  I made 5# for a party and they were standing in line to get more.  I did add a little extra cayenne.

This marinade made for excellent tasting shrimp. I followed recipe except used ketchup,white wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand,dry basil and "eyeballed the rest of the ingrediants. Worth the effort!

Excellent flavor!  Kids and hubby loved it.  Spicy but not too spicy.  Ingredients are things I usually have on hand.  I grilled mine on grill pan b/c I got rained out - still very good!

Very good. Did not have the WOW factor that a 5 star recipe should have, but still good and I will probably make it again. I made it exactly according to the instructions. The marinade just didn't add a lot of flavor to the shrimp.

I've made this countless times, so easy and made with ingredients usually on hand. I use ketchup instead of tomato sauce and often substitute cider vinegar when im out of red wine vinegar. You won't be disappointed!!

Perfect. Both my guests asked for the recipe. I was able to make a homemade marinade with things I had on hand. And I could doctor it by adding a little more or less of spice.

This is so good. I used ketchup instead tomato sauce and it was still good. All I had on hand was pre-cooked thawed shrimp. I marinated it then put it cold over a salad and used some of the remaining marinade as a salad dressing. It was a great summer dinner. Can't wait to try it grilled.

This recipe is amazing!  Most delicious flavor I've ever had on shrimp.  I just put all the ingredients for the marinade in my food processor whole and blended them up.  Delicious and will definitely be adding it to my favorites!

i have made this numerous times now.  it is simply the best grilled shrimp my husband and i have ever had.  Also, it is a very forgiving recipe.  i do it from memory now, not really concentrating on the measurements, and it is always wonderful.

I made this recipe for my book club meeting and it got rave reviews.  I also made this recipe by cooking it in a pan on top of the stove in the marinade.  I served it over hot white rice with a side of steamed brocolli.  My husband and son are both very picky eaters and they loved it!

Very good.  I wish that I had dried my shrimp a little better, maybe the sauce may have ended up a smidge more flavorful.  Very good tasting!

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly and grilled them up on my George Foreman grill inside. I don't like food too spicy, but this was just perfect - not really spicy but with a little kick.

Delicious and easy.  Cilantro instead of basil and ketchup instead of tomato sauce because both were on hand.  Added 1/2 t. of thai chili sauce (i love spicy).  Marinated for 1 hour - any longer would 'cook' the shrimp and make it mealy.  Great and fast on grill

We all love it! I was a little concerned about adding the cayennne with my two young kids but they didn't seem to notice it. I made the marinate the day before it was so nice to have everything ready and not have to spend hours in the kitchen.

I thought the marinade was good when I taste-tested it before pouring it over the shrimp. But after the shrimp was grilled, and I tasted the end result, I thought it was a little too salty for my tastes. And I didn't marinate it for more than an hour. My husband, on the other hand, liked it. This isn't a bad review of the recipe itself, just that I thought it was a little too salty. I followed the recipe exactly.

Out of this world!!! I could eat these every day. There is just enough kick of spice with these shrimp. Would be great on a salad, side dish or as an app. The longer you marinate the better.

Recipe is a 5 star, but I made adjustments to what I had on hand.  Sub ketchup for tomato paste and tabasco for cayenne pepper.  Marinaded for 4 hours.  Excellent!

Following advice from others, I used Chili Sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I cooked rice and folded it into some sauteed onions, yellow bell peppers, diced carrots, and celery.  Grilled the shrimp and put on top of the rice pilaf.  My husband loved it!!  Keeper!

This was heaven in a bowl and so simple to make. Can be used as a marinade for almost anything.  I suggest doubling the recipe and using the unused portion as a sauce.  Thank you blondieperez, I now have to go look up and try more of your recipes.

These were just wonderful.  Unfortunately it was raining so I ended up cooking them in a skillet, but they still tasted great.  I can't wait to try them out on the grill next time!

Really good with one modification.  I put all marinade ingredients in processor and pulsed a few times.  Initially when I tasted it seemed a little too "vinegary" so I added 2T of brown sugar to cut the tartness.  It worked really well, the family loved it.  Also used Thai chile paste to make it really spicy...

Delicious and so easy!  The only change I made was to use 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 water in place of the tomato sauce as I didn't want to open a can for a couple of tablespoons.  Didn't bother with skewers, cooked on grill in a grill stir fry pan (wok).  Will be making this alot this summer!

Fabulous!  We didn't have fresh basil so we used half the dry amount and it worked well.  We also added extra garlic since we were using minced garlic in the jar.  Highly recommended...my husband and I loved the shrimp and now have a new "regular" to our dinner menus.

These marinated shrimp are spectacular, in an understated way. Next time, I may add more cayenne pepper for more of a bite, but it will be hard to improve on the basic recipe. My wife and I both loved them.

I put all the ingredients in a small food processor and blend together. Then in to a gallon freezer zip lock to marinate. Best cooked on the grill. Unbelievable.

Wow is there something wrong with me?  everyones rating is 5 stars and here I am rating it at 3.... :(  Sorry but for 4-5 stars it should be excellent-amazing and this just didnt do it for me and my family.  It is Average, nothing amazing.  I need to tweak it to be amazing and thats what reviewers did.  I am rating this by the recipe on the site, not including the suggestions in the reviews because if I did that, I wouldnt be rating the recipe.

These were great.  I followed the recipe's measurements exactly.  I was planning on grilling them on the bbq until we got snow in March, so I ended up warming them up on a grill pan on the stove top.  I bought the cooked shrimp, so I just warmed them up on the grill pan and drizzled the shrimps with the juices that let out on the pan.  I also sprinkled a little hot pepper on them and paired them with mexican rice and a salad.  Delicious!

This recipe lives up to all five stars.  We had it on shrimp on the grill and both me and my husband didn't want to stop eating.  I did have to use chili seasoning instead of cayenne as I was out of cayenne.  Absolutely wonderful, can't wait to make it again!

This recipe is amazing. I made it the other night for my entire family and boyfriend and everyone was delighted. The only change I made was to use cilantro instead of parsley in the marinade. It gives the shrimp more flavor, especially after basting them in the leftover marinade.

Oh My Goodness! This shrimp was the best I've ever tasted. I hate seafood but fell in love with this recipe and ate a good share of them. I made a bunch for my whole family for an appetizer for Christmas this year and they were gone within 10 minutes. Everyone was raving and requested I make these everytime I come over.

One of our new favorites...either alongside steak for surf-and-turf or as an appetizer. It is always a hit whenever I serve it at a dinner party. I followed several reviewers recommendations and increased the garlic to 5 cloves, basil to 3 tablespoons and cayenne pepper to 1/3 teaspoon. We will be making this for years to come. Thank you for the great submission.

Amazing shrimp! Much better than what you can eat out and just as easy. I actually tripled the amount of cayenne pepper because we love spice and it was perfect. Will definitely make again.

Oh My Gosh!  This is the best marinade!  I was quite apprehensive at first because the ingredients just sounded too weird to be good for shirmp but I followed the recipe and just added a heaping teaspoon of brown sugar, blended it all in my food processor and marinaded the shrimp.  Delicious!  It's definitely a keeper.

I made this the first time for a family get together and it was a total hit.  The shrimp flew off the plate!  I have made this several times since and every time it is loved.  I also use the marinade with just a pinch of cayenne pepper for a slightly different taste.  I will sometimes saute the shrimp in a pan and throw it over pasta.  The marinade is delicious and can be adjusted slightly to compliment various types of meals.

Delicious! I would've never thought of this ingredient combo.  I used regular vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I will make this meal again.

Really good taste but the pepper was stronger than I expected. Next time I will either reduce the amount or cut it all in all.

I made this recipe on Thursday night and found myself making it again Sunday night.  My family loved and none of my 4 little boys complained about the pepper and they're wimps when it comes to anything with a little kick behind it.  I paired this with steak and a baked potato and my husband said it felt like he was eating at Black Angus resteraunt.  This is a MUST HAVE recipe!

This is a really good, easy recipe. I did not bother with putting the prawns onto skewers. Instead, after the prawns marinated I put them into a frying pan and cooked them on the stove top in the marinade.

These were great.  I was a little worried that the tomato sauce would overpower the shrimp but it turned out great.  I served these on top of a salad for a light summer meal.  Delicious!

I use 3-4 fresh Roma tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce. I also don't bother pre-chopping. I just throw the marinade ingredients in the food processor and puree away. I have made this two times now and both times received great reviews on both presentation and taste. Oh - don't forget to soak your bamboo skewers before grilling.

Everyone loved this recipe.  Ended up marinating 2 hours because guests showed up late.  We like things spicy so I doubled the garlic and cayenne and added red pepper flakes.  I also put in some chili sauce and diced tomatoes with chilis.  We put a chipotle bbq sauce on half the shrimp and those were a huge hit.  Impressive and easy recipe!

This has quickly become one of my favorites this summer. Made it MANY times, always wonderful. The recipe is easy and very forgiving - you can use what you have. For the tomato sauce I use leftover marinara or ketchup. I use 1T red wine vinegar and 1T lemon juice. For the basil you can sub 1t. dried basil, and I use red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. This is SO GOOD! Thank you for the recipe!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I prepped everything the night before so that I could spend time with my guest rather than cooking so it marinated over night.  It was absolutely fantastic and oh so simple.  I didn't change a thing.

Yum! Let this marinate for a couple of hours for even more flavor.  I sometimes cook the shrimp in the marinade on the stovetop and pour it over pasta.

I used one package of thawed, medium shrimp.  Cooked it on the stove top and turned out just fine.  Served on top of a bed of rice.

Great Recipe! The only change I recommend is 1/2 teaspoon salt or omit the salt all together as well as the parsley, but my husband and I are not fans of parsley. Thanks for the recipe I'm going to make it again this week to snack on, great high protein low fat snack!

I've made this twice and it has been a hit both times. The second time I doubled the marinade and soaked them overnight. My husband said (I don't eat seafood) the flavor was even more awesome that way.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I followed the directions to a tee even using the cayenne pepper (which I was very concerned about) and it was perfect!My husband and kids all ate it up.  I can't wait to make it again.

These were good, but I was expecting more from all the reviews I read.  I didn't grill them, but saute them because it was storming.  That grilled flavor may be essential.

Fantastic! Definitely give the shrimp at least an hour to marinate. These were amazing. My fiance grilled them to perfection (a little crispy), and three of us plowed through those 2 pounds! Delicous... I can't wait to make this again. This is a great summer recipe to make and enjoy outside.

This quickly became my husband's favorite thing to grill...we've had it 3 of the last 4 weekends and he can't get enough.  We double or triple the cayenne but you can't really go wrong.  SO easy and so yummy.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I actually had to prepare these two different ways: grilled and broiled.  I didn't have enough skewers soaking to accommodate all of the shrimp so I ended up broiling about 1/2 lb.  I have to admit, if you can grill these the taste is much different and much better than if you prepare them another way.  I doubled the entire recipe so I would have enough marinade to baste the shrimp while they were cooking.  I marinated them for about an hour and my husband grilled them for about 4 minutes per side.  Very nice.  I served with grilled veggie packets and grilled baked potatoes.

We should have made a double batch because everybody wanted more of them. My daughter (21) proclaimed that this was the best grilled shrimp she had ever eaten and she does like her shrimp.She said it beats all restaurant shrimp hands down. It was very tasty and not hot at all even though there is cayenne in it. The shrimp looked beautiful and tasted even better.

So good I can't wait to make these again. When I prepared the marinade I discovered I had no tomato sauce on hand so I had to use chili sauce instead. The combination of sweet and spicy was just right.

i have found my staple grilled shrimp marinade...this is fantastic...left overs (if any) make great additions to a tossed salad...i used about 3T of sun dried tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce just because i had it on hand

I used ketchup instead of sauce and red pepper flakes in stead of cayenne and they came out great. The longer you marinade it the better it is. Great flavor. Thanks!

We made this shrimp on the grill tonight.  It was awesome.  We served it with angel hair pasta (tossed with EVOO and parmesean) and grilled corn on the cob.  Quick, easy and equivelant to restaurant quality!! Kids even loved it!!

Shrimp is a family favorite in my house.  Therefore, I am always looking for new recipes to try.  This recipe sounded so great that I couldn't wait to try it. It was good but not great.

This is an awesome recipe! Easy to make, delicious! The cayenne scared me at first because my family does not like spicy foods (I love them) but it just ads a little kick and is not too spicy. I'll prepare this dish often!

I use a bit more garlic and from the jar seems to work fine.  Marinate in a bowl prior to putting on stick and the flavors turn out a bit more even.  Probably won't try other shrimp marinates since this is loved by everyone!

This is EXCELLENT!  Adds a wonderful flavor to grilled shrimp.  Instead of tomato sauce I used ketchup and added some chili sauce.  I used less oil (about 2 tablespoons) and the consistency was very good.  I did not have red wine vinegar -- I used white wine vinegar and it was very good.  It had the "kick" my husband loves.

I've made this recipe twice now, once with tomato sauce and next with ketchup as a few other reviewers suggested.  I'd have to say that I liked the original version with the tomato sauce much better.  The ketchup made it a little too sweet for me, and killed the cayenne (which I love!)

This was an awesome and easy recipe, I did modify it according to one review. Rather than using tomato sauce i used diced tomatos and added the sweet chile sauce, it turned out great! Next time I'll double the amount of shrimp, they were gone in no time...... thanks for sharing

Was looking for a quick way to prepare shrimp for the grill with ingredients that I had on hand.  These turned out perfect!  Family loved them....it was "every man for himself" when I put them on the table!  Think that this recipe would also go good on scallops and tuna steak.

I will try to explain.  My wife loves seafood...when it doesn't taste fishy.  We tried this shrimp marinade and we both loved it.  Like another reader said, "this is just as good, if not better, than shrimp in a restaurant".  Can't wait to try it again!

This was really good.  My 6 year old with a very picky palette loved them.  My husband and I enjoy spicy foods so I add a little extra cayenne and some cumin.

Made this for Memorial Day, used ketchup instead of tomato sauce, dried basil and added some lemon juice.  This made enough for 1 pound of tiger prawns on skewers, deveined with shell ON. Juicy!! Used the extra marinade for basting and they were excellent!! This is a keeper.

"This shrimp is the s#it!" was the review of everyone who ate it last night. I don't even eat shrimp, but this smelled so good while I was putting it on the barbecue! I even had people stealing it off of one another's plates! I will make this again--I wish I could give it more stars!

This was very tasty though next time I might add a bit more cayenne pepper to add a bit more spice to it.  My kids loved them and so did my husband.  Very easy to make.  Will definitely do again.
Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Had to modify slightly b/c of what I had on hand.  Used 1 teaspoon dried basil instead of fresh, heinz chilli sauce instead of tomato sauce, added a touch of onion and garlic salt and marinated for about an hour.  It was delicious even with my changes!  My hubby and his friend ate every one in no time.  I served with pasta salad and potato wedges on the patio.  Perfect meal to start off the grilling season!

Made it last night with the ketchup and sweet chili sauce as another member recommended.  Everyone was amazed!  They are still talking about it.  I think this will probably be made weekly at my house now.  Thanks!

My family loves this dish.  I took someone else's suggestion and used ketchup- always on hand. :) Tastes great!  The basil is really key in this one.  I have also tossed this in a skillet on the stove top, rather than grill it.

Wonderful on shrimp or pork.  I've been asked for the recipe many times. I like to mix up the marinade, put it on a pork shoulder or butt, then freeze it.  That way it's ready when we are.

This is my favorite recipe ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really can't understand how some people said this was bland. The flavors blend perfectly and are better than any shrimp I've ever had at a restaurant. We make this every two weeks and I would never dream of changing anything about this recipe and that's amazing coming from me because I tweek almost every recipe I get! We serve this with Guy Fieri's Bloody Mary flank steak and his Bomb Bakers ( baked potatoes that have been brined before they're baked and served with horseradish cream sauce), and asparagus with a balsalmic reduction. This has been on our Sunday dinner menu twice a month for 2 years now.The cayenne gives just the right kick. I will eat them until they are gone-no matter how many I make. I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! Simplicity at its best! Thank you!This is also on my birthday dinner menu!

Very tasty recipe. I don't think that I would change a thing about this one. Cooked these on my outdoor grill on skewers and they really had a lot of flavor.

This was amazing!!!  Followed ingredients to a T - didn't have skewers so I placed the shrimp in a metal basket and placed on the grill.  My husband usually doesn't eat shrimp unless it's dipped in butter.  He loved this and didn't dip once!

This is like nothing I've tasted before.  Most grilled shrimp tastes like, well, grilled shrimp.  Not this one.  No one can ever figure out the secret ingredient...tomato sauce.  YUMMY!  PS.  I don't even really like shrimp.  :0)

I must have done something wrong because my shrimp did not turn out as good as I had anticipated.  Maybe all of the excellent reviews lead me to expect too much.

This was a nice change of pace for grilling shrimp.  I marinated mine for a few hours and only had 2 cloves of garlic and it was great.  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand(go figure) so I used 1/2 a can off diced tomatoes and put all the ingredients in a blender and pulsed alittle.   Will make again.

I don't know why this didn't taste great to me.  I did make the recipe just the way it was written except I used white wine vinegar instead of red, since I was out of red.  I used fresh shrimp and indoor grill.  Do you think the vinegar would make that much of a difference?

i thought this would taste better given the rating.  i followed the recipe to a T but in my opinion the tomato sauced completely covered the delicate shrimp flavor. not a bad recipe but just not that great.  i probably won't do this one again - just not my thing.  thank you for the recipe though!

My husband gave it a ten and then a minute later said it had to be more. He loves spicy shrimp...doubled the cayenne; made sauce out of the remaining in can (plus one more)per previous rater and served over whole wheat spaghetti. Used 2 lb of large shrimp and grilled in baskets--took longer because they were stacked next to each other. Leftovers were just as delish. A keeper for sure!

This is, indeed, an extremely good yet simple recipe.  It tastes absolutely great!  I fixed with white shrimp (41-50 count).  The recipe is so simple, one can add or subtract easily.  I fixed 2 servings (.6 pounds) (for one person) so cut the recipe by 1/3 and make sure there was enough marinade to cover the shrimp in a re-sealable plastic bag.  I did not change anything except I didn’t have any tomato sauce so I used 2 teas of ketchup and 2 teas of medium salsa.  I marinated for about 4 hours.  I will have this again and make a change or two.

WOW! This is the best grilled shrimp recipe I have ever tried and it's really simple. My husband and I liked it so much I've made it twice this week!  I followed the recipe exactly and used our charcoal grill which added great flavor. Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

These were so delicious! I really enjoyed them. My only tips would be to add a little extra tomato sauce and extra basil. Also, this recipe was perfect for 1 lb. of shrimp. YUMMY!!!! I was so impressed

This is a great recipe, however, I do think the flavors would develop more if marinated  overnight.  This is a mild recipe, so if you like more spice, add some fresh red chilli.

This the best recipe to date that I have made from all recipes.
I love shrimp so that might be why. I made the grilled shrimp for Christmas dinner with my George Foreman Grill. And served the skewers placed over whole grain Rice-Roni. They looked beautiful together. Rice has a reddish color and the shrimp was reddish. It was only thing I served that went the faster with nothing left over. Don't change a thing!!!

While this isn't my favorite shrimp recipe, it is one I will make again.  I didn't change anything with it, and I even tried it once in the skillet, which came out okay but was missing that smoke flavor from the BBQ.

I used Hienz ketchup because we didn't have tomato sauce on hand. I liked this a lot. My husband said it was good, worth 4 stars nothing wonderful.

Good recipe for shrimp. Easy, tasty, healthy Not the greatest dish that I ever ate, but good and definitley a keeper. It is worth it to buy the jumbo shrimp or colossal shrimp. We had this with grilled asparagas and salad.

This is by far one of our favorite meals.  We have it at least twice a month.  It's easy and tastes so good.  I love it with steamed broccoli and wild rice.

We loved it! The shrimp only marinated for 30 minutes. Which left it with an awesome flavor but I will do the full amount next time. We cooked for 3-4 minutes each side. It was definately done. Even our kids liked it. This goes in our favorites!

This was a surprise hit for us. Usually, I only like shrimp with butter & garlic (no cocktail sauce). This is a nice light flavor added to this shrimp. I followed the recipe with one alteration- instead of tomato sauce, I used salsa (thin, taco sauce style out of the jar) Will definately make this again!

I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting ketchup for the tomato sauce. I have made this twice and both times my husband & I loved the flavor of the shrimp! It was the best! I gave the recipe to my daughter and she & her husband also enjoyed it very much. 
Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This was awesome!  I made the shrimp as indicated and then made a sauce to accompany it with some penne noodles.  I sauteed the garlic and part of an onion in oil, then added a bit of roasted red pepper, salt, pepper, cayenne, basil, and red wine vinegar and then took the remainder of the open can of sauce, plus 1 more.  I mixed it all together with some parmeson on top and it was awesome.

Yum!  I usually don't try new recipes on guests, but an old friend was coming over for dinner, and this looked quick and easy.  And it was!  I served it with rice and a salad. And so tastey, will definitely make again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this recipe! Not only was it easy, it was fast and looks beautiful. Next time I'm going to try ketchup like others have suggested to see if I like that better. I also will use slightly less cayenne. Excellent flavor!  I'll make this one for company.

these were good but by no means spectacular. we enjoyed them, but only made this recipe when we discovered we had forgotten to buy key ingrediants to make the "other" shrimp... tasty with a nice kick, but not memorable enough to make over and over.

Awesome! I also used ketchup instead of tomatoe sauce but followed everything else and we loved it.  I only marinated for 15 min before puttin on the charcoal grill...the sauce cooks right into the shrimp.  It was moist and flavorful - I'll make this often.

Great recipe!! Prepared ingredients just as directed, and wouldn't change a thing! Only thing done differently was the grilling method - used our veggie/fish tray instead of the skewers. An absolute keeper for our family!!

Wow!!  Our new favorite shrimp recipe.  Very flexible recipe.  You can marinate for 2 hours or 24 hours.  Substitutions work well.  Stir fry sauce can be used in place of Hoisin Sauce.  Just come as close as you can and it tastes wonderful.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Turned out great. We had to tweak the recipe a little to what we had on hand. Instead of the vinegar, we used a bit of pomegranate vinegar and some red wine. I used dried basil because I had a ton of it around. Otherwise, we followed the instructions. We served it with a southwestern salad with grilled corn and garlic bread. The family won't stop talking about it!

I added Old Bay seasoning instead of salt because I live in  Baltimore and that's what we do. It is DELICIOUS! I have this as my favorite grilled shrimp recipe.

Awesome!!!  A hit at our party last night.  It tasted as good as a shrimp dish at a nice restaurant.  I did not change anything in the recipe, except I portioned it up for 5 lbs of shrimp.  We bought the largest shrimp available at a local seafood market and they came out the perfect size once cooked.  I can't wait to make this again, I am actually craving some of the shrimp now!

I make this alot, double the marinade and toss with pasta.  Instead of the tomato sauce I use 2 1/2 Tbls of tomato paste, the marinade sticks to the shrimp better.

These shrimp had very good flavor. I used frozen shrimp that were too small, splurge and buy the larger shrimp. I also made an angelhair pasta to toss the extra marinade in and it had great flavor - just was not the right consistency. I should have made another sauce for the pasta, or just served atop a salad. So none of this is the recipes fault, just mine. All the same, it was a good dinner, just not what I would classify as "the best" - thus the 4 stars!

This was perfect. I marinaded for about 3 hours and tossed on the grill. Delicious flavour and the cayenne added a nice zip without being too hot. Definitley something I will make again.

After eating the leftovers, I now want to go buy more shrimp to make again. Was amazing on top of a salad!

Wonderful!  Didn't make any changes, and loved it.  The seasoning is just enough to give it interest, but not so strong that it overpowers the shrimp.  Will definitely make again, probably for company.

I need to say first of all that I marinated and grilled the shrimp in the shell. I think they retain their flavor and juiciness better this way. However, that may be why this dish didn't overwhelm me. I prefer to brine my shrimp in a salt, brown sugar and Old Bay Seasoning mixture, but I wanted to try something different.

Wow, this shrimp was great!!  I made it for a big family dinner, used three pounds of shrimp and adjusted the ingredients accordingly.  Everyone loved it, even the kids.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We had some leftover shrimp that my husband cut up and, along with some halved grape tomatoes, made into an omelette.  Sounds strange, but it was sooooo good, even my three year old devoured it.  This recipe is a keeper, we'll make it again for sure.

I wasn't that excited about this marinade. I ended up adding extra red wine vinegar to dull the taste of the tamato sauce. I wouldn't make this again. I really didn't think the tomato sauce and red wine vinegar went good together.

I love seafood;  After trying this recipe I would have to say this is my new favorite way to prepare shrimp.  I used dried basil from Penzey's Spices (2 tsp).  My kids liked having their meal on a skewer! I can't wait to prepare this as an appetizer for our next get-together.

My bf raved over this recipe. He's a seafood lover and I'm not but even I have to admit, these were wonderful. I doubled the marinade, using basil, garlic and oregano tomato sauce. No fresh basil in the house so I added 1/2 Tbs of dried basil instead. I was leary of the marinade taste so I made alfredo with the pasta instead of heating the sauce for a topper.. sure wish I'd believed the reviews and stuck with the marinade to top the pasta. Oh well.. next time! Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly except doubled the marinade and used dry basil.  Then I put them on the stove top to cook.  We served this over noodles.  So good!  I will definitely make this again!

I thought this smelled better than it tasted. It was good, just not as good as I thought it would be. I might make it again, but next time I would add some other veggies to the skewers.

Nothing special. The merinade didn't seem to take to the shrimp that well, in that they didn't seem to retain any of the flavor of the mainade.

Delicious and very easy!  The sauce carmelizes nicely, so it sticks to the shrimp and not the grill.

I made this for a date over the weekend.  He had nothing but great things to say.  Recipes is easy and very taste.  I did not have tomato sauce so I mixed tomato paste with some water and used white vinegar instead.  This is a must make recipes.  And to top it all off he asked me out again! :)

Used the recipe "as is" except for using 1 T of dried basil because I did not have fresh.  These shrimp were delicious and the 2 pounds barely fed my family of 5.  The kids gobbled them up - the 1/4 tsp of cayenne in the marinade does not make them "spicy" at all.  Will definitely be making  these again.  Quick and delicious!

Delicious!  I didn't have fresh basil on hand so I substituted 2 tsp dried basil, and the shrimp were very good.  My 3-year-old daughter also liked the shrimp, although I didn't use the full 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I only used 1/8 tsp.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was an excellent recipe!  I altered the ingredients and added jalepano peppers, crushed red pepper, and hot sauce to really spice it up.  Lastly, I substituded tomato soup for tomato sauce.  It was a quick and easy spicy meal... great!

I made this over the weekend. I left it in the fridge for almost 2 hours (not on purpose) but it was still delicous. We could not stop eat them. Next time i'll have to make more. Thank you so much.

AWESOME! AWESOME!  I follow the recipe to a tee, maybe add a little more cayenne pepper other than that, it's perfect.  My husband who used to only eat his shrimp fried now chooses this over any other shrimp.  Even the kids like it!

Awesome recipe--so simple and yet so good.  Our kids wouldn't eat it, but this is one time when my husband and I didn't care--it just made more for us! :-)  I used dried basil instead of fresh and it was still good.

This is my absolute favorite grilled shrimp recipe. It is delicious and so easy to prepare. I agree that is is so good, no sauce is needed. I made this for company and it got rave reviews. Highly recommended!

Fantastic recipe and I wouldn't change a thing.  Had to used dried basil, but can't wait till the garden comes in so I can try with the fresh stuff.

Agree with a previous reviewer - goes great over pasta that has been cooked al dente and then tossed with "fresh" marinade (new batch - not used to marinate the shrimp.)

Very good.  Made with steaks on the grill and enjoyed by all.  I was worried at first about the tomato sauce but we did not think that it was overwhelming at all.  Thanks Rachel

Excellent recipe! It's true ... no cocktail sauce is needed. Definately a keeper!

Wonderful, wonderful recipe.  I didn't change a thing -- except I marinaded all day because I had the time.  I don't think it would have made a bit of difference though -- the recipe is wonderful!  I agree with other reviewers -- don't live out the cayenne pepper.

This is one of the best recipes I have tried on this site!  It is already on the menu for next week.  Left out the red wine vinegar and made on top of the stove since it is below 0 outside.  Served with brown rice and carrots.  Delicious!

This has become a family favorite. Even my daughters love it, and they usually hate seafood.  I make the recipe exactly as written, and it turns out great everytime.

We were skeptical because the ingredients weren't like any we usually use.  The smell was also off-putting.  But we are game for anything.  We were glad we tried it!  Thought this was some of the best shrimp we'd ever had. Will be making this again for sure!!!

Made this the other day as a side to a steak dinner.  Unfortunately, I used a George Forman grill - which is probably why they came out just okay.  I liked the basil flavor!!

This was quite nice, will make again.  However, I'll cut back a bit on the salt ... a little to salty for our tastes.

I found this to be good but not great.  I omitted the salt, and used leftover pizza sauce instead of opening a can for 2 Tbsp. of tomato sauce.  I also marinated overnight, since it seems to really punch up the flavor levels.  I liked it, and would make it again, but it's not my favorite marinated shrimp recipe.
