This recipe isn't all what I expected. Try the recipe with the name Pan Dulces, that one is definitely way better.

I have been searching for this recipe. There is a trick to keeping the dough soft...(dont over knead it) I had used it for my family for years. It actually comes out like fresh pan dulce from the mexican markets. Just need to add a lil love to it to perfect it. It isnt too sweet... afterall it isn't a doughnut that you are making nor is it like American sweetbread. But if you are looking for an authentic tasting pan dulce this one is it. Happy baking.

This wasn't the recipe I was looking for I thought it would be better.  The dough seemed a little to hard to work with and not much flavor. Maybe I didn't make it correctly, but it sure was a mistake either way.

This turned out great.  My family loved them.  They do take time and you have to put an effort forth for them to turn out well.

These are amazing! With a little effort, they come out perfectly.  I've been making these for my Spanish class and they're a hit!

I love the chocolate ones. Growing up my mom would make them once a year. This recipe is found in the the Sunset Mexican Cook Book published in the 70's. If using a bread machine try 4 1/4 - 4 1/2 cups of flour instead.

I wouldn't make these again at all. I don't know if the instructions weren't very clear or what happened. I followed the directions to the T and it was just not happening. I bake breads and cinnamon buns all the time so I thought this would be a breeze. I was wrong.
