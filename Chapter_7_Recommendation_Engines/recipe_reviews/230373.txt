I used pecans in this salad instead of walnuts. This also makes an excellent frozen pie--just prepare two graham cracker crusts and pour the salad into the crusts, smooth with a spatula, then freeze. This is one of my favorite "fluffy" salad recipes.

My family calls this "Pink Stuff".  We make it without coconut. (Don't tell my husband because he LOVES coconut!)

This is so great!  I loved it and it was just so amazing.  Some people said it was too sweet, but that's their fault that they think that.  My dad bought all of the ingredients and stated that they were costly, but I will still be making it again.

Unfortunately I did not like this recipe. It had a metal can taste from the sweetened condensed milk & cherry filling. I liked how easy it was, but I just couldn't get past that canned taste.

Took this to a bible study & a luncheon and every loved it!! I think I would have used fresh fruit verses canned. But it was super fast to make.
