I made this recipe on the 4th for a party and it was very good. I felt it needed a little more stock. I went to another party the next day so I made a few changes in the recipe and it was OUTSTANDING! The best I've ever had! I added 9 cups of potatoes intead of 5, used 1 cup butter instead of 1-1/2,used half and half instead of heavy cream, substituted one quart of the water with clam juice, added 1 tbl. thyme, and ommitted the carrots. 
Everyone loved it. Within an hour, the whole pot of chowder had been eaten.

This is one of the thickest, creamiest, BEST clam chowder recipes we have ever tried!  I did, however, use bottled clam juice instead of the water that was called for.  Probably not the healthiest soup with all that heavy cream, but the taste is wonderful.

I didn't change anything and now I wish I had.  This barely tasted like clam chowder to me - it was nice and thick and creamy but I felt it lacked a clam taste.  If I made this again I would use clam juice in place of the water (or at least l/2 juice and l/2 water).  Also, this makes a LOT of soup.

I'd never made clam chowder before; this was a huge success with my family! I'll make it often.  It does take a little time to do all the chopping, but it is well worth the effort!

My teenager 'signed' me up to bring a homemade soup to a Cheerleading dish-to pass.  I chose this recipe and it was delicious!  Very creamy and excellent tasting!  I did 'adjust' this recipe, as I cooked it in my crock-pot and was taking my crock-pot to the school. So,
I used 5 cans of clams, 16 ozs. Water, an 8oz bottle of clam juice, 1 quart of Heavy Cream, 1 Cup of Butter, and 1 Cup of Flour  and all the other ingredients listed in the recipe.  The only reason I reduced the liquids and clams was because of the size of my crock-pot.
If you use this recipe for a dish-to-pass, you will receive many compliments!!

Best Clam Chowder ever! I had never made clam chowder and gave this one a try. (It didn't call for tomatoes! :)) As I was cooking it I noticed that it was making A LOT. After pouring it altogether and putting everything into my pot I was very concerned. I looked at the recipe and noticed, for the first time, that it made 16 servings! I was definitely worried about my family of five eating it all before it went bad...until I took the first bite. Oh my! Soooo good! Thank you for adding this to allrecipes!! LOVE IT! I can my potatoes so didn't add those until everything else was added because they are already soft. Only variation I made. :)

Used 2 cups whole milk, 2 cups half and half instead of 4 cups heavy cream to cut down on richness. Used 2 cups water & 2 cups chicken broth instead of 4 cups water. Could have used more of a clam flavor. I think I have found my go to potato soup recipe.... just happens to have clams in it. DELICIOUS!

I used this as a base for a seafood chowder, instead of just a clam chowder. As well as clams, I added scallops, salmon, haddock and shrimp. It was rich and delicious. I did add a little dried tarragon (1 tsp) because we love the flavour with seafood.  My husband and 18 month old picky eater LOVED this chowder!

After reading a few other reviews which mentioned a lack of clam flavor, the only change I made was subbing half of the water with clam juice. Because I halved the recipe, it called for 4 cups of water; I used 2 cups plus 2 8 oz bottles of clam juice. 

The results were amazing-- everyone here, including two people who have lived in New England and can appreciate great chowder, proclaimed it among the best they'd ever had.

This is wonderful. My only tip would be to use a very large pot, as it is a huge recipe. If you don't have a very large one, make just 1/2 the recipe.

This was really good but needs clam juice for the broth as other reviewers suggested. Otherwise a five star recipe!I also added fresh thyme,garlic,and scallions for added flavor. I served with oyester crackers for dinner and it was a meal in itself as it was very hearty. Will definately make again. Thanks for the easy recipe!*update* made this again and added some better than boullion clam base and some old bay seasoning. it was much better this way. i also served it w/ some toasted cajun spiced sourdough croutons. a hit! this will be my clam chowder recipe from now on. next time i will leave the bacon on the side so it stays crispy

Really good chowder.  Next time I will use a bigger stockpot.  Very time consuming but worth it.  Prep ahead.

Very good but very rich.  You fill up really fast on this one.  I made as a first course but ended up saving our main meal until the next day because nobody could eat anything else.

My first attempt to make Clam Chowder and great recipe.  I did add two tablespoons of bacon grease into the recipe which added a good flavor, though not as healthy.  My 13 year old loved it.  The soup resembled a backed potato soup.

We like HEAT so I added 1 chopped jalapeno (for 6 serving size) omitted the carrots (because I don't think we wanted the sweetness) and added more celery and potatoes. This was so very GOOD!

I went over the other reviewers suggested and adjusted for the following when I made it: added more potatoes and veggies, was going to add clam nectar but that stuff has so much added salt in it so I added a low sodium veggie stock, added thyme, I also halved the recipe and added half heavy cream (2C) and 2c half and half -- boy was this still a rich and creamy soup.  Next time I would definitely add only half and half or even a 2% milk in there.  It was almost a little too rich.

The actual soup was great but it makes a lot more than 12 servings; more like 24. We had so much leftover we had to freeze it. I suggest cutting it in half.

Outstanding! Made a few changes....used only 1 quart of fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and 1% milk mixture....only used 1 stick of butter.....6 cans of clams....substituted some of the water with bottled clam juice and made my chowda a little thicker with some cornstarch...also used 1/2 a bag of o'brian style frozen potatoes. Delicious! Even my 7 year old loved it and ate it leftover! Nice hearty chowder...will make again!

It was amazing! My son said it was his new favorite (better than his previous favorite clam chowder served at a local restaurant).  I served it with an easy beer bread recipe and dinner was a hit.

This is delicious, made as directed except for leaving out the carrots because I don't like them in clam chowder, and using gluten-free flour.  It makes a LOT.  I wasn't sure it would freeze well, but it froze nicely for a couple of weeks.  Only thing I will do differently next time is to thicken only slightly (maybe 1/4 of the flour as called for, to help incorporate the butter, as I found it a bit TOO thick.  This could have something to do with the gluten-free flour that I used, but I do tend to like soups better when they are not very thick anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe.  I thought the clam flavor was very nice, not too strong.  I added some corn, cause I just figured it needed more veggies and I like corn in my chowder.  I also used small red potatoes that I din't peel.  And didn't bother adding any sugar since the veggies would give the soup enough sugar.  For sure will make this again.

I was looking for a clam chowder recipe after my mom came back from Cape Cod and told me about all the seafood she had eaten on the trip. It made me crave good, creamy clam chowder. I tried this recipe, altered it a bit-omitting the red wine vinegar (I forgot it at the grocer's) and using 1 cup water and 1 cup chicken stock. It was creamy and delicious! I'll be making this one in the winter when it's really cold

I thought this was the best clam chowder recipe yet! Loved it although I did make  the changes to add to the flavor.
9 cups of potatoes instead of 5
1 qt of clam juice to substitute 1qt of water and also replaced heavy cream with 1/2 & 1/2. TRY IT!!!

I first made this recipe two years ago and the family loved it.  It has become a required food at winter family gatherings.

This was great. Made it for some friends and they almost ate it all. Just 6 servings. Better than I have had in New England.

I made the clam chowder for Christmas and the family loved it.  I am allergic to clams, so I used the base and made a potato soup as well.  This too was loved by my family.

Obviously a very rich chowder (read the ingredients). I added a little extra bacon, plus a teaspoon each of dried basil and dried oregano. That probably wasn't enough to affect the taste of this excellent chowder. Next time, I would halve the recipe... it made much more than I could take to friends in a crock pot. It is maybe not the best recipe for taking to a potluck, because (like all soups thickened with a roux) it thins after an hour or two in a crockpot. Best to make it then serve it within a half hour.

I TOTALLY enjoyed this recipe!! The changes I made were to use half and half and to add whole milk to thin it out a bit. I also added more potatoes and onions. We LOVED it so much! I made it for my daughters, and my husband said on the way home, "You know darlin', you may need to make this when you come home next week". I am a travel nurse and LOVE Clam chowder anyway! I love how rich it is, but really needed to thin it down a bit! It was AMAZING!!

Excellent! Halved the recipe and it worked perfectly. Only substituted half and half for the full cream and it was plenty rich enough with a bit less fat. Beautiful recipe.

Great recipe for a large gathering. Other recipes are targeted towards smaller gatherings. Add other seafood components, but they key concept of the recipe: Keep your seafood broth separate from your milk products and NEVER boil are golden concepts! Thank you for the recipe!

I read the reviews first and am really glad I did. I cut the recipe in half and used clam juice in lieu of water and it turned out fantastic!  A little too thin at first for my taste but a few more tablespoons of flour fixed that. Going to be my go-to clam chowder from now on.

I substituted 16 oz of the water with clam juice.  Left everything else the same. Turned out awesome.

Delicious! I halved the recipe as it is big enough for an army! I added salmon with the potatoes and it was incredible. I highly recommend this for cooks who like to go from scratch!

Just tried it yesterday. I think for me next time less butter less cream. I had to add other condiments to take away from the butter after taste and had to add more water to soften the cream taste. Over all good and easy.

Made this tonight with just a couple of minor changes. Used a can of chicken broth instead of clam juice and a pound and a half of mixed seafood from my meat department. YUM YUM YUM!  Going to use this MANY more times!
