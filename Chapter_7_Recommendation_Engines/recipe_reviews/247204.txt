This was a watery mess.  You will need to cook this for an additional 30 minutes to get any semblance of thickness from your lentils.  I think the initial 6 cups water to 1 cup lentils is not correct.  Also, quite bland in flavor, tasting little like the Indian dal most of us are used to.

Was a really tasty dish. I didn't do the water according to the recipe, just checked on the lentils periodically and added more as they needed. Also added some paprika, and garlic powder and omitted the ginger (my wife doesn't like it) It needed a good amount of salt, but its super flavorful. Also made brown rice separately in my rice cooker and just served it that way. (I hate storing sauce with rice, it absorbs all the sauce and you lose that flavor) Would def make it again. Super healthy and tasty!  Makes a great breakfast the day after

Used cauliflower in place of broc, left out tomatoes, peas, and ginger. Tripled mushrooms. Served with white rice and Naan. Was stingy with spices, next time will use full amount. Very good.

Excellent flavor! I used much less water than called for: 2.5 cups water per 1 cup of lentils, and for the rice I followed the instructions on the package. I then cooked the lentils for 20-25 min, added other ingredients and cooked another 15 min. Then served the dal on top of the rice. I’m excited that this is a recipe I can eat, as well as my baby.

The spice combination was not the best for me. I think the turmeric overpowered the rest.  Maybe I need to get a fresh bottle. I tried adding garam masala too. It did not improve the flavor. Still too much spice. 

 I thought the consistency was fine as written-3 cups not 4.5. Not sure where the other “divided” portion belongs. I used red split lentils, so I did not need to cook as long as I did. I always use parboiled rice for the better effect on blood sugar with a lower glycemic index. It only takes fifteen minutes is cooking time and no soaking.

This was delicious however I only used the recipe as a base I doubled almost everything but the water added all the optional vegetables , added tomato sauce , Garam masala , and sour cream (would’ve used coconut milk but I had open sour cream to get rid of) I have no idea how long I actually cooked it just until it looked right. DELICIOUS

I doubled the veggies but only added half the water. It turned out thick and delicious!

I'm not familiar with how this dish is supposed to turn out, ,but was more of a soup than a rice dish. The amount of water required was quite high, with the rice overdone and lentils having completely lost their structure to the soup body. If this is what's expected.

I skipped the rice, it's just extra carbs. Tasty and easy.

Perfect! So, so, so good. I added some cauliflower because I didn't have peas or mushrooms. It cooks up exactly in the time and manner described. Excellent recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.
