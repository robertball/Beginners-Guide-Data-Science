It's O.K. but not great. Just an average salad - I didn't think it was anything special.

This is a really good recipe. The longer the dressing sits, the better it gets. I also replaced the sugar with splenda to reduce the calories.
I also didn't have cucumbers, but I did have a green bell pepper, so I used that and sliced it nice and thin.
For a bit more crunch, I added chopped walnuts and halved grapes. They worked very well with the dressing and the vegetables. 
Overall, this was a really nice, simple salad that would work in almost any meal.

I really liked this salad.  It was a bit sweet, which surprised me--I guess I forgot about the amount of sugar and was thinking of the vinegar! I'd cut some of the sugar next time. We don't eat raw onions, so I left them out, although I did add some dried minced onion to the dressing for the onion flavor.  I also didn't have carrots, but I'll try it with carrots next time.  It isn't to vinegar-y (at least I don't think so!).  I did halve the salad just so we could try it.  We had a tiny bit leftover, but it was almost the perfect amount for the two of us.  Thanks for the recipe!

We grow cucumbers and always seem to have more than we know what to do with.  This is a great recipe! I carried it to work and everyone wanted the recipe.

Excellent Recipe.  I'm not a fan of raw onions, but with the dressing, it was great!  Because I have diabetics in the house, I substituted half of the sugar for sweetener.  If you aren't a vinegar fan, it would be good with only 1/2 the dressing, too.

I made this for my daughter's Thanksgiving Feast.  I liked it, but my cucumber and vinegar loving 8 yr. old did not.

A delcicious and easy to make salad! I used a bit less sugar than the recipe called for, and it was perfect. I've actually been having cravings for it! I now have the perfect dish for upcoming summer BBQ's!

This is my favorite cucumber salad I've tried from this site. I did adjust the types of veggies based on what I had (cucumbers, onions, yellow bell pepper, carrots) & I subbed Splenda for the sugar (and reduced it, because Splenda is sweeter than sugar, even though the bag tells you to switch out cup for cup). I wish I'd had the celery, and I'll definitely continue to use bell peppers in this when they're available as the sweetness of the bell pepper made a wonderful contrast with the vinegar dressing. The only thing I'd change for next time is to add a little bit of water, maybe 1/8th cup, because I do like mine a bit more watery and less pungent (though my husband prefers it like this!) Thanks so much for the recipe :)

I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and still found this recipe to be too sweet. It was also very watery.

This is a fantastic dressing recipe.  It has a delicious balance of tangy & sweet. I only had time to marinate mine for about an hour but it still tasted great. I used cucumber, red bellpepper and carrots. But this would be great with any of your favorite veggies!

My husband I loved the sweet vinegar dressing. The kids did not. Best part is that it did not need time to marinate.
