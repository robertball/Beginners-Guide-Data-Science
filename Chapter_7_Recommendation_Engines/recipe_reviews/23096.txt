This was a great recipe! The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because it was a little too plain for my tastes. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only changes I made were: I didn't peel the potatoes but left the skins on and I cooked them for 3 min in the microwave before browning them. I cut out the olive oil completely and just sprayed my frying pan with Pam. And I added some diced onion.
Maybe next time I'll try adding some ham or mushrooms and maybe a little onion powder/garlic powder to give it more flavor.

It was a lot better with 1/2 c. of grated sharp cheddar cheese melted on top.

This is a good basic recipe.  I do think that you need to add something to suit your family's taste.  I added some parmesean cheese and basil with ham as well.  Thanks for the beginning of a good dish.

I love this!

The potatoes turn out tender inside and crispy golden outside, 
the eggs are just right.

I was lucky to have a 9" plate to use.  But overall, Yowza! Yummers!

Warning:  I changed a lot of things.  I followed the advice of previous reviewers for a few things.  I microwaved the potatoes first and added sauteed onions, and a bit of cheese on top.  I also added about a cup of broccoli to make it a complete meal (I feel a meal must have some veggie and potatoes are not veggies for me) and a couple more eggs.  I gave it four stars, because flipping via a plate seemed like a bad idea for me.  I put in under the broiler for a few minutes to finish it.  The cooked potatoes would have had a nice flavor on their own, but adding onions just makes it that much more.  The end result was gorgeous and delicious.

instead of making a big gooey mess by sliding it onto a plate, you can either put a lid on it (if your frying pan has one) right near the end to steam the top of the eggs, or if your frying pan has a metal handle, toss it in the oven for a few mintues - no mess! great recipe, love how simple and yummy it is.

Diced my potatoes and seasoned them with Lawry's seasoned salt and 2 cloves of garlic.  Also added a yellow onion.  Used 5 small potatoes because we were trying to get rid of them.  ONce everything was LIGHTLY fried I transfered everything to a casserole dish and poured in the egg on top.  Cooked it in the oven for about 20 min and then covered it with swiss cheese. Was really wonderful after all that!

Big hit with my husband and 2 year old daughter.  Made some tweaks, including microwaving the potatoes for 3 minutes as another reviewer suggested, then frying in 1 Tbsp oil with 2 cloves garlic and basil (dry as had no fresh on hand).  Then added eggs with salt and pepper mixed in to eggs first.  Turned out lovely.  Will be making this again soon.

I just made this for dinner and my husband loved it!  He's a tough nut to crack & it's very hard to find meals that he approves of.  I cooked it a bit longer that suggested to make the potatoes nice and crisp.  I also served it with a sliced plum tomato as a garnish and warm apple-cinnamon muffins.  It was delicious!!!

This is nothing spectacular. Even with extra spices and ketchup, it's still bland and boring. A regular omelette is tastier and much less work.

I must not be able to interpret the directions because the way I read it -- pour in the eggs, tilt so that eggs are at the bottom, reduce heat, flip -- produced a wet eggy mess all over my stove.  I should have let the eggs cook much longer, clearly, and when I was cooking that was my instinct, but I ignored it to follow the directions!    Other than that -- I did enjoy the recipe.  I added some sliced bell peppers and chili powder.  It really was quite good.  The confusing directions were the only drawback for me.

This was like the fritata I found in so many of the restaurants we found as we toured Spain.  Simple and delicious are the adjectives for this basic dish.

I rate this between 3 to 4 stars. No, it didnt hold together like many fritatta recipes I have attempted and it badly needed seasonings. I added a pinch of garlic seasoning and red pepper flakes. However, who doesnt really like eggs or potatoes. I used 2 standard sized russets cooked the day before. I highly recommend precooking the potato, sliced that thick. This is definitely very basic.

This is an Italian staple, and probably my favorite thing to eat.
I add some pecorino romano to the beaten eggs, along with some fresh chopped parsley.

I love this!  There are so many possibilities.  I made it as is and it is delicious, but you could add onions, red bell pepper, cheese, either bacon or ham, and top it all off with salsa.  Yum!
