Amazing.  Just as good as any fat-filled recipe.  I did make substitutions.  Used whole wheat flour, splenda, conola oil and egg beaters for an even healther treat.  Also added 1/2 t cinnamon for added taste.  Used 2 medium loaf pans and cooked for 40-50 minutes.  Is best when served room temperature and I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light

Baked this yesterday. I used 1/2 c yogurt instead of the 1/4 c applesauce like some of the old reviews said. Also read some reviews that said this bread was kind of bland so I added a little over a teaspoon of cinnamon.
CAME OUT GREAT! Very moist! I was afraid it'd dry out since I had to leave it in the oven longer than expected since the middle was mushy, but it came out moist and perfect.
Will definitely save this recipe and make it again.

Cut the sugar in half? YES. I cut it to 1/2 c. but it was still super-sweet. Make it 1/3 c., and use 3 smashed ripe bananas. I also used half whole-wheat flour, and sprinkled in some flax seeds for a nutty texture and omega-3's. Also cut down the vanilla to 1 t, since 1 T seemed excessive, and tossed in 1 t of cinnamon. Except for being way too sweet, I would use this recipe again.

This was sooo good! I love vanilla but 1 tablespoon is WAY too much. I reduced it to a little over a teaspoon, that is for sure a mistake in the recipe. I didn't do walnuts or choc chips but I added a big handful of fresh blueberries, and it was DELICIOUS, it disappeared quickly.  Also, I used half whole wheat pastry flour.  ****I make this a lot, and I've tried different things like adding a couple tablespoons of flax meal and a tablespoon of honey, and taking out some of the liquid since flax is considered a fat substitute. I really recommend it - it comes out so nicely and adds to the nutrition profile a lot.****

I followed the reviewers suggestions and added an extra banana, 1tspn cinnamon, and used (1/3cup) brown sugar and (1/3cup) white sugar. I baked this in a loaf pan, so I had baked it about 75-80 minutes. When I took it out, the bottom was stil mushy, so I put it in the oven for another 10 minutes or so. By then the bread was just about ready (Although there was still a little bit of mushiness unfortunately...  I didn't want the crust of the bread too burnt..). This bread was a little bland tasting. I could definitely taste the difference between this and regular banana bread. I much prefer regular banana bread. The loaf was quite dense and it did not rise enough in my opinion, so if I were to make it again in a loaf pan, I would add maybe a teaspoon more of baking powder. The recipe was alright, but I personally think there are better tasting banana bread recipes out there.

Very good recipe, I used an Omega Egg substitute and the recipe was still great(and cut the fat down even more). I will definitly put this one in my recipe book.

This recipe is fantastic!  My roommate bragged around school and one of her teachers demanded a piece.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of milk (plain works as well) to make the bread even moister.  Next time I make it I'm going to add some cinnamon too.

Love this recipe...Great tasting and healthy! I used whole wheat flour and added some flax seed for a little extra.  Just remember not to forget the applesause  as it is not in the directions.
Love it!

This recipe is delicious.  It has just the right amount of banana flavor and is very moist.  You can't even tell that it is a lower fat recipe.  My dog also enjoyed it (she stole half the loaf off of the kitchen counter when we were out of the house).

This is the 1st of 5 recipies that turned out for me and it was fabulous!  I followed it exactly, but I am curious about some of the substitutions that others have made and will try some of those next time.

Loved this recipe! Turned out well, even according to my boyfriend who doesn't like "low fat" foods. (I didn't tell him that it was low fat until after he ate 3 giant slices...)  Some changes I made: 1) 1/3 cup packed BROWN sugar + 1/3 cup white sugar, 2) three bananas instead of two, and skipped applesauce because I didn't have any on hand 3) butter instead of vegetable oil 4) skipped the walnuts, and 5) added 2 tsp cinnamon  Absolutely fantastic! I will definitely make this again :)

Excellent!  I often add one more banana and up to a cup of chopped nuts, then bake in two glass loaf pans as I find one large loaf takes a long time to bake (at higher altitude).

Wonderful!! I usually don't like "low fat" foods but wanted to give this a try. I'm hooked for life! I used splend instead of the sugar and used the tip from others to 1/2 the sugar. I have a sweet tooth and it was still good for me. I also put in almonds instead of walnuts, and like I said before, Wonderful!!!

I made this recipe with 3 bananas that I had leftover that I needed to use up before they went bad. This was by far the best banana bread recipe that I found out there. The fact that it was lower fat was an added bonus! I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup of white all purpose flour. It turned out fantastic. My husband says it's the best banana bread i've made since we've been married! (and I've tried several banana bread recipes- they all seem to turn out too mushy or too sweet). This bread is best when left to cool and then cut a slice and serve with butter.

This is a great and simple banana bread recipe. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and added an extra banana. Other than that, I did everything as told and it turned out very moist and flavorful! Thank you!!

Has wonderful flavor.  I made some substitutions as I am on Weight Watchers.  Flavor was great.  I froze bananas and then defrosted.  Adds so much more banana flavor.  Also used Fat Free Sour Cream instead of milk and cinnamon, numeg and allspice.  Also white wheat flour and Splenda Brown Sugar 1/3 cup and Splenda White 1/2 cup.  Was so moist!! Color wasn't same as most banana breads and will probably add a few more bananas next time.

Quite good for such little fat, but i'd prefer sacrificing a few calories and using king arthur flour's recipe (very good).  The loaf was browning too fast in my oven so i had to tent it with foil for the last 15 minutes or so.

this is a very delicious recipe to start considering it is so low in calories and fat but it could use a little more flavor, adding a third banana should do the trick and a little cinnamon would be a nice touch.

A breathe of fresh air - a healthy-er recipe that tastes so good!  Nice and moist as well.  I didn't have applesauce, so I used natural unsweetened yoghurt.....worked just fine, I assume sour cream would do the trick as well.....I also just realized that I forgot to put in milk! whoops, well it still turned out great so there you go;)  I didn't have walnuts either so left them out.  love it - thanks so much Katie for this great recipe!!

I made this almost exactly to the recipe and it was AMAZING! BEST banana bread I've ever made. I used chunky applesauce, left out the walnuts b/c I didn't have any, and I used 3 ripe bananas. SO very good! I will be using this recipe from now on.

A fantastic recipe whether or not you care about the "lower fat" designation. And if you don't mind the extra fat, this is great with a cup of chocolate chips added as others have mentioned (try it! really!). For those of you with convection ovens, I found my bread came out best when I baked it at 315 degrees for 50 minutes. And a final note- I used 3 bananas with great results. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

Delicious!  I added one teaspoon of cinnamon and replaced the walnuts with fresh blueberries (halved).  And to make serving easy, I made it into 12 muffins and baked at 400 for 20 minutes (with a small sprinkling of brown sugar on top of each).  Will definately make this again.

This is probably the best banana bread I have ever made (and I am forever trying new recipes!)  I was not specifically looking for a lower fat version - just one that didn't call for butter/margarine because I didn't have any on hand that particular day.  I do not think this recipe is lacking in taste at all; no one in my house (of picky eaters) could tell it was low-fat.  I love that it is so yummy and what a bonus that it is also somewhat healthy!  The only changes I make are: one additional banana, 1% milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, (I thought a tablespoon would be unnecessary).  This bread is great the first day, but I agree with the previous review in that it tastes even better after being wrapped up overnight.

This is a good base for a healthier banana bread, and is pretty tolerant to adjustments to personal taste.  I make the following adjustments: subbed 1/3 c. Splenda Brown Sugar for the reg. sugar; 1/3 c. lite sour cream for the milk; omitted the oil; subbed 3/4 c. oat flour for part of the flour (which I did by grinding up oats in a food processor); omitted most of the nuts; added 1 tsp. fresh ground cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.

Delicious banana bread! It doesn't even taste low fat. I made a few changes due to my personal preferences. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 3 bananas, and 1/3 cup fat free sour cream. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 3/4 cup chocolate chips. I'm sure the recipe didn't need any of those changes though.

Love love love this recipe.  I made these today with yougurt instead of applesauce, and my family inhaled them!  I've also made these with chocolate chips and another batch with blueberries-waiting for those to cool, but they look amazing!!  For those Weightwatchers out there-I worked these out on the website, and if you make them into muffins(12) they are only 4 points with walnuts or chocolate chips, and 3 points with blueberries!!!!  Thank you soooooo much for this recipe!

Awesome recipe and indeed very low fat! I didn't have applesauce at home so I replaced it with 1/4 cup plain yogurt (has a little fat but definitely not loading the recipe with extra fat) and it turned out very well! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Tried this today, but didn't have applesauce, so instead I grated a medium apple -- peel and all -  (it was about 3/4 cup worth of apple) and it was terrific!  Also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg.  It's delicous and doesn't taste "low fat" at all!

Yum!  Who knew low fat could be so good?!  I just added a little cinnamon and nutmeg for some extra spice.  I made 12 muffins and cut the baking time to 20 minutes.  Even my picky 2 yr old ate two muffins right out the oven.  Will defintely make again.

This is pretty darn good! I used 1/2 c. vanilla yogurt in place of the applesauce. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 C. as others have recommended and used 3/4 c. whole wheat flour, with the remainder being all purpose flour. Do not judge this recipe by its taste or texture straight out of the oven. It improves as it cools, and fooled several people today at church who would never have known it was low fat if I hadn't told them. I'd call it a winner!

These were good for a lower-fat recipe.  They were slightly lacking in banana flavor, and the consistency was a little too... spongy.  But, since it's a reduced-fat recipe, I suppose you have to reduce your expectations a little as well.
I made this recipe into mini-muffins.  I halved the recipe and it made 24 muffins.  In 13-14 minutes at 325º, they were done.  I used paper muffin cups, which might have been a mistake because the bottom of the muffins seem to stick to the paper.  Next time I'll spray the cups with Pam For Baking.  I used whole milk and left out the nuts(since they're for my 13-month-old son), used half brown sugar and half white, and added cinnamon (which I think it most definitely needed).  I read that other people used less vanilla, but I thought the specified amount was fine.  I haven't given it to my son yet, but my 6-year-old niece liked them.

I made this exactly per the recipe but with no nuts (didn't have any).  At first I just thought it was so-so -- a little on the dry side.  BUT, sitting on a plate covered in saran wrap, this bread just gets more moist!  The next day we were calling it banana cake!  It is just the right amount of applesauce so that you don't know it's in there.  This bread is GREAT and I will be making it again soon!

This was very moist and delicious.  I made this with 1/2 cup sugar instead of 2/3 and it was still plenty sweet.  I may try 1/3 next time.

This was pretty good. I don't really have it with a homemade that is "regular" fat, but I enjoyed it and my Hubby did also.  I substituted 3/4 cup of flour for wheat flour, added  1/2 cup of brown sugar and  2 tablespoons of butter and about 2-3 tablespoons of sour cream to make it a little more moist. It turned out really well as a healthy alternative to regular banana bread. I would definitely make it again, and probably add more sour cream, cinnamon like mentioned in other reviews, and more bananas to give it some more flavor.

This is a great low fat banana bread!  I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour the recipe called for, instead using only 3/4 cup all purpose.  I also used 3 bananas instead of 2 which added flavor and moistness.  Instead of making this recipe in a bread pan (which I have done before and it was a little dense) I sprayed cupcake tins and poured the mixture in them.  I omitted the walnuts for my guests and sprinkled sugar crystals on top for a coffee shop look.  My friends loved them and took the extras home for later.  This made 12 large muffins.

Pretty good. I made it better with brown sugar, whole wheat pastry flour and the addition of chopped pecans and a few chocolate chips. Great texture even without the fat.

Excellent recipe! I altered the recipe a bit. I used 1 1/2 cups of wheat flour and 1/4 cup of white flour. I also added some cinnamon...about 1 tsp. Followed the rest of the recipe to a T and it can out fantastic! Will make again and again!

I used whole wheat white flour, "soured" milk (as I'm out of buttermilk) and because I had a feeling that the batter might be a little dry, I threw in one more large mashed banana. Even at that, the batter was still a little dry. I did have to add 1/4 cup more "soured" milk. I was able to get 12 regular sized muffins and 8 mini-muffins. 350* for 20 minutes for the regular muffins and 12 minutes for the mini-muffins was just right.

Great recipe, much better alternative then a banana bread with 2 sticks of butter in it! I made a few changes put in 2 cups of flour (by accident still turned out great), 1/3 c of white sugar and 1/3 c of brown sugar, added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and only 1 tsp of vanilla instead of a tablespoon, also I didnt have any applesauce so I used a 6 oz yogurt(strawberry flavored-made no noticeable difference) like one of the other reviews suggested.  Turned out perfect and moist I will definitely use this recipe again.

This bread is great! Better than the regular, full fat bread. I add chocolate chips to mine in place of nuts(for my boyfriend) or slivered almonds are good in it as well. I usually use 4 extremely ripe, frozen(thawed) bananas and it really makes it moist and brings out the flavor. I use this recipe every time I make banana bread, which is usually once a month, and I am always happy with the turn out.

Excellent recipe! I make it all the time. I use brown sugar instead of white and a little less than the recipe calls for (it's plenty sweet with less) and whole wheat flour, also three ripe bananas, and lots of walnuts. The family loves it and it's extremely easy. Definitely try it.

SO good!  I followed the recipe exactly - just reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  Everyone was suprised it was lower fat - it's moist, dense, and flavorful.  It was gone in less than a day.  A super treat with coffee or tea or for a quick breakfast.

Delicious!  I ended up using a 6oz container of French Vanilla yogurt instead of applesauce, and used only 1/2 tablespoon of oil.  I also added chocolate chips (couldn't make it too healthy...hehe).  Very moist!

This was very good for a low fat recipe.  I did tweak it a little, as I did read the reviews.  I did add a tsp of cinnamon, used half sugar, half brown sugar, an extra banana, as well as 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour (I always do that when I can).  I also added more nuts...closer to a 1/2 cup.  I thought it was very good and not a strange texture like some low fat breads.  It didn't need quite an hour either.  I baked it for 50 mins, and it came out fine.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I did not follow the recipe to a T!

Yummy!  This was sooooo amazing.  Followed the recipe apart from adding some cinnamon + nutmeg and an extra banana. yummy in my tummy as well as the tummies of my roommates.
Edit:  Just made this again and I didn't have vegetable oil nor milk, so I substituted one tablespoon veg oil for 1 TB olive oil.  and I substituted the milk for rice milk (+ another tablespoon of olive oil).  I know this may sound weird, but I had to work with what I got.  In the end, it still tasted fantastic!  Oo, like usual, I used 3 bananas instead of two.

This was a great recipe. I substituted 1/4 light sour cream for the applesauce (I needed to use it up) and added the cinnamon someone else recommended.  I also added a dash of cloves.  It is very moist and tasty!

Yum! I only used 1/8 tsp of vanilla, and instead used 1 tbsp of cinnamon. It turned out FANTASTIC. Moist and delicious and I'm keeping this recipe forever.

didn't rise, but egg substitute, splenda, and skim milk make it non-fat, low-cal and it still tastes decent. i tried to use yogurt like others said, but i don't recommend doing this! it made it mushy, and i think what have been what prevented it from rising. STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL! USE APPLESAUCE! oh, and don't use oil, i completely omitted it and it didn't matter, and also, another banana helps enhance the flavor.

My family really liked this recipe. It wasn't over sweet like alot of banana breads. I used real vanilla, not imitation. I also ran into a problem of my own, I ran out of baking powder, but I always have cream of tartar and baking soda on hand (and cornstarch),so I used them to sub the baking powder and then added the baking soda it called for. The batter tasted very strong. I thought I blew it! But all my kids give it a thumbs up, and it gets 2 thumbs up from hubby because it is lower in fat and sugar and taste great!

This is the 3rd banana bread recipe I've tried from my site, and this is my least favorite. It was moist, and had good texture, but it lacked in flavor.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

This is a wonderful low fat recipe.  I did use 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I also used 3 bananas instead of 2. It is very moist and has a great banana flavor. I made it for my husband and am hoping that he won't be able to tell that it is low fat. We shall see tonight.....

This recipe was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  The bread was not crumbly and stays together when cut.  Despite it being a "healthier" version of banana bread it's still quite tasty.  To make it even more healthy next time I'll cut the sugar in half...

Loved it!  I followed others' suggestions:
1. 1/2 cup sugar
2. 3 bananas
3. Teaspoon (not tablespoon) vanilla
4. 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 all-purpose flour
5. Threw in chocolate chips

Excellent!

Pretty good.  I didn't feel like chopping any nuts, so I put in dried cranberries insteaed.  This made the bread a bit sweeter, and I liked the flavor from the cranberries.  It's pretty dense, and it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to bake--at 350.  I dont' bake anything in my oven at 325--takes way too long!  This is easy to mix up and used my last two bananas, some milk, and applesauce--all things that needed to go, so it works for me.  I think it could benefit from some spices (cinnamon, etc) that I'd add if I make it again.  I don't think we'll eat it all though, so it'll take a field trip with me to work.  Thanks for the recipe!

This banana bread is FANTASTIC!  I combined advice from other reviewers, used 1/3 cup light brown sugar and used about 1/6 cup of Splenda.  Instead of the applesauce I used Light Greek Yogurt, reduced the 1 Tbs of Vanilla to 1 Tsp, and added cinnamon to taste.  I baked the bread on the rack below the middle for 50 minutes and it came out perfectly...very moist.  I also made sure when I was combining the dry ingredients with the wet, that I didn't over-mix it.

Replaced apple sauce with 1/2 cup non fat Greek yogurt, put in 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and used 1 cup spelt flour and 3/4 cup all purpose.  I also reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp and replaced nuts with chocolate chips for the kids.  Everyone loved them!

I made these as muffins and my family immediately devoured them. They disappeared faster than my usual banana nut bread that I make with a cup of sugar and 2 sticks of butter. I highly recommend them.

I made this twice already and my family and I love it. I added vanilla, cinnamon and an extra banana. The second time around I also added walnuts and butter scotch chips and lessened the amount of sugar. Very scrumptious.

this was my first time making banana bread. I used this recipe and took from other reviews....i used yogurt instead of the applesauce, splenda instead of the sugar (1/2 of the amount), and mini semi-sweet choc chips instead of walnuts--it turned out great! it was moist and delicious!! i will be making this recipe again!

This was a fabulous recipe.  Very moist and delicious and made a wonderful low-fat desert.  I used an extra banana, half brown / half white sugar, and cut the vanilla to 1.5 tsp per other users suggestions.  I was also going to add cinnamon but forgot and it still came out tasty enough.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good recipe! I would definitely recommend adding some cinnamon (about 1 tsp.), b/c I think it would be a bit bland without it. Otherwise, this definitely satisfied my craving for banana bread (& I feel a lot less guilty eating it!:))

This is the healthiest, best tasting banana bread recipe that I've encountered so far. I made some minor changes- instead of 2/3 cups of sugar, I used 1/3 splenda and 1/3 brown sugar. I also omitted the oil and added a few shakes of cinnamon. It tasted great, and my family loved it even more than the 'less healthy' recipe I tried last week. Try pouring the batter into muffin pans and sprinkling on cinnamon and walnuts before baking.

i did my bread diff, 1/3 c of sugar, 1/4 c of yogurt, 4 banannas, 1/2 t vanilla. i overcooked it as this was my first time & every time i would insert the knife to see if it was cooked, it would come out w some sticky batter, adn i gave it 45 extra mins, as in the recipe it says, the toothpick needed to come out clean, so thts wrong in the recipe. the four bananas didnt do much, still needed more of the banana flavor...so next bread ill add more bananas. but overall, it was a good recipe... i will try this again w more bananas n maybe some banana extract n omit vanilla extract!!

Used this recipe to make muffins--turned out great.  Baked at 350 for 15-18 minutes. Also, added chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Yum!

Absolutely amazing recipe.  We made a few minor adjustments, which actually made it healthier.  We substituted brown sugar for white sugar, and instead of a cup and 3/4 of flour, we used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup of white flour.  It came out spectacular.  We added a touch more vanilla, too, and we upped the bananas to 3.  It was a great recipe.  Will make it again (in fact, we're making a second loaf tomorrow).

I was really shocked at how good this was!  I am not a fan of most low fat items but this will be a regular from now on.  Made with three bananas and yogurt instead of applesauce since we were out.  Very, very good and the kids devoured it!

This is great.  I omit the walnuts, don't use any oil, only use ~1/2c sugar,and add cinnamon/nutmeg. I've been tweaking with this recipe since I found it..have made it at least 8 times in the past year or so.  Great recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I'm going to make it again real soon.  I made it with wheat flour because it's all I had in the house and it still turned out very tasty.

I used three bananas and ground fresh whole wheat, other than that followed to a T.  VERY good, totally can't tell it's lower in fat.  My family loved it.  This is my favorite banana bread recipe now!

This was awesome. My three year old and I just whipped up a batch for daycare tomorrow. While I skipped the nuts because it was for little one...it was wonderful. We always make our bread in fun shapes, tonight was bears. Great recipe!

I added some nutmeg, cinnamon,and cranberries. I also reduced the baking soda and used a combo of brown sugar & white sugar, and 3 bananas. It came out really well! Make sure u bake it for about an hour and a half.

I made this into a gluten-free version by substituting whole grain brown rice flour.  I was out of sugar so I substituted 1/2 Sugar Twin and 1/2 brown sugar.  I didn't have regular applesauce so I used a single serving of Mott's No Sugar Added Wild Berry sauce.  I added cinnamon as others suggested as well as three bananas.  It's a great gluten-free treat!  Turned out great - but needs even more cinnamon next time!

This is a great recipe considering that it's lowfat. My husband and son , who usually doesn't touch b.nut bread, loved it. I didn't have any vanilla ext. but that didn't make a difference.Like other reviewers suggested I added an extra banana.Yummy!

This was great w/ the addition of suggestions from other users.  I used 3 bananas, split the sugar to half brown-half white, added handful of chocolate chips, 1 Tbs honey, and 1/2 tsp each cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and allspice.  Mine baked for 75 minutes and turned out perfect.  I agree that the bread is much better after it cools overnight.  Husband and kids all loved it too.  We will make this again!! Thanks for the recipe and all others for their suggestions!!

One of the best low fat banana breads I've tried! Like others, I made a few modifications based on others suggestions: I added an extra banana, used no oil (used an extra tablespoon of applesauce), omitted nuts, and used all whole wheat flour.  I think what made the difference in the recipe was the addition of cinnamon and honey.  Definitely added the extra flavor the bread needed.  Bread was super moist… definitely will make again.

Awesome!  I made this for a party and it was gone in minutes!  I divided the suger to 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup white.  Then I added 1 tsp cinn and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I also added an extra large banana to total it to 3.  I also threw in a chopped medium sized apple.  All I can say is HEAVEN!

This is really good and moist. Substituted brown for white sugar, whole wheat flour for white, used all the vanilla required, 3 bananas and put a few choc chips and walnuts in. I'll make this again...it's good and healthy.

Absolutely delicious! I used vanilla soy milk instead of cows's milk and used a touch of brown sugar in place of some of the white. I made it twice and will make it again. Watch the baking time. Mine was done in 50 minutes.

Delicious bread, my hubby wouldn't have known it was low-fat if I didn't tell him.  I used 3 small bananas.  Don't forget the applesauce since it's not written in the instructions!  Will definitely use this again.  I used my own homemade no sugar added applesauce. So easy to make!

This is one of the best banana breads i've tasted. But the author forgot to include the applesauce in the directions. I added it when the bananas get put into the mixer.

The bread wasn't bad, but the fact that it was lower in fat did make up for it. To make it healthier I substitiuted half the white flour for whole wheat flour. that made the bread heavier so maybe that's why it didn't rise so well. I also used light brown suger instead, but the bread was still a little too sweet. this wasn't the best banana bread but i think i will try it again because it's a healthy way to use up ripe bananas

I listened to a review and used 95% whole wheat flour and only baked it for 40-45 minutes, even though my pan was smaller so I thought I'd have to cook it for longer, and it turned out pretty tough.

Def needs some slight tweaks, but thanks to all the reviews I came up with a hearty & delicious banana bread! Would def make again. Trying to watch my sugar intake and health in general. Losing baby weight...
I used 2% instead of nonfat milk, whole wheat flour instead of white, and coconut oil melted instead of canola oil. I adjusted the vanilla based on everyone's suggestion and added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I made a double batch and added chocolate chips to one pan for my honey. I also cut the sugar in 1/2 based on everyone's suggestions as well. YUM :)

Just came out of the oven and cooled a little, tried a piece and super moist! I added half the sugar but used a little extra applesauce to make up for it. Also used less vanilla and added some cinnamon. Used EVOO instead of veggie oil and used 1 cup whole wheat flour instead of all white. Very good! Was looking for a recipe that was healthier but not super healthy thst ladies at work wouldnt like, this is perfect!

I tweaked this recipe after reading reviews and it came out PERFECT! The changes I made:
3 very ripe small/med bananas
1/3 c lightly packed brown sugar
1/2 c white sugar
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp vanilla
1/3 cup almond milk 

Added:
1/3 cup coconut flakes (adds a yummy texture) 
cinnamon (good amount), ginger and nutmeg

Omitted 
-applesauce since I added a 3rd banana
-walnuts (just didn't have any at home)

I used 2 loaf pans, a regular size glass loaf pan and a mini 5 1/2 x 3 pan. The mini loaf took 40 mins and the regular loaf took 45 mins.  I would keep a close eye on it and keep poking it with a toothpick.  As soon as it comes out clean, it's done. This is definitely my go to banana bread recipe.  It's not extremely sweet but very moist with a soft banana flavor.

Eh this wasn't very good. It was too sweet for my tastes and just tasted different than normal banana bread. I think it had too much vanilla in it. I'll keep looking for a healthy banana bread recipe.

This recipe is wonderful.  I cut the sugar in half as many others did and also added chocolate chips.  As has been suggested, I used 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon almond extract although I'd go with all vanilla next time (I liked it but my kids did not).  I replaced the flour with a mix (same total volume) of whole grain flours and flax meal.  It's super easy and delicious!!

I was diagnosed with Fructose Malabsorption where naturally occurring fruit sugars are not properly digested, bounce around in my gut and ferment.  Good times...  BUT!  This banana bread is perfect once slightly modified. ~~~ Substitute 1/3 cups of sugar with Dextrose (natural and less sweet than Sucrose) and since apples are also off-limits to Fructose Malabsorbers the applesauce needed to be subbed also.  I didn't want to use oil, so I used Sugar-Free Jello Instant Banana Cream Pudding.  Amazing! ~~~ This banana bread is sincerely the best I've ever had, and I'm a total carb-o-holic so I know banana breads :)

Kid approved.  I used 1 TSP not TBL of vanilla and added a dash of cinnamon. I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and omitted the walnuts (my child doesn't like those).  In my haste, I acidentally omitted the oil and it was still terrific without it.  I may avoid the flour next time in the pan and just "pam" it.  Really good.

Delicious! After reading other reviews I modified the recipe little bit:  I used 3 bananas, 1/2 cup white yogurt (instead of the apple sauce) and only 1/3 cup of sugar. I also added some cinnamon, raisins and lax seeds. 

The bread came out nice and moist with a great banana flavour. I have tried several other banana bread recipes before, but this one is my favorite   :)

Baked exactly as directed and loved it! My boyfriend couldn't get enough. Moist and wonderful. I cooked it a bit longer when I made it the second time around (by accident), but it gave it a nice crisp 'crust' on the top that I definitely loved.

Delicious and moist made just as written. No need to change a thing.   (Pet peeve: Don't change a bunch of stuff and then give it a lesser rating!  That's just ridiculous to say the least.) Rate the recipe based upon the actual recipe!

Delicious!  I made this using 3 bananas and sour cream instead of the milk.  I made one mini loaf and one regular loaf out of the recipe.  It was perfectly moist and nice and golden brown too.

Of course this doesn't taste like original banana bread but it is still good and that's all that matters!! I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat as well as using 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar. I also used 3 bananas. It was very yummy!!

Seems like this COULD be good AND healthy. I  think it needs FOUR bananas instead of two. And maybe a little more sugar. Maybe 2/3 cup white sugar & 1/4 cup brown?? I made this with half wheat flour & half white flour, I also added flax seed. & 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I also added 1/2 tsp. more baking soda since some reviews said it was a mush mess & didn't rise well. Mine rose perfectly & looked great! It really was pretty moist so I don't think it needs any more oil. Good recipe but next time I will add a little more sugar & more bananas!

I have never made banana bread before because I don't like bananas - but this is amazing! My husband and 2 1/2 year old also loved it. I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand - I think we've found a great new snack! I followed the recipe as is.

Love it. Thank you for a great recipe. I made this tonight. I followed other reviews and I made these substitutions. I used 1/4 cup nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of applesauce; 1/3 cup sugar; 1 tbsp olive oil instead of vegetable oil because I didn't have any vegetable oil; nutmeg to taste, cinnamon to taste; 2 tbsps soy flour with 2 tbsps water to replace the 2 eggs and 1/4 cup wheat bran for more fiber.   I baked it for 1.5 hrs. The top was a little drier than I would have liked but the bread is moist and just the prefect texture.

This recipe was absolutely amazing!! I had some really ripe bananas and did not want to see them go to waste, especially since I'm a college student :) I did substitute a small carton of plain yogurt for the applesauce and added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the dry mixture. It turned out super moist! It did bake a big loaf so I froze half of it and it was just at good thawed out. I will definitely make this again, thanks for the awesome recipe!

My entire family enjoyed this bread - which meant my kids didn't even realize this is a low fat version!  Yummy and moist.  I did make two changes - I used a 1/2 cup applesauce and omitted the oil, and I used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  I wrapped the bread in foil to "steam" the loaf to ensure it was moist.  I think this is my new go to banana bread recipe.

This was the best banana bread I've ever made. I didn't miss the butter at all. I made one change. I used 1/3c white sugar, 1/3c brown sugar. This is my new recipe for banana bread.

I used a 1/2 cup of fat free vanilla yogurt instead of the apple sauce, 3 bananas instead of 2 like the original recipe requires, and I substituted a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the nuts. I baked it for about 65 minutes and it came out great! Very moist with a medium density. This no cupcake... this is a hearty bread. Too bad I can't calculate the calories and fat with my substitutions.

I made this today and it came out pretty good. I didn't have enough flour so I used 3/4 cup of wheat flour. I felt it was a tad dry because of this.

This was moist and pretty tasty. Not the best I've ever had but good for a lower fat version.

I use whole wheat and 3 bananas in this recipe still find it to be wonderfully moist. I also leave out the nuts. I make it two batches at a time so I can freeze slices for my 1 year old. He loves it and I'm guilt free giving it too him. A great healthy banana bread!

Quite superb! Used an extra banana, cinnamon,less vanilla than called for, whole wheat flour, replaced half of the sugar with brown sugar, threw in a handful of ground flax seed and wheat germ, and added extra love:)It has a delicate flavor (any more banana flavor and it would taste like fake banana-- that's no bueno) with a robust texture, due to the whole wheat flour. My father, a notorious carb dodger, helped me demolish 3/4 of the loaf. Any recipe that entices a rigid dieter to vary from their norms is a winner in my book. Bravo!

I love this recipe I have made it two weeks in a row when our bananas get too ripe. The only thing I switch out is chocolate chips for the walnuts, SO good!

Really good for a reduced fat bread!  I made it with 3 bananas, 1/2 c brown sugar, buttermilk instead of nonfat, and 1/3 c mini choc chips plus the walnuts.  Just had a slice with a glass of milk...and it's hard to not grab another!  I think next time (and there will be one) I'd cut the baking time slightly by 5 mins and maybe add the yogurt as well for a little more moisture.  Thanks!

This recipe was amazing!  I've never made any kind of bread before and it turned out PERFECT!  I omitted the vegetable oil entirely and used 3 bananas.  I also added a tablespoon of cinnamin and reduced the vanilla to a teaspoon as other reviewers suggested.

I loved this recipe! I made a few alterations though. Instead of using regular applesauce, I used strawberry because it was all I had. I also used 3 banana's, and about a teaspoon of cinnamon. Very good! I will certainly be making this again!

I found my bread to be a little tasteless.  I think I'll add some cinammon and nutmeg next time and maybe more applesauce.  I actually added three large very ripe bananas (almost black) but the banana flavor just didn't come through like I'd hoped.  

All in all, it's a great basic recipe that I'll keep in my recipe box.  Thanks!!

Yummm it was delicious, and very pleasing as it has much less calories than other recipes. I didn't have applesauce, so I substituted the sauce with 1/2 cup yoghurt as another person suggested, and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cinnamon to add a little spice. I wanted to use wholemeal flour, so I made it 1 cup wholemeal, 3/4 cup standard. Topped it off with sunflower seeds which added a yummy crunch. With these changes the bread was still lovely and moist and ill definitely make it again!

This is a very good bread.  I added a third banana and I think it could still use a little more.  I used a tablespoon of applesauce instead of oil, and light sour cream instead of milk (which could be attributed to the lack of banana taste?).  I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Very moist bread; easy to throw together; will definitely make again.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a third banana and several dashes of spices (nutmeg & cinnamon this time).  Even with the third banana, it was light on the banana taste, but still a very good breakfast/tea bread.

This is a nice recipe.  I made it with whole wheat flour and added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and about a 1/4 c of ground flax seed. I also ground up the walnuts before folding them in (to hide them from the kids!). It's obviously a very healthy bread and nicely moist, but it's not quite as sweet as banana bread usually is. I find it tastes more like a hearty slice of bread, rather than a typical sweet bread. The recipe as I made it is excellent with a thin spread of peanut butter on it.  If you are looking for a wholesome, healthy, not-too-sweet banana bread, I would definitely recommend this recipe and subsitute whole wheat flour.

I think I would actually give this 4 and a half stars - it's actually a bit spongy for my taste, because it's that moist.  Still delicious for a low fat version.  I used whole wheat flour and egg substitute.  Husband didn't even question if it was low fat ...and he usually sniffs those things out!

This is very good for being a low-fat recipe.  I 3 1/2 bananas, added cinnamon, nutmeg and made jumbo muffins; topped them with a quick streusel (brown sugar, butter, flour, walnuts & cinnamon).  They were gone in no time!

This recipe is amazing! First thing I baked in my new home and it turned out beautifully! I did use three bananas as suggested by others, and it was definitely needed. I also used a tsp or so of cinnamon because it sounded yummy. The bread came out very spongy and moist. REALLY impressed with myself. :-D Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I'm a complete novice, and I have successfully made these twice.  I was inspired by everyone's recommendations to alter the recipe a little bit, so I threw in a few overly ripe strawberries as well as chocolate chips instead of nuts.  I also made muffins instead of bread.  They turned out really well and are very moist.

This recipe is by far the best!  It is so moist and very easy to make.  I have made this on several occassions, and at times I added some chocolate chips which made it even better.

This turned out quite well using whole wheat flour. It could probably have come out a bit sooner though. I'd check it with a fork after 40 mins.

Not bad, and I appreciate that it doesn't have all the oil of other recipes, but nothing special.  I even added more banana and cinnamon as others suggested.

I found this banana bread to be a little too dense, and kind of bland.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg as others had suggested, but it really needed another banana or two.  (I only had two on hand, so that's what I used.)

Everyone loved this lower fat version!!!  They even preferred it over regular banana bread. It is very moist and flavorful. From now on, this is the only recipe I'll be using for banana bread.

This was my first time baking banana bread and it turned out great.  Followed some other reviewers advice and used half brown sugar/half white; three bananas instead of two (we had three ripe on hand) and added cinnamon.  Will definitely be making this next time we have ripe bananas.

I think it definitely needed more banana, it was alright I won't make again. I think I stick to the regular old fashioned stick of butter bread..

Oh my gosh, was this good!! I was skeptical at first but one bite convinced me! I forgot to put chocolate chips on top though....this is a keeper so I will remember to do it next time..I followed the recipe to the "T" except for the applesauce..I saw where it was on the ingredient list but didn't see it added in the directions? I didn't have plain applesauce, all I had was cinnamon but it worked just as well. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

I used Splenda instead of sugar and whole wheat flour.  It was very good but a little dense and heavy, probably due to the flour.  I gave it a four because I thought it could use some zing, maybe nutmeg or cinnamon.

I used this recipe to make muffins and I thought they turned out pretty well. They're almost as moist as regular but a bit more chewy. I used splenda instead of sugar, 3 bananas and I only had peach applesauce so I used it instead of regular. I also used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flower with one cup regular. I wasn't sure of the baking time so I went with 15 minutes and they were cooked perfectly. I will make these again.

This bread is delicious, I omitted the walnuts.
I do have one complaint.
The recipie called for Applesauce in the ingredient list, but never incorporated it into the recipie. The bread was done and in the oven before I realized I'd left the applesauce out. Still came out great anyhow.

For low fat, not bad at all. I followed the recipe as it is. The only thing I would change is add one more banana. I used two good sized bananas that were very ripe and just one more would have been perfect.

Heavenly banana bread! Most recipes leave the center raw, or are too greasy for our tastes. Only sub was a heaping tablespoon of sour cream to give it a bit more moisture while blending wet ingredients. Bravo low fat banana bread!

I thought this recipe had a great taste and texture! It was just the right crunch on the outside and so moist on the inside! I baked my bread in 4 small loaf pans and cooked it for 40-45 min. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil, I used whole wheat flour, added ground flax and added 2 tsp cinnamon. I will make this again and try using Splenda and egg whites/egg or egg substitute to make even healthier!

Great recipe! I made adjustments as well. I used 3 1/2 overripe bananas, 1 tsp. of cinnamon, all whole wheat flour, and sprinkled the nuts on top. Really moist results! I will certainly make this again!

I also added ground flax seed and fresh blueberries.  I mixed the walnuts with pecan pieces.  Not too bad at all.  Loved using the applesauce! Maybe I'll try it with dark chocolate chips next time.  :)

Made this exactly as written plus 1 Tbsp extra flour to adjust for high altitude.  It's delicious.  I'm eating a piece now, warm from the oven.  Thank you for sharing.

This bread was delicious and soo easy to make. I also added one tsp of cinnamon and maybe next time i'll use two large bananas or use three smaller ones for a more banana-y flavor. Overall, I was very pleased thanks for sharing!

This was a very good recipe.  I think the thing that helped it out the most was the second step where you beat the eggs and sugar until fluffy.   That seemed to give this very dense and moist loaf a raise.  Thank you for the heathly snack!

After looking through some of the reviews, I also cut the sugar down to a 1/3rd cup, added a tsp of cinnamon, cut the vanilla down to a tsp. and used half whole wheat flour. In addition, I doubled the applesauce and added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. 
The bread turned out very well - moist and flavorful, very banana-y. Since I'm at altitude I increased the temp to 350 degrees and it was done in 50 min.

Very time consuming to chop all the apples. I used jazz apples.  It turned out good, but not great.  I will give this a second try soon.

This is good especially for being low fat. Added a tsp of cinnamon and used 1/4c plus 1 tbsp of nonfat vanilla yogurt in place of the applesauce and oil and it came out very moist.  Would probably add another banana next time I make it.

Delicious. Did 1/3 cup brown and 1/3 cup white sugar as recommended, used one of those individual serving sizes of cinnamon applesauce, added some more cinnamon and almost a tbsp of vanilla extract. Yummy and moist, but pretty strong cinnamon taste, probably didn't need to add the extra tsp with the flavored applesauce. I'll omit it next time

Made this exactly as recipe.  Per other reviewers I also would add a tad more sugar next time altho I did use 'no sugar added' applesauce so that may have made the difference.

Thus was the best banana bread recipe ever. The whipping of the eggs made a real difference in the texture of this bread. Very light and fluffy. A real keeper. No alterations to the recipe was needed.

This recipe is just okay. The banana bread barely tastes like banana bread in spite of following users' suggestions to add more bananas; I did add extra stuff like honey and cinnamon and am very glad I did because otherwise the bread would've been very bland. Nevertheless, the fact that it's low fat and still pretty decent tasting means that I'll be making this again and again--at least, again and again until I find either a *lower* fat recipe and/or a better tasting version.   If you're looking for a hearty banana bread, you will not find it here.  If you're looking for an easy quickbread that tastes pretty good and is low fat, give this a try.

This banana bread is perfect! I followed the recipe almost exactly, adding a bit extra banana [straight outta my freezer!'] margrine instead of applesauce [didn't have any] and no nuts. The bread came out moist and perfect. Everyone loved it, I will for sure make this banana bread again!

This recipes is so moist and delicious.  No one can tell that it is lower fat.  I make a loaf of this every week(without walnuts) for my toddler and she loves it with peanut butter on top.

Really good for lower fat. I also used vanilla yogurt in place of the applesauce; used 3 medium bananas and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I didn't want to heat the kitchen up so I put it all in my breadmachine and ran it on the cake cycle - it came out surprisingly well!

This recipe was great! This was my first time making Banana Nut Bread (Which is my favorite!) I did make some substitutions as well. I used splenda granulated sugar and I used a whole snack sized cup of applesauce instead of using any oil at all. It turned out great! This banana bread is delicious!

I love this banana bread and make it once or twice a week.  I make the following changes, which are minimal... I always double the recipe because we seem to always have 4 overripe bananas.  Instead of 3 1/2 c. (the doubled amount), I use 2c. whole wheat flour + 1 1/2 c. oat bran.  In addition, I omit the walnuts, but for the last two batches I've added about 3/4c. fresh blueberries.  I bake it in mini loaf pans for 40 minutes at 325.  Fabulous!  My three young daughters love it and I can't keep my husband away:)

This turned out really well.  Instead of applesauce (I didn't have any) I used a 1/4 cup of vanilla yogurt.  Next time I'll try out the applesauce, but overall a success.

Great recipe.  Loved it.  My 4 yr old can smell it when she comes home from school and can't wait to eat it.  I did bake it on the top rack for the most part, as my oven is strong, then moved to middle for last 15 mins.  I don't let it cool too long, it tastes best right out of the oven.

Wow, these were quite good!  I made the recipe into muffins, use half the sugar, omitted the oil and added some cinnamon.  I was surprised how good they were, I didn't think they'd turn out so tasty!  They were perfectly sweet with 1/2 the sugar.

I started making this bread a few months ago and will continue to!  It comes out perfectly moist and I never feel bad about baking just because we have two overly ripe bananas (due to how little fat actually goes into it).  It's also incredibly quick and easy.

This recipe also turns out well using whole wheat flour and egg substitute. I did reduce the vanilla to 1 teaspoon based on other reviews and added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Finally, my bananas were not very big so I put in three instead of two. This is yummy!

This tasted great.  Because my son is allergic to diary and eggs, I made a couple changes.  I used rice milk and egg replacer.  I also used an individual cinnamon applesauce.  Everything turned out great.  I did have to bake it a little longer than one hour, but that might just be my oven.  Oh...I also baked this recipe in three mini loaf pans.

i used half the sugar called for, applesauce instead of the oil, and an extra banana.  it had great banana flavor, was very moist, and made me feel much better for eating it since it was a little healthier than other recipes.  will keep this in my recipe box! thanks!!

Loved this recipe! I made some substitutions but it still turned out amazing. I used 2/3 cup of liquid egg whites, whole wheat flour, some flax meal in place of the oil, I cut down the sugar and used half white and half raw sugar, added a heavy squeeze of honey, some cinnamon, and added two more bananas.

I have a recipie almost identical to this.  The changes I made were to use stone ground wheat flour instead of white. My recipe also had 1/2 cup applesauce and only 4 tsp of milk. It's a great recipe either way!

this is so moist! i used a 4 oz package of cinnamon apple sauce, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added a dash of allspice and a few dashes of cinnamon as well. these changes were based on other reviews, which also claimed that the banana taste was a bit weak, so i added another banana as well (three total). definitely a keeper for banana bread lovers!

Great recipe. I swapped chopped almonds for the walnuts, 1/2 cup fat free plain yogurt for the applesauce, added cinnamon, nutmeg, ground flax seed for added fiber, and 1/2 cup sugar free maple syrup instead of the sugar.  I made them into muffins and the are amazing!  I am going to make a hazelnut honey cream spread to go along with these.  Watch the baking time because the inside will stay moist but the outside will get chewy after 30 minutes in the oven.

I made this per recipe with a few changes suggested by others.  3 bananas and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and it was the best ever.  I will try to lighten in up more next time with Splenda. Enjoy!

Made this recipe almost exactly (only added 1 tsp of cinnamon, per some other reviews). Very moist, but a little bland.. Might be a "5 star" recipe with a little more cinnamon or maybe some apples.. but overall, very good!

This recipe is awesome! I'm not an experienced baker but this was so easy. I can't believe this is low cal. I made slight modifications though. I left out the oil completely and just increased the applesauce. I also doubled the cinnamon (I love the stuff!) and added a pinch of nutmeg.  To make it even more healthy, I used 1cup white flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour. The only thing I did wrong was not properly mash the bananas so I got some chunks in the bread but it was still awesome. Next time I'll use the blender! Thanks for the recipe!

I only gave it 4 star because I changed up the recipe. I did not add the milk it called for. Instead I used to small light vanilla yogurts, 1/3Cup brown suger, 1/3Cup organic cane suger, 2Tbsp of wheat germ and a tbsp of cinnamon. I used the amount of eggs and flour the recipe called for. I also used a brownie pan and the temp and time called for this bread workout out great. The bread was really moist and had a cake like quality about it.......Very Yummy!! I will make this again and again. A nice after school snack for the kids and easy enough to change up depending on your taste or mood!

Our family loved this recipe! It was gone in about a day. I made some minor changes to the recipe. I used a mix of whole wheat and white flour, and also added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger. We also added sliced almonds throughout the batter, and topped the batter with some sliced almonds, touch of brown sugar and butter. Also, this bread tasted even better the next day!

I made this exactly like the recipe but instead of walnuts added 1/2 cup choc chips.  This did not taste low fat at all and was so moist.  Great recipe and my kids loved it too.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe turned out great! The key is mixing the sugar and butter for 5 minutes so it's not heavy. I added a pinch of cloves and cinnamon, 3/4 cup of white chocolate chips and sprinkled dried cranberries on top before baking. Yum!

Made this yesterday-the kids helped too. Very moist and tender. I baked it in a bundt and cut it in half/froze half after it cooled. One change for next time: I would add 1 more banana next tim for more oomph! I did give in to the kids begging and add chocolate chips and a pinch of cinnamon

I love this recipe. It uses applesauce instead of oil which dramatically cuts down on the fat and makes it much more healthy. I also added probably 2-3 tbsp of cinnamon and I also like to add a dash of cloves for taste. Overall, this recipe is quite wonderful.

the bread was nice and moist. I served it at Thanksgiving dinner and no one knew it was low fat. The bread was gone within a few minutes.

This was surprisingly good. I used 4 small bananas. To cut calories a bit more, I used 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of Splenda.  As suggested by others, I added spices...
1 t. cinnamon, 1/8 t. ginger, and 1/8 t. nutmeg. My family and guests enjoyed it without knowing it was 'dietized'. As a personal preference I also left out the walnuts.

Delicious. Also try replacing half of the sugar with Slenda granulated.

I will never make another banana bread recipe!!  Amazingly enough, this tasted so much better than my usual high-fat recipe!!  I doubled the recipe and put walnuts in one loaf and chocolate chips in the other.  Both are excellent.  I brought one loaf to work at everyone was raving about it.

Easy to make. Moist bread. Good, but not wonderful. Definitely can tell it is lower in fat.

This was an excellent low-fat banana bread. As I had several overripe bananas, I used three instead of two and added about 1 TBS additional sugar for a bit of a sweeter bread and it turned out well...moist, flavorful. Thank you for a good healthy quick bread.

Very nice recipe .. I added a little of butter and didn't have the apple sauce, so I added some plain white yogurt as one reviewer suggested. Added more walnuts than called for.  Turned out great.. a little crumbly, but still tasted good.

Great recipe!  Subbed chopped pecans for the walnuts because I was out ... We really enjoyed this bread and didn't miss the extra fat and calories at all.  This is my new standard banana bread recipe ... my boyfriend sliced it and put it in the toaster oven to crisp it up as a nice little bedtime snack.  Definite keeper!

This is perhaps the most moist banana bread I have ever made! Hard to believe it is low in fat. The only change I made was to add another 1/4 cup chopped walnuts because I prefer a nuttier banana bread. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was delicious!  I made 2 loaves... one with whole wheat flour and one with oat flour.  They both turned out really well!  The whole wheat tasted more "wholesome" and the oat flour tasted more sweet.  I also used 3 bananas with each and only a tsp. of vanilla.  I did not add walnuts since we do not like nuts in our breads.  Thanks for the low fat recipe!  I've been wanting to do it instead of using butter and I couldn't even tell that it was low fat!

I also used 3 bananas and it was perfect. The whole loaf disappeared the day I made it. Any recipe where you can cut down on fat and still get great results is a keeper in my book. This will be a regular in my kitchen

I do not like bananas but my husband loves this!  He doesn't even know it's lower in fat.  I wish I had of remembered to add cinnamon like some suggested.  I left the nuts out for my 2 year old.  Very moist!

I used the three bananas, some chocolate chips and added some cinnamon to this.  This is the third time I've made this bread in 2 weeks and every time it goes within 2 days and if someone doesn't get a piece, you can bet I have to hear about it later

before i made this bread i read some of the other comments. I reduced the vanilla to one teaspoon and used 3 small bananas. The bread turned out really good. It only needed to bake for about 45 minutes -- my oven heats pretty fast- and I think it was good enough to make again. I gave it 4 stars b/c it's good -- but maybe not the best i've ever had.

Really easy to make.  I replaced walnuts with chocolate chips so hopefully I didn't raise the calories that much.     I didn't mix them in though--I just spread them over the top of the bread before putting it in the oven. Aside from that I followed everything exactly and the bread came out well.  It tasted low cal to me (but my other banana bread recipe has honey and brown sugar in it) so it would probably satisfy the sweet tooth of many ppl.  It still tasted very good--had the texture more of cake than bread (as in I wouldn't speadcream cheese or peanut butter on it) --would def use this recipe again--a good one to make with kids b/c there are a lot of ingredients.

This banana bread was great! I took it to work and got TONS of compliments from my co-workers. I loved telling them that it was lower fat too! Ü I added an extra banana like some said. It was very moist and delicious. Now I can't wait for my bananas to turn so that I can make this again!

This is a good recipe - most and flavorful.  I used 3 bananas.  I think the measurement for the vanilla may be a little too much.  I could taste a little bit of vanilla/alcohol flavor in the bread.  One tablespoon vanilla seems like a lot to me.  I think next time I'll only use one teaspoon.

Delicious!  I tasted absolutely no difference between this low-fat recipe and regular banana bread.  This came out of the oven around 9pm and my husband, toddler, and I made it a yummy bedtime snack!  I will use this instead of my usual banana bread recipe.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to do (I made it in less than 15 min. in the morning before I went to have a shower. Then when I was ready to go to work, the banana bread was ready to cool down.  My family loved it.

I did some slight modifications, ie.  replaced the margarine with apple sauce, replaced the white sugar with brown sugar, added some crushed pralines and some low fat chocolate chips... The bread came out moist, delicious and soft.
