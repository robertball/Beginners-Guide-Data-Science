Been making these waffles for years. The texture is firm and denser than some, but easy, fast, and delicious flavor. Have experimented and used a variety of carbonated beverages in place of the club soda and most anything works well. They are not the recipe to use if attempting or have a Belgian waffle iron. Great the next day, warmed in a toaster for a snack!
