I first let the spices "merry" for 24 hours. After browning the roast, I cook it using apple cider beer in the pressure cooker and served it with spatzle and cooked apples.  Skim fat and reduce liquid for gravy. It's wonderful and is now my husband's favorite pork roast recipe.

I cooked my roast in the crockpot and it turned out great.  The gravy was also pretty tasty.

After years of unsuccessfully trying to duplicate a traditional Bohemian Pork Roast with gravy & dumplings Christmas dinner I had with a family of Bohemian ancestry back in the early 1970's, I stumbled across this recipe.  I prepared it this Christmas along with gravy made from the pan juices and Spaetzle.  My quest for the perfect Christmas Pork Roast from my past has now been ended. The only change I made to the original recipe was the addition of garlic powder in the rub.  It was a huge hit with my family and I thank you so much for helping perfect my Christmas dinner.  I will use this recipe for the rest of my life and hopefully pass it on to my children.

An easy to make, melt-in-your mouth, moist and delicious pork roast.  Did make the gravy and it was wonderful!

I grew up in the aforementioned town of Cicero and this recipe is right on the money! A taste of the sadly disappearing Bohemian restaurants found on the Cermak Road of my youth.

I followed the recipe except after browning the roast, I removed it from the pan and added the caraway seed with 1/2 cup of water, simmered it down and then wrapped the juice with the roast in tinfoil and put it on the grill for 2 hours.  This was the best pork that I have ever eaten.  We put some corn on the cob, unshucked on the grill which was a nice meal idea.  This winter I will try it in the oven.

This was excellent.  We served it with Potato Dumplings (my oma's recipe); German Green Beans; applesauce; gravy; sauerkraut; and, of course, a good German beer.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a fan of caraway seeds so I'm not sure why I made this.  Something different, I guess.  DH liked it better than I did.  Just too "caraway-ie" for me.

VERY good flavor, and my husband absolutely loved it. Used beer, rather than water, which I'd seen in another recipe, and only about 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds. Made gravy with the liquid in the pan, which was awesome over mashed potatoes. Also served with cabbage, as we Poles love our cabbage. Thank you for this recipe! The caraway & marjoram mix is awesome!

I loved this dish prepared from my Grandmother and at a Berwyn restaurant that had served this with dumplings, gravy, and red cabbage. Roast Pork and Roast Duck are two of my fall czech favorite dishes.

I liked it.  The herb combination was excellent, and may use it on fish or chicken.  I cooked in a crockpot and placed the herbs right on it.  Wow, the gravy was excellent!

very good, very moist. I do use a little less caraway seed to suit everyone's tastes in my house.  Flavorful but not overly seasoned, we love this recipe.

We really enjoyed this.  I only used about 1T of the caraway seeds, I didn't have more, but I partially crushed them to help spread their essence.

I made this in the slow cooker, but otherwise pretty much as written, and I love the simplicity! The flavors were amazing! Browned the Boston butt in a cast iron pan, then plopped it in the slow cooker on low. Deglazed the pan with some water, and threw that in too, then brought the water level up to halfway up the roast. I thought I had marjoram, but I was out, so I used a spicy home grown oregano that was pretty close. Added a bit more oregano to the roast water as well, since I love oregano. We had some errands to to, so it probably cooked for about 6 hours on low. House smelled amazing, the gravy from the juices was amazing, and it was so tender we didn't need knives, and my 2yo loved it! Thanks for such a great simple recipe! Definitely a keeper! :-)

I use a center-cut pork loin roast in a covered roasting pan, 325 or 350 oven, first sprinkle garlic salt all over the meat, then lots of caraway seeds. Roast covered for 2 or more hrs. depending on size of roast, till meat is well-done.  Remove cover, allow to continue roasting till much of the fluid is reduced, & there is a good amt. browned stuff on bottom of pan. Remove meat, keep warm.  Add water to roasting pan to loosen browned stuff on bottom, then restore the liquid by slowly adding hot water & stirring to dissolve all the browned stuff on the bottom of the pan. This is the gravy to serve on the dumplings! Enjoy!  PS: I am of Bohemian ancestry on both sides of my family!

I was leery because I'm not a huge fan of caraway seed & this seemed like a lot, but I decided to try it anyway. We all loved it. Great flavor! Even my somewhat picky father ate it well.

Very tender and tasty.  Marinated overnight like others suggested and used a crock pot.  Made gravy and served with spaetzle.  New family favorite.

I followed the directions up through the part where it browned the meat in a pan. Then I put the roast in my slow cooker. I deglazed the pan with 1/2c Killian's Irish Red -dumped it in with the roast and caraway seeds and I cooked it for 6hrs on low. Truly wonderful, simple recipe - thanks for sharing.

I made this yesterday and my husband (who prefers beef roasts to pork) has already told me how good it was for lunch and can't wait to eat leftovers tonight. The only changes I made were I used a boneless pork butt roast, reduced the amount of caraway seeds, and added garlic powder. I browned the roast on all sides before cooking in the crockpot on low for about 8-9 hours. It was so tender and flavorful. I also made a gravy that was delicious over the pork and mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again!
