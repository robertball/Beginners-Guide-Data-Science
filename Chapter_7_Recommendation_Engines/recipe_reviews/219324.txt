I used a mixture of EVOO and butter to brown the rice in. I used organic chicken broth in this recipe and I omitted the additional salt called for in this recipe. I cooked this whole recipe in my cast iron skillet. I cannot tell you how many times I've burned rice in my normal sauce pans on my gas stove--cooking it in my cast iron skillet was cake. Not one single problem. My family enjoyed this rice--my youngest boy asked for a second helping which he NEVER does. I'll make this again.

I liked this recipe a lot and my husband's jaw dropped when I took the cover off the pan (and loved the taste too!).  I am giving it only four stars because I thought it was a bit too salty (I would cut the salt to 1 tsp at the most) and I used only about 1 cup of MJ cheese, which was plenty.  Lastly, I used brown rice instead of white rice and, other than the fact that I needed to cook the rice about 20 min longer, it tasted great!  Definitely a keeper!  Made it with the "Chicken Chimichangas with Sour Cream Sauce" on this website and my husband was very happy!

This tasted very authentic to what we get in our local Mexican restaurant.  I made exactly as the recipe stated, but, only used 1 tsp of salt based on other reviewer's suggestions.   I also left off the monterey jack cheese just to save on a few calories, but, I am sure it would be wonderful with it!

This was such a quick dish to whip up last minute and oh so yummy. I made a few changes due to not having exact ingredients on hand. Instead of tomato sauce and green chiles separate, I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. I used low sodium organic broth and added no additional salt. I cut the cheese to 1 cup and used a colby/jack blend. Paired it with black beans,spicy carnitas and fresh corn. My family devoured it! Will definitely be making this rice again and again.

This was good but WAAAAAY too salty.  I would definitely suggest cutting it down to 1/2 t of salt to start with.  You can always add more but it's hard to take it out :).  Otherwise though, I really liked it.  It cooked up faster than 25 minutes for me, so FYI...stir frequently so it doesn't burn and you can keep an eye on it.

I am really puzzled by the reviews on this. When I was adding the ingredients, I thought, "Hmm, that's a lot of liquid for one cup of rice," but since nobody else had mentioned a problem with that, I ran with it. Forty minutes later - I used brown rice - I picked up the lid and discovered half-cooked rice soup! This dish needed to cook for a full hour to absorb all the liquid, and even then it was soggy. A normal rice-to-water ratio is 1:2 and this, including the tomato sauce, was almost 1:3. The fact that I'm the only person who had this problem, including other people who used brown rice, makes me think that I did something wrong, but I really did follow the recipe as written. Dinner was well over by the time the rice was done cooking (luckily I had a backup) and when it finally wasn't soup anymore, the flavors were nice. But there are so many mexican rice recipes out there, I'll look for one I don't have to modify so much. Sorry!

Used this with brown rice and came out really good. Took a little more cooking time.

Great Mexican rice dish to serve with your Mexican entree.  However, here is how to make it in ONLY 15 MINUTES- use two cups of cooked white rice. I freeze 2 or 4 cup bags when I make white rice. Add oil to sauce pan, I use olive oil, then add cumin and chili powder, bloom spices(cook until release their fragrance)for a minute or so, add garlic onion cook until clear.  Then add a 10z. can drained can of Rotel tomatoes w/cilantro and lime juice and 4 oz. of tomato sauce.  Stir until mixed and warm...in no time.  I don't add any salt and it tastes find.  I also save calories by not adding cheese.  Enjoy!

I agree what another said, waaaaaayyyy to salty.  I wish I would've seen that review before I made it.  The flavor is fantastic, I will definitely make it again, just without the extra salt.

Amazing! Cooked exactly as written and couldn't be better. The chiles really make the recipe. Don't leave them out! This recipe is definitely better than my favorite Mexican restaurant's rice.

Very good recipe!!! I will definitely make it again. I used less salt and cheese, and had to substitute 3 oz tomato paste instead of sauce (didn't have it in my pantry). I may make it a main dish by adding chicken, corn and black beans to it.

Loved this recipe, and tasted authentic Mexican rice I eat at the local Mexican restaurant!  I made minor modification based on the items on hand and stuff.  With vegetable oil, I sautéed garlic & dried onion (didn't have fresh!), and then, added rice as noted in the original recipe.  I didn't have green chilies, so I added cilantro from my backyard about 2-3 table spoons.  Cut the salt to 1 TS and added small amount of pepper, no chili powder, so added 1/4 TS caraway seeds.  Also used cream cheese and velveeta 4oz each as those were all cheeses I had in my refrigerator.  Other than that, I followed original recipe.  Adding cilantro turned out great which added some Mexican flavor, and together with caraway, gave a nice "extra flavor" that would have been missed without chilies in it.  Loved the taste of melted cream cheese on top of the rice.  Our local Mexican restaurant uses sauce made with sour cream and cream cheese, so it tasted a bit reminder of local Mexican restaurant, which I enjoyed :)

This recipe is quite delicious. I substituted brown rice, and that about doubles the cook time. I added 1/2tsp. of salt (plenty, imo), and I used probably closer to 2c. of cheese, because I love cheese. Will definitely make again.

Very Very good!  I agree with the salt (only used half), but I could see how the recipe includes that, as I'm sure every mexican joint in town uses even more salt than that!  Used this rice in a black bean burrito and it was spot on.  Definitly the most tasty long grain rice recipe I have ever made.

First off I followed this recipe exactly & it was so EASY to make & it turned out FABULOUS!!!  The flavors that are in this rice are spot on but then when I put the cheese on top of the rice just before it's finished cooking, well it DEFINITELY raised THIS recipe to 5 stars & what a brilliant idea! My entire family, including my husband of 28 years just can't get enough of this rice.  And even though this recipe makes a lot of rice, now when I make this recipe, I go on & double all the ingredients & it STILL turns out GREAT!! For years I had been searching for an AMAZING Mexican rice recipe that's also easy on all kinds of websites & in all sorts of cookbooks, but with no avail. Then I went on "AllRecipe.com & immediately found this recipe & now there's no turning back!! Thank you so much for posting this EASY & VERY TASTY recipe!  
Oh, one more thing, it's even more FABULOUS if after it's done cooking & IF no one in my family  realizes that I have made it, then cover the top of the pan & try putting the entire pan in the fridge overnight.  This will let all the flavors marry together overnight & then when your ready to serve it,  just heat it up in your microwave & when it's warm, I'll add a bit more cheese to each serving. But when I want to do it this way, I'll have to wait & make it after everyone is asleep, otherwise I'll wake up the next morning to find most of it has already been eaten since it's even WONDERFUL cold!!  
Thanks Again!

My girlfriend and I made this for my family, it was a massive hit! like others have said the recipe calls for a little to much chicken broth. We used 3/4 chicken broth of what the recipe called for. We ever so slightly caramelized the onions which really cut the flavors nicely. I highly recommend this dish.

This was great and quick to make. I did not have a small can of tomato sauce so I used a can of rotel diced tomatoes & green chilies. I doubled the chili powder and cumin and used half the cheese and half the salt.

This simple recipe is delicious.  I didn't think tomato sauce and a few back up ingredients could pull it off, but they did.  My only deviation was the addition of a 2 tbls. diced jalapenos.  I chose to turn this recipe into a "casserole".  I made the dish the day before, placed it in a casserole dish, added the jack cheese on top, placed it in the fridge, and baked it the next day.  This is the perfect/go to mexican rice dish.

Yummy!! I decided to whip this up with stuff I had around the kitchen. I didn't have any tomato sauce or green chiles, so I substituted 3/4 cups of my favorite salsa in place of those two ingredients. Turned out wonderful! I agree with one of the other reviewers about it being very salty, so I recommend cutting the salt in half, too.

Based on another review, I added an additional 1/2 c rice, to avoid soupy rice.  Not sure if that was really necessary.  Also subbed Rotel for tomato sauce and green chilis.  This Rice was delicious, the whole family LOVED it, will be making again.

This is a perfect side dish for any Mexican meal!  I reduce the chicken broth to two cups (or one 15 oz can) and increase the tomato sauce to an 8 oz can since that is the more common size I find at the store.   I have even made this when I don't have onion, green chilies or monterey jack on hand and it is still delicious!

My family loved this rice so much, and my guests asked to take some home. I did increase the recipe by 50% and increased most ingredients to 1.5. except I used a whole 7 oz. can of green chilis  and a whole 6 oz. can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce. Additionally, increasing to 1.5 requires 3.75 cups of broth and two typical 15 oz. size cans were exactly that. I will make this again and again. Thank you for the great recipe!

Very tasty and flavorful. Everyone enjoyed it. I did do 1 TSP butter and 2 TSP oil. Plus, I sautéed the onions and garlic with the rice. Turned out great. I tried other recipes and this is by far the best I’ve had/made.

Delicious! Only made two small tweaks:  Based on others' reviews I cut the salt in half and it was still pretty salty IMO; next time I'd use low-salt broth too. And purely for personal taste, we added a small can of sweet corn and about 8 oz of black beans; might also add a bit of diced red pepper next time too. Definitely will be a go-to side dish for us.

Used my cast iron pan, which lended itself to a tiny bit of cooking modifications. After the initial browning of the rice, It took only 15 minutes for the rice to cook tender, with the liquid amount the recipe stated. FYI Didn't have tomato sauce so I used 4 oz of uncondensed tomato soup.
For those who questioned- I had NO issue with liquid to rice ratio...

9.25.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/219324/my-favorite-mexican-rice/ ... 'Pretty disappointed, but I did sub water for the broth & yes, I'm sure the broth would make it better..  'Kinda bland.  I tasted & added some cilantro & jalapenos.  Ohhhh, I didn't add the tomato sauce.  I'm not much of a fan of rice & tomatoes together.   Maybe this is an unfair rating, but I don't see it being worth a repeat.

Definitely will become a staple for my home Mexican meals.  With changes.  Reviews commented a lot on the saltiness.  I tried two large pans to serve at a shelter.  The better of the two consisted of 3 cups rice and maybe 1/2tsp of salt.  Toasted the rice with about 3-4TBS of oil and half stick of butter.  

Subbed tomato sauce for one 14oz can of diced tomatoes.  2x 8oz cans of green chilies.  1/2, 12oz  can sweet corn, 1x  14oz can of black beans.  Roughly one large white onion, and topped it all with a generous helping of Monterrey Jack Cheese.  I made this the night before my event and refrigerated overnite.   Warmed it up on site and then topped with freshly topped cilantro.  Over 70 people served with two batches of this and everyone raved about it.

I made this and it was very good. I would like  a little more tomato taste, but no other issues. I did like one reviewer said and cooked it in my iron skillet  as I have a gas stove. Mine took more like 40 minutes to cook.

Made this to go with fajitas.  The only substitutes I used were salsa for tomato sauce. I had none. And fresh roasted chilies instead of canned.  Loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. It is in my saved file.  Thank you for sharing.

I have made this several times and love it more each time. It is one of my daughter's favorites too. So much so, one year we made it for her Spanish class...and it was her FIRST HOUR class. That says a lot to have for breakfast. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

We will definitely be making this again! I served it when we had company over for dinner (along with black bean tacos and chicken fajitas)---each person at the table commented about how good it was.  I didn't change a thing --- used the recipe as-is.  I highly recommend you try this out!

Turned out perfect.  Prepared it in the morning so it would be ready for dinner.  Just reheated it and added the cheese.  I did add the juice from the green chilies and used about 6 ounces of tomato sauce as I was concerned the dish would be dry after reheating.   I would make it the same again.

I completely did this wrong the first time doing it, I omitted the cumin and onion halted the garlic and boiled the rice and added it to the whole mixture. It was all really an accident, it turned out a bit soupy. But I made chicken enchiladas as well. I put a picante sauce mixture over some chicken and topped it with the rice. And baked in the oven for 40 minutes! A week later my husband begged me to do it again! :)

This has a really good flavor.  Two things I would like to mention---a small can of tomato sauce is 7 or 8 ounces---this recipes calls for 4 ounces so just use 1/2 of the can.  Also, I used only 2 cups of chicken broth and if I were to make it again would use less.  It is too soupy.  I made it in the morning and let it sit all day uncovered--that helped.  Also added about a cup of corn.

I made this to go with chile rellenos. Since those are stuffed with cheese and deep-fried, I opted not to put shredded cheese on top of this rice. Instead of the canned peppers, I used 2 roasted poblano peppers diced. Delicious!!!

Did not taste like Mexican rice.  Ended up going to Mexican restraunt to get my rice.  Wouldn't waste my time or money on this recipe again.

My family loved this! The only thing I changed was I used brown rice instead of white. I microwaved the brown rice for 10 minutes then skipped the "toasting part" then cooked following the recipe. It was amazing!

Fabulous! I will never make boxed Mexican rice again.  We enjoyed it for several nights and it just seemed to get better and better.  I finished it in a casserole dish and put the cheese on top and put it in the oven to let the cheese melt.

Amazing recipe!!! I've made this many times and my husband always tells me how much he loves this. Last time I made it I did not have the green chilis (thought I had some but didn't) so I added some jarred diced jalapeño. It was even better!!! Thank you for such an easy and great recipe!!!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe but omitted the green chili and added a can of Rotel instead... Plus I added corn and black beans right before the cheese. Excellent!

This rice is a staple in my house. My DS LOVES Spanish rice and this one is always 2 thumbs up with him! I use chicken bullion and skip the extra salt. But I would add those spices/onions after I fried the rice, JUST BEFORE you add the broth, simply to give those spices a minutes to Bloom and become fragrant, THEN add the liquid.

I didn't add salt for health reasons and I didn't have any cumin but will get some for next time as it wasn't as spicy as I'd hoped. I added some chipotle sauce in lieu and a package of pre-cooked chicken to make it more a complete meal. I thought it was a little mushy so will go with just 2 cups of broth next time and see if that helps. Also used 1 cup of Mexican blend cheese as that's what I had on hand. Overall enjoyed it and will most certainly have it again. Thanks!

Salty...  Will cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon next time.  Also, could probably cut back the oil to 2 tablespoons.  That seemed like a LOT after I poured it into the pot. Please use white rice unless you are prepared to let brown rice cook a VERY LONG TIME.  The final cooking time for this dish in a brown rice version took me about 90 minutes (about 30 minutes longer than standard brown rice).  However, I had the time to let it cook and everyone in my extended family really liked it.  I will definitely make this again - with WHITE rice and less salt.  Thank you for sharing this delicious side dish.

I've never had any luck making Mexican rice. I used this recipe and omitted the cheese. Good flavor! I adjusted the rice to 1-1/2c and used 1/2T (1-1/2t) of salt, adjusted the stock and sauces accordingly. Very happy w/recipe and is the best one I've made todate (I'm still hoping to find a 5* recipe).

Delicious! This was exactly what I wanted to go with a mexican dish I was making for dinner. I didn't think it was too salty at all. Those that said they thought it was probably just don't eat mexican food very often. There's not many things more disappointing to a Texan than bland mexican food. I did have to cook mine a little longer than directed, but I think that could be because my skillet doesn't have its own lid so I had to use a baking sheet which didn't really close in the heat as well. I'll definitely make this again.

I left out the cumin because I don't like it & added serrano chiles cause that's what I had on hand. I used 2 c chicken broth & 1/2 c water. Sauteed garlic w/the rice when browning.  It was easy and tasted good, but a little on the dry side. Will add more broth next time. Will make again. Thanks for posting.

I forgot to add the green chiles, and used less salt (still a little salty), but this is a great recipe, nice and mild, perfect to accompany the chicken ranch tacos I made!  Thank you!
