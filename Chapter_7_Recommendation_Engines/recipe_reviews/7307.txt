This is a great recipe, but if this is your first time making cheesecake some of the basics are assumed.  A couple of notes for "first-timers"... make sure you read the Cheesecake Tips section of this board.  This recipe doesn't tell you some of the cheesecake fundamentals like 1) Make sure your cream cheese is at room temp before you start  2)Your batter should be smooth and silky.  If it is lumpy your cheesecakes will turn out badly.  If needed, throw the batter in a blender/food processor to get rid of the lumps  3)You do NOT want to wait for your cheesecakes to crack before removing them from the oven.  They are done before they crack, when the center is still soft.

After I learned these lessons, the recipe turned out well!

These are delicious as is, but I made three different flavors using this batter with tremendous success and professional GOURMET looking results!
White Chocolate Red Raspberry: mixed 1/2 cup melted white chocolate into 1/3 of the batter, swirled 1/4 cup raspberry coulis into batter before fillig muffin cups and once baked I topped each with 1/2 teaspoon warmed seedless raspberry jam and drizzled melted white chocolate over the tops.
Chocolate Chip - substituted crushed oreos for nilla wafers, added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to 1/3 of batter, once baked topped with 1/2 teaspoon chocolate ganache.
Cherry Almond - substituted graham cracker crumbs for nilla wafers, added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 1/3 batter and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to cherry pie filling.  Once baked, topped each with 1 teaspoon sweetened sour cream topping (1/2 cup sour cream + 2 tbsp sugar + 1/2 teas vanilla extract) 2-3 cherries and sliced almond.
Feel free to email me at mpcharvat@yahoo.com for coulis, ganache or any other info.  Thanks!

For those of you wanting a different base, use 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 8 tbls margarine and 8 tbl sugar. Mix wel with hands, press +/- a tablespoon into mini  muffin papers, top with cream cheese filling and fruit. Will work like a charm!

I give this a 5 for the ingredients, but for me, these steps work better: I use regular muffin tins and I just put a vanilla wafer (flat side down) in the paper cup.  First, I whip the softened cream cheese until it is light and fluffy.  Then I gradually add the two eggs and vanilla and sugar at the end.  The mix seems to be very runny, but it turns out perfectly.  It takes longer to cook; I just keep an eye on the cheesecakes after about 20 minutes.

This recipe is AWESOME. i doubled it and used oreo crumbs instead of wafers. i  mixed all the abtter and i omitted vanilla extract. whn the batter was smooth i separated it itnto 3 bowls. to one bowl i added 2 tbls of creme de menthe, to the other bowl i added 2 tbls bailey's irish cream, to the last bowl i added 2 tbls Kahluah cofee liquer. i thought that i had maybe ruined the recipe by adding too much liquid, but it was PERFECT. i baked them for exactly 15 mins, they didnt crak and i took tem out right awy. rmeebr, these are just little guys, they dont need to sit in the oven and firm up like a big cheesecake. if you over cook them their creamy texture will disappear!
once they cooled, i added melted dark choc to the top of each one and to the kahluah ones i added a choc covered coffee bean, to the mint one si sprinkled crushed candy canes, and to the irish ones i added a green M&M.
Oh yes! i almost forgot
I used 2 cups of the choc cookie crumbs to which i added 4 tbls melted butter.
ALSO: leave your cream cheese out of the friegde for a good 4 hours b4 u start. i put mine beside the water heater to speed things up!!
use a MIXER...blend and blend and blend..mix all the cream cheese up until its super silky, THEN add the sugar, THEN after that add each egg one at a time
don't just plop it all in together.
exxxxxxxxxxcellent.

My mom used to make these for me every birthday.  The only thing that I do differently: I keep the vanilla wafers whole.  that leaves a good crust on the bottom and keeps it from crumbling.  These taste SO GOOD.  They are easy to make and a wonderful treat.

Fabulous recipe!  So simple!  I have only made plain cheesecakes one time.   I have altered the recipe to make white chocolate raspberry, carmel, peanut butter, turtle, and strawberry.  I am getting very creative w/flavors and will someday have a list to rival the Cheesecake Factory! : )

I used fresh fruit for the raspberry and then preserves for the strawberry.  I find the ones w/fruit take about twice as long to bake.  The peanut butter has probably been the biggest hit out of all the flavors!  I just made the plain, peanut butter, turtle, and strawberry for a wedding reception (I made about 200 of them).  They were gobbled up within moments!  This recipe is definately a keeper!  

Some tips- 
I've used both the little mini muffin pans and normal muffin pans.  I prefer mini, but I think it really helps if you use muffin liners.  I used a water bath the 2nd time I used this recipe, and am not sure if it made a difference, except by making my oven feel 4 times hotter!  I'd like to think it made a difference, so I will do it again.  Garnishing these little bite sized beauties really sets them off and it's also very fun!  You can't go wrong w/this recipe.  

Please let me know if anyone wants details on the specific flavors I used and how I made them.  Happy baking!

This is an easy, fun recipe for cheesecake, but it needs more precision.  There are two sizes of "mini" pan liners:  1 5/8" and 2". Half the recipe makes 24 mini cheesecakes in my mini muffin (tassie) pans.  Half the recipe makes 16 individual cheesecakes in 2" liners, freestanding on a baking sheet. I used about 8 vanilla wafers to make crumbs for the mini size and about 16 for the individual size.  In a 2" pan liner you can drop in a whole wafer instead.

Quick and easy.  You can cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and add 1 tbsp. of lemon juice to the cheese mixture if desired.

My husband made these last year and this year for our holiday party.  Everyone loves them! We do half the recipe as is and the other half with mini chocolate chips. To save time we buy the graham cracker crumbs for the plain cheesecakes with cherry, and Oreo crumbs for the chocolate chip ones.

Easy recipe for your basic cheesecake filling. previous reviewers make an important notation when doing any type of cheesecake filling to include this recipe. Cream cheese needs to be at room temp. Put in mixing bowl and beat cream cheese by itself for about 4 minutes. It will be smooth and creamy, fluffy looking. THEN add the sugar, fist 1/2 cup and beat for about 3 mins. Taste. If you like it sweeter, add 1/4 c and beat about 3 more mins. Taste. If the creamed filling tastes kinda gritty from the sugar beat another 2 mins. You want the sugar blended into cream cheese really well. THEN add one egg, beat for 1 min, add second egg and beat for 1 min. Third egg is not neccessary. Omit vanilla. Use 1 tsp of lemon juice instead and beat for 2 mins. Taste. You may want an additional tsp of lemon juice depending on the taste you are looking for. At this point your filling should be really fluffy and smooth. If it's not beat for another 2 to 3 mins on med high speed. It will fluff. Use whatever crust you want but bind it with melted butter and lightly press into cups. I used regular cupcake pan and baked for 20 mins. Cool for about 20 mins after cooking. With a small teaspoon spoon out a small amount of cheesecake from center of  filling, creating a hole. Spoon in any pie filling you desire, lemon, cherries, stwberry, blberry, rasberry, ect. Put in fridge for several hours before serving.

Way back in the '70s a co-worker brought these to a Christmas potluck. This recipe was new back then, of course, and everyone marveled just at the sight of them! One bite and we were all hooked. Once she shared the recipe we were all so surprised at how easy they were to make! These are so pretty, so easy, and just delicious. No need to crush the vanilla wafers if you use a standard muffin tin-- just drop a whole wafer in each cup. Over the years I've put my creative juices to work for endless variations...Oreo cookies or other cookies for the crust, lime juice or different extracts for the cheesecake filling, or chocolate and caramel sauce, fresh fruit and glaze for the topping, etc. These come together in mere minutes, are foolproof, and impressive on a beautiful serving platter.

These were PERFECT!  I used a regular sized muffin tin and got about 16 cheesecakes.  I also used graham crackers for the crust. (only needed about 1 cup of crumbs) I made half of these regualr and half chocolate (with a chocolate graham cracker crust) by adding 3 oz of melted dark chocolate chips to half of the batter.  They were so good I was afraid to try a regular one for fear of disappointment.  But the regular ones were just as good.  Baked about 17 minutes and then turned the oven off and left them in for another 30.  No cracks and didn't fall at all.  Topped with fresh sliced strawberries.  They were a total hit and I will definitely make again!

I can't believe how wonderfully these turned out!  It was my first chance to make cheesecake of any type, and now I can't wait to try for the real thing.  

I followed other reviews and made my crust out of 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1 stick melted butter, and 8 tablespoons sugar.  I put about a half tablespoon in each liner.  They baked up beautifully, and were really easy!  

I made 2 batches of 48 mini cheesecakes each. I left 24 plain, topped 24 with strawberry pie filling, 24 with blueberry pie filling, and then did 24 with chopped pecans, mini chocolate chips, and drizzled caramel over the top.  I used the Kraft caramel bits.  So easy and the looked great!

These were pretty easy and tasted very good! I made them for a tea party and they were a big hit! They freeze great too - just freeze them after they cool and then you can top them hours before serving & keep them cool in the fridge.

Delicious and so simple!  I followed the recipe given (using single mini-Nilla wafers as the crust in each) and added 1/2 cup melted white chocolate chips to the batter.  Poured the batter into a Ziploc bag and cut a small "tip" in one corner...this made portioning the batter very easy and no mess!  Topped each cake with a bit of seedless raspberry preserves.  They were devoured at my family Christmas party!

It was so easy to make and it was completed in such a short time!! I used oreo cookies instead of the wafers, ommitted the vanilla extract to suit the whole chocolate theme, and used M&Ms as topping. You just have to make sure that the batter is smooth and silky when done. Also, remember to blend the cream cheese (Room temperature please! Not fresh from the fridge!!) first, THEN add the sugar, THEN the eggs one at a time (Don't throw them in all at once). Try not to have any lumps of cheese left unblended. When baking, set the baking tray in another tray of BOILING HOT water (Hence the baking time remains the same) so that the base of the crust won't be burnt! You can also line the tray of water with a thick cloth. (Make sure the water doesn't overflow into your tray of cakes!) Finally remember not to overbake these little ones! Bake til set; the centre will still be soft though. Then you can switch off the oven and let them cook further in the remaining heat. Those are the main points for me but you can read all about it in the tips for cooking cheesecakes. My colleagues loved them...Great recipie!! =)

Use The Mini Nilla Wafers which fit perfectly in the mini pan with pretty paper for Christmas. Put in flat side down. Used room temp cream cheese and did exactly as written with vanilla. Used a zip lock bag cut to fill. No mess no fuss. Cooked at 350 for 15 minutes, no water bath, they were puffy and adorable and then sank when I took them out. THIS IS NORMAL FOR A CHEESECAKE. They came out PERFECT!! When you pull the paper off the nilla wafer is stuck to the cheesecake not the paper. Love not having to mess with any kind of crumbs. LOVE those mini nilla wafers. Top with cherries. HAve a double choc mini cup brownie these would look terrific with. Anyone can make these!! WONDERFUL!! FAst and wonderful, mini chips IN the batter would also be terrific.

I followed someone else's suggestions and did the following.  I used oreo crumbs instead of wafers. i mixed all the batter and i omitted vanilla extract. whn the batter was smooth i separated it into 2 bowls. to one bowl i added 1 tbl of creme de menthe and green food coloring, to the other bowl i added 1 tbl bailey's irish cream. i baked them for exactly 15 mins i took tem out right away. They're small and if you over cook them their creamy texture will disappear! I used 1 cup of the choc cookie crumbs to which i added 2 tbls melted butter.
 ALSO: leave your cream cheese out of the fridge for a good 4 hours before you start or slightly microwave. Use a MIXER...blend and blend and blend..mix all the cream cheese up until its super silky, THEN add the sugar, THEN after that add each egg one at a time. Don't just plop it all in together.

I found Mini Vanilla Wafers that are the perfect size for the mini muffin tins, no crushing the wafers.

Oh dang...these are awesome. I made them for Thanksgiving munchies and all I heard was how everyone was gonna get fat. Addictive. I altered the recipe by using cinnamon graham cacker/butter/sugar crust and for half of the batch it was pumpkin cheesecake (added half a 15oz.can pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spices) and the other half became the most wonderful carmel pecan cheesecake bites ever. (same crust, top crust with caramel ice cream topping and chopped pecans, add the cheesecake filling and once baked and cooled sprinkle a couple more chopped pecans and drizzle with caramel). Freaking rediculous. Watch out.

I've been making these for years.  Except my recipe calls for 1/2 c. sugar.  And I make them in the normal size cupcake pans which ends up making 24.  We prefer that to the mini because you get more of a cheesecake cookie instead of a sampler.  Also, it's just as easy to put a whole wafer cookie in the bottom vs. crumbs.  DON'T do as the video does by putting your filling on the top before you take them out of the pan.  That can only be MESSY.  I put mine in a container, store them in the frig. and put the pie filling on top before serving. Also, beat real good the cream cheese by itself, then beat it again when adding sugar and vanilla.  Then beat again when adding the eggs.  You will love the results of the batter.  I find 18 minutes is done in my gas stove/oven.  Hope you can utilize my tips.

This recipe is wonderful! I used a few of the variations that I read in other reviews: ****** Peanut Butter - 1/4 of the batch of cheesecake batter, 2 tbs peanut butter, added three peanut butter chips to the top after I pulled them from the oven but while they were still hot, and drizzled melt chocolate on top after cooled ****** Almond - 1/4 batter - 1/2 teas almond extract in batter, 1/2 teas almond extract on some cherry pie filling, bake and when cool add cherries to the top ****** Chocolate - 1/4 cheesecake batter, I did not measure the cocoa powder or the melted chocolate (melted chips in the microwave) but added it little by little until batter had a nice medium brown color, drizzled white chocolate and milk choclate on top after cooled. ****** Chocolate Chip - I just took the regular batter and after I filled the muffin pan I added some mini choclate chips on top and baked ****** I did use a graham cracker crust for all of them (2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 8 tbl melted butter, 8 tbl sugar and mix) but next time I am going to try a oreo crust on the peanut butter and the choclate ones. ****** They did stick alittle to the paper liners so I will try tin foil type liners next time so I can remove the liners for presentation. I am also excited to try and make a turtle cheesecake type next round!     Thanks for the wonderful recipe! It was a major hit in the office!

I bought a premade chocolate cookie crust (on sale cheap) and crumbled it into the muffin cups instead of using cookies.  Before baking, I put a tablespoon of jam or melted chocolate on top of each cheesecake and swirled it through with a toothpick.  They looked professional and tasted fantastic!

Tasty and delicious! My boyfriend could not stop eating the! They were easy enough to make, being that it was my first time attempting "cheesecake." I made sure that my cream cheese was room temperature and that my batter was lump-free but not overbeat. I read that I should use a "water bath" for better results. Hmm. Tried it and I think it made a difference, cooked more evenly and they did not poof up. But, I felt like the batter was pretty runny still so I put them back in the oven for another 5 minutes. Took them out, chilled them and ta-da! Perfection. With my second batch I used no water bath and put them in for 20 minutes and they puffed up and sank a little in the middle. But, still delicious! I'm still learning, one day soon I shall master "cheesecake." In the meantime, my boyfriend's gonna keep eating them anyway!! And so will I! Thanks for this great recipe.

It tastes delicious, but for them to come out just right, I had to follow these tips: 1.) If using foil muffin liners (regular size, as I don't have a mini muffin pan), bake for only 11-12 minutes max, any longer and the cheesecakes start to crack. 2.) Make sure cream cheese is at room temp. Then, whip cream cheese first to smooth, silky texture, no lumps. Then mix all other ingredients in separate bowl. Then gradually blend into cream cheese. 3.) I wanted a graham cracker crust - 2 cups crackers (2 pkgs), 8 T butter, 8 T sugar. Mix with hands. 4.) 1 heaping T of crust at bottom of cups, then pressed; then fill about 1/2 way - 3/4 way up with the cream cheese batter.

Excellent cheesecakes. Why use a more complicated recipe when these turn out so well?

They're easy to personalize, too.

I divided the main cheesecake mix into smaller bowls and made the following flavors for holiday gifts:

Hot chocolate-I added a packet of hot cocoa mix to the batter, then after it was baked I added a dab of marshmallow fluff to the top and sprinkled it with some more powder for looks. Used a graham cracker crust.

Candy Cane- Used a chocolate graham cracker crust. After baking, I sprinkled crushed candy can bits on top.

Reese's PB cup- Using a choc grahm cracker base, I mixed half and half PB and cheesecake mix and baked. They baked faster than the others, so if you try this keep an eye on them. Also, the finish doesn't look as nice cause it doesn't smooth out while cooking, but it tastes great! It's disguised easily by drizzling with some melted chocolate.

Butterfinger- Crushed up some Butterfinger and sprinkled it on top of "plain" cheesecakes.

Wow.  What a hit!  This was my first cheesecake endeavor and I went out on a limb and made it for a party of 11 for Christmas.  They devoured the cakes.  I used full size cups, so one recipe only makes around 15 with a little bit left over.  I ended up making around 45.  Don't be afraid as I was when they come out of the oven nice and tall and drop to half their size after cooling.  They look pretty rough after cooling, so just don't serve them without topping.  Yummy.

Oh my goodness, are these ever delicious!!  I made them for a party of fifty with ages ranging from 8-55.  These were the easiest things to make!  I loved the vanilla wafer crust.  I also used a pastry bag to put the mixture into the little cups.  Everyone was shocked that I went to such extremes on these.  All night long I kept hearing, "cheesecakes...did you try those cheesecakes...those were the best cheesecakes...” I set out recipe cards on the table and only returned home with one.  Thank you so much for this 5 star recipe!!

Oh my gosh!! To die for!! But one glitch..I really hate to add suggestions others recipes because it's not mine to change but one the cream cheese NEEDS to be room temperature or your mix will be lumpy and not right. And you need to fluff your cream cheapest first *not* add everything all at once. Then lastly, I just couldn't go through with using the crust they suggested. Personally I like vanilla waffer crust better so this recipe was perfect but....no no no you can't leave the cookie crumbs as is, it will. Or hold it's shape as well and will taste sort of bland. I added ingredients to make it more of a crust like texture and with more taste. *This is used to make 14 crusts* first crush 20 Waffers to a very fine consistency, then add 2 and 1/4 tsp of granulated sugar, lastly combine with 2 tbs *melted* unsalted butter. Then fill each slot in the pan with some of the crust bake it on 350degrees for *5* minutes, take it out fill it with the cheese cake filling and bake it and your good to go! Hope this helps for those of you who are like me and prefer a vanilla waffer crust to a graham crust! Enjoy! (: ~Also I'm from Brooklyn NY originally so I have tasted some delicious cheese cake but trust me *if done right* these are delicious!~

These were fantastic! I used the advice of a previous review and did a graham cracker crust instead of a nilla wafer and used the bottom of a shot glass to press the crust firmly into the mini-cupcake liner. I used a baby spoon to scoop the toppings for just the right amount! Perfect! They were gobbled up!

I made these for a baby shower and they tasted pretty good.  I made half of them chocolate by melting some chocolate chips in a double boiler and adding them to the mixture.  I used chocolate graham crackers as the crust for the chocolate cheesecakes.  They were well received, but I think that the cream cheese needs to be brought to room temperature before making this recipe.  My cold cream cheese didn't fully incorporate and it ended up looking like little lumps of cottage cheese when  you bit into them.

These taste absolutely wonderful.  I used regular size muffin tins, so the recipe makes 12 small cheesecakes, and cooking them for 20 minutes is perfect.  I made 3 different kinds, and they were all excellent!  My favorite ones had oreos for the base and a few chocolate chips on top. :)  FYI, it does work best to leave the cookies whole on the bottoms.  They stay together better this way.

These caused me much stress!  I hadn't made cheesecake before, and I didn't know that you have to soften the cream cheese.  I made them for a baby shower and they turned out awful!  I had to run to the store and buy a sheet cake last minute.  I think the next time I make them, though, they will come out much better because I know what I did wrong.

I made these for the 2nd time this year.  The first recipe was for a wedding shower in July.  Today I made them for Christmas.  Mine were very small.  I ended up with 80 mini cheese cakes.  Perfect little bite size cheese cakes.  I will make these again and again.

very yummy :) made this with my sister - super easy recipe! I made sure the cream cheese and eggs were at room temp (keep it out on the counter at least 4 hours)- once it was at room temp we mixed the cream cheese til there were no lumps and added the sugar - 2 eggs (one at a time - make sure it is well incorporated before adding the second egg) then added the rest of the ingredients.. we made sure not to overmix.. for the crust I used 1.5 cups of crushed graham crackers,1/4 cup of melted butter, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a little nutmeg .. baked in a waterbath at 350 for 18 minutes..turned the oven off and let cool in the oven for 10 minutes - then cooled on the counter until fully cool and refrigerate for a few hrs or overnight!

Took these to a party yesterday and everyone loved them!  They were really easy to make and taste great.  I used the new Mini Nilla Wafers and they fit perfectly inside the mini cups!  I baked them in a water bath and used the syrup part of the cherry pie filling to put on top..not the cherry itself because I don't like them personally.  Be sure to read the Cheesecake Tips before making.  Since these are tiny you do not want to leave them in the oven to cool.  Very good recipe...thanks!

These were very good and very easy. I used boxed graham cracker crumbs for the crust instead, even easier. My boyfriend ate 15 in one sitting! I will add to my collection.

YUM! I read A LOT of the reviews and took the top tips to make mine. Made the regular cupcake size (3 bites!). I brought my cream cheese to room temp (left on countertop overnight), made graham cracker crust (2 1/2 pkgs of graham crackers to make 2 cups, melted butter, 4ish TBSP brown sugar, 3ish TBSP white sugar, mixed up in the bag I crushed the grahams in, then packed into each cup with a shot glass (great idea!))while oven preheated to 350. Blended each ingredient as I added (first blended the cream cheese til it was workable,then added sugar (little less than 1/2c), blended, added about a tsp lemon juice (in place of vanilla), mixed, then added 2 eggs, blended). It was very smooth & silky when all the ingredients were finally together. Then spooned cheesecake to almost top of each cup. (This recipe makes one cupcake pan plus probably another half). Put these pans on top of pans that have walls, added water to these once in the oven for the waterbath.Baked for about 20 mins. Then turned off the oven and let it sit for 30 more mins in the oven. Took it out (no sunken cheesecake - they were beautiful!), cooled it, added cherry topping (2-3cherries per cupcake seems just enough). I tasted one then & it was alright but the graham crust crumbled. Put it in the fridge overnight and half a day, tried another one at lunch-and OMG DELICIOUS! The flavors melded & the crust stays together! I feel like a gourmet baker now (shhh)! woohoo!

Delicious! I used 1.5 cups of the vanilla wafers crushed in my food processor with 1/3 cup melted butter and 2T sugar for the crust. Pushed 1 teaspoon of this into each mini muffin paper cup. Filled with the cheesecake filling and baked for 13 minutes until they spung back when touched. Perfect! Topped some with blueberry filling, some with cherry pie filling and some with melted semi-sweet chocolate that I swirled on top. Brought to a Super Bowl party and were well recieved. My personal favorite was the blueberry. Per other reviews make sure cream cheese is room temp, and when mixing be sure to add each ingredient one at a time whipping well in between.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I love these on so many levels! They are so easy, so quick and most importantly, SO good. If you have any experience making cheesecake, you know it takes time and attention and well worth it. However, if you're craving a nice piece of cheesecake, you can whip these up and enjoy them with your favorite topping (or plain) in the time it takes to simply chill them. I have tried them smaller as written, but we prefer cupcake size. The tin foil cupcake liners peel away nicely. Thank you to TERRIMOM for her quick and easy graham cracker crust (although I cut her quantities in half for the recipe as written: 1 cup graham cracker crumbs; 4 Tbls butter or marg.; 4 Tbls sugar, mixed and pressed into cupcake liners). Thank you for sharing, Janice!

Wow! We made this for a 4th of July BBQ, and I have never seen a dessert go so quickly! People were pulling them off the tray as my husband went outside to set them out. I used graham cracker crust instead of the Nilla Wafers, and managed to get 24 Mini Muffin size and 5 Large Muffin size out of the batch. Will probably be required to bring these to the next family get-together!

I made these as directed, and by following the cheesecake making tips on this site. . My concern was the "crust". I couldn't understand how those crumbs would stick together, but I figured they had to if people didn't complain about it in their reviews. I was pleased to find that the loose crumbs do stick together just fine, phew! I made about 100 of these (that's how many paper liners I bought anyway) for a holiday party. For 100 in mini muffin pans I used two batters, and not even a full 12 ounce box of mini nilla wafers. I had bought 2 boxes, but didn't even have to open the second. They were done in about 11 minutes and were perfect.I used cherry & blueberry pie filling to top. Two days after the party my sister came over and was asking if I had any left, she just loved them, as did everyone else.

I baked these in a water bath for 15 minutes and then turned off the oven and left them in it to cool for another 10 minutes.  Once that was done, I set the mini muffin pan on a wire rack for them to set up before transfering to the fridge for about an hour.  They turned out perfect-no cracks and no sinking tops.  I also used the 1/2 pkg graham crackers, handful of walnuts, Tsp brown sugar and 1/4 cup butter for the crust.  About 1/2 tsp in the bottom is good.  For something a little different than fruit filling, I squeezed a drop of carmel sundae topping in the center of the cheesecakes prior to baking and swirled with a toothpick.  Looks very impressive!  I gave it 4 stars due to my changes with the crust and cooking method.

What a delightful little recipe! I like to make them all different. I use slightly less sugar and the recipe turns out great. I have also used splenda, and stevia, with great results. You can substitute oreos for the wafers.  To make other flavors, add what you want! This recipe is very forgiving. For example, I made a kahlua version of this. I simply added a 1/4 c kahlua, 1/4 c cocoa to the mixture, and viola, Yummy Kahlua cheesecakes. Do the same for Baileys. Add chocolate chips to the top and press in slightly, before baking.

I made these for my class reunion and they turned out perfect. The recipe made exactly 48 mini-cakes. The vanilla wafers turned out well and tasted good, but my personal preference is a graham crust. I twisted the topping as other reviewers did. I topped half with fresh blueberries and drizzled with melted dark chocolate. The other half I used fresh rasberries and drizzled with melted white chocolate. If you try this, I suggest place the fruit on the cakes as soon as the come out of the oven to help the fruit settle and prevent it from rolling around. Also, if they are going to sit out for a while before eating, freeze them and then take out about 20 minutes before serving if you can.

These were so easy to make and SO delicious! After htey were prepared, I used a canned apple pie filling(I chopped the apples up into smaller pieces)and spooned some on top. I then melted some caramel and drizzled it on top. They were unbelievable! On the other half of the batch I put strawberry preserves. The caramel apple ones were the best by far!

Excellent. I used Reynolds' 2 1/2 inch Foil Baking Cups that you just put on a cookie sheet. Full recipe makes 16 of those. Put a whole vanilla wafer in the bottom of each. Bake at 325 for about 20 mins until the tops *just* start to crack. Serve with Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site instead of canned pie filling. Folks will be falling over each other to get at 'em.    ***Important***: Read the Cheesecake Tips before you start!

Delicious and extremely easy to make.  Save yourself some time by placing whole wafers in the bottom of each cup!  I made mine the night before, which allowed the wafers to soften a bit in the refrigerator.  An extra bonus to this time saving tip is that you get 6-8 more cheesecakes.  YUM.

Great recipe. They are creamy and they taste great, but to make sure the cheesecakes dont sink in the middle after removing from the oven, I always use a water bath. I made them a few times. Last time I made them, I decided to make them without the water bath and surely enough they sunk. I'll keep making them with the water bath.

Great! In another review I read that someone left the wafer whole, I did the that too and it worked great. Also I pureed the cherry pie filling and swirled it into the cream cheese mix one the plain batter was in the muffin tins.

I tried this with a few changes and it was really good! I'm sure it's great exactly as is too! I like pecans in my crust so I used the crust from the "Pumkpin Cheesecake II" recipe on this site by Cathy - (Combine 3/4 cup graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup ground pecans, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter or margarine and mix well).. I made a batch of filling as is in this recipe, another batch with "White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake" recipe by CindyAnn for filling (same pecan/graham cracker crust I mentioned earlier), and a third batch with filling from "Chocolate Cappuccino Cheesecake" recipe by Cigdem Buke Ugur (with an oreo crust). Everyone seemed to enjoy the "White Chocolate Raspberry" one the most!

mine were all burnt!!! I love these things.  I remember having them at different functions.  I tried to make them yesterday and failed terribly (is it because I'm a guy?).  Anyways, I used the foil muffin liners and ALL of the vanilla wafer bottoms were burnt.  Help me please.  What did I do wrong?

I made these for a party and received rave reviews. I used the graham cracker crust that another reviewer posted on here and made mini cheesecakes. They were baked for 13 minutes at 350, but found when I filled some of batter with mini chocolate chips, they needed to baked about 2 minutes more. Topped some with cherry pie filling, some with a fresh raspberry and white chocolate drizzed over, and the rest with mini chocolate chips in the batter, drizzed with caramel sauce and pecan pieces. Very good and very easy!

These were absolutely Wonderful !!!! This was my first time making cheesecake and I think the only reason they turned out so good is because I read the review from LINDSAYMILLERKS.I made regular size muffins because I could not find the mini paper liners. Thank you so much for the tips.Thank you Janice Reesman for sharing this recipe.

These were very tasty! I made them in regular muffin tins.  I left them in for 2 minutes after the tops started to split.  1/3 of the recipe I mixed in mini-choc chips, 1/3 topped with blueberries, and 1/3 topped with strawberries.  The choc. chip and strawberries went over the best.  I WILL USE THIS RECIPE AGAIN! YUMMY!

giving this a one star because of the instructions. You cannot mix all ingredient at once and get a fluffy texture. I did this and it was very liquid-y and chunky. After baking they had an omelet like texture, definitely not like that of cheesecake. Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla THEN add the eggs!!

I love the bite size cheesecake idea. They were perfect for our BBQ.  However, we didnt care for the vanilla wafer crust, it seemed to give them an odd flavor.  I would make these again but with a graham cracker crust.  Thanks for sharing!

I put an oreo cookie on the bottom and crumbled oreo cookie crumbs on top instead of the vanilla wafer and cherry pie filling. The taste was great! But seeing as I am still new to baking and it was the first time I ever made cheesecake I apparently either baked them for too long, or maybe over-mixed the ingredients because it puffed up when baking and sank in the middle after it cooled. I should have taken others suggestions and used a water bath. I also made them a little bigger than the mini cupcakes. It didn't look as nice but the taste was awesome!!!

I made these for a baby shower and they were a huge hit.  People commented on how pretty they looked as well as how delicious they were.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I did the cherry ones, also blueberry & some I topped with 1/2 tsp. of mini chocolate morsels before they were baked.  I will definitely be making these again.

My co-worker (grandma, and former school teacher) gave me a cheese cupcake recipe that uses Nilla Wafers.  I lost the recipe, so I went looking for the next best thing.  Her recipe involved putting everything in a blender, eggs, Cheese, sugar and just slowly pulsing till it creamed together.  Since I didn't have Nilla Wafers, I used ginger snap cookies that I still had in the cupboard.  I still did the blender thing, so it's a one-blender recipe. Cooked for more than 15 minutes - more like 30 mins.  The cheesecake doesn't really get brown though, so don't overcook it. Blueberry or Cherry - Yummy!

going to be honest.  i didn't have any graham crackers or vanilla wafers so i cheated because we did have a graham cracker crust.  i 1/2ed the recipe and put it in the crust and made it with strawberries on top.  turned out so yummy and fabulous.  it's really a quick way to make it without having to watch it rise and hope it doesn't fall stuff for the real cheesecake.  my husband is obsessed with cheesecake and he ate most of the pie.  very fast and very delicious.  thanks!!!

These were easy and tasty!  I used this recipe as a base for mini lemon cheesecakes.  Zested and juiced half a lemon into the cream cheese & sugar mixture in lieu of vanilla (before folding in the eggs).  Also used the basic graham cracker crumbs & melted butter crust instead of the vanilla wafers.  Delicious!  Didn't need a topping, the little flecks of lemon zest looked quite attractive.

These mini cheesecakes are absolutely fantastic! We made them using regular-sized muffin cups (foil wrappers on big cookie sheets). We used whole vanilla wafers for the crusts, and multiplied the recipe times 6, figuring one batch got us about a dozen regular-sized muffin cups. They were so delicious and disappeared so quickly! We just topped half with cherry pie filling and half with blueberry pie filling. So easy, so delicious, and so simple. Thanks so much for sharing! This one is a keeper to top the keepers!

These were a huge hit at a party I brought them to. You do not need a full 12 oz. of vanilla wafers though! I have a ton of left over crushed vanilla wafers now. These were extremely simple to make. I definitely will make them again.

this is really good and so easy, but make sure u freeze them before serving because they taste so much better completely cooled. i halved the recipe and used only 1/4 cup sugar and also usedd 1 package of  1/3 less fat cream cheese n i couldnt tell the difference at all from when i first made them with regular cream cheese

Great recipe, this is my go to dessert for family gatherings. Everyone's happy because I brought cheesecake and I'm happy because it's REAL easy! I do cinnamon graham crackers with butter for a crust (about 1 TBS butter for every two crumbled crackers). When I make regular muffin size cakes, it makes about 16.

These tasted great!  My problem was with how sticky they were out of the liner.  I used these for a dessert bar at a party my family was having.  After sitting out for a while, they were really nasty to pick up and hold.  If you make these just make sure you are abe to keep them cold and you'll do fine.

Very easy, very delicious. Use the mini cupcake patties, not the large or medium as then there will be not enough mixture.

A truly quick recipe that is sure to please everyone!  For those who want to use a regular size cupcake pan, I followed the recipe exactly and it made 18 cupcakes.  I lined the pans with foil liners and peeled them off after they had cooled a bit.  They looked great.  Also used the Famous Chocolate Wafers for the crust with 1/4 butter and 1 quart strawberries with 1/2 c. sugar, allowing them to sit at room temp. for the afternoon.  Delicous!

Excellent and easy to make. I used the regular muffin pans, not the mini muffins, and they are loved by everyone in my family. Have already made this a few times because they go so fast! If you don't care for the vanilla wafer taste or want to try something different, crushed graham crackers work great as well... or you can mix the graham crackers and vanilla wafers too, which tastes awesome!

I followed the recipe exactly, using room temp cream cheese.
My batter never really appeared "light and fluffy", even with the Kitchen Aide mixer, but there were no problems with lumps.
I baked them for about 12 minutes, then turned off the oven and let them rest for 10 minutes before removing from oven.  I did not do a water bath because of the size of my muffin tin.
Cakes were lightly browned and did not crack.
The vanilla wafer crumbs worked fine, too. The cakes came out of the wrappers
without much mess and the crust held together.  I made 48 mini muffin-sized cakes and had a very little bit of batter left over.
I topped half with cherry pie filling and half with sugared pecans (1/2 C. chopped pecans, 1/2 C. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. of butter, heated in skillet 'til sugar is dissolved) and chocolate chips.
They turned out very pretty and were popular at a party, but I just didn't care for the taste.
They reminded me of cheap, storebought cheesecake - sweet, but just not rich enough.  They also seemed a little "egg-y" for my tastes, and the crust and cherry topping seemed to overpower the tiny bite of cheesecake.
Like many sugar cookie recipes, these seem to be more for creating a pretty, decorative final product than for creating something you would really enjoy eating.
They are visually appealing and fun to make, so I would possibly suggest them for large parties, catering events, etc.  They might also be a good treat for children to help make and take to school for a party.

I made these for a potluck Thanksgiving dinner for work, and they lasted about 5 minutes.  I made different toppings for each batch.  Some turned out better than others.  Here are the best:  add melted caramel to the top of each mini vanilla wafer.  Then add the cream cheese filling.  After they are baked, add melted chocolate and crumbled Heath bar to the tops.  The next best flavor was white chocolate raspberry.  I used this idea from another reviewer and added melted white chocolate to the batter.  After baking I added raspberry jam and a white chocolate chip to the top.  They were delicious!

I love this recipe! These are incredibly easy to make compared to baking a traditional cheesecake. They're also great to take to parties. I've made these three times now and they always turn out perfect. The last time I made them I did use fat free cream cheese just to cut down on some calories and they still tasted amazing. Will make again and again...

In addition to my daughters bridal cake she wanted cheesecake.  I made a trial batch using several of the different suggestions from other reviews. Ended up using a Graham Cracker Pecan crust and they are KNOCK OUR SOCKS OFF DELICIOUS!! Found the crust to be too soggy for our liking with the vanilla wafers.

I've been making this exact recipe for years except that the version I use calls for putting a whole vanilla wafer in the bottom of a regular sized cupcake/muffin pan. I don't think I would bother with miniature muffin pans. The cupcake sized muffin pans are more of a true serving. It's an excellent recipe that I like to take for Holidays. Always asked for this recipe.

I made them sugar free and they were a big hit!  For the crust I used All Bran cereal, pureed it into crumbs with splenda, little butter to combine it.  The cheesecake mixture stayed the same (other than splenda used for sugar) and I topped them with mashed strawberries!

I use regular cupcake size.  I have made them using the vanilla wafers, but have taken to graham crackers instead...  I put halp package of graham crackers, small handfull of walnuts and about a tablespoon of brown sugar in a baggie them smash it all together.  I them melt about 1/4c. butter and mix in with cracker mix.  I scoop it in the bottom of the cups and it comes out great!

These mini cheesecakes are perfect for a party.  They are easy (especially if you know the cheesecake rules...read the "most helpful" feedback on this recipe), make a lot, and taste great.  My favorite topping has been four chocolate chips set in the center...very 'professional' but super easy.  I also made this with the graham cracker crust, not the wafer, though I will try that next time.

I made it exactly as the recipe said, and there was no where enough filling for 24 cupcakes, the amount that I adjusted it to at the bottom of the recipe. It had the consistency of an omelet-cheesecake hybrid. i even put pecans, caramel, and chocolate on top of some, and my boyfriend, who will eat anything, wouldn't eat them. 
Next time I want to make cheesecake, I won't cut corners just because the recipe is simple. I definitely will not make this again.

WONDERFUL recipe!  I made them for my family and some friends and everyone loved them!  One thing I did was to put the wafer cookies through the food processor, add 1/3 cup sugar and 1/2 cup browned butter before using for crust.  This made the crust have a wonderful buttery crunchy texture.  I also added some white chocolate chips to some of the little cakes, which the kids loved!  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be using it for "my" cheesecake recipe from now on!

I have been making this recipe since the 80's and it's so easy and yummy.  The only thing that I do differently is to use foil baking cups and to not crush the wafers, just to put them whole in the cups.

Great recipe.  I made these for work and everyone really enjoyed the vanilla wafer crust.  I tried using chocolate chips with good results.  The only suggestions I would make is to not fill the cups too full and using cherry pie filling may be too messy.  Definitely a keeper!

These were amazing!!! I added raspberries and blueberries to the cherries on top and they were a huge hit at the party I brought them to! One little issue, in my first batch I beat all of the ingredients together because that's how the recipe sounded to me and I have not made cheesecake before, and the mixture kept little clumps in it no matter how long I mixed it because I had beat the cream cheese with the eggs and vanilla at the same time. The second batch I learned my lesson and beat just the cream cheese, then added the sugar and beat some more, then added the liquid ingredients and the mixture turned out soft and smooth and very YUMMY. Loved this recipe.

I don't think I used enough crust for these.  They turned out pretty tasty but next time I will be sure to use a full 1/2 tsp of the wafers.  Next time I think I will use half oreos for the crust and mix some into half the batter too,  That way there will be 2 different cheesecakes to try.  I think the flavor alone is worthy of 3 stars  but the ease of making these gave them the 4th star.

These were just barely ok. I used graham crackers as the base because that's what I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The crust needed some butter to hold it together because the crust was still just as dry and crumbly after baking and fell out when you took the liner off to eat it. I did let my cream cheese come to room temp, but the filling didn't have the smooth texture I was looking for and it tasted a bit off. I should have followed my first mind and added some lemon juice. None of my guests really ate any of these and if I ever make them again, I'll definately make some changes. Cute idea though that's probably worth another try.

A good recipe.  I used crushed graham crackers for the crust, as that's all I had on hand.  It made the bottom very crumbly and a tad messy, so next time I think I'll try another reviewer's suggestion of using a whole Nilla wafer/cookie on the bottom.  I used the cherry pie filling for some and then for a little variety I topped some with RediWhip and then topped that with mini chocolate chips.  A huge hit with kids and adults.

LOVED these!!! They turned out PERFECTLY.  The only thing I changed was the crust...because cheesecake is nothing without a buttery, graham cracker crust! I was surprised to see vanilla wafers! But with the graham cracker crust, these turned out absolutely delicious! I used strawberry and blueberry toppings.  So easy to make! Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

Yummy little bites of goodness! I used graham cracker crumbs, sugar and melted butter in place of the vanilla wafers, personal preference. Other than that followed the recipe and got rave reviews. Very pretty when finished and such a simple recipe!

These are delicious as is, but I made three different flavors using this batter with tremendous success and professional GOURMET looking results! White Chocolate Red Raspberry: mixed 1/2 cup melted white chocolate into 1/3 of the batter, swirled 1/4 cup raspberry coulis into batter before fillig muffin cups and once baked I topped each with 1/2 teaspoon warmed seedless raspberry jam and drizzled melted white chocolate over the tops. Chocolate Chip - substituted crushed oreos for nilla wafers, added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to 1/3 of batter, once baked topped with 1/2 teaspoon chocolate ganache. Cherry Almond - substituted graham cracker crumbs for nilla wafers, added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 1/3 batter and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to cherry pie filling. Once baked, topped each with 1 teaspoon sweetened sour cream topping (1/2 cup sour cream + 2 tbsp sugar + 1/2 teas vanilla extract) 2-3 cherries and sliced almond. Feel free to email me at mpcharvat@yahoo.com for coulis, ganache or any other info. Thanks!  Bake 20mins in cupcake pan

Very good, very easy, big hit! Love the Nilla wafers as a bottom crust. Only 4 stars because it didn't feel like a "real" cheesecake to me. Still absolutely delightful!

I made these for thanksgiving, and I was worried that the nilla waffers would crumble as soon as I removed the cupcake liner. But they came out so perfect. YUMMY!

This is a simple recipe with a perfect flavor and texture.  I halved the recipe, didn't have paper liners so just greased the tins with butter, and used some crushed sugar cookies instead of vanilla wafers because it was what I had on hand and it was great! I might try a shortbread crust next time- lots of room for variations for these between crust and topping(I didn't even bother with topping this time around- they don't even really need it!). The cook time was right for me but after I turned the oven off I left them in with the door ajar for about ten minutes just in case.  I will be making these again soon- thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are good but they always sink in the middle.  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but perhaps that's why cherry filling is added to the top.  Also, I use 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.

Great! I used crushed strawberry vanilla wafer cookies for the strawberry and graham crusts for the rest. I split it into several batches and added strawberry jam, raspberry, chocolate syrup, and blueberry. I drizzled melted chocolate chips on the chocolate. My favorite was the raspberry, we didn't care for the peanut butter. Great recipe, thanks!

These were delicious. I made a few changes and liked them even better the second time around. I used 1/2 cup sugar and mini Nilla Wafers. I drained a can of cherries and added the cherries before I put the tarts in the oven. They were so much better baked in! I also creamed together the cream cheese and sugar first and whipped up real good before adding eggs.

We used this recipe for my wedding in october 2009. I made my own cheesecake cupcakes as my husband does not eat cake. We added a few things and tweaked a few others. we used canned cherries and cooked them down added a little almond extract and some vanilla for taste. its not as sweet as cherry pie filling and gave the cakes a nice contrast. we also added a little butter to the vannilla wafers otherwise the crust does not come out as a crust. i think we used one stick per 12 oz package. I am also using this recipe for a chocolate cheesecake using chocolate cookies. I LOVE this recipe its the perfect base for using in your own combination!

Easy, excellent recipe. Definitely beat cream cheese alone first to eliminate lumps, then add sugar, eggs and vanilla. I made these with graham cracker/butter crust with blueberry filling on top. Also did some with crushed oreo crust and chocolate chips on top. I cooled for 10 minutes, then freezer for 30 to chill. Refrigerated till time to eat. Turned out delicious!

These were very easy and yummy.  Instead of using vanilla wafer crumbs, I used the mini vanilla wafers.  One whole mini vanilla wafer is the perfect size for the bottom of a mini muffin tin.  Much easier and faster then messing with crumbs.

These are so cute!  I used the mini Nilla wafers and the mini baking cups (1 5/8"). The wafers fit into the bottom of these perfectly.  I made the batter per the instructions, used half to be topped with cherries.  The other half I added in the zest and juice of two limes.  I baked them for 9-10 minutes.  Then, sliced a small piece of a third lime to decorate the top of each lime cheesecake.  Both the cherry topped and lime cheesecakes looked great and very festive together. (I made these for a Christmas Eve party)  Definitely a good basic recipe.

Absolutely fantastic! Made them for a family gathering and they were gone in minutes! Only changes made were a little more vanilla and a bit of lemon zest... This is going into my permanent file.

This was my first baked cheesecakes, and while I know they aren't like doing the real thing, they turned out AMAZING!  I added white chocolate to half the batter and put raspberry jam on top after baking and cooling.  To the other half of the batter, I added semi-sweet chocolate and added finely ground coffee to the vanilla wafer crumbs.  (I ground my vanilla wafers and added butter and sugar to make the crusts)  They were delicious and simple.  They are time-consuming, for sure, but totally worth it.  Thanks for this easy recipe! UPDATE: I made this recipe last night but doubled it to use for a large cheesecake.  I added almost a whole bag of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter.  I think there is nothing this recipe can't do.  The cheesecake is wonderful.  Almost TOO good.  I made my own graham cracker crust and added coffee to it again.  Baked at 325 for 50 minutes in a water bath and then turned the oven off and left the cake alone for an hour.  Refrigerated overnight. Superb.  Now, I just have to find a place to hide it so I don't have to share!  LOL

Very easy to make..at first I used the both the vanila wafer and also made my own crust. I though the wafer crust was not good at all and ended up throwing it out. I would definitely use another reviewers suggestion and use crushed graham crackers, butter and sugar for the crust.

SO GOOD, and so easy, thanks! I used crushed graham crackers for a base (mixed with 4 T melted butter and 4 T sugar) for half the cheesecakes and then crushed oreos (with 4 T melted butter) for the other half. Melted 3 oz. chocolate chips and mixed them in 1/2 the batter. Swirled preserves with a toothpick in a handful of the plain cakes. Decorated with cherry pie filling, but left some plain. They disappeared very quickly at a picnic I took them to. Thanks!!

I've made this recipe many, many times.  The only thing I change is to use mini nillas rather than crush and measure the regular.  These are always a hit.

I needed a recipe for a graduation party.  I read this recipe plus alot of the reviews.  I decided to make 4 batches.  Cherry cheesecake with graham cracker crust then with oreo cookie crust, white chocolate/raspberry with graham cracker crust and chocolate with oreo cookie crust.  With the white chocolate and chocolate I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup melted chips.  When these were cooled and after I put seedless raspberry jam on the white chocolate.  I put a few of each chips in baggies, melted them, put a hole in the corner and drizzled a few lines with one color and with the other color I put the graduates initial over that.  I had the regular cupcake pans.  I put the batter in a gallon size zip lock bag, cut a hole in the corner and was able to get 24 cheesecakes with each recipe.  Remember to also use a toothpick to check if it is done.  Also one person said to make sure the cream cheese is room temp.  I left it out an hour and that wasn't long enough.  The next batch I waited for a total of two hours and that was perfect.  I had fun with this recipe.  Can't wait to try other suggestions that were given.

I have made these both with mini nilla wafers and a graham cracker crust. They are MUCH better with the 1/2 tsp crust because you have a lot more cheesecake filling. I add 1/2 T of lemon and an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla. These are very easy to make and well recieved. Do use crushed waffers or graham crackers it does make a difference.

these are SO good!  i made a few changes, too:  i use the graham cracker crust I recipe from this site, and i use muffin-size foil baking cups, so i can make a bunch and bake them right on a cookie sheet for 15-20 minutes.  one recipe yields about a dozen cheesecakes, perfect for one serving per person.  (or all for me!)  
i make different toppings to serve on the side instead of the cherry pie filling: chocolate sauce, fresh berries, crushed candy, etc.  they all disappear rather fast!  thanks for a GREAT idea!

I would have given this five stars except I didn't test the EXACT recipe.  I made these alterations:  I did a graham cracker crust instead of the vanilla wafers (1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1/4 c. melted butter/margarine, all mixed together) and I added 1 T. flour to the cream cheese mixture (as most cheesecake recipes have a little flour).  I would also recommend refrigerating the cheesecakes (once cooled) before adding the cherry pie filling.  This recipe made more than 48 (about 60).  Overall, very good, and I will definitely make these again!  Great for Valentine's Day too!!  :-)

These were delicious. I used regular muffin pans instead of the little ones and they were still great. They just needed to bake a little longer. Also, I refrigerated them after I baked them and they tasted even better.

Being a cheesecake lover, these were a joy to make.  I also tried blueberries as a topper and they were great.  Don't be alarmed when you see the mini's rising so high in the oven.  They do fall once cooled.  Wouldn't change a thing and will make many more times.  They were eaten up in a heartbeat.

This was by far the easiest cheesecake recipe I've ever made.  They tasted yummy too!  I did make a couple changes though - I used crushed cinnamon graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers for the regular ones that I made.  I also did a couple pans with crushed oreos as a crust with mini M&M's stirred in.  The color on the M&M's kinda bled a little, but it made for some "Easter-y" looking little cakes, and they tasted yummy that way too.  These are even great without the fruit topping. I will use this recipe again and again.  THANKS!!!

This is almost the exact recipe I have from our church's cookbook from the 1970's.  The only variation is, I put 3/4 tsp. of crumbs in the pans, and the old recipe I have also calls for 1 TBSP. of lemon juice and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  These are so easy and fast.  I whipped out 10 dozen for a wedding in no time!

Nice taste & consistancy. Quick to make in a pinch. People think you spent all day making them.
I like the vanilla wafer crust (vs. graham cracker)on the bottom.

These are fantastic.  You can make whatever flavor you want or just leave them plain.  These are a hit every time I make them.

These were a big hit at my daughter baby shower and a few other potlucks. I added a splash of lemon juice and use various topping like raspberry, strawberry, pecan caramel, peach cobbler and etc. The variation are endless and the presentation of these are always great. I like them in the mini size the best.

Okay, the good first: I have been using this recipe for mini cheesecakes for a while so I really like the taste and consistency. However, this recipe did not take me any where near 48 minis. More like 28.  Second,  1/2 cup of sugar is plenty sweet. Lastly, I won't use mini muffin pans again - Mine created a hollow area in the cheesecake where some stuck to the bottom, then there was a hollow area, then the cheesecake top. I don't know why this happened. I will stick to my way and use regular size muffin pans, lined and filled to the top. I only get 6 but they are more of a mini dessert rather than one bite.

I have a very similar recipe to this one and they are sooo good and so easy to make. My son loves them but he's kinda picky so he like them plain without the cherrie topping. To make 12 mini cheesecakes you will need 1 8oz of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 2eggs and 12 oreo cookies. You put cream cheese, sugar and vanilla and eggs in blender then spray your papercups put an oreo cookie in each one then the cheesecake mix and to the oven for 20min exact, let them cool put the cherry pie filling on top and to the fridge for a few hours. like i said very similar recipe but different cookie try them you will love them that is if you like cheesecake and oreos.

Just my humble opinion, but these were mediocre.  It was my first attempt at any cheesecake, so I will keep trying other recipes or at least use graham cracker crumbs in this one.  The vanilla wafers seemed tasteless to me.  Served them at a party with the cherry pie filling so they looked OK, but  only a few people even tried them.

Delicious and so simple.  Mine took about 25 minutes to bake, however.  Plus I left the wafer whole in the bottom.

This was my first foray into cheesecake....SUCCESS!! Thank you for this easy to make, easy to CUSTOMIZE recipe. I already have a million ideas for flavors and crusts running through my head. Thank you for the inspiration! Flavor was nice, texture was great. I did do one thing differently: I used mini Nilla wafers whole, flat side down, instead of crushed.

Awesome! Every time I bring these, people ask what bakery I bought them at. The recipe is also very versatile, and allows you to top with whatever pie filling (or fresh fruit) that you like. I've used cherry pie filling, fresh raspberries topped with a glaze made from heating up raspberry jam, blueberry filling, strawberries with strawberry glaze, etc. Perfect every time!

I'm not normally a cheesecake lover, but I made these for a party and they were a big hit.  The recipe made 16 regular muffin sized cheesecakes.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using a graham cracker crust instead of vanilla wafers, and baking for a few extra minutes to compensate for the bigger muffin size.  Great for parties as easy finger food, and nice to be able to make them ahead.

I made 3 different kind. I made white chocolate raspberry and peanut butter with an oreo crust. I also made key lime with a grahamn cracker crust. I made these in a mini muffin tin in plain white papers.  I made 25 white chocolate raspberry, 23 peanutbutter and 10 key lime. Next time I hope to get them more even or I'll just make more mix. I am taking all the key lime to and a few of the others to my small  family father's day dinner and the rest go to my hubby's large family. These took me about 2 hours and it was my first time making any type of cheesecake, I was so pleased. I did add a water bath to my oven but some still cracked. I think I overbaked them a tad. I followed another review by beating my cheesecake first and then  pouring in the egg & sugar I had previously mixed in a bowl. I had no lumps! I topped the white chocolate with fresh raspberries, the peanut butter got a chocolate & caramel drizzle with a small slice of reese's. I am adding a picture so go check it out.

I would recommend adding butter to the vanilla wafers. The bottom of each cup still had the wafer crumbs in it after baking. Very few stuck to the cheesecake.

These mini cheesecakes were absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as printed. Cooked in the oven for exactly 15 min. at 350, they came out perfect. Cooled them for 30 min. Put them in the freezer for 1 hour to chill. Topped them with fresh sliced strawberries and whipping cream. I got 26 mini tarts. Will definetly be making these again. Thank's for the great recipe, I can hardly wait to make these again. Mine did not stick to the paper liner's. I put 1 tbsp of graham wafer crumbs into the paper cups and flattened mixture with the back of a small spoon. I did fill the cups to the top with the cream cheese mixture.

Foolproof recipe! I use one Mini Nilla wafer for each crust in a tassie pan - huge time saver (make sure you put them flat side down in your muffin paper, or they will rise to the top. I need to come up with some creative & easy toppings besides cherry pie filling (which DOES look pretty on a dessert tray!). I would recommend beating the cream cheese and sugar before adding the egg, seems to help avoid lumps. Definitely refridgerate before serving.

Liked this recipe overall.  It was fairly easy.  I put the filling into a ziploc bag and snipped the corner to fill the muffin tin.  Was very quick that way.  I used the regular sized muffin tins and this recipe only made 13 cheesecakes.  The vanilla wafers just kind of disappeared into the filling and there was no defined crust.  Might try the graham cracker idea next time.  Thanks for a good recipe overall!

I made these for my sisters bridal shower instead of having a cake. I followed the advise of MPCHARVAT and made the three different flavors and they were a hit! I will be making these again, they were easy, small, and delicious!

I have been making these for many years and I have never crushed the vanilla wafer, just lay it in the cupcake holder.  Turns out wonderful and way easier

Very tasty & super easy to make!  Just a suggestion, however - an entire box of vanilla wafers is WAY more than enough, so don't crush them all if you aren't planning making more than just one batch.  I got 54 mini cheesecakes out of the recipe as is, and some were a bit bigger than others, so I could probably make about 60 next time.  They are good plain, but the cherry is just amazing.  Plan on trying some other varieties in the future. Possibly drizzling melted chocolate over the top.  Used holiday print mini paper cups to add a little more festiveness and flair!

Yummy! I made these for a small get together I catered. I also made some with oreo cookie crust and chocolate chips on top. I will definitely use this again. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

Mine sank in the middle and were a little hollow--- Im thinking they will get better with practice- however they were still a big hit and requested for the next family function.  I topped some with cherry pie filling, and some with caramel sauce with chocolate chips.  Also used a mini nilla wafer for the crust.

A great starting point for as many variations as you can think of! I don't crush the wafers; instead I place two in the bottom. It's less messy and saves time. Just remember to tap out any air bubbles. Also, ALWAYS use the foil liners! Otherwise you'll end up with more cheesecake on the liner than in your mouth :)

I made the portion for 24 servings and it fit PERFECTLY into a 12 hole regular sized muffin pan.  I used 1 Tbsp of the crushed wafers on the bottom of the muffin instead of 1/2 Tbsp, however I have seen suggestions saying to use the entire cookie flat side down!  The recipe also calls for a cooking time of 15 minutes, however it completely passed my mind that since the portions are larger, I should extend the time.  I kept mine in for 20min thinking they would look less uncooked when they settled, but I think 30 minutes would've done the job. The flavor was good overall but I will add more cheese next time, was a little too sweet for me.

I have been making these for years. They are always a big hit. If you have a Kroger near you, they carry a house brand of mini vanilla wafers that fit perfectly in the mini muffin papers.

Very good! I would also melt some choc chips & butterscotch chips in a bowl, spread that on top of the cheesecake muffins, and put the pie filling on that (I put pie filling over the choc mixture on 1/2 and left 1/2 of the muffins with just choc / butterscotch). Everyone loved them!

I made this just as the recipe states.  It turns out PERFECT every time!!!  I always make different varieties.  I put one half pecan on top and drizzle chocolate on top; I use frozen strawberries; I leave a few plain and sprinkle a little of the wafer crumbs on top.  When I'm done with these varieties, I take oreo type cookies and crush a few for the crust, and coarsely chop some more.  I use the coarsely chopped to mix into the remaining cream cheese mixture and then also use some as a topping.  These little cheesecakes are quickly becoming a specialty of mine and are being requested by friends when they are coming for dinner!  Enjoy!

These were so much fun!  I haven't made cheesecake in years, so I was a little worried when I started making these. 

But, they turned out delicious!  I replaced the vanilla wafer with regular graham cracker crust (my favorite part of cheesecake!) and I used the regular sized muffin cups instead of the mini ones (mainly my eyes just skipped over the miniature word, but they still turned out great) 
I made some plain, and some with cherry filling.  I stuck them in the fridge a couple minutes after pulling them from the oven, and most all of them set very well. (I was having problems telling when they were done no thanks to my uneven oven...)

These are a huge hit whenever I bring them to parties. You just have to be really careful about the cheesecake cracking, or even once it came out watery for me. The waterbath is too much trouble and isn't worth it.

This was my first cheesecake I ever made. I really enjoyed eating these. I used paper cupcakes liners which roughly made 17 mini cheesecakes. I took the advice of some people and just put one wafer in the cupcake (flat side down). Next time I will make the crust slightly more thicker. Needless to say, I still have (what feels like) a whole box full of the wafers. Someone did comment and wrote of an alternative gram cracker crust recipe, so I will try that sometime as well.

I cooked them for 15 minutes. When the timer is up, don't let them sit in the oven with the oven turned off because they will over bake and crack. The top center of the cheesecake did sink after cooling.

This is one of my kids favorites.  Instead of crushing the vanilla wafers I put one in each liner upside down.  I use fresh strawberries in the summer (put fresh fruit on top after baking) and have done blueberries as well.

I've made this recipe several times, and depending on the consistency and softness of the cream cheese, it turns out well. To get a creamier texture (and to avoid the clumpy cream cheese) I usually use 12 oz of whipped cream cheese and 12 oz of regular block cream cheese.

These are so cute to serve and easy to make. Plus they look labor intensive. I made half plain w/cherry pie filling on top and used a Nilla wafer (had to trim it down just a little) as the crust and to the last half of the batter I added pumpkin puree, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  On those I used a graham cracker/butter/sugar crust (was out of wafers anyway) and they turned out great, too! I garnished those with a little dollop of cool whip, so they were perfect for a fall party.

This was a very good recipe. I think it could benefit from a little lemon juice. I made these in cupcake tins using a whole vanilla wafer. I cooked for 20 mins with a pan of water on the lower oven rack. I turned the oven off and left the cheesecakes in the oven for about 30 minutes. This made 15 cupcake sized cheesecakes. This is a very good recipe. Next time I will double the recipe and make a whole cheesecake.*update - everyone loved this, they were the hit of the party. One person said this was the best cheesecake he ever had and he said he knows cheesecake.

So easy and delicious I made them for my son's birthday and then at his request made a double batch to take to his classmates at school!  I added a teaspoon of lemon juice like others suggested.  My son wanted confetti cheesecake so I added sprinkles to the batter and on top of each cheesecake cup.  I'll use this recipe over and over.

These were really easy and great!  The only thing I did different is I used chocolate chip cookie dough, (store bought) for the crust instead of vanilla waffers.  Just rolled out the cookie dough about a 4th inch thick, molded into the muffin pan, (sprayed well with Pam), cooked until lightly browned, topped with cream cheese mixture and baked as directed.

These were super!!!  I made these for a pre-Thanksgiving work luncheon, and they were gone within a matter of minutes...however, my batch only yielded 32 mini cheesecakes w/a ton of crushed vanilla wafers left over, and I followed the recipe exactly.  To save on time, I suggest using a rolling pin to crush the wafers after placing them in a ziploc bag.  Great recipe!

A good basic recipe that satisfies most cheesecake lovers. I used a larger sized cup and baked them a bit longer. I used a food processor to crumb the vanilla wafers, only half a box is really needed as I had plenty left over.

I made this for my church group and got rave reviews! Crushed up some vanilla wafers and put them in regular-sized aluminum-foil muffin cups. Followed others' advice and put the muffin trays on a jelly roll sheet filled with boiled water on the bottom so that the wafer bottoms wouldn't burn. Put it in for 20 minutes. Cheesecake was perfect - light and deeeelicious! After letting it cool, I put a dollop of Cool Whip on each mini-cheesecake, layered thinly-sliced frozen strawberries on top, and drizzled some remaining strawberry juice on each cupcake. Refrigerate before serving -- sooooo yummy! Thank you Janice!!

This simple yet delicious recipe hit the spot. Everyone at worked loved it!!! They thought I slaved over these mini cheesecake and asked for seconds. I used 21/2 inch cupcakes and baked for 22 minutes. I found that the bigger size was just right for the appetite. Thanks for sharing this woderful recipe.

These were ok. I really wanted more of a thick, rich cheesecake taste. This was more of a out of the box cheesecake recipe to me.
I took the advice of other reviews and added mini chocolate chips to part of the batter. I used oreo cookie crumbs as the crust. Instead of buying a whole package of Oreos, it was cheaper to buy one of those ready made Oreos pie crusts on the cake/cookie isle of the grocery store. Each one is about 6 ounces. 
I also decided to go with graham cracker crumbs for the plain cheesecake crust. I mixed a little melted butter with it and they turned out great. 

My only complaint is that the batter be richer. I want to feel like I eating my days worth of fat grams in one incredible bite of cheesecake!

Very yummy and addicting!  I topped mine w/ cherry pie filling, frozen sliced strawberries and mini chocolate chips.  They were a big hit at the New Year's Eve party and everyone thought I'd slaved for hours.  They were fairly quick and looked VERY pretty on a serving tray.

Thank you so much for the easiest most delicious dessert recipe EVER!  I made 1 batch with mini chocolate chips and topped them with magic shell and another batch plain and used a frozen berry mix.  I also opted for the more traditional graham cracker crust.  They were outstanding.

This recipe was soooo easy to make.  I used bite size tins (not cupcake tins) for people watching their weight and they ate more than an equivalent slice of cheese cake!

These were awesome!  Instead of using the cherry pie filling as the top, I added mini semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter.  My son LOVED them and they were gobbled up at the party I took them to.

This recipe is by far one of the best that I've ever found on this site. Not only is it tasty, but it's sooo quick and easy. This is the kind of recipe that you can make when unexpected guests come over. I've told all of my friends about these little gems, and they love them too.

Fast, easy and delicious! There are two sizes of mini pans and mine are 2" The cookies fit perfectly, flat side down without the trouble of crushing them. I may have to shave a bit off the edge with a serrated knife. With everyone becoming more health conscious, these are the perfect size to enjoy just a taste ... if that's possible! Thank you Janice!

I am HORRIBLE at cooking let alone baking so when this recipe turned out AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS  cheesecakes I couldn't believe it. Kids wolfed them down in seconds! I did modify verrry slightly. I used crushed Chessman Cookies for the crust (because I love their taste) and I used regular cupcake baking pans because I didn't have mini's. If you use a standard size cupcake pan, the serving of 48 mini's actually makes 12 regular cheesecake cupcakes. I doubled the recipe and made 24......didn't last the night!

This recipe was quick and super easy! Definitely a keeper!

Ye gods, wonderful!  I combined two recipes - Mini Cheesecakes 1 and Mini Cheesecakes III using the graham crust recipe from III and the cream cheese recipe from I.  My only change was to a) cut recipe down by 3/4th (just hubby & I) and b) to add a dollop of sour cream to mix.  Baking time was perfect and I had no problems whatsoever with sticking.  Oh - and my cream cheese was pretty sweet so I cut sugar down by about half.  Thank you so much for the recipe/s :)

Very good recipe.  I reduced the oven temp to 325 degrees F and baked for about 12 minutes.  Perfect.  Do not overbake and do not use reduced fat cream cheese if you are looking for perfection.

These are ridiculously easy to make and quick to whip up. The recipe made exactly 48 mini cakes. I did not use the vanilla wafers I used a graham cracker crust because it's what I had on hand and what I prefer. I left the cheesecakes in their paper cups for serving. Key to this recipe looking extra presentable and uniform was piping the cheesecake mixture into the cups and tapping the pan gently to help it settle before placing them in the oven. I also placed a pan of boiling water in the oven under the muffin pan. This helped to prevent the cheesecake tops from cracking. Everyone was eating these by the handfuls, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I found that I didn't need as many vanilla wafers as called for, and I used about a heaping half tablespoon of filling on each one. I then topped with melted chocolate.  Yum!!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times for parties and my catering jobs and have had compliments every time. The only thing I do differently is use mini nilla wafers. Instead of crushing up the big wafers for the crust I use my mini muffin pan and place a mini wafer flat side down on the bottom of the mini muffin cup. Bake same amount of time and cool completely. These are the perfect bite size cheese cake! I've also used a variation of toppings for fun.

It was nice to have a quick, simple recipe that didn't make cheesecake seem so time consuming.  I halved the recipe because I didn't need nearly that many, and I put them in to a regular muffin tin lined to cupcake papers.  I also used a stick of butter in the cookie crumbs. The graham cracker crust is a very important part of cheesecake to me so I wasn't going to chance that not working out. I think I cooked it for about 25 minutes and they worked out quite well and just the right size for dessert.

I was really hoping that when I made these that they would turn out delicious but they did not! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out really cute and good looking but when it comes to eating them it was bad. It didn't taste anything like cheese cake, very very disappointing.

I've made these several times and they are ways a hit. I've topped them with cherry pie filling and blueberry. I've made them mini and regular muffin size (just cook them a little longer)

Quite good! However, omitting the vanilla, and not putting in another flavoring, gives you a bland cheesecake. I made Lemon cheesecake, by adding in a few drops of lemon juice( No vanilla extract) and crushed up ginger snap cookies as crust. It was great!!!

I was very happy with how these turned out; they are easy and delicious. I followed the directions exactly. As another reviewer pointed out, the amount of crushed vanilla wafers was quite a bit more than necessary. And also next time I think I will use crushed graham crackers for the "crust." But I highly recommend this recipe!

I followed the recipe to a T and when done, the wafer bottom falls apart.  Maybe there should be butter in the crumbs?????  I will have to serve them at the in-laws with a spoon - dang.

Rave reviews!! Instead of making the minis I used regular sized muffin pans and put 1wafer in the bottom of each muffin cup and baked for 20 mins. Next time I'm going to try using Oreos.

I wouldn't make this recipe again.  The cheesecake was more like cake than cheesecake. It also stuck to the paper cups.  They do look very pretty though, but taste is lacking.  I'll try another recipe next time.

Made this twice now.  Loved it both times.  I used a graham cracker crust instead and added 1 teaspoon lemon juice!  Instant hit!

I halved the recipe, used the vanilla wafer whole, and put lemon pie filling on the top.  Very nice.  Thanks, Janice.

The recipe is good, but as other members have stated, it did leave out some key cheesecake making tips. Otherwise this recipe was simple, and yielded a flavorful mini cheese cake that is highly customizable.

I thought it was decadent.  I'd cut down the sugar by 1/4 cup maybe next time.  So simple, yet so yummy.  I opted for the graham cracker crust and did not pre-bake the crust, but per the recipe, placed some on the bottom of the paper liner.  Will definitely use a metal liner next time.

Made these two days ago and they turned out yummy.  I added a small pineapple yogurt to the batter and pineapple tidbits/blueberry pie filling to the top and .....a Winner!  Everyone loved them!  I will definitely be making these again!

This was my first attempt at cheesecake and it turned out amazing! I had oreo's on hand so I seperated them and removed the cream and on the advice of others here left the cookie half whole. I used full sized muffin liners & tin and baked for just under 20 minutes. I whipped the cream cheese before adding all of the other ingredients. Thanks for the simple and delicious recipe - I'll be using it again!

These mini cheesecakes were AMAZING! Everyone who ate them at Christmas couldn't believe they were homemade! I will make these again and again :)

Couple things--if you are using a regular cup cake pan (not mini), the recipe will NOT yield 48 cheesecakes. I had to double the recipe for the filling and even then I only got about 36 total. I also changed the crust. I used the recipe suggested by Terrimom(one of the first reviews that pops up under the recipe), since I prefer a graham cracker crust. I used butter instead of margarine and they came out perfect. 

Make these,you won't regret it!

Very good and easy.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but I didn't get even half of the amount of servings on this recipe.  But it still tasted good.

I tried this recipe twice. First time, I over baked it, saw the center was still light and not really solid, left it in oven till it was too dry.  Second time around, I removed it from the oven exactly after 15 minutes and put it in fridge after it was cooled, it turned out perfect!  Note: my batter was runny and lumpy, I used the 2" muffin pan.

I tried this from a friend and they were so good my daughter and I just had to bake them.  I am amazed how delicious and cute they are and so easy to make!  We all use maraschino cherries in the center though and they are so festive and tasty.  Even if they crack while bakiing, when you pull them out off the oven you just push a dried off cherry in the center and they surround it the cherry and look fabulous!   Thanks for this recipe it is a new favorite!

I used the base recommended by TERRIMOM, and these turned out fantastic! I made ahead for a party and froze them on a plate, then after hardened, I put them in a snap-top container. My husband and I taste-tested, and these are definite winner. Will be making these again.

Made these for a football party and they were a hit. I tried cherry and blueberry pie filling, but the blueberry was just too sweet. Next time, will try adding fresh fruit to the top and maybe some lemon zest in the cakes. I used a regular muffin tin and worked just fine. Baked 20 minutes rather than 15 as previously suggested. As suggested in other reviews, make sure your cream cheese is completely softened. If not, they will turn out lumpy. Enjoy!

These are easy and delicious!  I used graham cracker crumbs (mixed with melted butter) as the crust because that's what I had on hand.  The whole batch was eaten quickly!  Thanks Janice!

I made these today and took advice of some of the reviewers, changed the crust to graham cracker crust but am wishing I didn't.  The crust completely sticks to the paper when you pull it off, so you mostly get just the cheesecake.  I will definately try these again with the Nilla Wafers.

Amazing! It was so much fun to make.  I made it during the day (12-24-10) and it was ready to take over to my aunt and uncle's that night.  The cheesecakes were almost all gone within 30 minutes! Not too sweet, but just right.

Really the best and easiest way to impress your guests!  I did half with this combination and the other half with crushed oreos on the bottom topped with a simple chocolate ganache.  But the cherry topped desserts were by far my favorite!  Anyone can make these!

Loved the ease of this recipe and the versatility. You can do so many things with these cheesecakes.  I put white chocolate and dark chocolate drizzled on some and a rasberry sauce on others.  They look so pretty and taste great.

Such a versatile recipe! You can top with anything! I did use cherries as the recipe suggest on half, on the other half, I put a tad less cream cheese mixture in each cup and pressed a mini reeses PB cup in the middle. They were divine! these days, you can buy decorative mini cups ( I got mine at Michaels) in all sorts of patterns. These would be very easy for a party or get together, they are perfect to pop in your mouth and would be a big hit!

This is a fun dessert, but I'm actually not sure I'll make it again. I'm not a huge fan of fruit filling, and think other cheesecake recipes would be better for mini cheesecakes. Note--I assumed "mini" just meant cupcake-sized cakes (which are, in fact, smaller than a normal cheesecake), whereas it actually refers to mini cupcake fillers. Keep this in mind when deciding how much you want to make, and what type of cupcake pans you own.

Fantastic! Only need 1 cup for graham cracker crust, 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 cup of sugar. No need to pre-bake before adding cheesecake. Follow recipe as is for cheesecake. Make 48. Topped with some frozen puréed strawberries. For 24-8 graham crackers, 2 tbsp. butter and 2 tbsp sugar. follow 1/2 recipe of mini cheesecake recipe. 1 cup strawberries covers about 1/2 or so.

I love these little cheesecakes, just the right amount sweet without overdoing it on my waist.  The crust is really crumbly, I think next time I'll make the effort of mixing a graham cracker one.

These cheesecakes were fantastic!!!I haven't changed anything and they came out superb.However, I did make sure that my batter is creamy and without lumps, and that my cream cheese was at room temperature before beating ( followed the advice from the previous post ). After mixing the ingredients, I put it in the blender and blended it till smooth and creamy. Cheesecakes came out light and creamy - so good!!!I think you can experiment with almost any flavors you like!!!Fantastic recipe.

My grandmother made these every year for christmas as far back as I can remember.The trick is to keep them chilled before serving.They will taste better that way.We had an addition on the back of our house and the closest in that room got sooo cold in the winter that we kept all the extra cookies in there to keep them cool.Seeing this recipe brough back so many good memories.Thanks for posting because I haven't seen this recipe any where else.

These worked out great although I only needed about 1/2 a box of vanilla wafers.  I topped with strawberry peserves instead of cherries.

These turned out excellent. I halved the recipe to make 12 cupcake sized cheesecakes, and because the canned cherries were a little pricey and strawberries were in season, I put sugared strawberries on top. A new favorite.

I adapted this recipe since I'm on the South Beach Diet. I used ground pecans instead of crust. And Splenda instead of sugar. Came out delicious! This is a very versatile recipe. (I made 1/2 the batch normal, 1/4 low carb, and I even made a soy version for my dairy-allergic daughter)!

Not only did I make these in different flavors, I also used crushed walnuts, pecans and hazel nuts for my crusts.  I also added a tad of melted butter to each crust.  It helpts to keep the crust from flaking off.  My favorite flavor was peanut butter/chocolate.  This is a great recipe--and easy too!

They turned out pretty well. I used a ghram cracker crust instead. One cherry on top was too powerful. Perhaps next time I'll cut one cherry in half, or just make a them in a regular sized muffin pan.

Excellent.  Even took others suggestion and made a batch with mini chocolate chips and oreo cookie base.  Both were excellent.  I think next time, I'll add a bit of lemon zest for a little more zing to the cheesecake.

Very nice little recipe.  I prefer the lemon juice version, but didn't have any, so I added a teaspon of lemon extract to this along with the vanilla just for kix and was pleasantly surprized.  I also used a cookie scoop to fill them and loved how it made them all uniform sized without the eyeballing, lol.

Read reviews for many necessary tips and great variations. I have one Daughter who doesn't like the cherries from the pie filling on top, so to her's I'll sprinkle with candy decor balls. or red and green candy sugar bdefore baking, For others, who like maraschino cherries, but not the pie filling cherries once put one on however many needed after baked I'll add a drained Marachino to the top before baking. Enjoy and let you imagination go mad! Happy Holidays to All and to All Happy Holiday Baking!

These are great.  I have made them with Oreo cookies on the bottom and crushed oreos or mini chocolate chips in the batter.  I have used a whole Oreo or one split in half with the frosting side up.  The key is not too bake too long or they will not be as moist.  I am going to try making mini pumpkin cheese cakes for Thanksgiving.  The size is great, just big enough and portable for guests at parties.

These were super easy to make and everyone loved them! The only change I made was to substitute the vanilla wafers for a graham cracker crust (I just followed the crust recipe on the box) I 1 1/2 the recipe and it made about 2 dozen full sized cupcakes

I used a homemade graham cracker crust, but left the filling ingredients the same.  I made several variations (cookies & cream, turtle, cherry) and all turned out yummy!  Thanks for a very customizable, basic recipe!

these cheesecakes were really creamy! i was looking for something a little heavier for a cheesecake though. i also used a normal sized muffin tin so i had to search for reviews on how to know when they were ready; around 15 minutes worked for me. these are a definite crowd pleaser. i used oreo cookies instead of the wafers. delicious!

These were so good! Do not overcook them however... I made this recipe exactly as state except for doubling the recipe and topping them with the blueberry mixture from Blueberry Cheesecake Icecream (also from the site and YUM, these were fabulous! Thanks so much for sharing!

Split the recipe in half and it made one mini-muffin pan of mini-cheesecakes (24). I had to skip the vanilla wafers - I love having a graham cracker crust.

Great recipe!  The only adjustment I would suggest is to add more than 1/2 teaspoon to each cake.  It is so little that once it is cooked you don't even notice it.

I followed this recipe for the filling and used a grahm cracker crust. It was excellent just in between the fluffy and cake like! I perfect fix for my prego craving. I halfed the recipe and it made 8 scrumptious regular muffin sized portions! Will be using again and again!

I've made these several times and always get rave reviews! My brothers friends even arm wrestle for who gets the last one... boys. I followed another reviewers suggestion and now make 3 different flavors: Cherry Almond, Raspberry with White Chocolate and Oreo. All are delicious! P.S. Don't forget to make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature.

I made these for Thanksgiving, only I used regular 2" cupcakes pans, I made half the recipe, with the  cherry, and the other half I placed a Reese's Peanut butter cup on top of the wafer, then covered with cheesecake and baked. They were the talk of the day.

I made these for last year's Thanksgiving dinner and they did not last long at all. Everyone LOVED. They were easy to make and DELICIOUS.   I made them exactly as the recipe indicated. No need to change a thing.   They were creamy and sweet. Did not stick to the paper liners. Plus, the bite size treats made sure everyone received a share, which is not always the case with a traditional cheesecake. I'm thinking about using this approch with pumpkin pie, as well.   As the family "chef", I'm always expected to being something a little different and delicious. These little treats did not let me down.

these little cheesecakes came out perfectly, and were all gone! Instead of the vanilla wafers I did make graham cracker crust, baked them in the muffin liners first then filled them and baked the filling, great!

Great little recipe and VERY easy due to the simple list of ingredients.  I'd put them in the fridge to cool.  They seemed to set better that way.  My boyfriend said he wished they were more cheesy, but I got lots of wonderful compliments!  Plus, easy cleanup is always a plus!

Wonderful!  I followed the advice of another reviewer, and used 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1 stick butter, and 8 Tbsp. sugar for the crust, and it tasted great, but I had WAY too much.  Next time I'll use half that...otherwise these were fantastic!!! Topped with cherry pie filling & blueberry pie filling and served at a bridal shower - they were gobbled up!

These were terrific and EASY!  I made in an afternoon for dinner that night and I have 3 kids running around.  Leaving out the cream cheese overnight or all day helps in a major way to soften it.  I use a food processor to grind up the whole box of vanilla wafers and didn't use all of them, so I have that for the next time! I added mini chocolate chips to 1/2 the batter for chocolate chip cheesecakes.  I had fresh fruit and canned fruit as toppings and shaved a dark chocolate bar on top of all that and it looks so fancy!  Made about 18 regular "muffin" sized cakes.

Wonderful! I used a regular muffin sized tin.  I followed the advice of another cook and made a graham cracker crust. I topped each with a teaspoon of raspberry preserves and used a toothpick to swirl the preserves.  Will definitely add to my recipe box.

This was fantastic.  I made it for a work party and everyone complimented me on it. Only change was I used butter and graham cracker crumbs for the crust. Used low-fat cream cheese and sugar-free charry pie filling.

I have made this recipe about 10 times since I found it. My daughter and I love it. We use the honey grahmn crackers instead of the vanilla wafers. The recipe makes just enough for 12 regular sized cupcakes if you don't have any of the tiny cups. This is SO easy and tastes awesome!!!!

So Good!!  So Easy!!  just make sure the cream cheese is room temp ( soft ) so it will whip up nice and creamy.  Like others I made an assortment, some cherry, some with choc chips...can't wait to make again with a lemon version...yum!!

Followed directions precisely. Only so-so. In my husband's words: "Not 'cheesecake-y' enough." The filling just didn't really have a full cheesecake flavor. Plus, the bottoms fell off...that was not fun.

I made these lovely treats for the Super Bowl gathering. Even though I was a first time cheesecake baker, the minis turned out perfect. 

Here are a few tips I collected from other reviewers and some of my own. Soften the cream cheese before mixing. Use blender to get rid off the smallest crumbs. Add cocoa and sugar to make chocolate minis or other different extracts for more flavors. Substitute for the graham cracker crust: 2.5 cups of crushed grahams + 8 tablespoons of melted butter + 8 spoons of white sugar (will try honey in limited quantities next time). I found 2 cups of graham crackers and 8 tablespoons of butter to be too buttery when cooked. Load each mini with about ¾ tablespoon of the crust and press it down with fingers or find a utensil to fit the mini. I used the end of the ice cream scoop. Its end is flat and sized just a little smaller then the bottom of the cupcake liners. Use water bath and baked for about 12-13 min. No cracks, no sinking middle, no sticking to the paper liners, no broken crust! :)

These cheesescakes turned out pretty dang good. My only problem though was that I used a grahm cracker crust like other reviews talked about and most of the crust peeled off with the liner. What could I do to help this? Use some pam or use less sugar in the crust? Any help would be much appreciated. Overall taste was excellent!

I have had this recipe sitting in my recipe box for many years.  I made these years ago for a baby shower.  I just made them for a dessert for Christmas, and instead of using just the different pie filling, I drizzled different chocolates,raspberry sause with white chocolate, the different types are endless!  The recipe is super easy..

Fabulous.  I used whole Trader Joes Triple Ginger Snap cookies as the crust, which fit perfectly in my mini muffin pan.  Added about 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice and some fresh lemon zest.  Topped with a fresh blackberry.  I did make a bit of a mess in getting the raw batter into the muffin pan.  I may try squeezing it in using a pastry bag next time.  Great recipe.

I used the graham crumb crust suggested by Terrimom, but followed the rest of this recipe.  OMG, yum!  I love that this is quick and easy, which means I can make them often.  We did also try a little variation, by setting aside 3/4 cup filling and mixing in 1/4 cup strawberry jam (no lumps).  Then swirled that in with the regular filling for a nice change of pace.  This one is a keeper!

I made these for the first time to take to a potluck at work and they were a hit.  I used graham cracker and oreo crust.  I also put 1/8 teaspoon flavoring in some of them.  Swirled in some melted chocolate.  They were great!!!!

My family loves these! I can make 48 of them and they are gone at our family dinners within minutes of desert time. I drizzle chocolate and caramel on mine instead of using cherries and make them in regular size cupcake holders, therefore doubling the recipe. It is also easier to make the crust by putting the crackers into two ziploc bags and then pounding it with the flat side of a meat mallot.

Excellent, but be sure to follow the cheesecake tips on this website if you aren't a cheesecake expert.  Otherwise, your cheesecakes may crack or sink in the middle.  This is a great recipe to add whatever toppings are your favorite!

absolutely outstanding.  followed the recipe as-is, topped 4 with canned raspberries, 4 with a mixture of raspberries and chocolate chips, and made the last 4 with chocolate chips, caramel and pecans.  

ps: for those who would like to make these smaller - this was a trial run for a housewarming party - they actually make mini Nilla wafers!

Excellent. I used gluten free cookie crumbs for the bottom. This made a great gluten free dessert. I brought it to our potluck twice and it disappeared immediately!

I have made this recipe many times in the past. I try to watch my sugar/fat intake, so I use the lowfat (not fat free) cream cheese and use Splenda in lieu of sugar. I crush up chocolate graham crackers and put about 1/2 Tablespoon in the bottom of a ramekin. I spoon in the filling. For a little added sweetness I take 1-2 Tablespoons of Polaner sugar free raspberry preservers, add just a little warm water, and stir it up with a spoon until I have a thick syrupy mixture. I spoon just a little on top of each cheesecake and swirl it around with the sharp end of a knife. I cook mine in a water bath in a 325 degree oven for 18-20 minutes. It makes a great dessert or anytime snack.

I made these for a friend's birthday and they were easy and great. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture and blended it well. I also found by the fruit section, a cream cheese fruit dip, which I used as a topping to the mini cheesecake. I then placed either one raspberry or one blackberry on top. It was a nice, fresh, and yummy treat - it also displayed very well. 

If you're travelling, then you'll want to put the fruit dip and berries on when you arrive to your destination.  

I had problems with the mini-muffin liners being too big, so I just sprayed extra baking spray and used toothpicks to free the cupcakes from the edges and then placed them in the mini-muffin liners.

I made these mini cheesecakes for my husband's birthday party and they were a huge hit. They were all gone in 10 minutes. The only thing I changed was I only cooked them for 12-13 minutes because otherwise my cheesecakes cracked. Next time I am going to attempt the chocolate ones.

I make these occasionally for parties, and they're always a big hit! I make my own strawberry sauce to put on top for some of them, and for others I mix semi-sweet chocolate chips into the batter for mini chocolate cheesecakes, which taste amazing!! This is definitely a favorite recipe of mine!

Easy and delicious.  I altered the crust--used a graham cracker crust with loads of pecans in it--yum!! I think I will keep the ingredients on hand for when I have to make something easy for guests or potlucks!  Thanks for this recipe.

These were super quick, easy, and yummy.  Great for when you need a cheesecake fix.  I didn't use nearly the whole box of vanilla wafers, though...not even half, so there are some leftover for snacking.

Super easy to make and got good reviews from my family.  I did use a graham cracker/butter crust (mixed the two together) to make it more like a regular cheesecake.  I topped some with cherry pie filling, blueberry pie filling, and some with fresh fruit (kiwi, strawberries and blackberries.)  Mine baked for a few more minutes than was called for, but I did fill the cupcakes (regular size, not mini) almost the whole way to the top.  I took them out of the oven when they just began to crack slightly.

So easy and tasty!  I swirled seedless raspberry jam into 1/2 and topped the remaining plain cheesecakes with drizzled chocolate, caramel and chopped pecans after baking.  They do sink in the center a bit when they cool (especially the jam ones) so make sure you have something to top them with.
I followed another reviewer's advice and made the graham cracker/butter/sugar crust, however I found that 2 cups of crumbs was far too much, the crust recipe given could probably be halved.

like the others, I too think there's too much vanilla wafers stated in this recipe. Half or lesser the amount should be alright.
I don't really like the base, find the vanilla taste a bit strong to match the cheese. (or maybe this is due to we're using different brands of wafers)

I like the cheesecake part. Next time round I'll try to use a biscuit base.

I feel bad to say that I am not a big fan of this recipe.  It had to be cooked way longer (5 plus extra minutes) for the cheesecake to not be soupy, which made the bottom too done. Worst of all, these did not taste cheesecakey enough! if you do decide to make this recipe, you definately need to bring the cream cheese to room temperature.   Maybe mini cheesecakes are supposed to take on a different taste compared to a yummy new york cheesecake, which is what i was hoping for. sorry!

I've made this recipe twice, using crushed oreos instead of vanilla wafers. Both times they tasted wonderful. My only complaint is that they sink in the middle. I like to leave some without fruit topping for people who prefer them plain, but they really don't look very nice with the large dip in the center.

These were great! I crushed less than half the amount of Nilla wafers called for, and still had some crumbs left. My husband said that was okay; they'll make a good topping for ice cream. I topped the cheesecakes with a small amount of lemon curd and placed a large fresh raspberry or blueberry on each one. They were lovely.

Yum!! This was an absolute hit with my friends and family! I couldn't find the mini cupcake liners, so I made about 14 cheesecake-cupcakes. The only thing I did differently was adding a teaspoon of lemon juice. Like the others have mentioned, the KEY is to have cream cheese at room temperature and to have a SMOOTH batter. I baked these at about 20-21 minutes and they came out perfectly! THANK YOU! I will be making these again.

Very easy! It's true that they don't taste like the real stuff but with so few ingredients I was amazed at the result! The only comment is that the crust needs some butter in it for better textute/taste.

Wow!!  I made these as a trial for a wedding that wants cheesecake cupcakes.  i didn't think the bride would be happy with my first attempt at the light cheesecake.  I literally dumped all the ingredients in a bowl and whipped for 2 minutes.  I then put the batter in Texas muffin sized tins on top of graham crusts.  I had to cook for about 25 - 30 minutes (larger size).  I topped some with whipped cream and choc. shavings, blueberry topping and even 2 tsp right out of the can of cherry pie filling.  Everyone gushed.  I had to try them - not heavy (big plus)  light and creamy.  The bride even asked if I could whip up another dozen to send to work with her hubby to get his and his co-workers reaction to them.  These are so easy I had the ready in 35 minutes - she took them home warm.  Bottom Line: Super easy, amazing taste, and it doesn't leave you feeling like you just ate the whole cheesecake rather than just one piece.

I've never made cheesecake and always wanted to.  I decided to make the mini ones before I tackle the full size cake.  These were so easy.  They are best after at least an hour in the refrigerator.  They make a great complement to your dessert offerings with different toppings like cherries, blueberrys, or whatever you like.

Fool proof! These are wonderful to take to a party, guaranteed no leftovers! The fruit filling is still great even added on hours before and kept in the refrigerator until serving time.

This was really easy to make and really tasty!  I even messed it up a little by not letting the cheese fully get to room temp.  The batter was kinda chunky and i over beat it a bit but it still turned out great!  Their nice and fluffy and sweet.  Mmmm!  A++!!!

THIS WAS THE BEST OF ALL... I CHANGED A BIT ON THE CRUST I ADDED TABLESPOON OF MELTED BUTTER TO THE CRUSHED COOKIES.  THEN I TOOK A CUP OF SOUR CREAM ADDED TWO TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR (ACTUALLY SPLENDA) AND SPOONED ON TOP OF THE CREAMCHEESE MIXTURE PRIOR TO COOKING.  TASTED LIKE A SECRET HOME RECIEPE I HAVE.....

I couldn't believe something this easy would turn out so delicious!  I usually go all out to make entire cheesecakes with so much more trouble (cracking, over baking, etc.)  Making mini cheesecakes allows me to easily make an assortment with the different preferred toppings.  I chopped up chocolate truffles and mixed into the batter before baking for some really creamy chocolate chip cheesecakes.  And easily halfed the recipe for 12 servings.  My boyfriend and I shamelessly polished off all 12 in one evening! Thanks!

So easy to make I couldnt belive it.  I used raspberry and strawberry pie filling to top them off.  Next time I would use graham crumbs instead of vanilla wafers tho.

Such an easy and delicious recipe. The kids had a great time helping. The recipe called for 12 oz. of vanilla wafers which was way too much, but that's okay since the leftover crumbs will be used up very quickly to make more of these!

These were great, the only problem I had was everyone wanted more!  I served them at a Christmas Party, everyone thought they were so cute, they were very easy too, next time I will make double or maybe make them in cupcake size so we can have more.  Thanks

Made no changes,  found it to taste a little off. I can't figure out what it is though. They didn't taste bad, just off. I make normal cheesecakes weekly for a restaurant so I'm no novice to cheesecake techniques. My husband said they weren't as rich as a normal one, but I'm going to make again with a bit more finesse! They are very easy to make and definitely worth a chance. If nothing else, its a great, easy base to start with.

I made these this past weekend. I used some of the suggestions from other reviews. 1st, I made a batch and I used the vanilla wafers. I just put the cookie in the cupcake paper, flat side down. I was a little worried about how that would go over but let me tell you, I will never make the crust again! I made the full size not the mini. They baked for 20 minutes. One thing that was great about using the cookie is, when you peel the cupcake wrapper off, it doesn't crumb all over! I also threw in a few handfuls of mini chocolate chips. Oh so good! Then I made another batch, using splenda instead of sugar. My husband has diabetes, so I needed to cut the sugar. Using the splenda, they tasted just as good. Next time I decide to make the sugar free batch, I think I will use a sugar free cookie. These will be very diabetic friendly!

That is the first cheesecake recipe that actually works for minis without getting either too moist or too greasy. It's too easy to be true! I made a fresh strawberry topping for it and it turned out perfect! Thanks for that!

My kids love these mini cheesecakes. I don't bother crushing the vanilla wafers. I drop them whole in regular cupcake liners and keep an eye on them as they bake (approx 17 minutes). I can make approx 21 to 22 cheesecakes. I add lemon juice from half of a lemon to the cream cheese mixture as if I was making a regular cheesecake. This has been a repeat recipe for my family.

Very good recipe. I'm a beginner so I would have liked to have seen some pointers in the recipe.  Luckily,  I read the reviews before baking,  so I was okay!  *make sure mixture had no lumps *room temp cream cheese 

I added some cinnamon sugar to some.  They were great.  Also had some chocolate chip ones!

I used a graham crust and topped with fresh blueberries and fresh sliced strawberries.  Aside from those changes, I made exactly as recipe described. Everyone raved about them.

I made these for a women's bible study christmas gift exchange party. They were all gone by the time it was time to leave :) These get a 5 star for taste but a 4 star for how many this recipe actually makes. Luckily i bought an extra bar of cream cheese or i wouldn't have had enough ( i still didn't have a lot but enough to do the job). I used 3 (8oz) bars of cream cheese, 3 eggs, and a little bit more sugar ( because of the extra cream cheese). I also used two cups of graham cinnamon and sugar cracker crumbs, 1stick of melted butter, and 1/4 cup of sugar for the crust.  With all that said i ended up with 20 1/2 mini cheese cakes so not even 2 dozen. I filled each cupcake liner with 1 tbs of the crust batter and pressed it down then i used 1/4 cup full of the cheese cake batter for each one so they turned out even. They were really good I just need to remember to double up the recipe if i want to make more than 12...

I have made this recipe for several years.  When I take them to a party they are gone in no time flat. The only difference is that I use crushed Graham's mixed with sugar and butter for the bottom crust.  Vanilla wafers are too bland.

Really easy and delicious. I mixed a little bit of butter with the crumbs because I was worried the crumbs were too dry but they stuck together just fine without the butter. Next time I'll get the real vanilla wafers that I think would be the right size to put in the muffin pan without crushing. Maybe also try some of the other varieties and flavors recommended by other reviewers.

I made a NUTELLA version of these treats.  I used chocolate wafer cookies, mixed with a little melted butter for the crust.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and added a heaping 1/4 cup Nutella.  By the way, 12 oz cookies will make WAY more than needed.  I'd say about 5 oz is fine.

These were pretty tasty and quick to make. I had to add more sugar because there was not a whole lot of flavor, but with a little more sugar, it became very sweet and tasty! However, clearly you were supposed to use the mini tins because when I changed the serving to 24 cakes, I thought it would make 12 regular sized cakes but it instead only made 8! I had to use a whole other brick on cream cheese to make a second batch. It was very disappointing. Also, you can not cream the sugar, cream cheese, eggs, and vanilla until fluffy all at once. You should most definitely cream the sugar and cream cheese first, then add the eggs and vanilla. The crust definitely needs butter as well! It is way too crumbly without any. However, despite the recipe's shortcomings, it was very delicious and every loved them, so I would make them again if given the chance.

They should have told you to whip your cream cheese until fluffy. Then add your sugar and beat well. Then add your eggs in one at a time. If not, your batter is going to be lumpy.

These are absolutely scrumptious & extremely easy to make! My family frequently requests these delightful little desserts to be made. Over time I've made cherry, blueberry, and strawberry toppings, tonight I'm making a pecan rum sauce so that should be delicious as well. I will continue making these and I look forward to making varying toppings too! ??

I made these for our Easter meal.  I used whole ginger cookies as the base,in (paper lined) medium-size cupcake tins, made 22. For the kids I put tiny coloured (chocolate) Easter eggs in the concave top surface,  so it looked like a basket: the adults had homemade blueberry pie filling on top. No complaints here.

Great recipe!  I made this for a Christmas party and was asked for the recipe by multiple people.  One change for next time; use less vanilla wafers.  I had tons of crushed wafers left over and saved them in a zip lock baggie for the next time I make these, which will be very soon  :  )

These are great! I added some chocolate chips to half the batter for variety. I also did full size cupcake pans and put a whole nilla wafer in flat side down. They turned out great and I left them in for 18 - 20 minutes.

This is really easy if you are looking for a dessert to feed a crowd. This recipe would be even better if baked in a water bath. It would improve the texture of the cake and give a more creamy mouth feel. I used this recipe and poured the batter into regular size muffin cups while placing a whole wafer in the bottom.

I halved this recipe and used honey nut cream cheese, and it turned out really well! I made a berry topping instead of using the cherries (simmer blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, a little bit of water, and sugar over the stove) and it tasted perfect on top. It was fast and easy...definitely something I'll make again.

Wow! This is a super easy recipe and a very festive. I made these in green and red foil baking cups. I put them on a beautiful rectangle plastic crystal looking platter (Pier 1- $10). It was a great hostess gift and quite the conversation starter. I did put the entire cookie at the bottom & didn't crush it up.

I followed other suggestions of bringing cream cheese to room temperature, then beating to silky smooth and then gradually adding the eggs, sugar, and vanilla. For my first time making any type of cheesecake, I give 5 stars for ease.  However, I felt the taste was a little bland. The Nilla wafer crust was missing something?? I love cheesecake and the flavor of this was just ok.. Maybe it was the brand of cream cheese I used (Lucerne)??  I think next time I will add the lemon juice as suggested by others and probably do a grahm cracker or chocolate crust.  Most of the tops cracked but was hidden by the cherry topping.  And an entire box of Nilla wafers was WAY to much.. Maybe 1/3 of the box if you decide to go that route.

You can't go wrong with this recipe. These are perfect bite size cheesecakes if you use the tassie pans, but you can also use regular cupcake pans with mini liners (they just come out a little thinner). Personally I prefer the smaller pans. 
I've made this recipe over 5 times and it never goes wrong, everyone who's tried it keeps telling me to make more. I top it with raspberry pie filling instead, and use graham cracker crumbs for the crust or oreo crumbs =) Delicious.

These were great, but I think I overbaked them and they cracked.  I substituted splenda instead of sugar in both the crust and cheesecake.  My family loved them.

I was looking for a cheesecake recipe to use in a 12 cup muffin pan. This cheesecake tasted very good however I was short on the cake batter (assuming 48 mini cakes should be equivalent to 12 cupcakes). Next time I will remember to use double the ingredients. I used a graham cracker crust for this from the variation from another reviewer. Overall the cheesecake part was delicious, but I found the crust too sweet and I will also recommend adding some lemon juice to the batter.

So good! Instead of wafers I used cookie dough for the crust. I used a regular cupcake pan and baked for 20 minutes. They came out perfect and so delicious!

Good cheesecake, I made a few changes. I used 1 and 1/4c of sugar and added 1/2c of greek yogurt for texture. Also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Substituted 1 of the eggs for 1/4c egg beaters. We have been dieting and wanted something sweet that doesn't ruin all our hard work. All in all very good. I suggest making sure the cream cheese is room temp and to beat it by itself first to remove any lumps.I added the yougurt then blended well. I added sugar by 1/2c measurements and tasted to see if it was sweet enough. Baked it for 20 mins in my oven. Good by itself doesnt even have to have a topping. We used a cinnamon snickerdoodle type of cookie insead of vanilla wafers.

Great mini cheesecake recipe! However, the measurements are a bit off. We made 48 mini cupcake size and we had WAY too much crust with the whole package of vanilla wafers that this recipe calls for. We would have been fine with less than half of the box. Also, since we filled them almost all the way to the top, there was not quite enough filling. We ended up making 42 instead of 48.

Great recipe and very easy...Definitely use the Nilla wafer minis if you can find them.  Also read the other reviews, a lot of great tips.  Made them for a girls get together and will also make them for a graduation today.

Thought these were really good, First time i had made anything like cheesecake before and had a difficult time telling when they were done.  I also crushed all the wafers in the bottom.

I had left over chocolate wafers so I used them in half of the crusts.But there is no way you get 48, I barely got 36.I don`t put anything on top, I love the cheesecake just the way it is.I don`t know why somebody had said to put the wafers in flat top up,I didn`t crush mine, but that makes the bottom rounded.All in all nice little single serving of a dessert.

I've made these before and added a table spoon of lemon juice.  You can also top it with cool whip and fresh berries (chopped strawberries, blue berries, black berries, and raspberries). Looks very festive and my family loves it.

this is super easy and really good.  not quite as firm as traditional New York cheesecake but far from the instant pudding stuff.  Substituted gluten-free graham crackers for the vanilla wafers due to who I was serving (no added sugar or butter) and they worked swimmingly - even got rid of the icky texture of the graham crackers!  
Thanks for making my hunny's birthday treats so easy and quick  and good

First time making cheesecake so mine came out sunken, but if they had not sunk, they would have tasted great! The three is because I had to add an extra tablespoon of sugar for mine to taste less like cream cheese and more sweet.

Wonderful and simple recipe!  I whipped the mixture until very smooth and creamy.  I used regular muffin tins and baked about 20min, they turned out perfect.  Very delicious topped with raspberry or apricot preserves.

I grew up with these, and since I'm away from family for the holidays I wanted to make some dishes from my childhood. I made these tonight for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. Both my fiance and his sister said I should start making them regularly. I used graham crackers, mixed with melted butter and sugar, in place of the vanilla wafers and I made them regular cupcake sized instead of mini. Used the food processor to mix the batter and grind up the graham crackers. Easy. Thanks!

These were good but I would definitely cut the sugar to 1/2 c. I crushed up some oreos and used those for the bottom and they turned out very good, not very firm though so they were a little hard to handle.

These little cheesecakes were perfect as is! They were a huge hit with everyone at a birthday party. Crushed graham crackers could be subsititued for the vanilla cookies, like the traditional crust of a cheesecake, but the cookies were just as wonderful.

I made these years ago and I guess I forgot to review them but I still remember the taste! These were dense with a real cream cheese taste. I tried a recipe used condensed milk; it gave it a gelatinous texture that just masked the cream cheese taste. This is better. Forgo condensed milk, etc.

YUM!!! This is my first time making cheesecake and it came out perfect! Totally delicious just like the ones they sell in stores~  The recipe says it makes 48 but I only got 12 muffin size cupcake with the quantity used.   I added passionfruit to the cheesecake instead of cherry and it was goooood!

While the mixture tasted wonderful before I cooked it (yes, I licked the spoon when cleanig up :)), it turned out rubbery.  :*(  I don't know why.  I kept checking it and it wasn't cracked or brown on top..no idea.

i used a graham cracker base and while this was good it was very sweet. I think next time i'll use less sugar and a different topping, but i've never made cheesecake before so thanks for the recipe. I definitely will be making it again.

These were great.  I used gluten free arrowroot crackers for the crust and canned tart cherries (found with the rest of the canned fruits at your grocery) rather than your typical cherry pie filling in gel.  Yum!  My family devoured them in no time.

I made these for Mother's Day yesterday and they were pretty good.  I've never made cheesecake before and never got my batter to be "light and fluffy", it was very runny, no lumps though.  I used regular muffin tins and put 1 wafer in each as recommended, should've crushed it instead because we just ended up with one cookie at the bottom of the cheesecakes.  Baked them for 30 minutes and it made a total of 10 regular size muffins.  I think I'll try it with graham crackers next time... crushed.

I thought these were a little eggy and the crust completely fell apart on me, but everyone else seemed to like them.  FYI- a whole box of vanilla wafers was a huge waste, a half a box would probably still had some left over

So it was kinda hilarious making this b/c I am trying to teach a friend how to cook and she forgot the nilla wafers so we ended up using keebler butter crackers, which actually worked out really well. Also we ended up using a full dish instead of the individual cups cus she forgot the cup holders! haha So with the slight improvising this still came out very delicious!

KarenKWP I would love the recipe for peanut butter but I dont know how to converse with others on this site. This was great and quick.  My husband and I are on diets so I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and low fat grahm crackers crushed in the bottom.

I made these for a school potluck and they were the first dessert to be gone.   They're so simple and perfect for that cheesecake craving.  That being said, I recommend using a graham cracker base.  Turned out MUCH better.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made a white chocolate version of this recipe. I melted 3/4 cup of white chocolate chips with a splash of milk over a double boiler and then added them to the cream cheese mixture and they were so yummy! oh ya and i also halved the recipe... i don't have enough people to eat 48 of these guys!

These mini cheesecakes are soooo good and soooo simple to make. I made them for a bakesale and they looked better than anything else on the table. This is a 5 star recipe. I followed it exactly and they came out perfect. Nothing needs to be changed! I will be be making these again anytime I need to bring a desert! And now I'm craving them after writing this review :)

Instead of crumbling wafers, I spooned boxed graham cracker crumbs onto the bottom of each muffin liner and was surprised to find that they baked pretty well. These sunk down in the middle after removing from the oven (see cheesecake baking tips) the first few times I made this recipe, but I've gotten a little better and the dips aren't as severe anymore. Anyhow, the cherries fill up the holes pretty well. =)

These were simple yet good. I halved the recipe expecting a dozen regular muffin size cheesecakes, but only got 9. Just wanted to let everyone know so you know how many to expect.

These were great.  I used 8 oz. fat-free cream cheese, 1/4 cup egg beaters, 1 t. vanilla, and 3 T. sugar.  Beat until light and then placed into 6 regular muffin tins.  I should have baked longer but they still had fantastic taste.  I will make again!!

One of my favorite recipes. Thank you for posting. :D  The only issue I had (and I think it might be related to my oven) was the bake time was considerably longer. I just waited until the tops started to get a little golden around the edges and then took them out to cool.

Very Tasty!  This was my first time making any type of cheesecake and they turned out great. I did use the graham cracker/butter/sugar mix for the crust.  I added Heath Bar bits to half of the batch and they were absolutely wonderful. Can't wait for more experimenting!  Thanks for a great recipe.

These came  out beautifully. I substituted oreo rings for the crust and I added 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to the cheese mixture for my chocolate loving family. They turned out beautifully! Thanks for the awesome recipe 8)

Very yummy !! I baked them for my English class and everybody was crazy about! However it was kind of hard to spread the cheese cream mixture on the top of the Nella crumbs.. It wasn't  liquid enough!

The taste of the cheesecake was great and I love the concepte of mini cups.  I did make a couple of changes. I took the advise of two cups of cookie crumbs 8 Tbs of melted butter and 8 Tbs of sugar pressed into the bottom of the cups. I used girl scout cookies the short bread ones. I like a dense crust. Cook time for me only took 9 minutes. I have a convection oven and they were done quick. I refrigerated them over night and toped in the morning. I had a little bit left over and I made 5 in a cupcake pan. They took 12 minutes to cook.

Easy and excellent recipe! It is so creamy and smooth! I whipped this up so fast the other night when I was in a pinch for some goodies to bring to an event. I used graham cracker crumbs plus 2 tbsp melted butter and 1 tbsp sugar for the crust which made it seem like an actual cheesecake. The mini muffin size is just perfect (especially for parties) because everyone will have a small bite and think it's delicious rather than get sick of an entire muffin size cheesecake, even though these are soo good.

My boyfriend and i made this together last night for valentines day and it was great! I dont have children but im sure this is a great way to get kids involved in the kitchen. It was very easy and it was soooo good. I didnt have a baking sheet for the mini muffins so i used a medium size for cupcakes. I doubled the amount of crumbs because it was bigger and i used strawberry pie filling instead of cherry. We ate them out of the cupcake with a spoon and was a perfect serving size. Just a tip: when u beat the mixture just make sure that their are  no lumps and it should be a smooth texture. I will definitely make this again it was very good and my boyfriend liked it too! Thanks for the recipe!

I used this recipe along with the Key Lime Cheesecakes with Raspberry swirls for desserts for my DIL baby shower.  I made them in regular cup cake pans and ground up the cookies and added butter to them to make the bottom.  The rest was followed to the letter.  I put sugar free apricot jam on the top with a spritz of canned whipped cream.  Just the right sized dessert after the Tarragon-Dill chicke salad also on this site.  Nice menu and great results.  Thanks for the posting.

I have been making these for 20 yrs, except I don't crush the wafers, just put 1 in the bottom of muffin cup.  Also top with fresh strawberries or any fresh fruit you like.  Everyone loves these!

I completely cheated on this recipe by using a tub of Kraft "no bake cheesecake" mix (by the cream cheese in the grocery store). I also decided to use graham cracker crumbs (pressed with melted butter) in exchange for vanilla wafers. They were dainty and gorgeous! Be sure to take the time to find MINI muffin liners - any other size just doesn't do these little pretty little cakes justice.

I was impressed by how easy this was to make.. It was my first attempt at cheesecake and they turned out fairly well. I wasn't able to make them in my kitchen so I had to improvise - I used a blender to mix the ingredients to ensure  a smooth texture. I also used graham crackers for the crust. Used frozen strawberries & whipped cream as topping.

So easy and so delicious. As can be seen from the reviews, easy to vary to produce many flavours. Mine had to bake about 17 to 18 minutes to be done. Thanks!

Fast, fun and tasty.  I used cruhsed graham crackers and some crushed vanilla wafers.  I had a lot of the cherry pie filling leftover.  I made 12 in regular sized muffin pans.

I love this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe read. The first batch, I made in the mini-tins and the remainder I put into regular size tins (only made 7 of these.) The mini's I left plain and on the regular sized ones, I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of half and sprinkled brown sugar and put a few pecans on the remainder. They were all simply wonderful and very easy to make. Yes, I will make this again, and again, and again. But, I think the next time I'll try one of the other reviewers suggestions and add sour cream to half of the recipe to see what happens.

I am a huge fan of this recipe and will use many more times in the future.  I made the graham cracker crust base as recommended by other reviewers and baked it for 5 minutes before adding the cream cheese topping.  It came out perfect!  For toppings I used canned cherry pie filling, strawberry pie filling and melted some peanut butter chips with 2 Tbsp butter.  Mixing up the toppings made quite the festive dessert!  Thanks for this great recipe!

I used full sized muffin tins, cooked for 18 minutes which was a little too long.  They cracked but they tasted very good.  I'll make them again, next time with a water bath.  Made 24.

These were exactly what I needed for a BBQ! Easy to make, quick to bake and impressive once decorated. I used a simple graham crust (graham crumbs, butter, sugar and cinnamon), and added lemon zest to the batter. I chilled them overnight before topping 1/3 with fresh sliced strawberries, 1/3 with fresh bluberries and 1/3 with sour cream. Red, white and blue for 4th of July. Were they the best cheesecakes I've ever had? No. But they were tasty, easy to serve, and the guests loved them.

These were really good.  I wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars.  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is b/c the serving size is a little confusing.  If you are using a regular 12 muffin tin pan, this will actually make about 12-14 mini cheesecakes.  I had to double the recipe. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box.  Thank you.

Delish!!!
Used a graham cracker bottom instead of nilla wafers based on other suggestions.  Used regular cupcake pan instead of mini.
My dad has already asked me to make more! I will be trying the white chocolate variation next time :)

These were yummy.  I added a few drops of lemon juice to cut through the rich cream cheese, and it tasted pretty good.  The crust was a little loose as usually I would press down the crushed biscuits quite hard into a tin to make a no-bake cheesecake, but I couldn't compact them enough into a muffin cup.  Anyways, the taste was great.

This is my new favourite dessert recipe!! It is so quick and easy, and the results are amazing! The cheesecake is light, with just the right amount of flavour. I used TERRIMOM's suggestion and made the crust using graham crackers, margarine and sugar and it turned out fantastically. I also topped with strawberry rhubarb pie filling instead of cherry. Special thanks to LINDSAYMILLERKS for her review with 1st timer "Cheesecake Tips" - they helped a lot!

This recipe makes a lot of cheesecake!  I scaled it down to make 24 minis and it was the perfect amount.  Plus, I used mini nilla wafers and that saved time on the crushing.  A definite keeper!

These were very good. I would've given it five stars, but I modified it some so I felt like I didn't truly test out the recipe. I used a graham cracker crust (crushed up package of graham crackers, 1/3 c. powdered sugar, 4 T. melted butter) instead of the vanilla wafers suggested. Also, after they were done baking I added a little sour cream to the top of each one, on top of which I later added the cherry pie filling. Very good!

Great recipe.  I'm giving it a 4 because I did take a lot of the suggestions made by people here, rather than from the recipe itself.  I made 2 kinds: regular with strawberry and peanut butter.  I used a graham cracker base (with butter and sugar) for the regular ones, and an oreo cookie base (with just butter) for the peanut butter ones.  I made them regular-muffin sized, since I didn't have a mini-muffin pan.  Actually, I bought foil baking cups, which can stand up on their own, because I don't even have a regular muffin pan.

The regular ones with strawberry topping were made according to the recipe.  I made some strawberry sauce (frozen strawberries + sugar in a pot on medium/low heat until it reduces into a sauce) to put on top.  For the peanut butter ones, I melted some peanut butter chips in the microwave and mixed it in, then threw in another handful of peanut butter chips into the mix.

I had a bit of a problem with the baking, but it doesn't seem to weird, since I see other people had the same problems: crackling on the top, then the deflating in the middle.  I had put a pan of water underneath, which people had suggested to prevent this, but since it didn't work, next time I'll try it with a water bath.  The deflating didn't make too big of a problem, since I had the strawberry sauce to fill the dent, and the peanut butter chips kept the peanut butter ones fairly level.

I brought a bunch to work, and my co-workers loved them.  I even converted a guy who said he di

A really great base recipe, that can be tweaked tons of ways to make whatever flavour cheesecake you want! I added lemon zest and 1 tsp lemon juice to the cream cheese mix. Also substituted for oreo crumbs for the base and blueberries instead of cherries for the top. Next time I'm gonna try making a chocolate-espresso one. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I noticed some users likened them to a "cheesy omlet" or said they were too "eggy", I recommend that you don't try them until they are cold.  I remember that I got excited when I first made them and ate one while it was luke warm, it was sooo gross!  It kind of turned me off from them.  When I made them again, some time later, I waited and really enjoyed them when they were really cold.

All of my friends and family absolutely love this recipe! It is 20X better than anything store bought!! I've made it numerous times now, here are some tips:
1. Make sure cream cheese is at room temp!!
2. I crushed up graham crackers for the crust, added some butter and pressed into liners.
3. Beat ingredients until light and fluffy, a couple minutes. No reason it should not be smooth, if lumpy keep beating it will get there!

These turned out beautiful & delicious! The only thing I'd complain about is the difficulty getting them OUT of the paper muffin cups to eat! We ended up just using forks to eat right out of the cups. Still excellent though!

I love this because it's so easy to make. I did not crush the cookies the second time I made these, and it created a better "plate" with which to hold the treats. They are quite messy to eat, so have napkins ready! :D What a problem to have.

At first I was excited. These were quite easy, and they looked so pretty. My excitement waned when I finally tasted them. They weren't bad - they just weren't particularly good either. I found them bland and overly dense.

I made the recipe without tweaking any of the proportions other than doubling it and used it in a standard springform pan.  The results were a wonderfully smooth and creamy cheesecake that was not too heavy but not too light either.  Perfect!

I make this regularly and it always turns out great!  The one thing I do to cut down on time is to NOT crush the vanilla wafers.  They fit in the bottom of the muffin cup perfectly uncrushed.

I saw a recipe like this on Paula Deen's show and made this the next day! It was so easy to make, and the results were devilishly good. I normally don't care much for cheesecake, but I devoured these along with everyone else.

Delicious and SO easy.  

Replaced vanilla extract with fresh lemon juice and added lemon rind.

Just took a few minutes to put together and was a huge hit at a party.

This was a very quick and easy recipe and perfect for parties.  I cut the recipe in half nad it made exactly one tray of 24 mini cheesecakes.  I followed another reviewer's instructions and left the vanilla wafer whole for the crust.  Some of them were a little hard to shove down into the bottom of the muffin cup, but they worked pretty well.  I noticed that when you use this method, the muffin paper gets flatter and wider (since the cookie is bigger around than the paper cup), so you end up with less area in the muffin cup for cheesecake.  This was not a problem, just an observation.  I used my usual cheesecake method (all ingredients at room temp, put a pan of water in the oven on the rack under the cheesecake for hydration of the air, and NEVER open the oven door to peek).  I got busy and didn't watch the oven, so they were just slightly cracking when I got back to them at the 15 minute timer which meant that they were overcooked.  Be sure to keep an eye on these!  They tasted a little gummy and heavy to me, but that as probably because I overcooked them.  I think next time I may try to just reduce my regular cheescake recipe down and see if that works out better, but these are good for a quick and easy (but not spectacular) party dessert.

Delicious. I've made it twice so far, and I'm sure I'll do so again. 
The second time I made it, instead of using a vanilla wafer crust, I used Whipped Shortbread Cookies (found the recipe here) that I baked in miniature pie tins. Yum.

Nothing over the top, but really good!  Like others, I had waaaay too many crushed waffers.  You only need 1/3-1/2 of the box.  Cooked in a water bath for 17 minutes, then turned off and opened the oven, let them sit for another 30 min.

I baked this using cupcake size as I am not able to find the mini sized moulds... the cheesecake sunked after i took it out from the oven when it's ready and they are slightly brown on the top... maybe i should put a tray of water under the baking tin next time i try this cheesecake again... 

but the taste of it is very nice... very thick cheese... 
however, the wafer vanilla below seems a bit burnt...

Mine came out really great! When i was mixing it...there were tiny little lumps but its all smooth and creamy when it came out of the oven! I suggest turning the oven off but leaving the cheesecakes in there after the required 15 minutes of baking. After about ten minutes, take it out of the oven and stick it in the fridge to cool. 
The wafers didnt turn out that good. it didnt really taste much liek vanilla and it made the bottom all oily and greesey. i suggest not using it! it would be just adding extra sugar, fat, and trans fat! 
The cheesecake tastes great with or without the topping. Without, you get more flavor of the creamy luxurious cheesecake. It would also taste better if you added a little bit more vanilla extract. 
This recipe is sooooo easy to make! its not time consuming at all and it tastes just like the real thing!

These are awesome!  I've made them for my husband's Christmas party at work for the last three years and he's not allowed to bring anything else.  I love to bake and am always trying new recipes, but I make this one anytime I'm asked to bring cheesecake.  The nilla wafers for the crust are key.

What a fantastic recipe!!!  I made 12 dozen of them (3 full batches).  Absolutely delicious.  I brought about 4 dozen of them to work today and they are already nearly gone and it isn't even lunch time yet.  I used mini vanilla wafers instead of crushed larger ones. I was concerned that they might be too small, but they worked perfectly and a great time saver.  I also made 1/2 plain with a cherry on top and 1/2 with mini chocolate chips mixed inside and on top.  I also used the reduced fat cream cheese (trying to lower the guilt level) and they are still unbelievably rich!  No one even had a clue I used the reduced fat product (even the picky men here!).  They are a huge hit!  Definitely a keeper!

This went over great at my company potluck!! Everyone enjoyed them and thought they were store bought. I made the crust using crushed cinnoman graham crackers and butter using my food proccessor and oreos and butter. I also decorated some of them with Chocolate. They were awesome..a little time consuming to make, but well worth it!

These were great and super easy. I made my own cherry pie filling, so it wonderfully fresh. Impressed my boyfriend when I pulled these out beautiful cheesecakes after dinner. Took the rest of them to work and they were gone so quickly. Great recipe.

I only had one bar of cream cheese and I chose this recipe (and cut it in half) because it would yield a perfect amount of mini cheesecakes for our family gathering.  It was quick and simple to put together with minimal ingredients.  They tasted great with blueberry pie filling.  My family just wished I made more!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are cute and easy and taste really good...I found that my tool of choice for this recipe was a wooden skewer.  Was perfect to use when I mixed in chopped chocolate chips to half of the cakes before I baked them and worked really well when removing them from the pans.  Everyone loved these and I promised all I would make again.

Easy & Excellent!  I regretfully cut the recipe in 1/2 and they were GONE immediately!  I used Reynolds mini foil baking wraps so I didn't need a muffin pan, and I placed a whole vanilla wafer on the bottom to save time and mess.  The kitchen aide mixer was great to get rid of lumps.  Also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and cherry filling w/ splenda to cut back on calories - this definitely didn't cut back on flavor, though.  Presentation was awesome - cannot wait to take these everywhere!  Will do a combo of blueberry and cherry mini's for patriotic holidays.  Thanks for sharing!

I have wanted to make these for a long time and read all of the most helpful reviews before I attempted the recipe.  I made them for a girl's get together and everyone loved them!  I did add some butter to the crushed Vanilla Wafers to help the crust stick together and that worked nicely.  I had to reduce the cooking time to 11 minutes when using the mini muffin tins.

These are so yummy!!!! The only thing like others have said the amount of vanilla wafers is to much, I think I may only used 1/3 of the box.  Also, make sure you chill for a while, they don't come off the paper very well unless chilled.

I used a traditional graham cracker crust for these and they came out yummy.  They were more time consuming than I would have liked but definitely tasted great.

This was a good recipe.  I gave it four stars only because it doesn't taste exactly like the real stuff, but it's a good substitute.  Kids and grownups alike liked these very, very much.  I decorated them with chocolate drizzle and some with cherries.

I made this for my very first Thanksgiving dinner and they were a HUGE hit!  I was worried about burning the wafers so when i crumbled them in a bowl I added melted butter and then pressed them into the mini liners.  They came out perfectly!  It made 48 mini cheesecakes (although you will have wafers left over).  I didn't put any filling on top, I just put out the cherries and made my own caramel & pecan topping on the side and my guests helped themselves!

This was very easy and very good.  Thanks for the recipe!  I think this is my new "staple" to bring to parties!

This was my first attempt at cheesecake and I couldnt have asked for it to be any better than this. I topped it with whipped cream and cherries and drizzled chocolate sauce.

Perfect!  I was origionally going to make Erics New York style cheesecake found on this site, but forgot to buy amerato.  I had promised that I would bring the cheesecake again to a family potluck, but instead improvised and came across this recipe.  Instead of making them in mini form as the Nilla cookies did'nt fit in the pans, I used reg. pans.  They are a perfect size!  wonderful texture and great with a half partially cooked strawberry and glaze.  And easy to do.  takes hardley any time!

These were so easy to make and sooo yummy! They were a big hit! I wasn't thrilled about crushing the wafers, so I think next time I will put one whole wafer in each cup. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were so amazing, they looked great and tasted even better.  I did a few changes, cooked in a hot water bath, I added a 1/4 cup of butter to the wafers which turned out great.  I topped the cupcakes with a sourcream sauce (1/2 cup sour cream 2 tbsp sugar and 1 tsp vanilla) it served as a nice contrast a well as a base for the fresh fruit I put on top.  These were super easy and really great

Just the recipe I was looking for! My mom use to make something very similar when I was a kid and I loved them. I used Nilla Vanilla Wafers like my mom did and put one wafer (whole)right into the bottom of the mini cup instead of crushing them. Also used blueberry pie filling as I prefer it to cherry. Best thing is, these are soooo EASY to make!!

This was excellent and can easily be made ahead by one day.  I didn't put the cherry pie filling on top  until right before the party.  The recipe made 36 mini cheesecakes for me.  Will definitely make this again for get-togethers, etc...  You don't need the whole box of vanilla wafers (less than half will do and I still had leftovers) and I crushed them using my blender.  I did bake them using the mini liners.  I also followed the cheesecake tips and set the baking pan in a jelly roll pan that I filled with boiling water.  None of the cheesecakes cracked!

I made these for the holidays and I am going to make them for a Valentine's Day cocktail party. I used a few raspberry choc. chips on the bottom after the waffer and then melted more chips to go on top. A huge hit. My brother asked me why I did not make the normal size of a large cupcake. I told him eating five of these didn't make you feel as quilty. Yum!

Made these for a football tailgate.  Big hit!  I crushed the whole box of wafers first and didn't use but about 1/2 the box.  A waste.  Otherwise, great success.  Used apple pie topping.

It was a great recipe for an easy cheesecake. I didn't have much time to make a cake, but this was simple and tasted good. I didn't have the cherry pie filling or vanilla wafers, but I did make a crust out of ground oreos. For a great cheesecake that you have more time for, make Chantal's New York cheesecake.

These are so easy...and look so elegant.  I love the smaller "bite-size" of these.  I usually top with 3 different pie fillings--cherry, blueberry, and pineapple--on the same serving platter.

What a terrific recipe!!!  I made these at Thanksgiving and was asked to make at Christmas as well.  I did make them larger(regular muffin size) and I made one batch with sugar and the other with Splenda.  They were both great!  Definatlly a keeper.

I'm in charge of dessert for our family Sunday dinners.  My mother-in-law told me I had outdone myself this time!  Thank you!  I made these in regular size muffin tins and cooked them a bit longer.  They were YUMMY!!

I thought this was a very easy recipe.  It's basically the recipe for my Mom's cheesecake that I have been making for years, except this recipe calls for way too much sugar.  Especially if you are topping with more sugary things.  I used only 1/2 C sugar.
After  cream cheese was sitting out to room temp, then it blended quite nicely with all the ingredients in my Bosch stand mixer.
15 minutes was right on for the bake time, and I did mini's.

These came out great! I used crush oreos as a crust, didn’t put melted butter and it still came out good. I halved the recipe and added 2 teaspoons of lemon juice but i think it needs more.

Easy-peasy!  Couple of changes I implemented...added 1/4 c unsalted butter to wafers before adding crumbs to paper liners, then baked for 10-15 minutes. Baked cheesecakes for 25 minutes. Hubby enjoyed them!

I made 12 cupcake sized cheesecakes.
I  only had 1 1/2 cream cheese (12 ozs)  so I added 1/4 cup of plain Greek yogurt.  I also added a splash of lemon juice.  Baked @ 350 for 18 minutes

I made exactly 48 mini cheesecakes. I used cherry pie filling only placing 1 cherry on 12 of them. I used strawberry pie filling placing only 1 strawberry on 12 of them. I placed a salted caramel morsel and a dark chocolate morsel in the middle of 12 cheesecakes then baked as directed. Once cooled slightly I drizzled hot fudge topping and caramel topping and then sprinkled pecan chips on top. The last 12 I kept plain. I will definitely make again maybe trying out other flavors....

These are absolutely delicious. This recipe is slightly different than the one I’m used to, but same ingredients.  Usually I prefer to just use a whole cookie instead of crushing them.  I use the muffin liners that fit the cookie perfectly. They can be hard to find though! So for this version, I crushed the cookies very well and used a full size liner. I had to bake them a few minutes more than 15 though. These are always a favorite in my family and my kids want them every Christmas!

I’ve been making this recipe for years but I make them in a regular muffin pan.  One regular size vanilla wafer is the perfect size to form the crust inside your paper liners.  I also only use 1/2 cup of sugar which is plenty sweet and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.   Very good!  They are always the first to go!

This was okay, but I didn't really enjoy the cream cheese flavor. I couldn't taste the vanilla wafers,  the cream cheese overpowered it. Besides that, the recipe was good.

Great recipe. Made the first time exactly as written except using graham cracker crust (roughly 12-16 full sz grahams run through food processor to make into crumbs; 7-8 tbsp butter melted combine and instead of pressing into muffin papers made into small balls and rolled and flattened then set into muffin wrapper...MUCH easier to get out of wrapper than the few I pressed) instead of nilla wafers just due to personal preference. 
2nd time around I tweaked a little :-) added a little lemon juice a little less sugar and 1/2 additional tsp vanilla and each time baked for approximately 17 minutes (do NOT wait until batter is cracking!) and then just turned off the oven and left for about 45 minutes to an hour. Cheesecakes turned out AMAZING! 
Couple tips-
-absolutely NEED cream cheese room temp!!!
-before adding anything else beat till as smooth as possible!
-add sugar beat again and again nice and smooth batter needed I can't emphasize that enough from years of making cheesecakes with mom and grandma
-add in eggs and beat until just mixed and then pour/scoop into cups :-)
SO many other possibilities/additions to make chocolate cheesecake or really whatever flavor you want! Will definitely keep making!!!! Thanks!

These were such a big hit at my family bbq. So much that I am to bring this every time we get together! However I Filled the cupcake liners to the top instead of 3/4 of the way. Used graham crackers crust instead. But followed the cheesecake recipe

I first came across this recipe when I was in the Air Force in the 1980s (thank you Sgt Falkenberry!).  I’ve been using it as one of my go to take along recipes since.  It’s very flexible and can be modified with more or less sugar, different cookie crusts (pick a hard cookie) and any (or no) topping you feel like.  Do make sure you use the metal baking cups, because they’ll be easier when it comes time to eat.

I followed the recipe exactly and the result was a hit! I didn’t go for 5 stars because I had way too many crumbs left after using all the filling.  Wasted about a half of a box of mills wafers

Made these for my daughter and fiancé - didn't use any fruit as they don't care for it.  I left the vanilla wafers full size, as well.  My first attempt at cheesecake was a success!  I look forward to trying variations of this recipe!

I think you need to change the written recipe. First of all it says to use a half a teaspoon of the vanilla wafers in the wrappers. When I watched the video, it said to use a whole teaspoon.  I believe it is a whole teaspoon.. Also I would add to this recipe (that I read) that it makes about 48 cheesecakes.. I had no idea how many rappers to get ready and how many it would make. When I watched the video, it told me 48. Also I would like to add if you put the vanilla wafers in each cup crushed, they fall apart when you open them to eat them and crumbs get everywhere. I suggest you put the vanilla wafer in there whole  or I added half a box of vanilla wafers and a package of graham crackers and crush them up and added about a cup of melted butter. They turned out really good and didn't fall apart when you opened them to eat them.??

I made a crust with 2 cups of crushed vanilla wafers, 1 stick of melted butter and 1/2 cup of sugar. Put 1/2 tsp of this in the bottom of the mini muffin liner.  I used caramel ice cream topping with chopped pecans for the topping.

The cheesecake was a hit!  I used almond extract instead of the vanilla and they were delicious.  Very easy recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Wow!  This is SO easy.  And SO delicious!  I substituted lime juice (what I had) in place of vanilla like another reviewer suggested.  I have a batch baking now with no crust and made with stevia - for the diabetics and low carb folks in the family.  Can’t wait to try other flavors.  Thanks to all the reviewers who suggested enchancements.  This is a keeper.  And will look gorgeous on the holiday dessert table.

I've made this recipe several times now.  My family really loves them!  They aren't too sweet, which is what my family enjoys. Most of my family like them plain without the cherry topping. When we make the very mini cheesecakes, we don't need anywhere near the recommended amount of vanilla wafers. (I made a half batch of 24 minature "minis" and did not use anywhere near 6 oz for the 1/2 batch. I only use the recommended 1/2 teaspoon per miniature muffin cup. Next time I'll try 2 or 3 ounces of Vanilla wafers crushed for a half batch.) We really enjoy the "mini" mini cheesecakes.  One bite desserts! Of course, everyone usually picks up one, walks away, then comes back for another. Very easy to make and everyone enjoys them!

This was such a simple cheesecake to make. I've only made a no-make cheesecake before because I found baking a cheesecake intimidating. This was very easy and very tasty. 

I only made 3 changes to the original recipe. 1) I used a standard muffin/cupcake pan and cupcake liners. 2) I halved the recipe so that I wouldn't be alone with all that goodness. I was making this for only 2 people. Really, one because I'm on a diet. This yielded about 9 cupcakes. 3) I baked them for 15 minutes but they looked too loose, so I baked them for an additional 8 minutes. 

I let them cool and placed them in the fridge for about 2 hours. And then I topped them with the cherry pie filling/topping.

Well, we're eating them, but not overly thrilled about them. I thought they needed a bit more sugar, or maybe even a splash of lemon. I chose to use a whole cookie on the bottom rather than crumble the cookie. I am looking for one recipe I remember a co-worker using that had sour cream in the recipe. I'll keep looking. Sorry, but won't use this recipe again.

These were so easy to make and I made half of them gluten free by using gluten free soft baked gingerbread and snickerdoodle cookies for the crust. The gluten free were better than the traditional recipe using vanilla wafers.

I love these. There were a few false starts because I knew absolutely nothing about making cheesecake. I missed the miniature muffin tin part and had a hard time figuring out why my batch never made as many as the recipe said it should. I also had to cook mine a little longer since they were bigger which led to me over baking a few times which makes the mixture a little eggy.  They were still good, but you didn't get that rich creamy cheesecake texture or taste. You want there to still be a little jiggle in the middle. Once I got it down though, these were great. I bring them (as well as Paula Deen's sausage balls) to work potlucks and there are never any left over.

The crust I made with graham crackers but will maybe add less butter next time and use brown sugar instead, after being refrigerated overnight I can truly enjoy the cheesecake! So delicious this recipe is perfect not too sweet and allows the fruit on top to give it the sweetness to perfection not an overload

I made this the way the recipe was written, and it was fabulous! Doesn't even need any toppings. Just a FYI, you won't use the whole bag of wafers. I crushed  about half of the box and had some of the crushed mixture leftover.

I followed some of the suggestions offered by other reviewers: let the cream cheese warm to room temperature before using (or heat it for 30 seconds-1 minute in the microwave), didn't completely crush the vanilla wafers (which helped them stick together better), and taking them out of the oven before they cracked (when possible). Rich, but not too sweet, these really are delicious! I'm excited to try them again but with other mix-ins.

It didn't set well. The crust at the bottom didn't stay attached good, but maybe I didn't add enough. They tasted good but not great.

I have made these several times, and they have been perfect each time! To appeal to different tastes, I made an Oreo crust . Instead of grinding them, I put them whole into the bottom of the tins, this helped to prevent crumbling. I then put them in the oven and they came out amazing! I served most of these with either whip cream and strawberries, Oreos and whip cream, and Reese's peanut butter cups and whip cream. If I had to criticize one thing about them it would be the density of them, but they were still delicious!

Delicious, easy recipe! I picked this since so many other cheesecake recipes required it to sit overnight - which probably does make it taste better, but even just eating after cooling it was still delicious. Another reviewer mentioned omitting the vanilla for lemon juice but instead I used one teaspoon of each - not sure what it did to the flavor, but the result was delicious. For the crust I used crushed oreos mixed with melted butter (to add a chocolate flair) - yum!  For sauce I pureed a cup of frozen raspberries then heated it on the stove with about 1/3 cup of sugar and a tablespoon of cornstarch - delicious fresh fruit topping alternative to jarred sauce!

I've tried many different cheesecake recipes and I enjoy this one the most. Every once in a while I will add a bit of condensed milk and I will smash the cookies along with cinnamon graham crackers to make a crust for slightly bigger cheesecakes.

Super easy to make and delicious!  I exchanged the white sugar for raw coconut sugar and it changed the color to tan but flavor was on point. I also used cinnamon graham crackers in place of teddy graham's.

This is my "go to" mini cheesecake recipe. You can't go wrong with this easy recipe. I save time by using whole cookies for my crust, either the mini round thin wafer cookies for my tassie pan or butter cookies/vanilla wafers/chocolate cookies for the muffin pan. They fit perfect and make a very nice crust. I top the cheesecakes with a variety of fruits or leave plain. This is a quick and easy dessert to make. I get about 16 cupcake sized cheese cakes.

I made these yesterday and it's a great recipe. The taste is unbelieveable and overall it's a simple recipe to follow. However, my father kept complaining that they were too soft and white. I may try to cook them for a little longer next time perhaps. To me they were pretty darn good.

I always follow the instructions exactly the first time I try any new recipe. This was easy and delicious. I made it for a pot luck at work and got lots of compliments. Aside from taste, the best part is that these are tiny portions. Enough to satisfy a craving for cheesecake without the guilt. I'll definitely make it again and again.

Very easy recipe!  It was not as cream cheese tangy as I like so next time I will lessen or omit the vanilla or use a tad bit more cream cheese.  The nilla wafers were a great change of pace from the old school graham crackers everyone uses but I had TONS left over so I will cut that in half next time.    Everyone loved these and they were all gone at the end of the Bbq so I will definitely make these again.

I added a tablespoon of lemon juice, and placed a whole cookie in the bottom of a cupcake liner instead of mini. I baked for 17 minutes and they were perfect! This recipe is awesome and I've made it several times, always a crowd pleaser.

Made half a recipe, and it was perfect for a standard six-muffin tin. I substituted Neufchatel cheese, and it works fine. I'll follow some of the other tips here (smoothness of batter, temperature of cheese) for even better results :-) Great simple recipe!

I cut the recipe in 1/2 and prepared everything in my Vitamix, w/2-3 additions and baked it in a regular pan which fit into my toaster oven. (This afternoon high is 107°F, so there was no using my large oven.)

So far, the best mini cheesecake recipe. I added 2 tbs of melted butter to the vanilla wafers crust. Also added 1 cup of melted white chocolate chips to the cheese batter, and so I reduced the amount of sugar to less than 3/4 cups so it won't get too sweet. Believe me, white chocolate gives the cheesecake an amazing flavor and creaminess. 
The second time I made two patches, one with Nella wafers and topped it with strawberries and blueberry, the second I added toasted coconut flakes and miniature Chocolat chips, with oreo crust. They are the best!

Brought to a July 4 BBQ.  Made a great presentation and everyone was impressed!  Delicious and easy!   Note regarding yield:  I got 48 mini (1-1/2") cheesecakes out of the batter.  I had a little batter leftover which was just enough for two regular muffin-size cheesecakes.  Topped half of them with strawberry pie filling and the other half with blueberry pie filling.  I only baked one tray at a time in the oven to make sure they baked evenly and I left them in 15 minutes.  Tip: Try to just use  mainly the fruit from the filling and less liquid to top each one... Since they are so small, you don't want the topping running over the edge and making a mess.

These are fantastic little treats!  I didn't trust that the nilla wafers wouldn't crumble so I melted about 1/3 c. of butter and mixed it into the crushed wafers.  Other than that, I followed suggestions by others, let your cream cheese warm up to room temp. before using, and whip it til it's smooth and creamy before adding the other ingredients.

I made these for a ribbon cutting ceremony at my office and they were a hit!  Though I think next time instead of using canned fruit, I'll use fresh.

This recipe tastes really good, but I'm giving it 4 stars because the vanilla wafers weren't the best crust. They were really dry and crumbled off the cheesecake easily. Next time I'll do a graham cracker crust I think. These freeze really well though and honestly I thought they were even better when eaten frozen!

I did not use paper liners and instead of crushing the vanilla wafers I used mini vanilla wafers and placed one in the bottom of each muffin cup. They seemed to bake best in a dark pan vs a silver colored pan. They turned out adorable and were a hit.

When I mixed all of the ingredients together, it ended up being a chunky mess, even though it tastes alright. To remedy this, I added sugar in halves and added eggs one at a time, beating for 30 secs to a minute in between. I ended up using only about half of my Nilla Wafer crust mix, and ended up having to make another half batch of the cream cheese filling. Overall a good recipe and an amazing dish.

I'm a huge fan of how simple but good this is. I've tried very complicated cheesecake recipes that always failed, but this seems foolproof. I made a quarter batch to test them (and the use up the extra cream cheese I had in my fridge) and they are wonderful! Classic and yummy. I baked them for 13 minutes instead of fifteen and replaced the wafer crust with a Oreo one (crushed Oreos mixed into a paste with melted butter) and sprinkled the extra cookie bits on top.

I only had one package of cream cheese so I only used half of the recipe!! They came out amazing!! Instead of using vanilla wafers I used crumbled grab, crackers, added a little melted butter and pressed it down into the cupcake liners for a real cheesecake taste! I did not have an electric mixer at the time so I used a whisk (some parts of the cream cheese did not completely dissolve but it's okay) and popped them into the oven and they came out amazing!! However I do highly suggest cooling them in the fridge instead of on a rack because they stick better and taste good cold!

These were soooo good!! I did 2" mini muffin cups and I followed someone else's suggestions because I never made cheesecake before I beat the cream cheese for a minute or 2 first then sifted in the sugar and beat them added eggs one at a time (I only added 2!! Not 3) then instead of vanilla I added 2 tbsp of lemon juice they were such a hit I had none left!! And one recipe made half of what it said bc I used 2" mini muffin liners

I did a sample size , by using one package of cream cheese, oil lemon extract about 4 drops, same amount of sugar and one egg. I put it in keblers mini graham cracker pans made enough for 6. equals to one package. When I went to cook it i pretty heat to 375. put it in the oven for 10 minutes then turn the oven to 200° for 5 minutes then turn it off and left it in the oven for another 5 minutes. I took it out let it cool for 10 minutes before I place it in the fridge for at least an hour . This method avoids cracking and dropping.

Because I am on a gluten free diet, I used 2 cups crushed gluten free cocoa crispies and a stick of melted butter and pressed them into a silicone cake pan. I topped with the cheesecake mixture and baked for about half an hour. Non gluten free people were surprised about how good it was, next time, I will add chocolate chips into the cheesecake.

Great party favor, and get requested to make these at least once a month. I use normal sized muffin tins to make larger cheesecakes. I normally use chocolate oreos as the bottom (yum) with the cheesecake. The most popular I top with raspberry jam (melt on stove then glaze the top) or I melt peanut butter on top of the cheesecake and crumbles of bacon.. This makes chocolate raspberry and peanut butter chocolate bacon. Always a hit, and have never taken any home.

This is good but not great cheesecake. Definitely cute though! I used a regular muffin tin with a whole vanilla wafer in the bottom, much faster prep time. Doing it this way, I ended up with 24 cakes. I'd make this again for a bridal or baby shower.

Thank you for sharing.  I took other suggestion and made a graham cracker crust with approx 1/2c crackers and melted butter (pressed firmly into cups).  I added a 1-1/2 tsp of lemon juice & typically add a little zest if I have a lemon on hand.  It needs the zip.  I needed to bake more like 17 min and let them cool w/ the door ajar.  Really yummy!

I think these are very tasty - but I certainly didn't need to crush up an entire 12 oz box of vanilla wafers.  Probably 15 0r 20 wafers would do.  You can always crush more if you need to.

I tried this recipe and it was my first time making cheesecake and it was so good! My familly loved it! I also tried making a whole cheesecake which turned out fantastic! I always add a strawberry sauce on top which is the bomb! The only thing i do differently is i add butter to my crust. I highly recomend this recipe to anyone of any age.

I work at a home for elderly people and this recipe was such a hit. I did the graham cracker crust instead of the vanilla wafers, and since I had a lot of the cost mix left over I went ahead and sprinkled it on top and it was perfect because it added an extra crunch to it.

This recipe is great as-is, though I've tried a few alterations with some success.  For one, if I have time, I use crushed graham crackers (Magic Bullet) with a little butter pressed into the cups and baked for 5 minutes to get them crustier.  And I just use raspberry, blueberry, and other jams/preserves -- more useful to have open jars of that in the fridge than unused cherry pie filling, though that tastes great too!  If your audience likes cheesecake, they'll love these!

This was a fantastic recipe! I followed the recipe pretty close. I didn't have vanilla wafers but I did have un-frosted sugar cookies in the freezer so i put those in the food processor and used that for my crust. I used some of the suggestions in the reviews and put the eggs in one at a time and beat until fluffy. I had attempted in the past to make cheese cake and it turned out horrible, later I read all the things i did wrong. One of the things I learned from my last cheesecake disaster was to set your pan in water to even the baking. So I did that with these guys. Don't know if it made a difference, but they came out perfect! I made blueberry pie filling and used that for my topper. Very good recipe and will absolutely use this recipe again. Thanks for posting!

I made this recipe months ago for the first time and my family and I loved it. I bake it a few times a month now. My friends from work love it, even my customers love it. This is a great recipe and everyone should try it. I'm not a cheesecake person but this cheesecake was amazing. I never made it with the filling though because I don't think anyone that I know would like it. So, I keep it plain and it still tastes so good.

These were a bit messy, but they tasted good. They were fairly easy to make but the "crust" was extremely crumbly. I may try them again but overall, not very good finger food.

wow!! I also made it into ice cream! I baked it in a loaf pan,25-30 minutes, and after it cooled, folded the whole thing slightly, put in a tupperware bowl, and in the freezer it went!! strawberry was also yummy. I also made chocolate chip, no jam on top, and crushed choc-chip cookies on bottom, either home made or store bought. Yummy

This was my first time making cheesecake period. I followed what other people commented on the reviews about first time cheesecake bakers. The only thing I was disappointed in was that the crushed wafers didn't stick to the bottom of the cheesecake as much as it should.

Accidentally used cream cheese spread rather than cream cheese and it worked out perfectly! Instead of a vanilla wafer crust, I used chocolate cookie crumbs, held together by a bit of butter and applesauce. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup peanut butter. TIP: Make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature before using.

Made these for my husband using regular muffin tins, premade mini pie crusts, and strawberry pie filling for the top of the cheesecakes. He loved it! Would definitely make again!

I crush the vanilla wafers in the food processor for speed and uniformity.  After spooning the crumbs into the paper cups I press them down with a small spice jar.  After that the remaining steps are quick and easy.

This is a great recipe for the holidays. They look great arranged on a green plate.

My family and friend love them!

Really good! They didn't need any tweaking--just a straight-up delightful cheesecake. I used reduced-fat cream cheese and low-calorie vanilla wafers and you wouldn't be able to tell they weren't full-fat. I definitely recommend doing so. Also, this cheesecake is more on the cream cheese-y side, it has a kick. I personally like that, so 5 stars it is.

This was my first time making cheesecake.  If I knew it was so easy and quick I would have been making cheesecake for years.  I did find this recipe a bit sweet for my taste so I reduced the sugar content to 2/3 cup instead of 3/4 cup.  I used a graham cracker crust that i found in one of the other reviews comment.  Yummy!

We also made the crust out of oreos and melted butter.  My family liked the oreo crust better than the original.  This is a great recipe to play around with.

These are very good - I used regular muffin tins (if you do this watch, you may need a little more cooking time) - and glueten free cookies on the bottom. I also made sure the cream cheese was at room temperature first - and I added a wee bit of almond extract.

I would call them "OK".  Seems like they needed something.  Maybe lemon juice, not sure. But they needed a little zest of some sort. 
I do have a gripe about the way the recipe is written, calling for a box of wafers. After crushing nearly all of the cookies and commencing to bake, I discovered it really only requires a few handfuls  of cookies.  So, when I was done, I was left with a box full of crushed wafers.

Easy recipe. When served without topping, cheesecakes taste a little too "vanilla-y" for my liking. Cheesecake tend to stick a little to the paper liners, so perhaps foil would be better. Overall, though, I enjoyed this recipe.

I loved these mini cheesecakes! SO yummy :) I made them for a potluck and I made the mistake of not keeping them in the fridge long enough, and they lost some consistany from sitting out. Make sure you let them sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

I followed the instructions word-for-word and these did not turn out. Crust: soggy, cheesecake: tasteless. Really disappointed in myself because I didn't follow my gut after reading this recipe since at first glance thought this recipe was off. This is the first time I am giving a poor rating on a recipe on this site...a site I use quite often.

Not only are these fantastic, they are easy to make!  My husband, kids, family, and friends all love them.  I've also substituted blueberry filling for the cherry and they are just as good.  If you are thinking about trying this receipe - GO FOR IT!

Easy to make....everyone seemed to like them even if they didn't LOOK the greatest! But, it worked out well and people continually ask me to make them again!! These were also easy to be creative with the toppings....just find whatever fruit you have or use white or dark chocolate for the top!!!

very easy, tasty and impressive! i used light digestive crumbled with some melted butter for the base. used a mini cheesecake pan, cooked it for 12 mins, cooled for 2 hrs, and drizzled chocolate ganache. i tried different topping like strawberries and milk choc ganache, raspberries and white choc ganache, chopped mangoes..endless topping options! its my no. 1 recipe for mini cheesecakes :)

These were a huge hit at my family gathering recently.  I did have to make two practice batches because they kept turning out too soggy in the middle, but once I got the timing down  and refrigerated them for a few hours before serving, they turned out great!  I suggest using blueberry pie filling, that was the family favorite.

These were amazing.  Didn't have a mini tray so used a regular muffin tray and baked for 25min.  Put some fresh strawberry slices on top (instead of pie filling) and they looked as good as they tasted.  

My husband is gluten free so instead of the wafers I crushed several gluten free pecan cookies as the crust and it turned out delicious.

For the small amount of ingredients required this deserves more than 5 stars! Quick, simple and SO delicious! I used a 400 gram tub of smooth cream cheese, 2 eggs, 1 Tbsp Vanilla, 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice and half a cup of splenda! A little more healthy and divine! If you are hesitant to try this, don't be! It doesn't compare to real purist cheesecake but it's not bad for being so easy and quick!!!! GIVE THIS A TRY!

A new favorite! I used a full cup of sugar and filled regular-sized muffin cups. I topped the cheesecakes with a mango puree which I thickened with sugar and corn starch. Delicious!

OMG, my husband and kids cannot get enough! What an easy and versatile recipe! I didn’t make any changes to this recipe; other than the cherries. I’m not a big fan of cherries, so instead I found a raspberry coulis recipe for the topping and also added fresh berries on top. DELICOUS! I will definitely be making theses over and over again!

These were good. It doesn't have a rich creamy taste/texture as a traditional cheesecake recipe would but for a quick dessert that looks great, it works. I drizzled each cheesecake with chocolate syrup and topped with fresh raspberries and blueberries.

These were good and easy to make. I followed some suggestions and used a regular size muffin pan and put a whole nilla wafer at the bottom. They were very soft and hard to get out of the wrapper. Next time I will freeze before serving. Although, I didn't hear any complaints at my book club ;)

I followed the recipe all the way except for taking the advice of other reviewers and using crushed graham crackers with a little butter for the crust instead of vanilla wafers. The cheesecakes were very bland and the crust falls off the bottom when you peel away the paper liners. Probably won't make these again and no one said they were special.

Amazing recipe! Much easier and less time than the traditional cheesecake!  I didn't have a mini muffin tin, so I made them in regular muffin tins. I halved the recipe in half, and I ended up with 9 regular sized cheesecakes. And I baked for around 17-18 minutes.  Blueberry sauce (that I got from this site) was an absolutely perfect addition with little prep!  I will most definitely be making this again! :)

These are really good, but the only thing is that it didn't even come close to making the 40-something servings it says it will make. In fact, if you want your cakes to have any kind of mass at all, I'd say to plan on about 25-30 out of a single batch.

This recipe turned out just ok for me. I used a graham cracker crust instead which didn't really stick together. Overall, just an ok recipe.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe. I used both the graham cracker and vanilla wafer crust because i just thought that the flavor from the oreos  would be to much for the bite size cheesecakes. using a cookie scoop to measure out the filling worked great, I think when i make these again i will add lemon juice and omit the vanilla flavoring.

These were very good, and easy to make.  I topped some with cherry pie filling, and some with blueberries in a blackberry jam and orange liquer sauce which I have from another cheesecake recipe.  I did something quite stupid, which was I used the wrong kind of vanilla "wafers".  I used those ones that are sandwiched with frosting in the middle.  I actually thought this crust was great, although it got a tiny bit soggy.

I didn't care for the crust, it was too crumbly.  I would make a grahm cracker crust next time.  The filling was good!  Make sure to beat the room temp cream cheese until very light and fluffy before slowly adding the other ingredients.  Topped with cherry pie filling and drizzled melted Hersey chocolate.  The girls at my party loved these!

These were a fantastic hit! I wasn't able to find miniature muffin cups liners, so I lined regular sized muffin cups and used those instead. I had to add a few extra minutes baking time because of that. I topped them with a strawberry sauce made from seedless jam and some lemon juice, fresh strawberries, and shaved chocolate. Delicious!

They were just ok for me.  It was my first attempt at cheese cake, so maybe it will be better the second time.  The taste was fine, but not unbelievably good, which I require for my cheesecake.

Very good looking, very good tasting!  Made these and brought them to work, everyone loved them!!  I topped some with cherries, some with blueberries, and some with almond paste decorated with slivers of almond.  I was dubious about the crust, but it held together well.  Great!

Yummy dessert!  I used a graham cracker crust instead - I am not a big fan of vanilla wafers.  These were so nice b/c you can have a small portion instead of a huge piece.  I will make these again.

awesome recipe, i just made a test batch and it came out better than i expected since this is the first time i attempted making cheesecake.  i recommend this recipe to anyone! i will be bringing this to the potluck barbeque in a couple weeks.. :) the changes that i made are: i used graham cracker instead of vanilla wafers and i also used strawberry instead of cherry topping.  the next time i make this it will be a white chocolate strawberry cheesecake! YUM!

These were outstanding.  Made for a party and they were gone before any other dessert!  Used 1/3 less fat cream and added a few tbsp of lemon juice, but otherwise stuck to the recipe exactly.  Simply wonderful!

Turned out awesome! I actually ended up cutting the recipe in half because I only had a limited amount of cream cheese on hand. I used graham cracker crumbs & butter & sugar to form a crust and I put all this in 3 little tart pans & baked for 15 minutes and they turned out perfectly. Awesome Recipe. Thanks = ]

These always disappear quickly at my house!  I don't use half as many wafers as listed in the recipe and still have leftovers.  Also, instead I top each cheesecake with fresh sliced strawberries or blueberries.

Delicious!  I would fill each cup with more crushed wafers, if you want it to stretch further.  This made 75 cheese cakes and I have tons of left over crumbs!  I will definately make it again.

I really like using this recipe as a base.  I make my own graham cracker crust.  The filing stays the same.  But you can put whatever you want on top, cherry pie filling, strawberry jam, melted chocolate or caramel.  I usually put strawberry jam, melted a little so I can drizzle it across the cheesecakes.  One tip I heard was right before the cheesecakes are done cooking, turn off the oven and let them sit in there until the oven has cooled.  I don't know how much it helped.  But everyone loves these when I make them.

Great Taste and texture. I used a regular sized muffin pan. Why did the middle Sink? I filled it with jam anyway so you couldnt really tell. And there I made a big mess trying to get them out of the pan. Any Suggestions?

I thought I'd try this recipe because of all the high reviews.  I don't like it as  much as the one I usually use.  It wasn't bad, just not as good as my tried and true recipe.

I made these last weekend for a wedding reception and a school faculty party.  I made a couple hundred.  Some had cherry pie filling on top and the others had madarine oranges (for Chinese New Year).  I used shortbread cookies for the crust.  They were gone in no time.  Especially popular with the men!!

Made these little morsels for an appreciation supper, among some other types of desserts - these were gone instantly!  Thanks to MPCHARVAT's suggestions the white chocolate raspberry and mini chocolate chip cheesecakes turned out awesome.  I will definitely be making these again and again.  Did make a chocolate graham cracker crust instead of the nila wafers and baked them a little longer than the recipe says - but they turned out great!

These were GREAT!!! I made them as a snack dessert for a Christmas eve dinner at my MIL's house.  Make sure you follow the tips for making cheesecake though!!! I didn't use the crust recipe, instead being more comlicated and making them in phyllo dough (which I had never used before.)

Exceptional!  Used a regular graham cracker crust (crumbs, sugar & butter)and pressed in the bottom of paper liners.  This was a wonderful (and easy) holiday dessert for a crowd.  I put some raspberries on the top of each and drizzled dark chocolate on the top.

Average tasting, my daughter said they look better than they taste.  Took others advice and added some lemon juice.  I also used regular size muffin cups with a singe wafer for crust and baked for 22 min, then shut off oven for 30 and left inside.

I couldn't find the mini cupcake liners so I made in the regular size cupcake baking tins. The cheesecakes turned out delicious, but I had a really hard time getting them out of the cupcake tin - several fell apart and were kind of messy. But once I got the hang of it I salvaged the rest. Received lots of compliments!! I will make in the mini ones next time!

Just made these...they were just ok. Maybe I'm using the wrong mini-tins (meas. 1 1/2" approx in diamter). Used graham crackers (mix w/sugar & margarn) as suggested but no way could I fill a tblsp each cup. The bottom didn't seem cooked enough after 15 mins. Seems like you really need to use a larger size tin. I'll see what my family (going over there for dinner) thinks tonight!

I mde these for a home party and they were so good and easy, I made them for our church tea.  I also just trimmed down the wafers because I couldn't see how they would stick together if they were crushed.  I only got 36 of the mini muffin size.  I used Christmas papers and cherry pie filling.  So what if they crack a little on top?  They also fall a bit, but not much.  1 heaping teaspoon of batter was the perfect amount.

These were a hit when I served them with Blueberry Sauce and Strawberries and Wine (both recipes from this site) instead of canned topping.  I used 1 wafer per cupcake liner, less work and muy bueno.  These were devoured before the main meal was served.

I have tried this recipe and it is great! Instead of vanilla wafers however I use pecan shortbread cookies. It's so easy I just pop one in the bottom of the cupcake paper and fill as usual. They're wonderfull. Family and friends rave.

Just made these for a party. I made two batches and I made exactly 100. 
I'm not a baker and thankfully I don't have to be as this recipe was that easy!Now, I don't know if it's because I have a gas stove, which seems to cook things faster, but mine were done in just under 9 mins. 
thanks for an easy, great tasting recipe!

Thank you for this recipe!

I made some of them chocolate by adding 2 T of cocoa and an extra 1 T of sugar and used the chocolate wafer crust from this site. 

Delicious! Well recieved!

Wow, these are great!  They really exceeded my expectations of such an easy recipe.  I made the recipe with the mini wafers on the bottom and they turned out great.  Instead of a fruit topping, I made "Fruit Dip II" which is incredible and put it on top.  They were a hit!

This was exactly what i was looking for. I didnt have any cracker type things on hand so i used crushed Honey bunches of oats added a bit of sugar. I made the recipe smaller, used fat free cream cheese, and changed the topping to strawberries 
(mixed with a touch of honey) with a dot of whipped cream. Perfect!

Made these for a Christmas party and everyone gobbled them up.  (You don't use an entire box of vanilla wafers).

i cooked this for my partner last night and it went quite well. I halved the recipe to make 24 but it only made just over 10 mini cheesecakes so my tray may have been to big. I thought the pie filling was a slightly over powering taste and it would have been better if it was "set" on the cakes. I used arnotts shreaded wheat buscuits as suggested from another forum and this worked well.

Janice, thank you for a wonderful recipe. This is one of the best and easiest recipes I've found on the site in a long time. I was looking for something quick, easy, and good to take to work for a baby shower, and these really delivered. We will definitely make this recipe again - and again!

These were so good.  After reading reviews I am glad I did not use a 12 oz box of vanilla wafers.  I did not even need half the box.  This was so easy to do.  Followed directions to a "T".  Took to a family function and had none leftover.  Thanks

YUM! I did these a little differently- used regular muffin cups, with graham wafer crumb bottoms but were still excellent. I'm making more tonight for Easter at work and I'll use Oreo crumbs and I'll put a Tbsp or 2 of cocoa to make it chocolate cheesecake. Thanks for such a versatile recipe! Will use over and over! Verrry easy and quick!

Made these for a Valentine's Day dessert and everybody loved them.  I used graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers and added a fresh berry compote instead of canned fruit.  Really Easy and Really Yummy!

i'm a new cook and was very pleased when guests were asking me for my recipe and men and women were going back for seconds.  the only thing i changed was adding a full tsp of wafer crumbs for a thicker crust and using one cherry with little syrup on top to balance out all the flavors.  everyone loved it.  thank you!

Well, I was looking for a cheesecake recipe that I could make low carb & still taste pretty good.  I had tried other recipes & my boyfriend was not too satisfied with it.  This recipe did the trick! :D  I omitted the crust at the bottom & used Splenda instead of reg. sugar. I made 12 nice sized lil cakes in my mini muffin pan & after they cooled I used fresh sliced strawberries for the topping.  DELISH!...and VERY satisfying for my low carb diet! My boyfriend said "Oh fiiiinally u found something good!" Thank you!

We absolutely loved the texture of this cheesecake, especially the next day after it had thickened a little more.  I ended up using 4 4-inch heart shaped springform cake pans and baked these for 25 minutes.  They turned out perfect.  I only needed about 1/2 the vanilla wafers for these cakes.  I'll use this recipe again very soon.

These were a huge hit, especially for their portability. I would recommend adding some lemon zest to the "original" version of this cheesecake if you plan on serving it plain. Also, you probably will not need nearly as many cookie crumbs as suggested. Great Recipe, though! :)

They turned out so cute!  And it was hard to mess up, too, so it's an easy enough recipe for such a somewhat complicated cake - the cheesecake.  :o)  The vanilla wafers are such a great idea... everyone loved it.  I added mini semisweet chocolate chips to half of the batch and left the other half plain.  For the plain half, I added a Hershey kiss or a mini Snickers on top of each little cheesecake.  Yummy!  My boyfriend's sister also baked these, and she used the cherries for her topping.  Those were really tasty, too!  Thanks for sharing!  :o)

i loved loved loved these!!! i didn't have any cookie crumbs available, but i did have some chocolate cake, so i just crumbled that up and baked it a bit to dry it out before i put it in the muffin liners. i made about 1/2 the recipe and made 11 larger cheesecakes with the chocolate bottom. for 2 of them i put chocolate chips on top and for 3 of them i melted the chips and mixed it into the cream cheese mixture. i baked it for about 25 minutes, and am letting them cool. they are SOO good, seriously i would buy these. i'm eating one as we speak as the others are cooling. thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. This is the best way to eat cheesecake! They do disappear really fast so make sure you make enough for everyone and make sure to refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

I got many compliments on these many cheesecakes.  I baked them in a water bath like many suggested and did not have a problem with burning.  I served them with cherry pie filling and they were immediately devoured.  I will be making these again.

This recipe was so easy and the cheesecakes were delicious!  I topped mine with chocolate and caramel instead of the fruit topping.  I took them to a friend's house and there was none to take home!

This is always a quick and easy recipe.  It's tasty and looks nice too.  

I also use blueberry pie filling and chocolate chips to top the cakes.  I have also used fresh fruit when in season.

These went pretty fast at our Christmas party.  Used cherry pie topping, melted butterscotch chips, and a turtle topping, as well as leaving some plain.  11 oz. of vanilla wafers was way too much for the crust.  I was able to get 72 cakes out of the batter instead of just 48. Update 11/29/08: I had forgotten about this recipe for a couple of years but rediscovered it for Thanksgiving. Again, I got about 72 cakes out of the recipe and again everyone devoured them. What I did differently was use two different packages of "100 calorie" type cookies for the crust and did not smash them. It worked out perfect and was very easy.

I made this recipe for my friends during christmas time and it was really good.  I think my cream cheese wasn't soft enough to beat together with the sugar but I was in a rush so I used an electric hand-held machine that is supposed to puree stuff to mix it together.  It actually worked out really well and it saved me some hard work.  I topped it with lemon, cherry, and blueberry pie fillings, so good!

I found this recipe to be extremely good and very easy to bake. I substituted graham cracker crumbs for the vanilla wafers, which I added a little butter and granulated sugar to, and then pressed it into the mini muffin tins. I used this recipe to cater an event and got rave reviews!

Wow, this recipe was great!  Turned out fantastic and tasted so good.  I had problems with the crust & filling sticking to the sides so we had to eat with a fork but it was worth it.  Will definitely make again.

I made these for a party - they were very good.  I couldn't find mini muffins liners, so I sprayed the tins with canola oil and ran a knife around the outside to loosen them after they cooled.  I think they would keep better with the liners.  These made 46 mini cheesecakes for me.

These were very tasty!  :)  I opted to make 12 cup-cake sized cheesecakes instead of the mini cheesecakes.  I increased the bake time and was really pleased with the way they turned out!  I will keep this recipe and use it often!  Thanks for sharing!

I really wanted these to turn out, although the crust was very dry and burnt.  The cheescake part was great.  I think they may need to be cooked much less and butter should be added to the crust.  I will make these again, as they are super cute, but I will probably use my regular cheesecake recipe.  I topped half with whipped cream and blackberries and the other half with melted chocolate and slivered almonds.

These mini cheesecakes are real gems.  I made some mini cheesecakes in the tassie pan and some in my regular muffin pan for larger "treats" (of course I cooked those for 5 minutes longer).  I have three words to describe them...Fab U Lus!  Yummy!  I can't wait for a special occasion where I can make them and wow all my friends.

I would give these a 5. They were quick, the recipe was accurate in measurment and cooking time and it tastes great. A good basic recipe and can be varied to suit. We made some with mini choc. chips sprinkled on top, some with 1/2tsp of seedless blackberry jam, some with choc. graham cracker crumbs etc.

These were delicious- though I didn't get 48 minis out of the recipe.  I only got about 35.  I used cherry topping on some and blueberry on the others.  The cherry were definitely prefered.

These are awesome.  I used a whole vanilla wafer on the bottom of 2" cupcake liners.  They were so great.  My whole family loved them.  I would like to try this recipe to make a regular sized cheesecake.  I don't know if it will work, but I am going to check the other reviews. Thanks Janice for sharing.

These were sooo easy, and they came out great. My very first attempt at cheesecake. I topped mine with strawberries and then drizzled with melted chocolate, some white, some milk. These were for a nieces party, everyone loved my "gourmet" mini cheescakes!

I didn't have any vanilla wafers so I used the "Graham Cracker Crust I" found on this site for the crust.  The cheesecakes came out great and went well with the fruit blueberry topping I made.  Great recipe.

Delicious and easy!  A huge hit.  But I had to double the suggested amount for the little crusts.  And it really isn't necessary to grind up a whole box of cookies.  1/3 of the box would have been enough.

This recipe was not only simple to make but was delicious! Guests loved the mini cheesecakes because they didn't feel like they were completely blowing their diet.

This recipe is soooo easy to make! Blend ingredients 2,3,4 & 5 with a mixer, it makes it very creamy. I make these for our church fish fry every year and they are gone before my husband can get to the dessert table.(I have to make a double batch each time because they go so fast.)Any fruit topping will do.

Wonderful!  I made these for a family get together and they were a big hit!  The only thing i did different was add a splash of almond flavoring to the cherries.  Will make these again and again!

I made these for a New Year's Eve party and they were gobbled up!  I mixed chocolate chips into the batter (instead of putting fruit on the top) and garnished with a sprig of mint.  Will definitely make these again!
