After reading other reviews, I made a couple of changes.  I used 2 cups of grated zucchini, and I cut the white sugar back to 1/2 cup. I also used 1 cup applesauce instead of oil.  I also baked it for about 40 minutes, but I have a convection oven.  This bread was moist, and it was a great way to use up both bananas and zucchini.

My whole family loved this recipe! The only reason I didnâ€™t give it 5 stars is because I did change it just a tiny bit. I left out the nuts and cranberries and only used 2/3 cup Sugar. Also I used Cinnamon Plus (a cinnamon spice blend for pampered chef that has nutmeg, allspice, orange peel, cloves, & ginger) instead of just cinnamon. I cooked it in a muffin pan (making 24 muffins) instead of loaf pans. It takes less time to cook so keep an eye on the muffins. I think it was about 25-30 minutes.

Delicious! As others suggested I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the zucchini to 2 cups. Will make again!

I followed the recipe and made a few changes, instead of a cup of white sugar i to only use 1/2 cup to cut back on the amount of sugar being used, i also added in 3 tablespoons of ground golden flaxseed, and i put in 1/4 cup of Herseys  cocoa and it turned out wonderful my whole family loves it.

Pretty good but could use way more banana; 2 mashed bananas equals 2/3 cup which is not much for 2 whole loaves. I found it a bit dry and think adding more banana next time will help. I also doubled the cranberries and nuts; toasted the nuts in the microwave for more flavor.

WOW!!! This was fantastic!! Hands down the best bread I have EVER had!! I can't even explain it but the bananas added just something extra texture and flavor wise that really amps up your normal zucchini bread!

I subbed applesauce for the oil,halved the white sugar and left out the nuts and cranberries, as I was making these for breakfast for my one year old. I made them into mini muffins, which my little one loves- they are just her size and produce little waste. The mini muffins take about 15 minutes and the regular muffins (which I made for me!) take about 22. I always wonder about timing when I bake in another size pan, so I thought I would share. These were very yummy!

This was pretty good.  I didn't think it was "great", but I made some changes, so I might have done that on my own.  I substituted apple sauce for the oil to make it healthier.  It was somewhat dry, and this may have caused that, even though I have subbed apple sauce before to other recipes without any problems.  I also reduced the white sugar to 1/3 cup.  It was a good amount of sugar.  1 cup would have been way too much.  I also switched out pecans for walnuts.  Also, it only needed to bake 35-40 minutes.  I took it out after 40, but since it was a bit dry, maybe it could have come out even sooner. Overall, it was very good, just a little dry. Will probably play around with it & try it again.

Very good.  I made it in mini loaf pans, and it made five.  Instead of nuts I added about 1/2 c of blueberries; kept everything else as written.  Very moist and delicious!

Was very good whole family loved it. But should be called banana-cranberry-zucchini bread because the cranberries added sooo much good flavor to the bread.

This was absolutely delicious, although the amount of white sugar was omitted from the ingredient list, even though it was referred to in the instructions.  I put in 1/4 cup of white sugar, omitted the nuts and upped the dried cranberries to one cup.  Yummy!

Five stars for taste, but 4 for directions. I baked mine 65 minutes, and there was still a raw spot in the upper middle. I maintain accurately calibrated temperature, so the oven's not at fault here. No way is the baking time 50 minutes. The banana flavor is quite subtle, which I believe is the point. If you're looking for something with a more assertive banana taste, you'd be better served choosing an actual banana bread recipe. This is more of a spicy zucchini bread with just a hint of banana. It's this taste complexity that makes this recipe successful. I'd make this again, but I'll make a note to add at least 20 minutes more to the time specified in the recipe the next time. Most of it was baked through, and where that's the case, it tastes phenomenal and is delightfully moist.

Based on the other reviews I used 4 very ripe bananas & 2.5 cups zucchini, I also cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup. Didn't put in nuts because of allergy. Baked this in a bunt pan & it took 55 minutes at 325. Made a sour cream chocolate frosting and everything was perfect. Would definitely make this again.

LOVE! I did add an extra banana based on other reviews that this was dry. Must have made a difference because they were incredibly moist. I made as muffins and baked for 25 minutes. Didn't add cranberries as personal preference and I sprinkled coarse sugar over the tops before baking. So good!

This receipe is awesome.  I used 3/4 cup of white sugar & it's still plenty sweet.  I also used 3 bananas instead of 2 since I love the flavor.  I did add a little more zucchini than it called for & it still came out great.  I've now made this bread many times.  It's a keeper for sure.  Thank U!!!!!

Made this exactly as the recipe states and it was delicious!  I made half in a loaf pan and the rest in muffin pans - all came out great.  My new favorite to use up zucchini and bananas.

I had a zucchini and some bananas needing used TODAY so I came and found this recipe.  I always try to make recipes as written the first time so that I know what to tweak to make it better.  Aside from making 24 muffins, I basically followed this recipe exactly. My few minors changes were: I used an entire medium zucchini which measured just under 2 cups.  I substituted the oil for 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and took other reviewers advice and cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup. Oddly, I was a little shy on the cinnamon so I added a generous pinch of nutmeg.  These came out fab! My 7 year old gobbled them up!  Next time, I think I would add more cranberries and nuts and also combine the dry ingredients together then add to the wet mix as I feel I overworked the flour a bit while measuring and adding the other dry things. Thanks for a yummy and healthy fall recipe!

Okay...so I needed to use up some bananas and zucchini...and when I saw this recipe, I was so pleasantly surprised to see cranberries in the recipe too, because I had some fresh cranberries in the freezer from last thanksgiving that I needed to use. I made the recipe with only slight modifications. I doubled it. I used four cups of zucchini (because I doubled the recipe and because I had so much) and I switched the brown sugar amount with the white sugar amount and visa versa, and I also used half butter half oil for the oil amount. I used fresh frozen cranberries instead of craisins...and the bread turned out to die for!  I will be making this recipe again and again and again.  So moist!  Great mixture of sweet and tart...so yummy!

This was just the recipe I needed today!! Had some zucchini to use up and this was the perfect thing for them.  I did cut back the white sugar to 1/2 cup, substituted apple sauce instead of the oil, and used 2 cups of zucchini like others said!! (I didn't have any cranberries or walnuts but will try them for sure, next time) It is SO most and delicious! My picky son loved it!! Anything to get him to eat his veggies. You will have to try this recipe. My house smells amazing too!

I added an additional cup of zucchini (didn't add the cranberries simply because I didn't have any)...made it into a 9x13 cake AND 12 muffins. I iced the cake with cream cheese frosting & sprinkled with walnuts. Sprinkled cinnamon sugar atop the muffins. They are delishhh!

I omitted the cranberries and nuts. I also added a dash of nutmeg, allspice and ground cloves and used 3 bananas and 1 cup of zucchini (that was all I could get from my 2 small zucchinis).  I never thought of doing a zucchini and banana bread Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the idea

MMMMMM!  So delicious! I did make some changes, though...
Instead of 3.5 c of flour, I used 1 c flour + 1.5 c quick cooking oats + 1.5 c whole wheat flour.  I added a mashed banana and used two cups grated zucchini.  Like other reviewers suggested, I cut down the sugar.  I used only brown sugar and 1 cup of it.  I ran out of cinnamon after barely a teaspoon but added at little bit of nutmeg (about 1/4 tsp.) and 1/2 vanilla extract. Next time I try this, can't wait to have it with all of the cinnamon :)

I had five bananas ready to turn, and my neighbor gave me six zucchini--came here to find out what to do with those things and found this recipe in two seconds.  It sounded just perfect to help me use up my stuff!  I made a double recipe incorporating some of the suggestions from reviews--doubled amount of zucchini (squeezed after shredding), cut sugar in half, used all five bananas.  I pureed the bananas in my food processor since I already had it out to shred the zucchini.  I toasted the walnuts since we like the flavor better that way.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half ground flax.  I did have cranberries and used those.  I made the batter into "just tops" muffins, which baked up perfectly in 15 minutes.  They are just the right texture, moist and delicious. I froze half of the baked muffins and we've already eaten half of the remainder!  This one goes straight into my recipe box.  Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed this wonderful bakery quality recipe.
The only change I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts because of what I had on hand.
Did have to leave bread in oven an extra 10 minutes, and I think it's because I live in a higher elevation which will account for that,  but no biggie...all ovens are different so just check your loafs for doneness.  They should have an equal  color of a golden brown crust and most will be able to smell the most fantastic aroma when they are close to being done.  Lastly, the combination of zucchini, very ripe bananas, cranberries and pecans was totally amazing and this is what makes this bread so great.  Try not to deviate from ingredients otherwise it won't be the same.
Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous recipe for all of us to enjoy.

I've made this recipe so many times by now I've lost count. Its really good and the combination of the zucchini, banana, cranberries, and walnuts is wonderful. I prefer to cook it at 340 degrees for an hour. I think cooking it at 325 degrees for 50 minutes runs the risk of under cooking it.

Made this for extended family.  Instead of making two loaves, I used a 13x9 pan.  This was a big hit-- everyone loved it.

Delicious bread.  Great way to use up zucchini as well as bananas going bad.  I cut this down to one loaf and then used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  At first, I wondered about the addition of the cranberries, but they add a nice chewy tang to the bread, and I am so glad I didn't omit them.  Bread turned out moist and full of flavor!  Thanks!

This was excellent!  Very moist and the flavors were delightful.  I did follow others reviews and increased the zucchini to 2 cups & did cut the sugar (white) in half.  I gave this away as thank you's for helping me after a recent surgery and this recipe was a definite hit and will make again.

This recipe is great!  It is not too sweet when you use the less amount of sugar as others have suggested. Also using unsweetened applesauce instead of oil makes it not as heavy and healthier. I am trying to make some ahead to put in the freezer for later use but my kids eat it before I can get it to the freezer. Thanks Heather for a great recipe! I will continue to use this one!

I made this recipe "almost" as shown. I used olive oil instead of veggie oil and pecans instead of walnuts. This bread was delicious! Excellent! Easy to make and tasted wonderful! The handful of crancberries and nuts added a nice touch.

This bread was excellent!  I made a couple of changes.  First, as suggested by another review, I doubled the zucchini & omitted about half of the white sugar.  Next, I simply sprinkled the walnuts on top instead of mixting them into the batter.  Great density & texture!

Just made recipe this morning and they are moist and delicious. I made this recipe as muffins. It made 2 dozen. I also changed up the recipe just a tad. I used 2/3 c. oil, 2/3 c each of regular sugar and packed light brown sugar. Added 2 cups of shredded zucchini & 3 mashed bananas. I also added 2 tbsp. of room temp. butter in the batter before adding dry ingrdients.Last was the nuts (I used finely chopped Pecan) and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips ( I did not used the cranberries, not too big on cranberries). My mother, who is a baker, tried these and loved them! She couldn't believe I got the recipe on the Internet...

Very, very good. I, like others, made a few changes. I used 2+ C. of shredded zucchini (it was probably closer to 2 1/2 C.) I used 3 very large and very brown bananas (browner=tastier). I subbed 1 1/4 C. apple sauce for the oil. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 C. I did not use nuts, but used the dried cranberries. It came out SO SO good and moist.  Those of you who have dry bread: You are probably over-mixing the batter. Once you add the dry ingredients, you only want to mix enough so that it's moist. Do NOT over mix, or it'll be dry. Also, you need to use very ripe bananas. The browner, the moister, and the sweeter, better for baking. Lastly, I highly suggest using apple sauce in place of the oil, it's moister this way. Use 1 + 1/4 C. of unsweetened apple sauce instead.   It took a while longer to bake this way, about 1 hour, 10 minutes, but keep checking it, and don't fill the bread pans to the top if you don't want it to take as long to bake.

I only made half a batch but I still used 3 bananas (I didn't have any zucchini on hand) so to kind of compensate, I chopped a Fuji apple into pretty small cubes and threw that in.  Yes, it didn't taste like banana/zucchini bread anymore, but it tasted almost like a great apple pie in bread form somehow!  It was great!

There was too much sugar in this recipe... I read the previous reviews and only used the brown sugar and no white sugar and there was still too much.  I would still use less.

I didn't have craisins, so I added some raisins instead, and threw in some extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg just for flavor.  Substituted applesauce for the oil and added in some extra to increase the liquid content, and also added about 2 tbsp of flaxseed as suggested in a previous comment.

To make the flour component healthier, I used the spice grinder (cleaned out first) to grind up the appropriate amount of old-fashioned rolled oats into whole grain oat flour.  It only took a few minutes, and didn't give the cake/bread the odd taste that whole wheat flour can give it.

I added an extra cup of zucchini. I only used 1/4 cup of oil, and subbed the rest with fruit puree. (left over fruit put in a fruit processor) I only used 2/3 cup white sugar. I didn't have cranberries or walnuts  so I threw in some coconut. I actually cooked it in a large "brownie" pan (4 qt dish) vs. bread pans.  I would make again! (but without coconut!) Very moist bread and not too sweet.

Love recipes that you can make even healthier and they still taste good. Used 2c ww flour and 1.5c ap, 1/2c applesauce and 1/4 oil, 1/2c sugar, maybe 1/2c br sugar?.. added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 2 heaping tbsp ground flax seed. Made into muffins, baked for around 25 min.. good stuff, kids are happy! (left out cranberries and nut, didn't have any)

I guess it's strange to rate this 5 stars when I made so many changes- but it was delicious! I used 4 very ripe bananas, about a 1/2 cup more zucchini, a small handful of freshly ground flax, I added applesauce to make it 1/2 veg oil & 1/2 applesauce... I added about a tablespoon of lecithin for extra nutrition and about 2 Tablespoons of dutch cocoa. Oh, and I omitted 1/2 of the white sugar, because I decided to make a quick butter/sugar/crumb topping before baking. I made them into muffins instead, since I have 6, 4 & 2 year olds & figured they'd rather have "their OWN" muffin than just a slice of bread. I was right! They are SO good and there is no sign of them "tasting" healthy. The kids inhaled them, and 2 of my kids are extremely picky eaters. UPDATE 9/10/09: I just made another batch of muffins. This time I used 5 bananas & almost 2 cups zucchini... they came out perfectly at 20 min, sooo moist & delicious!

Even though I made a few changes I still think this recipe is delicious.  1 cup white sugar is too much for me.  I used 1 cup packed dark brown sugar. Used 2 cups grated zucchini instead of the 1 cup.  3 bananas, mashed instead of the 2. Used 1/2 teaspoon salt instead of 1 teaspoon.  I was not planning the last change but I had no other choice.  I did not have enough all-purpose flour.  So I used 2 cups unbleached flour and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour.  Let me tell you the results were fabulous.  My family loved this bread.  I am planning to prepare this recipe again, this time  with the 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour.  THANKS SOOOO MUCH********

This ended up being a great way to get my one and a half year old to eat veggies!  I halved the recipe, but used the same amount of zucchini, only used one egg and substituted applesauce for the oil, but used the full 3/4 cup.  It fit perfectly into two mini loaf pans.  I'll probably cut more sugar out next time too, because it was still a little sweeter than I would like.

I thought these were awesome the way I made them, here is what I did: most of the flour was whole wheat, cut the white sugar back to 1/2 cup BUT used Splenda baking blend and the brown sugar was also Splenda brown sugar for baking, I totally cut the oil out and used 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce. I doubled the nuts amount. I omitted the cranberries and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. It made 24 muffins. I made sure to use papers in the tins because they stuck really bad to the papers, my fault. 
I accomplished my mission, which was a breakfast muffin that was sorta diabetic friendly. 
I also doubled the zuuchini, too

I changed the recipe before trying after reading the reviews, and loved it.  That is why I gave it only 4 stars.  I added 2 more bananas and 1 more cup of zucchini.  I also had to bake it another 15 minutes.  I had my oven on 350.  I live at 4000 feet so  I often have to change my cooking time.

Fantastic! I halved the recipe to make one loaf, mashed up a pear that desperately needed to be used in place of the oil, used a whole zucchini and added raisins instead of cranberries and nuts. Super easy!

This was really good, though I tweaked it alot! I used applesauce in place of oil, added flaxseed meal, pinch of nutmeg, pinch of ginger, grated rind of 1 large orange, 1/3 cup melted orange juice concentrate ( because I ate the orange ). Next time I will add coconut.( I added coconut to banana bread before the garden was producing and it was yummy.)I used mostly unbleached flour and part whole wheat flour. Because last weeks heat ripened the bananas too fast I doubled the recipe and made two loaves and a ton of muffins. My elderly neighbors and my parents were happy!

Very good recipe.  Even my picky husband likes it.  I subbed in 1c of whole wheat flour to try to make the recipe a little healthier and reduced the white sugar to 1/2c and it was still plenty sweet.  I went with muffins instead of loaves and made half of them with no cranberries or nuts for Mr. Picky.  I ended up forgetting the cinnamon, but it was still great without it.

Love this recipe, but I modified it slightly based on what I had available: I halved the white sugar, substituted the oil with apple sauce, and used almonds and raisins instead of cranberries and walnuts.  Delicious!

OMGosh!  This is soooo good!  I followed the instructions almost completely but adapted because I had frozen zucchini that was chopped not grated.  
I thawed the zucchini and used the liquid that produced and cut the oil to 1/2 cup.  
Will be making it again for sure!

I made some with the dried craisins and some with choc. chips (with the banana and zuc.). I added one banana and another cup zuc. as well as a couple extra T. of oil, but I stil felt the bread came out dry. If I try this again, I may reduce the bake time. All-in-all a good idea with the ingredient mixture for a fun flavor!

Wow! I unfortunately didn't have cranberries or walnuts on hand, but I used this recipe to make muffins and they are soooo good! I made a few changes, used 1 cup of light brown sugar and no white sugar, used 3 bananas and more zucchini. I wish I had apple sauce at home instead of the oil to make things a bit healthier, but these muffins are delish! Thanks for the great base recipe! Oh also, I made large muffins, and cooked them at 350 for about 35 mins.

It had a very bland taste.  I cooked it for 50 minutes and it seemed uncooked in the middle.  My oven runs hot, though it would be done since they were mini-loaves.

i totally tweaked this: i did the applesauce (in place of oil) - 1 cup, didn't have zucchini so i used 1 cup shredded  carrots, also added one finely chopped apple, instead of 1 tbsp of cinnamon i substituted w/pumpkin pie spice (someone suggested a Pampered Chef spice that is exactly what pumpkin pie spice is for less $$. also dumped in 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, gotta have chocolate! and my family loved it.

I did change things slightly: doubled zucchini, 1/2 oil & 1/2 applesauce instead of oil, halved with granulated sugar.  Added pecans & no craisins.  I also added Nutmeg, but it could use some more of the nutmeg, ginger, and/or cloves for a spicier fall flavor.  Pretty good!

Loved this recipe! We grew a ton of zucchini in our garden this summer and I didn't know what to do with them. Everyone was hesitant to try my bread because who combines zucchini and bananas?? But the feedback was always two thumbs up! I omitted the cranberries and walnuts, and substituted mini chocolate chips instead. YUM!

I have used the original and the various members revisions of this recipe in the tips section. Have used it with just zucchini.  Also I usually increase vanilla in most recipes. It is a delicious bread, moist and flavorful.  The dried cranberries and walnuts are a must. It is now my basic base recipe for zucchini bread. I recommend it highly.

This recipe can be halved with excellent results.  My entire family really enjoyed it--moist and delicious and healthy!  It is exceptionally good with whipped cream cheese!  Also freezes well! I substituted currants for the cranberries and pecans for the walnuts, just because it's what I had on-hand.  Thanks for sharing this one!

Very moist, did have to add about 1/4 of milk because I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup wheatgerm, 1/4 cup of soy flour and 1 1/2 cup of white flour, used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil and cut white sugar to 1/2 cup, no cranberries or nuts.

I totally didn't expect to be this good!  I made some changes also.  Used yellow squash and increased to 2 cups, 3 bananas, reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup, subbed one cup of flour for whole wheat, and reduced oil to 2/3 cup, pecans instead of walnuts.  Also did one large loaf and 6 large muffins, adjusted baking time accordingly.  Thanks for a great way to use up even yellow squash!

This is a very flavorful quick bread. I made some changes: I reduced the white sugar to 2/3 cup; increased grated zucchini to 2 cups (and squeezed all the liquid from the zucchini before mixing it into the batter); and replaced dried cranberries with 3/4 c. mini chocolate chips. Next time I will try using melted butter instead of oil, since I like the flavor of butter better. I made one large loaf and two small loaves, and removed the small loaves from the oven after 45 minutes.  The large loaf stayed in the 325 degree oven for 1 hour & 15 minutes and was done perfectly. I will make this again, especially because we have lots of fresh zukes from our veggie garden!

Definitely increase the amount of zucchini in the recipe, I'm glad I did.  I used raisins instead of cranberries and macadamias instead of walnuts (using what I had on hand).  Took about 15 extra minutes in the oven than directed in recipe before toothpick tested done.  Might make again after tweaking recipe a bit.

Some changes I made: half whole wheat flour, plus a little wheat germ for nutrients; increased brown sugar to one full cup, then ommited white sugar completely; increased zucchini by half a cup; and  made into muffins, baking for 20 minutes. Definitely good enough to make again as written in the recipe, or with changes like these.

I made this with 1/3 c. sugar, 2 c. zucchini and 4 overripe bananas.  It is delicious!  The cranberries and walnuts add a lot, as does the cinnamon.

Just an "ok" recipe. I think the amount of banana needs increased for sure, a lot of banana breads have as many as 6 so 2 doesn't lend nearly as much moisture, and you end up with a much airy and drier than typical banana bread. Also, three cups of flour is enough. I only used 1 cup of sugar in this, but the sweetness was still ok for me. It was not bad toasted with some homemade jam, so we ate it anyway! But wouldn't make it again.

Made these into muffins for my kids for breakfast. I substituted cinnamon applesauce for the oil, increased the zucchini and banana, substituted honey for the white sugar (left the brown sugar as is) and left out the craisins and nuts. The results were delicious and a little healthier!

This is a great bread. I used 2 cups zucchini like others said. I am glad because I think it added extra moisture. Also I used chopped fresh cranberries instead of dried cranberries.  Next time I may increase cranberries to 3/4 cup

best banana bread/zucchini bread yet! I cut down the sugar like others advised and found I wish I hadn't cut the white sugar down so much.did the extra zucchini} Great if not big on sweet desserts but I found it needed just a touch more than they recommended. If I want "diet bread" I would take away the oils and sugars and replace but not skipping on flavors. I had Crisco Natural Blend Oil. Other than that and tweaking the sugar and cinnamon spice.I'm leaving this recipe alone. Baked at 335 for 40 minutes{springs back when touched but not firm/hard on top} Turned out moist, fluffy and can taste the bananas which is more than I can say for many other banana or zucchini bread recipes:)been making this in double batches today to store in freezer for my church or hubbys' pot lucks at work{wrap up nice in cling wrap then foil and store in freezer storage bags or freezer proof containers}. Just take out and thaw wrapped up on counter overnight and it's ready to go!can cut down on the white sugar but not too much..I mixed a touch of pumpkin pie spice{1/2 teaspoon} in with the cinnamon which I did cut down to about 1/2 tablespoon for the first couple batches as some people like less spice, then added touch more cinnamon for those who like it into my last 2 loaves. Great recipe ya'll!oil& line pans with parchment paper and pull out after cooling only few minutes and set back on rack cool rest way. Great recipe, thank you for sharing it! I am so blessed by your recipe!it's a KEEPER!

This was a very good quick bread.  Moist but not mushy, flavorful, crunchy yet tender.  I followed the recipe as written.  For me the two loaves took about 65 minutes (much to my anxious impatient boys' chagrin).  But 325 is the right heat, 350 would've dried it out and overcooked the edges before the middle was done.

I normally don't review items, but wanted to give some feedback :)
I rated this recipe a 4, since in this day and age using less fatty items is a must, and adding that much sugar and oil is never necessary.
So here is my rendition:

Used a 9x9 square pan
2 Large eggs
8 oz. (1 cup) unsweetened applesauce (instead of oil)
1/2 cup sugar (used white but would have used brown if I had it!)
1/2-1 cup zucchini (was wet so hard to tell, but the moisture helped a lot here!)
2 bananas (used an additional half later)
2 cups self-rising flour (didn't have regular flour, so used this and skipped the BS, BP. and salt)
2 tsps Cinnamon 
--- forgot the vanilla but not a necessary component in my opinion

then added some blueberries, choc chip, almonds and cashews... enough to your liking :)
After adding to the pan, I added some chunks of banana and a few more blueberries and choc chip to the top and pushed them down a bit.

Baked in a toaster oven for 30 min @ 375 (on convection), then seemed it needed a few more minutes so turned the pan and then 5 min @ 325.

Overall, really great to the point that I wanted to leave this comment and suggestions for future bakers!  Oh and I am no baker so hence why I just try different things out all the time... but this recipe I am keeping for future since it was yummy.

One last tip, I have used sweetened applesauce and skipped sugar entirely or just used a tablespoon for other things and worked out well.
hope this was helpful.

This was very good and very easy to make.Baked up very nicely, with a moist delicious flavor. Maybe 1 more banana would make it a 5 star. My preteen son loved it, as did his teacher.

I never eat banana bread without butter - until now.  I did modify the recipe a bit.  I put in 3 bananas, used a generous cup of zucchini, left out the cranberries & nuts and replaced about 2/3 of the oil with cinnamon apple sauce.  Wonderful flavor and moistness.

My whole family loved this recipe. I did not have cranberries so I added some cinnamon chips instead and I sprinkled a tablespoon of sugar and a small amount of cinnamon on the top of each loaf before baking. Was absolutely delicious! This is definitely a keeper!

On recommendations of other reviewers I cut sugar down to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar.  I also added a cup of zucchini (mainly because I had a 5 pound zucchini!).  It was very moist and yummy.  I will definitely continue to use the modified recipe.

I made this and did what some suggested added another banana cut back on the sugar.  My husband said it was the best.  I didn't add the nuts because my husband can't have them and I didn't have the cranberries however I still gave it 5 because I think those 2 ingredients would have just added to the great flavor.     Thanks for sharing.

This was very good. I added chocolate chips instead of cranberries. It was a little too sweet as others have mentioned. It could have been the chocolate chips or my very ripe banana. Next time I will reduce the sugar.  I had to cook it for 60 minutes.

One thing I would recommend is more spice.  I put extra cinnamon but it still wasn't enough and it could definitely use more flavor.  Maybe my changes affected the outcome.  I substituted yellow summer squash for zucchini and used 3 cups of shredded squash.  I used only 1/2 cup of olive oil (for baking) and although I usually cut the sugar down, I used all of it (figuring my son wouldn't like it unless it was sweetened up a bit).  I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 cup of white flour, and 1/2 cup of flax meal.  I also put cherry Craisins.  In the end, we didn't love this bread.  I thought it was a weird combo of zucchini, banana, and cranberry and it turns out it was.  I'll toast it up tomorrow for breakfast and see if we like it better then.  If I hadn't had both bananas and summer squash on hand, I probably would have stuck with my usual carrot or pumpkin muffins.

I read the reviews and took the suggestions to use half the white sugar and added an extra banana and more zucchini. I also used less cranberries and nuts.  I made mine into muffins.  (I got 18.) It took about 30 min. They came out light, moist and delicious! Keeping this on my list!

Absolutely yummy! My kids even liked it, and went back for seconds! The only things I did differently was added 2/3 cup white sugar, didn't use cranberries, and didn't use walnuts (my kids don;t care for them). In addition, I used four mashed dark browned skin bananas. The bread had tons of flavor. It's a keeper!!

Good moist bread but it was lacking something. I made the following changes and maybe that's why. I used 1 c. applesauce in place of the oil; 1/2 c. white sugar instead of 1 cup; and 2 cups zucchini. Everything else stayed the same. Also my family didn't care for the dried cranberries in the bread.

This is by far one of the better breads I've made that tasted absolutely delicious even after I made some healthy changes.  I substituted natural applesauce for the oil and use subbed out half the white flour for wheat. I used 2 whole eggs and 2 whites for the 3 eggs.  Usually when I make changes like that, the end product lacks in flavor but not on this one!  Wow! Thanks for the great recipe:)

I really liked this recipe!! But instead of putting cranberries and chopped walnuts, I substituted with chocolate chips. Everyone loved it!!!  I didn't have to worry about certain people not liking fruit in their bread and others not liking nuts.

Awesome!  Will definitely make again.  Changes as suggested by others: 1/2 cup oil and then a 1/4 cup applesauce 1/3 cup regular sugar and 1/3 cup Splenda 3 Bananas Added a sprinkle of ginger, nutmeg, allspice & ground cloves Any nuts will work - had chopped Macadamia on hand. Baked one large loaf in my 9 X 5 stoneware loaf pan and used mini muffin pan for the remaining batter.   Cooked the loaf for about an hour and the minis for 15 minutes.

I am not a fan of banana bread but my husband and kids love it. I had 16 cups of shredded zucchini and needed something else to do with it after making 5 doz oatlmeal cookies and about 10 loaves of straight Zucchini Bread so this was a great option and  it was well recieved. I actually made these into muffins which shortened the cooking time.

I accidentally forgot the oil!  So it is low fat, and actually still good.  It is still warm from the oven, so it is moist and delicious.  It may dry out sooner than it would with oil, but for the moment it is very good.  I did use freshly ground whole wheat flour instead of the white, and I omitted the cranberries and nuts.  It was a good and healthy way to use up my ripe bananas and the monster zucchini a friend gave me!

I made this as the recipe was except I added more zucchini.   I didn't find that the body or flavour was as good as other banana or zucchini breads.  Perhaps it was the combination of the two.  I will stick to my old faithfuls

These were so yummy! I used whole wheat flour and no white sugar. I also used almost 3 cups of yellow zucchini and did not squeeze it. I added a touch of milk to mine,the batter looked a bit thick. I used a muffin tin with liners. I will make this again. Delicious!

I made this following the recipe exactly as it was the first time.  Will definitely make again, but I think I will add more zucchini as it was a little dry.  Great flavour, though, and thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love this recipe. Like so many others I used just whole wheat flour. I used about 1 3/4 cup zuchinni and I substituted 1 cup Splenda for the white sugar. It turned out moist and great. My husband who hates artificial sweetners never knew it had splenda in it. He ate a piece for lunch every day until gone. It freezes well too as I freeze one loaf for later since it is just the two of us.

A wonderful recipe.  I altered two things; first I added 3 ripe bananas and second, I used whole wheat flour and it still came out super moist and delicious.  The kids give it 5 stars as well!

As suggested, I added more zucchini and bananas. I also have really big loaf pans (there are only 2 of us in the house), so I make them in muffin pans and bake for a shorter amount of time. They are really moist and they go in no time!

Woah good Zucchini Banana bread.  I made a few adjustments - increased the zucchini to 2 cups, used 3 bananas, used 1 1/3 cup packed brown sugar and no white sugar, and I used butter instead of oil.  I also didn't have cranberries so I used raisins, and put in some chocolate chips.  Yumm!!  It came out moist and a little dense, but I think that is my fault and I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the nuts and adding slightly more cranberries.  It was WAY too sweet.  Also the bread was a little dry but that could be because I did mini loaves and possibly baked a little too long.  I may try it again with less sugar.

This recipe is great, except the bread turned out dry. I would recommend using at least a full cup of vegetable oil and/or another cup of grated zucchini.

This is really a great recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my family thought it was missing a little something. I make the receipe twice in row using other people's suggestions... added an extra banana, zucchini and pumpkin pie spice. It was really good, I'd have it again but I would still find something else to add.

I have never made any sort of bread be it banana or zuccini.  However I searched for a recipe because everyone seems to be giving us zuccini and we had a surplus of bananas.  IT WAS SO GOOD AND EASY!  My husband said it reminded him of being a boy sitting at his grandma's kitchen table - a very nice compliment as she is a great cook!  I have since made this several times now as we still are getting lots of zuccini although I suspect that the givers of the zuccini just really like the bread in return!  Thanks so much for giving me the confidence to try MORE baking - this bread was awesome and easy!

great mix of flavors, the cranberries gave it that extra "something" without being overpowering.  My husband does not normally like cranberries so I didnt' even tell him that's what they were... I think he assumed it was raisins, but said he loved the bread!

Yummy!  Great way to use up those ripe bananas and zucchini!  I added an extra cup of zucchini (I squoze out the water in a paper town so it really turned out to be about a cup and a half).  And I threw in an extra banana, just because I had it. I made 4 small loaves and 6 muffins.  The muffins cooked for 35 min. and the loaves for 45 min.  Definitely do not cut back on the sugar!!! It needed all of it--perhaps because I added the extra zucchini and banana (?).  Oh, I also made a crumb topping:  1TB butter cut w/ 1/3 c. brown sugar, 1 TB cinnamon, and 2 TB flour.  Definitely a keeper!  (Oh, I left out the cranberries and nuts because my family doesn't like them!)

I followed the recipe, except I omitted the cranberries and walnuts because I didn't have them on hand and I made muffins.  I also added a few Tbsp of milled flax seed.  We loved them, even my husband who doesn't like zucchini.  Next time I will add the walnuts and maybe the cranberries too.  I cooked the muffins 25 mins for regular size, and 15 mins for mini.  It made 24 regular and 12 mini.

Loved this recipe. Made one loaf and the rest were muffins. The muffins got gobbled up by my two picky kids. I used mostly whole wheat flour and oat flour. I subbed choc. chips for the dried fruit and topped with chopped pecans.

Agree with other posters who said it's a little dry. Still a good recipe, though. I will probably substitute plain yogurt for some of the oil next time, to make it healthierâ€”I think that will also help increase the moistness.

Really great recipe base. Like others, I tweaked the recipe for what I had on hand and for health...first I substituted egg whites for the whole eggs, I used on 8 oz container of low fat vanilla yogurt for the oil, reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, increased zucchini to 2 cups (and squeezed liquid out), and increased vanilla to 1 tablespoon.  Oh, I also didn't put in the cranberries, cause I didn't have any.  I know this is alot of changes and therefore may not even be considered the same recipe, but without the direction of this recipe, I wouldn't have know where to start with my bread!  So I give it 5 stars for being a consistantly great bread recipe despite alterations. Thanks!

My kids love this bread.  I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  I did as many others; 1/4 c. oil & 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce, I also added 1/4 c. ground Flax, 1/4 t. Allspice, & 1/4 t. nutmeg.  Great Bread....Thank-you for adding it :)

I've made this bread so many times in the past couple months.  It is so delicious! I only use 1/4c. veg./canola oil and 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce.  This makes it pretty tasty and healthy. Updated review 6/8/09-add 1/2 c. dried cherries in place of dried cranberries. This is even better.

Hellooo banana-zuke! This bread is fantastic.  Flavorful! Dense! Delicious! 

I added maybe a half teaspoon of extra salt, an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and about 1/4-1/3 less flour and sugar than suggested.  The result was out-of-this-world!

Incredible recipe!  I too altered the recipe just a little bit because we are trying to watch our weight. I saw read the other reviews and changed oil to 1 cup to applesauce, sugar to 1/2 cup, and zucchini to 2 cups.  I did not have any cranberries so I didn't add those but I can't wait to try this recipe again to add them.  I think it would be a really cool bread for Christmas.  Complements to the chief!  Thanks for your original recipe and the comments shared. You are all making me a better cook.

Very good recipe! I added another banana (just because I had nothing else to do with a black banana!), but I thought that it came out perfect. Great way to spice up zucchini or banana bread. The cranberries added just the right touch. I made 24 med. muffins, instead of loaves. (325 degrees, for 25 mintues). 
Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good basic sweet bread.  It definitely didn't taste like zucchini to me (and I used about 1.5 cups zucchini) and it only had a hint of banana taste, so it just had an all-around bread taste which was good but a little plain.  We all liked it fine, although if you're wanting zucchini bread taste this isn't the recipe for you.  I made it as directed except I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of 3/4 cups oil and it turned out fine.  One warning on the loaf pans - when I split the batter between two pans, it only filled up about halfway.  So I ended up filling on almost the whole way and then making 6 additional muffins.  Everything eventually turned out fine, but I had to bake the loaf about 1 hour and 20 minutes because it was so thick, and by then the outside was brown and crunchy.  So I would say to stick with the instructions and don't fill the loaf pans so full for more even baking.

This was wonderful.  I used only the banana and zucchini and not the other fruits,and it was moist and delicious.  Plus, the whole house smelled great while it was baking.  I used my bundt pan and baked it altogether in that pan, and it turned out beautifully.  The two friends I shared it with, asked for the recipe.

I had a lot of old bananas and tons of zucchini to use up, so I doubled it for freezing.  I lowered the sugar, doubled the zucchini, and left out the crasins and nuts (for picky kids).  It needs chocolate chips, and then I think we'd be set.

This was great! The bananas gave the perfect taste and texture to regular old zucchini bread. I used 2 cups of zucchini as others suggested and also substituted chocolate chips for cranberries. It made a huge batch. I was able to make 24 muffins and one loaf. It was all gone in days. YUM!

I made this recipe without the cranberries or nuts, and I used 1/2 c. honey instead of sugar.  It turned out to be delicious!  It has a wonderful texture, and I liked the fact that while I used up zucchini, I could partially sweeten it with bananas so I didn't have to use too much honey.  I made two triple batches of it! Yum

this was the BEST bread I ever made.  I increased the size to 40, made it in a long pan, used 1/2 melted butter and 1/2 oil and used 8 ripe bananas and eliminated the brown sugar.   I also eliminated the nuts and put in about 1 cup of dried sugared cranberries.

These were good - my 4 yr old really loves them  - we added a lot of craisins to this and skipped the nuts, also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used half applesauce and half oil - will make again but may add back in the full cup of sugar

My family really does not like Zucchini, but loves Banana Bread. So this was a wonderful way to hide the Zucchini, they just loved the flavor. I did make some of the changes suggested by others (applesauce and more zucchini). Worked out great, I think this is a wonderful base recipe that I will definitly bake again and "experiment" with.

This was moist and yummy! I made a few changes which worked out just fine. I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, reduced the white sugar to 2/3 cup, increased the zucchini to 2 cups and used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of the cranberries and nuts. It was quickly devoured!

Great bread, with a few changes.  I substitute yogurt or applesauce for the oil, used coconut instead of cranberries, add more banana to replace some of the sugar, and spice it up a bit more.  For the flour I have used quinoa, millet, oat bran and multigrain or just wheat instead of white flour to give more nutrition to this bread.  Very moist and flavorful even with changes.

This was soo good! I'll be making this again! The only thing that I did different was I used Planter Trail Mix with M & M's, dried cranberried, rasins and mixed nuts-I used 1 cup. It was really moist and very good. I took it to a family reunion and there wasn't a slice left!

Very good!
I made some modifications:
I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (for health, plus added great flavor).
I used 3 bananas and 2 cups zucchini.
As per recommendations, cut back white sugar to 1/2 cup.
I subbed in 1 cup of whole wheat flour.
Added 1 cup of chocolate chips.

I made this recipe twice, the second time I made with almond flour and as muffins, love love it. 
Both time I made vegan. 
Just take the eggs out and the banana works as egg replacements.

If I made this as written, I'd give it 4 stars but since I'm trying to make healthy snacks for my kids I tweaked it as follows:
used 2.5 cups oat flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil plus 1/4 cup oil, only had 1 zucchini, 4 bananas (overripe), 1.25 cups walnuts, 1/4 cup cranberries
- made a loaf and 20 cupcakes
- cupcakes baked at 140Â°C for 20 mins and loaf for 65 mins. Cupcakes needed a few more mins to bake but turned out great! 
-next time try adding 3 bananas and 2 zucchinis

Still in the oven, but recipe very easy to follow! I did add an extra banana as well as a bit more zucchini as well as decreased the white sugar - 1 C. simply too much! Can't wait to try it as my house smells sweetly with this baking in the oven!

I adjusted the amount of bananas and zucchini as I had more the two bananas.  Also added one little box of raisins, plain yogurt, and sour cream.  I sprinkled light brown sugar at bottom of (bundt) pan.  Turned out very moist and delicious.

Excellent recipe. I made three variations of it, and a few alterations (increased the zucchini to 1/ 1/2 cups), but the basic recipe is exactly what I wanted. 

First, did the recipe and spices as called for. 
Second variation, used raisins instead of cranberries, halved the cinnamon, and added in 1/2 TBSP of cloves. 
Third variation, halved the cinnamon, added in 1 TBSP of cocoa, and used a mixture of chocolate chips and caramel chips instead of the cranberries. 

Will definitely be using this recipe quite often to get rid of overgrown zucchini.

Yummers! 
I needed a recipe for Banana Zucchini  Bread as the
store-bought banana bread always has way too much sugar.
I halved the posted recipe and made the following changes:
3 ripe bananas,
1 whole grated zucchini,
1 ounce of white sugar but still used 1/3 cup brown sugar and
omitted the cranberries as I didn't have any on hand.
It was still a little raw after 50 minutes so I put it back in for an additional 10 minutes.
So delicious!

I am really happy with the way  this bread turned out! Its texture and flavor are perfect!  However, I did make the following changes:
1) I substituted 1/2 cup orange blossom honey for the cup of white sugar
2)  1/4 cup grapeseed oil and 1/4 ciphered Lighter Bake in place of 1cup oil 
3) used 4 eggs
4)I used 4 ripe bananas and 31/2 cups shredded zucchini and 2 cups frozen cranberries 
5) 2 tsps Vanilla extract ,1tsp coconut extract/ 1 tsp lemon extract
6) 2tsp cinnamon 1tsp pumkin pie spice

I used only white sugar as I didn't have the brown one, so probably no more than 1 1/2 cups of sugar,  I found the mixture a little bit dry so I added a little container of unsweetened apple sauce.  I used 2 cup of all purpose fluor and the rest was garbanzo-fava flour so it gets more protein.  I grated a full zuchini which was almost 2 cups and probably more banana.  It turned great !! ... and less calories

Very good. I also decreased the white sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the zucchini to 2 cups as others suggested, and now it is not at all overly sweet. It is very good and easy to put together. I'll definitely make it again.

This turned out amazing!  I did modify it, 1/2 C white sugar, 2 cups of zucchini as others mentioned.  I also used 1/2 cup of granola in place of the nuts due to a nut allergy and it turned out great!

I loved the combination of flavors in this bread! I would have given it 5 stars except that I think it needs to be reworked a little.  I had some trouble with the bake time, as stated in several other reviews. I made one loaf  and 6 large muffins. The muffins were perfect but the loaf still had raw spots even with 20 extra minutes (I had to foil top to keep bread from burning).

This was a great recipe. I added an additional banana and an additional cup of zucchini which I partially squeezed the water out of.  I used 1 cup coconut flour, one cup rolled oats, an 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour.  I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans in their place. I did not use the white sugar and I substituted applesauce for the oil. This made 27 muffins that I baked 22 minutes on the first batch and 25 for the next batch.  Even though the toothpick came out clean on the first batch, they needed to cook a little longer.  Taste is flavorful and healthy.  Look forward to making again!

Great recipe but I did make alterations for my families dietary needs. Used 2 1/2 C gluten free flour +1C oat flour, 3 mashed bananas and 2 C shredded zucchini as others suggested. Decreased oil slightly to 2/3 C. Added frozen blueberries. Not sure how much due to baking in large muffin pans and just submersing 7-8 berries on top of batter.  Baked perfectly at 20 min. Very yummy!

I modified this by using 2 cups of shredded zucchini and 3 small bananas. I baked for 40 minutes an fused Texas size muffin pan. a little on the dry side. I think I need to add more oil with this modification. Otherwise this has good flavor!

This is a good recipe but I had a lot of zucchini to use! I used 2 cups of zucchini, added 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa, used 3 bananas and took out the cranberries. I baked for 60 minutes and it came out tasty and beautiful! I made 8 loaves today, the neighbors are thrilled!

Great recipe! I did make some changes though: used chia seed as egg substitute, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and I didn't have cranberries so I used raisins. It turned out soft, fluffy, and moist.

This bread is a favorite in our home. My sons love it. Especially the one who hates veggies. I actually use 4 bananas and a whole zucchini  to make it a little tastier and moist. I puree the zucchini and bananas in a food processor.

Tasted great.  Made a few changes.  I used 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt and 1/4 of coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil.  I added 1/2 cup of blueberries and only used 1 banana.  Came out delicious.

Great recipe, I realized I didn't have enough all-purpose flour after I started, so I used  1 cup white, 2 cups whole wheat and a 1/2 cup of almond flour.  It came out with a great texture and incredibly delicious.  Can't wait to freeze a loaf and have an excuse to eat this again.

I kept the ingredients almost the same, minus cranberries or nuts as I didn't have any on hand. I dramatically changed the directions and believe it made a big improvement over some of the concerns expressed in other reviews. 

1. I used one very ripe banana previously frozen and one fresh banana, sliced about 1/2", then quartered. Combined that with a heavily packed one cup grated zucchini, and 1/4 cup of homemade Madagascar vanilla rum. Set aside. 

2. Separated eggs and whipped the whites with some cream of tartar to stiff peaks, and set aside. 

3. Added all dry ingredients into a bowl, whisked together, and set aside. 

4. For oil I used butter and creamed this first with the white sugar, then added the brown sugar until frothy. Added in egg yolks and whipped until fully combined. I then gradually added the dry ingredients until the mixture became a crumble (mind you I am using the whisk attachment and kitchen aide mixer) 

5. Gently fold egg whites into zucchini/banana/rum mix, then gently folded in crumble 1/3 at a time. 

It came out very light and moist, but held together perfectly for serving. The flavors were delicate, but present. 

If I were to do it again, I would add some nutmeg and allspice, sprayed the top with simple sugar, and cooked it for 1:15 @ 300FÂ°. 

I will absolutely use what is here as a guide again.

Nice recipe. I reduced the white sugar to 2/3 cup and doubled the shredded zucchini; it still turned out really sweet. Next time I will try 1/2 cup each brown and white sugars. I also substituted 1 c. whole wheat flour for all-purpose flour and used a snack size cup of applesauce to replace some of the oil. I baked 12 muffins and one 8x8 pan (to expedite the cooking time). Overall, I enjoyed the end result!

The only thing I did different was add 3 bananas instead of 2 and i had to let it cook an additional 20 minutes because i used one loaf pan, delicious!  Let my fiancÃ© and Co workers taste it before me and they loved it.  Already asking when the next loaf is coming.  Will definitely make this again really soon.

I have made this many times. The first time was exact to the recipe given. I felt it needed more so I read the reviews and I have come to these conclusions. Add 1 or even 2 more bananas. Increase the amount of zucchini by a half cup.  I also have doubled the amount of raisins and nuts. This bread is so easy you really can't go wrong but these changes are what makes it over the top good. You will be suprised at how forgiving the recipe is.  Just make it to your taste!

I made this bread this morning. I did make some changes tho. I cut the sugar in half (1/2 cup white , 1/3 cup brown sugar) I also made it gluten free by using Krusteaz Gluten free flour blend. (I used 2 2/3 Cups) and added 1 tsp. xanthan gum. I didn't add the cranberries either because I didn't have any.  It was delicious!! very moist and flavorful!

I should have read the reviews first, but I also added more zucchini, less sugar, and subbed applesauce for some of the oil. I think it turned out great, except it felt like there was a ton of flour. It ended up being somewhat dry. I'd probably cut back on this next time.

Will definitely make again! Only change will be to increase quantity of fruit and nuts from 1/2 cup each to 1 cup each. Texture of this bread is incredible! Sooooo good as is, but also a real treat to toast! Oh, the aroma! I think I need to go have some more right now just talking about it! :)

I thought the flavor combo of this was great. I did add about an extra Â¾ c of zucchini, only because I didnâ€™t want to save it. I think the sugar amount is perfect. I sprinkled some chopped pecans on top so people would know there were nuts in it. Mine took at least 60 minutes to bake.  Iâ€™ll probably try this again some time.

I thought that this was a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.  although I did add a handful more of zucchini and it still tastes more like banana bread.  In stead of adding all the oil I did half oil and half apple sauce.  And I will definitely make it again.

Very delicious way to use up zucchini and banana (used more of both of these than the recipe called for). Would definitely make this again over another similar recipe I tried on this website for the same.

Added 1 cup cinnamon chips to the batter + 1/2 cup plain applesauce & decreased the oil down to 1/4 cup.  It was a delightful surprise how delicious this bread tastes. I never considered zucchini & bananas together in a bread. Plus the cinnamon chips, & dried cranberries  combined for a unique taste. Fantastic! ! This will be,a new family fave. Yum! I'll have another slice,please.??

I followed the recipe exactly except for the cranberries. I only had a cranberry and sliced almond salad topper on hand, so I used that  instead. I don't know if the addition of sliced almonds is to blame, but it turned out a bit dry and crumbly for my taste. It's still good and my toddler is begging for more, but I will definitely add more banana and less sugar next time.

I made these as muffins, baked for 18 min. I put in 1 c. total sugar (mostly brown) and added a banana. I added pecans instead of walnut and omitted cranberry. Delicious and a hit with the kids!

Yummy! I also used only 1/2 c white sugar, I added in 2 cups shredded zucchini, and 2.5 large mashed bananas. I replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce. They baked up as muffins in about 25-27 minutes. This recipe made 24 regular muffins. Everyone loved them!!!

Like many other reviewers I also doubled the zucchini, added another banana, halved the sugar. Plus I used coconut  oil and butter melted together instead of vegetable oil. This took a bit longer to bake in my own oven (75 minutes) than some others have noted, and perhaps all the extra (very wet) zucchini had something to do with that. But the results were DEEELICIOUS! Thanks for the recipe!

I was searching for a recipe with these exact ingredients.  I have made it several times now.  The only change I made was the last time I used my convection setting on my oven & I doubled the recipe.  I baked it at 305 for 38 minutes.  I could have reduced the time more so in the future I will start checking to see if it is done after 30 minutes until I get the time exact.  It was delicious every time.  That is not only my opinion but that of everyone I have given it to.  And I drizzled on a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 T melted butter, 1/4 t vanilla, 1/4 t almond extract & 1 t hot water at a time until it reaches the consistence you like.  Thanks for the perfect quick bread recipe.

Ok, not sure if I should rate this as I made this Gluten-Free! I made this recipe using half gluten-free flour and half coconut flour, also the oil was coconut oil.... but YUM!!! and moist!! My daughter and husband loved it too!!!!...and they didn't know it was gluten-free until after they ranted and raved about it!

Amazing. I halved the white sugar & doubled the banana & zucchini. I made 24 muffins instead of 2 loaves. They were dense but so tasty.

Great way to use up zuchinni.  I added extra nuts and brown sugar to sprinkle on top before baking, but it didn't need it.

Excellent recipe! I made banana zucchini chocolate chip bread instead since I was making it for my daughter to take to camp and had to omit the nuts, (cranberries alone just aren't the same). The only other change I made is I substituted the veggie oil for coconut oil. It gives the perfect flavour! I found the banana and zucchini ratio to be perfect.

I read the reviews and did some (a lot) of the changes. I substituted applesauce for the oil, cut the white sugar in half, added one more cup zucchini and one more banana. I left out the  cranberries and walnuts as I didn't have any on hand.   It was fabulous. definitely a keeper. I took it to work and everyone gobbled it up.

I replaced the sugar and a bit of oil with concentrated apple juice syrup (I simmered some frozen apple juice until it thickened, which is also really nice replacement for maple syrup on pancakes) because I've always found banana and zucchini breads to be missing some... sharpness. The apple syrup made it feel much more balanced to me.
Definitely keeping this recipe to make again.

Made into 24 muffins, my 3 year old grandson, ate 2 1/2 for breakfast.  I used 3/4 cup honey instead of sugar, 2 cups of zuchini. I did not add nuts or cranberries.  Great recipe.

We loved this recipe!  The cranberries were such a fun addition!  I did modify it... Used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce, added extra zucchini (probably about 3 cups total!), cut the sugar down to 1 cup total (2/3 cup brown, 1/3 cup white), used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of white flour, and I also didn't add the nuts.  Even with all of my changes, the recipe was perfect!  It's a very forgiving recipe.  I'll be making this anytime we have zucchini to use up!

I didn't have any dried cranberries or walnuts,  so I substituted 1/2 cup each of mini chocolate chips and sunflower kernels.   I also didn't have the pan size listed,  so I made 2 mini loaves and 1 large loaf.  My daughter and I just tried it and declared it "yummy"!

I made a few changes based on other reviewer's suggestions and it turned out great! I used 3 bananas and 2 cups of zucchini. I cut the white sugar in half and I used a cup of cinnamon applesauce instead of the oil. I didn't add cranberries or nuts because I don't like either of those. It was a great way to use up my zucchini and bananas before they went bad. I'm sure I'll be making it again soon!

Since my bananas were fairly small, the banana flavor was very subtle, but that was fine with me. I increased the zucchini to 2 cups as many reviewers recommended, and that was a good call. For the oil, I used applesauce and added oil to equal the 3/4 cup. Like I usually do with breads, I cut back on the sugar and added 2 tblsp of ground flax seed. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and cloves.

Very good :)  I added cream cheese icing on mine, made 24 mini muffins and 12 large muffins.  I substituted 1/4 c. butter to 1/4 oil.  I also dropped the sugar by 1/2 cup. I'll be making these again for sure :)

This was the best cranberry banana walnut bread I have ever made! I made this for my husband and he ate one loaf in one day!! I must say I only used I cup of brown sugar and omit the white sugar and used canola oil instead if vegetable oil.

I just made it, and forgot to put in any white sugar. I do not miss it, but I don't like things very sweet. I doubled the zucchini and walnuts. I used 3 small bananas.
If you don't put in the cranberries, you will like it just as well. They are a very prominent flavor that some might thing overpowers the flavor.
My only negative is the loaves could have been higher. It is too much batter for one loaf, but not quite enough for 2.

Great base recipe. It has a good texture and I really liked the cranberries. My minor substitutions: replaced about half the oil with applesauce, about 1 cup of all-purpose with spelt flour, increased zucchini.  Thanks!

I made this bread today and it was very good! I also added chocolate chips, substituted almond extract for vanilla because that's what I had on hand. I made it in a 9x13 pan for more of a snack cake. I made a topping for it too. My husband and I really liked it!

So glad to find this recipe to use up my brown bananas and extra zucchini.  I made it without cranberries or nuts, but otherwise just as stated and think it's fantastic.  Maybe next time I'll tweak it, it could stand to be a bit more moist, but we liked it a lot!

Altered recipe after reading some reviews. In my version instead of the vegetable oil I added 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup coconut oil.  I didn't use a full cup of white sugar, probably about 2/3 cup or so.  I used 3 bananas (I was trying to use up browning ones) and I probably had about 1.5 cup of zucchini (trying to use more since I have a lot to get rid of).  I didn't use cranberries or nuts of any kind (because I didn't have them).  I baked mine in a Pampered Chef Stoneware Mini Loaf Pan, it was the perfect amount for all 4 loaves.  I checked the bread at 30 minutes just to be safe and ended up going about another 20 minutes - just check it periodically!

I made several changes due to the fact that I didn't have a grater, and I didn't have vegetable oil.  (and I didn't have any nuts on hand so I left them out)  I pureed the zucchini (1 c.) and I used 1/2 c. of olive oil.  Wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it's pretty good!  Next time I would use about 1 1/2 c. of zucchini to get the full taste in there....but not too shabby!

Just made these and they are delish.  I followed the recipe in every way other than adding another 2 bananas (all four bananas were small), and instead of cranberries I used chocolate chips.  Moist and wonderful.  Will use this recipe again!
For Nordic Ware users:  This recipe filled the Backyard Bugs pan and one of the Mini Bundt (makes 6) pans, with some to spare.  I ended up filling them too high just to use all the batter--should have only filled half way up, and maybe used three pans not two.

Liked this recipe BUT, the second time around I reduced the amount of flour to 1 1/2 cup of flour (that amount of flour made my first attempt ok but not moist enough; second time around I only had enriched flour handy, so I used it) I grated a whole big zucchini that became two cups of it. Definitely reduced the sugar to either one, I only had white sugar so used 1 cup of it. and no nuts in my cakes.... then I cooked for about 15 minutes longer than recommended... and voila, a very exquisite moist cake that I had to hide in the freezer to stop eating it... delicious... next time I will try apple sauce or some kind of juice to replace the oil. Never thought of that.... thank you for the tip to Acurlytops.

Wonderful exactly as written!  The second time I made them I didn't have bananas or cranberries so I substituted 1 cup shredded carrots, 1 diced apple and 2 tablespoons of orange marmalade.  Again, wonderful!

Thank you for the recipe!  Tried it and it came out amazing!  However I doubled the bananas and zuccinis and only used a bit less of a cup of brown sugar, no white sugar at all.  Came out sweet enough and very tender! thanks:)

This is a good recipe. I read the reviews and did use less white sugar, added 8 oz of cream cheese (to avoid dryness), and 1/2 cup each chocolate chips and raisins. I baked them for about 55 minutes or more in two double wall gold bread pans from Williams Sonoma.

YUM! Like others suggested, I decreased white sugar to 1/2 cup. I made muffins and they baked perfectly in 20 minutes. Had a little extra batter, so it made one full muffin sheet, plus 3 extra (probably could have just filled the cups a little more!)

Delicious!  Made 18 muffins and 24 mini muffins out of this recipe, baked the minis for 15 minutes and the regular sized muffins for 25 minutes.  A fantastic recipe!

Loved it and only used 1/2 cup of white sugar... When I was half way into it realized there was no baking powder and subbed in 1 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice. Moist and yummy.... Will make this again...soon!

Moist and delicious with the added touch of cranberries. One recipe made 1 loaf and 24 mini muffins. I halved the white sugar and increased the zucchini to 2 cups.

Easy and tasty!  I made some adjustments to fit what I had on-hand -   summer squash instead of zucchini.  1 cup dried cranberries, no nuts.  I used 2 1/2 very small bananas and a little more would have been OK, 1 cup wheat germ subbed for 1 cup of the flour.  Delicious!

I make banana bread almost every week.  This was a great recipe to change things up a bit!  I did make some adjustments based on other reviews/personal tastes. However, the base recipe is great and it turned out very moist and yummy!

AWESOME recipe!  I'm always altering recipes to be more healthy with less than perfect results.  This one is it!!  I substituted applesauce for the oil, used half the amount of sugar and a blend of white/wheat flour with no sacrifice of taste!  Thanks so much!

I thought this bread was just ok but nothing too special.It's a little on the dry side for me and I even underbaked it just a bit after reading sveral reviews that it was dry. I also used 2 cups of zucchini and 3 small bananas thinking that would help too.I think next time instead of cranberries I would add an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple.That might help with the moistness and give it a little more flavor.

my kids loved this one and didn't notice there was zucchini in it! I left out the nuts and added a some chocolate chips which also may have helped. I agree that if I make it again I will definately try it with less sugar.

Although my coworkers really liked this, I found it drier than I would prefer. This was even after adding 1/2 cup applesauce (decreased oil bu 1/3 cup). I did sub in 1.5 cups of whole wheat pastry flour (2 cups all purpose) - so that may have been the dryness culprit. Also used 3 bananas and would increase this to 4 next time. Not bad, but not as awesome as the top rated zucchini bread recipe on this site.

This was excellent. I chose this recipe since I had 2 overripe bananas to make use of, but was out of cranberries and nuts (had to settle for just raisins). Made quite a few changes: used only brown sugar (1 2/3 cups total), and used applesauce instead of oil (equal amount) and distilled vinegar for eggs (1 egg = 1 tbsp). Absolutely fabulous results!

This is a GREAT recipe, the first batch was gone that day, the second time I made it I was smart enough to put one loaf in the freezer, but even after being in the freezer for a few months the bread was still so moist and tasted delicious.

Kinda dry. I added extra banana and extra zucchini, so I was expecting it to be super moist. Not so much. Good flavor, though next time I would use fresh cranberries.

This is an awesome recipe!  This is the first banana bread I've made & I have to admit I was a bit sloppy with the measurements - it came out delish!  I didn't have any walnuts but I had some pecans that was a really good subsitute.  I think I'll try more shredded zucchini.  Also my bread didn't look as pretty as the picture - I think you have to set aside some of the cranberries and nuts to sprinkle to get that jubilee mix on top.

I brought this to work and everyone said it was good.  Due to allergies I didn't put in the walnuts.  I also didn't put in the cranberries.  I think it could have used a little more spice like nutmeg.
