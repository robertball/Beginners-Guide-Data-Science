This is a great recipe, but I do have to agree that it comes out a little chewy. I made one batch of chocolate caramel corn and then made a second batch of just caramel and almonds. I mixed the two together and it turned out great. I also cooked the popcorn for about 50 minutes and it seemed to make my second batch a little crunchier...I'm sure it helped that it only had one coating instead of two. Also, had trouble with the popcorn sticking to the waxed paper. I used cooking spray on the second batch and it was better.
**Just made one more batch (easy Christmas gifts!) and used aluminum foil with a little cooking spray to let the popcorn cool. No sticking...yeah! So ditch the waxed paper and save yourself alot of time.

The flavor was really good, but make sure you bake it long enough.  It was my first time making any kind of caramel corn and it was soft instead of crunchy.  I'll know better next time!

This is great.  We added toasted almonds and it was fabulous.  Only problem was that the corn severely stuck to the wax paper.  I want to make this again, but have no idea what to do so that it won't stick or be greasy from cooking spray.

I boiled the sugar to hard ball (using a candy thermometer) and it was still really sticky.  I also think there needs to be more popcorn...there was almost too much goo and not enough crunch.

This is great! we had relatives over for a game of D&D and the adults as well as the kids could not keep their hands out of the bowl! I agree with th eearlier statement"don't taste this without the chocolate, you will want to eat it all."  I cheated and used microwave popcorn! it worked great.

This makes some good popcorn!!  My 2 year old was eating it with both hands when it was out on the counter cooling!  Just don't taste it before you get the chocolate on there or you will end up with just carmel corn, 'cuz it tastes pretty good, that way, too!!

There is soosooo much goo that I was actually eating clumps of caramel and chocolate.  It stuck together after cooling so I had to break it apart into clusters.  It was very good, but something has to be changed.
