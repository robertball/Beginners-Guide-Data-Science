Pretty darn good. I didn't have any nectar so I used a capful of brandy instead and aslo supstituted the cardamom for cinnamon. The marscapone part of the dessert was the best!

This recipe was wonderful.  I quartered the apricots and put them around a serving tray, then put a dollop of the whipped cream mixture on each.  The cream went together a little but made it look pretty.  The apricot sauce was perfect.  Many friends requested this recipe.  I will make this again.

This is quick, tasty, and just a little elegant.  Great finger food (one bite depending on the size of your apricots) for a buffet table.  You want to have everything well-chilled and fill the apricots just before serving.  Once it's at room temperature, the filling starts to soften and run pretty quickly, and that's not a pretty sight.
