Please keep in mind that the recipe calls for one chile, not one can of chiles. It is very important to remember if you want to keep your mouth intact and your head from exploding.

I made these for Christmas and New Years, and it turned out to be a hit! I used mandarian oranges instead of pineapples because my father's allergic. The chipotle chile in adobo sauce is very spicy. I only used half the can in a doubled recipe. If they sit over night they will be more spicy....

Delicious! I had to use up some meatball mix so I used fresh meatballs.  I also only used half adobo and half Sweet baby Rays bbq sauce since I cant handle spicy very well.  So good.  Added to the list of favorites!

I've served these at least four times over the holiday season.  They are easy, healthy and REALLY good.  They have been a hit with everyone.  I haven't tried using a stronger cheese (Gorgonzola/Blue Cheese) yet but will the next time I prepare them.  They are TERRIFIC

I made this recipe exactly as the ingredients called for as well as the exact cooking times.  Be cautioned - these are extremely spicy!  Generally I like hot and spicy foods - I tend to order "very hot" when it comes to wings as well as enjoying tons of cajun and creole foods.  But these were so spicy I couldn't eat more than five without giving up.  If I make this recipe again it will be definitely without the peppers.

This sauce has a wonderful and unique flavor.  I expected it to be more "holiday" tasting because of the cranberry sauce, but it's definitely a year-round dish.  (Not that cranberry sauce isn't wonderful any time of year.)  I used homemade meatballs I had frozen, two chipotles and two tsp. of the adobo sauce.  I also neglected to drain the pineapple.  It is -very- spicy.  My boyfriend, who generally isn't a spicy food kind of guy, has declared it his new favorite dish.  Oddly enough, I think I'd prefer it as written--one chili--next time.  Having read the reviews, it seemed as though some people were mistakenly adding the whole can, so I thought two peppers wouldn't be pushing it.  It is.  Wonderful flavor all around, though, despite my error in judgment!  Also, I served it over plain white rice, making it a main dish instead of an appetizer.  I suspect the pineapple juice contributed, as it definitely gave the dish a liberal amount of "sauce."  It worked out really well.  Definitely a keeper.

Yummy! I love chipotle, so I couldn't wait to try these. However, I did make a few changes due since I didn't have all the ingrediants.  I used two 32 oz. bags of swedish meatballs, a large can of chipotle, 1 can of jellied, 1 can had whole cranberries in it, and a small scoop of brown sugar.  Unfortunately I didn't have any pineapple so I didn't use it.  I also didn't have alot of time, so I microwaved the meatballs for a couple minutes and dumped everything into the crock pot.  I tasted it before I added the sugar and thought it was a little sweet.  I can't wait to try it with homemade meatballs!  The sauce ingrediantes might be a nice glaze on a turkey or chicken. Thanks Jshot21!

This appetizer is delicious! The meatballs and pineapple melt in your mouth. If you are setting this out for more than 6 people double the batch. It is spicy so not something you want to serve to young children.

Excellent! I followed the recipe and the only change was not draining the pineapple pieces and  I made my own meatballs. I used about 1 tbsp. of adobe pepper and the sauce was a tasty combination of sweet and spicy. As it was cooking in a saucepan on the stove, I kept sampling the sauce-it was addictive. My husband couldn't wait to eat. We loved it on rice. I will be making this for my dinner party this weekend. Thank-you for a great recipe.

I made it for a party and everyone loves it. I got meatballs from Sam's. If you are doing it for a potluck party, you are likely going to double the recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe. I did not drain the juice from the pineapple can. There are 2 types of pineapple chunks...one in heavy syrup and the other one in 100% juice (I used the latter). I doubled the recipe and only used 3 chilies and some of its sauce. It gave a hint of heat but not too overpowering. Will do it again for sure. Thank you for such a great recipe.

Love spicy sweet, great hit at party. For those saying it is way to spicy, the recipe calls for one chopped chipotle pepper, not the whole can! I used one plus added a little extra sauce. Perfect.

I will say that I think most of the reviewers read the recipe as 1 can of chipotle chili peppers.  I think it reads 1 canned chipotle chili pepper.  quite a difference.

I used the whole can of chipotle peppers, and it had the right amount of heat. I also doubled the recipe, as we were serving more than 2.  They were devoured, and the sauce left over was  spread on fresh bread!! Great recipe,  will make again!

I've made this several times. I use an entire can of the adobo chilis and sauce. I love spicy food though. This has become my go to potluck dish and is usually a hit.

I followed a couple of recommendations and everyone loved these!  I left the juice on the pineapple and used 1 chipotle pepper and 2 T. adobo sauce.  They are super-easy to make and I will definitely make them again.  However, I'm thinking I may just use pineapple juice (because no one eats the pineapple) and add 2-3 peppers next time to add more zing.

How funny.  I didn't realize that the recipe called for one chile instead of a whole can until I read the reviews.  I used the whole can and everyone liked them.  They are definitely spicy but we love spicy food so it worked for us.  Whole cranberry sauce works great as well.

This was good, though I would add a second chile next time. One chile didn't have enough spice for my taste. Too sweet.

This recipe was great, however I did find it a tiny bit bland. I suggest adding more of the chipotle sauce the peppers come in, as the recipe only calls for one pepper (not one can).

I made this recipe for a Christmas gathering.  I was a little concerned with how much to use of the chili peppers in adobe sauce.  I ended up using 1-2 peppers minced finely and a bunch of the juice from the can in a double batch. They were a huge hit!  Everyone raved about them and this was a typically quite picky crowd!  Definitely worth a try!

Very tasty but very spicy if recipe is followed. Only 1 can of Chipotle chili's would be enough. Huge hit at parties.

This is great!!  I was glad to have a "tweaked" version of meatballs other than the usual BBQ or cranberry sauce meatballs.  When I make it again, I will use less brown sugar and a whole can of the chipotles.  It was a little too sweet for my liking, and could have used more kick.  Great Recipe!!
