My 87-year-old grandmother swears the secret to a successful pie is using King Syrup not Bryer Rabbit Molasses or any other Dark molasses which makes a huge difference in the taste.  Changes to the ingredients:  She uses Crisco in lieu of the butter (a total of 2T. per pie) and more brown sugar 1/4 c. more than this recipe states.  She also reserves more topping so it doesn't sink/absorb into the pie (1 cup).  To prevent a runny pie, she bakes it for 5 mins. at 400 then 25 mins. at 350. I hope this helps the runny/taste questions.  Definitely a PA Dutch keeper.

This recipe came out too runny.  This was my first attempt at shoofly pie.  It was very easy to make, but it's possible I did something wrong.  The edges came out pretty good, so maybe it just needed to bake longer.

This was a nice gooey version of shoofly pie--"gooey" in a good way. Perhaps the person who didn't like it used blackstrap molasses? It has a nice, rich molasses flavor, but not overpowering, with the mild molasses I used.

I'm sorry but this was disgusting.  The pie tasted like molasses out of a bottle!!! Please, save your time, ingredients and money by not making this recipe
