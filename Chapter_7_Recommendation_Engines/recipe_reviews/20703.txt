This recipe is actually a very good breakfast casserole, but there are some key details missing.  First you must use french bread in this recipe.  You need all the crust to soak up the eggs and milk.  I simply rip the loaf into bite size pieces with my hands, much easier than cubing it.  Secondly, toss the bread, 1.5 cups ham cubes and 2-3 cups shredded cheese with 2-3 Tablespoons of flour before putting it all in the baking dish, it keeps the egg bake from being soggy.  Then, blend the eggs/milk in the blender with the other ingredients (I add 3 Tablespoons margerine and 1 tsp. dry mustard) and pour over the bread mixture.  Cover and let it sit overnight in the fridge allowing the bread time to absorb the liquid.  It will look almost too dry the next morning, but it's supposed to.  I bake it at 350 for about an hour, uncovering it at about forty minutes.  I do not put it in a water bath.  Enjoy!

FOR THE PEOPLE WHO THINK THIS RECIPE IS BLAND, ARN'T ADDING ENOUGH EXTRA'S LIKE A CAN OF ASPARAGUS, OR SOME GREEN, AND RED PEPPERS, OR A LITTLE EXTRA HOT SAUCE, THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND IF YOU DON'T WANT IT TO MOIST, JUST BAKE IT WITH OUT THE PAN OF WATER....

This dish is FANTASTIC! I made it for my future in-laws, and they loved it! (Whew!) I noted that other people were less than thrilled with the texture, so I didn't use a water pan at all, I just made the whole dish the night before, took the foil off in the morning and put it in the oven without the water pan, and 1 hour later it was absolutely perfect. I will make this again and again! Thanks for a keeper!

Great recipe with some modifications.  The first time I made this recipe I used the 2 cups of milk and did not like the mushy/soggy texture.  Next time I made it I decreased the milk to one cup, used a little less cheese, and used a full loaf of bread and it came out great.  I also did not use the water pan to bake it.

Great easy recipe to prepare the night before and bake in the morning. The bread gets nice and crisp on top, I actually used english muffins instead and that turned out great. Cooking for 2 people I almost always have leftovers, but with this I recommend not making more than you can eat, no good reheated.

I always shake my head when someone rates something 5 stars and then makes over the whole recipe!  I make something very similar to this and it is my family's FAVORITE.  I use regular bread and I do layer it - both "details" that I would leave the same as the recipe.  Sometimes we substitute crispy bacon for ham.  Oh - and we leave the bread in whole slices (minus the crust) and butter it.  I suppose that is why we don't have to use the water pan.  Another thing we add is some crushed Special K or corn flakes to the top just before baking with some melted butter sprinkled on top to prevent them from drying out.  Adds some crisp.  BUT...this omelet is GREAT just as it is written.  We call ours the Christmas Morning Lifesaver!  Great for company and if we need two, we do one ham and one bacon.

I've had a couple of brunch parties and this was a hit!  I omit the ham though and substitute red pepper for a vegetarian version.  Also, I find that 1 1/2lb cheese is WAY too much.  I only use a 1/2 pound and it's plenty.  Enjoy!

So easy and good! Per other reviews, I added half chopped red and half green bell peppers.  I also added a couple drops of hot sauce, but it was still very mild. Might try a few more drops next time.  Since, I rarely buy white bread, I had to use what was on hand...wheat.  The wheat bread gave it a slightly more grainy flavor/texture.  I will be making this again but I'm still debating if I want to stick to the wheat or try it with white bread. Either way, VERY good and goes into my "make again" recipe stack.

This was a really great recipe....I omitted the onion, because of my children, and added extra ham and cheese. I also substituted a special milk and honey white bread, and sprinkled on a little garlic bread seasoning in lieu of the onions. I baked the casserole in the sitz bath for 30 minutes, and then removed the water bath for the final 30 after covering the top with foil...it came out perfect!!The milk and honey bread added a sweetness that worked well with the ham/egg/cheese mixture. My husband raved, and it was so nice to have a casserole they would all eat!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Fantastic breakfast recipe! Couldn't be better. But of course, if I am to be a genuine AllRecipe reviewer, I must suggest changes to a perfect recipe. Didn't have white bread, too lazy to go to the store, so I used crumbled up stale crackers. No cheddar cheese, so I scraped the mold off something I found under the sink. I thought I had ham, but I was wrong. Used tuna fish instead. The milk I had was outdated (is July 2008 too old?) so I collected the beer left in the bottles lying around from last weekend's party. I thought I had salt, but it seems it got mixed up with the sugar. Oh well. Can't make much difference. Hot pepper sauce I have, and lots of it. Used the whole bottle to make up for not having other ingredients. The onion I had wasn't green, so I put some dye on it. All in all, a great dish, although I was too sick to eat it. The dog seemed to enjoy it at the time, although I haven't seen him in a week since he ate it.

Hmm, I really debated whether to give this 4 or 5 stars. It's actually pretty good but I think with a few tweaks it really does become a five star recipe.
First, I strongly suggest you go with a heartier bread than just plain, doughy white bread. A nice honey wheat bread works great and gives better texture and taste. Also, to cut down on some calories and cholesterol, use 4 whole eggs and 4-6 egg whites. You will still get a very rich egg taste, but in a much healthier way. And last, this dish screams for some freshly ground pepper in the egg. Just whisk it in and pour over as directed. I love this made vegetarian style by leaving out the ham and adding sauted mushrooms, green peppers and onions. Switch up the cheese as well to make it different each time. Like it zesty? Add some pepperjack. Like it a bit more mellow? Try some shredded baby swiss. It's a very versatile recipe and super delicious with some simple changes.

I can't believe there's only one rating for this recipe! I absolutely love it! We have had this for several occasions and have created many variations. I've been asked for the recipe several times! Here are some ideas - red peppers are great in it. Meat lovers - with sausage, ham and bacon. We almost always put sweet onions in it no matter what combination we make. Adobo is the perfect spice option. Franks hot sauce is great in it. Even stale bread can be used and one time we made it in a cast iron skillet on the stove top - it was wonderful, just be sure to heat evenly, medium to low heat with a tight lid, but towards the end of cooking, prop the lid to let air in.

For those that had a texture issue, I bet it wasn't baked long enough. Make sure the entire top of the omelet is puffed.  If the center has a depression, it is not cooked all the way. The time difference may have to do with the temperature of your oven or if you used small eggs.  I make this frequently and I never use a water bath.
If you are looking for a little more flavor add 1T worchestshire sauce and 2 T dijon mustard to the egg mixture..and vary the cheese Go crazy with the extras use whatever meat or veggies you like but keep the total amount to no more than two cups or the whole thing falls apart when you serve it.

The flavor wasn't bad, but getting past the texture was rough for both my husband and me, and not one of four kids would have anything to do with it.

We had breakfast for dinner last night using this recipe, along with crispy bacon and a toasted English muffin.  I made half of this recipe in an 8x8” square pan, which produced an omelet a little flatter than I would have liked, but that’s an easy fix for the next time.  I cut way back on the amount of cheese, using a handful per layer, about one cup total.  I used hamburger buns for the bread and I added some sautéed green and red bell peppers.  Rather than putting the green onions in with the egg mixture, I just sprinkled them over each layer.  My half recipe took 40 minutes to bake.  Very good!  I wouldn’t hesitate to make this again!

Very good, even without the meat.  A couple of comments:  instead of 1 1/2 POUNDS of cheese, I think 1 1/2 CUPS is more accurate.  Second point - this works well if you make it the night before and cook it in the morning.  Also - check it before one hour, since mine was done at 45 minutes.

I've been making this same recipe (almost) for >35 years.  My family loves it for Christmas breakfast!   A couple of differences in mine: (13"x9" dish) I take off the crusts and just use the bread squares (wheat is great!); 2 cups of ham 2 cups of grated cheese over the bread and another layer of breakd.  THEN 6 beaten eggs with 3 cups milk, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp. dry mustard.  Pour over the layers.  The milk will absorb!  Refrigerate over night (it works as well to bake immediately, though.)  Before baking, add 2 cups crushed corn flakes, crackers or bread crumbs, then pour over 1/2 cup melted margarine.  DO use a cookie sheet under the baking dish though, it may boil over in your oven.  This recipe halves perfectly to fit in a 9" square baking dish for a smaller size.  AND it is great for dinner with biscuits, applesauce or fruit!  We call it "Christmas Brunch Souffle"!!

Honestly, the only reason I gave this recipe a try was b/c I needed to get rid of a loaf of bread I knew we wouldn't eat after the New Year. So, I gave it a whirl & it was quite delicious. I could see this being an easily modified recipe with other ingredients too!

I have made this twice for a group brunch and there are never leftovers.  I did add a little of the seasonings the other reviews recommend.  Also, I let sit in the fridge overnight before baking in the am.

The flavor was good but I could not get over the texture. It was a little too mushy for us. I definetely cooked it long enough because it was almost a little too brown on top. I tried to put it back in the oven without the water but that did not help with the soft, fluffy, mushy texture. If you don't mind a mushy egg meal then you will enjoy this because the flavor is really good.

Great Recipe!  We increased the size to serve 100 -- and it was the main course for our church "Advent Brunch" --easy to prepare - especially in such a large quantity -- looked great when served too!

I made this for 12 hungry police officers.  I added chopped bell peppers and used french bread.  I made 2 trays, one with ham and one with sausage.  Everyone loved it and they hit the road happy and full!  Not one scrap was left in the pans, everyone went back for seconds.  This was very easy to prepare and I loved that I could prepare it the night before. Great recipe.

This is delicious and so easy. I made it the night before and it baked up perfectly. I read one review that said there was too much milk but all I did to fix that was to pat the whole thing down untill moisture coukd be seen at the top. This way I was sure all the bread would be moistened while it sat overnight.  I also substituted. green pepper for the green onion. Perfect for a breakfast buffet.

For my tastes, I'd add some bacon (it amps up the flavor along with the ham), tobasco or pepper jack cheese and mushrooms to make it perfect!

Very good, but I think the ingredient list is supposed to say 1 1/2 CUPS of cheese... not POUNDS.

My family really liked this casserole. I used potato bread on the bottom, wheat bread in the middle, added asparagus, used half as much cheese, added an extra egg and didn't cook in a water bath. I didn't cube the bread, just put 4 slices in the bottom and 4 in the middle. It was a little moist, but it didn't bother anyone. Maybe I'll use a little less milk next time.

We enjoyed this, but I think it could use a little less cheese and a little more ham (or sausage).  Also, I used sourdough bread, which worked great as well.

EXCELLENT!!! Great recipe, so easy.  If you're looking for a great breakfast casserole recipe, this is it.  The green onion is the secret ingredient here.  My family doesn't like green onions in anything but we dutifully followed the recipe and WOW!  The flavor the green onions provided really made this casserole.  Worth trying.  Hint: use half and half or heavy cream for the milk to "up" the flavor and you may want to add extra milk/cream to the corners just before baking if you prepare it the night before.

Watch the conversions on this if you want to cut it in half. The full recipe (12 servings) calls fo 1/2 a loaf of bread, but when you cut it in half to 6 servings it calls for more bread (1 loaf). I didn't realize this until I had poured the egg mixture into the bread mixture, and thought it seemed like I had way more bread than egg. Then I went back to check the recipe conversion and realized what had happened. I was able to add more egg and milk to compensate before putting in the oven, but I had already put in an 8x8 dish since I had intended to cut in half. So it ended up thicker than it would have been had I used a 9x13 dish. I also used leftover salmon from dinner the night before instead of ham and used homemade wheat bread instead of white bread. The flavor with the salmon, egg and cheese was great.

I made this for breakfast when some friends were over.  I used bacon instead of sausage and I didn't have near the amount of cheddar cheese to put in it.  ( I probably put 1/2 cup in, shredded very fine.)  However, it turned out wondeful none the less!  I received many complements... and we almost didn't have enough, so many people went back for seconds!  I recommend this highly...

Adjusted my serving to 14. Read other review and added more bread about 3/4 of the loaf. Used wheat bread also. Didn't have green peppers so I used 1/4 cup of onions instead. Used 1 percent fat-free milk. Turned out well and all enjoyed.

I found this to be bland. Giving it 4 stars since I admittingly changed the recipe. Instead of layering, I mixed the bread cubes, cheese & ham in a bowl then added to the pan & covered with the egg & milk mixture. I used 1 1/2 cups of cheese not lbs as another review mentioned but maybe I should have added more cheese. I think this needs something else, perhaps dry mustard. May or may not try again.

This was an incredible recipe.  I did misread the ingredients in the begining and used a whole loaf of bread instead of half - but just added and extra 4 eggs and 1 cup of milk and was ok.  Instead of layering I did mix all up so the ham was all through the casserole.  Everybody loved it!!!!

This is a good recipe if you need to make a few eggs and a little ham go a long way.  I was looking to try something different but didn't care for all the bread.  I did use a French bread which I think made it better than regular bread would be but I probably won't make this again.

I use a loaf of crusty French bread and add thinly sliced mushrooms and a cup of cooked, squeeze-dried spinach in the layers. I used 1 1/2 cups of liquid coffee mate, saves lots of calories, which I make up for by adding a couple of tbls melted butter and several scrapes of fresh nutmeg.

Outstanding!

I also did not do the water bath and it came out fine. I also added a bit more ham and cheese. I made everything up the night before but kept the dry and wet ingredients seperate until I was ready to bake it.

Was awesome! Used what I had available: Leftover dry biscuits instead of bread, evaporated milk instead of any milk, lots of cheese(unmeasured), can of vienna sausages instead of ham. I did leave it overnight in the fridge to soak.

This is a great recipe that my wife absolutely loves.  After making this a number of times, I've added a new twist.  Before adding the second layer of bread, I add a layer of freshly sliced mushrooms, green peppers and tomatoes.  I also add around half a cup of hot sauce.

I used this recipe for our monthly breakfast here in our mobile home park. I converted it to 50 and it turned out great. The people loved it.  Also, I read a review on it and  did not put it into a pan with water. I found that cleaning the pans was a real chore though, could that have been because of this? I did coat the pans with oil first. I also used chives rather than rosemary. We had leftovers and it was good this morning as well after heating in the microwave.

Ok....so I read all of the reviews and here is my version, which really was fantistic.  I doubled the amount of ham and used slightly more than half of the recommended amount of bread.  My guests were very pleased with the end result.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My son and I loved this recipe, but my finacee said he didn't like the, "texture". But I rated it to my son's and my taste. I like preparing it a day ahead, that made it evan better. I wish all recipes were like that.

Not a bad recipe, just didn't work out as well as I would have liked on its own. I took the advice of other reviewers and used only 1 cup of milk, and didn't use the pan of water. Worked out nicely. Found the ham I used made the dish a little too salty. I think with some tweaks this could be fantastic!

After reading some of the reviews I made a couple of changes to the receipe.  I used Pillsbury crescent rolls instead of the loaf white bread.  I laid out the dough in the dish and baked per instructions on the package.  After taking it out of the oven I added tsp of butter before adding the mixture.  Also, I  increased the amount of ham to 2 cups.  It was awesome!  I will use this receipe again.

We loved it with slight variations - multi-grain bread, SPAM, and no hot sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly, was a little concerned after reading the reviews about having too much cheese but that was the best part.  I did cover it lightly for the first 40 minutes and used a variety of cheddars and a bit of spicy mexican cheese.

I made this for brunch on Christmas day.  It was really good, we both really liked it.  It was much tastier than the typical scrambled eggs I make on the weekends.  I think it will be a tradition to make this each year on Christmas from now on, especially since I got engaged to my boyfriend while this dish was cooking in the oven!  Even our 1 year old ate some of it, too.

Very good recipe, very easy to make. I used whatever leftover bread we had(which was wheat and I would stick with any white bread next time). Didn't have hot sauce so I used chile garlic sauce.  I was little afraid to make it too spicy for my 5 year olds so I went easy on the spice. This was a great recipe to use up the left over spiral ham from Christmas dinner and makes a very hearty brunch option to fuel through a cold winters day.

Excellent!. I took this to a church breakfast and brought home an empty pan. Several ladies told me how pretty it looked. I made it with the ingredients as written. Mixed it up the night before then baked it covered for 40 minutes then uncovered 20 more. I didn't use the water bath but baked it in a heavy ceramic lasagna dish. I will be making this a lot.

The is a family favorite that we enjoy when we have company staying or holiday breakfast.  When I make this I let it set up overnight which is perfect b/c you can make it ahead of time!  Few additions I make: use 3/4 loaf of french bread, add 2 more eggs and 1/4 cup more milk, chopped green pepper and mushrooms make this so good!  I have a picky husband so I just do the veggies on half.

Every forth of July weekend, I bring make ahead breakfast casseroles to my daughter's inlaws summer home. This year I tried this one again.  However, I changed the cheddar cheese to swiss cheese. (I only used l lb) and instead of hot sauce I used 1/2 tsp dijon mustard.  It was excellant.

This was simply, "OK".  IF I do make this again, I'll add diced green chiles and a smoother tasting cheese blend (maybe monterey jack & colby).  Also, no salt!  I may also toy with other meats such as breakfast sausage rather than ham.  This was overrated as is in my opinion.

Easy way to feed a crowd at breakfast.  Great for holidays.  We used canned jalapeno peppers instead of the hot sauce.

Love this one!!  I made for Mother's Day brunch for my family.  Being pressed for time, this was perfect!  I just threw together the night before, then popped in the oven in the morning.  I used soy milk instead of regular. Yummy! No one even noticed the difference.  Great recipe, will use again.

it was pretty good.  i made it per instructions and enjoyed it.  it was a little bland for me, but it was still good.  i mean really, how bad could eggs, milk, bread, cheese, onions and ham in the same dish be?

i have since "re-done" it to fit my tastes and it hardly resembles this one anymore, but that's OK, 'cause this one is good.  i don't use additional salt and i changed alot of the ingredients, but the basics are still eggs, milk, bread and ham.  if i remember to write down my ingredients i'll submit it, 'cause i think it's a winner, that is if you like a more robust 'Baked Brunch Omelet'...

I made this for our Garden Club this week and everyone raved about it.  I was so confident that it would be good that I didn't even try it with our family first.    I have had alot of dishes like this with egg that just didn't seem to be done when it was suppose to be.   I think the cooking it in the pan of water really does the trick.    Great Recipe.   I didn't put the dash of pepper sauce in mine though as we have a member that can't do any kind of peppers.

A hit. I used homemade oatmeal bread, bacon instead of ham, added a little dry mustard and fresh nutmeng, and enjoyed a lovely brunch. Veyr easy and could be made a bit ahead of time, put in the frig, and cooked up before company arrives.

Made this for my hubby and 4 kids.  Anything that the kids rave about at the table and keep asking for me is a 5 star recipe.  I used an entire loaf of french bread and tore it into pieces.  I only added 1/2 of the cheese.  It was plenty.  I did up the ham to 1 1/2 cups.  If my kids weren't picky eaters I would have added tomatoes and think that would have been great.  It is a keeper.

We LOVE this dish It is also great as a mid-week busy night dinner I throw it together in the morning and when I come in from work throw it in the oven and dinner is ready and eggs are not just for breakfast anymore. Only thing I do different is I sautee some red & green Peppers and mushrooms and add to the mix. If i could give more stars on this one I would!

This gets a 3 because it looked fabulous...I was extremely disappointed when I bit into it.  My husband like it...but he was really hungry by the time it got done.  Maybe I didnt cook it long enough...I wont try this again.  The buttered biscuits (found on this website)  stole the show for this meal.

Super easy way to prepare a whole breakfast for everyone all at once. I served this with hot pepper sauce and loved it that way. My son doesn't care for egg casserole dishes which surprised me since he loves eggs and cheese. This was great with some toast and juice for a complete meal done so simply. Very moist. I added some swiss cheese as well as some mild cheddar.

This was really good except TOO CHEESY.  I took other reviewers comments - prepped the night before and let it sit, cut down on the bread just slightly, using week old white loaf bread, doubling the ham.  But as I was adding the cheese, I was thinking this is just way too much!  Recipe calls for 1 1/2 lbs - that's 24 oz!  Since I only had 16 oz, that's what I used, and it was still too cheesy for my family.  But it baked up well, the flavor was good.  It needed an extra 10 minutes to finish the eggs, out of the water pan (so 60 mins in water pan, 10 mins without).  I also skipped the hot sauce but put sriracha on the table for diners to add.

Delicious, very easy, and turned out great!  You do not need to put it in a pan of water.  In the oven for an hour is fine.  I'm looking forward to trying other ingredients in the recipe.  I may add less cheese, as it is a bit cheesy.  Thak you for submitting the recipe!

Wonderful recipe! I used a bag of bread cubes to save on time and honey flavored ham. Everyone loved it! I didn't use the water bath, and it turned out great. I used 2 cups of cheese and added red peppers to add color.

I feel it was a little dry and you should use less bread or more egg/milk mixture.  Good combination of flavors, we enjoyed it.

Fabulous! Made it the night before with french bread and added a little more ham. Didn't have to cook with the pan of water since I made the night before.

Nice, basic recipe. Was looking for something quick and easy to make with items I had on hand for Christmas morning. Left out the onions (have one onion hater in my home) and whisked in some dijon mustard instead of the hot sauce. Only thing I would do differently next time if I planned more in advance would be to use a different bread (although the plain old white loaf bread worked just fine). Did as other's suggested and did not bake in pan of water- came out nice and firm/crispy on top. Everyone in my home enjoyed it.

this was really good! I am a vegetarian and my husband eats meat. It was very adaptable for me to make changes so I could eat it too! I didn't have any ham, so I used breakfast sausage for him and vegi breakfast sausage for myself. I didn't make it the night before, but let it sit after adding the eggs for about 20 minutes or so and didn't do the water bath... it turned out great!

This is really good! I prepared the dish the night before, and baked it in the morning for about 50/55 minutes, without the water in the pan. Delish! :)

I have made this many many times, and I love it!  I did cut the cheese in half, and added more hot sauce.  I have also made a bacon version and a sausage version.  All very good!  What a great breakfast when you have company, or for a special holiday brunch.

This recipe is a good base recipe.  I cut it in 1/2 (except the cheese and ham) and cooked in a 9x9 pan.  I thought it was good, but very bland.  It needs some playing with to make it great.  I took reviewers advice and let seep over night.  Otherwise kept everything the same.

Very yummy!  I love eggs with anything! I doubled the ham because I had leftovers. I added fresh parsley, minced garlic, Frank's Red Hot & 1/2 tsp dijon mustard.  I also ripped up some wheat rolls for the bread.  I only used 16oz of shredded cheddar, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella & a some Spicy Buffalo cheese I found at the store to give it a kick!  Hubby loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe fine although some people would say Ididn't follow it because I used sausage instead of ham and put in onion and green pepper as well.  I didn't do this overnight, and it wasn't too soggy, I also didn't use a water bath and it seemed really moist. I will use this recipe for a base and change it to suit each time!

Too much bread, very "bready"! Bland.  Still a little soggy even without using the water bath, but I couldn't bake it any longer because it would have gotten too brown on top. Wouldn't want to serve this to any guests!

We left out the hot sauce and onions and just put them on the table as options.  We also scaled down the recipe and I actually ended up having to improvise and add a little more milk and a egg mixture but it's a very easy reciped to modify.

I made this for about 10 people for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit - everyone seemed to really like it. It was very easy to make. My sister is a vegetarian, so I substituted turkey-chicken sausage for the ham, and it was very good. If you like spicy food, I recommend adding more than a dash of hot sauce.

Definately turned out much better than I expected. Minus the onions and pepper sauce (nobody in the house can tolerate them), it has the fewest ingredients of  anything I've made yet. I will absolutely be shaking things up with other ingredients next time I make it (perhaps sausage and mushrooms in place of the ham).

So easy and great to throw together in the evening and pop in the oven the next morning. I was reading the reviews about the texture and decided to cube the entire loaf of bread, instead of the 1/2 the recipe calls for. That worked perfectly with the amount of cheese it requires, but you may want to add a little extra ham. Will definitely do again and think about adding a little Dijon or green onion for some extra zing!

This is a great basic egg bake recipe.  Enjoy it as written, or substitute whatever meats/veggies/cheese you have on hand & proceed with putting it in the fridge overnight, then baking in the morning.  I like adding garlic & onion powder & 1/2 tsp of. dry mustard or a couple of squirts of dijion mustard sometimes, too.  Awesome for up at the lake when there's guests to feed & makes my morning less hectic.....just serve with some fruit and perhaps coffee cake or muffins  and everyone's happy.  I make a simple bacon & cheese only one, as well....to please the picky eaters in the crowd!

I used a bag of hash browns instead of the patties. It was tasty and turned out well. The only reasonl it didn't get 5 stars was that it wasn't very eggy although that may have been the difference in the kind of potatoes that I used. I will make it again and increase the eggs in it.

Made this exactly as directed, and it was a big hit with my company this morning. Will definitely make again. (I used a local bread from Fresh Market with the description "White with cracked wheat")

Followed recipe exactly as written except let it set in the refrigerator over night. Baked the next morning for overnight guests and we all loved it! My husband has enjoyed the leftovers for a quick warm in the microwave breakfast three days this week. I will definitely make it and enjoy it again!

This recipe is very easy and really lends itself well to improvisation. I'm not real into spicy foods so I use chives instead of Tabasco sauce. I noticed some people werent crazy about the texture. If you use a good quality french or italian bread thats a day or two old the texture should improve. I often make bread in two loaves so I use the extra loaf for this dish the next day. Try not to use regular sandwich bread it will get too soggy. You may also want to replace the cheddar with a nice Lorraine Swiss or the ham with turkey or sausage.

This is pretty good,  I added a can or ortega chilies and some chopped red bell pepper.  I suggest that you slightly beat your eggs before you add the milk.  That way it is easier to mix and you know that all the yokes are cracked.  It is really impossible to scoop out an egg after you pour it over the bread mixture, if you find it wasn't beaten enough.  If using sourdough bread, let it sit for 30 minutes before baking

I make this every Christmas Morning. I recently lost my recipe, so I resided to this. This was amazing. It didn't upset everyone, and me being the only person that knew it was a new recipe, no one said a word. I also added sausage to this, and it made it very good. Although the the texture is awkward, it was a treat for my family and I.

I substituted ingredients based on what I had on hand.  I used an olive loaf cut into cubes, brushed the pieces with olive oil and broiled them until toasted on both sides.  I substituted italian spicy sausage for the ham the first time I made it.  Everybody loved it.  The second time I used chorizo sausage, used only 16 oz of cheese, added 1 cup green onions and 1 cup of red peppers.  That was awesome!  Our guests couldn't stop eating.  Great recipe Aetibesar !  Thanks for sharing :)

I made this for my Wife's book club.  They loved it.  Five of the ladies asked for the recipe.  I doubled the recipe to make two pans.  After the 14 ladies had brunch, we only had four portions left which we warmed up for breakfast the next day.  I will be making this again.

Will definitely make this again. So easy.  Cut off crusts because I didn't have a lot of time to soak the bread. Did not use water bath. Done in 50 minutes. Looked and tasted great.  For health reasons  only used about a cup and a half of cheese.that was plenty. Also added a chopped tomato. Probably wouldn't add salt next time as ham was pretty salty. Contrary to another reviewer, I loved the leftovers.

It was very good but don't add salt!  I used French bread - that was a good suggestion.  And it cooked in exactly one hour - my ingredients were at room temp.

This recipe has the potential to be really good. The consensus, however, among my kids & me is that 1 1/2 lbs of cheddar is way too much. In fact, I wondered if the recipe included a typo. In any event, when I make it again, as I have been asked to do, I will cut back on the cheese.

This is a great recipe.  I've been making it for Christmas morning for many years. It is a family favorite.
I do only use French Bread.  I don't do a water bath but let it sit in fridge over night.
What I really wanted to convey is that my daughter is a vegetarian so I make the casserole on one half with all the ingredients and the other half with cheese/onions/sauted mushrooms only.  Works for all of us that way! Enjoy!

I've had this recipe since our Mom's Morning Out group at our church served it.  Our recipe uses 1 lb. of cubed ham, no salt, 7 slices of white bread, cubed, & 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard, & omit the green onions & hot pepper sauce.  Simpler version, but a delicious recipe.  My family still loves it!  We just had it for brunch today!

Very good recipe.  I used an entire French bread stick and increased the eggs to twelve and milk to 3 cups because of the added density.  Came out perfect.

Very good, next time would add a few seasonings and make sure I greased the pan better.  I had a bit of a problem with it sticking.  Fun recipe to have!  Served with biscuits and hashbrowns.  Also did not use a waterbath and it was fine.

Very modifiable as a base. Made for 6. I followed aetibesar's advice and tossed the dry ingredients in flour, covered and kept the dish in the fridge overnight. Turned out pretty good as part of a mother's day brunch. I only used maybe a quarter pound (110g) of cheese, and instead of ham I added about 130g rice and hamburger mix. I also used rye bread, which tasted excellent, and added chives on top. Needed more spice.

I really liked this recipe!  I changes it to inclue 1/2 cup pepperoni, as I like things a little more spicy!

I made this for Easter breakfast and it was wonderful.  I would suggest maybe adding some spice to it though.

Perfect weekend breakfast. Prepared the night before, so we can just pop it in the oven. I bake covered with foil for 45 min and uncovered the last 15 min. No water bath necessary.

This was a great hit on xmas morning. I omitted the green onions and instead added chopped sauteed onions and bacon instead of ham. It was awesome!

This was incredibly easy to cook, and it tasted very good!  I cooked it for Christmas brunch, and it was a hit.  I used French bread, and I prepared it the day before and just popped it in the oven on Christmas morning, and it turned out great.  I did not put in as much cheese as the recipe called for, and I think that was a good decision.

I REALLY love this recipe!  I make breakfasts alternately for our Sunday School class (about 30 people), and I try lots of casseroles, etc.  This is the best egg-type casserole I've ever had!  I didn't have green onions, so I just sprinkled in a few dried minced onions, but that's all I changed.

This was very good.  I trimmed the recipe to four servings and used Texas bread.  I used Jack cheese because that is what I had on hand. I will diffently be makin this again.

This had a good flavor, but I think the recipe calls for too much milk.  I will make this again and use only 1 cup of milk and see what happens.  I am also going to add green chili peppers to it.
