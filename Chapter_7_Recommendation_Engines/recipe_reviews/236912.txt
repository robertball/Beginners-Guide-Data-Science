What a pleasant surprise.  This took 1 minute 10 seconds in the microwave, and it was GOOD!   Many mug cakes are dry, but not the case with this one. It's a little spongy, but plenty moist. Thanks, emignance, for sharing the best mug recipe that I've ever had.

Wow.  Do not believe the review that says this lacks peanut butter taste!  I didn't have "egg substitute" so I used Greek yogurt which makes a good egg substitute.  Perhaps whatever that reviewer used as a substitute was a bad choice.  This was very peanut butter-y and, after inverting the mug, the jelly on top just sort of oozed down the sides.  It was amazing and wow - peanut butter-y!

I made this with real eggs and I waited until after cooking to add my jelly so it could melt into the cake. The cake was moist but lacking in peanut butter flavor. Instead it ended up tasting of scrambled eggs with a mild peanut butter flavoring. I am going to tinker with this one because I think it has a great start to something great.

This is a fun and delicious recipe.   I multiplied it out to feed 12 in my baking class, and tomorrow I'll be making it for the two of us.   I used real eggs.  I didn't find the jam on the bottom did anything but what did work REALLY well was putting a spoonful on top when serving it.  A dollop of whipped cream and it was perfection in a mug. I would reinforce spraying the mugs really well, on the outside as well, just in case of overflows.  I turned it out of the mug to serve.
