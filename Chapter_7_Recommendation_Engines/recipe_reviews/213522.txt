My Husband and I thought it was very good. I would suggest cutting it first, then layer with toppings. But other than that, it was very yummy :)

I didn't have a jalapeno on hand, so to add flavour
I added approx. 1 tablespoon of taco seasoning and a dash of Frank's hot sauce to the soup mixture - delicious!
I rolled the leftovers up, wrapped in some wax paper and nuked for lunch the next day and they were just as good.  Thanks for the great recipe!
