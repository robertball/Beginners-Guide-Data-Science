Okay, a few things:  Food processor-- Put the nuts in first, grind to a coarse grain, then add the flour and seasonings.  Nuts just kind of floated around in the cup of flour, and I had to put it through a sieve to get the nuts.  Baking-- These spread about a centimeter in all directions as they bake.  Complex or subtly curved shapes (snails, hearts, multi-stroke kanji) do not survive.  Shapes with sharp corners, like stars, turned out surprisingly well.  Either stick to circles, stars, and certain flower shapes, or do your cutting post-baking (I really wanted those snails).  The dough was tasty, though I'd probably add more lemon zest and maybe some extract or liquer next time.  I substituted a tin of peanut with coconut from the oriental grocery for the hazelnuts, and they were nice.  Any distintively flavorful nut would do well.  I misread the recipe as advising "lemon molasses", which confused me, so I ended up with bootstrap molasses in my cookie sandwiches.  It, um, seems alright.  They're not seeping too badly, and after they've chillded I think they'll be fine.  The holes I made, having shrunk in baking, actually looked pretty classy with the molasses showing through.  Again, a star shape worked well, although it did not really resemble a star.  The cookies were pretty crumbly, though again I think that would be improved by more solid shapes.  I've yet to try a sandwich, but the scraps from my pan were quite nice.

This cookie is a very delicious cookie, and I find myself wanting to lick out the filling and just eat the cookie by itself.  The lemon marmalade I had was kind of bitter, so I made some using that, orange marmalade (better), and Trader Joe's Salted Caramel Sauce.  I think that something with dark chocolate or semisweet would even be better!  When I put the two cookies together, I thought they were a little thick, so next time I'd make them a little thinner than 1/4".  I used my linzer cookie cutter, so rather than 6 cookies, I ended up with 13 cookies because they are smaller (I would have had 14 except I did a little taste testing in there).  I also cooked them about 15 minutes at 325.  I did as the first reviewer suggested to grind the nuts first using my Cuisinart Smartstick.  I forgot to sprinkle them with powdered sugar, so next time I'll do that.  And there will be a next time!  Thank you for a wonderful little cookie, Laria Tabul.
