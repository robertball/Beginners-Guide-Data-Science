I added bay leaves to my adobo.  The vinegary taste is part of the dish.  Filipinos also mix pork and chicken together.  Thanks for the recipe.  Lola would be proud.

I knew when i looked over the recipe that i would like this one and i was right. It was really good! It was the first time i used pickling seasoning. I thought it gave it a good flavor. I did however end up adding a lil bit of brown sugar towards the end to take the vinegar-y taste down a notch. I will definitely make this version again.

My husband is Filipino and I have grown to love Filipino food over the years. I was looking for a good recipe that I could use that was similar to the way his Mom makes it. This is it!  The only thing I did different was not add the pickling spice (I did not have any), instead added a few bay leaves.  Served over Jasmine rice - Delish! Thank you for sharing.

So yummy and easy! My five year old loves it too! The only thing I did different was instead of pickling spice (did not have any) I used bay leaf, a dash of cinnamon, ginger, and black pepper.

Delicious recipe!  Just right for my adobo craving tonight.  I added a little more water at the end to keep the sauce from completely evaporating, and added a little Splenda for sweetness.  We had no leftovers at our house -- the three-year--old grandson ate three helpings with rice!

Pretty true to the original recipe as my family knows it. 1:1:1 water:vinegar:soy sauce ratio.  Instead of pickling spice, we just toss in a few whole peppercorns and bay leaves and call it good.  We also brown the chicken after simmering in the soy/vinegar/water mix.

This was wonderful, just like what I grew up eating.  I could not find pickling spice so I used 2 Tbsp. Zatarans crab boil in the bag, I just cut the bag open any put 2 Tbsp. Into a tea ball (cheap easy and reusable) and it came out great.  The crab boil is available in the spice isle and has about 1 cup of mixed spices in it, so there is plenty left for the next time I make this, which will be soon!!! The next time I will probably use a whole cut up chicken with bones and skin as I found that the chicken was slightly dry after 1 hour of cooking. Thank you or this recipe, I love it!!!!

This was good.  He liked it even though it doesn't taste like his mother's (or at least that's what he said).

Sorry, but even using a low salt soy sauce, I found this way to salty. The soy saltiness was so overpowering I couldn't even taste the other spices.

Perfect!  The flavor is on point, next time I am going to add a little less soy sauce than 1/2 cup...kids couldn't handle the original Filipino "salty" taste that I grew up with when my mother made it .  Otherwise, WONDERFUL!

Perfect! This is a good traditional adobo recipe and my filipino husband said it tasted just right. We added two sliced onions as his family does, and a bay leaf, and omitted the pickling spices. Turned out great!

This was a great, easy recipe...wonderful flavor and the tenderest chicken. I also did not have the pickling spice so I just used fresh cracked pepper, a bay leaf and a dash of ground clove and my family raved about it. Definitely a recipe that you can tweak here and there. Soy sauce, vinegar and water are key though, also lots of garlic.

It was a good recipe.  I used butter instead of vegetable oil, so for the calorie counters out there, I guess vegetable oil will do.  Instead of white rice I made brown rice.  Pickling spice wasn't necessary.  The soy sauce and vinegar was all that was needed.

Thanks for posting an authentic recipe. I think I will make an adjustment or two. Mine turned out a bit salty but I think it might be because there wasn't enough liquid to completely cover the chicken. Easily remedied. Grandma would be proud :)

My husband is Filipino and every time I make this for him he says that it reminds him of his mother's cooking. I don't use the pickling spice and he likes when I use chicken drumsticks instead of thighs but both ways come out nice and tender. Well done!

The chicken just didn't taste finished. And the cider vinegar overpowered a lot of the taste. But it was good w/ some siracha sauce & black pepper on it. Would not make it again but only because it was to hard to make.

Easy and great flavor.  Added 2 more very large cloves of garlic for a total of 8 cloves, and for pickling spices, I used crushed peppercorns, bay leaves, and cinnamon stick.  My husband said that the adobo he’s had before is sweet but he liked this one better.  My 6 year old loved it.  Served it over jasmine rice and  sautéed onions and zucchini in a buttery cream sauce on the side.

Very good, I didn't use the pickling spices as I have no clue what that is. But this was very good, served with cauliflower rice. Will be making this again.

I used white vinegar, but I think apple cider vinegar would give it a fuller taste. Very easy and enjoyed by all my non-Filipino friends.

My mom made this recipe too & added a tablespoon of flour to thicken sauce, and also aded grilled onions, sliced diced celery, potatoes, carrots or red/green peppers.  It's very flexible recipe & one favorite  comfort food over rice

This was amazing! I was trying something new to feed my family (I’m on break before college) and my parents couldn’t stop raving.

My family loved this recipe. I actually didn't have fresh garlic and improvised and used garlic powder. Since I had almost 5 lbs of chicken legs I did double the recipe. It came out delicious. I've never used apple cider vinegar and thought it made this taste amazing. 5 thumbs ups for sure.

Delicious adobo recipe! I love the use of the spice packet. My family always added relish into the sauce...this tastes pretty much the same, with the perfect tang. BTW, the sauce is PERFECT over rice. Thanks for Lolah's recipe!!!

This turned out very well! I ended up doubling the wet to make sure all my protein was covered for the cooking process. This calls for boneless skinless chicken thighs, but the image with the recipe clearly shows bone in thighs. I went with boneless. I also used half dark soy sauce for added depth. Leftovers were great too! Will make again.

Best adobo I've ever made and by far the simplest/easiest. Thank you for sharing @foodelicious!

Substitute 1/2 cup of salt free chicken broth instead of water.  I also only use 1/4 cup of vinegar.
