Fabulous taste. I added some brown sugar, dijon mustard and lemon juice to the ketchup.  It's a keeper.  I'll make this again for sure.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

The recipe for this meatloaf was excellent!  My only problem with it was the same that I have had with all other turkey meatloaf recipes I've attempted to make - the loaf came out VERY watery.  Seems like I can't find a recipe where the meatloaf actually stays dry.  The meatloaf tasted fantastic, and I'll definitely use this recipe again.  I recommend it, but if you know of a way to keep the meatloaf from turning out watery,  you'll have to employ that here.  Very good aside from that!

This is the best ever meatloaf recipe!  I discovered it on the box and have been making it for a few years.  If you like mozzarella cheese and/or are on a "Zone" diet, add a layer of this cheese in the middle before you bake it.  It melts right in and is so lovely.  It's a great suprise for those cheese lovers like myself!

This is the best turkey meatloaf I have ever made! Make sure to let it sit for the 5 or more minutes so it solidifies. I sauteed some diced red peppers and mushrooms with the onions for some extra veggies. My 2 year old ate it and loved this. Thank you. I will definitely make it again and try to hide more veggies.

This really is the "Best Ever Meatloaf"! Not soupy at all & works great with ground beef, chuck also! I usually make one with turkey (for me) and one with beef (for my husband).

Excellent!! I am trying to cut out as much salt as possible from my family's diet, so I made this recipe exactly as listed except for omitting the salt, using unsalted butter, and instead of ketchup, I used no salt added tomato sauce with a little brown sugar added to it. It was delicious and the left-overs were just as good as it was the first night. I highly recommend this recipe!!

I added a few spices (onion powder, garlic powder, homemade italian seasoning, red pepper flake) but other than that, I stuck to the recipe. I made this in my Perfect Meatloaf Pan and let it sit fifteen minutes once I took it out of the oven. My family liked it okay. This was firm enough after sitting in the fridge overnight to make a meatloaf sandwich the next day. My husband said it was better in a sandwich. Nothing personal against the recipe, I just think my family likes beef meatloaf better.

The first time I made this my husband was so impressed with this dish. He hardly ever gets meals like this. The 2nd time I made this dish was for a family dinner. My in-laws are filipino and a lot of the foods they eat are exoctic or asian. They were so impressed with this dish that I was asked to make it again. I really enjoyed the reviews the one especially that said to cook the meatloaf for 30 mins then add the ketchup it really  makes it juicy. I also used rolled oats instead bread crumbs it was filling and it also prevented the meatloaf from being so runny.

This is the the best basic turkey meatloaf I have ever made.  The only change I made was use an extra 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs.  Simple and very very good.  This is my new go-to recipe.

I think this is better than hamburger.  I added about 1/4 cup more breadcrumbs so that it wouldn't be watery like some had written about and I added about 1 Tbs mustard and brown sugar to the ketchup for the top. This is a keeper

Excellent turkey meatloaf. I didn't have any problems with it being watery, but I did make a couple changes. I sauteed the garlic and onions in a few drops of olive oil rather than butter. I also toasted and then cut up 2 slices of whole wheat toast and used them instead of bread crumbs. I also added a bit of mustard and brown sugar to the ketchup and instead of mixng it into the loaf, I left the ketchup mixture out and spread it on top of the loaf when there was about 20 min of baking time left. VERY GOOD!

This is one of our favorite ways to make turkey meatloaf.  My youngest son can never get enough.  We always make with mashed potatoes as a side dish.  Always moist and the consistency is perfect.

Fantastic! I did add extra bread crumbs (the first time; the second time I used all crushed Triscuits for the whole-grain appeal) and that helped with the texture. It would have been far too wet otherwise. I also used extra onion and extra garlic. Other than that, this was perfect - great flavor, and just as good the next day!

This is my first turkey meatloaf and I wasn't sure how it would come out.  I read the comment about it being watery so I substituted dry breadcrumbs for the fresh & it wasn't watery at all.

This was pretty good.  I didn't use butter so I didn't saute the onions or garlic.  I just threw everything together in a bowl, except for the ketchup.  Although instead of using ketchup, I used BBQ sauce on top instead.  After baking I let it rest for a few minutes, and it sliced and held together quite nicely.  A bit dry, but I did use extra lean ground turkey.  Nonetheless, I will make again.

This was great! I used 1 Tbsp of Smart Balance butter to cut down on the fat, and it was fine. I also used 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs instead of the fresh. There was some liquid in the pan when I pulled it out of the oven, so I poured out what I could before letting it rest for the 5 minutes. I'll def. make this again!

Great recipe! I used half ketchup and half spaghetti sauce (it was in the fridge, so I figured-- why not?). It turned out great. Even better the next day as a sandwich. I will definitely make this again. *** UPDATE -- I make this frequently, changing up the topping. Mixing a little dijon mustard and brown sugar with the ketchup is one of the best I've tried.

It becomes a five star recipe if you skip the ketchup on top and put three slices of bacon on the top instead.  The bacon cooks up crispy and makes the meatloaf delicious without adding a great deal of calories - if you skip the butter and use the bacon instead, the calories remain about the same.  I also chop up and saute 8oz of mushrooms and put them in the middle to increase the volume and flavor.

To avoid the watery outcome mentioned by another reviewer, replace the bread crumbs with a heaping 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats (i.e., Quaker Oats). Delicious - a family favorite!

This recipe was great! As a vegetarian, I didn't try it - But my husband said it was great and my 4-year-old - who rarely eats any meat - finished ALL of hers! My mother loved it and my father said it was the best thing I ever made. In addition to the fresh breadcrumbs, I added about 1/4-1/2 cup of shashed up italian flavored croutons and I didn't add the Worcesteshire sauce because I didn't have any. GREAT RECIPE!!!

This was an excellent meatloaf.  This was my first time to try a turkey meatloaf.  My boyfriend said it was the best he ever had!!  I used my Pampered Chef loaf pan and ended up cooking it 5 minutes less than suggested.  You may want to check about 5 minutes before the recipe says so as not to overcook.  I also added green peppers to the onion/garlic mixture.  It was DELICIOUS!!  Will make again and again.

I recently discovered ground turkey and was in desperate need of a good recipe. This was just what I was looking for! Delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and added some brown sugar, mustard (I only had Sweet & Tangy), and lemon juice to the ketchup topping. I also decreased the calories even more by using egg substitute and less butter. I also had no bread crumbs and used crushed crackers instead and added lots of other seasonings (like Italian herbs and a 'hamburger' mix). Great recipe and you can't mess it up!

Very Flavorful.  I have made turkey meatloafs before and they were always bland - not this one.  I used a mixture of plain and seasoned bread crumbs instead of the fresh.  My 4 year old daughter devoured it.  Per other reviews used a topping of ketchup, dijon, and brown sugar mixture for sauce on top - put on the last 10 minutes of baking.  This recipe would be good with or without the sauce.  Definately a redo in our house.

Much better than I expected.  The only changes I made were that I only used 1/4 ketchup and did not spread the remaining on the loaf before cooking.  I also used two small eggs because we were out of large eggs and I added chopped orange  raw to the meat once I added the onion and garlic (cooked according to directions).  I was concerned that it wouldn't be moist.  It definitely was quite moist.  I am definitely going to make this again soon!

This is the only recipe I use for Turkey Meatloaf!  I use onion and green pepper and I do NOT saute them prior to adding to meat.  I just mix it all in a bowl and then put into pan.  If it feels too wet, I just add some extra bread crumbs or some crushed cheese crackers.  Sometimes I throw in some shredded cheddar cheese too.

This was so good.  I was very skeptical about the ground turkey as I have never been a big fan of it but you really couldn't tell much of a difference from the beef version.  Thanks for the tip to add dijon and brown sugar to the glaze.  I used crushed croutons (fat-free cheesy garlic) instead of the bread crumbs for extra flavor.  Great recipe!

I made this turkey loaf today, but I left out the butter and used Ritz Crackers.  I also added taco seasoning, scallions, and chopped bell pepper.  It was dry, but ok.  I would make this again, but I'm in no rush to make it again.  Thank you.

I tried this recipe because I had bought ground turkey on a whim at the supermarket and I love meatloaf.  But when I made this, neither I nor my family was very impressed. It was a little bland. If I ever make it again I will add something extra to it.  Until then I will stick with beef.

This is my "go-to" meatloaf recipe and it's THE BEST!  It is moist, flavorful and delicious. I do like to tweak it a little bit.  
*I add more garlic because we love garlic.... so twice as much.  
*I also like to add 1 chopped green bell pepper (or red bell or both) to the onions as I cook them down. Try it - YUM! 
*On occasion I will also add cooked quinoa to the mix as a substitute for some of the bread crumbs (or in addition).
* I also like to use whole wheat breadcrumbs when possible.

Seriously people - this recipe is the best. Try it!

I took note of the warnings that this was going to be drippy so I added maybe a tablespoon of extra bread crumbs. I was going to do real bread crumbs but for time's sake I did the fake ones. Made the recipe according to the directions. Substitued 1/4 BBQ sauce on the top, and maybe added about 1 extra Tbsp of ketchsup on the top to cover. Baked for 50 minutes in a 8x4 pan and it came out delish!

This was kind of bland. Just tasted like a big meatball. The texture was fine though.

This recipe was great!  Super easy and absolutely delicious and moist.  I didn't have any bread crumbs but used stuffing mix instead by slightly smashing it up and it really gave this meatloaf an added a thanksgiving flavor.  Will make this again and again!

This was pretty good.  Moist, but could have used a bit more flavour.  I don't have a loaf pan, so I just formed it and put it in a baking dish.  I don't know if that had anything do with it, but mine really didn't hold together well while slicing it.  The whole family really enjoyed it though.

I would give this more stars if I could. I added bell peppers and used chili sauce to top instead of ketchup. Will be making this more often.

Very, very good and very easy.  My teenage daughter professes not to like meatloaf but I caught her sneaking a slice!

The whole family loved it!  Even my 12 year old that said "yuck meatloaf", before trying it.

I recently cut red meat out of my diet and was looking for a good meatloaf recipe made with turkey or chicken.  My husband is a huge meatloaf lover and was very leary of a non-beef version.  He loved it!  Said he liked it better than my usual beef meatloaf.  I added dijon and brown sugar to the ketchup mixture.  Really great

This was my first meatloaf, and it turned out excellent. I have been searching for a recipe for meatloaf, and I always use turkey, so this recipe was perfect. I did not have fresh garlic, but the minced in a jar, and it turned out just fine. I used fresh wheat bread for breadcrumbs, and it turned out well. I impressed myself, and will definitely be making this again and again.

My family has requested that I replace the ground beef meatloaf that I usually make w/ THIS recipe.  It's THAT good.  Moist, VERY flavorful and also makes great meatloaf sandwiches the next day.  Thank you!

This was great!   I didn't have any Ketchup so I used Heinz Exotic Sauce (Kinda of sweet Indian flavours) and it was really fantastic.  Other from that, I followed the recipe exactly.   Made individual portions by baking in muffin tins and it made 6 equal servings.  I will definitely make again and even might try making them into paddies to put on the grill.

I was prepared for a dud!  Turkey meatloaf?  But it was a keeper.  I used the extra-lean turkey (1g of fat vs. 8g for the lean)and used chili sauce instead of ketchup in the mixture.  Added some dried parsley and a little seasoning mix.  It was a very dry loaf, so I served it with mashed potatoes and gravy, but next time I will use a 1/2 cup of the chili sauce for a moister loaf.  Will definitely make again.  Who knew turkey meatloaf could be so good?

My family has been trying to cut down on fat. I made this meatloaf just last week and they are already asking for it again.  With recipes like this it makes it easy to get rid of the red meat!

Great base recipe! Here are my modifications: subbed garlic powder for cloves, added red and green bell pepper, 1/2c. instant oats instead of crumbs, omitted butter and used only the egg white. It held together great. YUM!!!

This meatloaf was awesome! I am a recovering vegetarian and it was nice to get to eat meatloaf without it being too heavy or fatty. I can't ever just follow a recipe so I made a few small changes and then cooked it in a heart shaped cake pan for Valentine's Day and it was well received by the whole family. I added a little yellow pepper to the onion garlic mix, and used 2/3 ground turkey and 1/3 ground turkey sausage.

This was a good recipe. However, I added 1/3 part ground beef. It helps hold the loaf together. I also made MORE topping => ketchup, brown sugar, mustard and honey. My family LOVED it. They made happy face plates:)

Quite good.  It was very juicy and had good flavor for turkey.  I was worried about it being a weird texture or bland and it wasn't.  It was, however, too sugary for our taste.  I'm sure that's the ketchup's fault.  Not sure if reducing the ketchup is the right way to remedy that, though.

It was fine - it needed more flavor.
