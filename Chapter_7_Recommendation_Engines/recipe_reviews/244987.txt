After 3 tries, and some minor adjustments, these are now perfect.  I  didn't find the muffins sweet enough as is, so I added 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I wasn't sure what yo do with the random 2tbsp. flour, so I added it it the topping.  Bake time is closer to 22mins @ 400F.

It was very moist and Delicious, but you should  add an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the batter, and used the random 2 tablespoons of flour in the topping. I also recommend an extra tablespoon of butter to the topping. I hope you enjoy the muffins

Tasty and moist muffins! I used melted butter for the oil, omitted the salt since I am on a low sodium diet, used 1/4 cup milk and increased applesauce to 3/4 cup, reduced rolled oats and flour to 1 1/4 cups each, batter perfect not dry. I baked at 375 for 18 minutes which was perfect in my oven, skipped topping, #50 scoop yielded 14 muffins. I agree maybe using apple juice for the milk would make it even better!

It was a little dry, but the taste was good. I would add 3/4 cup apple sauce next time  to increase the moisture.

I found these to be moist and delicious.  The kids gobbled them up. We left the sugar as is. The first time I made them I was short 1/2cup oats so I used 1 cup old fashioned oats and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal. Very good. The next time I made them I followed the recipe as written and they were  very good. I am using this as my base muffin recipe from here on out. I have substituted 1cup grated zucchini for the diced apple with rave reviews. This is a tasty no fail recipe in this household. I make them at least once a week. I’m making them with pumpkin purée and pumpkin pie spice with dried cranberries as I type.

I did what other reviews suggested and added an extra 1/4c brown sugar to the batter. I don’t like my muffins too sweet and these were perfect. I also used quick cooking steel cut oats instead of rolled oats bc that’s all I had. I was worried but they came out just fine. My kids loved these. I will definitely be making them again.

I made changes as recommended by others: 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup. 3/4 cup applesauce instead of 1/2 cup. Added lots of chopped apple to use up what i had. Nice and moist and appley :) Probably could have substituted whole wheat flour instead of ap flour easily and not have noticed. Will try next time.

So yummy! Moist and delicious. Make sure to chop apple into small pieces. Press crumble topping into batter a little or it will fall off when done. I added chopped walnuts and a handful of raisins, and a pinch of nutmeg. I didn’t add more sugar to batter and they are sweet enough for me. Good breakfast muffin!

Very good flavor. Didn't have any applesauce so I made my own (just a little bragging). Found the chopped apples made the muffins fall apart so think I'd use chunky applesauce next time. Wanted it sugar free but don't like the after taste so I used sugar free maple syrup. Will make again.

These were good, but maybe not sweet enough. Next time try adding 1/4 c brown sugar to the muffins. I added the random 2T flour to the muffins, not the topping and it worked out fine. This made 14 muffins, so I put papers in 2 coffee mugs for baking. About 1t topping/muffin was perfect.

These were wonderful!!  I only made a couple of changes and only because I didn't have the ingredients available.  I used apple juice instead of milk and melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  The sugar level was perfect!  They were moist and delicious!  My husband absolutely loved them!  Thank you!!

I made these with a healthy (ish) breakfast muffin in mind. I didn't have any applesauce, but my apple was larger and I added a shredded purple carrot. The other reviews said the muffins were not sweet enough, so I drizzled wildflower honey over the tops while they were still hot and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. When I make them again I think I will add another carrot and add the applesauce this time!

I added 1/4 brown sugar to the mix and an extra Tsp. of butter to the topping.  I also used old fashioned oats and butter instead of oil, because I had no oil.  I only cooked mine for the 15 minutes and they came out very moist. I came out with a total of 17 muffins.  I will definitely be making these again.

I substituted old fashioned oats  (all I had) and apple juice for the milk to intensify the apple flavor. I also added quarter teaspoons of nutmeg and cardamom. Probably because of the oats it took closer to 20 minutes to bake. Came out pretty well!

This turned out GREAT!!  I didn’t have vegetable oil so I used olive oil, cuz thats all I use in my cooking, and it turned out great!!  It tastes good too!!  Not too sweet but just sweet enough. I’m very picky about the texture of pastries and this one passed for me  My one year old had 2.5 muffins and I had to make him stop

This turned out absolutely delicious.  I enhanced the recipe slightly by putting in some pear in addition to the apple and adding large quantities of freshly grated ginger.  These were wonderfully moist.

I have Celiac, so I substituted gluten-free all-purpose flour and added an extra 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce to account for the dryness.  Turned out really well, delicious!

My family liked these muffins, however I was not a fan.  I found them really dense with the oatmeal and very heavy.  Next time I make them, I'll cut back on the amount of oatmeal and add more flour.

The crumb mixture wasn't like other crumbs, next time I would not melt the butter, rather just "cut in" butter into the mixture.

OMG! So good I made as is. And left 2 without the topping mixture. The topping made it more tasty, but the ones without the topping were good for the mature pallet. Also went well with coffee. A bit crumbly but tastes moist. I also added about 1/2 cup raisins since my family likes raisins. The chopped apples cooked nicely as well and added a nice texture Baked 400 for 15 minutes. Came out perfectly cooked.

I made these without the topping and absolutely loved them. My wife isn't crazy about anything with cinnamon and even she really enjoyed them.
Definitely a go-to staple for me from now on.

I actually like that this muffin is not toooo sugary. The Apples make is plenty sweet. I was also able to substitute a flax egg and almond milk to work around allergies and the texture was still great.

I thought these were delicious. I made two slight variations.. I shredded the apple with a cheese grater since one reviewer mentioned the apple chunks made the muffins heavy and easy to fall apart. I also had a small bit (less than a 1/4 of a bag) of white chocolate chips that I threw in the batter and topping. Was able to get 16 small-average size muffins and baked for just barely 15 minutes. Totally delicious, hit the spot, not too sweet but definitely tasty and substantial with the oatmeal. Can only have one because they’re slated for a friend.. booohooooo. :) I could definitely eat way more than one! :)

I used my large food scoop and ended up with 18 muffins. I put the extra 2 Tbls. Of flour in the topping since it made the most sense to add it to the streusel. Next time I’m going to add another chopped apple to the muffin batter & some nuts to the topping. Otherwise, they are very good!  My husband loved them!

These are absolutely delicious!    I made them three time and the last time I added dried cranberries.
The apple adds texture and the topping is a nice touch.
I will make these over and over again!

Like most, I changed some things. Used melted butter instead of oil. Subbed in almond flour for a quarter cup of the flour. Had no applesauce so used an extra egg and subbed in apple juice for the milk.  Added only a little more brown sugar, maybe a tablespoon or so. Chopped up my honeycrisp very small, almost minced. Moist and delicious.

These are fantastic!! I made them exactly as written the first time. Subtly sweet, moist, flavorful and very yummy. The second time (same day as the first batch was gone by lunchtime) I added dried cranberries and walnuts. Super yum!!

I'm not a fan of sugar or other concoctions sprinkled on top of muffins and cupcakes, etc., so I skipped that part of this recipe. Also, my son doesn't like cinnamon, and the applesauce I had on hand had cinnamon in it, so I didn't add the 1/4 tsp, hoping it would still work out. And, I didn't peel the (two small) apples; I wanted that part in there. I have a little doohickey that chops things with the pull of a string that spins the blade, and that made the pieces quite small. (I did core them, though.)

In the end, really not bad at all. It did feel like it lacked something, so maybe next time I would add a teensy bit more vanilla, but even so the recipe as I made it turned out happily. My son really enjoyed them and ate two, and I ate one earlier in the day and then one when he had his. The muffins were flavorful and moist, and really so easy to make. It seems this recipe has a great advantage in that it's flexible (which is not my usual experience with baking, only cooking), and that's one reason I will definitely be making these again! 

Thanks for submitting this recipe, I love it!

Delicious. The only change I made was to use fresh ground whole wheat (spring white), which worked fine. I think you could even cut back on the sugar a wee bit and still have an enjoyable muffin (my applesauce was unsweetened but homemade, which tends to be sweeter).

Had to really really tweak this recipe. I forgot the apple so added frozen mixed berries instead but added 1 banana to applesauce/egg mix, about 2 cups of applesauce and about 1/2cup of milk to thin out the mixture then mixed in some chopped walnuts. They came out beautiful and mini! My kids love them and they are a great breakfast treat. I ommitted the brown sugar topping since berries made it sweet enough.

Added an extra apple, which tasted amazing but I learned after that they need to completely  cool before eating otherwise the muffin falls apart in the wrapper.

Like others, I made a few changes--an extra egg, 1/4 cup of oil, and, instead of the streusel topping, I just sprinkled the muffins with can nana on sugar before baking. They were hearty, and good!

Very badly written recipe. Not in order, AND an egg isn't listed in the ingredients! If you're new to baking this recipe would be a disaster. Fortunately I saw the egg mentioned in the directions and stopped before I made a big mess. This needs to be deleted and rewritten. It could be a great recipe.

Very tasty.  Had the following minor changes:  only 1/4 tsp of salt and probably wouldn't have needed any.  Didn't do the full crumb topping, but only gave a sprinkle of brown sugar to each one.  Used mini muffin tins, made 24 of them with this recipe.  Baked at 400 for 11 minutes and they were perfect.

Delicious with a few changes ;) ....


As has been suggested before, in the topping I used 2 tbsp butter instead of 1 tbsp. I also added pumpkin seeds and desiccated coconut.


In the muffin mix I added raisins and used fruit jam instead of applesauce to make it sweeter. I reduced the oats to 1 1/4 cups and used two apples instead of one.


Lastly, I caramelised the apple chunks in 1 tbsp sugar and a knob of butter and left to cool in the fridge before adding to the muffin mix.

Very good! We were between applesauces so I used black cherry yogurt. I also upped the brown sugar to 3/4C as per several reviews. There may have been other slight changes due to my 18 m/o sous chef's "assistance," but they turned out moist and not overly sweet. Gotta say, struesel topping is extra ambitious when you're fending off little fingers that are trying to eat the batter.

3 20 17 .... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/244987/apple-cinnamon-oatmeal-muffins/ ... Sorry, but I had to make changes.  The batter was so thick that it wouldn't be good without adding liquid.  E, almost 20, gave a thumbsup; but with changes.  Here's the scribble from my hoping & not hoping these would be good:  1 1/3c oats (soaked) 1 1/4c flour, 1/2c brownsugar, 1 1/2t cinnamon, 1t baking powder, 1/2t baking soda & salt, 1/4c apple juice concentrate, 1/3c water, 1/4c oil, 1egg (beaten), 1t vanilla.  I wasn't impressed, but he liked 'em & I'll play more.

I confess I am an idiot, the second time I made them I only saw the 2 tbsp of flour and that is what I added.  But I don't understand why the recipe is written as it is.  Is it 1 1/4 cups flour PLUS 2 tbsp?  If so, why isn't it just written as 1 1/3 cup flour?  Or does the extra go somewhere else?  I only saw this addressed in a couple other reviews, and they added to the topping.  Flour in the topping makes sense, but it is clearly listed in the muffin ingredient section.  Would love to get clarification from the author so I  know how to make them as intended.  For what it is worth, they are pretty tasty with only 2 tbsp of flour!  And I know they were really good the first time I made them, I just can't remember what I did with the extra flour ...

I like that these muffins are not too sweet, and that the tartness from the apples really balances the flavour.  I used whole wheat flour and will experiment with other types of flours when I make this recipe again.

Excellent muffins.

Did not have fresh apples, so I used sliced apple pieces.  They were soft and not dried as I had expected.  Also substituted sweetened cinnamon applesauce.  Cinnamon chips were used instead of cinnamon.  My topping was a little dry, so I added a little more butter.  Will probably try some nuts the next time.

This is a good basic recipe. My first time making them, I kept the recipe as is, but discovered they were a little bland (admittedly I left out the diced apples because I didn't have an apple). On my next batch I will add 1/4 cup more brown sugar and either some dried cranberries or raisins and some chopped nuts. Also I opted to use coconut oil and coconut milk for health reasons, but like the idea of using apple juice too, as mentioned in another review...

Great recipe! I had to substitute melted butter for the oil - they turned out beautifully. Timing was not enough; they needed at least 20 minutes. The end result was a moist, delicious muffin I will be making frequently - and they are so pretty!

Really delicious!  The topping makes these muffins special.  I made my muffins smaller (I believe) and I ended up with 18 muffins.  I doubled the topping to accommodate the extra muffins.
