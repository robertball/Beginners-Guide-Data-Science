Let me start by saying, I love pork roast!  I had my doubts about the method, as I have never had good luck using a high heat start. (ALWAYS start with a really clean oven, which I did.)  I ignored my inner warning bells and pressed on.   After 15 minutes at 475, I had SMOKE, the kind of smoke that fills the entire house.  I had to abandon ship! The internal temp of the roast was only at 45 degrees.  I turned the oven OFF and did not open the door.  The meat sat in the off oven for another 15 minutes while I aired out the house, opened every window and the doors too.  (Thank goodness the neighbors didn't call the fire dept.)   At this point the internal temp was 76 degrees.  I removed the roast from the oven, turned the oven back on to 325 and allowed the pork to rest for 30 minutes as directed.  Placed the roast back in the oven and roasted to 140 (which seemed like it took forever)   I removed the roast at 140 and allowed it to rest and come to 145.  Was it moist?  Yes, but that is because it was not over cooked.  Would I recommend this method?  Never!   It is so easy to sear a roast and cook it low and slow, using the suggested probe thermometer.

Found this recipe long ago on a blog.  Single dad chef or something.  Thankfully, I printed it because I couldn't find it after a while.  So glad to find it here.  We make this all the time.  We are a family of seven and raise pigs for 4H so lots of pork roasts!  Turns out great every time.  If you have any problems, try checking your oven temp for accuracy and make sure you have a good meat thermometer.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this last night and WOW! Was so moist and tender. Great flavor. Only thing I did different was put some minced garlic in rub. This is going to be done over and over in this house.

This was delicious! Added 1 tsp fresh minced garlic and 1 tsp minced jalapeño to the rub. In the second bake, let the temp reach 145 degrees. Was super moist--will definitely make again! Thanks!!!

This was an excellent roast.  At high altitude (8500 ft) after the initial 30 minutes at 475, i needed 1 hour and 15 min at 325.  So you have to allow more time..

I just added additional seasoning but it took forever to reach 145 degrees. It took a total of 60 additional minutes to reach 146.5 degrees. My family wouldn't eat it because it was too pink. I probably won't try it again.

Most tender roast I have ever made.  Every slice has been devoured by my husband and I.  It was delicious.   After two days of roast and potatoes, the rest went to Sweet and Sour Pork.  Yum!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

Came out PERFECT. I did make a garlic and cilantro paste and added that to the marinade as well as a little turmeric and cumin. This was a triumph. I only wish my Father was here for supper to enjoy it!

I Googled "moist pork loin". This was one of the hits that came up and I must say, I past it by at first because when I read the recipe instructions and saw to cook it, then let it sit, then cook it some more....Well, for whatever reason none of the other recipes were striking my fancy so, I chose to do this one and I'm sooo glad I did. My pork loin came out PERFECTLY moist and delicious! Will definitely be doing this recipe again.

I only had a 1.5# roast,(only two people), I sprinkled it with a pork rub, then covered it with a sweet & spicy mustard sauce. Followed basic directions and still did the 30 minutes at 475º, removed from oven, and rested for 30 minutes, reduced oven temp to 325º, and then put roast back into oven at the 325º for the additional 30 minutes, and rested it "tented" for 25 minutes.  Turned out super moist.  Was still slightly pink in the center, but was done!!  Will make it again.

Just like my Dad’s! Perfect cooking technique to ensure the ends don’t dry out while the center still roasts.  Simple flavoring means this roast could be served with pretty much anything you’d like! Thanks for the reminder that sometimes the best method for cooking a meal is the most simple method.  No need for a deme glacé or a carefully placed high food presentation.  Wish I still had my Dad’s recipe cards. I’ll keep looking for yours on here :-).

Followed directions exactly but needed to cook for 15 minutes more to reach desired temperature (145 deg). Everyone loved, even my pork hating daughter. I’d call that a win.

I found 1.5 lb (half the called for amount) top roast turn out just as good. The time & temp did NOT need to be reduced with the reduced size, so long as you check with a meat thermometer.

Fantastic recipe. Changed my mind about pork, which I generally find more boring than other meats.

Dry, tough pork loin has been an issue for me. Was about to give up on this cut of meat entirely.... Until I found this recipe!  I have an extra large toaster oven. Followed directions precisely and had no smoke problem.  Raves from family of 5. Thanks for posting.

I did not change a thing except to add garlic to the rub.  This was so moist and good.  Left over sandwiches were delicious also.  Pork has a tendency to be dry, but not his one.   Will be making this one often.

I used Canadian Steak Seasoning for the rub and it was so tasty! Only issue was the final temp - 145 was still pink and runny. Continued cooking to 165 and it was perfect.

This is absolutely the best pork loin roast I have ever made! My whole family enjoyed it and agreed that for the first time ever, we did not need applesauce to rescue the roast! I cooked it exactly to the recipe.  I did add steak rub to the oil and salt and pepper. So moist and tender! Will definitely make it again!

I give this recipe a 4 star rating because although it turned out absolutely delicious, the cooking time took so much longer than expected.

I made this using a 3.5 lb. boneless roast. I used the seasonings in the recipe, but also added a tbls. of minced garlic and a tsp. of rosemary. The roast was bursting with flavor.

The cooking time took much longer than expected, but the roast I used was thick and fat, rather than long and skinny, which may have caused my cook time to increase. I suggest using a thermometer and stopping each cooking stage based on the temperature. What I ended up doing was cooking on 475 for 30 minutes, allowed it to sit for 30, and then cooked at 325 for another hour. This still turned out very tender and very juicy!

I also used the pan drippings to make gravy, which was so good I could've poured it all over my plate.

I served this with carrots, mashed potatoes and cornbread. My family loved it. We will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe, simply to follow directions. I tweaked mine with adding Sage and Thyme to the rub. the drippings made such a rich and savory gravy for the side dish of mashed potatoes.

A bit on the salty side but I know how to adjust that next time.  Delicious!  I will make this again!

This is by far the most tender, juicy pork roast I've ever made.  Thought the directions were a bit odd, but I followed them and it couldn't have turned out better.

It wasn't up to the right temp after the first 30 minutes, so I decided to put it in a roasting bag for the last half hour. It ended taking 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated, but turned out nice and moist in the roasting bag.

I didn't wait the full 30min in between the 475 and 325, I only waited 10min and i also forgot the put the oil so only put sea salt and added mustard powder.  I also put potatoes cut in 1/4 around the roast . It was fantastic
