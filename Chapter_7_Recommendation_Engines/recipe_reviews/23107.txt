This recipe was easy to pull together.  I had some leftover pepperoni and cheese from a party and found this recipe and whipped it together.  I used both muenster and colby jack and it was good.  Next time I will definitely serve it with some pizza sauce on the side for dipping.

This didn't turn out how I expected it to but it wasn't all that bad. I didn't have any pepperoni sausage so I cut up some pepperoni slices. It tasted more like an omelet than a bread. If anything else, I know another way to make a pretty mean omelet!!

This is a very heavy bread... Not bad, but not overly exciting.  Not something I'd serve to company unless they are here for a football game or similar function.

This was good, but not at all what I was expecting.  It's very egg-y. It reminded me of a breakfast item.  My boys enjoyed it. I found it a little bland even with the extra pepperoni I added. I'll most likely make it again for a nice quick and easy snack.

This wasn't bad! I used a mix of pepperoni and salami and baked it in a round pan to cut wedges. Definitely different! Thanks for sharing. :)
