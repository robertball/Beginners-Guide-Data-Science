This is very good. I followed the recipe for the most part. I first sauteed the shrimp in a little oil and garlic. Then added all the other ingredients.  I did add some salt, just for my tastes. My husband and I agreed it could use a little kick. Next time I will add a little cayenne and maybe some crabmeat.

We love this. I took it to a potluck 2 years ago and people still talk about it! I use fat-free half-and-half and it was just as good. Perfect just as written, but it does not make a lot so you might want to consider doubling the recipe if you have several hungry people!

My husband lived in Louisiana for a while. He said he had an awesome shrimp and corn chowder while he was there, but hadn't had since. I fixed this and he was awe struck! It's going to be a regular menu item at our house from now on. thanks for the recipe!

With added seasonings, I would give this five stars.  This is an easy weeknight dinner that should be doubled if feeding more than two hungry people at the table.  This is a good base recipe to which you can add additional soup, potatoes and seafood.

Warmed a cold winter night.  The family loved it, even the 5 yr olds!  I added 1/4c of sherry, a hint of worcestershire sauce and dash of white pepper.  For the adults we topped with a shake of cayenne pepper and fresh jalapenos.  Absolutely delicious.  Super easy to make.
