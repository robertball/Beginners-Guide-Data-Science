I actually ran the ham and the green onions together through my food processor to get the fine consistancy that I was looking for. I actually fried these in my cast iron skillet in a mixture of EVOO and butter. I did not try these myself but my husband and kids thought they were MONEY. NO leftovers. I think these would be excellent for breakfast as a substitute for hashbrowns with a side of sunny side up eggs and bacon. This recipe is SUCH a keeper--thumbs up from my family.

oh my goodness, avon!  these are DELICIOUS! i made them tonite for a snack. we didn't really have dinner. i had to stop myself after the fourth one, cuz someone else may want some! LOL. i had two cups of mashed taters, so i used them up. i did however forget to add the dill.  i have no explanation, so i look at it this way...another layer of flavour to look forward to the next time.  there will absolutely be a next time. oh, i opted not to fry and baked them at 375 deg for 45 min. turning them halfway. nice and crisp on the outside. YUM!  thanks for sharing with us Avon :) okay....update. i was very fortunate to have one leftover. i had it for breakfast the next morning with a fried over easy egg draped over top.  it was amazing. you have no idea. you must try this!!!!!

KEEPER ALERT!  These are super yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, measuring everything so I wouldn't fail.  I used my Pampered Chef food chopper to finely chop the ham.   I put the patties together in the morning, then refrigerated them until dinner time.  It made cooking dinner so easy.  I only had to fry them about 3 minutes on each side and they were done.  I served "Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce" from this site to accompany them along with a side of asparagus.  This is a real winner and will be served many times over at our house.  I just love having something new to make out of left-over ham.   The crunch is my favorite part, be sure to use "panko" crumbs.  Thank you Avon for sharing this SUPER YUMMY recipe---you rock!!

I thought these were 'good' but not 5 star.  I think I would have liked them better if they had more ham, less potatoes, but I would make them again as a side dish for breakfast with eggs and toast. I had a problem with mine breaking in the frying pan when I turned them. Maybe another egg would help?

When I first laid eyes on this recipe I knew I was going to make it. Definitely a keeper and I won’t wait for leftovers to make these again. I’ll go buy a small ham steak just to make these again. DW, who follows her Weight Watchers to a tee, threw caution to the wind and ate three of these. Now my only problem is which folder I will file it under in my recipe box. These Cake-ettes could be a main, a side or made smaller for appetizers and can be served at breakfast, lunch or dinner. If anyone is skeptical about the dill weed, fear not, it adds a depth of flavor without calling attention to itself. Thanks Avon.

Don't make my mistake!  I used instant mashed potatoes and got a gluey, soft, tasteless patty.  I added extra instant potato to the mix and put it in the fridge for an hour before frying thinking I was so smart.  Not so!

Fantastic recipe! I made these for hubby's birthday breakfast. He loved them. Great flavor and very easy to put together. Served these with fried eggs. Yummy! I put the ham in a food processor because I was being lazy and didn't want to do it by hand. Great way to use leftover ham and taters. Thanks for the recipe Avon :)

Anne, these are AMAZING! Seriously. I could not believe the flavor that came out of these few simple ingredients. Wonderful flavor, wonderful crunch and just downright delicious! I was planning to serve these w/ some sort of dipping sauce, but after tasting one, I decided that they didn't need anything. I also loved how these were all ingredients that I always have on hand...I think these would be great alongside some scrambled eggs or an omelet. These will definitely be making the rounds @ my house! Thanks for sharing. :)

Not sure if I did something wrong, being that so many other people had such great results. I followed the recipe exactly, but I used CountryCrock garlic mashed potatoes from the refrigerated section of the grocery store. They came out so mushy that they fell apart in the frying pan, and made such a mess. I think I will try these again, only with homemade leftover mashed potatoes.

nice new way to use up leftover ham! I omitted the salt and dill weed, personal preference, I didn't have green onions so I finely chopped an onion and sauteed until transluscent, used Italian bread crumbs because I was out of panko, added some Mrs Dash, served with salad, really good!

Tried this recipe to use up all the mashed potatoes leftover from Thanksgiving. Made without supstitutions. YUMMMY!!! The dijon and green onions play a key role in the flavors. Don't skip them they arent overpowering, just adds the depth that is needed. To get the small dice of ham I used my Pampered Chef food chopper. Perfect!

This was fantastic. I doubled the recipe and got 10 patties and had to fight so that I could even get one. Everyone in my family loved it. The girls and I had a fried egg on top and it was extra good. Highly recommended.
I cooked some chopped white onion in butter before adding to the mixture and left out the dill weed.

I had to read this one more time before reviewing because I was so sure I forgot the cheese. Nope, no cheese, and as much as my head told me it needed it, the flavor says it doesn't.  I had a fat slice of leftover ham (which looked to be about the right amount), made three medium red potatoes that ended up being a little more than asked for and baked these. The mustard aroma and flavor really come through and I thought the ratio of other ingredients was good for us. Obviously I didn't measure exactly but close and ended up with 4@ 4" and 6@ about 3".  I fried a leftover this morning with cooking spray and it was better than just baked so I can only imagine how much better these would be fried in oil. Maybe next time...

These were awesome! I made 2 changes. I omitted the green onions because I didn't have any. Next time I will definately add them because it will only make it better. Due to gluten-intolerance I used corn flake crumbs rather than panko.
These were perfectly seasoned and nicely crisp on the outside. The inside was smooth and had a wonderful texture. I will definately make these again soon!
*note: I think next time I may try using left over cheesy mashed potatoes. I think those would taste great too!

This is the best thing I have ever made with left over ham.  The kids loved that they could help make the patties.  Once cooked they didn't leave a crumb on their plates!

Here's another 5 star recommendation for these little yummies!  The requirements for the recipe are spot on perfect.  Please do make sure that your panko does not have extra ingredients added (there are so many new varieties) because otherwise you will want to adjust the salt factor.  Thanks for a perfect use of leftovers, Avon!

I don't like leaving such a negative review, but I followed this recipe exactly and we did NOT care for these at all.  They were bland and not what we expected.  Won't be making these again.  Sorry.

This was good tasting, I used the ham and some mini turkey pepperoni's (really good).  I doubled the ingredients (except the meat) because I had more mashed potatoes.  I used parsley in place of the dill and italian seasoned panko for the outside.  The dijon really gives these a nice flavor!  My only complaint is that they really soak up the vegetable oil so I had to use too much and they wanted to come apart easily while frying.  They need another binder I think, as I did use extra bread crumbs.  I ended up only frying about 6 of them because I ran out of oil. So I plopped the rest of the mix into a small casserole (over a layer of panko), topped it with cheddar cheese and more panko, and i'm gonna bake it till I think it's done at 400.   Ty for a yummy way to use left over mashed potatoes!

These are quite tasty.  Mixed them up early in the day and rolled them in the panko crumbs just before cooking.  Did not have Dijon but used Spicy Southwestern mustard instead, which was quite good.  Mixed a couple of tablespoons of butter with same of olive oil to fry and had to repeat amounts for second batch.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful way to use up the last remnants of that Easter ham!

This is so good. My husband who hates any kind of potatoes said he would eat it again! I didnt add any ham bc I was looking for a side for dinner and had leftover mashed potatoes so decided to do this. Used herbed panko crumbs so didnt add any salt or dried dill. I cant wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow for breakfast!

Served this as an emergency dinner when hungry "orphans" showed up to eat.  Everyone absolutely loved these - so  much so that I ended only nabbing one.  We'll certainly make these again.  What a great use of leftovers.  My thanks.

Very good. Next time I would add 1 more egg for better binding and a 1/4 clove of minced garlic for taste.  Maybe 2 green onion instead of 3. Also should let mixture sit in fridge for 30 min prior to making I to patties and fry immediately.

Very good; close match to a crab cake recipe I used to make (swap ham for crab and you're there), but my kids don't like crab... this made everyone happy.  Like others, I put the ham & onions through the food processor before mixing in.  I also adapted mine to be gluten-free (allergies) by swapping the breadcrumbs out for a combo of pre-packaged GF "breadcrumbs", almond meal, and pinch of corn meal, used only on the outside for the fried crisp texture.

Just tried this recipe three times with left over flavor-packed buttermilk garlic mashed potatoes from last night's dinner. The first time I substituted finely chopped onion for the scallions and learned that the potato mixture definitely needs additional panko.  The second time I removed the dried dill, because I thought it clashed and suggested there would be a seafood ingredient in the mix (think crab cake.)  Third time was the charm; I did a quick pan-fry with the ham and onions before adding to the dill-free potato mixture. The flavor of the onion and ham were fantastic and added much needed golden color to the insides of the potato cakes.

This is a wonderful way to repurpose left over mashed potatoes!  Very easy to make and great flavor!  I did the same as Sarah Joe and ran the ham and green onion through the food processor.  I also omitted the egg (personal preference) and did not have any issues with the mixture being too crumbly.  Great recipe, Avon!!  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe.   I did use regular chopped onions instead of green onions.   While eating them we discussed many uses and varieties that could be done with this recipe.   They would be good as part of a breakfast menu, or layered into a casserole dish and topped with panko and then baked for a healthier and faster version, or just simply mashed potatoes without the panko.   I will make again in some fashion.   Thanks!

I just happened to have some leftover diced ham and mashed potatoes in the frig when I stumbled upon this recipe in the Most Recent Reviews and decided to give it a try for breakfast.  The only thing I didn't have was green onion, so I subbed some dried minced and I always use yellow mustard in lieu of dijon per personal preference.  I elected to heat a pat of butter on a griddle instead of the 1/2 C of oil and had no issues w/breakage.  While these won't replace my leftover mashed potato go to ("Scottish Bubble and Squeak" from this site), they will be a way to use leftover ham and mashed potatoes for a delicious breakfast!  THANKS for the recipe, Avon!

had no dijon so I just used regular mustard...also was short on panko so I also used Italian bread crumbs....didn't use any salt as I thought the ham was salty enough on it's own....I will definitely use this recipe again    ....Linda Wojick

Very tasty.  Made as directed.  The first batch of 4 were very crumbly and broke apart when removing.  2nd batch of 4 were fine.
I will add another egg next time and maybe more panko mixed in. I will definitely try to make this again.

This was really great. I had ham left over from Easter and I love savory cakes, like the perfect size and great to take on the road. They tasted perfect, I did not make a change. But I will chop up the ham a bit smaller to make the cakes stay together through the cooking process. I will make these again. And I did use the mayo/mustard sauce, which is a perfect match.

Found a little dry and heavy. Next time will make with a mashed potato and acorn squash mixture for more creamy and less dense. Also, I used the George Forman grill instead of oil. Liked the outcome, but will crust the outside with cornmeal instead of Panko next time.

I've had this recipe saved for a very long time.  I had some leftover smoked ham and we've been eating too much soup lately, so - BINGO!   Gotta try this, and I'm so glad I did.  I didn't have any leftover mashed potatoes so I quickly whipped some up.  Because the ham was smoked, I used Country Dijon mustard.  I used my mini-chopper for the ham and green onions since I'd already sliced my finger 2 days before (ahem, never mind....) . The flavors blended perfectly.  Even though I formed the patties and refrigerated for an hour, they were still a little loose, my fault, not the recipe's.  One less pulse in the chopper should cure that next time :)  Hubs came home late from a meeting so I left the pan out for him with instructions to reheat.  The next morning he said, "What was that you made last night?  They were REALLY good!"  An absolute keeper that I'll definitely make again.  I really want to try them for breakfast with a fried egg on top - oh YUM!  Thank you, Avon, for a delicious and simple recipe using leftovers!!

Leave the ham in small chunks/diced. I used a food processor and it was too fine/hard to taste ham--did increase ham by 1/2 cup.  Taste was alright, followed the recipe except extra ham. Probably won't make again.

My Husband loved these - I used diced ham, mashed leftover scalloped potatoes, some grated cheddar, green onion, a little parmesan, a little diced pineapple, and panko bread crumbs.  I mixed it all together, dipped the patties in panko crumbs and pan fried it in half veg. oil and half butter, just enough to brown them in.  It was very flavourful.  We would eat these again.

Made these for breakfast after thanksgiving with the left over mashed potatoes. I don't have ham or green onion (but they would have been even better if I had!). Used panko Italian style breadcrumbs because it's what I had on hand. These were so good!!! My sweetheart loved them! Delicious! Thank you. Looking forward to thanksgiving this coming year. Will have to make sure I have green onions and ham this time!

I followed the recipe for the most part.  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used honey mustard and about 1/4 tsp. horseradish.  It was a good call as it added a tiny bit of a bite.  Next time I will do the same, but add only about 1/8 tsp.  Also, I baked them instead of fry.  The were nice and crunchy.  I would definitely bake them again.  Next time I may try adding a little bit of shredded cheese to the mix as well......

This recipe is perfect!  What a great way to use Christmas dinner leftover ham and mashed potatoes. I left out the salt as the potatoes were cooked in salted water--the saltiness was just right. As suggested by one reader, I cooked them in butter and olive oil in the cast iron frying pan...perfect and looked just like the photo. Thanks for posting such a great recipe.

So happy I did this recipe! I am not a big fan of ham or Dijon mustard but hubby is and I had a small amount of ham leftover and was looking for something different. These are absolutely fantastic! I used my slap chopper to get the ham the right consistency and added the whole bunch of green onions (about 6). The panko breadcrumbs give these a nice crunch. Held together perfectly and fried up quickly. I will be definitely do these again. Thanks for posting.

Very happy to have come across this recipe! I made a half batch to try it, and they came out excellent! I still used the 1 egg, and the mixture was a little loose, so just added more crumbs to compensate. The creaminess of the mashed potato mixture and the crunch of the outside Panko crumbs was a match made in heaven! If you want a more pronounced onion flavor, I can see using regular onions. Nice for a quick lunch, as I had it, or for breakfast, as others have mentioned. What a great way to use leftovers from Easter dinner, too! Thanks Avon!

Perfect use of leftovers. We enjoyed these so much for lunch today and they were super easy to throw together.

Made this tonight with leftwver ham (frozen in freezer) from Thanksgiving, and newly-made mashed potatoes. Used everything but the dill, and tasted fantastic. Only 1 out of 8 cakes were leftover for tomorrow's lunch. Very good!!

This was a VERY good recipe!  Great way to use the leftover ham and mashed potatoes from Christmas.  Didn't have green onions, so used a finely chopped yellow onion that I didn't even cook first!  Big hit at our house!

Serve with melted cheddar cheese over to make a little more moist. I had mine with sriracha sauce, yum!

This is the best recipe for leftover ham I have ever tasted. My family said we should skip the main ham meal next time and go straight to this recipe. I am not a great cook and yet had no trouble achieving a good result with this recipe. I agree with another reviewer who said that she could not believe the flavor that came out of these few simple ingredients. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Loved these cakes.  They did fall apart on me so I will probably add another egg and maybe a few more bread crumbs the next time. But the flavor is awesome!

My favorite aspect of these was the crunch of the panko.  I ran the ham through my food processor, which I would recommend, though I still needed an extra egg to hold the cakes together.  The Dijon came through nicely though the predominant flavor was the potato and these seemed like very good hash browns.  I made these for a dinner main dish and it made 2 servings.  Next time I'll make these for breakfast and add more ham.

What a WONDERFUL way to use up leftover ham and mashed potatoes.  I’ll admit to not having leftover potatoes, so I had to make some up and cool them for this recipe.  I made a batch and a half so that I would have leftovers.  Nope, no leftovers, my family LOVED them and ate them all in one sitting.  I made as written, but used coconut oil to fry them in.  I was surprised that they take quite a bit of oil.  I served this with ‘Mustard Mayonnaise Sauce’ another AR recipe that SHORECOOK suggested.  It was the perfect topping for these cake-ettes.  Thanks Avon for sharing your recipe!  I will be making this again.  This would also be great as a breakfast item served with over-easy eggs.
