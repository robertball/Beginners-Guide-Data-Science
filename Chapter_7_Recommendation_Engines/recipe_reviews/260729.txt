These were so easy to make and had a ton of flavor considering you used so little ingredients.  I would definitely make these again.  I do think they were better hot or slightly warm. Make sure you use a serrated knife to cut .

I added slices of honey ham and it turned out great.  I will make it again.

Easy to make!  Great taste!  Love the gooey cheese!  Love the creaminess of the puff pastry!   Just ate it for New Year's Day celebration.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!
