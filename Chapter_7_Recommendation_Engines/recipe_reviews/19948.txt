This was very good. I chilled it overnight. My husband and I both enjoyed it. I will make it again.

I have made this now 3 times because it is so good. I use Barilla plus whole wheat pasta and have made it twice with canned tuna also.  You can also use whatever vegestables you have on hand.  Today I used peas instead of corn.  Very yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt at a pasta salad, and it turned out to be easy and delicious! I actually made a very simplified version, using only the pasta, mayo, and Italian dressing and throwing in some celery and tomatoes, and it was still very tasty. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a pretty tasty summer noodle salad.  I found I liked the taste more after it "sat" in the refer for a few hours.  Simple, tasty and good as written. Thanks lil one! Would make again.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I will definitely make it again.  It is easy to vary the ingredients depending on what you like or have on hand.  The dressing is terrific for plain veggies.  I served it on diced cucumbers, mushrooms and tomatoes and it was a big hit!  The mayo-italian dressing combo is simple and has just the right amount of tang!

I made this for a picnic with my girlfriend, I fried chicken and seasoned it, rather than the cubes. Then I proposed, she said yes, and that it was the greatest pasta salad she's ever had. To be fair, the proposal sweetened it up... But still... Very delicious.

I thought this tasted allright. It kind of reminded me of a creamy version of spaghetti salad, with a lot more stuff in it. I added all the ingredients, but did a small chop. I even sliced the pre-sliced mushrooms even further. The calories seemed kind of high, so I used lite mayo and Italian dressing and reduced fat cheese. The green olives do though have a very prominent taste. Anyone who does not like olives would not care for that. The Italian dressing, I felt, also made it a little tart.  For the chicken in a can, which I don't care for, I boiled 1 lb of chicken tenderloins in some broth and chopped it small and it worked fine.

this is an excellent summer meal and super easy to make.  One change I made was to substitute the canned chicken with 2 boneless skinless fresh chicken breasts, cooked and cut into pieces.

I omitted the olives and peppers because I didn't have them and added a shredded carrot. This was pretty good, but I agree that it's even better after having been in the fridge overnight.

So simple, so very tasty.  Everyone loved it.  I made it with our leftover rotisserie chicken cut up.  Definitely needs to chill for a long time as recipe states.  I recommend this pasta salad recipe.

Great summertime salad with native corn on the cob. I used fresh chicken and a cup of frozen mixed vegetables. I added a couple of Mini Cucumbers instead of green pepper.
