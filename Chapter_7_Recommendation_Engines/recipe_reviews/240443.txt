These were very nice and the recipe made nice sized muffins. I am a coco"nut" so next time I will add a bit more coconut for me and a few more chocolate chips for the chocoholic in the house. But they were very good without any changes. Thanks for sharing!

While making the recipe I realized there was no mention of the almond extract in the directions so I added it while whisking the wet ingredients. I used a full cup of sugar in this recipe and increased the coconut content to 1.5 cups. These came out great at exactly the prescribed amount of time.

These are very good. I follow the recipe as stated with the exception of using 1 tsp of coconut extract (Olive Nation.com) instead of almond and using 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of stevia and they're very tasty muffins with or without the chocolate.

I adjusted the recipe for 9 muffins but still got 12. I filled the cups 3/4 full. I didn't add the chips don't think they need it I might add Craisins. Plan to toast the coconut and increase the almond extract next time. Will definitely make again!

I used mayonnaise instead of sour cream, simply because I was out of sour cream. Also used 1 cup of sugar instead of sugar and stevia mix. 
Turned out great!

I did not have Stevia so I just left it out and they are plenty sweet. Also the recipe does not mention when to add the flavoring so I just put it in with the other wet ingredients. I made them using "jumbo" muffin cups and got a dozen.

Tasty! I didn't have almond extract so I substituted almond meal for half the flour. And I only had 1/3 of the sour cream called for so I used coconut milk for the rest. Turned out great!

Tired of people putting specialty ingredients in the recipes. I live in the middle east and can't find Stevia anywhere. And trying to find conversions for this are all over the place. I had 1/4 cup of Stevia being equal to anywhere between 1/2 cup to 2 cups of sugar. Another minor thing - almond extract in the list of ingredients but not in the directions. Almost forgot it.
