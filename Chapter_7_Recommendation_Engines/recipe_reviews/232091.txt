I always have a lot of zucchini come August so I was looking for a new recipe to use it up. I tried this recipe and liked it. It makes a soft cookie with a crisp edge. It's not my favorite recipe but it is good and a good way to use up that zucchini. Update: I made this recipe a second time. I was a half cup short on flour so I substituted a half cup of oatmeal. It made for a firmer chewier cookie. I like the modification and this cookie is quickly becoming a fall favorite.

I loved these! a great use for zucchini. 
I did press the grated zucchini to get as much liquid out as possible, as I noticed another reviewer mention that the cookies were flat . It seemed to help abit

I omitted the raisins and coconut. I doubled the chocolate chips and cinnamon. I also squeezed out most of the moisture from the shredded zucchini to make sure they didn't get too watery and flat. Boyfriend and kid-approved.

I made just a couple of changes to this.  I used Splenda instead of white sugar and discovered I didn't have either choc chips or raisins.  

I substituted white choc for the milk choc and used craisins  instead.  It worked out well.  Family is gobbling them up.  Thank goodness my zucchini plants (2) are producing so much.

I don't like nuts in cookies and I changed the raisins to dried berries and dried Michigan cherries! My family likes dark chocolate chips and begged me to make sure I remember this recipe! They loved them ranging in age from 25 to 90!

I thought they were a good use of zucchini. It was a quick, easy  recipe but there is a lot going to with the nuts, coconut, raisins, and chocolate chips. I might leave out the coconut next time since you cant' really taste it.

The flavor of the cookies is wonderful but they were flat as a pancake. I tried chilling the dough, cooking them a shorter time, and not greasing the pans. Still flat. Did they need more flour?
