Totally excellent. I'd soo make this in a heart-beat again! It is on the thin side for us, but the flavor was really good. I'll be replacing the milk with heavy cream the next go around. The recipe was very easy to follow, easy with the instructions and I didn't feel it was at all time consuming. Totally Totally a keeper!

I found this recipe really tasty, even tho I did have to do several substitutions because I decided to try this on a whim (Chicken broth for oyster juice... still works great).  I added more seasonings too such as basil and tarragon and a dash of cayenne. Also used tilapia and cod.  Served with a tortilla, yum!

This recipe is awesome. Being originally from New England, I know a good fish chowder when I taste it....and this is it. I have been looking for a chowder recipe that tasted authentic. This is it. The only changes I made were to use heavy cream instead of the milk, and I added a can of cream style corn. Absolutely delicious. Thanks so much for sharing.

Really good! Didn't have clam juice, so subbed with chicken boullion. Also used schucked, frozen clams and the juice from them. Didn't have much celery, so added a pinch of  celery salt in place of regular salt. It's cooking now,and smells amazing! Will probably whisk in a bit of cornstarch to thicken. So far the taste test is great!

This was a delicious chowder that everyone loved! We had some breaded cod fillets (about a pound) leftover from dinner that we decided to use for this recipe. I didn't have clam juice so I used 3 cans of chopped clams instead. I didn't have whole milk so I used heavy cream and some water and added about 1/3 cup flour to thicken the chowder. Also added about 5 strips of cooked bacon chopped up. Super delicious!! Thanks for a great recipe! We will definitely make this one again!

Just had fish chowder while visiting Nova Scotia and wanted to duplicate it.  This recipe was wonderful and I will be making it again, just as written.

This was the first time I can remember that the whole family liked a meal with no complaints at all. I did make a couple of minor changes. Instead of cod I used fish I caught myself (rock bass and small mouth bass) and instead of clam juice I used fish stock I made by boiling the heads of the fish then removing them and topped it up with salt water. I added 2 carrots, diced, and instead of whole milk I used 2% lactose free milk.

Good basic soup. I also added carrots. I was a little worried it wouldn't be flavorful enough, so I added ground white pepper at the end. Will make again

It was okay. Not very flavorful. My family didn't like it.

I made this recipe with a few substitutions. I used an extra onion, chicken bouillon instead of clam juice because I didn't have any clam juice and Penzeys Old World seasoning in addition to the bay leaf and thyme. I had Rockfish I wanted to use up which prompted me looking for a recipe. I blended several but this is the closest to what I made. I used low fat evaporated milk instead of whole milk. For my taste, it needs a little more seasoning, so I will add a little more Old World seasoning, I think. It has a nice rich but fresh taste.

This turned out great for us. I didnâ€™t have clam juice, so I threw a can of smoked oysters in at the potato stage. That gave it a good, rich, sea flavor. Added an extra tbls of flour too to make sure it was thick.

I used 3/4 of a pound of red fish, which I was told is ocean perch. I used  1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. It was a quick and easy recipe to make and the result was delicious.  I would make this again and try other types of fish too. It was my first attempt at fish chowder.

Very nice on a cold day.  I omit the clam juice as I find that too fishy.  I used chicken broth and added cooked cabbage and lots of your favourite seasonings.

It is delicious!! I used whole milk and used a cup and a half, so I also added a quarter cup cold water mixed with an extra T flour. I had some pollack and whiting in the freezer and I cubed them(while frozen-yikes!) and put them in frozen. It took maybe ten minutes to cook through. I also doubled the butter, just because.  Sooo good! And a great way to use up my frozen fish.  It's a winner!! Next time I might use a little cream!

Very tasty. I added a bit of corn, which worked well. But it doesn't need it.

Ok, I usually stick to the recipe so I can rate it truthly and this is it.  Don't get me wrong it had some flavor, but a little flat for my taste. However, after I ate a bowl, or two I then added a a tsp of Old Bay to the pot and that really raised it to a 4 and then the next day after sitting, it was Wonderful.  So next time, I'll add that Old Bay, you can adjust to your buds.

Easy and tasty for my first attempt at fish chowder.  I used chicken stock in place of water and added carrots and Old Bay seasoning.

So I added carrots and subbed half and half for milk and upped the amount to make it thicker and creamier
