This recipe was EXCELLENT! I made it as an appetizer for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. Based on a previous review I added some mild shredded cheese (2-3 handfuls). One thing I did different was I diced and seasoned chicken breasts and cooked them in the pot before cooking the vegetables. I honestly think that's one element that made it so good.

This was so good. I added a handful of shredded cheese while cooking. Then added asprinkle on top when served. So glad I doubled the batch for 4 of us. There will barely be enough leftover!!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts & just allowed it to cook in the broth. I also used half almond milk & half chicken broth & thickened it with 4 ounces of cream cheese (I use fat-free). I used California mix & added a good bit of salt. I also added brown rice. Overall, this was a really great base recipe, but I always alter things either due to personal taste or food allergies. The seasonings were great, & the cheddar cheese before serving is a must!

I liked the buttery, creamy taste of this soup!  I used more veggies than just broccoli - I had some frozen peas, carrots, onion, and a small amount of frozen peppers to use up.  Also, I used "better than bouillion".  Quick, easy meal that I will make again!

I added some processed cheese like Velveeta and a little garlic powder. Very good and creamy on a cold winter night.

Absolutely loved this soup! I put in extra of the veggies; used a combination of milk, oat milk, and half and half; and put in extra Worcester sauce. Oh, and I used rotisserie chicken from Costco. So delicious!

So delicious! Made exactly as written. Used baby Bella mushrooms and rotisserie chicken from the store. Went with a can of fat free evaporated milk instead of cream and 1% milk for the rest. Will make this again and again!

We are a gluten-free family, so I did not put in the flour. This soup was yummy served with fresh ground pepper on top. My daughter added parmesan cheese to her serving. That was another interesting flavor combination.

Quick and easy. I added 1 cup mozzarella cheese while cooking. Comfort with a loaf of fresh bread out of the oven.

weirdly, this recipe has no salt listed, and i ended up adding at least a tablespoon. also subbed a cup of cheese for the cream, and made my own stock, and used that with the addition of 2 cups milk. threw in garlic and a frozen green pepper i had. I held back on adding the broccoli to the reux, and added it with the liquids. So this really ended up being a skeleton to the soup i made, but the end product is delicious.

This soup was great!  I made some changes based on what we had on hand.  I used frozen broccoli and cauliflower.  I didn't have any milk so I upped the chicken broth. I didn't have the granules so I used two Maggi chicken broth boullion rectangles.  I used heavy whipping cream and added cayenne pepper to give more depth.  I followed the rest of the directions and added grated cheddar as I served it.  Family loved it!

If you can find it, use "Better Than Bullion" soup base. I, personally and from my family's opinion (I've made it both ways), it tastes so much better. This is a wonderful recipe and even my coworkers loved it.

Fabulous. I made it in my instapot. So easy. Wonderfully filling served with crusty bread. I saw some added cheese but it is rich and creamy and I don't think it needs the extra cheese.

Good solid easy to make down home food.  More of a  chowder-like thickness than soup -like to me and somewhat on the bland side.  Added a couple tsp of cajun seasoning and a bit of garlic salt.  Enjoyable, but wouldn't make again.

This was soooo easy to make and my husband loved it! I will definitely make it again. I didn't have any cream so I just added a bit more milk and butter (don't know exactly how much). So yummy.

I made this soup last night. This was a trial recipe. My family after a few bites said this a redo.Meaning I can remake anytime. The only substitute was leftover chicken.

Tasteful recipe with full of nice ingredients. I added a bit more milk, because the soup turned out a bit too thick for my taste. I replaced the chicken cubes with fresh grilled chicken which made this recipe a keeper.

Excellent! My very picky husband loved it. I doubled the recipe and added 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Also used onion powder instead of the onion because he does not like onion. I will definitely be doing this recipe again.
