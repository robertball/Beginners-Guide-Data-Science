This was an amazing drink recipe.  One of the best my mom and I have had in a long time.  We traditionally have a cocktail hour, which is usually a chocolate martini or apple.  But this one will be added to the list.  I may use less grenadine next time to let the vodka cut through some more.  We also used Cranberry Black Cherry juice instead, which was like we mixed two of the most popular cheesecakes toppings and mixing them together!!!  Will keep this one in the pocket of tricks!  Thanks!

My only suggestion is to add 1 oz of Grand Marnier or Tripple sec. It makes a more balanced martini. Most martini's need it to balance the sugar so it is not too sweet and the vodka is not too strong.

Made a jug of this at my party and set out with ice and glasses on the side.  Yup, tastes just like strawberry cheesecake.  I had 3 jugs of different martini's and this one was the least popular as it is a bit on the sweet side.  Had to keep the teenagers away from it.  :)

I did not care for this drink.  To me it did not taste like cheesecake at all.

This was just okay. Really overpoweringly sweet. And not really strawberry tasting, either.

I bet this would be more like a cheesecake martini with some vanilla schnapps and a little half-n-half. This is more like a cherry.

I don't think it's the worst, but not very good.  I'm sorry, but I have to agree that it has a bit of a cough syrup taste.
