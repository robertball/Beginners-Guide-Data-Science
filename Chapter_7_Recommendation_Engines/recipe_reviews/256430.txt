I am not a fan of fruit cakes but i made this with only 1 cup of sugar no cloves I replaced prune juice with the boiling water that I soaked the prunes in I also skipped the sauce and it turned out heavenly moist soft and with chewy prune bits next time i'll be using half a cup of sugar as the sweetness of the prunes was very obvious thank you for this great recipe!

Delicious recipe! Prunes gets such a bad rap but when they re baked in a cake they become this gooey melted deliciousness. This cake is comfort food at its best. My boyfriend and I gobbled it up!

Love this recipe. I always use at least 1.5 C. whole wheat flour and 1C. organic all purpose white flour 1 C. Stevia and 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 T. Cinnamon 1/2 T. Nutmeg to make it spicier and a healthier. Rarely make the topping and use Vanilla spiced whipped cream or Cool Whip on top. Delicious!
