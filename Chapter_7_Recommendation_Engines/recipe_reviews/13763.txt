This was too simple for words! Tasty too! I don't always care for the taste of eggs so I gave this a try just to see if it would make a good banana pudding. It made an excellent, and fast banana pudding.This pudding, a few vanilla wafers and a couple of sliced bananas and life is good. Thanks for sharing an easy recipe!

This has to be one of the simplest recipes I have come across. It takes about 10 mins from start to finish.  The texture smooth and creamy. The reviewers who say it is bland intrigue me, what do you think vanilla pudding is going to taste like? If you want a stronger taste use a different essence, I have made them with almond essence and toasted almonds and also tried mixing 2-1/2 tsp of coffee with 1-1/2tsp of water in place of essence and they have all come out beautifully.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe it is a definite favourite.

This recipe is just what I was looking for.  A light dessert recipe that's very easy to prepare. If you can make gravy from a packet you will have no problem with this recipe. Set up very quickly too (30 min.) for a nice mold.

This is the same recipe I've used for years, so I can vouch for it.  You can add nearly any flavoring, including cocoa, (up to 1/4 cup).

 It's also a good base for many kinds of fruit (I use the fruit water with dry milk, instead of plain milk).
I usually don't continue to let it cook after adding the vanilla...probably just from habit.

This recipe came out pretty good.  I added a bit of cocoa, as the vanilla was just a bit bland for me, but the consistency was right on.  I think I might try it with bananas or use brown sugar for 1/2 of the recipe net time.

This is such a wonderful, simple vanilla pudding. Try it hot on a chilly day, it's the ultimate comfort food! I mix all the dry ingredients first, then whisk in the milk until everything is well blended before I start cooking the pudding, it turns out perfect every time!

I really like the taste of this pudding, however I could not get it to thicken. While stirring I allowed the mixture to boil for quite some time, and still it did not thicken. I added about 2Tbls more starch, but by then the milk was already forming a lot of skin. It finally thickened with the extra starch, but the pudding is full of milk skin chunks. Should I tell my roomates it's tapioca?

I really liked this recipe for a base for other puddings and pies. I quadruppled this recipe and added 1 and a half cups of peanut butter and I made pies with it. I turned put perfectly.

If what you want is a nice, easy vanilla pudding, this is it! I did, however, use only 1/4 cup sugar (actually, 2 Tbsps splenda and 2 Tbsps sugar) as I usually like things less sweet. It turned out perfect. My daughter thought it tasted just like the cooked packaged vanilla pudding (didn't notice the splenda at all) which she really likes.

Easy recipe, very good pudding. A good recipe to keep in your back pocket since most have all these ingredients at any given time. I read the bad reviews and saw many were complaining that it'd burnt, disliked its foamy texture, etc, which all scream 'user error,' not the recipe. A few mentioned it not setting up, but I followed this recipe exactly using 2% milk, refrigerated it for 2 hours in serving-size small bowls, and it set up perfectly smooth, creamy, and exactly as pudding should. My kids loved it.

My fiance and dad liked it a lot just as it was. I mixed in some crumbled chocholate cupcake in mine and it tastes like an oreo cookie! As earlier reviews commented, it sets up quickly. However, it takes a while to chill completely. Staying in my recipe box.

Lovely, simple, quick and satisfying. Easy to modify, and easy to fix problems. For example, I had to use an extra teaspoon of flour when I realized it wasn't thickening properly, but right after that the pudding behaved! It's cooing right now, I can't wait to eat it. (:

This turned out more of a mousse than a pudding; a little on the foamy side.  I used powdered vanilla flavoring rather than liquid, and I ended up using a total of 1 1/2 Tbsp. of that.  I don't know how it's going to set up, but at the moment it's still really soft, more like a pastry cream than a pudding.  Flavor-wise, it's very good.  It would make a good base for stovetop rice pudding.

This was quite bland, and I found the consistancy too runny. I just couldn't get it to thicken quite right. I thought chilling it over night might help, but no. Next time I'll try more corn starch and maybe a little nutmeg.

Ehh. I doubled the vanilla, but still pretty flavorless. Maybe a tablespoon or so of butter would have helped, or maybe more sugar, but it does need something!! I liked that it was easy to make, and eggless.

I was stirring it, and the mixture was burnt onto the pan, it made burnt flakes come up into it.  We tasted it anyway, the flavor (minus the burnt flakes) was fine.

This is a very good recipe.  I did alter it to fit my needs.  I used it for filling for a cake so I needed it to be thicker.  I doubled the recipe and cut the milk down to 3 cups.  I also used splenda to make it sugar free. PERFECT!!

Exactly what I was looking for--a simple, light, eggless pudding.  After my son had gum surgery, I was looking for something soft and a little bit sweet that would give him some nutrition, too, and this pudding worked well; I added some extra nonfat dry milk powder to increase the protein and calcium.  He loved this pudding, even declared it "fascinating!"

I'm giving 5 stars for taste, but I would only give about 3 stars for consistency.  After reading other reviews, I was prepared for thin consistency, but what I found what egg white consistency.  This wasn't very appealing to my 7 and 4 year olds.  I added fresh ground nutmeg and a little extra vanilla.  The taste was outstanding, the consistency was not something I would serve.

I was in a pinch for vanilla pudding for my husband's banana pudding. I had never made homemade pudding before. I found this one and hoped it would work. I loved it. I doubled the recipe and added a stick of butter with the milk. I came out perfect. I will be using this again as the only recipe for my hubby's banana pudding!

I've  been  using  this  recipe  since  I  was  a  teenager  and it never fails . I add a tablespoon  of butter in mine. It's great  for  banana  pudding  but you'please probably  need  to  double  the  recipe  in order to  have  enough  to  spread  over the vanilla  wafers and sliced bananas. My hubby loves it so much  that he doesn't  want  me  to ever use  the  instant  pudding, like he grew up eating.

I thought this was ok. I used good flavoring so it had good flavor. The texture was a little lackluster though. It was probably as good as a pudding without eggs or butter can be. I used it to make trifle with fresh bananas and banana cake. While we enjoyed the dessert, I doubt I would make this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I normally don't review recipes, but this is an AMAZING recipe! I am not a huge fan of vanilla pudding, but I am using it for a filling and this was the highest rated recipe. I am so very glad a tried it! I was licking the spoon and eating out of the saucepan! 

I had no problem with lumps, but I did take the advice of the other reviews and mixed the dry ingredients well before heating.
I WILL be making this again and trying other flavors with the base ingredients! So long JELL-O! Thank you so much Bluebayou!

This was easy and delicious. Did not burn like other homemade puddings have. 
After making it and letting it sit in the fridge, I layered it with homemade whip cream and crushed graham crackers and banana slices in a cup for dessert. It was very good!

This is definitely better the next day - the flavor, the set.  I like that there are no eggs.  As in all my cooking, I use skim milk powder and water, so I was thinking I'll make up small batches to which I'll only have to add water and the extract to get a pudding that is every bit as good as the boxed variety.  I still prefer Bird's or Edmund's Custard Powder but this recipe would be a handy replacement.

I've been making a vanilla pudding with egg in it, and it was good, but something just wasn't quite right. I made this one and wow! It was delicious. It's extremely important to use a good quality vanilla, as this gives it all the flavor. I also buy organic whole milk especially for making pudding. This pudding had a good consistency and excellent, pure flavor. Thank you for this recipe!

Excellent and easy!!!  I was a little skeptical about this recipe because it has no egg in it but I needed a pudding in a pince.  It was quick, easy, and delicious!  It made a wonderful banana cream pie.  thanks for posting.  This will be my go to pudding!

The taste was ok, but this pudding didn't thicken at all, even after adding more cornstarch. I'll never make it again.

I think that this is a good basic no egg recipe.  You can use different types of milk (as I did), different flavors (as I did) and alter the cornstarch to get the preferred consistency desired (however, I wouldn't use more cornstarch because you will start to taste it).  Thank you, I needed a nice no egg recipe for pudding.

To thicken the pudding, I heated it over high, turning it to medium and cooking for two minutes while stirring constantly. it thickened nicely after an hour in the fridge. However, even after doubling the vanilla, the flavor was extremely bland. It did not taste like vanilla pudding.

This is so easy and quick to put together with the perfect amount of sweetness.  I used vanilla paste just because I like to see the specks of  vanilla in the pudding.  It was yummy.  I wish it had set up a little tighter than it did, but it still held up to the fruit I used as a topping.

I’ve made this recipe for years and find it versatile, easy, and delicious. For those who thought it was bland, might you be using cheaper vanilla? Double up if so. I’ve also noticed that old cornstarch sometimes doesn’t set up well. Make sure it’s fresh.

This isn't packaged pudding! So easy. Just remember that the heat shouldn't be too high or the bottom will burn. Don't expect the taste and consistency of packaged pudding. It is a little thinner. Definitely a keeper.

It tastes like the milk after you've eaten your sweet cereal out of it. It's a nice flavor, but it doesn't really taste like vanilla pudding.

Tastes like cook and serve pudding from the package. I'm going to be trying out some flavor combos to make some quick pies.

Did somebody omit the eggs from this recipe because it never thickened?  AFTER adding 2 egg yolks, it finally started to thicken to a pudding consistency.  Maybe I missed it in the write up but I didn't see eggs added.  Without it, you'll end up w/ a white sauce that taste like vanilla.

I added some cinnamon and it was tasty. Had some trouble getting the cornstarch to thicken and had to add more. Would remake and modify a few things.

The taste is great and it's perfectly sweet but the texture is what you'd expect from homemade pudding, a bit lumpy.

Excellent! I can't give this five stars only because I made this at my boyfriend's place, his kitchen is severely under stocked and I therefore had to fudge a lot of the recipe. But what I did get out of this recipe was excellent. Easy, tasty, firmed up nicely and quickly. Only made about a cup and a half, just to cover a vanilla poke cake because we had no icing.

At my grandma's request, I added an egg the second time I made this. Much better that way. Oh... and I only boil for exactly one minute.  As soon as the mixture begins to boil while you're stirring, start your timer. It will be a little thin when you remove from heat but--have faith--it will thicken as it cools.

this recipe is practically fool-proof and only takes a few minutes to prepare - oh yeah and i didn't have to shop for anything - these are ingredients we normally keep in the house.  i made it without salt and i used splenda instead of sugar and it still came out delicious!  can't wait to taste how it turns out after it's chilled!  i'll try to remember to post again and when it's done to let you all know how it turned out

I added a pinch of cinnamon, since cinnamon brings out the flavour of vanilla. It thickened just fine. I think for people that it doesn't thicken for, they need to cook longer and lower temperature and although it says to stir constantly, I find it thickens better if you let it sit a bit, but the temperature has to be low enough that it doesn't burn or coddle. Made mine with Splenda as we have to watch sugar in our household.

I made (2) recipes. (1) vanilla, (1) chocolate
(1/4 cup cocoa).  Very easy to make (no eggs, no oil). Will definitely use this again as my pie base(s). Well done! Thx, for sharing!

This was my first time making a eggless pudding, so I probably had incorrect expectations. I found the texture odd, as it didn't remain creamy as it cooled. I used it for banana pudding (ran out of eggs and was looking for an option), and the pudding layer is "solid". The flavor was good, though. I added almond extract and a splash of bourbon with the vanilla. Now that I now what to expect, I'd make this again, maybe for a kids dessert with some fruit compote or something on top. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I just made this and it turned out great! One thing I did differently to help it thicken was to cook the original recipe until it was hot enough to boil.  I held it at just under boiling for about 4 minutes.  Then I slowly poured in a mixture of 2T milk and 1T of cornstarch that had been mixed well to take the lumps out.  Within 45 seconds of pouring this in, it began to thicken quickly.  I turned the heat down a little to slow the thickening down so the cornstarch would cook into the pudding.  Within 2 minutes, it was finished.  There is no cornstarch taste, but a wonderful vanilla taste.  Remember, you are making this from scratch...it takes a little patience to get it thick, but so worth it!!!

I've made this recipe twice, once as is and once chocolate by substituting 1/4 cup cocoa for the vanilla. Both were wonderful and easy. It's also good warm, so no need to chill if you like warm pudding. I will never buy boxed mix again!

Very simple to make and has a nice taste. This was good on its own with a dash more vanilla but also makes a good base for other flavours such as chocolate or banana, to use as a pie filling, or to top with chocolate, sliced fruit, etc..

This was yummy. I had some milk that was getting ready to go bad and this was a great use for it. I made as stated and added the vanilla and it didn't seem to be enough so I more than doubled it just to get the vanilla flavor I was looking for. Will be making again

I'm giving this 3 stars because it didn't fully thicken.

I added 1 drop of yellow food coloring so it can have that yellow color that vanilla pudding has.

 Even though it taste pretty good,  I'm going to try another recipe to see if that one will thicken up.

This is my first attempt at making pudding NOT out of a box.  It turned out wonderfully.  Had a great texture, and was pretty.  However, I use pure vanilla, and the alcohol taste was strong.  It was the first thing my hubby said.  Other than that it was great.  I can't wait to try it with a bit less vanilla, and add other flavors.....maybe pie filling stired in??

This turned out quite nicely. In the end, I used whole milk, but wish it had been a little creamier. Next time I will make with half mik and half cream for a richer pudding.

this had a really nice flavour to it - a little too sweet for my husband, but i didn't mind! :D   my only issue was with the consistency... i cooked it for much longer and it was still quite thin. and i let it cool in the fridge and it was still rather runny - but we both scrapped our cups so i guess it didn't bother us! :D  oh - and i caught the cat licking the cups - so she approves too!

kinda boring, it was just pudding. I had a berry topping and it turned out well--with the topping.  It was very creamy though!

i really liked this recipe to keep it away from blandness i used some popsicle molds added some hot fudge sauce first then i poured this in next then i added some slices of banana and finished it off with jello! i put it in the fridge for 2 hours and then took it out off the mold into some good looking serving plates it tasted very good very colourful and it  made a very good recipe for summer plus my kids loved it this way!

I thought it was good,  did not add any salt.  Added cinnamon.  Yummy!  Tasted really good a little warm.
