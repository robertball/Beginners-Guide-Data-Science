WOW, this tasted just like sour cream with dill added to it!  I really had to tinker with this one so that it would have a taste.  I added a lot more horseradish, and took Janet's review advice & added dijon mustard.  I ended up adding a little mayo as well.  Much better.  Thanks for the idea Michael!

As it is printed it is a great idea for a sauce but, for us, needed lots more horseradish plus extra dill (fresh of course) to taste.   Wonderful for dipping or on roast beef.   Even good on broiled salmon.   Will be used often

Super good. Nice zip.   I used this instead of tartar sauce for lemon-pepper cod and it was delicious!!!  My husband, who KNOWS good food, really liked it.  He thought it would go good with a nice steak too.  Great recipe!!!

Great recipe, but I add waaaay more horseradish. Perfect for burgers, prime rib, roast beef, steak, or vegetables. It seems like I'm always whipping up this sauce for one thing or another each week.

I took the advice of other reviews and added some more horseradish and about 2 tsp of dijon mustard and some mayo. Much better, always remember to read the other reiviews!

Very good! I used dried parsley instead of the dill, since I am not a fan. Also used more horseradish than called for, a dash of Tobasco, and a pinch of steak seasoning salt. I am serving it with beef brisket.  Super yummy! Thank you!

Once I tweaked this, it was really good! The recipe alone was too sour creamy tasting lacking that spicy kick of the horseradish! I doubled the horseradish and added dijon as suggested!

I upped the horseradish to two TABLESPOONS and added a little fresh ground pepper. The longer this sits, the better it gets. This was a nice basic dipping sauce that would be easily bendable to personal changes. I'd make this again.

As I was preparing this recipe I realized I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used plain greek yogurt . It was equal part sour cream to yogurt, I did this simply out of necessity, because I always follow a recipe to the letter so I can fairly rate it. It was PERFECT, a keeper, so thank you for posting this recipe.

Needed a ton more horseradish than the recipe called for.  It was more of a sour cream sauce than a horseradish sauce.  A good base that needs a lot of changes to it

This was pretty good. I used it on stuffed roast beef shells and it turned out nicely. It could have used a little stronger horsey flavor though even though I used extra hot horseradish. I liked that it wasn't mayonaissey tasting like some of the others I have tried. I would use this again. It had a lot more green flecks in it than the posted pic shows and wasn't as pretty, but tasted good. I think a dash of garlic would have been a good addition the next time.

I thought this was tasty! I wanted something light to dip the 'Baked Zucchini Chips' in and this fit the bill. I used light sour cream and added a spoon of light mayo. I also added a little garlic powder. I will be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

I took everyones advice out there which resulted in a good sauce for our beef fondue last evening. I added some mayo and lots more horseradish. I did love the idea of the dill which is why I tryed this recipe to begin with. Nice and refreshing!

Pretty good, but needs more horseradish. If you add another tablespoon or so, this is the exact same thing as Tiger Dill sauce from Outback Steakhouse. Yum!

Just note that this needs to be real horseradish, not horseradish sauce.  The sauce is much to mild.  I use 'COLD SPRINGS' real horseradish and this was AWESOME!

I really liked this. I added alittle more horseradish then it called for. Great on steaks or alittle on potatoes with butter.
