Recipe divided well.  Cut all ingredients in half and substituted sour cream for the whipping cream (was out and didn't want to use half and half because I need that for my coffee). Also substituted crushed crackers for bread crumbs. It was delicious. Would definitely make again! Next time, I'll keep the full recipe for the sauce. Really wished I had more.

We thought this made a lovely dinner.  Just so you know, there are two camps on Swedish meatballs---one says yes to sauce, and the other says no way!   I've tried both ways, and both are delicious.  The sauce here is a very good one, and the meatballs were not only easy to make but very tasty.  I cut the recipe in half and got 15 meatballs using my middle cookie scoop which made them about 1 1/2" big.  I'd advise others not to go overhanded on the garlic (I used a little more than called for thinking that turkey doesn't taste that much); the amount called for is spot on.  I made two subs on this: chicken broth rather than beef broth and pappardelle pasta rather than egg noodles--neither one making much difference in the long run.  I would definitely make these again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these and every one couldn't get enough. I did change a couple of the ingredients only because of lack of having what it called for, I used 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the heavy cream and soy sause in place of the other sause. I also used crushed croutons in place of bread crumbs. Was amazing,, I loved the gravy!!

So easy! Quick recipe. And had all the ingredients on hand. The only thing I changed was to add salt to the gravy-which I doubled because we love our sauces! It seemed to need a little more seasoning. The meatballs were delicious with the gravy over wide egg noodles. My whole fam gobbled them up! (No pun intended.) This gravy would be delicious on rice too. Will be making again.

This was really good and I learned s new way to make a rue!  We added some salt and used 2% milk instead of heavy cream-still made a delicious sauce.

Excellent! Used Italian bread crumbs in addition to using Italian seasoning. Used milk instead of cream. Used 1 lb meat, cut down meatball ingredients accordingly but made full amount gravy. Wanted plenty of gravy.

Great recipe for my family. I was in a pinch for time so I cheated and used frozen turkey meatballs.  I started from beef broth mixture in the recipe.  Still delicious!

I made it fairly close to the recipe instructions except for only adding 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and adding a little milk to some bread slices cause I didn't have bread crumbs (this makes it easier to mix into meat mixture).  It got rave reviews!

Great recipe. I added a dollop of sour cream at the end just to give the gravy a richer flavor.

Excellent recipe for something different using ground turkey. Really liked the sauce and the new method of adding the flour to broth.  I subbed in evaporated milk, as I usually do for the cream. Next time I will add a bit of salt to the mixture. I served it with baked sweet potatoes, which is a great match-up.

This was delicious!  My hubby was so happy that I made a ‘creamy’ gravy for our meatballs. I made minor changes mainly due to wanting to use ingredients I had on hand. We will definitely be making this again. Thank you.

The flavor was excellent, but the texture was VERY mushy! The meatballs disintegrated and the meatballs were was like Taco Bell meat texture inside. I followed it exactly! I’ll make it again but try with more breadcrumbs and 1 more egg!

This was good! I used sour cream in place of heavy cream as we're trying to cut down on fat, and it was still delicious. We also used rice in stead of noodles. I baked half the meatballs in the oven at 375 for 15 minutes to be served with gravy on the side and cooked the others as indicated, and both were very tasty. Next time, I'd like to add some mushrooms.

I made this with 3 changes.  I used ground chicken and after browning the meatballs I put it all in a crockpot on high for 6 hrs. I also substituted sour cream. delicious and friendly for busy cooks.

I really liked this. The sauce was very good and what I expected out of Swedish meatballs. I don't think of Swedish meatball sauce as crazy flavorful, more of a comfort food. It was even better the second day. The only change I made was adding a little parsley for some color. The recipe lost a star because I found the meatballs a tad lacking something. So when I make it again I'll add some extra seasoning to zing them up. They don't need much - just a little something extra. Overall this was a keeper and a nice way to use turkey in a new way.

Everyone loved this! I followed the recipe, (only substituting a mix of sour cream and 1/2&1/2 for the heavy cream). I also added a pinch of dried dill and some parsley flakes to the sauce. 
Will definitely be making this again. :-)

I used frozen turkey meatballs- a whole package, doubled broth, flour and butter, but kept heavy cream at 1 cup. I added the Worcestershire, too, doubled. It worked- hubby approved.

This turned out very delicious. I did have to add salt and a pinch of beef flavor bouillon only because it did taste a bit bland and I wanted more flavor. I also added some red pepper flakes because I like everything SPICY!! I will definitely make again. Thank you.

Ehh. Like others said, sauce was very thin. I had to add some sour cream to give it any body, and this after boiling it. Flavor very mild. It was something different, but ehh.

This was good but thought it lacked flavor .  I did use sour cream in place of the whipping cream.  And maybe should have
used finely ground parmesan, mine was coarsely ground.
I will try again and add onion and maybe some mushrooms.

Everyone in my house loved it.  I substituted  almond meal for bread crumbs (to lower carbs for hubs), omitted egg because of kids egg allergy and left Worchestershire out because of a soy allergy.  Still turned out AWESOME!

I was just looking for a turkey meatball recipe to go with marinara sauce.  I like this recipe.  I'll make it again, but try adding yellow onions.  So play with this as a base recipe.

Wonderful.  Served with Marinara - great alternative to beef meatballs
