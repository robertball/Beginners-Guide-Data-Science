The final result is absolutely delicious, but after experimenting, I found that you only need one cup of sugar and a dribble-more of milk. Anymore and it's too sweet and a tad too dry. Once you get your preferences on the ingredients right, though, it's addictive!

DELICIOUS!!!

I followed the recipe to a T except I added 1/4 cup butter to the milk while heating (this was how my father always made it, and he was taught by his neighbor's grandmother).  This made it moist, but still incredibly light.  I baked it in two round pans for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  I made a chocolate ganache with 1 cup of half and half and 8 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate and, after allowing it to cool for a minute, spread that on top.  DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS!!

People shouldn't critize the recipe if they have changed it in any way or form. The unsatisfication may be caused by their own modifications. 
I personally really liked this cake. And I followed the instructions.

This is the same recipe I've used for many years and have loved - except my recipe calls for a small amount of butter, 1/4 cup. I did not prepare the pan as it wasn't indicated to do so, and I do know that with this type of "no-fat" cake, greasing or greasing and flouring the pan isn't generally done as it could affect the rise. I used a shortcake pan and the little cakes stuck miserably. I was at least able to salvage the top halves.  The recipe I have always used with the butter doesn't direct to prepare the pan either, but I believe that because of the little bit of butter in the batter, that's not necessary.  I actually prefer the recipe with the butter anyway - I like both the texture and the mouthfeel better. If I was to make this recipe again, especially with this individual shortcake pan, I'd grease and flour the pans.  What little bit of rise I might sacrifice would be worth having the cakes release easily and intact. Same day update: I was compelled to make these again for several reasons, sheer stubbornness one of them. But the truth be told, if Doughgirl made them with success there had to be something I needed to do differently. (I admire and respect her expertise!) Finally, unless I wanted to serve my guests with botched sponge cakes (my mother would say "Who cares what they look like, they're delicious!), I either had to buy an angel food cake or...bite the bullet and try this again.  This time I greased and floured my pan - complete success!

As per previous reviews, I only used 1 cup of sugar, and added a little more milk ( 1/3 cup instead of 1/4 ). Delicious and fluffy looking cake. Cutting down the sugar is absolutely necessary. Loved the cake.

My 4 year old son and I made this while the 2 year old napped.  We made it as the base for a Strawberry shortcake.  It was wonderful.  My 2 and 4 year old had 3 slices each. (after eating a good dinner). This is a definate, down home, good cooking, comfort food.  We will make this often this coming summer.

I made this exactly as stated and think it's a nice, simple, comfort-food type basic cake.  The texture is very appealing, light and fluffy, surprisingly similar to angel food only more tender and less rubbery.  I thought sponge cake had a different texture, larger air pockets in it, this one is finely textured.  This would be super with strawberries and real whipped cream. I am serving it for a child's birthday sandwiched with stabilized whipped cream to resemble a ... (should I reveal this) ... giant twinkie, what the party boy requested.  Unfortunately it's not yellow like a twinkie, but tastes much better!

This recipe is delicious and so simple to make.  The cake bakes up terrific in a tube pan.  The crust comes out crunchy/chewy/sweet like the top of a muffin.  The cake has good vanilla flavor and holds together nicely.  It would go great with fresh fruit and ice cream. Would like to add other flavors to this recipe like lemon or orange.  But wonder if I should use extracts or juice/zest?

Relatively easy to make.  I frosted it with the cinnamon frosting from the "Buttery Cinnamon Cake" that's also on allrecipes.com.  My family really enjoyed the combination.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to make strawberry shortcakes with a sponge cake base, and this was perfect. One recipe made enough batter to fill my pan (for 6 individual sponge cakes) plus one 8-inch round. Next time, I may halve the recipe. I added about ½ teaspoon of orange zest (to complement the orange liqueur I was adding to the strawberries) and a pinch of salt.

This cake is a lovely golden brown at exactly forty minutes in the oven. It is, however, too dense for a sponge. The egg whites and yolks should be separated first, to make it lighter. Also, I reduced the sugar by a forth of a cup, added another teaspoonful of vanilla extract, used brown sugar instead and made a chocolate ganache as another reviewer recommended. Do add the one forth cup of butter as it helps greatly. The end result should be a delicious golden brown cake which smells like vanilla and caramel.

Great base for Strawberry Shortcake. You can add or decrease sugar in the cake depending on how sweet your berries are. Love it!

I baked this cake in two 9 inch rounds to make a strawberry shortcake for my family and everyone agreed it was delicious.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet.  Make sure to grease your pan because the cake does stick to it.

Thanks for a great recipe~ This cake turned out fantastic!!! I have never made a successful cake from scratch until I tried this recipes. I reduced the sugar, added chocolate chips and baked it in a loaf pan. It turned out great~ this is definitely one of my favourite recipes now. =)

I loved this recipe!!! I made it for a last min tea and coffee gathering with my sister-in-law, nieces and two friends....it came out very fluffy and yummy. In Turkey cake is usually light and fluffy like this so it was great! I put a 1/4 cup of butter in the milk and made the batter this way. I buttered a springform pan and made it in that. I generally grease my cake pans when I bake a cake...so I didn't even see that it didn't state whether to grease ur pan or not I did it purely out of habit and am glad I did bc when I went back to read the reviews I saw a lot of people had trouble bc they didn't grease their pan. The outside came out crunchy and chewy and the inside was beautifully spongy!! I loved it! Thank u!!!

I made this exactly like the recipe stated and it turned out fabulously!!   I made this for my mom's b-day cake and everyone loved it.  I made it in two 9 inch rounds and did it as layer cake with whipping cream and fresh fruit in the middle.  I did use a buttercream icing for the sides and top but that was far too sweet.  The unanimous vote is to make it as two 9 inch cakes and top each cake with whip cream and fresh fruit.

mmmm!  Very good!  I halved the recipe and was still able to make a dozen cupcake versions of this.  I just baked for 30 minutes.  I did tweak it by adding a couple teaspoons of instant coffee, cocoa, and butter to the hot milk and it made somewhat of a mocha version.  I did find that it was a little sweet for my taste though so maybe I will try only half or 3/4 of the sugar next time.  But still a keeper!

I couldn't resist adding 1/4 cup butter. Though the tradeoff was the cake wouldn't rise as it should but I'd prefer the buttery and moist cake anytime. I whipped the egg whites seperately and gentlely folded it in to make the cake light. Also, I reduced the sugar to 180 g and added 1/4 tsp salt. Lining the cake pan with baking paper helped the cake come out from the pan so easily. Thank you for the crazy good yet simple recipe.

I find the cake a little dense and chewy instead of light and fluffy as a sponge cake should be, however, it still tastes great.  I added a pinch of salt to the batter as advised by others.

Good for being very lowfat.  Next time I will cook for a little less time and/or add more milk.  I would have liked it to be a little more moist.  Definitely need to serve with some sort of sauce.

Grease the pan!  I thought that since this was compared to angel food cake, and since the recipe did not state this, you didn't need to grease the pan.  Grease the pan!  :)  I used half the amount of sugar. Great with strawberries (with sugar and the juice that comes from that) and whipped cream.

I am rewriting this review, because I've made this recipe again, in round cake pans, and it was fabulous.  As mentioned, I did butter and flour the pans, but also cut the layers to add raspberry jam and whipped cream.  When I sliced it I used a bread knife because it is rather delicate.  Everyone went crazy for it.

Lovely cake recipe, easy to make.  I reduced the sugar content to 1/2 cup for a less sweet cake.

The first time didn't come out right--it was too dense, but it still tasted good.  I tried it again and make sure I whipped the eggs long enough, and it came out really nice!  I also followed other reviewers' suggestions--reduced sugar to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup of butter to milk.  It has just enough sweetness and goes well with whipped cream and fruits and even with vanilla ice cream!

This was interesting....I made it in cupcake tins because I couldnt find my bread tin... They were okay, but didnt just take like a sponge cake...they had a very unique hot milk taste, that I cant say I loved...If you like the taste, it's a great recipe, they turned out wonderfully, but I just didnt care for the flavor. I suppose I wasnt expecting the milk to have such a strong taste. My dad didnt mind them though.

Followed directions except I substituted half the sugar with splenda.  Not sure if that is what affected the consistency but the cake was definitely heavy and dense.  Still delicious, so I'm not complaining.  Just have to look for another recipe or try again for a lighter cake.

This was a WOW worthy sponge cake! My husband said it was the best he ever had. I baked in two round sandwich tins. Sandwiched the delicious sponges with sweetened whipped cream and strawberry jam, topped with confectioners sugar, cream and fresh strawberries. Perfect!

A little too sweet for me, i would reduce the sugar.. maybe 1.5 cups or even just 1 cup. Other than that its really good. I added 1 TBS canola oil, it made it really moist, light & fluffy :)

This made a wonderful sponge cake. It was exactly what I hoped it would be. I baked it in the dessert cups bakery pan.  It makes perfect little sponge cakes (like the ones you find in the store) for strawberry shortcake!  The cake is the perfect texture for strawberry shortcake.  I know shortcake has a biscuit texture, but I love those little "dessert cup" cakes  at the grocery that are more of a sponge cake (which does have a slightly tougher or rubbery  texture).  My husband, who used to work in a bakery, said the bakery used "sponge" cake recipe for the dessert cups, and that this recipe was really good.  Thank you so much!

I LOVE this recipe. It makes a light, delicious, versatile cake. I made it without changing it at all and have made it many times since. Can be served with fruit, chocolate, cream - whatever you wish. It is also delicious plain. Thank you for posting such an easy, classic dessert.

This is the first time i've made sponge cake and i would have to say it turned out great!. I halved the recipe, but also reduced the sugar because a 1:1 sugar flour mixture seemed too sweet.  i also added an extra egg because i like my cakes really eggy.  The best part about this recipe is that there is no butter! as it is a sponge cake.  It seems like something is missing though, maybe a little salt? I will try this again with some salt and maybe reduce the sugar a little more

Good flavor. Not lite and airy like I expected. It was a little chewy. I added 2 T butter with the milk. Next time I will not use any butter and whip the eggs more.

I was craving something sweet one night and I came across this recipe. I made it with just a bit more milk. When it was done I cut it into cubes, added some strawberry sauce I made and put vanilla mango frozen yogurt on top. Gave it to the whole family as dessert and everyone loved it :) My sister in law especially, she loved how spongy the cake was and kept picking at the leftovers. :) A great, easy recipe!

This is a great cake IF you eat it straight from the oven while its still piping hot. I made these into little rose flavoured cup cakes and the taste was great. They were absolutely delicious, fresh from the oven. HOWEVER, when they cooled down, they sank and became rubbery like many reviewers said. They are still yummy but my heart sank along with the cake when I ate it in the morning. Nice base cake but not airy or spongy when cool.

i was succeed in the second trial. the cake was fluffy and tasty enough. in fact, i sifted and gently folded dry indegrients into egg mixture instead of beating. this kept air bubbles inside the batter and helped the cake fluffy and light. while it was fluffy enought it wasn't eggy at all. great. try it again even you was fail like me.

I followed the recipe but reduced the sugar to 1 cup as suggested by previous reviewers.  I also added a tad of nutmeg.  The end result was just 'okay'.  I found the cake to be too eggy for my taste.  Wouldn't use this recipe again...

I've made this twice now. The first time I followed the general consensus that 2 cups of sugar was "too sweet," and only used one cup. I put them in the Nordicware mini basket pan. They turned out great. They were somewhat more dense than a true sponge cake, but the texture was really good for the berries I put on it.

Some people commented that it wasn't as tender as they expected. That is one of the consequences of reducing the sugar. Sugar makes cakes lighter and more tender. If you change the proportions it's going to change the texture too, not just the flavor. Word to the wise.

This time I made it exactly as written. It was much more sponge-like and tender (almost too tender). I might split the difference next time and use 1 and 1/2 cups sugar. I bake at 5500 ft, so that probably contributed to the problems I had with the lighter texture. (Mine actually collapsed a little; I haven't had a cake collapse in years.)

I made a serving for 7 as a trial batch. My family enjoyed it very much! I did however cut the sugar by 3/4ths, and added 1/4th in honey. I added a small amount of butter to the milk as someone suggested, and a pinch of salt to the batter. To make things a little more exciting I added dried cranberries and processed some walnuts for a topping.

Easy, tasty, fun to make. I don't have a loaf pan so I made half the recipe (w/ half the sugar) in a cast iron skillet. Topped with strawberry glaze. Turned out well.

I thought this recipe was delightful. Loved the flavor (especially after cutting down the sugar to just over a cup, which was plenty), but the texture was a little too dense for the strawberry shortcake I was making. Still, it was very simple and relatively fast. I would make it again.

The cake turned out great, but I didn't like the flavour of it. It had a nice light texture but I just didn't like the cake very much.  However, I cut down the sugar to 1 cup and it was the perfect amount of sweetness.  So, what I'm saying is that it's a good recipe if you like Hot Milk Sponge Cake, but it's just not for everyone.

A pretty good cake. I like that it is no fat and easy to make. As another previous reviewer, I did reduce sugar down to 1 cup and subbed in almond extract in place of vanilla, just a personal preference. Not too sweet, just the way we like it. Great with our evening coffee and tea. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and tasty, but nothing spectacular. Dense, moist, and really good warm, especially with fresh whipped cream. I cut the baking time WAY down, however--by about fifteen minutes. So keep an eye on yours.

We love this cake!  I like to serve it with fresh sliced strawberries.  My boyfriend likes to drizzle a slice with melted chocolate-- which is very rich but delicious.  I also like that it stays so moist.

I used this as a base for strawberry shortcake and it worked well.  It resembled angel food cake, but a bit more substantial.  It was rather sticky when taking it out of the pan - not sure if greasing the pan would help, I would try this if I made it again.

I agree with all the comments that say to halve the sugar. I used 1 + 1/3 cups sugar and the cake came out really well. My first sponge cake!

A simple, light cake. I used 1 & 1/3 cups sugar, and dusted it with powdered sugar once it was cooled. Served with raspberry sauce. For an almost fat free cake, this was very satisfying.

For me it turned out quite dense and not light & fluffy but I used a 9X13 pan. By itself it wasn't to my liking coz it tasted bland.  I still used it for my trifle dessert inspite of my reservations and it turned out great with all the whipped cream, pudding & gelatin I placed on top of it.

I followed this recipe exactly and it did not come out how I expected it to AT ALL. I  used a 12 inch tube pan for the cake. When i took it out, the inside was not cooked at all... the batter was still liquid! Only the outsides of the cake was fully cooked. I had to scoop out the center.

I loved this recipe - I didn't change a thing to the basic recipe.  
The only thing I did was to add some icing: I cut the cake in half, spread some  raspberry jam, and then some whipped cream to the bottom half and frosted the top with icing sugar - yummo!

I cut the amount of sugar, but will add it all the next time I make it.  It has a nice spongy consistency.  I made it in a bunt pan and served it with cool whip and caramel topping.  Would like to use strawberries next time!

This didn't work for me. I cut sugar back to 1C as others recommended; that was the only change. It came out dense, heavy and without much taste. I believe that 40 minutes was too long a cooking time. If I were to try this recipe again I would check it after 20-25 minutes. We ate it with lots of fruit sauce, but I tossed the remainder away. Will look for another hot milk cake recipe until I get one that works for me.

Excellent cake! Really good and easy to make. Quick and the ingredients are things you always have on hand. Love it with berries and whipping cream.
An excellent spring-picnic-everyone-brings-something cake.

Not a bad cake, but it didn't fit the description of light and fluffy. In fact, it was rather dense and eggy. Could be because I 3/4'd the recipe though.

i followed another rater's advice and used 1 cup sugar and a little more milk. the cake looked nice when it came out, but it was quite bland. i had to douse it in cream, and even then, it was still not fantastic. would recommend others to find a different recipie

i made mine with 2 layers.  between the layers I spread apricot jelly and sprinkled powder sugar on top. You can use elderberry jelly.  I buy "Webster's jelly which ihas the real flavor the the fruit.  You may not want to use top jelly but I  prefer a good taste all around.

I cannot figure out what I did wrong. I think I followed the instructions spot on but I had troubles getting the middle baked which resulted with a very hard outer crust.
Tastes good and determined to figure out where I went wrong. So relieved that it wasn't made for a special occasion because it is unserveable.

I will definitely be making this again! A nice easy weeknight type of cake but probably nice enough for company too. I did add a splash of almond extract just because I'm a little obsessed with it but I think it would be yummy just as written.  I had a little trouble getting it out of the pan but I think that's par for the course with cakes like this so I won't hold it against the recipe. I served it with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.

This tastes like a boring bread made of flour and sugar, with no interesting texture or taste whatsoever. I changed nothing in the original recipe, except added some raisins to the batter, which is the only salvation to the bread. While it was quite easy to make, there was no fun in eating it.

I followed the suggestions but the batter turned out very runny. Tasted like baking powder and turned out very dense. I must have done something wrong.

I can't really rate this because I tried it twice and each time it came out like a hockey puck. Looked great when I took it out of the oven and then collapsed. I did cut the sugar and the baking powder. Tried it with half in a round pan and half in muffin tins. I have made other cakes but can't figure out where I went wrong with this one. Do I need to do it in a tube pan? It sounded great for strawberries.

I took others advised by using only 1 cup of sugar, adding 1/3 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of margarine (instead of butter) to the milk. I made 2 batch, 1 with white milk and the other one with cocholate milk. Both turned out wonderfully moist and very flavorful. Very easy for such a great cake.

I was a bit disappointed - I followed the recipe exactly but I should have halved the sugar; it was way too sweet.  Also, I found 40 minutes wasn't long enough to cook the centre (toothpick didn't come out clean) so I had to cook it for another 10 minutes.  The result was a cooked centre but a really chewy 'crust'.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was very easy to make! I baked it in a square pan and it came out perfect. It looked really cute when I cut it in little squares :D. I also added a bit more milk and less sugar, but it really depends on your own taste!

I really wanted to like this, but it just didn't work for me even after making it twice.  The first time, I used cake flour...it didnt rise much and was dense.
The 2nd time, I followed the instructions carefully and it was VERY dense...wasn't springy at all.  Sorry...I had to throw it out.  I don't know, it might've been my fault but I've been baking cakes for awhile now.  I might try it again but will have to tweak it definitely.

I followed others' suggestions and reduced the sugar to a cup, otherwise following the recipe as is.  I really enjoy the flavor, but I agree with those who said it came out a little rubbery.  It wasn't light or spongy like I hoped it might be.  It's pretty good, but because of the texture I doubt I would make it again.

I made this using soy milk so that might be the problem. I didn't like this at all. It was very eggy tasting and had a rubbery texture- not light and fluffy at all.
