This is quick and easy. I make a similar version on the stove. The family enjoyed it. I used the tiny chinese eggplant. If you let it cool then it comes out of the foil easier. I cook mine a bit longer only because DH likes it that way! Thank you for the quick dinner side!

This was absolutely delicious! I bought some eggplant at the farmer's market and didn't feel like frying it in the warm summer weather. This recipe was the perfect solution. The vegetables were very sweet and made a great meal served with some fresh pasta and bread.

This was great but I changed it a bit, I cubed the eggplant, then put in some cherry tomatos, halved, I also added a clove of minced garlic instead of the garlic salt and put in some basil. I put it in packets and cooked it on the grill. came out great!

I used some of our "Fairytale" eggplant for this, and it was wonderful.  Such simple ingredients, too!

I did this using cherry tomatoes as well and I added kale and garlic mixed together with balsamic vinegar. I sprinkled the eggplant with olive oil and them with garam masala. served with feta cheese in pita pockets.
