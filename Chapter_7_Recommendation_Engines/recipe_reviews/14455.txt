This is an excellent recipe!  For the dressing, use Newman's Oil & Vinegar (or Italian, I believe).  It's always better the 2nd day - I grew up eating it - Andrea is my mom, and Harold was my Dad. Thanks for submitting it Mom!  I just found it randomly on this site!  :)

This recipe was very "blah".  Edible, because it was so simple, but very boring.  Also, directions say to add mushrooms, but mushrooms are not listed in the ingredient list . . .

I made this for Easter dinner at Bette Jo's 2011. Lacie said, "Mmmm. That salad is good!" when she tried it so it must be OK. I liked it.

I made it for a picnic. Everyone wanted the recipe. The only  change was baby portabellos and Newman's own salad dressing.

This is a very good recipe! I made this pretty much as in the recipe with a few minor substitutions. My whole family was happy to eat this. I prefer my olives sliced, and I had a few cherry tomatoes to get rid of. Also made my standard vinaigrette dressing. Those were the big changes.
