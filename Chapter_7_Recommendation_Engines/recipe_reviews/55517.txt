Very good!  Something different for all the strawberries we have.  I didn't have biscuit mix on hand, so substituted 2 cups flour, 1T. baking powder, 1 tsp. salt & 2 T. shortening.  This isn't meant to be a spongy texture, but I didn't find it at all dry.  Even the 2nd day, the shortcakes were a great texture.  Definitely a keeper!

I did add a little sugar to the fruit. The cakes were a bit dry (I may have cooked them a minute or two longer than recommended) and kind of big.  I think I could get 10 easy instead of 8.  I used Whipped Cream in a can!!  I'm sure it would taste even better if I made it from scratch. This was easy and fast.  Kids loved it.

I've made these many times and we just love them. Bake them just a little less than the recipe calls for. A definite "keeper"!

Not bad for a spur of the moment dessert! I would definately sift the baking mix though....

These were a huge hit at my friend's house for dinner one night.  I did bake the shortbreads a little shorter than the recipe called for (10 min) because of previous posts about them being dry.  I thought they were wonderful.

very good and so easy to do! My 5 year old daughter did most of the work!
We actually made them a little smaller and made a dozen and cooked them for only 9 minutes.

This is such a great twist on an original!  I loved the biscuits, even by themselves.  I used the suggested recipe of a previous reviewer who didn't have bisquick - and it came out great. Will definitely make again soon!
