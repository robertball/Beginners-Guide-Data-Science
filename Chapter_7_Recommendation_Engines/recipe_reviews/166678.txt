This is a very EASY way to make curry rice. I cooked mine over the stove and when it was done cooking I added 3 tbs of olive oil and 1 tsp or yellow curry to a large skillet ( more like a rounded wok really, very deep) i then added 4 chicken thighs cut into 1 inch pieces and sauteed till cooked after they were done I put them in a bowl to wait, Using the same oil I added 2 med onions chopped and sauteed till they started turned brown, then I added a handful of coarsely chopped unsalted baking cashews to the mixture, returned the chicken and added the already cooked rice stirring frequently over med heat until thoroughly heated and mixed. Turn off the burner and let sit for 10 min or so. This will allow the cashews to really soak in the flavor and be nice and tender with the dish.  I'm telling you this tastes just like the stuff they serve at restaurants. So good. Everyone LOVED it!   happy cooking

I made this recipie just like it was instructed and it came out bland. Not sure if it was something I did wrong or what because the reviews said it was so good. I made it again with adding butter and salt and just a little bit to pan drippings from baked chicken and it was great.

I'm sorry that I couldn't give this a more favorable review.

Easy? Yes.... tasty? No....This recipe was plain and dull.

To doctor it: You're better off adding some chicken/beef broth base or seasoning to the mix for flavor (I use Orrington Farms, no MSG). And doing this would keep true to the "easy" way.

But honestly, you're better off making the "Authentic Bangladeshi Beef Curry" 
recipe that you can type in the search engine near the top of the page.

Never stop trying nickval2010!

I don't understand the rave reviews.  Followed directions to the T and it turned out inedible due to the flavor.

Very easy to make, throw it and wait! That's the kind of dishes I like. I added a few things to the rice cooker. I added garlic powder, onion powder and extra curry. I'm using this as a base for a dish I make often and this was an awesome idea to cut down on prep time. I'd never thought to add anything but rice to the rice cooker! The only thing I see that it needs is salt,other wise the flavor of the curry isn't brought out.

I didn't have a rice cooker, so I did the usual 1 part rice 2 parts water method and boiled in a pot. I also did not put 3 Tablespoons of curry powder, because that seemed like way too much seasoning for that little rice. I decided that it was meant to be read "3 Teaspoons" and used just that. I really enjoyed how it came out. It was in need of just a little more salt at the end of cooking, and my curry powder might have been on the cheap side and had to adjust the taste just a tad (I needed to add a small extra sprinkle of ginger, nutmeg, and garlic as well).
 Another thing that is wonderful with this recipe, just cut up your favorite sausage and dump it in with your cooking rice. spices the sausage and gives a little extra to the rice.

I also used a rice cooker and substituted unsweetened coconut milk for water and used 2T of red curry instead of the 3 of regular curry powder. Yield = perfect subtle curried rice.  Use a fragrant rice like Basmati or Jasmine for maximum flavor.

Instead of adding water, I used lower sodium chicken stock, for those who want more flavor, I suggest using this trick for a more flavorful rice dish. It was delicious!

Too much curry and too bland otherwise.  Agree with other posts that suggest using broth or something to doctor it up and make it better

Easy to make? Sure, but incredibly bland. Needs additional flavors like onion, garlic, ginger, etc. Maybe some chicken stock or coconut milk.

I made this recipe to go with the chicken tikka masala dish (recipe from allrecipes). I added sliced red bell pepper for color appeal - however 3 tablespoons of curry was just way too much & over-powering for my taste. I think next time I make it - 2, 3 teaspoons of curry would be sufficient & probably try with chicken broth as others have suggested for flavor.

I made this and it came out super bland and even sticky.  I fixed it up with lots of salt, garlic powder and onion powder. I may use this as a base recipe again, but not by itself.
