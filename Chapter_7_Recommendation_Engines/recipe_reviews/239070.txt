This was a nice change, though maybe a bit heavy on the fresh fennel.

Had fennel, shrimp and shallots in the fridge. Substituted carrots for zuchinni; left out the celery; substituted sweet peppers and red chili flakes and used tomato paste, water and chicken bouillon.  A definite repeat.

Terribly delicious :)

Cooked it without fennel, zucchini and shallot, but added a little bit carrot to the vegetables, still super yum!

I made every effort to follow the recipe and measure ingredients. The only alterations I made were to substitute one regular onion for the shallots and canned petite tomatoes for the sauce. Easy to prepare and the vegetables were a great combination. Will make again.
