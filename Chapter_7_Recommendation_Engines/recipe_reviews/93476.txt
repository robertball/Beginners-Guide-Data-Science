Very different and original, great fall desert. I baked the squash at 400 for an hour and 15 min, which is MUCH easier than trying to peel it raw then steam it. Just scoop out the filling directly into your food processor (but only use about 3 1/2 cups since it's not cubed and raw). The nutmeg was a bit overpowering, so I'd reduce it to 1 tsp. Tastes a bit like sweet potato pie...wonderful!

This is a good recipe.  My husband and I would suggest cutting down on the spices.  But if you like your pumpkin pie with a lot of spice, then this is fine for you.  

We didn't have the ingredients for the topping, so we made one out of oats, flour, brown sugar, and butter.  Still turned out great.

amazing! my husband doesn't like squash and he liked this. the tartness of the apples contrasted wonderfully with the smooth spiciness of the squash. i omitted the wheat bran.

I was the submitter for this recipe under a different(lost) account. We still love it. Sometimes I grate the apples instead of cube them, and I have used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I get lots of requests for this unique way to use squash.

I really wanted to like this, but it didn't turn out as awesome as I expected. Made exactly as is, except in half. In part, the bottom wasn't as sweet as I might have liked, and the topping was pretty dry. If I knew how to tweak it I would! Thanks for offering it.

This is an excellent dish.   If you like all these spices together with apples & carrots, you will love it.  The topping is also outstanding.   I can't wait to eat some more of it tomorrow.   Maybe I'll have it for breakfast.

I did not care for this. I wanted to like this recipe but it is very labor intensive.  My apples were not cooked, the squash mix was like mush with raw apples and carrots in it and the crust was dried out.

I made this last year and thought I had lost the recipe. So glad I found it again! Love the flavors, although very labor intensive it is well worth the effort.

I did not use cloves because they make it bitter. Two teaspoons of nutmeg was too much. I left out the raisins and the wheat bran. The apples  did not cook down. I would reduce the recipe by half unless you are feeding a crowd. I would bake the squash. I used pumpkin instead of butternut squash.   My topping came out good.
