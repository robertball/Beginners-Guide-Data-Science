Great taste!  Easy to make, even if the rising of the yeast dough takes a while!  I brushed butter on top[ as soon as this bread came out of the oven.  Wonderful recipe!

I loved this recipe! Tasted just like my grandmothers! Since I am not a lover of Anise flavouring, I eliminated the Anise seeds, And substituted with a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and a half teaspoon of Anise extract. Also, just before baking, I gave each loaf an egg wash, (I mixed 2 egg yolks with 2 teaspoons of water, then brushed each loaf...Makes a great shine) . By the way, my favourite way to eat this is toasted with a little bit of butter.

I'm going to try it but nobody is making this with 5 tablespoons of anise seed. surely not black anise which last I purchased was $70 an ounce.
