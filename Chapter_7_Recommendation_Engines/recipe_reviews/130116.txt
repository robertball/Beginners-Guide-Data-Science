Wonderful. I only changed one thing. I used Almond Extract instead of vanilla since I couldn't find it in my cabinet. Absolutely fabulous!

My family really enjoyed this light desert. It was easy to make. The only change I made was adding the cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking instead of after.

The egg makes the difference in this version. Light and fluffy instead of heavy. Used the redused fat rolls and light cream cheese. Basted top crust with butter and sprikled cinnamon and sugar before it baked. Sooo gooood!
