I made this with a ham last week.  What a great addition.  Sweet and creamy!  I was too crunched for time to make a jello mold so I looked for something that would take less time and found a keeper recipe!!  This would be perfect with pork chops too!

This was very easy to make.  I made it in a 9 inch pie dish, which was too big, so the pie came out like a pancake.  I should have tried a small loaf pan.
 
It also came out very moist - I think I should have cooked it longer.  

I'll make this again, because it does have a very nice taste when warm.  

Might try it with some shredded coconut on top...

This was soooooo good and easy to pull together.  It was kind of custardy.  I made it with a roast lamb and it added just the right touch of sweetness.  Thank you Kathy.

My family (husband, 3 young kids and I) loved this side dish. They were skeptical at first, but it was gone quick and they were asking me to make more. I will definitely make this recipe again, especially nice with a pork roast.

This was just ok...but I made some changes to make it healthier...using fresh pineapple and more than the recipe called for, and I took out the sugar and added a couple of packets of sweetener. I think I added extra cinnamon too. It was interesting. My nine-year old daughter liked it.

This dish is unusual. Probably would only make on a rare occasion but it was good. I would recommend making it in a smaller dish so it does not come out too thin.

I made this for Christmas dinner for a change from jello salad.  It was just okay and didn't really get eaten.  I doubled it so it would fit in a 9" pie plate.  It was okay.

I think this recipe should get 3 1/2 stars. It wasn't good enough to go as high as 4 though so I only gave it 3. It was very sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. It was a nice change of pace to the common side dish and I would recommend this.
