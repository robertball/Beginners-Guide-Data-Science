Delicious! A very hearty soup that is also very tastey. It's easy to make - everyone I gave this soup mix to raved about it. I highly recommend you give this one a try.

I made this for dinner tonight.  It serves way more than two--probably about six.  I sauteed the onion in olive oil, then added the water, peas, lentils, barley, and rice.  Then stirred in all seasonings except for the salt.  It cooked in about 30 minutes, then I stirred in 6 chicken bouillon cubes and the salt.  Only four stars because it needed something more as far as seasonings go.

It has a chewy texture, due to the rice and barley, not a mushy one like I expected.  I like it and will make it again.  It's a great way to get fiber and protein, and the grains and legumes make a complete protein!

Nice for a gift jar. Soup is hearty and tasty. However, the posted yield is ridiculous. Just notice the 10 cups of water and total 2 cups of grains and you will realize that it yields 8 servings.

I made this soup "as is" since I planned on giving it out as gifts and I wanted us to try it the way it was presented.  It is a good soup, and makes a LOT.  For us personally, next time I will doctor it up a bit, add more garlic, maybe some bouillon, etc.  For leftovers we added smoked sausage.  I picked it over the myriad of soup mixes because it could be given to my vegetarian friends, and because it was so simple.  Look for red lentils if you can find them.  It was pretty in the jar, and well received.  I put the spices in a snack-sized ziplock bag and stuffed it in the top of the jar.  It all fit very nicely.  I also used brown rice instead of white rice.  Just a personal preference.

I wanted to do a soup-in-a-jar mix for colleagues and less-close friends, and I'm glad I tried this before I just "wrapped" it. The original recipe is gelatinous and downright gross. I tweaked it a bit, and it was delicious the second time around. I omitted rice (since that's what made it so sticky) while keeping the same water amount, doubled the garlic powder, used cumin instead of sage, and added 1/4 cup chicken stock powder (would have preferred beef but grocery was out). I also sauteed the onion in olive oil before adding lentils/barley/peas. So good. The changes are easy enough to put in instructions, so I'll give out my tweaked version.

After reading the other reviews I used the recipe as a base.  I fried 2 onions and 2 teaspoons of fresh garlic in the pot before adding the other ingredients.  I added a teaspoon of vegetable stock powder, one chopped chilli, a cup of dried chickpeas, some fresh herbs from the garden eg parsley, oregano & basil, and a tin of crushed tomatoes. I also used a cup of pasta which I added at the end of the cooking time instead of the rice. I had to add an extra 4 cups of water during cooking. NB: The pepper is not overwhelming! This is a great winter soup!

A good basic soup, but I found it bland.  I would recommend increasing the seasoning.  However, a friend to whom I gave this "jar mix" loved the soup.

I have received this soup as a gift twice in the past few years. The first time I prepared it, I had to force it down because the black pepper was overpowering for the quantity of soup it made. I received a jar again this month and did not realize it was the exact same soup with the exact same pepper problem until I tasted it last night and had deja vu. I wonder if there was a pepper typo error when the recipe got circulated over the years? Maybe I am the only one who finds the pepper overwhelming when the soup is prepared according to the directions without any alterations or additions?

I really enjoyed the soup.  I thought the pepper would be over whelming, so I cut it in half (most recipes seem to have a 2:1 ratio of salt to pepper).  My children didn't care for the strong sage flavor, but I enjoyed it.  I also used brown rice instead of white.  To give the gift jars more color, I used 1/4 c green and 1/4 c yellow split peas as well as 1/4 c red lentils and 1/4 c regular lentils.  I found some 3" x 4" clear treat bags in the wedding section at Walmart for the spice packet.  I tied with ribbon and used a cute holiday gift tag I found on a scrapbooking site for free (shabbyprincess.com).  I put the instructions on the back of the tag.  Overall I really like this recipe and would make it again as well as give it away!

Very yummy! It has enough flavor that you don't even miss that it doesn't have meat.

I rarely give out one's, but sorry, I just had to this time.  I started making this as is, except I used regular garlic power instead of granulated.  (From what I can tell, granulated is the same as powdered but bigger pieces, like salt.)   I then DOUBLED all the spices except the salt and it still tasted like flavored water.  (Bland isn't the proper word.  And I don't know how anyone could think the pepper or sage were over-powering.  I tasted about nothing.)  I did notice at least a couple of the 5's are people who doctored it up.  I started adding some bouillon just cause I couldn't see more spices doing anything, and ended up adding 5 bouillon cubes.  That finally made it "reasonable."  I had both barley & lentils I needed to use up, plus I like having a big pot of soup that I can eat for 2-3 days -- so it seemed like a bright idea to make the whole recipe even just for me, but sorry I did.

i don't know if i did something wrong, or what, but this did not turn out well. this is the first thing i've made in years that we just could not eat. i litteraly labled the leftovers as fail sauce, to warn my roommates it wasn't any good. i was hoping there would be some way to salave it, but i eneded up having to throw it out. luckily the ingredients were cheep.

I omitted salt from the seasoning packet.  When I cooked up the soup, I used only 8 cups of water, knowing that I like thick stews.  I added 2 carrots, a sliced clove of garlic, and 2 kale leaves.  This was ready to serve in 35 minutes.  There are so many possibilities of adding additional veggies!  Next time I will cut the amount of pepper in half for the sake of DH, but I enjoyed the amount in the recipe!

I rated this a 3 not only because I tweaked it (alot), but also because I believe that a Gift in A Jar should be all inclusive, and, for me, instructing the recipient to add his/own chopped Onion warranted a  "demerit". My tweaks were: (1) I added 1/4 teaspoon dried celery leaves to the seasoning packet, (2) I omitted the Rice (as suggested by another reviewer) all-together and increased the Barley to 3/4 cups; (3) I included (a) 1/4 cup Deyhydrated Onion AND (b) 1/4 cup Dehydrated Carrots; (4) I used 1/4 cup Green Split Peas and 1/4 cup Yellow Split Peas (rather than just green); and (5) I added 6 tsp. Chicken Bouillon granules (the eqivalent of 6 Chicken Bouillon Cubes). I layered the ingredients as follows (from bottom to top): Barley, Yellow Split Peas, Onions, Carrots, Green Split Peas, Bouillon granules, Brown Lentils. I did separate the seasoning in a packet, but I honestly don't see how including it in the general presentation would detract from it.

I'm really thinking this may be a 2-star, but I ate it so we'll go with 3. I read all the reviews and followed some of the tips. I cut the pepper in half, added 4 chicken bouillon cubes, and at about 10-minutes to done I added 3 cups of crisp veggies. It was still bland. It smelled amazing, but had no flavor at all. I doctored my bowl with additional pepper, salt, and garlic powder. It helped tremendously. IF I make this again, and that's a big IF, I'll be including the full amount of pepper and then some, lots more salt, and a fair amount of garlic powder. I might even consider adding some crushed garlic sauteed with chicken and onions.
