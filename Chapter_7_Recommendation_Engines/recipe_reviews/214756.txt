This is traditional winter Russian-Ukranian salad.  We use canned beans (red or white) instead of peas, and sourkraut is essential. We also make a dressing adding mustard, salt, and pepper to the olive oil and mixing well. You can also bake your beets instead of boiling for more intense beet flavor.

I make this--we have spent time in Russia and the ex-soviet republics (husband's job) and I am amazed at the numbers of reviewers who are concerned with "authenticity," on this and on other similar recipes. This is essentially the Eastern European garden salad that is available year-round. Everything in it can be kept for the bulk of the winter, either pickled or stored in a root cellar, so it is mostly a winter salad. The variations are endless, as are the particulars of the families who make it. I have eaten it with fish, without fish, with and without mayo, with sauerkraut, prunes, etc.  The contents depend on what is on hand and whether or not the kids will eat it! Goes well with either vodka or cognac.  As long as you have potatoes, beets, carrots and onion, you have the basics for this salad. Dressing is basic pickle juice and oil. Everything else is variable. I sometimes put eggs in mine. In summer--cucumber is good. Have fun with this!

Excellent instructions!  We, well, my Ukrainian husband usually buys this at the Russian market, and although he would hint at me trying my hand at making it, it seemed way too complicated.  This recipe totally demystified things for me, and we both loved the result - not usually the case when he buys it.  Will definitely make again, and again, etc.  Thank you!

A delicious savory salad.  Alot ample time for dicing the many vegetables.  It is labor-intensive but worth it for the fabulous color.  We used Claussen pickles rather than regular dill.  We will serve with grilled kielbasa and grilled pierogies tonight!

IMPORTANT NOTE: The cooked vegetables are a perishable food and must be refrigerated. Do not leave them at room temperature overnight. Directions omitted that, which was why I awarded 4 out of 5 stars. Now back to the recipe. This is going on my "next to try" recipe list because there are so many healthy things about it - hurray for the Ukrains! Besides, it's beauty of a dish.

one of my favorite winter salads. I omit the peas in favor of cannelini beans and use sourkraut to ad some tang to it

We had this dish in our home all the time especially in summer. If we had a barbeque with a houseful of guests, we served this dish with herring salat, potatoe salad and a large bowl of tossed salad and at the end of the day nothing was left. Sometimes I had guests ask if they could take home any leftovers. My mother was Ukrainian and dad a German. Yes it takes time to prepare but the results at the end of the day are worth it. My family and I sat at the table cutting up the ingredients, it was also a time for all of us to get together not just during the meal but beforehand. I highly recommend this dish.

This was a fabulous change from the typical veggie side dish. My kids wanted beef stroganoff tonight so I made this for me. Let's just say there will be no leftovers for a brown bag lunch tomorrow.  I did substitute frozen baby peas for the canned (they are so much prettier and less mushy) and added a few extra Claussen pickle chunks because we are dill pickle freaks! But this recipe deserves five stars without those changes!

Good as is, but we usually omit peas and add sourkraut (russian style, of course). Definitely good and good for you.

I would just like to offer the customized review on Vinegrete recipe: By the way I am  not sure, why it's  named Ukranian: we lived in Russia, and this was one of our all-season favorite Vinegret. I use home-made or store-bought sourcraut with sugar and caraway seeds (bavarian style) instead of pickles, sunflower oil, I do not add green peas.  It's very good served with herring on the side or some like it inside,and with Prussian Rye or Finnish Rye bread with butter !   And, for sure: it's great for you !

Made as a side dish for Thanksgiving. I already had all the traditional sides and I was looking for something lighter, with lots of color, with seasonal produce.  This hit the mark.  I followed suggestion to use the smallest beets you can find and I also used the suggestion to roast the beets and potatoes in the oven.  I made a day ahead and thought it was ok.  I added a splash of balsamic to try to flavor it up. Tasted the next day and it was excellent!  I think you need to make it 1 - 2 days in advance to allow the flavors to blend. Lots of positive feedback from guests. My sister-in-law asked to take home some of the extras. 

I would not use this as the only side as some people are afraid to try beets (their loss!) , but its a great dish when you are planning to have several side dish choices. It does take lots of prep, but the prep is way in advance, it looks pretty, tastes great, and doesn't need oven space the day of the party. It's too much prep for me to make as jut a regular meal but I will make this again for a party side dish.

I've been making this salad all my life, well i'm ukrainian, but that is why i can assure you- if you follow this instructions you will not get well made salad. The mistake is in wrong time shown here, the beets never get tender in short time. It needs longer time - at least 40 min boiling alone.
 otherwise it is generally ok.

I'm Ukrainian. One trick will help your salad look better. You should cut beets first, put them in the bowl, add some oil and mix so the oil covers all pieces. It will help to "lock" the color so the salad will be more colorful.

This is a great basic recipe. A trick make it prettier - make sure to cook the beets separately and keep them separate when combining the ingredients. They don't need to sit overnight. The salad can be made once the vegies have cooled. Then, combine all ingredients, except beets, with 11/2 tbsp. oil, mix the beets with the other half tbsp. oil, and then add beets to the salad ingredients. This keeps the other vegies nice and bright (and not red!) initially, although by the next day everything is red. I always add sauerkraut and if I use peas, I use frozen.

I changed this a bit by using canned beets, chopped fresh dill, and refrigerating the salad when the potatoes and carrots were cool.  I tasted it before I  chilled it and it's so different from most summer salads.  Will served it on iceberg lettuce along with corn on the cob and stuffed pork chops.  Has all ingredients that husband likes, so is bound to be a keeper.

Excellent traditional recipe. Being a Ukrainian, I have made it many many times. During times of Lent, it often serves as a main course. I like to omit peas and carrots, as a matter of personal preference. Instead, I add cooked white beans, some fried onions and a tablespoon of prepared mustard (I know, sounds weird, but there it is). As I usually have baked beets in my fridge (great for many health reasons), I use them instead of boiled ones - beautiful purple colour, less goodness lost during cooking. Being too lazy to peel boiled potatoes, I peel and cube fresh potatoes, and cook them in boiling water for 10 min and voila! they are ready. Ultimately, this is a fantastic forgiving recipe that I often modify to just beets, beans, potatoes, pickles and oil. Purists may protest but it works for me and my schedule.

10/10 recommend, definitely add more pickle as it really adds to the flavor. Lasted us  two nights so on the second everyone wanted to add in mayo to give it a sauce. DO NOT do this, is so much better how it is meant to be, it was okay with the mayo but it's not a saucy salad so I don't recommend trying but if you do then take some aside and add instead of mixing into the whole salad.

I I have both Russian & Ukrainian heritage on my father's side so I have been teaching myself slavic dishes. This is my first time making this salat & I am in love! Definitely a little time consuming but I am thinking of getting a chop wizard or something to make it a bit faster. If it works I will probably be making this dish weekly. So healthy & yummy.. Thanks for the recipe, BrandyLoveWine!

I'm Ukrainian and I love this salad. I used this recipe as a basics, but I did it a little differently. I added sour crout instead of pickles, black beans instead of peas, corn oil instead of olive oil and added more salt than in the recipe. I'd advice to cook beets separately, and cook potatoes & carrots together. Otherwise everything will become pink. Drain everything and let it cool down. Peel, cut. I cut it all in cubes. Cut beets first, add some oil and mix them, this way beets will spread their color less to other ingredients and salad will be more colorful.

My neighbor made this recipe and I just happened to stop by and was offered a little plate. It was absolutely delicious! She made it with dill rather than parsley which made me feel a little more "Spring". Making for Easter with roast beef. Would like to know how many servings this recipe is.

I have lots of beets to use up and was looking for a salad that my husband would eat without mayo. I did leave out the olive oil as we're on a fat free diet and I replaced it with a little of the pickle juice and didn't miss the oil at all, yum.

This recipe was a huge hit our recent fall party.  I did not find it difficult to make at all.  I followed the recipe's  timing and the vegetables were a perfect texture.  I did take a reviewer's suggestion and added a little pickle juice, which added additional flavor.  Next time I will try coating the beets with a little olive oil before combining the vegetables in order to prevent everything from turning 50 shades of red.

Very good!  I made this all in one day in the instant pot!  Pressure cook  beets, then potatoes, and then carrots.  When boiling all the nutrients end up in the water.

This is a wonderful salad!  The only thing I did differently was used sauerkraut instead of the peas (didn't have any).  I am going to make this a day ahead and  bring this to our 4th of July pig roast because I think it would go really well with the pork.

This is my favourite salad, I done it before I found the recipe here. I would add 2 more pickles per my own taste, also you can replace the pickles with fresh apple (honey crisp). It is very delicious!!!

Yummy,Yummy, Yummy I LOVE this recipe!  Beets are one of  my favorite vegetables EVER!  I admit,  I  swapped out the peas for cannelli  beans and added sauerkraut to make it more authentic.  Other than that... it was made exactly as written :-)
I made it yesterday and served it tonight and it was just great.  I served it with the Ukrainian Chicken Kiev from this site that was suggested and it was awesome.  If you haven't tried this recipe yet, do yourself a favor and make this!  Also, may I suggest that you make the Ukrainian Chicken Kiev that was suggested. ( I left my review on that recipe as well)  I don't think you will be sorry!

Really good salad! I used frozen peas instead of canned for a fresher flavour, and I added a little more dill pickle, plus a little pickle juice. It turned out well. Will make again.

I added half a cup of sauerkraut. Also, didn't bother to let it sit overnight.
