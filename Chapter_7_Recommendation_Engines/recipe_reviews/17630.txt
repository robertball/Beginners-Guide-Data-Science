Tried this recipe with minor variations* and it turned out GREAT! We, too, couldn't help eating almost the whole thing in one sitting!   Perfect texture, rise, sponginess, etc.  

*I used grapefruit (from a tree outside) and needed to increase the amount of juice for flavor and bumped up the flour to compensate... next time will probably leave it the same for even moister and spongier texture.
