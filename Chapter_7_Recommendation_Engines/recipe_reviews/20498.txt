Since I love the taste of roasted vegatables, I roasted the asparagus, along with some red onion and garlic, before adding to the egg mixture. Really gave a great recipe an extra depth of flavor.

Do you have 8" pie plates?  Me neither.  So I made the recipe in one regular-sized pyrex pie plate and it was good.  One of the problems with the recipe is that it doesn't give an exact amount of asparagus - it says "1 lb, trimmed and cut into 1/2 inch pieces."  I ended up with a little too much asparagus because I read it to mean one pound of asparagus AFTER it had been trimmed - so the quiche came out a little too "moist".  But it was good and I'm just going to use less asparagus next time. This amount worked just fine for one quiche in a regular pie plate. Took about the same amount of time to cook, too.

This one is a keeper.  It is delicious and easy to make.  A huge success at a party.  I make it without the crust as I am low carbing and I have substituted the cheese for the packaged 4 Cheese Blend and it comes out great each time. Freezes nicely too.

This is my 75th review on here so I'm celebrating a bit! ;)  This quiche was excellent.  I cut the recipe in half and pre-baked a 9 in. crust.  Instead of steaming the asparagus, like others, I sauteed them in a little bit of the leftover bacon drippings (saves you dirtying another pan).  I used about 6 pieces of bacon (to please my meat-eating husband), but other than that I was pleasantly surprised that the amount of ingredients actually fit in pie crust.  Baked for the 35 suggested min. and it was perfect.  And I love the addition of the nutmeg!  Will use this recipe in the future, but probably not with my husband, who enjoyed it but still calls quiche 'girly food'.  ;)

This was very tasty & really easy.  I cooked the bacon and asparagus a day ahead.  The next day I assembled the quiche and cooked.  I modified slightly by using 2 refrigerated pie crusts and put them in a 9 X 13 baking dish (overlapping some in the middle of the pan) instead of 2 individual pie pans because I was taking this to a brunch for several people and wanted to be able to cut into square servings.  It was a big hit.  Will definitely make again.

Yummy.  I roasted the asparagus in a little olive oil and a finely chopped shallot in my toaster oven at 500 degrees for 15 minutes.  The asparagus has GREAT flavor that way.  I let it cool a bit before making the quiche.  I also partially pre-cooked two 9" frozen shells for about 10 minutes.  Finally, I used 2 cups of half&half in the recipe, and five eggs (I didn't beat an egg white.)

I baked 2 of these quiches for a PTA brunch I catered last week.  I made a few changes based on previous suggestions.  I sauted the chopped asparagus in butter first & added 2 tbsp finely chopped shallots that had been sauted in butter.  Also, I substituted grilled chicken (cut into small cubes) for the bacon and increased the salt.  The quiche tasted great to those who liked asparagus, while others thought the asparagus taste too strong (I personally liked the taste).  The only problem was a soggy crust bottom (the filling is very moist).  I will blind bake or pre-bake crust next time (for about 10-15 minutes)and cover the crust to avoid burning.  I will try again with bacon!

Great recipe! I modified the recipe just a bit. I just parboiled the asparagus, drained & let it cool. I sauteed the bacon & about 1/2 cup of chopped onions together. When they were just about done cooking, I added the asaparagus to the bacon & onions & sauteed for a minute.  Mmmmmmmm!!

Yet another recipe which attempts to fit 10 lbs. of stuff into a 5 lb. bag... I didn't find a 10-in. pie crust, so I used a 9-in. deep dish pie crust. No way you can fit all the liquid into that, or into the recommended 10-in. one. It always bothers me when I end up with ingredients left over. The end product was tasty, though.

Great tasting, but I think someone was doubling the recipe and only doubled some of the ingredients.  You will find it fits nicely into 1 pie crust if you use 1 lb asparagus, 5 slices of bacon, 4 eggs, 3/4 cup cream, 1/4 nutmeg, and 1 cup cheese.

We love fresh asparagus and indulge in it as often as possible.   Roasting seems to be better, but either way this is a great recipe.   Have a suggestion to replace the bacon and that is to use about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of slivered smoked salmon plus some dill for seasoning.   Thanks for a nice addition to my files.

I made this for a tea party for teenage girls. I was concerned that it might not be well received, but it was gone quickly and we were successful at getting them to eat what can often be an unpopular vegetable. This was my first experience with making quiche and I was thrilled to see how easy it was. I have now made this recipe 4 times and my family loves it. In fact, we've discovered that it's also quite tasty served cold on a hot summer day.

Great recipe as is for special occasions.  I modified it a bit for every day grab and go breakfast.  First I halved the recipe, then used fat free half & half, low fat swiss cheese, 3 pieces of canadian bacon diced, and skipped the crust.  Baked it in a lightly oil sprayed 9" square pan.  When cool I cut it into 9 pieces and individually freeze some and refrigerate the rest.  Then in the AM I just pop a refrigerated piece in the microwave for 30 seconds.  If anyone can recalculate the dietary info, I would be interested in seeing how many calories and fat this version actually has.

I love asparagus and had a ton on hand I needed to use. I made some changes to better fit my diet. I didn't use a crust or bacon. I sprinkled some onion powder and garlic powder on the asparagus before adding the mix. I accidentally put the swiss in the egg mix but I don't think that made much of a difference. The biggest change I made aw that I used 1.5 cups of 4% small curd cottage cheese in place of the cream. This made 2 quiche and one eighth of each pie yields 50 calories! Yum!

I am not a quiche person, but this was quite good.  I had a brunch for Father's Day - made it two days before, put in the fridge, then pulled out an hour before serving to bring to room temp.  Everyone enjoyed.  I had the leftovers for dinner the next night - I would make again.

So easy! I steamed the asparagus the night before, used that great new bacon that goes right in the microwave and used frozen pie crusts.  This recipe made 2-9" quiches.  Friends have asked for the recipe.  Finally, a quiche recipe with no onions... hooray!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband the non egg eater devoured this!  This is a keeper!  The only thing I did add was about 1/2 c onion to give it a kick.  I think next time I will bake the pie crust a few minutes before adding the ingredients too.

I replaced the bacon with baby bella mushrooms (to satisfy my guests who are vegetarian)  and added 3/4c feta cheese along with the swiss. Instead of using 1 and a half cups of milk, I did 1 cup of milk and a half cup of cream. (i actually doubled this recipe and had enough for two 9 in quiches with a cup and a half of mixture leftover). I have a gas range so cook times usually vary for me. 325 degrees for 40-45 minutes did the trick! These were perfect and even men loved it! This is definitely a recipe to keep!!

Delicious quiche. I used canned asparagus instead, and it was awesome. My husband, a gourmet cook, loved it as much as the rest of us did. Thanks Michele!

I made this and honestly, I thought it was just OK also.  I felt like something was missing.  I admit it tasted better the next day. I will try again, maybe I'll sautee the asparagus with onions or garlic next time.  I also used ready to use bacon, only because I don't like hard crumbly bacon.

This was fabulous.  I used buttermilk because I didn't have half and half and it came out fine.  I will use this again and vary the veggies/meat.  Maybe spinach and ham, broccoli, bacon and cheddar.  I used a frozen pie crust and baked it for just a few minutes so it wouldn't be too soggy.

I Made this quiche for an important brunch and EVERYONE was impressed and just loved it.  Super Easy.  I baked them the day before and froze them.  They reheated perfectly and saved me the stress of cooking on the day of the event.  Paired it with Spinich Strawberry Salad... YUM!  All a big hit.

OMG! This was so good.  I used 2 shallow pie crusts (WalMart brand and they were WONDERFUL) I think next time I will use just one deep dish pie shell and maybe add a little chopped green onion and milk instead of half and half.  But it was so good I hate to change anything!  My friend raved about it so much I sent the rest home with her.

I have now made this several times.  Using 1 deep dish and 2 shallow pie crusts.  (WalMart brand frozen and they're awesome!)  I have made it with half and half, made it with 2% milk and made it with skim.  It's all good!

Yum.  Even my meat and potatoes husband raved about it.  I'm guessing those who said the ingredients couldn't fit in the pie shell must not have known the recipe makes 2 quiches.  I found that that pie shells could fit much more, so next time I'll probably try adding an egg.  To save time, I used crumbled bacon in a jar found in the salad dressing section of the grocery store.  I also used whole milk instead of half-and-half.  Turned out yummy!

This has become a family favorite at the holidays. I add a bit of chopped green onion, not only to add extra color, but it seems to bring out the flovor of the asparagus.

This was really good and even my husband who hates quiche liked it.  I did use some of the suggestions from others, for example you can saute the asparagus in the bacon grease and eliminate dirting another pan and I added onion.  It's a nice recipe because you could easily switch up the asparagus for spinach or broccoli or switch the bacon with ham.  Very good!

This was wonderful!  I made only 1 quiche, so I cut the ingredients in half.  I used turkey bacon (5 slices) and fat-free half-and-half to lower the fat.  I added 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. pepper, and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg (but couldn't taste the nutmeg in the quiche).  I accidentally brushed egg on the crust instead of egg white, but it was still pretty!  I did end up adding an extra egg and 1/4 cup fat-free half-and-half because there wasn't quite enough filling.  It puffed up perfectly - not too high and not too low.  I would make all these same adjustments again - turned out wonderfully!  I think I prefer to bake it at 375 - otherwise, the crust gets too done.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing taste.  I made a few of these Easter morning last year for my guests and everyone raved.  I plan on making it a family tradition.  They reheated well too.  Even better the second day!

This turned out way better than I anticipated! I used 1 2.8oz package of Oscar Meyer bacon bits. I also saute'd the asparagus with a little butter & garlic instead of steaming. Using 2 shallow pie shells, it was perfect! The tops got a little too brown- next time I will loosely cover with foil the last 10 minutes. My husband & daughter loved it, too. Thanks so much!

A great vegetarian option is to substitute the bacon with Litelife's Gimme Lean (R) Sausage (ground). Add as much or little as you like. I usually cover the bottom of the pie shell with asparagus, then break off bite-sized pieces of sausage (uncooked) and cover the asparagus with it before adding the egg mixture. Even if you're not a fan of the sausage by itself (which I generally am not), the texture is great in this recipe and provides the necessary salt that would otherwise be generated by the bacon.

I made this for a baby shower luncheon and everyone loved it! The only change I made was the cheese. I used Monterey Jack instead of swiss, because I don't care for swiss cheese. It was delicious. This recipe is a keeper. It did take about 15 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said.

I had everything on hand except the bacon and cream, so I improvised and it was fantastic!  I used 1 cup of 2% milk, and sauteed some low-fat turkey kielbasa with green onion.  I threw it all into one 9-inch pie crust. By default, it was lower in fat and calories, and I will definitely be making it again, just the same.  The flavor was perfect.

I made only a slight change to this recipe to enhance its flavour---I substituted two cups from a pkg of 3 grated cheese (Mozzarella, Cheddar and Jalapeno) instead of the Swiss which I found was too mild for the smokey bacon that can dominate.  Another cheese that could work is Emanthal

LOVED IT! Used 2 9" crusts, and an unscientific 1 1/2 times filling. That worked out perfectly. I highly recommend good quality swiss, and baby asparagus when available for the best flavor. Made it for Christmas Brunch and was asked to make it again this weekend, but why is there always 1 asparagus hater in every group?

Great recipe - I did modify it slightly however.  I used only one premade pie crust and used three eggs and one cup of half and half along with 1 1/4 cups of the shredded swiss cheese.  I did not have the nutmeg on hand so I made it without this seasoning.  Turned out terrific! Thank you.

Excellent way to prepare asparagus!!!  Couldn't find the steamer basket so I boiled the cut up pieces for about 6 minutes.  The grocery store didn't have the shredded swiss that I like so I used the sliced kind and it still came out great.  Next time I'll try a four or six cheese Italian blend just to see what that'll taste like.

I added baked chicken and bacon together, left the grease from the pan add a little olive oil and butter to the pan placed 3 chopped shallots in the pan to sauté until translucent and then add the asparagus top them of with a little more olive oil salt and pepper and placed a lid on top to let them steam for3 mins then took the top off and let them cook for another 5 mins I always take a bite of my veggies until I find the right texture for me. I like what one foodie did they added 2cups of half and half I used land lakes brand . And they added the5 eggs which I did also. Make sure to share  all Ingredients between the two pie shells and enjoy this was a great start for my first quiche. Don't forget eat love live

MMMM!  I'm a newbie at making quiche, and I had to make a few substitutions, but this was still delicious!  I used a mix of goat's milk and kefir instead of the cream, and (real) store-bought bacon bits.  I'm not sure if it made a difference, but the nutmeg I used was freshly grated.  I also steamed the asparagus the night before, and fried up a chopped shallot.  Because the local asparagus season is so short, I'm going to try making this with either spinach, kale, or swiss chard from my garden.  Thanks for sharing, Michele!

First of all thanks to all who submitted reviews for this recipe; that influenced my decision to try the recipe.  I made it for our supper last night- it was DELICIOUS!  Since others were successful with substitutions I used fat free half and half instead of regular.  My grocery only had a small package of shredded Swiss cheese that was a ridiculous price and I wasn't in the mood to shred.  I bought an Italian mix of cheese.  I had 4 slices of bacon left over from this past weekend and didn't want to buy another package so I used some leftover Honey Baked Ham from Easter lunch- about 1/2 cup chopped.  I didn't use nutmeg because I hate the stuff!  I added some garlic powder with the salt and pepper.  We had the quiche with a salad, my husband and I both thought it was wonderful.  The ham gave it a delightful slightly sweet taste.  I usually don't take leftovers for lunch the next day, I usually wait a day but I am having leftover quiche for lunch now!  (and it was hard to wait for lunch, I really wanted it for my breakfast!)  My husband was so excited when I told him there was another whole quiche left!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

A great springtime quiche, must use fresh asparagus.  I will try next time making this with egg whites or eggbeaters to cut down on the cholesterol.  But taste was wonderful.

I made this recipe after reading all of the reviews- in fairness to Michele's recipe I have to say that if you all read her ingredients, it says 2 - 8" pie crusts- which means use 2 pie plates. She was misinterpreted and it's not fair to her for this quiche is wonderful!  thanks for sharing Michele!

I am giving this a rating of 4 based upon my husbands comments.  I detest asparagus and never tasted this quiche, but he loves the vegetable and said this dish was great!

I thought this was sooo good!  I used not quite a lb. of fresh asparagus and I used a whole lb. of bacon.  I did this in a 9x13 pan and made my own pie crust and just pressed it into the pan.  I also used swiss cheese and added a little mozzarella and cheddar too.  Oh-- also instead of steaming the asparagus, after I fried the bacon, I sauteed the asparagus chopped up and a little chopped onion in the bacon grease.  Very very good-- will make this often!

We made this for a dinner party and it was REALLY well accepted. Everyone was floored. It's delicious and a great springtime dish when using fresh asparagus and fancy bacon.  We got our bacon at Whole Foods - it was a dry rubbed bacon that on it's own was the tastiest bacon we'd had in a long time. Get organic asparagus, high quality cheese and bacon, make your own crust, and use organic eggs and you will be in heaven.

Very good! I'm vegetarian, so I omitted the bacon, but you really didn't miss it, I can assure you. Very easy, quite impressive. For me, a keeper!

Wow! This was amazing. I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used cheddar instead. In addition to nutmeg, I added a bit of garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper to the egg/cream mixture. I baked it in a 9 inch square cake pan without the crust.  I will surely make this again, again, and again!

Huge hit at church! I followed the recipe except I didn't use nutmeg,  used Mozzarella cheese and I made those little quiches. I used Pillsbury Pie Crust dough; rolled out the dough and made cut-outs for the muffin pans with a juice glass. I'll be making these again for the holidays. Thanks!

I loved this, and my husband even said, "make sure you rate this good." I made a few changes to make it a little healthier. I used lean turkey cold cuts instead of bacon, and used evaporated milk instead of half and half. I cut the recipe in half, and didn't use the egg white.  I didn't steam the asaparagus. I did add an extra egg and a little extra evaporated milk as it seemed a bit dry and it came out beautifully. The nutmeg is a must!
I'm going to try to freeze this - will update my review when I see how it turns out. UPDATE - YES IT FREEZES WELL!

This was my first quiche too!  Turned out awesome! I am on a low carb diet so I skipped the crust. Also added sauteed onions -- YUM!  according to the half and half label 1.5 cups = 20 carbs.  That, added to the cheese carbs (minimal) and the asparagus carbs (2.5 for 6 stalks), you have a great, easy low carb breakfast.  The fam is nuts about it -- broil some cheese on top for 1 minute if you want a cheese "crust".

Fantastic! I didn't have 2 pie crusts so I used one (btw - that's 880 less calories (per whole Quiche) and 1/2 the CARBS if you are counting like I am) and it came out perfect. This is a great recipe and easy to make. Thank you!

DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS! DELICIOUS!  I tried for a slightly lower fat version by eliminating the bacon and reducing the amount of cheese to a approx. 1 cup (a great Gruyerre from Wisconsin).  I added two pan-sauted, large Leeks (chopped - white tenders only).  I also had some fresh nutmeg, so I reduced to approx. 1/8 tsp as the nutmeg flavor would no longer have to compete with the bacon.   It was absolutely MARVELOUS! and YUM!   Thank you for putting this recipe out there. This has become a new favorite at our house.

I really liked this recipe and will make it again.  I make a couple of wee changes though.  I'm not a huge fan of swiss cheese so I reduced the amount.  Also, I didn't add nutmeg but added chili powder instead but on enough to add a slight bite.I've never made quich before and made this for Boxing Day and it was a hit.  Especially nice after having a huge Christmas dinner the day before.

This was an AWESOME Quiche!!  My family loved it.  I did add a small amount of onion and some mushrooms to it.  Also I cooked the onion and mushrooms along with the asparagus in 2 tbsp. of bacon grease as suggested by other reviewers and it turned out great.   Thank you for a very easy recipe that makes is so good.

We used almost a whole ham steak slice that we diced up instead of bacon. We halved the recipe and made it in a 9" pie pan. The amount of filling was perfect for that size. The cooking time suggested in the recipe was perfect and the flavor of the quiche was delicious! Great recipe!

This was very good.  When I read the recipe I knew for our taste it would need some additions so I went ahead and added some onions, sliced mushrooms and just a little minced garlic.  Is really great for football snack.

I made this for my family. I cut the  size in half. Instead of using 2 eggs I used 3. I used almost a whole pack of bacon! I didn't think 5 pieces was enough and I'm glad I used more! I used a 9 inch deep pie crust instead of a 8 inch. Everyone loved it. Next time i think ill use a little onion for a little more flavor. Very good.

Great recipe, although I made one significant change to it. I didn't have any bacon on hand but had lots of cooked and peeled prawns, so I substituted meat for fish. The other change I made was not using the egg white, since I was only preparing one quiche and didn't think it was worth it. My only qualm with this recipe is it maybe needs the lightest sprinkling of chile or cayenne to really bring out the flavors. All in all, a very easy recipe that is also a crowd-pleaser.

Awesome! Delicious! The only thing I will change next time is I will whip the egg whites alone for a while, it is a little dense. Also, I did not use any nutmeg...

This was one of those nights where I had to use what I had on hand. Replacing bacon with chopped ham, fresh asparagus with canned, cream with evaporated milk, and and swiss with cheddar, this still turned out delicious and I'll use it again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was excellent with a few changes.  I sauted an onion and split it between the two quiches.  This added a lot of flavor.  I also replaced spinach in one of the quiches for the asparagus and it came out great.  I used a combination of real bacon crumbled and real bacon bits, I wish I had used all real bacon though - it was much better.  I also used a combination of monteray jack and sharp cheddar cheeses instead of swiss because I don't care for swiss and that is what I had on hand.  I used pillsbury refridgerated pie crusts and they were great!  I'm definitely keeping this recipe!!

A wonderful recipe! I didn't use bacon, added cooked onions instead. Also, when I make quiche I like to line the bottom and sides of the crust with the cheese instead of mixing it in or putting it on top. I like the texture this gives it. Finally, I used deep dish pie crusts, so I found it was necessary to add an etra egg and 1/3 cup half and half.

My husband and I liked this quiche alot, I used Monteray Jack
cheese and used sliced onions instead of the bacon. I cooked
it at 375 degrees, I thought 400 degrees would be to high and
it came out great! I would definately make it again.

This recipe is incredible!!!  Very easy and delicious.  I added some garlic and black pepper to the asparagus while I steamed them and some onion powder to the egg mixture.  It's very easy.  Just make sure that you know the recipe makes TWO quiches, not one.  One reviewer had left over ingredients but it must have been because she thought it was all supposed to fit into one shell.  Truly a delicious recipe.

I didn't have much luck with this recipe. First off, if I make this again I'll prebake the pie shell. Only the crust on my shell was cooked. I would also chop the aspargus smaller after steaming. It didn't have a bad taste. It just seemed to chunky for a quiche.

I like asparagus, but this recipes doesn't complement it. The bacon todally overpowers it. I wouldn't suggest this to a vegtable lover.

This was a huge hit at our Mother's Day Brunch.  We actually ended up adding more bacon.  One time saver would be to cook the bacon the day before.  That was all that took a little extra time.  Our family rated this "Make again soon!"

Doubled the eggs and added a half cup of milk as did not seem to fill the crusts. Used shredded colby jack cheese and omitted brushing crust with egg white.  Good recipe!  Kids loved it.

This was a good recipe but a homemade pie crust would be better.  I also added leeks to the filling (sauteed in the bacon grease and drained).  I halved the recipe to make one quiche and used 3 eggs.

I only wanted to make ONE quiche, not the 2 that this recipe calls for... so i divided the ingredients in half, and when i went to fill the shells with the liquid (eggs and cream) it was not enough - by FAR. I ended up adding 4 more eggs. I re-read the recipe multiple times thinking i was the one in error, but i really don't think that 2 eggs for one pie shell is nearly enough.

This was very tasty. The only issue I have is the center of the crust came out looking like it was undercooked (no browning on the bottom side) Maybe next time I will either increase the heat at the beginning, or possibly precook the crust a little bit. I added 1/2 tsp salt, and that seemed a little light. It's always hard to know how much when a recipe says "salt and pepper to taste" I'm not tasting raw egg/milk!

I've been making Michele's quiche for several years now, and it's become quite the "go to" recipe.  Very versitile - great with ham or sausage if there's no bacon.  Tried it with Egg Beaters, but didn't care for the texture.  I make only half the recipe & it's perfect for just the two of us. Thank you so much for sharing Michele!

This was delicious.  I roasted the asparagus in the oven with olive oil and salt.  I only made one quiche so I cut recipe in half, I think I used 3 eggs. The bacon did not stay crispy so I will probably use ham next time.  I also did not use the nutmeg.  I love quiche and this did not disappoint!

Very good recipe. Next time I'm planning on using milk instead of half and half and will omit the nutmeg...because it was a bit too sweet for us. Thanks!!

This was awesome for our small Mother's day brunch. I followed others' suggestions of browning the asparagus with the bacon and shallot. I used KC bacon, which is less fat and wider strips. I'd suggest substituting 1/2 of the Swiss cheese with some other cheese with more punch, maybe Gruyere. This is definitely a "do again,"

Turned out perfect. I find it funny that some people rating this recipe say there is too much to go in a pie. If they read the recipe, it is for 2 pies. It says 2 (8 inch)  unbaked pie shells. Not just one quiche

My husband raved. Said it was the best quiche he's ever had. Only one small modification, I sauted the aspqragus with onions in olive oil before putting it in the crust. So easy and delicious!

Great healthy recipe.  I used heavy cream, because I always have some on hand.  I like provolone better than swiss.  Very good flavor.

I love quiche and this did not disappoint. I added a couple more eggs and some mushrooms and used curry instead of nutmeg (personal preference). Very good. The prep time and cooking times were a little off though - took longer on both counts.

My very first attempt at making quiche, and it turned out fabulous! I didn't have a steamer, so I ended up sauteing the asparagus in some of the bacon grease, which added to the overall flavor. I didn't have Swiss, so I just used a pre-shredded four cheese blend. Even my husband had three pieces himself, and he HATES (and I really emphasize the caps) vegetables. He had told me that he would try it but probably wouldn't eat very much, but he ended up eating half of it himself! Great recipe.

Nice quiche. I omitted the nutmeg as I don't like it in savory dishes, used less cream, and added some extra-sharp Cheddar for more flavor. I didn't need to steam my asparagus - it was so tender, I just sliced up the spears, and threw them in. Easy peasy. Thanks, Michele!

I made this last night - it was my first quiche and came out perfect! I did everything as followed, but didn't have any half-and-half on hand so used regular 1% milk. It tasted just fine to my mom and me. The bacon makes it very tasty, and the a slice is filling enough for a quick breakfast fix in the morning before school!

Very easy to prepare. I subbed out real bacon bits and used Eggbeaters instead of eggs and cream. I am sure the results would have been even better but I was very happy with how these turned out. Think I will serve at an upcoming ladies' gathering.

This recipe was great!  I have never made quiche before and it turned out perfect.  I used 1 deep dish crust instead of 2 regular and changed the cheese to a 4 cheese mixture.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Foolproof!

I will definitely make this again. It was labor intensive, but I didn't use any shortcuts: I made my own crust, cooked uncured organic bacon, and shredded my own cheese. It was worth it, though! Thanks for a great spring recipe.

Very good quiche recipe. It's very hearty--makes a great dinner with a salad. I used diced ham instead of bacon, as bacon seems a little too greasy sometimes. Also, I just sauteed the asparagus for a few minutes and then added in the ham, cheese, put it in the pie shell and then added the eggs. Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

This is just as good as the reviews say!  I wanted to use up some of our asparagus that our garden is producing so abundantly.  I doubled it to make 4 9-inch pies and had only 1/2 pie left.  

I cut the asparagus small and steamed it in the microwave for 4 minutes.  Then, I added all the ingredients to a big bowl along with several minced cloves of garlic.  I poured the mixture into the pie crusts and it filled all four perfectly with no leftovers.

It was very easy. I made it for Easter and a week later. The first time I bought Mrs. Smith's pie crust and it was perfect. The second time I bought an offbrand and the crust was doughy. I got rave reviews...my 2 and 3 year olds even ate it.

This recipe was great.  I used mozzarella instead of swiss, as that is all that I had on hand.  It complimented the asparagus really well.  I also omitted the nutmeg.  My husband got one mouthful in and stated that this was abosolutely delicious, and so rich tasting.  Thanks, Michele for a great recipe.

Really good!  This was a hit at Easter brunch.  I used half regular bacon and half turkey bacon - couldn't tell the difference!  Also, I covered the crusts of the pie shells with foil after 20 minutes - I think they may have gotten too dark without it.  Also used a Swiss and cheddar mix.  I will definitely make this again - maybe experiment with different cheeses.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used Marie Calendar's frozen crust, and this turned out really well.  Nothing EXCEPTIONAL, so I only gave it 4 stars, but definitely tasty!  Would be very nice for a brunch.

Excellent recipe, tasted great the next day as well. I did substitute the cream for buttermilk and it was still delicious, but with a fraction of the calories and fat.

This was delicious!  I prepared it as directed and it turned out perfect.  My grandfather had 3 pieces!  I used Marie Callendar's frozen pie shells right out of the freezer and the crust turned out just right.  I would highly recommend, great for a light supper.

After reading all the rave reviews of this recipe I couldn't wait to try it!  I followed some of the suggestions of other reviews and pre-baked the pie shell and then substituted spinach for asparagas (I just thawed the frozen stuff) and cheddar cheese for swiss cheese.  It turned out GREAT!  My first quiche and I looked like a pro!

Made it with finely chopped roasted chicken and microwaved fresh asparagus.  Hubby said, "Well, you can certainly taste the asparagus."  But he said it was good.  I used swiss cheese slices to line the bottom and shredded cheddar in the wet mixture.  A few days later he took a slice to work for lunch and emailed me saying it was the best quiche he'd had in awhile!

Yum...very good! With asparagus coming into season I was looking for a recipe to use it.  This was perfect!  I used shredded chedder and colby cheese instead of swiss and it turned out great.

I used diced ham instead of bacon. I sauted the asparagus in a little butter and then added the ham. Then I layered the ingredients in the pie shell as directed. It was delicious! I served this at a bridal shower, and everyone loved it.

This recipe may be okay for people who need to be on a bland diet but no one at my house cared for this.  I added onion and sprinkled hot sauce over and it still was drab! I would put these ingredients to better use on a different recipe. Sorry Michele..

Last minute pick for a Brunch.  My friends went nuts when they had it.  It was a no brainer to make (which I think is a bonus).  Thank you for sharing this recipe Michele.  I will make it again, no doubt.  * I added more bacon and asparagus too)  YUM!!

This was a terrific brunch dish!  My boyfriend confessed that he didn't think he would like it, but ended up really enjoying it.  I only had 9" pie shells, so I made 1.5 times the recipe and that was the perfect amount for two 9" quiche. To round out the meal, I served the quiche with fruit salad, potatoes & onions, and "To Die For" blueberry muffins...all from ALLRECIPES.com.

Is especially quick if you already have the pie shell.  A little more time consuming if you make your own. My kids hate asparagus but willingly downed this.....

I really enjoyed making this, however, I must agree the liquid is too much.  I did not find 10-inch crust so I used 8-in deep dish and I was able to make 2 quiches with the prescribed amount of liquid.

Delish! I substituted the asparagus for edamame,  and the cheese with 1 cup mexican cheese blend, 1 cup blend of parmesan, asiago, fontina and provolone.  I also added a little dill weed. My boys couldn't get enough!

This was great, I made it for French class, and it's pretty good! I didn't think it was gonna work at first with the amount of milk, but hey what do you know a perfect quiche appears like majic. I didn't think my cooking was that good even if I followed a recipe.

This is very good!  Instead of steaming the asparagus I sautéed it with some garlic in the bacon grease after I fried the bacon.  Also, I am vegetarian so I split everything (except bacon, I halved that) and I made the second one with mushrooms that I sautéed in garlic butter with the remaining asparagus.  I add tarragon to all egg dishes and a bit of cayenne.  Only had lactose-free whole milk but it worked fine!  Would probably be better with the half-half, though!
Thank you for a wonderful Sunday brunch!

Very good; I saute the asparagus with some garlic in EVOO instead of steaming but thats just taste preference. Switched out swiss for old cheddar as well, again taste preference

Delicious.  Like others, used the bacon grease to sauté the asparagus and also sautéed garlic and onions.

YUM!! And so easy! I have to confess to cheating - used 2 cans of drained asparagus (short on steaming time and I've not had much luck with fresh asparagus - comes out tough and chewy, despite extending the steaming time.) Not normally a fan of swiss cheese, but it goes great in this quiche. Did not do the egg white brush (again - short on time) but this was divine tasting!

Did a few things 'my' way but loved the recipe! First: we are doing low carb around here so I went crustless :) second: we always cook our bacon in the oven at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes so since we love roasted asparagus and the oven was heated up already I roasted the asparagus for 5 minutes instead of steaming and then cut it into 1/2 inch pieces. Also, as much as I like cream and half 'n half all I had in the house was 2% milk and truly, that worked just fine, evaporated milk would be okay too I bet. Next time I make this I will saute and add finely chopped onions. My daughter would like to see some ham added in with the bacon! Also, I did the whole thing in a pyrex casserole dish instead of pie plates for 38 minutes. Really tasty. Thank you Michele!

I did not use bacon, but added mushrooms and a bit of spinach.  I sauteed the asparagus, mushrooms and spinach in olive oil the night before.  I also put it all together in a 9 x 13 glass pan that I lined with 2 pie crusts.  I baked it for 25 minutes covered in foil and then baked it another 10 minutes without the foil.  It was a hit!

I made this without bacon, since I had other egg casseroles that contained meat for my Christmas Eve brunch.  Easy to prepare and delicious to eat!  I will definitely make this again and again.  Thank you!

I opted to roast the asparagus with a finely sliced shallot and a splash of extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper.  In addition, I sauteed the bacon with a chopped shallot.  The flavour and texture of this quiche is the best I've had.  If I make a few more with the fresh local asparagus on now, I'm wondering how well this quiche will freeze.  Has anyone tried to freeze one of these yet ?

This was my first attempt at quiche...it was easy and everyone loved it!  I recommend using the fully-cooked bacon-just crisp it in the frying pan...such a time and mess saver.

Outstanding use of garden asparagus.  I used one 9" pie pan for the entire recipe and instead of half and half I used a little over one cup of skim milk.  Baked it about 45 minutes.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it is really good.  I took other reviewers suggestions and cooked some onions and garlic in some of the bacon grease, then cooked the asparagus with them.  Rather than using 2 pie plates, I lined an 8x11 pan with two pie crusts and used the same cooking time and temp. that the recipe calls for.  It cooked perfectly in 40 minutes and was delicious.  This is quick and easy (especially when using store bought crust) and is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Wow!!  A perfect quiche recipe...finally!  :)

I made this for mother's day dinner and everybody devoured it.  I made one bacon asparagus quiche and one smoked salmon and asparagus quiche (as per another reviewer's suggestion).  The salmon one was by far the favorite.  It had a beautiful flavor and it was perfectly cooked.  The asparus was gorgeous in it.

I made a few changes to the recipe.  Instead of the half-and-half, I used sour cream and oat milk.  It worked just fine.  

I will make this again and again!  It was to die for. 

Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Deirdre :)

This is great Warm and cold. VRY easy to make!! Added extra asparagus to mine and everything fit just fine. Also, i do not have a steamer so i cooked the asparagus in a stir fry pan with a little extra virgin olive oil while my bacon cooked (about 10 min on med low heat) Everyone Loved it :-)

Amazing quiche!  I followed this recipe exactly as written for Mother's Day brunch.  My guests loved it, had seconds, asked to take some home and raved that they felt they were at a "country club restaurant".  I made this a day ahead of the party, let it sit out for a half hour before warming it in the oven at 250 for about a half hour.  I distributed the egg mixture evenly over both quiches by spooning the liquid in small amounts over the top of the bacon/asparagus blend.  They appeared to be not quite "full" but after baking were perfect- not overstuffed or heavy. Quiche is French, after all!!!  The quiche "settled" in the refrigerator overnight and was perfect the next day!  Simple and elegant for brunch with a salad, rosemary potatoes and fruit.  I will use this again for entertaining (so easy to make the day before) and may experiment with my own lower fat versions to eat when guests are not here.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This is an excellent quiche!  I used prosciutto instead of bacon and cheddar instead of swiss.  The cooking time is spot on.  The nutmeg is a great touch.  Loved it.  Will make again.

This is a perfect quiche!!  I just kind of "threw in" everything without measuring and it turned out great.  It actually tasted better the next day when I had it for lunch.  I used Gruyere cheese and swiss.

Mmmm! My husband and I had it for dinner tonight, it was really good! I divided the recipe in half and it was just about perfect for a 9-inch frozen pie crust. I didn't have quite enough swiss cheese, so I rounded it out with cheddar. And oh yeah, I lightened it up a tad by using 2% milk instead of the cream. I wish I had read more of the reviews first, because I think adding finely-chopped onions is a great idea. It is delicious without it, though! The asparagus/bacon combo is sooo good, and nutmeg is key!

We enjoyed this with some Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread with my husband's 100 year old Grandfather after a day of snowmobiling and sliding.  It hit the spot and got rave reviews from a man who has had many a meal!  I made one quiche in a 9 inch deep dish pie crust.  I didn't change the amount of asparagus or bacon as written for (2) 8 inches, but I used only 3 eggs and about a cup of half and half.  I'm pretty generous with the salt and pepper and nutmeg as well.

My family loved this dish. It was very easy to prepare with ingredients that are easy to access. I subsituted whole milk for half and half to decrease fat and calories and added a small amount of onions for flavor. Will definitely make this dish again.

This was so fantastic! What a combo of flavors! 
I also cooked the asparagus in some of the bacon grease as others has suggested. 
I used fat free half & half and it didn’t seem to have any effect on the taste! 
I can’t wait to make this again!

A wonderful addition for our Easter Brunch.  It took a little longer to bake then the other quiches I made, but that just means we saved it for last and now I have some leftover for lunch today.

I've made this at least a half dozen times.  It's a tried and tested favorite.  Follow the directions, and you won't be disappointed. Sometimes I saute the asparagus in some olive oil. I love it the way it is, but my sister substitutes with spinach, ham, etc.  Even better the next day!

I thought that this was just so-so, although my husband and daughter liked it a lot.  I used turkey bacon and swiss cheese but if I make this again I may try a sharp cheddar cheese.  I did agree with some other reviwers that it was a little bland, so I would probably add some fresh garlic if I make it again.

Made this one along with another one I found on this web site for my wife's friend's bridal shower and it got rave reviews.  There was none left when the party eas finished so I never got to actually try it.  I made it crustless because the bride to be is allergic to gluten and it came out great.  I also used fat free half and half and they still loved it.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I've tried several quiche recipes now and this one seems to of went over the best at the office.  Everyone asked for the recipe! Instead of Swiss Cheese I used Sharp Cheddar, I feel Sharp Cheddar and Bacon are just a match made in heaven.  Also I added a 1/4 cup cheese for each pie and left out the salt.  Thanks for the YUMMY recipe!!

Is there a six (or a ten)? 
     With my elf's appetite I devoured half a pie. Just remember a pound of asparagus yields 1/2 to 3/4 after snapping off the stringy ends and adjust accordingly. 1/2 lb. of finished product does one 8" pie. I subbed turkey bacon and added the leftover brushing white and yolk to two eggs.That lowered the oven time to 25 - 30 min. BEAUTIFUL!!! A real keeper. Thanx, Michelle

I have never made a quiche, and this made me look like a pro.  I followed the recipe, and it turned out great!  Made it for a Mother's Day luncheon.  I made it late Saturday night, then covered it and left it out over night.  It was the perfect temperature by Sunday morning.

1) Do not add salt to the eggs & cream! There's plenty of salt in the crust, bacon, and cheese already.
2) Chopped pancetta works better than bacon.
3) Of course, a handmade crust is far better than a packaged crust.

I did not use a pie crush, just oiled my pan well. 
Did not use bacon either. Not sure how you would taste the nutmeg if I had.
I used thawed asparagus spears. I should sponge dry them and should  have cut them. Hard to cut after it cooked.
Very tasty. Loved the nutmeg taste.

I made this last night, and it’s pretty good. Personally, I like firm asparagus. For that reason, I didn’t bother pre-cooking my asparagus whatsoever, and it came out just the way I like it. The only change I’d make in the future would be to switch out the cheese type. Swiss is cool and all, but I thought this quiche could benefit from a nice Gruyere and more pepper (my fault). Like some of the other reviewers, I kept 4 or 5 asparagus spears intact for decoration on the top. Having those bigger chunks of veg really helped this dish, and I’d suggest y’all do that with your quiche. ??

Pros:  fluffy quiche - the eggs were delicious! 
Cons:  a little bland. The asparagus did not have much flavor.  I wish I had read earlier reviews and sauteed an onion or shallot to add - I think that would have pepped it up a bit.  Good basic recipe that I will tweak the next time.

Have made this many, many times.  Everyone in the family loves it and if we are vacationing in a spot where we have a kitchen it’s always requested.   Simple to make and great taste just like it is.  Sometimes I’ll add mushrooms but only if I’ve got them handy.

I made this with homemade crust and we liked it a lot. For 2 pies it seems like it may need another couple of eggs. I like the ideas others shared to roast asparagus, add onion or shallot, etc.. Also, I'd like to try it with ham instead of bacon. Good recipe as is though. Thanks for sharing!

I made two of these one for Sweet Wife and myself and one for a "Pie of the Month" I bake. We very much enjoyed ours, but if I made it again I would add some  onion and/or peppers to the filling.

Reviewer Cyndi roasted the asparagus in olive oil & fine-chop shallot in her  toaster oven @ 500 / 15 mins. She says the asparagus has GREAT flavour that way. Let cool before making the quiche. To eliminate soggy bottoms, partially pre-cook two 9" frozen shells for about 10 mins. And, Cyndi used 2 cups half&half and five eggs (says she didn't beat an egg white).

So delicious! Made this almost exactly as is, the only difference being that I added the yolk (from the egg white) to my egg mixture. My boys had seconds, and one had thirds! Served with a crunchy salad and fresh sliced strawberries.

Made this four a small get together. The change I made is that I used frozen asparagus that was left out to thaw. This was done because I didn't care for the fresh which were either shoe string or huge and I felt would effect the consistency. The frozen worked great and saved me work since they came precut. It was a hit!

I used this recipe as a base, which means I have to give it five stars or it just isn't fair!  I substituted the bacon for 1 cup of canned duck confit (just the meat - the rest will be used used for other decadent purposes), and the Swiss cheese for a Boursin cream cheese that I needed to use.  I used two store bought crusts, overlapped a bit in a glass pie plate to make one crust.  I baked the egg-white brushed crust for 10 minutes at 450, then allowed it to cool for 10 minutes.  The ingredients for the recipe made one perfect deep-dish quiche, filled to the brim but not overflowing.  Simple but yummy.

This was excellent.  I had one frozen pie crust, so I only made half a recipe.  I used 8 pretty large stalks of asparagus.  I drizzled it with olive oil and roasted it for a few minutes in the oven, before putting it in the pie shell.  I baked the frozen pie crust for just a few minutes before adding the filling.  I didn't bother with brushing it with egg white.  I used 2 extra large eggs and 3/4 cup half and half.  Next time, I might use three eggs to fill the shell a little more.

I love this recipe! It was super simple to make and came out great! I did make one change that another of the reviewers recommended; I sauteed the asparagus in the bacon grease rather than steaming. I also used Wright's Bourbon Barrel Bacon which gave it a little different flavor. Next time I make it, I don't plan on adding the salt before cooking it; with the bacon in there, it was super salty. I will definitely make it again though!

Made according to recipe.  It was easy and delicious.  Used pet ritz pie shells, but didn't use the deep ones.  Like the crust to filling ratio of the shorter, original ones.

I used mushrooms instead of bacon. Also whole milk instead of cream. Didn't bother using egg white on bottom of crust. Finished product was a little watery next time I will cook mushrooms in pan till tender to remove some water. Flavor was great. Everyone loved it. Will make again with the mentioned change. Yummy

The only modification I would suggest is perhaps using a stronger cheese.

The first time I made this according to recipe instructions and it was good. Tonight I made it again but made some changes. Added 5 eggs & 1/2 c. of milk to the half and half to make it a full 2 cups. In the same skillet that I fried the bacon in after pouring off some of the drippings, I sauteed some onion, along with the asparagus and a clove of minced garlic. One quiche I added a small can of mushrooms the other I didn't as my son doesn't like mushrooms but the rest of us do. They were both delicious. A lot more flavor than steaming the asparagus. The recipe made 2 beautiful & delicious quiches.

This is my go to quiche recipe but I can never figure out how much salt and pepper to put in it.  Those two ingredients are pretty important in a quiche and I totally get that different people like different amounts but asking someone to "salt to taste" in a baked egg recipe is very frustrating for the cook.  I cook a LOT and I still sometimes get it wrong.  I can't imagine being an amateur cook with that kind of direction.

For vegetarian readers: this recipe leans heavily on the bacon for flavor. So, you need to compensate for its omission. In my case, I used half Swiss and half smoked Gouda. I also added some garlic powder, onion powder, spicy mustard and cayenne pepper to the egg mixture. I was short on egg mixture, and had to beat two extra. Perhaps I had small eggs? Whatever the case,  excellent base recipe; you can easily swap out ingredients for new quiches.

Loved this recipe!  Did not use bacon as we do not eat meat.  Roasted the asparagus with red onion and garlic (per a review on here) for extra flavor to compensate for the lack of bacon.  It was delicious.  I also substituted about half of the half and half with milk.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I halved the recipe for one quiche, used half and half instead of cream and only used 1/2 cup rather than 3/4 cup. I had freshly picked asparagus with lots of water content, so I cut the liquid a bit.  Delicious and beautiful!

Excellent!   I put ham in instead of bacon since that is what I had. Turned out fine. I chopped it up and fried it a bit while the asparagus was cooking and while I was putting the crust in the quiche pan. I also cut the recipe in half...only wanted one quiche. Will definitely make again when fresh asparagus is in season.

My boyfriend made this recipe for brunch. He is inexperienced in the kitchen and the quiche turned out delicious- I definitely recommend it. He used two 9 inch pie crusts and it turned out just fine.

Wonderful and very easy.  Like a lot of people, I made some adjustments.  First I roasted the asparagus, a quarter of an onion, clove of garlic and half of a tomato.  I cut everything after the roasting process and, sans the tomato, put it in the bottom of the pan prior to adding the egg mixture - in accordance with the recipe.  I added the roasted tomato, cut into good sized chunks, on the top the last 5-10 minutes of baking.  Also, did not have any bacon on hand so I substituted with prosciutto.  Finally, I added just a touch of dried thyme to the egg mixture.  Awesome!

OMG, what an excellent quiche!  Looked just like the picture and so yummy!  I added a little sautéed mushrooms/onions as others suggested, and used a mix of Swiss and Jack/Cheddar blend.
Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe just as it is.  It also leaves plenty of room to play with - using different ingredients, etc.  I never made a quiche before I made it last night for supper.  It went over real big, and this morning there is only one piece left.  I didn't have enough Swiss cheese so I finished off with mild brick.  Next time I'll be sure to use all sharper Swiss. I also didn't have bacon for it, and I think it would have been better yet with it.  I used whole milk because I didn't have half and half (can you tell I didn't plan to make this?).  I might have put too many eggs in it - I put 5 eggs plus the yolk from the egg white.  I can see not making it with the crust because I really wasn't noticing the crust.  Be careful - I think I cooked it too long - about 40 minutes.  I really didn't make changes - I modified to keep from going to the store:)  Great recipe, and thanks so much for sharing.

This is the ONLY quiche recipe I use. It's SO good. Sometimes I switch out the filling/cheese with other things, but as long as you keep the egg/half&half ratio the same, it will turn out every time.

aah.. all I have to say is.. I can't cook and I made Christmas magic with this recipe!  I was sceptical of the nutmeg. not a problem it was lovely. I was sceptical of the amount of eggs, 4 really? not an issue, I was sceptical of it making two, and viola! it was awesome!  I used extra bacon, but what does that hurt? just your cholesterol! exactly... it was my first quiche, and not my last thanks to this recipe! I made it as per instructions and it turned out perfect.

OMG, this was delicious. I used 1/2 cup H&H and a cup of lactose free 2% milk because I had it on hand. I also used 8 slices bacon and omitted nutmeg b-cuz I didn't have any in cupboard. Came out delicious and am taking extra pie to work as a breakfast treat. We will be making this again soon!

Delicious and easy recipe!  However, I ended up having to add four more eggs and about 1/2 c. more half and half to be able to fill up my pie crusts, even after I already put in a lot of filling of ham, spinach, onion, and cheese!

Other than it being a little salty - I will omit the salt next time as the bacon supplies enough of it, it was very delicious.  In addition, I will also experiment with a less sharp cheese.  I expected the strong flavors, but next time I will try a more milder cheese.  Very good pie!

This was my first attempt at making quiche. it was extremely easy to build and turned out superb! I added a bit more cheese as people suggested and a few more pieces of asparagus. All in all this dish is easy, tasty and pretty to serve at any function.

Very good! Cooked the asparagus and bacon ahead of time, and made the pie shell, then just mixed up the eggs and put it together for quick bunch prep.  Great recipe!

So quick, so easy. I had no Swiss cheese so just a mild cheddar was tasty as well.

Egg-cellent!  Used half swiss and half cheddar.  Next time I might add a couple more eggs and a little more cream in order to fill pie shells, as I couldn't find any smaller ones as called for in recipe.  Very good and very easy.

Rather than two quiches, I made this using one 9in pie plate, which worked perfectly. I also used turkey bacon and fat free half and half to lighten up the fat content a little. It was as delicious the next day as it was fresh out of the oven!

I made this as directed by the recipe.  So, so good.  It made two quiches.  My husband and I consumed an entire one for dinner last night and had leftovers for today.  I'm sure it would be great to subsitute broccoli and cheddar or maybe shrimp/crab, red pepper and mozzarella.  Really, this recipe lends itself to numerous variations (which I plan to try).  Quick, delicious and a beautiful presentation.

This is a great go-to quiche recipe.  Very few ingredients and also affordable to make.  I just made this for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a hit.  I even accidentally bought deep dish pie crusts and it still turned out great.  This is a keeper!!

All in all, this is a good recipe; the temperature and baking time were perfect for my oven.  Of course the amount of egg custard wasn't quite right for my pans, but to be honest, I haven't found a quiche recipe yet that fit perfectly - I think it depends on your pans and how full you fill them.  I made an 8 inch round quiche and a 9 inch square quiche, and ended up using twice as many eggs as called for and just shy of twice the liquid, but we tend to like our quiche on the firm side.  Great combination of flavors; I roasted the asparagus and went a little light on the bacon since we're not huge bacon fans.

Great dish! This lost a star because the egg/cream mixture wasn't quite enough to fill both pie shells, so I had to whip up another batch of the egg mixture; otherwise, this was excellent. Inspired by an asparagus quiche from a local restaurant, also added corn to this recipe and it was delish.

Thought this was a very good recipe. Then combinations of asparagus, bacon and the swiss cheese created a great tasting quiche. Will be a recipe that I will make often.

Not a good day.  I didn't realize I was out of cheese, used BacoBits instead of real bacon, and had 1% milk instead of half-and-half cream. I was so off from the original recipe I can only give it three stars. Well, at least I got dinner on the table and you've learned what NOT to do.

This wasn't bad.  I substituted egg start for the eggs and used turkey bacon to cut down on the cholesterol.  It is a bit too moist but I'm not sure how to correct that.

This was very good.  I only had 1 cup half-and-half so used 1/2 cup 2% milk.  I made this in my ceramic pie pan (I'm not sure of the size but bigger than 8") and all of the ingredients fit.

I usually make this with the modifications suggested by other users, but have recently noticed that this is not a healthy option :(  
So I'm giving it 3 stars for great in taste, but low in health.

This was a good quiche that the company we made it for on new year's day liked it as well.  We did leave off the crust and used veggie bacon instead of regular bacon.  I might use cheddar as suggested by another reviewer next time because I am not a big swiss fan.

WOW! I have NEVER cooked asparagus before this, thought I didn't like it.  But I am in an organic produce co-op and we got fresh asparagus so I thought I would try this. It was GREAT! I used mozerella cheese, it don't care for swiss and omitted the nutmeg, none on hand.  I thought about doing it 'crustless' but I had a frozen pie crust in the freezer and prebaked it while cooking the bacon and asparagus. My husband and my picky 3 year old ate it too!  Can't wait to make this for a brunch or something.

They gave it rave revies, so I guess it was yummy!

I made this for Easter brunch.  It was good with the asparagus.  The filling amount, though, was way too little for 2 pies.  I should have used the whole amount in one deep 9 or 10 inch pie crust.

Really delicious - and with the new bacon that's already cooked, it's a snap to make.  What a treat to have one to eat and one to freeze!

Made this recipe awhile back and didn't get a chance to rate it...it was Excellent! Loved it so much I'm making it again this Easter Sunday for brunch. Added a 1/2 cup more of cheese. Yum!

I was expecting a great quiche from all the reviews but was rather disappointed with the flavor. I added onions, yellow squash, cayenne pepper and garlic salt and it still didn't taste great. The only way this dinner was saved was by putting some ranch dressing on top!

Terrific tasting quiche. The adults loved it, but the kids still wouldn't even try it. Must be something about the word, "asparagus."
