Really delicious!  Potato tacos is one of my faves, and as a vegetarian really makes things more interesting.

I had leftover russet potato dices that I used, and I just used straight mexican cheese shredded mix, instead of the truffle stuff.  This recipe definitely needs a more interesting cheese than what I used, but it was still delicious.  Will absolutely make again.  So easy and yummy
