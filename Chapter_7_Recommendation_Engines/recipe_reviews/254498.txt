7.16.19 Simply couldn’t resist substituting almond extract for the vanilla to accentuate the cherry flavor even more and would do that again.  I didn’t have time to make the crust portion of the recipe, so I just used pre-made crusts from the supermarket.  Forgot to scoop the cherries out of the syrup with a slotted spoon and then add to the crus, so it was a little runny, but that’s not the recipe’s fault.  The cherries were  pleasantly sweet and oh-so-tender.  Haven’t made a cherry pie for a couple years, and we thoroughly enjoyed this.
