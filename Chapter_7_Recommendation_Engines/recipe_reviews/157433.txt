It was my families first time with lengua and we are impressed.  This recipe probably has a lot to do with our liking it.  I used chilli peppers in place of jalapenos because the kids can tolerate it a lot better.  We turned into tacos as well, with my husbands homemade salsa with tomatoes, jalapenos, cilantro, onions, lemon juice and garlic powder.  I even chased the kids with the tongue before cooking, and they still liked eating it!!

My husband loves Lengua. We are currently in Hanoi Vietnam and I though why not while we are here to try this dish. I was about to get FRESH beef tongue which I think made the dish good. Instead of cooking the tomatoes, jalapenos separte I cooked it with the tongue and I added 1 cup of chicken broth. He said it was just like the kind he would get in his favorite restuarant in Texas. I have friends here now wanting the recipe. This is a keeper. :)

This is a tasty recipe.  Try adjusting the cooking time and substituting with smoked tongue instead. Or better yet, apple wood smoke the tongue yourself.  Simply delicious.  Added a little fresh thyme, bay leaf, when cooking the tongue. Served the dish over rice, but I expect it would also be good with a side of boiled potatoes or over french fries.

I cook it over night in a crock pot. It comes out super tender in the morning (8-9 hours on low)!!Boil it with a small onion,  jalapeno, serrano,  tomato, a couple of bay leaves, salt, garlic salt, bouillon. Make sure you add plenty of salt to the water that way the meat can have a lot flavor. Shred and serve in tacos.

Thank you so much for your recipe.  I like lengua. They make the best tacos.  Also, you can slice the meat after it is cooked and skin removed and fry in a little oil with slice onions, and chopped tomatoes, minced fresh garlic, salt and pepper. Serve with mexican rice and pinto beans.  and of course flour or corn tortillas. You can also add 1 hot serrano chopped into tomato and onion mixture.  thanks again for a great recipe

This is delicious! So tender and tasty. I've made your recipe at least four times in the past couple years, usually for tamales. After the tongue's done simmering, I just add sauteed onions and spices like cumin, onion, and garlic powder. Any tips on how to use the leftover spicy salted beef broth? I have so many containers of it in my freezer!

It certainly took a long time to brine, but this was an excellent recipe and we all loved it!  It's so tender! The only change I made was to decrease it to 2 jalapenos so the kids would eat it.

I remember wrinkling my nose when my mom used to get lengua on Sundays. Once I tried it, that was a different story.
Cooking method only: This recipe makes an awesomely flavorful lengua (beef tongue)! I thought the amount of salt seemed like too much, but it is perfect. 
I didn't have any jalapeno peppers but I did add some celery to make a wonderful broth (now I have tons of yummy beef broth in my freezer for future use!!).
I also cooked it in the crockpot for about 8 or 9 hours on low heat.
I only followed direction #1 because I needed the meat to be drier to make into gorditas (my recipe uses different liquid/spices). I can't wait to serve this to my family! They are going to love it (I wonder how they are going to react when I tell them what it actually is...lol).
I have no doubt that they will still ask for it again and again!

I thought cooking tongue was harder than it was.  The skin came right off.  My son liked this and he is the picky one.  I used diced tomato with jalapenos as I didn't have any jalapenos on hand.

This was a really good recipe. I didn't change anything other than cooking mine just a bit longer since it was on the larger side. I served it on soft fried corn shells =)

Excellent recipe but for those that don't like the heat cut back to one jalopeno.

I have made tongue many times but cooking it down with the salsa made it a family favorite. We don’t like very spicy food so I removed the seeds from the jalapeños before boiling them. Great flavor with very little heat.

My husband and step-dad LOVED this recipe! Taking the membrane off took more work than I thought, but was still not bad to do. We made them into tacos using corn tortillas and served with a side of rice. My kids thought it tasted like pork and we ate it all up. Thanks for the recipe!

I grew up with my grandma and mom adding raisins to sweeten their lengua but I prefer this traditional taste over the sweet any day.  My man cringes at what it is and my son knows what it is and loves it! It's totally worth the time and effort to make. I'm going to try and make a small batch of enchiladas with it.

Taste is great, my issue is the texture of the meat, but I don't think that has anything to do with the recipe. Very good.
