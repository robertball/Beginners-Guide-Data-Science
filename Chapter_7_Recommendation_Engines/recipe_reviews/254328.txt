Turned out great! Super easy and you don't need a ton of ingredients.  I made it exactly as described, but 35-40min was a little long as it began to stick in the pan.  I added extra milk a couple times throughout and stirred in order to thin a little and further prevent sticking to pan. Served with mash potatoes and quick cooking crescent rolls.  Easy family meal serving 4 people!

I made these and I was very satisfied with this recipe! The only changes I made was I added a little more Worcestershire sauce & less sour cream. I will be making these again!! So easy & satisfying.

Really good!  As others suggested, I sliced 6 portobello mushrooms and sautéed them with the garlic and onions. I thawed the meatballs in the microwave so it was only necessary to cook the sauce about 15 minutes. It was a bit thick so I added 1/4 c beef broth and a generous amount of cracker black pepper.  Nice stick-to-your-ribs meal.

I made this using frozen mushroom and swiss meatballs. I added a little extra sour cream (used @ a cup  and a quarter) and egg noodles. It was delicious! My husband loved it and wants me to make it again soon.

I made this last night and couldn't eat it fast enough. I subbed the beef with Gardein's vegetarian meatballs (because duh). The meatballs were too spicy, so I'll have to quarter them to soak up the sauce while it's in the refrigerator. I thought the Worcestershire sauce provided just the right flavor. Once served, I topped mine with some parsley. I will DEFINITELY be making this again. Maybe next week to use the other half of the egg noodles!

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe. I did make some changes based on the reviews: +mushrooms, +better than bouillon beef base, +extra milk, +extra sour cream, and I used De Cecco Cavatappi for the pasta (nice and al dente). My family loved it so much that 2 out of the 5 of us had leftovers for breakfast!

This was a great week night dinner! I think if I did this again I would brown the meatballs before adding to the sauce. Not a drop left!

Great recipe! I opted for home made meatballs in place of packaged and ditched the canned soup. 16oz of heavy cream with 8oz package of baby portabello in place of it. Just added the mushrooms to the onion/ garlic step and heavy cream to the liquid step. To make up for the thickness I added equal part cornstarch/cool water mix to Stroganoff and instant desired thickness achieved! Of course a little more salt will be needed as well.

I made as directed, but needed more, bc it reduced down to a paste. I simply added these ingredients - ½ cup more milk, ½ cup more sour cream, ½ block of cream cheese, and 1 beef bullion cube. It went from a paste to *sauce* in just a few mins, and tasted BRILLIANT. I used a 26oz bag of Target brand (Market Pantry) Frozen beef meatballs and used ½tsp Onion powder instead of chopped. (The batch with sweet onion was bland.) Used store brand for the rest.
This included recipe ideas from Crock-Pot Meatballs Stroganoff with the bouillon and cream cheese.

Quick and tasty.  I'll make it again but probably not with all beef meatballs. I like the Armour frozen pork/chicken mix meatballs and I want to try that.

I used penne pasta instead egg noodles [b/c I don't like egg noodles].  I also substituted some steak sauce and soy sauce for the worchestershire sauce [because I didn't have any in stock].  Last, I added about a 1/2 cup of beef broth to the sauce mixture to thin it out and add more flavor. It was really good!

It was exactly what I was looking for.  I added a bunch of sliced mushrooms as recommended by someone else - good addition.  I also added a dash of brandy for a bit of depth. Yummy, easy, comfort food.

I added mushrooms while sautéing the onions and garlic which made the dish feel heartier. I would also use less sour cream next time, and I added a good amount of black pepper. Delicious though and easy. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Sounds extremely yummy! Have to  make it next; when I want a meatball dish.
