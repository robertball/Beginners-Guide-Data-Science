This is very good! It tastes like a really good sangria! I made this by the glass using 2oz. Rum, 2oz. dry red wine, 4oz. red fruit punch, 3 oz. club soda, 1/2 tsp. fresh lime juice, 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice...and I served it in a wine glass instead of a "red plastic cup"! After drinking a couple of these you will feel "loopey"...as we call it! It really does sneak up on you, so be careful!

This punch is VERY strong.  I had to add an extra jug of cranberry juice to make it at least not flamable!  My guests definately enjoyed it once I added the cranberry though.  A friend of mine poured herself a glass before I added the cranberry and you could smell the alcohol from 5 feet away...

This is definitely not for anyone who can't hold their liquor.  Adding cranberry juice enhances the drink immensely.

We tried this punch for Christmas party for our neighbors.   
   For the rum we used Bacardi Gold 40% alcohol and not the 151 proof which is 75% alcohol.  I believe there is no need to use the high potent rum.
   It is a fun punch to drink that does give you that buzz early on.  It became very popular at our little gathering.   I still can't imagine going with a higher proof rum

This stuff was great!  In anticipation of being snowed in this weekend, I thought this would be fun to make since we would not be going anywhere.  My husband and I both LOVED it!  It goes down really easy, so you need to be careful since it is quite potent.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and wouldn't change a thing.  We are both looking forward to making it on a hot summer day, but it made our snow bound weekend much more tolerable!

SPOOLEY IS COOLEY! Made this punch for New Year's Eve, and it's our new year-round favorite. We used Meyer's Rum--can't even imagine the wallop it would pack with a 151 rum!

This was SO disappointing. I added lots more fresh lemon, and orange juice, along with more wine and lemon-lime soda. It was still marginal.

I had to have this punch at my party, for the name alone!  I didn't use the lemon juice, but I used a medium bottle of lemon-lime seltzer and a big bottle of ginger ale ao my guests wouldn't get too "spooley."  It waws a hit.  Thanks, Daddy Charles.

Good stuff. I made it first with Cranberry/ pomegranite juice that I had on hand. Wasn't crazy about it. Went a got the fruit juice and it made a huge difference. Thanks for the post. I will be using this one frequently. Thanks also to Lillian for posting the "by the drink" measurements.

Sounds way too sweet with that fruit punch in it, most of those are almost sugar water.

These were good.  We didn't make a huge amount of these instead we made them by the glass, as reviewer Lillian suggested. After two of these, we couldn't remember the name of them and we were calling them "Uncle Charlies Sloopy". FAIL! -HA, but that is its new name in my house.  We made them again the next night and added a splash of pineapple juice on the top which I liked even better.  This will make a great summer drink.

We did not really care for this - perhaps it was the punch we used, but it tasted too sweet.

Always on the lookout for fun new cocktails, I thought I'd try this. I thought it was OK and my friend thought they were good, so did her husband.  The chianti was a little heavy for me, but that's just how red wine is for me.  I added orange juice and a splash of Ginger Ale to some of the leftovers - much improved that way in my opinion.  Gave it more of a "punchy" taste.  It was a fun recipe to try!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was fabulous.  It was a "girls night", so we didn't care about getting "spooley".  I think that the idea of an extra bottle of soda would be a good idea for more tame crowd.

I made this for Chirstmas and it was really great! It made a lot more than I thought, too. It felt like we all took a step back into time, too! (until the next morning!) Thanks for the recipe!
