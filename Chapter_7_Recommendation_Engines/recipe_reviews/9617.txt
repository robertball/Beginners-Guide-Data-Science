I made this recipe for Christmas & everyone just loved the cookies.  I also put a homemade frosting on top of them & they were even better... Mix about 1 1/2 sticks of soften butter & about 3 cups of powdered sugar until creamy.  Add a 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of vanilla & stir in some milk, about 1-3 tbs until desired texture. The frosting should taste creamy not powdery.  Happy baking!!

This is a great recipe, it is easy and makes a lot of cookies.  This is like a butter cookie but not as delicate.  I made them for a party and they were a big hit.  I will make them again, thanks!

I was SO prepared to give these a lacklustre review. "Unadorned," they are flat tasting and not sweet enough.  My suggestions were to be to add  more vanilla, upped at least to a tsp., a little salt, maybe a 1/2 tsp., to make the flavors come alive, and maybe even a little more sugar.  They are tender and soft, with the characteristic light texture I've come to know that the combination of powdered sugar, oil and cream of tartar provide.  I was going to be generous and give them three stars - but as is I really didn't think they were even THAT good.  But then I frosted them. What a difference a little sweetness made, especially creamy, buttery sweetness! In fact, I would say this cookie is not  only better frosted, it is the *perfect* cookie to frost!  For the same reasons I had ambivalent feelings about them before they were frosted, are why I loved this cookie frosted, tho' I still would add a litte salt.  In addition to these being the perfect "utensil" for "Butter Icing for Cookies," also from this site, they are simply gorgeous as well. The dough is quite soft (almost greasy, actually) so I chilled it for an hour or so before shaping it into cookies.  I used a medium cookie scoop and flattened them slightly before baking. Perfectly shaped when they went into the oven, they were perfectly shaped when they came out of the oven as well. With spring fever in full tow, after frosting I sprinkled them with pastel sugars.  These are just awesome 5-star good - WITH the frosting.

Great cookie recipe!  Reminds me of pecan sandies w/out the pecans.  My mother stopped by & said these were the best cookies.  She doesn't even care for cookies.  I had to use butter flavored Crisco b/c I didn't have any butter.  It still turned out great though!  My mother & I will both be making these again.

These are fantastic!  Buttery and not too sweet.  Was a hit with the family - mostly the women.  The men preferred the sweeter cookies I baked.  Excellent addition for a 'holiday variety'.  Keep the baking time to the bare minimum so as to keep them soft.

I thought these cookies were good and very quick to put together and cook.  I decided to add a lime glaze over the top and they were terrific.  I took them to work and everyone went crazy for them, even the men asked for the recipe.

These cookies melt in your mouth and are easy to mix up.  They must be bad for you because they taste SO GOOD!  People rave about the lightness and flavor, so this is a thumbs up recipe!

I thought these were pretty good. They taste like a combination of a sugar cookie and a shortbread cookie. I made a 1/2 recipe to try them out and it made plenty, over 30 cookies. For some reason they don't taste as good the next day as fresh, and break easy, so I would consider that when calculating how much to make. I used salted butter as I always do, although it didn't specify. I am glad I did because a few people said they felt the cookies were missing salt. I baked them on parchment paper instead of the greased sheet and scooped them with a 1 Tblsp. cookie scoop. I thought they looked just like the Allrecipes photo for the recipe, thanks.

Simply divine. These are probably one of the best sugar cookies I've ever made. Wonderful texture, so crisp and light. I used unsalted butter and therefore added some salt (1/2 tsp.) and they came out just perfect. I rolled them into balls and baked them until lightly brown on the bottom. As soon as I took them out of the oven, I flattened them out slightly with the back of my spatula. This gave them a nice crackled look. They don't need frosting, but I frosted them with "Butter Frosting" from this site and the combination is, like I said before, simply divine.

There was something missing in these cookies (Maybe salt?). The oil overtook the butter and you can not taste the butter. It tasted sugary and eggy. I will definitely not be making these again.

This is kind of a mix between a shortbread cookie and a sugar cookie. It is now perhaps my favorite cookie. Amazing! I made it with whole wheat flour, and it was still wonderful. I use whole wheat with everything though, so I'm used to the flavor. I will use white flour when making for other people. I didn't have cream of tartar, so I substituted 3 times as much vinegar as a substitute.

We found these cookies very bland, I added some flavored frosting or we would never have eaten the entire batch.  Okay with the frosting but still not a recipe I will make again.

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I added 1 cup of skor toffee bits, and the dough was a bit crumbly so I rolled it into 1 inch balls and flattened slightly. They tasted buttery a little like shortbread, and not too sweet. Perfect anytime cookie!

Though this cookie looked pretty and held its shape through the baking process, I did not find the taste or texture likable. Perhaps it was the confectioner's sugar and oil as those were the things I tasted. After baking one batch I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla looking for flavor but that didn't remedy the blandness.

Very Light & Delicious!! I cooked the first batch for 9 minutes which burnt the bottoms.  For the second batch I cooked for 7 minutes and did not greese the cookie sheet as the dough already has enough butter to keep the cookies from sticking to the pan.  This turned out very well.

I loved these cookies!  I halved recipe exactly but next time I think I will try to cut the oil/butter a little bit.  They didn't taste oily but I would like to cut the fat a bit next time.   They tasted like a cross between a butter and a sugar cookie, not bland but not too sweet either.  Exactly how I like my sugar cookies!   I prepared the dough the night before and placed on cookie sheets in the freezer.  Then baked a sheet of them before cooking dinner, now I have another sheet to cook on another day! I will definitely be baking these often!
Follow-up:  I have made these by cutting butter in half and they were wonderful and in my opinion made them evem better, not as greasy.  Next time I only used 1/4 of the amount of butter and these were ok but I would stick with cutting butter in half from now on....they really are better this way!

I halved all the ingredients but followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked for just 8 minutes on a Pampered Chef stoneware bar pan.  The cookies just melted in your mouth and with every cookie I ate, I enjoyed them more and more...

A mix between a sugar cookie and a butter cookie, kind of crumbly but not too much. Not the greatest thing to look at but sure beats ALL the sugar cookie recipes I have made from this site.Tastes somewhat like Mantecaditos a yummy cookie from PR. I will try shaping them like mantecaditos and adding non pareils on top next time.

This is a wonderful recipe!  Very easy to put together.  Took them to a workshop, and they disappeared quickly.  Plus, everyone at work wanted the recipe.  This one is definitely a keeper!

These are delicious and they're a new family favorite. They are like a cross between a sugar cookie and a shortbread cookie. VERY simple to make. VERY easy to dress up! I stuck a chocolate covered caramel candy in the center of each cookie in one batch and they were delicious. I frosted another batch and they were delicious as well. Plain, they are perfect too! YUM!

Everyone who has tried these has enjoyed them. They do not have any exciting elements, but it you just want a "plain" cookie this recipe is great and easy.

I had these at mu mom's house and loved them, despite the fact that she'd gone a little heavy with the cream of tartar.  Oddly enough, I tried to make them at home (3 differant times!) and they turned out awful every time--hard and greasy.  I wish I knew what I did wrong, cause they are so yummy!

such a wonderful cookie, easy to make, almost full proof. i topped them with homemade icing, ...........
2 cups confectioners' sugar
3 1/2 tablespoons gingerbread coffee creamer
4 tablespoons butter..
1.In a saucepan, over medium heat, heat coffee creamer and butter until butter is melted. Stir in the confectioners' sugar. Remove from heat, and beat with an electric mixer until thick and smooth. pipe into a bag and top the cookies. if it thickens up just put the bag into the microwave for 10 seconds.( remove the metal decorating tip first lol ) and I used Parchment paper on my cookie sheets.

Awesome Cookie recipe! I did adjust the oil to 3/4 cup because 1 cup of oil and 2 sticks of butter seemed like a lot!  They turned out great.  I went ahead and drizzled chocolate on top and they are perfect!

These are the same cookies my grandma makes. Though she smashes them with a fork and sprinkles them with sugar before she bakes them. The fork lines hold the sugar on better and makes them a little less plain.

My mom started making these cookies around Christmas time 40+ years ago.  I now make them every year and have been for 22 years.  They are so delicious, melt in your mouth and very pretty too with different colored sugar on them.  Truly a keeper!

these cookies are freakin amazing! at first, we were unsure of what cream of tartar was, but we used the wonderful invention called the internet, and found out lots of useful tips and tricks. These cookies were also a lot of fun for me and my girls to make. we played games and such while we were putting the dough on the pan. These cookies just may possibly be the best thing ever, besides the ice on my neck, but cookies rock! and make sure you find out what cream of tartar is! ;)

Typical Midwest flavor - Bland.  Adding flavoring will really help and lets you make a big tray of multiple cookies for one dough.

A great simple recipe.  I already had the ingredients (a definite plus) on hand.  Not too sweet but sweet enough that my kids gobbled them up.  I also played around with the flavoring...lemon was a hit.

Yummy!  I got a late-in-the-day craving for cookies and was looking for something simple, quick and yummy.  This was just what I was in the mood for!  It tasted like a cross between a sugar cookie and a butter cookie.  No frosting needed for me!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe.

This is an amazing "sugar cookie" recipe! I'm not proud of it, but I'm a huge cookie dough eater and this one is SO good. It stays soft enough to scoop after refrigeration, making it perfect to cook a quick batch, or eat a spoonful! hehe. And it always gets tons of compliments!

These cookies were delicious.  They were very light and fluffy from the powdered sugar, and not at all greasy like I expected from the 1 C. vegetable oil. I rolled the cookies in cinnamon-sugar prior to baking, and also added an extra 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the dough. The cookies hardened after a day or so, though.

Hmmm...well, they're ok with coffee or tea but I found them kinda bland. Puffy and soft...yes. Lacks taste tho when eaten alone. I WILL make these again for the sole reason that my girlfriend loves them.

Good but a little bland.  Very easy to make, especially if dropping with a mini ice-cream scoop.  Goes very quickly.  Think I will try Rosemarie's suggestion of crushed pecans or Beyondnascar's idea of Hershey's Kisses next time.  Sounds great!

My Husband and I both like how these stay crisp even in humid Florida. Most cookies are only crisp the same day here. We prepare them thin and cook a little longer to get that effect though. I have adorned them with walnut, toasted coconut, sprinkles at different times but the plain sugar cookies are fine with us.

I followed the recipe as written, and thought they were good except maybe needing a little salt.  They were very soft and had a nice flavor, but eating more than a few can cause an upset stomach due to the amount of oil...

I loved this recipe! I didn't have enough confectioners sugar so I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, regular sugar and the confectioners sugar I had. They were excellent. Even better when I dipped them in choclolate!

Loved this recipe!  Only requires ingredients I usually have on hand.  Sweet but not too sweet.  Delicious.  Highly recommend!  My cook time was only 7 minutes so watch the cookies when baking for signs of browning on the bottom.

Very good! simple and good! Everyone I made them for liked them. On some of them I added some little round sprinkles. Also, I didn't have cream of tartar, so in its place, I added the same amount of lemon juice. You did NOT taste the lemon at all and it worked just fine! I've made these 100x by now and still I have to say everyone loves these!!! They are so simple in taste, yet so good! Delicious!

I needed something sweet for a late night craving - these were at the top of the cookie page and looked easy.  It seemed like a lot of fats in the recipe (2 cups!) but it did say it made 5 dozen.  I made a half of a recipe - I should have listened to my intuition - they were very greasy.  I love spritz, which have tons of butter, but these were just overkill.  If I made them again (doubtful) I bet I could cut the fats in half easily.

These cookies are tasty but the picture is very misleading. They do not come out looking anything like the picture. The picture makes them look like they would be a chewy cookie but they aren't at all they are more like a shortbread type of cookie. I actually made two batches of the dough because I thought maybe I did something wrong the first time. Very frustrating. The family loved them though.

I made a few adaptations to these cookies. I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup oil, mostly because I had never used oil in cookie before and was nervous. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice to the dough. I rolled my cookies in cinnamon sugar before baking. I liked that these cookies were light, not too sweet and not too rich. My husband wasn't a fan, but I ate these cookies six at a time! Which means I probably won't be making them again! :)

I've been baking these cookies for years.  They have never failed me.  My recipe includes 1 tsp of salt, although I use only 1/2 tsp.

I also press the cookies with a fork and sprinkle with sugar or sugar/cinnamon mix.

I replace 1/3 to 1/2 of the sugars with Splenda without affecting the texture.  And they're still yummy!

I've made these cookies a lot for my school (i'm a kindergarten teacher) and it's really good and very easy to make. But i've always taken a fork dipped in sugar to flatten them a bit, and give them a nice shape, then i put sprinkles on them (depending on the season, the colors change). My students love them!

Understaed taste, good tecture, not really fancy enough for company. But great for kids! Really liked this - and I refrigerated half the dough for 2 days, and it was fine, and I got tons of cookies out of this.

I added  lemon zest (1 tsp or more to taste) to half the batter, sprinkled sugar on top before baking. Added 1/4 tsp almond extract plus the sugar to the last half, really added to the flavor.  I've never had any trouble getting rid of these cookies.

My 12 year old daughter made these for our cookie exchange. Not only were they dry easy to make but the abundance of compliments she got on them were proof these were amazing. They were so soft and the perfect amount of sweetness. I had her make a second batch just so we could keep them at home. Warning though; highly addicting. Perfect for dipping in coffee or just on their own. We didnât add icing as we felt they didnât need them. Although half the cookies she melted white chocolate candy melts and out a small dollop on the top and that was a game changer. Both ways were delish. This will be o. Our Christmas cookie tray for sure. Thank you for the recipe.

I used this recipe to make some halloween cookies its not bad for texture. The fact that my daughter and her friends were decorating them made them taste great. I used a few spices because I did notice that is was bland if you don't ice them or put some kind of jelly or lemon fill on them. I would say if you make these just add your favourite holiday spices. I like trying out different recipes any way the fact that its and Amish one at that and they are really great bakers and cooks just wanted to try something traditional by them.

This recipe was extremely oily, but other than that, it was good. The cookies were soft and of perfect texture. I would reccomend to add less oil in the recipe.

So good! I made this for a party, most of them were gone within an hour. You get a lot of cookies in one batch (theyâre small) so I recommend splitting the recipe. They will get hard within a week, so I warmed them up in the microwave for 30 seconds.

Great recipe! Makes a lot of cookies, and using a scoop and lightly pressing cookies with a glass makes them look quite professional. I like to use a frosting that hardens, using corn syrup and almond flavoring. One of my favorites to take to parties. Easy to decorate seasonally, pastel for Easter, holiday sprinkles on white frosting, this is a great recipe.

These are the best tasting and long lasting soft cookies ever. They are light (not too dense). I substituted equal parts of coconut oil in there because I was out of shortening. Still turned out great.

I'm a kitchen catastrophe as usual. Messed up all over the place, had to use olive oil, used unsoftened butter because im not patient, mixed it with my hands because the whisk wasn't cutting it. However after all that I ended up with a super flaky light cookie that tastes exactly like a russian tea cake... I don't know if thats what was supposed to happen, but they're pretty good anyway!

These were wonderful.  Made them just like they said.  I was a little worried about the oil, but wow what a great cookie.  Am taking these to work and I know they won't last to lunch.  So soft, not too sweet and I think when I make them again I could add some decorations for the 4th of July.  Great recipe.

I loved this recipe. Personally I always add more vanilla to recipes. It is indeed a cross between a sugar cookie and a butter cookie.

Excellent! I love experimenting with different (drop) sugar cookies and just had to try this one. I read reviews here that said something was "missing"âand I could imagine that with a cookie recipe that doesn't have salt. I added 1/4 tsp. of salt just as I would with any other cookie recipe. Additionally I used salted butter. I used a #50 food scoop (I think it's 1 Tbs) to form slightly chilled dough into balls that I then rolled in some leftover decorating sugar mixed with regular granulated sugar. I made a half batch and my yield was just shy of three dozen cookies. It was late at night and I got a wild idea with the last pan to go into the oven. I had a jar of fresh Haribo Gold gummy bears nearby and got a crazy idea; put a gummy bear on the cookie and see how it bakes (I did three test cookies). They melted spectacularly giving a slightly chewy center and adding a fruity flavor! Folks, this could be a thing! I'd stand the gummies vertically and push them in really good next timeâthey bubble up, expand and lose any semblance of gummy bear. Even better than jam thumbprint cookies imho. ~Rachelle >^..^

This recipe has been my favorite and I use it as a base for everything!
I have sold these roadside and been complimented by a friend who said,"These are the best cookies I have EVER tasted." I can totally relate to that statement! They look so perfect and come off the pan easily--- when I think cookie, I think these!

Love this recipe!
It's simple and easy to freeze.
Just scoop and freeze on a tray...then put in a container. Bake the extras at a later date.

Makes a lot of cookies!

Excellent with some modifications. I took the advice of another reviewer and added an icing-they popped. I added a quarter teaspoon of freshly ground cardamom to the dry ingredients, and made an icing with orange juice and zest-very nice combination. Also loved how quick this was, from measuring to cookies in less than half an hour.

I made this recipe on a whim.  I had purchased some Lemon 'Chips' and was looking for a simple sugar/shortbread kind of cookie to which they would they would be a perfect addition.  This recipe was Perfect! I did not have any Cream of Tartar on hand, and substituted in Baking Powder.  They turned out just fine. The somewhat blandness of the recipe allowed the Lemon 'Chips' to give a nice burst of flavour as you bit into the cookie.  This recipe is going in my "Make again" File.  It is simple, and makes a large batch - perfect for sharing.

I think these were rather bland.  I ended up adding some white chocolate chips to half of them and that seemed to make them better.  I won't make these again though.

I make these all the time and there are never any left!  One thing I do to help 'sweeten' them up is  roll them in sugar mixed with cinnamon to make snicker-doodles.  They are excellent this way!

I love these! I've made them several times and each time I made ome modification. One time I added 1 cup chocolate rice. The other time I use 3 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa, 1/4 cup vanilla flavoured malt and 1/4 tapioca flour instead of 4 1/2 cup flour. The texture is still the same and the taste improved a lot!

I made this cookie at Easter.  Everyone raved about them.  A plain, not sweet cookie, great with a cup of tea.

I take this cookie to potlucks and very seldom come home with any left. My family really enjoys these.
