I made these for my son who has a lot of food allergies.  I just had to substitute additional coconut oil for the palm shortening.  Of all the baking that I have done for him, he said that these were the very best!

Paleo people are on to something! These muffins are surprisingly good, at least to a non-Paleo person. Definitely include the dates, for flavor, sweetness, and texture.

Didn't change a thing and they got eaten up by all at a game night.  Bake them for the time in the recipe, even at high altitude. Soft is good, burned bottom is bad.

Delicious!! I made these with the dates and I'm glad I did, sweetness was just right. 

I subbed Kerrygold Butter instead of Palm Shortening. After making these a few times, I found that even when I put the nut/chocolate mixture on top before baking, the chocolate chips still maintain their form.

I totally butchered this recipe and it still came out awesome! I substituted Raisins for dates, used Apple Sauce because I didn't have Palm Shortening on hand, and Nesquick mix instead of Cocoa. These muffins are like Brownies! Very tasty!

I thought they were pretty good, moist enough, chocolatey,  but made them for an event, and brought most of them home. One person remarked that they 'tasted vegan.' I was a little surprised, because I followed the recipe and thought they would be a success.

Since I am not dairy free, I added 1 egg and substituted 2T melted butter for the palm oil. I also substituted almond flour instead of coconut flour.  I used peanut butter instead of almond butter. These muffins are unbelievably delicious. You would never guess they are grain and added sugar free. They are moist and delicious and just the right amount of sweet. Don’t pass on the dates, you can’t see or taste them and add the just right sweet. This recipe is an absolute keeper!!!

These are good but dry. I didn't have any dates on hand, but I feel these would have turned out better with dates.

I found this recipe because my husband went paleo and I was looking for desserty-type recipes.  Since trying this recipe, I make these muffins almost every time I have bananas that are getting old.  They are moist and perfect.  They are a bit crumbly, but that's to be expected when not using egg as a binder.  I've only made the recipe once without the dates and found the muffins to not be quite as moist or sweet, not that they are super sweet to begin with.  Most of the sweetness comes from the chocolate chips in the topping.  Highly recommended!

Had to use semi-sweet choc chips, 2 TB butter in place of palm oil and almond flour in place of coconut.  Put bananas, almond butter and dates in food processor 1st then transferred to mixing bowl and used mixer to add the rest.  Kids loved these!  I cooked them 5 minutes longer than stated.  I can see adding an egg if your diet allows, although not necessary, it would just help bind it better.

This recipe was my first foray into a world without gluten. After all the bad press gluten-free gets, I was very pleasantly surprised! I saw coconut flour at the bulk food store and it smelled so good when I opened the bin that I had to buy some and found this recipe with an ingredient search. I always have over-ripe bananas in the house as well as pitted dates, and I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had. It was certainly easy to do in the food processor. I couldn't believe the nice sweetness without the addition of sugar.

Good flavor but I had to add an egg the second time around to get them to bind together better. They make a good, quick, nutritious breakfast.  Also, they freeze really well.
