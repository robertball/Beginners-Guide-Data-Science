This recipe was the highlight of tonight's dinner! Wonderful! Per other reviews, I reduced the sugar down to 1/4 cup and since I only had 1 can of corn, I used a 16oz bag of frozen corn in place of the second can. For the "topping," I mixed the remaining 1/4c sugar with the cinnamon  (to make cinnamon sugar) and set aside in a small bowl until it came time to add...at which time I only used 3/4 of that (which was okay...my boyfriend made some cinnamon toast with the remaining sugar mix). It did take a little longer to bake but the bowl was cleaned and everyone declared I MUST make this again very soon. Thank you Linda!!

This was a delicious recipe! My husband loved it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it called for too much sugar, mainly the extra bit at the end. I just cut that out and voila! a perfect dish.

This recipe is SO good!  I absolutely loved it!  I did omit the 1/4 cup sugar at the end and it was still just a small tad too sweet.  After baking I just dusted some sugar and cinnamon on top.  But, I did have to bake for 1 hour and 25 minutes.  DELISH!!

Good, but other reviews are right about the sugar. Better to cut it in half.

"Cinnamon Corn"..such an odd combination that you
just have to read the recipe! Tried it for an Easter Potluck and it was very tasty, indeed. Also, the kitchen smelled great while it was baking! I did have to bake it an extra ten minutes. Will try this one again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It has a great flavor. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 of what the recipe called for. I will be making this again. Thanks

I thought the flavor was good but it was too too sweet and I couldn't get my 3 kids to eat it.  I will try once more with half the suger.

This is an incredibly versatile and forgiving dish.  I absolutely adore it, as do my dinner guests too!

I always use the no-sodium added corn, since the dish is so sweet already.  I've made it a ton of different ways now - substituting in sweetened condensed milk or regular milk and starch for the evaporated milk.  It tends to be pretty soupy so I try to reduce the liquids a little bit and add a little thickening agent too.  I basically put almost no sugar in it (usually abt 1/3 c), but I find that brown sugar has a richer flavor (plus makes a nice sprinkling on top with cinnamon).  It's nice to have a dash of  cinnamon mixed in with the other wet ingredients too.

It always takes longer than 1 hour - I'd clock it at 1:20 or so. This is definitely a keeper for generations to come!!

The cinnamon added a great flavor to the traditional southern "corn puddings" I am used to.  It is very sweet so I may cut back on the sugar next time.  I'll definitely make it again and again.  Thank you Linda.

It's hard to know what to say about this recipe. The taste is good and the cinnamon really does compliment the corn. Somehow it s just too rich and sweet to make it an enjoyable eating experience...especially if  served with other dishes that have sugar. I  served it as a side dish with meatloaf and it seemed to amplify the sweetness of the tomato sauce glaze on the meatloaf. It was fun to try this and made for fun dinner conversation but I wouldn't make it again.

Tasty.  Reminded me of something to serve for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.  I cut back the sugar and it was still quite sweet.  For the topping I put just a teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and that seemed like plenty.  My 3 year old really liked it!

Living in the South, we prepare sweet rice frequently.  This is a wonderful alternative.  We add 1/2 of the sugar it calls for.  But that is an individuals preference.  Great recipe!

Love this recipe! I came across it about 5 years in a search for a corn side dish w/a subtle flare to attend a family gathering with my boyfriend, now hubby! Yep,that good! LOL! Tweeked down the sugar to a 1/4 cup all in. I also add cinnamon to mixture before baking and dash of nutmeg on the finish. Now, it's expected that I bring this dish. So easy and simple. Warm and comforting. I highly recommend.

I didn't care for this but DH liked it!  I think I should have cooked the milk into the flour/margarine mixture until it got to a "sauce" and then added the corn.  Mine the sauce turned to a paste like and I could not eat it!!  Soo I gave it 3 stars.

For me, this is a 5 star.  I only had frozen corn, so used it straight from the freezer.  I put the cinnamon on top from the beginning.  At one point I stirred it, as I was curious what the frozen corn was doing.  So the cinnamon was mixed throughout while cooking.  It was amazing.  I didnt wait for a knife to come out clean.  It was still a little creamy but thickened up nicely once out of the oven.  I opted against the sugar on top.  It was very very good.  I wish it wasnt so good because you just want to eat more and more.  My daughter said it was like having your veggies and your dessert all in one.

The 1st few times I made this my family loved it.  It was very 'comfort food' like.  I recently made it and thought I had more canned corn than I actually did.  I substituted frozen corn and it was pretty gross.  It's excellent if you follow the recipe (just cut the sugar down some), but DO NOT USE FROZEN CORN.  Frozen corn did not work well for this recipe.

This was so good. My husband liked it, but my daughter and I loved it. I used only half of the sugar in the mixture and I used a bottle of cinnamon sugar to sprinkle as much as I wanted on top. Again, it was so good, thank you.

This was good, but a little too sweet.  Next time, I will skip the addition of the sugar, as the corn is sweet enough with just the cinnamon.

After reading reviews, I also only used 1/2 the amount of sugar. My husband and I both thought it was pretty good. My three picky, young kids said it was okay, but would not eat it. I will make it again, but not often.

Love this recipe.  Folks always think this is a strange combination but it is delicious.  I do add cinnamon to the corn mixture before it cooks.  And I also sprinkle more cinnamon on top.  I guess the amount of cinnamon is based on your tastes-i say a little more is a little better.  This is yummy-try it before you turn your nose up.

this recipe is everything! I will never go back to regular corn after this. The only changes I made were heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk & i didn't sprinkle all the cinnamon & sugar in the end, I only to my liking. I drained  the butter  once during the baking process, & baked for about a 1h20 mins.

This is sooo good. It has been requested multiple times at family gatherings. I do cut the sugar for the topping. I only use 2 TBSP.

I love this recipe as well as my son. He always asking me to make it. I've taken it to work and everyone that tried it and loved it. I'll be taking some to church pot luck dinner tonight. Can't wait. I did nothing different with the recipe, it is perfect the way it is.

I was so excited about this recipe but it didn't go over very well at my Christmas dinner. I read the reviews & cut the sugar in half. I also used half & half instead of evaporated milk because that's what I had. I am going to make it again & leave the cinnamon sugar off the top & see how that works. Everyone said it was fine but I had a lot left over.

This is a keeper for me. I took the advice of previous reviewers and cut the sugar in half. That was a good move. 1/2 cup would have been too much. Since others talked about it not setting up well, I simply whisked an egg in after the evaporated milk and it set up fine in the one-hour baking time. I put most of the 1/4 cup cinnamon sugar mixture on the top because I was being conservative but next time will use all of it.

This recipe is so simple and easy to make. And the taste, it is like eating dessert with the main course. I'm not a huge fan of corn but with this recipe that might change. I will definitely be using it again and again.  Already have plans to make it for some potlucks I will be attending.

I served this at Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  This is much better than plain corn and I will use this recipe again.  One change I will make though is to reduce the amount of butter.  Also, I did not add the extra sugar to the top, but it was sweet enough.

I tried this recipe because it sounded interesting, and it was very interesting.  Mine ended up rather runny, so I would add more flour next time.  Good flavors though!

Thas been a holiday staple since we found this recipe 8 years ago. However I have found that it requires more cooking time and we totally omit the sugar on top of the dish as it makes it too sweet. This must be on our tabe every Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Definitely nothing to write home about.  The knife inserted at the end of baking time most definitely does not come out dry as the recipe indicates it should.  Probably will not make again.

I made this the first time to try something different for a potluck dinner.  Needless to say, I've given out the recipe (giving credit to Linda Rier - of course) and it has been requested at every potluck dinner since!  (It has been 2-3 years...)

This was great.  The only issue that I had was one that I did myself and it was that I used to much cinnamon.  It was delious and I will make it again but I will not use the amount of cinnamon that I put in it.  I'll use what was recommended in the first place!

I followed other reviewers advice, and I didn't add the sugar at the end.  I only added the cinnamon.  This was a little sweet for my taste.  My husband loved it though. I may make this again, just not sure it will be right away.

I have made this recipie a few times, and I made it again last night using corn oil margarine instead of regular margarine.  I'm not sure what happened but it ended up being extremely buttery with a layer of oil at the top.  I drained the extra oil and it still turned out fantastic.  Love the sweetness! Thanks!

there are 6 of us in the family...and we all eat corn...but nobody would touch this one.  was not a big hit...

but if you're looking for something really great to do with corn...try the Hot Corn recipe...people couldn't get enough...
