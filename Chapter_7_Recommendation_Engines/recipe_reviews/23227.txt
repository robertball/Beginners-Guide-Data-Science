We really liked this! Since the cooking method is really the key to this dish, it would have been nice to have more complete instructions on what size pan and how to arrange the meat in it. I think most of us assumed to bake it in a shallow dish arranged in one layer. I more than doubled this recipe (btw, you don't need quite twice the rub - had a little too much) and didn't want to use two dishes, so I baked it in my 8-qt dutch oven. I didn't quite have room to single layer and my pork was pretty snug in there. Turned out perfect in 2 hours! For anyone who has trouble with this dish drying out, try shortening the cooking time and/or snuggling your meat cubes closer in the pan. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made a mistake and only used 2 tsp of chile powder (instead of tblsps), and my husband thought it was the best pork he had ever tasted. Next time, I realized my error and tried it with 2 tblsp of chile powder, and it overwhelmed the other spices. I have been making it with 2 tsps chile powder ever since. I bake it in 9X13 dish (with a little olive oil to prevent sticking) at 325 for about 45 minutes. NOTE: This rocks with cubed
chicken breasts (**remember, just 2 tsps
chile powder). I make both pork and chicken each time, since my husband doesn't like chicken and my son prefers
chicken.

while it was a little short on instructions, this is what I did: I used a shallow pan with a little olive oil on the bottom to prevent sticking and cooked it for a little less than 2hr- probably 1h40mins- DELICIOUS!!- Thanks for sharing- our two year old even liked it and she hates everything.  I served it with a couple of steamed veggies on the side.  I'm making it later this week for dinner guests.

This is one of my favorites!  I never even liked pork until I had this.  My family ate it over rice.  It was not very spicy, so beware if that's what you like.  My mom, who doesn't like anything spicy, ate it and liked it.

I've made this several times, and both my husband and I really enjoy it now.  However, the first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and the pork dried out.  Now I cook it for about 1/3 less time than indicated - fabulous over rice!

Great recipe!
I had to alter it, due to time and a lack of the main ingredient...

So what I did was use cubed pork chops instead of pork tenderloin, cut up into 1 inch cubes.  I did follow the recipe spices and marinate time.  Cooked the cubes over the stovetop in a little bit of olive oil - served it over the top of Robyn Webb's "Black Beans and Rice" (on this site as well, though I did alter that recipe as well (look for my review to see the alterations)) with corn and chopped fresh red & green bell peppers on the side to cut the bite of the beans & rice.  Excellent!  Great idea to use the cilantro - such a wonderful fresh herb.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will be keeping & using it often. =)

First, I'd like to say that the poor review from RMSR is completely irrelevant! Hello....If you completely didn't follow the recipe then don't give it a bad rating!  I followed the recipe to the T.  The only question I had was how small to cube the meat.  I made the cubes about 1-2" square and as SunnyByrd did, I crowded the meat in the dish.  Baked for 2 hours and it's perfect!  Great recipe - thanks for sharing.

This is very tasty. Make sure you cover the dish/pot and its like it becomes steamed in the porks own juices. It gets tender if you cook it for a long time on a low heat. I added a teaspoon of oil, sealed it with a lid and cooked it for 1 hour at 150C-it would be a lot more tender I would say if cooked at 120C for 1.5 to 2 hours. Im definitely making it again!

Made this with "Mango Tango Black Bean Salsa," also from allrecipes, and it is an amazing compliment of flavors for a low-carb, low-fat meal.  We are planning to make this at an upcoming dinner party with "Chicken Tortilla Soup V" also from this site.  This recipe is easy and delicious, but be warned - 2 hours is too long unless you want the extra crisp (and chew).  Check it after an hour.

This turned out great.  I used some butter and EVOO to a 9x13 pan and added some quartered new potatos and fennel to pan.  Sprinkled all with garlic powder and cooked on 350.  Yummy Yummy Yummy.

This was really delicious....being from New Mexico, spicy pork is a really popular dish, I cant beleive I didn't think of this earlier.  First off, I unfortunatley could not use tenderloin so I cubed some thick, bonless pork cutlets.  I marinated them in the rub for about 2 hours.  I added some lime juice, onion slices, and sliced, fresh/raw jalepeno for the extra spice kick (great idea for those who are looking for spice).  I cooked it in a pan on med/low heat with a bit of oil for about 20 minutes. It came out so good...served with some tortillas, guac, and salsa! yumm

I marinaded this all day, and the flavor was fantastic. I baked it uncovered, however, and it turned out pretty dry. We enjoyed it though. Thanks, Sara!

Simple and tasty! We tossed all the spices into the cubed meat and let it sit for 3-4 hours. In the end  drizzled a little oil over it, tossed again and baked covered with foil at 250 degrees for 1-1/2 hours. Super tender and juicy. Served with rice. Also great the next day with tortillas.

I made this dish tonight and was slightly disappointed with result. I didn't have alot of time on hand so I skipped the marinating stage and instead boiled the meat in a pot with chicken soup base for about 15 minutes to tenderize it. I then drained the meat and mixed it with the spice blend. I oiled a baking pan with olive oil and baked 300F for half an hour. It smelled great, but I still found it dry and lacking something to make it scream "delicious". I served it on a bed of plain white rice and a side of cheesy brocoli. I did add some dijonaise and tabasco to try and make the meat juicy, but failed. I probably won't make this dish again unless there is a way to make sort of a sauce so it isn't so dry.

We loved this although I did change the recipe. I had chucks of pork, no chili powder and added a small chopped onion, 6 cloves of garlic and a 1/2 a small can of tomato sauce then I threw it all in the crock pot. I put it on HIGH for 3 1/2 hours. It was crazy good. We shredded it for tacos and the toddlers had it over rice. The babies loved it, too.

Wonderful!  I only used 1/2 tsp cumin.  I used a pork loin roast.  I also used a bit of oil drizzled over the meat prior to cooking and covered with foil.  I only cooked for 1 hr.  the meat was PERFECT!  very moist and soooo tender.

Made it w "mexican rice II" from this site. Great combination. Now as far as the pork is concerned... i read other reviews and i cooked it 1 hr n 20 min total. I wasnt sure which review 2 follow so i followed a bit of all... I cooked at 225 in oven, for the 1st 25 min i kept my shallow, loosely packed dish covered in aluminium foil, after 25 min i uncovered, let cook at 225... last 5 min i threw it under thr broilder to make it crispier. also, the spices seem like a lot, it seems like 2 much spice for the amount of meat, but it does not come out spicy, it comes out perfectly seasoned. My meat tasted great and it was nice and still juicy. i am making this again, soon

Have made 3 times now in dutch oven with just a slight bit of oil in the bottom.  This is soooo good.  It's a simple meal for us, serve it over white rice in a bowl, sprinkle with cilantro and call it a day.  Fresh!

So easy and so good. I was in a hurry, so I drizzled a little olive oil in the bottom of a dutch oven pot and cooked it at 275 degrees for 1:30min and it came out amazing. I tried this once with pork shoulder and another time with pork tenderloin and the pork shoulder came out way juicier.

Very Good.  Made quite a bit of it and had it for dinner with cauliflower salad and then ate it during the week for a quick lunch/snack.  Watching the carbs right now so this did the trick.

TIME SAVER -- Used a packet of chile powder mix, and left over roast. Threw a can of chopped tomatoes w/ garlic, can of beans and let it simmer til rice was cooked. Same flavors, worked great as a "fast shot" after work.  Family loved it.

The flavor was really good and even my 5 and 7 year old really liked it in tacos.  I followed the recipe pretty close but used a different cut of pork that I had on hand which made it much harder to cut into chunks ahead of time so I diced it after cooking for about the 2 hours then returned to the oven to brown it some more.  Next time I will be sure to buy the pork tenderloin and try it that way.

I didn't have chili powder, so I used a thai red chili paste and it turned out excellent. Next time I will marinade it longer. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and snugged the meat tightly in a greased baking dish. I cooked it 1 !/2 hours and it was almost too much. My husband felt it was a little dry, but loved the flavors. So the next day I warmed up the leftovers with some veggies and Thai Kitchen Sweet Chili Sauce and served over the rice and it was excellent. I served it both days with the Orange Rice which is also on this site.

Followed recipe as written. Followed other posters suggestions and spread in single layer in oiled shallow casserole and baked. Baking time depends on the size of your pork cubes. Mine were about 1 inch and I bled a little less than 1 hour. Served with baked potato and salad. Very good

Great taste. I didn't marinate the pork but sauteed the meat for about 5 minutes in a pan with all the ingredients. Then I cover the pan and put the whole thing in the oven at 225 for 1 hour. I also doubled the garlic and fresh cilantro. It came out great! Next time I'll reduce the salt and add some veggies like mushroom for abit more texture.

I followed another user's suggestion and baked the pork on 325 for 45 minutes with a foil cover.  The pork came out tender and juicy and made the perfect meal with some rice and asparagus.  So delicious!  I thought it was going to be spicier than it was and was pleasantly surprised that it had flavor without a lot of heat.  Would definitely make again.

Very good! Followed someone else's suggestion and cooked the pork in a covered dish in oven at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. Meat was tender and juicy - but it never got "crispy" as stated in the recipe but it also never dried out either.  It was very good. The spices worked well together.

This recipe has great flavor. I just cooked it in my oven in the dutch oven and put a little olive oil in the bottom. I cooked it covered for the full time at the recommended tempurature and followed all ingredients exactly as recommended. It turned out juicey and delicious. I have had it leftover a couple of times now on a tortilla with rice, avacado, sour cream, cheese, lime juice, and green tabasco. This was even better than the first night. I will make this again. It was great!

Used extra cilantro, but I chopped more than needed.  

So easy to make that I told my son to follow the recipe as instructed and my teenaged son made dinner. Made steamed broccoli and rice to go with it and it was fantastic.

This is a fantastic recipe.  My husband and two year old are very picky and they both really liked this.  This is the first time my daughter actually ate pork.  The other great thing about this recipe is that it is so easy and inexpensive.  I didn't have cilantro on hand so I omitted it.  Also I didn't have time to marinate or bake so I pan fried in olive oil with out marinating and it still tasted wonderful.

You "boil" meat like possum, very old rabbits and road kill, not good pork, chicken or beef unless you are making soup. As directed this recipe forms good base for a spicy pork dish, e.g. fajitas, tacos or burritos. Additional spices and herbs enhance it.

I haven't made this yet but want to.  However, the pork inthe picture certainly doesn't look like tenderloin but like the dark meat that is part of the butt.  ( The butt is gamey tasting, but much more juicy when baked) So, asking originator of this meat, is it butt, shoulder or tenderloin.

Awesome recipe.  While coating the pork I added a little olive oil.  Then I seared the pork in a hot pan for just a couple of minutes to get a good crust all over.  Because of this I only had to bake the dish for about an hour.  The pork was so flavorful and tender.  No adjustments to the seasoning were necessary.  Definitely a keeper!  Would also be great on chicken and beef.

This was different.  By itself, the pork was just dry dry dry with an overpowering taste of - well, I'm not sure if it was too much cumin or too much chili powder, but *something* was off.  I just couldn't eat it.  Having said that, I had made some Spanish rice to go along with meal, so I simply cut the meat up smaller, mixed it in with the rice, cheese, and sour cream and ate it in a burrito.  Now THAT was good.  I'd probably give this a 3 1/2 (only because the meat was SO dry ... and I had cut my pieces fairly large after ready similar comments by other reviewers.  Thanks so much for recipe, tho.

I sliced my pork roast and mixed it all together. I added a few dashes of chipotle hot sauce and drizzled it all with EVOO. I placed it in my smoker for 2 hours instead of marinating it in the fridge. I cooked at 225 in the smoker and made homemade refried beans which I also finished off in the smoker. I served it with tortillas, pepper jack cheese and nice cold beer. Yum!!

This is a keeper. I used center cut pork chops and only 2 tsp of chili powder. I put just a dap of olive oil in the bag when I coated the pork. Cooked it uncovered for 2 hours. Perfecto!

The only ingredient I changed was to reduce the salt to approx. 1/8 tsp.  I lined my pan with Release, also covered with foil and cooked on 325 for 45 min.  It was perfect!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was tasty.  The pork was deliciously tender and moist; I took the advice of other reviewers and covered my 9x13 dish.  After 30 min at 225, we suddenly needed to eat sooner, so I kicked it up to 350 and it was done in 15 more min.  Next time we'll make it as a filling for tacos or fajitas and somehow work some lime juice into the mix.

Very easy to prepare.  Baked it covered with foil and shredded it to make tacos.  My two young boys ate it up.  I will make this recipe again.  Oh, note:  I used the full amount of rub for half the amount of meat.

I agree with The Purple Chef. I did the recipe as it says to the letter and it was really dry even after trying to add salsa but that failed too. The garlic was too over powering and the guacalome made it taste kind of paste with garlic after taste. I don't think I will make this again.

I cut the recipe in half because I didn't need nearly so much, and also added a couple of shakes of coriander. I oiled a 9x13 pan and covered it with foil while it cooked, and baked it at 325 for 45 min. It was very tender and juicy, and we ate it on corn tortillas with guacamole. Very good!

I really liked the flavors of this dish.  Like some others had suggested, I didn't roast for the full 2 hours but 1 hour, 45 minutes at 225.  Came out moist and delicious.  Served with some fresh broccoli.  I think next time I'll add some cayenne pepper to this for a little kick, the chili powder doesn't make it spicy at all.

Followed momto5's instructions & cooked it in a covered dutch oven. I was hesitant with the really low oven temp, but it was delish! Everyone liked it. We ate it in corn tortillas with quac, rice & beans. Great stuff & easy! Thanks.

I did this a tad different.  Used it last minute, so didn't have two hours to bake.  It did sit in fridge, then I broiled it to cut down on prep time.  It was still very moist.  I personally didn't like the texture of the spice coating so dipped it in salsa ranch. My picky two year old skipped the dip and ate seconds and thirds and even asked for leftovers the next day!  So for that it gets a 5 stars.

We didn't care for this much, I'm sorry to say. It seemed dry, and the chili powder flavor overwhelmed the other seasonings. It did get tender though... I'm willing to give it another try with some adjustments to the spices. Thanks for sharing!

I was pressed for time so I wasn't able to bake it, so I cooked it stove top. It turned out wonderful. The spices were a great mixture. Spicy without being too spicy. My mom even liked it. I was told that I better not lose the recipe!

My husband and I couldn't get enough of this! We used curry this time instead of cumin, and are excited to try the cumin version too. Absolutely delicious! Oh, I did cut the bake time to 1.5 hours. Perfect.

My fiance loved it. For me, the cumin flavor was a bit overwhelming. Will probably try again but will modify spices. Thanks for sharing.

wow!!!  What flavor and what a way to change things up a notch!!  The kids loved it and they normally do not eat meat because of the toughness meat usually is...but with this...very tender thanks so much for a awesome plate.

I had to omit the garlic because my husband is allergic, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It turned out very well.    Unlike some other reviewers, I did not cover the pan because the recipe says "until crispy" and covering does not generally lead to crispy.  I served this with Mexican White Rice from allrecipes, a can of refried beans, and some corn tortillas.  Perfect!

We loved this one at our house. Followed the recipe exactly except I was concerned about it drying out, so I topped it with a few spoons of Goya sofrito sauce and covered with tin foil before baking. It made a nice sauce, so I just served it in tortillas with a little cilantro. So easy!

I was worried about the amount of spices in this recipe, so I increased everything by about 50%. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It didn't help, it was the most bland Chile Pork I have ever made. 
Chile Colorado is one of my favorite dishes, I have made it dozens of times, so I know how to make it properly. I liked the simplicity of this recipe, so I gave it a shot. I think the recipe would benefit from a stock or marinade to help the pork gain more flavor. I also recommend spanish/mexican rice to pair with, do not use plain white rice.  I added both a stock/sauce from the pork and spanish rice and it really helped the subtle flavor this recipe has.

Made exactly as the recipe stated, baked (tightly covered with foil - meat in a single layer) at 325 degrees for one hour. So easy and so delicious. My husband, who doesn't usually care for pork, wolfed it down!

Very easy and tasty. I used 1TBP  chili powder. and country style ribs cut into 1.5" cubes and added sliced onions. I baked it in a single layer 9x13" 375 * x  45min.   The leftover sauce I used to bake chicken the next day.

I didn't make changes but I will next time. Way overcooked, hard surfaces of meat, not very tender, which I had not expected with the low and slow cooking. I will cut way back on the dry rub and cut bigger chunks and cook at least a half hour less.

Sorry "Sal"...what a waste of a delicious tenderloin.  I should have known better......and used  pork shoulder or butt which has fat in it to crisp and give flavor.   Tenderloin is too lean and it dried out the meat even at 1 hour 15 min. cooking time.
I would NOT recommend this preparation.  Even found this way too salty besides!
Will try to resurrect this as a soup today.........??

Followed the recipe exactly, the meat was amazing! The seasoning was just right and the meat was so tender! I did cover the meat with tin foil during cooking. I made tacos with the meat: corn tortillas, chopped mangos, crumbled goat cheese, and fresh cilantro. This recipe is a keeper , for sure!!! Highly recommend it!

I made this almost exactly the same as the recipe. The only difference was that I used pork loin roast (it was cheaper and came out nice and moist). Since I was cooking for one, I only used one pound. I used about two thirds of the spice mixture, and I used less salt. I crowded the meat a bit and didn't use any oil at all.  I cut the pieces fairly small and it took only about  an hour and twenty minutes at 225C. I had some for lunch and am looking forward to delicious quesadillas! I would definitely make this again.

Nicely seasoned. I noted one reviewer's comment about reducing the chili powder to 2 tsp; that's about all I had left in the bottle, so was OK. At about 1.75 hours, I spread a mixture of smashed left-over squash and left-over roasted potato, with a few tablespoons of shredded cheese. Continued baking for another quarter hour to warm the topping. Sprinkled the last of the shredded cheese on top and popped it under the broiler for 2 min to finish. Will make this again without the topping and use it for enchiladas and soup, yum.

I always try to make recipes as posted but I don’t want to waste ingredients either.  I reduced chili powder, but not much...maybe 1 tsp and I think that quantity of meat could stand more cilantro.  But the big change I made was cooking time of the meat.  It is a little complicated.  Carnitas are cooked crisp but start with Pork shoulder which is fattier and  can/should be cooked longer at a low temperature.  If you are going to start with pork tenderloin  at 225, I think it only takes 1 and 1/4 hour.  It will be tasty but won’t be crisp.

Thank you for the recipe. Seems rather easy, however need to know if we can replace the aluminum foil with grease-proof paper as aluminum foil is considered unhealthy to use.

The spice is an excellent base for meat in general. On pork it's on point and great for street tacos, really like it with cubed lamb with fresh mint, then with beef cuts, especially with smoked beef back ribs smothered with melted butter then sprinkled with the spice ..... primo! Thank you for the quick and great idea.

I placed the pork pieces touching each other in a single layer on a flat baking sheet. I cooked it in a convection toaster oven using the normal bake function at 225F for about 1hr 45 minutes. The pork came out somewhat tender but a little dry even though it's swimming in its own grease. As other reviewers have said, the chili powder is overpowering and needs to be dialed down. I didn't add cilantro but I can't see that 1 tbsp of cilantro would have made the pork any more flavorful over the chili powder.

I followed the recipe but  after 2 hours the pork was not crispy. I 
increased the temperature to 400 and cooked it  until it was sizzling and a little crispy. It was very good but a little too hot. I think it was my chili powder. I didn't have cilantro but it still was very good.

Great recipe which I will make again.  I would reduce the amount of chili powder , I would use 1 1/2 tablespoons instead of two...only because my family does not like really spiced food.

I made this for SuperBowl with some Mexican Rice. It smelled great while cooking but once done it was just so so. I do not think it was worth the time for marinating it and slow cooking in oven. I let it marinade for 2 hours and it cooked for 2 hours. First 1-1/2 hrs I had covered with foil and uncovered the last 1/2 hour. It was tender just not a lot of taste.

Just not exactly what had been anticipated.  Did not crisp on the exterior.    Might try again to see if it was my error but difficult to do so with such a nice cut of meat.

The 5 stars is for the rub recipe, which is excellent and can be used on pork chops as well with good results.  I combined this with another recipe for pork chops from this site, "Black beans and pork chops."  I rubbed the pork chops according to recipe, a perfect amount of rub for 4 large pork chops.  I cooked them in a skillet for 3-5 minutes on each side added one can black beans and one cup salsa and simmered for 20 minutes.  My husband remarked on the wonderful mix of flavors.  It was so easy, tasty and quick.

I made the recipe as stated. It was dry, though the flavor was good. If I make it again I woul bake it for no more than 1hr 45min and I’d check it at an hour and a half. We put the leftover chunks in the salad shooter and it came out ground. Freezing it for pork tacos or enchiladas.

I wish I'd read some of the reviews first!  Mine pork was a little dry.  I cooked in a single layer on a shallow pan.  now  know to not do that.  next time I'll use a smaller dish.

But the flavor was good.  I'm going to turn the leftovers into filling for tacos!

I will definitely make this dish again and again. Love the combination of spices, not too hot or too mild...perfection. I served this with flour tortillas and kept to the recipe.  I like that there is no sauce, but I might try some mojo or sour orange the next time i make it.  Serve it over white rice of black beans to give it that latino/Cuban flavor.  Oh, the only thing I did change in the recipe was Knorr cubes of Cilantro instead of fresh.

I've been making a similar dish for years. Pork Tenderloin is very lean, so it often cooks up dry. I use pork butt or shoulder, I  also add  Mexican oregano and fresh garlic. The fat adds flavor and tenderness.
I cover it and roast it low and slow.

It was fabulous!  I increased the spicy ingredients, marinated for a few hours in the fridge, and then baked at 275 for a shorter time.  It was delicious as is, though my husband suggested it would be even better with something to dip it in, like a creamy dip or sauce.  Next day I chopped the leftovers and used in tacos - equally yummy!

I also used a few different spices. I'll try it again.

I think it would have tasted better if I  just used 1 tbsp kashmiri chili powder.  I felt it was also too dry to just eat by itself.   I had it with tabouli and plain nonfat yogurt.

Made this exactly as written except I only cooked it for an hour at 300. It was perfectly cooked and not dry at all. Great flavor. I served it with cilantro rice and grilled zucchini. Everyone liked it the way it was including the 2T of chili powder!

I only baked this for about 1.5 hours because I was worried about the meat drying out and getting ruined.  My pieces of meat had crispy edges and tender centers and we were happy with it.  I served with cilantro potatoes and Calabacitas con Elote (a zucchini/corn recipe also from this site).

Since the recipe is lacking in instructions I wasn't sure what type of pan to bake this in and if I should cover it or not.  Since it did mention "cook until crispy" and the temp was low I opted for a 13x9 metal pan and didn't cover.... sadly it was terribly dry.

I love this and make it often. Instead of cooking it in the oven I cook it in a skillet on the stove hot and fast. Pork is very tasty and juicy this way, saves time too. I serve them on corn tortillas with lime, guacamole, and cheese.

I fixed this today with all the ingredients listed. My pork was already cooked so I put them all together and let sit for about 1 hour. Then I fixed the Pork Chili and used this after I sauteed the onions in olive oil, added the flour, tomato sauce, chili spiked diced tomatoes, canned sweet corn and about 5 cups of water. I let it all simmer about 1 1/2 hours and served with grated cheese.  This fed a family of 12 with a little left over.

This is probably one of the best recipe tried on allrecipe.com. It was very tasty. As mentioned before, I pan fried in olive oil on high heat to lesson time in oven. 50- 60 min in oven. My 18mo & 3yo loved this... so that means it wasn't spicy. Right taste! Love it! One thing i would add next time is veggies... perhaps steam veggie of choice and mix it once out of oven.

I have made this recipe several times now and it is always a HUGE hit.  My wife is allergic to cilantro, so obiviously that has to be omitted, and we are garlic fiends, so the 2 tsps becomes 2-3 Tbls and we always garnish with guacamole and sour cream.  Found that is can be a bit dry as a taco without the sour cream.  So good, thank you for submitting this tasty dinner!

Followed the recipe as is and it was great.  We also used the base recipe with the meat and then made a pot of chili by adding white beans and tomatoes - absolutely delicious.  Great with chicken too.  Cornbread on the side...

I should have followed my intuition and covered in foil but i followed the recipe as stated. End results: Extremly dry!! The flavor was fine but the dryness made this almost unedible. Im glad i cut the serving size in half. I wont be making this one again.

This is excellent! I lessened the chili powder a bit because we're wimps here, and didn't have time to leave it in the refrigerator before cooking, but it's still incredibly flavorful. I put a little oil in the bottom of the casserole, as someone suggested, and definitely let it cook for the whole 2 hours. What a treat!

LOVE IT!! I followed the directions exactly except I didn't have any fresh garlic so I substituted 2 tsp garlic powder. The garlic did not overpower the other spices. I used country style short ribs instead of the pork tenderloin and it was so moist and delicious. Definately a keeper! Thanks!

Really good.  Really yummy.  But not so much as a meal in itself.  Would be better as a filling for tortillas or sandwiches.  But an awesome way to easily cook pork.

I would give it five stars for the excellent flavor but the cooking time brings it down. If we had followed the directions exactly I think we would've ended up with pork jerky. We shortened the time significantly but it was still dry. Next time I'll try another reviewer's suggestion and cook for 45 mins at 325, with a foil cover.

I was given some pork and did not know what to do with it. Without this recipe its doubtful I would ever have found a way to like pork. This was great, i could eat it with a smile when even mild salsa gives me watery eyes. I did not have cilantro of any kind so that was left out. I added a dash of cayenne. My leftovers the next day were too spicy for me.

My family thought this was great. Since I had seen some people saying it had gotten dry & I had the time, I put mine in my crockpot for the day. It made it so moist and tender. After dinner, I shredded what was left, added a bunch of fresh roasted green chile, and my husband had lunch for another day. I can't wait to make this easy one again!!

Very good. This dish tsstes delicious with a spicy side dish of rice. I used saffron rice as a side dish and it was a delicious meal! As for the pork, I simply coated my pan with a little oil just in case of sticking. I covered the dish while it was cooking in the oven so the meat was tender.

WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS! I snugged my meat together in a Le Creuset casserole and cooked 2 thick butterflied pork chops (cubed) with the chili mixture. I did add some ground coriander to the mix (I think it compliments cumin so well) and it came out juicy and tender after about an hour. I added no additional oil or liquid, and heavens, no way would I add brown sugar. If the cumin overpowered, maybe they didn't add enough salt or the rest of the ingredients. Thank you for this truly EASY and full of flavor recipe. I can't wait to make it again. - Lisa

I really, really wanted to love this, and think that with some modifications I'll like it a lot better. I made this according to the recipe first, and found the taste of cumin to be overwhelming (and not in a good way - I normally love cumin). I was using just over 2 lbs of pork tenderloin, cut into bite-sized pieces, and I packed them into a 1.5 quart oval cassarole dish - the pork cubes were in 2-3 layers and close together. Because of this, I baked for 1 hour 45 minutes (stirring half-way through) instead of the 2 hours and the pork came out only semi-dry (I baked uncovered since the recipe didn't specify). I'll cut down to 1 hour and 30 minutes next time. I'll also add some brown sugar next time as well as cut down on the cumin. 

I served this with taco flavored rice and the combo seemed to be a hit.

I think this recipe has some great possibilities and am looking forward to personalizing it. Will most definately make again!

FANTASTIC!  I am not a pork lover, but my husband is and this recipe was AMAZING!  My husband thought it was excellent.  I took a tip from another review and put oil in the pan I baked in and that helped keep the moisture!  Really yummy with rice!

Really enjoyed this one - had tons of flavour!  The only thing I changed was to cut the recipe in half (only had one tenderloin) and didn't use cilantro (we don't like it at all!).  I did add some crushed red pepper flakes and didn't bake quite as long as stated, probably about 1 hr and 20 mins...very moist and tender pork!

This was a superb meat dish. Great complex flavor and tastes very good over white rice. I marinated the meat for two days in the recommended spices, and coated the bottom of the pan with olive oil. As other reviewers have noted, it does not need to cook for 2 hours; I only cooked it for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, and it still came out moist. I will definitely cook this again.

I doubled up on the spices and added crushed red pepper and fresh pressed garlic.  The nice thing about this recipe is it is a dry rub, so I prepared it on a Saturday and vacuum sealed it with the spices until Wed. It was very good--even though I used a little too much red pepper for our kids.

This was pretty good but it basically tasted just like tacos. It would have been better shredded than cubed, which is what I ended up doing with the meat. My husband ate all the leftovers, though, so overall it's a thumbs-up.

This was really really good.  Got rave reviews from my boyfriend and a friend.  I used curry powder instead of cumin and dried coriander instead of cilantro (not a fan).  I also added some brown sugar.  I used the rub on shnitzel style pork but I'll definitely use it on a tenderloin next time.  YUM!

Tasty,and easy if you plan ahead.  I too found the recipe lacked information, such as if the dish should have been covered before baking.(I did not)

I was really looking forward to this recipe because most everyone gave it a 5 stars.  I followed the recipe but I didn't cook it as long as the initial recipe said.  I thought this recipe was okay as did my husband.  This will not be a recipe I make very often.  I don't even know what to add to give it more flavor it was just all around not very tasty or good.
