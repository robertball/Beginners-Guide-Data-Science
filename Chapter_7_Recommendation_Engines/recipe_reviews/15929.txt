Confectioners coating is a product, a chocolate substitute made without cocoa butter.  Makers can't sell it as chocolate because of the missing ingredient, so termed confectioners coating.  It eliminates the need for tempering, making it easier to dip, or coat items, like the 'birds nest'.  It is less expensive then real chocoalate.

I made the nests with the usual rice-crispy square recpipe with added coconut and green coloring - much more appetising than a hunk of coconut and ohhh so cute!

I loved these! They were adorable and earned me the name "Martha" at a party. I used white chocolate chips which worked perfectly and they were really easy to shape into nests. I filled them with mini pastel jelly beans before they cooled completely just so they'd "stick" in the nests better. These may turn into an annual tradition!

My grandmother made these every year for Easter baskets when I was a kid. I'm so glad I found this recipe on AR. These are so cute and very easy to make.  I use petite jelly beans for inside the "nest".

I think these are better for "cute" appeal than taste appeal.  They're okay in taste, but their "cute" rating is high.  I doubled the recipe and had to put the mixture back in the microwave for about 15 seconds part way through making them, to keep it soft enough to shape.  Don't squish the mixture together or you'll lose the rough nest look.

My mother used this recipe for years.She used the coconut or chow mein noodles its a matter of personal preference. Also Merkins chocolate if available in your area melts wonderfully, and you can usually already find green, though you might try the food coloring for a lighter shade.

Every year my SIL has Easter dinner at her house. She always hosts a huge Easter Egg Hunt for the kids. I told her about this recipe and we got together and made a bunch of these for the Baskets that we'll be hiding.They went together so easily....and of course we had to snitch a couple...they were delicious. Thanks for a wonderful idea, Carol. Russell Stover markets something similar looking, but they are very costly to buy for a large crowd. These were easy, delicious and inexpensive to make.

Too cute, but the kids didn't like the taste as much as I thought they would.  Great for decoration.  Might try again next year.  Thanks for the post.

The recipe is o.k.  I would not rate them up there with the store brand when made according to the recipe.  I could not help but to think that there was something missing so when I made them again I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla and they were wonderful.  Very cute easter treat if you add jelly beans and/or peeps if you make bigger nests.

very easy to make.  I don't like vanilla bark, so added a tsp of butter flavor extract to cover up that artificial taste.  I would use white choc. chips next time.  These were easy to roll, the dough did not harden at all and was still very malleable to the last nest was made.  Filled w/jelly beans, cadberry pastel chocolate eggs, and filled some with little marshmallow chicks.  very cute and easy.

We made these cute nests last Easter. I used white chocolate chips. The project was perfect to do with my then-3-1/2 year old. We will make them again this year. The nests are quite small if made according to the recipe, so be sure to look for mini-jelly beans to fill the nest.

Adorable, easy, and fun for kids and me ;) I also made some with toasted coconut (425 and WATCH IT CAREFULLY!!) and peanut-butter melting candies, so they not only were brown and lifelike, but SO GOOD. Thanks for the idea!!

Everyone loved these. I followed the recipe, but after adding the chocolate, it looked dry, so I added two more ounces. Next time I would stick with the 6 oz. They are still great, but you don't get that nesty coconut look with extra chocolate. It's more creamy then. These are so cute for Easter. I wrapped individually with colored celophane and a bow, and they looked great. Thanks for the recipe!

Coconut bird's nests have always been one of my most favorite Easter treats.  I used real white chocolate instead of candy coating and even made a batch using milk chocolate for those who are not white chocolate fans.  These are a coconut lovers dream!  Note:  If using real white chocolate, omit the 1/2 tsp. milk and be sure to use food coloring  that is designed for chocolate.  Otherwise, it will seize the chocolate.

I thought these were REALLY cute! I thought they would be more white chocolate-y,It was more like just enough white chocolate to hold the coconut together. We will make them again but I think I'll add more white chocolate! Oh and we used little candy coated chocolate eggs in the middle. Definitely a fun family project! :)

I made these for Easter and they were a hit.  The first time I made them I mistakenly thought the recipe called for 1/2 CUP of milk instead of 1/2 teaspoon.  Needless to say, there was a mess and I started over.  My little grandson thought these were great and so did my husband.  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

These shown in the picture were my 8 year, Kaitlyn's, creation. After making these, I decided to make another batch but this time I toasted the coconut and left out the milk and food coloring. I absolutely loved them.

Thank goodness for this recipe.  I have always bought the Russel Stover of these nests for my mom every year.  Last year they only made the chocolate ones and that is the same this year.  Now, I can still get these for my mom and they are even more personal now!

These are super cute, super easy and super sweet (what do you expect from all that sugary stuff folks!).  My 5 year old had a blast making them.  It took less than 15 minutes to make 24 start to finish with "kid" help.

My kids had so much fun helping me make these and they disappeared so quickly as my kids just loved them.  I ended up making 3 more batches during the same week and sent some to the neighbors who came and asked me for the recipe.  A definite keeper.

Turned out great the first time!  Used almond bark and they are perfect.  Thanks Carol for an easy, quick, darling little treat.

I tinted my coconut in a gallon size plastic baggie, placing 3 drops of food coloring directly onto the side of the plastic bag (omitting milk). If works better this way than dropping the food coloring directly onto the coconut. Then with a few quick shakes it was nicely tinted. I used white chocolate morsels since I couldn't find the confectioner's coating, which would have been okay if I hadn't added a 1/2 tsp vanilla extract for flavoring. This little bit of liquid made the chocolate seize up. I then had to add 1 tsp of canola oil to melt the chocolate back into the correct consistency. All in all the came out great, and I got lots of compliments.

I made this recipe because the nestsare really cute and I thought my kids would enjoy helping.  I really didn't expect them to taste very good, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are actually quite good.  Yes, they're very sweet, but that should surprise anyone.  I filled them with three Cadbury's candy-coated chocolate eggs per nest.  They looked even better than expected.  Everyone was impressed with the results.  The candies come together quickly and are a snap to prepare.  This recipe may become part of an Easter tradition.

Incredibly cute, and great if you're just going for looks. However, people were kind of unsure of what the nests were and were hesitant to eat them.

I make a version of this. 2 differences 1: use toasted coconut. 2: Chocolate almond bark. I am going to try milk chocolate chips next time. The toasted coconut makes a world of difference.

I have made these three times in the past week.
When I was little, my mother bought the Russell Stover edition of these. I kept looking for them this year, but now they are DARK BROWN and have NO egg candy in them. So I came across these and got SO SO excited. They taste similar to the original BUT BETTER! I am so excited about these, I plan to make them every year.

Is there really such a thing as white confectioners coating?  I asked my sister what it was, and she had never heard of it.  She said what was meant was powdered sugar--so I bought that.  Needless to say, the nests didn't turn out.  When I got home from the store I saw the comment on what confectioners coating was and went back to the store--but that doesn't mean I actually FOUND any.  Next time I try these I guess I'll give white chocolate chips a spin.  The nests in the picture look quite yummy.  I didn't know when to say "when" on the green food coloring so mine look more like real grass--only very watery.  LOL

Although these nests are very cute, the taste is not as pleasing. I recommend this recipe with actual milk chocolate. MUCH yummier.

I knew these would be sweet, but it was much too sweet for my taste using confectioners sugar.  Not sure if that what was meant by confectioners coating or not.  Wished I had used sweetened condensed milk like a regular macaroon recipe.
