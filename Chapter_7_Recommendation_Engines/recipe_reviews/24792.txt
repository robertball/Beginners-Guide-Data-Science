Oh my GOD!!  This was awesome - I did however make a few changes.  Instead of broth and flour I used a can of "cream of chicken" soup.  I used red pepper flakes instead of regular black pepper and I added a bit of whole garlic(minced) and soy sauce.  I also used apricot preserves as well as orange marmalade.  It was better then Panda Express!!

I'm going to be honest, this was horrible.  I didn't even serve it.  I had the chicken sauteed, and the sauce simmering and it smelled awful,  I  was ready to add the chicken but decided to give the sauce a taste first, I'm sure glad I did, It was the worst.  I thought it was maybe just me so I called my husband over and made him try it.  After that it went straight down the drain and I made the chicken into a different recipie.  I love marmelade so that was not the problem.  It was the combination of all of the flavors, they just did not go together I thought.

This recipe is fabulous! I've made it for friends on many occasions, and I've never had a dissatisfied customer. When I make it, I add 1/4 cup of soy sauce to tame the sweetness/orange flavor. I also use two skillets and cook the chicken and sauce simultaneously. Oh and to the geniuses who complained about the taste of orange peel, how about you STRAIN THE SAUCE before serving it? I always look forward to cooking this dish!

It is super easy and fast but way too sweet for our liking.  We added dashes of salt, chopped green and red bell peppers and some minced garlic just to make it less sweet. I would suggest reducing the maralade and/or added some soy sauce or something to reduce the sweetness.

I made this recipe for my family tonight. I was expecting it to turn out the way it looks in Chinese resturaunts. Now don't be discouraged to make this recipe just because it looks unpleasant. The taste was very yummy and I would make it again. I only added a pinch of pepper because it is not my favorite taste. I added a little more Lemon Juice that the recipe called for. There was a lot of sauce, but when served over rice it is just right!!

This was very easy and fast. I did not like the taste of the marmalade with chicken. I won't make this again.

Thanks for such an easy recipe!! It was great! The second time I made it, I reduced the marmalade to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup soy sauce. I also cut the chicken up into bite size pieces, battered and fried them before adding them back to the sauce. Thank you!!

I served this dish to company and got rave reviews.  I took advice of other reviews and added green and red bell peppers as well as a little extra lemon juice.  We didn't find this dish very sweet at all.  The difference in sweetness may be due to the type of marmalade that is used.  We found the dish refreshingly tart.  Thank you for sharing!

OK--so I stole this tip from Rachael Ray... it occurred to me that the complaints could be because the flour didn't have a chance to cook.

I sprinkled the flour over the chicken drippings and let it rest for a minute, then stirred in the chicken stock. After it thickened a bit, I stirred in the marmalade and lemon juice.

It turned out to be pretty tasty!

I read all the reviews and decided to try the recipe anyway.  I've made it twice now, and it's not that bad at all.  We actually liked it!  Here's what I did differently to make it good: I chunked the chicken and rolled it lightly in flour mixed with seasoned salt, garlic powder and black pepper.  I sauteed it in olive oil the first time (not bad) and sesame oil the second time I made it (next time I'll mix vegetable oil and sesame oil -- just sesame oil had a good flavor, but it didn't brown as well as I'd like).  I used apricot preserves instead of orange marmalade (I had that in the fridge) and added minced garlic, crushed red pepper and a few glugs of soy sauce to the sauce.  It's really not a bad recipe -- a bit sweet but good.  My husband loves this recipe, especially since I made rice to go with it for the extra sauce.

As written this is mearely average at best.  I also think the cooking times are way off!  You will need to cook the chicken much longer. I added some red pepper and thyme and still found it bland!

Sorry, but this wasn't what I was expecting.  It was a thick gloppy floury gravy, uncooked at the
time recommended.  My three growing boys will eat anything, I just experiment for fun.
None of them would touch it.   One of them experimented with just drizzling a little fresh squeezed
OJ over some cooked chicken and they all like that better!

A waste of ingredients!

For those that want a stronger orange flavor, try adding some orange zest.  Works for me!  I also used cornstarch rather than flour. Very good!

This recipe is delicious, I cooked for Valentines day, and We enjoyed the recipe immensly. Although I did doctor up the recipe a little, and you may wan to consider maybe addinf, a 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and seasoning the chicken with season salt. But the Recipe was great. Thanks.

Came out very good. made some slight changes. I sauted chicken with butter. I added canned mandarin oranges and some juice, the oranges mashed up so in the future I would add at the end. I seasoned chicken with salt and pepper and excluded pepper from the sauce, instead I used red pepper flakes. you can make as mild or hot as you like. I also added a little orange extract. Sauce came out really sweet and spicy, was delicious

I liked the Orange Chicken recipe.  I used Low Sugar orange marmalade and I think that is the key because regular maramalade is so sweet.  Then I added just a bit of sugar and did a taste test.  I do wish I has some soy sauce, cause I think that would have cut the chicken broth taste a bit (used low sodium broth).  I cut the chicken up and made some rice.  I liked it!!

Thanks Sarah, this was so easy and delicious, makes a nice impression. Everyone enjoyed it. I was a little nervous when I mixed the flour in, it did not look very good, but I cooked it as directed, then tasted it before I put the chicken in, the whole texture and appearance changes when you cook it, so go beyond the first impression.  Thanks again for a very easy yummy recipe.

This turned out quite nicely. I used no sugar added Marmalade. Perhaps regular would have given the dish a bit sweeter flavor. But for diabetics it is the best solution. Will certainly have this recipe again. Over a bed of rice with a greek salad very good.

I made this for dinner tonight and while the dish is very quick and easy to prepare with ingredients on hand out of the pantry, it was pretty boring.  The flavour wasn't that great, but I did change a few things.  The recipes says to cook the chicken, but in what?  In a dry pan?  Not the best idea, so I added a couple of teaspoons of olive oil to the pan and browned the chicken in that.  Instead of using orange marmalade, I used apricot preserves.  I also cooked the flour, if you don't do this you will have a nasty tasting mess in the end.  I think if you're going to try this dish, you should add some garlic and shallot (or onion), and make sure you season the chicken.  With these changes, it might be alright...but I doubt we'll find out I'm afraid.

Sorry, but this really didn't suit our tastes. The orange marmalade made this too sweet & the sauce was too runny. I won't make this again.

This was very good.  I didn't have quite enough orange marmalade, so I added a tablespoon or so of duck sauce (which had peaches and pineapple as some of the ingredients) and it came out great.  I served it over basmati rice with steamed asparagus.  It'll be a staple in our house from now on.

Very good sauce. Added some garlic and hot peppers to it to recreate the orange chicken sauce at our favorite, though now closed, Chinese restaurant.

I had my husband whip up this recipe the other night because it sounded really quick and easy.  It was quick and easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand, but it wasn't quite what I expected.  I'll make it again, but not often.

I made this exactly according to the directions (ALWAYS do the first time).  I served it over rice with peas on the side.  Near the end of the meal, my picky twelve year old asked, "Is there anymore of the chicken stuff?"  I said yes.  Excitedly she said, "There is?!!"  I looked at her funny and she said, "I'd like a little more of everything please."  So, not a gourmet meal with sophisticated taste, but we like it and our daughter loved it.  Plus it was very easy and quick - always a good thing.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it. I made a few changes (like everyone does). I cut my chicken into bite-sized pieces and sprinkled them with some ginger and lemon pepper and baked them at 400 for about 15 or 20 minutes, turning them halfway through. I also added some ginger to the orange sauce. My husband didn't like all the ginger but everyone else did. Oh and my rice, I added some ginger, cinnimon, and onion powder to the rice as well. There looked like a lot of sauce when I was cooking it, but there isn't much left over!

My 11 year old son is working on his cooking badge for Royal Rangers and decided to make this for dinner.  I read the reviews and was very skeptical, but he had his heart set on making it.  If you like orange marmalade it's not a bad dish.  Although he did go a little "wild" on the marmalade!  That may have helped with the flavors.  All in all not a bad dinner.  He served it with rice.

omitted brother and lemon juice added 1/4c soy, 1/4c orange juice, 1/4c white sugar, and 1/4c honey to sauce.  I thought this made it ok but my fiance thought it was great.  will make again with these changes and might play around a bit more with the flavor.

If I could give it zero stars I would. It is a bad combination of ingredients, nothing could make it better. I ended up eating the chicken by itself with rice. I make many recipes off of allrecipes.com, and this is the first one to disappoint.

Well, I love orange chicken but the original posted recipe just isn't even close. Sorry Sarah, but I have to agree with the other reviews - it's not good. I tried to salvage it by adding very liberal doses of brown sugar, soy sauce and garlic powder. Had to then thin it out with water. Substituted boneless chicken with frozen popcorn chicken and added a bag of frozen Chinese veggies. Mixed in cooked white rice too. After all that it was okay -edible at least- but still maintained a slightly bitter after-taste.

I wish I could give this recipe a better rating but I'm afraid I was disappointed. Don't expect this recipe to make the kind of "orange chicken" you find at Chinese restaurants-- this chicken was a flour-y, goopy mess that my family wouldn't even eat. I'm sure some people would enjoy it, but not if you're expecting what you get at restaurants. I'll have to keep looking to find out how to make Chinese-style orange chicken.

I served this chicken for a bridge potluck.  I cooked it before I left and put it in a crockpot on low with the sauce over it.  It kept very well and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I served it with a wild rice mixture in a separate container.  I think I might try putting the rice under the chicken when I serve it at home in a casserole dish.

I can't believe any of the bad reviews this was getting. This is a quick, easy, and delicious dish. I made this for my dad, who has heart disease and eats very low fat. I used low sodium, low fat chicken broth. He loved it. I will continue to prepare and enjoy this. Thanks for the recipe, Sarah.

This is one of my favorites.  Using the orange marmalade makes it so much easier than some of the other recipes on here.  also added a little garlic and ginger.   I used the whole jar of marmalade instead of 2/3.  I served it with jasmine rice and grilled yellow bell peppers and onions.

I thought this recipe very tasty. I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic to the chicken while it cooked then added a little fresh ginger to the sauce. I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to replace the flour to make it gluten free. since I had to modify the recipe somewhat I felt it needed more thickening.

Hubby said this is a keeper-loved the sauce!  With suggestions from other reviews, this was a great recipe:  After browning chicken, sauted 1/2 green and red pepper, 1/4 c chopped onion, 1 chopped garlic clove in small amount of oil, then added liquid mixture to pan to thicken.  I also added 1/4 cup soy sauce at the end.  This recipe was even better the next day.  I served it with broccoli and brown rice. Delish!

This is super recipe.   I cooked the chicken whole and in the oven.  The only thing I will do different next time will be rotate the chicken while its are cooking.   I also used a mixture of dark and white meat.

Did not care for this recipe at all. It had a good concept but did not come out tasting anything like orange chicken. My husband didn't care for it either and he eats MRE's

very good dish. Needed a little less broth and more marmalade contrary to the actual posted recipe. It all depends on personal preference. Will have again with changes! Great with cous cous.

I didn't care for the flavor of this. It was rather bland almost flour tasting and the orange flavor wasn't sweet but more bitter due to the marmalade. Overall, not too crazy about it. Also the appearance was not appealing. It looked like a beige paste with lumps of ckicken.

I was expecting the "Panda Express" type or Orange Chicken - so this was not what I intended to make.  Rating for what it was supposed to be though - it was still not one that my family raved about.  For us..it was just so so.

I wish I could give this zero stars. I had very high hopes for this recipe and was very disappointed. It looked easy and tasty but proved otherwise. I followed the recipe to a "T", but the sauce was HORRID. It tasted like I was eating a jar of marmalade mixed with flour.

this was a great recipie once i did a few alterations.  first of all, when i sauteed the chicken i placed orange slices underneath the cuts (i was concerned that the only orange flavor would be coming from the sauce.. it was unneccessary however, as it was a bit overly orangey for my taste).  for the sauce i used a 10 ounce can of condensed cream of chicken soup instead of chicken broth which eliminated the need for the flour.  at the suggestion of other reviews i reduced the amount of marmalade, increased the amount of lemon juice, added garlic and soy sauce.  it took longer to cook than it said it would but that wasnt a big deal.  it was very tasty and even my boyfriend liked it (and he is very picky, particularly with chicken).  i will make it again, but not for awhile... ive had my fill of orange for a bit.

this is only the second recipe I've tried off all recipes, but I enjoyed it.  I want to make a helpful review for people out there who are skeptical of trying this.  First off, I was pleased with the meal to an extent, and I'm giving it four stars becuase I think I can make it better.  The sauce really didn't "do" anything for me... it didn't taste like restaurants' orange chicken does, rather, I tasted the marmalade a lot, and it didn't really have any "kick" to it, as restaurant orange chicken often does.  I would love to get feedback on what other things people have tried in order to make the taste more bold, and... orange chicken like.  The 7 minute cook time is definetly not enough.  I cooked the chicken at 375, and it took 14 minutes for it to cook.  The sauce was too thin - this is probably my fault, but I'm wondering on some good ideas to make the saucer thicker.  Many people have commented that the sauce was like a paste, but.. this was not my experience at all.  The flavor was good, but I wished it was a tad thicker.  I would love to bread the chicken, and see how that tastes too.  Overall, this is a good recipe... but, I'd really like to see some tweaking of it to make it better.  Thanks Sarah... this is one I'll work on in my kitchen to perfect to my tastes.

This was tasty, but for some reason I thought it would be a bit sweeter.  That was my own interpretation and not the fault of the recipe.  It just wasn't my most favorite thing.

I was not so sure about this recipe at first. I think it was the taste of the sauce without adding the chicken first. My husband told me to just try it anyways. We really enjoyed the change, it was very good, a little different, but tasty and a nice change from regular old sauteed chicken. We would just like to say to all of the people out there who poured it down the sink without tasting the full effect.....you dont know what you missed!!! Thanks Sarah

Although simple to make with a nice presentation over a bed of rice, my salt lover thought something missing.  I personally thought that it was refreshingly light and tasty.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks.

This was good. I sprayed my skillet with Pam Spray. I did add some garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning to the chicken. You can also use the light marmalade for low fat. I did cook my chicken longer than the recipe stated. Thanks!

The sauce was too floury and thick and definitely not what I was expecting.  Not enough orange taste either.  The chicken was very tender, though.

Thankfully I took other people's recommendation and cut the marmalade in half, subbing in soy sauce.  

I can tell it would have been far too sweet otherwise. 
That said, this was super fast and easy and the whole family is loving it.

When I made the sauce I added the flour to some of the chicken broth and stirred it in after the rest of the ingredients came to a boil. I did add soy sauce. It did help some with the sweetness. I also added red pepper flakes. My kids liked it but would like it to be spicier. They wanted more red pepper flakes and less orange marmalade. I probably will make it again but will try and tweak it some more. My kids would like me to try adding jalapenos next time.

I missed the hot chili peppers to offset the sweetness of the orange marmalade. Black pepper didn't work for me. I didn't like combining flour and broth with the marmalade. Perhaps cream of chicken soup instead like one reader suggested.

I thought this was okay.  To me it kind of tasted like a healthier version of orange chicken.  I did follow some suggestions that others made, such as adding soy sauce.  I probably won't make this again.

I'm pretty much incapable of not tweaking a recipe! The sauce was a bit bland (too much chicken broth flavor) as I was cooking it so added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger,  another tsp. juice, another 1/4 C. marmalade and dash of crushed red peppers. Family loved it and will definitely make again.

Love this! I make it as often as possible, I too let the flour cook a bit before mixing everything else in and add soy sauce. So delicious.

Delicious. Only changes I made was to bread the chicken first and then added red pepper flakes to sauce for more of a kick. Tastes like a sweet and spicy orange chicken. Yummy!!!!!

Absolutely does not get you Orange chicken. Flavor is less than mediocre and consistency is similar to cooked chicken in slightly orange gravy. Avoid this recipe.

I think the chicken would be better if it were lightly fried first. This dish was kind of bland.

As it is this is not a great flavor but as someone mentioned I think it really has to do with the marmalade you use. I had a sugar free one on hand and it wasn't that good. I saved the dish by adding a bit of soy sauce and fresh ginger. With the changes it will become

Very good! Didn't LOVE it, but it was still satisfying to my family.  I made a modified version and it was delish! I added  2 tbs of soy sauce, 1 tsp of honey & a couple dashes of ginger to the marinade. The flour made it come out more "gravy like". Next time I'll prob reduce the flour by half.  I also sprinkled orange zest to bring the full  flavor out.

I rated this a 4 taking into account how easy it is.  As far as taste, it's pleasant but not fantastic. This will be a quick  week night meal that I'll add to my rotation but not something I'd serve to guests.  All in all its pretty good.

This was fantastic.   I told my kids I know how to make Panda Express.  Lol.  I took advice from other reviewers and added a few gallops of soy sauces and some bell peppers. Also let the flour cook for a few minutes before adding the sauce.  Great receipt.  :)

Loved this recipe! (: We had some chicken that needed to be used up, and I was really craving orange chicken, but didn't want the fried kind since we're both trying to eat healthier, and I must say, this is TOTALLY worth it. I really liked the sweetness of it, but my significant other likes things saltier, and added some soy sauce on his plate. The only changes I made was that instead of lemon juice I used orange juice, that's what we had around. I also went to the store to get the marmalade since we never have it. I suggest using a not super cheap kind, since the Great Value kind had no flavour at all... So I just used about a tablespoon of more OJ to fix that. All in all, very yummy recipe, thank you so much for sharing! c: ~NaNa x?x

Too much flour definitely. Had a good taste my daughter liked it but it was a bit strong for other family members.  I may try to tweak it if I make it another time I think the concept was going but the flavor was just a little too strong

This recipe was quick and easy to make I made half of the orginally recipe due to what chicken I had left. The sauce was very quick to  thicken. Although the sauce didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped which is why I'm giving this recipe 3 stars instead of 4 stars.

I love orange chicken. I unfortunately used some rice with it that wasn't very good, but your recipe was easy to follow and worked amazingly. My fiance even liked it and he's had authentic orange chicken (He was Navy). Gotta love it. Thank you so much.

i think it was good, but not like the resturants.  my best recomendation is to add brown sugar. if you need thin out the sauce alittle too, to balance it. but the sauce should be thick like @ the chinese resturants. But it made a good meal and most of my family liked it.

Very good overall. I sauteed onions and celery first, added some non-salt seasonings.  Found some "sweet" marmelade at the store so mine wasn't bitter, like others have mentioned. I would make it again for sure. Thanks Sarah!

This was just ok.  I love marmalade but it was a little too sweet and perhaps too much flour, as it was very pasty.  I should've added some water at some point, since I had no more broth available.  Chicken definitely needs to cook longer.  MIGHT try again but not until I try altering it somehow.  Easy to make.
