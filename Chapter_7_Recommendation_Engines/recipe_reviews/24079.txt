Although this is good with butter, it's even better with olive oil.  Give the oil a try and then add some parmesean cheese to top.  MMMM

I enjoyed this recipe alright the first time I made it by following the directions perfectly. The next time I made it I added tomatoes, mushrooms and basil to the butter and garlic and sauteed them all together. Much tastier that way. I am going to make it this way again for dinner tonight.

This just happens to be my favorite way to eat pasta.  On days when I need extra zip in my life I like to add a few red pepper flakes and of course, coarse black pepper.  Thanks for reminding me.  I just might have this for dinner.

My favorite comfort food - I make this all the time.  I do use a little more garlic, and probably not as much butter.  I also throw in a little parmesan and some cajun seasoning in when I toss everything together.  Perfect side dish when you have a fancy main course.

Yummy dish that uses ingredients most people already have.  My husband and I added more garlic and used less butter, as per someone else's suggestions.  We also added some fresh rosemary, ground black pepper, and a little cajun seasoning.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again!

Easy, simple, and delicious. What could be better? I had a bit of spaghetti I had to use up (only enough for one serving), so this was perfect for a quick dinner. Thanks, Sue.

This is delicious. I modified it just a bit because I was serving it as the main dish. I added shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes.  Used 2 sticks of butter, sauteed the mushrooms until they were brown and soft, added the precooked shrimp, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder (all to taste). You could also add basil or parsley if you want, but I didn't.  I also added just a drizzle of olive oil, about 1/4 cup of the pasta water and parmesan cheese.  Thank you!

I added a pick sweet steamer bag to this recipe (chicken with summer vegetables). It was wonderful! I added some extra virgin olive oil to the butter to add to its flavor. Will absolutely make again!

This recipe is yummy! But I did some modification. I added salt to taste and some oregano and Parmesan cheese. I eye-balled it so I cant really help with the measuring. But when you cook the pasta you should add salt, oregano, and a clove of garlic. Trust me it makes a huge difference.

Hahahaha!  I ate this in college when I was too broke to buy much of anything else.  I didn't realize back then that it had a "fancy name", but I still make it to this day - especially when hubby is out of town and I'm on my own for dinner.  Just make sure you use your napkin for a bib!  Delish and simple!

This was amazing.  I made it the way the recipe said except for adding just a little olive oil to cover the bottom of the skillet before adding the other ingredients.  We put spaghetti sauce on top and my family said it was the best spaghetti they had every had.  The only thing different was the way the spaghetti noodles were cooked so there you have it.  Will definitely be using this recipe again.

Comfort food!  Pasta at it's best!  Kids love it this way, as do adults.  I like to add some olive oil, coarse black pepper, salt, red pepper flakes and of course parmesan cheese! Bon appetite!

I made this last night as a side to chicken saltimbocca and both myself and my boyfriend liked it WAY better than the main dish! It's simple, tasty, and takes 2 minutes to do with cooked pasta. For leftovers, I combined it with my other side dish (peas sauteed with garlic, olive oil, shallot, and proscuitto), and it was delicious! On taste alone I would probably give it a 4, but when you factor in simplicity, it's worth a 5.

Very quick and simple dish to prepare. I doubled the amount of garlic because I love the stuff and gave a generous sprinkle of black pepper in there. It was delicious! I served it with Grilled Scampi (recipe on this site) so it wouldn't take away from the flavour of the shrimp. It was a perfect combination!

Instead of adding Cajun seasoning the the pasta we grill some very spicy/Cajun Shrimp and add them to the pasta.  Makes a great meal.

I used olive oil, a bit more garlic, added basil and oregano and salt and ate it with parmesan and shredded cheese. I cut the amount of oil down quite a bit and still found it a bit to greasy. Overall it was a very yummy way to eat spaghetti!

I make this all the time but sauté the garlic in butter and olive oil. I top the pasta with parmesan and romano cheese and sometimes add diced yellow squash to the dish.
