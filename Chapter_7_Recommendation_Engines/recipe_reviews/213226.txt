This is an excellent breakfast.  It is tasty, healthy, and filling.  Also, it tastes great as a leftover warmed up in the microwave.

This is quite tasty. I did add garlic and a little diced pancetta that needed to be used up. I also didn't remove my cooked potatoes and onions to another dish to mix with the eggs; instead I poured the egg mixture right into the skillet, then lifted and tilted to get the egg smoothed around evenly. I just didn't see the point in dirtying up another bowl :) The instructions are partly missing a step: Once the eggs are in the skillet, you must cook it til the eggs are soft-set on the stovetop before finishing it off in the oven. Or just plan to bake it longer in the oven :) Thank you for the recipe, I think that with a heavy dose of garlic this would be 5-star!

Very good.  The smoked paprika gives it good flavor. I also like a southewestern variation of this dish containing a clove of garlic, chopped red pepper, 1 ear corn kernels, and cilantro instead of parsley.  This is a great base recipe that you can change to your family's taste--or use whatever odds and ends you have in the fridge.

Very good recipe. To make it easier, I boiled the potatoes the day before and followed the recipe as written. However, at the bottom it states to bake in the oven for 5 minutes. At the top it states 25 minutes which is much better. I still took it out of the oven,flipped it on a plate and returned it to the skillet for a few more minutes. My husband is from Spain and loves this dish but the traditional way uses more oil and takes longer so thanks; I'll make it more often now.

Great recipe, my dad used to eat this all the time as a child and raves when I make it for him. I also used to work in a tapas restaurant and the recipe is very similar. I do not personally use parsely but instead add green onions on top before baking it. Also try adding spicy chorizo which totally elevates the dish!

I spent 5 years living in Spain as a kid & this was my favorite dish! If you  really want to make it authentically, stick to just the eggs, onion, & potatoes. Keep the potatoes sliced thin & do the same with the onion. Fry both in a large omelet pan with olive oil until golden brown. Beat eggs separately, without any milk or oil. Once items in the pan are ready, pour the eggs directly on top, making sure it's not too thick. Season the tortilla before the eggs set.Cook until eggs are fairly well set, then carefully flip the tortilla & cook the other side. Should be thin once done & extremely delicious! Brings me back to my childhood every bite!:-)

This was just fabuloso! I did not change a thing in this recipe and it turned out amazing! I served this as one of the items on my Xmas brunch table and it was very well received.  Will definitely be making this again and again! :) Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great, basic recipe, but can actually be much easier to prepare than the directions listed if you have a good non-stick pan.  I make this all the time, but after cooking the potatoes and onions, I turn the heat down and add the egg mixture (I add a little milk rather than more oil) directly on top of the veg.  I sort of go around the pan lifting up the cooking edges with a spatula to let more of the uncooked egg mixture run down under the cooking egg onto the pan.  Then after a few minutes, I turn it onto a plate and then slide the uncooked side directly back into the pan to cook for just a few more minutes.  Then slide it out onto my serving dish and it comes out in a perfect shape.  No baking required.

I halved the recipe because I am not a huge fan of eggs, plus I'm single.  But I wanted to try a Spanish recipe because I'm learning the language and wanted to connect to the culture.  To my surprise, it came out great, and the taste of eggs didn't overpower me.  I did make a few adjustments....I used red potatoes instead (which I believe cook faster), and I used Old Bay seasoning) (my favorite in place of the smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.  I used a small white onion instead of a sweet one, and I used dill instead of parsley.  Finally, I made sure that the bottom of the eggs were brown before putting it in the oven for about 6 minutes.  Excelente!

I made this exactly as directed. It tasted fantastic. Not quite enough eggs as I remember this dish having in Spain, but very close. The bake time is definitely 25 minutes (not 5). I had a lot of trouble with the potatoes sticking to my skillet, which is unusual; next time I will transfer the mix to a pie dish to bake.

I added a clove of garlic and chorizo - fried lightly for about 1 minute, then added the potatoes and onions back into the skillet, and poured the egg mixture over all. Will be making this one again!

This was a great recipe and I Almost ranked it five stars.  I think garlic would be a good addition, although it might not be traditional.  Also the American in me wants to add cheddar but I want to respect the authenticity.  I did add green onions as seen in my pic I uploaded.  I ate it with green salad with vinegarette which goes well.  Excellent and fun to make!  I also drained my potatoes on paper towels.

Great recipe. Yes, I definitely needed a little more time in the stove but it came out wonderful. I left out the parsley since I was trying to recapture the spanish tortillas that I so enjoyed on the Camino de Santiago.  Now I need to find a good cafe con leche recipe although my homemade mocha is not a bad substitute.

The recipe was a little more complicated than I expected. After telling me that it was a little bit bland, my son added ketchup, he then decided he liked it and ate practically the whole thing. Next time, I’m going to bake inside of my silicone muffin cups, and I’m also going to add some garlic to the recipe like another chef recommended.

Loved it. Added some spice with 3 shakes of Cholula and a pinch of chili pepper and if you really want to add some spice include a pinch of red pepper flakes. 
 I didn't peel the potatoes, too many nutrients in there to waste.

My 5th grader learned about “tortilla española” in Spanish class & was very excited to make it, so we decided Easter would be the perfect day to serve it.  I added chopped red pepper & some ham.  Everyone - even the kids enjoyed it.  My husband said it was too “potato heavy” (I don’t believe in such a thing!). We’ll be making this again!

I liked this, even without adding any parsley or chives.  This is an onion-lover's breakfast, for sure.  I served on a bed of fresh spinach, and garnished with avocado slices and baby tomatoes.  Good start for Valentine's Day, or any day you have time.  For me, adding the paprika at the beginning masks the color, and it was hard to judge when things were lightly browned.  Next time, I will add the paprika and the salt after the onions have had a bit of time to cook.  I added the eggs to the skillet, let them set, then placed in the oven.  No need to mess up another pan.  Thanks for the idea!

This was even better than expected! Admittedly, I'm a sucker for smoked paprika, and I did double it in the recipe, but that's all I changed.  I did find it took quite some time to make simply because it is impossible to fry 2 sliced potatoes all in 1 pan! But it was all worth it.  I'm anxious to try it again with some of the variations other reviewers mentioned!

I thought this was great and very easy. Used much less oil than a lot of the recipes I'd seen online and that was appreciated. Kids devoured it. We added a little cheese and some chorizo but I don't think it is needed.
