I love Mandu. This is a great recipe using ground beef or pork. Just like my mother in law made. She's Korean. I do suggest making the dipping sauce to go along with it. Soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, green onions, sesame oil, sesame seeds, Korean chili powder and sugar. Let the sauce sit before eating. I feel the flavor a meld together better. I usually made my sauce the night before or several hours before I made the Mandu.

Not at all like the Mondu my Korean friend taught me to make years ago.  It never made it to get wrapped.  Maybe if I add some cabbage and make egg rolls out of it. 
Just not the right flavor for mondu.

Loved these when stationed in Korea.  So excited to finally make and enjoy them again on a game night with friends.  Thanks.

I've made this twice in the last week. My in-laws  and wife loved it.  The second time I made it for my daughter and she loved it too.  I spent over 4 years in Korea and ate Yaki Mandu often this recipe is right on and is as good as any I ate in country.  I'll be making it often

This is a tasty recipe. We used several types of dipping sauces. It makes every other one a little different. Thanks for the recipe.
