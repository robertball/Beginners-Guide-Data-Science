6-30-2016  ~Fun and interesting to prepare as well as to eat, this was fairly outside of my comfort zone. Ingredients like red curry paste, coconut milk and lemongrass are relatively new for both Hubs and me.  As for the fish sauce, this is our second attempt to like it.  The first time we tried it we agreed it smelled bad and it tasted bad too.  This time around it still smelled bad and tasted bad.  Unfortunately, its flavor was predominant, overshadowing the milder flavors of the other ingredients. I believe had I used less of it or eliminated it completely we would have enjoyed this dish much more. Take a chance if you will, but if you want to play it safe leave it out altogether and just add a little salt to compensate.

This was a good foundation recipe for my own experimentation at developing my own ideal Panang Curry.  

My tweaks: Shrimp instead of chicken. Add 2 Tbsp fresh lime juice, double the basil, add one sliced fresh jalape√±o with seeds.

This is a great recipe with some minor adjustments. I recommend reducing the fish sauce to one tablespoon and increasing the red curry paste to two tablespoons. This is a more typical ratio for American palates, and I would suggest doing this unless you love a fishier tasting broth. You can also add 1/4 in cut summer vegetable such as zucchini or yellow squash or eggplant or long beans to the dish.

Use coconut cream instead of milk, recipe is easily halved. I used baby bok choy and broccoli. Very tasty!

Cooking foreign cuisine was very intimidating but this turned out to be very simple and delicious. I would add other vegetables personally but this opened the door to cooking other Thai dishes!
