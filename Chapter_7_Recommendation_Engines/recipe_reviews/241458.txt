This was a beautiful looking and tasting soup! I am not too familiar with the Coriander spice, but it seems I need to add it in more of my cooking. I also added carrot, and a yellow bell pepper. But other than that, I followed the recipe as it is. I doubled the recipe for my family of four, and I am glad I did. We will look forward to leftovers! Enjoy!

Delicious! Simple and easy to put together this soup hits the spot on a cold evening. The spices are well blended and compliment each other phenomenally. I used 2 cups of drained, boiled chickpeas instead of canned as well as adding a zucchine and a couple of carrots cooking everything in my pressure cooker in 10 minutes. I augmented the water and regret it as it seems to have become more a soup than a stew. So do keep an eye on the liquids if you add more veggies as they will add their own juices. Thank you Anniesails for this recipe.

I enjoyed it but felt it was a bit bland. I added some curry powder and cayenne and it tated a bit spicier

It was great! I added two carrots along with the potatoes. The spices complimented each other well! Really simple and tasty. I had it with garlic bread!

Very simple and tasted great! I especially liked the tomato addition near the end for just a slight kick to the flavour.
