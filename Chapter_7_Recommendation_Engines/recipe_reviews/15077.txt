These are good, but here's a really smart tip if you want to cut out about 1/2 the calories, much of the fat and still keep the great taste:  DON'T FRY THEM.  The only thing that the frying does is make the shells crispy and add a whole lot of fat (1 cup oil is too much fat).  You can get the same crunchiness by scooping out the potato shells and baking them in the oven for 45 minutes at 400 degrees.  Then add the bacon and cheese and broil another 5 minutes (watch so the cheese doesn't burn).  Trust me, why add the fat?

These were fabulous. DON'T FRY THEM!! I put the potatoes in the oven on 400 for about an hour. Then, scooped them out, sprayed the skins with pam, and stuck them back in the oven (425) for about 10-15 minutes. Sprinkled with baco's and cheese for the last 2 minutes. Crispy and delicious.

In an attempt to cut the fat and carbs in this recipe I baked my potatoes in the oven for one hour at 425 degrees. The skins got very crispy, then all I had to do was cut in half and scoop out the pulp. We used a little butter flavored spray, non fat sour cream and chives. Yummy without all the fat. Chivo is another alternative we find pretty tasty.

Potato skins have always been a favorite of ours, but this was the first time I ever made them at home. This is a great recipe as written, but I played with it just a little and was CRAZY happy with the result. I baked the potatoes in the oven early in the day (425 degrees for an hour) and left them on a rack to cool completely. About an hour before frying, I scooped out the flesh and sealed the shells in a zip-lock so they wouldn't dry out. I deep-fried them, seasoned with salt and cracked pepper, filled with sharp cheddar, and baked as instructed for 7 minutes. After removing from the oven, I sprinkled with lots of finely chopped green onion and more cracked pepper. I arranged the skins on a platter with a bowl of sour cream, and drizzled with a tiny bit of white truffle oil. Oh, MY. This isn't something I'll make often, but when you're in the mood for wicked, cheesy, over-the-top indulgence, this is the way to go. Misty, thank you for your wonderful recipe. You made us very happy!

I, too, did not deep fry these but instead baked the potatoes first in the oven, let them cool, then scooped out the insides.  I brushed the inside with a bit of olive oil and baked for about 10 minutes at 425.  I then had added the cheese & bacon into the scooped out portion of potatoes and mixed well, filled the skins with the mixture and then topped with just a bit more shredded sharp cheddar.  After baking for about 10 minutes I turned the oven to broil and broiled just until the cheese was perfect.   Served with fat-free sour cream and diced green onions.  Needed a bit of salt and pepper and they were FANTASTIC!!!

These were awesome! I brought these to a wine tasting party and they were gone before I knew it. I didn't bake them in the microwave but did it the old fashioned way in the oven for about an hour. I wanted the skins to be crisp for easier removal of the potato. Using my "Fry Daddy" was the quickest and easiest way to fry the skins. They came out perfectly crisp and ready for the oven. Thanks Misty! I can't wait for another excuse to make these again.

Delicious! I made a single batch of these and cut them into quarters instead of halves. They were all gone in 2 minutes flat. You need to be careful when cooking in the oil. Mine definitely did not take a full 5 minutes-more like 2-3 depending on how much potato was left on the skin. Will make again but double the recipe. Thanks...this is a winner.

Awesome, my wife went off atkins diet and wanted a rewarding dish! I made these for her as she always did order these as an appetizer when we dined out!

She said mine were as good as the best she remembers!!!

Not Bad huh!?!?

For those of you without a thermometer for the oil it is med high heat! for deep frying on the stovetop!

What a simple yet flavoursome dish.  I served this as a side dish to dinner tonight (sausages, salad and coleslaw) Rather than frying these, I baked them at 250oC (about 400oF) for 20 minutes turning once - don't like my family eating fried foods (I scarcely coated them with vegetable oil). They were super crunchy and when tossed in a salt blend (I tossed then in 1 teaspoon of chicken salt and 1/2 a teaspoon of regular salt) and didn't bother with the bacon or cheese, they practically flew out of the serving dish!!! Misty thank you for such a fantastic recipe - this one is a keeper (my husband wants it for dinner tomorrow night it's that good)

Never made skins before and everyone was extremely pleased.  I took the advice of others on here and baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for 1 hour instead of microwaving it.  Then scooped out the skins, (leaving about 1/4 inch of "meat" left on the skins) sprayed skins with Pam, put back into oven at 425 for about 8 minutes, put on cheese and real bacon bits (bagged) and  then back into oven for about 2 minutes or until cheese has melted.  Served with ramekins filled with sour cream and fresh chopped scallions.  They were so good!!!  The only thing I think I will do differently next time is rub some sea salt on the skins when putting back into oven and frying down some actual bacon, maybe tossing in some seasonings while it's cooking to add a burst of flavor.  Oh, I used the scooped insides to make Shepherd's Pie the following day.

When I made these I did not fry them.  I baked the potatoes till soft.  Scooped out the centers, brushed the insides with a little vegetable oil and baked for about 10 minutes at 400 degrees to crisp them up a bit.  Then I topped the skins with cheedar cheese, crumbled bacon and sliced green onions.  Back into the oven to bake until cheese was piping hot and bubbly.  I serve them with Ranch dressing.  One of our favorite ways to eat potatoes!  Definitely not low-cal or low-fat!  But definitely DELICIOUS!

I like these much better baked in the oven with melted butter poured on top, sprinkled with garlic salt, add chopped green onions, use ONLY real bacon and sharp cheddar, also sour cream as desired.

Great recipe. I would recommend adding some salt, pepper and other spices to the skins after frying. That would add some more zest to these great skins. I topped mine with chives as well. Taste great!

Really good.  Instead of frying, I sprayed the scooped potato skins with olive oil and cooked for ~10 minutes in the oven (450 degrees)to crisp.  I then mixed salt, pepper, butter and a little cream cheese with the scooped mixture, added it to the skins, topped with bacon and cheese then cooked till cheese melted.

My husband just made these for us and I have to say they were great! I was reading all the reviews on not frying them, and that's a wonderful tip but we fryed them. The main reason being: it's quicker. Yes there may be more fat, but it's all in moderation. Not like we eat these every day. Great recipe!! Thank you!

I don't know if it was me but these weren't all that flavorful.  They were crispy but I think I need to look for something else to add to the mix.

Wonderful!  A little time-consuming, but worth the effort.  Sprinkled a little cajun seasoning on potatoes before the cheese to give them a little kick.  All my men were happy!  Thank you Misty!

These are the best potato skins I've ever had! The deep fryer makes all the difference. I loaded mine with bacon and used an herb dip instead of sour cream to dip them in. Next time I'm going to sprinkle a little parmesan on top for a different flavor.

Yum! I skipped the frying part, just brushed with a little bit of melted butter and baked until the skin got crispy then filled them.

Great recipe for fast potato skins, making this version perfect as an appetizer. If you have the time for a healthy alternative, the below recommendations to bake the potatoes instead of frying them taste just as good. Thanks Misty!

I bought a bag of the small potatoes.  I covered a cookie sheet with aluminum foil, placed the washed potatoes on it, sprayed well with cooking spray, coated with salt and baked them for 45 minutes.  Then I proceeded with the rest of the recipe.  I highly reccommend you do the 5 minutes in the frying pan in the hot oil.  This has to be the secret to why they are so good.  I fried them 3 minutes skin side down and 2 minutes 'tater side down.  When I served them I put a small bowl of chopped green onions and one of sour cream to the side so people could "dress" them as they pleased.  Everyone said they were wonderful.  My mother-in-law said they were good and I was a wonderful cook.  That alone was enough to get me to make these again and again!  Thanks so much!

These were amazing. I have never had them before but my boyfriend the expert loved them also. Next time I will try baking them for crispiness instead of frying, then I can eat a lot more. Thank you.

This is the way I usually make my potato skins and they are delicious! I have made them for years. I think they are pretty close to TGIF'
s. Time consuming but worth it! We also like the cheese and bacon potato rounds on this web site that are so fast to prepare. Thanks Misty!

Excellent! It is a little time consuming but worth it! I prefer real bacon over the bacon bits BUT their use saves you a pan. I added some minced green onions and some minced chives. Went well with our chicken wings/finger food dinner! If you get the craving for this...skip the trip to TGIF...these are better! Thanks Misty!

These were great! Instead of microwaving and frying the skins, I baked them first at 450 for 45 minutes, halved and scooped out most of the potato. I put each half on a baking sheet and then I put a small pat of butter in each half and baked again for 5 minutes prior to loading with cheese and bacon. Great taste, non greasy. Also, I used leeks instead of chives. Both ways are great! Thanks for the recipe.

I gave these five stars because I have been making skins for years, but these are by far the best bunch I have ever made at home. Deep frying is critical with this bunch because it adds so much flavor as well as helping to add the needed crispness that so many skins lack. All in all, great dish. I did cook real bacon, however, not bacon bits.

Do not miss trying these!  I made these for the first time about a year and a half ago and these were the best ever.  They remind me of my most favorite potato skins I had many years ago in California.  They are a little work but well worth it if you love potato skins.  The only other thing I added to ingredients was green onion which I love on these.  Delicious!!!

I read the reviews of the others and decided to bake the potatoes in the oven instead of frying them. They were tasty but could've used a little salt. They were lacking a certain something.

Great recipe. I baked the potatoes early in the day and let them cool completely before scooping them out. Then I was able to use the flesh to make potato salad.

Careful not to scoop out too much of the potato meat!  Frying them is a must, and letting them cool/set will avoid cheese oil run-off!

These truely are restaurant-style potato skins. I made as directed, pulling out my old deep fryer from the back of the closet. The shells crisped perfectly. If you don't want to fry but still want crispy shells, brush them with oil & broil for a few minutes on both sides. I would probably add a little more cheese to suit my tastes.

Fantastic! Really not hard at all to make and well worth the effort, just like what you would get at a restaurant. something you would generally only get if you went out so it was a big hit having them at home.

Another winner!  I had a bit of trouble with them not being crunchy enough, although I attribute that to operator error!  LOL  I'll deep fry them longer next time.  Also, definitely brush them with butter before adding the other toppings; makes all the difference!

Tastes just like the ones they serve in restaurants! Paper towels help prevent burns when scooping hot potatoes.

Ok, this recipe got 3 stars for a few reasons.  1. Use real bacon!!  Cook some bacon and then crumble it up beforehand.  2. The potatoes need some seasoning!!  After I fried them (I used my deep fryer for an even fry), I seasoned them with seasoning salt and onion powder.  I then put monterey jack cheese, bacon, then sharp cheddar cheese and broiled until cheese melted.  Then I put dried chives on top.  3. Instead of sour cream, I made the "Ranch Dressing II" from this site and served with that.  Make the ranch the day before so the flavors really come together.  Outstanding!!

Excellent.  I microwaved them for 10 minutes and used a small cookie scoop to clean them out, brushed them lightly inside and out with vegtable oil instead of frying and put under the broiler about 5 minutes each side.  Once a little crispy, I filled them with the cheese and I used Oscar Meyer pre-cooked bacon instead of bacon bits. Put them back in the oven until the cheese was melted.  Since it is football season and we are watching the game, I also served these with the slow cooker buffalo chicken sandwiches also found on this site.  I love pub food night!  thanks for a great recipe, the family loved it.

I made this recipe a while back and just never commented. They were just ok. Here is what I learned: Use a Yukon Gold or Red Skin potato, not russet. (The recipe doesn’t specify type of potato). I scoop the potato from the skins, whip it in a mixer with a little butter and milk. Then I dressed the potatoes with a layer of sautéed onions and mushrooms, top that with Longhorn cheddar and then a half-rasher of bacon. As other's did, I also baked these; I don’t fry anything (it’s too much trouble, not to mention the fat). Take the skins out when the cheese melts, put the mashed potatoes into a funneling bag and squeeze out in equal portions onto each baked potato skin. Put the oven’s broiler on and let the potatoes cook until just lightly browned and crisp (like twice-baked potatoes). When they come out, serve with a bowl of sour cream or thick double cream on the table, extra cheese, and fresh chives. These are equally good using sweet potatoes, just use a good Swiss in place of the cheddar, and don’t broil, as the sweets just turn runny for some reason. Also, as I’m now no longer eating meat, the version I make these days has Baco-Bits instead of bacon. (I just sprinkle them on top of the mashsed potatoes). With a little sautéed seitan or tempeh (or meat) and some veggies, this dish really makes a complete meal.

My family absolutely loved these, although I did alter the recipe slightly.  Rather than frying, once the potatoes were cooked, i lightly brushed with olive oil, and baked them.  Then I filled with chopped green and white onion, and garlic, and topped with cheese and turkey bacon bits, before putting them back in the oven again.  They turned out crispy and very delicious!

These are Excellent!!! Pretty fast considering it is 3 steps, but WELL worth it and frying does make a difference. Only thing extra I added were green onions and baked for 7-10 minutes at 375. You can also freeze these after the frying process to have a quick go to appetizer.

holy moly - these are fantastic! i fried up some bacon before starting and loaded the skins up with the bacon, cheddar/jack cheese from a bag and green onions before popping 'em in the oven. deep frying these made a HUGE difference and i'll never again make potato skins any other way. thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

These turned out wonderful.  After scooping out the potatos, I added real bacon bits and green onions and mixed with the potato mixture, then refilled fried skins.  Topped with chedder cheese, placed in oven till cheese was melted and topped with bacon bits.  Turned out wonderful.

We've been making our potato skins just like this for almost 10 years now. Instead of zapping the potatoes in the microwave, we bake them at 450 degrees for about an hour. We also sprinkle seasoning salt over the cheese and green onions.

These tasted, in my opinion, better than a restaurant!  I fried them in a deep fryer and they came out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Great recipe!

We weren't crazy about these.  The cheese really doesn't get creamy enough for them to be enjoyable.  They also lose their crispiness when baking and are gross once cooled off.  Oh, well!

This is a sensational recipe!  I added chopped cooked chicken to the skins to make more of a meal out of them and served them with a green salad. I received rave reviews at my dinner table!

Turned out yummy!  I used Yukon golds, brushed them with butter, and baked until skins were crispy (instead of frying)  Delicious!

What a great recipe for a special treat!  I did bake the potatoes in the oven instead of the microwave, but followed the rest and they were amazing!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

These sound delicious, but don't have to have nearly the same amount of fat and calories that they have! First of all, I don't think you'll need a whole container of sour cream, I feel like that will overtake the flavor of the potatoes and stuff. Also, try using 2% cheese and reduced fat sour cream, or heck, I even use plain yogurt! I feel like it has the same consistancy and if you add a couple of herbs or other flavorings to it, it will make it a little more flavorful. Also, there's no need to fry it. BAKE, for the same crunch and less oil and fat! So excited to make these!

These were decent potato skins. I baked mine and then followed the recipe exactly. I find that potato skins at home tend to be a little bland, so I sprinkled some garlic salt on them and it definitely enhanced the flavor. I'll make again, but with the expectation to season them up. A good base recipe!

Pretty good!  It went fast at my bf's UFC Fight Night.  But as others said, there's no need for the deep frying.  i took a brush and brushed on some olive oil and garlic salt and baked at 400 degrees for 45 minutes and uesed high quality nonfat plain yogurt instead of sour cream

Very good.  I tried them both baked and fried.  The only real difference was that the fried ones were crispier.  I did add a little garlic salt to them after I fried them (before the cheese) to give them a little more flavor. Because of the very little difference between the fried and baked versions, I will probably make the baked ones again but add a little more garlic salt and a bit of fresh pepper.

These were very good, I used real bacon and green onions for the toppings. Before frying I coated them with paprika, garlic salt and pepper. Topped them off with sour cream once out of the oven. Thanks for the recipe.

I disagree with the other people who say not to fry them.  That's what makes this recipe SO much better than others I've tried.  This really is an easy recipe.  I like to use the scooped-out potato in Baked Potato Soup (also on this site!).

Made these tonight and they are great!! No more paying $8 a plate at a restaurant when we are craving them!!  I would recommend leaving even less potato in the skins or else add a lot more cheese...can be a little dry...however I find restaurant ones can be too.  Worth the work!!

I originally made this recipe as an appetizer, but my husband loved them so much that he asked me to double the recipe so we call all eat them as a dinner.

I chanage it up a bit by using fresh crumbled bacon.  It helps to bake the potatoes in the afternoon so that they can cool down before I have to scoop them.  Then I deep fry them for 3-5 mins before I fill and bake them.  The recipe is so easy and delicious.

A perfect Superbowl snack....these did not last long!
My sister thought they were *better* than a lot of restaraunts.
I used real bacon, and topped it with ranch dressing instead of sour cream.

Very good. Just too fattening. They do taste like restaurant potato skins though and were a huge hit at the potluck I went to. I would make again to share.

These were so good!  We ended up with a bunch of frozen potato skins that I didn't know what to do with. I tried just baking them with the toppings - nope, blah.  This recipe was perfect! (except I did add salt and pepper after I fried them. Thanks!

Made these for the first time last night (for our super bowl party).  They were amazing and a big hit.  Frying the potato made all the difference.  I used fairly large pototoes so I had to keep them in the micorowave about 5 minutes longer.  Will definately make these again!

MY kids really loved them.  My husband and I thought they were a little greasy and a tad flat.  They could use some spucing up.   Salt or lemon juice.  Just a little kick.  Otherwise they were good.

Granted- I am not an experience cook.  However, I just about passed out from smoke inhilation.  For one, I don't have a deep fryer- so I tried the oil in the skillet.  Well you can just about image how it went from there.  I'm sure I had the oil set at too high of a temperature. I ended up charring the potatoes and tossing them out- they were so black they weren't even salvagible or edible.

Very yummy!! : ) I like to make this for my husband and friends, because they just love these potato skins!  These are relatively easy and quick to make. However, I found that I need to cook the potatoes longer in the microwave (about 20 minutes total time). It's probably because our old microwave has a lower than normal wattage.

I baked the skins for 20 minutes at 400 degrees instead of frying. They were nice and crispy. Big hit!

this recipe was a winner with my family. My wife is a vegetarian and I tweaked it by using jalapeños, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, and olives. 

she couldn't stop eating them. Great recipe!!!

DELICIOUS!! Like other reviewers, I opted to bake not deep fry. 400F, potato skins brushed with olive oil...baked for 10-15 min, took out, added cheese and bacon...also made some vegetarian. Mixed up what I had removed from the potatoes with milk/butter and made mashed potatoes, which I then restuffed back into the shells and topped w/bacon/cheese ...not only great potato skins but also turned into twice backed potatoes. Heavenly.

I followed the recipe exactly including the deep frying and glad I did.  They were a wonderful treat.  Not something I will make often, but nice to know I can when the craving strikes again.

I baked these in the oven then followed with the deep fry per the recipe. I do not like baking potatoes in the microwave I have no idea why I just don't care for them. These were really really good my oldest son snarfed down most of them he's never dared to try one before and he fell in love. This is one we will be making at home again as I know its going to be asked for.

These were incredible!! My only complaint was they were a bit greasy. Perhaps they are they are supposed to be like that. But I think next time I will fry them for less time. Anyway, I took them to a superbowl party and they went fast!!

Loved it. To make a low-fat version, we dipped the skins in olive oil but didn't fry them, swapped fried onions (in olive oil) for the bacon, used soy cheese and fat free sour cream. Put them under the broiler for 5 minutes. Perfect for parties, or after-school snacks for the kids.

I made these for the superbowl.  I baked them instead of frying them as others suggested.  Here were my steps.  Microwave whole potatos for 10 minutes or until soft enough to scoop out the middle.  Then bake for about an hour on 350 as others suggested.  Then filled with cheese and bacon and baked for 5 more minutes.  Next time I might season the potatos a little bit before baking to add some flavor to the skins.

Really great recipe, I followed it almost exactly as it shows, I just added some green onion tops.  The only thing I would change is to add a bit more salt.  Yes you can make it low fat, but I say if you're going to make this recipe go all the way.  I would make this again, it was great!

Loved these, a little time consuming but the frying really makes the difference.

Kids really went for these and I didn't have to pay the higher priced brand. I was afraid it would take to long but, using the left over potato for Potato Soup it was worth the little extra time.

THE HIT of the Super Bowl party, these were gone well before anything else.  Enjoyed by everyone, would certainly make again.  Yum-O!

These are excellent. We made these for New Year's Eve and they were so good! Serve with ranch dressing and sour cream! Definitely use cooked, crumbled bacon rather than bacon bits. Bacon bits give these a "frozen/premade" rather than fresh taste, in my opinion.

These were easy to make and so very good.  Hubbie said better than a restaurant because I loaded on the toppings!  Added extra bacon a bit of salt and chives.  Will make again and again!

Y-U-M-M-Y ***** These are better than Restaurant Style ~ I added a tad bit more cheese and bacon and they were very good.  I served them with Ranch Dressing instead of Sour Cream for preference.  They were the first appetizer at the party to be gone and FAST! As far as the recipe/directions...I would not change a thing!

Instead of deep frying the skins, I baked in a 450 oven for 30 minutes, adding the cheese and bacon the last five minutes of cooking time.  They were so great, we didn't even need to dip them in sour cream, just garnished with some fresh chives.

These are so good and I do not even like potato skins. They taste much better than TFIG's because you have the option of how much potato you want to leave and how much cheese and bacon to add.  I can't wait for company to come over so I can make these as a great appetizer

Skins are great, the only thing I don't like with this recipe is each serving is a hollowed out potato half which drips after you first bite them.  I prefer to cut the hollowed out halves into strips of three or four and just pile the cheese and bacon bits on top of the pile of skins then broil.  You end up with slices you eat one by one like potato chips instead of a boat you have to hold in your hand while it drips.

These are incredible!!! Took other's advice and baked potatoes in the oven at 450 for 45 min then I cut in half, scooped most of the potato out, put a dab of butter and back in oven for 5 minutes, then put sour cream, cheese and bacon bits for another 5 min (until cheese is melted) then topped with green onions! great, might add some salt and pepper also for more taste!

We love these!  I, too, omitted the frying step and they turned out great.  I used shredded Colby (since that's what I had on hand) and chopped green onions to sprinkle on top for color.  They are just like what we've emjoyed at Bennigan's.

This recipe was so good and easy to make. I made the skins ahead of time and then just cooked them with the filling later that day-delicious!! oh and i put ranch dressing in each skin before i put in the cheese and bacon bits....They were a big hit at my superbowl party, they were gone in a matter of minutes!

Fantastic! Living overseas it's hard to find favorite foods from home, so it's great when I find a recipe that tastes like home. These are so easy. I got them on the table in about 20 minutes. Microwave to fryer to broiler to melt the cheese. So quick, easy and tasty!

These are yummy and would have been even better if I only had a deep fryer. Shallow frying just didn't have the same effect. Served with green onion, touch garlic powder, sour cream and a splash of BBQ sauce.

Wow!  If I had known they were this easy to make, I'd have been making them years ago.  Mine took a little longer because I decided to bake the potatoes on the first step instead of put them in the microwave.  My teenage girls loved them and they are pretty picky!

I made this recipe today.  Very simple.  Turned out perfect.  I had the potato skins with the bacon and cheese but I really enjoyed putting green onions after baking the potato on top.  Also, I did another variation.  I topped with hormel chili and cheese and after cooking topped with green onion.  Both were good.  Next time, I think I will use Montery Jack cheese, bacon and the when out of the oven top with salsa.  There is no topping variation that you couldn't use.  This is a keeper.

These were a bomb. It was my fault though I tried baking them for 45 minutes and then scooped out the flesh and baked another 30 minutes. Way over done. I'm sure these would be excellent deep fried I just can't bring myself to deep fry anything.

These were only O.K. and am not sure I would make them again. They didn't stay too warm at the table and were really nasty once they were cool. I will still get mine at a restaurant when I'm hungry for them. These were more than a little disappointing.

Excellent! Adults & kids loved these! I browned the potatoes in a skillet with oil and some of the bacon grease, then baked - adding scallions!  Every bit as good as any restaurant.

I baked the potatoes in 400 degree oven for 1 hour, with olive oil on the skin.  Then cooled and scooped out inside.
Baked the skins another 15 minutes... this crisped them up
No frying needed.
Added cheese and bacon and baked a few more minutes until cheese was melted

My family didn’t like these at all. They were bland!  I ended up scooping it all back out and making a twice baked potato casserole which I reseasoned.

Instead of using processed bacon bits, we actually bought real bacon and turned that into bacon crumble! We loved it! I'd definitely recommend this to people and will be making it again.

Never made potato skins before but had then at restaurants and was in the mood for some with dinner, and they are sooo good, tip though, either I have a low wattage microwave or the potatoes needed to me heated longer, I ended up boiling them till they were completely done and I could scoop put the meat. I also put the meat back inside after frying it with butter bacon and cheese and melted cheese on top and served it with chives and sourcream, was a great hit in our house.

Microwaved potatoes first, but Instead of frying, I brushed with oil and cooked it in my airfryer at 400 for 3 minutes as they are small. Then put cheese and bacon and air-fried for 3 minutes at 300 to melt the cheese. My son loved them!

Opting not to fry them but baking them slathered in butter or oil is not going to make much a caloric difference from frying them in canola oil. Additionally, butter, bacon, cheese and sour cream are high in saturated fats, which are what are the unhealthy fats and high in calories. Frying in a plant based oil containing poly and mono unsaturated fat is not the problem here.

A few weeks ago I made the twice baked potatoes casserole from this site.  A reviewer tip suggested saving the skins and I'm glad I did.  I flash froze them and pulled some out today to make these.  My first attempt was great.  Just heated the oven to 400 then added the defrosted skins.  It only took a few minutes until the edges started to crisp.  Then I added shredded cheese and some crumbled bacon.  Popped them back in the oven until the cheese melted and bubbled.  Added some sour cream and a sprinkle of smoked paprika.  These were a great side with my salmon & lemon pepper broccoli.  My second attempt wasn't quite the hit.  After rereading the recipe I used the broiler, setting the timer for 3 minutes, which was about a minute too long.  Will definitely make again as I still have skins from 3 potatoes still frozen, but I won't use the broiler method.  These aren't a light side dish, but added a much enjoyed indulgence!

I baked the potatoes earlier in the day so they would be cool to handle.
I did as some suggested and baked them instead of fry. Turned out great
Next morning I took the left oner potatoes and cooked with a little olive oil, salt, pepper,onion, green pepper, pepperoni and cheese on top for breakfast.....

Very good and easy to make. I think I would have liked them more baked instead of fried.  Heathier baking them and it tasted like oil but it was a good easy recipe. My kids said they were " banging" ! LOL

I bake my potatoes in the oven at 400 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes. I do not fry them, but instead broil them for 5 minutes bottom side up, and then five minutes after stuffed and with the top side up. I love them like that, they taste more like the restaurant style.

I cannot believe I have not rated this yet...I found this recipe years ago and make it a lot especially for football game gatherings.  I can put it together the night before or earlier during the day and pop it in the oven when ready.  I use a Fry Daddy to fry the skins...It's almost a must for this recipe.  Also, the bacon bits are extremely important in the quality and taste...I always use Hormel Black Label Bacon Bits (found by the salad items in the grocery store) I found these to be the most tasteful and I have even tried making homemade bacon bits, but  the Hormel just have a great taste and are nice and soft .... can't stand the crunchy kind of bacon bits.

Super easy! I didn't fry the potatoes because it seemed too much grease, so I just microwaved it with a little seasoning and then followed the rest of the recipe.  It was very delicious!

I baked 6 potatoes in the oven the night before so they would be cool when I cut and scrapped the inside out. I saved the insides to make mashers tomorrow night. I didn't have a deep fryer so I poured about an inch of oil in a deep pot. Heated it up and started deep frying the skins. They smelled so good while I was cooking them. I drained them on paper towels. Shredded a mixture of Co-Jack and Sharp cheddar. Used that, bacon and some green onions. Placed them on a baking sheet and baked them till the cheese was melted and bubbly. They disappeared in 15 minutes. Great recipe!! Thanks!!!

YUM! This is without a doubt restaurant-worthy, lip-smacking (and artery clogging!) G-O-O-O-D!!! :) Although not the healthiest option, it's a real treat to indulge every now and then. PLEASE CONSIDER: If you're looking to cut calories, DON'T make the mistake of passing this by. As others have done, use your oven! If you bake your spuds at 425 for an hour, they will crisp up nicely. You won't even miss the fact that they're not fried (trust me!). Simply coat your potatoes with a little EVOO (this allows them to crisp up) and season to taste with garlic powder, salt and pepper and - voila! TIP: Be SURE to leave at LEAST 1/4 in. of your potato shells INTACT! I scooped a little too much from mine and my hubs commented about that lol! And, why use bacon bits when you can quickly fry up a few pieces of FRESH bacon????? These are extra special, so go all out. After all, you only live once, right??!!? While you're at it, whip up some Ranch flavored sour cream and chop a bunch of scallions to top your skins with (mmmm...). Thanks for sharing your recipe, Misty! This is a winner for sure. :-)

Good recipe!! Tried it for the first time tonight and the whole family really liked it! I microwaved the potato's first (6 min for 2 red potato's--we didn't have russets) and then did as other reviewers suggested and scooped out the insides and sprayed with Pam. Then, put the the oven at 425 degrees for about 15 min's. Besides cheese and bacon we added Top the Tater-Fiesta Taco instead of regular sour cream, plus green onion and tomato's. YUM!!

These were excellent.  I'm running low on oil so I just brushed them with a little olive oil and baked for 10 minutes instead of frying them.  Then after stuffing and baking them they actually crisped up beautifully!  I used real bacon (actually, duck bacon - uncured, smoked duck breast slices) and garnished with sour cream and chopped scallions.  My potato was pretty large, so this ended up being my dinner instead of an appy!

To get the true restaurant taste I shingle the scooped skins together on a baking sheet (so they dont curl) and bake them at 250 degree oven for about 20-30 mins. This will pull excess moisture from the skins which will help them crisp up better when you fry them.

I salted the potatoes before deep frying them and instead of putting them  in the oven we just microwave until the cheese melts. I used REAL bacon bits and green onions.....with a couple of changes, these were great !

Great recipe! My son does not like sour cream, so for a little extra flavour I added a light spread of bbq sauce under the cheese and bacon before baking.  Will make more of those next time. Those seemed to go the quickest, however they all did disappear!

Worth the time to make these... of the five appetizers I made for my party, these went the fastest! I added a sprinkle of green onion on the top for a little extra pizzaz.

Wow!  These are so good.  I lost the recipe I usually use and tried these instead...they were way easier.  There are a lot of steps, but as long as you have all of your ingredients prepped, it goes quickly.  We scooped out the centers and reused it for my son to eat mashed.  The whole family cleaned the plate!

I made these just like the recipe said and although it took some time, they were great!  Enjoyed by all at our Sunday football party.  Frying the shells really beats baking for crispness.

This recipe was great!  I teach work and family studies at the high school level and my cooking class made them.  Everyone enjoyed them and they were fairly easy to make.  The deep frying scared me but my students had no problems.  I will be making these for get togethers from now on!! ENJOY!

I thought about giving it a 4 because I didn't fry them and wish I would have, but they still turned out pretty good. I used light cheddar, sour cream, and real bacon so the flavor I love was there. Next time I will fry them, add salt and pepper, and will also use green onion.

Made these for a surprise for my husband. These were outstanding! My kids were fighting over the last ones, when I reminded them they were for day. They can't wait for me to make again, and so easy and cheap!! Never again will I pay the $7.95 for these at a restaurant.

I've made these several times now and I love this recipe so much.  They taste exactly the same as the kind I've bought in restaurants.  I've made them for friends who wouldn't believe I made them myself.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good recipe!  They really were like the potato skins you get at restaurants!!  I liked the fried skins & these weren't really that hard to make.

this was a big hit.  The crispier skins were the best, so not too thick on the potato shell, and fry it long enough to look brown.

WOW! I really don't like potatoes, but I had a lot of potatoes leftover from another recipe so I thought I would try this and serve it to my boyfriend and his friend to get rid of some of the potatoes we had...I actually ate this and thought it was really good!!  I can't wait to make this again with enough for me to eat too!!  I thought the recipe did stretch b/c I halved the recipe, but still ended up using 6 potatoes!!

Hands down 5 star recipe!!!  Do fry the skins, I think that's what makes these so good.  I don't like to eat the skins on my potatoes, and I absolutely loved these.  Top with a little ranch dressing for something extra tasty.

Yummers!  Another Superbowl hit!  In an attempt to make this a tad healthier, I made a few mods:  I nuked the taters until soft, skipped the deep-frying, sprinkled the inside of the "boats" with seasoned salt, topped generously with lowfat cheese, omitted the bacon (I'm a veg), and broiled until the cheese was brown.  Served with a generous topping of chopped green onions and ff sour cream.  Awesome; will definitely make again!  Great recipe, thanks!

I had to fry mine longer than 5 minutes to get them golden brown, but they were excellent and pretty easy to make! None left after the Superbowl:)

These are so good! I took the advice of another reviewer and instead of frying I baked in the oven at 450 degrees for 45 min or so then scooped out potatoes and put a pat of butter in each skin and put back in for 5 min. then added cheese and bacon...use real bacon..makes a big difference!these came out crispy and delicious!!

I loved this recipe, tasted just like the restaurants!  I served it with ranch dressing and sour cream, and I also used "real" bacon instead of bacon bits.  I didn't find them soggy at all when cold, they were still crunchy and yummy!  Everybody ate all of them :-)

These were absolutely delicious! At first, my husband thought that these were the store-bought kind until I told him that I actually made them. I didn't have any bacon bits, so I used colby-jack cheese, green onions and topped them with seasoned bread crumbs. YUM!
