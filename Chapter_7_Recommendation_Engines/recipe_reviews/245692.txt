Very good! I suggest keeping some of the drained liquid from the chickpeas in case you need to thin the hummus a bit (I did need to). I also added a bit more lemon juice and salt than called for after tasting it to get it where I wanted it, but that's just my preference. This was very easy to mix up and very tasty...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

It turned out great! I just could not taste the garlic.
