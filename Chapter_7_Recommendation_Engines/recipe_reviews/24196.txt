I scaled the recipe to 12 servings and increased the pumpkin puree and spices a little. I baked this in a 9-inch springform pan with a homemade crust. I used a water bath and added white chocolate curls to the top after it cooled a bit. It looked and tasted great! Everyone gave rave reviews and couldn't beieve it was homemade. For my crust: Combine 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup confectioners sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon in a bowl. Pour in 1/4 cup melted butter and mix well. Press into bottom of springform pan and bake for 10 minutes at 350 before adding filling to pan.

I simply can't rave enough about this recipe.  This was the first time I've ever made a cake/pie, and it turned out BEAUTIFUL and was absolutely delicious.  When it was cut, the layers came out so well that everyone thought I had spent forever baking, but it only took me about 10 minutes to make.  And did I mention that it was delicious?? Definitely try this recipe - everyone will love it.

Delicious. One change: While mixing the 1 c. cream cheese mix with the 1/2 c. pumpkin puree, I noticed that it looked a bit too "cream cheesey", so I added pumpkin puree until it looked & smelled more pumpkin-y (about another 3/4 cup). I then put in 1 1/2 cups of that new mixture in to the pie tin. It was a perfect mix of pumpkin flavor on top, cheesecake flavor on the bottom, but all with the consistency of cheesecake. And it serves beautifully as well!

I can't get enough! If you like cheesecake and you like pumpkin pie, you will love this one! It's a perfect mix of the two. Top with some Cool Whip and there is a perfect pie!

This recipe is great for a base, however I found that you needed 2x more spices than the recipe called for to have any flavour in your cheesecake.  Also, making a crust out of crushed gingersnap cookies is a great addition!!

This is a great recipe!  I made it for my first Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it so much that they begged me to make it for Christmas.  It is very easy to make and will win you lots of praise.  The only bad thing I could say about it is, that it disappears too quickly.

This is the best! Made it several times and it's been a hit each time. Comes out perfect - even using store bought graham crust! Do not change a thing - perfect as is!

I changed this to a "cheesecake bar."  I use an 8 x 11.5 rectangular glass pan that is lined with parchment paper.  I also reduce the fat by using 1/3 less fat cream cheese for both packages.  My family and I can't taste the difference at all.  Next time I make it I think I will add a bit more of the pumpkin puree (as was suggested in another review).  Delicious!!

We enjoyed this recipe. I didn't turn out quite as elegant/refined as I'd like for guests but it tasted yummy and was very simple to make. For the right occasion we'll make this one again. Even those who were skeptical of the concept ended up enjoying it.

This recipe is quick and easy! The only trouble I had was that my pumpkin layer sank into the cheesecake layer, so I took a fork, swirled the layers a bit (not too much) and turned it into a pumpkin cheesecake swirl! It was absolutely beautiful but I didn't have the look of two distinct layers when sliced. If you want this to work you might try baking the cheesecake layer 15 minutes before addding the pumpkin so it will set and support the pumpkin.

Delicious and so easy to make.  Turned out very nicely on the first try.  I used one block of "fat free" cream cheese and one block of "1/3 less fat" cream cheese to make it less rich, and the cheesecake still turned out wonderful.  Even with less fat and calories, there was still a rich taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe as is, i've seen the suggestions on adding more spices to make it have more flavor, but I don't recommend this, i tried it a few different ways as some suggested and it comes out with way to much flavor and taste horrible, if you have money to waste trying it other ways then by all means try changing it up, but it comes out great as is

Very good pumpkin cheesecake.  4 stars because I had to add a lot more spices than what the recipe called for.  I also used a lot more pumpkin to give it more of a pumpkin flavor, approx 3/4c and it probably could have used even more.  I topped off the cheesecake with a sourcream topping from a different recipe and pecans.

Only gave this 4 stars because I didn't feel pie was creamy enough.  It turned out very nice, was definitely tasty, (I used a full cup + of pumpkin and increased the spices from 1/8 to 1/4.  Cinnamon stayed at 1/2 tsp.  Next time I will try adding  1/2 cup of either yogurt or sour cream for a creamier filling.

This is a very tasty cheesecake/pie!  I followed the directions as given but the next time I make it I will use more of the cream cheese mixture for the second layer and add more pumpkin puree as we love the pumpkin flavor.  (I had a large can of pumpkin puree so I divided the remainder in the amount for this recipe and froze it for the next time.) And a dash more of the spices too!  Served it with a dollop of whipped cream!  Would look great with a pecan perched on top of the whipped cream or any other  edible decoration! I will make this recipe again with revisions!

Everyone loved this recipe!  I made it to go with our Thanksgiving dinner.  Hubby doesn't like graham cracker crust, so we used a shortbread crust.  It was still amazing.  Next year, I'll be making at least two - this pie disappeared so quickly!

I made this for my family and they loved it.  The recipe and video have different directions - the recipe says to reserve 1C of the cheese cake mixture to mix with the pumpkin, but the video says to spread 1C cheescake mixture on the crust.  I followed the recipe and only mixed 1C cheesecake with the pumpkin and the pumkin layer was really thin.  Next time I make it, I will follow the video instructions.

During the holidays this was the biggest hit.  I was even asked to make them for other family members and coworkers.  I made about 6 cheesecakes! After the first one, it wasn't sweet enough.  I added 2 tbsp of Splenda  to the cream cheese mixture, it was perfect! Enjoy.

This cheesecake is easy and tastes amazing.  I made it for Thanksgiving a year ago and my husband and friends have requested it at least once a month since then.  My husband even wanted it for his birthday cake this year!

Some said too much pumpkin flavor, some said too much cheesecake flavor.. so I guess it averages out.  My problem with this recipe was that it wasn't very.. well.. pretty.  It tasted ok though and was very simple.

Good recipe but I think the cloves made it a little too "spicy" and took away from the pumpkin and cheesecake flavors.  I would make it again using less cloves and I bet that would up the rating.

Excellent variation on the traditional pumpkin pie.  So easy.  I used ready made pumpkin pie mix.  Used a little more than the recipe called for though.  Will make this one again and again!

Wow husband loved and then gave me a look and ask what I wanted to change and I couldn't find anything....

Crust...I didn't have an graham cracker so I used a pie crust and it was still wonderful.  I plan to make this Thanksgiving.  I am going to try Gingersnaps before then as others suggested.

I loved everything about this cheesecake.  I may make one change when I make it again and that would be to make the basic cheesecake layer a tad bit more than the pumpkin layer.  Hey - I love plain cheesecake!  Yummy recipe!

I made this for one of our Thanksgiving deserts and it was a huge hit!  I put the crust in the freezer for 1/2 hour before starting. After the first layer was poured I popped it back in the freezer while I prepared the second layer. It came out perfectly! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

VERY good! Everyone in my family loved it. I made my own graham cracker crust and added a little ground ginger to it. Also used someone's suggestion of mixing about a cup of Libby's pumpkin pie mix (vs. regular pumpkin) with the cream cheese mixture and then used 1.5 cups of that for the pumpkin layer. Had only 2 small, shallow cracks when done.  :)

Oh ya baby! This is ultimately delicious! I think even a 1/2 cup more of the pumkin mixture could be added, but zero complaints in taste and it was gobbled up.

Loved it. Although I couldn't find pumpkin puree so i used packed can pumpkin but next time I make it I will use 1/4 cup more pumpkin for a bit more thickness and pumpkin taste. Otherwise, it satisfied my cheesecake and pumpkin pie craving all at once!

This recipe was so quick and easy that I made it twice during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend!  My husband even liked it, and he doesn't normally care for pumpkin pie.  I'm sure I will make this again.

This is fantastic! Can't really taste the pumpkin, but it is delicious and looks very pretty too. I used 1 package neufchatel, next time I'll push it and use it for both packages to cut down a little more on the fat so I can justify eating more!!

I found this to be a little too "cheesecakey".  I prefer more of a pumpkin taste.  I must have done something wrong during the layering step because the pumpkin "layer" sunk          into the middle of the cake and when I served it, you only tasted pumpkin in the first bite or two.  The taste was good but not like I was expecting.  It's worth another try...

I took this to a potluck dinner at church and got several compliments.  I made my own graham cracker crust half honey half cinnamon and increased the ingredients to fit a 9 x 13 pan...doubled cream cheese and sugar and used one can of pumpkin.  I also made the pumpkin mixture to taste...pumpkin pie spice, allspice, cinnamon, and extra sugar.  I also added a layer of French vanilla cool whip after it cooled.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this for Christmas Brunch with the folks. The only variation I employed was substituting the individual spices for mixed Pumpkin Spice Blend by McCormick (reason = laziness). It came out BEAUTIFULLY and everyone asked for the recipe. This one is going into the favorites section of my recipe file.

Very easy.  Quick.  Very mild pumpkin flavor - great alternative to the pumpkin pie!  I made this with a muffin tin - put a crushed graham cracker / butter mixture at the bottom of the paper liner (or a vanilla wafer)and then layer the ingredients.  Bake about 30 minutes...nice "two bite" size desserts.

This was wonderful. I made it for Thanksgiving and just got a call from my sister requesting it for Christmas. It was gone before I could get a piece and I had to share with one of my kids!

I have had to make this pie three times in the past month. I have tried other pumpkin cheesecake and this has become my favorite! I do add extra pumpkin pie mix.

This was fabulous. I did make some changes... I used 3 packages of cream cheese and doubled all of the spices. It was great and I went home with an empty dish!

I made this for Thanksgiving dessert, and barely made it to the plate in time to get a piece. Everyone said it was great, and I thought so too. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie, and this is the perfect combo of pumpkin pie and cheesecake to be festive for the holiday. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect, about half cheesecake and half pumpkin. It was also beautiful once it was cut.

I made this cheesecake for my family for Thanksgiving. I thought it tasted wonderful. My family prefers the no-bake version of cheesecake but found this to be enjoyable as well. Very easy to make and I will be making it again.

Very Good!  Had Thanksgiving with friends with extremely discerning tastes--got rave reviews all around!  Guests kept talking about how good it was.  Will make again.  Next time I think I'll make my own graham cracker crust and make in a spring form pan.

This was excellent and easy to make. I was alarmed how puffy it was when it came out of the oven but it settled down into a picture-perfect cheesecake. My only suggestion is to increase the amount of pumpkin; I thought the pumpkin flavor got a little lost in all the cream cheese. I will definitely make again, with more pumpkin, maybe in a deep dish. Delicious, thank you!

Fine for what it was. Not sure the pumpkin/cheesecake combo is the best for us. You need to plan some kind of garnish for the top--plain looking.

Very nice presentation. I ended up with a very pretty, three colored layers pie as I used a chocolate graham pie crust instead of the regular. My daughter requested it :) as she loves chocolate. The cheesecake was a little to rich for me, but everyone liked it. If you like very rich cheesecake and pumpkin pie, then this is definitly a cheesecake heaven and a keeper for cheesecake/pumpkin pie lovers
***Edited to say I am making more of these to give away as presents on thanksgiving day to my neighbors. I disagree with the reviewer who stated this is plain looking. How about some whip cream on top for god' sake!! Looks don't make a recipe. What is more plain looking than a plain pumpkin pie??? Nothing. This one is pretty and have layers of colors!!!!

This is a great recipe. I have never attempted to make a cheesecake or use pumpkin in a recipe before. I even used a pumpkin from my own garden. I cut it up, baked it int the oven. Then I skinned it and put the pumpkin in a food processor. everyone enjoyed the cheesecake and I'm going to make another one tomorrow. A must try recipe.

This is an amazing cake/pie. I made it for my son's 40 surprise birthday party and it was a hit, everyone that got a piece loved it. It seems I didn't make enough made (2). But I did change it the next time. I put the cream cheese mixture on the bottom then I put the pumpkin mix on top and took a toothpick any swirled it into the cream cheese mix and it looked so beautiful with the two mixed together.. Neither one is over bearing the other.

Easy to make. I used the entire 15 oz can of pumpkin for the topping. I esp like this recipe because it has few ingredients and satisfies the sweet tooth without being heavy or loading up on sugar.

this was the best sugarfree cheesecake that I have made!  I made an almond flour crust and substituted Splenda and Stevia  for sugar,  I also increased the recipe by using 3 pks cream cheese, 3 eggs and the entire can of pumpkin purée and cooked it in a 9" springform pan.  I did not increase the amount of seasoning and it was absolutely delicious. I will be making this every Thanksgiving from now on.
