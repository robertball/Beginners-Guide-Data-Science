After reading the other two reviews I made a couple of changes. I added a little more flour than the recipe called for threw in some semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked the cookies for 10 minutes. They were a wonderful soft on the inside crispy on the outside consistency. Will definitely make again.

Instead of 1 1/4c margarine I used 2/3 cup margarine and 2/3 cup unsweetended applesauce also I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup added 1/4 cup wholewheat flour and added 3 tbsp cocoa and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. The kids liked these. Thanks for the recipe.

Cookies are delicious. I found them to fall apart very easily however the taste outweighed the fact that they did not stay together. We added raisins for a nice touch.

I substituted as follows: 3/4 c. mashed bananas 1/2 c. crisco for the margarine 1 1/2 c. Splenda 1 tbsp. molasses for brown and white sugar 4 egg whites instead of just 2 (to add more liquids because the Splenda has a tendency to absorb some of the moistness in baking mixes) I also didn't include any raisins or chocolate like some reviewers did. These subs need to be mixed differently because of the consistencies; which i did as follows: I beat the bananas and crisco until well blended; then I added the molasses and vanilla again beating until well blended; then I beat the egg whites in until well blended; then I added the Splenda 1/2 c. at a time beating well after each addition. Then mixed dry ingredients per the recipe. You also need to smash them down with fork on cookie sheet. The end result: delicious!

I just made a dozen of these cookies and they turned out great! Even though they have less then 100 calories each they don't taste "light" at all. Delicious!

Combing suggestions from a couple of reviews I was able to still retain the "light" aspect of the recipe and create a wonderfully moist and flavourbable treat! This will be a regular recipe in my house. What did I do? Substituded the 1 1/4 cups reduced fat margarine with 2/3 cup reduced fat margaine and 2/3 cup sugar free apple sauce. I also substitued the 1/2 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar for 1 2/2 cups Splenda and 1 Tbsp honey. I doubled the egg whites because of the Splenda and used 1/2 Tbsp of vanilla. YUMMY!!

These were good but not the best. I doubled the flour and the dough was still tough to manage (they did not fall apart or spread too thin on the baking sheet however). The taste was not overly sweet which is what my husband prefers. I'm on a diet so I guess we both win with this recipe! I found 12 minutes in the oven worked for me.

Read some of the reviews and made additional modification Used 1 cup 2 Tbsp butter 1/2 cup regular applesauce used 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 white sugar (since applesauce was sweetened 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup white flour added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice and one bag butterscotch morsels. YUM YUM!!!! and if your on weight watchers each cookie calculates to 2 points each. They were crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. My perfect oatmeal cookie and my daughters and hubby loved them!

These completely fell apart. I added flour and still no good. That is what I get for not reading the reviews first.

Alright First off there is no doubt these are great tasting! However I agree with other reviews they fall apart. Actually... They don't keep any form what so ever. My husband and I agree that it is a rich and delicious flavor. Which would make a better topping for ice cream possibly formed into balls after baking and dipped in chocolate. I added 1/2 cup of raw sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup craisins.:)

These cookies did not turn out at all. It was the best tasting dough ever but ended up melting into one giant pan sized cookie. They were very thin and burnt on the bottom after only 6 minutes in the oven:(

These were easy and delish..I used about 3 heaping tablespoons of earth balance butter and about 1/4 cup peanut butter. I also used only 2 cups oats which made them hold up well compared to the other reviews. I also folded in 1/4 cup chocolate chips. Will make again!

I did not change the recipe at all when I baked these cookies they turned out flat as pancakes I did not like them at all but my boyfriend did (but he ll eat almost anything) The only reason I gave this recipe 2 stars is because despite being flat like crackers they did actually stay pretty moist in the center of the cookies. I was not a huge fan.

I followed this recipe exactly as called for but the cookies spread out so thin that when I tried to take them off of the cookie sheet they turned to crumbs. Taste was delicious if you want a recipie for granola but not for a cookie.

I substituted the white sugar for splenda and added a little bit of cinnamon. They taste great!! Love this recipe! How could I make them a bit thicker so they won't crumble?

Strangely wonderful flat oatmeal cookies! Modify: I did a half recipe used real butter softened but not melted and cut into small pieces add little more flour- I added 1/8 cup for a half recipe added quarter cup choco chips quarter cup chopped walnuts. WHAT WORKED FOR ME; cook a bit longer like 8 mins then turn off oven and let them continue cooking 4-5. Take them out and give them a couple of minutes still on the pan. Use a firm spatula give a nudge at edges it will be slightly soft but as long as they don't fall apart you're good. Don't put them on a rack put them on a cold plate. Don't stack 'em. After they cool a bit put on rack. Now I can't say for sure all this is necessary but it makes awesome cookies this way. They are airy almost lacy delicious oatmeal. Oh and I added a few shakes of cinnamon to batter. Kind of a pain in the as but it went so quickly that it's worth it. I've made twice love them!

Tasted great but some did fall apart. I did make a few changes. I used real butter added a 1/2 cup whole wheat flour a dash of cinnamon raisins and a 1/2 cup more oats than the recipe called for. The butter no doubt increased the calorie count but I absolutely loved the flavour. Will be making again.

I followed the recipe as is and for the most part they were ok they fell apart which made them hard to eat. They tasted a little too buttery to me but not to sweet. so all in all they were just ok. probaby wont make them again.
