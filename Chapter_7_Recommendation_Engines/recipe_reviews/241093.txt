Delish :) I used only half the amount of quinoa (just a preference; I like my salads with a higher veg-to-quinoa ratio) and cooked it the way I normally do, with less water/broth. Also used homemade strained kefir instead of yogurt.I think I would add more avocado next time. And I was so eager to try this that I forgot to garnish, hehe. But this is definitely great as written!

Yum! This is so good. I made the recipe as written and it is great. The dressing is fantastic. I'll be using the dressing recipe for other salads as well. Thanks for a great recipe!
