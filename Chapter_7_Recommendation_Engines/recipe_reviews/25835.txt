Really great cookies, especially for a real chocolate lover.  My son heard of Cowboy cookies on a kids TV show and wanted to make them.  I had no idea what they were, but this recipe will be a family favorite now.  It makes a lot of cookies too.

Yummy, very nice recipe. Nice and chocolaty, love the peanut butter flavor.  Left out the coconut this time, may try adding it next time. Will definitely be adding this to the Christmas cookie list

Excellent! Moist, chewy and gooey.
I omitted the coconut & nuts.
They were as chocolaty as brownies but tasted as good as old fashioned chocolate chip cookies.
Took a little longer to cook, but it was most likely my oven.  My kids really like these.

These are Great!  I've only used regular chocolate chips since that's all I've had.  But I think they would be even better with mini chips. I usually add more flour and lengthen the cooking time as a personal preference.

YUM!  A really tasty combination of textures and flavors.  I had thought the 2 cups of sugar would be too sweet, but since I used an PB with no sugar in it, the cookies were just right!  I did add a 1/2 tsp. of salt, since I only have unsalted butter.   I left out the cream of tartar.

These cookies taste good, but the recipe will not replace my classic recipes. I followed the recipe exactly and I think it needs a pinch of salt. I also think there are too many flavors going on, but none of them are prevalent enough. Will not make again.

I made these today for my husband, and he just came in and tried one (actually 10!) Needless to say he loved them. They are very rich but delicious. I omitted the coconut and walnuts and used crunchy peanut butter. Excellent cookie recipe

These. Are. Incredible.  I substituted pecans for walnuts and Hershey's extra dark cocoa for regular because these were what I had on hand. The cookies did not "melt" into a flat shape; they pretty much held their shape, flattening just slightly when baking.  They are delicately crisp, yet the coconut adds a delightful chewiness and the chocolate is melty and gooey and wonderful. I can detect just a hint of the peanut butter, but it's a nice balance of flavors. I will definitely be making this one again. And again.

Good idea, but too sweet and not salty enough.  Next time I'll try to use 1 1/4 C sugar instead, as well as 1/2 tsp. salt.  I like my cookies less sweet and more flavorful though.

Wouldnt make again, too much going on.  Just ended up tasting like a sweet mess. My husband ,the cookie lover, said not to make again.  Perhaps better without the cocoa?

I didn't find these any more chocolately than a normal choc-chip cookie. That being said, they were very nice but next time I will use more peanut butter.

These are addictive!  After reading some of the reviews I did make a few slight changes.  I left out the coconut and nuts and used one cup of chocolate chips and one cup of peanut butter chips.  I also used a cup of real salted butter and half a cup of butter flavored shortening instead of the half butter/half shortening.  I sent my guy to his job the next morning with 4 dozen cookies and he came home with an empty container.  The recipe makes a lot of cookies!

This cookie turned out great.  I did change a few things.  I didn't use cream of tarter (ran out of it) or walnuts.  I did use crunchy peanut butter and the peanuts were a nice touch. I am a big fan of coconut and I added 1 1/2 cups of flaked coconut.

Oh my! This is one of the best cookies I have tried and I am not fond of semi sweet chocolate so I used both. I used all the ingredients . The walnuts,oats and coconut. Everybody raved over them. Thanks for the recipe.

A fantastic cookie!  
Cut white sugar down by 1/3 and chocolate chips by 1/2, and it's plenty sweet.
Subbed shortening for butter.
Didn't use nuts, but what a GREAT cookie!

These were nice and chocolatly with a good coconut flavor. Very moist and chewy! I omitted the peanut butter and the nuts because I didn't have any on hand. I halved the recipe and actually got exactly 18 cookies out of it, I needed to extend the baking time to 14 minutes though this may be due to missing peanutbutter, or just my oven! 
A nice change from the norm!

Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.  It needs more peanut butter flavoring, but that is personal preference.  I must admit, though, none of this batch of cookies went to waste; they more accurately went to "waist" because I served them at a church coffee hour and everyone ate them all.:)  I might try adding peanut butter chips if I make these again, to boost the pb flavor.

These are pretty good.  I used butter instead of margarine, regular chips instead of mini-morsels and had to increase the baking time to about 12-13 minutes.  I rolled them in balls to make them more attractive.  Interesting combination of ingredients but I made them exact except for the nuts.  I think next time I'll omit the peanut butter so that you can taste the coconut.  The recipe makes a lot of cookies!

I didn't use the coconut or the walnuts. And these were pretty good, but not fantastic. And the recipe makes a TON of them. But, take this with a grain of salt, because I'm not that good of a baker. So I might have just fudged things up.
Also, I used a really healthy peanut butter, and it made the cookies a bit salty. I would recommend just regular ol' Jif.

A good cookie, we especially liked the peanut butter in them. If I make them again I would leave out the cocoa. My family likes a more traditional cowboy cookie.

I made these today and followed the recipe as printed. Delicious cookies and makes over 4 dozen depending on the size you like. I baked about 12 minutes. Will make them many times more.
