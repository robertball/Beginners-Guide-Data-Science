I read all the reviews and tried to address people's issues and got a 5-star cookie out of it. I used precut Date Nuggets and countered their dryness by using a few more tablespoons of rum. The apricots weren't bad to cut up. Then in the AM I put half the mixture at a time in a food processor and pulsed it a few times so the fruit was more evenly sized and ultimately easier to slice cleanly into rounds.  I also baked them a bit longer. The end result was a huge hit...not sweet and a good addition to a cookie plate

I am not big on fruitcake, but these cookies were VERY good.  When I sent cookies home w/ guests they always asked if I would put alot of the fruitcake ones in.  They really were quite easy to make & it does make ALOT of them.  Now I will make these every year!  Thanks, Traci Z.

These cookies have a very flavour. The problem was that no matter what knife I used they would not cut nicely.  They kept braking apart.I tried chilling them more and less and it didn't make a difference.  Next time I would not bother to roll them but form into cookies.  I also used dates instead of figs and added a few chopped apricots.

Because we can't eat figs, I replaced them with a fruitcake mix.  The cookies were delicous..but they didn't last long, so had to make them more often.

While this cookie is extremely tasty, it takes a whole lot of effort and time. It's difficult to chop some of the fruits because they're so sticky. Still, if you want to impress somebody with a good holiday cookie, and you have time, this is a good recipe.

I must have done something wrong because the dough was very crumbly and the cookies were not sweet enough.  I used apricots, dates, and rum instead of figs, cheeries, and sherry.

These are better once they sit.  Dough is somewhat crumbly - mostly you'll need a very sharp knife to cut through figs/nuts etc. and get nice rounds.  If you don't have one, perhaps chill in fridge for a while and then just dollop onto sheets with a spoon.  Also, to state the obvious, if you don't like figs, don't make this.  But you may like them even if you don't like FRUITCAKE.  Good, but not good enough to stay on our Christmas cookie list.

My apologies to the author of this recipe but I found it to be very bland - lacking any definitive taste. I will not bother trying this recipe again.

These had a very nice fruit cake taste. They flattened out more than I would have liked, but perhaps I cut it too thin. Because they turned out thin, they had a nice crispiness. Flavor excellent. I would definitely try again.
