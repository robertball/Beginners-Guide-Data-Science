My husband and I thought was great! It's even good warmed up. I thought the Thousand Island and the Velveeta topping would be odd, but it's great! We will definatly have this again.

I made this for my husband and I, we like left over's and this made plenty. We both agree this is the best sandwich we have ever tasted. I loved it and it was easy. Thanks!

Excellent! I made one change and that is that I had my butcher slice the beef knowing that I'd never get it as thin as I wanted. So, with a ton of small pieces I knew I would also have to change the cooking method. I grilled it in a grill basket instead of broiling. Everything else stayed the same (oh except for the bun in which I used a hoagie because I had them on hand). These were outstanding down to the stuffed jalapeno green olives. Me and the husband both really enjoyed these. The onion/shroom combo went perfect with the marinated beef and cheese. I had the leftover (minus the bun) for lunch today and the beef was still tender. I could be wrong but I think me having the beef sliced prior to dropping it in to marinate helped it absorb the flavor and also made it more tender. This was so much better than a Philly Steak N Cheese in my opinion!

This was very tasty!  Even my picky 9 yo daughter said it was the best sandwich she ever ate.  I did not include the jalapeno stuffed olives, because i could not find them in the store.  I also used regular rotel tomatoes instead of salsa to make my traditional queso for the dip.

These are so good! Loved the flavors. 
I did change a few things. It was a busy day so I threw the roast into the crackpot and let it cook that way. Also was out of Italian dressing so I made some using Italian dressing Mix (on allrecipes). Shredded the beef up and topped the bread with it then threw it under the broiler for a minute. Also added some provolone cause you can't have to much cheese right?
I left out the jalape√±o stuffed olives because I'm a big wimp when it comes to spicy. Will definitely make these sandwiches again!

I bet would have been better if I would have picked up the right roast.  Once I found out it was too tough I gave up on the roast and made hamburgers using the dressing and using the cheese sauce for dipping and the bread as buns.  Now that was good!
