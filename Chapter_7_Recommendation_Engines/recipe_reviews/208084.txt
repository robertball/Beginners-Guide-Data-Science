This is a true pudding cake that was popular in the 1980's and 1990's.  Its not meant to be turned out onto a platter but it is meant to be sponed out into a dish and topped with ice cream or whipped cream.  Its delicious.

I'm giving this a four as the taste was good, but man, it was a runny mess. Do not, I repeat, do not invert cake to a platter to serve. I had a placemat underneath thankfully, but the pudding-ness ran all over it. I would make again (great chocolate fix), but I would just dish it out from the pan itself and serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. I kept putting the cake back in the oven thinking it just needed more time to bake, but that wasn't the case. I would rate this five stars if not for the consistency- but it isn't called "Chocolate Fudge PUDDING (Cake)" for nothing. Expect more pudding than cake, and you will be very pleased. :)

Hey guys, This is meant to be eaten cobbler style..served hot in a bowl with ice cream on top.  If it isn't a little runny you will lose the hot fudge syrup kick.  Try it again with that in mind :0)

We called this "Magic Chocolate Cake" because the ingredients reverse in the oven. The dry bottom and wet top make a fabulous pudding on the bottom and a brownie-like cake on top. It's a family favorite and absolutely wonderful - alone, but especially with vanilla ice cream!

This is a nice pudding cake and better eaten hot with ice cream.   For reviewers that complained about it being runny that is the way it is supposed to be: cake on top and a sauce on the bottom. Do not try to put on a plate - just spoon it out of the dish.

I wish I could give this recipe a fabulous review, but I can't.  Sounds delicious, but it came out very runny. Not really pudding,really, just used it as a chocolate sauce over the cake part. Not a super recipe, but the kids enjoyed it.

I like this recipe because it’s easy and you get your cake and hot chocolate sauce all in one easy step.  Serve warm with vanilla ice cream for a nice treat.

I only give this recipe 4 stars because it is missing a very key ingredient.  Dot the top of the batter with 1/3 cup of butter that you cubed.  Add it after the sugar/cocoa mix but before you pour on the water.

This thickens the sauce a little bit (not much but definitely less watery) and it really amps up the flavour making this much richer.

This is  the best choc lovers dream but cut the salt to a pinch and increase the hot water to 1 3\4 c. and increase the cocoa to 5 tbsp. Do not invert this dessert

This is a classic British dessert that I have been making for 20 yrs.  I think this one adds a little too much salt.  A pinch will do.  The walnuts are optional.  You would never, ever turn this cake out to serve.  Big mess.  Don't try.  A really easy cake to make though and always popular.

I love this recipe.I listened to a couple comments and doubled it. If served as it should be like a cobbler it has a nice creamy topping. I shared with the neighbors and it is a hit.

This is one of our favourite recipes!!  When you take it out of the oven, cut it up and put into individual serving dishes so you can spoon the pudding over the top.  Refrigerate and serve with ice cream...very yummy!!!!

I also added more cocoa to this- about 5 tbs more.  Very rich, but if you're trying to hit that sweet spot, this is the dessert for it!

This was amazing! So easy, and I had all of the ingredients in my pantry. It's supposed to be runny. Kind of like the lava cakes you order in restaraunts. Thanks for a perfect recipe!

This is a favorite recipe from my childhood. It's best served warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream. It is just amazing! It's supposed to be runny - the chocolate sauce is built in!! Pour it on top of the cake and ice cream. The sauce will thicken a little after it cools. I love it!

I made these as an afterthought with dinner tonight...instead of baking in a one quart dish, however, I divided the batter between four well greased Pyrex 10ounce dishes...they got RAVE reviews.  These tasted better than the chocolate lava cake we ordered at a local restaurant just last weekend!  I will be making these again!!!   NOTE:  Do not invert these...either spoon out of the one quart dish or bake in four separate ramekins and dig in to find the fudge-y bits!  Perfect served with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream!

This recipe is for "chocolate cake and syrup"; not pudding.  It is like others have said, "runny" "delicious" "chocolate fix".  Make it in a 9 inch square pan; serve right from the pan, scoop out cake, a scoop if ice cream, then top with the syrup.  It is wonderful.

I actually made this in a 1 quart dish.  Horrible mistake.  Most of the sauce ended on the bottom of my stove.  I recommend using a 2 quart dish so that when the sauce boils it has room to expand.  When we ate it (most of the sauce gone and very thin), it wasn't sweet at all.  The very rich flavor would be excellent with ice cream.

I love this recipe.  :)  I did add a small amount of cubed butter to the top of the batter before baking to add richness (1/8th cup), haven't tried it without.  Very simple, no eggs- ingredients are almost always on hand.  I almost ate all of it myself!  Do not invert, keep in baking pan- so cook it in something pretty to serve.  Keeps well in fridge in between sneaky spoonfuls.  Family loved it!  I am making it again for a school teacher appreciation party.

This was delicious! I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfect! (With the exception of inverting it on a platter, just spoon it out of the pan you cooked it in!) It's very similar to chocolate lava cake. I will definitely be making this again!

DO NOT INVERT THIS CAKE FOR SERVING !!
   This was my mother's recipe, and allrecipies.com was kind enough to rush it through so we could make & serve it at the nursing home where I worked at the time.  I have been trying to find a way to make that change in the recipe, and couldn't edit it. I appreciate everyone that has tried & loved it, as we 6 kids did when we were young, and have made it for our families too. 
  It was quick & easy for mom to whip up on a cold  winter night and never lasted past a 2nd day. Loving all the reviews, and the added ways to make it. I plan on trying to add those changes to my recipe too. Thanks again, Ginga. :-)

Good flavor  but not enough of the sauce according to my husband who was comparing it to the same dessert made by his mom.  She made it without a recipe so I cannot compare.

I made this dessert with half Hershey's cocoa Special Dark and half Hershey's Cocoa.  My husband said this is the best dessert he has ever had.  And I bake a lot.   This is a keeper.

Overall it was okay, but do NOT put a whole teaspoon of salt in. It was very salty.

This was great. Some of the reviews said it only needed a pinch of salt but next time I'm going to add the full amount because I felt like it could use a little more flavor. I added chocolate chips in the batter and then sprinkled some on top after I poured the water.
