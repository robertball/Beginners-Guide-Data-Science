Oh WOW..........this was WONDERFUL.  I have some friends in Oz and went down to visit them a couple of years ago. This burger was all I heard about from them before I went to visit.   This was hands down my favorite food from there.  I make it here in the US as well, it's just a challange to get folks here to open their minds and eat a burger with beets on it!!  I plan on adding it to my menu at the restaurant I just bought!  YUMMY

This is such a big hit here in Australia (I live in Melbourne, Victoria) that it is a regular part of the menu at all of our Hungry Jacks and McDonalds restaurants.  You definitely need to add salt and pepper to the patties, even though it is not in the recipe.

These were WONDERFUL! The only thing that we might do differently, probably a personal preference, is season the meat before grilling with some salt/pepper/grill seasoning.  All of the toppings are WONDERFUL and each adds their own level of enjoyment to this burger!  We WILL be making this again!

The only way we ever have burgers is with beetroot!  However whilst this recipe has all the right fillings for a burger the actual meat patties are flavourless. I added salt & pepper, onion, garlic, dijon mustard, worchestershire sauce & breadcrumbs (to soak up any excess juices or fat whilst cooking). I left out the onion as a filling for the burger because I already added it to the meat. Suggest you play around with the meat flavourings to get something that appeals to your taste.

My husband's comment was, "This has got to be the absolute WORST meal to eat on a first date!  You can't talk while eating it, you don't want to look at anyone else while they're eating it, and you don't want anyone else to look at you!" :o)  As other's have aptly noted, the sheer height of this burger is overwhelming--as is its juiciness.  However, it has a cacophony of flavors that somehow come together to taste great.  I wonder if you could combine many of the ingredients into a bit of an "Aussie Salsa" (pineapple, tomato, relish, beets, etc.)so the overall height was diminished.  I think I'll try that next time.

When I first read the list of ingredients, I thought, "Gross!" (pineapple and eggs together!?!) but so many people raved about these burgers in the reviews that I decided to give them a chance.  Well, first of all, they are completely impractical.  They were literally 5 inches high--Even Mick Jagger couldn't get his mouth around that. When we pushed down the top, things would squeeze out and shoot across the table. As for the taste, it wasn't bad, but if I did it again, I'd leave off the beets, egg and pineapple which leaves you with your basic bacon cheeseburger. My husband liked them better than I did. I won't make them again unless he requests them.

Really - DON"T skip the beets!  They are incredible on a hamburger.  My (aussie) husband talked me into trying and Aussie Works... I can't eat a burger without a beet slice now!
Great recipe - it's ok to leave off the eggs and bacon.  The pineapple and the beet are the reat taste treat!

Just finished eating the "works" burger...all of the interesting toppings are what makes this burger!  I loved the egg and bacon and pineapple.  Next time though, i will make the pattie the way i usually do with spices and stuff it was a little bland.  Overall, really good!

These burgers are a great twist the old stand-by (burgers and fries). I left off the beets, the burger was still the best I ever had and my family agrees!!!

Oh my Goodness!  These burgers are the best.  When I first saw the recipe, I thought how gross is this.  Did not change a single thing and would not in the future.  Definitely a heart clogger, but well worth it.

This burger originated as breakfast food for surfers. These sturdy Aussies are up at dawn. After a few hours surfing they emerge starving and cold. That's why the burger has egg and bacon. Pineapple is grown in northern Australia and is very popular in many recipes. In Australia beets are used on sandwiches as well as burgers. Don't skip any of the ingredients!

My husband is from Australia and made these wonderful burgers for dinner last week.  OMG, they are absolutely delicious!!!  The fried egg on the burger is wonderful.....all burgers should have a fried egg!  Talk about a messy burger - - you won't be able to put it down, but you won't want to because of the yummy taste!  Give it a try, mate!

This is delish. I have it at our favorite resturant. Outside of the beets and pineapple, it's the same. They call theirs A DAGWOOD BURGER, and  it really is. Served with a BIG plate of fries, you can't eat it all. You really ought to try this.

okay, not really an Aussie burger.. it has been very americanised!!  The burger pattie needs to have herbs and spices in it, also aussie burgers do not have mayo or pickles/relish.  We use real cucumbers and don't forget the grated carrot, and we don't call our ketchup ketchup but tomato sauce which you can get from World Foods.. try this recipe instead!!

This is definately an Aussie burger. I have not made this recipe but I have made them almost exactly the same so really there would be no point, except for eating them of course. ( : The only change I would suggest is to add a bit of flavour to the patty, it should  be the star of the show after all. Usually I mix it with some spices and breadcrumbs. There are thousands of recipes out there for patties just find one that suits you. Try this burger and enjoy, it's a real treat.

The egg and pineapple may seem weird, but they're fantastic on a burger. Every time I make a burger now, I like a pineapple slice on it. It makes the burger even juicier!

These were wonderful.  I found I didn't need a fancy pattie, since there was plenty of other fillings in the burger.  Beware though, these are very big and messy burgers, so make sure you have napkins nearby, as well as some hungry people.

Tried this recipe the other day.  I have to say, that you have to have a BIG!!! mouth to eat this burger.  It wasn't the best burger, but it wasn't bad either.  I like to try different things, and believe me, this was different.  Thanks.

This was okay.  Not something I would prb make again - way too messy, hard to bite into -- too big, great combos however - just too much.

This was awesome, but very messy to eat. Definitely will make this again! Thanks!

I've been Down Under a few times - good recipe. You can skip the pineapple and it will still be legit, from my experience (and taste).

I'm an Aussie girl (Ozzie is how it's pronounced).  The only thing this needed was herbs or something in the meat pattie.  Due to an egg allergy I didn't have one, but you can bet the rest of the family did.  Thanks for posting!

This is just a standard 'Burger with the lot' in Australia. Almost every corner fish n chip shop makes them.

Really good combo of flavors, but it would take being able to bite the whole thing to get 5 stars...just too big to get everything in one bite.
