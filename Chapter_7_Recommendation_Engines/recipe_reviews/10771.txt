These are excellent!  I made half the recipe and mine were a little flat.  It is hard to use half an egg.  I also added a little bit of vanilla.

These cookies ROCK!  I am not always the biggest fan of spice-type cookies or raisins but these came out great and were very flavorful.  I had to put some in the freezer so that we would not eat them all right away.

I'm not sure what happened to the other posters batch of cookies for them to not come out good, but let me tell you - I have made this recipe probably 15 times, didn't change a thing, and every time my cookies came out fantastic...they are always soft and chewy and have just the right amount of flavor,  and are nice and sweet. I always make these around Christmas time and usually have to triple the recipe because they go so fast! If you're looking for a new holiday cookie recipe - THIS IS IT!

My husband's comment was "Not the worst cookie I've ever had, but close. And they are so dry - are they diet cookies?" I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the spices and the cookies went together and baked just fine, looked good with nice texture.  But no flavor, even with double the spices. Afterwards I wondered if the fact that there was no salt and no vanilla might have added to the nothingness of them.
