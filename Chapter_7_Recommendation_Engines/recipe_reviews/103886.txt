Easy and tasty meal however for better taste do not use tomato soup from a can but make a tomato sauce with garlic on a more liquid side then finish the sausages in it.

This was a very easy and tasty dish. I modified it somewhat using Mushroom soup and added minced garlic to the mix. I also used Italian Sausage. A bit salty tasting but none the less quite good.

Overall this is a clever and tasty recipe. There are so many ways to customize it. I used sweet onion herb chicken sausage and added some navy beans. The beans took it into a more Italian style direction and toned down the sweetness of the soup (because typically I don't like the flavor of canned tomato soup). However next time I will try it without the beans because the sauce did taste great even before I put the beans in.

Nana's ROCK! I had no idea what to make for dinner this evening and wanted something fast and simple and this was it. For as few ingredients as there are in this recipe it was quite tasty.

Definately an easy meal. My family said it was very tasty. I thought it was delicious. It combines foods that I never thought of putting tegeter. I used mild Italian sausage and added some homemade red sauce left over from another dish.

I'll agree this is a fast and simple dish and I think of it more as a comfort food more for a family dish than a company dish. I like it with green beans or peas.

I made it but with a couple of changes after sauteing red onions added white wine concentrated chicken broth thyme a little rosemary and served over boiled potatoes. Came out very good.

Ultimate comfort food! I used v-8 instead of soup. Even my picky eaters even gobbled it up.
