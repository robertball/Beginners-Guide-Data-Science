The method sounded interesting so I had to give these a try.  Wonderful wings, made no changes!  The only thing I'd do different next time is to spray the baking pan so they don't stick.

This was a great recipe. Not only does it taste great, but I didn't have to fry the wings. In fact, steaming them first did two things. It cut down on the cooking time and some of the fat from the skin melted off into the water. I will definitely make these again.

This is the best buffalo chicken recipe I've ever had. I added a bit of ranch to the buffalo mix, then baked the chicken in the buffalo mix. After 20 minutes I flipped the chicken then re coated it in the mix. It was seriously delicious, I wish I had more, they were perfect.

Wanted to make a healthier version of my favorite Super Bowl snack. These wings are AMAZING!! Tender and delicious. Loved not having to clean up the greasy mess when deep frying. This is now the only cooking method I will use. Steaming the wings made the difference.

Good recipe, but directions should have stated to treat the baking pan with non-stick coating prior to placing the wings on it.  That would have eliminated pulling the skin off the wings when you turn them.

Great wing!  I par boiled the wings for 7 minutes b/c my steamer basket was too small to handle all the wings I was preparing.  I followed the sauce recipe and it was a hit! Spicy but not over powering!  Will be my go to wing recipe!

I usually just do butter and hot sauce but liked the additions of sugar and seasoning. The only addition I made was to add a teaspoon of chili paste which probably gave it a bit more of a bite. I used the sauce on chicken legs and everyone liked it. I'll be making it this way again.

Came out good but I screwed up in the directions. I sprinkled the wings with the dry mix & baked them until done first, then mixed the wings in the butter/hot sauce mixture. Came out good, but will redo and will follow recipe as indicated. The steaming process is a good idea

These were a hit and lasted about one quarter of Superbowl 2016.  I am sure butter would have been better, but a family member is dairy free, so I adjusted and am sharing here for those who might be in the same boat.  Made a (7-8 lbs.) COSTCO package of wings with 1 c. olive oil, 1 c. canola oil, 2 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. pepper, 2 tsp. onion flakes, 1 tsp. garlic salt (hubby allergic to raw garlic), zero cayenne, 1 c. brown sugar and 2 c. sriracha sauce with about 1/2 c. Pete's hot sauce.  I steamed the wings by placing them on a fanned out steamer, inserted in my largest frying pan and covered for about 10 mins.  Then salt and peppered the wings and baked them on a greased,  jelly roll pan  til crispy, about 25-30 mins. on each side.  Heated the remaining ingredients on the stove, then transferred to a warmed crock pot.  Oil was still floating on top, so I will try this again with just one cup of oil, ~ 2 c. red hot sauce (sriracha) and multiplying the remaining ingredients by four for 8 lbs. of wings.

Just made these for the Superbowl and my husband loved them!  I liked that they are baked and not fried. Made just as is!  Will definitely make again. Great recipe!
