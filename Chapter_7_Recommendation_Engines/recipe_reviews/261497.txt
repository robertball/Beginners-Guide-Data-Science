Used beef bones with some meat still on. Added the turmeric and ginger but also some garlic and cinnamon for the health benefits.  Didn't strain. Used part of broth for a Pilau with rice. Some I just drank as a hot cup, great during our cold spell. And added veggies tosome for soup. Great all the way around.

The addition of turmeric and ginger is the key.  At the suggestion of Kathi Lipp's podcast, I've started keeping a baggie in the freezer for  veggie scraps ( the tough ends of asparagus, trimmed celery, carrots, etc.).  When I make a bone broth, I add the contents of that bag to my pressure cooker plus enough water to cover bones and vegetables.  This cuts down on food waste and adds a great depth of flavor.  Unlike the Organic bone broth I usually buy, this bone broth is delicious on it's own.  In fact, I surprised myself by having a cup for lunch the day I made it.  It's that good!

Overall, the taste was very good in the chicken soup I made. I love using the IP for stock/broth instead of watching it on the hot stove! I thought the time of 120 minutes in the IP was excessive, as the other recipe I tried was only 30 minutes. So, I compromised with 60 minutes, which made a rich stock, thicker than the broth I usually make. Also, the bones were starting to disintegrate. I had to strain several times to get a consistency I liked. 120 minutes would have made a very rich stock, so I guess it's up to you how rich you want yours to be. Also, 2 teaspoons of turmeric seemed like a lot to me in the end product.
