Made this for my family and they LOVED it! The dressing is delightfully smooth and fresh, and made more than enough so we used it as a dip later.  I substituted nondairy yogurt for real yogurt and talapia for the halibut and it still tasted delicious.  I didn't have a grill so I made a large foil packet, sealed it well, placed it in a baking dish and baked it at 350 until the fish was flakey.  I also skipped the tortilla strips and used taco bowls instead. I will definitely be making this again.

So upon reading this recipe, I thought it would taste really good and it did not disappoint.  I did make a couple of changes though mainly to how I did the halibut.  I did the halibut in the foil packs however I baked mine as opposed to grilling them.  In addition, instead of placing a whole piece of halibut on top, I opted to flake it all over the salad.  I found this to be better as the fish was everywhere but really it is a matter of personal choice.  Otherwise the ingredients as listed were perfect.  If you like more garlic, add it in.  I had two big garlic in it and that was plenty.  If you plan on flaking it as I did, you may not need as much halibut as noted.  The avocado dressing was excellent.

Followed the recipe except I used haddock and mixed italian blend cheeses, just based on what I had. Blended the beans a bit just so they weren't whole as my toddlers won't eat them that way..all in all, was a very nice salad.

I varied the ingredients, I used shredded Pollock, Guacamole which had everything in it  and blended with yogurt.  Used spinach instead of Romain. put beans and cheese (Mexican 4 cheese blend) dab of sour cram fish then dressing

Although I didn't make the avocado sauce part, I did bake the fish in foil (in oven at 350 for 20 minutes) with the cumin spices, I liked that part and next time I'll add the avocado with it.
