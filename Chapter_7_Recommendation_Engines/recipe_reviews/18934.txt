I really enjoyed this drink! My husband doesn't typically like drinks with rum, but whenever I make this, he wants one too.

This is VERY good. Nice and tart and not really sweet, either. I used Captain's Tattoo Rum because that was all I had. I kept everything else the same.

Pretty average drink. Simple to make, but there are a lot better recipes.

Great flavor! I make it with 100% juice, so it doesn't have any added sugar or corn syrup. It's great to have a "healthy" drink option.
