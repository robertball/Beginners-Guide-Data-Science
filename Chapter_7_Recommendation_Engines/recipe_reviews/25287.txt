I have been making a variation of this for years. Mine adds sliced water chestnuts and uses bread crumbs instead of croutons. It has always been a hit no matter where I take it.

Great veggie dish! Easy to prepare. Even veggie avoiders will enjoy this. Use a small onion or the strong flavor will over power the sweet of the carrots. I didn't have any seasoned croutons in house & wanted something quick to use so opened a box of stovetop corn bread stuffing mix and used that w/ out the seasoning package. Was wonderful! Will make again.

Always make this one for big holiday dinners. I have used cream of chicken/mushroom/celery or whatever I have on hand and it always turns out great. I also prefer to use crushed ritz crackers on the top.

I used Wegman's seasoned croutons - Cheese & Garlic variety. This casserole was a HUGE success only problem - next time I have to make TWO of them because my husband ate almost one by himself!! HE LOVED IT!!

Good basic recipe! I didn't have cream of celery soup so used (low sodium) cream of mushroom and added no salt Spike rather than the salt and pepper but otherwise stayed with the original recipe. I could see myself making it again perhaps adding a mix of veggies and/or mushrooms... Great comfort food! Thanks!!

This recipe is a keeper. Perfect for holidays or when you have to bring a casserole to a party. I scaled down the butter to 3T. with the croutons and it was wonderful.

Made a meal for my in-laws and added this side dish to it. It went very well with everyone; except maybe the croutons can be left out. EXCELLANT THOUGH!

WOW! I was pleasantly surprised. I loved it. Husband loved it. Even my 16 month old son had some. Instead of croutons I used buttered Italian bread crumbs. Give this one a try. Well worth it.

I was skeptical when I saw the ingredients but had a bunch of carrots I had to use. Followed recipe as written. This was fabulous! It is really a kind of 'creamed carrots'. Will surely make this again!

I was trying to find a simialr recipe to a carrot casserole I had at a wedding and this was pretty much right on. I did use a box of stove top stuffing instead of croutons and mushroom soup vs. celery.

YUM! This was so good. I didn't use celery soup. I was going to use mushroom & then add just a pinch of celery seasoning but found that I didn't have any. Mushroom soup thinly sliced radish 1/4 of a onion! grated sharp cheddar (with some left for the topping just before you add the crushed ritz) I will def. add sliced water chestnuts too next time (as another reviewer said) A hit!

There was something missing from this...perhaps an additional type of cheese other than just processed? I actually opted to make my own croutons and added in a little bit of garlic and frozen spinach (thawed/drained) for extra excitement. I think next time I may try adding water chestnuts for texture (another reviewers suggestion) and maybe some fresh dill?

I am planning on making this for our church anniversary potluck but I needed to try it first. So I had four people over for dinner and gave this a shot. I got A raves only one person was not partial but this person isn't crazy about carrots. It was so easy pretty coloful and very tasteful. Three people gave this five stars and my husband gave it three stars. I did use frozen carrot that was the baby thumbnail type. Reason being is the frozen baby carrots are sweeter. I found the packaged fresh carrot tasted more like chemical and not as fresh. Baby carrots are the way to go. I did not have croutons so I used grain bread and browned it in butter. That was the only change I made. Awesome recipe to the submitter and I WILL be making this for our church potluck for a different treat for others. Thanks!

We really liked this served with chicken! I discovered I did not have croutons so I used Italian dried bread crumbs mixed with butter for the topping which worked out really well.

I loved this dish! I used less butter & made the whole thing in a sauce pan on top of the stove. I also did not put croutons on top and used onion powder so the kids wouldn't see the onions. This even tasted better the next day. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

My 13 year old was surfing the web at school and brought this recipe home and made if for dinner that night. That is proof enough for me to know it was a good recipe if you don't have to have any special ingredients. Well we all loved it. Anything with cheese and butter is good for us. This was easy for her to make and easier for us to eat. This would be good for holiday buffet.

I loved this. I was very new to cooking when I first made it and didn't know what processed cheese was so I used cubed sharp chedder. It wasn't as creamy as I imagine processed would have been but the dish was to die for. Not an ounce got left un-eaten.

Made this for Sunday dinner with the family. It was terriffic! I was nervous about he combination of cheese with the cream of celery sop but it turned out great. I ran out of time making this so I did improvise a little by omitting the sautéed onion step. I used onion powder instead. After straining the carrots I returned them to the pot I boiled them in & then mixed the soup and cheese in the pot. Super easy and didn't dirty any additional dishes. Also I didn't add any additional salt and it didn't need it. Thanks Jane for a great recipe.

This is really good-- and EASY! But a few things: you really don't have to add any more salt (the cream soup has enough!) also added some celery with the onion. I used a handful of shredded cheddar and it worked perfect. (No other cheese on hand) Nice recipe!

A friend of mine gave me this recipe about 15 years ago. My sister hosts Easter dinner every year and every year she asks that I bring it. I have made this with grated cheese and have made it with shredded cheese. Both work great. Even those who don't love carrots eat this up!

I made this for a family potluck to use up an excess of carrots I had on hand substituting cheddar for the processed cheese (also using what I had). It got lots of complements and request for the recipe. This is different from anything I have eaten previously but yummy. It makes a lot and would be easy to half for one family. I'll definitely be making this again!

Had a bunch of carrots in the fridge that needed eating. I wanted a savory not a sweet side dish so I gave this a try. I gave this a 3 because of all the subs that I made. I did make a few substitutions I used shredded colby/ cheddar rather than processed cheese cream of mushroom and the crushed ritz because that is what I had. I cut the amount of butter because it as already in the crackers so I left out 1/3 cup of that. It was still plenty rich without it. Until I added some more spices this was a fairly bland dish. I added dill weed and grated ginger to the sauteeing onion then carrot mixture. I added 1/2 teaspoon but If I made this again I would add much more. Also I think I would make sure to have the crutons instead of the crackers.. but I would make my own using stale olive loaf... I also would make this a mixture of carrots and zucchinis and toss in some fresh parsley or fresh dill weed. This could use some "green fresh" flavor" Overall this is a basic Americana recipe that is a little too reliant on the canned soup base for my tastes. I should have been warned by the processed cheese in the initial recipe but I thought that might just be for the smooth meltiness but I now think it is more of an intrinsic part of the flavor aesthetic. I like the use of a cream base in sauteed onions then layering the blanched sliced veggies in the baking dish as the basis for a cassarole. The rest of the this particular recipe I will not use again

Not bad but rather bland. Needs something - maybe a little Mrs. Dash? I tried it with 2 cups of the Stovetop Stuffing but it was too much. Next time I will use less. Maybe only 1 cup.

This is a good recipe. I consider this recipe would adapt for many vegetables...broccoli and/or cauliflower would be great. Corn??? I didn't have croutons so I pulsed some italian flatbreads and used that as the topping. This recipe is very versatile and I will do again.

the dish was o.k. Kind of bland though. no real flavor. When I reheated the left overs I added a little dill to the mix and it made a big difference. seemed to bring out the flavors more. I will make this again but will add some dill right from the get go.

This was delicious! I loved the fresh carrot taste with the cheese. I will definitely make this again. I would even consider using it at a topping to some pasta or rice.
