I just wanted to thank you for sharing this recipe.  It`s one of our favorites almost like a buttery graham cracker. It`s become a staple for the lunch box.

Awesome!  I omitted the lemon extract and added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon instead and they turned out delicious.  Really do roll them thin, 1/8 of an inch...they turned out great!  Wonderful Christmas cookie!!!

I added 8oz of candied fruit for a bit of color. I also made the mistake of adding cooked oatmeal instead of dry oats. However, this turned the recipe into an excellent batch of drop cookies that were very soft, but held together nicely.

Made this for Faceless Frenzy 2013.  I couldn't decide between a sugar cookie and an oatmeal cookie and this one is a perfect combination.  I made a half batch and used 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice instead of extract. I also added a bit of lemon zest, more zest will be added next time, a nice surprise for the taste buds! I'll freeze what I don't eat tonight and frost them later.  I will make these again. (If you don't want to frost, add a slice of bread to your airtight cookie jar to keep the cookies soft.)

very tasty cookie! A healthier cut out cookie..will definitely make these again.  If you are adding sprinkles, do so before baking..I clued in after my 2nd tray went into the oven... Makes a big batch.

Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe. I usually don't try out cookies that only have a few reviews, but I like the idea of adding oatmeal into cutout cookies. I'm glad I tried out your recipe because it's great and the kids love it! I use 1/2 tsp orange extract instead of lemon because that's all I had on hand. I use steel cut quick cooking oatmeal and only use 1 cup. I added 2 tbs of milk because the dough was very thick. I also brush the top with egg white so the sprinkles will stick to the cookies. Roll them thin because the cookies rise up as they bake in the oven.

These cookies were tasty, but they were a bit dry. I used orange extract instead of lemon, and they turned out nicely.

These are really easy and good.  I didn't have lemon extract, but instead added the 1/4 tsp of cinnamon as another suggested.  Will add another 1/4 tsp next time.  but the kids love them!  I did not cut them out, but i just used a scoop and they were great!

We loved the addition of oats! I used powdered lemon peel instead of extract.

I loved these. All my family loved them too, especially the fact that they were crunchy. Cutting them was a breeze and no dough-chilling-time required had me double-checking the recipe before I started. Tastes great too. I thought I was making a lot but they were devoured quickly!

A few changes for me:  I used egg replacer and replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with  1/2 cup of brown sugar, also added 1/2 cup raisons and 1/2 cup less oatmeal so the dough wasnâ€˜t too dry. Frosting was necessary after the changes. They are delicious and crispy.

Will never make our traditional sugar cookies again. I used almond extract instead of lemon. I also only baked them for 8 minutes (the first batch were a little dark) but it totally depends on how thin your rolled out dough is. I mixed in the oatmeal with my hands (easier than trying to stir it in). Have posted to Facebook for all my friends to see.

I really love these cookies. I came here by accident, my mothers family name is van Hasz (I'm from the Netherlands), and I was curious, but didn't expect much, but they are delightfull! Not only with Chrismas :)
