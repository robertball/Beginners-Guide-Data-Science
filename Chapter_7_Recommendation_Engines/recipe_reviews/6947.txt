Wonderful recipe! I will never buy them from the store again! The English muffins are lovely when toasted; light and crisp. Mine were full of nooks and crannies! They are perfect with honey butter.
In order to make sure you English muffins "work out" and aren't too dense, try these tips:
Use bread flour instead of all-purpose. It has a higher gluten content which will aid in the rising of the dough.

When you "scald" the milk, don't let it boil! Just heat the milk to about 185F.

When activating your yeast (warm water and yeast part of recipe) follow this guideline: use water that is between 100F-115F for dry active yeast, and 120F-130F for instant active or rapid rise yeast. This isn't a necessary step in the recipe, but it will let you know if your yeast is "active". I add a pinch of flour and sugar when I do this step to "feed" the yeast. It will froth like mad!

Like a previous poster noted, don't play with the dough too much after the first rise, it will lessen the amount of air in the dough. Handle it carefully!

Last tip, after the second rise they will puff up. Carefully, transfer them to the greased skillet, using a spatula, and they will stay puffed up. The muffins will only "deflate" once you turn them over.
Hope this helps someone!

Born & raised in Canada we ate English Muffins on a regular basis. To those who found that there were no nooks & crannies in their muffins try this: Poke your muffin around the edge (where it would normally be cut) with a fork, continue around the muffin then spread/pull it apart with your fingers...you will find there are nooks & crannies within. Canadian English Muffins are never precut like the American version.  Also, remember that these are homemade & dont contain the chemical stabilizers that the store bought muffins contain....with that comes a different taste & texture. If you are comparing them to store bought...its equivalent to comparing store bought bread to real homemade bread...no comparison. If you are an inexperienced baker its hard to judge how  much flour is enough....what exactly a 'soft dough' means etc. but you will learn with experience. Keep on baking & hone your skills. The world needs REAL bakers. It is fast becoming a lost art form. 

I used bread flour, slightly more yeast & allowed the cut muffins to rise 40 mins. as per previous bakers suggestions. I loved these  muffins ! No, not store bought tasting....but better. Linda has been making these for 29 because to her & her family they are the best. I would agree with Linda. I thank you Linda for the outstanding recipe. Happy Baking to all !!! Cheers

Hands down, one of the best recipes I've gotten off the web! I had to cook them over low heat, I guess my stovetop has a higher flame than some. For those who were having trouble with the nooks and crannys: knead the dough as little as possible after you punch it down and roll it out. This will decrease the number of broken air pockets. After the first rise, the yeast does not create new pockets, it only enhances the ones that were initially formed. The more you work with the dough after the first rise, the fewer pockets of air you will have. Secondly, let the muffins REALLY rise after you've cut them and are waiting to pan bake them. They may still not be exactly like the ones in the store, but then again, those are commercial muffins and are actually not traditional English muffins.

I loved these muffins! They were easy to make, had a light texture, and had enough nooks and crannies to suit me! Thanks, everyone for all your tips.  Here's my combination of tips: I added a pinch of sugar to feed the yeast. I used 3 cups whole wheat and 2 cups unbleached white flour. After the first rising, I formed the dough into a log and cut 18 slices, dredged them in corn meal then placed on a sprayed cookie sheet. I pre-heated my oven to 100 degrees, turned it off and set the trays in there for 30 minutes. They rose beautifully! And here's the best time saving tip of all: I removed the trays, heated the oven to 375 degrees and baked the muffins on the same trays for 5 minutes on one side, then flipped and baked them another 5 minutes.  They turned out perfect!   Watch out though, the 18 slices made pretty big muffins.  Mine were about 4.5 inches across, compared to 3 inches for store bought ones.  If you want them small, make your log longer and cut into 24 pieces. I might do that next time. Remember to split your muffins open with a large fork!  And here's a MUST DO: have one hot out of the oven with butter and a little cheese. Heaven!!

Great recipe - but don't expect these to be anything like the more famous "store bought" kind. These are definitely a bit more "dense". I used butter-flavored shortening and instead of the griddle, I did mine in the oven. I lined a tray with parchment paper and baked them at 375 for 8 minutes, flipped them and let them go for another 8 minutes.  They were really good toasted with butter and jelly.  Next time I might throw some cinnamon and raisins or some dried cranberries and orange zest into the batter for a little something different.......

My english muffins came out great except the interior texture of the muffin was more the consistancy of a bagel rather than an english muffin. The inside was more dense and did not have the "holes" an english muffin has. The flavor was very good though. Due to having to take my daughter somewhere, I cooked part of the muffins after a 30 minute final rise and the rest of them after an hour rise and the ones which were allowed to rise longer were nicer and bigger. Delicious toasted and topped with cream cheese!!

Ok, these are definitely NOT English Muffins.  They are buns.  Yeast raised buns.  And, it's a decent recipe for buns.  Cooking buns on a pan is unusual, but makes for a nice crust.  English muffins are very different -- they are a bit chewey, and they have a coarser crumb with lots of big holes that leave all the bumps and ridges that make them very crispy when toasted.  To acheive this, the dough is usually very soft like a batter, and it contains both yeast and -- added near the end of the raising -- some baking soda.  They also contain eggs or egg whites to help make them chewy.    Sorry, but this is simply misnamed/categorized.  I made this though.  It produces nice buns for hamburgers, etc., and they toast like white bread.

My husband and I were very impressed with this recipe!  I did have to alter the cooking of the dough: low heat for about 8 min. on each side, and frequently turning them to brown evenly. Delicious!

I am still in the process of making this recipe.  However, I do have a question.  The recipe states to add the sugar to the shortening and milk.  It also says to add the sugar to the yeast and water mixer.  I have added the sugar to the milk mixture for ease in dissolving the sugar.  The dough has risen beautifully and the muffins are rising before cooking.  It seems funny to 'bake' the muffins in the frying pan.

These were very tasty.  They are best would cooked slowly.  It takes time but the English Muffins are delicious. They keep well for about a week and toast well.

I love these!  The yeast will proof faster if you add the sugar to the water/yeast mixture, but I've made it both ways and it works just fine.

This recipe was a good one.  They looked pretty and the dough was great to work with.  They didn't taste like store-bought english muffins, more like a dinner roll.  I baked them at 350 for 8 minutes per side as other reviewers suggested, which produced a more even color.  I'll be making these again!

Great Recipe as is! However, I did make some changes. Substituted butter for the shortening. Heated butter, milk, water until melted and proofed the yeast right in the warm liquids. Only added flour until the dough wasn't sticky anymore. After cutting dough out let them rise on baking pans covered in coarse corn meal so that I wouldn't have to transfer them and lose their second rise air. Baked in a 350 convection oven for 8 min and flipped and did another 8 min. They didn't have just a brown top and bottom, can do that in a pan, but had an all over golden brown color. Serve this for breakfast at me cafe, hope this helps!

These are wonderful!!  I found them very easy to make.  Made them early in the am, and by lunch my family had eaten half of them....got about 20 from the recipe.  I froze the rest and they held up very well.  I will certainly use this many times.  Thank you so very much!!

I now have made these muffins twice.  Before the end of this week, it will be again.  Because I love making bread with much experience, I've made some changes.
SOME CHANGES I'VE MADE.
I did NOT roll out and then cut with circle.  I rolled them into a log and cut  with a knife or pastry cutter.  18 slices perfect size.  You can press into shape once cut. Easier to get into a log if get a log and  cut in half.  Then cut into 9 equal pieces.

Add a good TABLESPOON Salt instead of the  teaspoon in the recipe.  Salt is the only ingredient that gives bread its taste.

Also, I used NO Cornmeal.  Instead I have a pancake eletric grill.  Once formed, I place them directly on grill, let rise 1 hour then put on 11 minutes 1st side on 300 F.  10 minutes 2nd. side. I do spray the grill with food release. (Pam)

The shortening, I used butter flavor Crisco.   What a great thing !


THESE will be gone before breakfast which you made them for.  Wow!   Please enjoy!

I got the nooks and crannies, must admit, I roll out to 1/4", then fold the dough over on itself, then cut to 3 1/2" circles. Let rise a long time, I have a cold kitchen, it takes longer. And freeze half after they are cooked in my cast iron frying pan, slightly greased each time with PAM spray, as needed. Will look for future recipes from you Linda.

To get a lot of nooks and crannies: 
-Keep the dough as wet as you can while still being able to form it. The more moisture, the larger the holes will be. Just use a generous amount of flour to keep the dough from sticking to the counter when patting it out to 1/2 inch. 
-After the first rise, do not punch it down. Spoon it gently onto the floured counter top and pat out, trying to deflate as few air pockets as possible.
-After you cut them out and let them rise again, be very gentle when you move them to the griddle; keep those air pockets intact!

For more flavor:
Double the salt. Otherwise the bread is a bit bland.

This is almost identical to my moms recipe for English muffins, except she added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg with the sugar, and didn't roll and cut the dough but formed it into 24 balls and let rise. In order to get nooks and crannies you need to handle the dough as little as possible, make sure it doubles in the second rising, cook it slowly on low heat, don't push down on it when it is cooking, and Fork split. The texture is all in technique not ingredients.

The nooks and cranies come from the air bubbles (co2)left in the dough after the first rise.  When you punch down the dough, you let the air out of the dough by popping those bubbles.  If you want nooks and cranies, form the muffins, then let the muffins sit for 15/20 minutes to rise again, the yeast will have a second chance to develop the co2 and alcohols that make the pockets (air bubbles) or what we call "nooks and crannies".  This is a great recipe, its easy, and as a chef, I'm happy to have this in my repetoir.

These muffins taste great!  I would have appreciated a bit more info in the recipe.  I was left wondering whether I'd risen them long enough, what to do with the extra dough when cutting with a biscuit cutter, how hot the griddle should be etc...  In spite of this, they turned out great.  
I only made one change; on my second batch (after finding the left-over dough tough & hard to roll out), instead of cutting with a biscuit cutter, I cut rectangles with a pizza wheel.  They don't look like store-bought but taste the same and no wasted dough!

This is one of the best english muffins I have ever tasted!!  I did change only one thing.  Use bread flour instead of AP flour.  Make sure your yeast is fresh and active and to use water heated to 110 to 120 degrees.  I have made this many times over and have advice for proper frying:  I have an electric stove.  Ten is high, zero is low.  I used 1 which I would say is medium/low.  Fry 3 or 4 at a time in a frying pan with a LID.  Use about 1 capful of frying oil for EACH SIDE for about 8 minutes; with the lid on your english muffins, it will fry, bake and rise at the same time.  It comes out a beautiful golden brown and is perfect every time.

Easier than I ever imagined! After reading the reviews I used bread flour instead of all purpose flour and butter flavored crisco instead of  shortening. I opted to make the dough in the bread machine on the dough cycle. Then I formed a log without messing with the dough too much. I cut it into 9 almost equal pieces (next time I'll do 12 because they were really big) I used my Tupperware hamburger press form (the circle only) and my fingers to press the dough into perfect circles. I let them rise on the parchment lined cookie sheet I was going to bake them on for an hour in the oven with the oven light on. I took the cookie sheet out, preheated the oven to 375 degrees. Baked 8 minutes on one side, flipped them, 8 minutes on the other side. They are lite, airy and wonderful. Will make again!

These are awesome english muffins. The recipe can be easily converted to vegan (I used almond milk and saffola.) It's easy to make and the whole family loves them!

Great recipe! I didn't change anything except after reading the reviews for this recipe, I was very careful not to over handle the dough, and I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper and baked them at 375 for 8 minutes, flipped them and let them go for another 8 minutes. Wonderful! =)

Perfect! Make sure to let them rise for soft, fluffy insides. The first rise should be at least an hour, second rise at least 45 minutes. I used a large martini glass to cut large rounds of dough. Thanks!

Most definitely only use 4.5 to 5 cups of flour.  What I do is dump flour in a pile onto my counter, make a well, and pour liquids into the well.  Slowly stir with a fork or your hands, incorporating the flour "wall" into the liquid.  You'll know when to stop incorporating more flour.  The dough almost tells you to stop!  I make pasta this way, also.

I've made the recipe as written, and have also made it using one part whole wheat flour to two parts AP flour.  The whole wheat version doesn't rise as much (both during proofing and pan frying) but does yield a higher crunch after toasting.

I'm allergic to corn so I omit the cornmeal.  Instead I lightly sprinkle kosher or sea salt on both sides of the muffins as they're fresh out of the pan fry stage.

Love these muffins but they do need a little TLC.  I'm going to upload a picture of muffins I made tonight that are the wheat version and cut with a heart shaped cookie cutter.  They are delish!

Extremely yummy!  They were all gone in a day and a half.  I wonder what they would be like if you substituted honey or molasses for the sugar?  I'm going to try it next time.

This is an ok recipe but it does need to be altered! We make them with 100% whole white wheat flour and honey. Extremely delicious! Instead of rolling the dough I put it in a log and sliced. Reduce flour to 5 cups, increase liquid and yeast by an additional 50%.
After making this both in the oven and stove top I must say that the oven is definitely better. Some say that pan frying them will get you the nooks and crannies but it does not. In fact, they rise much more in the oven and have more nooks and crannies because of this. PLUS, the recipe states to pan fry them for 10 minutes each side, mine were quite brown after 5 minutes on medium heat. The second batch I moved the heat down quite a bit and they were still brown way before the 10 minute mark. Put them in the oven at 350 for 7-8 minutes each side.

I followed the ingredients exactly as listed, but changed the technique a bit.  I warmed the milk in the microwave- I've found it's more difficult to accidentally scald it that way.  I used half bread flour and half all-purpose flour.  The breadmachine did the kneading for me, but I transferred to a greased bowl for the first rise.  I allowed the dough to rise for at least an hour before lightly punching, rolling out to 3/4" (not 1/2") thickness.  Baked at 375°F, but won't brown them on the griddle until I'm ready to eat/serve them (I'm the only one in the house who eats English muffins).  All in all, the flavor was great, and allowing the dough sufficient time to rise will develop tons of "nooks and crannies" during baking.

Loved the flavor and texture of these muffins. One recommendation, though -- don't just "sprinkle" the cornmeal on the parchment paper; be generous enough with it that the dough cannot stick at all to the paper. Mine stuck in places, and that caused the dough to deflate as I moved them to the skillet.

This is a great recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening.  I also wanted to cook them all at once, so I baked in a 350 degree convection oven for 8 minutes, turned and baked for an additional 7.  They're delicious!

I saved this to my recipe box on this site some time ago.  Today (Jan. 02/2011) I decided to try and make these and judge these for my self.  They are every bit as good as all the reviews have said!  So many people are intimidated by using yeast in recipes.  I know because I used to be one of those people.  Warm water means kitchen sink hot tap water to me now and hot water means it needs to be heated a tad first.  I got to this conclusion by testing my hot water temps.  Your water heater may be turned up higher then mine so test first.  They tasted so fresh and I understand why they say split with fork now after all these years.  It's so you don't smoth out all the nooks and crannies (air holes inside) by slicing with a knife.  My darling husband was pleasantly surprised!  He loves English Muffins and these were excellent.  The only change I made was to substitute 2 cups of wheat flour inplace of 2 of the cups of white flour. Thanks for sharing such a simple and practical good recipe that I'll use often now.

Mine didn't turn out dense at all! They were beautifully fluffy and soft with nooks and crannies. I did bake them, not pan fry... I just don't have the time to tend to the fire/pan. My husband is over the moon - he hates the 'freezer burn' taste of the store-bought kind. Oh yes, I did use butter instead of shortening cuz that's all I had on hand. The aroma is beautifully buttery and delicious. Thank you!

Great recipe! Here's what I did: I made the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook. I subbed out one cup of flour for wheat flour and added 1T honey to the liquid mix to make these more like the Honey Wheat variety you can get in the store. Delicious. I would add the flour gradually and stop when a soft dough ball forms. I think I ended up using 5 1/4 cups flour. 6 cups would have made this too dense. Also, I recommend bread flour, as others have said. When I put these in the griddle, I added about a tablespoon of butter to the oil. When they were nicely browned on both sides, I finished them in a 400 degree over for 3 minutes to make sure they were done through. I was able to get 21 good-sized muffins. I put most of them in the freezer and plan to make mini pizzas on them for my sons' sack lunches for school.

I would give these a 5 in overall taste, but since they were supposed to be english muffins and ended up tasting like really good rolls, I gave them 3.  I subbed margarine instead of shortening (personal peference) but kept everything else as is.  Using a fork to seperate did keep the nooks and crannies in tact, but the texture was not that of a regular english muffin.  I also baked these at 375 for 8 min on each side on a greased baking sheet and they turned out beautifully.  I halved the recipe and ended up with 12 nice sized muffins.  I am planning on trying alton brown's english muffin recipe, as it makes a wet batter, and seems to be more of the texture I was looking for.

Well... I had high hopes for this recipe based on the great reviews and star rating, but... sorry, I have to agree with one or two others, that these are not English Muffins! They LOOK about right, but they don't taste right, they don't feel right, they don't smell right.    I can't give them any more than a 2-star rating primarily because of the claim that the are better than store bought... Nah! I'll take the store bought over these any day.

Very good and easy to make.  Excellent texture and taste.  Using this recipe, and a 1-pound coffee can for a cutter, it makes perfect hamburger buns.  After rolling out dough 1/2-inch thick, cut with coffee can and place on lightly floured 11 x 16 baking pan.  Lightly brush tops with butter, cover and let rise until doubled in size.  Bake at 400-deg F for 10 minutes or until golden brown.  Cool on wire rack then slice.

These English Muffins came out so great, and I have fun making them.
To make them a little bit healthier, I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 3 coups of all-purpose flour.

This is a great recipe.  Mine turned out just like Thomas' English muffins - although I cut them out and baked them, rather than cooking them on a griddle.  I threw corn meal on a baking stone, placed the cut out muffins, buttered the tops and sprinkled more corn meal on the top.  They were beautiful.  I served them w/ clotted cream and peach preserves - no THAT is a decadent treat

MUCH better than the recipe I've been using for over 20 years!!  To prevent deflating, after cutting out, place muffins directly on the griddle, then let rise as directed.  Then, begin on a very low heat.  If using electric griddle or fry pan as I usually do, start heating around 250 degrees.  You can either leave it at this temp & cook about 15 min. per side (till slightly golden), or increase heat a little and cook for less time.  This may take longer, but I never have the problem of them deflating.  If using stove top, I begin them on low, then increase temp a bit after pan is hot.

We love this recipe. We have made a few variations, however....We use trans fat-free shortening, and have had luck adding raisins to the dough. We also mix the dough in the bread machine, then take it out to roll it and cut it into shapes. We don't use grease in our frying pan, and then we put the finished muffins in the oven (at temp 200) to wait for the rest to cook in the pan. We take them all out when they are done, and put them in food storage bags.

These were amazing! They are SO much better than store bought. I'm ruined now because I can never go back. It was very easy and I didn't have any problems at all. I'm not sure what the "nooks and crannies" is all about but if we're talking air bubbles or holes, I didn't have any of that. The only thing different I did was use the bread flour instead of all purpose. I see a lot of reviews saying not to handle the dough much after the first rise, but when I cut my muffins I had to knead it or stick the remaining dough back together to keep cutting until my dough was gone; waste not want not. It didn't appear to make any difference at all. They all came out wonderful! This is definitely going to be my recipe of choice, here on out. The only thing I would suggest to do different (besides the bread flour) is to use a 4-5 inch cutter. Mine was a 3-inch and was a bit small. They're still very good, but small.

I am giving these a 4 star because I strongly feel they should be baked in the oven for best results.  I tried frying them on the stove with very poor results so I put the rest of the muffins in the oven at 350 degress for 1o minutes, turned them over and backed for another 8 minutes.  They turned out great, not burnt like my results on the stove.  Also much healthier by baking them too. Taste is great.  I will be making these again but for sure baking them in the oven

This was my first time making English muffins. I put all ingredients in my Breadman with the yeast last on top of the flour. Put on dough cycle. After 90 minutes I placed on counter and cut in half. I didn't roll out, just patted slightly and cut. Got 20 muffins about 3/4 inch thick. I place cornmeal in a soup bowl and after cutting each I placed into the cornmeal, pressed down both sides into the meal. I then placed onto baking sheets covered in cornmeal. I used my large cast iron skillet. Must be kept on lowest heat setting. I flipped them several times as they were getting dark. I did manage to cook them for 20 minutes. I made a loaf out of the 2nd half and baked for 25 minutes at 420. I used a standard canning jar ring to cut the muffins. A larger ring would be better. The muffins are delicious and loaded with nooks and crannies. My husband loves the bread.

This were really good and look like store bought english muffins. If possible, let them rise(second rise) in the pans that you are going to cook them in. I let them rise on the counter and when transferring them to the pan,the muffins deflated somewhat from the rising process and lost some of the crevices. I cooked them in an electric skillet on 300 for 20 minutes and they were perfect.

Excellent and easy to make. It might be noted that if using rapid rise yeast just add dry yeast to dry ingredients (flour, salt etc) then blend in. Premixing yeast is not neccessary if using dry rapid rise type. This makes it even easier to make these excellent muffins.

These were so yummy! Tons of nooks and crannies. I did switch out butter for the shortening, and instead of rounds I used a pizza cutter and made squares to avoid having to re-roll the dough. YUMMY!

These are great! I was so scared at first, since this was my first time really working with dry yeast! I took other reviwers' suggestions and handled the dough lightly. I also only added about 3/4 of the suggested ammount of flour and only left the circles of dough out for 15 minutes to rise, they then rose on the griddle. They were delicious! Full of nooks and crannies, just the way they should be!

These are FANTASTIC. It is noteworthy to share a couple of secrets. First, do not worry! These WILL rise even more when on the griddle. My first time making them, I was worried that they would be flat. No chance of that. Second, better than putting them on wax paper sprinkled with cornmeal, put them on a greased baking sheet. I tried it both ways, and once raised, the muffins deflated when I tried moving them from the wax paper to the griddle. Not so with those on the greased sheet.   Even though english muffins are often buy one get one free at my local store, I'd still rather make them with this recipe. They are that good!

After reading reviews from many people emphasizing to be very gentle with the dough, I really tried my best to handle it as little as possible after the first rise.  I did end up using pretty much the whole amount of flour as the dough was sticky until it was all in there and used butter instead of shortening as that's what I had.  I did the log-cutting method since I didn't want to have any wasted dough and I ended up with 20 muffins.  I also added a pinch of sugar when proofing the yeast and let the muffins/dough rise in a warm oven (30 minutes for each rise).  I cooked about half in a pan on the stove and about half on my electric griddle.  The ones on the stove browned a bit better (maybe I needed higher heat on the griddle?).  My muffins fork split just fine and made the traditional "nooks & crannies" with some muffins fluffier inside than others.  They do come out a little denser than storebought, but quite excellent!  I toasted and buttered a muffin from my first cooking batch and was saddened to discover that my jelly had gotten fuzzy in the fridge :(  So, I topped them with sliced cheese instead.  My four year old inhaled his and I'm planning to get more jelly this afternoon!

The first time I made them, they were just awful. Since I often bake with yeast, I should have been more careful: 6 cups of flour is WAY too much! They were like hockey pucks. Made a second batch using 4 cups of flour. Significantly better in texture; I even had a few nooks & crannies! Took some reviewer's advice and let them rise right on the griddle, rather than lose the second rising by moving them. They taste OK, but I'm probably not going to make them again. The flavor is bland, a bit yeast-y, and the texture too bread-y. The dough might make a nice dinner roll but it's not a great English muffin.

So happy to report that these turned out delicious! After reading a bunch of reviews I did make a few adjustments. Used honey in place of the sugar, butter in place of the shortening, added about 2 Tbl of ground flax seed, and used only about 4 1/2  cups of flour (6 would have been way too much!) I baked them on a cornmeal sprinkled (don't skimp on the cornmeal) baking sheet at 375 for 8 minutes per side. After they were done in the oven I finished them on the stove top in a warm cast iron skillet (no grease/oil) for 2-3 minutes per side. That final step gives the muffin the "finished" look of an English Muffin. Don't skip that last step. I fork split several muffins and toasted them up once cooled. Plenty of nooks/crannies and oh so yummy! No more store bought for us!

After the muffins have been formed place them on a cookie sheet that has been covered with a very thick layer of cornmeal. This will keep the muffins from sticking after they've risen the second time and makes it very easy to slide a spatula beneath each muffin when they're ready to cook on the griddle. Still working over the cookie sheet, gently transfer the risen muffin from the spatula onto your other hand to let the excess cornmeal fall away before sliding it back onto the spatula and then onto the griddle. All the extra cornmeal on the cookie sheet can be tapped onto a flexible plastic cutting sheet and then transferred back to the cornmeal container for reuse in the future.

I tried again and skipped the punch down part.I also tried to bake them but, they were NOT AS YUMMY!oh yes the second batch turned out so much more bodaciously awesome.thank you linda for sharing this.Also I didn't knead  much. The less you play with the dough the better. I even got nooks n crannies this time. you just want to add enuf flour to where the dough is not sticky roll out and use a big cup with a wide lippet. IF YOU WANT BIG MUFFINS I stirred by hand cuz I had no mixer. HOPE THIS HELPS HAPPY COOKING TO ALL!  :)

Awesome and easy recipe. For me, living in Spain, I can't find English muffins anywhere, but after making this recipe I've decided to stop looking.  This was my first solo attempt at bread making, and it was not only easy, forgiving, and challenging enough, but the end result is wonderful. I heeded other reviewers advice to handle as little as possible after the first rise, and though the dough seemed super bubbly and very fragile, I carefully transfered the risen muffins to the oven and cooked 8 min at 375, per other reviewers directions, then flipped with a spatula and cooked another eight. Though the muffins looked too light when 8 min had past, by the time they were done they had browned nicely on both sides- a lovely golden color. They only get brown where they touch the pan though, so don't expect golden color all around, mine were still mostly white on top. Since I always split these with a fork, I had plenty of nooks and crannys. Next time I'm going to try with bread flour to see if I get bigger ones.  I used some corn muffin mix in place of the corn meal (basically the same thing) and it gave the muffins a very subtle  and pleasant sweetness to the crust. I have used these for breakfast, snacks and even as pizza crusts for personal pizzas (no leftovers). Delicious!

The flavor of these muffins are 5 star with a couple of alterations.  I used double the amount of yeast and was able to only knead in 5 cups of flour before the dough became too thick.  Using a large electric griddle, cooked for 10 minutes per side at 280 degrees.  Very good results with these alterations.  Will make again!

Excellent Recipe! My first "from scratch" yeast recipe and it was so easy and the finished product is delicious. I did end up baking these @ 350 for approx. 8 min on the first side and 7 min on the second. I attempted to use an electric griddle (only griddle I have) and the one I have is too hard to regulate the temp and I burned the first couple of muffins. Baking worked out perfectly. I will make these often. Thanks for sharing!

This is the third time I've made these muffins and they are perfect every time! because I'm not so handy with a griddle, I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and baked them in the oven at 180Celsius for about 20 -25 mins. Perfect every time!!

Fun-tastic!  Made these with the kids and used rings I purchased especially for Eng. muffins.  You can also use tuna cans with both ends removed.  The only "change" I made was to use soy milk.  Deee-lish!  Be sure to use a fork to split the muffins so that when you tear them open they have the nooks and crannies.  Cutting with a knife will give the muffin a flat surface.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I had never made English muffins before and I love doing something new.  I followed the recipe exactly and the taste is perfect.  I actually amazed myself!  Next time I will try adding cinnamon and raisins.  Thank you Linda Pinda for sharing.

I could not believe how easy these were to make.  The flavor is wonderful and the texture is so much better than store-bought.  The griddle on my stove was browning them too fast, so the second time I made them, I used a large electric skillet on low....worked perfectly!  Muffins cooked slowly, all the way through, without getting overdone on the outside.  I LOVE this recipe!  Thanks very much, LindaPinda!

Sorry wasn't impressed with them. It was a texture thing. It was crisp and crumbly, not like an english muffin, soft and slighty chewy.  Thanks for posting the recipe though.

This was my first attempt at English muffins.  I had fun and they're everything I hoped for in homemade.  I will definitely be making these regularly in the future.  I added my sugar to the proofing yeast.  I can't imagine that matters, only that it dissolves.  I didn't rush the second rise.  Made 18 muffins.  I used my large carving fork to split each one.  When you pull them apart, they have lots of nooks and crannies.  They're really something to sink your teeth into.  Thank you for sharing this Linda.

I used butter instead of shortening and the buttery taste was very pronounced.  I also cut the flour to 5 cups.  For the "real" english muffin flavor, I simply cut and toasted.  It was great.

Really good results with this recipe.  I use half whole wheat flour and half bread flour, and lately I've been making them sourdough by omitting the yeast, adding 1 cup of sourdough starter, and leaving 3/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup water out of the original recipe.  If you make them sourdough, it's best to make the dough the night before and let it rise overnight in the fridge.  Take them out of the fridge an hour or two before shaping to take the chill off, and then proceed as normal.  They are really delicious with homemade peanut butter and honey or bananas.

Wow - this is tough to rate.  As a bread product I give it a 5.  As an english muffin I give it a 2.  The flavor is NOT english muffin like.  The nooks and crannies were definately NOT there even though I followed all the other suggestions.  I will make again - but not as english muffins.  These make great buns and I love the skillet baking.

A solid recipe, very easy and time effective as far as muffin/biscuit recipes go. A lot of reviewers say they didn't get the "nooks and crannies" typical of English Muffins; I would suggest activating the yeast before mixing (a pinch of sugar and flour into the water mixture) Also beware of over-kneading the dough after you punch it down. All in all a great recipe, especially if you like thicker muffins.

It tasted like an English Muffin, but was far too dense. I haven't tried it yet, but I would suggest using 4 cups of flour instead of 6. This seems to be what some other English Muffin recipes call for.

These english muffins are awesome.  Ever since I made them about 2 months ago, my husband refuses store bought ones.  He brags about them to everyone.  I do use a little less flour than it calls for.  Thanks for the recipe

I've made these many times for friends and my food co-op, and everyone loves them. They're wonderful to have around for breakfast or a snack. Sometimes I substitute 2 cups of the flour with 2 cups of whole wheat flour, which makes them especially crisp and a bit more dense. You'll get more "nooks and crannies" if you let them rise a bit longer after rolling out and cutting the dough, about 45 minutes instead of 30. I'd also recommend experimenting with flavors - adding things like cinnamon or honey. Once you've fooled around with this recipie a bit and figured out the way you like them best, you'll never want to buy store bought english muffins again!

Too bad this recipe doesn't have the true "nooks and crannies" of the english muffins we all love.  They look great and are simple to make, but even fork split- no holes.  Too bad, because the taste is good, but unfortunately, they are not true english muffins.

These were easy to make and tasted good, nothing outstanding, but just good homemade bread.  My children and nieces and nephes really liked them , and they go wonderful with "Cinnamon Honey Butter" from this site.  I finished mine in the oven, because I didn't have time to stand over my electric griddle.  I fried them for about 10 mins total, flipping as needed to brown them evenly, and then put them on a baking sheet and baked them at 250 for about 10 or so more minutes.  They finished nicely and freed me up a bit.  I'll make these again, and since they make a lot, you can easily freeze a batch.  Next time my kids can help! Thanks Linda for sharing a good old family recipie!

I just made them today and they were delicious.  I will keep this as one of my staple recipes.  I ended up with 22 muffins, which works nicely for me because it is better for Weight Watchers Points Plus.  I try to find recipes that I can use to make everything homemade and we love English muffins. I did use butter instead of shortening.  Next time I may try coconut oil and half bread flour, half white whole wheat, but they were delicious just as they were. My husband and I always need something filling that we can pull out for breakfast that we can carry in our hand.  These will work nicely with egg, ham and cheese.  I can wrap them and freeze them and then pull them out as we need them. So excited about these!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

These looked like english muffins on the outside, but the inside was just a regular bun texture. An english muffin should have lots of nooks and crannies. This was an ok bun recipe, but by no means is it even close to an english muffin.

Very nice - I took the advise of others & baked them 8 min a side at 375 - then finished them 2-3 min a side on a griddle set at low. Perfect!  Definitely do NOT handle the dough much after the first rising. Saving this recipe in my favorites - Thank you

These English muffins were awesome. I followed the directions exactly, except for letting my bread machine do the mixing for me. My machine isn't designed to hold that much dough, though, so I couldn't let it finish the complete dough cycle (it would have spilled all over the sides). 

When they first came off the griddle, these were warm and soft and delicious. My 5 year old loved them, but she said they tasted just like bread, so she didn't see what made them "English muffins," but after fork splitting and toasting them, we got that wonderful texture you expect from an English muffin. There were tons of nooks and crannies, but they didn't quite get to the size of what you might find in a Thomas's--next time I make them, I'll do it by hand and work at the texture, but there WILL be a next time, and another, and another....

This was my first attempt at making English muffins and they came out perfect. I did these in my bread machine and made some slight changes.  I put the warm milk, sugar, warm water, melted butter (instead of shortening)into my Bread Machine, then added all the flour, salt, yeast and added a 1/4 tsp baking powder, put it on the dough setting and let it do it's thing.  When it was finished punched it down rolled out to about 1/2 inch cut out with a 3 1/4" round cutter, placed on a parchment lined cookie sheet sprinkled with cornmeal covered and let rise for about 30-45 minutes.  I cooked mine in an electric fry pan set at 300 degree for about 8-10 minutes per side. They were great and I would have given them 5 stars but I feel they lack some flavor but they were still good toasted with butter.  I will be making these again but with different variations.  I will be trying my sourdough starter or my other thought would be using honey instead of the sugar and wheat berry flour in place of the regular flour.

What a very pleasant surprize. I made 1/2 the batch to see how they would turn out. Just perfect. I did not use any oil in in my pancake pan and they browned very evenly and no sticking. Thank you for a wonderful easy recipe.

Beat the batter until you are sure the gluten is developed.  This will make the larger air pockets.  Do not include fat in the recipe because this makes the bread soft.  If it is still too soft for you, use water instead of milk.  If it is not soft enough, add a tbs of fat.

These were so good.  I divided the dough into 18 balls and used my tortilla press (who said that it was a uni-tasker?) to press to 1/2 inch thick.  They turned out great.  The flavor is wonderful.  My 4 year old son loves them and asks for an egg, ham and cheese sandwich all the time now.

Real authentic English Muffines... at least they tasted like it... great recipe... the only thing I would change is when you "bake" the muffins in the skillet use low heat... mine got burnt on the outside before i realized it and turned it down and had to continuely flipping them creating a more dence muffin... other than that just be careful when transfering to the skillet so they stay risen nicely... try using a spatula... my family ate these up pretty fast... definately a keeper..

the first 2 times i tried this recipe they didn't turn out. they were heavy and there was no nice air bubbles that make english muffin so good..i have just made my 3rd batch and i think i have  figured it out.. my adjustment are also designed fordry air & high altitude baking ...#1 use bread flour not all purpose, #2 i use honey not sugar, #3 i cut the yeast by 1/4- 1/2 tsp use luke warm water to slow rise, #4 i kept my kitchen at 73 degrees F, #5 when you add shortening DO NOT MELT FIRST(put in with flour andmix well with beaters, #6 punch down half way thru first rise, #7 once you place on cookie sheet for last rise place in a plastic bag...#8 when cooking on a cast iron fry pan heat pan to med heat then turn down to just above low to get a full 15-20min cooking time without too much browning..they taste fabulous i can't stop eating them..!!

I love these muffins. I needed to turn down the heat on my griddle. keeping the muffins in a warm oven works well to continue cooking if after browning if they are not quite cooked.

I actually read the reviews prior to making these.  I did find that six cups flour would have been too much.  I used about 5 cups or a bit less.  I also substituted the white sugar with honey, and did half whole wheat flour and half white in an attempt to make them more healthy.  Cooking time was about 20 mins but I needed to turn them every five minutes or so to prevent burning.  I used a heavy frying pan; it worked great.   They're now in the freezer and look forward to popping one in the toaster for breakfast! :-)

These are 3 star becausee the way the recipe is written it won't work out so well. 6 C of flour is too much. I stopped at 5, since it's typical to stop short and add just as much as it takes to make the dough the right consistency... it was still too much and the dough was tough. Unless your kitchen is really warm 1/2 hour is NOT going to be enough time to get your final rise in. I think the reason this recipe is so highly rated is because homemade bread that is fresh is amazing, even if imperfect. I'm certain that when the original poster makes these they are amazing, it's just one of those recipes that needs to be written REALLY well and it isn't... even to an experienced baker like myself.

As suggested I used about 1/2 T extra sugar in the yeast water, less flour, and let them rise for 40 minutes, not 30.  Cooked on a cast iron griddle, medium heat, for HALF the stated amount of time on each side, and they still burned, though at least they were cooked through.  Also, using the tuna can to cut it out gives rather large english muffins.  Slight burn aside, after fork-splitting I did get nooks and crannies that looked like store bought!

Fantastic recipe! I just made some for my fiance and I for our breakfasts in the week, and WOW! They are fantastic. Nooks & Crannies, great flavor, it has everything! Original owner of this recipe, you have Mr. Thomas beat!   I changed the melted shortening for veg. oil/canola, and still turned out great. Also, these cooked up much faster than I expected with a gas range stove.

Great!  and easy.  I prepare the dough the night before and let it rise in the fridge.  Then proceed with the recipe.

This actually rates a 6.5 out of 5. As usual, it took two tries to get the fine details - but I'm a rookie. These are so much better than store bought. My notes: First off, add an additional 1/2 tsp of sugar to the yeast/warm water mix. All the difference in the world. Note 2: I used a heavy cast iron tortilla griddle (vs. aluminum pancake griddle) and only baked 5 at a time. Let the griddle warm under what I called med-low heat ("6" on my gas stove) for a full 10 minutes before starting. Then let them cook for 10 minutes a side - not 10 minutes, 1 second. (burned the first set...) Note 3: These go stale fast. I cook 5 at a time and wrapped the rest of the fully risen, uncooked ones in waxed paper and then in a plastic bag and stuck them in the fridge for up to 6 days. Still turned out great!! This one is an official keeper.

This was my first time making English Muffins and it certainly will not be my last using this recipe! They turned out perfect! At the suggestion of some others, I placed the cut dough on a greased cookie sheet to rise. To transfer the dough rounds to the hot griddle I dipped a metal spatula in flour and they slid right off. I halved the recipe which gave me eight 3 1/2" muffins. You may not need all of the flour as the recipe states, just enough to make a soft dough. I preheated my electric griddle to 225 degrees. It is amazing how high they rise after being placed on the griddle. I used a fork to cut through the muffins, giving the muffin the desired texture. This will be the perfect recipe for the hot summer months, fresh and homemade bread without heating up the oven!  I just had to give this recipe a try, and I am glad that I did.

TOP NOTCH IN MY BOOK!  These were easy to  make and very tasty!  I was worried about them rising good enough, but when they sat on the griddle for a minute they rose beautifully!  My husband loves!  I am making more for my parents who love english muffins.  Going to also try some wheat ones!  
I substituted 1 cup of the flour for wheat flour.  It came out delicious again!  This is incredible dough!  I can't quit making them.  I freeze them and have them handy when I want to take out just a few.  I give them away and people love them!

I've never had an English Muffin before, but I think I made this right - it's a tender, light type of roll. I didn't have a griddle so here's what I did; I preheated the oven to 450F, and warmed my dutch oven to medium heat (dutch ovens stay hotter longer so medium high would be too hot I think). I melted a small slice of butter before every other batch. Heat the muffins in the dutch oven 2 minutes each side till they have a nice color. After that I let them sit on a baking sheet until I had done all of them. This takes some time. Once they were all ready to go I baked them in the oven for 5 minutes on each side, making sure to rotate the pan so they got evenly cooked - most ovens are hotter in some places than others. That was it! They were good with Pineapple Lime jam from this site, and grape jelly. I toasted some and some not. They reheat well in the microwave for 15 sec. I found doing the step in the dutch oven makes that interesting texture on one side of the muffin. If you just bake them (which you can at 450F for 7 min each side) it doesn't look quite the same but tastes just as good.

I'm not an expert chef, and I hardly have the patience to watch dough raise... but, WOW! This recipe is amazing. Better than Thomas's or Bay's! This English muffin addict will not buy them in a store again.

very good recipe!!! i didnt get big nooks and crannies but these are sooo good! Some helpfull tips:  I use 5 cups of flour, but i guess it depends on where you live..  i let the dough rise 1 hour for each rise covered and close to the warm oven.  I used butter instead of shortening because im not sure where they sell shortening in chile.  the tricky part is transferring these to a skillet ( i used a large lightly greased cast iron skillet): you have to handle them the least possible for them not to deflate.. use a GREASED spatula so they dont stick to it. cook on very low temp. I flipped them about twice each side.  GREAT FOR A FIRST TIMER AT USING YEAST .. soo easy although if it werent for the girls at the exchange i wouldnt have been able to make these!

I can't believe I made beautiful English Muffins, but I did.  Although these take some time and the dough has to be handled carefully, they really aren't hard to make.  Mine didn't have as large nooks and crannies as the commercial ones, but they were big enough, and the taste and texture were right on.  They rise a lot on the second rising, and if I had known how much, I would have used a size smaller cutter.  I have really big muffins!  Just be very careful when you put the muffins on the griddle and when you turn them over, and you won't deflate them.

I have made these muffins over 100 times and they are just perfect for me and my family. I now make them using 3 cups of Whole Wheat flour and 3 cups of regular flour and I tell you they are just as delicious. They were a bit denser but they tasted just as fantastic as the others. I find it is a great way to include more whole grains into my kids meals.

Good!  I used half whole wheat flour, and cooked them in my electric skillet at 325.  Had to keep the lid on to keep the 10 minute time but well worth it!  The texture is similar to bagels, but it is still very good.  Thanks!

They turned out great!  I used the bread machine for kneading, though I'm not sure I'd do that again.  It struggled with all that flour.  I let it rise in the oven for an hour.  Then I skipped punching it down and just rolled it out.  I cut about 20 muffins.  I, again, let them rise in the oven for an hour.  Then, I baked them at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes.  They're very fluffy!!  I didn't get as many "nooks and crannies" as I'd hoped, but they did look more "holey" than a regular roll.  They tasted more yeasty than an English muffin, but still a little similar, which is fine with me, because I'm not a huge fan of English muffins, anyway.  I was making these for my husband.  He hasn't tried them, yet, but he approved of their appearance and saw that they were fluffy.  I'm sure I'll be making these again.

Absolutely delicious. My hubby even says they're the best english muffins he's ever had. The only thing is that 10 minutes on each side over medium heat on the griddle can be a bit much for the second batch as they started to burn. So I did a little less than 10 minutes on each side for the first batch and about 5 minutes on each side for the second batch. They are a bit denser than store bought, but we kind of like them that way. I might try kneading them a little less next time to make more air pockets. But we'll see. Either way they're great. I'll never buy store bought english muffins again. :)

My family LOVED this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  You just have to follow the recipe, where it says "Add salt and rest of flour, or enough to make a soft dough".  This amount will vary depending on where you live and the weather/humidity (I only needed 3.5 cups total flour).  I think next time I may try a pinch of salt.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I think these are superb! I used whole wheat flour and butter in place of the shortening the second time I made them and really loved that version too. For those not getting the nooks and crannies, it's all in the cutting. Don't slice through with a knife, instead, stick a fork in and out the side of the muffin all the way around, then gently pull the two halves apart - voila! Nooks and crannies! This will not taste like a store bought english muffin, and that is a good thing! It is much, much better. A bit more dense (just how I love them!) and with a much better flavor. These freeze beautifully also.

I went to go make this, thinking I had all the ingredients. The recipe ingredients list doesn't say cornmeal. The recipe barely mentions it untill step 3. I was very disappointed, but after getting over that fact & after reading other recipes & reviews, I still decided to try this recipes minus the cornmeal. I made it into a loaf & baked it in the oven, this tastes wonderful & so delicious! Almost exactly like store bought, maybe better I can hardly tell the difference, I'll never buy english muffins again! I have to give this 5 stars for flavor, with or with out the cornmeal.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I melted the shortening with the milk and half the sugar. Used the other sugar half in the warm water and yeast. Once the dough was mixed, I only kneaded it for about 5 minutes and let it rest for about 40 minutes. I skipped punching down the dough, placed the dough on a lightly floured surface, gently rolled out the dough and cut rounds out. Didn't want to waste the scraps so I shaped those into bagels and baked those off as well. I didn't pan fry them either since I don't have a griddle and was too lazy to pan bake in small batches. :-) Sprinkled cornmeal on a large baking tray, place cut biscuits on and more cornmeal on top, baked at 360 for 5 minutes then flipped and baked for another 5-7 minutes or until lightly brown on the bottom. Any longer and it'll get too dark/crispy when warming them up again. I like that though. They came out great! Hubby was impatiently waiting to have a fresh one with grape jelly! Thank you!

I loved them.  I'm living overseas, making it hard to find certain foods.  So, I gave it a try, and they are just like the ones I bought in the US.  Someone commented that it's much easier to bake them...I totally agree.  I baked half and fried half.  The baked ones turned out nice and it was a big time saver.  The fried ones were nice too, but didn't keep as well.  Thanks for the great recipe :)

Really delicious! I listened to other reviewers and let them rise for an hour the second time. I cut out 14 muffins, and had a lot of dough left over, so I made a loaf of English Muffin bread, it is great! I had to brown them on the stove and finish them in the oven, the outsides were browning before the insides were done. But very delicious!!

Miminal handling is key to getting a nice, fluffy muffin. That said, try to avoid doing what I did. Namely, placing the cut rounds of dough too close together for the 2nd rising. Mine grew together just enough so that I had to pull them apart to place them in the pan. Pulling caused some of the rounds of dough to lose a bit of air. (Live and learn.) Anyway, this is a great recipe, and I will definitely make it again.

Excellent muffins!

Lighter and more tender than store-bought (even though I used a sourdough starter w/ bread flour for about 1/2 of the total, rather than packaged yeast + AP flour), but still with the satisfying chew you want.

10 mins/side was a tad long on my griddle @ 300 degs. I'll cut back to 9 next time.

These English muffins are fun and easy to make. I no longer buy them at the store now that I know how. I use white whole wheat flour when I make them, plus, I often use buttermilk. I just like the tanginess it gives. The white whole wheat is mild, yet a lot healthier than refined white flour, and my kids love it. One of these days I'm going to experiment and make a sourdough version.

I never even got to the baking stage! I followed the recipe, and my dough was so stiff and impossible to work with! There was nothing that I could do to salvage it, I read reviews where people said they mixed more water in to compensate for over flouring, and that did nothing except make my dough a slippery mess. Very disappointed as I was looking forward to doing this today!

LindaPinda, you have a winner here. I thought I messed it up by using a KitchenAide, which beat the dough to death, and then over flouring, resorting to hand kneeding in more water.  But they were awesome.  I did bake each batch at 350 while the next batch was in skillet.  I do this simpely bc I hate if the center is ever undone.  Take the scraps after the muffins are cut out and fry them with some salt.  Pretzels for the cook.

Fantastic! After I went to the store to buy some English muffins and seen the price of them I decided to make my own. I think I messed up a little because I didn't have very many nooks and crannies, but I'll figure that out later. Maybe I kneaded to long? I did sub butter for the shortening. Family loved these. Thanks for the recipe.

I decided to make the dough in my bread machine since I thought it would rise better. The liquids went in first, followed by the flour mixture, with the yeast on top.

About 10 minutes before the dough was ready, I went into the kitchen to check it and it was SOOO big the top to the bread maker was being pushed open by the dough!

I tried to roll the dough, and then cut rounds, but that just wasn't working. I rolled it and used another reviewer's suggestion of using a Tupperware hamburg press piece as a cutter. It was perfect!

I heated the oven to 170, and shut it off. When my cutting was done, I put the (16) rounds on parchment paper on cookie sheets. After 30-40 minutes, I turned the oven on to 375, keeping the muffins in the oven. At 8-9 minutes, I carefully turned them over to bake for another 8 minutes. 

Next time I will roll the dough a bit flatter, but they were excellent!

Loved this recipe!  They were so good!  The taste is right on, even tho the texture is a bit different than the store bought ones.  I made mine in a skillet and both turned out great.  The ones in the oven I did at 375 for about 8 minutes on each side.  The only difference was that the ones in the skillet got more of a nice brown on the outside, the ones in the oven barely got any color on the outside.  But the taste was the same.

Really, really excellent recipe.  I used a 3" biscuit cutter and felt that they were a little bit small.  I also rolled them a little too thin... they were still great.  I'd recommend rolling them 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and use a larger cutter.

I have made these a few times now.  I'm lazy, so I use the dough cycle on my bread machine.  Also, I bake them for 10 min on each side at 350.  These turn out okay - they look like English muffins, but don't have the hole-y texture on the inside I like.  To help with this I decreased the flour to 5c and increased the yeast.  This certainly made them lighter and slightly more bubbly, but not like store-bought.  They freeze well.

Cooking these as I type. They came out wonderful!! I used margarine instead of shortening, baked them in the oven, and cut them with heart cookie cutters for Valentines Day. Next time I wont roll the dough so thin... I like my english muffins bigger.

Alright, but not amazing.  I don't know why in the world it says 6 cups of flour, I used about 4 and even then had a tough time kneading it.  Since they were only kind of like english muffins, the effort wasn't worth outcome.

These were surprisingly easy to make.  I enjoyed making them, and will definitely use this recipe again.  The only thing that didn't seem correct was the cooking time.  They did not take near as long to cook as the recipe stated.

I made these on Friday and now on Sunday I have to make more already!  I followed the directions to a T and they turned out great.  I do think using an electric griddle helped me since I'm not sure I'd get "medium heat" right on a stove but they were the perfect shade of light brown on both sides after ten minutes, not a touch of black.  I'm letting them rise a little longer this time just to see what happens, but all this talk of ovens and whatnot confuses me.  English muffins are cooked, not baked.  That's what makes them English muffins.

I'll start by saying, I've never made bread before, ever. I found this recipe after going to a bed and breakfast and having the best english muffins I've ever had - I knew I had to try and make them myself. I followed the recipe to a T and I was nothing but satisfied with my results. They are perfect to eat as is, to toast with eggs.... anything really! If you poke and "slice" the muffin with a fork instead of a knife you get perfect little nooks and crannies.  I will be making this again!

LOVED THESE. Very easy to make, the family loved them and ate them up instantly. I made them into small muffin like sizes. This was a mistake because they were then eaten just that much faster. I have a rule that if it is just as easy to make something as it is to buy it, you make it. At least I know what goes into them.

Yum! I used bread flour as another user suggested and also added a touch of honey for some sweetness. I had to leave my house during the first dough rise, so I threw the dough in the fridge and let it rise for about 7-8 hours (they would be perfect to start at night and finish in the morning!). I followed the recipe exactly after that, except that medium heat was much too high. I burned my first four muffins. I dropped the heat to low, and turned the muffins a few times while cooking. Came out beautifully! This was my first time making them and will make again :)

This recipe, as written, produced nice buns/rolls but resembled English muffins not one bit.  I thought it had way too much flour. It produced a stiff dough.  Since I make No-Knead artisan breads (very holey and chewy), I got to thinking that a more batter-like dough would produce a more commercial type English muffin.  My DH liked them anyway!

Three words...moist, chewy, delicious. No more hard dry english muffins for me. The only down side is that I am going to eat them all and have to spend the rest of the week at the gym! better hurry and put some of them in the freezer so I can pace myself.

These turned out terrific!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and kneaded heavily before allowing the dough to rise, but greased the dough and let it rise on a cutting board so I could handle it as little as possible after it rose.  They had excellent texture--delightful nooks and crannies.  Also, I added a bit of my sourdough starter because I love all things sourdough, and I used melted butter instead of melted shortening.  Thanks for sharing Linda!

GREAT tasting Engish muffins! My whole famile inhaled these. I did substitute lard for the shortening. And I added some of the sugar to the yeast/water mixture to better activate the yeast. I also used bread flour and didn't come near the 6 cups required in the recipe. I barley used 5 cups maybe even a little less.  I did find, too that I needed to fry these a little longer than stated in order to cook them all the way through. Thanks for the recipe! Sooooo much better than store bought!

These were very good!  I substituted 3 cups of whole wheat flour for half of the AP flour and added some vital wheat gluten.  Also, I had to use evaporated milk, because I was out of regular milk.  My muffins didn't have deep "nooks and crannies", but I suspect that's because I handled them too much between the second rise and cooking them.  I'm going to try the recipe again with all white flour and be very careful not to deflate the muffins while transferring them to the griddle.  Thanks for giving me yet another way to make something for pennies instead of buying it for dollars!

they were very good and much easier than I thought it would be.  I've never made bread or worked with yeast before so I was worried.  but they turned out good, just one thing.......I didn't get quite enough of the "nook and crannies" they call it.  Not sure what I did wrong, maybe didn't let the dough sit long enough???  I put it in a bowl and covered w/plastic wrap for about an hour, was this long enough?

great recipe- this is my first time making any bread related item with yeast. They came out great! I took others advice, lessened the flour to 4 1/2 C, placed on cookie sheet rather than parchment paper and used my griddle at about 275/300. I will definately be investing in a english muffin cutter as these are way better than store bought, plus no preservatives! thanks for the recipe!

I need to practice this recipe again due to many "distractions"(ages 3 and 1!).  These were still very delicious.   Throw some sugar into the yeast.  I suggest a LOW/medium temperature on the griddle.  I was happy to see them rise on the griddle a bit more.  After reading some reviews, I am going to use an electric skillet next time.

I made these for the second time and they turned out wonderful with some minor changes.  To the warm milk I added 1 1/2 T white sugar and 1 T honey and 1/4 butter for the shortening and stirred until melted and dissolved.  I added 1/2 T of white sugar to the yeast mixture.  I like to use kosher salt so I increased the salt to 1 1/2 t. I only used 4 1/2 cups of flour.  The first time I used a large mouth glass to cut the dough but they still turned out more like minis so this time I used a cleaned 28 oz. can. (like the size for canned tomatoes).  This made them the perfect size.  And I let them rise for 40 minutes before "baking".  Well they are picture perfect and when I fork split the first one my roommate and I both yelled "Nooks and Crannies!"  Even with the bigger cutter I still yielded 24 muffins.  I will be making these from now on, no more store bought.

I made this using the dough setting on my bread machine.  I scalded the milk and put it in the bread machine pan, added the butter, cold water to bring the temp down, sugar, yeast, flour and salt.  Then I let it process as usual.  I poured the dough onto cornmealed parchment paper, patted it down into a huge square.  I then cut it into 16 smaller squares using a pizza cutter.  I pushed the corners of each square into the centers and patted each into almost round and let it rise.  I cooked each muffin (tops first) on medium low on my electric griddle.  I had to do each side twice, so I may turn it up a little next time, but they are delicious.  Still no nooks and crannies, though.

These were absolutely delicious.  Even my mother, who has always hated the English muffins we bought in the store, loved these (she put butter and sprinkled onions over one still warm from the griddle-mmm.)  I wanted to make mine with half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour, but I wound up using three cups whole-wheat and only one-plus all-purpose, since I could tell while forming the dough that six cups were going to make the dough far too dense.  They were still wonderful, and they look beautiful!  Thanks for the recipe.

These are amazing!  I wasn't sure they were going to come out correctly at first, but once I got them cut out and they went through the second rise, they looked great!  I baked them in a size 10 black iron frying pan and they look as good as Thomas's.  I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings and for about 40 cent we have 6 gorgeous muffins for the morning which beats paying 3 dollars for a package.  I will be making these again!  :)

I used butter instead of shortening.  These are wonderful and pretty easy.  Now I'm spoiled and never want to buy store-bought commodity English muffins again.

Wonderful recipe!  I've used it several times, and my muffins turn out with the "nooks and crannies" we love.  This last time I substituted 1/2 cup sourdough starter for 1/2 of the milk, and they were even better.  Thanks for this recipe!

The flavor of these was great. I'm sad I didn't get any 'nooks & crannies' :( but my boyfriend wouldn't stop raving, so for that alone I will make them again. Thanks for an easy recipe!

Very nice recipe! Delicious with orange marmalade.I had never tried English muffins before, but had no problem following this recipe. A bit time consuming though, so I think I'll go back to my rolls. Because some of the reviewers in here mentioned that these muffins weren't very spongy, I simply increased the amount of yeast. The dough rose perfectly and the muffins came out spongy and light.

I made these on a spur of the moment eggs benedict morning - we had no milk so I substituted half and half. I did put the sugar in the water and a pinch of flour to get the yeast going.  The muffins turned out wonderful and made the eggs benedict.  I will make this again.

I altered this by changing the flour to 3 cups King Arthur's White Whole Wheat and 2 Cups Regular Flour (instead of 6 cups white flour).  The consistency was perfect; even my baby only left a few crumbs.  I had a few that I didn't feel were done enough, so I sliced them and put the middles face down in the pan on low heat for a few minutes which fixed the problem.  Great recipe.

We enjoyed this with Egg Salad English Muffins from this site. I added WW pastry flour to the recipe and used a total of 5 cups flour. This is a dough that requires a delicate touch and minimal handling. On my griddle, the cooking time was extended to at least double.

These were just "okay".  They look like English muffins, but like everyone else said, they have the texture of dinner rolls.  I was not that impressed.  I came out with 30 of these things, so they'll be eaten, but I feel funny eating them for breakfast since they don't really taste like English muffins.  There are no nooks and crannies.  They taste good, just not like English muffins.

Sorry but I think this recipe is overrated. I have to agree with those who thought these were not worth the time and effort. These English muffins are attractive and moist but they aren't as like as store bought muffins and they dry out really quickly.

I'm with the reviewer who said she'd buy from the store from now on.  These weren't bad, they looked like English muffins on the outside, but had the texture of a dinner roll.  Too much work to not have nooks and crannies.  sorry.

Very good. Lacked the "nooks and crannies" that I'm used to, but still yummy. I'll probably use this recipe instead of buying them at the store. Thanks!

These were tasty but NOT English Muffins. They are lacking the nook and cranny texture of a English muffin and are missing that almost sour dough taste they have. They are light and fluffy like a roll, so they aren't really filling like an English Muffin.
Look for a recipe that asks for less flour, the dough is suppose to be sticky and more on the liquid side than dough side. Good recipes sometimes ask for a long yeast start, like over night.

Amazing recipe. My kids loved it. Thx for the forks trick. Definitely put the muffins immediately in baking trays and let them rest for at least 30 minutes before baking. The first batch which I did not move rose very well but the next one did not rise as much because I had to move them.

I have been on a quest of sorts for a good English muffin recipe.  This is not it.  I tried it twice to be fair.  Added 1 tsp baking soda the second time to give some much needed help in the "nook and cranny" department.  But still, the taste, texture and chew reminded me more of white bread than a good English muffin.   Should make a decent hamburger bun for dinner tonight.  But as far as being my go-to  English muffin recipe, this is not it.  Time to move on.  
(So far....Alton Brown's recipe is my favorite.  I liked it best when I modified it with a little sourdough starter.)

It's a very good recipe . I baked with half the ingredients and I substituted vegetable oil for melted shortening and added 1/3 of the sugar to the warm water.Sugar helps the yeast to be activated better. I set my griddle temperature on 350°F. It gave me 8 fantastic english muffins. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a really good recipe! I was surprised I was actually able to make my own English muffins! Everything was a smooth process. The only issue I had was cooking the individual muffins on the griddle. I used a low heat and tried to cook it longer. The outside was perfect, but the inside was still a bit undone. I ended up slicing the muffins and baking them at 200 degrees for about 15 minutes. I was worried because them came out a little hard, but the next morning they ended up being perfectly soft! These are great for breakfast sandwiches.

The dough was so dry I struggled to incorporate all 6 cups and kneading was almost impossible it was heavy and hard, not a soft dough at all even after adding extra liquid. Really not impressed. Wouldn't recommend it.

I've made this recipe 2x and both times it came out great...only things I did different were:
I didn't have milk, so I used 1 cup of warm water mixed with the sugar & yeast to activate the yeast, then to the dry ingredients, I added 1/3 cup of powdered milk.... Also, When cooking them, I used my electric griddle at 275 deg, cooked each side for 5 minutes (until golden) then placed them on a cookie sheet in a 300 deg oven for 10 minutes...during that 10 minutes, I started the next batch of 6 on my griddle...timing all worked out perfect...and they came out REALLY REALLY GOOD....

Thanks for the great recipe~!

Very good! I wasn't 100% sure how they were going to turn out since the directions are a little sparse in spots, but they turned out perfectly fine. I let them rise for an hour each time, and didn't punch down the dough like suggested by another reviewer. I baked them in the oven for 8 minutes each side at 375 like suggested. Loved them! Ended up using close to 5 cups instead of 6 like listed and mine did turn out with nooks and crannies. Next time I'll try with 4 1/2 cups to see if that works. :)

I was really surprised how well these turned  out. I used bread flour, but found I only needed 4 1/4 cup to make a niice soft dough. In response to the reviewer who didn't feel these were true English muffins. I would like to beg to differ.  Mine had the correct texture and tasted better than the store bought ones. Thanks for the recipe Linda.

I used honey instead of sugar, butter intead of shortening, used only 5 cups of flour for a really soft dough, and when I kneaded the dough I sprinkled cornmeal in with the flour on the board - but these turned out to be as delectable as any english muffin I've ever had. Fork-splittable, toasted well, with all of the 'nooks and crannies', and excellent base for our own egg, bacon, and cheese sandwiches - or by themselves, with butter. The kids even eat them warm with peanut buter and jelly!

The recipe was very easy to follow and the resulting English muffins were absolutely delicious.  Puffy and riddled with dimples inside.  Eaten hot with butter and honey, well, the kids couldn't stop eating them.  After making this recipe we all decided there would be no more buying English muffins from the store!

DH and 4 yr old DS were very happy with these.  I made smaller muffins and the 3 of us ate 7 of them very quickly.  Fantastic when eaten warm with cinnamon honey butter.  Yum, a great treat this morning.

Delicious! I followed another reviewers advice and after initial rise I rolled the dough into a log and cut into 24 rounds. Then I placed them on a cookie sheet in a warm oven (my lowest oven setting is 170 so I let it cool off a little before setting the muffins in) to rise for 30 minutes. This person also suggested baking them at 375 for 5 minutes on each side which I did as well and they turned out awesome. My family enjoyed them and we froze whatever wasn't eaten the first day. They keep well in the freezer and retain that fresh flavor. Great recipe!! Will be making this again soon.

My dear LindaPinda, your recipe is a life-saver. My husband and I moved to Bolivia to retire, and as fabulous as this country is, alas, there are no English muffins. I made your recipe, completely unaltered, and the results were spectacular! Eggs Benedict, here we come! Thank you for sharing your timeless recipe.

This is an excellent no-oven recipe.  I made these English muffins twice.  The first time, most of them got slightly burnt because I cooked them on medium heat and I probably didn't allow sufficient time for the muffins to rise before putting them on the griddle.  When I cooked them again yesterday, the muffins were perfectly browned on low heat (10mins each side) and quite fluffy since I had allowed the dough to rise for 1hr before cutting circles and another hour after shaping them.  I also used flour bread instead of all purpose as someone else had suggested.

Perfect!!!!! Will NEVER buy an English muffin again! I will post pictures later. I made by hand, no mixer used to ensure fluffiness in the dough. They look identical to store bought english muffins but (especially according to my husband) they taste so much better. They don't have that funny after taste and are healthier for you too! As others stated to ensure the most "nooks and crannies", after punching down I tried not to handle and knead the dough too much. They are just really good. Definitely recommending to anyone willing to try. It's just like baking bread but a little more time consuming because you have to pan cook them and make sure they don't burn. EXCELLENT!

This is an outstanding recipe. I used a smaller can for baby English Muffins and stuffed them with bacon, eggs and cheese. I only fried them for a couple of minutes on each side and they raised up more, then I baked them in the oven for a couple of minutes. Thanks for the great Saturday morning breakfast!

These are awesome! And it didn't take that long to make them at all compared with some other yeast rising recipes like cinnamon rolls. I live in Greece where we can't buy English Muffins, so I'm really excited about this. I can tell I will be making these a lot! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I did mine in the bread maker, adding the ingredients as per bread maker instructions.  The first mix, the dough was not well blended, so I started the machine again.  The dough came out perfectly.  I then followed the rest of the instructions.

Able to mix and do the first rise completely in the breadmaker because the yeast amount is so low. These english muffins are great, we make them often and never scald the milk. I also make this in the kitchenaid and I never use cornmeal. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe 3 times each using the right amount of flour.  (even using a digital scale)  Each time the dough came out verystiff, did not rise well, and the muffins were dense.  I don't know if it was me or the recipe. The fourth time I used about half the flour. Much better! wetter dough causes the muffin to be more chewy with more of those yummy holes for the butter to go!

I thought this recipe was so yummy!!  Made just as listed, I think next time I will add 5 cups instead of 6.  I also baked them as others suggested at 350 for 9 minutes per side.  They are wonderful, thanks for posting this recipe.  I will make this over and over.  I don't know who said they weren't better than store bought.  This surpases store brands definetly!!!

Made my first batch today. They appeared to turn out well and my son said they tasted very good.  I cannot tell because I have a gluten intolerance and cannot eat regular bread - but they smelled and looked great.  Will definitely make them again for my family.

I am not sure what went wrong but my dough was very heavy and I could not add in the 6 cups, I only added about 4 1/2c.  They looked perfect when done and tasted good, but were very heavy and dense.  I do not think it was my yeast because I used the same yeast in another recipe right after and it turned out fine.

I loved them! Great taste. Better than store bought, but they turned out just a little compact. Read some great advice on that after I made the muffins, so I will continue trying. But they are really good either way!

These English muffins were O.K.  I think that I like the flavor and texture of the store bought ones better.  I don't think there was a problem with the recipe itself, it's just a personal preference :~)

Great recipe and great tips from others. I proofed my yeast with 1 T. of the sugar, and then add 1 T. to the milk, other than that I followed the directions. I did put my on the griddle and then put them in a 350 degree oven for 10-15 minutes. Another recipe I had called for that. Mine were quite puffy and delicious. I may try the suggestion of making a log and cutting them, so I don't waste any of the dough by using a cutter. I didn't have a large cutter so I used a wide-mouth canning jar ring. It is the right size and just a little bit thicker than 1/2 inch.

I recently moved from the states to Africa and have trouble finding things that compare so have started baking. These are by far the best I've attempted. Though I was in hurry tonight so I don't think I allowed them to raise long enough. Wouldn't change a thing about the recipe, I did also bake them for 5 minutes on 100 temp before cooking them in a skillet. I have no griddle so this worked well. Do watch the heat though and length to cook. I had to turn mine several times to get them perfectly brown. Yummy thank you so much!

I am giving this one 5 stars even though I won't make them again.  WHY?  Ease of making...and the flavor is wonderful.  This recipe, although very good, turned out a more "dinner roll" texture muffin.  Do not get me wong I do not need those "nooks & crannies" but I will have to pass on this one and keep looking.

Wow, these came out really nice and fluffy. I followed the recipe. I have a griddle that does not have the low, medium, or high setting but a temp, so I set it for 325 degrees, if you cook at a higher temp within 3 minutes it will start to burn. I cut mine a little bigger and thicker so that I could use them for sausage and egg breakfast sandwitches. I did have to cook them alittle longer total of 15 minutes on each side. Since mine are thicker the muffin itself tasted almost like a bagel. Also what I found is if you want the nooks and grannies do not slice it cut alittle than pull apart, this helps with look you are trying to achieve. Love it and so did the kids will use again and again thank you so much for sharing

I think the word I'm looking for is WOW! Not only are these a lot easier than you'd think, but even if you screw up and play with the dough too much after the first rise, they still come out tasting like australian toaster biscuits, which are amazing, but they do taste more like english muffins when toasted. I've made these 3 times now, and I have no idea how long they can last because they were always gone within 4 days. These things are awesome as little sandwiches, as a bread side for pasta, and even just with a little butter fresh out of the toaster. Or, better yet, fresh out of the oven. Be careful though, if you eat 3 or 4 as you're frying the rest, you will be more full than you think. Since, you know, you have to see if they came out right, and then see how a toasted one tastes, then maybe try one with some jam or honey, since you're waiting anyway, and they're just sitting there wafting their smells at you . . . LOL

Although the flavor is excellent,  the recipe yields muffins more like little breads.  I need a recipe that bakes up with the craggy consistency.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I used to mak homemade english muffins while we lived in Florida, but misplaced the recipe.  I agree that they are simpe to make and make a huge impression on those who would never attempt home baking.  My granddaughters will be so thrilled to help grandma make these from scratch. They are delightful and so easy.  Rdais013

I'm giving 4 stars because this is a first attempt at English Muffins, so I haven't enough experience to discredit the recipe.  It wasn't easy using a griddle, some got too dark and others didn't seem done in the middle.  If I try again, I think I'll use an electric griddle, hoping for a more consistent temperature.  Although it was an easy dough to work with, to cut out, etc., I think it was too dense, too much flour.

The flavor of these are good, but they did not rise.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I will try again and maybe next time they will be better.

Lovely english muffins, a little more dense than the commercial brands, but a much better taste.  I just added the yeast and sugar to the warm water, more to make sure my yeast bloomed and was still alive.  I also put them on a greased tray rather than the paper.  Other than that I did it as written

These turned out great..I was so intimidated..but they were really not that difficult to make. I did take SEVERAL suggestions, I put the muffins for the 2nd rise on lightly greased cookie sheets in an oven turned off, after preheating at lowest setting.  I grilled them on 300 degrees on my Cuisinart griddler.., when rolling out..I tried not to handle the dough very much and they came out perfect....when toasted they have lots of nooks and crannies, but are heartier than store bought.we love em!

I didn't successfully get the nooks and crannys; but I have not given up!  It tastes kind of like a bagel... but better.  I used my flat cast iron plate (the ones that take up 2 stove burners), but next time I think I'll try it in just my reg. cast iron skillet. Making 8 at a time (in attempts to save some time) turned out to be too much work.

Not my fav.  I followed the recipe exactly and they didn't have the bubbly texture typical of store bought english muffins.  The recipe also needed more salt.

When I tried baking these in the pan, I came out with hockey pucks...   My pan baking technique was poor perhaps?     At any rate, the next morning as I was considering whether or not to toss the remainder of the dough, (life happened as it sometimes does and the remaining dough was left under the towel on the table...yes, yes bacteria I know...but nobody but me is eating them, so eh, whatever)...as I was about to toss the dough, I stuck a couple of the rounds into the toaster oven...and they puffed up and were delicious!  Go figure...  VERY forgiving recipe apparently.  :)  The flavor was good, but not "wow" therefore 4 stars.  These have gotten such great reviews from others...I will try them again soon and see if they come out better.

These were terrific.  I made a few changes.  I used Becel instead of shortening to cut down on trans fats.  I also used 3 cups of all purpose whole wheat flour.  I used all purpose white flour for the remaining flour.  I only ended up using about 5 1/4 cups of flour in total.  My muffins took about 24 minutes to cook.  Twelve minutes per side on the griddle at about 300F.  All three of my kids loved them toasted with Becel.  I had mine toasted with strawberry cream cheese.  Very good.  The only one who did not care for them was my husband.  He didn't think they were sweet enough.

I hate to give this recipe such a low rating! It seems like everyone just loved them, but I made 2 batches, the second with about a half cup less flour, and they were so bland and the texture was just awful! Maybe I just did something wrong (both times), but I was so disappointed!!!

Wow, I can't believe I just made my own english muffins! They came out perfect and since I have been wanting these for sooo long I am thrilled with the results. I followed suggestions from others and used some tips and it gave me the confidence to go ahead and try. If you are wondering if it was difficult, No, it was simple. Was it worth the effort? Absolutly! Thanks for the recipe!

These were wonderful!  Now, I should start with the fact that I did have a brain fart moment where I accidentally only used 1/4 cup water and could not figure out why after 3 cups of flour it was so stiff, so stopped adding after flour after that.  I also didn't have cornmeal, so I used corn muffin mix and it tasted great.  My muffins had a hard time on the 2nd rise, so I stuck them on a cookie sheet and threw them in an oven, let it get to 100 degress, turned it off and allowed them to sit in there for an hour.  Muffins came out great and I was happy to see that my major mistake didn't ruin the whole batch.  Very shocked by how truly easy these were to make...

I thought these were delicious, but mine didn't have much in the way of "nooks and crannies". Other reviewers say that their's did, so I probably just need more practice. I was really excited to find the recipe and will probably keep making them till I've perfected it. I thought it was fun cooking bread on the stovetop, nice change of pace. Thanks for the recipe!

I had been in search of a soft english muffin serve as a base for crab benedict, my new favorite breakfast indulgence!   This recipe was it!  I love the dense texture of the biscuit, not like those sand paper versions at the store.  Yeah, these take some work but the results are so worth it!

To start off, these were delicious!  But like some other reviewers said, I didn't really get the "nooks and cranies" of store-bought english muffins.  Next time, I think I will try using bread flour instead of all-purpose, like another reviewer had said.

Great! The only change I made was using golden syrup instead of white sugar in my second batch. This made them exceptional! I suggest evryone who loved these as is try it with the syrup as you will be blown away!

I made a mistake and added too much flour and they were still awesome!

Yum!  As many reviewers mentioned, they don't taste like store bought muffins, but much better.  I followed the ideas of several reviewers and gently handled the dough after the first rising.  Next time though, I will (as some suggested) let them rise longer on their second rise.  1/2 hour isn't suffient. They are a little time consuming to make, but make a large batch.

I read a lot of the other reviews to get the best tips and tricks I could find then decided to make this along with an eggs benidict recipe... it was a lot of work but it turned out SO good that I havn't stopped making them yet. Pinch of sugar and flour in the yeast, log cut instead of busicut cutter to handle the dough less and let it rise for a final hour. I also had a table-top roast/bake pan that I use for the holiday turkey that worked BEAUTIFULLY!!!

Really good recipe. Delicious and simple. My husband recommended I make these three times a week! A little bit dense, but I will be using this from now on. It was wonderful toasted with jam.

I loved this recipe. It turned out fantastic. I used 3 tbs. of honey instead of sugar and used 3 cups of regular flour, 3 cups whole wheat flour. They were great for breakfast and snacks.

These were great - turned out wonderfully, AND they had nooks and cranny's!!  LOL  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer to be careful not to knead after the initial rise.  I also used a wide mouth mason jar to cut them, it was perfect.  I will most definately be making these again, no more store bought preservative filled english muffins for us!

These were verrrry easy to make. Just the rise time is time consuming. I found that after they were cut into english muffins they didn't rise much. I put them on a cookie sheet in the oven on 200 deg. for 20 min. That did the trick! I cooked them on my non-stick griddle with spray and they took about 6-7 min/side at 325/deg. Like someone else said next time I'm going to try a 4" cutter and as alot of people have mentioned, they don't have nooks and crannies but do has a very strong english muffin taste. Would have given 5 stars if there were nooks and crannies.

Outside looks similar to a standard English muffin, but texture closer to a dinner roll.  Time-consuming to make, but very good.

This recipe is (for me) an example of a case where store-bought is actually better.  These muffins were very dense and left me wishing I was eating the lighter, store bought version.  The whole cooking process was more fun and interesting than the eating for me.

Like what other reviewers have said, not really English muffins, but delicious muffins nonetheless.
I did the first rise in the fridge overnight. Then rolled, cut, cornmealed the rounds. While doing that, I turned on the oven to warm. Turned the oven off. Then put the rounds on the silpat on the oven for 30 min for the second rise. After the 30 min were up and the rounds almost doubled in size, I turned the oven onto 375 ( no preheat) and let them bake for 18 min without flipping. Beautiful tan, fluffy muffins.

I ended up only using 4 cups of bread flour, and I cut the sugar back by half a tablespoon. They turned out great. A little time consuming, but the recipe makes enough that I shouldn't have to make them that frequently.

Made the muffins just like the recipe states, they turned out beautifully! My only advice is don't worry about what size the dough rolls out to, just roll it to the correct thickness!

I added wheat germ and wheat bran to this recipe, but just a little so it wouldn't get too dry (about 1/4 c). On my gas stove I had to cook them on low heat, as the trial one burnt on medium heat. Overall I found this an easy recipe to make. They are delicious, thank you Linda for this recipe! I am happy I can now make these instead of buying them every week!

I wanted to find an english muffin recipe that I could use for my breakfast sandwich maker.  This was definitely the ticket.  Better than any english muffin at the store.  No, they don't have the large distinctive holes that are typical of the "real" english muffins, but they sure do taste good.  I won't ever buy another one at the store.

I made this recipe just like it says and everybody in my family , including me, thinks they are delicious.  They don't have the sourdough thing going for them, but they are so good it doesn't matter.

The above was written approx 1 year ago.  Since then I've made the recipe tons of times and they just don't taste as good as the first couple of batches.  I follow the recipe the exact same each time.  I use the exact same brand ingredients, utensils, everything the same and the flavor just isn't there like it was.  I don't know what has happened.

I did make some modifications and my English Muffins came out nice and chewy just how I like them.  I halved the recipe and replaced 1/2 cup of the all purpose flour with farina (because I saw this as an ingredient in a famous brand of English Muffin and I was trying to replicate it lol) and I still didn't use all of the remaining 2 1/2 cups of flour.  I used a cast iron skillet on low heat covered with aluminum foil to cook the muffins.  They turned out wonderful.  Taste just like an English Muffin to me and almost similar to the brand I love!

This was my first time making English muffins and this was a great recipe to start with. Unfortunately, I didn't see other users remarks that the stovetop temperature was too high so my muffins cooked rather quickly, but they still tasted great!

Made these last night and they turned out perfect!I followed some readers advice and cooked over low heat, on a cast-iron skillet, for approximately 5 minutes each side.  I replaced the sugar with brown sugar, the shortening by avocado oil and the milk by water (made it vegan) and used bread flour instead of all purpose. The interior consistency came out perfect as well. I believe the key is to let it cool down for 10 minutes or more before eating - as hard as it is to wait - so it finishes the process of cooking correctly.

Thank you for the recipe :)

Knocking off one star for the texture.  They were relatively easy to make in the bread machine, and had good flavor, which was not so different than regular yeast bread.  However, the texture doesn't come close to english muffins.  They turned out like dinner rolls or biscuits but with a nice crunchy crust.  These will do, but I'm going to keep looking for that perfect english muffin texture.

These are great for camping if you can keep your griddle from getting too hot. I only make half the recipe and add 1/4-1/2 tsp baking soda,it makes more bubbles in the middle.

Hi ya'all, These muffins are pretty good tasting, but like others, I do wish they had bigger nooks and crannies. Can we double or triple the yeast? Would that help?  By the way, they do make great little minny pizzas. lightly toast the muffins on top only, then add toppings and bake, very tasty.

These came out great. I used whole wheat flour and real vegetable shortening.I proofed the yeast and let the dough rise for about 2 hours before punching down and rolling out the dough. My griddle has a temperature dial, I put it on 325 and cooked on each side for a little under 10 minutes.I am going to try using maple sugar or honey instead of sugar next time.

These taste good, but they don't taste like any English muffin I've ever had. They're like soft white bread with a crunchy top and bottom. I'm going to try another recipe hoping to get the nooks and crannies inside.

These were very tasty, I will make again.  As per other reviewers, 6 cups was way too much flour, which is the only reason it didn't get a higher rating from me.  I found letting them rise the last time on the grill before cooking helped.

They turned out great, I'll never buy them from a shop again ! Although I only got 10 x 3.5 inch muffins out of the batch of dough, so I'll double the quantities next time.

This recipe is easy and fun and works!!  I followed Denisem's tip of making a muffin log and baking them and it worked a treat!  I proofed the muffins 3 times before I cut them for a final proofing and baking.  I did 10 mins on each side at 375 and they were light and fluffy with a wonderful outer crust.  Definately not your store bought muffins and sooo much tastier!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I looked at many of the English Muffin recipes on the net, but decided to use this one because it was so easy.  I used my bread machine to get to dough stage, kneaded it out with a little bit of flour (I used half white and half whole wheat for the recipe) and let it rise.  Then I rolled it into a log and cut off about 20 pieces, shaped into a ball, and flattened with my hand.  I put these on a corn meal coated tray and let them rise again.  Then I very carefully lifted them onto the griddle (stove top - no electric grill here) and cooked them.  They were fantastic and will never buy another package of store-type.  I made a small loaf of bread with the same batch, so it really stretched my recipe and didn't have tooooo many muffins.

Yep they very good, I don't use yeast so instead of (yeast) I used baking powder with vinegar and it works.

My first try on these worked okay, but not super.  My husband liked them a lot and gives them a 5 star rating.  They didn't really have nooks and crannies, but the taste was great. I think I rolled them out too much. I'll try barely rolling them next time.

These need to be rolled out much thinner, maybe half the thickness stated. They were burning on the outside and undercooked inside.

This is my first time making English Muffins - wow! Great, easy recipe! After reading all the tips (thanks to everyone that posts) I have some on a cornmeal dusted baking sheet ready for the oven. With the 'scraps' left after cutting the muffins - I let them rise and 'cooked' them in a saute pan. YUM. Am munching on them now with butter... also going to try with jam, Nutella.... thanks for another fab recipe and esp to all those who use and review them!! ps I'm going to freeze some for my sister's visit next weekend! Will let you know how they fare.

My family and I LOVE this english muffin recipe.  I make my own jam and my family just adores dipping these english muffins hot out of the oven right into the jam.  Not only were they delicious but the recipe was incredibly simple.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I rolled this out and cooked half in the oven and half on the stove in my cast iron pan. The ones in the oven turned out fine but had no color so I browned them quickly in the cast iron pan. Either way was fine. I rolled the dough a little to thin though. I think next time I would roll it out 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch. Overall they tasted fine.

Came out perfect 1st time. I let rise 1 hr the second rise. Cooked in a pan with a good amount of butter very slowly. Tons of nooks. Great for a beginner to yeast. Also used corn masa. (I was out of corn meal)

I made half this recipe for breakfast this morning.  I thought I'd be smart and make the dough last night and put it in the refrig to rise overnight.  I don't think I'd do it that way again.  It took too long to get to room temp after I got up (8AM). We didn't get to have our ham, cheese and egg breakfast sandwiches until 11. From scratch, I could have done that in the morning.  I only used 2 1/2 C. flour.  It's all I could knead in by hand and then the dough was starting to break.  I think the finished product was really fine. The taste was good. I used my cast iron skillet to do 4 at a time.  I got 7 really nice muffins (plus 2 more with the rerolled dough) using the ring from a wide mouth canning jar (no biscuit cutter).  It really wasn't sharp enough to make a nice clean cut, but it worked OK. Fork split, I think it had enough 'nooks and crannies'. I'll probably only make this recipe again when I want to impress someone with "Yes, I made the English muffins myself!" ;-) or when we run out of bread, like today. I am glad I tried the recipe.  Now...on to pita bread!

I MADE THESE MUFFINS JUST LIKE THE RECIPE CALLED FOR AND WERE OK BUT FOUND THE INSIDE MORE LIKE BAGELS TEXTURE ESPECIALLY WHEN I CUT THEM OPEN THE NEXT DAY. ALSO I HAD TROUBLE WITH THE TEMPERATURE. ALTHOUGH I USED THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE, THEY STILL GOT BROWN TOO QUICKLY. BESIDES, WHEN YOU CUT THEM JUST MADE, THEY CUT OK USING JUST A FORK TO OPEN THEM, BUT WHEN I TRIED TO CUT THEM THE DAY AFTER, THEY WERE TOO HARD AND HAD TO USE A KNIFE SO THE HOLES AND CRANNYS OF THE REGULAR ENGLISH MUFFINS WERE LOST.

Its not often I say this, in fact I have never said it before but I PREFER STORE BROUGHT.  These were just ok, nothing special in fact I found them too bland.  Glad I made them and they did look very good, but the taste was not there for me.  Don't think I will bother to make again.  Thank you for sharing anyway.

These were ok but nothing special,certainly not like the English muffins I've bought in the store.With frying these I found they were very doughy inside.If I make these again I'll bake them instead.

These turned out really good, which surprises me because I made a couple of errors. I misread the instruction and activated the yeast in only 1/4 c. water. Then, when adding the extra flour the dough became so dry (I only added 1.25 cups) that I began kneading and forgot to add the salt! So I kneaded in the salt and said, "Que sera, que sera." Well the dough rose just fine and I continued on with the instruction. I only got 11 muffins but hey, I'm happy with that. I'll be trying this recipe again. And maybe it's better that I not try cooking at 6 in the morning!

These were great and so super easy to make.  I handled them very carefully--and didn't "punch" down the dough, just pressed it flat.  And mine didn't deflate after flipping either.  I didn't flip them until they stiffened--meaning when I tried to flip them if they bent a little then I waited til they were completely stiff to flip.  Great recipe, love them!

Like other reviewers, I didn't really get many nooks and crannies.  It may well be my fault, as I originally tried to shape the dough into a log then cut.  Not sure why I did that, as I've never been good at getting it to work for me that way, so I started over and did the method of cutting out with a biscuit cutter.  I had to work the dough a lot as a result though.  They rose pretty high, about as high as you'd expect rolls to rise, but I thought that they'd deflate like another reviewer mentioned when I flipped them.  They didn't, though, so some of them were pretty high muffins.  They toast up pretty well, reminiscent of what I think English muffins should be.  It may be me, may be the recipe that it didn't work exactly, but it was a fun recipe to try.  Lots of work, although this recipe makes a lot.  I got about 21 out of the whole batch so am going to freeze most of them.   Bf's expression watching me fry the things was priceless.  He was quite astonished they are fried and couldn't get over it.  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not sold yet, but darn close!  I've never attempted a recipe like this, and have worked with yeast breads only a couple times, many years ago.  Creating this recipe was more of a lesson for me (I was simultaneously making the Cinnabon recipe on the other side of the kitchen).  I thought the english muffin recipe, or atleast the yeast, failed me miserably.  The first rising just wasn't happening, but I figured I'd roll 'em and go with the flow.  I used a 3 inch biscuit cutter, and placed my rounds as directed.  They didn't rise either.  I was JUST about to launch them into the wastebasket and thought, oh heck, give it a shot.  I did ONE in a cast iron skillet, ever so slightly greased, and it puffed up!!  How cute!  My dough n stuff may be off, but they sure do look pretty!!  After it cooled, I split it in half and put it in the toaster oven broiler, oh, and it was soooo nice when it came out.  The others are on the griddle as I type this...   Even botching this recipe, they still come out lovely.  I will make again, learning from my 'mistakes' (once I figure out what I did wrong?)   A 4-inch cutter would be better.  And, um, unfortunately, I am SO stuffed from the cinnabon I ate, that I could only take one bite of the english muffin.  I'm sure it will taste MUCH better in the morning.

My husbands' exact words were as follows:  "Ok, I like English Muffins.....  I've never liked them before; really don't like the store bought ones..."  (And this is said as he'd buttering and jamming his third one); "But these..." (Pauses for a bite)... "Are realy nice!"   And he's right; they are!  My stepson's eating one wihtout anything else on it at all on right now; couldn't wait past getting it out of the toaster; and he's still scoffing it down!   They are better if you insert a fork along the side of them and pull it apart that way; but my hubby can't wait that long; cuts it open; and it fine that way; too.  I'd read through some of the reveiws; almost all of them were raving; so I'd doubled the recipe; and though there are time consuming cooking; I am really glad I did.     With the dough that was left over after cutting out most of the first rounds; I'd had a bit left over (I'd run out of space on my baking paper sheet); so I'd sprinkled raisins on it; as well as some cinnamon sugar; and placed the scraps from cutting the rest out on top; pressed it in lightly; then rolled it out again; then cut that as I had to the regular English muffins.  Reason being; I know it was going to be a bit denser the second roll out; I figured it'd be good to have something to break it up some; add a bit of flavour without needing to put any jam or whatever on it; and it turned out quite nicely; too; not as 'airy', obviolusly; but still; would try it again; or possibly just make a bat

I got tired of the not so natural ingredients in the store bought English Muffins, so I decided to try to make my own. This is a wonderful recipe!! So easy. This is only my second time making a yeast bread, and they came out great! I'm still in the process of cooking them but I just had to try one toasted with jam and butter... WOW! Awesome. There is no reason I'll have to buy them from the store ever again! Make sure to split them with a fork :)

Just tried this for the first time and won't be going back to the store to buy them ever again.  I cut the recipe down to 6 muffins since it's just me.  I was worried they weren't rising, but wow!  They look good and taste wonderful.  I didn't get all the nooks and crannies, but they taste great!

So good!  It was pretty dry the day I made mine and I only used about 5 1/2 cups of flour.  I probably should have tried to get more in because they deflated a little when I picked them up to put them in the pan.  But they were still delicious.    One important note: don't toss out the scraps when you're done cutting out the rounds.  Cook them up first and eat them as snacks while you cook up the big ones.  :)

Thanks LindaPinda! I live in Brazil, where it's difficult to find English Muffins, and since my last visit to the US I'd been dying to eat some. Mine came out perfect, just like they should. One comment for those who've been having trouble: It helps a lot if you already know how to bake bread, and the ammount of flour can change. I used only 5 1/2 cups of flour. This was the correct quantity with the kind of flour I had at hand. The dough has to be soft, but just dry enough not to stick. Good luck to all!

good. a bit to tough and they didn't get the rise I really wanted... maybe I rolled them too thin. I'll make it again and keep them thicker when rolling out next time.

All in all, it is quite tasty.  But it is sweeter and more dense than what I have come to expect in English muffins.  I will be trying it again though.

These are great, even with a few unplanned modifications. I broke the cardinal rule of not making sure I had all the ingredients before starting these and had to improvise a bit. I didn't have shortening so I used butter and I didn't end up having enough white flour so I used half wheat. They still came out great. Thanks for this recipe!

These were awesome.  My husband came home after I made these and was looking for the bag they came.  He said they looked just like english muffins - LOL.  Missing a few nooks and crannies - I may have overworked a little on the second rise.  But overall they were great.

This recipe was right on! I just started cooking my own english muffins about 2 months ago.(I am a lifetime baker, though) My old recipe had a great taste, but they were so "poofy" that when you picked them up to cook, they just deflated and resulted in a flat muffin. I tried your recipe and realized I was using too much yeast. Thank You

This is a great recipe.  It is Christmas day and I forgot to get English Muffins for our traditional Breakfast.  We made these and I was surprised at how easy they were to make and how good they were.  
My only complaint was that I burned a couple on the griddle because medium temp is way too hot and 10 min. is way too long a time on my stove.  Yummy!

Made this recipe exactly as written. Nice flavor. A little more dense than i was hoping. I didn't get the nooks and crannies as others did, but they look and taste good.

Great taste.  Mine turned out a little dense though.  It was difficult to get them to the pan with out deflating after rising.  I guess I needed to use more corn meal.

These were wonderful! My family loved them!  When I made them they did not have the same texture as store bought, more of a bagel texture.  They taste a little like rolls; it might not be what you're expecting, but boy are they good!!  Like another member suggested, I cooked these on low heat for eight minutes on each side and they browned perfectly!  I would also suggest eating these while warm.  I would highly recommend this recipe, and I'll look forward to making this many more times.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've been making breads since 1983 - Linda I have to say your recipe for English Muffins are the best - way to go.  I did make a slight change - I took 1/3rd cup of water from the one cup and 1/8 tsp of sugar to activate the yeast(rapid rise) - no other changes were made.  Thanks - Roy from the Philippines

I give it 4 because my kiddos liked 'em.  I agree with the others though, store bought are better (no nooks and crannies).  Very simple recipe!!!  Might use again if I am in a pinch and need some and can't run to the store. Thanx!!

I like this recipe. I didn't have griddle so I baked it. It was good baked. I read the reviews and many people said it was too dense. They were right.

This makes a great breakfast sandwich bread but does not have those nooks and crannies that most people love. I made sure to handle the dough as little as possible and still didn't get the nooks and crannies. But still tasty!

These were just ok for me. I thought they were a little on the bland side and not really better than the ones in the store. My husband said they kind of tasted like a cross between a biscuit and an english muffin. I probably won't make them again just because it's really not worth the effort. If I did make them again, I would definitely add more than 1 t of salt.

I live in Sweden and I miss english muffins from the US soooooo much.  This recipe had the nooks and crannies and were unbelievable.  My wife was shocked at how good they were.  I had a little problem with the corn four but it is really unnecessary.  AWESOME

These took me awhile and made a heck of a mess in my tiny, well-populated kitchen, but the end result was excellent. I used whole-wheat flour, mmm.

These are good but like other reviewers have mentioned, they are missing the nook and cranny features of store bought english muffins.  If you split them with two forks, they have a few nooks!  I also found I had to cook them over medium low heat in order to cook them through without burning  I added some wheat germ and some oats for extra nutrition along with raisins and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  They are tasty and my kids love them!

Mine look a little crazy. I made the muffins a little too large and had to cook them a bit longer. I "protected" them with extra corn meal on the skillet. Very fun project with such great flavor...perfect for hearty eggs benedict!

They were ok.  Pretty easy to make, and I liked the texture the the corn meal gave to them.  However, next time I will make them bigger, using something larger than a standard muffin cutter- they did not expand horizontally as much as I expected, so I nearly ended up with mini-muffins. VERY dense. Also, I had to cook them substantially longer for the inside to cook.  I might cook them partly in the oven next time, and partly on a griddle to get the right texture.  Family didn't gobble them up, which is how I gauge recipes, lol.  Give them a try if you're an english muffin fan.

Easy and they taste wonderful.  I make them and freeze some already split so when I want them I can just pop it in the toaster frozen.  
I'm not a sugar lover so I only put half what was in the recipe and it still turned out great.  
I made them for my family when they visited and now they request them for every visit.

I don’t know why everyone can’t seem to incorporate everything, I incorporated everything with my kitchenaid and a dough hook. I used all of the flour and found myself adding a few extra tablespoons as well. They’re tender and soft, as I didn’t punch down the dough too much and let it proof for about an hour or hour and a half. I prefer them without crumbs so I just dusted very lightly with flour. Nice amount of ridges inside for butter and jam to find its way into!

This is it.  Look no further -  I followed the ingredients as presented; the modification was to the flour and the method to cook to muffins.  Recommend sifting the salt and the first 3 cups of flour together, mixing the dough until sticky.  At that point, pour the dough onto a lightly floured surface, slowly adding the next cup of flour, 1/2 c. at a time, incorporating by gentle kneading.  I used 4 1/2 - 5 cups flour, total.  Place dough in greased bowl, allowing the dough to rise until double.  COOKING:  Recommend using a cast-iron skillet, first heating the skillet to high, then dropping heat to low, giving the skillet time to adjust to the source heat, I waited 5 min.  After skillet is adjusted to heat, THEN grease the skillet; using butter - lightly grease the skillet.  After gently place the dough on the skillet, be certain to check the bottom of the muffin after 5-min, adjusting cooking time. Wipe the skillet clean between each batches - repeating the light buttering of the skillet for each batch.   This is a process, but the patience pays off.  Thank you for this recipe!

Made it twice now.  Second time I split the dough and put  cranberries. In half and choc chips in other half.  Amazing!  I take them to work for my breakfast.  Really good!

First time making these, they came out great!  I substituted the shortening for unsalted butter, its all I had at the time. Either way, it was a big hit with my sister and I. Will make again.

I love theses! I had to substitute butter for shortening, and I used bread flour rather than AP. I followed another rater's advice and added 1 TBSP salt, not tsp. Only needed about 5 cups of flour. This made the silkiest, most perfect dough I've ever touched.

Mine didn't rise much on the griddle, but turned out OK. Half I popped in the oven at 350, they rose beautifully. Bottom line, they all taste great!

I cut out 3" circles, but l will make them 4" next time. Thanks for this recipe and all the rater's feedback.

Wish I’d read the reviews and tips first. Will try some of the alternatives next time. Wanted to try this for years and am glad I did. Would have liked more specifics (had to google what “medium” heat meant on an electric griddle) (300)and could not understand the rationale for holding finished muffins until all were done.But am happy with my first effort. Made 1.75 dozen. 
My add: an all metal hair pick to fork-split after cooling.

Ok so I changed this recipe a little due to I didn’t have bread flour, I replace it with self rising flour and instead of milk I replaced it with buttermilk/sour milk. I did everything that was called except when the first rise was over I placed the dough on a lightly floured board and rolled it out to 1/2” thick while using a biscuit cutter. I placed them onto a cutting board generously topped with cornmeal (so I just needed to slide them on to a hot griddle), and finished up just like it is written.

Excellent recipe. Made this twice. Once, as written and the second time with all milk for the liquid. If you follow the original, it is definitely the classic English muffin with the crusty exterior and craggy interior. With all milk, it’s a longer rising time and the crumb is velvety and rich. I like this recipe either what

Heat greased griddle. Cook muffins on griddle about 10 minutes on each side on medium heat. Keep baked muffins in a warm oven until all have been cooked. Allow to cool and place in plastic bags for storage. To use, split and toast. Great with orange butter, or cream cheese and jam.

Yummm. This was so good. Used a sponge starter and added 1/2 tsp baking soda to the flour.  Accidentally forgot to do the first rise. Turned my stove burner to the lowest setting. Cooked 9 minutes per side. Lots of nooks and cranies when I opened with a fork. I didn't even bother toasting it. Delish. Will definitely do again.

Have made the several times. Using a KitchenAid mixer and the exact ingredients listed they come out perfectly every time. Use a griddle set at 300 degrees. No fuss at all. Easiest recipe. Love it!

The recipe is very easy to follow. I did make a few changes, after reading the reviews  - I added one egg, replaced the shortening with melted butter, added a 1/2 tsp more salt and instead of sugar I used 3 Tbs of Honey. they turned out pretty good.

I made this using Almond milk and an organic palm oil to keep it dairy free. Over all it was a winner. When I try it again I will increase salt. My stove top  cooks quickly- so muffins were finished after 4 minutes per side, medium low heat.

Great recipe! I used all organic ingredients and cooked them in a large cast iron pan with coconut oil.  So yummy and much better than store bought chemical laden muffins.  I will be making these regularly.

easy to make and tasty. Not what you want to make if you're expecting to have what's at the grocery store. Didn't have corn meal to top so I used oat flour, and it worked great!

They didn't turn out airy and pitted like the others that I buy. The taste is great . They also cooked a lot faster then  the recipe said. I will try this recipe one more time before I try another one.

I was really hoping these would work. After reading many reveiws I felt confident in its ability to be like a store bought EM. I followed the recipe exactly. While they’re tasty, just like a bun, they’re basically just pan fried buns :( Don’t have that holey middle.

They definitely had the flavor that I'm used to but the were somewhat dense with no nooks and crannies. I did use a fork to split them but without the n&o's they are not the same. Anyone have any suggestions on how to get the  n&o's back in these muffins. Thanks in advance.

I made these for hubby using 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour and butter flavored shortening. These were GREAT!
I am not a fan of whole wheat and yet I found the taste and texture to be wonderful.
Rather than rolling and cutting, I weighed out the dough and portioned into 12 equal round balls then used the rolling pin to level each piece and patted it into my round cutter (to keep the size consistent). The result was perfectly formed round muffins.

Yes I  made this recipe for English Muffins. The last time Imade English muffins I used a recipe from a bread machine cookbook from Alaska. They turned out great. I used Whole-wheat flour. These I made with white flour and used Fleischmann’s Instant yeast and fast-acting. I like ,one of other respondents, didn’t get nooks and crannies. I haven’t read all respondents information and I also haven’t toasted them. They were very soft and supple muffins. Very tasty. I had to adjust temperature of gas stove, too hot to cook for 10 minutes on each side. Cooked for 3/1/2 to 4 minutes on each side. Browned too fast so turned stove to medium low. Also cleaned skillet before each batch because corn meal started to burn. Going to check other cookbook to see differences of recipes and also read all respondents ideas. But overall, they were very good and husband loved them.

Recipe was great, had several friends and relative requesting this recipe.   Cook time on my cast iron grill was 3-5 min. depending on size.  Next time I will make them larger in diameter to better fit our egg sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe Linda.

Ok, like several others have said, these are definitely not like the English muffins you'd buy in the store. I followed the directions explicitly and I had no nooks and crannies. I also opened them with a fork but still no nooks and crannies. They are also very dense. Not a bad thing at all unless you think you are replicating store bought English muffins. That being said, they taste delicious. I'm not sure how to replicate store bought English muffins (if you do, I'd love to hear how) but if that's what you're looking for, this isn't it.

Tasty and easy. They need a little more salt, in my opinion.  I subbed coconut oil for the shortening because that is what I had and it worked fine.

Very nice dough. Easy to work with. Makes a large batch. Only thing I would change is to double the salt. They were a little bland but because I used them for eggs Benedict they worked well.  Made  12 English muffins and the rest I raised in a cast iron pan and made a boule.

I really loved the flavor. I need to make these a few more times and perfect them though. I may have over kneaded or not let them rise enough. The nooks and crannies weren't big enough for me.

Mine do not have many nooks and crannies, but maybe I needed to let them rise for longer. Also, I've only cut into one, but I feel it is a bit doughy in the middle, even after griddle cooking for 12+ minutes each side. Will definitely try again, though, as they have potential.
Oh, I saw someone said they would add more salt next time - I'd do that too.

I used this recipe probably ten times in the last few months. My son in law is addicted to them, especially with my homemade jam. Anyway, it is the easiest and quickest recipe I’ve come across. The time spent is in the cooking, and that is no big deal at all. They come out so good, we hardly ever toast them. Also, they freeze really well. I’d recommend this to anyone who likes English muffins, you’ll grow to love them.

These turned out great on my first try!  I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough rise for a long time, per review recommendations, in order to get nooks and crannies.  I cooked them over low heat for 8-10 min each.  Next time I will increase the salt as that's the one thing I felt was underused - the bread's consistency is great, it's just a little bland without some flavored spread.  But still amazing - thanks for the recipe!

These are very tasty but they DON’T have the “nooks and crannies” one expects from English muffins. I made a loaf from the dough left over after I’d cut out the rounds and it’s good too. Both are dense and beautiful and form a nice crisp crust when toasted but really are nothing more than a heavy toasty white bread.

I love, love, love this recipe! You get a hearty English muffin just the way they are supposed to be! Nooks and crannies are simply air pockets which means less actual muffin! I personally want something to bite into besides air. Next time I make them I will roll them out thinner and cut them larger. Thank you for sharing!!!!

The recipe tasted like an English muffin but it didn't have much flavor. I think next time we will make it with more butter.

I thought it was good. However I am doing chemo right now and nothing taste right. I cooked on griddle but still doughy in middle so I put in oven for 10 minutes. Made like 22 muffins. I wrapped  in waxpaper and put in freezer.   Considering my circumstances I thought it was good. Made egg mcmuffins with pepper jack cheese. Very good. I would make again when it's another rainy day.

Made these for the first time yesterday to celebrate the Harry & Meghan royal wedding today. Because this recipe yielded 36 muffins and I wanted to save time, I mistakenly followed suggestions that baking them was an option, over the stovetop  cast-iron griddle method. I baked half in a 375 degree oven, 8 minutes per side and used the stove top griddle on medium heat (as per the recipe) for 5 minutes per side. Hands down, the stove top version yielded a more traditional  looking and tasting, soft, chewy muffin [with lots of nooks and crannies]!! The oven baked version had, as some Allrecipes members have commented, a more dinner-roll like looking and tasting result... My advise is to follow the recipe and other suggestions not to knead or roll out the air bubbles formed by the yeast rising AND PLEASE take the time and effort to stick to the stovetop griddle cooking method. It is totally worth it! Had muffins with raspberry jam and butter for tea yesterday and served them as part or our 'full English' breakfast this morning as we watched the wedding on TV this morning. Rave reviews but only the oven baked ones remain. Have to make another batch, this time, sticking to the stove top prep, AS PER THE RECIPE??

Fantastic recipe!!! I would recommend that the first rise be about 45 minutes at 22°C. I also used the dough hook on our kitchenaid to complete mixing and kneed .... call it “cheating” but it worked :)  I also flipped them often, yet gently, while on the greased pan, kept constant heat throughout. Will make again for sure!

These were awesome!! My father in law said they are way better than store bought! My husband and kids loved them=) I didn't have a lot of nooks and crannies but I think I added too much flour on accident. They still tasted wonderful but next time I will add a bit more salt for flavor. So good! This is a keeper for me:)

I made no changes except put heat on my griddle to 2 and a half as I have an electric stove and it was too hot and burned them at "medium". DELICIOUS and I'm making eggs benedict tomorrow morning.

I tried this recipe looking for one I could use to make appetizers with.  I followed the recipe to the point of cutting and cooking except added a 1/2 teaspoon more salt.  I placed the risen dough between 2 sheets of parchment and rolled out.  Instead of regular sized muffins I used a small tomato paste can with both ends cut out to make miniature muffins.  Then baked them on parchment with cornmeal under and over in 375 oven for 8 minutes each side.   Next time will add more salt but texture was perfect for toasting and topping with our famous crab muffin recipe!

I made these the other night to have them for breakfast (Eggs Benedict-this site). They were easy to make and I tried one after frying it up and had to stop myself from eating another. Very fluffy and delicious. Thank you so much for sharing!

Used the suggestions and turned out into a long roll and sliced to size, then let them rise for 30 minutes. I  cook  them on a buttered griddle so I could get an idea of how brown they were getting. I used 8 min per side and that worked great.  Super tasting with good texture and "nooks and crannies" that others mentioned.

I'm not sure how this worked out for others, but my dough is totally overdried. I don't think there was enough liquid for the 6 cups of flour, so my dough came out hard, dry, and cracking into tiny pieces. Not stretch at all. I followed the instructions and followed commenters' advice about using different floor types. I did 4 cops bread for and 2 cups self rising. I'm trying to salvage it by incorporating more milk but it isn't looking good. I'm a new baker and if anyone has ideas on what went wrong, please let me know!

I think this recipe needs tweaking.  The yeast will add the taste and rise of the muffin, but you need to add baking soda to the flour before you add the flour to the wet ingredients to get those nooks and crannies like an English muffin

First time making them. I was impressed (with myself mostly) ?? but also with the recipe. My neighbor and I have an unspoken baking challenge and he made his first and gave me the recipe. They were ok, but we both thought they were more biscuit like more than a muffin. I tried this recipe and it was right on the dot with how a muffin should be. I have to wait until tomorrow before I find out what he thinks but I think I nailed it.  The biggest challenge was cooking them but slow and low heat is what I did to cook them.

This is an excellent recipe.  My whole family enjoyed them.  My only question is why does the recipe say to keep the first batch warm in the oven while the rest are cooking, only to then say let them all cool?

They were really good, but were more like rolls... no nooks and crannies. I baked them on the griddle and to my knowledge I followed the recipe, however, I couldn't find a rise time for the first rise so I just let it double in size which only took about 30-40 minutes. I expect to have to let it rise longer so I will try that next time. I'm guessing that's why they were so roll-like. I will be making them again.

Wow these are the best!  The only recommendation I have is if you have a ceramic cooktop cook then on low around 2 because they brown too fast on medium heat setting.  They are well worth the effort!

These were very good as is, but I decided to play with it to make it a little more healthy. I used Fresh ground wheat berries turned into flour, added Flax meal, chia seeds as well as raw honey. The people who have tried it said that they were the BEST thing that they had ever eaten. The texture, the taste over the top. Now this is my go to recipe for English Muffins.

This an interesting bread experiment!  At first I thought I blew it as the dough was very tough but research and time covered on a warm stove top  led to soft fluffy  dough.  I had to adjust the cooking  times as I went as The first few english muffins werent quite done so the following batches were flipped on the griddle every three minutes for 10 to 12 minutes and then were cooked on 350 in the oven  for about 10.  thank you for sharing!

I watched the video and there is NOWAY there is anywhere near six cups of flour being used, at most three cups, probably less. I use the same equipment as in the video, making bread every two days and no way there is 6 cups of flour !

the ingredients are not proportioned right---6 cups of flour is way too much--it should be 4-4/12 cups---and increase the salt to 2 teaspoons

the crumb or the texture is wrong---the little holes in the finished product are not there ---it is more like dense bread shaped into English muffins----more water (in this case, less flour) will give the dough the moisture it needs to form the small pockets of air that give English muffins their texture

These English muffins are great! Both my husband and I love them. The people that said they werd just a biscuit probably made them too thick. I followed the recipe to a T, but next time, and there will be a next time, I will make them a little bigger. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! The taste is just the same as I've got in USA, I'm from Brazil :) I guess even better then Thoma's one. I had to grill for 2 min than cooked for 10 min in a oven in a 175 degrees heat. I didn't boil the milk and didn't need all the flour, it left almost one cup of flour. The water I warm up for 40 sec on a microwave. For the shortening I used butter.  Usei facilitador de pão. Perfect! Love it! Thanks!!! I just can't stop eating!

I didn't like these. I did the recipe exactly, handled the dough as little as possible, and still found them to be too dense for my tastes. They also were a bit flavorless.

I made this on a lark, and my family loved it. I did not get the "nooks and crannies" that I hoped for, and the texture was more like stiff bread than like a muffin. BUT the flavor was delicious, and my family loved it. That is a true sign, because when I make bread that my family doesn't love, the loaf sits there for a while. These muffins were gone after two days. I will make it again and experiment with the length of the rise, etc. to see if I can get a holier texture.

Turned out great. I didn't handle it much after 1st rise (don't break air bubbles) Use spatula to transfer to pan (after 2nd rise) or they deflate. I didn't use grease when I cooked them &I just a few min each side over low/ med heat. Also substituted coconut oil for shortening

Honestly better than I expected since it was the first time making it... Had to read reviews first... I had self rising corn meal, so there was a good bit of flour consistency to work with. I learned that to keep them nice and plump after rolling and cutting, to lay down a good dusting of the cornmeal and allow enough space between the muffins for the second rising. Or else they flatten out before making it to the griddle if you have to pull them apart from the other ones. .
Not many nooks and crannies to boast about.  Will definitely make again with the Kiddo.

These came out REALLY good. I ended up not needing all the flour, probably used about 5 cups total. I think the key to the 'nooks and crannies' thing is to handle the dough very lightly after the first rise, then when you move them to cook them, be very careful not to 'pop' them and deflate all the air bubbles. I lined cookie sheets with parchment, sprinkled then with cornmeal, then rose and baked them on those sheets, rather than trying to move them to a griddle. 375° for 8 minutes, flip and do another 8 minutes. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Sooo yummy! English muffins aren't sold where I live so it's such a nice treat to eat them again! These far surpass the store-bought kind. Be sure to knead the dough really well the first time and leave it the second time, as everyone suggested. I would also recommend waiting longer than the suggested time for maximum fluffiness! Be sure to cook them slowly over low heat too...cooking it on the pan gives it a nice crunch on the outside. Will definitely be making these again!

Made the recipe and it used a full cup less of the flour than noted.  The outcome was really good - I didn't get the texture of a store bought English muffin but the shape/taste was good and the kids loved them.

These were not the English Muffins I was expecting.  They were denser and not as airy as I had hoped.  Perhaps I overkneaded the dough, or did not allow the second rise to go long enough -- 1/2 hour was pretty short.  I might try them again,  but I was disappointed with this effort.

I think this was good. I plan to try it again because I think I can do a better job. But they turned out good and my family liked them.  To me they were a little too heavy, but I'm giving 5 stars because I blame that on myself. I think I over kneaded the dough.

This was my first attempt at English Muffins. I own a bakery and have a good amount of experience with cakes, muffins, cookies and the like but not so much in yeast breads. 
I followed the directions.. Got a very nice rise out of the dough. I gently punched it down and then very carefully rolled it out to 1/2inch. I was extremely careful not to overwork the dough. I got 18 muffins out of the recipe. 
They were OK. The flavour was good. I had added 2t of salt and was happy I had because they were just salty enough, could have maybe used a fullTablespoon of salt actually. 
I was somewhat disappointed with the crumb. I was hoping for something loftier with more cragginess to it. It was light enough in texture but too uniform. I want open tunnelling for butter to run through-Like Thomas. And I'd like there to be a bit more resistance when you bite into it. So for me this was an interesting start on the quest to find the perfect English Muffin recipe.

This was an okay recipe. It is a bit too dense and the muffins are not stable enough and "loose air" when transferring to cooking pan. I will keep looking but this is fine.

I liked the dough to work with after letting it rise.  Some recipes the dough is real sticky and this was not like that at all.  I saw reviews about putting in the oven or cooking in the pan.  I did both to test and if you like your muffins a bit browner try putting in the pan first and then in the oven to finish.  The picture that is shown is how they looked when I took them out of oven. I was not sure what type of oil to use.  Sometimes that can make a difference with the taste.  I used vegetable oil to brown in the pan and it was good.  I would recommend not getting the pan too hot or you may get smoke from the corn meal that is dusted over the dough.  Light and fluffy.  Thanks for the recipe

If I made this again I would make them thinner than I made mine. Mine were kinda thick and that was a bit of a mistake. But they are yummy and this is an easy quick way to make bread for breakfast!

I have to point out, and I'm English so I should know, that the person who said these aren't English muffins is mistaken. The food they describe (slightly chewy with larger holes) would be for crumpets.

I have made these several times and tried different techniques per other reviewers comments.  My husband loves these and asks that I no longer purchase the ready made.  The muffins do have a different texture baked versus grilled.  I prefer grilled.  Others substitute bread flour, but I recommend using all-purpose as stated in the recipe.

Great recipe!  I followed all the steps as exact using 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  They turned out nice.  Put them in the toaster for a little extra crispness.  Prick open with a fork once finished frying to keep the nooks & crannies.

Very good! My son and I just made these and we quickly gobbled up about 4 of them. We tried 3 different cooking methods and here's what we found...griddle cooking them yielded the most authentic looking English muffin, baking them  (to me) had the best texture, but they did puff up a bit and the 3rd method we tried was one I got from another website where you bake them but place a sheet pan on top to prevent the doming that occurs during baking.....don't do that...they spread out and are flat dense nasty little things. If looks are important, griddle them, just be sure you set it to LOW they take awhile to cook through with this method and they will start to get quite dark. If you don't mind a slightly puffier muffin,  simply bake them flipping once halfway through.

A bit difficult. Used bread flour. I've yet to master using yeast, even with a thermometer. I don't know why. They were good, though. I will at some point make them again when the kitchen is a bit warmer. Slow to rise. ( groan)

Other reviews are right, way too much flour.  That being said these were pretty good, especially toasted.  I'd go with about 4 1/2 cups flour and butter instead of shortening.  They rose well and browned very quickly in my cast iron pan, nowhere near the time given in the recipe.  I think I'll try a more batter based recipe in the future.

Yes these sre true englishmuffins and s fantastic recipe. I've seen posts saying this is not an English muffin. I'm thinking your comparing it to store bought muffins which is much like comparing a true waffle to a store bought eggo. If you want em to taste like store bought then best thing is to buy them in a store.

great recipe! I actually halved the amount of ingredients and made 6 instead of 18. It worked out well.

Some suggestions for people who said that the muffins came out too dense: I used a wooden spoon to mix everything together, and once the dough came together, i stopped adding flour. Then turned the dough out onto a floured surface and finished kneading the rest by hand. Add enough flour for the dough to stick to itself and not your hand but don't add more. (In total, i think i only used 1 3/4 cups of flour out of 3). 

Soft and sticky dough results in a muffin that's lighter.

Once it finished rising the first time, i punched it down and turned it out. And rather than rolling it out and cutting it with a cutter I cut it into 6 pieces and shaped them into balls.

Excellent recipe. I made these this morning for my family and we have decided no more store bought muffins. Due to the altitude where we live, we only needed 5 cups of flour and the yield was 20 muffins. I may have to add a bit more yeast and sugar to the recipe for our area, but that is the only tweaks I think I'll need to try. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I'm a novice and had a hard time. The recipe could be more learner-friendly if it had a few tips for beginners:
1) This recipe is very bland! That's probably why you chose english muffins, but if not, try doubling the salt or adding raisins.
2) You don't need to use absolutely all of the flour. Add the last three cups of flour a little at a time, and stop when it has a hard time integrating all the flour.
3) Knead the dough until it's smooth. If you're kneading by hand, your arms should be tired, and you may need to take a break partway through to rest. Knead for at least ten minutes.
4) The first rise should be long! Not sure why they specify the duration of the second rise but not the first. 45 minutes to an hour should work. Keep an eye on it though, it should double in size, but not more. If it rises too much the first time your dough may lose its ability to hold air pockets and your second rise will fall flat.
5) Be careful with the dough after the second rise. Handle it as little as possible to avoid deflating it, which causes your nooks and crannies to fill in.
6) Be careful not to burn the tops on the stove. It should only be a golden brown, if it gets dark brown the tops will harden. Keep it a shade lighter than you would shoot for when you put store-bought english muffins in a toaster.
7) To split them, take a fork and poke holes all the way around the edges. Using a knife will damage the nooks and crannies.

Turned out great. I rolled the dough in a rectangle and cut into 18 squares. So much easier, no refilling the dough.

Great recipe! I have substituted all purpose flour to unbleached bakers bread flour , also I only used 4 cups of flour 
instead of 6, which gave a soft dough. I make a sourdough starter the night before which gives added flavour.
They are perfect every time.

Absolutely wonderful! I'll never buy store bought again.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wouldn't use a cookie cutter again. I would rather shape them by hand, as they were too difficult to handle when I used the cookie cutter. They are delicious, though, and toast up nicely! Fantastic consistency, and much more tasty than the store bought!

Great recipe!! The dough was an absolute delight to work with! Although, 6 cups might be a little too much... You know you've made a good english muffin when you finally open it and there's no excess dough falling off... just nooks and crannies... but these were wonderful anyway.. thanks!!!

I tried this recipe because it seemed a little easier than some others I have made, while quite tasty, I think  these are more like buns and less like classic english muffins.

I failed to get real "nooks and crannies." I don't know why.  Will try a different recipe next time, but I'm not giving this recipe a poor rating because it could've been my technique, temp, yeast, etc.

Awesome recipe!! Made it twice and is delish and super easy! I simplify steps: pour luke warm liquids with the sugar and the yeast in the bowl of the stand mixer, add 5 cups of flour and the salt over it, start mixing with the hook and add the shortening, check how much of the 6th. cup of flour the dough would need. Will make it again and again... Thanks

I love this recipe. The English muffins practically melt in your mouth right out of the frying pan. I won't be buying store bought English muffins any time soon. 


The first time I tried it, I read the recipe wrong and I added all the flour at once.  They turned out dense but they still tasted good. 

The second time I tried this recipe they turned out amazing. I did make some changes to the recipe. 
2.	In a large bowl, combine the milk, yeast mixture, shortening, salt and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Dump dough onto well-floured counter, knead dough and add rest of flour as kneading, or enough to make soft dough. Place in greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 1.5 hours.
3.	Sprinkle cornmeal onto a cookie set lined with parchment paper and set the rounds on this. Dust tops of muffins with cornmeal.
4.	Put cookie sheet into oven and set oven to its lowest temperature (mine 150). When the oven is heated up fully turn the oven off. Let the muffins rise in the oven for 45 minutes. Do not cover them.
5.	Take the cookie sheet out of the oven and preheat oven to 400. NOTE: Do not touch the muffins at this point or they won't have nooks and crannies. Once heated, cook the muffins for 5 minutes.
6.	Dipped a corner of a piece of paper towel in vegetable oil and grease the frying pan with it. Using the dry portion of the paper towel wipe all the oil off NOTE: This step is optional but it will help make the crust on the muffins have an even brown coloring.
7.	Heat greased griddle to

Not a bad recipe. Texture was pretty close to what i'd expect, though my first and second batches were monstrosities. I don't work with yeast doughs enough to know what I'm doing and may've let the 2nd rise go on too long to be good for the recipe. Also bit bland. I think increasing to 1.5 teaspoons is probably even conservative.

These english muffins are fabulous.  You won't get all the nooks and crannies of store bought muffins, and they are more dense than store bought, but they taste so much better.  The second time I made these I used lots of butter while frying them on the griddle -- they tasted better that way.  I recommend freezing them -- mine got moldy after a few days even though they were stored in an airtight tupperware container.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated... I may try it again. They looked great but were more like a biscuit-dense. They doubled in size after an hour of rising so I assumed they were ready to put on the griddle. I may let them rise longer & give it one more shot. The flavor was lacking salt. I read a review to add 1/2 tsp extra salt. I will be doing that next time in hopes of better flavor.

Wow! This was my first time making these.  Very easy to do.  The only change I made was butter instead of shortening, only because I didn't have any shortening.  VERY YUMMY!! Will be adding these to a regular rotation!!

Great recipe! This was my first time making English muffins, and this recipe was a perfect way to start.  They were crisp and light, and not dry at all.  The only thing I changed was to cook them a few minutes longer on each side just to make sure they were fully done inside.  Definitely making these again!

One of my favorite recipes! I make a huge batch of these and then freeze them for easy breakfasts or sandwiches during the week.  I have one of those griddles that you can plug in and so I am able to cook about 10 muffins at a time. It's important to let them cool completely on a rack otherwise they get soggy.

I do think these were tasty, if a bit dense, however, they do not taste like an English Muffin. They looked perfect, just like you'd expect. However, it tasted more like a biscuit.  They weren't bad, just not what I was expecting.  Also, they didn't cook up completely on the griddle for me, I had to finish them in the oven so as not to burn the outsides.

Made these twice now and they're awesome to stash in the freezer until you want them!!  Fantastic for homemade Eggs Benedict.  I fried them in a big cast iron skillet and they came out fabulous.  The texure was, in fact, as another reviewer stated, more like a bagel, but didn't have that "hockey puck" texure a bagel has.  It is VERY different from a store-bought english muffin, but I like knowing that there are only simple ingredients in my food and I'm not eating process plastic...lol.  Thanks LindaPinda.

when I made them the first time I rolled it out to thin so I wasn't able to cut them. I made them today and made sure to leave them thick,and I let them rise extra longer the second rise time. they came out wonderful they have some nooks and crannies and it has a wonderful taste. I doubt I would buy any from the store unless I was in a bind.

They are pretty, but not fluffy or airy.  Mine were much more dense than what looks like the picture.  Tasted more like homemade bread in English muffin shapes.  Also allow yourself some time.  You are really confined during the last half.

I am in China and cannot buy english muffins. This recipe saved my life because I can make my wife breakfast sandwiches again! Came out perfect with all the warm nooks and crannies. I backed the heat down a bit. If you question your stove like I do, start low on the first one and bring the heat up on the next.

I have tried this recipe 3 times now.  I like the flavor and texture very much.  My problem is cooking them.  On medium heat they burn before the time is up, and if I turn the heat down they don't get done in the inside.  My last batch was over done, and hard on the outsides!  Help!

This is so easy and taste great.  Forgot to add sugar and did so after I had already kneaded bread and still came out good.  Freezing some and I'll see how they do.

I would like to rate 3.5, but there is no option. Although, they did turn out ok, it definitely could have used another tsp of salt because they taste, well, tasteless. I have to say (sigh) I really do prefer store-bought. But since I live in Spain, this is the best I can get I suppose. Either way, it's much more convenient to freeze and remove 1 of these English muffins than it is to thaw an individual slice of homemade bread. So I do appreciate that convenience.

These English muffins are so tasty! They are a bit more like a dinner roll, but by using a little less flour than is called for they can be the perfect substitute for store-bought English muffins!

So good! I substituted half the flour with whole wheat, and they still came out light and airy. All three of my kids loved them. I was thinking that 18 of them would last a while, but I'm thinking they won't. No problem though, the recipe is pretty easy.

Very good--very similar to store bought but better! When I sent my mom a picture she jokingly asked if i had opened a bag of Thomas' and put them on a pan! Fun to make, and great way to save money.

Good recipe, but I would cook it at a lower temp for less time. I did have to make some substitutions, but it still turned out well. First time I've made them at home, and I'm pretty satisfied.

The ones you buy are too small for me, so I used a 4" cutter and got 14 muffins. They turned out great. Note: I AM NOT A COOK, but I do breakfast well.

Loved this recipe!  I followed the temperature recommendations from another reviewer for the milk and water, and it worked out great.  I did not have bread flour, so I used all-purpose.  The muffins were very tasty, not as salty as the commercial ones.  Next time I will try the bread flour to get them a bit lighter and with more nooks and crannies!  A simple and fun recipe, I highly recommend it!

Wow! I just want to say thank you for this recipe! I dont eat sugar and i cant buy english muffins at the store that dont have sugar. so i modified your recipe by using honey instead of sugar and butter instead of shortening and white whole wheat flour, and I am also new to baking.. These were incredible! thank you for this idea and making it easy enough for a newbie to make!

No idea what I did that might have gone wrong, but they didn't rise at all.  I tried it with wheat so I am aware the texture will be different, but yikes!!!  The yeast seemed fine too so I have to cook them yet, but I can tell it won't do well...

These were excellent. I also baked them at 375 degrees for 8 minutes and then turned them over and baked for another 8 minutes. I then put them on the griddle for a minute or so on each side to brown them a little more.

Almost a success, I kneaded the dough a little too much, and could have maybe used a little less flour, but I know next time they will be perfect, they were about 4.5 stars this time! I will definitely keep this recipe around!

Awesome flavour and texture, kids love em! I usually make this substituting sunflower oil for the shortening and as I am mildly allergic to cows milk I use soya milk instead. I do use butter and milk from time to time and that extra bit of richness does add to the flavour...

These English muffins turned out wonderful.  The only reason it didn't rate the 5 stars is because I altered the cooking method slightly.  To prevent over browning of the muffins, I recommend starting with the stove top cooking until you get a light golden color on each side.  Once you are done with putting color on them, finish them off in the oven at 350 for 5-10 minutes or until the rest of the muffin turn off white.  I just felt doing all the cooking on the stove top resulted in muffins with over cooked edges.

Really good with a nice consistency.  I split my dough into two halves.  The first I did exactly as written.  They came out a little flat but I think I may have rolled the dough a little thinner than I should have.  For the second I went with a cinnamon raisin variety... added a few dashes of cinnamon, some sugar and about a 1/2 cup of raisins.  The flavor was GREAT!    With the raisin ones I also tried doing a "pre-bake" -- I was in a time crunch.  They ended up a lot fluffier than the ones that went straight to the griddle. About 12 min at 300.  Just enough for the outside to cook but the inside to still be soft.

These were so easy to make.  The cooking was a little time consuming but other than that it was quick and simple.  Everyone in my family thinks they taste great and they look perfect.  I cooked mine on an electric skillet at 275 that I had very lightly rubbed in butter before heating it.  There weren't big air pockets but it was definitely a bubbly muffin and not too dense... I didn't roll mine, just patted it down with my hands, so that might help some of the people saying it was like a bagel.

Incredible! I will never buy store english muffins again. They're so easy and tasty. Very chewy, and a thousand times better than any I've had before. My family ate all of them over the course of a weekend, so I know they're worth the time it takes to make them.

I am never going to buy muffins again. I eat them too fast to buy them anyways. They look just like the ones in the store, but taste so much better. A batch a week should do me for a while considering a batch is about the same cost as 4 store muffins give or take.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I will be making my husbands muffins from scratch from now on.

I need to give these another tries.  I made the muffins a little small and I don't think I let them rise enough before cooking them.  Everyone says that they are the way English muffins are supposed to be, except they are kind of small!  Next time I'm going to try feeding the yeast a little sugar and then let it sit the 10 minutes.

These were good, but hard to make.  I think I'll stick to buying them at the store.

My family absolutely loved these.  Hubby won't let me buy from the store anymore.

Good but they lack the pockets of air that some people LOVE in their english muffins.

these are pretty good.  i might make them again, although it might just be easier to buy them.

These were good.  They would be better if they did have the nooks and crannies in them.  I took some of the suggestions and I put have of the english muffins in the oven at 200 degrees to rise and the others I left out like normal.  I found that the ones I put in the oven did rise faster, but the ones I left out still rose.  They just didn't rise as fast.  I did not notice any other changes.  Next time I won't bother putting them in the oven.

I forgot to buy English muffins at the store, so I thought I'd make my own. Wow. Absolutely delicious! I'll probably still keep a pack of store-boughts in the freezer for when I'm feeling lazy, but I know I'll be making these on a regular basis. Thanks so much, Linda!

These were easy to make and were very fun to eat. I am going to experiment a little and see if I can give them a more open texture- mine had a very fine texture.
