I do not have a bread machine but it still turned out perfectly. It's a very moist, tasty bread. All it requires to omit the machine is putting the dry ingredients together, including the dates (I used dried and pitted rather than fresh), and then adding the water/oil/honey/yeast mixture (after the yeast has been activated) to it. I kneaded it for about 10 minutes and then let it rise twice for about an hour each time in our microwave with a cup of boiling water beside it to help it rise. Baked it at 350 for ~35 minutes or so. Great bread! I'll make another batch soon!

I make this bread at least once a week, it's a good source of fibre so you can pretend it's healthy if you leave out the nuts.  It's highly sweet, so watch out if you haven't got a sweet tooth.  The recipe is easily adapted to incorporate other dried fruit such as pears or figs.  If you want to be able to find any chunks of date in the bread I'd recommend ignoring the beeps and adding the fruit only about two minutes before the end of the kneeding, otherwise the blade tends to just smooth them into the bread.

Amazing.  I added a full cup of chopped up dates right at the beginning so the kidlets wouldn't see "things" in their bread.  Turned out amazing tasted great lightly toasted with peanut butter.

This recipe is fabulous! I don't change a thing. I buy a big box of dates and bake several loaves at once to slice up and freeze. It's great toasted with a little butter.

Very good flavor and just the right amount of sweetness.  I'll make this bread again, but next time I'll add just a little more salt.  I made this in a bread maker on the dough setting adding the dates & almonds after about 27 minutes, but I rolled the dough out and placed it in a loaf pan for the second rise.  It only took 23-25 minutes to bake to a golden brown at 350Â°.

This bread rose very well, considering that it's got wheat flour and oatmeal. I really like the sort of fluffy texture of the crumb too. It's also got just a hint of sweetness to it.

We loved this bread.  I did use raisins and sunflower seeds for the fruit and nuts and it was lovely.  Thanks for the post.

This bread is wonderful! The first time I tried it I made it exactly as written. It was awesome. I have made it several times now and I have tweaked it just a little. I replaced the veggie oil with coconut oil, golden raisins instead of dates and used 1 cup of whole wheat and 1 1/4 cup bread flour. I added vanilla, maple extract and cinnamon. My husband and I like it better this way. BTW, if you heat a thickly sliced piece of this bread, slather it with softened butter and top it with turbinado sugar, then it is absolutely divine! Unfortunately, this decreases the health benefits of the bread. Still, it's much healthier than eating a donut or a frosting-topped piece of cake.

I have had this recipe saved forever and I finally made it. It is delicious. Moist, hearty, faintly sweet and so easy with the bread machine! I left my almond a little on the bigger side of chopped and I get a nice crunch every now and then. It's lovely.

The bread turned out well.  I could not find the almonds in the pantry so I substituted walnuts, worked well.  I made this bread in the bread-maker expecting it to be a bit dense  which I thought was OK for a fruit bread.  In fact the bread rose so much that the fruit and nuts were a bit sparse.  Next time I will add more, but I know that there is some balance here and more fruit may inhibit rise.

Delicious and nutritious loaf of bread! 

I followed these directions since I donât have a bread machine: 

Mix all dry ingredients in bowl of stand mixer, substituting 3.19 oz. dried  spent grain for the wheat flour. Add wet ingredients to dry and mix on low speed with paddle attachment until dough comes together, about 1 minute. Swap out paddle for dough hook and knead on medium-low until dough is smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes. 

Reducing speed to low, slowly add pecans, then dates and mix until mostly incorporated, about 3 minutes. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead by hand about 30 seconds until dates and pecans are evenly distributed and dough is a smooth, round ball. Place dough in lightly greased large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, 1 1/2 - 2 hours. 

Grease 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 loaf pan. Press down to deflate dough. Turn dough out onto lightly floured counter (side of dough against bowl should now be facing up). Press and stretch dough into 8 x 6 inch rectangle. Roll into firm cylinder from long side and pinch seam closed. Place seam side down in prepared pan pressing dough gently into corners.

Cover loosely with greased plastic wrap and let rise until loaf reached 1/2 - 1 inch above pan and dough springs back minimally when poked gently with knuckle, 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours. 

Mist loaf with water and bake in 350Â°F  oven on lower middle rack 45-50 minutes until loaf registers 205Â°-210Â°F, rotating pan halfw

This is yummy. Very moist which surprised me since their is no eggs or milk. I will use this as the base of other fruit breads. I baked it as if it were a 1 pound bread in my machine. Next time I will try 1 and 1/2 pound. Wish the author had included that information. Perhaps I am missing it.

I just added this to my favorites and will make again. I substituted raisins and dried cranberries as I didn't have dates. I had sliced almonds so crunched them up a little.  I used quick cooking oats and it worked fine. I used the light setting on my bread machine as the loaf is on the small side. Delicious and nice texture.

Very dense, & heavy. Grandson took some in school lunch with pb&j and seemed to get some attention from some of the adults there. Found it a little hard to slice. Used coffee and added fruit and nuts at the start of cycle. Increased recipe to 16 servings because my machine can handle it. Didn't have rolled oats. Substituted the quick oats and I think this may account for the  texture. Will make again. Seems like a very healthy bread.

This bread is delicious! I addede dates in the beginning, so there were only few visible specks of them in the baked loaf. Almonds add a nice crunch. I will be making it again. Thanks!
