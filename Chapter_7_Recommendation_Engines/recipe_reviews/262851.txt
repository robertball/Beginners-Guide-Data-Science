It''s a wonderful surprise when you find a recipe that's this easy and tastes like you might find it at a fine French restaurant.  My wife and I just had a lovely dinner of the scallops with pesto cream sauce.  I had recently frozen my own homemade pesto sauce which I put to work here. I also added a luscious black bean stock  I had cooked and frozen, then added it to the rice, which gave it an extra depth of flavor.  I spooned the scallops and cream sauce over the rice, then paired it with a beautiful Honeysuckle  sauvignon blanc from Fiddlehead Cellars( at this moment in my wine journeys it's still my favorite sauvignon blanc..  Gotta love the vinter Kathy Joseph).  I sauteed some asparagus with Maui onion and threw in some of that luscious bean stock as well.  My wife has a wonderful palette and she was truly gushing over this dinner.  Thank you for bringing such elegance to my table so quickly!

Rich and bold indeed. I liked overall recipe and ease of instructions. Myself, knowing me will tweek the dish to some degree of heat (likely habanero or jalapeno pesto based). I'm from the South and like most everything with heat. Overall, definitely a win.

Rich and decadent. I rarely cook scallops, but they were on special, and I was planning guests. They, we all, loved this. Served with roasted veggies and salad.

I thought it was delicious, but very rich. I made a very small amount and could only just get through it.  I will certainly make it again.  I also intend to try it with fish.
