I had some homemade lemonade (sugar free, made with Truvia) that I used in this recipe. I made this into a one-person serving by pouring it in a very large glass. Very refreshing drink--not too sweet, perfect amounts of lemon, vodka and fizz.

I enjoy making a pitcher of these and when I get off work I just pour me a tall glass!  Before you know it that glass then the pitcher is gone and you find your're self making another pitcher.  Nice lemony drink! Thanks.

Oh Boy, I like this Collins! I didn't add as much soda water and made it even more lemony.  You can't even taste the vodka I put 6oz to this recipe and the still went down smooth.  Thanks for the Drink!  I owe you one!

These were a big hit.  I used the homemade recipe for Lemonade on the site and just added 7-up (1 cup) and Lemonade (2 cups) to 6 oz of vodka. Just right.

This seemed a little to watery.  Cut the club soda in half and it is great.  For something a little different occasionally, add a splash of grenadine.

Using a simple syrup in lieu of granulated sugar eliminates the undissolved sugar at bottom of glass.

Just so so - however, we used Crystal Light lemonade so maybe that was the problem. It doesn't taste very vodka-y, but I sure felt it afterward. :)

This is quite good, but don't use the vanilla vodka recommended by someone else unless you REALLY like vanilla.  Much better with plain vodka.

This was ok, but it was too watered down for my taste. Next time I will leave the club soda out and double the amount of vodka.

OMG!  I think this is my new favorite summer drink!!  I must have a small shaker, because I could only make 1/2 the recipe at a timeâ€¦ which is plenty for one drink in a tall glass.  I did substitute Splenda for the sugar.  Delicious and SO refreshing!!!!

We really enjoyed this, Dave! We made it as written, and would tend to agree that reducing the club soda to 1/2 cup and adding a bit more vodka works out perfectly for us. We made a second batch and muddled up some fresh raspberries and added them for something a little different. Very tasty. Thanks, Dave! Cheers!

It's makes more than one drink hard to mix in these quantities in a shaker. I didn't shake with the club soda thinking it would just make a mess. I'd like more fizz and more vodka next time. Great flavor though.
