Awesome Flavor!!!!! the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 if the cooking method, they came out a bit tough. I made them a second time, cooking the ribs as I usually do, wrapped in foil at 275 for 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Also the second time I made them my oldest sons friend was over, he's a 5 star restaurant manager and a trained chef, he suggested that I put the sauce in sauce pan on the stove bring in to a boil then put it on simmer and let it reduce until it was thicker. then I coated the ribs in the reduced sauce and broiled them for a few minutes until they browned up, you could also toss them on the grill. That made this 10 stars!!!!

My husband and I loved these ribs! They have tons of flavour. I followed the recipe but only used 1 tsp. of Sriracha hot chili sauce, and cut the rack of ribs into 3 and 4 ribs pieces. After roasting them uncovered, I moved them to a large Corningware casserole dish, poured the sauce over top, put on the lid, and continued baking. Result: Perfection! I served the ribs with plain basmati rice and veggies. Thank you Food Fighter for the great recipe!

Loved this recipe as if it was my own. I substituted hot pepper sauce for a Korean chili sauce. It makes for a hell of a kick in the after taste and the chili's tenderizes the meat just a notch more. It gets not better then that.

OMG, this is so tasty and so easy to prepare! This is my first time preparing ribs of any sort and they came out tender, juicy and super flavorful with the sauce. I made everything exactly as indicated with the only change being that I reduced the wine by a bit only because it would make the sauce too watery. Other than that, followed the recipe and the results were great.

OMG these were so good! I only had about 3/4 cup of hoisin sauce so I added a little bit of oyster sauce, and also a dash of toasted sesame oil. So tender, juicy, and flavorful!

This review is really about the sauce! This is good stuff - it was so hot outside that I really didn't want to turn on the oven so I mixed up the sauce - halving it and omitted the wine & I used sambal for the heat - I brushed the ribs with the sauce and wrapped tightly in heavy foil and put them on the BBQ on low indirect heat - then 2 hours later removed - brushed again and onto the grill = brushing with the sauce the whole time. Killer taste! Thank you!

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, because I forgot to read the directions fully. So I ended up marinating the riblets in the sauce and then baking them in the sauce, covered for 1 1/2 hours. They were still delicious. Next time I will half the sauce to make it the way it is directed.

Hubby re-proposed to me after making these!  Seriously, this sauce is so incredibly delicious it is a must-try.  I "working Mom'd" the recipe by cooking 4 racks of baby back ribs in the crock pot all day while I was at work (10 hours on low, with a bottle of beer poured in). Got home, removed ribs to a sheet pan, and poured sauce over the bottom side of ribs, then flipped over & poured on remaining sauce.  Baked at 350 while I was making side dishes - about 30 to 45 minutes.  Didn't have to double the sauce recipe.  Was perfection!  Ribs literally fell from the bone!

Fixed as written and used to coat country ribs on the grill. Really good flavor with just a hint of heat. You could really call it sweet and spicy. Will for sure put it in my favorites file!

Everyone loved these.  I doubled the recipe.   used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar....3/4 cup of each instead of 1 cup. @15 cloves of garlic....could have used more.  2 T  Rooster Sauce.....should have used 4T,
My husband would like to finish these on the grill to crisp them up.
Wasn't sure whether to  pour off fat after first 45 min.  I will next time.
I did cook these @6 hours total.

Wonderful.  We are not fans of spicy things but the recipe looked so good so I replaced the hot sauce with oyster sauce.  Wow.  We saved the sauce for future use on grilled chicken, it's that good.  Thanks for sharing.

Try them part slow cooker style:

Used two full racks of baby back pork ribs.  Cut them into fingers.  Put in a covered roaster  with 1/2 cm of water and two sliced lemons on top (lemons do an amazing tenderizing job but you don't taste the lemon in the end product).  Roasted for 1.5 hours @ 350 (325 convection).  Then removed the lemons and moved the ribs into a slow cooker.  Covered with the sauce (cut hoisen to 3/4 cup) and cooked covered on low for 2.5 to 3.5 hours or to preferred tenderness.  WOW!

This was okay as written, but the sauce was missing something for us. I added cilantro and that helped a great deal and then grated some fresh ginger into the sauce and that gave it the depth I craved! Great base sauce. I love how thick and sticky it is!

My husband LOVES this!! As do I. We had leftovers for another 2 nights and it was more delicious as the week went on.  I made the recipe exactly as shown. So easy. The only difference is I had 3 lbs of pork riblets instead of the 2 lbs.  There was definitely enough sauce for the extra pound.  Thank you for sharing.  My husband could not stop raving about this sauce.

I did as 1 lady suggested and cooked sauce on stove to thicken.  Added 1 tsp "smoke flavor" as well as 1 tsp sesame oil.   Also cooked as she did 2 1/2 hours 275 degrees.  Lathered both side after cooking and put under the broiler to crispen up.  They were the best I have ever made.  Love the stickiness of the sauce

This was great! Tender, sticky, fall off the bone goodness. Started with the 45min bake then added the sauce. We have a gas oven so after the sauce was added we were careful not to burn the sauce so we check every-so-often and pulled them out after 25min; so cooking time might vary with gas and electric. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Blessings!

O.m.g.! I made this last night and it was delicious! Instead of pouring the sauce over, I marinated it in the sauce for 4 hours. I didn't have anyour tomato paste so, I substitute it for tomato sauce instead. I will definitely make this again!

Ok. So the first time I tried the recipe, I followed it exactly. It was good but very sweet. So today, I tried the recipe again but added 1 tbls of cayenne pepper and two tablespoons of crushed red pepper. The ribs came out sweet and spicy! I loved it.

I had bnless pork ribs(3 lbs,& cheaper than baby back) & hoisin that i wanted to pair up & this was awesome! I made the sauce, set half aside, & put it, & the ribs in my crockpot on low for about 5-6 hrs (got them tender, but not falling apart) I did this the evening before, then the night of, took them out of the fridge,& while letting them come to room temp, I prepared asian potato salad(recipe on here) as well as a brocc salad... I put the ribs on foil-lined baking sheet, & broiled them on low(w/oven door open)brushing w/sauce every couple of minutes, turning after carmelizing one side...I did sub about 2tsp siracha, instead of tabasco, i think it's more "asian-y", & I have lil kids, so i couldn't make it too spicy...My hubby RAVED about the sauce...Yes I strayed slightly w/the ingredients, & cooked it in a manner more convenient for me, But this is an awesome recipe! Next time bb back ribs go on sale, I'll certainly try this w/them! Thanks

This was good but it was a little bit too salty for me. I think next time I would add less hoisin sauce. I don't think I would pour all of the sauce in either; I personally like my ribs coated lightly with sauce. I would add a bit less white wine as well

So good!! The whole family loved them!  I substituted catsup for the tomato paste.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I used riblets and flipped them over every 15 minutes after adding the sauce so that they were evenly coated.  I served them with fried rice and garlic broccoli with a little sesame oil added.  This dinner was a winner!!

The flavor of the sauce is fabulous.  I used it on pork chops tonight as the recipe makes more than needed for the riblets.

Used Crystal hot sauce.  Did not come out spicy.   There will be a next time and will use Tabasco as instructions indicate.  Awesome flavor, and easy to make.  Recommended

Made this last night and the family loved it. I did make a few changes though. First I threw the riblets on the grill to mark them and get a bit of smoky flavor. I braised them, covered, for about 45 minutes in some beer. Then I poured off the pan juices and put the sauce on them for the additional 45 minutes while I reduced the remaining sauce in the pan juices on the stove. I didn’t have tomato paste, so I used catsup and dry sherry instead of white wine. It was yummy and we will definitely be making the sauce again!

The sauce on these is fantastic!  The cooking method is not the best.  I prefer to put ribs in a slow cooker for a few hours with a little sauce, then bake them for a few hours, basting with more sauce, and broil at the end.  When I make these again, that is what I will do, but the sauce is a keeper.

I have made this recipe at least 3 times and it is so good. I haven't used tobasco sauce, but used Chinese chili paste instead, and cut the sugar in half.  I cook them for about 2 hours and turn the ribs in the sauce about every 15 minutes.  Super delicious every time!

Delicious & very simple. There's actually too much sauce for 2 lbs of meat. Next time, I'd half the sauce recipe and I'd still have plenty to coat 2 lbs of meat.

Excellent recipe! I used riblets instead of baby backs and ketchup instead of tomato paste, but the flavor was tangy and had a nice kick to it! Super simple to make, I should have dumped the "watery juices" after the first 45 minutes in the oven, only because it waters down the sauce, but they still tasted great!

Have allot of napkins for the stick fingers.I really enjoyed these I used 1/2 sugar because the hoisin sauce is already sweet,the wine...I used a # 1 Gewurtraminer white wine. The hot sauce I used was Sriracha Sauce. I added more then required I added 4 TBLS. They cooked perfectly let the ribs get to a temp that they aren't fridge cold don't pre boil the ribs either they will dry out and you want the fats to blend with the sauce. Also you need the time (45 min) for the sauce to caramelize and be absorbed into the ribs. This is a versatile sauce next with the left over sauce I'm going to do chicken quarters in a pan and adding sesame seeds as well. I will be making these again.

by far best oven ribs I've ever tasted, the sauce is really the best.  I twisted the recipe by cooking the ribs plain in a foil under the broiler for about 1 1/2 hour then another hour in the oven, then poured the sauce over it and re-baked it for for another hour.  the ribs tasted just like a restaurant flavoured rib and they were so tender.  This is a must try no need to look at no other rib recipe.

My husband and I loved these ribs! One thing I did different was to boil the ribs awhile first. I had intended to fix another recipe,but changed my mind to do this one. And I did not put as much hoisin sauce,I reduced the amount as suggested by another reviewer. As I had boiled them,it did not take as long to bake. Will make these again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it made the most tender ribs I've ever eaten. My family went crazy for it during a birthday party BBQ. I'm going to definitely make these again and again. I marinated the meat overnight in the sauce (and reserved some for later), cooked it in the oven as whole racks at 350 for 30 mins, and then finished them on the grill. It was delicious!
