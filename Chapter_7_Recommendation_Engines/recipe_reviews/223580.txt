This was a nice change of pace salad for a camping side dish.  I was camping, and even lazier than usual, so I used a package of slaw mix, rather than shred cabbage and grate carrots.  I also subbed sunflower seeds for the raisins per personal preference.  I would make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, Andi!

This is AWESOME! Great combination of flavors! I didn't have the ground mustard but still tasted great.
This will make anyone love to eat Veggies! I had to force myself to put the fork down!!

Great recipe really enjoyed it.  I used a broccoli and carrot slaw and added fresh celery as didn't have celery salt.  Plus used a cranberry,raisin, blueberries and cherries mix instead of just cranberries.  Also used feta as didn't have blue cheese

This  was delicious. I was worried about the rasins because I don't like sweet slaw or rasins for that matter but it wound up being a perfect balance. So easy to make. This will be a staple  for us.

This is by far the best broccoli salad I have ever made.  The blue cheese is the secret ingredient!  I have made about 10 different broccoli salads, and I have never had one this good!  Thanks for the recipe!

So, so good! Used a 12 oz. bag of broccoli slaw and chopped apple instead of raisins. Fabulous!

Very tasty but next time I think I will omit the pepper flakes.  We added dried blue berries and bacon to this recipe.  Did not have blue cheese so I used grated Romano cheese instead.  It came out well

Made this as a salad instead of a slaw, as I had a ton of broccoli to use up. Omitted the shredded cabbage, as well as the blue cheese crumbles because I just didn't have any. The dressing is delicious without it, and my hubby, who is not usually a fan of "sweet" creamy dressings really enjoyed this. Will make this again, next time adding sunflower nuts. We all agreed they would have added a lot to the salad.

Loved the dressing, turned out like a slaw dressing with a nice kick. I didn't have raisins so I used red seedless grapes sliced in half. All in all a great salad recipe, and you never can have enough of those to fall back on.

The flavor of the sauce just didn't come together for us.  My BF kept saying it tasted old fashion and didn't really get the blue cheese.
