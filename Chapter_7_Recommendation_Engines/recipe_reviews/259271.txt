I chose ths recipe because I like barbequed pork in my wonton soup. I made the Homemade Hoisin Sauce from Allrecipes for this recipe substituting 1 tbsp Sambal Oleck for the red pepper flakes. I used 20 ounces of ground pork since I am allergic to shellfish. Reduce rice vinegar as it was a little strong. I used my #100 scoop which is approximately 2 tsps to divy out the meat mixture, this yielded 50 wontons. I used all chicken stock as this is what I had. I cooked half the wontons to eat now and froze the remaining in a single layer then transferred to a Ziploc bag. My family enjoyed this soup. I used the rest of the pork for egg rolls and fried rice it was very tasty.

I used frozen wontons from Costco which cut down on prep time. I only cooked 8-10 wontons to start. There was plenty of broth so when I reheated the soup I added more frozen wontons...this way they don't get soaky and fall apart.
To the chicken/beef broth I added 1/2 tsp of seasame oil to prevent the frozen wontons from sticking.
I added 8 precooked shrimp chopped and a can of water chestnuts chopped and 10 cremini mushrooms chopped.
The pork tenderloin added a flavourful taste to the broth.
I forgot to add the soy sauce but it was good with out it.
I used the full cup of chopped green onions and a few more to serve on top of the soup.
I would definitely make this wonton soup again.

This was good but I recommend only making enough for one setting. Leftovers did not hold up well. The wonton's absorb all of the broth and then once re-heated they got overdone and mushy. I also felt the shrimp got lost with all of the pork. Overall good recipe though and one I would make again with some minor tweaks.
