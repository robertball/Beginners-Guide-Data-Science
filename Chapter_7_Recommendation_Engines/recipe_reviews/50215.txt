Wonderful change from plain old chicken salad. I never follow a recipe exactly and I added a few things to this one and it was excellent. I've made it 3 times in 5 days and it's been eaten on sandwiches, as a side dish and mixed with pasta.

WHILE MAKING THIS SALAD,I DID NOT THINK IT WAS GOING TO TASTE THAT GOOD,BUT I MUST CONFESS ALL THE INGREDIENTS AND FLAVORS BLEND TOGETHER VERY WELL. TASTES GREAT! USED IT FOR SANDWICHES.

this was very flavorful, and it's nice to find a chicken salad recipe that doesn't use mayo

I had a bit of chicken left over from a Costco rotisserie that I picked up earlier this week, and decided to give this recipe a try. I have to say, that I was quite surprised! I made half a recipe, and used a Mediterranean black olive (not the black olives you get in a can), and the flavors really worked! I had this for lunch, served on toast. I have a feeling it's going to taste even better tomorrow, after sitting in the fridge overnight. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
