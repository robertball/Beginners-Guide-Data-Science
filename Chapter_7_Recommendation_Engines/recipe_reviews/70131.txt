I made this as instructed using Absolut Mandarin vodka, Chambord and fresh lime juice. The results were revolting. This doesn't taste like a cosmo to me at all. Please don't waste good liquor on this drink.

Love this recipe! I have made this several times. The last time I used raspberry vodka! Over the top raspberry flavor which I can't get enough of! Watch it as it will sneak up on you!

Yum. It's fresh and bright and NOT weak. A great variation of a raspberry Cosmo.
