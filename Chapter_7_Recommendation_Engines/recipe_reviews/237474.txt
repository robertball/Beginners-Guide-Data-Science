I hadn't heard of Aleppo Pepper before, and looked for it for this recipe. Current conflict in Syria (Aleppo) has affected the availability of this spice. Pray for peace!  Here is a substitute: 4 parts sweet paprika, one part cayenne pepper.

I used John's recipe to cook a leg of lamb for Christmas. Home run for my finicky eaters. I like the way he details how to prepare the meat by cutting slashes. I did substitute honey for the molasses. Chef John is my go-to when trying new dishes.

Thank you, Chef John, for making our Christmas dinner a smashing success! I followed your special pomegranate mollases recipe and it was wonderful! I tripled the recipe for 3 boneless lamb roasts of about 5 pounds each and, after marinating them overnight, I gave a fun layer of fresh baby spinach leaves, goat cheese and chopped sweetened dried cranberries before rolling them up. I used the elastic wrappers that came with the lamb roasts to package them up and placed them side-by-side on a roasting rack with a little water at the bottom of the pan. They turned out perfectly! And we made lamb gravy for the mashed potatoes with the drippings. Wow! Heaven! Merry Christmas Chef John and thank you for your excellent advice! Leslie

I had to make my own pomegranate molasses, but it was pretty easy and the roast was awesome!
Recipe I used for the molasses was 4c.pomegranate juice, 1/2 c. sugar, and 1/4 c. lemon juice reduced down over low simmering heat - about one hour.

I made this for the family this weekend and it was simply amazing!  Although I could not find Pomogranate Molasses I took some plain dark molasses and added cranberry juice then reduced it.  For anyone who hasn't made a lamb roast before (like me!) I highly recommend watching Chef John's video.  It was soooo helpful.  The recipe is definitely a holiday type,  or great serve for special guests you want to impress and, the best part is that it isn't hard at all.  Thanks again!

Even if I didn't love cooking I would  watching you.  I grow my own pomegranates and make my own jellies--this year I will also add molasses and syrup. This one goes in the oven---but the one sitting in the freezer I will cook south Texas style==outside over mesquite.  Since I do alot of cooking for ranch hands and family I want the best ideas.  Every time I see one of your recipes try it. I like your quality.Thank you very much.

Fantastic. The only change I made was that I omitted the garlic from the marinade. Instead i used about 10 cloves, cut into thick slivers and cut deep slits all over the meat and inserted the garlic into the slits. After cooking, I defatted the juices from the pan and added 1 Tbs  of pom molasses  and served that on the side. I started with a  boneless leg weighing about 3 pounds. Cooking in my convection oven, it only took about 75 minutes to roast.

Delicious! Our guests loved it too!  The only change I made was to add a little organic dark brown sugar to the marinade, as I found it too tart without it. All Chef John's instructions about how to prepare the leg of lamb were clear and worked out perfectly.  Thank you!

Made it as the recipe said twice, and both times guests raved about this delicious dish!  The second time I had accidentally bought a lamb roast that had a rosemary and wine marinade.  I rinsed it off and used it, and it was fine as the wine and rosemary were similar to this recipe.  As a side note, the left over lamb from this dish makes THE best Shepherdâ€™s pie.  I made that with a mashed cauliflower top instead of potato, and again, everyone loved it.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

Love the sweet/tart of the pomegranate molasses.  Didn't have an Aleppo pepper, so I added a dash of powdered Cayenne.  Seemed to work just fine.

I made this recipe for our Passover meal feeding 8 people. I had guests who never had lamb before, I know, right? Anyway, they loved it.  I will be making this spectacular meal again. I never got a picture of my lamb which is a bummer. Next time.

Can I give it 6 stars?  The BEST lamb I've ever had.  Compliments & recipe requests from everyone at the table.  It really was to die for & so easy.

I followed the recipe exactly, love Chef John's recipes.  The only thing is my oven may run a little too hot, so next time, I will drop the temp a wee bit and go for 1.5 hours versus 1.75 hrs.  My husband savoured it, and he is not particularly fond of unique flavours, but it won him over.  Leftovers with potatoes au gratin tonight!

I usually mix fresh lemon juice with the pomegranate syrup/molasses (look for versions with less sugar for more flavor, the typical small bottles from Turkey are very sweet and not as flavorful as others you will find in Middle eastern stores or large grocery stores perhaps). I have not added cumin or chili pepper. I will see which version I make tonight.

This is an amazing recipe. Have made it twice now for holiday dinners to rave reviews.  If you a splurging on a leg of lamb, you might as well treat it right and make it amazing. This is the recipe for that.
I subbed paprika and cayenne for the Aleppo pepper as another reviewer suggested, and I subbed fresh mint for dried.  It is a little spicy for the kids. Next time I would cut down on the pepper.

Delicious recipe! Couldn't find allepo peppers so used another type. Made my own pomegranate molasses (which went amazing with the lamb!) Do not skip. If you can't find it, buy a bottle of 100% pure pomegranate juice in the health food section of your store. (Pom Wonderful would work, but you can get a large glass bottle on the shelf with the natural cranberry and cherry juices for around $5.)  Look on here or google a recipe, but you're just making a reduction. I sometimes find the flavor of lamb to be too much, but the mint and pomegranate together made it amazing! I've made lamb chops with mint and the extra pomegranate molasses as well. I like to drizzle extra pomegranate molasses on my plate to assure I have a little on every bite!

Another winner from Chef John.  Tried this recipe for New Year's meal as was looking for a new twist.  Alepo pepper was impossible to find, but I did find "Aleppo Chili".  I assume it is the same thing.???  The family enjoyed it, but my Albanian wife commented that she personally preferred a simpler recipe with garlic, salt and pepper and natural flavor of the lamb, like her mom used to make more.

Didnâ€™t have pomegranate molasses or fresh to make it, so I used fresh calanamsi juice and turned into molasses. Turned out very well but would make again using pomegranate molasses next time.

Excellent recipe!  I substituted red pepper flakes for the aleppo pepper and ground marjoram for the mint because I didn't have those and it turned out great.  Even my family members who don't like lamb enjoyed it.

Yes, yes. . SOO , as  I said before, me News Years Resolution was to make ONE NEW  recipe per month, for the year of 2018, & all of them would be "Chef Johns' " recipes.  This month, Easter was April 1st, April Fools day, & I did both. I made a recipe of Leg of Lamb with homemade Mint sauce, played 2 jokes , & went to  Easter Sermon.   
  BLOODY "ELL WOW!  Enough said. I'm British The mint sauce was soo  ENGLISH! The Lamb had NO Muttony taste, & was ever  soo succulent, The skin ...  Soo crispy skinned. Everything was  over thee top fantastic.     This was a 7 1/2 pound Leg of Lamb. Hardly anything is left!  Happy Easter all you foodies.  I'm making a Bloody Mary now as we speak   to celebrate. ( Ok a pitcher of them )  Cheers all.

I never roasted  lamb before. I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try. I made this for Easter, following the recipe as written, including making my own Pomagranate molasses. It was wonderful. The lamb was moist and full of flavor. My husband complimented me on the meal many times. Chef Johnâ€™s video instruction was very helpful. Thanks, Chef John!  Will definitely make this again.

This was a hit at our house!  Voted best lamb ever. Thanks, Chef John.  Had no dried mint but used fresh in fine mince.  The smell while this was cooking was heavenly.

Great as is. One suggestion: if you can't find dried mint and don't have fresh, just use the content of a peppermint herbal tea bag. Works perfectly and I use that everywhere that I want mint but don't have fresh at home.

I loved the flavor of this recipe.  I used red pepper flakes instead of Aleppo pepper and I used 1 teaspoon of dried rosemary as I didn't have fresh on hand.  Outstanding taste.  

I also cooked it at 325 degrees since I was cooking a small boneless leg of lamb (2.5 pounds).  I generally cook that size for one hour at 325 degrees so I stuck with what I am familiar with.

For those wondering where to buy pomegranate molasses - try looking in middle eastern/halal grocery markets.  I found it a year or so ago to use in a particular recipe and it was so nice to see that Chef John created a recipe that allowed me to use up some more of this tasty condiment.

All I can say is WOW, Chef John you've done it once again!  I followed the recipe exactly except I couldn't find dried mint so I used fresh mint.  It is simply melt in your mouth delicious and easy too!  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.

I did not have the pomegranate molasses, so I used plain molasses & it worked great. I also didn't have the pepper in the recipe so I used ancho chile pepper & it worked great too. Other than that I did everything else the same & it was wonderful.

Made this for our Easter meal last night.  Followed the directions except for the Aleppo pepper that is not available in Austin due to the un-rest in Syria--used red chili flakes.  Have a new grill with a rotisserie so I tied the leg of lamb around the spit when I was tying it.  Turned out great!  Moist, tender and flavorful.  Watch the cooking time and take temperature readings as it was more medium than medium rare,  Made a gravy with drippings with some red wine.

Loved it.  I really had to change up the math, because I had a roast that was only 2.75 lbs after the bone was removed.  It almost got over done, but I saved it just in time.  Thank you Chef John for the various ways of cooking such an awesome protein.

I thought this was really tasty.  I am not a fan of lamb but this really changed my mind.  I had to make the pomegranate molasses, but it was easy with a bottle of Pomegranate juice. I did not have fresh rosemary or Aleppo pepper so I used dried rosemary and red pepper flakes.  Still really delicious.

I was honestly displeased with this. Maybe my oven is on the hotter side, but it turned out dryer than a toenail. The molasses (naturally) burnt , but didnâ€™t provide a good flavor as a result (it just tasted burnt) . First time I ever made lamb with mint and truthfully, we did not enjoy that flavor addition either. I will not be making this again sadly, my guests were polite but did not enjoy it as well. I do love the pomegranate molasses and its flavor , so I might try cooking a rack with it or something that doesnâ€™t roast as long as this did.

Loved it. (Didnâ€™t have pomegranate molasses. Used regular molasses and added some dried cranberries. Didnâ€™t have Aleppo pepper. Used dash of crushed red pepper and 1/2 tsp of paprika.) So easy, delicious, tender, perfectly cooked. Will definitely make again. May try with beef.

I decided to try this recipe for family Easter dinner. I make a leg of lamb every year, family wasnâ€™t thrilled, it was so-so.  This year was totally different! Everyone loved it, I had a very small amount of leftovers. Received many compliments! Thank you Chef John, youâ€™ve done it again!

Itâ€™s a great recipe and I will make it for friends next time. I did a half recipe because I thought I didnâ€™t need that much.    I wish I wouldâ€™ve made the whole amount.  I had a small leg and It would have been better with more of the pomegranate mixture.  I look forward to making again.

Love Love Love it! Was easy and super delicious, A real hit at family holiday dinner. 

I did make my own Pom molasses from another of Chef Johns recipes- also super easy and delicious!!

Will definitely make this again.

I've also used the pom molasses with lamb chops pan or oven roasted, or grilled. Really has become a fam fav sauce for our lamb! 

Ps- We are NEW to cooking lamb!! 
Chef John is awesome and has made it easy to be successful!!  :)

Best lamb we have ever eaten! Authentic Mediterranean flavors that we love. Easy to make pomegranate molasses and it is delicious with this lamb!  Plan on overnight marinating time but it is well worth the wait! Also thank you for the video, it was helpful in following the recipe

This wonderful recipe was a huge hit this Easter Sunday! We usually have a traditional Polish Easter; kielbasa, ham, hard-boiled eggs, and babka. This year I finally decided to add another item to the menu. After googling the best lamb recipe I found Chef John's and boy am I glad I did! Everyone loved it. Thank you Chef John, we now have a new tradition.

If the rating went up to 10 stars, I would give this lamb recipe 10.  OMG this was the best tasting lamb I have ever had, juicy, tender and a flavor to die for.  I decided to try a new recipe this year, my traditional Easter lamb is smoked and grilled, but this was out of this world.  Everyone loved it.  This is now my favorite lamb recipe.  Thank you Chef for sharing this.

Excellent!  Great videos on the preparation of the butterflied roast as well as the recipe itself.  I also made the pomegranate molasses from juice and that was great too!  This may be our signature dish for Passover.  Thank you!

Chef John hit this one OUT OF THE PARK!! I had to skip the garlic, as my wife is allergic, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Didn't have time to go looking for a local store that carried Pomegranate Molasses, so I followed the link to make my own. I cooked to an internal temperature of 135Âº on a covered gas grill set at 350Âº. Smash hit!!! Best Lamb I've ever had anywhere! I will absolutely do this again!

It wasn't has tender as I had hoped.   The flavor was great.   I used about 3x the rosemary, because I really like its taste.  It also held good flavor in the stew I made. With the leftover lamb,  I cubed it, and I made 2 lamb stew dinners with my instant pot pressure cooker. These were outstanding meals!  After the Instantpot reached temperature (it took 12 minutes) on high pressure.  Plus, the lamb was SO tender after this process.  So, the 5# leg of lamb from Sam's Club--$20ish, and 3 meals.  Not too bad.

We made a bone in version and tied it up before marinating, and it still tasted great! Make sure you check at multiple sites with instant read thermometer.   I think the boneless version would double tasty.  Make sure you multiply the amounts to make enough to baste with.  Another must try from Chef John! And as always, enjoy!  Cook on!

This will be my go to Lamb roast recipe from now on. Loved all the flavor. I didnâ€™t change a thing. Was able to find the Aleppo pepper and pomegranate molasses. This is probably my fifth or sixth Chef John recipe. He never disappoints.

Made exactly per recipe,marinade for twelve hours. Baked an hr. 30 but did it on convection..thus a little overdone.i found the marinade rather bitter and will add sugar nexrpt time. However the lesson on tying the meat was great as have always found this difficult and Johns method works really well...forget the knots !

I just LOVED the way this turned out! Made it for Easter lunch, and my family wasn't wild about the seasonings (personal preference), but I enjoyed it for days. The roasting is effective in sealing in the flavor, and creating a nice crust! 
I will make this again for company, and perhaps adjust the seasonings... Thanks, Chef John!

This is amazing! I made the recipe as is. I ordered the Aleppo pepper and pomegranate molasses from amazon. It was Easter dinner, and it was worth it. Several family members who said they don't like lamb, loved this dish! I bought the roast at Costco. This will probably be our new Easter tradition.

WILL make this again. Did not have any Aleppo pepper. Turned out great. Try making your own pomegranate molasses - easy to do, but use a defuser/simmer plate on your burner. Less chance of burning during cook down. Mine took a little over 2 hr.

Thank you, Chef John!  Once again, you're one of the home cook's best friends.  This was my first attempt at lamb (other than grilling chops, which doesn't really count as any idiot can do that), and following your recipe to the letter, was a wonderful success.  I made it for my church's Maundy Thursday potluck, and got raves, even from my pastor's father, who is Armenian and something of an expert on preparing lamb.  I would add just one thing: if you did not get your leg boned, cleaned, and butterflied from your butcher, I would strongly recommend watching a video on Martha Stewart's website.  This was an excerpt from an episode of her PBS show "Martha Cooks" in which she brings in a butcher to demonstrate preparation of several cuts of meat, including leg of lamb. Critical point here: there is a gland encased in a fat vein between the top and bottom round muscles.  It gives off pungent flavor/odor when cooked and must be removed or the meat will be gamey.  I suspect this is why many people are put off by lamb's "gaminess"... the lamb isn't the issue, rather the butcher's carelessness or the inexperienced cook's ignorance.  It was fortunate I saw that episode and was able to refer to it on Ms. Stewart's website.

It's seldom that I make no changes in a recipe since I know my family's taste so well (most often more herbs, garlic, and pepper than the original recipe). However, the first time I made this, trusting Chef John's delicious sounding ingredients, I followed the recipe absolutely and the unusual blend was beyond excellent! Best lamb I have ever eaten! I prepared to make it again and noticed the dregs of my recent homemade blackberry jam in a jar. In it jumped - a couple of tablespoons of seeded blackberry jam! The result was just as delicious, so if you want to add another fruity flavor to the delicious pomegranate molasses, I assure you it'll work!

Turned out really good.  I cooked to the 135 temp and let sit accordingly but feel it was way too raw in the middle.  Next time will try 140.  Other than that the flavor was amazing.  I'm Middle Eastern and had the pomegranate syrup which I think is what made it.  Will definitely make again.

Best leg of lamb 12 of us ever had!!  My neighbor made it after having it at my house and two months later their friends are still raving about it too.   Really divine exactly as written.  Thank you Chef John!!  I have now made it three times and plan to use it every time I make a leg of lamb.

I made this recipe for Easter for my husband, his mom and brother.  It's only the 2nd time I've made lamb.  I wasn't very fond of the recipe I used the first time so thought I'd try something different.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the dried mint which I did not have.  I used fresh and doubled the amount since it was a fresh herb.  I found the pomegranate molasses at a mediterranean food store.  Everyone LOVED it and my husband said it was the best lamb he's ever had.  All the flavors blended so perfectly and the meat was very tender.  I used a remote read thermometer, set it to 135 degrees  and in about an hour and 45 minutes it was done.  It was super simple.  I most definitely will make this recipe again.
