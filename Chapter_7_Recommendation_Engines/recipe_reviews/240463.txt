Nice and easy. I had actually put this together without looking on here first except that I used milk because I had no cream. Tis very sweet frosting and as it was intended for a spice cake I added a bit of cinnamon to this recipe and to my taste lessened the sweetness and improved the frosting for the spice cake.

This frosting is just like the description says, it is a very sweet frosting. A little goes a long way. I wouldn't suggest piping on cupcakes like I did. I think this would be good smeared on top of cinnamon rolls.

The flavor is great, a bit sweet, but offsets the savory bacon flavor of the coconut I used. Next time less liquid. After the maple syrup, the consistency was fine and didn't need the cream.

10.09.16 ~ Yum, Yum, Yum - I could have eaten this frosting with a spoon, but I didn't, I only licked the beaters. I didn't have any whipping cream on hand, so I used a little milk. It worked perfectly and gave me the texture I wanted to frost 'Grandpop's Special Chocolate Cake' from AR. Definitely will be using this one again.

I added a pinch of salt and used unsalted butter. It was perfect. Especially with chopped bacon!!
