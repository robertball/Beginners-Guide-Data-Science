This is basically pumpkin pie filling without the crust.  I made these for my family at Thanksgiving since my mother has an allergy to gluten, and they were loved by all.  I baked these on the longer side of the recommended time, more like 40 mins.  I just threw all of the ingredients in a blender, mixed, and poured into ramekins.  SUPER easy and delicious, I highly recommend.

Made this custard for my family and dinner guests.  Everyone loved it!  This recipe is a keeper.  The only thing I altered was the bake time; I baked for 50 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly. When I tasted it while it was warm, I wished that it had more pumpkin flavor--the flavor was really lacking for me. But today I am eating one that is cold, and the pumpkin flavor is more pronounced, and the consistency is more pleasant. I really like it better cold. Be careful not to over bake. I made some in ramekins and others in dishes a little bigger. I baked for 35 minutes, and I think I should have pulled the ramekins at 30 min or earlier. If you over bake, it changes the consistency. The ones I made that are perfectly baked, though, are very smooth and creamy when served cold. I would make this again, but next time I'll make it the day prior and let it chill in the fridge overnight because I think it tastes better the second day chilled.

Very good and very easy, but not quite pumpkin pie for me, which I didn't expect it to be but also not a custard. I suppose I discovered from this that I'm a purist on both counts.

Very easy to make and delicious. I served this custard with a turkey dinner in February, and it made a perfect dessert without much effort.

Great recipe, great texture.  It's a bit closer to mousse than typical pumpkin pie filling.  We added cinnamon to the  mixture before baking. We also topped with homemade egg nog ice cream. YY\UM!!!

Love this recipe when fall rolls around! Quick prep, no fuss while in the oven and delicious result! I make this recipe in a round glass casserole dish that is set inside a water bath in a larger casserole dish. Due to using one large baking dish I have increased the baking time to 60 min.

Just like pumpkin pie without the crust! It's simple to make and I typically have all the necessary ingredients in my kitchen for the moment I get a craving. Will definitely make again. Don't forget the whipped cream!

Made as per the instructions but did bake a wee bit longer (40 minutes).  After reading another's review, I put all ingredients together & used a processor to blend.  So simple.  So smooth. So delicious, for those who enjoy the flavour of pumpkin.  This dessert is now a staple at Thanksgiving & Christmas!

New favorite holiday treat! It was a huge hit and everyone is now asking for my recipe. All my friends and family now know about my secret cooking "weapon" (AllRecipes.com). 
I can't believe how simple it was to make and how beautiful they turned out.

Excellent dessert. A nice twist on egg custard. I'm not a pie person but my husband is. I did not use any whipped topping with my custard.  It was sweet enough. I have a tendency to use a lot of whipped topping with traditional pumpkin pie. I will make this again.

So good and So easy!! And even good the next day. Only 3 of us, so I hate to make a pie ( and I don't like the crust anyway ). But this was super!! Mine did take closer to 50 mins to cook though. Our elevation is a bit high ( 4700 ft). A total winner!!
