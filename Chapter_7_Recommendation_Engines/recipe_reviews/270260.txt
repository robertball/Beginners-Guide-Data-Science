These fritters turned out pretty good. I really liked the nutty flavor the almond flour gave them. I think a sprinkle of red pepper flakes would take these up another notch.

Great for Keto/Paleo diets but needs something more spice and some kind of sauce.  Any ideas?

I added cayenne pepper, black pepper, and some Sriracha, but still found the taste more bland than expected, and it was very dry. I did like the nutty flavor imparted by the almond flour, and I love both broccoli and cauliflower, but I'm not sure I'd make it again. I might try with even more spices, and maybe an extra egg to combat the dryness.
