This is a great recipe. I used vegetable broth instead of beef, and also added some extra veggies. Also maybe 3/4 teaspoon of Italian seasoning (margoram, parsley, rosemary, etc). Will be making again.

This is a good recipe. I did add a few things. I added some zucchini, sweet potato, and white beans.  I also added a couple dashes of worcestershire sauce. In the end my boyfriend said it was the best vegetable soup he has had in his whole life. So this one is a keeper!!!

The spice that's missing is marjoram.  Use about 1/8t.

Excellent and easy enough for a man who is a non cook to prepare a decent meal for the family. Re-heats well and lends itself to subtle changes / additions like, garlic, broccoli, cabbage. My wife loved it and was shocked I made anything that tasted this good.

Good soup that's good for you! I used 6 beef bouillon cubes and 6 cups of water instead of the beef broth. I also like to add about 3/4 c. dried lentils. For a dash of extra spice, use diced tomatoes with roasted garlic and onion instead of plain diced tomatoes. I didn't need to add salt. My husband loves this soup!

this recipe is easy and very, very tasty. I added a piece of beef stew meat and a soup bone.  Then I slow cooked it in my slow cooker for approximatley 7 hours.  Delicious and very easy.

I added 1/8t margoram as suggested.  Also a  1/2 tbs of parsley and 1/8t of thyme.  Yummy!  And 1 cup of the soup is only 1 weight watchers point.

I grew up on homemade vegetable soup and frankly have avoided it my whole life because I was burned out on it.  Even the smell would turn my stomach.  However, I'm trying to eat better and wanted to make this as a treat for my DH who loves vegetable soup.  I was very surprised to find that this was nothing like my mother's soup (which is a good thing) and I really enjoyed it.  I think I added just enough pepper to give it a kick.  I halved the recipe and used half chicken broth because I had some to use up.  I will be making this again!

I didn't change anything on the recipe but I added a few things, I added some corn, just cuz i had some lying around the freezer that needed to be used up, and i added some marjorum, italian seasoning, worstershire, and Kitchen Bouquet Browning and Seasoning Sauce. Delish....will definately keep this and make again.

This recipe is Great, it is very easy to make and tastes awesome. I replaced the carrots with corn and added a few more ingredients of my own and it turned out perfect. Loved it!

I thought this was good, but it is missing something. It needs some added spices to it. I will make it again, and spice it up a little.

A decent, easy to make veggie soup. I adjust the veggies a bit depending on what we're in the mood for, and it's very tomato-y, but good.

I took EHERING's suggestion on the spices.  Also, I excluded the tomato sauce and carrots (just because I didn't have any), and it was STILL really amazing!!

changed a few things only because I didnt have other ingredients: substituted beef broth for chicken and a half a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes in oregano and basil seasoning.   i then added zucchini, 1 can of white kidney beans, half a box of whole wheat rotini and omitted the extra spice. I also added garlic salt rather than regular salt. Really good! will make again!

This was delicious! I am not a veggie fan but I loved this soup. I made it as the recipes calls however I did add some Zucchini, and Worcestershire sauce. We had a group coming over to our house and so the soup ended up simmering for about 4 hours by accident. I didn’t mind though because the consistency was perfect! The liquid had a hearty thickness to it. My husband, being the carnivore that he is, was surprised that I wasn’t putting any meat in it; however, I thought that the beef broth added plenty of flavor, next time we will try adding some beef. Following other recommendations I added marjoram, parsly, oregano, thyme, and basil. My husband did sneak in a cup or so of brown rice when I wasn’t looking, which made it more substantial for a hearty dinner. I love how healthy this recipe is, how it is simple but has amazing flavor. We will definitely be making this again!

I agree with others that it was missing something.  I gave it another try and doctored it up some. This time it turned out fabulous!  I left out the potatoes and salt. (beef broth is salty enough!) I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, 4 tbs of worchestershire sauce, 4 fresh tomatoes, basil, one clove garlic, a handful of lentils and then i cooked elbow noodles and added them to the soup bowl before serving.  I know I changed a lot, but this was the only way my family would eat it!  AND THEY LOVED IT!!  Try it!!

Great recipe.  I used beef stock left from a roast, adding a little water.  I also added a can of mixed veggies to the veggies already called for as well as a dash of crushed red pepper.  Tasty!  Thanks!

I fixed this awesome dish and shared with family too! Everyone loved it. I added sweet potato, 3 cloves garlic, some broccoli and cauliflower. I don't think I needed to cause the recommended is fabulous but  I just had to for my own tastes. I will most definitely be fixin' this yet again this winter.

Quick, economical, healthy and easy to modify! Based on other reviews about this recipe being a bit bland as written I added a tsp of crushed garlic; 1/8 tsp each of basil, marjoram and oregano; and a scant 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes. Used "Not-Beef" bouillon to make it vegan. Organic canned tomatoes are worth the extra $. You could add almost anything to this recipe - beans, mushrooms, lentils, corn, barley, etc.  Good for cleaning out the fridge, freezer or pantry! This recipes makes a lot.

This recipe was far over rated. I was very disappointed. It was bland and had no taste. My children usually eat my soup, and they didn't like this. It needs more spices. This should be rated more a one or a two instead of a 4. I would get another recipe for vegetable soup, and pass this one up.

I picked these recipe because it sounded so easy, and it really is! I've made it twice now, the first time I added a can of corn and a can of green beans. This time I added some beef and barley too. It was very good both ways. My boyfriend likes it too!

This was really good and easy!  I threw in some frozen corn and beans, and I used macaroni instead of potatoes.  My kids really enjoyed.

I made this for my in-laws.  They really liked it.  I used chicken broth instead of beef broth ... it still tasted very good.
