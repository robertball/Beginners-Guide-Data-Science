My husband LOVES this.  He got ill with me when I shared the leftovers with my sister for lunch!  He thinks it's better with yellow tomatoes, but red tomatoes are fine.  I followed the advice of others and cut the salt in half for the chicken rub.  I also used a whole wheat pizza crust.  Besides that, the recipe is perfect.  If you like mushrooms, be sure to add those because it makes the pizza better.  Thanks for this wonderful, healthy pizza recipe!  I am adding a note in here about the sogginess another reviewer mentioned - I always squeeze my salsa through a cloth or paper towel before spreading on pizza.  Otherwise, the excessive liquids leave the crust soggy and messy to eat!

I too only used this for the Blackened Chicken part, was by far the best I've had (but be-warned it is abit spicy). Probally not for the younger croud but if you like full flavor and a bite back this stuff is great!

Freakin' amazing. The chicken is excellent by itself but what really steals the show is the sauce. It's almost like having your chicken and cheese on top of a delicious bed of fresh salsa.

Fabulous.  I par-baked a pizza crust for about 5-7 minutes to avoid a soggy crust-used a Trader Joe's pizza dough purchased in the refrigerator section. The chicken is fabulous with the spice combination.  Because I was at a friend's house using a dull knife to chop the salsa ingredients, I eventually used a food processor to aid in the process.  I just spread the salsa on the crust and then topped with the chicken and the recommended cheese.  I took the pizza to my gourmet group and it was consumed in a very short period of time.  I did not think that there was a whole lot of heat produced by the ingredients-just a very flavorful combination. The crust was not soggy and I did not drain off any liquid from the salsa like some people did.  All I can say is "YUMMY"!

The pizza was very good, but I believe that the oregano was too strong in the chicken's seasoning. Next time I make it, I will cut it down if not omit it completely.

This pizza was incredible, the chicken was great. I added crumbled turkey bacon as well. The only problem I had was the crust came out kind of soggy on the bottom. Be sure to drain extra tomato juice before spreading salsa.

I LOVE this pizza!!  It's delicious yet healthy!  I too use whole wheat pizza crust, and use olive oil to marinate the chicken, and 2% cheese, or whatever I have on hand.  I have also used red tomatoes, yellow, and Roma tomatoes.  They all work.  I have also put spinach on the bottom before too.  This is just one of those recipes that you can tweak to your liking.  Thank you Sarah!

Very good but a little too spicy for me.  I used provolone rather than pepper jack and will still reduce jalapenos next time.  I used a whole wheat pizza crust.  This recipe is a healthy way to eat pizza - thanks!

Fantastic pizza!  The little salsa mixture added such great flavor to this pizza!  I didn't even miss sauce, which I did stir a little olive oil in with the tomato mix.  Flavorful, fresh and healthy...thanks!

This recipe was easy and this pizza taste so fresh.  I love the spicy chicken and the tomato to cool your mouth off.  It can be a bit salty but just keep it out of the rub and you should be fine.
This pizza was GREAT!

This was fantastic, especially paired with a homemade pizza crust. We eliminated the thyme and jalepeno simply because we didn't have them, substituted onion salt for salt and onion powder, and used red tomatos instead of yellow. These changes may have cut down on the spiciness a little that way, which was OK with us. Definitely will make this again.

I made this tonight, less the red onions. It is FABULOUS!  I think I'll add green peppers and bacon next time to switch it up a bit.  This recipe will definitely be used again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is one of my favorite recipes!  I love the many flavors and it has a great kick to it.  The blackened chicken is also good just by itself.  I can never seem to find yellow tomatoes, so I usually just use Roma tomatoes and it still turns out great.

Whew doggie!  This one is hot hot hot.  The seasoning is great and I will most certainly use that over and over.  I will make this pizza again, I will just cut out the peppers.  The seasoning is spicy enough.  Great stuff though - clears the sinuses!  My husband loved it.  Thanks for the great healthier pizza.  04/08/08 - Just used the blackening portion of this on Tuna Steaks - awesome!

I must admit, I was looking for the perfect blackened seasoning, so I didn't make the pizza, only the rub.  I really really like the rub.  I only gave it four stars because it was a little too salty.  I'll fix that by making another recipe of it without using salt, then combining the two.  I'll make the pizza eventually, but for now, the blackened rub is excellent!

This was very different and really tasty although there was way too much salt in it. I would reduce the salt from 3 tsp to 1. I cooked the chicken and then added mushrooms and onions to the hot oil as well as adding olives to the sliced tomatoes. I did not have pear tomatoes so I used some yellow ones I grew in my garden. I have made this with red ones too and it is still delish.

This pizza was okay but I had a few issues with the recipe.  It calls for two yellow pear tomatoes, but the only yellow pear tomatoes I'm familiar with are about the size of cherry tomatoes - so two would definitely not be enough for this recipe.  I used two yellow Heirloom.  In my opinion the seasoning can be reduced by half.  My chicken was liberally covered and I only used half the seasoning.  I like moderatly spicy foods, but this was borderline too spicy for my tastes AND I only used half the cayenne called for and did not use the jalapenos!  If I were to make it again I would incorporate all of the above changes and I would use a different cheese in lieu of the Pepper Jack.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Sarah Stephan!

Very good recpie!  I realized that one could skip chopping up the veggies and simply buy salsa fresca in the produce section if they wanted...but I haven't done that yet.  I've made this twice so far and the second time, all I could find was Kraft shredded pepperjack cheese with Philadelphia cream cheese mixed in.  It makes alot of spice so don't let the 3t of salt throw you off...you can coat the chicken as heavy as you want.  You could even halve the spices and still have plenty left over.  A keeper!

This was fantastic!  Absolutely one of my favorites.  Sogginess might have been a factor if I hadn't pre baked the crust for a few minutes, but The salsa and spices were perfect together.

Delicious!  I made with normal tomatoes (couldn't find pear tomatoes at my store), and it was wonderful.  I used thin pizza crust dough and cooked according to the package directions instead of a prebaked pizza crust.  Great recipe, thanks Sarah!

This was amazing. I changed it a little though. I sautéed the chicken with garlic and onions and when it was done added a little green chili. I also mixed all of the seasonings into some alredo sauce and used that as a base for the pizza. I left out the jalapeño because i didnt have any  So good! I will make this over  and over

I loved this pizza! I couldn't find the yellow tomatoes so I used Romas and it turned out great. My family really liked it, I will definitely make it again.

Completely delicious!  Not only are the blackened chicken and the salsa really well-flavoured recipes on their own, but the combination of the two as a pizza topping is excellent.  Will be making this on a regular basis :)

I didn't know who would like this in our house since it was spicy but it ended up being me and my 15 year old daughter that ate it up.

Pretty much amazing. The chicken was delicious! VERY spicy and VERY salty; I left out the regular salt completely, but traded garlic powder for garlic salt.When the chicken came out of the pan I had to wipe it down with a paper towel!
Modifications: cut spices in half and definitely leave off the salt

The chicken was fantastic alone, but the pizza itself wasn't a great combination for me.  I felt it overpowered the great flavor of the chicken.

my boyfriend and I made this this weekend, using Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe.  we used half of a jalepeno in the salsa and next time will use a whole.  I drained the salsa in a colander and it still made the crust soggy; next time I will follow the advice of other reviewers and squeeze the salsa dry of the liquids.  I did not like the pepperjack cheese (I'd never had it before!) and next time we'll probably use colby-jack or sharp cheddar for some flavor variation.  we grilled the chicken on a gas grill and next time we might try to grill the whole pizza or make individual pizzas!  

good summer recipe!

My family loved this pizza, even my non-tomato eating teens.  It's really more like a flatbread, but all the better.  I didn't have a jalapeño but we didn't miss it, the flavor was still wonderful.  Since others complained of a soggy crust, I was careful to drain the salsa before putting in on the crust and cooked perfectly.  The citrus flavor was a nice compliment to the spicy chicken.

We love this pizza.  I have made it about 5 times since I first tried it.  I generally believe that pizza isn't pizza without a tomato sauce, but this is an exception.  The flavors of the chicken fit perfectly with the salsa and the pepperjack cheese.

Very tasty.  I used red tomatoes because they did not have any yellow at the store.  Slightly healthier than regular pizza.  Will make again.

Made this as an appetizer at a friend's house last night. I had to leave my copy of the recipe there since they liked it so much. If you don't/can't eat spicey food this is definitely not you although I'm sure you could adjust the ingredients but I wouldn't change a thing. Ice cold beer really compliments this dish too!
