This is the way my dad made french toast when I was a kid. This is the best. I love the crunchiness. Not mushy like most french toast. This is my favorite french toast. I use lots of syrup.

This recipe was not fun to cook at all.  Oil splattered everywhere.  But I must admit, it was a great twist, if you dont mind your food a little on the greasy side (you can blot most the grease out).  I used wheat bread, so I dont know what it's like w/white or texas toast.  Prob way better!  Have a go at it if you dont mind the greasy mess you'll have to clean up afterward!  (Suggest a grease-splatter cover)

I found that 1 cup of oil for frying was too much at least for the first batch.....my son enjoyed the crispy texture.

This is a really good recipe. I usually never give review, but I really like this recipe. Simple ingredients that were all on hand and quick to make. I would, however, recommend that you should only make this if you have a deep fryer. I haven't tried making it on a frying pan but it would probably be messy (as one reviewer mention). I added a little nutmeg and cinnimon to my mix, I cut my toast into halves, diagonally, and then batter. I fried for about 3mins each side and then flip. They all turned out perfect. I had no problems. I gave some to my neighbor who loved it.

Great Recipe!! Alittle greasy though. I dipped the bread in corn fliakes after the milk and egg then fried them came out great with a nice crunchy taste.... For sure use this recipe in the future!

My, oh my!  Husband told me to stop taking a photo of it and eat it because he thinks it's the best French toast he'd ever had!  I was thinking maybe other reviewers had soggy toast because of the type of bread they used, and the amount of milk called for.  I used French bread and a little more egg and less milk than called for.  I also made sure my oil was really hot so the bread would fry in it, not just soak it up.  I made a little blueberry sauce to top it off-just delish!  Hubby rates it "Five stars and two thumbs up!"

I tried this recipe out, and it didn't turn out as good as I hoped. I don't have a deep fryer, so I just put the oil in a pan. It was very messy, and the french toast absorbed too much oil. I think that this recipe probably would be good if I had a deep fryer, but since I don't won't make this recipe again.

I used margarine, not a whole cup but a tbs. per slice. Next time I might add a little sugar to the egg milk mixture.  I also added a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. All in all it was very good.
