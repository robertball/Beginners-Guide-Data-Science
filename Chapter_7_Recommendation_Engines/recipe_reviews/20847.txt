Very strong - I had to add some milk and extra chocolate sauce to make these 'heavenly'.

We loved these mudslides! It seemed like a large amount of liquor so I adjusted down to 1 cup of the Irish Cream Liquer and 1 cup of the coffee flavored liquer. They were absolutely fantastic.

My husband and I love these. I made them with "homemade" Irish Cream and Coffee liqueur. Both recipes I got here on allrecipes. My coffee liqueur was actually tequila rather than vodka and it was still awesome. I measured everything closely since I do not usually make drinks we thought they we good but I think I adjusted down a little for seconds.
