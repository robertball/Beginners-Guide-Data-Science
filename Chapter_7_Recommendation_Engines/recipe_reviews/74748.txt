This was fantastic!!  I grilled these, which took about 15 minutes longer than broiling since the temperature wasn't as high.  They were perfect!  I did add some thyme and sage to the stuffing, which complimented the other ingredients well.  Thanks for this excellent recipe!  I will use it for Cornish game hens also.

The stuffing definitely needed some work; the flavors were there, but sense quail is so tiny, there's not much substance to the bird so I was looking for more substance in the stuffing.  I took the recommendation of adding sage and thyme, but also substituted finely chopped walnuts in place of the carrots and used half the amount of parsley.  I substitued bread crumbs for a stuffing mixture and added an extra tablespoon.  Also, instead of brushing the quail with bacon drippings, I wrapped the stuffed quail in bacon before broiling.
