Three stars as written--just boring and needing something---like maybe flavor. I had to doctor this up BIG time to make this more than simply blah and forgettable. Instead of bottled ranch dressing, I made a chipotle mayo. In addition to the bacon, I added grilled shrimp, but this would have been very good with the addition of grilled chicken breast as well.  Good starting point, but this needed some serious kicking up.

OH MAN...these were AWESOME!!!  I didn't have the ranch dressing so I used the herbed mayo mixture from "Mama's Best Broiled Tomato Sandwich" also on this site..(it's delicious)!  I used turkey bacon cooked in the microwave and mashed my avacado so I could spread it over the tortilla.  Will definitley be making this again.  Thanks Christina B.

These were yummy - my husband loved them. Cooking the bacon was messy, but the bacon was the best part, and the tortillas made them so easy to eat. I'll definitely make them again!

Great for lunch!  I didn't crumble the bacon, left it in slices. I smashed up the avacado and spread that on the tortilla then layered the rest of the ingredients.  I added a little Cheddar cheese and left the ranch dressing on the outside to dip the wrap into.  Overall, very good and very easy.

I love wraps and BLTs, but the chunks of avocado were just too much.  For my veggie hating boyfriend I mushed up a little and blended it with the ranch.  The tasted quite a bit better this way.  You have to LOVE avocados for this.

I did things a bit differently...I used an herb flatbread instead of the flour tortilla.  I also added some fresh mozzarella cheese.  Really good stuff and very easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe.

I did alter this recipe just a little. Instead of tortillas I used pita (warmed in the microwave 15 sec for easy wrapping and pliability), instead of shredded lettuce I used 1 large lettuce leaf to line the pita so it wouldn't get soggy, and instead of ranch dressing I used my homemade taziki sauce.  We absolutely LOVED these! I never would've thought of putting avocados in your basic BLT. Thanks for the inspiation, Christina!

GREAt Idea! We left out the Avacodo cause noone here likes it but this is a GREAT Idea cause we have small children...they will eat almost anything as long as it's Wraped.

I'm giving this a 5, but only with the use of herbed mayo instead of ranch. I think the ranch could overwhelm this sandwich, so I made my own herb mayo with: fresh chives, basil and parsley; a bit of lemon juice; a pinch of sugar; salt and pepper to taste. Wow is it good! Seriously, try the mayo. If you only have one fresh herb to add, use basil, as the taste of the fresh basil with the tomatoes and bacon is heaven and part of what is really making the sandwich for me! Now if I only had a cold beer to go with.....

great recipe.  Just learned on one of the cooking shows that you cook bacon on a cookie sheet  or grilling pan in 400 degree oven around 20 minutes.  Comes out perfect with little mess. Just be sure to watch as time could vary.

My husband was disappointed I didn't make a 'large' meal and voiced his concern and questioned if these B.L.A.Ts were just the appetizer.  He doesn't like avocado, but he ate these!  And he was full after eating only two!  These made a great last minute dinner for us.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious! Thanks for the idea. I never thought Ranch dressing would taste this good on a BLT, and the addition of the avocado along with using the tortilla...well, let me just say I LOVE THEM! We'll be eating these alot more often.

Great summer recipe. Shortcut: I use precooked real crumbled bacon you can purchase in a bag. No cooking, no mess, and no heating up the kitchen on a hot day.

We modified this a bit.  We added sliced grilled chicken and shredded cheddar, left out the avocado (they're $2 for a really puny specimen right now).  Served with a fruit salad and loved it!  Looking forward to trying it as written.

I normally love avocados, but the avocados with the bacon felt a bit too heavy and fatty. Maybe I should have put more tomatoes and lettuce.

This was really good.

I changed it up a couple of ways.  Instead of using ranch dressing and diced avacado, I used spicy guacamole. It was really spicy, but really good.

I also tried frying it.  If you wrap it up like folding two ends in, and the nfolding the others over it, you can slide a toothpick (soaked in water) in to hold it together.  Then, coat the bottom of a skillet in olive oil and put it on LOW heat.  If you get it scorching hot in will burn in less than 2 seconds!  Then, just drop in the little bundle and let it brown, flip it and let the other side brown.  When you take it out, you can remove the toothpick and it will stay together.

If you brown it, you can more easily wrap it in plastic and have it for lunch another day. :)

These were really good and easy.  I used pre-cooked bacon pieces which made it even easier.

I thought adding avocados would be a great idea.  I did not, however, like the ranch wrap idea.  So, I just added avocados to the original BLT.  It was awesome.  Although I did not like the full recipe, I would never have thought of adding the avocados on my own.  So, thank you!

I make a similar BLT wrap and instead of layering the ingredients, I mix mayo (or dressing), the crumbled bacon, chopped tomatoes, and lettuce all together until well coated.  This gives it a little more blended flavor.  For an added boost, I will use a bruschetta mix of tomatoes instead of just plain tomatoes.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I also added some lettuce, used low-fat dairy, and added extra tomatoes. I didn't think though that the avacado really went with the wrap. It seemed to dominate the sandwich. The cheese gave it the flavor it needed. Ty

These wraps were delicious.  I made these twice the first time following the recipe only adding red onion.  The 2nd time I tried to make them super healthy by using turkey bacon and hummus instead of ranch and they were equally delicious!

I made these for my husband and I. Used a full tomato, 4 slices of thick hickory smoked bacon, shredded lettace and tortillas. I mashed a ripe avocado and mixed in a Tb of lemon juice and a heaping tsp of GOOD penzey's seasoning salt. penzeys makes the closest thing to fresh herbs, i highly recommend it to everyone. spread ranch on tortillas and also my avocado spread. was extrememly flavorful!!

These were good, but I'd rather have a BLAT sandwich with toasted bread. In fact, the night I made these I had a wrap, and then a sandwich. The sandwich was much tastier, IMO!

The addition of avocado makes these BLT wraps amazing! Made them with plain mayo as I didn't have any ranch dressing but I definitely want to try the recipe as is. Thanks!

Great Recipe.  It was an immediate hit with my family.  This recipe can be made with or without the avacados.  Quick Tip:  Slice bacon into small pieces before cooking.  Place in a saucepan, stir occasionally and cook until crisp, drain. I used this recipe with a customer who also gave it a thumbs up.

Superbo!  And it does indeed go perfectly with corn on the cob.  I like the Ranch suggestion over mayo.

Also, don't chimp on the bacon. :-p

I agree that the hardest part was crisping the bacon then cutting up into to bite -size pieces.  I ventured to make enough for 50 people and made some with red yellow & orange peppers to replace the bacon for the vegetarians in the bunch.  Was a great success! Added some shredded sharp cheddar for a cheezy kick to it.

This recipe was very simple but good.  Instead of making the bacon in a skillet I baked the bacon at 350 Degrees for about 15-20 minutes (till it started to look crispy on one side) then flipped it and baked for another 10-15 minutes or until crispy.

Just made this great sandwich last night and it was delightful!
I did add steamed egg with hard yoke, used an avocado tortilla and
did a wrap.  Next time will try pesto-mayonnaise instead of the ranch and some mozzarella cheese as Momof2 did.  Thanks for the recipe, Christina.  Shirlee

We have BLTs at least once a month, and we all like it different. I don't like lettuce but I add cheese. My son has BLT with cheese, my daughter adds cheese and avocado, and my fiance goes without cheese but adds avocado. I can't believe I never thought to do it as a wrap instead of a sandwich. Thanks a bunch!

I just used mayo instead of ranch. I did try with ranch and it's great, I'm just a bigger fan of mayo than ranch. Great recipe! Simple, but I wouldn't have really thought about crumbling the bacon, and I usually eat my BLTs with bread so it gave me some good ideas.

These are a regular dinner for me and my family!  Great way to get delicious vegetables.  I do double the bacon, because I'm a little naughty, but I use light ranch sauce, which probably makes no difference since I double the bacon.  So good, so quick!!!

I use the pre-cooked bacon and just heat it up for 30-45 seconds until its crispy.  I do add a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese.  This is a quick, delicious and nutritious lunch. I love it, and wish I had found it a long time ago.

If you like B.L.T you can't go wrong with B.L.A.T.  I did make some changes , I used ciabatta bread istead of the rap (I know it takes away from the healthy aspect, but its GOOOOOD). I also used an avacado spread (that I bought) instead, and I herbed some mayo instead of using ranch.

I made this the first time as is, and it was definitely good, but I made them again today and decided to add a bit to them.  My changes: I used 3 slices bacon instead of 2, add thinly sliced red onion, a handfull of shredded cheddar cheese, and a few fresh baby spinach leaves to the original ingredients.  It was SO good! I am going to make these again next week and try using grilled chicken as well as the bacon, I think these would be outstanding that way.  My sweetie devoured these!

Great wrap!  My avocado was really ripe, so I mashed it with a little lemon juice and salt, then spread it on the tortilla.  Then I added the bacon, spinach (instead of lettuce), and tomato.  Then I lightly drizzled ranch dressing on top.  Perfect for lunch!  So does the good fat of the avocado cancel out the bad fat of the bacon?  Hee, hee, one can only hope.....

These are simply put, delightful anytime of the day! I eliminated the hardship of preparing bacon by baking it in the oven in a glass casserole dish at 375 for 25 minutes, wah lah! :) Thank you!

Great recipe, quick and easy.

Use the kind of ranch dressing you make from a packet, not the pre-bottled kind. It's a lot better tasting.

Such a quick meal and very yummy. We ate these for dinner with nothing else. I don't like HIdden Valley Ranch so much, so next time I'll serve it with homemade ranch.

Made this with turkey bacon but that was really the only change. My daughter loved it. My son did not die as he was sure he would because there was avacados and my husband had nothing negative to say. In other words a winner. Thanks

This was super yummy. A good way to use up my avacado before it went bad on me. If you like BLT's you'll love this BLAT too. I added more bacon since I love bacon. I'll make this again for sure. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

What a great idea! And so easy! The only thing we did differently, because we are inherently lazy, is to replace the avacado with a zesty guacamole that we spread on the tortilla. Who would have thought smushed avacado could bring such delight to a sandwich?

We've had this recipe several times, tonight included. Tonight's were the best so far. I used spinach wraps, herbed mayo (per another reviewer's recommendations - regular mayo plus a bit of parsley, oregano and black pepper), turkey bacon (cut up in pieces, then fried the whole pkg. the leftovers freeze well and reheat in the microwave for next time!), tomatoes, lettuce, and since the store was out of avocados, I threw on some guacamole dip. It was perfect. When I have had the avocados, I do as another reviewer suggested and add a little lemon for extra zip. So yummy!

What a cool twist to the same old BLTs.  I loved these with the addition of the avocado.  I didn't use the ranch dressing, as that is not the taste that goes with BLTs....good old fashioned mayo for us!

I didn't really like the ranch - that's why I gave it 4 stars. Next time I will just use lowfat cream cheese or something else. Otherwise, fast and simple.

I really like BLT sandwiches, so I thought this would be just as good. I was a little disappointed with the flavor. I will most likely add avocados to my BLT sandwiches instead of the tortilla and ranch dressing.

I haven’t actually made a BLAT. But I have made BALTs: Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato. I’ve been making them for years and love them!  I do have to say I like my spelling of the name better! lol

I had this wrap recently at a great RI seafood restaurant.  It was a BLLAT bacon, lettuce, lobster, avocado and tomato with a lemon aioli.  It was the bomb!

I didn't have bacon or avacado but I liked the recipe so I used chorizo instead of bacon and eggs instead of avacado.

As soon as my daughter tried this, she came running to me to say "Mom, these are so fantastic!" My son and I agreed. Only change I made was to add a little smoked turkey.

This was very good.  Really liked the addition of the avocado.  Didn't have the Ranch so I just used a bit of mayo.  Didn't add any salt or pepper and enjoyed it for lunch today.  I found the bacon provided seasoning enough but probably the Ranch would have upped the ante.  Ate it up too quickly to take a picture;-)  I'll be making it again with or without the Ranch.

been doing this on 12 grain toast for a while with mayo, but I like the change.  easiest way to do bacon though is place on alum. foil in 325 degree oven for 20-25 minutes (flip over at 10 min.) and put on towels to dry - easy-pezy!

Whole family loved this recipe.  Great twist on your typical BLT.  Loved it with the avacado.  I tossed the avocado in lime juice before adding it to the wraps.

These were fantastic!  Easy and very good!  We used turkey bacon (baked in the oven @ 400). I mashed the avocado with a little sour cream mixed with Uncle Dan's powder ranch mix and spread it on whole wheat tortillas.  Great for warm weather, but I have a feeling we'll be eating them all year long.

We are in Africa right now and have lots of tomatoes and avocados.  I made home-made tortillas for the wraps and used mayonnaise and garlic salt for the sauce, no ranch here!  Very good!

What a great addition to our traditional BLT! I used garden spinach flatbread just because I had it on hand! We started with fresh cherries and added an ear of sweat corn to complete the meal.

This was a big hit with the family. A great easy Summer recipe. I didn't chop, crumble or shred the ingredients, rather layered 2 - 3" strips of bacon, sliced tomatoes, avocado pieces and one leaf of romaine lettuce. Also tried mayo vs ranch and added some pepper.

I have been making a BLAT for years now, my favorite sandwich! There is just something about avocado & bacon that works. Add tomato to the mix & your have nirvana! I still prefer the sandwich but the wrap is a good alternative. I didn't use the ranch just stuck with mayo. A 5 Star recipe all the way tho!

Great idea!  I however used what I had on hand and making this for two adults.  First, I sliced 5 pieces of bacon into 1/2 inch segments and fried them up in a pan.  Drained them on a paper towel lined plate.  I had spinach burrito size tortillas in the freezer so used them.  Next I spread the warm tortillas half side with mayo and half with guacamole.  Layered the rest of the ingredients down the middle (divided in half) and rolled up.  Served with a bowl of gazpacho that I made this morning.  Great dinner when it is 102 degrees outside.

Easy to make and very tasty.  I used Kraft Peppercorn Ranch dressing and it really added some zest.  I diced the tomatoes and crumbled the bacon and also added some more ranch on top of the veg's.

It was ok, but hey I am a mixologist!  Forget that ranch dressing.  Use a spoon of salsa mixed in a tablespoon of plain yogurt. Throw in some finely minced onion, a nacho slice, some lime and cilantro.  And if you got shrimp - oh yeah!  And I prefer the flat out roll ups to a tortilla anyday.  Wrap it in foil warm in toaster oven throw it together, re-wrap and That's! a wrap!

Fantastic idea just the way it is.  I didn't change any of the ingredients and loved this.  I used homemade ranch and gluten free piadine (no tortillas where I live).  Just a fresh tasting wrap for lunch.  My picky kids liked them a lot as well.  No doubt we will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing.

I have been doing something very similar for years on toasted bread.  We grow avocado's in Texas as well, just not as large as the California grown.  Sometimes I use guacamole instead of an avocado which works well and it adds a little bit more flavor.  Since I'm eating healthier these days, greek yogurt is a good sub for mayo.

The addition of chicken made it 5 stars. We used Flatout  flatbread and mixed salad with spinach - trying to get it as healthy as possible. I don't know why anyone would call it bland - unless they used bottled ranch dressing? The package/mayo/milk ranch gives so much more flavor
Thanks for the recipe

SO GOOD! I used Ranch Dressing II from this site because my husband loves it.  The creamy avocado with the ranch took these from boring BLTs to delicious, well, BLATs!  I baked the bacon and didn't bother to crumble them.  Great recipe for an easy yet satisfying weeknight dinner!

Delicious.  I didn't feel like making these in a wrap so I used seeded italian Bread.  I also used Hidden Valley's spicy ranch.  Hidden Valley's Spicy Ranch is my new favorite dressing !! I can't say enough good things about this.  I plan on using this dressing for taco salad.  Thanks for sharing

Yummy!! We love BLT's, so adding avocado and putting it in a wrap was even better. We really enjoyed these for a quick lunch.  We will have these often.

This was good. The ranch added a zippy taste. I still prefer the BLAT sandwich to the wrap though. The avocado can replace the mayo, making it a little healthier.

A great, easy idea for a casual dinner. Can adapt ingredients to everyone's likes and dislikes. Served with strawberry smoothies and sweet potato fries for a healthier take on fast food. Thaks for the recipe!

I LOVE avacado. What a great idea to add it to this already great combo! So yummy! I prefer Hellmans mayo to ranch dressing, so I used that instead. Turned out great! Thanks for the cool idea :)

A great simple sandwich. I use turkey bacon and smash the avocado down to a paste. Also, I've substituted blue cheese dressing when out of ranch - both are great.

These were great! I did alter the recipe a bit though. I used veggie cream cheese instead of the salad dressing and added a couple thin slices of turkey and then put only one slice of bacon on each tortilla. Will definitely make again!

Really really good.  I used whole wheat tortilla and turkey bacon to make a little healthier.  I will use 2 or 1/2 avacados next time.  I will make this again and again

Great idea. I made it last night and loved it. I mean one really can't go wrong with any of these ingredients. Since I love love love avacados, this recipe was a must try. I also added red onions because I just love red onions on any sandwich. Magnifique ! ! !

I make these a lot now- they are very tasty. The only thing I do different is use a pita instead of a tortilla. I microwave it for 20 seconds to get it nice and warm then add everything else. I also like to add cheddar cheese. YUM!

My husband really liked this recipe. I am a big BLT fan but I didn't really care for it so much with the ranch taste. I might try some other type of spread next time. Other than that, it was pretty good.

I took another poster's idea and blended Ranch Mix with Cream Cheese and used to hold the wraps shut. Works like a charm. Super easy to make if you use microwave bacon or even pre cooked bacon which only takes 30 seconds to a minute to heat up.
