Some suggestions for this recipe:
You can subsitute 1/2 white sugar for brown sugar which makes them tastier!
Use unsalted butter instead of butter. Which gives you the real great taste of the cookie without tasting too buttery. You can add another 1/2 cup of flour, to make the dough stay in shape better and not too sweet for those who does not like it too sweet. You can bake it longer for more crispy cookies and shorter for crispy edges and chewy middles!!

If you're looking for a crispy cookie, this recipe is a very good choice.  The texture is perfect, smooth and not too crispy but not soft either.  I have tried over 40 CC cookie recipes, and this is one of the few chocolate chip cookie recipes that I am really pleased with.  However, I would omit the salt and I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar.

Nice cookie --  much too hard (the next day) for my taste, though.  When I read "crisp" I thought of a thin crispy wafer kind of thing, but this was much more like a Chips Ahoy kind of chunky thing.

These cookies were supposed to be for our church bazaar... I made them several days in advance.... they never made it to the bazaar!!  I only made one change: I used brown sugar in place of half of the white sugar. I think it added a nice flavor you can't get from plain white sugar. Crispy/chewy because of the higher sugar, lower egg content; rich because of the walnuts. Mmmmm!

Excellent cookies. Very crisp with that peculiar taste that I love. Not too sweet either. They don't have brown sugar, so if you're looking for that classic chocolate chip cookie taste, this won't deliver. Still, it's a wonderful cookie with a flavor I haven't found in any of my cookie recipes before. I also found that the cookies ran together, which I didn't mind, but, if you do, make sure you place them far apart on the cookie sheet!

These cookies sure are giant, but they're too greasy, too thin and too hard!  I only made half the batch and all the cookies flattened to a thin paper so it covered the whole cookie sheet, only thing that was 3-d still were the chips itself!  I still have 1/2 the other batch, I might try adding more flour to try to save it, but I'm definitely not trying this again.

I halved this recipe just to try it out - i should have greased the pan even though the recipe says not to bc the cookies were stuck to the pan and tooo thin.  I'm not a master chef or anything so it could have been my fault but it was a disappointment after all the time i put in.

I found these cookies to be PERFECT but for those who want a softer cookie use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  It also helps to store them in a plastic zip loc bag.

This is the best cookies that I've tasted.  I have made them twice so far. The first time I used 1 cup white  1/2 cup brown. The second time time I used 1 cup brown  1/2 cup white. This produced cookies with a slightly chewy center.  I didnt change anything else in the recipe. They spread beautifully & makes 24 big cookies. Next time I will stick to 1 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown because I love my cookies crispy. Just wonderful!

I got this recipe from a ladies's magazine in about 1980 when Mrs. Fields was all the rage.  These are better than hers -- and tons better than the regular Toll House Cookies which are limp and flat because they have too much brown sugar.     What I really like is a crisp cookie, like this recipe. So when I want a little taste of brown sugar, I substitute just 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar with 1/4 cup of light brown sugar. They still come out nice and crisp!  To make into "pan" or bar cookies,  press the dough into a buttered 10x16 oblong baking dish, bake in moderate oven until golden brown, cool, then cut into squares or bars.

Usually I like a soft chocolate chip cookie, but there are times when I want a crisp, melt-in-your-mouth buttery chocolate chip cookie.  For those times I make this cookie.  It is so delicious.  I have made this recipe many times and I have noticed that if I don't take my time and really mix in the baking soda that I can taste it coming through in the cookie.  That is my mistake, however and not a result of this recipe or instructions.  Other than that, they always turn out wonderful!

These were exactly the cookies I was looking for.  I used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1 1/4 sugar.  I wanted a cookie that was crisp and not because they were burnt.  These were great.  They were definitely not soft and chewy.  I will be making them a lot.

This was the first time I was able to make a crisp chocolate chip cookie.  Yippee. I made them exactly as the recipe said.  If you bake them large..they are great but a bit sweet.  I will cut the sugar next time. If you make them small cut the sugar and add a bit more flour as they get quite thin and flat.  But if you love a crispy chocolate chip cookie...you have come to the right place.

Since this was the first time I used this recipe, I followed it as stated, except I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans.  I am so happy I found a crisp cookie recipe.  They have a wonderful butter flavor.  These are perfect if you are a dunker.  We dunked them in milk, but I'm sure they would be great with a latte as well.

The absolute BEST cripsy choc chip cookie ever. I have been making this for about 25yrs until I lost the recipe. For the past few times, I've made the chewy, soft tollhouse type, which I really don't like. Finding this recipe again, which I could tell because it's the only one w/o brown sugar, was a blessing. I ran out of sugar so I used 1c white and 1/4 brown and it turned out crispy as ever. Delicious!

These cookies were great!  I used unsalted butter and added some peanut butter chips because I didn't have many chocolate chips. I left them in a bit longer to get nice and dark brown on the bottom. I love crunchy choco chip cookies.  Thanks for the recipe!

uh-oh! These are TOO GOOD. Like some, I substituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar. I couldn't imagine a chocolate chip cookie without my favorite ingredient in it. I made them without chips, as preferred by my birthday boy and they were perfectly round, perfectly large and perfectly delicious! Right amount of chewy and crispy. AAA+

I did a few alterations to these cookies and they turned out wonderful!  I used 1 3/4 cups of flour instead of 2 cups, added a tablespoon of unsweeted applesauce, omitted the walnuts and only cooked them for 11 minutes.  I think the reason they might have turned out hard with others is that they were being overcooked at the 20-23 minutes. Thanks so much for sharing Patricia.

Awesome!!  These cookies were SO tasty!  I tried baking them for the full 20 minutes and they came out really crip, and burnt.  I cut the baking time down to about 12 minutes and they came out perfect, crispy and a bit chewy in the middle.  My whole family really dug them.

Best Chocolate Chip Cookies I ever made!  I think I have tried hundreds of recipes looking for that perfect cookie.  Well this is it!  The holy grail of chocolate chip cookies!  I love mine crispy and this is just perfect.  I took others advice and added no salt, since I didn't have unsalted butter.  Also, used 1 cup white sugar and ¼ c light brown sugar.  I had dark chocolate chips, so I used those.  That made the cookies not too sweet; perfect!  I baked about ¼ the recipe immediately and froze the rest in individual balls on a parchment covered cookie sheet.  When frozen I put them in a ziploc freezer bag to cook later.  Works great.

I made this recipe exactly as written and I didn't care for this recipe.  When the cookies cooled they were hard.  My 13 year old daughter said they tasted like sugar cookies with chocolate chips and I am going to have to agree with her.  They didn't taste like any chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted.  I'm sorry but I won't be making this recipe again.

I followed this recipe exactly.  My cookies spread and became very brittle.  I will say, the unusual flavor, that other reviewers have mentioned, tastes to me like popcorn!  But in a really good way.  That is why I am giving it 4 stars.

These cookies are wonderfully crisp--just what I wanted.  I took suggestions and changed the sugar to 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I used chopped pecans because I do not like walnuts.  I also made them in one inch balls and baked for 15 minutes.  PERFECT!!!!!!!

Very yummy and crisp. I had no issues with making these other than messing around on the exchange and not keepin an eye on my first batch resulted in burnt cookies, lol. The next 2 batches came out just fine tho. Make sure and give them plenty of room to do there thing as they do get giant!!

I am hoping I'm missing something here. I did everything as stated in the recipes. Exact ingredients, preparation, and temperature. Yet these things are burned at half the cook time.

This is the best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe that I have ever made. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp and substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar and reduced the baking time to 18 minutes. These cookies are crispy and tasty

Delicious cookie.  Next time I will make them smaller and reduce the baking time.   Followed recipe, but the baking time over baked the cookies.  Very hard.  Did anyone else have that problem?

delicious...i have a staple CCC recipe but I like to change it up a bit. I did use 1/2 cup brown sugar and chopped but bittersweet chocolate chunks mixed in with semi sweet. Baked for less time  then suggested. Omitted Walnuts. MMM good

I made these using Crisco Butter-Flavored Shortening.  While they didn't turn out big and flat, they were fluffy/crispy (if that makes any sense?).  Very delicious!

These were really good, but there is nothing unique about them. They're just like all the other chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted. I change the recipe a bit to 3/4 c sugar and 3/4 c brown sugar.

This is the best crispy chocolate chip cookie that I have ever made. I've baked so many batches of these cookies that I've lost count already. I made a few amendments to the original recipe. I used 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour so that the cookie doesn't turn out flat. However, creaming the butter well would only require an addition of 1/4 to 1/3 cup flour. To make it less sweet, I used 3/4 cup mix of white and brown sugar. Salt is reduced to 1/2 teaspoon or less. One point to take note is to never use large eggs or the cookie would spread too much and the cookie turns out flat which looks awful.Use regular sized eggs. I also made my cookies smaller. I shaped/rolled the dough in 1 1/2 inch balls. it turned out great and perfectly round. I baked them for the full 20-23 min. They turned out perfectly brown and crispy. This is definitely a keeper.

Another variation of the cookie is use molasses sugar and brown sugar(half half) and add a teaspoon or 2 of allspice/cinnamon. It comes out smelling like Famous Amos cookies. DELICIOUS!

Definitely different from the Toll House recipe we’re all familiar with, but that’s not a bad thing.  I like to have a variety of cookies for the holidays, and this is one of our favorites!  My daughter doesn’t like the traditional Toll House cookies because she feels like the chewy texture means they’re not “done.”  I still make the Toll House cookies, but these are a wonderful addition to the holiday cookie jar.  I first made them exactly as the recipe was written.  The second time I made them, I added a tablespoon of dry cocoa powder to the flour mixture.  We felt it was an improvement, but they’re excellent without it, too.

These cookies were very good and easy to bake.  They had a slight baking soda taste, which was not bad.  I used a level 1/4 cup measure and baked 6 cookies at a time, no problem with them running together.  I let them bake the full 20 minutes. YUM!!!  I wasn't sure how many eggs to use because the recipe said to beat in the eggs one at a time. (I used only one egg, worked out fine)  I will make these again, please pass me another cookie!!!

These were awesome! The best cookies you'll ever find! I baked mine for 15 miutes and they were crispy and light brown, yet chewy on the inside. I made 6 really huge cookies and this is definately a keeper! Thanks!

Best chocolate chip cookies ever! I did bake for 20 minutes and burned the first batch. I baked the remainder around 12 minutes and this worked. I also measure out a heaping Tab of dough  for a normal size cookie rather than making them giant. I think this would help with cookies not being so hard next day. Cookies also freeze well....

These are not like the bakery kind--THEY ARE MUCH BETTER!!!  I've been making those "Urban Legend" cookies for over 10 years, and I'm throwing away my recipe.  These are much easier to make and far superior!

I made these this afternoon and they are delicious! I was nervous about so much white sugar and no brown sugar but they turned out very very good and they really do look like bakery cookies! They are the perfect combo of crispy and chewy and a wonderful milk dunking cookie! I was looking for a little bit different chocolate chip cookie recipe just to mix it up a bit and these fit the bill! I might even use this as my main chocolate chip cookie recipe! They're truly amazing. thanks so much this is a definite keeper!

Cookie taste great but i added half cup more flour for firmness in shaping the balls and they spread a little to wide.  Otherwise fantastic.

Absolutely wonderful cookies! My fiancee only likes the crunchy cookies and these were fabulous. I took the suggestion of others and used 1/2 light brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar, and I adjusted the baking time to around 12-15 minutes. The full 20 minutes at 350 would've resulted in over-baked cookies in my oven. This recipe is a definite keeper!

My family loves these cookies!!!!  I found them to be a little too salty the first time around.  I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp.  And replaced 1/2 cup white sugar with light brown sugar per someone elses recommendation and I think it is much better.  I also use a cookie scoop that is about 1 1/2 tsps.  I reduce the cooking time to about 14 - 16 minutes to make them crispy but not crunchy!  Everyone that tries them, loves them.  Also great to make vanilla ice cream cookie sandwichs!!!  This is definately a keeper...  Thanks for sharing this recipe Patricia

These were such a big hit...I did add rice krispies to the last batch and the guys in our house loved them.  They lasted two days.
Thanks for a great recipe.

These are really perfect.I've been looking for a recipe for cookies similar to those of chips of ohoy.I don't like the chewy cookies.These are what I was really looking for.I took the advice of some reviews and used half cup brown sugar and the rest white.I also put only 1.5 cup of chips cause this was all I had.Also to make it similar to the brand I'm looking for I didn't make them giant.I made the balls like 3/4 inch or smaller and they turned out as delicious as I was hoping.Thank you for sharing this will sure be my recipe for chocolate chips cookies from now on.

This recipe was fantastic and went down very well with my family. Some notes I would make would be to leave them to cool almost completely on the pan to let them flatten, add a little more than the recommended vanilla, and lastly I used whole wheat flour instead of regular and they turned out better.

This recipe is awesome. My family goes wild for these cookies. I made my third batch today, and they came out nicely-the recipe is so reliable.  What I love about these is that the cookie is like a bakery cookie-chewy and crispy. And it has that 'dry' bakery style texture that I really like. It doesn't squish between your teeth!  For those who are having trouble with your cookies spreading out too much-your butter isn't cold enough. I use my butter straight out of the fridge.   I saw the one suggestion to use half brown sugar. I tried it, but wasn't thrilled-they still tasted great, but they looked overdone. The all white sugar ones turn out beautifully.   Thanks Patricia for submitting this great recipe! A keeper!

So good! I followed the recipe pretty much as stated, using unsalted butter. I rolled my cookies into larger-sized balls (at least 2 inches), which yielded only 9 cookies instead of 12 for the half-batch that I made. I cooked them about 15-16 minutes, or until just very slightly golden on the edges, and allowed the cookies to cool almost completely on the pan before removing. The result: a large, delicious cookie that was soft in the center, and perfectly crisp on the edges; sweet, with only the very very slightest hint of saltiness from the baking soda and salt. So good!

I got rave reviews from everyone except my daughter, who was expecting a chewier cookie...did not add the walnuts, but instead mixed in 1/2 cup ground pecans into the batter for extra richness

These cookies are very addicting and hard to stop eating.  The only problem is they don't flatten on the pan by themselves.

I made these because I was craving chocolate chip cookies and didn't have any brown sugar.
My cookies turned out pretty big. They spread out very nicely, but almost too much so I need to roll the balls smaller next time.
It's a very sweet crunchy cookie with  a grainier texture. They do remind me of bakery cookies, but I think I prefer softer cookies with crisp edges rather than the whole cookie being crunchy. Not my favorite, but it's not bad.

Excellent yet simple recipe. It took so little time and turned out so good. I only didnt get the cookies to be "giant"- but will try again to see if that works out. 
The recipe was a delight to try out. Thank you for sharing it!!

These cookies were pretty easy to make and tasted great coming out of the oven but they hardened overnight and were way to crunchy for me the following day.  Probably wouldn't make again as I prefer chewy cookies.

The best! I am not a fan of the common, Toll House typr chocolate chip cookies. We have a bakery down the street that has big, crisp cookies like this and I have such a weakness for them. Well, they are $1.75 each there and I made this recipe EXACTLY the way it is written with no modifications and THESE ARE BETTER THAN MY BAKERY DOWN THE STREET!!!! These are the BEST!

A bit too crisp.  I tried to reduce the cooking time but they still turned out to hard on the teeth.  As a new cook if I knew what in the recipe made them so crunchy I would reduce that item.

These cookies were way to SWEET!  I don't think you can put less sugar in though or it would change the consistency of the cookie.  True to their name, they were crispy, just not good.

Used shortening instead of butter, and accidently added too much water.  Didn't seem to make a difference.  Cookies turned out crispy just was I wanted.  Cookie dough was a little bland. Might add more vanilla next time.

If you're looking for a buttery crispy chocolate chip cookie, this is it!!!    I'm so happy to find a recipe that makes them like this, every time.   I used 3/4 brown,3/4 white sugar, and cooked for 11 minutes.    Then added some chopped pecans to second half of dough and made some chocolate pecan cookies baked @ 12 minutes.  These are wonderfully crispy and warm right out of the oven.  Yay!      :+)

in an attempt to make a softer, chewier cookie as opposed to the described crispy/hard cookie i followed another reviewer's advice and used 1¾ c. flour instead of 2, and baked for 13 minutes instead of 20. they get wonderfully thin and huge, and have a great buttery taste with crispy/chewy texture, but the crispier parts tasted like buttered popcorn at times. perhaps using less salt/unsalted butter as others have suggested would help. and they do get pretty crispy pretty fast, but cooking for less time and immediately storing them in a sealed container helps keep them chewier.

I got this recipe in 1981 in Better Homes & Gardens magazine, and since then I am wearing about 50 extra pounds, due to these cookies.  These are SO GOOD, it's the only cookie my family will let me bake, since 1981.

Fantastic cookie!  I was hesitant when I noticed there was no brown sugar in this recipe, but the CFO of my company is a fan of CRISPY cookies so I gave this a try.  HUGE, huge hit!  Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

I was looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe that didn't require brown sugar because I didn't have any, and came across this recipe which looked promising.

I have never tried a chocolate chip cookie that I didn't like...until I had these.

First off, they're really crispy because they're so flat, which really wasn't so bad. The bad part is that mine came out really salty. I mean REALLY salty. I'm not sure why no one else seemed to have this problem. I measured everything exactly as it listed. My four year old didn't even finish his cookie and I didn't bother making the whole batch.

these are really crispy and chewy.  they harden a little after being cooled, and my kids stopped eating them after they had a nibble.  i divided the batter in two - one had chocolate chips (for kids), and the other had only nuts (for husband).  it's weird because the ones with the nuts, stayed soft and i baked them the same time and took them out the accordingly.  - although the dough was amazingly delicious, i will not be making this again.

After reading so many good reviews, I gave these a try.  They were mediocre at best.  If you like thin and flat cookies without much flavor, then these are for you!

We are out of brown sugar and my son really wanted chocolate chip cookies.  We came across this recipe and I'm so glad we did!  These cookies are amazing and perfect for dunking in milk!  Very buttery and crispy!  We omitted the walnuts and made the balls bigger, since I read in other reviews that these can be thin.  Have saved this one to my recipe box and will definately be making again!  Thanks!

I searched for this recipe as my boyfriend doesn't like "soft" cookies???  He said these were really good.  Out of the oven, they were fine but I thought they seemed to taste stale the next day. Not bad but not my favorite.

These were very yummy.  I used less chocolate and no walnuts.  Use a medium sized scoop for perfect cookies.  Mine were done in 15 minutes.

I have tried dozens upon dozens of chocolate chip cookie recipes looking for one that closely matched my great-grandmothers chocolate chip cookie recipe...This is it...I have FINALLY found it! I did substitute half the sugar for light brown sugar...And I didn't have any butter on hand so I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (margarine)...They came out perfectly...No complaints from me...Fantastic tase and texture...Not too sweet...Crispy outside and chewy inside...I did burn the 1st batch...20 minutes was way too long in my oven...Cooked them only 13 minutes...This is the ONLY recipe I will ever make again! Thank you!!!!

they didn't turn out very big, too crunchy and the second batch burned even though I only cooked them for 15 min.  I don't think I'll make these again.

I made these a couple of times.  The first  time they came out too crispy but very good nonetheless. Last night I chilled the dough a bit and made the balls of dough three inches in size rather than two. They didn't get so flat and came out perfectly, crunchy on the edges and soft in the middle. I ended up with fifteen cookies instead of the two dozen. Next time I will add more walnuts. I'm happy with this recipe.

Holy Cow!  These turned out fantastic!  My flour and chocolate chips were both cold (it's been hot, so I've been keeping them in the freezer and fridge, respectively), so that may have helped stop any spreading out.  I also made them a bit smaller than the recipe.  Whatever it was, they stayed really moist in the center and got a touch crispy at the outside edge.  Yum!

By the time I had put all the nuts and chocolate in, I was worried, as they wouldn't stick together.  When they came out, they didn't look cooked.  
Forget all that.  They were great!!  I used pecans instead of walnuts.

I first came across this recipe in a magazine.  Since 1981, it's the only cookie my family and friends will let me bake!!!  This recipe is the absolute BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe ever.  Highly recommended.

These wre FANTASTIC.  Because I live at 4,000 feet I used about 1/4 cup less flour and half the baking soda.  I also used dark chocolete chips instead of semi-sweet ones, which gave them a more adult-taste.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

I've made these cookues several times and they always turn out the same.  Crispy.  I think it's from using only white sugar and not brown.  This is a great recipe, thank you.

I have been looking for a crisp chocolate chip cookie and this is it!  I will only be using this recipe from this point forward.  I did substitute macadamia nut and white chocolate with equally good results.  The taste is so rich and good.

These are super simple and quick to make. They present beautifully. But they are very one dimentional in flavour. 
I would spend the extra minute on a recipe that deepens the flavours.

I didn't roll them into small balls they were a bit bigger and I used cookie cutters to make them. I also added the chocolate chips and then melted the butter. When I put the melted butter on the chocolate chips it made them mushier and the dough a little more chocolatey. The cookies were a little crumbly and fantastic

Tastes great! I made these cookies with half white and half light brown sugar because it tastes better, but also because all white sugar makes a flatter (and sometimes harder) cookie.  I also added just a quarter cup of flour (instead of the half mentioned at the end, in addition to the 2  cups) and it was perfect.

I liked this recipe since the cookies were as described. However, I  made a smaller batch with 1 cup flour. I  used only half cup white sugar since my chocolate chips were sweet. Seeing a previous review,  I baked for a while to get the crunchy texture. I felt I should reduce the butter by a table spoon or so,  since the cookie was actually giant size and slightly buttery. But overall it was good. I ll try again hopefully soon.

I love these cookies.  They’re large (unless you make them smaller).  They’re crisp (unless you make them softer).  Follow the recipe for large crisp cookies (or modify to your taste preferences).

The taste is good but mine did not flatten out. I am not sure if it is our elevation, or maybe it was something else but i was sad they didn't flatten out like in the picture. but i just finished the dough off by making regular sized cookies and there was no disappointment there.

They tasted fine but making them was a painThe dough was crumbly and hard to roll into balls. The dough also did not spread to become flat on the pan and resulted in thick piles. These chunks made it hard for them to cook evenly. I would not make these again.

I also substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar vs. white for a bit more depth of flavor.  These are a classic!  My kids prefer them softer, so you can bake for approximately 14 minutes if you also like a softer cookie.   I love both!

Loved, Loved, Loved it!  I was looking for a real crispy Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and this was just perfect.  Although I did not make them ginormous size, they were so crispy when they cooled, I was in heaven.  They were pretty sweet, maybe a little too sweet, I might cut down slightly on the sugar next time, but this recipe is a real gem. Thank you so much!

This is a winner with my teenage and almost teenage grandkids! I make smaller cookies (heaping teaspoon) per cookie. I place them 2" apart and bake them for 10-12 min. or until golden. Making them today for grandson's 19th birthday dessert.

This is it! This is the recipe my Mom used when she brought me cookies at college in 1981. They were a BIG hit with fellow classmates, and I made lots of friends as a result ;-) I am making these for the first time in 20 years to bring to a family gathering tomorrow. I am checking the reviews/tips here since the batter (currently in the fridge) is a bit goopier than I recall. Fingers crossed that these are as good as I remember!

There are too many ooey goey chewy cookie recipes out there. This is what I was looking for - a crispy cookie! It did not come out too flat, it was not cakey and not rock hard! It needed an extra 1 cup of flour (because I live in a hot & humid country, cookie dough never forms a dough unless I add more flour) and refrigeration. I flattened them out to about 1/4 of an inch before baking. They only took about 10 mins.

It's a little too buttery and oily for my taste. Maybe next time, I'll also lessen the sugar and choco chips to make it less sweet.

I've made these twice now, the first time with real unsalted butter and they were FANTASTIC!!  The second time I  used margarine and they were definitely not the same and not as good.  With real butter I give them five stars!!  delicious light crunchy cookies.  Very much like the ones made by my favorite bakery.

Crispy bakery cookies; exactly what it says!! Fantastic recipe! My oven always cooks fast & hot so I actually took mine out in 16 min; so of course know how your oven cooks and time accordingly!! If you're expecting these "crispy" cookies to be soft and cakey; they won't be!! They are an addicting crispy buttery YUMMY bakery style cookie!

Great! I've always loved soft cookies, but after making these, I'm a convert! Thanks for sharing! Btw, I don't know what people are complaining about. These cookies are supposed to be crispy. It's in the title.

These cookies are awesome!  I didn't realize how fantastic they were until I made cookies using another recipe (the one on the back of the Nestle Toll House semi sweet morsels package).  Not only do these cookies taste fantastic, they are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  The only thing I changed was instead of using all white sugar, I used half white and half light brown sugar.  BTW, some people complained about the cookies getting hard - they're not hard but crispy which is how they're supposed to be - it's in the title of the recipe.

YUMMMMMMMMMMM, these are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made. A bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I follow the recipe exact using one egg.

Not impressed at all. I agree with someone else who said that they went flat and were too thin. My mother in law liked the taste, but they look terrible. I will continue my search for the perfect CC cookie, that tastes and looks presentable.

The best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made.  I only added a smidge more flour and I found out at the last minute that I had no vanilla extract so I substituted almond extract.  Crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle.  Yummmm!

In the 'ingredients' section, the recipe calls for 1 (one) egg.  In the 'directions' section, it says to 'add eggs one at a time'!! So do I add only one egg or two or more eggs!  Come on, give me a break!  
I made the recipe two times; once with one egg and the second time with two eggs.  I would suggest two eggs.  I also revised the menu and added bananas and transformed the cookies into banana (bread) (cake)?  Why?  Because the cookies were like bread.  My mistake was to stack them!  When they cooled, I couldn't peel them apart!  Hence, banana bread!

My son aged 9 and my nephew aged 6 made these today and were really proud of themselves. They were very easy to bake. I didn't find them crisp apart from round the edges but that is how the family prefer them. Excellent for children to bake.

Delicious taste but the cookies were so large that they expanded into each other while cooking.  It was more like a full length cookie sheet, but it was sure delicious!
