This cake is so delicious, great for chocolateholics.  We love this recipe and the best thing is that its guilt free dessert.  I replaced a quarter of the flour with soy flour.  We serve it with whipped cream, delicious.

I have to say i doubted this recipe at first. I had to bake a cake for a baby shower and she is diabetic so i had no choice. It came out amazing! I did not follow the recipe exactely. Instead of coffee i did one cup of warm water and added a box of sugarfree chocolate instant pudding mix it came out so moist.

Having never baked with Spenda before, I was a bit hesitant to try anything.  However, after reading all 31 reviews I did, and the cake is fantastic!  I upped the cocoa just a bit, and all that comes through is the chocolate flavor with just the right amount of sweetness.  I suppose I don't have a reason to use regular sugar again!

This is, by far, one of the BEST chocolate cakes I have ever had! I followed the recipe exactly, and baked it in a bundt pan. The batter was very thin and I was worried how it would turn out...no worries, it was FANTASTIC! I will make this again and again and again!

I followed directions to a t.  Cake turned out great!  Good consistency, and plenty of pure chocolate flavor.  I am going to try next time with dark chocolate cocoa.

It looked and tasted good.  The only downside was the consistancy was a bit spongy

Followed the recipe to the T. The batter was very thin, and the cake came out real gooey and tough. Should there be more flour in this recipe? That was a lot of waste. Happycamper9

Awsome!!! I have made this cake 3 times and each time I have put my own twist on it. I use diffrent extracts to change the flavor a little. Once I used vanilla. One I used almond. Once I used Orange. Then I used the smooth chocolate icing recipe and used the diffrent extracts. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!

I cook for a living; partly for diabetics, and I was thrilled with this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it turned out fantastic.  Nobody guessed it was a diabetic cake, and everyone who tried it thought it was great..very light and moist.

THIS CAKE TURNED OUT OK. I WAS LOOKING FOR A CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT CAKE AND THE OTHER OF THE SAME NAME WAS NOT SO GOOD. I MADE THIS ONE WITH HAZELNUT CREAM COFFEE AND THEN USED UNSWEETENED APPLESAUCE AND 2% MILK IN PLACE OF THE BUTTERMILK. IT CAME OUT A LITTLE HEAVY BUT THE TASTE WAS BETTER.

I tried my hand at this one for a special occasion.  My husband loved them, i wasn't so thrilled, i thought the cake itself tasted a little like chocolate cardboard, so i made cupcakes, hollowed out the center and added a little sugar free canned cherries and topped it off with a frosting of whipped cream mixed with a little splenda, cocoa powder and vanilla...they were much better that way.  next time i might try adding a bit more sugar and maybe some cinnamon to the recipe (or cinnamon flavored coffee)

AWESOME! I was looking for the perfect birthday cake for my husband becauae he doesn't eat sugar. last year's cake was a bomb (the Mocha-Chocolate one). My father-in-law is also diabetic and he loved it! Everyone asked for the recipe. I made a sugar-free pudding/cream cheese frosting but I think I will serve it with fresh whipped cream next time.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out well.  Both the texture and taste of the cake would allow it to pass as a "regular" cake.  One guest said that it tastes a bit like a Ding Dong (the Hostess cake).  I will probably try making cupcake with this recipe.

I had to change this a bit so my hubby could eat it. I used non dairy buttermilk by adding 4 tsp. lemon juice to 2 cups of soymilk and added just 1 1/4 cups of that  and left the salt out. It came out great.

this is a good tasting chocolate cake, very moist. It didn't rise as much as I would like but it was ok. I put the cream cheese frosting on it that is on the pumpkin cake recipe which was a nice addition. I also made the pumpkin cake which had a wonderful spice flavor and was also very moist
