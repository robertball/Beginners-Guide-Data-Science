I've made this recipe twice in the last month and we just love it!  The instant pot makes it so easy.  The only change I made the second time around was to cut the beans back by half a cup (this seemed to make the bean consistency less tough), increased the broth by a quarter cup and used a mixture of chicken breast and thighs.  The flavor of this is amazing and it's just so hearty and perfect for chilly weather days!

Made this chili for the first time for a church chili contest.  Won 1st place.  I did mix it up just a little, I used the insta-pot to pressure soak the beans (2 cups of water per 1 cup of beans cooks for 4 minutes, let pressure go out naturally), They say this is the same as overnight soaking.  I added some canned chunk tomato and a little turmeric for color, and I used chicken tenderloins you can buy in bulk from Costco.

Since our instantpot is the 3 quart size, I cut the recipe in half.  I found that after cooking there were way too many beans and they were undercooked.   Maybe because of the surplus of beans, the chili was too thick.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and pressure cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  It came out perfectly!  The chili isn't spicy at all, but has a very nice flavor.  I will definitely make it again, with 1/3 less beans, and I'll bump up the cooking time to an hour.

I already suspected that this recipe may need to be tailored for the 3-Qt IP so I reduced the amount of chicken as well as the beans (by about 3/4c.  I used all of the chilis and the enchilada sauce.  I only used about 1-1/4 c of broth.  Did not make any adjustments to the cooking time.  Most of the beans were done; some were still a little crunchy in the middle so I, too, will add on a few more minutes to the cook time.

It was very flavorful and we'll be making it again.

Made this for my husband for Sunday dinner and we loved it.  We have an InstaPot but I decide to use the slow cooker.  Followed the recipe and used some of the suggestion from the reviews.  The flavor was prefect, the cilantro wax a nice touch. I will keep this recipe in my favorites and we’ll make it again.  As a treat I made my own homemade tortilla to eat with the chili.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 2 1/4 C of chicken broth and decreased the beans to 1 1/2 cups.  This chili recipe was easy and absolutely delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is very tasty- the salsa and chilis give it zest without being hot. Next time I will use orzo or rice instead of the beans. Held back the fifth star because it was a real gasser!

I do not have an Instant Pot. I made it on stovetop with regular pot. First, I baked half a large seasoned chicken breast(bone-in, skin-on); shredded & chopped & added to soup. I used 3 cans of beans (a variety, Northern, black & light kidney).  Added a few red pepper flakes & chili powder.  Yummy!

I just got an Instant Pot for Christmas and wanted to try it out.  This was very easy and very good.  Will definitely make it again.  I did follow the suggestions for adding a little more time to be sure that the beans were tender.

I was going to make this for my family but they are spice babies so I made it for a chili cook off. The only thing I changed was the natural release time on the end. I let it release for an hour because I started drinking and forgot about it. I placed third so I am not sorry about anything.

Great but tools others advice and halved the beans and added 1/4 cup of broth. Even my picky father raved about it...that’s saying something!

This recipe is so good. I used my 8 qt Instant Pot and adjusted the recipe for 12. I reduced the beans, as recommended, and increased the time to 1.5 hrs. I let it naturally release for 25 minutes and it was perfect. I garnished the bowls with the recommended garnishes and crushed cantina chips. The family loved it and asked to add it as a keeper!

Delicious recipe. We like beans so I kept the amount of beans the same and increased the amount of chicken broth. Very flavorful. Will definitely make this again.

The beans were just a little underdone so I would increase the time by just about 5 minutes.

I made this last night and we really enjoyed it!  It was very simple and the flavors were delicious. My only concern was that I am super sensitive to salt and all of the green enchilada sauce I could find was loaded with sodium!  I reduced the amount of sauce to 2/3's to try and cut back on the salt.  I will make again but will look for a home made recipe for the green sauce.

Great chili. Second time I made it I changed a couple of things. 
 I kept the chicken breasts whole and pulled them out after it finished and shredded the chicken.  Also, I added medium and hot hatch chilies so it had a little heat (no heat the first batch with mild chilies).   Still what I consider mild, but better flavor.  I have an off brand "instant pot" so I have to up the times.  I cook it for 60 minutes so the white beans are done.  your mileage will vary.

Really good! Used navy beans bc that is what I had on hand and I only had 1 can of chopped chilis . Soaked them for about 6-8 hours and they were done perfectly using the recipe’s time. Made some trader joe cornbread to go along with it; could also serve over rice or orzo but also good on its own.

I followed the recipe exactly. The beans were still pretty toothsome after the 25 minute rest in a good way. . I loved this!  I only added a dash of hot sauce and the cheese and cilantro when serving. Delicious.

This was a comforting soup.  I left out the chicken, as I'm vegetarian, and the chillies as I'm a mild kind of person, and it was a great, hearty bean soup.  I used white navy beans that I think are the same as northern beans?  Trying to eat more beans since they're so good for you.  This is now my white bean soup.  Sorry, should've taken a pic.  Maybe next time.  Oh, and I just used a regular ol' pot, no Instant Pot.

Pretty good, but soak the beans first and then rinse.  You can soak overnight and into the next day, or bring to full rolling boil boiling for one minute, cover and let rest for one hour - then rinse beans again.

A great classic improved with dry beans vs canned and the pressure cooker. This recipe is delicious.
