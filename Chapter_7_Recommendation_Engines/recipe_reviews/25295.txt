Okay, as long as you like processed cheese.  I used twice the amount of pasta called for and used scoobi-do pasta instead of rigatoni -- it had just the right amount of sauce.

Great recipe. I used mild mexican flavored Velveeta.  Had plenty of bite to it, was not bland.  Velveeta also melts smooth with no lumps in it.    This recipe is great if you love cheese.  A great way to add vegetable to a kids diet.

Ok I guess. My son, who loves mac-n-cheese wouldn't try it because of the veggies. The processed cheese clumped together, but the garlic and soy was a nice touch.

This was bad. My kids refused to eat it, and I couldn't blame them. The processed cheese was way too overpowering and stuck everything together in huge clumps. Stick with mac 'n' cheese and add a few veggies for a much more palatable dish with real cheese.

This recipe was simple, it was average tasting, even after I'd added salt and pepper and a tablespoon of butter to the mix.  I did enjoy the slight edge that was given with the soy sauce.  I'll make this dish again, but not often I don't think.

This wasn't too bad.  I think it would be better with fresh veggies instead of frozen.  Might try again with the fresh veggies.  Thanks!

This is a good recipe!  It was very easy to make and a nice change.  It was also convenient because I already had all of the ingredients.

Excellent if you love velveeta.  I don't, but my husband and kids really liked it.  I used vegetable rotini.

This was easy, quick and good. I really liked the way the soy sauce added an extra zing. I also added thyme and rosemary, and I used thin spaghetti. Good recipe for when you are in a hurry!
