We really liked this soup. I followed the reicpe ALMOST as written. I took the advice of the prvious reviewer and roasted the drumsticks first and left them whole. I used vegetables I had on hand: carrots, onions, broccoli slaw, tomatoes, kale, napa cabbage & dill and cooked just until al' dente. I did not add the rice. Very refreshing and bright taste. Lots of nice crunchy veggies.

I give this recipe three stars. It is not the best I have had. You might want to try roasting the chicken legs first, with a little seasoning. And then simmering the chicken and the bones in the broth, for a more flavorful stock base. I would also sautee the veggies first too.
