Very tasty! The caramel glaze puts this over the top. I followed others' suggestions and used half white/half brown sugar and half oil/half applesauce. I have also made the Cinnamon Swirl Bundt Coffee Cake that is on this website, and found it to be delicious as well, so I used the "swirl" part of that coffee cake in this one! It's so easy - mix up 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 T cinnamon. Fill the Bundt pan with half of the cake mix. Sprinkle the sugar/cinnamon mix on top, then top off with the other half of the cake mix. It makes a nice sugary spicy ribbon through an already delectable coffee cake.

This is probably the best coffee cake that I have ever made. It's so incredibly moist. I made it on a Tuesday and on Thursday it was like I had made it that day. 

The only thing that I changed was I put in one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar (instead of 2 cups of white) to get more of a caramel flavour. Oh and I added a tsp of cinnamon!

Mmm.  I had the most delicious apple cake with a warm caramel sauce on it about 8 years ago and have dreamed of it ever since.  I think I found it!   This recipe is gold.  I used Braeburn apples, which have a thinner skin, so I used that, and the 'more fiber' excuse to not peel the apples and I can't even tell the peel is there.  Much easier.  I also took another reviewer's advice and sprinkled a mixture of sugar and cinnamon halfway thru to create that spicy ribbon.  I think it really needs this little kick, especially if you are using a milder apple like I did.  I also only used about 2 tablespoons of oil and the rest applesauce. I'm telling, you can NOT tell the difference!  The caramel sauce is tremendous.  I suggest pouring about 1/3 of it over the warm cake (I poked a few holes in the cake beforehand) and then, if you're serving it right away, drizzle the remainder over each slice.  Holy cow!   Good stuff.  Good. Stuff.

This coffee cake was awesome!  I used all applesauce instead of the oil, and it turned out great.  Even with the sauce poured on top, the coffee cake stayed good for the 4 days it lasted in my house.  I used a little less of the caramel sauce on top than the recipe called for, and there was still plenty of caramel taste.  Will definitely be making this one again!!!

Very pleased with how this cake turned out. Of course after reading other's suggestions I made a few changes. I did the following and thought it was great: I used half the amount of oil called for and substituted the rest with cinnamon apple sauce. I added half the batter to a bunt pan and than added a 1/4 c of brown sugar mixed with a tablespoon of cinnamon to create a light sugary ribbon. Topped with remaining batter and baked.

Are you really really sure it's 1-1/2 cups of vegetable oil!?!? It came out pretty greasy. 1 cup perhaps? Anyone else has idea? Subsitute with something else to help lessen use of veg oil? It taste good but seems so greasy.

Wow, this is an amazing cake! I'm very surprised at how few people have tried it; this recipe is so good!I skipped the nuts because my sister is allergic, and next time I make it I will probably sub applesauce for some oil, and maybe reduce the amount of glaze, as a lot of it ran off the sides of the cake. This recipe makes a very moist cake with a wonderful apple flavor. The glaze makes it even better! This cake is melt-in-your-mouth good!  Please try this recipe; you won't be disapointed!

Yummy! Just made this and the kids love it. The 1yr old is throwing a tantrum bc he wants more! Of course I made some alterations (dont we all?)... 1 c oil instead of 1.5, added 1/3 c cinnamon applesauce, omitted the nuts due to allergies, and made these into mini-muffins instead of a cake. Making mini-muffins makes it so much easier to pack them as a snack for the kids to bring to school, as well as, being much less messy than giving them a whole slice of cake.

This was good, but didn't get the rave reviews I expected.  I decreased the oil to 1 C. and substituted applesauce for the remaining 1/2 C. oil.  I also added 2 tsp cinnamon to the batter.  Next time I will make it in a 9x13 for convenience sake, use 3/4 C. oil and 3/4 C. applesauce. I'll also decrease the glaze by 1/2 as it was too much and went all over my serving plate.

This cake was excellent.  Everyone who had it thought it was from a local (very good) bakery.  As another reviewr did, I substituted brown sugar for half of the white, as a matter of personal preference.  I also reduced the oil to 1 c for the same reason, and it was very moist and flavorful.  Great recipe!

WOW!  This one’s a winner!  I made half the cake recipe using my 6-cup bundt pan, but only made 1/4 of the topping, which was plenty for my little cake.   The apples I chose for this were Granny Smith.  My eggs looked a little small to me, so I used 2 for my half recipe.  My cake was done in about 45 minutes.  I drizzled on the topping and noticed that as the topping cools it also thickens and adheres to the cake better.  The next day I sliced the cake into serving sizes and arranged them on a plate for Hubs to take to his buddies.  When he came home he said the guys absolutely loved this!  I had kept one piece aside for myself, covered it with plastic wrap and let it sit on the counter.  Well, I didn’t get around to trying it for two days and it was still super moist and delicious.  I will definitely be making this one again!  Thank you Ruth Turner!

While this cake is alright its not outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly and my cake was starting to burn on the edges after just 60 minutes, so be careful of the cooking time!  If it was not for the glaze the actual cake would have been rather bland.  Needs a little something to give it that wow factor.  Glad I made this recipe but for me who loves cakes, this is not a keeper!

Very yummy.  I made the cake per recipe with 2 macintosh and 2 granny smith apples.  I used a bunt pan and doubled the glaze.  Used half to glaze cake and added powdered sugar to the other half.  It made a nice carmel fosting.  I will be making this again!  Thank you for the recipe.

I have made this a couple times and it is sooooo good! I follow the recipe exactly as written. I suggest pouring the caramel sauce slowly-letting it soak in a little bit before pouring more or poking holes in the cake. There is alot of sauce, so it may run over the plate or serving dish if you aren't careful. Other than that, delish!

I would rate a 3, but hubby says 4... I agree with Honey Chile's review.  If I were to make this again I would sub out more oil for applesauce (used half and half this time) and add more spices... cake seemed a little bland.  I did add the cinnamon sugar swirl and extra apples, but still could use more kick IMO.  I thought the texture was a little waxy/heavy like fruit cake, but hubby loved the texture, so maybe it's just a matter of personal preference.  The carmel topping was very good and easy to make!

Unbelievable!
I used only a cup of oil and it was planty moist.  I also used the advice of another reviewer and poked holes and poured half the topping while still warm and the rest just before serving.  This was so amazing; I made this for my coworker's birthday and it was voted the best so far (and I've made a lot of cakes!)  A great recipe!

Very excellent recipe.  Substituted no sugar added applesauce for the oil and heavy whipping cream for the milk. I also added a cinnamon swirl as suggested by an earlier review.  The caramel sauce really makes this cake - I think next time I'll poke holes in the cake while still in the pan and pour the sauce over it then.  Either that or just pour it over individual slices.  Next time I'll also try it without the cinnamon swirl (I'm not sure if that really added to the cake).  Baking time was good - maybe a smidge too long.  Good apple flavor.

Very  good. The caramel sauce really made the cake. I did cook the sauce a little longer and added a little bit of cream to it. Thanks to the recipe!

This is a pretty good cake. I really liked it but my husband said it was too sweet. Like others suggested--I used 1 c. sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, only needed 2 apples, added the brown sugar/cinnamon ribbon in the middle and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter. I agree that the sauce is what makes this cake but it also makes it super sweet. It may be too rich for those that don't like really sweet cakes. Not sure if I would make this again.

I gave it 3 stars for the original recipe. With all the substitutes it would get 5 stars. I for my first time making it followed the recipe exactly and it just idnt have flavor so next time i will add cinnamon, and applesauce. I used walntus and pecans and instead of leaving it a bundt cake i broke it up and crumbled it into a 9X13 pan and drizzled the whole amount of topping over it. At first when it was warm it reminded me of pancakes with maple syrup but when it cool it was better. I will probably make this again but with a few changes.

Made as muffins instead of a cake. Took forever to bake and still weren't really done. A bit too moist/mushy inside. But the flavor was good. Didn't even cover with glaze.

If you like a REALLY SWEET cake, this is for you. I did not care for it at all but my husband did so I think it is just my personal taste. The glaze is way too much. It just pooled in the center hole of the bundt cake and around the outside on the plate.

This was very good, well enjoyed by my coworkers. I agree that the amount of oil is too high - but that is easily solved by substituting applesauce, which is something I generally do anyway. Will very likely make again.

Replaced 1/2 of the oil w/ unsweetened applesauce; added the cinnamon swirl using 1/4 cup brown sugar & a tablespoon cinnamon & cut the sauce in 1/2 (which was plenty).  Also, I did not use nuts.  Pretty good only I think I put in too many apples.  Will make again

This was delicious. I didn't make the carmel topping, because I used "dulce de leche" which I had in the pantry. YUM

MMmmm... this cake is really good.  I added a few shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg and used half white/half brown sugar.  I also followed the suggestion of an earlier review and made a swirl mixture of 1/4c. brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I poured half the batter into bundt pan, then sprinkled on the swirl mixture before pouring in the second half of cake batter. The caramel glaze adds just enough sweetness. This is a great cake for fall!

Fantastic. Used unsweetened applesauce for half the oil, omitted nuts, shredded the unpeeled apples... and added a bit of cinnamon and used soy milk / margarine for the topping. To die for. Will try using whole wheat flour next - it's moist enough to handle it. Amazing, amazing recipe.

I followed the directions exactly (minus the pecans) and it just did not turn out. The batter is so thick it's more of a dough. It also is not cake consistency, it was more of a cookie, in fact it tasted just like a sugar cookie.

Like usual I made this cake twice. Once exactly following the recipe and once making the alterations I thought were necessary. I thought the as is cake was to heavy and greasy and a little bland. Instead of using 1 1/2c oil, I used 1c butter and increased the baking soda to 2t which made the cake much lighter. I also preferred the apple grated and some of the extra juice poured off so there was no soggy bits of cake around the apple chunks. I added 1t cinnamon and 1/2t cloves just because I love those spices with apples. When it came to the syrup, I poked holes all over the cake and then poured the syrup over. So yummy!

Loved it!  The only regret I have is not serving the cake warm.  The caramel topping is delicious and I was a bit surprised at how thin the sauce was and even more pleasantly surprised when I realized how well this all went together!

Very moist, Very sweet and Very good!! I made it this morning and brought into work, still warm.  It's being devoured.   I used half oil and half unsweetened applesauce.  Made it in a 9 x 13 pan and baked for 45 minutes at 350.  Made the full amount of sauce and made a poke cake out of it.  Poked holes all over with a wodden skewer and poured the hot caramel sauce over the top.  It soaked in quickly and I was able to just bring the 9 x 13 into work.  The only thing I might change would be to maybe add some cinnamon to the batter next time. Thanks for a great recipe and to member Gracey for suggesting it.

It came out great, and tasted like a German apple kuchen. I used only 1 cup of oil, cut the caramel ingredients in half (and it was still enough) and substituted pecans with walnuts. A new favourite!

This is an excellent recipe! EVERYONE loved this, kids and adults.  I used 1 cup of sweet almond oil and 1/3 cup vegetable oil.  This reduced the oil amount slightly, and it did not turn out greasy as others had mentioned.   I omited the nuts.  I will definitely be making this again!  Great for the fall when apples are on sale1

GOOD LORD, THAT'S GOOD!!! Made the changes recommended by others - substituted all but 2T. oil with natural applesauce, 50/50 white/brown sugar, and made a cinnamon sugar (b. sugar) sprinkled over 1/2 batter, topped with remaining half, and cut carmel topping in half.  This cake is more like a bread pudding - dense, moist, and sweet.  It was a hit with my entire family.  I will definitely make  again. I have a church picnic coming up and this is what I'm taking.

I wasn't impressed with this cake at all. The only advise I took from others was to use apple sauce instead of oil. Watch the baking time. I think I over baked the cake it was a bit dry and be careful pouring the glaze/topping on. The cake seems like a bit of sponge and the flavor of the caramel is strong. Won't make a gain.

We really enjoy this dense coffee cake. The topping keeps me going back for more. I grate the apples. Have made this with and without the pecans. The batter is thick. For me it takes a bit longer than the listed cooking time.

I took another reviewer's advice and sprinkled a mixture of sugar and cinnamon halfway thru to create that spicy ribbon as well as adding 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  I only used 1/2 of the caramel over the top and subbed 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 c veg oil. I also used 4 macintosh apples.

I found the caramel topping very interesting. Haven' t tried it yet but I will soon. I read below one review that thought it becomes greasy, so I can sudgest to use applesauce instead of vegetable oil, if not all of it at least 2/3 of it. Keeps the moisture and the taste of the resipes but with less fat.

Delicious Cake! I made it in a bundt pan, chopped the apples into small pieces, added some cinnamon, other then that I followed the recipe as given. The caramel icing is amazing, had some left over, saved it to be reheated for a vanilla ice-cream topping. I will make this cake again for sure!!

The flavor of the cake is good. I made it a second time using suggestions of half brown sugar/half Gran sugar. As well as half applesauce/half oil. I also added 1 1/8 tsp apple pie spice to it. I tried a small piece and it was very good. However, I still have to make the caramel sauce to go on top and I know it will put it over the top. The cake is very dense. Great w/ coffee, tea, milk, & even better... hot apple cider (yum).
***Update: I made the icing to go over it. Instead of milk I used rum and added 1/4 tsp apple pie spice and put it in a large glass measuring cup. Heated in microwave for 45 seconds, stirred and made sure sugar was melted, then added between 1/3 and 1/2 C confectioners sugar to the cup. Mixed well, and quickly poured over the coffee cake. Oh my gosh it took it to a whole new level of goodness. A definite keeper!

This was wonderful!  I also used apple sauce in place of a cup of the oil and a little extra cinnamon in the batter.  I really liked how appley it was.  With the sauce on top it was incredible!

made it as muffins -- 33 muffins, 17 minutes in the convection oven.  still delicious!

so so yummy, although I did make some changes.  I added a little cinnamon and I used whole wheat flour, and sucanat in place of the sugar.  Also for my topping I mixed coconut oil with the milk and sucanat.  It was fantastic.

This cake is a HUGE hit.  I only made a few slight changes.  Instead of chopping the apples, I used a cheese grater and grated the apples (using the side with the big holes).  I did this because I don't like chunks of fruit in my pastry. Since I grated instead of chopped, I figured the measurements might change and used my own judgement, which turned out to be 5 small-medium granny smith apples.  This also created more juice, which equalled more flavor.  I'm guessing a food processor would work very well, if you're like me and don't like chunks, however my food processor is still waiting for me on my wedding registry, so until my shower, I'll be using the grater.  In addition, I added a just a few dashes of cinnamon to the batter.  Due to the fact that my oven cooks quickly I had to remove my cake with 15 minutes left, so I would keep a close eye on it depending on your own oven. This cake is absolutely DELICIOUS.  Definitely will make this every fall and winter.

I would not change a thing about this recipe. Made this for a group of friends to have on the way to the baseball game. I started out using only 1 cup oil instead of the 1.5. It seemed way too thick. So I added the other half cup. It does not seem too greasy out of my pan, but maybe it is just me. It's so moist, and I LOVE all the extra caramel sauce (though my waist does not). I'd leave this one as is. It's a winner.

This cake was amazing. My parents, bro and sisters loved it!! I did some changes ofcourse. Instead of 2 c white sugar, i added 1 c white n 1 c dark brown sugar. I didnt add the pecans coz i didnt have some. Also, before adding the chopped apples i mixed it with 1/4 c of cinnamon. It took in the oven less than an 1hr!! For the topping, I added nestle plain creme.

Hmm..First of all, i'm a bit confused..
Should i chopped the apples and nut coarsely or fine? Does it require 500gr of apples AFTER it's been peeled n cored or BEFORE it's been peeled n cored?

I must say the finish product doesn't really impress me. After 1hour it was finish, but after i left it for about 20mnts and cut it, the part around the apples was a bit soggy and tasted like eating spiced fruit.
Maybe because i substitute 1cup oil for applesauce..who knows..

It gets better with the topping though (i only use 1/2 recipe and add 1tsp of ground coffee to balance out the sweetness and added flavour).

I'm sorry, but no. I was very disappointed in this. It's terribly bland, and the use of oil gives it an off taste. The topping may work well as a sauce, but had very little effect as a glaze. If I make it again, I would replace the oil with equal parts shortening and butter, add a tablespoon of cinnamon, incorporate the crumble center that other people have mentioned, and omit the milk from the topping so that it forms a thicker coating on the cake.

Used 1c applesauce and 1/2c oil.  Otherwise followed recipe as written.  It was very thick but I did like the texture of the cake.  The outside was very done/brown (and tasted dry) but had to bake till the inside got done.  The flavor was okay but would probably not make again.

I give the cake 5 stars and the frosting/glaze 3. I used half white and half brown sugar as suggested, and also half oil half cinn applesauce. I also used about 2 cups of apple since I thought it looked like plenty. Turned out very moist. I will chop up the apples even smaller next time as a personal preference. The glaze turned out runny for me, so I don't know what I did wrong there. I will probably use a diff glaze for it the next time I make it

Everyone who tried these thought they were really good.  A nice balance of apples and pecans.  I added a little cinnamon for a little spice.

This cake was fantastic, the only thing I did different was to use Jamaican vanilla extract. It added a rich, almost bourbon flavor to the cake. I will add this to my favorites.

When I was mixing the batter, I had my doubts about this cake but it was awesome!  Even my brother who doesn't touch cake had three pieces.  I'll be making this one often in the future.

I used 1 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. vegetable oil and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  I added the 1/4 c. brown sugar 1 tsp. cinnamon ribbon to the center as suggested and this cake turned out tremendous!  My husband and I love this and will be making this again very soon!  I also used almond extract instead of vanilla and walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand and it still turned out scrumptious! :)

Very moist and delicious. I too added the swirl and was a perfect addition. Only had to cook for 55 minutes- not the recommended time on recipe.

I have too many of these to count.  Extra apples and cinnamon perfect this.  They freeze really well so if you a last minute "take to dinner' dessert just grab from the freezer and go.  So far out of pecans, walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts the pecans have been the best.

Delicious!!!  Great way to use up apples from apple picking.  I substituted applesauce for half the oil and brown sugar for half of the sugar.  The glaze was decadent!  Next time I'll wait a few minutes before I pour over the cake.  Also, only need to make half the glaze.  The rest of the glaze I saved for ice cream topping.

DELISH.  My guests went nuts for this cake.  The only thing I did differently was to replace half the oil with applesauce and add 1 tbs. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  The caramel topping is to die for.

YUMMMMM! I did very little to change the base of this cake, I only altered it for sugars sake...(too much of a good thing) Sooo I used I cup of Splenda, 1/c cup of Splenda Brown Sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also only used 1 cup of the oil and then added 1/4 cup of fat free sour cream (next time I will add 1/2 cup for a little extra moisture) The caramel sauce is awesome and really made the cake.(I did not alter the sugar in the sauce) The apples were nice and soft, the cake was moist and bouncy, not heavy. Nice textures and flavors, will make this again! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Wonderful cake, perfect for autumn.  I served it at a dinner party and everyone raved.  I did make a couple of changes, however.  I substituted apple sauce for all but 1/4 cup of oil and I added cinnamon.  Next time I make it I'll probably also add some cloves and nutmeg and maybe raisins.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

Great, simple recipe! We used three different kinds of apples and substituted applesauce for oil. We accidentally used almonds instead of pecans (still delicious). Also didn't have baking soda, which made the cake more dense. The caramel sauce is also delicious with a little applesauce and cinnamon mixed in. Everyone loved it!

Good recipe.  I exchanged half the oil for applesauce and nuts for dried cranberries (kids won't eat nuts!)  I made the cake in a regular pan and found the cooking time far too long.  I cut it by 25 minutes and the crust was still too dry.  Will definitely make again with adjustments to cooking time.

Followed JA3MARSH suggestion of changing one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar (instead of 2 cups of white) and used 3/4 applesauce and 3/4 oil and the end result was wonderful!  Made in a bundt pan and it took about an hour and 20 minutes to cook through. The house smelled great. Thank you.!

My changes:  ONE CUP of APPLESAUCE, instead of oil.  3/4 cup White sugar and one cup brown sugar,  added in Penzey's Apple Pie Spice, omitted the pecans and used three different types of apples (Honeycrisp, Jonathan & Haralson).  I also cut the caramel sauce in half.  This is pretty darn good, but I'm gonna stick with German Apple Cake I on here.

This cake was good,although I had higher expectations after reading all the reviews. It was ok, a little sweet though. I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar. I also cut the oil down to 1 c. The batter was pretty thick but baked without a problem. Also, the cake was done in just a little under an hour.

I tried this recipe with the less oil and it turned out great! The batter was thick, but it baked and was wonderful. My wife enjoyed this recipe and it is one of her favorites now. It was relativly simple to make and great for many occasions. I think that the only thing bad about this cake is that it is not really a coffee cake and more of a regular dessert cake.
