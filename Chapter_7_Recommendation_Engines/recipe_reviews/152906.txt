I made this on Labour Day and had to substitute for items I didn't have on hand. (Substituted asparagus for the zucchini, italian seasoning for the garlic powder and balsamic vinagrette for the italian dressing).  We really, really enjoyed it and I'd like to try it again with the proper ingredients. My only regret is that we didn't have any white wine to drink with it.

For the person who's chicken turned out soggy---make sure to brown the chicken very well over medium high heat to sear and create a crust. The main point of the flour is to thicken the sauce while cooking. Also, I make my own italian dressing, as the bottled kind has way too much sodium for my likeing and also to many other "strange ingredients"

This was a great dish. We used shrimp instead of chicken (cook separately and add shrimp at the end or they will be over done), vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, and extra zucchini in place of the mushrooms. We also did what other commenters said and used balsamic vinegar instead of Italian. We served it over couscous. I'll definitely be making this again!! It had great flavors, I cleaned my plate. We made the '4 servings' but it was just enough for two people.

This was good, but my chicken got soggy so I would skip flouring the chicken. Very good!!

I substituted carrots for the zucchini, and used a balsamic vinaigrette instead of the Italian dressing.  Served it over wild rice--very glad I made enough for leftovers.

This was pretty good. I took another reviewers advice and skipped the flour. Next time I will add the vegetables and chicken at the same time, the vegetables were a little too crunchy for our taste.

This is a good basic stir-fry recipe and as the contributer points out it can be made with any choice selection of vegetables. I keep a good supply of homemade strongly flavoured garlic oil so I can eliminate the garlic powder and also add Fennel, oregano and and fresh green olives, eliminate dressing, and make sure that all vegetables have a nice crunch to them aftr cooking. I also prefer chicken thighs but that is what we chefs do, we play with the bounty of the earth and the ocean. Good recipe, have fun with it.

I even changed the recipe that I submitted! This time I made it with bacon-wrapped turkey tenderloins.  I fried up the bacon separately and then browned the flour-coated turkey cubes in some of the bacon drippings.  And I saved the crumbled bacon for a garnish.  The flavors in this stir-fry work equally well with pork or even beef.

Excellent! I omitted the mushrooms as they are not a favorite of mine. I added an orange bell pepper, and yellow squash as I had both on hand.  This was very good and makes great leftovers!

I thought this was delicious!!!  I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, and made a double batch.  For the broth I used Swanson's Cooking Stock.  For the dressing I used a combination of three dressings, just to use up some that I had on hand: Kraft's Tuscan Italian, some dressing I made myself (using a high quality, aged balsamic vinegar, olive oil & good seasons italian dressing mix), and Cardini's Italian Dressing. I also thickened it up a tad by making a small amount of gravy in a separate pan (a butter & flour roux and the remainder of the cooking stock), then adding it to the final product, though I did taste it before thickening and it was fine; I just prefer a thicker gravy.  I served it over a Texmati brown & wild rice mix.  WOW!  Was it YUMMY!!! My husband went back for thirds, which is very unusual.  Next time I make it I think I'll try boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts.

Great recipe.  Makes about 4 cups.  For Weight Watchers people it comes out to 5 points plus per 1 cup serving.

It's an easy, fast dinner.  Instead of leaving the chicken in the pan with the veggies, I removed the chicken and then added it at the end to make sure it didn't get soggy.  It worked pretty well.  Served over couscous.

So, I should have turned the stove down a little, b/c I burned some of the veggies.  Otherwise, it worked great.

This was yummy recipe. Didn't have a bell pepper on hand, but had all of the other ingredients. We did add a little extra chicken broth and italian dressing to put over some noodles. Very pleased with how it all turned out.

Very good.  I added Italian seasoning to spice it up a little.  I also added more broth & Italian dressing and simmered longer.  I will definitely make this again.

We loved this dish! I used sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. This is a great busy weeknight recipe. My husband asked if we could move this recipe to the top of the rotating list of meals.

Good and easy, but not amazing. Double the amount of liquids. Cover the skillet when cooking the veggies.

We love this recipe.  I don't always bother coating the chicken and just cook it with some garlic and pepper sprinkled over and it turns out good too.  I add yellow squash if I have it and that's good too.  My husband actually requests this meal which for him is unusual.  :)

It was a little strong from the Italian dressing, I will try the make your own kind or the balsamic vinegar next time. It was still good and I would like to try couscous next time too!! I also used the California blend veggies too!!

This is great! I used vegan "chicken" and everyone loved it.

Excellent recipe! I will definitely make this again. The only thing I changed was I added a little more Italian dressing.
