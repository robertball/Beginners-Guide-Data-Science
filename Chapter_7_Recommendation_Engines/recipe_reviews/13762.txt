My family has been making this for over 20 years at the holidays!  My suggestion-- I found after filling and rolling I wrap in wax paper, then foil and FREEZE!  This really makes the roll very moist, firms up the filling nicely and makes it very easy to cut into nice slices.  When you take out of the freezer, let it sit 5-10 before slicing.  I also make extra rolls to give as gifts and can be left in the freezer for up to 3 months.

This was a great dessert!  I've never made one, and it was easy!  I also used a regular baking sheet instead of a jelly roll pan...it worked fine.  (It still took about 20 minutes to bake.)  Enjoy!

This is one of the best pumpkin rolls I have EVER had!!! *Note* be sure to use excatly the amount of butter for the filling as the recipe calls for...or the filling will be soupy and it will run out the side when you roll it up.
Everyone that has tried this pumpkin roll loves it!!!

This pumpkin roll is great.  Everyone loves it butter is the key in the filling.  Make sure to use butter instead of margerine in the filling because it is a little to soft with margerine.  Again easy great recipe.

Fantastic!! Everyone loved this. I made this for Thanksgiving & Christmas. Easier to make than it sounds. If you make the filling first and refrigerate for about an hour it will thicken up. Not too running for rolling process. Freezes well.

I've been wanting to make this cake for a couple of years now, but felt a little intimidated by the rolling process. My friend "Cookinme" gave me the courage to give it a whirl. Wow, I can't believe how easy it was! It's such a pretty and festive looking cake too. Absolutely wonderful Kathleena and thanks!

I put powered sugar on the towel before rolling the cake up. That helps the cake not to stick to the towel.

I've been making this exact same recipe for 15 years.  Always a huge hit.  I make them as gifts for friends when we visit during the holidays.  Pumpkin Rolls also freeze well.  I always wrap in plastic, then foil and place in zip lock bag. Defrost at room temp and then place in frig.  Great recipe to share.

This recipe was great! Tasted amazing! I didn't use a jelly roll pan however just a 10X15 baking sheet and it came out perfect. Was a little discouraged when i rolled it up in a towel like it said, the cake stuck to the towel and it sort of came apart in places. I followed another reviewers advice and rolled in wax paper then aluminum foil (even with the roll torn in places). This was a saving grace! When i thawed it the next day it looked like it was a perfect roll, and super easy to cut!. Was very presentable and a huge hit with family! Will definitely make again! Don't get discouraged if it comes apart a little, if you freeze it and thaw the next day it's perfect! Thanks for a great recipe

This was a very good pumpkin roll and certainly easy, albeit messy, to make.


LOL...I'm a purist!  I do EXACTLY what the recipe calls for, uh usually.

I didn't know what "self rising" flour was but I Googled it and made my own.  Wish that was the only hurdle...didn't have any nutmeg...used pumpkin pie spice but added extra ginger & cinnamon.  

I'm making seven more and WILL go out and get nutmeg.  The filling, personally, I like a little more.

Otherwise, thanks for sharing and I apologize for making "adjustments" but they were not planned!

The spices are overwhelming when used in the amounts given in the recipe. Cut them down by half and you will have a pretty good pumpkin roll.

I chose this pumpkin roll recipe to try first because it had the most spices. It is a dense, spicy cake and I like that about it. One small can of pumpkin is just a little more than you need to make two of these. Which is good because my first attempt at rolling just broke it all to pieces. So I ate a bunch of it with powdered sugar on top and then fit the rest into a casserole dish, like a puzzle, until the whole bottom was covered and iced with the icing I had left from my successful second attempt.I put a towel on the top AND bottom of my cake.  I powder sugared the top of the cake before removing from the pan (while still hot enough I had to use pot holders), AND powder sugared both the pan (that I was turning the cake on to) before I put the towel on top, the top of the towel before I inverted the cake on to IT.  Basically, powder sugared everything??) My cake cracked when I tried to spread icing on the innermost roll of the cake, but it was no big deal after the disaster I had first!  I think I may try piping icing into the center next time.  Don’t worry about spreading the icing out perfectly because its just going to smoosh out anyway.  I tightly wrapped in Saran Wrap and covered and foil and its in my freezer for Christmas morning.  I do need to make another though because one is not enough for our family.

Made this  for Thanksgiving this year, along with 4 other desserts. It was  the first to disappear to rave reviews of - 'delicious', 'super moist', 'lovely filling', 'awesome pumpkin cake'- in a matter of minutes! I did  manage to sneak  a piece off someone's plate and agreed, adding, 'I can't believe I made this'! The trick is to make it a day ahead, freeze overnight and thaw in the fridge before serving.  The tangy cream cheese filling and warm spicy pumpkin cake flavours blend together beautifully for a truly delicious Thanksgiving  treat!!

VERY GOOD EASY. A bit time consuming but not hard.
The rolling in towel works very well. Resist the urge to rush stages. Filing will not melt if cake has cooled a bit. Easy to re roll. Note "Self Rising Flour" I didn't notice that till I was mixing,,didn't want to start over. Cake was a little thin I think
and I would like to make again to see. Still very good.

I made this for Thanksgiving as an alternative to pumpkin pie, and I'm so glad I did! It is fantastic! It was a hit with even the pickiest eaters. I followed exactly as written, except that I took the advice of others and wrapped in plastic, then foil, and froze before slicing it. I don't have a jelly roll pan, so I used a cookie sheet and it worked great! This was very simple to make and really tasty. Thank you.

Great recipe! My family loved the pumpkin roll. It tasted so good I had to make another roll the next day. I need to perfect my rolling skills, the first one was more like a flatbread and the second was a roll. Very satisfied! Will definitely make again

I make several of these every Thanksgiving and Christmas. They are absolutely delicious! No matter how many I make, they all get eaten or taken home!
