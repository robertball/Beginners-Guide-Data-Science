This was a very easy recipe and very good.  Reminded me of my mom's but she used vanilla wafers as a crust.

I don't like to eat raw eggs, so I took the yolks and lemon juice and heated them up over a bowl of simmering water, whisking constantly until the mixture starts to thicken. Add the sweetened Condensed milk and then pour in the crust. Y

Easy & very good!  I used the egg whites to make mirranggue to go on top.  Beat egg whites with 1/4 cup sugar & add a drop of vanilla.  Bake in oven @325 for 15 minutes

Very quick and delicious recipe.  I used lemon juice instead of juicing actual lemons.  I think next time I make it may add a meringue on top of it.  Recommendation though, this takes awhile to set, I suggest making it first thing in the morning then it should be ready by dessert time.  I made it right a couple hours before dinner and it needed maybe another hour but they couldn't wait to dig in.

I love this old fashioned recipe. I didn't change it one bit  and it turned out perfect. I used a 10" Graham cracker crust and topped it with meringue. To die for!

This recipe is just like my grandmother's that was a favorite of my dad's and he always requested it for his birthday every year. When my mom made it before ready made crusts were available, she would line the pan with whole Graham crackers.

The filling never thickened and I was left with a loose pudding. I tried adding cream cheese and additional condensed milk. Very disappointing as I was making it for my daughters visit. The pudding like concoction tasted great. The only thing I can think of is it doesn’t specify what size lemons and so I just pulled 3 off my tree which made about 4/5 a cup of juice.

Super easy to make and delicious. I added a little fresh whipped cream. I will keep this one in my recipe box for a nice summer treat. :)

Looked awesome for a bake sale - Had to double the recipe to fill a single pie crust.

What comes to mind when you think lemon icebox pie? Tangy..... sweet....... delicious? Well, this pie was none of those! The filling was so sweet I felt like gagging! I guess I hoped for too much, and I never hope to make this pie again! :(

This is the classic lemon icebox pie version that I was looking for!  So delicious!  I did make my own graham cracker crust and used the lemon juice from concentrate.  I added more lemon juice to taste, because we like it a bit more tart.  It took quite a while to set up.  It would have probably set up a bit quicker and firmer if I hadn't added all that extra lemon juice, but it was well worth the wait! :-)  One of our all-time favorites!  Thanks for sharing! :-)

I've been making this pie for years.  Everyone loves it, and it's so quick to make.  I use a pre-made graham cracker crust and top the finished product with Cool Whip.
