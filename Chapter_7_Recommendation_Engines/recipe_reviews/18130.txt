I've  been making this recipe for over a year now, with some changes that may improve it for those who find it bland.  With that said, we do like strong flavor here!  I combine the butter with the juice of 3 or 4 large lemons and a third cup of white wine, then bring to a slight boil, reduce heat and simmer a good 5-10 minutes to reduce.  Sometimes we throw some garlic in the mix too.  I use thawed frozen shrimp for ease and toss that in and cook another three or four minutes, adding 1/2 tsp cayenne (spicy!) Then I toss in fresh spinach linguine, and coat, simmering about a minute.  Remove from heat and toss in your fresh chopped cilantro (yep, I up that too, a full bunch).  It's pretty powerful, but the lemon zing is lovely!

Giving this 4 stars because I made a lot of modifications (5 stars with mods :)). I only used 1/2 pound of pasta. This just isn't enough to cover a pound. I use 1 Tbsp of butter and 2Tbsp of olive oil instead of 3 butter. Before adding the shrimp to the butter/oil, I sauteed 1/2 diced onion, 1/2 diced red bell pepper and 2 minced cloves of garlic. I also added some oregano and increased the cayenne. This was a quick and easy meal.

I loved it!... Exactly what I was craving!... All the flavors blended perfectly!  Zesty lime, buttery/wine, spicy cayenne, fresh cilantro!...  Yum! I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to it and a whole cube of butter in the sauce; good thing because it would have been too dry without it!  Note to self: used 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of wine, dash of olive oil, 1/2 cube butter, garlic powder, salt, then let simmer.   Add raw shrimp(XL) (season shrimp set out for 30 mintes) in immering ssauce until cooked.  Add cooked pasta to sauce sprinkle all with a little cayenne and mix in more butter.

This was an interesting dish - very light flavors of lime and cilantro.  I think next time I might use one shot of tequila instead of the white wine.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic per earlier reviews.  I honeslty think the tequila would make a huge difference.  I wil have to try that and re-review.  UPDATE:  So I added two garlic cloves, one small yellow onion, upped the wine to 1/3 c. and the cayenne to 1/4 tsp.  I also used the juice of two limes.  THIS WAS SOOOOOOOO good!  I am increasing my score of the recipe from 3 to 4 stars.

The first thing I said was "Tastes like Mexico"! We vacation in Cancun, and this reminds me of some of the fresh, light, and yummy seafood dishes we've had there. I used 3T of lemon juice, 1 garlic clove, and 3/4c wine. Perfection!

This was a very tasty way to use shrimp. I served mine over spinach fettucine instead of regular fettucine. The dish had a nice bite, from the cayenne pepper, but think it needed another ingredient. I added a little parmesan at the table and that seemed to get a little closer. Maybe some grilled vegetables? Anyway, this is a good recipe and a keeper.

You just can't beat these ingredients... cilantro, lime, white wine, and cayenne... unless you use a little more of each of them. We thought the recipe came out just a tad bland. More spunk! More flavor! Maybe a little more salt and pepper would help. But this was a treat - thanks to Bill for sharing it!

My family thought it was delicious, even my 5 year old. I added some finely chopped green onions and a little of Emerill's Essence to kick it up a bit. Very tasty.

This turned out really well, with of course a few modifications.  I used margarine instead of butter to lower the fat, I used a pinot grigio wine, and I added a splash of lemon juice to the sauce as well.  Furthermore, I cooked the shrimp with garlic beforehand and then seasoned the shrimp and sauce with red pepper flakes, salt and pepper (and more garlic).  I left out the cilantro because my fiance hates it.  It was spicy and not very saucy, which is great for us because that's how we like our pasta.

I made this for the first time tonight and we all loved it! I changed the servings to 3 but needed to add more wine and lime juice to the skillet because of that, but no big deal. It was very tasty and seems so healthy. I will definitely make this again and again!!

Instead of butter, I used olive oil and I left out the cilantro as I am not fond of it. I also didn't make the pasta, but I would imagine that you would need to make more sauce to cover the pasta as there wasn't a lot left in the pan after cooking. The flavors blended well together. Fairly simple, which allowed the shrimp to shine.

This is a wonderful recipe. However, I thought it was missing just one ingredient - garlic! I added one large clove of garlic, minced, when I added the shrimp. I used only 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/16 tsp. cayenne (I know, I know, we're wimps), and it was just perfect for us. Next time I would probably serve it over rice since the fettucine was so slippery and hard to eat.

EXCELLENT!!!!! It was really good, the flavor of the butter, lime and cilantro on the shrimp were delicious. It's hard to notice the lime at the end in most recipes but this one, was great

This is delicious- fresh cilantro is key. If you don't like Cilantro, don't make this one. The Cilantro especially garden fresh makes it. I did cheat a little and add some garlic and doubled the sauce but it was all terrific- my husband was so impressed and so was I. Delicious! Thank you for sharing.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Just added Caribbean jerk seasoning to the shrimp while cooking.  Also doubled the sauce and finished with parmesan cheese.

Well...  we just can't get enough of this!!  I have recently been put on a strict, low-sodium diet, and have to learn how to cook, all over again.  Finding recipes has been somewhat of a challenge. Finding ones that we really like, even more difficult.  THIS, however, has been a wonderful success! Thank you SO much for sharing.

I loved this recipe. I did add green onions and garlic per other reviews. I think I reduced the sauce a little too much. Next time I will be more careful with that so that there is more sauce for the pasta. In fact I might make a little more sauce. Otherwise I thought it was fantastic! The flavors go so well together!

We used others suggestions:  2 TBS olive oil, 1 TBS butter and 2 cloves garlic.  Then used 1/2 cup wine, 1/4 cup cilantro, 4 TBS lime juice and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  This was good, a bite at first from the lime juice, then heat at the end from the cayenne.  Added a smidge of cornstarch to thicken it.  Good.

I prepared this according to Angelinazoom's method using 2 Tbs. Olive Oil, 1 Tbs. butter, 2 cloves garlic, the juice of 3 limes, 1/2 cup white wine, 1/4 tsp.cayanne and 1/4 cup cilatro. Just goes to show how adjustable this recipe can be to suite different preferences for tart and heat. I also plan to use this recipe, sans pasta, as an appetizer or first course. Wonderful! Thanks!

Looking at the most "helpful" reviews I was tempted to sub lemon juice for lime and add a bunch of garlic.  But then I thought, that's Shrimp Scampi.  I made this as written and absolutely loved it. Glad I didn't listen to the helpful reviews.  I did double the sauce for a pound of pasta. Thanks for the great recipe.

I doubled the amount of shrimp, wine, and butter.  We like it hot, so I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne.  I also added green peppers and some fresh parsley from the garden.

This recipe defintely needed something.  I just automatically added a little garlic and some finely chopped onion.  I did like the kick the red pepper gave this recipe.  Note:  I gave it 4 stars AFTER I added my own ingredients.

This is delicious, especially when considering how quick and easy it is to make!  I tried it using both fresh and dried cilantro, and fresh is definitely better.  It still tasted pretty good with the dried cilantro, and if (like me) you spend too much time when attempting to chop fresh herbs, you may want to try it as a time-saver.

I'm sorry to say that I was not as impressed with this recipe as I had hoped.  I used more lime juice than called for, but the flavor just didn't seem to be there.  I thought the sauce was too thin to put over pasta, so just ate the shrimp alone.  Will use the leftovers for chipotle shrimp fajitas and hope for a little more flavor that way...

With the substitutions that Angelinazoom suggested, this may be my favorite pasta dish EVER!!  The sauce was light enough to coat the pasta and all the extra cayenne pepper gave it the kick I love.  Thank you for sharing!!

I made this on my anniversary for my husband and he enjoyed it. I think next time I will probably add more of the sauce because it seemed like we were just eating noodles at times.

Very bland!  I may try making again with triple the lime juice and double the cayenne pepper, but overall I was very disappointed with this recipe.

Tasty but dry - I cut the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us, and there didn't seem to be enough sauce for the noodles.  I will try again without dividing the sauce measurements.  It did taste amazing though.

This was good, but it needed something else, like many other reviewers I would agree it needs garlic, and lots of it.  I used white grape juice instead of wine and it worked surprisingly well.  Overall this dish was tasty, easy to make, and very pretty.  The cilantro in it worked really well with the light sauce.  I'll make again but with some modifications.

I had to make some adjustments because of what I had on hand. First of all I didn't have cilantro so I added dried parsley & sage, I used lemon juice instead of lime, and added a pinch more cayenne pepper. I also followed others suggestions to saute some onion & garlic. I increased the liquids to make it saucier to accommodate for so much noodles but once I follow the recipe I don't measure any of the additional ingredients but I probably used close to a cup of white wine & 3 tbsp of lemon juice. Even with my modifications it was really good and I look forward to trying this again with cilantro. One last thing- I used precooked shrimp and next time I will just toss them in with the pasta & let it all sit for a few minutes to heat the shrimp through. Cooking them separately resulted in overcooked shrimp but that was pretty much my own fault. A+ recipe and fast! Thanks

This was an easy recipe, but I would suggest not using just any white wine because the sauce will come out sweet - a Sauvignon Blanc is drier wine (which I would recomend) rather than a Reisling or Chardonnay and I used lemon instead of lime.. It was a nice light pasta with a kick..

Awesome recipe, thank you so much for sharing it.  Our pasta turned out a little on the dry side, so I mixed up more of the wine/cilantro sauce & added it in.  My son loved it and he's pretty picky.  Our shrimp were very fresh and turned out great.  I wouldn't change any of the ingredients, just add more sauce.  Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!!

This is a great recipe! I was in a crunch to get something ready for supper, and I came across this and I'm now so glad I did. I tossed this with farfalle instead of fettucine(the kids like the bowties) and threw a few dashes of garlic, minced onions, oregano, and parsley into it and cut back on the cayenne a bit(my 3 yr old is the only one of our kids that likes food spicy). Then I tossed in some steamed mixed vegetables and voila! The kids loved it! My 5 yr old has now insisted I make it for his birthday!

Very, very good and so simple!  Next time I will try adding the onion and garlic, because I think there could be more flavor to the dish.  But even without anything extra, the recipe was very good and I am definitely making it again!

Totally awesome!  I used precooked shrimp and added it to the butter to warm them up.  I removed them and added fresh minced garlic and onion and sauteed, then added 3/4 cup wine and the lemon juice with cayenne.  AWESOME!  I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while!  Thanks!

Man oh man was this good!!! This is a great way to make shrimp, llove the cilantro. My only change would be to add a little less butter (maybe 2T) nexc time so there's a little less sauce. Otherwise, YUM! I loved it, husband loved it.

This recipe is great!  Unlike most "quick" recipes, this actually took me 25 minutes--maybe even less.  If you're someone who doesn't have a lot of free time--like a college student--but likes to cook, this is perfect--quick and delicious.  The only change I made was to add a couple of chopped garlic cloves.

Four out of the four of us liked this recipe!  However, I did add garlic, extra cayenne, and extra cilantro (so I rated it 4 stars instead of 5).  One of my sons added LOTS of cayenne and a seasoning salt.  I would like it if the sauce stuck to the pasta, but it was very tasty.  I think the sauce would be a good base for a shrimp soup.

I followed rec of another person and added 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 sweet onion and switched out 3 tablespoons butter for 1 butter, and 2 virgin oil.  I put in too much  cayenne pepper so be careful there:  used spinach noodles which went well.  Wife said I can make again.

LOVED IT! I halved the pasta, doubled the sauce, added 4 cloves of garlic, 1/2 a bunch of green onions,  and 1/2 a red pepper. The garlic was diced rather than minced and added to the butter.  After the shrimp was cooked, I added the green onions, red pepper, then 1 cup of white wine (Pinot Grigio) and 1/3 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice (4 small limes). I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I will definitely be making this again!

Holy Hannah this was an amazing dish!  YES, we did make some changes but it's what we do when we have a few drinks under our belt, lol!  We cooked up some chicken breasts as well to add to this recipe with some garlic seasoning and cut up the chicken into small cubes.  Sauteed the crushed garlic in 5 tablespoons of butter, fresh squeezed lime and lemon juice (2 large limes and 2 large lemons) and 1 generous cup of white wine.  Took the shrimp out like the recipe said and let the white wine reduce a bit.  Added the cooked pasta, cooked chicken, shrimp, and cilantro paste to taste - about 3 tablespoons (as we live in Canada where fresh cilantro is hard to come by in the winter).  Then at the end we added 1 cup of sundried tomatoes and 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese with a few red chili pepper flakes.  I know, we went a bit off course BUT....it was the  recipe base that was inspiring and I think we have a really good hit!  Hope this is of help nto those adventurous folks!

I made this for dinner tonight.  It's the 3rd or 4th time I have made it.  I am not crazy about shrimp but this is without a doubt my favorite pasta recipe.  I love it.  I added the 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 onion, 2 cloves of garlic minced and fresh oregano as someone else recommend.  It's easy to make and taste great.  Give it a try I am sure you will love it.

I did add 2 extra T of lime juice and used Joe and Nellie Key West Key lime juice, taste much better to me than regular like juice. Garnished with thinly sliced red onion and topped it all off with some fresh parmesan cheese.

I was looking for a different twist on shrimp and this recipe hit the mark. I took the advice of some of the other posters and increased the portions of wine, lime juice, cilantro and cayenne pepper. In my case the portions were: 3/4 cup of wine, 3 tablespoons of lime juice, 1 bunch of cilantro and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the butter. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing.

Loved this!  Made it with a little bit more lime juice than what was called for - and added garlic which I sautéed the shrimp with.  Delicious and easy!
 Will make again!

I thought this was going to be a slight deviation from Scampi, boy was I wrong, this is totally different. The flavors compliment each other perfectly. This is fantastic! This will be a regular in our house. Thanks Bill!

Yummy !!  In a hurry I combined the lime juice, wine and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper but I think it turned out well because the sauce sat for 1 hour. I then sauteed the shrimp in a hot skillet with about 1 tbsp of olive oil and 1 tbsp butter for about 2 min. then removed the shrimp and added the sauce to the pan and boiled for 2 min to reduce it .. added the shrimp and cilantro and tossed for another 1 or 2 minutes. I served it with a side dish of bulgar wheat in place of the pasta and it went well together. You don't need as much sauce without the pasta and the reduced fat makes it healthier. Think I will try it with quinoa next time... Great dish!

This was incredible!!!!!  I don't know how the other reviewers said it didn't have enough flavor.  I made it just as written except I substituted white wine vinegar for the wine and only did 2 dashes of cayanne.  Still absolutely DELISHIOUS!

This is a decent recipe, so I'll give it four stars, though I did end up making a few modifications that I feel really enhanced the recipe.  First, I took out the cilantro completely - not a fan of the flavor it gives.  I also have started to use lemon juice instead of the lime juice, then added some fresh broccoli and a small can of rotel or fresh diced tomatoes to add some additional flavor (and color) to the dish.

This is a really tasty pasta dish with a few changes. Definitely needs a little more sauce or a little less pasta or it gets a bit dry. I like to sprinkle with some feta cheese too. Turns out really tasty and easy!

We loved this dish. I did not add garlic as other reviewers did because I wanted to really taste the lime and cilantro and didn't want to overpower it with garlic. The cayenne gave it the perfect amount of spice. Will make this many times over.

My grandmother and I very much enjoyed this recipe.  I added the 2 cloves of garlic, as suggested by other reviewers, and would not want to make it without them.  I'll definitely make this again!  It was easy and tasty.

I tried this recipe with scallops instead of shrimp (that's what was in the fridge) and it turned out good.  I would add a little more cayenne pepper next time just for my personal preference, but the amount in the recipe was enough that you could taste it.  I also topped mine with some shredded parmesan.

The lime, white wine and shrimp combo is simply divine!  The only thing I would recommend is either using less pasta or more of all the other ingredients.  I will be making this for years to come!

This was a great tasting dish. I loathe cilantro so I ommited it. Other than that the only thing I did different was using I Can't Believe It's Not Butter in place of the real butter. Good stuff, thank you!

While I liked the fresh flavor of the lime and cilantro, I felt that this recipe was missing something...it was bland for my liking.  I doubled the lime juice and added extra salt and pepper.  I would like to try to recipe again with more lime juice, cayenne pepper, and cilantro and perhaps some veggies.  Next time, I try this recipe, I will use olive oil instead of butter - I felt like the butter gave the pasta a heaviness that did not compliment the lime and cilantro.

I thought this was great but my husband said it didn't have much flavor. He said it needed something like a side to kick it up. I thought it had great flavors...maybe he just got sidetracked by the durango part and thought it would be spicier. good recipe though!

I used a merged version of Angelinazoom's and Batcave's additions to this recipe, but the extra lemon juice was REALLY overpowering.  If I could do it over I would follow Batcave's recommendations alone, the red pepper was a great addition!  Also, I used 3/8 tsp. of cayenne and I thought it was barely spicy at all (and I'm not a huge spicy person), so if you're looking for something hot, I would recommend at least 1/2 tsp if not more.  For the wine, I used Black Swan reisling, which was very tasty.

Very delicious!  I added a little too much cayanne pepper but if that hadn't had been the case it would have been amazing!  I also added about 4 garlic cloves when cooking the shrimp and left them in the pan while cooking down the liquid, great addition of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the taste but there was not enough liquid, so noodles were a little dry.  Next time will increase the liquid.

I thought this was SOOOO tasty, I made it a little more spicer with the cayenne pepper, but it was delicious!! You could taste all the different flavors in it.

Loved this recipe.  I also used 2 tbs. butter and 1 tbs. olive oil.  3 cloves crushed garlic and about 1/4 c. lime juice.  Next time will leave out the cayenne as the kids were raising their eyebrows over it (I loved the spice!).  Will also serve over rice instead.

Really tasty!!  I doubled the sauce and halved the pasta like others said to do.  Everyone in the family loved it, 6 year old and 22 month old included!  I served with ripe avocado on the side for a nice creamy balance...YUM!

I'm not a fan of seafood, but my fiance liked it a lot. I used a bit more garlic than called for, but forgot to put any EVOO in the noodles, so they were really sticky. Won't forget that next time!

This was a great recipe but you pretty much need to double the sauce because it did not make enough. I also added garlic, a little lemon juice and garlic-all seasoning. awesome meal!

Good, but don't know if I will make it again. A very different mix of flavors, that I'm not sure were complimenting. So overall, it was okay, but not my family's favorite.

This was very good ... I added mushrooms, onions and fresh garlic ... had to triple the sauce and added far more cayenne than it called for along with crushed red pepper flakes ... we like things very spicy ... I also used fresh scallops along with the shrimp ... we'll be making this again, it was easy and very good!

This was a nice light pasta. Great flavor and a nice change from our usual pasta recipes. I used 3/4 box of whole wheat linguine and added 1 clove minced garlic and 1/4 of an onion. Turned out great!!

This dish was light and delicious with a slight kick and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I used more cilantro and a bit more lime juice. The lime was a bit too strong which was my fault. Next time I will add the extra cilantro but keep the lime as the recipe calls for. I served this with the 5 star bean salsa recipe I got from here (which I added lime and cilantro to) and it made a sensational meal.

This was awesome!!! I did make some alterations though:  I added about 2 tsp's of cayenne pepper (was NOT spicy) and an extra tbsp of lime juice.  I also used shrimp AND scallops.  HUGE hit and super easy!! I used whole wheat pasta as well.  Yummo!

Blah.  I used olive oil instead of butter and it turned out bland and boring.  I even added more wine, more lime, and some garlic.

Just made this tonight.  I used 1/2 lb. vermicelli (instead of 1lb pasta) and 2 tbs. lemon juice instead of the lime because I didn't have lime.  I also added about 1/2 tsp crushed garlic to the butter after taking the shrimp out and before added the white wine and lemon juice.  I can't imagine this being enough sauce for a whole pound of noodles.  I did like it though I think I'd like it better with a bit more sauce. Not butter, but maybe more of the wine/lemon.  I think a sprinkling of cheese would have really made the dish.  I'll try that next time.  I'll make this again because it was so easy.

I did not like this recipe.  Most of the "sauce" boiled away and the rest was absorbed by the shrimp and noodles.  The shrimp were tasty, but the noodles were bland and tasteless.

This is a nice change from heavier pasta dishes & so quick to make! I reduced the pasta by half, but left the rest of the ingredients as written. I sprinkled the tiniest bit of cayenne on each serving before putting them on the table. I think next time I may add garlic (never hurts to add garlic). This is a nice lighter pasta dish. If you only like creamy or thick sauces - this is not for you.

Served with Linguine, since that's what I had on hand.  Took the advice of a few other reviewers and added garlic and onion after removing shrimp.  I also used lemon juice instead of lime and 3/4 cup white wine instead of 1/2 cup.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I enjoyed this dinner.  We made the recipe as written, except only enough pasta for two and we halved the amount of butter.  Still plenty of butter flavor.  We also added a bit more cayenne, as we like it spicy.  We will make it again - and wouldn't hesitate to make for guests!

This is such a simple recipe AND has the perfect blend of ingredients--cilantro, wine, cayenne pepper, lime and shrimp!  It has become a favorite meal for dinner in our house and is often requested!  =)

Tasty recipe, and it works great with the barbecued corn. Some vegetables added to the pasta would have been better, I think, and I made the misktake of adding just a little to much cayenne for our tastes. But excellent, non the less!!
