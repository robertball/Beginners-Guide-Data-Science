I made this exactly* as written.  Exceptional with several layers of flavor.  My boyfriend, who I didn't know is not a fan of Thai food, even LOVED it.  

*I was not able to puree because I forgot to bring my immersion blender to his house, but we like the added texture. 

PS, I'm a chef and usually pretty picky about 5-star reviews, but this recipe knocked it out of the park!

The multitude of ingredients yield some amazing flavor.  I didn't bother pureeing the soup...rather I just used a food processor to chop the onion, red pepper and garlic very fine before adding.  I didn't use the pre-cooked rice either, but added a little extra liquid and threw some dry rice in the pot while it simmered.  It turned out perfect  I will definitely do this one again.  Great for a cold day with some warm crusty bread.

Great flavors and easy to adapt for more or less heat.  I made the rice separately and the served the curry over it.  Ate it as a meal, makes 3 servings that way.

Terrific recipe.  I did leave out the cilantro, because it tastes like soap to me.  Have made this two times, now.  Family favorite.

Very good.   A keeper according to my husband.  I used frozen cooked cocktail shrimp and put them in at the end.   I did not put the shrimp or rice inthe blender.

I liked the flavor of this a lot, but I used uncooked rice and forgot that a cup of uncooked rice makes 2 cups of cooked rice. After blending it was really thick, I'll have to water it down some when I reheat it. So that would be my only tip: if you're adding uncooked rice, cut the measurement in half.

This is a great recipe.  I  add a few more veggies and change them around.  I use the lite  coconut milk and change from chicken to shrimp.  I add  fish sauce and more chili paste.

Made a half-batch omitting salt as I used leftover chicken soup rather than unsalted broth. Added fresh pineapple to leftovers the next day which added another dimension.
