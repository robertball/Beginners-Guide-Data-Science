This is the best chicken ever!  I asked my 12 yr old daughter (a picky eater) what she wanted for dinner the next night after serving this chicken and she said "Can we have that "morroccan chicken again?"  That ranks 5 stars in my book.

A yummy variety of flavors.  My husband doesn't normally like raisins, but he enjoyed them in this dish.

A little spicy for kids, but all of our friends loved it. It was easy to make and had a very unique flavor. Everyone thought we spent a lot more time than we actually did on the meal.

This is very aromatic, and it tastes just as good as it smells. I used plain polenta since my family doesn't like mushrooms. I would definitely make it again.

Great dish!  The changes I made:I  doubled the chicken broth & added a little extra tumeric for more sauce.  I also added a handful of frozen green peas for color.  I had to substitute dried cranberries 'cause I was out of raisins. I served over plain polenta.  This dish reminded us of a curry.  Hubby and I devoured it!  Will definately make again!

One of my favorite recipes on here and pretty easy.  I added garlic (because I have s serious addiction to the stuff), onion and used golden raisins instead of regular.  I just cooked regualr polenta, using water from steeped mushrooms.

Easy and delicious. Nice presentation too--totally suitable for company.  I add more raisins than called for and prefer serving it over couscous (with the extra flour/spice mixture mixed in).  Served with a side salad with a lemon-garlic-olive oil dressing.

This was soooo flavorful, what a treat! You truly can't tell this dish is low-fat, since it tastes so exotic. I loved all the spices and the complimentary sweetness the raisins added.  it was a bit too spicy for my friend, so i might cut back on the red pepper next time. it really was not time consuming or complicated to make if you have all the spices on hand. I was unable to find the wild mushroom polenta, so opted for the plain roll which was still good.

This was really good, everyone I made it for devoured it.  It took me forever to find polenta, I was on the verge of just making some before I found it, and it wasn't wild mushroom, unfortunately.  I added mushrooms to make up for it...
I also added some vegetables, mimicing the round shape of the polenta.  Like Zuchinni.  Turned out really well!

This is one of the best meal we have made. Such fresh, distinct flavors. An added bonus is that it naturally makes a very visually appealing dish. Great for showing off to dinner guests.

my family loved this.  It was a little spicy for my kids.  I added mushrooms to the chicken mixture since I just had plain polenta.  GREAT meal!

Excellent! I've made many recipes from this site (some great, some not so good), but this is the first one to encourage me to make an accout so I could rate one of them. My wife and I both LOVED it. Followed the directions to the word, but as someone suggested, I may try couscous instead of polenta next time.

This was a nice change, and had an interesting combination of flavors that blended together nicely.  Healthy too.  If I make again I will leave out the raisins, they made it a little too sweet for me.  I also did not understand why the recipe calls for sprinkling flour on the polenta. After broiling, it was still sitting on top and I had to wipe it off.

This is WONDERFUL!  Love the flavors and the other reviewers are right, it's pretty enough for company.  And, it's so quick and easy!  I'm sure I will be making this again and again!  I only made one small change to the chicken.  I didn't have almonds so I used chopped peanuts.  They went great with the other flavors.  I served this with fried sweet potato cakes (just like regular potato cakes only made with mashed sweet potatoes)instead of the polenta.  The sauce was great with the sweet potatoes!  Next time I think I will adjust the recipe for more sauce.  Thanks for a GREAT dish!

Excellent!  I was looking for a recipe to go with polenta (which I'd never had before) and found this.  The recipe was fabulous and I intend to make it again.

I had my doubts but...Fantastic! Fabulous! This is low in fat but doesn't taste low fat. The only thing I changed was I didn't use coriander and I used sundried tomato polenta. My family and I really loved it. Thanks for sharing.

I served it over rice instead of polenta.  I also added garlic and garam masala to it.  Also, I mixed in the yogurt at the end.  It tasted more Indian that way.

Easily the best dish i have ever made. Not only is it simple and hard to screw up, it is unbelievably delicious. It's also easy to present aesthetically if that's a concern at all. The spices are just right and it smells delicious, try it you will not regret it.

The flavors  melded and were more flavorful the second day.  Followed other cooks advice and added onion and garlic and stirred in the yogurt to the sauce at the end. We used sundried tomato and garlic polenta (that's what they had at the store) and have also served over rice and found the dish pleasing.
