While this may seem like a "duh" recipe, not everyone automatically knows where green beer comes from, particularly the older generation who drank green beer from a keg when distributors used to inject the dye into kegs before distributing it to bars.  I don't do light beer, but this worked just fine with a delicious local IPA, too.  Cheers!

A frosted mug of ice cold green beer to go with a wonderful St. Patrick's meal.  The meal consisted of:  'Braised Corned Beef Brisket', 'Cream Cheese Colcannon' and 'Irresistible Irish Soda Bread' all AR recipes.  My son was more than happy to drink the frosty mug with his meal!  Thanks Huge, for sharing your fun recipe.
