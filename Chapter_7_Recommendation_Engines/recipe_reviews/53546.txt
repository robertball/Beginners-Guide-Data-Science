I'm in the deep south where bbq ribs are highly scrutinized. After cooking ribs this way, I wouldn't cook them any way else, and I've had ribs that were not cooked this way and they don't fall off the bone as easily, believe me it ain't a pretty sight. I skipped the grill because it's kaput right now, went straight after the boil to the oven and they turned out delicious & tender, finger-lickin good. I drank the beer instead and it made the recipe that much better!

I opted not to boil the ribs, I think this takes away from the flavor.  So I cooked them in the crock pot with other ing. on low for about two hour checking to make sure they did not start falling apart.  I then drained grease from crockpot and let the ribs rest on paper towels for about 30 minutes while getting the grill ready.  When the grill was hot we cooked them for about eight minutes, four minutes on each side and brushed them with BBQ sauce, I then added them back to crockpot with BBQ sauce and we used Miller beer.  Make sure you use a good BBQ sauce like Jack Daniels, Famous Daves, etc.  if you use the cheap brands like kraft etc. you will not get the full flavor of BBQ.  These turned out finger lickin, fall of the bone, drop dead good.  Thanks for the post.

I always make these (actually the same recipe) using a coke, but being a beer lover, who am I to pass this up?  I skipped the whole pre-cook thing & just stuck them in the crock pot (on low) for about 5 hours and they were so tender that I could pull the bone out without a problem.  I used Bubba's Best BBQ Sauce (from this site) with this.  Thanks Scotty!

Fantastic.  I followed all three steps of the cooking process.  After reading all of the reviews, it appeared to me that some were having a tough time BBQ'ing the ribs without burning them.  I think that the reason is two-fold.  First, and probably the main reason for this, was the use of far to much BBQ sauce.  The ribs should only be lightly coated.  Second, when cooking the ribs, you should not place them over the direct flame of the BBQ.  High heat and high flame are two different things.  For example, on a four burner gas BBQ, you can maintain 350 degrees by putting two burners on high and two on low.  With this, you can cook your ribs over the low flame and get that fire taste.

Absolutley delicious & very tender! I skiped grilling them & I cooked them in a 325degree oven for 3 hrs. instead of a slow coker. The ribs were a huge hit with my whole family. My 2yr. old couldn't get enough of them! I will definitley make these again!

INCREDIBLE.  my boyfriend said they were the best he's ever had!  I used two bottles of bbq sauce (one sweet, one spicy) and added bourbon whiskey, worcestershire sauce, Franks Red Hot and cider vinegar to them.  I also used porter beer - the flavor was rich and distinctive.  these are fantastic and definitely better than any I've had in restaurants!  Thank you SO MUCH!

These ribs were fantastic.  My husband never cared for my oven ribs because they always seemed fatty.   The boiling takes away the fat and doesn't add alot of work.  I also skipped the grilling part for ease, and put them in the oven as others have suggested (325 for 3 hours).  They were browned and tender and simply the best ribs I think I've ever had. Thanks

My son, who is a very picky eater, loved these ribs and called them "awesome" and ask me to make them often.  I boiled them for only 15 minutes, LIGHTLY coated them with barbecue sauce and broiled them in my oven until lightly crispy.  Cooked them in my crockpot on low for 4-5 hours.  Since the crockpot makes just about anything tender and moist, do you think it's necessary to boil them first?

Great ribs, couldn't grill them, but put them in a covered pan at 325 for 3 hours.  Made the best ribs I ever tasted, with or without the beer.

An absolutely WONDERFUL dish. I'd almost given up on making ribs, as they were always greasy and tough. Glad I tried "just one more..."  I made it without the beer; just added a bit of water. Even my kids love it!

Par boiling may soften the meat but here in Texas we know it removes flavor as well.  Spareribs would be a better choice.. Babyback ribs are used by the food industry as it is easier to control portion size, not for their flavor. Smoke them over 220 heat for two hours and if inclined, sauce them and wrap them in foil for one more hour. Trust me,I cooked in a bbq joint in Lubbock Texas..  I do not lie

OH MY!! These ribs are truly amazing. I did make a few modifications. First, I never boil ribs because that's just not done where I live in Texas. I found a rub recipe on this site, Mempis Rub, and let the ribs sit overnight with it on them. I then wrapped them in foil and cooked them in the oven real slow mainly 'cause I don't have a grill. I could not find any Porter but did find a Porter/Pilsner blend called "Missippi Mud" and used that. I used a combination of baby backs and regular spare ribs and I'm not exagerating there were only six pieces left. I plan to use this recipe again. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I skipped the boiling step and went straight to the grill to brown the rib slab. The grill set at medium high does an amazing job browning evenly plus making those "grill marks." After about 3 minutes on each side I removed the slab then cut into 2 or 3 bone pieces depending on the serving size. Then I followed the rest of the directions for the sauce and cooking time. Towards the end I didn't move around any of the ribs (for fear of separating the meatfrom the bone) but spooned the sauce out of the bottom and drizzled over the top pieces. The beer does an amazing job keeping the meat moist and the sauce easy to drizzle.

My ribs weren't "falling off the bone". I would cook it on low INSTEAD for twice as long or longer.  With Ribs, the longer you cook them on a low heat, the more tender and flavorful.

I have been doing ribs for a long time and this is the first time I have found one my whole family loves. With a picky family, this is worth the work. I followed it to a tee and I'm glad I did. Loved it.

Although the process is long, it is very straighforward, and not time-consuming.  Would recommend grilling on medium heat for just 5 minutes to avoid burning the sugar in the BBQ sauce.  Can be left in the crock pot on low heat for 1-2 more hours after the initial 3 hours on high.  I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce recipe by Kevin; another winning recipe!

I will never cook ribs another way.  They were so finger-licking good and just falling off the bone.  My husband worships me now! lol  Definately use HONEY BBQ sauce.  I love Sweet Baby Rays right out of the bottle.

For the first time in my life, my ribs were fabulous - this recipe is wonderful.  I used the broiler instead of the grill (it's 24 degrees outside!) and I used some bock beer in the bbq sauce.  The ribs were falling-of-the-bone tender and ooh soo delicious!!

These were good, but I prefer baking them in the oven, then grilling or broiling.  I like the sauce to be thick and caramelized, and it gets too thin in the crock pot, but that's just my preference.

It really is fall off the bone if you include the slow cooker part, which I highly reccommend! I followed it step by step and couldn't believe how amazing these ribs turned out! Don't put too much sauce on the ribs when you grill them or they may burn. Just a light coat.

The only thing good I can say about these is they were tender but we did not like the taste at all.  Will stick to our regular method.

One of the best recipes I have come across. I have made this recipe several times. I recommend using room temp beer as it seems to make the ribs less tough. Cold beer caused the ribs to be slightly chewy. I have also added a couple shots of Bourbon to uncover an additional flavor in the ribs.

Awesome! First time I've ever made ribs and they turned out like I've been making them for years. So yummy! I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce - sweet and spicy. Don't worry if they're not falling off the bone, let them cook a little longer and they will. I promise!

A lot of work! but the ribs turned out great! Mine didn't fall off the bones, but they were tender and very flavorful. I used the Bourbon Whiskey Sauce and it was fab! Will make again, but not any time soon...Really a lot of work.

There are certain things I cook in this house, and certain things my husband cooks.  He confessed he was a little nervous when he saw the ribs out thawing.  He and our daughter LOVED these ribs!  I skipped the grilling part since the BBQ never starts for me and I put them in a roasting pan with Hickory BBQ sauce and a bit of Jack Daniel's.  Thumbs up!

I didn't precook the ribs in the boiling water.  Boiling them can make the ribs tough and leach out the flavor.  I rubbed the ribs with Tennesse Rubdown from this website the night before, and placed in the slow cooker for 4-5 hours.  I then finished the ribs on grill, basting with the sauce.  This really lets the flavor of the grill shine through but ensures the ribs are so tender the meat falls off the bone.

I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of the sauce when cooking was done.  The meat came out very tender and the taste was awesome.  I was a little skeptical with the beer, but I would not change a thing. Thanks for the recipe

This is an AMAZING recipe!

I refrigerate the ribs after boiling & broiling them(I don't bother turning on the BBQ). I cook them in the crock pot a day or two later. They turn out great and I can spend time preparing the side dishes and socializing with my family & friends.

Thanks for sharing!!!

OK.  Not the best I've ever had.  I followed the recipe but. . .
I expected more BBQ flavor.  The beer was good though.

These truely were Amazing!! My entire family loved them (and I have a family of 7, so it can be tricky finding something that no one complains about) plus we had 2 extra people over that night. I doubled the recipe, and they were gobbled up SO fast! Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Awesome! My hubby said I outdid myself, and I agree. Followed the recipe almost to the letter. I always par boil; it helps tenderize. Before placing on the grill I added salt, pepper and garlic powder. The beer I used was Guiness Dark, and it just made the Sweet Baby Rays sauce so much more rich. Wonderful, fall-off-the-bone  tender and great the next day, too. Thanks for sharing!

I did these in the slow cooker the whole way and they turned out really great.  I did them for 6 hours so that the meat was just coming off the bone and they were really good!

These ribs were amazing!  My husband, who compares everything to the well-known Australian-themed restaurant he used to work for, said that these ribs were better than their's!  That has to be the best compliment he could give anything I cooked!!  The meat did fall right off of the bone.  I made these with the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site and 3 lbs was gobbled up by 3 people!  Just don't forget to remove the membrane from the back of the ribs before you start cooking them.

So tender and delicious you will think you are in a rib joint!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe, I'll never make ribs any other way.  Try these with the absolutely awesome sauce, also from this site.  Note to self: 1-2 min per side on a hot grill is plenty ... just enough to get grill marks and then 2 hrs on high, 2 hrs on low, let sit on warm 1-2 hours and refrigerate.  We think these are best reheated in the oven the next day.  They freeze well.

Oh My Gosh!!!!!!   These were the best ribs I believe I have ever had.  Even though they were a little time consuming these ribs are well worth the wait.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

WOW YUM!!! I had never made ribs before so I was unsure how they would turn out. They were completely AWESOME!! I omitted the grilling step because ... well ... I don't own a grill. :) I used the Bulls Eye with Guiness BBQ sauce and it was delicious! This one is a keeper for sure! Two thumbs up and thanks for a great recipe!

This is a excellent recipe!  The pork just melt in your mouth.  I used a Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce and it was great.  I had to remove some of the sauce and thicken it on the stove by letting it reduce.  Thanks Scott!

My husband and I absolutely love these ribs.  I make my own bbq sauce (2 cups ketchup, 1/2 cup vinegar, 6 tbsp brown sugar, 6 tbsp Worchestershire sauce, 2 tsp liquid smoke and 1 tsp salt - simmer for 20 minutes) and add in only 2/3 of a bottle of beer.  I love the simplicity of this once they're in the slow cooker.  I do the precooking steps but in the winter my bbq is buried under piles of snow (I'm in Northern Canada).  So I broil them in the oven for 4-5 minutes per side.  Same effect.  These are in my slow cooker right now - can't wait for dinner tonight!

This was great! I left out the beer (drank it instead), and I didn't bbq them, as I live in an apartment building where bbqs are banned, but they still turned out fall-off-the-bone delicious! At some point I will try them with beer and bbq, but even the simplified way was awesome!

I used Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce for this recipe and baked them long and slow after the initial boiling. I wish I had added a lot more salt in the boiling water to start with as it would have given it much more of a boost.

I didn't realize ribs could be so easy to make! I skipped the boiling and grilling and just threw them in the slow-cooker for about 6 hours. They were great, really tender and so easy that I'll have to make them again.

This was such a terrific recipe! Made such moist and juicy, fall-off-the-bone, ribs, my young son asked for them for his birthday party! Being "teetotalers" we added 1 cup of apple juice instead of the beer. (Also added a "touch" of maple syrup as we like 'em sweet, here). Thanks for such a fantastic recipe.

Pretty good- I skip step 2 ( apt.living  no grill ) and use  a bottle of spicy  bbq sauce and a  bottle of sweet for a nice contrast. Also I use any beer I have  in fridge.

My ribs turned out very tender and tasty.  Because I boiled my ribs in a large stock pot I added alot of salt and pepper and also added onion powder, garlic powder, season all and 3 boullion cubes.  I used the beer I had on hand which was Miller Lite and it turned out great.

This is a great "rib" recipe!  They fall apart they're so tender.  The only problem I ran into was the grilling.  With it being so cold and windy . . . the wind caused the flames to get bigger/hotter than the setting the grill was on . . . and the ribs caught on fire (within seconds).  For now I'll omit the grilling part of the recipe, once summer hits it's back in though! I don't think the grill is essential to the overall taste of the ribs . . . overall, an excellent recipe and will make over and over again.

I would have given it 5 stars but I didn't really like the beer taste.  I skipped the "pre-cook" part and just put it in the crock (10 hours on low) with some sweet baby rays sauce, onion, garlic, liquid smoke, and porter beer.  I love dark beer and used my favorite.  The ribs were perfectly done - fall off the bone.  However, they had a really weird aftertaste that I can only attribute to the beer.  If I were to make this again, I'd cut out the beer for sure and I think that would make all the difference in the world.

Great recipe option for ribs without a lot of work.  Everyone loved the flavor even though I used too much beer and my sauce got thin.  I'll watch that more closely next time.  Very good and relatively easy to create.

My entire family said that these were the best they ever had. I skipped the boiling and grilling (too lazy)and put them in a 300 degree oven for 4-5 hours. They fell away from the bone.

I've made these twice. They really need to go on the grill for a few minutes on each side, otherwise they taste a little water logged and chewy. It really was a huge difference. We would rate them 2 stars w/out the grill step and 5 stars as written. Very often, the recipes on this site just don't need to be modified.

Like everyone else I did change a few things but this is a great recipe! I omitted the beer but generally followed the recipe and the ribs were very tender! The crockpot made these ribs easy to make. I put the ribs under the broiler for a minute to caramalize the sauce before serving and they turned out great! I have been buying ribs because everyone at our house is a rib critic and I haven't had a good enough recipe to try to make them on my own- until now:)Everyone LOVED them and the only negative comment was that I should have made MORE!  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

Absolutely fantastic! My husband could no longer talk, but only made "mmmm" noises the entire dinner! I used Grolsch Kanon for the beer (we're in Holland) and it's 11% alcohol and gave a great deep beer flavor to the ribs.
I didn't have the bbq set up (wintertime) so I put them under the boiler in the oven for the exact times stated for the bbq and they browned very nicely. Keep an eye on them under the broiler though, yours may be hotter/cooler/closer/etc.
Other than substituting the broiler for the bbq, I followed the recipe exactly and this will be our ribs recipe from now on!!

Ribs were great and falling off the bone.  Didn't have porter beer, but use a can of my son's budweiser and worked just fine.  Used my husband's homemade BBQ and they were fantastic.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe...always a hit.  Can be used with country pork ribs and equally delicious with beef ribs.  Tastes great with good old Carona beer as well.

AWESOME ribs!  These just fell off the bone.  After reading other reviews and being pressed for time, I skipped the grilling step.  But it didn't really matter because these were super tender.  The pulled pork sandwiches I made the next day (from the leftovers) was almost better, as it marinated in sauce in the refrig for 24 hours!

These are amazing! but  the grill time on high is WAY too long...try 2 minutes on high or even one minute! Also for really authentic restaraunt taste, use the bottled bbq sauce sold by the restaraunt! Tony Roma's original sauce is my FAVE on these!

Best ribs I have ever made or even ever eaten. Even excellent cold as leftovers. My boyfriend has already summoned me to make another batch! Culdn't find the Porter Beer, so used Gordon Biersch Smooth Auburn Lager. Only needed to use one bottle.  Used Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce from this website and I think that sauce made the ribs.  Very tender ribs!  Followed recipe to the T.  Only leave ribs on the grill long enough to make seared marks on each side to give it that "grilled taste".  Enjoy!

Instead of grilling, after boiling the ribs i seared them on my griddle pan. and then cooked in the crockpot. my hubby said that is why the meat didnt fall off  the bone. (which was good in our case)
very tender and moist.

I'm adding the 5th star after I made a few adjustments. First, I boiled the ribs in apple juice instead of water, then after grilling I put them in my smoker in place of the slow cooker. Oh yeah, I used three bottles of beer, but drank most of the second one and all the third one. Now we're talkin' good ribs!

The ribs were tender but none of my guests including myself liked the sauce. I think it was the porter. I didn't like the taste of it in the sauce. Very strong.

Has to be the best bbq rib recipe ever!  Made them this evening using the beef back ribs and it was excellent.  Did not grill them, just put them in slow cooker after boiling.  Next time I will try them with the pork ribs and hope they come out just as good.  Used KC Masterpiece for BBQ sauce.

This is the best rib recipe I've tried and I've tried a lot.  Our guests over the weekend said it was the best they've had too.  Yes, prepare to spend a lot of time cooking the ribs and be sure to watch them carefully on the grill or they will burn.  The next time I will use a spicy rub right after boiling to give them a bit more zing. It is best to drink the entire 2nd bottle of beer.

Very good.  I didn't grill them, I broiled them, and they still turned out good.  I also added onions and some lemon juice to the slow cooker.  This recipe is highly dependent on the barbeque sauce that you use.

My family loved this even with the changes I made.  I used pork country style ribs and regular beer instead of porter(?).  Careful of the grilling heat or time depending on your grill.  High was a little too much and would keep it on the low end of time - 5 minutes.  Used a local restaurant's bbq sauce, Sticky Fingers' Carolina Sweet and would definately use it again.

The song, He Ain't Heavy...he's my brother," applies here.  It's not too much work to do the 3-steps cuz the results are bodelicious!  I've always boiled the excess fat from ribs & chicken w/skin before grilling so no problem for me.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce with a jigger of Jack Daniels added.  Too much sauce & too hi of heat will make flames & burn your ribs.  Served with Mexican Cornbread Salad, baked yams & ice cold melon platter.   Yum OH!!!   Thanks for sharing recipe!!!

Yummy! I boiled the ribs and put some seasoning salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. Then I just poured in three different kinds of bbq sauces I had laying around. Mine cooked in 3.5 hours. Loved it!!!!

This is a GREAT recipe. I used the Amazing Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce recipe listed on this web site. AWESOME together.The homemade sauce made these ribs even better. I will use this and the sauce recipe again and again!

We loved this recipe! I broiled the ribs for about 6 minutes on each side instead of grilling and then put them in the crockpot for a few hours. They were so tender. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!!

These are definitely deserving of the name Amazing Ribs! I used a rack of spareribs, used Sweet Baby Ray's Original Sauce for the BBQ, and used Flying Armadillo Porter from a microbrewery in my neighborhood (Sweetwater Tavern). I really believe that you need to use a porter, or some sort of dark beer, for this recipe. It adds a dimension of flavor that lite beers don't have. I made the recipe exactly as stated, and the meat literally fell off the bone. Thank you, Scotty!

These were some of the best ribs I have ever tasted.  Extremely tender and flavorful.  In addition, they were so easy to make.  After you get them into the slow cooker most of the work is done.

For the second step I used my George forman grill, and for the third step I used the oven at 200 degrees for 2 hours and basted every 30 min with bbq sauce, very tasty.  I also sprinkled on some grill mates seasoning by mccormick's.  I loved this recipe!  It was the first time I ever made ribs and they came out perfectly tender!  I have made this twice already, my husband loves them!

I really didn't find this recipe to be to much work.....regardless, it was well worth it.  My ribs came out very tender...just how I wanted them.  I also used a regular beer & had no problems.  I'd definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks!!!!!

This was a great recipe. I also just skipped the grilling process and they turned out great! I didn't like the beer flavor that much and will use water next time but the rest of my guests didn't seem to mind.

Don't change a thing, I assume they will work as well in the oven, but I did mine in a slow cooker. They were perfect, I thought I would have leftovers, but they were gone before even I could get seconds. Thank you Scotty.

I actually used beef back ribs for the recipe and made them for a house warming party.  Everyone loved them.  Simmering them in the crock pot made all the difference in the flavor and texture.  A must try for any rib lover.

This recipe does produce great, tender ribs.  I did not like the strong beer flavor though, & think I will try other BBQ sauce recipes & cook the ribs this way.

These ribs were fabulous. I invited my in-laws over and they were a big hit. They were so tender, the meat was falling off the bone. They had lots of flavour too. I used Bull's Eye chicken and Rib Fiasco when grilling them and Bold Original in the slow cooker. Thanks for the great recipe. It will most definately be made again.

I continue to be amazed with the disparity between the reviews and the end result of recipes on this site. I slow-baked the ribs, covered, in a low-temp oven, used country-style ribs (which should have made no difference in taste), Jack Daniels BBQ Sauce, Budweiser Beer and followed directions. Although I cannot find the right word to describe the taste, the ribs looked good but ended up not being eaten.

Came out tender, moist, and fall off the bone.  I also substituted broiling on high for the grilling part since we are out of propane right now.  I used Famous Dave's sauce which was very tangy and had a good kick to it which is what I was going for.  I think they will be great with our favorite sauce Sweet Baby Rays next time around.

"Amazing" is the word for these ribs, Scotty! Only thing I did different was, I seared them in a frying pan, instead of the grill. For fall of the bone and delicious ribs, try these!

I made these for a family dinner and had rave reviews. Tender and full of great rib flavor that was not overwhelmed by BBQ sauce. I used apple juice in place of beer and the results were "amazing." Thanks.

couple things: 1) remove the rib membrane!!! 2) These don't need to be grilled, skip that step, just boil to remove some of the fat. Also I overcooked mine in the slow cooker (doh. I had them on high for ~4 hours and they were ready, but we had to leave so I set them on low till we got home, then warm overnight. Way too long of cooking time, the next day they shredded too much. Good to make a sandwich out of but I was wanting some more solid pieces of meat.  These are excellent when cooked for the proper amount of time though :)

Very good recipe. I skipped the grilling steps and kept them in the crock pot longer. I also added honey to the recipe to sweeten the ribs a bit. Delicious!

They were good, but not great.  And with all the effort and time, it just wasn't worth it for me.  Everybody else loved them and devoured them, but I expected more.

These were a big hit at my last party.  Meat was falling off the bone like it should.  I made a few changes.  I boiled the ribs for about 25 minutes - skipped the grilling step - put them right into the crock pot on high for 4 hours.  I didn't use any beer but added 2.5 cups Jack Daniels instead.  Yes, Jack is a MUST for ribs!  I also added Liquid Smoke and Pickapeppa.  Delish!!!

Fantastic, easy-to-read and easy-to-use recipe. Straightforward and came out with some delicious ribs. This is a very basic recipe, and as with most BBQ you can add whatever you want to flavor these ribs. I added them to the slow-cooker and then put them over my ancient weber BBQ over lump charcoal and got some good hickory smoke chips going. They turned out fabulous.

Wow - that was excellent!  I also opted not to grill before putting in the oven and I was very pleased anyway!  This might be the only way I do ribs from now on!  I did put the beer in the bbq sauce and it was yummy (I may have reserved some for myself tho!)...Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe provided the only way my husband has been able to make "fall off the bone" ribs. He has been trying for years and could never get it quite right. You have to watch the amount of beer added as you can get a strong beer taste. We have cooked this a couple of times now for our family and a crowd and everyone loved them.

Amazing is just one adjective I used to describe the ribs. Each of the three cooking steps all came together when done. The best part was how everyone I served thought I was amazing. Now, the only way I'll cook ribs.

This is the easiest recipe ever. The meat was falling off of the bone when they were done. The meat was so tender and juicy. I've made this recipe quite a few times now.

I found this to be excellent and easy if you skip the grilling step. I knew I wasn't going to grill them, so I added some liquid smoke to the boiling process the second time I cooked them.  It made a big difference in the undertones when it was done.  As others have said, it is only as good as the BBQ sauce and beer you use, so pick something you like the flavor of.  I used Stub's Mesquite BBQ  the second time and found it had an authentic "Grilled" flavor unlike the sauce I used the first go round which was more tomato based.

I added some garlic to the bbq sauce and broiled them instead of firing up the grill. Everything else was by the recipe and they were perfection.

My favorite recipies are those that allow me to do all the work before my guests arrive. I made these for superbowl. It was great to have these ready and waiting in the crockpot at halftime. I had prepared baked beans ,cornbread and pasta salad. I was able to enjoy the game and have my meal on the table before Bruce was singing his second song. This recipe is very easy and the ribs were very tender. I used bottled barbecue sauce. The one I chose was good but I will probably try others until I find something I love. I am looking for a good brown sauce that has less tomato flavor.

very tasty! the only thing i did different was use corona beer and i will definitely try porter beer next time, the corona made it a bit too sour tasting. great method for cooking, fell right off the bone and still had a nice crispy outside!

We have made this recipes over and over.  It is fall off the bone good every time.  We have never actually done the first step on the BBQ though.  A family favorite.  The only problem is there are no leftovers!

I used 3lbs of baby back ribs for 2 people (more than enough leftovers).  I also used 1 can of Bud Light (what I had on hand) and 1 1/2 bottles of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  Turned out very good, meat was very tender and flavorful, although next time I probably only need 1 bottle of BBQ sauce.

Great option for winter BBQ. I did a southern rub the night before, then skipped the first two steps and just placed the ribs in the crockpot raw with beer, seasoning and a bottle of BBQ sauce. I simmered the meat on low for eight hours and they were perfect. Meat fell right from the bone and the person eating the meal gave me two "mmmm's" and three "this is SO good." comments!

These ribs were really easy to make and the best we've ever had. We've never made ribs before and it was a hit even with the kids.

We skipped the grill part and only boiled the ribs before putting them in the slow cooker and only needed to use 1 can of beer. The sauce was just the right consistency and the ribs just fell apart.

Wow! I keep coming back to this! Fantastic ribs.  I wasn't sure how this would turn out but I tried freezing the ribs , after the grilling, in the sauce. and put them frozen in the crock pot and let them sit all day.  It turned out great and no different then when made fresh.  This is a great way to have an easy weekday meal.

Excellent Scotty!!  I've always started my ribs by boiling and then baking at a low temp.  But your way is much more tender and moister!!  I have a new way of cooking ribs.  Thanks!!  And, by the way, when I opened the 2nd can of beer, I drank it myself!

Great rib recipe!  I usually bake them for 4 hours, but the slow cooker makes it so easy!  I used boneless country style ribs (by accident), Cattleman's bbq sauce, and Miller Lite beer.  The boiling got rid of most of the fat, I skipped the grilling, and I cooked on low for 6 hours.  It came out great!  I can't wait to use this on baby back ribs.

I rated this recipe 3 cause my husband didn't really like the tomato type ribs.  
However, the ribs were very very fall off the bone good for me.  I made my own BBQ sauce which I think made it that much better.

The ribs were the best I had and a complete success at dinner time. Rather than bake them, I put them in a slow cooker for 5 hours on low heat. The meat just fell off the bones. This is definetly a KEEPER.

Very tasty but a lot of work (& cleanup)!  Be careful not to let the ribs burn on the grill - especially if you use a sweet BBQ sauce.  Great if you don't know exactly WHEN you will serve dinner because you can turn the slow cooker to low to keep warm and the ribs just get more tender.  I plan to try with boneless "country style" ribs next!

I wanted ribs for dinner and this recipe looked amazing!  I started around noon and followed all three steps, but I actually got a bonus dish out of it for lunch!  I took the leftover water that the ribs were boiled in and used that as the liquid for a spicy jumbalaya.  I used a pre-packaged mix and added Hillshire Farms hot links as my meat and it was spectacular! 

For the ribs in the crock pot, I used Sweet Baby Ray's (my staple) and added 1 Miller Light and 1 Yuengling Lager.  This made the sauce quite a bit thinner so we weren't overpowered with sauce so much that we lost that wonderful rib flavor.  These were the best ribs I ever had hands down!

Gave this recipe a Georgia twist with Johnny Harris BBQ Sauce (Savannah, GA) and Sweetwater 420 Extra Pale Ale (from Atlanta). Boneless pork short ribs were a lot less messy, took up less room in the crock pot, and were tender and tangy using the exact same cooking times in the recipe. We opted to add a bit less beer to the pot and the sauce was perfect! The sweet tender ribs were yummy with fresh baked cornbread and baked beans. A classic southern dish.

Soooo easy but don't count on any leftovers.  It's that good.  They were salt & peppered before spending 15 min. on each side in a hot oven before going in the slow cooker with BBQ sauce.  A few minutes under the broiler before serving finalized it.  They were too tender to finish on the grill.  Forget a knife as the meat falls off the bone!

It is against the law to boil ribs. Especially baby back ribs, they only get smoked or grilled. The rib police ARE watching.

I will for sure make this again!! These ribs were so tender, the fell off the bone.  I boiled, then seared on the grill, then put in the slow cooker.  Mine were only able to be in the slow cooker on high for about 2 hours.  (I ran out of time!)  However, the were still SO tender.  They were a huge hit with my family who had come over for dinner and not a single morsel was left!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Oh My Goodness!  The best ribs ever.  I had a couple of friends who said they tasted better than a restaurants ribs.  After 12 years of marriage, my husband finally loved something that I made...(I don't cook that often and don't cook very well...LOL).

Really AMAZING! I added some boneless chops as well because I didn't have enough ribs and the boneless turned out kinda hard & dry (I think they were too lean). I used one bottle of Bulls Eye for chicken & ribs and added 1/4 c of oj to the bottle to get every last bit of sauce. Everyone raved and they were all eaten. Next time I will use ribs only.

The ribs were very tender and tasty.  I used bottled BBQ sauce.  I thought it was a little too sweet.  Next time I will choose an other BBQ sauce.  I will definitely make them again.  Hubby loved them.

Awesome and appropriately named.  If you've got the time, and the beer, these rock.  Falling off the bone melt in your mouth messy and superb.

amazing is right, according to my husband. I made them as directed and my husband loved them.. I am a vegetarian and I don't make him meat dishes very often.. looks like he knows I can cook meat now! Hope he doesn't get too used to it;)  He raved about it and was proud that i even touched meat n the first place.

Excellent!  Boiled baby back ribs as recipe suggests and put in crock pot for 4-5 hours on high...turned to low when they were about to fall off the bone.  Porter beer purchased at Buehlers.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

These ribs came out perfectly.  I, too, used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce by Kevin, and together these two are really deserving of the name "Amazing". These are a bit time consuming, but perfection does take time, and I rate baste on the taste and texture, not on how it took a bite out of my schedule. Greatness takes patience, and these ribs are a great illustration of that. P.S. It seems the longer it takes, the better they get!

Very rarely do I give something 5 stars.
This was fantastic! I did however skip the grill due to time. I made a batch of sauce and threw it in the crockpot with half a bottle of pumpkin ale. The meat was so tender! Then I like to set the glaze, so I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to set the glaze and everybody loved them. I went out and stocked up on baby back ribs to make for my company when they arrive in a few weeks! Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a keeper! I blew my husband away with this one. He's strange about not eating meat on the bone but he didn't even say a word except 'mmmmmmmm'. Once all the prep work is done you can just walk away while they work their magic. Really, a MUST TRY!

I made 'Old Style BBQ Sauce' from this site.  The sauce is fantastic.  I let the sauce cook for 8 hours and then added the ribs uncooked on low for another 2hrs and then on high for the remaining time.  I absolutely do not recommend cooking the raw ribs in the sauce.  It turns out too liquidy and too fatty. The meat was tender and fanatastic, but we prefer our sauce a little thicker.  Will definitely try again.

This recipe was great!  My boyfriend and I had never made ribs before, and these were easy and delicious!  The only mistake we made was that the store only had spare ribs, which had too much fat on them for our liking.  We will definitely stick to baby back and will be making again!  We paired this with a homemade BBQ sauce recipe from this website, we suggest you do the same.  Thanks!

These were good but not GREAT.  First of all I think I used the wrong ingredients.  I used an amber beer and cheap BBQ sauce.  Also, I live where it gets really cold in the winter so outside grilling was NOT an option.  Instead I used my indoor Geaorge Foreman grill and it worked just fine.  Everyone liked them, but next time I'll use good stuff.

I followed the recipe but started with frozen ribs so the ribs did not get as tender as I would have liked them to be. Next time I would thaw them. Otherwise this was my first attempt at ribs and I think it is a very good technique to get the best ribs.

After reading many of your reviews, and trying out doing short beef ribs from the top of my head.  I thought I would give a tip.  For the Beef short ribs I made I just grilled them in my George Foreman grill and then tossed them in the crock pot with two types of b b q sauce and then forgot about them for about 5 hours....delish!!!!

I have participated in a rib cook off every year for a few years now, trying a new recipe every time. This was by far the best! I took 1st place and for the first time I had fall off the bone ribs!
I added sliced onion and garlic to the bottom of the crock pot during the slow cooking and also added a teaspoon of Chinese chili.
excellent recipe! I'm making it again tomorrow for a pool party!

Everyone in my family absolutely loved them!  I would recommend slow cooking for the full 3 hrs just to have that superb tenderness.  I also smothered more bbq sauce on them after & it gave them that extra saucy touch.  The grilling is a great touch prior to slow cooking!  Lastly, i used Asahi beer because i couldnt find any porter beer in local markets.  Delicious!

Tested this recipe out last night with one rack of ribs for our family because I'm planning on preparing ribs for Christmas dinner.  After boiling and then searing in a pan on high heat (too cold outside for the grill!), I used the oven method instead of the crock pot because I wanted to try out the method I will inevitably have to use on Christmas day - far too many ribs will need to be cooked to put them in the crock pot!  They did indeed fall off the bone, smelled delicious while cooking, and tasted great.  I had to use a bottle of New Castle because I can't find the bottle of porter I bought earlier this week but I don't think it made a difference.  I prepared Bubba's BBQ sauce (on this site) and used that with great success.  I highly recommend this recipe!  Thank you!

Recommended!  Excellent, easy recipe!  I've used this a couple of times; skipped the grill both times (because I didn't have time!).  Nonetheless, excellent!  Look, the big key here is the sauce you choose and how well it partners with the porter beer.  Choose your sauce carefully.  I've used Sweet Baby Ray's Original and also JohnBoy and Billy's Original Grillin' Sauce.  Both good, but it all depends upon what your family likes!

This was a great recipe. Followed recipe to the t. Cooked in oven instead of crock pot. Used a barbecue sauce called RED MUD from a small town in Texas. Highly recommend this barbecue sauce. Friends and I devoured this great pork ribs.

Followed directions exactly and believe the last 3 hours boiled off all the bbq'd flavor.  Next time i will just boil and end with grilling.  I want the carmelized taste......

I am kosher so I use beef or lamb in place of the pork. I also do not boil my ribs but use a dry rub of the salt and peppers for an hour before continuing with the recipe.Delish!!!!

These ribs were so TENDER!  The meat fell off the bone.  Worth the effort!  Still partial to the smoke flavor of ribs done on a smoker for eight hours.

This was so good, we ate them all before I could finish the side dishes!  I used the broiler instead of the grill since it's winter now, and used a rib rub for this step instead of the BBQ sauce.  I also added 1 can beef consomme, some garlic and onion to the slow cooker.  I will make this  many times again!

These are FANTASTIC!  We've made them twice now, the first time skipping the bbq step, with great results.  However, I truly think that they were better including this step.  We used Red Tail chipotle BBQ sauce which gave them some spice and Sierra Nevada Porter.  Try this with some molasses mashed sweet potatoes. UMMMMM!

Very good! I took everyone’s advice and used a really good porter beer (Make sure you use a beer you like because you can really taste it) which gave them a great unique flavor. The only bad thing I have to say about this recipe is it still inset a tender as another ribs recipe I have made. What I suggest doing instead of boiling them is wrap them up in foil with sliced lemons and onions and let them slow cook in the oven. Then pull them out and let them steam in the foil for a few hours (or over night). Then continue with the barbeque and crock pot. That keeps the flavor in and they really do just fall off the bones.

This was fantastic!! The only change I really made was that I only used 2 slabs of baby back ribs (4.67lbs). For the beer I used New Belgium 1554 Black Ale.(YUMMY!!!) For the BBQ sauce I used "Best Carolina BBQ Meat Sauce" from this website. I now have a rib recipe that I will use EVERY TIME!!

The porter beer gives the sauce on these ribs a real seet and tangy flavor that is pretty good. It's probablyh better not to put them on a grill with high heat though, as this burned the outside of mine in less than 5 minutes.

Very good but lost a star because they are a lot of work but it is nice that you can make up ahead if entertaining.  My amazing ribs were simmering in the crock and my beer butt Chicken (from this site) was quite independenatly slow cooking on the grill.  I enjoyed our guests and seemingly appeared to have pulled it all together effortlessly.  What a misleading impression of reality!! lol

DIVINE! My V-E-R-Y picky 7 year old LOVED this, said it was the best ribs she's ever had! I only used one bottle of porter beer in this. Sent the leftovers with my son for his lunch (they have a microwave in the lunchroom) and he exclaimed that he LOVES taking home lunch, especially if it's RIBS! Thanks so much!

Great and fantastic. Not hard to make, just hard to wait for. Almost like at a restaurant, but it needs a little more smokey flavor. The 10 mins. on the grill didn't give it enough smokeyness. However, they were the best ribs I've ever made!

Delicious. Extremely tender. I used extra crushed red pepper during the boil and Sweet Baby Ray's brand barbecue sauce. I put the ribs on the grill at high but 5 minutes later when I came back they were burtn. Watch them carefully. I didn't have any beer on hand so I added water instead. I cooked them with the slow cooker on low for 7hrs.

Only as good as the quality of meat and barbecue sauce used.  Convenient because labor is done hours before dinner time. These are good but not the the best!

My first, I give this five stars because of its simplicity and how delicious they came out.  I skipped throwing the ribs on the grill.  Boiled and cooked them as directed.  Falling off the bone and very tasty!  This will be my new way of making easy and delicious ribs, because typically I’m challenged with time. There’s nothing like a light load of prep time. Great recipe

Pretty good recipe. I usually sear my ribs on the outdoor grill until I have grill marks on each side. I then put them in the crock pit on low for about4-5 hrs.

My family, especially my husband loved these ribs.  I've made them a few times trying different suggestions and what I came up with is to dry rub them first with a mixture of salt, minced garlic, onion powder, pepper, and cumin after I cut them in 2-3 rib portions.  Then I cooked them in the crock-pot on high for 2 1/2 hours.  I then grilled them for 10-15 min and lathered them with barbecue sauce.  I put them back in the crock pot for another 2 1/2- 3 hours, on high, adding additional barbecue sauce.  I checked them frequently, wanting tender ribs, but not so much that they were falling off the bone in the crock pot.  Delicious.

Real good and real easy to do.  Still looking for more rib recipes, does not hurt, but I will make this again, if there is beer in the house.

Best ribs I've ever had! Instead of red pepper flakes my husband used creole seasoning. This recipe is a definite keeper!

I had planned on making this recipe but had to make so many deviations, it really wasn't the same.  first, Safeway didn't have any baby back ribs out on the weekend so I ended up getting some really nice meaty country ribs.  second, our rainy season has already set in and no one was willing to stand in the rain and grill them.  I put them in the crock pot, didn't think about boiling them first or worrying about the grease.  third, I hate the taste of beer and they were so expensive I wasn't about to ruin them with beer.  I remembered using root beer or something to cook them once before but didn't have any of that either.  But we DID have a case of coke in the fridge so I used a can of that.  they were awesome.

A little extra effort and time required but so worth it. This is my son's favorite ribs recipe; the grilling before slow cooking gives a wonderful flavor.  This is now my go-to ribs recipe that the whole family enjoys.

Ok, I started by boiling spare ribs cut into 4 pieces- I pulled off the tough silver skin first- heard about that on BBQ University :)  (6 1/2 lbs)  for half hour in water, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes then added 2 smashed garlic cloves and a spoonful of beef bouillon. Then my husband smoked them for 1 hour. I seasoned with salt pepper and garlic powder. Then we put them in the slow cooker with the bourbon whiskey BBQ Sauce by Kevin from this site along with a can of beer and cooked on High for 3 hours....finished up by broiling for a few minutes to carmelize...delicious- and I thought we already knew how to do ribs- This was fantastic though! Our new Go-to recipe!

Didn't have enough time but they came out tasting great! I finished them in a pot on the stove because my slow cooker was a little too slow for our timeline. Used a Guiness can and bottle of sauce. Delish!

I used this recipe to make my dad some ribs for a father's day present.  The ribs were a hit and I will use this method again, only thing I would do is leave the ribs in the slow cooker a few hours longer so that they will get even more tender.

Great recipe!!  I love the triple cooking method - perfect ribs every time.  I vary the sauce a bit, but it must work because there are never any leftovers.

These were very good. I am given it a  a 5 stars despite my boyfriend mentioned he prefers the 3 steps recipe when I finish them in the oven. I thought these were sooooooo tender, yummy and easy! I am given this recipe a 5 cause these were a breeze to make
