This was good, but I think the water to flour ratio is off b/c I was left with a pretty dry/hard dough. After letting it rest in the fridge for a few days it formed into the pan fine, but I could tell it needed more liquid, so next time I will add more water while mixing.  This was a nice basic dough and the kids liked it a lot. I will be trying this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The instructions leave out when to add the EVO. I added it after the first rising before mixing the third cup of flour and it seemed to turn out okay. Easy to work. Makes a nice crispy crust on a pizza stone in a 450 degree oven.

I used this in Stromboli and it was very good. I can't wait to use it for pizza. It was flavorful, great texture and crunch. It was easy to work with too when I had to roll it out for the Stromboli. It held up to rolling although it split during baking as things expanded but that may have been my fault. (read: that was my fault all the way.) 
I think this one has everything I'm looking for is pizza dough. I will update when I actually make pizza with it. We'll see how it holds up on the grill.

All I did different was drizzle some water and evo during the 1-2 minute 3rd cup bread flour phase... just enough to get dough from too dry to just right.  Did everything else per recipe.  Turns out beautiful.  Crust looks and tastes like pizzeria!
