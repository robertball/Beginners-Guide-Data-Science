What a beautiful photo!  What a simple idea.  HOWEVER...I would like to title my review of the recipe... 

Hard Cooking Lessons Learned From The Making of Banana Spring Rolls.

1.  No small children in the room during the making of this recipe.  (Swearing is inevitable).
2.  If you buy the crisp spring roll skins...you need to soak them before trying to wrap the banana.
3.  Do not soak them all together.  They will stick like a fly on the windshield.
4.  Do not soak them too long.  They turn into something that resembles somthing that nasty construction workers cough and spit out.
5.  Wrap the bananas and seal well.  Otherwise, when they hit the oil, out comes the banana, out comes the sugar.
6.  Make sure you have everything ready and waiting in it's place.  Burning bananas while you are trying to wrap just sucks!  Have the paper towels, tongs, and whatever else ready!
7.  Rolling these babies in cinnamon and sugar improves this dessert tremendously!
8.  Most important tip.  Do not bite into hot banana roll!  
9.  Make sure small children are still out of the room when you decide to ignore my advice and bite into that hot spring roll anyways.

This tasted alright but I'm not sure it was worth the mess, swearing and aggravation that ensued.

OK, great variations already, and of course, I had to step it up for my own guilty pleasures!
USE EGG ROLL WRAPPERS!
USE PLANTAINS! Yummier!
I used dark brown sugar on my plantains, then dusted them with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves before rolling.
I let them cool BRIEFLY on a paper bag, didn't stick, then placed them on wire racks.
Then I drizzled melted dark chocolate in a zig zag design over the tops of the rolls. Slice diagonally and serve with fresh tropical fruit and berries on a powdered sugar dusted platter.
To die for, I swear!

Served it for guests and family and everyone loved it.  My 9 yr old son helped me make them.  
We broke the bananas in half and rolled them in  brown sugar-cinnamon mix.  Then rolled the banana in the wrapper and sealed.  We made them ahead and put them in plastic wrap in the fridge until it was time to serve dessert.  It only takes a few seconds to fry them.  I cut them in half after cooling a second.  I sliced on a diagonal instead of straight across because then they look prettier on the plate when you stand them up.  Served with a scoop of vanilla and a drizzle of caramel sauce.  Put blueberries and cut up strawberries around the plate with a sprig of mint and the crowd went wild!  We have already made them again!  The whole thing went together very quickly! You can dress them up or eat plain, either way they are great!

Yummy. This is also pretty much a great recipe for a popular Filipino dessert called, "Turon". You can use either the bananas or ripe cooking bananas (also known as Plantains - make sure they're yellow and spotted), which I preferred to use for a sweeter taste. However, if you use Plantains, you'll need more spring roll wrappers. I used 2 Plantains which made about 12 rolls.

This is pretty good - reminds me of the banana rolls growing up in the Philippines. The only changes I'd do it actually use plaintain (cooking bananas) and jackfruit (sliced and flattened). The jackfruit's already sweet so you don't have to put too much sugar. You can get the bananas and jackfruit at most Asian or ethnic stores.

If you are counting calories, instead of deep frying just bake them for 15 minutes, be sure to brush a little olive or canola oil first so they will be crunchy and to prevent sticking. Delicious!!!

i feel bad rating this 4 instead of 5, because i really enjoyed them and thought this was a quick, unusual dessert. but there is a lot of room for personalization and "improvement". other fruit might be added with the bananas, as might some spices (i think i'll try some cinnamon and/or nutmeg with the bananas, or some allspice with some other fruits). also, mind your manner of wrapping and be sure you seal the rolls so that the oil doesn't saturate the fruit. a great recipe i'm sure i'll make again.

We found it tasty, but we think that for starters a better direction on dough would be welcome. We will do this again with strawberries and will post our comments.

These were so messy and time consuming and not worth the effort.  The taste is okay but not like the real thing.  My oil was destroyed and I had to soak my tongs for 45 minutes to get them clean. Plus it says to drain them on paper towel but if they stay there any longer than 2 minutes they stick to the paper.  I will not make again.

A classic dessert that we love.  Either regular bananas or very ripe plaintains can be used.  It's all about preference. I also used lumpia wrappers and make sure to use water/flour paste for sealing.  Its even more yummy when drizzled with  toffee sauce.

These were really good. One tip for sealing the wraapers. Instead of using water which can cause spatter when frying the rolls, I brush some lightly beaten egg to seal them. It doesn't spatter in the oil. Also I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon on the bananas with the brown sugar. Very tasty.

Simply delicious!  I took the time to find spring roll wrappers made with wheat flour and not rice.  The most time consuming thing about preparing this was separating the spring rolls.  We didn't use a lot of brown sugar and will use more next time and will also use riper bananas.  We sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar as recommended by others and that really adds to the flavor.  Try this with cherry pie filling, serve with vanilla ice cream and drizzle with chocolate!

Really good and pretty easy. Most important! Use fairly ripe bananas! I like green ones typically but in this recipe they provide no flavor. Cut the bananas into 3 pieces, then cut them in half lengthwise. Take one piece, add a few chocolate chips, roll it once in the eggroll, then add the other side of the half and roll it all up. (So the 1/3 of the banana is split in half but rolled together). Fry at medium high heat. Too low it gets greasy, too high the insides won't get hot. To me, this is the hardest part of the recipe. Just be sure the oil is at med hi heat before putting the eggroll in. It should cook in ~1 minute (keep turning it). Roll in cinnamon sugar or drizzle in chocolate, or caramel sauce...or any combination of the 3. Garnish with raspberries and/or ice cream. Delicious, and believe it or not, fairly easy. Just try it yourself a day or so before a party so u know what you're doing. Good luck!

Great spring rolls! I used Banh Trang Spring Roll Skins. I also used cut up bananas sprinkled with sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I have to soften my spring rolls before I roll them out. So I soaked for a few seconds in warm water 'til "foldable", shaked off excess water then filled and rolled. I made 3 to test them out and I'd recommend cooking them on medium heat because if it's too hot they'll brown quickly without cooking the inner skin. Basically, if their not thoroughly cooked they'll still be rubbery/soft on the inside. I also figured that before frying them, roll them into a mixture of sugar and cinnamon then toss 'em into the fryer. I have tons of spring roll paper to use and a lot of bananas. Gonna be a great treat! Thanks for sharing.

I wanted to give these three and a half stars, but four will suffice.  These were pretty good--next time I'll use less brown sugar, for certain.  They were way too sweet for me.  But for simplicity and the fact that if I'd wanted, I could just make one or ten or two of these, I think they're phenomenal.  I added some strawberries to the bowl and I prefered my bites to have strawberries in them, so next time I will add them in before cooking.  These fry *really* fast, about five seconds is all they need in the fryer.  I didn't realize how fast they'd cook, so I burned my first batch.  I'm not sure if everyone's would brown that fast, so just keep an eye on them from the second you put them in.  All in all, we enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was wonderful!  Very easy.  I have never even made spring rolls before.  I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and then drizzled it with honey.  Yummy!  Can't wait to try it out on the in-laws.

I was excited to try this recipe. It was similar tasting to a local asian resturant. I too added cinnamon with the brown sugar and drizzled carmel sauce on the plate and served with vanilla bean ice cream. The only problem I had was that I didn't use enough oil. The outside was cooked but some of the inner part of the spring roll was raw (my fault) this is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

My 4 year old daughter prepared these.  I did the frying.  We added cinnamon to the recipe just for an extra step for my little helper and some added flavor.  We used wonton wrappers because that's what we had on hand.  I fried them once my daughter left the kitchen area.  Fried in about one inch of vegetable oil.  I turned every 30 seconds or so to ensure even frying since the wrap jobs were not all even. We did have to be careful and wait for them to cool a bit before biting into because the banana inside was extremely hot.  Delicious. Eat same day they were not good the next day in my daughter's lunch.

what a yummy simple idea.  I made a couple with chocolate chips instead of brown sugar, and I even made one with just chocolate chips -no  bannana.  I will try this with several variations.

These are awesome.  My students mother makes these, so we did them a little different.  I rolled the bananas in brown sugar.  Then when we fried them,  It was in a pan of oil with brown sugar added to it.  It made a carmelized sugar coating on the outside.  Delicious

These were ok but I had problems getting the spring roll wrappers to get crispy. I'll definitely be giving this another shot, but next time I'll probably use egg roll wrappers instead of spring roll wrappers.

I am serving an Asian-themed meal for supper club at the end of this week, so I went ahead and tried out this dessert on my husband last night. We love the fried banana dessert at our favorite Thai restaurant. This wasn't quite restaurant quality, but still very tasty. I used spring roll wrappers because that's what I could find. I also used a cinnamon-sugar combo on some of them and will definitely do that for all next time.  I baked in the oven according to the alternate directions on the spring roll wrappers. Brushed with butter but next time will do vegetable oil and hope for a more "golden" result. Will also be sure to really seal all of the edges well because we had a lot of ingredients bubble out. I cut them in half and served warm with vanilla ice cream. I might try to find coconut ice cream which is even better with it. Skipping the frying made this super-easy and quick.

I've made these several times now. If you follow the directions these are super EASY to make and very tasty! The only thing I did different the second time around, was to cut back on the brown sugar and add a pinch of cinnamon. These are always a big hit in my family. I prepare the mixture first, wrap, set aside, heat oil and begin.

I think it is pretty with a dollop of ice cream in the middle of the plate, surrounded by the rolls cut in half and standing on the cut side. Then...drizzle with caramel sauce. Add a couple of razberries or strawberries for color.

These are Awsome! I used the Rasberry Sauce found on the site and some whipped cream to make them even better. They are much better if you use more banana. I tried them at a Chinese resteraunt and these are almost as good, the only thing that would make them better is a little bit of coconut ice cream (regular ice cream doesn't taste nearly as good). I forgot the brown sugar, it doesn't really need it though.

These were delicious! I followed some other reviewer's suggestions and rolled the banana in a brown sugar/cinnamon mixture before wrapping them. They were so quick to make and everyone loved them. Oh, I also used egg roll wrappers instead of spring roll wrappers...just what I had on hand.

at a three star resort, this would be the dessert that was featured on the menu. I enjoyed making them, it was fun.
Adding some ice cream made it easier to go down.

The center was delicious!  The outside with the spring roll wrappers was difficult to eat.  Will try again soon with egg roll wrappers.

The best wrappers to use for these are made in the Philippines; they're called lumpia wrappers and you'll find them in the refrigerator/freezer section of a Filipino/Asian grocery store. They need to be thawed before use. If you're really lucky, you'll find the ones that have wax paper between each wrapper, making it easy to separate. Otherwise, you'll have to be patient and try not to rip them as you separate them. Keep moist by placing a wet paper towel on the ones you're not using.

I tried this delicious recipe twice.  I used small bananas and cut them in half (not lengthwise).  Sprinkled brown sugar under and on top of the banana.  The first time I made these they turned out perfect, didn't stick to the paper towels.  The second time I was in a bit of a rush and put too much brown sugar in, which made the spring rolls stick to the paper towels, so I did away with the paper towels the second time.  Tasted great both times.  One other thing, I shallow-fried them in a wok instead of deep frying.  I will definitely be making these again.

I didn't follow much of the recipe, so I 4-starred it because I'm not sure what the actual recipe tasted like. LOVE the idea though! Made spring rolls and had some wrappers left over, so I tried this. Mashed up a banana with a fork, added some brown sugar and cinnamon and nutmeg and baked it at 425 for 20 minutes and they were out of sight!

The photo sold me on trying this recipe. However mine didn't look like the photo at all. I used spring roll wrappers (which are also called rice paper) They expanded so much during frying I thought they'd explode so I took them out of the oil before completely crispy. So...they were a little soggy.

Super easy!  I used wonton wrappers and made them minis because that's all my grocery store had.  I cut the banana in thirds and cut each third into quarters. Mixed cinnamon into the brown sugar, wrapped and fried in one inch of oil.  They came out fabulous!  The brown sugar/cinnamon turns to syrup when cooked.  I'm hoping to keep them refrigerated and serve them tomorrow night after warming in the oven.
Note: These were not so great after refrigerating and reheating.  I recommend eating them right away!

This was pretty good, my daughter liked it better than I did. I used plantains and next time I don't think I'll do that. I'd never had plantains before and I don't think they are my thing. Everything else went great though, they are easy and quick to make. I used lumpia wrappers separated by paper and didn't have any problems with them tearing.

Spring rolls with Plaintains Are Delicious and alot better and less the hassle than these.
