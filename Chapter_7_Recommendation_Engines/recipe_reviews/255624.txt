I didn't have fat free half-and-half so I used the heavy whipping cream that I had on hand.  My family doesn't like raisins in their cooked desserts so I substituted 1/4 cup finely diced, crystallized ginger as we love gingery foods, I increased the pumpkin pie spice to an even 1 tbsp.  I used pureed Kabocha squash which has a pumpkin/sweet potato flavor and texture.  Used walnuts in place of the pecans (didn't have on hand).  The next time I make this, I plan to mix all the wet ingredients before pouring over the bread crumbs.  I ended up with a delightful pudding on top of a bread pudding that was a bit bland though my husband gobbled it up.  I don't have a 7 x 11 inch baking dish so I used a large, well greased and lightly floured, bundt pan.  The bread pudding easily flipped out of the bundt pan and onto a plate for serving.
