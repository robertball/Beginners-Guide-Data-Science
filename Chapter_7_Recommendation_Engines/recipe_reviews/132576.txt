I have two kids that keep me on my toes all day, so having the time to roll a meatloaf is laughable. I decided to make according to recipe, only making a layer in the middle with the provolone and  prosciutto and mixing the spinach in with the meatloaf mixture. My broiler pan is quite shallow so I was only able to use a cup each of the wine/water. This was very good. I liked the subtlety of the wine and the flavors of the meatloaf with the prosciutto, provolone and spinach. I think it could use some garlic, onion and perhaps some spices....rosemary, maybe? I'd like to make this again with little additions to see if it would make it really out of sight. I could see how this would make a great meatball, tossed with a parmesan-garlic whole wheat pasta. I didn't want to make changes if I hadn't tried it as is first. I DID use fresh low carb bread to make my bread crumbs. My husband was adamant that I make "tots" with this, as he's a boy. If he had not suggested that, I would have served a light pasta/rice/potato dish. I had mine with garlic broccoli and that was sufficient enough for me, the low-carber. NOTE: I found the prosciutto and provolone at a cheaper price at my local Grocery Outlet. You CAN find them at a cheaper price, I've done it!

This meatloaf was definitely different! I plan to keep this recipe, but change some things to it. My meatloaf came out a little on the dry side. I think next time I'll use fresh bread crumbs instead of the dry bread crumbs that I used. I would add a little more spinach to the recipe, too.

This is the most spectacular meatloaf you will ever eat!  And it's so much fun to make.  I made this for my boyfriend of a month for the first time and he asks for this all the time.  It has a great mix of flavors and is very easy.  I do use four slices of cheese on each loaf and that adds to the overall amazingness, but even if you follow the recipe to the letter, it still is well worth your while to try it!  Additional comment 10/09: My husband (boyfriend mentioned above) still asks for this all the time - and raves about it to other people making them want to try it, too.  I think that, of everything I cook, this is his most requested meal.  Nowadays, I saute the spinach instead of wilting it.  I saute that spinach with leeks and it is wonderful!  I also double the cheese (SUPER healthy!) so that each bite is oozing with the cheese.

Excellent meatloaf. I did not have prosciutto so I used speck (a type of prosciutto). The top was also nice and crisp. Served with delicious mashed potatoes. Made excellent sandwiches.

I use layers of provolone cheese, spinach and roasted red peppers from a jar. The peppers help keep the meat from drying out.  Layer the cheese first, then the spinach then the peppers.

This was pretty good.  I had to add more seasonings, and it was a bit tricky to roll, but once I figured it out it was smooth sailing.  I like how pretty it looks, and this doesn't make too much, so it's a good dish for a couple of people.  Thanks for the recipe1

Love this loaf! I wanted to make a special dinner for my boyfriend and this was perfect. Easy, full of flavor, and it looks very impressive. Served with wild rice, a nice salad, and Malbec to drink.

Great meatloaf.
Makes for a "gourmet" dinner.
I did add a bit of thyme and rosemary to the mix.
Also, I was a bit short of red wine, so I added about three cups of sliced mushrooms to the liquid, and then a bit more water than suggested later on.
While letting the meatloaf sit, I thickened the resulting juices with a bit buter/flour mixture and the result was a delicious gravy.
We enjoyed it both fresh and as a leftover!

Would have given five stars if all the juices didn't dry out and burn up at the bottom of the broiler pan. Next time I'll keep a better eye on it and add water twice while cooking. This recipe is a keeper. Only made minor additions to enhance the flavor: For the pork part, I used hot pork sausage and flavored the meat with my Puerto Rican sofrito, sazon and extra garlic.  I didn't have provolone on hand so I used sliced white American cheese (don't cringe, it was yummy) I didn't find the need for flouring the plastic wrap it worked just fine without. I sauteed the spinach with onion slices and garlic. My ridiculously picky 5 year old thought it was great so that's a win in my book! Served with rice pilaf and steamed veggies. Will definitely be making this again and again! :-)

I am on the fence with this recipe.  I do not know why any oil was added to the outside of the meatloaf.  It made my meatloaf dry and hard on the outside.  I did add some minced garlic and onion flakes and basil for flavor, but I think something was missing.  Made meatballs with the remainder instead of another loaf.  Probably will not make again.

This is my recipe so I give it five stars, but try using the second half of the meatloaf to make meatballs instead of the second load and stick them in the freezer for an easy weeknight meal of spaghetti and meatballs on another night!

Like the concept but not the ingredients. Bland. If I make again, I'll use pork sausage, plain ham, and seasonings......

To me, this was very "thick" and salty tasting.  The ham layered into it, plus the sausage made it soo salty, it was hard to eat.  I would have added rice to it next time so the texture wasnt like a board.  The presentation was amazing, but its not about that.

Although this meatloaf looked nice, i think seasoning and onions should have been mixed into the meat for more flavor. I followed the recipe to a T (which i think everyone should do 1st time around for accurate rating) and found that the wine/water did nothing for my meat. Overall it was good but needs a lil work to be a 5star recipe.

This recipe was awesome, my family all agreed that this was the best meatloaf I had ever made! It took a little longer than the usual meatloaf, but so worth it. I made some minor changes to the original recipe. I added a chopped onion to the meat mixture, used italian style bread crumbs, added some chopped garlic & put some of the grated parmesan on the top before putting it in the oven. I didn't have the prosciutto, so I left it out, but it was great without it.

This was a big hit! I kept the ingrediants the same, but, changed the process a bit. I let the breadcrumbs soak in the red wine, then added the rest of the loaf ingrediants to the soaked breadcrumbs. I then oiled a baking dish with olive oil, plopped one loaf into the pan (froze the other) and baked at 350 covered with tin foil for 30 min and another 30 min without the foil. I would like to try this with ground veal instead of pork next time. In my meatloaf, I usually add fennel seed. But, since this recipe didn't call for it, I decided to try fresh fennel bulb (which I had never done before). I tossed the sliced bulb in some olive oil and lime juice and baked under the broiler for about 5 min. then topped with grated parmesan and broiled a few minuted longer. It was the perfect, healthful companion to this meatloaf! Thanks SO much!

Interesting. I followed the recipe exactly. I did not like it at all. However, my husband loved it! He said it was the best meatloaf I have ever made. I just finished baking it and he can't stop eating it and talking about how good it is. To each his own I guess.

Totally missed the part about it making 2 loafs.  So I ended up with one HUGE meatloaf, where one slice equaled two servings.  We've been eating this out of the freezer for the last 4 months.  The texture was too soft for us.  Next time I'll use 75% beef and 25% pork.  The taste was ok but nothing special.  I have a love/hate relationship with red wine so that may be it.  I also use onions, celery and bell peppers in my meatloaf with a splash of Open Pit BBQ sauce.  I like the idea of a stuffed meatloaf but I need to tweak this recipe to my family's liking.  I'll try it again for the next family gathering.

I thought this recipe was fabulous!!!  I used pork sausage instead of ground pork and ham instead of prosciutto.  Although, I would've used more cheese OR tried to seal the ends a little better because the cheese oozed out the sides.  The flavor was delicious, but I do think I would add minced garlic next time.  Also pictured, Baked Mushroom Rice, from allrecipes.com.

My husband and I don't usually like meatloaf. I saw this recipe and thought it might be worth a try. I wasn't disappointed. My husband and I loved it and my children liked it as well. This recipe was a winner in our house. I also like that it makes a second loaf that you can have ready to go for another time.

2/2/2009 - Very different and delicious meatloaf!  I have never cared for the traditional, dried-out ground beef and bread crumbs recipes and this one is wonderful!  The slices of meatloaf had a beautiful spiral when served and this was very easy to make!  I took the 2nd loaf to our neighbors and they enjoyed it as well!  A definite keeper!
3/11/2017 - assembled one loaf for our dinner and used the other half for meatballs in the freezer.  Used Italian panko crumbs in place of plain bread crumbs.  I also just baked it in a loaf pan, rather than on a broiler pan - poured out the drippings, added red wine for the sauce.

Great stuff!  We freeze half of it every time just to keep it around.  We substitute italian sausage for the pork and it makes it even better.  We've also chopped it up and mixed with red sauce for pasta w/ meat.

Pretty good and I'll make it again, although next time I think I'd add more spinach and may put sauted shallots in the middle (or in the sauce).  The sauce was a bit wierd as it was just a lot of wine and pan drippings - I may also add some beef broth and flour to it to thicken it up and also give it more flavor than just wine.

My husband made this recipe over the weekend, and it was outstanding.  We followed the recipe exactly - almost!  We couldn't find any provolone, so we used part-skim mozzerella instead.  Can't wait to make this again - delicious!

this is my families new favorite meal. I buy once a month, cook for two days, vacumn seal, and I dont have to worry about cooking all month. this is a wonderful item to freeze. we changed it up a bit. we like ground chicken, but hard to get a good meatloaf out of it. I use half beef/ half chicken. we stuff ours with spinach, pepperoni, salami, and provolone. I stick it in the crockpot with a tad bit of ketchup sprinkled with brown sugar and it turns out great everytime! they love it so much I must make it two times a month

Very tasty. I put it together the day before and after cooking the next day was able to transport it to another location., Heldup fine. I will add more spinach and cheese next time.

Loved it! Made it twice. I was so proud of it that I was taking samples to friends and family. Not one person had anything negative to say, they all loved it.  I read some of the reviews on the recipe and made a few changes.   I added almost a can of tomato sauce, I used minced garlic. I used Jimmy Deans regular sausage. I substituted ground deer meat for ground beef. I put a little wine in the mix. added more spinach and I laid down a row of hard salami with the cheese on the leading edge when I rolled it up. it was a little harder to roll but it was well worth it. Almost forgot to mention I added almost a cup of shredded italian
cheese to the mix. This is a fantastic recipe that I promise I will use again and again

It took a bit of time to put it together but it was worth it.  Both people I offered it to really liked it.  If I did it again, I would add more provolone and and proscuitto.  Also, I found that if I cooked down the remaining wine/water mixture from the pan, it made a good sauce.

Amazing! But I did change it a bit. I wrapped it up in applewood bacon then through it in the oven. I left out the ham inside. Also I added garlic, adobo and a cup of milk. Simply out of sight!

followed as written for my hubby and parents and we all really enjoyed this. Added some cornstarch to liquid to thicken it up and served with mashed potatoes and salad.
