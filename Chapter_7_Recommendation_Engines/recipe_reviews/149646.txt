I made an apple pie the other day for a dinner with friends.  I didn't want to have all that 'crust', so I found this recipe and I tried it.  It was a great topping for the pie.  I am going to experiment using different fillings, ie.....cherry, peach, rhubarb, mixed berries, etc....it is going to be great!

next time I'll make this I'll cut out the nuts, they seemed a little too strong for the pie. I'll also add cinnamon and nutmeg.

I used a small Granny Smith apple in this recipe (I didn't have a dried apple)
and added a little pumpkin pie spice. I baked it in the oven for about 20-25 minutes and I plan on letting it cool and use it for a topping on the Dreamy Apple Butter Pumpkin Pie. I'm crossing my fingers it's a good combination.

As I was baking an Apple Pie last night the store bought pie crust wasnt rolling out well and started to crack.  After microwaving the top piece it was too warm and tore, so I put both crusts together and used this as a topping.  DElicious!!  I will start doing this from now on as I love a thick crust and this was such a good topping.  I didnt use the apples and only had a bit of walnuts but I will be using Pecans from now on!  I also threw in a bit of Brown Sugar as well!!

Excellent! Added some pecans because I love them. Couldn't have been better. Many compliments on pie.
