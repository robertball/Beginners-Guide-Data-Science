Very nice old fashion type recipe. I added a crumb topping to the top. I used fresh picked blueberries and ate it warm with whipped topping. Fairly moist cake which has lasted into the next day nicely. Def. recommend the 8x8 pan as in the directions.

I needed some breakfast cakes and used this recipe to accomplish that task.  They were good tasting and made up quickly.  I added cream cheese instead of the shortening and put a crumble on the top.  I will use this again for a coffee cake next time.  We shall see!  :)

Very good cake that my family enjoyed.  I love lemon so added the  zest of the whole lemon.  I also made a glaze using the juice of half a lemon mixed with 3 1/2 T. sugar and brushed that over the cooled cake.  Delicious!

Very good cake. Dense (which I love) and moist. I made two changes. I used butter in place of the shortening and I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract because I am used to adding this to cake recipes and felt it would be a good addition to this recipe. And one last thing, I bake my cake in an 8X8 pan and it was done in 30 minutes. That is much shorter than the 50 called for in the recipe. So be aware that your bake could be much shorter too.  This is a delicious recipe as is, but I think even better with the few changes I mentioned. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband isn't a huge blueberry fan and loved this cake. I made it as written but added about a tsp. of vanilla out of habit. I also made this gluten free with gluten free AP flour and xantham gum.

This was great! it was easy to make also. I cut back slightly on the sugar but I think I would not the next time, the cake I made could have been sweeter. It was still great,( stick to the recipe) Its a good one  gigi

This cake is a bit dense.  Very old fashioned cake.  I didnt have lemon zest so i used some butter extract.  I think the zest would of made a heck of a difference in the flavor. I made it in a loaf pan.  The cake is not too sweet at all.  Great with coffee.  I didnt take a bite and say:  OMG this is awesome.  Just... hhmm it's ok.

This is delicious....I did not have shortening in the house , so I used butter, too....also did not have fresh lemon, but used  ground lemon peel with lemon oil....I'm sure to try this again...
Rich, moist and quite chocked full of flavor.

Made this for a party and it turned out great.  Traveled well and enjoyed by all.  I used butter instead of shortening. No other substitutions.  Would totally make this again.

GREAT recipe!! I had a feeling this cake wouldn't last a minute with my family in an 8x8 dish, so I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 dish. Turned out AMAZING! The cake was so fluffy and light, and I loved the tartness of the blueberry/lemon zest mixture. The batter oddly resembles that of pancakes.

I loved this cake!  Quick and easy to make! I used an 8 oz block of cram cheese instead of the shortening, and I added MORE blueberries (lightly coated with cornstarch). I took a reviewers advice and added more lemon zest to batter and did the sugar/lemon juice/lemon zest for glaze, delish! I highly recommend this cake!  I made mine in a 9" springform pan lined bottom wit parchment, easy to remove from pan. Make this cake!!  You will love it!

I made this for a family BBQ.  Everyone thought it was great.  I used powdered sugar instead of a frosting. When I was cutting and plating the cake, I thought it was dry, but the consumers (I am GF, couldn't try it) said it had a nice crust and was really moist inside. I have been asked to make it again.  Easy and quick to put together.

The cake itself was delicious. I added a lemon icing just for fun. The only downside is that the blueberries I put in it gave me food poisoning. I was in the middle of throwing it away when a caught a whiff of the smell and I almost puked, so I probably won't be making it again. It's a real shame, I thought it was super yummy. Make sure you get quality blueberries!!!

A little sticky/gooey/moist for my taste, but flavour is good, and not too sweet. I added more lemon zest and i like the flavour it brings. This is good to have with coffee or tea

One thing that drives me nuts is when someone posts a review but has changed the recipe....Yet here I am doing it! LOL LOL. I wanted to bake something to bring to work (same day) so I decided on this cake.
I doubled the recipe, used buttermilk, real butter and frozen blueberries.  It was a bit thick but I put it in a 1/4 sheet pan, baked for about 55 minutes. It came out golden brown. I looked at it an d imeadiatly thought it needed something on top but I did not have the time to whip up a frosting and anyway the darn thing was to hot...My clock was ticking and I had to get my butt to work... A 45 minute commute.
It smelled HEAVENLY all the way to work. I plopped it on the breakroom table and still thought "it just needs something on it"
Every single person LOVED it and said NO!!! Just as it is. Moist, yummy, just sweet enough and dont add a topping, not even powdered sugar.

Loved it - substitutes saskatoon berries! I made it traditionally so creamed the butter and sugar and added the egg (and 1 tsp lemon juice as no zest and 1tsp vanilla). Then added the flour and milk alternately. I love sweet things so when out of the oven mixed lemon juice and sugar to make a glaze and poured over. For hubby without a sweet tooth, left plain and was delish with cream.

Added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the batter, which I think did add to the flavor; otherwise, made as per ingredients list.  This is a good snacking cake to have around the house, but it's not something I would specifically make for guests.

I added butter instead of shortening and didn't add lemon zest. I however added some crushed walnuts. And it was such a delight.

Very delicious cake I love the lemony flavor with the blueberries.  I also substituted the margarine with butter and added half a teaspoon of vanilla and results were delicious.

For Mom's 85th birthday, I needed a low sodium dessert that wasn't too sweet. I used no sodium baking powder to bring sodium to 754 mg in whole cake, and served it with sugar free Cool Whip. She loved it!

This is delicious and everyone who tried this loved it as well.  I added a blueberry compote for a topping and served it with homemade whipped cream.  Yum!

This is my first time baking a cake. It was so easy & delicious. I topped it with cream cheese icing.
