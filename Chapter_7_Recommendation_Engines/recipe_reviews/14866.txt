I wanted a recipe for a cracker I could make in an old set of ice-box-cookie-molds. This is perfect! I made a batch according to the recipe and another one with a milder cheese and different seasoning. Both were great. One batch needed a little water to form a dough. (Perhaps it depends on the moisture content of the cheese.) Both batches sliced cleanly with no crumbling and held their shapes fine. Nice non-sweet treat!

We entertain alot and these are quick and easy to make.  When we're expecting lots of people I have a jar on our bar filled with these.  Once baked, they also freeze well.  Just pop them in the oven for a few minutes to crisp them up.

I made this for our wine tasting group and it was a hit!  The only changes I made to the recipe were to increase the amount of red pepper flakes to aprox. 2 teaspoons  and to microwave the butter so it was halfway melted.  I had better luck with the dough this way.  Excellent recipe!

Add water to mixture to make a dough.  Slice no less than 1/8 - 1/4 inches.  Bake on non-stick sheet sprayed with baking spray or they may stick.

QUote good.  I made two batches - one with Walnuts, the other with Chilli (so at least some were child friendly).    Rather than adding all the cheese, I kept 1/2 back then put 1/3rd on rolled out pastry, folded in 3, turned & rolled again, then repeated twice more.  This gave a nice - almost puff pastry - wafer, rather similar to a Dutch brand of Cheese Crispies - also used 50% cheddar, 50% gouda cheese.

I tried this recipe - good but needs a little additons.  I marinted my cheese in Worchester sauce (about 4 dashes).  Also I put more hot sauce than recipe calls for.  I put paprika on the top of each wafer before I cooked them.  I also put a pecan half on the top. After experimenting they were good. To each ones taste how spicy and hot you like them.  But the basic recipe is good.

I'm in the middle of this recipe and there is no dough to form. Too dry. I'm working on it.

These were okay, but not great.  I might have done something wrong with the recipe.  I plan to try it again to see if I get better results.

I'll give this a 4 for taste but a 3 for ease....I made it exactly per directions and found the dough difficult to work with.  It didn't hold a shape and to cut into "thin wafers" was impossible.  But-tasted like a yummy version of a cheez-it.  I'd add more cayenne, hot sauce next time though.

They were more like a fluffy cookie/cracker. Not crunchy at all. Not sure what I did wrong.

These were good but very greasy....I used Longhorn colby and sunflower seeds. I may try them again using Cheddar but I think I'll stick to more healthy snacks. My crowd didn't eat them.

These are pretty tasty.  I used a steakhouse spices blend for the red pepper flakes and also added a spicy mustard instead of hot sauce. (just a personal preference)  I did have to add water to make it stick together..but they turned out very good!

Added more pepper than called for. Also added a little water at a time until consistency needed. I followed the advice of another poster, sprayed baking pan with Pam. They came off easy, of course the ones I sliced thinner were better!

These were pretty good.  I put all of the ingredients in my food processor - it worked great to make a dough - very easy.  I think this would have been very difficult by hand.

Excellent ...made just as written.  Use really really soft butter and it will come together better!  I used my hands to mix!

I have been making these for a few years and they are really good !  I do not use pecans or any seasonings and they taste great that way.  It is more time consuming, but I use a small shot glass as a cookie cutter to form the crackers. It makes twice as much and they are crispy !

Read the other reviews and used 2 tsp steak seasoning in place of the salt, and used 12 oz extra sharp cheddar cheese, and melted the butter. Baked for 25 minutes until bottom of crackers were very brown. They came out delicious!

I have made these Cheese Wafers for about 4 years and all my friends and neighbors love them. The only addition I make is that I add a little dry mustard. Very addictive.

The taste is really good but the method needs amending.  The butter should be thoroughly creamed first.  Stir in cheese, hot sauce and pepper flakes, THEN add the flour , etc., to make any kind of workable dough.  I would also suggest finely chopping the nuts and that the wafers not be sliced any thinner than 1/4", otherwise they shatter during removal from baking pan.

Seriously delicious and the reason I gained 2 pounds today :) Made this in food processor... added 1/4 c water ( 1T at a time) until dough came together. Baked 20 minutes.. yum. Major YUM!
