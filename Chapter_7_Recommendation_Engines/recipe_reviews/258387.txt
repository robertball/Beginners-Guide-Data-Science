I didn’t soak the beans, so it took an hour and twenty minutes. But I think this is much better than the two hours of soaking plus cook time. I also used all fresh vegetables. The seasoning was perfect, and we will definitely make it again. It was my first time cooking beans in the pressure cooker, and it took a little trial and error, but now that I know I don’t ever have to soak beans again I will make them more often! Thanks!

WE LOVED THIS RECIPE!  the seasonings were spot on and I saved A TON OF TIME getting this done and on the table.
THE BEST PART?  I'm not gonna lie, I DIDN'T SOAK MY BEANS, NOR WILL I EVER FROM NOW ON!

I was strapped for time so I did what another reviewer did and added the beans (rinsed and looked over) and just increased my time x2.  So simple and BETTER than the way I have been cooking them for decades!

I really can't  tell you just what a time saver my instant pot is.  I am an old school cook and MY ZEN is cooking.  Now that I have discovered this Instant Pot way of cooking, maybe my ZEN will now include a PEDICURE!  ;-)

WOW  OH  WOW!!!!  I was a little nervous about making it in an Instant Pot because I'm a little bit of a purist when it comes to a pot of beans.  But I was wrong to be hesitant. I did add a couple of things because I like my beans extra spicy.  1.5 tsp Red pepper flakes, 14 oz  kielbasa sausage, dash cayenne pepper,  1/ 2 tsp black pepper,  and because Rice and Beans needs some sort of tomato --- 1   15oz  can tomato sauce. I served over basmati rice and it was heaven.  ***** If you like your beans to be on the soft side, add a few extra minutes to the time*****

I made this for dinner on one of our cross country nights and it returned mixed reviews from my family ranging from 3-4. The biggest complaint was the sausage became "squishy" They liked the actual flavor and the beans. The squishy meat may be user error. I did not soak my beans and used another reviewers suggestion and pressure cooked for 1.5hours. My beans were perfectly cooked. I also doubled the meat because my family loves smoked sausage. I used red bell pepper because that is what I had on hand, a stalk of celery and half a vidalia onion (couldn't find the mix at the store)  and vegetable broth.

I love to cook and experiment with a lot of different methods but beans have always been my nemesis.  I mean I cannot cook beans that I fall in love with or that are really edible.  I love other peoples beans but mine never come out right.  I also have a bit of a pet peeve for reviewers who change everything about a recipe and then rate the one they didn't make.  I did listen to a couple of the reviews though as I like softer beans. I cooked for 45 minutes instead of 30.  I used fresh veggies as that's what I had on hand and I did add 1 tbsp of chili pepper.  I also had one small ham hock in the freezer which I threw in.  Now I'm sounding like the reviewers I mentioned above.  Sorry about that.  I don't think I changed anything enough to change the outcome though.  These beans were absolutely AMAZING!!!  I think the author really nailed it.  These were hands down the best beans I have made in my life. The flavor was spot on.  I can't say enough about it.  We will definitely be using this recipe over and over again.  Thank you to the author for taking the time to post this recipe.

The only change I made was to double the sausage.  This Red Beans and rice recipe is great.  I have eaten it every day this week for lunch and am still not tired of it.

I just got my instant pot so still trying to figure out how to use it! This was my third try at a recipe and it turned out delicious! Will definitely make it again. I used fresh veges instead of frozen  as we don’t like celery. The beans could’ve been a little softer but I’m still figuring this out so that’s probably operator error. It makes quite a bit and has a lot of flavor. Keeper!

The beans came out more soupy, it took 30 minutes to release naturally. And it’s very bland. Really needs salt or some spice, I’d double the Cajun seasoning if I made this again.

A first for me making AND eating red beans and rice! I followed some reviewers and made a few changes.  I used smoked andouille sausage,  fresh veggies (it's what I had); 1tbsp Tony Chachere's; 15oz. can of tomato sauce; pressure cooked for 45 minutes.  They still turned out a little soupy,  but the next day the consistency had thickened up.  I have a request to make them again things weekend.  A keeper!

This a great base recipe for fabulous red beans and rice with the ease of the Instapot.   I combined this recipe with other from this site that uses a traditional stovetop long cook approach (Authentic New Orleans Red Beans and Rice).  The combination was fantastic!   Changes I made to this recipe included some suggested by others:  bacon grease instead of olive oil,  added 7.5 oz tomato sauce ( and some extra salt and black pepper because of it ), 1/2 tsp each sage and thyme, 1 TBsp Cajun seasoning ( Tony Cachere’s), 1 lb Polska Kielbasa sausage cut up, a dash of cayenne and 2 smoked ham hocks. I used fresh onion, celery and bell pepper, not frozen, but that probably doesn’t change anything.  Remove bay leaves and ham hocks after cooking but be sure to take the little bit of meat off the ham hocks and add back in, really makes a difference!  I had to add 15 minutes to the cook time.  So worth it.  Give this one a try!

I made this for the first time tonight.   I used fresh beg since didn't find frozen.  It's good and I know will taste better tomorrow. Only change:  I cooked the sausage separate and drained to reduce fat and maintain texture.

This is so delicious!  I did make a few changes based on minor preferences and what I had on hand.  I soaked my beans overnight.  I increased the Cajun seasoning to 1 Tbs. I doubled the meat using Kielbasa.   I used fresh veggies including half a celery finely minced, one large onion finely minced, and three large bells chopped.  I also used two cans of chicken broth, 29 oz. total instead of the carton.  I pressure cooked the entire meal minus rice for thirty minutes and let it naturally release the pressure for one hour.  Will definitely make again!

First I made it with Turkey Sausage. I am trying to cut fat. It was Delicious! Next time though, I am going to cut the recipe in half as there are only two of us and this pot made a large amount. I used the half of the red beans we did not eat, and mashed them and made Refried Beans! They were great that way also!

I set the timer on fire 45 minutes and ended up cooking another 10 minutes. But I started with dry beans. I also added sauteed carrots along with celery. My family who never likes the same things all had 3 bowls worth each.

Very good flavor, but my beans were VERY al dente (we could just say not done yet) after 30 minutes and natural release of the instant pot.  There was also a substantial about of liquid left, maybe I made an error but, I had to pressure cook for 15 more minutes and natural release again for perfectly done beans.  Otherwise, great!

So do you mean instead of the 30 min cook time in the recipe you changed it to 1 hour 20 min because you didn’t soak the beans? And it turned out good? I am making this today :)
