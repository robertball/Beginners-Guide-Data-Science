I hate to give this a 4 star, but it just didnt work well for me. I used a stainless steel skillet on my flattop stove which I think greatly contributed to my mistake. I would NOT do this on high on a flattop stove. I think I will try the oven next time. I used 1/4 cup butter and added 1 cup rice krispies. I sauteed the oatmeal/brown sugar/cinnamon mix for 4 mintues on high but it was starting to burn already. I removed it from the heat to add the butter and it continued to burn, even after I added the butter and caramel sauce. It looks burnt,and tasted burnt, but I will continue to use it in my granola bar recipe because I dont want to waste it. I think its a good idea for making granola, but I will put it in the oven next time on wax paper. Let you know how it works out.

I halved it, but changed it a little bit.  I used 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of canola oil to lighten it up.  It seems like the recipe calls for too much butter.  Also, I added 1/2 teaspoonful of vanilla extract to the butter/caramel mixture.  And right after  the oats and butter are mixed but before it cools, I added a handful of caramels cut in halves.  It got all melty with the granola but still held some form- worked very well.  I think this recipe was good, but needed something else to add crunch, either nuts or Rice Krispies.

Very yummy snack. It was all gone from us munching on it before I could use it on yogurt or ice cream! The only things I did differently were to add about 1/4 cup each of walnuts and pecans, and I used half of the recommended butter. de-lish!

I finally found an easy granola recipe!!  I have found this recipe to be forgiving as I add a little chopped nuts and dried fruit to it which caramelizes nicely in the pan from the brown sugar!  I save so much money now that I dont buy my Granola from the cereal isle!

The flavor was good. But I let it cool for a few hours, and it was still mushy. I followed the recipe exactly, and then added 1/2 c. raisins to the mixture. It was too mushy so I put it in a 450 degree oven to toast a bit. Good flavor though!

Nice, easy recipe but with modifications. I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and no caramel sauce and found the sweetness to be just right. I didn't add the extra 2 tablespoons of white sugar and used only 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. Also, after cooking the oats, sugar and cinnamon on high for only two minutes (stirring constantly the whole time), it already started to burn. I have no idea how you would cook this for 5-10 minutes at a high temperature.

Tried this because it looked super easy.  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, I also used less butter and caramel sauce then suggested.  I did not put any white sugar on at the end.  It didn't seem necessary to me.  1 made 2 half batches.  The first one I cooked for about 8-9 minutes.  This is too long unless you like nearly burnt granola.  The second batch I did for 5 minutes, this batch is much better in color and flavor.  Overall a good recipe.  Thanks.
