Don't let the name fool you!  These are NOT salty.  They are a very light crepe, perfect for both savory or sweet filling, these are very good.  I made a blueberry peach filling, next time I will do a savory filling.  Either way, this is a keeper.

I'm on vacation and I don't have baking soda/powder and my granddaughter wanted pancakes.  These were easy to make and even easier to eat. Like eating small crepes.

Great crepe recipe.  I added some fresh raspberries, whipped cream, and a touch of real maple syrup.

Excellent crepes! I followed the recipe and cooked it on my induction cooktop with a cast iron skillet, 310-320 degrees Fahrenheit seemed to be the best temp. Wrapped up some banana and drizzled with butter pecan syrup, YUM! P.S. for easier flipping, I cooked the first side, slid onto a plate, then flip back into pan to cook other side.
