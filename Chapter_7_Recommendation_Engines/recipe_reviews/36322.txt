Excellent!  I used boneless chicken breasts, marinated in the sauce for a few hours, then grilled...we loved it!  I will try the sauce on ribs next time...

Good not great.  The Old Bay added a nice touch but not enough to make me want to make this again.  I've have better luck with some of the higher quality bottled bbq sauces.

Excellent. Easy alternative to bottled sauce. Made it two times for three adults and had NONE leftover, so I would double this if you like extra sauce for dipping and really want the six servings it says it makes.

We made this several times during the summer and my husband just can't get enough of it.  I'm not a real Old Bay fan but this is recipe is wonderful.  It's a keeper for our family!

Can you believe I had never heard of Old Bay Seasoning before visiting this site? It is fantastic, and makes a wonderful contribution to this sauce. My kids really enjoyed the chicken, as did my husband and myself. Next time I would like to try marinating the chicken in the sauce to intensify the flavors.

We really liked the Old Bay sauce for our chicken.  It's the first time I've ever cooked with this seasoning.  I was able to grill 15 large chicken breasts with one recipe.  We will bbq our chicken like this again.  I'll bet it would be good on hamburgers too!

Okay, so I did the sauce like the recipe, but I marinated the chicken overnight. Since I was doing a big BBQ with limited grill space, I also baked the chicken for 30 min. at 375F in a single layer with the marinade before throwing it on the grill. It was perfect, everyone gobbled it up. I reduced the sauce in the pan and poured over the meat when I served it. Use a gravy boat to pour over so it's not too greasy :-)

While cooking the sauce it reminded me of the flavor of cocktail sauce and I was a little leerie.  Once we got it on the chicken it was a different story, and everyone loved it.  I snuck down for leftovers in the middle of the night!  We will definately make this one again....

Wonderful summer grilling recipe!  The bar-b-que sauce is excellent, would not change a thing, nice and thick and tangy.  The addition of horseradish & Old Bay really makes this unique.  I'm making this sauce for Fathers Day and putting on Bar-b-que shrimp skewers, it would also be delicious cold for shrimp cocktail.

Fabulous!  There's a lot of flavor here.  I didn't change a thing.  I just might double the sauce the next time around because I didn't have any left over for dipping with the amount of chicken it calls for.

We loved it and I think you must heat this sauce as suggested.  When I tasted it before heating it did taste like shrimp cocktail sauce but the flavers blended as it heated.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Nice sauce but next time I will add a little less horseradish, I found it tasted a little too much like cocktail sauce.  Also I think a little minced onion dried or fresh would be good as well.  Still a nice BBQ sauce.

Easy and good! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and followed the directions for preparation.  Served with Smashed Cauliflower and corn on the cob.

Excellent.  My family is not used to the Old Bay seasoning, so I changed things up a little bit.  I made the sauce, reserved 1/2 cup, and marinaded boneless, skinless chicken breasts all day.  Then I grilled and basted with the reserved sauce.  I will be making this again.  Thank you!

loved the taste...from Baltimore so I love old bay in anything.  I decided to double the sauce recipe and bake the chicken for 45 minutes.  For my daughter I did not sprinkle the old bay on the chicken, but it was in the sauce.  The whole family LOVED it!

Really interesting way to prepare BBQ chicken, I did marinate the chicken for about an hour before grilling.  The family really enjoyed this.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Following the instructions of the recipe, I GENEROUSLY seasoned the chicken with Old Bay and found it MUCH too salty. Reading the ingredients, celery salt/salt are listed first.  So I would omit the step of seasoning the chicken with it and just use what is in the bbq sauce, which was really good; loved the horseradish heat that was in it!

Very tasty! I used about 2 lbs of boneless skinless breasts for this. Made the sauce as written. Would do again for sure. Thanks!
