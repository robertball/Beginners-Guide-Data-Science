Awesome!  The only change I made was mix the cream cheese/sour cream and taco seasoning, spread in pan and refrigerate for 1/2 hour to settle.  Then topped the cheese mixture with the beef mixture.  I substituted 1lb of beef for a can of spicy refried beans.  Then topped the beef with the cheese, which melted over the hot beef/refried mixture.  Then topped with lettuce, scallions and olives.  The best ever!

I have made this dip many times for parties and catered events.  Recently, I doubled the recipe for a "ladies" function and everyone said that it was way too much (the "we eat like birds" syndrome).  I came back an hour later and the dip was GONE!  Those ladies ate like vultures!!  Everyone loved it.  Like others, I add a layer of refried beans as the bottom layer.  I can play around with the level of "heat" by mixing hot or medium taco sauce or by adding green chiles.  I also use the chopped lettuce as a border so that dipping is easier.  Great dip!

Awesome dip!  Recipe says medium bowl, you will need a 13x9 baking dish, I used one a bit smaller because it said medium and I ran out of room. It tastes great!!

The third time I made this I halfed the ground beef to 1 lb, it's good either way, but with 1 lb, you definitely taste the cream cheese/sour cream mixture more.  Better at room temperature.  Next time I might prepare the cream cheese mixture ahead and spread it into the dish, cover with foil and store in fridge overnight before putting everything else on it because the mixture is much more flavorful the next day.

This is sooooooo good, however I changed a couple of the ingredients.
First I used 1lb of gr. turkey because the I thought the gr. beef flavor might be to much. I mixed the cooked gr. turkey with a can of refried beans and the taco sauce. This I added to the bottom of the bowl. Instead of regular cream cheese I used whipped cream cheese because it is easier to mix with the sour cream. The cream cheese/sour cream/taco seasoning mixture I added on top of the meat and bean mixture. Next I added a bunch of shredded chedder cheese, I got rid of the lettuce ( I was afraid it might wilt) added the chopped tomatoes, onions and olives. Make sure you add a big spoon to the bowl at your buffet or party because this dip is thick and your chips will break if you just try to scoop it out of the bowl.  This dip made this way is super yummy, every one who has tasted it just loves it. You won't regret making this dip. ;o) Elise  
P.S Serve this dip cold. After you make it, put it in the fridge and take it out when company comes or you leave to go to where ever you will be taking the dip.

I have made and eaten a lot of seven layer dips.  This one is by far the best I have tasted so far.  The cream cheese mixture on the bottom gives a lot more flavor than sour cream along.  The meat doesn't get clumpy like it does when you use taco seasoning on it, but it still has a lot of flavor.  I have found a new Mexican dip recipe.

Fantastic? I don't think so! 2 lbs of ground beef is ALOT (esspecially to later waste). Is this suppossed to be served while the meat is still warm right after the dish is put together or when the dish is cold? I choose cold (like other 7-layer taco dips I've made before) and it was terrible. Afterall, do YOU like eating cold hamburger? How about 2 lbs of it? It almost made me choke! You can hardly taste anything else! I then tried to heat it up a few min in the microwave and then the lettuce and cream cheese gets wilted and all melty (I know that's not a word...). Even my boyfriend, who eats almost anything...stuck his nose up at this. Nothing personal Bumblebee, but I will never make this again.

This recipe was very good for this kind of dip.  I've used many.  I did several things different. I only used 1 lb of ground beef.  I used salsa instead of taco sauce.  I added a layer of guacomole over the sour cream/cream cheese layer. I left out the lettuce. I
used olives sparingly as I find many people don't like them in this kind of dip. Another thing, this recipe makes a huge quantity. I used a pie plate. If you use as directed with the 2 lbs of meat, you will definitely need a bigger boat, as in a 13 x 9 inch dish. Also, you need a spoon and small plates for serving.  You cannot "dip" chips into it.
Having said all that, it was very good and I will make again for parties.

This was a big hit with my guests.  It has a terrific presentation, but all raved about the flavor.  I took others advice and put a layer of bean dip in the bottom of the plate and then followed the recipe's layering instructions after that.  I also agree that making the "base" a day in advance to let the flavors blend makes a big difference!

Fantastic ;) I added refried beans to the bottom on half for the boys and canned, drained diced green chiles, (2) 7-oz. cans, on the whole thing for an extra little something.  Worked great!

This recipe is great. It has become my staple at all parties and there is never any leftovers. Four things I do a little differently, however; one, I only use half the beef, two, instead of taco sauce I'll mix the beef with a mild to medium salsa, three, don't include the olives, and four I use the hot & spicy taco seasoning. I also find if it is serve at room tempurature it is easier to scoop but bring out the spoons just in case. Love this dish!

I make this for almost every family gathering we have here at the house. My little secret? I use ground turkey! Noone knows, I swear. If you can sneak a little beef bouillion into your ground turkey as it cooks, totally fools just about everyone. I use homemade salsa in place of the taco sauce and homemade taco seasoning. This is also good with a layer of organic refried beans. I double the tomatoes at least. Last time I made this, gone in a matter of seconds. I had one person royally ticked the last time he came to my house and I hadn't made it! NOTE: You can use fat free or lowfat sour cream, cream cheese and cheddar cheese without much change to the taste, too.

I made the Fantastic Mexican Dip for the LSU vs. Oklahoma Sugar Bowl Game.  Geux Tigers!!!  I made it in a 9X13 pyrex lasagna pan.  Worked out well.  That solves the problem when other reviewers said that it was too much meat.  It spread it out further.  I also put some hot sauce along with the taco sauce in the meat mixture.  It needed a little spice.  Next time I will use the new bottled Taco Bell Restaurant Sauce (Hot) instead of the taco sauce.  I also used more green onions than it called for and an extra tomato.  It work out wonderful.  I will use this recipe again.  My husband said it is better than the 7 layer dip that I use to make.


Updated Review 4/16/17:  I made this again with the following changes.  I used Johnsonville (19 oz.) Chorizo cooked in a skillet until done and put half a bottle of Medium Taco Sauce and half a bottle Restaurant Style Taco Bell Hot Sauce to the meat mixture.  I mixed Schiracca sauce, taco sauce and the Restaurant Style Hot Sauce to 2 cans of Refried Beans.  In a 9 x 13 Pyrex baking dish, I layered according:

Refried Beans
Mexican Cheese
Chorizo Mixture
Mexican Cheese
Sour Cream and Cream Cheese Mixture
Mexican Cheese
Lettuce
1 can of Drained Rotel Tomatoes
Diced Green Onions

Tips:
***To get all the excess moisture out of the Rotel Tomatoes you can squeeze the tomatoes or mash them with a fork in a colander.

I hope I don't get scowled at for saying this but let's put it this way: I didn't achieve nirvana or anything by eating this. We had a mexican-themed dinner and served this as a side.  I sprinkled some taco-blend cheese overall.  I really liked the taste of the cream cheese/sour cream mix but I wasn't too keen on the meat part. It was still good but IF I make it with meat, I'll use only a 1/2 lb, otherwise I use none at all. Good stuff, but I wasn't "wowed."  Thanks just the same Bumblebee!

I made this with ground turkey and it was a HIT. My brother's gobbled it down on Christmas. I used light cream cheese, light sour cream, etc to cut down on fat. I like that it gives you more protein and less carbs than the traditional mexican dip. Delicious!

Fantastic, indeed! I received a similar recipe thirty years ago from a good friend. We've been making it ever since. The only difference between the two recipes is that mine calls for one can of beanless chili added into the sour cream, cream cheese, taco seasoning mixture. I believe the can of chili gives this dip an earthier taste and a hardier texture.Thanks for sharing Bumblebee.

This recipe is delicious, even though I changed it a bit to accommodate our tastes.  I prepared this for my husband to enjoy while he watched the Super Bowl.  In that we both have a problem with green onions, I sauteed some chopped yellow onion in the same skillet with the ground beef. Then,
as I wanted a warm dip, I layered it according to instructions, but I omitted the lettuce and olives
until after I had warmed it slowly, covered with foil, in a 175 degree oven.  I should have made
a double recipe, as it was a big hit!  I will definitely make this again...and again.

This is a very good recipe-well received at picnics/functions. I did double the olives and tomatoes and added a can of pinto beans to the neat mixture. A border of chopped lettuce makes a very nice presentation.

made this last night for a get together for work.  There was a lot of food, and this was well received.  I added a layer of refried beans to the bottom and then followed the recipe except I used 1 lb of ground beef and 8oz taco sauce.  I think two pounds would have been overwhelming. Very good!!

I mixed the cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning the night before and put in the fridge. Yum! The flavor was awesome the next day. 
I did a couple of things differently. I only had 3/4 of a pound of ground beef so I added a little bit of ground Italian sausage. I didn't use taco sauce. I had some avocados in the fridge so I mashed them up with some salt, pepper and lime juice and added a thick layer in my dip. My cheese was a Mexican 4 cheese blend. And I didn't have any green onions...The dip was delicious. My guests ate it all! :)

Very good---1/2'd the recipe and did add a layer of bean dip on the bottom. Didn't have taco sauce so made some from scratch which was pretty good. Left out the olives as we are not fans.  Did mix the cream ch, sour cr and taco seasoning several hours before assembling to let it blend--used low salt taco seasoning. The whole thing was Scrumptious!

Delicious! Top with whatever vegetables you like on a taco. I used lettuce, cheese, black olives and green olives. I made the sour cream/cream cheese/taco seasoning mixture the night before so the flavors had a chance to meld together. I also made sure to let the hamburger cool down a bit before spreading into pan. I will definately make this again!

This is good but I would at least double the olives, tomatoes and green onions.

Yummy!  Added a layer of refried beans on bottom and seasoned ground beef with a taco seasoning packet (as well as the sour cream mixture as directed).  Have made twice and everyone loves!  Thanks so much!

Used this recipe along with several others for a card party with a mexican theme. This recipe was the hit of the night.  I didn't change anything. Will definitely use it again.

This was amazing! Everyone loved it. It was so tastey and flavorful. I like my mexican food extra spicy, so I added some hot taco sauce to the beef/taco seasoning mixture along with some chilli powder and cayenne pepper. It was fabulous.

My aunt makes this for family gatherings and it is fantastic!  One thing she does differently is place everything (except lettuce) on a microwave-safe platter, then microwave on high for about 20 to 30 seconds just until the cheese is melted.  Yum!

Wow, this dip is AMAZING. I am asked to make it all the time. Great dish for cookouts and large gatherings. I find that people stand around this dish, picking at it!! :) Some adjustments I make to it are: 1) I buy one can diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomato 2) I use a can of chili (no beans) instead of fresh ground beef 3) I mix in a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch “Fiesta Dip” in w/ the sour cream & cream cheese (FABULOUS) 4) I start off the dip with a layer of refried beans – I mix 1/2 packet of taco seasoning with the beans 5) I don’t use onions, olives, taco sauce, or lettuce (gets soggy). The dip turns out fine without those things, but you can add them (or other things) if you like. My layers are as follows: Base layer is refried beans (with taco seasoning), then sour cream/cream cheese/fiesta dip layer, then (drained) diced tomatoes, then guacamole (1 container Dean’s guacamole dip works great), then the can of chili, and then I finish it off with the cheddar cheese. I bake it in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes, or just enough to melt the cheese a bit. Serve it with Tostitos Scoops, they are great. People go INSANE over this recipe.

I agree - this is best with refried beans as the bottom layer, it makes it even thicker so you can eat it with chips, but you can't scoop it out of the dish with the chips.  I have made it several times and have found that it is best if I make it up to the point for the shredded cheese and veggies and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and then I usually bring the lettuce and tomato with me if I am transporting it and add it right before serving.  I have also experimented with the reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat cream cheese, and the lower sodium taco seasoning and feel that it is still a great dish.  There are so many other flavors that the reduced fat isn't a sacrifice.  It fills a 9x13 dish perfectly.  This is a great recipe!

I made this dip for a football party.  It was delicious!!  The only thing I did different was I browned the meat, drained and mixed the taco seasoning with water and simmered for 10 minutes. It was like having tacos without the mess.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

I made this for a party recently (and will for the next party coming up this month) and it was a super hit! As soon as it hit the table people crowded around it and stayed there until it was all gone! Anyway, I omitted the olives (mexican dip with onion & olives? - confusion) and the lettuce (afraid they would wilt). Only added 1lb of beef, 2lbs for the amount of salsa is just too much. Added some flavor to the ground beef with some seasoning before I added the salsa and let it simmer for quite some time until the meat was really tender. Consider doubling the recipe with 1lb of meat because it will be gone FAST!

I brought this dish to a baby shower and ended up giving the recipe to two people there. Everyone loved it and remarked on how good it would also be as a meal. Just crumble some chips or corn torilla and serve dip on top. Anyway you serve it, it was really good and a big hit!

I really liked this recipe and so did everyone else at the Super Bowl party we took it to.  I made mine in a disposable 8x8 cake pan and it worked out great.  I will definitely make this again!  I also made a low fat version by using light sour cream, nonfat cream cheese and nonfat refried beans.  It was okay but not nearly as good as the original.

I almost tossed this recipe out!  Made it with a bottom layer of refried beans, then a layer of ground beef and continued to follow instructions.  Thought the taste was so-so.   BUT.....the next day I changed my mind.  Served chilled with Tostitos Scoops - it was very good.

I really enjoyed this recipes as did my guests at a party.  It is a bit thick for a "dip" so I put a spoon in it and we just put it on our plates.

I also substituted refried beans for the meat as I don't eat meat.  The only other change I would make is to eliminate the lettuce because while it looks nice it serves no purpose and it there are leftovers the lettuce doesn't keep well.

This is a great recipe and should definitely be tried!

I modified this recipe to include low fat shredded cheese and low fat sour cream and cream cheese.  By doing so, none of the flavor was lost.  I also added a bottom layer of refried beans for extra fiber.  Wonderful!!

If you want to add a layer of refried beans on the bottom, mix the beans with some taco sauce, salsa, or whatever you may have in your fridge to make it creamier and easier to dip. It's also better to make the refried bean and sour cream/cr cheese layer the night before and allow the flavors to develop.

I can't even tell you how much of hit this dip was!!  I brought it to a New Year's Eve party and it went FAST.  The next time I brought it to a party (with the same people) it didn't even get from the kitchen to the table!!  Only difference from the recipe was that I didn't use black olives.

This was really good.  I only used a little over a lb of ground beef and I used hot pace picante sauce to mix with it (family preference.)  I had the veggie toppings on the side so people could choose on their own what they wanted.  Also, that way if I had leftovers (first time making it so wasn't sure) I did not have to worry about anything getting soggy when enjoying in the 2nd time around.. Thats why I love reading the reviews on this site beforehand.  Makes it easy to plan ahead sometimes. I did prepare the night before and it was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I've made this dip many times and everyone loves it.  I do add refried beans at the bottom and only use 1-lb of ground beef.  Otherwise it is perfect and always goes fast!

I'm going to add to the glowing reviews for this recipe.  I've been taking 7 layer dip to parties for a long time, and this is much better!  I add refried beans, green chilis and lots of garlic to the meat layer, and it's fabulous.  I've even done it with ground chicken and ground pork, and it's all good.  Like others, I cut the amount of meat to about one pound, and it was plenty.  Definitely try this.

I took the advice of other reviews and used a 9x13 and added refried beans as the bottom layer (2 cans).  The suggestion for putting in a can of chili with no beans in with the cream cheese mixture was excellent.  My guests ate it, but didn't devour it.  It was good for leftovers also.  Did use lettuce as decorative border as suggested.

Delicious dip! I only used a little over one pound and found that to be more than enough meat. I also added some onion and pepper to the meat while it was cooking to give it a kick. Overall great recipe!

Made this for a party.  Everyone who ate it, loved it.  I had a small casserole dish to put it in, so I only used 1 lb. of meat and 8 oz. of taco sauce and just enough cheese to cover the previous layer.  I was a little fuzzy on how to layer, so I spread half the cream cheese/sour cream mixture in the bottom of the dish, then added the meat, then spread the rest of the sour cream/ cream cheese mixture over the meat, then added the cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, green onion and olives.  I served at room temp and it was delicious.  My husband and I have been warming it up since then, and it is still awesome.  I would definitely make this again.

I took this recipe to a superbowl party and it didn't last 10 minutes!  I used ground turkey in place of the ground beef and added a jalapeno pepper for an extra kick.  Awesome recipe, thank you so much.

This isn't really a dip as you need utensils to eat this.  I liked the cream mixture with the taco seasoning but the 2 lbs. of ground beef/lettuce/tomato mixture on top was too bulky for chips.  I served at a appetizer party along w/ chips and had to put a big spoon in the dish to get people to put it on thier plate and it was eaten with a fork. Next time I'll cut the meat and some toppings in half so it can be dipped.

This recipe was terrific. I made it for the first time last night for a Firefighter's Family Party and it was gone in 30 minutes. It is quick and easy to prepare and the presentation looks great. 
I served it in a 9 x 13 baking dish and it fit perfect! I hope you all enjoy this recipe as much as I did!

Read the other reviews prior to making.  Started with a layer of refried beans, then the layer of the cream cheese/sour cream mixture, then used 1 lb. beef and the full jar of taco sauce, then ended with cheese.  Put that all in the fridge overnight then added the lettuce, tomatoes and green onions the next day.  I didn't use the black olives as we don't care for them.  Next time I would use 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef and still do the refried bean layer.  Would make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. Since I like beans in my dip, I did only use 1 pound of beef and 1 can of refried beans. I browned the meat, drained and then added the can of beans and taco sauce. It was a hit and very yummy. Everyone liked the beef/bean combination.

This is a big hit where ever I go. The only thing I changed was, I used 2 8oz pkgs of Cream cheese and 1 8oz sour cream, I like the dip to be thicker.

This was a huge hit! I made half just as the recipe says since kids were going to be eating some of this, and half with the changes that senoritak made with the red/yellow/green peppers and sliced jalapenos. All the grown ups LOVED the jalapeno side and gobbled it up!  I didn't add alot of the red/yellow/green peppers this time. Next time I will cover it in jalapenos (which are not hot at all if you don't add the seeds). Very pretty presentation as well.

This is so good. I was wary of a cold dip but it really just taste like taco salad. Loved it. And Bumblebee is right, you probably will want to make two. I had 7 adults at a meeting and they cleaned out the serving dish.

This is by far the best Mexican dip...the only difference is I heat it for 15 minutes before putting on the tomatos/lettuce and then I also add salted chopped avocado...VERY GOOD!

I have yet to meet a person who didn't LOVE this and beg for the recipe.  It is very filling (and addictive) so beware of serving it as an appitizer if you are serving a big meal.  Also makes EXCELLENT leftovers, toss it in the microwave and then stir it up... so good!!

I have made this dip twice now since finding the recipe, and everyone loves it! I also changed the meat to only 1 lb and I let it simmer for awhile to really soak up the taste and I use HOT taco sauce for some extra taste. I have found that if you buy the shredded iceberg lettuce in a package it doesn't get wilted.  Thanks for a great recipe and the guests thank you too!

I love this recipe.  My family loved it as well.  I cooked the beef with green onions, added garlic, then made a mistake after reading another reviewers addition.  I added a can of Rotel to the meat, a jar of taco sauce and cooked it down.  I was trying to make a little bigger recipe, so I added an extra cream cheese, then worried about the taco flavoring not being enough.  I added an envelope of Fiesta Hidden Valley Ranch Dip mix to it.  Layered it and it was excellent!

I've been making this for awhile now and if I'm going to any type of function and ask what to bring many times I'm told that I can bring nothing else but this!!  It's really good!  I've made it with and without refried beans due to some peoples tastes and it's great both ways!!

This recipie turned out great.  Quick and easy!  My bible study group loved it.  I changed two things.  Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a can of rotel and drained of the juice.  I also omitted the lettuce since my dip would not be eaten right away and was not sure if the lettuce would wilt.  It turned out fantastic.

I made this for a party and it was the first thing to go.  I did add beans to the meat layer.  It was so good, and I will definately make it again.

I made this for an appetizer at a Christmas party this year and it was just ok. It made a huge pan so make sure you have a lot of people to eat it. I think I will try making it again sometime but I will leave out the lettuce and only make half the recipe. The leftovers didn't get eaten either. I tried some the next day cold but it wasn't very good. I heated it up in the microwave and it tasted better but then the lettuce was all soggy. Not the best dip I've ever made, that's for sure.

I made this recipe exactly as it shows. I didn't think it had too much meat....It was a very hearty dip. I served it with Tostitos Scoops tortilla chips. It was wonderful...Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

If I make this again I will use less meat, more cream cheese, green chili peppers, serve warm, and add the lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and olives after baking.

This dip was fabulous!  I made it using only 1lb. of ground beef and I let it cook a bit more after adding the taco sauce to boil off some of the liquid.  I also started with a layer of refried beans (1 can), and omitted the lettuce.  Tip: make sure the cream cheese is very soft and add the sour cream gradually or you will have sour cream with lumps of cream cheese throughout.  Definitely a keeper!

I served this for a bunch of 18 year old kids who play high school soccer and recieved many compliments.  I doubled the recipe and it create an entire casserole size that was at least 2 inches thick.  I think one serving is probably enough for most parties.  Great recipe!

Wow! I was really skeptical when I read the reviews about making two. I just served this at my mom-in-law's surprise 50th b-day and it was the first thing gone! There was only a tiny bit left when I got to the food table. I only used one pound of ground beef but used a whole bottle of taco sauce. It was so good that I am going to make it for my Bible Study group tomorrow night!

I made a couple of changes.    Cream cheese/sour cream mixture was cooled in the fridge before adding the ground beef mixture.   I used medium salsa and omitted the black olives.    Next time I will use pepper jack cheese.

Love, love , love this. I use one pound of ground instead of two and a jar of chunky salsa instead of taco sauce. I also like to put it in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese and then put the lettuce, tomato and olives on. I could make a meal out of this. So good.

This was best Mexican layer dip ever! Only addition I made was added a layer of corn salsa and refried beans. Was going to add layer of guac too but ran out of room! There weren't any leftovers and when that happens you know you have a winner!

Absolutely the correct name for this dish "FANTASTIC"  I made this for my birthday and the three Afghanis young male refugees living with us inhaled it, even though they had never encountered anything like it before!!  As other reviewers suggested, I too layered the bottom with refried beans and mounded the salad on a plater surrounded by tortilla chips.  I also omitted the sliced black olives because they are not available here in my small town in Sweden and I had too many other things to prepare (I made an appetizer buffet), so I saved myself some time by not chopping any whole olives.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!  Oh, and it made a very pretty presentation.

This was a nice cold meal for a summer night!  I used chicken instead of beef, and I used diced cucumber from my garden in place of the lettuce.  It worked nicely!

Wonderful!!  I left out the beef and added diced orange bell pepper instead of black olives.

I made this for a New Years Eve party.  Every last bit of it went.  I only used 1 lb of ground beef though, which was plenty.

I have made this recipe many times over the last several years. It's easy,delicious and can be made a day ahead of time. When I asked my daughter what she wanted me to serve for her "end of school year party" she asked for this "taco dip"! It's a huge crowd pleaser for all ages!

I have to rate this with 4 stars because it's no different (in the taste) than the nachos I make occasionally.  The only true difference is the form...nachos have the chips underneath them and this dip has the chips on the side for dipping.  I guess I was hoping for something different tonight for dinner, but it turned out to be my old standby (nachos) with the chips on the side.  I may make this again for a gathering, but probably not for myself at home.

This is truly the best mexican dip around. It has become a Superbowl and all around party favorite. As one other reader mentioned you can cut down on the amount of beef and still get a fabulous result!! Thanks for sharing Bumblebee...

This dip is sooo good!  A party favorite!  Have made this 3 times in 4 weeks.  Can't seem to get sick of it!  I only use 1 lb of hamburger instead of 2 lbs.  Just a personal preference because I'm not a big meat eater!  Would highly recommend!!!!

This dip is AMAZING!!  I have made it multiple times for parties and I never have any to bring home!  Two things that I do to give it a little more flavor is I season the beef with Taco Bell taco seasoning and I also add some Taco Bell taco seasoning in with the cheese and then give it a quick toss with my fingers before adding it to the dish.  It just gives it a little more kick.

DELICIOUS!!! Otherwise, you're doing something wrong!!  There's no way that this dish is bland because it's packed with flavor - the taco seasoning really jazzes up the meat. I added a layer of refried beans at the bottom.

I made this for a cookout recently and everybody loved it!  Everyone wanted the recipe because they liked it so much.  I did follow advice from others and used only 1 lb. of beef, used whipped cream cheese, and I also left off the tomatoes and olives because several people there don't care for them.  Other than that I left everything else as it was and it turned out really well.  Will be making again!

Pretty good...it is a thick dip so your chips break pretty easily in it. And its almost like a taco salad.
We had plenty of leftovers and it was good the next day. :)

This was so-so...only half was consumed at the party.  It was missing something - maybe refried beans and a bit more spice - although I did use 'hot' taco seasoning.  I probably won't make this again...

This recipe was a good, solid taco dip recipe.  We enjoyed in on Superbowl weekend.  We did change it slightly, adding 1/2 the meat and some beans as well.  We will save it again for party food!  Good scooped up in tortillas or on chips.

My family LOVES this dip.  I make it with 1LB hamburger & 8 oz taco sauce and it is plenty.  It is always the first to go when we put the snacks out.

This was a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe - I took out the taco seasoning in the sour cream/cream cheese mixture cuz I dont like taco seasoning but everyone loved it the way it was! Thanks for the recipe!!

I served this first at a family Christmas gathering and got raves and many requests for the recipe. It made a big pan. I've since taken this to a football banquet, and it was gone in a wink!

this flew fast.  it was the item on the table that people kept convieniently walking by and sneaking a scoop of when they had already groaned about how they couldn't eat another bite.  i have given the recipe to a few people at their request and the party was only 2 days ago.

This Mexican dip is wonderful!  I fixed it for our family Christmas and a New Year's eve party, and everyone loved it.  Am getting ready to send a copy to a friend.  Love how fast and easy it was to prepare.

Everytime I make this dip for company I get rave reviews about it. I use chunky salsa instead of taco sauce and I omit the black olives.

Great dip, everyone loved it!  I substituted refried beans in the bottom and left out the olives for personal taste..
