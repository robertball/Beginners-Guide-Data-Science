My family really liked this - even the five year old.  But it was WAY too rich for us.  I will definitely try it again, but try to use lighter products (light margarine, light dressing, reduced fat sour cream).  I made it exactly like it said and there seemed to be too much dressing and cheese -and my family LOVES cheese.  I may cut this to only 1 cup dressing and 2 cups swiss cheese next time as well.

I made this for dinner last evening, and made a couple of substitutions.  I substituted fat free sour cream and fat free thousand Island dressing for a lighter fare.  I also used PAM on the baking dish and used real butter (better for you than margarine).  I also used strictly light rye bread cubes.  The recipe came out great and it was actually healthier than the original.  Great recipe!!!

I'm not a real big reuben fan but this was great! I made this for my husband's carry-in at work, and they loved it! I just made a few modifications to the recipe. One, I put the sauerkraut on the bottom and omitted the bread cubes, but put extra on top. We used canned corned beef instead of deli style and it did excellent in this recipe, and a cost saver also! I made this the night before and thought with all the sitting, and early morning cooking (5am) that the bottom cubed bread would have gotten really soggy. They loved this recipe at work, it really went fast. The next time I make this I would reduce the dressing to 1 cup (8 oz) and mix with the sour cream. Even straining the sauerkraut really well and wringing it, there was a bit too much liquid in the bottom, but everyone loved this casserole! Super on a cold winter's day at work! 
Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic!!!!!  I toasted the bread prior assembling the casserole and it did not get soggy at all.  I also decrease the amount of swiss cheese to 2 cups.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  This will definitely become one of our regular recipes.

This tasted just like a reuben sandwich and my husband said it was even better!! :) I used deli corned beef and had them slice it about 1/2" thick, which worked out well and made it very easy to cut into cubes... The only ingredient changes I made were I didn't add the minced onion (we didn't miss it and besides, there are no onions on a reuben sandwich), I used LIGHT sour cream instead of regular, and I only used 10 slices of just the light rye bread because that's what I had on hand... To keep them from getting too soggy, I toasted the bread cubes first and made sure to squeeze out as much of the sauerkraut juice as I could before I layered it on top of the bread cubes... For the topping, I slightly crumbled about 1 cup of the toasted bread cubes and then tossed them in the melted butter, then sprinkled them on top of the cheese... Oh, and I sprayed the foil w/PAM before covering it, to keep it from sticking... YUM! YUM! I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is delicious! Thank you! Tastes like a Big Mac. Yum. Instead of using 2 different breads I used the Pepperidge Farm Rye/Pumpernickle Swirl Bread and layered the ingredients: bread, kraut, beef, dressing, cheese, repeat. Fantastic! Although I haven't tried it, I'm sure this recipe would be good using chicken and light dressing to cut a few calories.

Since I detest Reubens, but the rest of my family loves 'em, I thought I would try it.My husband and kids really liked this one. The only thing they all agreed on would be to add more of the thousand island mixture next time. It apparently made a good lunch the next day around, as my husband said it heated up well in the microwave.

This was delicious.  I cut the recipe in half (although I still had to use more bread) and it still made a large pan.  Have enough leftovers for 2 more nights.

This is a fantastic recipe. I took a couple of suggestions from other reviewers and used marble rye and toasted the bread cubes. I drizzled 4 TBSP. of melted butter over the bread cubes before I toasted them. I kept out 1 cup of the toasted bread cubes and crushed them for the topping. I also drained and rinsed the sauer kraut and squeezed out all of the excess moisure that I could. I layered the ingredients as the recipe stated, but did not drizzle with the melted margarine, as I used the butter when toasting the bread cubes. This turned out as close to a grilled reuben as you can get. My DH loved it and had 3 helpings. The corned beef was expensive $9.99/lb, but if you figure what it would cost to have a good grilled reuben out, it was a bargain. I had the deli cut the corned beef into 1/2" slices so when I got home all I had to do is cube it. A wonderful recipe that will be made many more times for my family and friends. My co-workers are in for a treat at our next pot luck. Thanks for the recipe and the tips!

This was pretty good.  I used another recipe from this site to cook my corned beef prior.  It is the Corned Beef and Cabbage II recipe--which I highly recommend. I used only light Rye bread, that's all I could find.  I think I needed a stronger flavor of Rye than what I used.  I used fat free thousand island & I don't recommend that.  I think it needs more flavor from the dressing than the fat free offers.  I did, however, use the light sour cream and would do that again.  This dish tasted much better as leftovers.  I will make this again with using darker rye and thousand island with some fat!

Fabulous!  I scaled the recipe to six servings, but that was the only change made, other than using those round rye and pumpernickel loaves rather than pre-sliced bread.  This was awesome, I cannot heap enough praise on this recipe.  My seven year old wouldn't eat it, but all the rest of us loved it.  I will make this again and again.  I also think it would make a killer dip, with the corned beef shredded and all the filling baked in a round pumpernickel loaf and served with toasted party rye rounds.  My compliments to your husband's aunt, Aveyed, and to you for passing this along.

All I can say is...yummy. This taste's exactly like a reuben sandwich. I loved everything about it. I followed instructions exactly. I might use a little less dressing next time. But my husband and 2 1/2 yr old daughter and I loved it.

Cut the recipe in half and it still made plenty for my family of 5.  Only thing I would do differently next time is maybe use a little less of the sour cream and thousand island mixture, I felt like there was too much dressing.

Yes, it's rich--but so are the traditional sandwiches.  I cut this recipe in half and baked in a 9 x 9 dish--turned out great!

Excellent!!! Would make again. (The only differences were that I used fresh corned beef (lunchmeat) and only dark rye bread.)

When it was fresh and I was absolutely starving, I really liked it. But the next day, when I was hungry-ish and I reheated it as leftovers, I couldn't deal with it. Too greasy and heavy. Problematic, since the recipe makes so much. I'd probably make it again, but I'd at least halve the recipe so as not to have to pitch leftovers.

This recipe is excellent!  Served this for New Years' dinner to my parents, everyone loved it.  Only had lt. rye bread, used a little less dressing, and added some caraway seed & a little garlic powder.  This cooks up so you can slice it like lasagna--will definitely add this to one of our regular recipes!

This was good but there is WAY too much bread, next time I would leave off the bread topping alltogether. If you love a good reuben, you will enjoy this!

Pretty good but probably could have done without so much of the ingredients. Next time I will cut down a little, especially on the meat.

Awesome and easy.  The store was out of sliced corn beef, so I used canned.  I also used the bavarian sauerkraut because it has a great punch of flavor.  We have already shared this recipe several times and everyone loves it!  Thanks!!!

Excellent recipe, thank you!  I adjusted it to our taste... used turkey instead of corned beef and wheat bread isntead of rye.  I used light sour and no margarine at the end as well.  Turned out great!  I also enjoyed leftovers even if the bread got a little soggy.

Love this recipe!  It is a favorite in my family, even my 2 and 3 year olds love it.  We're not big fans of corned beef so I substitute turkey and it tastes great!

I made this for my husband - the Reuben is one of his favorite sandwiches and I had Corned beef to use up. He liked it, it was just ok to me. I'm not a huge sauerkraut or thousand island dressing fan. It was fine, just not great to me. However, I will likely make it again for him.

Next time, I'll about 1/2 to 3/4 of the thousand island/sour cream mix.  There was so much that I felt I should put some lettuce on my plate for a salad.  Besides this, it was good!  I only used dark rye bread to avoid having to increase the cost by buying 2 different types.  And my grocery store didn't offer shredded swiss cheese, but I just put slices on the casserole and that worked fine.  Finally, I cut the recipe in half for 2 people and have PLENTY of leftovers!

OMG...I really don't know what to say... except it's THE BEST casserole EVER! I wouldn't alter this. I did have to substitute butter for margarine, & I couldn't find sliced rye, so I used those neat loaves you get at a bakery.

Good concept but way too rich- and i love ruebens
cut back the dressing and sour cream way to much and the bread on the bottom got way to mushy- I'll still be looking for a reuben casserole.

Wonderful recipe!  Everything about this dish was good.  I used a round rye loaf (that's all that was left at the grocery store the weekend before St. Pats Day)and it turned out great.  A definite keeper!

Good overall concept.  My husband loved it even with my changes.  Tried to lighten up this recipe by omitting butter and sour cream.  Made my own 1K island with light mayo, ketchup, and relish--used 2 C dressing total.  Added 1C beef broth (my husband hates dry casseroles and they have to heat up well for his lunches).  Only thing I found objectionable about this dish was that the onion was not cooked down sufficiently for my tastes.  Will make again, but I am going to use more onion, Carmelize it (oil, sugar and onion in a lidded pan on low), add a little flour for a roux and add a full 15oz can of beef broth for a thin oniony gravy.  Hoping if done in this manner will make the texture a little more silky.  May also add a few caraway seeds, would have liked the rye flavor to be a bit stronger.  Sprayed bottom of my pan as well, and Used 1lb loaf of swirl rye bread split between top and bottom, torn in little pieces.  Layered ingredients in the middle, squeezed out the kraut.  Held back some cheese to put on top of the bread--was a little crunch here and there, and my husband got his moist casserole.

Really like this one for a cool Fall dinner! Even the teen liked it. If the dressing mix is too much, just reduce it a bit - no biggie.  I didn't cube the bread, just tore it into pieces, and you know what - turned out fine. This is a lovely, no-brainer meal!

Just made this with some left over corned beef.  I used sauteed cabbage with onion instead of the sauerkraut because I didn't have any at home. It was still delicious and I could imagine how it would have tasted with the kraut. I also used light dressing but regular sour cream. We will have it again! Thanks!

Yummy! I made the recipe as is - except I reduced the meat to 3/4 pound - and had the deli shred/slice it for me real thin instead of cutting it into bite-size pieces myself. Left the rest the same and the whole family raved over it. Definitely a keeper!

I'm reviewing this without having tasted it.  I served this for a church social event and it was inhaled before I got a chance to try it.  But, from the compliments I got on it I'm thinking it must be good.  I read the reviews before making this and am glad I took some of the advice. I made the rye into 'croutons' which was a really good choice.  I also drained and squeezed the kraut.  I think those 2 things really helped to make the dish.  It was not soggy at all and supposedly tasted exactly like a Reuben. So - a winner!

Made according to recipe and the family really liked it.  Only change I would make the second time is to double the sauerkraut.  It really does taste like a Reuben.

I like this one a lot.  I left the cheese off my portion because I don't like cheese, but otherwise followed the instructions and it worked very well.  Many reviewers complained of soggy bread but I didn't have that problem; perhaps because I "wrung out" the sauerkraut before adding it.  I did chop up a dill pickle and put it on top of mine after tasting it and I think that was an improvement, but it was darn good as written.

I made this a second time.  This time, I used mini loaf pans so my sauerkraut and mustard wouldn't pollute my husband's portion and his cheese wouldn't melt onto mine.  Again, the results are excellent even though I prepared it ahead of time and left it in the fridge most of the day before baking it this afternoon.  I can't imagine how people get this to be soggy.

I made a 9x13& an 8x8 pan.  I used extra sour cream, butter,sauerkrat, and swiss cheese. I bought sliced swiss( it took longer to melt). Still turned out delish. Also I only used one kind of rye bread. For my 8x8 pan I did'nt use thousand island dressing just sour cream.  I sprayed foil with cooking spray underneath  one side so cheese would'nt stick. I shared  most with my neighbors. Thank you for the recipe.  It's a rueben in a pan. Two thumbs up.

Guys I made this for said tasted just like a deconstructed warmed Reuben.  I used a pound of deli cut corned beef and chopped into pieces.  I also sub-ed marble swirl rye bread and used the whole loaf (maybe 10 slices).  Toasting was recommended from other reviews, glad I did so it

Love this recipe!   I toasted the bread cubes in  the oven for about 15 minutes and used sauerkraut with caraway seeds.   Delicious AND something I can throw together after work.   This recipe is a keeper.

This is a really delicious recipe.  One trick that prevented the bread from getting soggy (even when reheated as leftovers), was to lightly pan saute the bread cubes in butter to make croutons.    This recipe has made it into our regular meal rotation.

This was very good.  Jeremy of course didn't like it but instead of a reuben sandwich it was very good and easy to make

Very good  & easy recipe. I like to cook my cornbeef in the crockpot. I've never done the layering, just mix it all up and toss in a baking dish, saving some bread cubes for the top. Have brought to work in a crockpot, toasting some bread crumbs for the top and adding them on later, closer to eating time - turned out really good. Just incase you don't have a stove handy to bake.

Fantastic! My tasters screamed with joy. I've made them try quite a few but this was the winner.

Super delicious.  I used corned beef lunchmeat because the recipe doesn't say to used cooked but I figured it must be.  So good!  A little expensive but get your corned beef at Aldi and cook yourself, much cheaper.

I made this tonight and it is very good.  I messed up the recipe a bit.  I used too much bread, but it made it more like a sandwich to be honest.  I just sort of made it from memory.  Guess my memory isn't that great!  I skipped the sour cream and used about a half cup Thousand Island dressing squirted over the casserole.  Good...and I'll have it again.  Hubby liked it.

Mmmm good!  I used light sour cream & used rye/pumpernickle bread combo instead of two seprate breads.  I cut the recipie in half for my huband and I but next time I make it I think I will need to make the full amount. My husband couldn't stop eating and we also like leftovers for lunch the next day.

This was terrific!  I did make some major changes though because I didn't have any bread or sauerkraut.  Instead, I sliced baked potatoes for the bottom layer.  Also, I added brussels sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower instead of sauerkraut.  I'm sure it would be great with the original ingredients too.
