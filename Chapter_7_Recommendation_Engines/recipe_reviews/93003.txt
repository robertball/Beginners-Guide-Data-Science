The Curry powder is too overpowering, to the point it burned/numbed my tongue. Also, you can’t do equal conversions of sugar to Splenda as stated in the recipe, 1 tablespoon of Splenda makes this WAY sweeter than 1 tablespoon of sugar. I can’t see myself making this again, I love curry and really liked the idea of using it in a sweet sauce there was just too much. I even added some evaporated milk to take the edge off but it didn’t help.

Very disappointing.  Followed the recipe exactly--tried to "Dr" it without any luck.
