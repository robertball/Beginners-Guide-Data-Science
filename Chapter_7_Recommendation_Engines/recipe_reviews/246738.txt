I made this! Great starter recipe, but needs a few tweaks to be perfect! I replaced the flour with King Arthur's gluten-free all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and the dessert still turned out fine, so it is possible to make this g-free AND non-deep fried! Here are a few suggested improvements, no matter what kind of flour you use:

1) The recipe says to add enough milk to make a firm dough, but you actually should make it a soft dough.

2) Spray the parchment paper with cooking oil spray (I recommend coconut oil spray), and then spray the dough balls all over with cooking spray as well, before putting them into the oven..

3) Turn the dough balls over halfway through (after seven minutes or so), or else the bottom will be scorched.

4) The syrup is very simple, so try adding some cardamom and rose water as most authentic gulab jamun recipes would call for. If you don't have cardamom and rose water on hand, try cooking the syrup with a few sprinkles of Pumpkin Pie Spice blend, and it'll still taste authentic; for some reason, when cooked with this syrup, the spice blend ends up smelling cardamom-like and rosy.
