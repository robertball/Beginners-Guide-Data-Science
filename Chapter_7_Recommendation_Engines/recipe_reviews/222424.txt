I have made this for years, but always use 1 cup heavy cream over the top. very creamy/pudding layer with the rhurbarb. I cannot imagine hot water creating the same pudding effect. good with other fruit also.

Supper Yummy and very creamy.  Didn't try it with the heavy whipping cream like the other rater put, but this was very creamy with none of the extra calories and fat.

I made my own gluten free cake mix.  Rhubarb and strawberries were used because I only had 4 cups of rhubarb.  This is a wonderful recipe with a fantastic taste!

This is my first attempt at a "pudding cake." Didn't have near enough rhubarb, so I added strawberries and even after then, we ended up with only about 3 cups. It was still delicious! It seemed weird to make, but it turned out great. I just used hot water and it was still yummy, creamy, and very moist. First night, we had with cool whip. Eating the leftovers by heating them up and putting ice cream next to it!

I used a package of strawberry Jello for part of the sugar and left out the cinnamon. So delicious!

Forgot completely about pouring the hot water on top!! Oh man…

Okay…all the baking is done. It turned out more like a cake than pudding. Still very tasty but that was the last of my frozen rhubarb to use! Next time I get more, I will definitely follow the directions!

This was excellent! One reviewer suggested using heavy cream instead of water on top of the cake, I'll try that next time. I only had white cake mix so I used that and added a good amount of each ground cinnamon and nutmeg along with a few sprinkles of ground ginger to the mix and on top of the rhubarb. I'm also not a fan of sweet desserts so I used just a half cup of sugar on top. For me and my family, it turned out perfect! Oh, and my rhubarb was frozen so I made sure to lay it out on paper towels AND squeezed excess water out of it before spreading it on the cake. Not doing so will most likely give you soup. Thanks, Michelle, for this one, I'll be using it a lot!

Easy and delicious. I substituted Greek yogurt for the oil in order to save calories and it turned out great. Irresistible straight out of the oven.
