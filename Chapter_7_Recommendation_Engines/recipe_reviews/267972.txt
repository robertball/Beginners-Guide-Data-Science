1.7.19  I haven’t bought applesauce in a jar for many, many years.  We simply prefer homemade, which I usually make in the microwave, but this method is just as easy.  The star in this applesauce and the single thing that makes it distinctive and delicious is the star anise.  It doesn’t overpower, but it is the first flavor that you taste, and it does make you wonder “…what is that?”  I love finding new recipes  that I can make in the Instant Pot®, and this will be my go-to recipe in the future.  I used MacIntosh apples, and cut back a little on the brown sugar (personal taste preference). Thanks for sharing your recipe, we really enjoyed it.

I loved how fast this recipe cooked and it didn't even need to be blended, the texture was great! I used apple cider instead of water and maple syrup instead of sugar and it had great flavor!

Loved it! I made this as written with the exception of cutting the sugar back to 1 tablespoon, we like ours a little tart.  I used a combination of Honey Crisp and Galla apples.  I love how well the ingredients work together. This will be a repeat, thanks for sharing.
