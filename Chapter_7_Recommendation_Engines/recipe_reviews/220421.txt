Could not find sun-dried tomatoes at the store but turned out great anyway! I added a bit more olive oil than the in recipe.

very awesome. 1 cup of pesto doesn't sound like a lot but it goes a long way! I love the veggies in with the pasta. I made a few adjustments because of lack of a couple ingredients but overall very tasty. Will definitely make again.

I have made this dish several times with variations of the sun dried tomatoes with sundried tomato pesto if that's the only option at the grocer. It always turns out great! It's good hot or cold, or even without chicken if you're a vegetarian. It is a regular menu item in my kitchen.

I was looking for something with chicken and asparagus, WOW!  What a find!!!  Full of flavor.  Had to sub green peppers because that's what I had, next time will use what recipe calls for.  Hubby loved it, kept asking if I had saved it...as he was devouring it.  Watch amount of oil from sun dried-tomatoes used, can become  oily.  Very easy to make on a lazy day and will certainly be making this again, thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Flavor was great. Was a little too oily for me. Next time I make it I would use sun dried tomatoes with out the oil.

Great flavor, but it was too oily for my taste. Next time, I will add the pesto ingredients, minus the oil. Or, as someone else suggested, use sundried tomatoes not packed in oil. And, because I love asparagus, I will add more. Thanks for posting a great recipe

I was concerned the pesto would be overpowering, but it was just perfect.  Nice light tasting meal for a summer evening (not necessarily healthy with oil).   Super quick to prepare for an amazing meal.

I made this for my family and friends this evening.  It was a huge (and I do mean huge!) hit!  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.  However, next time, I'll double it so we have leftovers.  By the way, you can adjust any of the ingredients to suit your personal preferences.

I wanted this a bit lighter and saucier so I only used about half a cup of pesto, and added a cup of chicken broth. Thickened a bit with Wondra. It was a little too oily so I need to watch that next time.

I par cooked the asparagus in a microwave steamer and I added the cheese at the end on individual plates. It was really good, I'll make it again for sure.

This is a very flavorful dish.  Everyone loved it.  I added chopped mushrooms and chopped garlic which really added to it.  I think you could add zucchini or spinach also.  I love lots of veggies!  It is delicious.

This was great, quick and easy. I used farfalle noodles as it's easier for my kids to eat. I used twice as much asparagus, an 8.5oz jar of sun-dried tomatoes (which were almost impossible to find), and red and green peppers since I didn't have yellow. I did put some salt and pepper on the chicken - my husband said it could've used more seasoning on chicken and suggested I marinade it in the pesto or a sun-dried tomato pesto next time. The kids loved it so I'd definitely make it again. Oh and I added some halved cherry tomatoes I'd gotten from a friend the morning I was making this and figured why not! They were a great addition

This was excellent.  I was a little nervous that the chicken wouldn't have much flavor but I followed the recipe and it came out beautifully. It's going on our regular menu. Thanks!!

I made this after a long day of work when I didn't have a ton of energy left.  I followed the recipe (except substituted spaghettini for angel hair) and it was TERRIFIC.  It got have reviews from both of us and we are looking forward to finishing off the leftovers at lunch tomorrow.

YUM!  This was awesome!  The only thing I did differently was use these small tortellini-type pasta that I had, and I did not put the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes in it.  I also added mushrooms.  This was so good!  Perfect flavors!  The pasta was very yummy and definitely added something, I think.

This was excellent especially the next day as leftovers! My only complaint was that the pasta was very sticky and difficult to mix with the other ingredients. Next time I will add a little olive oil to the boiling water when I cook the pasta.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious! I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I used half a can of fire roasted tomaotes and it is very good. You can't go wrong with this one!
