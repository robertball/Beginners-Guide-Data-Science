I made this for tapas at my bar in Spain and it went down a treat. Didn't  do any pre cooking just chucked everything in the slow cooker and all turned out fine. I added chorizo sausage and mushrooms and it  got thumbs up from all my customers

Good, but needed more flavor. Next time I will add some chopped garlic, salt, and pepper when cooking the potatoes and onion. After it was done I served it with some extra cheese.

Made as written except I added a few sliced mushrooms that needed used up. These were good and quite messy. I think they could easily be baked in the oven in a glass dish for 30 minutes or so if you don't have time for the slow cooker. Regardless, I think they were good and something I would make again.

Added pepperoni, browned turkey sausage, onion, mushrooms, black olives, yellow pepper and cheese.  Did three layers with one medium potato per layer.  added fresh herbs from the garden to the top layer of cheese as well as a little garlic powder.  poured remaining sauce over the top diluted with a little water for moisture.  it was absolutely delicious and way better in this heat that a 500 degree oven!

Simple and easy!  I diced the potatoes, onions and pepperoni and did not add the cheese till 15 minutes before serving! Turned out great!

It was great. A big hit with my family.  My husband has trouble chewing pizza crust, he was well pleas do with it.  Now he can enjoy pizza again.  Next time l will add salt and pepper to the patatoes they were a little bland.   I will also add more pizza toppings.

My husband made this and said he pretty much stuck to the recipe. He said, if anything, he might have added a little more cheese, as we have a tendency to do that on most recipes. :)  He said he cooked it for seven hours. 
We both enjoyed it and will make it again.

Yummy, simple. I added S&P, garlic cloves and albahaca, before serving I added parmesan cheese as well.

I used me Pampered Chef Slicer which slices potatoes/onions very thin. I say this because this recipe was done in far less than 6-8 hours. I put them on high for one hour since I didn’t start making them until 1 p.m.  We were eating at 4:30. I did add fresh ground black pepper, salt and minced garlic. I also used a 15 oz. jar of pizza sauce, but I think I also used “large” instead of medium sized potatoes.  Next time I think I’ll add Italian seasonings.  I noticed 2 reviews had trouble cleaning their Crock Pot. I use a Ninja Cooking System, which I LOVE; it’s a stovetop, slowcooker, oven and steamer all in one; I had NO problem with burnt on debris in my. Pan.  We had leftovers for dinner today; they reheated very well. I will make them again. I would also consider taking them to a potluck.

It was ok a little bland for my taste. I am going to try again adding more ingredients such as garlic, mushrooms, oregano, and zucchini. Kids ate it but did not ask me to make it again. Never to be outdone will attempt to win them over.

I left out the pepperoni and added drained and rinsed black beans. My family devoured it and wants me to make it again. 
My rating was 4 stars because  the slow cooker was tough to clean. A liner would have been a great help.

The potatoes were very bland and the entire recipe seemed boring. I ate it once, but not the leftovers nor would I make it again!

This dish is delicious! It even tasted better than I thought it would. (And I thought it was going to be really good.) I will definitely be making it again.
