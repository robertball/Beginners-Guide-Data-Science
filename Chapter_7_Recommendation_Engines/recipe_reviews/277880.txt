Made as written and this was really good. I was afraid the cheetos would get soggy but they held up well. The one thing I didn't care for was that the savory snack mix with toasted cereal (such as ChexÂ® Mix) is already seasoned so they got a double dose. Next time I'll toss them in at the end after the other stuff has absorbed the homemade seasoning. This is fairly expensive to make but it makes a ton!
