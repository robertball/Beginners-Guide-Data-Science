I made this dish and served it with rice and it was very delicious. Just wonderful. I used dry curry leaves and omited asafoetida powder. So good, thanks!

This was amazing! It was the perfect blend of spices and flavors. I put it over basmati rice. I was not a fan of the texture of the fresh cilantro with the rice and koora, but the next day I heated up the cilantro with the leftovers altogether and it softened to a more pleasant texture. Next time I will probably add the cilantro with the water. Thank you for this simple, yummy recipe!

Very good.  I couldn't find the dried red chili peppers so I doubled up on the red chili powder, with okay results.  Will definitely make again.
