While this is great as is, to change the flavor and color up a little, add a few drops of liquid smoke to the dressing and use blueberries instead of grapes.

It seemed a litle blah to me.  Wondering if it could be because I used salad dressing instead of mayonaise.  I tried adding salt to the finihed product but still feel like it needed a little zing.

Definitely will make it again. Needed something quick and cool. Had leftover Brown rice in the fridge. Used drained canned chicken and after reading the reviews added Worcestershire to the mayonnaise. Quick, easy and delicious. Will make it again for sure. Four stars because I changed the recipe but really a five star.

I wanted to try a different type of chicken salad and this definitley fit the bill! Next time I will cut down on the red onion thats for sure. I love onion but for this dish (and my tastes) I will halve it. Other than that it was pretty tasty and will make again. I did feel like it was missing something....just can't put my finger on it. Hopefully someone figures it out and writes a review, thats where i get most of my inspiration from!!
