I made this dish last year. I did not add any extra salt whilst cooking. The pancetta and chicken broth had enough salt to flavor it. There was a salt shaker on the table but no one in my family added any. We reckoned the 2 tablespoons was a typo. The dish was delicious without the additional salt.

Tasty, filling, good for a cool winter evening, this would probably be better over some pasta or polenta, but since I a low-carbing it, this fills the bill.  I wondered about the 2 Tablespoons of salt, but in the finished dish, it is not overdone.  I used low-sodium chicken broth, and I garnished with bacon, as I did not have pancetta.  Other than these slight changes, I followed the recipe, exactly.  We will have leftovers for lunch this week, and I'm happy about that.  Thanks for the idea.  It's nice to have another way to cook blsl chicken.

It was easy and surprisgly tasty. Added egg noodles after removing chicken for about 7 minutes and returned chicken to finish. Thickened it nicely.

This was delicious! Even my husband, who normally says "It's OK", thoroughly enjoyed it.  I did add some frozen corn, additional garlic, & about 1 T of diced, roasted hot jalapenos.  So glad there are leftovers.

This recipe is very good. I did however replaced the breast for boneless thighs. It ended up with the right texture: not too broth like nor thick like oatmeal. I did change the procedure a bit. I cubed the thighs and cooked them before the pancetta to seal the chicken. After adding the broth, I added both the pre cooked chicken pieces and the pancetta to the mix and proceeded to simmer as directed. The soup was flavorful. Just keep in mind that doing this will require you to be careful with the amount of additional salt you add to the recipe. Pancetta is very salty so you can reduce the amount of salt that the recipe calls for.  The broth might "taste bland" but once you take a spoonful with the pancetta the salt amount is actually just right.

This was great.  I read the reviews and made the following changes to suit my family's taste:

I used one large orange pepper, 2 cipollini onions.  I omitted all but a few shakes of salt which I added when sautéing the onions, pepper & garlic.  I halved the pepper, used a little less thyme - probably 3/4 tbs.  I didn't have tomato paste so use a 6oz can of no salt tomato sauce and added a can of drained garbanzo beans alongside the two cans of artichoke hearts.

Next time: I may use one less chicken breast (mine were really large) and pull back a little more on the pepper for my picky 9 year old.    My husband said this is his new favorite soup!

Didn't add any salt and only had vegetable broth to use and it was still very salty! I suggest using vegetable broth, and low sodium of whatever you choose.  Probably can use less, pancetta 5-6oz. I added, and suggest adding, 1 jalapeno.   It is very seasoned so I suggest using the suggested amount of seasoning or less but no salt.  I added 2 chopped up Roma tomatoes, which I can't say I really tasted or so take it or leave it. The frozen corn seems like a good idea and maybe some tortilla s strips.  I added 3 medium sized potatoes , cut in chunks, when the onion, peppers, tomatoes etc. was added as the dish needed some starch (pasta or rice, as others suggested).  The boiled chicken taste rubbery to me even though it was easy.  I suggest buying a rotisserie chicken and adding it at the end, no skin.

The carnivore BF loved this! I cut the recipe to 3 servings because it was just for him, but used 3 boneless, skinless thighs for his preference. No pancetta, just bacon. I did up all the herbs, tomato paste,  and broth for a saucier outcome( due to throat cancer he does better with juicier foods). I served over egg noodles and he just ate it up! Will make this again!

Turned out great, made in one large fry pan. After veggies done, I removed them and added chicken to brown and cut into serving size strips instead of shredding. After adding the broth and veggies back in, I added German Spaetzle noodles, they cooked quickly in the broth, they added chopped artichoke hearts. Topped at serving with the cooked Italian Pancetta, this is a nice crunchy addition. Mine was not too stew like as the noodles soaked up a lot of the broth. Will make again. An easy weeknight dinner

I have made this a few times now because it is so good!  I used about half the amount of pancetta and added it back in with the chicken rather than saving it as a garnish.  I also used way less salt and pepper!  Very quick and easy to make, flavorful and healthy!

This was a great quick and hearty supper. I halved the salt, no other changes were made. We had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day and like any good soup or stew it was even better.

The salt ruined what should have been an awesome meal. Even with unsalted broth it was mostly unbearable. Will definitely make again without the added salt and cut the other spices in half.

I liked this recipe however it was very spicy. I only added one tablespoon of salt as I thought 2 tablespoons would be way to much salt for me. I wonder if the tablespoon of pepper, basil and thyme should be a teaspoon. I'll make it again with less pepper and see how I like it. I served it over Rotini noodles.

Very good flavor and mixture of different textures!  2 tablespoons of SALT is too much.  I used one and a half (1 1/2) tablespoons and felt it was still too much.  Nest time I will us only 1/2 tablespoon and after cooking chicken breasts will taste broth!!!

I followed the recipe to the T with the exception of how the chicken was prepared. I cubed the raw chicken and then added to the stew which skipped a step in the process and made it more consistent.

Why did you put “2 tablespoons salt” in this recipe?? 
I had to throw it out!
I loved all the ingredients (sans salt) so I’m sure I will love it.

This is an easy recipe and very tasty.  I cut the salt, pepper and herbs in half the second time I made it.  The first try seemed to be a bit heavy, on the black pepper and thyme especially.

Are used bone broth instead of vegetable broth and added hot Italian sausage. Cooked in the crockpot and have a delicious dinner for four nights a sourdough bread. Healthy, high in protein, and delicious!

The recipe was delicious- but it was way too salty. I would change the salt to more than 1 teaspoon. The bacon was delicious on top but was salty as well. Besides the salt issue, my family really liked the dish a lot.

This was good but it could have been great without all the salt.  It had an interesting flavor with the artichokes but I only used 1 can.  2 cans could have been too much.  So, all in all it was good but should cut salt and artichokes ingredients in half.

Spicy due to the black pepper, but so delicious and very easy to make. I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe.  Nixed the bell peppers.  Too many artichokes, so next time I'll use a little less.

We thought it had great flavor!  I couldn't find pancetta bacon, so regular bacon worked fine. Added partially cooked tortellini to the last 10 minutes of simmering.  Topped with parmesan cheese. This is a hearty stew. Might try Italian sausage crumbles mixed in next time.

Would categorize this as soup, not a stew, since the base is very thin & broth like. It's delicious, but needs a bit of cooked, small sized pasta, like orzo or pastina, to make it complete. 
Will make it again for sure!

I just gave it 4 stars because there are a changes to make it a 5. I didn't put in the amount of salt in the recipe, that's way to much. Same with the pepper. I would drop that down to 1 1\2 tbsp. Other than that, we really enjoyed it. It's a nice change from heavier stews. My partner said it's more like a stoup lol. I will definitely be making this again.

My family loved this.  However, after reading a few reviews I made a change with the salt.  I only used 1 tb.   Also I subbed uncurred bacon instead of the pancetta.  I chose to quickly brown the chicken breasts in the bacon oil before adding the vegetables.  Lastly, I added sliced fresh mushrooms with the peppers and onions.  This is a great stew that can be eaten alone or put over pasta.

Wonderfully flavored meal except far too much salt even though I cut it in half.  Next time will not add any salt.  I skip carbs but my husband had it on rice which offset the salt some.

This was excellent. I followed the recipe except added smoked sea salt, half a lemon, and substituted pancetta for pork belly. I think if you were to use regular bacon it would overtake the whole dish.  For cooking I browned the chicken left in same pan as the pork belly then diced the chicken. Felt like the cook time would not be long enough for the chicken to shred on its own. Also Topped with fresh basil and shaved Parmesan.

This dish is ridiculously salty, based on the nutrition information provided.  149% of your daily salt IN ONE DISH? I plan to make a version of this but will drastically cut the pancetta and/or leave out the artichokes and substitute another vegetable.

I really loved this recipe! Only change I made was using regular bacon for the pancetta, otherwise followed the directions and it was terrific. I served it over egg noodles for the rest of the family but I loved it plain and am looking forward to leftovers this week. It makes a lot and I'll likely be serving it to the inlwas this weekend.
