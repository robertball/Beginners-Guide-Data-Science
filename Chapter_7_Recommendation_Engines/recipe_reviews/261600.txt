This was very good and healthy. My only complaint about it is that the butter doesn't go anywhere while cooking. When I made it the butter just stayed a glob in the middle of the shrimp and asparagus and I had to toss them around to get the butter over everything.

Absolutely amazing.  We are usually heavy handed with the garlic, and definitely took the suggestion for the smoked paprika, but other than that made it as is.  Simple and wonderful.

The first thing I did was get the shrimp in the spices to marinate instead of waiting until it was time to put them on the pan.  This was quick, easy and tasty. It's on the rotation.
