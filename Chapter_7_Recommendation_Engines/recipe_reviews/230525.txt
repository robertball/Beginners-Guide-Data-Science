This turned out really good and was perfect for New Years Day. My only complaint was with the leftovers. Leftovers turn from a bright and pretty soup to a thick ugly what used to be broth. Dark brown/purplish in color and not very appetizing to look at but the flavor was even better than the day before. Just something to think about before you dive into this. Leftovers is not a look I'd serve to company.
