I liked it except the top never browned even though it was in the oven for 21 minutes. The bottom was starting to over brown so I had to pull it out of the oven before it started burning. I used fresh basil in place of the thyme.

We changed it to basil fresh from the garden sprinkled with fresh Parmesan...yum!
