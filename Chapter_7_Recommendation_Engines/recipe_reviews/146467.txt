So the final product wasn't too bad, but making it became a disaster! I followed the directions and put the condensed milk in a sauce pan and filled it with water half way up the can and boiled it for 3 hrs...well I ended up with half a can of dark carmel (over cooked) and half a can condensed milk. I tried putting it all in a saucepan and mixing it all together and that worked somewhat. It was burned in some places, but I still served it! Everyone said it tasted fine, but it could have been better, my suggestion...boil can in water with can completely submerged, and only boil for 2-2and 1/2 hrs. That might work better.

I make a very similar recipe, and you can buy the condensed milk already caramalized in the can in the mexican/latin foods section in most grocery stores. MUCH MUCH easier this way! I whip one of these pies up in no time this way.

A similar recipe is known as Banoffi (or Banoffee) pie in the UK and was reputedly created at the Hungry Monk restaurant in Jevington, East Sussex in 1971.  Their recipe requires the condensed milk to be boiled fully submerged for 5 hours.   Originally it was served on a pastry crust.  However I use digestive biscuits crushed and mixed with butter for the base, which I assume is similar to the graham base in US, but I don't cook this - simply cool in fridge before topping with the dulce and bananas.  3/4 pint cream is whipped with 1tsp sugar and 1/2tsp  instant coffee. p.s. in UK pre-made dulce de leche is now available by the maker of a popular brand of condensed milk.

This pie was very good.  If you can't stand the clattering sound of the can boiling, lay it on its side.  Next time, I'll use two cans of condensed milk because the caramel was everybody's favorite part.

Just a note on how we make the caramel part. 2 cans of condensed milk totally covering in water in a pressure cooker on low heat for 40 minutes. This will save you a lot of time. Also, when opening the cans either cool before opening or if you don't want to wait cover with a towel while opening so you don't get any in your face.

LOVED this!  I was lazy so I bought a premade crust, and cool whip. But since I had a can of sweetened condensed milk to use I did boil it according to directions. This is awesome! Thank you for posting!

Rather than cooking the Dulce in the can (which can leach chemicals from the can into your product), pour a 14 oz can into a pint canning jar.  Place the lid on the canning jar and then follow the recipe.  An added benefit is that you can see how dark the Dulce is becoming through the jar, which you can't through a can.  I also make it in my crockpot, cooking on high for 5-6 hours.  Just make sure the water is to the level of the condensed milk.  

This pie is delicious but very calorie intense.  I make it in half pint wide mouth canning jars and put the whipped cream on at the last minute.  It makes for a cute serving container.

9.27.11 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/146467/banana-dulce-de-leche-pie-banana-caramel-pie/ ... Very rich.  Love that.  Used a 9"pan.  Trying an 8" or smaller next time.  Caramel filling (bought the premade can) very shallow.  Used one large banana.  Maybe part of the reason so low (yeah, it is).  I don't think it needs more caramel.  Wondering if I could "toss" two large or three smaller ones in the caramel, then spread.  Couldn't easily spread on bananas, which I sliced & quartered.  Seemed like too much whipped cream.  Tried that two ways:  3/4c w/ 1T confec & 1/2t vanilla.  Good, but too sweet for the caramel base.  Second: 3/4c w/ 1/4t instant coffee & 1/2t confec sugar.  By itself, needs more sugar - at least a little.  On the pie, perfect.  I also melted two bittersweet chocolate squares & spread that on the crust before filling.  My recipe: 1 1/4c crumbs, 1/3c margarine, 2T sugar.  Use margarine if chilling, not baking.  Butter sticks to the pan.  Either is fine if you bake it first.  Mmmm.  'Thinking I may make the graham crust, sprinkle w/ mini choc chips; then bake it; then spread the chips that will be softened.  The square wasn't a problem, just thinking chips may be easier to have it be more even.  Oh, I chilled the bananas before slicing & again after filling the pie - before the whipped cream.  Top w/ dark chocolate shavings.
Note4Me: graham cracker crumbs.  See Leeky Bee review/recipe.  Try coffee flavored whipped cream (may be leeky bee).  Chill or ba

Not impressed....for one, covering half the can in boiling water for 3 hours resulted in like others, half dark creme half light creme, and thicker lumpier on the bottom, I had to put it in the mixer to mix or blend out the lumps for a smoother consistancy. I will remember to submerge the whole thing next time, however, I feel it needed a drop or two of vanilla. Now, I used a chocolate pie crust because I didn't have graham cracker crumbs on hand like I thought...go figure. I ended up having to use 6 bananas because there was SO much creme. And I placed it in the freezer for a bit so that it could thicken some, so I could whip the topping. My kids loved it, because it was a sweet treat for them, however I didn't like it at all, When cutting the pie, it oozed out (more or less, exploded out) everywhere that before I could get a good photo of it, it was all over the place, best served in a bowl and not on a plate. I'm sorry, to me it still tasted like milky sugar, not a caramel after 3 hours. I'm driven now to find a solution to make a good or better pie with a better result, then a liquid mess. My apologies. I won't be making this recipe again.

Tried this for the first time, belatedly read about putting can on side so for the last 15minutes I turned it to the side and rotated a couple of times. Worked wonderful! Was careful opening can (a no brainer!) then before it cooled I mixed the ingredients from the bottom, just held can with potholder and stirred it up good. Made for lady's at Bunko, celebrating Cinco De Mayo, never had pie before and it was enjoyed by all! Great and easy recipe just got to use the brain a little!

This pie was a huge hit! I followed what some of the reviewers said and I fully submerged the condensed milk and it turned out great. Will definitely make again! Oh, and this pie is VERY sweet so you can only eat a slither.

Absolutely divine! I used a ready made pie crust and boiled the milk for 2 and 1/2 hours on its side. My family couldn't wait to dig into it, so it sat in the fridge for only about 20 minutes. I would def. serve this to any company! Thanx for a great recipe! :)

My boyfriend and I have nicknamed this dessert "death pie," as it is so clearly unhealthy and decedent. That said, we loved it. We live in Chile where dulce de leche is called majar and there are whole supermarket shelves dedicated to selling it ready made. Since graham crackers are hard to come by here, I used an oatmeal cookie crust which I HIGHLY recommend. It gave a great texture to pie.

I was short on time so I took a short cut and bought the dulce de leche in a jar instead of making it myself with the milk.  I found the pie to be too sweet.

We used to eat this pie on special Sundays when I was growing up. So glad to find an easy recipe! Delicious. My only changes from the original recipe were to submerge the can in water and not use quite so many bananas. Otherwise, I followed it to the letter and it came out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I originally found this recipe about 2 thanksgivings ago (we were having a thanksgiving Mexican party at work since you get so much turkey) and have made it regularly ever since.  BIG NOTES: I have never had a problem with my condensed milk because I cook FULLY submerged and turn the can every time I add water.  Also, I noticed the crust will slide down and then it ends up really small so I do the crust with 1.5 cups graham crackers and 3/4 c butter and build it up super high along the sides.  And make sure it sets! I was in a time crunch once and threw it together and got in the car and it slid everywhere. Definitely needs to set in the refrigerator for a little while.

Very tasty, but extremely rich, of course! I used a pre-made crust and a jar of dulce de leche spread. Yum!  It made the perfect ending to my Cinco de Mayo dinner.

Ok, I guess.  It's very sweet, which why wouldn't it be, it's a pie!!!  The process of boiling for 3 hours though?!  Don't recommend this recipe for summer weather.  It makes the house really hot!  The energy it uses to boil, then keep the house cool with the air conditioning, then the waiting for 3 long hours is silly.  Just go buy a can in the mexican isle of your grocery store for heavens sake.  Over all, the recipe is pretty good.  If the condensed milk does not come out just the right consistancy, it WILL be runny the next day.  I promise!  But hey, that's why they invented spoons, right?  Oh-and use a nice pastry crust that you've prebaked and cooled.  It is much better than graham.

I can't believe how easy it is to make caramel!  Nexy time, I would make two cans, instead of one because it really is the best part.  I boiled the can on its side on the low setting of an electric hot pot and it turned out perfect.

Fantastic recipe, and so easy to make. Admittedly it does take a little while to cook the caramel, but it is so worth it. As other reviewers have suggested, using ready made caramel makes cooking this pie a breeze. The only thing I have altered is the crust, I don't like biscuit crusts so I cut up a sponge cake and lined a pie dish with it.  Works a treat!  Will definitely make again.

Love how easy it was, but not a fan of the fact that the carmel ended up overflowing.  Perhaps I just overmeasured, but it still was a problem.

This was just okay. It was very runny and VERY sweet. Too sweet. I did boil the can for 3 hours and it was completely covered with water the whole time. I will not make this agian.

I made a big mistake of not reading the reviews before I made this.  I followed the directions as written and boiled the water only halfway up for the three hours....  I ended up with a gooey, yummy mess instead of pie.  Next time I make it I will completely cover the can with water or save my time and buy the pre-made dulce de leche.  I had a yummy pudding instead of a pie.  I turned it out of the pie pan and put it into pudding cups.  No one but me knew the difference that it was supposed to be pie.  Flavor wise it was a 5 star...  pie wise it was a 1 star  considering I ended up with pudding.

This is a Banoffee Pie, one of the most delicious pies ever created. It is NOT Mexican in the slightest, but British. No matter, because it is absolutely delicious. I have never made my own dulce de leche in this way because I have always been afraid that the can would explode, but it's easy enough, if tedious, to make it in the microwave: put the contents of the can of sweetened condensed milk in a glass bowl and microwave at high for 30 seconds at time, stirring after every interval.  It will take quite a while until you get dulce de leche, like maybe 45 minutes, but it's safer.  You have to stir vigorously to avoid lumps, but if you get some anyway, use an immersion blender to break them up.  Or, buy it in a jar.  Since the process of turning SCM into DDL is simply a chemical one, requiring no creativity on the part of the cook, there is no shame in letting someone else do the work for you.  (True, a jar of DDL costs about $8.00 here in New York, and a can of SCM costs about $2.00, but your time and electricity or gas cost something too. Just buy it.)

Dulce de Leche can be made MUCH EASIER by pouring the condensed milk into clean Mason jars, and then putting them in a crockpot filled with water and let them simmer overnight.   Same amazing caramel sauce...no BPAs leeched   into your sauce, no exploding cans, no babysitting a sauce pot for 3 hours.  Other than that ...this is a great recipe for banoffee pie!

The only change I made was to add  a 1/2 cup more of graham cracker crumbs, as one cup hardly covered the bottom of the pie plate.

Other than that, I followed the directions exactly as it stated in the recipe. Excellent dessert. I will definitely be making  it again.

Great pie, everyone loved it.   Like others I too had a problem with the crust.  Too much butter wouldn't let the crust get cruchy and it slid down.  I found another recipe with a graham cracker crust and followed it,  I used a 1/4 cup of butter instead of the half cup this recipe suggested and it came out perfectly.  Will try the precooked caramel next time as well.

This pie was DELICIOUS.  I did cheat and use Nestle Dulce de Leche rather than boiling for 3 hours, and I used 2 14oz. cans rather than 1, but the taste of the caramel with the ripe bananas and the homemade whipped topping all together was incredible.  I made it for a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  Will definitely be making this again.

I didn't realize how many friends I have that don't care for bananas.  So, I chopped up macoun apples, tossed with lemon juice and layered the chopped apples in place of the banana. Nothing left over. Perfect fall dessert.  Went over big when made in individual glasses.

I made this pie over the weekend for a "Fiesta" themed party, and I couldn't wait to make it again so I am making it tonight for a friend's birthday!
Just a few notes.
After reading the comments before I made this pie, I decided to double the caramel, which was definitely the way to go.  
Also, since I was doubling the caramel, I decided to follow one of the reviewer's advice and made more of the "crust".  As another reviewer mentioned, the graham cracker mixture just slid down and forms a layer instead of a pie crust. Also, the butter was bubbling, and the pie crust was still very "wet".  I decided to try to re-shape it into a pie crust and put it in the over again to see if that would solve the problem, but all it did was make it darker.
I threw that away and started over, but this time I used the recommended amount of butter (1/2 cup) and slightly more graham cracker crumbs.  This turned out much better!
For the caramel, again I listened to the other reviews and I filled a large pot with water, totally covering the 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk, which I placed on their sides.  I boiled it for the three hours, adding water as it evaporated to keep the cans completely covered, and turned them every half hour or so.   The caramel came out perfect!
I layered 1 can of caramel, a layer of bananas, and repeated.  I put that in the refrigerator for about 3 hours.   Then I covered the entire pie with a layer of whipped cream. (Sorry but I used Cool Whip because I didn't have t

Such an awesome delectable pie! You can substitute bananas withe cherry pie filling then garnish the firm peaks of whipping cream (placing it in over long enough to lightly brown the peaks) with marachino cherries. What a Delightful twist to cherry pie!! I spice up my cherry filling with 2 tbls brown sugar, 1/tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 capful of vanilla flavoring. Great Banana cream Dulce de leche pie recipe!  Should try the cherry dulche de leche pie too. 
P.s., you should of totally submerged the can & turn it end over end every 1 hr then roll it side to other side every 1/2 an hr. Then it all gets cooked to caramelization, lol

This is an excellent pie although I cheated - just buy a graham cracker crust.  Also, in the mexican food section in the store you can get a can of the carmel.  I sat the can into hot water for awhile just to soften abit before pouring over the bananas.  Put in refrigerator for at least an hour.  Added the Cool whip before serving and what a treat this is.  Everyone loved it.  So simple to make

Five stars because it was unexpectedly good. This actually came out fantastic. It IS super sweet but it is supposed to be. After reading over comments, I made sure to lay the can on it's side and turn it often (every time I added water). I didn't want to waste a pie crust so I followed the directions on the box for the crust, minus the sugar as the pie is so sweet already. This time I happened to have a tub of Cool Whip and it came in handy because I was in a rush to start cooking dinner by that time. Next time I shall give the self-made whipped topping a try. I was skeptical about serving this with dinner because my husband doesn't dig sweets all that much, but surprisingly he really loved the caramel. Yummmy!
