Sorry, my family didn't like this recipe very much.  We were expecting it to taste a lot like the stuff you buy at the store and it just seemed to be missing something.

hmm i did not like the taste of this eggnog for drinking, but it worked fine for my eggnog spice cake luckily. it tasted like milk that had been sitting out too long  and i could also taste the flour in it.

I thought this was a great recipie. I made it for a holiday, bring something to lunch, we had at work. 
 It was well liked by all. Too bad I wasn't allowed to add rum. But it was still a success.

I just made this.  I agree with the other reader, it does not tell you when to put the vanilla in so I just added it to the milk flour sugar mixture as it was cooking along with cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.  After cooking milk mixture, I took it off the heat to cool, doesn't say how long to let it cool before you add the beaten whites, I added them when it was still hot and they don't FOLD in at all, I ended up beating them in with whisk.  Has great flavor and I will probably make again.

This recipe has saved my holidays!  I've become severely allergic to milk this year, and soy products make me gag, so I though I was going to have to begin braving the autumn through winter without one of my favorite things in the world...To make a long story shorter, I used "Almond milk" and with a little bit of rum extract added this recipe hit the spot perfectly!

I've made this recipe at least 3 times now, and it was good every time I followed the instructions. Getting the flour to dissolve enough, and waiting for the milk to cool is important. I like this recipe because I already have all the ingredients it calls for, and isn't alcoholic.

i didn't like the initial turnout, however, i added another 1/2c white sugar, and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. (will add vanilla bean ice cream after it cools) already has improved taste.... more of the store quality.

This was not the best egg nog I have ever made but it was alright.  I do think the instructions could be a little more clear.  I waited for the mixture to cool before I folded in the egg whites, I also upped the spices per our liking.

This is really rich and delicious.  Add 1.5 tsp. of vanilla for perfection.  Makes about 3 quarts of eggnog.

Excellent recipe. Great way to use up extra milk.  Directions don't say when to add the vanilla.  Almost left it out.  Thanks for posting!
