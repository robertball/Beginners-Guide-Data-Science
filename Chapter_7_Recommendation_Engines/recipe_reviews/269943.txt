This was surprisingly tasty! I made the recipe exactly as written. I would have liked more riced cauliflower in it though, considering it is a "fried rice" dish. Next time I would double the cauliflower.  There's some ingredients here that I wouldn't have thought to put together, but it works!

Really good. I made it with turkey sausage and used the little mini multi colored peppers. Was not sure about the cauliflower rice. It was a hit and will be a return recipe soon. So easy and quick!

Pretty much made as written...
But...I didn't have  sesame oil, so cooking I used olive oil & for the sauce I used some sesame dressing with the other ingredients & I used a sweet & hot smoked sausage also added yellow & orange peppers...
Flavors were AMAZING!
We will definitely make again

Very good! I did saute diced. Onion and garlic. I also added frozen peas and carrots when browning the cauliflower. A good way to sneak veggies in for the kids!

This was good. I used a full head of cauliflower which I put through the food processor.  I also added a chopped onion.   I did not add the sugar.  I did fry the egg in the sesame oil and I added ginger and black pepper to the cauliflower. The full cauliflower gave us 5 large portions.  Subbed HF turkey kielbasa.

I too thought there wasn't enough cauliflower rice so I doubled it. Next time I will add an extra egg and some chopped onions. Easy and quick recipe.

I adapted the recipe for our paleo lifestyle. I cooked in coconut oil. I used fresh cauliflower, coconut aminos and instead of sugar I used honey. When I was browning the cauliflower I added fresh garlic and mixed in some coconut aminos.  It was so delicious.  Your recipe is simple and very easy to follow. Thank you.

I used rice instead of cauliflower rice (my husband doesn't like it) and this a was wonderful change of pace way to use link sausage.  When I make friend rice I find it all works well in a large electric skillet.  There's enough room to move things around without needing extra plates or bowls.  The egg can be cooked and stirred rather than having to cut in strips, but that's just my preference.  I love recipes like this as you can generally add items you prefer, or have on hand.  I shared this recipe with a  neighbor who can't eat pineapple and says she often substitutes mandarin oranges.

Taste great and easy to make. I added onion and chili sauce to mine. I used some spicy chicken sausage I already had at home. I’ll definitely make this again.
