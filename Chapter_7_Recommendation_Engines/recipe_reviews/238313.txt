Simply outstanding!  A couple recommendations:  (1) make it from dried beans so that you can get the perfect al-dente texture (canned is often too mushy for my liking); and (2) add dill in addition to the mint. It results in the ultimate fresh taste. Enjoy!!

I just made this recipe and it is a good basic bean salad recipe that I experienced in Turkey.  I followed the recipe for much of the ingredients however I made these changes:  I didn't have Fava beans so I drained and rinsed Chickpeas. I added red quinoa for more protein (I cooked this in bouillion,so careful on the salt).  I added chopped red onion, cumin and parsley.  Taste for your comfort.  Refrigerate to blend seasonings.

Had fresh beans and can garbanzos. Added fresh oregano because it was growing next to mint. It was delicious, fresh and simple

Such a nice side dish change in my rotation and the mint adds such a fresh twist. I only had canned butter beans but with a good rinse they did the job. Delicious!

Superb salad with fresh favas and canned butter beans. Simple, quick, hearty and flavors blended deliciously next day. Can't recommend highly enough.

Solid recipe.  

Rather than adding raw garlic, I roasted the garlic and minced it.  I heated a couple small cloves with the skin still on in a small pan over medium heat for 6 minutes until the garlic was slightly colored and soft.  

I added about 1/2 tsp salt, but it wasn't enough.  Unfortunately, I brought this salad to a picnic, so I couldn't adjust the seasoning later.  

I would make this again - trying different herbs  This time I made it with mint.
