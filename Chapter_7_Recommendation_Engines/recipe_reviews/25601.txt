this cake is very refreshing and very tasty. I have made this recipe twice now and i do prefer it with a little less mixed fruit peel, but i will still give it a four on rating

I found I had to alter my Flour measure ( I think due to metric conversion) however, I have made this time and time again with excellent reviews all round. Thanks for a great low fat cake!!

I added a whole cup of flour, and salt like one reviewer said, but it still turned out flat.
