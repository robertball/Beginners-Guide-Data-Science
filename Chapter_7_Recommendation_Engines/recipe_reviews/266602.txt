This was good. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find harissa so I used Sambal Olek instead. The resulting dressing was not as spicy as I’d hoped, but the recipe should not be blamed for my substitution. I also stirred in some arugula for extra interest, which I think was a good addition. The pan-fried halloumi was delicious!
