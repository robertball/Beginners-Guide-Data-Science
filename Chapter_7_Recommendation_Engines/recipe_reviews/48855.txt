I love salmon almost any way it's made, I DID NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL! my husband found this recipe and he was finally ready to try salmon based on what the reviews stated. I was thrilled hoping he'd finally try and like salmon.  He took one little bite and wouldn't eat anymore. I took a bite and understood why.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and we didn't eat it. I wrapped it up hoping to try to somehow fix all that expensive salmon so I can even eat it. I'm not sure if it was th combination of flavors but it DID taste fishy to me. Maybe the tomatoe sauce and ginger root? Think about it..tomato sauce and ginger root? I know  alot of people like this recipe, that's why I was so surprised. This is my first negative review. I would try a basic teriyaki marinade over this one. I use pineapple juice, soy sauce, brown surgar and garlic. Much better than this one and much easier to make. Sorry about the negative review.

Wonderful! The flavours from this recipe blend so well together and go with just about anything.  I've made it now with Salmon, Chicken, and even Tofu and it's perfect every time.  The only changes I made were to use orange or mandarin marmalade instead of OJ concentrate, leave out the tomato sauce entirely, I use normal white onions in the sauce instead of green (and I put the ginger and garlic through a garlic press to help the flavours blend), and only use 1 tsp of olive oil in the sauce (more is not really needed and only adds additional fat/calories). I cook on my stovetop in a frying pan, using the sauce instead of oil to cook it with.  I remove the [salmon, chicken, or tofu] then cook a chopped onion, chopped red bell pepper, and 3 cups of baby spinach leaves with the remaining marinade and serve it together with rice.  PERFECT! Will continue to make again and again.

This is my absolute favorite salmon dish. The only changes I made were to omit the tomato sauce (the first time I made it, I used the tomato sauce, the second time, I didn't use it, and I didn't notice a difference) and to use regular OJ rather than concentrated OJ. This dish is terrific with brown rice pilaf and green beans. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the BEST salmon I have ever eaten.  It was so incredibly moist.  I made some very minor changes. I used salmon filet instead of steaks and grilled it on the Foreman for 5 mins.  I used low sodium soy sauce, fresh orange juice (doubled)and sesame oil instead of veggie.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!!

My son had us over last week and grilled these on cedar planks.  The smell alone was worth it!  But then...we ate some!!! I can't remember having any better tasting salmon and we eat salmon a lot! He said the only change he made was that he eliminated the tomato sauce. He grilled asparagus also--yummy dinner that we appreciated with several of our senses!!!

The best salmon ever!! My boyfriend said it was the best salmon i've ever made and gave it an A+!! I did add more garlic and broiled it in the oven for 8 min, then covered in foil and baked at 450 for 15 min. It came out moist and delicious!

Super good.  I changed one small thing and added a smidge of sesame oil to the marinade.  Next time I'll serve it with a lemon wedge or orange wedge on the plate for an extra bit of tang.  My husband said that he really hopes I make this again!

THIS WAS GREAT!! I USED OJ INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATE AND MARINATED IT FOR 2 HOURS. I MADE THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AS A LATE NIGHT TREAT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR A MISSION (USAF), HE ACTUALLY GOT UP FORM EATING TO TELL ME IT WAS THE BEST SALMON HE HAD EVER HAD.

WOW!  This is a phenomenal dish!!  It was so good.  Dh and I just couldn't get over how wonderful it tasted.  This is the best salmon I've ever had.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used OJ instead of the concentrate.  It was so yummy.  We had grilled corn, potato salad, and fresh canteloupe with it.  I can't wait to make this again!  The mix of ingredients sounds odd, but it really works well together.  Try it!

I did not care for this recipe. It might be better with low-sodium soy sauce, but I'm not going to bother to try.

This is my favorite marinade recipe.  I have used it with salmon, various kinds of white fish, chicken, hot dogs, beef--you name it--and it has been outstanding on every single one of them.  I typically triple or quadruple the recipe, add it to a variety of meats, and then freeze them until I'm ready to use them.  I've served this to company a number of times and received rave reviews every time.

Thanks for the recipe, KEVIN.  Tastes like something my friend KERRY used to make.  In fact, it is the exact same recipe.  Imagine that.  Wonderful, wonderful flavor.  Highly recommended!  Use FRESH ginger!  KF

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  AS SOME HAVE POINTED OUT; SALMON CAN BE OVERWHELMING ESPECIALLY IF ONE DOESN'T PARTICULARLY LIKE STRONG FISH.  YET IS SO HEALTHFUL.  THEREFORE, I TRY TO EAT IT WHENEVER I CAN.  ANYWAY A FRIEND PREPARED THIS EXACTLY AS WRITTEN AS FAR AS I KNOW WITH SKIN ON CHARRING IT ON THE GRILLE JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT.  IT WAS SO GOOD BECAUSE I COULD NOT TASTE ANY OF THE INDIVIDUAL INGREDIENTS, ONLY THE WONDERFUL FLAVOR OF THE DISH ITSELF.  COOK SAID HE SPLASHED SOME SAKE ON IT AT THE END.  I COULD EAT SALMON PREPARED THIS WAY ANYTIME.

Relatively simple and even impressed the non-salmon likers in the family.  I substituted equal parts spaghetti sauce for tomato and ginger powder for the root.

Wonderful!  I’ve never made salmon before and this was great.  I used the regular o.j. and made a few other substitutions and it was still good!  Next time I will be sure to have the real ingredients on hand.  I don’t grill so I PAN SEARED in a small amount of oil, skin side down for 5 min on med-high heat then flipped for another 5 min.  My fillets were very thick so I ended up throwing them in the microwave for another minute to get the center.  Notes on the marinade / sauce, I pureed it before marinating and I made the full amount for two fillets and it would be perfect for four fillets. Happy cooking!

Delicious! I used orange juice rather than concentrate and doubled it, and also used sesame oil instead of vegetable. It's too cold for outdoor grilling, so I broiled the salmon for about 5-6 minutes per side. Served it with sweet potatoes, salad with candied walnuts and orange vinaigrette, and pineapple-ginger soda. This really is an amazing recipe.

This is absolutely wonderful! My husband and I eat salmon at least once a week, so sometimes it gets a bit bland. But this was bursting with flavor, and we were pleasantly surprised!!! If you like salmon, you'll love this!

I really enjoyed the unique flavor of this marinade.  The lower amount of time necessary to have it soaking in the marinade is also a plus since I didn't have to worry about preparing it hours in advance.

This is my favorite salmon recipe.  I've made this many times, exactly as given, and grilled the steaks over charcoal.  Because it's a bit laborious, and we like to eat salmon often, I double the recipe and put it in a salad dressing bottle and refrigerate for up to a week or two.

So, I had to tweak the recipe a tad only because I had orange juice(Tropicana), tomato marinara sauce, and no green onions, nor ginger. Everything else I had. I placed half an onion, 3 cloves of garlic, the orange juice, the marinara sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil and vegetable oil all into a blender. Then I heated in a sauce pan for about 5 mins. Basted the salmon steaks with this sauce, and cooked in oven at 375degrees for about 20mins. Came out moist and tasty!! Especially for not having all the ingredients. Husband raved! Thank you!

This recipe was very good. I live in Alaska and am always trying to find new ways to cook all the salmon we catch during the summer. I found that next time I would cook it on a slightly lower temperature on my grill just cuz it burned the skin of the salmon. Also, maybe next time I will place foil down first because the salmon stuck to the grate. I saw someones comment that it was fishy...salmon often is haha. I found this recipe to dull the fishy taste. Thanks again ^_^

This salmon was excellent! I used fresh squeezed orange juice and omitted the tomato sauce as suggested by other reviewers.

This tasted delicious and I'm not a huge salmon fan. We marinated it for 3 or 4 hours and had grilled corn and baked potato wedges on the side.

Excellent flavor.  Next time I would make more of the marinade so I can more to dip my fish into.

Personally, I baked mine at 350 for 30+ minutes.

Wow!  This was amazing.  I didn't have any onions, completely forgot about the vegetable oil and did everything by eyeball instead of measuring and it was still fantastic.  I pan-fried the fish which let the soy sauce brown to bring out the natural sweetness.  I can't wait to make it again!

Pretty good, pretty good. Pudgy hubby was not available for comment, but Anoose thought it was pleasant.  Use fresh orange juice and extra ginger, garlic, and white onion as usual. As usual.  Served with brown rice and cauliflower.  Must try w/ low sodium soy sauce next time, next time.  Also, Anoose was dissapointed that there wasn't much discernible orange flavor -- too bad, too bad.  Would make again only with a few modifications.

I love this recipe! I only made one change that some other reviews suggested--used sesame seed oil instead of veg oil. I had already started to marinate it when some other dinner plans came up, so the salmon ended up marinating for a day. I thought it was going to be awful, but it was the best salmon I have ever eaten! I highly recommend this!!

I made this for my boyfriend and his family while I was in Georgia.  I was a little worried since I was extremely inexperienced with both grilling and salmon.  It turned out so good, that my boyfriend's father was on the phone for the next few days telling everyone about what a great cook I am.  Win!

I've been making this recipe for three years now, and almost every single time it turns out perfectly! It is the easiest and most flavorful salmon recipe out there.   I half the soy sauce and use low sodium soy sauce, usually replace the orange concentrate with 1/3 cup of orange juice (don't have concentrate on hand), and instead of grilling I just cook it in a pan on the stove top.

im not a big salmon lover but after this recipe i'm willing to give it another chance. When i made the marinade i left out the tomato sauce like many others and i didnt have any ginger so i left that out also, but overall it was nice, maybe a bit overpowering, (might use a bit less soy sauce next time) my partner loved it and wants me to make it for all our friends!!

My husband and I got married Jan. 3, 2009, and I never cooked before I got married.  This was very easy and I had all the ingredients all ready at home.  Both of us give it a 5 out of 5!  I added two things: garlic powder and ground cinnamon.  WONDERFUL!  THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!  TJ

This is the only salmon recipe my no-fish eating family likes.  It is soooo amazing. I double the sauce amount and it gets used. Oh and I skip the tomato sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

The best marinade yet, my husband said. I used regualr OJ but will def use the concentrate next time b/c I think it would be sweeter and cut some of the soy's saltiness. It was so good!

Very good, a little too sweet for me but I think that was because of the brand of soy sauce I used. My husband and kids loved it. Would make again w/a different soy and w/less oil.

Excellent!!  Followed recipe with to taste quantities.  I added a little more ginger and others ingredients knowing who I was serving.  We BBQ'ed them on a cedar plank which put this recipe over the top.  I served it with Skewered Grilled Potatoes also found on All Recipes.  Very nice dish.

Excellent.  Didn't have green onions or ginger, and used fresh orange juice, not concentrate and then broiled the salmon, occasionally basting with the thickened sauce.  My daughter (who doesn't eat anything that doesn't start with a "Mc") just loved it!  So this recipe will be a repeat in our house, for sure.

Marinade was good, not fantastic.  We are trying to get as much grilling in as possible before the cold weather comes.  Salmon is always tasty off the grill.

The whole family enjoyed this salmon. Flavorful enough to satisfy the adults and mild enough for the 3 year old. I broiled instead of grilling due to time constraints. Still very tasty.

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever tried and makes fish lovers out of fish haters. It is better than any salmon we've eaten in the most expensive restaurants with Big Name Chefs! I make it with filets bought at Costco, omit the tomato sauce, and marinade in gallon baggies from 2-6 hours. My standard impress the guest menu is this salmon, sesame green beans, rice pilaf and bananas foster. Easy and devine!

We love this recipe.  My kids gobbled it up and asked me to make it again the next day.  I also use regular orange juice instead of concentrate.  It's a personal preference for a less sweet taste.

This recipe was great. I let the salmon marinade for about and hour and a half. It came out moist and flavorful. Everyone loved it and several asked for the recipe. I set some of the boiled marinade aside so everyone could spoon it over if they wanted. I made this with fried rice and chinese green beans.

The marinade is just right as it doesn't over power the taste of the fish. I put my salmon steaks in a grill basket and did these suckers proud!

I followed the marinade recipe exactly, but used salmon fillets instead of steaks. It was amazing and I have to openly admit to not being a lover of salmon as a general rule.  I served it with an orange garnish over a bed of mixed greens w/ a sesame seed dressing and broccolitini spears.  My friend, who is a salmon lover, raved about this recipe!

This dish was GREAT! Easy to make and great tasting. My Husband said it was the best at home fish he had ever tasted. I agreed and I can't wait to make it again soon. (Too bad salmon is so expensive these days!)

I loved it!!! I used V8 juice instead of tomato sauce,salmon filet instead of steak and a regular onion instead of green. I also baked it in the oven instead of BBQ. It turned out amazingly good! Thank you sooo much for sharing it, I will definitely make it again inshallah!

Wonderful flavor!  I broiled instead of BBQ'd it and we loved it.  I'm not too sure that the tomato sauce adds a lot to it though  ...  I will try next time with out.

An unbelievable great taste!  My kids couldn't get enough of it and they are not fish eaters.  I'm sure the sodium count is higher than I like, due to the soy sauce, but I would definitely make this again often.

this is a great flavorful recipie! I didn't have the time to grill so I broiled in the oven instead, and it still turned out very nice. This goes great with uncle ben's rice and steamed fresh green beans.

OMG!  This is my FAVORITE grill recipe ever!  I am on Weight Watchers and have been eating fish for dinner almost every night.  It sounds like a sickness, but I have been eating salmon 2-3 nights a week because I love this recipe so much.  With a big pile of grilled veggies and a small glass of wine, I am in heaven.  Serving this for Father's Day, too!  Thanks, Kevin!

This is a GREAT recipe I use my pestal and morter to crush up the garlic and ginger to ensure the flavours get mixed well. Cedar plank these on the BBQ and you'll be a hit at your next get together! ( just a thought, yes it tastes like fish, that's because it is)

Excellent. Omitted the tomato sauce at the suggestion of other reviewers, and it tasted delicious. EDIT: I made this again but I couldn't grill it (long story) and I have an aversion to broiling (you can guess) so I baked it in a covered 8x8 baking dish without the marinade for 25 minutes. I boiled the marinade for a few minutes and then added about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed with a fourth of a cup of cold water to thicken it up. I then poured the "sauce" over the served up salmon. The glaze wasn't as good as it was grilled, but I thought yall should know.

I used frozen salmon for this dish.  What a mistake!  I'm used to fresh, and this was a big disappointment.  Also, I don't have a grill, so I used a broiler.  I ended up cooking the fish way too long and the texture was like leather.  That said, this was completely my fault, as the taste of the marinade was really good.  Personally I may use a pinch of sugar next time, because the combination of the OJ and lemon juice made it slightly tart.  I will definitely try this one again with better salmon.

Excellent!  The marinade gave great flavor to the salmon.  The only difference I made was to use filets instead of salmon steaks out of personal preference.  We will be making this recipe again and again.

Delicious!  I had to substitute OJ concentrate for just regular OJ, and instead of tomato sauce I used V8 since that is what I had on hand.  Next time I think I'll use a filet b/c we didn't like dealing with bones in the steak.

My family loved this recipe!  I chose to bake the salmon and it turned out really good.  I would recommend less soy sauce.  The ginger and garlic flavors stood out and made the dish very "gourmet".  I chopped up beefsteak tomatoes and added some of the left over sauce into another bowl and you could choose to garnish over white rice.  This would be a great dinner entree and potluck dish to make.  Thank you for helping me in the kitchen =)

It's high time I write a review for this recipe, because it's become our favorite way to eat salmon.  I don't make any changes, and it turns out scrumptious every time.  I especially love the fact that it doesn't have sugar in the marinade, and for those of us who are watching our carbs, that's a big bonus!!

I thought this was a very good recipe. The salmon turned out delicious. The only alteration I will make next time is using less soy sauce, which was really the only flavor that came through. I also substituted regular OJ for the concentrate and couldn't taste it at all, so maybe that was my mistake. I think I will take the suggestion of adding a little brown sugar as well.

Two of my kids really loved it, the other two did not, so I guess taste is really personal. 5 stars because the two kids that liked it said it was really good. Thank you for posting.

I loved this recipe!  A lot of marinades don't flavor salmon very well, but this one does a great job...  You can still taste the salmon, but it has a wonderful flavor added to it.

This was great and very easy. My only changes were substituting orange juice for the concentrate and chili oil for the tomato sauce. Next time will let it marinate a little longer since my fish was thick.

Made this again tonight.  It's still fantastic.  Have had it for dinner parties and everyone wants the recipe.  If it doesn't taste right, check the quality of the salmon not the recipe.  I am now a salmon eater.  Even the neighbors want to know whats on the grill is smelled so fantistic.  Thanks again Kevin.

We omitted the tomato sauce from the marinade.  I let the fillets marinade overnight.  Where the marinade fully "soaked" in, these were phenomenal!  Where the fillets were thicker, the marinade was less noticeable but still good.    I plan to keep this recipe for future grilled salmon evenings.

I love this recipe. I marinated the salmon 1 day and just ate it. it's really my taste. i modified it a little bit: add chili sauce, more garlic pulver and used sweet densed soya sauce. I'm going to make this for my husband when he is coming back in next weekend. thanks for the recipe.

Decided to fallow with the recipe even tho there was some negative feed back about it. I did add a little bit more lemon juice and also used a fresh orange for the juice. as I was about to cook the salmon I sprinkled brown sugar on both sides and did the same when turning the salmon. sauteed unions till translucent and then added spinach with salt and pepper. served under the salmon with jasmine rice on the side. was amazing!

Maybe it was just the brand I used but the only flavor that really came out was the soy sauce. Still not bad but will try again reducing the amount.

An amazing recipe - definitely my favorite way to eat salmon.  I do this a little bit differently though, here is what I've changed:
1) I prefer to use olive oil instead of vegetable and I skip the extra 1 TBSP at the end on the grill - not necessary.
2) I like to add an extra 1/2 TSP of grainy dijon as well.
3) The recipe works out much better with a good real brewed soya sauce - Kikkoman is ideal.
4) If you have fresh garden chives they substitue well for the green onion...and a bit of extra won't hurt either.
5) Now, the most important change is that instead of using salmon steaks I use a whole side of salmon, the trick is to cook the fish skin side down for about 5 to 10 minutes, then use the spatulla to carefully remove the fish from the skin and flip back onto the skin that is still on the barbecue, add the marinade and cook for 5 to 10 more minutes.  It is almost impossible to burn when cooking it on the skin.  With a large fish the flip can be tricky and sometimes requires 2 spatullas but it will work and is well worth it!!!

Great recipe, used orange juice rather than concentrate and steak sauce for the tomato sauce.  Also barbecued with alder chips and it was moist and delicious.  Heated marinade to serve over fried rice.  Will make again this weekend for company it was so good.

My family loves salmon and so I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it.  I've tried different marinades that I put together myself but this one is awesome.  I too used regular no pulp orange juice - which is one substitution that won't change the outcome.  Family loved it!

This is my official salmon recipe--it's so good.  I marinated the salmon for three hours.  Then I plank grilled it (yum!).  Since it was a weeknight, I served it with veggie egg rolls and rice.  My husband will never take me out to eat again, I think!

This is by far the best salmon marinade I've had.  We made it two nights in a row!  Followed the recipe to a T, but marinated it for about 4 hours.  After boiling the remainder of the marinade, we spooned it over the top and it was fantastic.  It even tasted great on the mashed potatoes.

This was a good salmon recipe.  I used fresh squeezed orange juice, that was what I had on hand, and added more ginger than the recipe calls for and threw in some garlic chili sauce.  The whole family loved it, including my father-in-law.

I loved this salmon recipe.  I did not have fresh ginger on hand, so I used powdered: It worked well (use less of it though).  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was excellent.  I used this on fresh pink salmon that I had cut into steaks.  I marinated overnight.  It was very good.

Only thing I did differently was cook it in a pan on the stove rather than grill it, and that's only because it was pouring outside! Other than that, this is as tasty a recipe as can be.  Hubby and I loved it! Very flavorful, and not sweet like some salmon recipes.  Thanks!

We prepared this recipe as directed with the exception of the tomato sauce which we skipped as suggested by several reviewers.  I planked it on cedar on the grill. I'm not a big salmon person and my wife is.  We both thought this was an AWESOME blend of flavors.  We complemented it with grilled asparagus and rice pilaf. This was a high end restaurant quality meal!!

Delicious!  I used fresh squeezed orange juice instead of concentrate, ground ginger since I didn't have fresh, skipped the tomato sauce, substituted sesame oil for some of the vegetable oil, & added more garlic & green onion.  We prefer Steelhead over Salmon.  Broiled the fish in the sauce...husband said it was the best Steelhead I've made yet.  Excited to try this on other proteins....thank you for a great recipe!

Let me start by saying I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but my husband likes it and I am trying to cook healthier now that our nest is empty.  I made this last night and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! I really can't wait to make it again.  Maybe I do actually like salmon!  I try to stick with the original recipe the first time, but I too made some small changes that probably didn't make much of a difference to the original recipe. I omitted the tomato sauce because I didn't think it was necessary, cut the oil back to one tablespoon, used two cloves of garlic, lots of fresh ginger and green onions (since I had to buy them anyway), and used regular orange juice since I had it.  Very delicious!

I actually baked mine in the oven (450 for around 15 min) this evening due to freezing temperatures outside and it was awesome.

I have this dish several times with several people and everybody has loved it.  This a great tasty salmon dish.  You can even use the marinade over rice.  It comes out nice and tasty.

Make sure to thaw thaw orange concentrate thoroughly.  Otherwise, it won't spread evenly over the fish.

My husband & daughter loved this salmon but I thought that it lacked a little flavor/kick.  I marinated my salmon for about an hour and used orange juice instead of concentrate.
