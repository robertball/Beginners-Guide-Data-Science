I just started to make smoothies for my workouts and this was the first one i chose and it was EXCELLENT!  It wasn't too sweet or bland just right, and putting frozen strawberries and the ice makes it cold and refreshing which adds to the flavor.

Great smoothie! Very fruity, cool, and delicious. I froze my strawberries and banana and cut back the ice to one cup. This was very good for a quick breakfast!

This is a wonderfully fruity drink without all the excess sugars you get in other smoothies. This is probably one of the more healthy drinks I have had in a long time.....and oh sooooo delicious! If you have a sweet tooth, you may have to add a bit of sugar. But "as is" was perfect for my gang.Very creamy too! Thanks Ashley!

Great but I used a bit less OJ for my taste. First time around, the OJ really stood out. Otherwise, it was great.

Excellent recipe.  I love that it has so many different fruits and that it is all natural.  If you use very ripe strawberries and a very ripe banana, you should have no problem with this not being sweet enough.

I loved it and so did my kids. I used Vanilla yogurt, because it was all that I had. I hate yogurt so I was a little skeptical, but it was great!!

This recipe is good.  My Husband and children kept asking for more.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 was because I wanted a sweeter taste.  But the crew loved it. Thank you!  We will continue to use for the summer.

Delicious recipe - on a hot summer day when I refused to make a soup but needed a substitute - this recipe came to the rescue - it's very filling and you can add or subtract flavors and texture i.e more banana for a thicker combo or use blueberry yogurt instead of strawberry mmmmm hmmmm good. This one is definately a keeper

Delicious! I used frozen strawberries (somewhat thawed) and added some vanilla to taste.  HMMMM GOOD!!! I wish I would have bought more strawberries to make some more.  We all drank the first batch up in no time. Thanks Ashley!

Not the best smoothie I've ever made.  Didn't care for the combination of flavors, and the orange juice was particularly strong.  Too much ice -  should cut back by at least half, if not further if using frozen strawberries, which I'd also recommend.

very quick and easy! I used fat free yogurt instead of regular and it came out pretty tasty.  The OJ gives it a nice flavor boost.

I love this idea for a  good cool off smoothie. This is the best I found so far.  I have tried it with blueberries, and since we are abundance of watermelons and canaloups, I have used that too. Great recipe.

Using apple juice instead of orange juice, or going half & half will eliminate the sharp taste of the o.j. and sweeten things up for those who wanted it a little sweeter without adding sugar. I keep a can of frozen concentrate in the freezer and just scoop out what I need for each smoothie. Using very ripe strawberries will also make this much sweeter. I would recommend using a frozen banana (rather than tossing those over ripe uneaten bananas, peel and freeze them) rather than ice, as ice tends to dilute a smoothie. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best (healthy) smoothie I've ever made! I didn't quite have a full cup of OJ left, so I used about 1/2 c which I think was perfect. I used a mix b/w half frozen/half fresh strawberries (trying to use up what I had left) and a frozen day old banana. I also used vanilla yogurt and vanilla whey protein powder. I will be making this every day!

Very tasty. If my strawberries weren't already sweetened I would've had to add a bit of sugar.  Also, I added 1 t vanilla.  Had this for breakfast with Easy Morning Glory Muffins from this site.

Simple to make and tastes great. I only had plain yogurt and had no banana to add.  I added a 1/4 cup of sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

This was a great smoothie. I liked it better after the ice melted.  Maybe next time I'll try a frozen banana and no ice.

Used 8 frozen strawberries, small container of yogurt and left out the bananna and ice (didn't need the ice at all I found).  Very refreshing and very close to my favorite Booster Juice!

This is a really good one! I used frozen strawberries, to cut some sugar I used plain yogurt instead of regular, and added a scoop of protein supplement strawberry flavor.

These are absolutely delicious!  My entire family loves them.  I love that they're made with ingredients that I usually have around the house and that they require no added sugar.

yum!  these are so good and easy to make.  I use frozen fruit and no ice. Plus I use frozen bananas if I don't have fresh.  I'd recommend thawing the frozen banana slightly first.  My daughter and I love these plus it's got all the ingredients that we always have in the fridge or freezer.

Great recipe, this was cold and creamy with a great fruity taste, though you cant' really taste the banana.  I used frozen strawberries, vanilla yogurt, 3/4 c. OJ, a drop of honey and left out the ice completely.  So yummy.

I really enjoy this smoothie. I made it for my husband and now he requests it as often as possible. I often change the flavor of yogurt to get a new and yummy result.  On occasion, I add blueberries or blackberries... still yummy!

I love smoothies!  So healthy, quick, and delicious.  I use a half cup of orange juice, a half cup of mango nectar, one half a very ripe banana frozen in chunks, frozen pineapple tidbits, 4 oz. peach low-fat yogurt, several frozen strawberries, and some frozen raspberries.  I make coconut water ice cubes and use only a couple in this smoothie.  Everything's frozen, so it comes out very cold and icy....almost like a sherbet!  A good smoothie-maker blender makes it perfect.  Using less ice makes it very sweet....adjust the amount of ice the way you like it.

So good! I modified it a bit so it'd be creamier though, and I usually don't like using yogurt in my smoothies, and there was too much ice so I changed it. 
Heres my modified recipe:

1 3/4 cups strawberries, topless and cut in half 

1 cup pulp-free orange juice

1 cup ice cubes *mine are half moon shapes, so if you use square cubes you might have to add more.

2 ripe (browning)bananas 

2 cups of whipped topping, more or less depending on your tastes 

I found that with the whipped topping it was less flat, and the flavor was a bit sweeter and more intense. The yogurt tends to make it heavier and less airy.

This is tasty and refreshing. I used frozen strawberries, necessitating less ice, and giving it more flavor. The only  thing that bothered me was the orange juice which gave it a bit of a sharp, citrus taste. I think I'll stick to milk-based smoothies from now on.
