The soup's consistency is great, nice and hearty although the flavor is very mild. Unfortunately my family learned we don't like all the different mushrooms so I might be leaving out some of the variety next time.

I made this recipe using different mushrooms because that's what I had on hand and needed to use up.  I used shitakes, baby bellas, and chickens of the woods.  I made it vegetarian by using vegetable boullion rather than beef broth.  It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again, perhaps trying other varieties of shrooms.

Never again! I should have realized that four stars with only two reviews told a tale! Our family loves mushrooms and barley so I made a double batch to share with my sister and brother and their families! I still can't figure out how all those flavor- filled ingredients could result in such lackluster flavor. I tried to doctor it up with pink Himalayan salt and fresh ground pepper....nope! Worcestershire sauce.....nope! There was no saving this mushroom soup!

Good enough for company! So many things come out of slow cooker tasting over boiled or tortured, not this time! The barley was toothsome, the mushrooms earthy and lush. I did not have the time to cook for one hour and then remove the portobellos, I cut them into pieces and chucked them in. Hi oh hi ho. Mother-in-law for dinner 8 hours later and this dish made me look like a chef. I will be making this regularly.
