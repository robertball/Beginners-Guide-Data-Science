The cranberry flavor was overpowering. It wasn't bad but it was very strong. Usually I would try to tweak a recipe for next time if it isn't to my taste but not this time. It looked so good on paper!

This is a delicious recipe....but I am very surprised at the nutritional info? What adds all the calories? Is it the oil in the sundried tomatoes. Realistically how much of the sauce will be eaten with the chicken?

This dish had a nice flavor and was quick and easy to make but it was a little too sweet for me. I even used only half the amount of cranberries that the recipe calls for and it was still a bit too sweet. I did enjoy the orange zest and garlic flavors together.

this was.. interesting. i used generic catalina that i needed to use up since its too greasy to use on salads. i just added what i thought was the right amount of sun dried tomatoes.. a whole half cup is almost all my stash. i think this recipe could use some tweaks but i dont think ill have the dressing just sitting in the fridge again..

LOVED it! I only had 3 breasts so only used 1 cup of Catalina. There was plenty of the delicious sauce. I did use whole berry cranberry sauce rather than jellied. served it over rice and when preparing to refrigerate left overs mixed rice in with dish. DELICIOUS left over too. 2nd time I made it i cooked on stove - still delicious.

I wanted to try this for one of the freezer meals I made for my mom to help her out over the holidays. She's allergic to chicken so I used a 3lb pork loin roast and our homemade dressing which is a bit less sweet and more vinegary than a store bought catalina and non oil packed tomatoes since I had them on hand. She just loved this! She said it had a rich savory sauce that was sweet and tangy as well. I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and dill-glazed carrots (also from this site).

We thought this was crazy good!! It seemed to be an odd collection of ingredients but it all came together so well. I did use only 1 cup of dressing but otherwise followed the list. After removing the foil I upped the oven temp to 425-450 as I was roasting cauliflower slices. It came out perfectly. The sauce was delicious over the chicken pieces as well as over noodles.

I used whole cranberry cranberry sauce. And instead of orange zest I used orange marmalade. So yummy! And simple. Now one of my family's favorites.
