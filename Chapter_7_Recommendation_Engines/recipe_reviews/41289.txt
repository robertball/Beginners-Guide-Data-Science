I didn't make the chips, so I can't comment about them, but I didn't think the fish was anything spectacular.  I'd qualify it as a "take it or leave it recipe"--I could eat it, but if there are other options, I probably wouldn't.  It was very bland, there wasn't much taste to the cornflake coating at all.  I used an egg rather than egg substitute, but I don't think that would affect the taste.  I can say that the fish was very light and flaky, I just didn't think the coating was very flavorful.  I know they probably baked it to reduce the fat content, but if I attempt this again, I would fry it to see if it helps the flavor at all.

This was a little bland for me.  The fish cooked up nicely though.

This is my husband's favorite fish recipe and he's not a fish man.  To add flavor, I substitute the water for some malt vinegar or beer.  Also, I serve with a homemade 'tartar' sauce made from mayonaise, sweet/dill pickles, sugar, vinegar, & onions.

It needs addition of salt to liven up the taste.

The fish turned out very moist.  It was convenient to cook the fries at the same time as the fish. The batter was light, yet crispy.  Much tastier than the the fried fish & chips.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. He's not a fish guy so this was nice and safe for him. I agree that maybe a little more spice would help, but there's really room to experiment with different spices to see what works for best for you which is nice! So it's a good basic recipe.

I only tried the fish and it was ok, but nothing more.  Much better once coated in tartar sauce.  I probably would have given it 4 stars if it werent for the portion sizes.  I didn't quite have enough fish, and needed about twice as much cornflakes.  I'm just happy I had the tartar on hand, it saved the fish.

Very bland.  I even tried to spice it up.  But it just doesn't have a lot of flavor.

Very good recipe.  It did seem a little sweet to me though.  I wasnt sure if it was the coating or the fish.  My husband and SIL liked it a lot too. One change, I used a real egg rather than egg beaters because I didnt have them.
