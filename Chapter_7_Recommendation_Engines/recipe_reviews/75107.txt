I havent tried this recipe..but thought that I would like to share how I fry zucchini. While growing up, one of my best friend was italian.  Her mother cooked zucchini alot for part of the meal.  She would slice the zucchini approx 1/4 inch thick, dip in beaten egg, then drop into seasoned flour. Which was just salt & pepper added to the flour.  She would then fry them in a pan with oil, until golden brown.  Then remove to a paper towel to drain.  I have always fried my zucchini the same way, and it is awesome.  I use canola oil for frying as we also watch our fats.  Even my kids love friend zucchini this way.

This recipe is confusing. The title says "Butter Fried Zucchini" and the description says "cooked in butter not oil". But then it calls for 3/4 cup *margarine*. I don't use margarine, my choice is butter instead of hydrogenated fat, but butter scorched if you got it hot enough to make the coating crispy and at lower temperatures it just soaks up fat and stays soggy. Oil would have definitely been a much better choice. Maybe if you use margarine this will turn out, but I can't see the benefit, I'll go back to using seasoned bread crumbs and olive oil for my fried zucchini.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare vegetables, and this one seemed pretty easy. However, the flour gives the zucchini a bland taste. However, I am going to try it again with thinner slices of zucchini and some sort of herbed breadcrumbs instead of flour.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best. You could taste both the egg and the flour fairly well. I didn't add any seasonings. I would recommend add seasonings if you are going to try this out.

This is a recipe I have made for a long time and it's a good way to sneak in the vegetables. I use Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs instead of flour and the zucchini slices come out really crispy. I also use 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil for frying. I don't think it's AS good with flour. If you want to use flour, I would suggest seasoning it with a little salt and pepper, garlic powder and paprika. Enjoy!

The zucchini is a little bland until you add some seasoning.  Garlic salt with parsley is pretty good.

The batter doesn't stick very well to the zucchini. Better if they were deep fried.

This is one of our family's favorite "appetizers". It's definitely a southern thing, even though we live in California
(family from Texas and North Carolina though).
This is basically the same recipe that I grew up with, except that we just dip the zucchini in milk, not eggs, and then dip in the flour, sprinkle with salt and fry em up! 
These never, ever make it to the table because we eat them to fast :)

I was looking for something quick to do with the zucchinni I had. I was only doing up 1 so I halved everything and added grated parmesan cheese for a little extra flavour. Pretty good and very easy.

I added garlic powder, cajun seasoning , salt and pepper to the flour mixture before it fried it up in the butter. I also drastically cut down the butter..to like 1/4 cup. heated it up til it was extra hot and then fried up the zucchini. Still came out pretty soggy but it was sooo good!! still hunting for a fried zucchini recipe but now i have a great side dish! Served with a side of baked hot wings and sour cream dipping sauce!

While I haven't tried this recipe, I must include the fact that most cooks/recipes use butter and/or margarine interchangeably.  If you don't like margarine, don't use it!  For the cook who complained that butter burned/ scorched, most cooks know that.  If you don't want to use margarine, mix butter with olive oil.  You'll get a butter flavor and it won't burn so easily.

This is not a bad recipe. In my personal opinion I think the breading should be a flour/meal mix. I also think that frying in ACTUAL butter and not margarine leaves for a more authentic buttery taste. OVER all I did enjoy the recipe and I do thank you for sharing it.
