Have never rated anything on this site-until this dip. It’s great. We added mushrooms and used the frozen steak slices to save time/$. Tasted just like a philly sandwich using soft pretzels to dip.

I made this exactly as written, and there was rave reviews from the whole family. Even my picky kids loved it. My husband raved about this and said it would be perfect for the superbowl too. Thanks Chef John!

This was the perfect recipe for the birthday pot-luck I attended. The meat was well done and not over cooked when it went in the oven, and it was just enough cheese. I was worried the cream cheese would not work because the heat from the rest of the ingredients melted it, and it was my first time cookin with cream cheese instead of baking it. I only changed one thing: I used diced provolone instead of shredded, and just cut 5 slices into small piceces then topped the dish with full slices, before it went in the oven.

Expensive to make. Not much flavor and I added some white American cheese to the mix and a little more Worcester sauce. My advice, find a more tasty recipe for the expense

Was a hit for our Super Bowl gathering. Lots of steps and prep time on my opinion but worth the effort when you want to make something special.

Unfortunately I had to change this recipe right out of the gate. Only because I thought I had some of the ingredients at home and actually did not. I made as directed without some of the peppers. This was a smash hit and I will look forward to making as written next time. Thank you for the recipe.
