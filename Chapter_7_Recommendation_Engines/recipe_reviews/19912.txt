I was hesitant about trying this recipe, after reading prior reviews that said the noodles didn't completely cook.  I went ahead and made it exactly according to the recipe instructions and boy was it good!!  Dee-lish!  There were a few noodles that turned out to be a little crunchy when it was done, but this did not detract from the casserole.  The few noodles still crunchy after baking had been located on top of the casserole, where they didn't get as much moisture from the liquid ingredients as the rest did.  Stirring one time halfway through cooking will solve that; that is the only change I will make to the recipe when I make it next time.  The flavor was really delicious and it's very easy to prepare.  Glad I tried it!

This recipe was one of the quickest and most delicious i found on the web.  It was VERY easy to whip together.  I did change it a little.  I added cream of mushroom soup for one of the cans of cream of chicken soup and omitted the mushrooms because that's what I had in my cupboard.  I also covered the casserole with tin foil for alotted 45 minutes and then removed it for an extra ten minutes.  This helped the noodles cook.  I also topped it for the last ten minutes with French Fried Onions.  It was delicious!!!  I will definitely cook this one again.

This was fantastic! I was very skeptical after reading that the noodles didn't cook all the way through in several reviews. My 2-1/2-year-old helped me assemble this and actually ate it, which is saying something for my picky little girl. My husband, who has a hard time trying "new" things, was very surprised and actually ate seconds. He said it was "very good." I did substitute one can of cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom soup. I also added some salt and pepper to the mixture before baking. I baked mine for 65 minutes with stirring once after 25 minutes. I covered it with aluminum foil for the first 45 minutes, then topped it with a layer of french fried onions. It was delicious. The noodles were perfect. The casserole was not runny! I will make this again and again. Thank you Sandy!

This was such a fast and easy recipe. I'm definitely going to make this again for dinner. I was really confused at first about whether or not the pasta needed to be cooked first so I ended up cooking it for 5 minutes in the pot. It didn't do any damage and the casserole turned out great! Also, I think its better to keep the foil over it at all times unless you want some cheese on the top. I bet it will taste even better with a little bit of oregano or green onions.
***I retried this recipe without cooking the pasta and it didn't turn out as great. So people, please make sure to cook your pasta for at least 5 minutes before mixing it in.

This recipe was a good kid friendly recipe. I did modify a few things so I could use ingredients I already had at home. I used egg noodles and cooked them part way.  I also used 1 can fat free cream of chicken and 1 can fat free cream of mushroom soup with only 1 soup can of milk. I used 1lb fresh chicken instead of canned, I just boiled the chicken and chopped it up. I also used light velveeta cheese instead of cheddar.  I also put it into my crock pot instead of baking it.

Oh wow, what a simple and DELICIOUS recipe!!! I love the simplicity of the ingredients and how fast it was to whip up and pop in the oven. We mixed up the ingredients, popped it in the oven and went to play at the park with our daughter. We came home 45 minutes later to the house smelling yummy and a delicious meal! Unlike previous reviews our macaroni was cooked all the way through so there were no problems with that. We left out the onions and used all white meat chicken breast in the can and it tasted great! Thanks Sandy for posting it...be sure to try this one for one of those nights when you want to whip up a fast and easy meal!

Very good, although a little bland.  I used whole wheat macaroni, traded one cream of chicken for a cream of mushroom, added frozen broccoli, omitted the can of mushrooms, and added onion powder instead of the onion.  I covered it with tin foil while cooking until the last 10 minutes and stirred halfway, and the pasta turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make again.

Sandy, your a genius!  What a fast, easy and great meal!! I used 1 can cream of mushroom instead of 2 cream of chicken and also added diced pimentos for color.  Cooked covered until the last 10 minutes. Everything turned out great!  Nobody would've guessed I prepared this in less than 5 minutes. Will make this easy dish again!

Wow, what a delicious and quick dish!! Everyone loved it, including my 3yr old and 10 yr. old.  I don't know if canned chicken is available here in Canada, but I couldn't find it in my grocery store so I poached a couple of chicken breast in garlic and basil, then cubed them.  It was really delicious and flavourful. I also added some peas for colour, and I think next time I'll try other veggies as well--maybe some broccoli or aspargus.

This was great!  A cinch to make and my husband loved it, (which says a lot!). Definitly will make this again. I also substituted one can of cream of chicken with cream of mushroom.

After reading the reviews, I made the decision to cook the macaroni before adding it to the casserole ingredients. I think making this decision helped keep some of the excess starch and gummy-ness out of the casserole and I didn't have to worry about undercooked pasta. I used two large cubed chicken breasts that I sauteed with a little butter/EVOO before adding the chopped onion, FRESH mushrooms (I don't keep canned mushrooms on hand) and some fresh minced garlic in with it. This really only needed about 20 minutes in the hot oven to heat through, seeing as I pre-cooked the macaroni. We didn't really care for this as is. I think it could use some spices or something to make it a little more pleasing to the palate. It's a good start. I think using fresh chicken, fresh mushrooms and adding garlic made it a little better than written.

My husband and I love this dish and make it quite often. I skip the mushrooms and just use condensed cream of chicken & mushroom soup. I also used a Mexican blend cheese once and haven't gone back to cheddar! Sprinkle in some bacon bits for added flavor.

Very good base to make to your individual taste. I used sour cream instead of soup since I had none. Used half the cheese, added celery salt, cayenne pepper, lemon zest, garlic clove and fresh basil. Added fresh green peas and topped with croutons. Baked an extra 20 minutes. Very rich, but the kids liked it. I would rate 5 stars, but I know it isn't very healthy.

This was such a pleasant surprise!  I loved how fast this was to make.  Literally took me 5 min to throw it all in a bowl and then put it the oven.  I made sure to keep stirring the casserole every 10 min so that the noddles cooked evenly.  I also added a little extra milk which helped the noodles along.  If you have a family with little kids and need something fast and easy, this is the recipe!

I'm counting calories; so, I used multigrain macaroni, fat free cheddar cheese, skim milk, and 98% fat free condensed cream of chicken soup. Still delicious!  I cooked the casserole for 45 minutes covered with foil, then an additional 15 minutes without and the pasta came out perfect. So easy and delicious with ingredients that don't spoil...this will definitely become a staple in my home!

This was simply delicious!  I did make some changes because of  the ingredients I had on hand.  I used penne instead on macaroni, and one can of cream of mushroom soup and one cream of chicken.  I used half cheddar and half mozarella cheese.  I also left out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them.  I did not cook the pasta ahead of time, and it came out perfectly cooked.  My whole family loved it.  The great thing about the recipe is that it is adaptable to what you have in your pantry.  I will definitely make it again, and probably try different combinations of pasta, cheese, and soups.

Yum!  Could've used a little more time to get the noodles completely tender...ours were a bit firm.  But otherwise good....simple to throw together and great flavor. P.S. The second time I made this I pre-cooked the noodles for about 5 minutes and they were perfect!

A really versatile recipe! We exchanged velveeta for cheddar, cream of mushroom soup for canned mushrooms, and added some crunchy onion strings as a topper.

Very good and very easy.  Almost no time to put it together - great for a busy mom.  Basic recipe can be adapted a hundred ways based on what you have on hand.  I added peas, will probably try with broccoli next time.  I picked over a leftover roast chicken instead of cans. I'll keep this recipe on hand for leftover turkey after Thanksgiving.  I also topped the dish with a little more shredded cheese when it came out of the oven.  Yum!

My husband took one bite of this and said "mmm, Wow!" (his exact words)  It really was tasty.  I read the other reviews before making this, and I too substituted one of the cr. of chicken soups for a cr. of mushroom.  Personally, I think it may have been a little better with both cr. of chickens.  Maybe a little richer?!  Oh, and Yes.  My macaroni was perfectly done.  Thanks!

This was a very easy recipe to make with excellent results.  My husband loved it.  I substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup for one of the chicken and used leftover cooked chicken. Adding salt and pepper brings out the flavours. I will definately make this again.

Mmmmm-mmmmmmm good!!!  I exchanged one of the cans of cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom because I didn't have any mushrooms in my cupboard.  It was good!  My family LOVED it!  I will definitely make this one again!

Fast easy and delicious.

I did take a few liberties with this... I didn't have elbow, so I used mini penne.    I did one up of sharp cheddar and 1 cup mild cheddar.  Added some salt and pepper, and a clove or so of minced garlic.   I will add less salt next time.  I cooked for 50 minutes.  Adding the french fried onions in the last 10 minutes of cooking.   I also used a 15oz can of canned chicken because that's what I had on hand... more chicken = better right?

I would make this again for sure!

Excellent comfort food, and simple to make.  I followed the directions as specified (minus mushrooms, which I didn't have).  Followed others' suggestion to cover with foil for the first 20 minutes, then stirred and topped with french fried onions.  It was a big hit with my wife.

Very quick and pretty good.  Based on other reviews I cooked my pasta about 5 minutes and then put it in.  Could use a bit more of something as it's a bit bland.  Will make again and experiment.

I substituted corn for mushrooms & cream of mushroom soup for cream of chicken. Also followed the advice of other posts & covered with foil for 45 minutes then added french fried onions for 10 minutes. It was great!

This was good. Even after a few changes this was still missing something. I took 3 boneless chicken breast and cubed them. Added them to a frying pan with melted butter and then added salt, pepper, minced garlic and paprika. Also chopped and added the onion. Once cooked I combined all ingredients and added a little more salt and pepper and 1/2 cup sour cream. I cooked at 350 covered with foil for 40 minutes, removed and stirred as others suggested. Noodles were no where near cooked and the soup had thickened so I added a bit more milk. Cooked for another 20 minutes and the noodles were perfect. Added ritz cracker crumbs to top and baked for 10 more minutes to brown. My daughter is eating it so its a keeper.

Excellent casserole.  Only changes I made was to add salt, pepper & a little onion powder to mixture in bowl and did not use sliced mushrooms, as I didn't have on hand.  Baked casserole at 350' for 45 minutes covered with foil, then removed foil and baked another 15-20 minutes.  I did not pre-cook macaroni at all & it came out absolutely perfect.  After the first 45 minutes of baking I stirred casserole to mix up macaroni, as to not have any crunchy macaroni on top.  This turned out fabulous and my entire family LOVED IT!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Loved this recipe. I used canned chicken which was fine but next time I will use packaged chicken breast. Also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I substituted cream of celery soup. Cooked the noodles first. Turned out great. Definitely a keeper.

My hubby and I really enjoyed this. I was so hesitant because we don't really like casseroles, but I had stuff that needed to be used so I did it. I did change a few things...I used half cheddar and half parmasan cheese.  I added seasoned salt, black pepper, celery seed and worchestershire sauce. I also added frozen vegie mix because I just have to have vegies. I also covered with tin foil and stirred at about 35 mins and left uncovered. Mine actually took close to 1hr and 15 mins before the noodles were done. The last 10 mins, I added crushed ritz crackers with melted butter. It makes a lot and we only made half the recipe. So if you are making this for two people or a family with one child, half the recipe! It was so yummy. I even ate it for lunch today. I thought of a great alternative for an adult crowd or party....add a can of chopped artichoke hearts and some diced up red peppers.  Thank you so much for the recipe. It is a keeper!

I've made this a few times now.  I would recommend stirring the casserole about half way through so that the noodles on top get completely cooked.  I've tried this recipe using broccoli instead of mushrooms and it works quite well.

Excellent!  A few changes I made: used 1 (13 oz) can chunk white chicken, 1 (26 oz) cream of mushroom soup, 1 (12 oz) bag frozen mixed veggies, increased the milk to 2 1/2c and sauteed the onions.  I also added black pepper, white pepper and garlic powder.  I cooked covered for 1 hour, mixing a couple times during cooking, then uncovered and cooked 10 more minutes.  I added a sleeve of crumbled Ritz crackers drizzled with melted butter and broiled for a couple of minutes until browned -delicious!  I highly recommend the addition of mixed veggies!  (I also omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any)

This is a great comfort food and was very well liked in our home, even my picky husband ate it. I did forget the onions, probably a good thing since nobody in my family likes onions except myself. I added fresh chopped broccoli and some extra cheese. I also topped the dish with cheese just before removing from the oven. Like others, I cooked the noodles for about 5 minutes before mixing everything together. I covered with foil while baking. It turned out great. This casserole will become a staple in our home.

So easy!! I agree with other reviewers, this does have a very similar taste to Tuna Casserole. My sons and husband rated it as a "worth making again" dinner. I loved the quick to put together aspect. I added a polybag of green beans and next time will try broccoli. I think I'll use one can of Cheddar Cheese soup instead of two Cr. of Chicken. Didn't use mushrooms. They don't add much flavor and my sons don't love them. Also, the only other change I made was that I used fresh chicken tenders. I poured half of the macaroni mix into the dish and placed the uncooked tenders on top and then poured the rest of the macaroni mix on top. Covered and cooked 50 mins at 350 degrees. Nothing was dry. The chicken cooked up perfectly...why bother to use cooked chicken when your cooking the dish that long anyway?  Thanks for this recipe, Sandy.

Quick & Easy!!! I stirred 1/2 way through baking it...noodles turned out perfect. I omitted the mushrooms & onions.  I substitued 1 of the cream of chicken cans for 1 cream of mushroom.  I also put a little salt and pepper.  The taste reminds me of a tuna noodle casserole dish.

Just finished making this, it turned out great.  I baked it covered in foil for 45 min. then put French fried onion on the top and baked it for another 10 at the suggestion of other reviewers.  Very tasty and easy.

I was in a hurry to make something for dinner and searched for a recipe containing "canned chicken" when I found this.  What a great find!  It was fast, easy and a great "comfort food" for a cold day.  I made a couple of substitutions simply because I had to use what was on hand.  I used almond milk, whole wheat macaroni noodles, fresh mushrooms, and substituted 1 cup plain yogurt for one of the creamy soups.  Hopefully, this made it a bit healthier.  I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer-possibly because of the yogurt making it a bit more "soupy".  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This casserole R-O-C-K-S! Made this the first time for very PICKY Grandchildren ..they LOVED IT and devoured the whole thing. Since then we have had this on a regular basis.

I did, however, make two changes to the recipe:  Cooked the noodles FIRST before assembling the ingredients. And, substituted black olives for the mushrooms the first go round and since then, omitted olives --no substitute!

This is a quick & simple recipe that can be played with by adding/substracting other ingredients. And, this seems to be a no-fail recipe while being a very delicious meal. We loved it!
BTW, with the casserole, I added cornbread sticks and a green salad to complete the meal.

Easy, inexpensive and quick re time.  Followed advice of others and substituted 1 can of cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom, added a little salt and pepper and baked with alum foil cover for 45 mins, took off foil and cooked 15 more mins.  Added can of French fried onions on top and baked for another 10 mins.  Came out perfectly.  Took it to a potluck; Everybody loved it.  (orig 45 min baking time was not enough to cook the macaroni noodles, so the additional 25 mins worked great.

This was a great easy and quick meal to make. I was starving last night and didn't feel like putting in much effort and this just made me look good. My boyfriend absolutely ate it all up. The only thing I did was add peas and it was great. I also stirred it half way so the pasta would fully cook. By doing this it came out perfect. The noodles were al dente... if you like your noodles more cooked leave them in for a few more minutes. If you're not into cheese don't make this recipe. I had to use half cheddar and half Parmesan since that's all I had and it turned out great. The balance was very nice. I do think additional seasoning is required. Thanks for great idea of a quick easy meal.

It is possible to do this without all of the processed goods--which I think makes it taste MUCH better.  I made "cream of chicken soup from scratch" on this website (using half and half).  Because my husband has a gluten sensitivity, we used gluten-free quinoa rotini pasta.  I chopped fresh mushrooms and carrots, added some frozen green peas, and used chicken pulled off of a leftover roast chicken plus some "mexican" shredded cheese.  I only added an extra 1/2 cup of half-and-half.  And I covered it and made sure to stir it twice--once at 22 minutes, and again after another 20 minutes.  Then I took off the foil and let it cook for another 10 minutes.  The noodles were cooked well, and everything was delicious.

I think it needed the macaroni cooked slightly as one reviewer said. I did not cook it first and mine turned out  kind of firm, not soft as it should be and I even covered it in the oven. 
This  reminded me of a bad tuna casserole! , even though it had canned chicken in it.
needless to say , I will not fix again

I appreciate the ease of this dish and the flavor was good, but not great. It was a heavy dish and it seemed like it was missing somthing. I even added some garlic powder, but apparently not enough.

Good casserole, my family liked it. I did cover it with foil and took the foil off the last 10 minutes, stirred and than topped with French's fried onions cause it did sound good. Next time I won't add the canned chicken though, my husband didn't really car of the chicken in it.

The awesome part about this recipe is that you can toss any kind of meat or veggies in and it’s still delicious. I put ham and broccoli that was left over from a dinner, added green onions and the last 5 minutes of baking I topped with French fried onions. This was sooo good! P.S. I did NOT pre cook my noodles and they turned out fantastic.

This is tuna casserole made with chicken.   Fast, easy, kid-friendly!  Made this, popped it in the oven and shoveled the blizzard of snow.  And, yes, I followed the recipe precisely.  Tips:  Drain chicken from a can and mushrooms.  Make sure to cover with foil.  Take foil off for last 10 minutes.  This is a sure bet for a cold wintry day.  Comfort food - especially if you haven't been to the grocery store!  All the ingredients ate in your pantry.  I'm sure this would be good with canned ham, too!  Thanks, Sandy!

This is very tasty and easy. Good to just throw together, put in the oven, make a salad and have an easy meal. We will make it again.

I make this about once a month because it's so easy.  The last time I went to make it I didn't have enough milk so I added 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of water.  It came out creamier with a little bit of tang from the sour cream.  I also sprinkle the top with more shredded cheese to make sure any macaroni sticking up gets covered and cooks.

Not really my type of dish.  I omitted the onions but otherwise left the rest as called for.  My boyfriend liked it just fine but I just did not enjoy it at all.

This was pretty good. Kinda like mac and cheese with chicken and veggies. Better than tuna casserole. I used fresh chicken that I boiled with some garlic and spices, added broccoli, parboiled the macaroni and crushed croutons/cheddar on top the last 10 minutes of baking. It was even better the next day too. I froze a couple of individual containers for when I'm out of food.

This was really tasty and very easy to make.  I replaced the mushrooms with broccoli and would probably like to add more veggies next time.  I followed other's advice and stirred it half way through baking and had no problem with crunchy noodles.  This is a very stick to your ribs kind of meal, so I probably can't make it too often, sadly.

I traded one of the cans of soup for cream of mushroom.  I covered the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes, then uncovered, stirred it and topped with a can of French Fried Onions and baked the final 15 minutes. It turned out SO good!

This was gooooooooood!  I used rotini instead of elbow mac (just like it better) and I left out the mushrooms (don't like them).  I used one large chicken breast seasoned with garlic and onion salt (instead of canned chicken), and cooked it in a skillet in a dab of olive oil.  I sauteed my onion and some minced garlic with the chicken when it was almost done.  I then shredded the chicken breast and mixed everything together as called for in the recipe, along with some garlic powder, onion powder, and a dab of liquid smoke.  Baked 40 minutes at 350, then 10 at 400, then topped with some crushed croutons and shredded cheese, then baked another 10 at 400.  It will seem a little soupy at first, but it's not by the time it's done cooking, so I originally made a note to reduce the amount of liquid next time, but don't do it!  It doesn't need it and will be too dry if you do.  This stuff is DELICIOUS and will be a regular in our house!

Not my favorite.  I can see making something like this with a homemade white sauce that would taste much better than cans of soup.  I used the "healthy request" cream of chicken and mushroom and I sauteed the onion and added green pepper before mixing.  I also used fresh chicken breasts and pre-cooked the noodles a bit.  It's just too thick and fake tasting for me.  No matter how you change it, it's still a canned soup recipe - and it tastes like one.

I made this for a potluck, because I was tired of serving sub-par dishes at potlucks and I really wanted to serve something nice this time.  This was easy to make, made a very nice presentation, and disappeared completely in no time at all.  I had some and it was awesome!  My husband could not believe how fast it went.  I took the advice of some others and baked foil covered for 30 minutes, then topped with French's onions and cooked uncovered for an additional 20-25 minutes.  Yielded a huge amount.  Will make again!

Was looking for a recipe to use up leftover baked chicken and yours was a clear winner. I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup because as another reviewer said, I was out of mushrooms; 1 can cream of chicken, added 1 can of green chilies and served it with cornbread muffins. Thanks for a recipe that provided an excellent base to use what was on hand in a delightfully delicious way. Loved it!

I made this casserole for a potluck and it was very easy & yummy. I used 1 can each of cream of chicken & cream of celery soup.  Precooked noodles to cut down baking time.  Used cooked & shredded chicken instead of canned.  I baked it uncovered just to bubbly & brown.  I had some leftover so took it for lunch the next day. It was just as good as the day before.  I tripled the recipe as was serving a lot of people.  It did just fine.  Definitely recommend this as a crowd pleaser dish.

We found this to be very bland and I didn't think the chicken went well in this recipe at all.  Sorry.  Unfortunately, it could have used some spices, but because all the ingredients are dumped into a bowl, cold, it is impossible to taste test this before it is finally dumped, again, into the casserole and baked.

it is better to pre-cook the macaroni, and boil the canned chicken,in some water.(it gets salty if you don't) and it didn't say to drain the canned mushrooms,so please do. also, rice and corkscrew pasta works well, as does scalloped potatoes.

Very good recipe.  I used baby shells instead of elbow macaroni and the pasta came out perfectly cooked.  I also used the 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken and omitted the mushrooms because my kids don't like them.  This recipe turned out really good and tasty.  Oh, and I didn't have canned chicken so I used canned tuna!!!  I think next time I will double this recipe, four kids ate the whole thing!!

Quick and easy to make when you have left over chicken from the grill. I let it cook for an hour in order for the elbow mac. to cook threw. Next time I will try egg noodles and throw some canned fried onion on the top for little extra flavor.

From a man's point of view (I cooked this last night) this was / is a big hit.  Very yummy and my picky 16 year old lanky teen ate a second helping.  My wife loved it also and agrees that it's a keeper.    Very easy to prepare and the macaroni was done to perfection.  I used mild cheddar and 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery (I improvised) and a 10 oz can of stems and pieces mushrooms.  Other than that I followed the recipe.

This dish was absolutely yummy!!!  It was so simple to make.  I stirred the dish half way through the cooking process so that there would not be any uncooked macaroni.  I also added some extra cheese and crispy onions on top for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I was in heaven with each bite I took.  My 6 year old son even loved it and he's very picky when it comes to food.

This is a great recipe, and unlike others, my noodles fully cooked. I didn't have canned chicken on hand, so I boiled then when done chopped 2 boneless chicken breasts. Used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. Covered with foil (probably why my noodles were cooked) and baked for 45 minutes, stirring once half way. After 45 minutes, I removed foil and covered top with crispy french onions and baked for 10 more minutes uncovered. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe =o)

This is a great recipe and very quick and easy to make.  I did take a few suggestions from others.  I used 3 c. rotelle pasta, 3 (5 oz.) cans chicken, 2 1/4 c. milk, had no mushrooms but did use cream of chicken & mushroom soup, also added a little salt, pepper and garlic.  I baked it for 1 hour covered (stirring twice) then added a little cheese to the top and baked an additional 15 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  My family loved it.  Will definitely make again!

Yummy! My picky family loves this. CHANGES: 1 can Cream Chicken and 1 can Cream Mushroom. Also, I added garlic and onion powder to the mixture. I've made several times with NO under-cooked noodles (I use elbow or rotini). Just cover with foil for 30min, stir and uncover for remainder. Great w/ cracker topping! Thanks for this easy recipe!

This is a five star recipe because my husband said,"Wow that was really good." He will eat anything and likes most things but reserves his wows for only really tasty dishes. Plus this is a very easy dish to make. It takes less than 10 minutes to through it together and then you toss it in the oven for 45 minutes. Both of the times I have made this I didn't have the mushrooms or onion and it turned out fine. If you do use them they will only make this dish better, I'm sure. This dish also seems like it can take extra ingredients quite well. You could add broccoli, peas, red bell pepper, or whatever to make a little more nutritious. Anyway this is a great recipe. I highly recommend it.

This recipe is the ultimate "comfort food". It is so versatile,& would taste great w/ tuna, or just vegtables. I used the 2 cans of chx soup,cooked mac for 5 min,added oregano,salt,pepper, & x-tra cheese. I also added buttered & browned crackers to top  last 5 min. I highly recommend the crackers or something crunchy on  the top, as it took it from good to great! Thanks Sandy! Will use this as a staple dish for many years,& will have fun "tweaking" according to my mood!

easy, filling, quick, cheap! Awesome for the lazy college kid! ;) and the ingredients leave a lot of wiggle room. I for instance, used cream of potato instead of 2 chicken, and didn't put the mushrooms or the onions in at all, but it tasted delish! plan on cooking again real soon

This is my first attempt at casseroles so I have nothing to judge it against.  But it was sooooo good.  My husband and I both had seconds.  My children didnt care for it but I'll make it again just in case it was an off night.  

I used an extra 2 cups of cheddar cheese and used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom.  Also added the french fried onions on top which I think gave it that extra kick of flavor.  

I had leftovers for three nights.  Yummy!

This was so delicious. I stirred it a few times while it was baking so all the macaroni cooked. It came out great. I will make this again.

Pretty good stuff.  I didn't even measure the cheddar cheese, I just dumped a bunch in.  I cooked the macaroni about 4 minutes, drained it and then added it to the casserole.  I also put crushed potato chips on top.  Yum!

This was surprisingly good. I didn't use canned chicken, but I had cooked chicken I needed to use up. I didn't have mushrooms on hand and it still had a good flavor. Also, based on others review I cooked my elbow macaroni for four minutes first and it didnt turn out crunchy.

Fairly good recipe, though would recommend using real chicken, not canned.  I would also add more cheese (not neccesarily cheddar) to add more flavor.  I added peas, will try broccoli or another vegetable next time. I covered with foil and stirred the noodles 3/4 way through cooking- the pasta came out perfect. I tried cheddar cheese fried onions on top- very good.  Best served right out of the oven, as it dries out very quickly.

My boyfriend LOVED this recipe, which is great because it is super easy to make. If you have a little extra time I strongly recommend boiling chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken. We also like it with bread crumbs on top.

I'm still debating on whether I liked this or not.  I used three boiled chicken breasts, added celery,coarse black pepper,garlic powder and salt.  I also stirred it about three times and baked it for over an hour because the macaroni took a while to cook.  Also added extra cheese on top.  It's basically macaroni and cheese with chicken. My husband liked and said he would eat it again,I think that's the only reason I'd make it again.

This was great!  I did stir it halfway through to make sure all the noodles cooked completely.  I also added a little salt and pepper at the end because it seemed to need it.  My husband said he would give it 4 or 4.5 stars... but the amazingly quick prep time made it a 5 star dish in my book.  We ate almost the entire cassorole between the two of us... I couldn't stop!  I will definitely, definitely add this to my regular cooking list!!!!

Tasty and easy! My 5 year old, who loves to help, practically assembled it on his own and both kids LOVED it. We cut up two cooked chicken breasts and added a tiny bit of garlic powder and dried basil. Fantastic, Sandy, thanks!!!

This recipe was very good.  It came out better than I thought it would after I first read the recipe. Other than using cooked chicken breast instead of the canned chicken, I followed the recipe as written. It was very tasty, yet very easy!  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was ok. My husband said it was an expensive chicken noodle casserole, since canned chicken is SO expensive in Hawaii. I'll probably used chicken breast next time.

I thought this casserole was really great.  I cooked and cubed fresh chicken breasts instead of using canned chicken.  And I added frozen peas and carrots, and instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken, I used one chicken and one mushroom...it turned out wonderful.  My husband, who hates mushrooms, didn't know it was mushroom and had two helpings of this.

Just tried this recipe last night and we were impressed. It is much like adding chicken to macaroni and cheese. An excellent change of pace if you are getting bored with your usual week night dinners. My husband even requested the left-overs in his lunch today. Thanks for sharing this one!

This was very good.  My parents (who tend to be quite picky) even went back for seconds.  I did cook the macaroni half way before putting it in the oven, but only because our oven is kinda cruddy.  I also used cooked chicken breast instead of canned stuff.
Thanks for the good supper, Sandy!

great recipe when you want something quick quick quick to fix and stick in the oven. I agree with other reviewers on using cream of mushroom soup in place of one of the cream of chickens. Also, for the reviewer who said the casserole was much too runny, be sure to drain the can of mushrooms and the cans of chicken. I did this out of experience on other recipes, but this recipe does not say to do it. The consistency of my casserole was great. I would definitely recommend stirring halfway thru the baking process so any noodles sticking up get mixed in so they can cook properly and not get crispy. Also, I used Campbell's Healthy Request soups in this one to reduce the salt and fat and I'm really glad I did because is was PLENTY SALTY even with that change. I also used reduced fat cheese and 1% milk and had great results.

This turned out so good, although I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I thought it might turn out too heavy using the milk, so I used chicken broth instead as the liquid. It still turned out nice and creamy, so the original with milk must be very creamy. I did not use the onions. I had steamed broccoli so I used that instead of mushrooms.  I had to stir the casserole toward the end of cooking because I realized some of the macaroni was too dry and was going to turn out chewy on the top layer.

I followed some others' advice and cooked the penne (I didn't have elbow) for about 5 minutes before anything.

This is REALLY easy to make - throw everything together and bake.

I really like how it seems like you can always add/subtract based on what you have or your taste. For instance, I don't like mushrooms, so I left them out. I also used Mexican blend shredded cheese instead of cheddar, simply because I didn't have cheddar. I also used minced onions from my spice rack instead of chopped onions, and I added maybe about 1/4 cup of red pepper flakes.

Anyways, I'd definitely make this again, and I'll keep exploring different options for ingredients. I'm intrigued by adding in some small green peppers, maybe some shredded tomatoes+green chiles, maybe even corn. 

Bottom line: if you have a couple cans of chunk chicken and a couple cans of cream of chicken soup, you can create some version of this casserole  in under an hour and impress your lady.

The only change I made was using dried minced onion instead of a fresh one. Still delicious and one of the easiest, best tasting recipes I've ever made!

This was very easy to put together and tasted great!  My family liked it, too.  I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup for one of cans of Cream of Chicken.  Skipped the mushrooms because my kids don't like them.  Just as one of the reviewers suggested, I stirred it half way through to avoid the crunchy, under cooked noodles. I may add broccoli the next time I make it.  Overall a great recipe to have on hand.

Although I did not follow this recipe to the letter, I did not change much and it was delicious!
I precooked the macaroni because I did not read the recipe, I skimmed it! Anyway, because of this I only used one can cream of chicken and reduced the milk to 1 1/4 cups. I also topped with the ritz cracker mix and added more shredded cheese!
My husband and I both loved it and so easy! Thank you for this recipe!

I did one can cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken, added carrots and broccoli, used fresh chicken breast, and penne instead. I agree with using foil for the first 60 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. It came out great!

This is a favorite of my family. We very it. They love it with Cream of CHicken Soup the best. With the new bigger cans, I use one can and added 1/4 cup of sour cream. We use one of the big chicken cans from Sam's Club. And it's great with Kraft Mexican Cheese blend too. We uses the bow tie noodles last time as we had no macaroni on hand.

We tried this recipe tonight & it was delicious. We did make a few adjustments though. I feared that the noodles would still be a crunchy so I cooked them first which didn't take much longer because while they were cooking I put the other ingredients in the bowl. And I used whole wheat rotini because I was out of macaroni. I used 2 cups shredded chicken, 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 cup milk, 1 teaspoon Morton's Natures seasoning, 1 tbsp minced garlic and 1 cup of peas. My child is the pickiest eater ever and she gobbled it up & requested it be packed for her lunch tomorrow! That makes this a winner!

My family loved this recipe, even my picky eight year old. Any recipe that requires only 5 minutes of prep is a hit in my book, but this was tasty too. I followed some of the reviews and subbed one can of cream of chicken for cream of mushroom. Also I left out the onions and used some onion powder because I didn't have any at home. I covered for 45 minutes and then opened it up for another 10 and my noodles were cooked perfectly, no pre-boiling needed. Thanks for the recipe!

Following the advice of prior reviewers and wanting to make this as healthy and protein rich as possible, I made the following changes:  I used whole-grain macaroni, two 12-ounce cans of chicken breast, low fat cheese, and skim milk.  I also added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and a teaspoon of dried sage.  Then I took the suggestion of those who used the foil and covered it for the first 30 minutes of cooking.  At that point I removed the foil, stirred it, and put it into the oven to finish cooking for another 15 minutes.  Absolutely wonderful and a keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this dish when my family and I were going to a Christmas party at a friend's house. I was so glad that everyone enjoyed it and even got asked for a copy of the recipe. Its fast, quick, and really easy to whip up in flash when you are going out for the holidays to meet up with friends. I embellished on the dish by adding 2 stalks of celery, salt, and black pepper to it which made it stand out even more. Everyone said it tasted like they were eating Chicken pot pie! Thanks for this - Kathy Gee

This is an OK recipe. I've made this twice, the first time I followed the recipe to a T, the second time I made some modifications. I found the recipe as is to be a little bland and felt like it was just missing something. The second time around I sauteed chicken breasts with seasonings. I also added green beans and Mexican cheese as well as seasoning the overall mixture. Like other reviewers I covered it with foil for 45 mins and then baked it an additional 10-15 uncovered. The macaroni cooked fine both times - although I did stir it half-way through each time. Overall it's a good base recipe that can be adjusted to your taste.

I have made this recipes serveral times with delicious results each time.  I change change up the cheese sometimes (colby jack, taco, sharp sheddar, white cheddar, etc).  I have even used cream of onion or cream of celery soup.   Tonight, I used mozzarella cheese and added some italian seasonings.  YUMMY!!!  I think next time I use this combo, I'll use crumbled italian sausage instead or along with the chicken.

Wow! Yummy rich and easy. Used 1/2 recipe measurements, uncooked rotini (spirals), Sargento mild cheddar cheese, 2% milk, Cream of Mushroom soup and dried onion soup. Cooked covered in oven 350 deg for 45 min, added cheese to top and put under broiler to brown for 5 min-would reduce that to 4.5 min next time. Cheers

This was really quick and good.  I did cream of mushroom soup with the cream of chicken soup.  Makes a great meal for a single person like me and I am sure the leftovers are going to be just as great.  This one is a keeper!

This is a 5-star recipe for what it is....EASY comfort food.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I followed others suggestions and baked covered for 45 minutes. Removed the foil, topped with a light sprinkling of french fried onions and baked for 10 more minutes.  Will absolutely make again!

Maybe my changes (based on the recommendations of others) didn't work. I used 12 ounces of chicken, mostly Mexican cheese, one cup skim milk and one cup fat free sour cream, 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom, no sliced mushrooms and topped it with bacon.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I changed it up just a bit.  I used Whole Wheat Orzo Pasta and cooked it ahead of time.  I also used Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breast cubed and cooked.  I only had Cream of Celery Soup which was great and skipped hte Mushrooms and Onions.  I used a Salt Free Garlic & Herb Seasoning and add Sugar Snap Peas - mixed it up and baked it.  It was outstanding.

This was so good to my family!  I took 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and poached them in minced garlic.  I used cream of mushroom in place of one of the cans of cream of chicken.  I aso added 2 tbsp of sour cream.  I will definately be making this again~

Very good-- used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom.  I browned up some chicken strips and threw them in instead of the canned chicken.  Left out the canned mushrooms and used dry onions.  Family loved it!

This was a really simple recipe with ingredients I just about always have on hand. I added some brocolli and extra onion that needed to be used up. Quite good! I'll definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe except I took others advice and changed one cream of chicken for a cream of mushroom, and I stired halfway through.  I am deleating this recipe from my recipe box.

This was a very easy and great recipe!  I added chopped asparagus to the mix, but I don't think that it did much for it.  I did however put one can of cream of asparagus and one of cream of chicken and that gave it an amazing flavor! I did cook the noodles for a few minutes before just to make sure and they turned out just fine.  I baked for 35-40 minutes covered, then 10 uncovered.  For the last 10 I covered with french fried onions and salt/pepper.  I do think that adding more cheese on top at the end would have made it even better.  That's for next time!  Thanks for such a quick, easy, and tasty recipe!

This was a good clear out the cabinet recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and used a left over chicken breast, colby cheese (all I had), cream of mushroom soup, some veggies I had left over and tossed it all in a 9x9 pan.  It turned out really good and didn't take any time at all.  Thanks a lot Sandy!

So sorry, we really didn't care for this recipe.  I couldn't get past the taste of the canned soup.  However, the texture was very nice, creamy, and I liked the short preparation time. I poached a couple of chicken breasts rather than using the canned version and as I was out of milk, I used cereal cream thinned a bit. I do think if I can come up with an alternative ingredient for the soup it would be a terrific quick-to-make dinner.  Thank you for posting it.

I made a few changes: used fresh chicken breast, omitted the mushrooms and onion (due to dietary reasons), added chopped roasted red peppers, used 1 can of cream of chicken and one can cream of celery soup. The casserole and a salad was a great dinner.

Cooked fresh chicken in olive oil and seasoned with garlic pepper. Cooked pasta according to package directions. Once cooked, sauteed fresh garlic and onion. Then combined chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of chicken soup, milk, and pasta and topped with cheddar cheese. Baked for 30 min instead of 45 min. Turned out absolutely delicious!

Pretty good, considering I threw this together with what I had on hand. Used evaporated milk, subbed a packet of onion soup mix for the onion, and used 2 cans cream of mushroom (omitting mushroom). Topped with breadcrumbs. Also cooked macaroni for 5 mins before combining for the oven.

Very, very good, and super easy!  My husband and 5 year old daughter loved it!  My younger boys weren't quite so sure about it, but they're super picky.   I made this with tuna instead of chicken, added some pepper and garlic salt, and did one can of Cream of Chicken and one Cream of Mushroom.  Covered with foil the first 30 minutes, then stirred and baked an add'l 10 minutes uncovered. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent! Just made it for the first time and it was delicious! I did omit the mushrooms, because I am not a mushroom fan. Instead I added chopped broccoli and topped it with crumbled ritz crackers. it was great! Will definitely make again!!

I took the advice of other's and fully cooked the pasta first just because we like softer macaroni. To give it an extra kick, I added a can of Rotel- we loved it!  Gave it just enough zip!  will definetly make again.

It was ok. We added more cheese, and garlic powder and more onions. It was still bland. Used real chicken breasts also. My husband forgot to add the milk so it was dry. next time, I think we will definately add green chilies, and something crispy on top. Very quick and easy...a good starter recipe. Thanks!

As others have mentioned, I didn't pre-cook the noodles... I just made sure to cook 30 minutes covered, stir, then 15 minutes uncovered. They were fine. I reserved a little bit of cheese to sprinkle on top and put it back in the oven for a few minutes to let it melt. I spiced it up a little with garlic powder, thyme, crushed rosemary, coarse ground black pepper, and seasoned salt. I used one can regular and one can fat free cream of chicken soup. Oh, and since 2 c. of elbows would be a lot more than 2 c. of shells, I used 8 oz. shells. My husband loved it!

This was a super easy casserole but nothing special. I used 3 chicken breasts (I do not like canned chicken). I cooked it for 45 minutes covered then an additional 10 uncovered and added some crumbled Ritz crackers on top the last 10 minutes. I did use one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of chicken as other suggested. It still needs something more though...maybe next time I will try to add a sliced red bell pepper for some extra flavor.

This was an incredibly easy dish.... I took one reviewers suggestion and put it in a crock pot.... I also didn't have any cheese so used velveeta insead.... added peas and used some half and half to alleviate the runniness some reviewers had encountered.... delicious and super duper easy.

This is a very tasteless recipe.  I added fresh rosemary,lemon thyme and more garlic and it was still barely edible to me. I did use fresh chicken breast and fresh mushrooms along with green onions.  I guess this is just not my kind of casserole!

This was really good! 
I did make some changes; 
*I cooked the macaroni first. 
*I used real chicken breasts. 
*Instead of 2 cans of condensed cream of chicken soup and the mushrooms, I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup.

This was a pretty good casserole. Like many others, I used 2 poached chicken breasts in place of the canned chicken. It was a pretty heavy meal, like many "cream of something soup" recipes are - but it's a good, quick meal for a busy week night.  Thanks Sandy!

I can't say I was super happy how this turned out. I used fresh mushrooms, brown rice pasta, and chicken sausage, but don't feel like that should have caused a radical change. It was very salty (I think from the condensed soup) and a bit too runny (I even let it cook an extra 20 minutes). I was hoping for an easy, throw in the oven, forget about it for 45 minutes meal, but I don't think I'll try this again.

I thought this was just ok. I did use one can cream of chicken and one celery. I used more cheese and cut up chicken breasts. This was a little rich for us. Might make again with some tweaking.

It was delish and the moisture in the wet ingredients cooked the pasta perfectly. I used large elbows, fried onion topping, and Colby jack cheese, but otherwise unchanged. Easy recipe to manipulate. Gonna try shredded rotisserie chicken pieces, different pastas, and bacon topping.

Good stuff, even with soy milk, whole wheat pasta, and half of the cheese being fat free.

I love super easy meals, and this one definitely is! It's so good too! The best part is I had almost everything I needed for it already. Now as for modifications my husband and I don't like mushrooms so I replaced one can of cream of chicken with cream of mushroom to hide it and didn't add the real mushrooms. I drained the 10 oz can of chunk chicken I had and drained and added a can of corn as well. I filled both cans of soup with milk to try to get at least most of the leftover soup in and then I used maybe half of a 1/4 cup of minced onion instead of real onion. I added maybe half of a tablespoon of minced garlic as well. and since it looked like there was too much milk I added more noodles maybe 3/4 cup to 1 cup extra. I wrapped it in tin foil, cooked it for 25 mins, added some garlic powder and garlic salt since it seemed too onion-y and stirred it, cooked it for another 25 mins. Unwrapped it cooked it for 10 mins, tasted the noodles and they were a little firm still, covered the top with more cheese and cooked it for another 10 mins. It was perfect and delicious! Not to mention there's enough leftovers for tomorrow night so I can get out of cooking again lol. I think next time I'll add more minced garlic at the beginning so I won't have to add garlic powder or salt next time and maybe more chicken as well. I'm definitely making it again though, I loved the simplicity and the whole family loved it! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely add this to my dinner rotation!

This was alright... nothing fancy, but that can be expected from the ingredients. Was a nice and easy quick meal to fill the void for those nights when you don't feel like cooking.
I cooked covered for 45 mins stirring twice... then uncovered for 10 with some additional cheese on top.... my noodles were cooked just fine.... I might make again but add some broccoli for a more complete meal... added a bit of fresh ground pepper but it definitely needs some seasoning... no salt though as you get enough from the soup... used diced cooked chicken breasts.  Not sure why anybody would ever use canned chicken for anything... fresh is better

NO. Just no. Let me start off by saying that I followed this recipe to the T. I didn’t change ANYTHING. First off the noodles were no where near being done. Second off it was WAY too runny. Very disappointed because some of these reviews were amazing. Guess I didn’t read the bad ones. Will not make again and do not recommend

I used half orzo and half veggie spiral pasta (because it was all I had), added pepper and broiled it the last few minutes to really brown the top. It was SO much better than I expected it to be!

Love this - a few modifications - I used rotini instead of elbow macaroni, 2 cans of chicken condensed soup, and subbed diced green chiles for the mushrooms (my mom's idea!). Cooked at 375 for 1 hour (30 mins covered by foil) and let sit 10 mins before eating with sour cream on top. Yummy!

I needed something that I could make with the ingredients I had. I didn't have mushrooms or onion so I used an onion soup packet. It came out very onion strong but it still tastes good to me, maybe not to my kids so much. I stirred a couple times while cooking to get all macaroni to cook. Topped with French fried onions (yeah, probably didn't need to do that). Next time maybe I'll have more of the ingredients on hand.

After reading a few reviews, I covered the dish for the first 40 minutes or so.  In addition, I stirred the dish twice while baking.  All in all, it turned out more like Chicken Mac & Cheese, but  I still liked it.

I only had a few things around the kitchen and this recipe saved the day! I didn't have mushrooms so I used peas. I read the reviews about the noodles not cooking all the way so I stirred it after 20 mins and it turned out great. It kind of tasted like chicken pot pie with noodles. I will definitely make this again. I love easy dinners! :-)

This is a family- favorite. I change it up a bit since I get home during supper time hours. I skip the onion and add onion powder. I also mix the cheeses; 1 cup of extra sharp cheddar and 1 cup of a 4-blend Mexican style cheese. I add a little chili powder for some "zip" too. It's a guy-thing, I guess :) - Michael Lawson, Noblesville, IN

Very good for a base dish, definitely needs additions to make more flavorful.  I substituted cream of broccoli for cream of mushroom, used brown rice pasta instead of regular, added garlic, added frozen broccoli, used grilled chicken vs canned, and added the french's onions on top.  Had to cook for 60min, stirring every 20 in order for the pasta to cook.  Then added the onions on top, left uncovered to bake for 10 more min.

I read in the reviews about this being a big hit and how yummy it was so I gave it a shot since I had canned chicken to use.  It was a big hit with our family and smelled SO good while cooking!!  After reading reviews I boiled my egg noodles for 5 minutes.  I only did half the cheese because my oldest son doesn't like things cheesy.  I used homemade soup mix instead of canned soup.  I only used 1 cup of milk and added salt and pepper.  Covered for 45 minutes, then uncovered and added French Fried Onions.  The only thing was that some of the noddles stuck to the bottom sides of the dish but if I had remembered to stir it 1/2 way through that would have helped.  I will be adding this to my Family Favorites Cookbook.  Thank you Sandy!!

I had a lof of canned chicken and wanted to try this recipe. After reading the reviews, I also made a few changes. One can of cream of mushroom soup with one can of cream of chicken soup was good. I did cook the macaroni for a short time also. I didn't add more mushrooms.  I also did the French Onion rings at the end.  A very good touch to a great recipe.  Thanks! This is a keeper.

It is a quick and simple casserole but definitely it is a bit bland. I used frozen chicken breast and potatoes instead, it worked out perfectly. I halfed all the ingredients though.

I was skeptical about not boiling the macaroni first, but it turned out fine.  Everything cooked thoroughly and the flavor was good.  However, it had a very starchy flavor that I am sure came from not boiling the elbows prior to baking. Still, in a pinch, this is a good recipe.

My family loved this! I made several modifications, following others' suggestions: I used 2 full cups of chicken, substituted in one can Cream of Mushroom instead of chicken (used low sodium versions of each), Sharp Cheddar instead of Mild, left out the onions, and baked in a covered 10 x 10 inch dish.  Stirred after 30 minutes, then returned to oven for another 25 min.  Removed, sprinkled with more shredded cheese then a layer of seasoned breadcrumbs and placed under broiler for a few minutes till toasty brown.
Absolutely delish!  Can't wait to try more variations, maybe with Cream of Cheddar and/or Cream of Broccoli?
Very simple recipe oozing with creamy goodness!

This is great! I precooked noodles about 5 mins. I boiled my chicken w/Adobo seasoning and chopped it up, substituted 1 can cream of mushroom soup, added chopped broccoli and chopped onion.  I topped it with cheese then crushed Ritz crackers drizzled w/ butter.  Some people like pimiento in it,too but had mixed reviews when I added those. Delicious!!

So delicious and so easy!  I stir it halfway as others have suggested but otherwise it is perfect as is.

I'd give it a solid 2 1/2 stars (if I could).  It was okay - not bad but not fantastic as other reviewers found it to be.  Wasn't sure how it was going to earn the "wow" factor considering the ingredients were pretty simple.  In that regard, it didn't disappoint.  Did add broccoli to bump the healthiness.  Won't be making it again.

This was a good recipe and I feel this is one that you can really add stuff to and make it your own. my husband doesnt like mushrooms, so I omitted that from the recipe. But it was yummy nontheless.

Really TASTY casserole that is easy to adapt to different tastes. For us I used tuna instead of chicken and added frozen peas for a bit of color! Also topped with a few breadcrumbs for texture - this one is a winner! I did use the tin foil to cover it for the first 30 mins and this prevented the crunch macaroni.

This is a good recipe.  I did it exactly as the recipe stated.  I was a little worried about using uncooked macaroni.  But it turned out good.  I used chicken breasts and cubed them and cooked them before adding to the other ingredients.  I had to cook the casserole a little longer then stated because the macaroni wasn't totally cooked after 40 minutes.  I did stir it halfway through cooking and had it covered with foil for about 30 minutes.  Then I sprinked more cheese on top and cooked for about 5 minutes more.

Made with leftover chicken and one of the cans of soup was low sodium.  Made without mushrooms--use mushrooms next time.  Serve with green vegetable and crescent rolls. Without any sides, Mom, Gary and I finished entire casserole.

I was completely satisfied with this recipe. I didn't have an onion. So instead, I soaked some dried minced onion in hot water to re-hydrate it & then added it to the mixture. Don't add extra salt/pepper because there's plenty in the canned soups. I covered my pan in tin foil for the first 35 min & uncovered for the remaining time to make sure the noodles were cooked, which they were completely. It did end up baking for 1 hour total to get it golden brown on top.

Delicious, with a few changes.  I prepared everything according to the recipe (even the uncooked pasta part) but I changed the baking instructions.  Instead of a 13x9 dish and 45 minutes, I baked it in a deep 9x6 glass dish, covered with foil for 80-90 minutes.  I then uncovered, sprinkled crushed crackers on top, and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  Doing this, the pasta was cooked to perfection and not dried out, like in the 13x9. Hope this helps!

Delicious.  We don't eat meat so we substituted a couple of diced up vegetarian "naked cutlets" from Quorn.  I added about a 1/2 cup of frozen peas and used cream of mushroom soup.  I bumped up the cheese just a bit, and sprinkled an extra layer on top.  After baking about 55 minutes I finished it off under the broiler to brown it.  The whole family loved it.

My family LOVED this recipe. This is the second time I have made this. I did follow some advice of others when making this. I only had one can of cream of chicken so I used that and one can of cream of mushroom soup. I added about 1/3 cup extra milk, about 1 1/2 cups of frozen mixed veggies, couple dashes of pepper and oregano. I baked at 350 for 40 minutes covered with tinfoil (stirring after 20 minutes) then removed the foil, stirred again, topped with 3/4 c of the cheese and baked again for another 15-20 minutes. It turned out perfectly. The noodles were cooked by doing this without the need to precook them. This is a great basic recipe that you can change to the likings of your family.

Great recipe, Sandy!  Was looking for a one pan meal to please the masses.  This was it!  My hubby is alergic to mushrooms so I substituted frozen peas for color and texture.  Topped it all off with French's French fried onions during the last 15 minutes.  Delicious!!

This is a no nonsense easy recipe.  The taste is good, but not good enough for 5 stars.  However, I will make it again, especially when I need something really easy to make.  Using canned chicken makes it taste a little like tuna casserole, but I suppose there isn't anything wrong with that :)

Really good recipe.  I did make a few changes to the recipe, though.  I did not add mushrooms, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup instead.  We also left out the onion, since we aren't a fan of onions in this house.  I added a bag of frozen veggies.  After cooking for 45 minutes, the noodles and the veggies were still pretty hard, and it was still very runny.  I ended up cooking for a little over an hour and then let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving, and the consistency was perfect!  Next time, I will cook the noodles a bit before baking, because they did not come out fully cooked.  Otherwise, it was a great recipe and a big hit in our house!

This turned out really well! I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom and left out the mushrooms. When it first came out of the oven it was very soupy, but I put it in the fridge until the next day and it turned out great! The only thing I will change next time is to use fresh chicken breast instead of the canned chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe needs to have more flavor. I might try crushing ritz crackers on top next time.

This was a pretty good recipe. It seemed heavy, so I used skim milk & 98% ff cream of chicken soup. It was a good conforting meal, but not too much flavor. Instead of can chicken I used slices of black forest ham. I think I would make this again.

I have been making this recipe for years, and my mother has for many years before that. We add a can of rotel and use shell mac instead of elbow. Out of this world!

I just made this tonight with the kids.  The recipe sounded really delicious but when the casserole was done, it was not edible.  The sauce got all absorbed but the noodles were still half uncooked.  They were crunchy and had a stale-like texture.  It was also very bland.  Also added the french fried onions which gave it a little flavor on top but did nothing for the casserole itself. Altho this was super easy to make, we didn't like the taste of it.  We would not make this again....EVER!

This was great! Made it after a long day of work and takes almost no prep. Took the advice of some others and stirred half way through, otherwise didn't change a thing. I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic recipe.  Thought the onions would have been too much so I cut back on them.  Should have added the full amount.  It gave the casserole a good flavor.  It was gone in 24 hours.  We could not get enough of it.  Passed the recipe on to others and they thought it was great as well.  Will definitely cook again and try different veggies.

Hubby loved this!  Kids were mixed reviews.  I used 1 can cream of chic & 1 cream of mushroom & left out the can of mushrooms. covered & stirred half way, uncovered last 10 min & topped w/ french fried onions. Made a ton & will half next time.  Good enough to make it semi regular in my house.

This was really pretty good.  I'd expected it to be a bit bland, but really I was pleasantly surprised.  Plus, my 13 month old loved it!  Nothing is better than having her eat dinner without picking at it!  My changes:  I used piccolini pasta (little wheels) as I knew this was easier for my little one to pick up than elbow mac.  I diced 3 chicken breasts that I'd poached with poultry seasoning.  I used (1) can cream of mushroom and (1) can cream of chicken soups.  I did use (1) small onion instead of measuring 1/4 c.  I baked in a 13 x 9 glass dish covered with aluminum foil at 350 for 45 minutes.  I then removed the foil and baked for another 10.  Came out wonderful!  I believe next time I make this though, I will try using a creamier cheese like velveeta or american, and add a vegetable to it like broccoli or peas or mixed veges!  (I meant to add the veges this first go round, but alas I forgot!)Oh! And, this reheats really well too in the micro!

Well, it sure was easy to make but I just didn't care for the canned chicken taste.  Might as well use tuna which would taste good with this recipe too.  My husband liked it a lot but next time I will use fresh chicken.

This was a delicious, easy casserole. I followed another reviewer's advice and covered it with foil to make sure the noodles were thoroughly cooked. Very good!

My boyfriend made this for dinner and it was excellent. It was so easy to prepare. He halved the recipe for the two of us, added peas, and omitted the mushrooms. This is a great, quick and easy dish!

I was having family for dinner last night and was looking for something easy that I could make up ahead of time. Well this was wonderful. I made it half again, so used 1 can cream of chicken and 2 cream of mushroom. Used a rotisserie chicken, boiled the macaroni for 5 mins, used 2 soup cans milk and 1 cup sour cream and chopped up 1 cup of fresh mushrooms I had in the fridge. Baked covered for 35 mins, stirred, put back in the oven for another 15 mins (think this was due to the size of the casserole), topped with a large can of french fried onion rings and baked another 15 mins. Everyone loved, loved, loved it. I can see adding peas or diced, cooked broccoli to this, but it is brilliant as is. Thanks for a really good recipe Sandy.

I enjoyed this with a few modifications. I sauteed the onion with some minced garlic, boiled the macaroni for 4 minutes before adding it to the mixture, and also some seasoned salt and black pepper. I covered it for the first 30 minutes in the oven, stirred and returned to the oven uncovered for another 15. Then, I sprinkled Italian-style breadcrumbs on top and increased the oven temperature to 425, and popped it back in for another 10-15 for the breadcrumbs to brown. This is a really good base recipe. My husband only wished it had more chicken. Will try that next time. Thanks!

I took the advice of other reviewers and partially cooked the macaroni a bit before mixing in with the other ingredients.  I also opted to omit the cheese from the mixture, but instead added it to the top the last 10 mins or so of cooking (had some Mexican blend left over from last weekend's tacos).  I used the low salt, low fat version of condensed chicken soup, but aside from that used all organic ingredients (used whole wheat pasta and non-fat milk).  I also added some broccoli, and used thinly sliced fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  This is a good basic recipe that is quick to put together; I'll keep experimenting.  Thanks!

I made this last night and we enjoyed it. The first thing that I noticed was a lack of seasoning. I added a few drops of hot sauce, seasoning salt, and dry mustard to the mixture. I took the advice of others and covered while baking. I stirred at 35 minutes, then cooked covered for an additional 20 minutes. I removed the foil and added french onions to the top as recommended by others. I then cooked uncovered for 10 minutes. All ovens are different so when you stir at 35 minutes you can determine how much more time is needed. I'll make this again.

Although HOCA didn't like the fact that it was not gourmet (also only rated three recipes with only 1 star), this is great when you need to make a quick dish and use what you have in your pantry. Sandy, thanks so much for sharing. I hope you continue to share with us.

This dish was delicious! I used whole wheat shell noodles and cream of mushroom soup because that's what I had on hand. :) I bet a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom would rock out, too.  Stir half way through and it'll help you avoid any overly crunchy noodles. :)

It was really good, but I did use the tenfoil on it as suggested and I did stir it up at about 20 minutes in to make sure all the noodles cooked. I also added minced onions, garlic, and various other seasonings. I also added mozzarella cheese too.

This was an awesome recipe!  Thanks, Sandy! The noodles cooked perfectly and we did as other reviewers suggested by covering the dish with tin foil and using 1 can of cream of mushroom in addition to the cream of chicken.  The french fried onions were a nice touch!  Definitely going to make this dish again and again!!!!

This was great! I made it for dinner last night and I'm eating leftovers for lunch right now. I read the other reviews, so I did boil the macaroni for about 4 minutes. I also didn't have onion so I through in onion powder, garlic powder, and some red pepper flakes. Awesome! My 2 year old daughter kept saying "Yummy!"

Yummy!  I intended to follow this recipe to the letter and because of the ingredients I lacked, it was slightly altered.  My can of chicken was 9 oz., cream of chicken soup was 26 oz. and I only had shell pasta on hand.  So, I used the entire box of shell pasta, and added an extra cup of milk to the soup.  Also, I only had a a white cheese blend on hand.  My family was in heaven!!!  I will tuck this recipe away for the left over chicken or turkey we have on hand.  Thanks a bunch!

Huge hit in our house.  I made exactly as called for minus the mushrooms (because my husband used them) and the onions (because I don't like them) and it was great.  I stirred once throughout to keep it mixed.  My husband said to keep it around.

I read several reviews and decided to give the recipe with the following changes. 1. I used no yolk egg noodles, just a personal preference 2. I used a rotissery chicken for the meat (we use those for all of casserole dishes) 3. I added more onion than called for, about a half cup 4. Added about a t. of garlic salt 5. Omitted the mushrooms (we aren't fans) 6. Covered with foil and baked for 45 minutes (no need to stir, then removed added frenchs onions and baked add'l 10 minutes to crisp up. Turned out great! I loved the simplicity of it. Given the type of noodle I will check for doneness at 35 mins then remove foil and bake add'l 10 as the noodles seemed almost too done. Definetly a great recipe to have in the rotation!

I really had my doubts about this recipe, but I've made it about 5 times, and going to make it again tonight.  My honey and I absolutely love it.  I used onion powder instead of chopped onion, and leave out the mushrooms.  I also add a drained can of corn, and a drained can of sweet peas, just to add some vegetables.  The noodles are always perfectly cooked (Stirring in the middle of the cooking time is key!) and it's a very filling and satisfying dish.  I also tend to use one can of cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken.  It's quick, easy and delicious!

This was a super easy really great tasting recipe!  I did make a few small changes like only using about 1 1/2 cups of milk, I also used onion powder instead of chopped onion just because I was too lazy to chop up some up!  I also reserved about a 1/2 cup of cheese til the end.  I cooked this for about an hour and added the reserved cheese and a cup of corn flakes on top for the last 5 min.  the cheese melted and browned and the corn flakes gave it a crunchy texture that I thought it needed.  I Will be making this again!

This was a very good, very easy cassarole. I used one can cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom soup. I left out the mushrooms since my DH doesn't like, and used onion powder instead of the chopped. I topped with the crunchy fried onions during the last 10 minutes of cooking. My husband was standing at the stove eating it out of the casserole dish!

Instead of using canned chicken, I poached 4 breasts is a saucepan and while i cut them in to bite size pieces i threw the noodles in the chicken water so they would soften a little. By the time i was done with the chicken, the noodles were about halfway cooked. It turned out great and I will just add whatever veggies I have on hand when I make it again. Very kid-friendly. If you use reduced-fat soup and whole wheat noodles, it's better for you and tastes just as good. Oh, and instead of chopped onions I garnished with french-fried onions. Yum!

Unfortunately, I cant say that this was great. The noodles cooked fine but ended up being a bit mushy and the rest was still very runny. I made exactly as directed but added more garlic and onion powder. The taste was fine but I dont think I will make again.

Not bad, but can use a little tweeking.  It was bland and would be better with more seasonings.  We also prefer fresh chicken as opposed to canned.  We did like the creaminess of the soups and cheese together.

Was a great recipe that was easy for me to do. I did stir it half way through the cooking time as noted in another review. Came out perfect, all the noodles were cooked and delicious.

Great basic recipe.  I make a million modifications, though!  More macaroni, boiled/chopped chicken breasts, more cheese (Mexican blend), just 1.5 cups milk, add fresh mushrooms, onion, frozen peas & carrots, substitute cream of mushroom for one of the cream of chickens - and use lo sodium soup!

Very easy but very bland. Macaroni at the top of the dish was hard, not cooked, reccommend stirring half way through cooking time to remedy.  Needs some kick and just spices in general.

Thank you Sooner Sandy for an easy and delicious recipe.  The only thing I did different was to use Kraft Italian Five Cheese vs the Cheddar.

I made this for a large party and it was a hit with both adults and children. I put french fried onions and sharp cheddar in the adult version. No french fried onions and mild cheddar in the kid version.

I Was not sure we would like this but in the end my wife loved it.  I added some frozen veggies and I did one can cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.  Also, you must put a top on it to keep things from burning.

This recipe made quite a bit. It was so bland (even after salt and pepper. My kids thought the chicken was out of place. I ended up giving the rest to a neighbor and she commented that it needed something. Sorry but I will not make this again.

I have to give this recipe "as is" 4 stars. I made the recipe as written and then again but fixed it up a bit. With a couple of changes, it is definitely 5 stars. I made the recipe as stated without the mushrooms (personal preference),and added: one can(drained) of peas, about an ounce of diced ham (I used lunch meat), garlic powder, and black pepper to taste. I covered the pan with foil and baked for 45 minutes. Took the foil off and baked for 15 more minutes. Then I added about a half sleeve of crumbled Ritz crackers mixed with 1 1/2 Tablespoons of butter on top. Broiled for 10 minutes until golden brown. The casserole was not soupy or too dry. Just right!

Super easy.  I covered at except for the last 10 minutes as suggested by others. I added fried onion to the top the last 10 minutes of baking.  Kids ate.  Had leftovers and added peas to it the next day.

This was awesome! here are just a few changes i made cuz i did not have all the ingredients. Used 1 can cream of mushroom. And since I did not have any cream of chicken, I used half a can of chicken broth. Used a soup can of milk.  Boiled the chicken then diced up. And used onion powder instead of diced onion.did use the shredded cheddar with a few slices of velvetta and stirred after halfway through baking time.  Thnx for a fast and easy dish--

The easiest casserole I've ever made, and it tastes great too!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cooking time.  I cooked it for 1 hour 15 mins at 325, covered with foil, removed the cover and cooked for 10 mins at 400 to brown the top.  No problems with the noodles being uncooked.  I'm making this again today, and I'll add durkee onions to the top for some crunchiness.  You could also do this with tuna, or even sausage!

I made this recipe last night and I thought it was really good and easy to make.  I used an 8 oz pkg of prepared Perdue Chix Breast meat. (I do not like canned chix) and I was in a hurry.  How easy this was.  I did add some frozen peas and added french fried onions to the dish for the last ten minutes.  The macaroni was cooked just right, I did stir halfway through the cooking time.  Will make again.  Thanks...

This was just okay.  It serves its purpose of being a quick midweek meal.  I have made it about once a month for a little variety but it is not something I would serve to company or bring to a function.  
The noodles are cooked just right by covering with foil for 45 minutes and then baking uncovered for another 15.

This dish tasted just like my Tuna Casserole, so I wouldn't make it again without some changes. First off, I would use boiled and chopped chicken breasts instead of canned chicken, as the taste is definitely different. I would also use the reccomended two cans of cream of chicken instead of substituting one can of cream of mushroom (long story, I only had one can of cream of chicken), or I would sub a can of cream of something else (broccoli maybe?). I would probably also add some green vegetable, maybe peas or small broccoli florets. Or instead I might add shredded pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar, for some more spiciness. I did find the original recipe a bit bland for my tastes. I covered the casserole for the first half of the cooking time and also stirred halfway through, and the pasta came out just right. I think this recipe would also taste great with some kind of topping, like fried onion. Great base recipe, though.

This was very good! I didn't have canned mushrooms, so I added green chiles. It was still great :)

Pretty good "as is", but I gave it 4 stars for it's add in potentinal. Will add peas next time, already tried it with several other items. One thing though- it is NOT attractive! Looks rather like slop, but the taste is good!

As quick as this was, I cannot complain.  I put cream of mushroom soup in (I didn't have mushrooms) and cut the milk to 1 cup, also used 1 12.5 oz can of chunk chicken in a can....which was okay.  I had started to cook an entire box of elbow mac and after it had cooked for about 5 min, I took out 2 cups for this casserole.  Because the macaroni was partially cooked, I brought the cook time down to 30 min.  It was easy and fast and a good option for a weeknight for this working mom....I'd make it again.

Yummy and quick/easy. Although next time I think I will add some green beans for more flavor and color. Thanks for sharing!

Wow!! This was SO ridiculously easy and yummy!! I made it twice this weekend! The fist time I made it for a party we were having. I used fresh chicken - cooked it on the stove and then added it to the mix, and I also ommitted the mushrooms because I don't like them. I stirred it halfway through cooking, and it came out perfect. There wasn't a bite left.

I made it again the next day for dinner, this time without the chicken because we were out, but it was still a great mac and cheese dish. My family, who didn't get a chance to have it the previous day, loved it, including my 4 nephews that were there. Definitley a keeper!! Thanks!!

IF you like tuna cassarole then you will LOVE this, as this is what it is, tuna cassarole made with chicken. I was really excited to try it after the reveiws, and others are right it is simple and quick, just not quite what I was looking for, although I will make it again - this time with TUNA - it's cheaper! :)

Very tasty.  I will say I think this would taste better with fresh chicken, even though that takes away from the amazing ease of this recipe.  It's good as is, but would be great with fresh chicken.
