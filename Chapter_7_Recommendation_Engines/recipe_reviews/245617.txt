I did not make any changes since I was making it for the first time and wanted to see how Chef John meant for the soup to come out. It was brilliant. The medley of tastes was wonderful. Next time I will take up Chef John on leaving the veggies diced.

This was SOOOO GOOD!! And I didn't even have the rosemary...didn't miss it! I found the creme fraiche at Publix, but it's easy to make your own. You just need to make it a day or two in advance. Definitely make the homemade croutons! They are delicious, and so much better than the pre-made kind (I used fresh sour dough bread from Publix). The only thing I would do differently would be to decrease the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp. My husband and son didn't think it was too hot, but it was burning my mouth! I will definitely make this yummy soup again. Thanks Chef John!!

I'm sort of a self-proclaimed soup aficionado and was anxious to try this recipe. I made it to recipe and decided that this soup is good, but not great; the croutons though were great!  In fact my guest were eating them as fast as I could make them and I was afraid I might not have enough for the soup!  They did add to the flavor of the soup.  If I were to make this again I think I would add the sausage as some suggested or bacon to up the flavor.  Thanks Chef John for this recipe.  You are right, it would make a good base for other meals.

It was good, I forgot to put the carrot and used only dried thyme. Its an easy, quick  and filling weekday dinner. I used evaporated milk instead of creme fraiche to make it lighter. I also added spinach to add more nutrition. The croutons definitely helped make it substantial. Even better served the next day.

Delicious.  Even good with out the cream if you need to avoid dairy. I used only 1/8 tsp. Ayenne pepper and it still had a pop without being too spicy

I made it almost as written. I did not have creme fraise  so I use half and half. I used store bought croutons. My husband loved it.

This was tasty. I used low sodium beans and homemade chicken stock, also low sodium, just a pinch of salt to sweat the veggies and it was definitely salty enough for our tastes. The croûtons were delicious and essential. Next time I make this I'll try substituting some full-fat Greek yogurt for the cream.

Excellent dish. I used kale (torn leaves, no stems) and Italian sausage. Wow!
