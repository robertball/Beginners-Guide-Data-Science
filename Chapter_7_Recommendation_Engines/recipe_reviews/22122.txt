wasn't sure what ranch style beans were so used kidney beans the first time I made it, adults liked it, kids not so much: the next time I used refried beans,everyone LOVED it. I have made this about 6 times in the last few months since I first tried it. I do add taco seasoning to it as well and the last time I made it, I spread salsa over the top after it was baked..OH MY GOSH, heaven in a pan.Wonderful served with sour cream.Thank you, thank-you

This is a good, easy dish.  Some modifications: I'd use flour tortillas, and definitely a small can of green chiles for flavor (green chiles are not hot, just flavorful), and I would use pinto beans instead.  I would also add about 4 oz of sour cream in with the other ingredients (you can do this with almost any recipe that calls for cream of mushroom soup).  In addition to adding flavor, it also keeps it from being "dry" as one person mentioned.  Another way to keep it from getting dry would be to use a teaspoon or two of the juices from each ingredient (tomatoes, chiles, beans).

This is excelent dish. I followed other reviewers suggestions and add almost 1/2 envelope of taco seasoning to beef, sautee one medium onion while browning meat, used 1/2 tsp of chilli powder (i do not like spicy food) and added small can of mushrooms. I put a very thin layer of meat mixture on the bottom of pan and put cheese on all the layers. I also sprinkled jalapenos peppers on half of the dish to spicy it up for my husband. I served it with the choice of sour cream and salsa. We both really enjoyed it. Thanks.

This recipe turned out really well. I gave it four stars because as my husband would say, "I tweeked it some". I have to admit, at first I was a little hesitant to put cream of mushroom soup in a mexican casserole, but it was good. I did use Ranch Style Beans, I believe that they add a certain flavor that only they can add. I have many recipes using Ranch Beans and I am grateful that they are a common staple in South Texas. I used a can of Rotel tomatoes and I used flour tortillas. I ommited the chili powder and instead used a half a packet of taco seasoning. I browned the ground beef with onion and then seasoned it with Tony's (I put that in everything!) and garlic powder. I did as others suggested and put a small amount of meat mixture on the bottom of the pan, then layered the tortillas then meat then cheese, then repeated the layers once more. I also don't measure cheese, I just add what looks good, but I probably used approximately 2 cups instead of the 4 that's listed. I also used Mexican Blend shredded cheese. 
Overall it was very good and was a nice dinner on a cold and wet night.

mmmmmmm!!!!  This was SO good!  It highly exceeded my expectations.  I was mainly only cooking it because DH has been bugging me about cooking more mexican, but it was surprisingly good for being so simple.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and made the following changes: added 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, sauteed onions while the ground beef was browning, used 1/2 can of mexican Rotel (DH isn't a fan of tomatoes, hence the 1/2 instead of whole can), put cheese on all the layers (didn't need 4 full cups), sprinkled chili powder instead of using 2 full tbsp, and put a very thin layer of meat mixture on bottom of dish.  I used flour tortillas because that was all I had and chili beans because I couldn't find ranch at the store, but I'd like to try it with the corn tortillas next time.  And it's just as delicious the next day!  DH even ate it as leftovers and that is a rarity.  Thanks so much!  It's definitely becoming a regular.  :)

This was excelent. I did make some changes though, I didn't have any tortillas so I used Baked Doritos. I also didn't have the ranch style beans so I used some left over beans I had made with the 15 bean soup and chicken thighs. Only used 2 cups cheese (all I had0. Then I added some frozen corn, onions, and salsa.

This is very good and easy to make.  I decided to layer the cheese throughout the casserole because 4 cups of cheese just sitting on top of the casserole seems like a lot.

I had to make a last minute change to this.  I ran out of chili powder, so inplace of it I put a package of Lipton Taco Rice in the meat toward the end of browning.  I also used a can of refried beans instead of ranch.  Then I topped it off with shredded lettuce and sour cream.  My wife is Mexican....she LOVED it!

I used flour tortillas and took previous reviewers suggestions and spread a little mixture on the bottom of the pan. I made two smaller pans instead of one big one and froze pan 2. Haven't cooked it yet to see if it freezes well but figured it was worth a shot. The fresh one was absolutely fabulous, and actually very healthy. Used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup, it was all I had, some 2% shredded mexican blend cheese (didn't use nearly as much as called for, just a personal preference), and 1/2 ex lean ground turkey and 1/2 ex lean ground beef. I also added taco seasoning to the meat when browning. Never would have thought of using soup in a mexican casserole, but this is outstanding and totally easy to whip up. Great recipe!

Very tasty.  The family loved it.  I made a few changes, mainly to make it go further as we had a couple of unexpected extras for dinner and also because of recommendations of others.  I:  1.  Added 1 cup frozen corn  2.  Added 1/2 cup sour cream  3.  Added 1-4 oz jar green chiles  4.  Added 1/2 tsp ground cumin.  5. Topped with 1/2 jar tomato salsa before adding cheese on top.  I also used refried beans because that's what I had, which worked out well for the "I hate all beans" teen at our house!  He never knew they were there and came back 2 hours later for seconds!  Also, maybe because of the additions, leftovers were not dry and reheated well in the microwave.  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good, although if you ask my kids opinions, this was the best! The girls and love anything mexican, but hubby could take it or leave it. I had a feeling he'd prefer to leave this one, so I gave him a salad and leftover london broil. I felt it needed more flavor so I added about a half of a package of taco seasoning mix. I also added the shredded cheddar inbetween the layers. This was quick, easy and tasty. Thanks Beverly!

Very Good recipe with numerous possibilities. I took advise from some others and added Taco Seasoning to the hamburger as it cooked along with chopped onions. Along with the mushroom soup I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tbs chili powder, 1/4 tsp basil, small can of green chiles, and a cup of frozen corn. Between the layers I added sliced black olives and on top.
Next time I will replace the hamburger with chopped chicken breasts.

Mexican Casserole Haiku: "Messy meal to eat. Needs a flavor boost as well. Not bad, just not great." My husband thought this was good, me, not so much. The smooshy tortilla layers in there seemed unnecessary (make broken tortilla chips baked on top would've been better?), the color was unappealing (ranch-style bean liquid + cream mushroom soup = ew), and the flavor was pretty lacking, even though I added 2 TB of "Taco Seasoning I." Not sure I'd make this again w/o some major tweaks, but it was fun to try!

I have been making this for several years, and my family always enjoys it. A few minor modifications per other reviews.  Saute onion with the beef; add 1/2 pkg. taco seasoning; use 4 cheese Mexican mix and divide between the layers; top with chopped green chilies and sliced black olives.  ALWAYS use corn tortillas.  Serve sliced jalapenos on the side. Thanks, Beverly for a really good recipe that can easily be adapted to suit individual tastes.

My family and I REALLY enjoyed this recipe.  I had to change it quite a bit as I couldn't find or didn't have on hand a few items.  I browned the meat with finely chopped onion and 1/2 package of reduced salt taco seasoning mix, mexican chili powder and cracked black pepper.  I used on can of Organic black beans, rinsed, 2 cups frozen corn, 1 large can organic diced tomatoes, liquid included, and added 1/2 cup sour cream with the mushroom soup. I didn't use the tortillas, but instead made a long grain brown rice, mixed together with the sauce, poured it all into a casserole dish, sprinkled the top with Kraft light Tex Mex cheese (about 1/2 cup) and baked it.  It was DELICIOUS, and I will definitely add this recipe to my much loved recipes box on my counter!
Thanks for this tasty, easy family hit!

This is SO yummy. Kinda sounds gross..mushroom soup in mexican? a mexican casserole? but trust me, IT IS SO GOOD! The only thing I did different was add cheese between layers and made 3 layers instead of two. I made it twice in one week! A new favorite for sure!

This was really good. I made mine a bit different and here's what i did. First i heated a can of Los Costenos black refried beans. Next I browned a pound of lean ground beef. Once those two things were done cooking I mixed a can of cream of mushroom with chicken with the meat and combined the beans after. To make it a bit creamier I added a quarter of a cup sour cream into the mixture. I used corn tortillas and layered them with the meat, bean, soup mixture and topped the whole thing off with a small can of verde sauce followed by grated pepper jack cheese. Very good, very easy and my 7 year old had seconds!!!

I intended to make this for a Mexican Bar at a small club for the Friday night dinner. In trying to get everything done by multi tasking, I missed a few of the ingredients, like the beans and mexi corn. I realized it AFTER I had it together and ready to go into the oven! Atleast I remembered the meat! Anyways I called it a Taco Bake instead and it was still gobbled up! Thanks for a great recipe and I promise next time to add the beans and corn!

Very good recipe although I tweeked it a little. Browned beef with 1/4 cup chopped onions and used 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp comino, 1/4 tsp basil, and 1/8 tsp salt. Debated on using the ranch-style beans but very glad I did! Added 1 cup frozen corn.  The cream of mushroom pulled the entire dish together and made it nice an creamy. Used corn tortillas as stated, they soak up the flavor and don't tend to get gooey and mushy like flour tortillas. Only used about 2 cups of cheddar cheese. An absolute keeper!

If this recipe.ever updates to include seasoning, it might go up to 5 stars. Otherwise, added the equivalent spices for "tacos seasoning" and 1/2 chopped onion sauteed with the beef. Saw only one review about dryness, but none of the ingredients say to drain, so in it all went. Tasted great, and plenty moist with using corn tortillas. Shredded what cheese I had left in my brick, to use in middle and topping. Delicious, and only change recommended is seasoning your beef.

I was skeptical, but consider me a convert!  I kind of threw this together with what was in my house, so I used pinto beans instead of ranch, and cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. I like things spicy, so I added a diced jalapeno, and some cumin and cayenne pepper. Also, I detest corn tortillas. I know it's a preference thing, but I thought that this was perfect with flour tortillas. I grated about 12 ounces from a block of cheese and found it to be just right for us. This has instantly become a staple in my home!

Made this recipe on a whim, brought to a friend's house to share. The entire casserole was gone before dinner was through! Didn't have "ranch style" beans, but used two cans of chili beans and taco seasoning. Delicious! Would be awesome with sour cream, salsa, jalapenos, shredded lettuce and guac to go with. Try it! Very easy...

For those who aren't familiar with Ranch- Style Beans,  they are difficult to find in certain parts of the country, which is probably why so many of the reviewers tried different types of beans. I ALSO could not find a can of Ranch-Style Beans at a local supermarket, so I decided to use pinto beans instead (as hubby is not fond of black beans). Instead of using taco seasoning as some others suggested, I chopped up a couple Tbsp. of onion (for half a recipe), minced a large clove of garlic and put in some fresh ground black pepper, cumin, cilantro, oregano, and a dash of ground red pepper. I also added a can of rotel tomatoes (with lime juice and cilantro) and increased the chili powder by half. Since I was out of tortillas, I used tortilla chips, which I think gives the casserole a more interesting texture;  be sure to have enough on hand to crush some over the servings after it comes out of the oven to give it a nice crunch, if you like that sort of thing. Overall, the taste is very good, not really all that bland if you tweak it a little. Because a little tweaking is required, I'm giving this one 4 stars.

Too dry & not enough spice for a Mexican dish. Husband poured hot sauce over the top to add taste. Sorry, won't be making this again.

Very good and easy casserole. The teenagers in our house loved it as is, but my husband and I would have preferred more spices. I added half a pack of taco seasoning along with the chili powder but it still had a very mild flavor. I'll add more seasonings next time I make it.

This is really good.
My husband almost finished the whole dish off!!
He really likes it, and my picky 5 year old ate it too.
I will make this again!
I was surprised with the chilli powder, it was just a tiny bit dominating for us,  I think next time I will cut the chilli powder just a bit. 
Thanks!

Muy delicioso! Family loved it. We put sour cream on top of each serving. Next time I'll put a little of the meat mixture on the bottom so the tortillas are softer. I also used 2 cups cheese on top of 1st meat layer, & 2 cups on the top.

Great taste! We added some onions, peppers, olives, and other yummies to the mix. Topped with sour cream and Verde Salsa. Amazing.

We only used 2 cups of cheese instead of 4 - 4 cups is two bags of cheese, which seemed excessive.

For once, the serving size was pretty spot on. The portions are the perfect size for the hearty meal.

5 Stars!

Very good casserole!  I did make some tweaks to the origional recipe, however.  When adding the seasoning to the meat, I also added a Tbs minced garlic and a palmful of taco seasoning.  I think that really added a lot to the flavor.  Also added a couple heaping spoonfuls of sour cream when adding the soup and used black beans (don't even know what ranch-style beans are, and a previous reviewer recommended not using kidney beans).  Oh...AND added a layer of cheese on top of EACH layer of meat, not just at the end.  Will DEFINATELY make again!

Yummy casserole with easy preperation!! I did add half an onion and a jalapeno when I was browing the hamburger. Also, added half a package of taco seasoning with 1 tablespoon of chili powder for seasoning. Also used Ranch black beans instead of pinto, 10 corn tortillas and only 2 cups of cheese. Awesome! Next time, I'm going to throw in a can of chopped green chilis for a little spice! I don't think you can mess up this recipe! Have fun with it!

Sooooo Yummmmy!!! I couldn't imagine whole beans in this so I spread refried beans on top of each tortilla layer. It worked out great and added another layer of flavor. I also added 1/2 c. sour cream to the pan once the Chili-O (as another reviewer used), tomatoes and soup were mixed with the beef to make the mixture creamier. Wow! Just the right touch! Used all 4 c. of cheese (as we are cheese-a-holics!). It was absolutely delicious. If you like Mexican you'll love this. Thanks, Beverly.

very good, and easy to make.  like the others, i put some of the meat mixture on the bottom of the pan first, then add flour (in place of corn) tortilla's, followed by more meat, then cheese, and repeat.  i use chili beans instead of rach beans, but i bet those are equally as good, and once i find some i will try them.  i also use 2 cups of mozzarela cheese on the first layer, and then 2 cups of cheddar on top.  i didnt find it to be to cheesy at all.  both myself and my girlfriend (incredibly picky eater, she is) love it.  it never lasts long, even the leftovers get devoured.

This was a very easy and yummy casserole that would be good for those who would like comething tasty, but not too spicy.  It would also be easy to "spice-up."  I served it over a bed of shredded lettuce and added some chopped green peppers and green onions on the top - along with sour cream and guacamole.  Everyone LOVED it.

Wasn't able to locate ranch style beans so substituted with chili beans and sauce. Per other reviews added about 1/4 pack of taco seasoning along chili powder. Turned out great. Will definitely make again.

This was very yummy! Can not find Ranch beans in my area so used refried beans instead & followed suggestions: cooked 1.3lbs meat w/ onions & 1 pk of taco seasoning mix (store brand). added 1/2 can whole kernal corn, 1/2 small can black olives, 1/2 small can green chiles. Layered meat then cheese then corn tortillas repeat ending w/ cheese. Very easy! cooked beef & Mixed in casserole dish the night before & put in fridge for Husband to bake the next day while I was at work! Crowd pleaser for my picky eating family!

I give this 4 stars, simply because I changed a couple of ingredients to suit my family's taste preferences.  My casserole results, I'd give it 4 stars.  What I did was substituted 1 can low sodium black beans for ranch style beans (no one likes ranch style beans here). I used regular Petite diced tomatoes (skin on - I wasn't sure why the tomatoes needed to be peeled?), and instead of 2 Tbsp of chili powder, I used about 2/3 of a packet of Taco Bell taco seasoning (I think I added about half a packet, stirred well, tasted it, needed a bit more, but I didn't add the rest of the packet, just a little more, and have some left over, so 2/3 or 3/4 of a packet? tasted again and it was just enough).  I also put a layer of shredded cheese in the middle of the casserole in addition to on top.  Three out of my family of four liked this casserole and wants me to make it again.  I kept thinking it's quite chewy.  I wonder if it would work well with layered tortilla chips?  Will try that next time.  :)

**UPDATE** 7/7/12
I completely forgot that I added taco bell taco seasoning to this the last time I made this, which was the first time - also which was the time I put up the review... so tonight, I'm in the kitchen and hmmm. it's missing something, so yah, I added TB taco seasoning to it.  lol  silly me!  I did remember about not wanting to add tortillas, but tortilla chips, so this time, I put the chips on top, covered w/Cheese and baked uncovered for about 20 minutes. NOW it's 5 STARS!!

I doctored this up to suit our Tex-Mex taste, adding black beans instead of ranch, corn, onion, garlic, cumin, salt and red pepper. Used Mexican style cheese, it was wonderful and resembled the taste of a recipe package I had purchased from McCormick a few months ago.

Love the ease and ingredients in this casserole. It was a big hit at my house for my husband and 3 teenagers. I did add chopped white onion to the hamburger meat while it was cooking. I also added a little taco seasoning along with the chili powder like the other reviewers suggested. I put some of the cheddar on top of all the layers too. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

We doubled our recipe and the large group of kids we fed loved it. We added onions and garlic when browning the ground beef. We also used cream of chicken soup, one can refried beans & one can black beans, a small bag of frozen corn, and added a can of green chiles for extra spice. We served it with sour cream and black olives for garnishes. We used another persons advice and cut our flour tortillas in strips to avoid too thick of layers (great idea).

This casserole is SO delicious! I used 1 packet of taco seasoning when cooking the ground beef. I think that is a must for adding Mexican flavor to the dish! I used flour tortillas instead of corn because I prefer the taste. Also, as other reviewers recommended, I used a can of diced tomatoes mixed with mild green chilies. I was worried about the casserole being too spicy, so I added a sprinkle of chili powder over the mixture rather than 2 full tablespoons. The level of spice and flavor was perfect! 

My one teeny tiny complaint is that the bottom tortillas stuck to the bottom of the pan... next time I'll try using Pam before layering the ingredients in. I served this with steamed corn, sour cream, and salsa. My husband had 2 massive helpings! I will absolutely make this again.

This was a great, fast and easy recipe. Followed recipe except added some chopped onions to the ground meat. This makes a lot and will feed a large family and is fairly cheap to make. My husband loved it. Since we are empty nesters we have leftovers which I am sure will not go to waste.

My family loved this recipe! I would have never thought of putting cream of mushroom soup in it either but it gave it a great taste. I followed the directions as follows except I used the flour torillas as well but overall a great, quick & fullfilling dish.

Absolutely delicious!! Genious, really. The beans and the soup really marry all the flavors and give it all a very hearty and substantial texture. Had company over and they all were amazed at how good it was. Changes I made, as per suggestions, were: used green chili diced tomatos, used refried beans instead of ranch-style, sauteed a bit of garlic and one onion after draining the meat. SO SO GOOD!!! MAKE THIS!

I have made this recipe several times over the past year, it never fails to hit the spot.  I use corn tortillas and lean ground beef with light cheese, I also add a can of rotel along with the other listed ingrediants.  The leftovers are even better.

Did NOT change a thing and it turned out terrific! Hadn't used Ranch-style beans before but I think that's what gave this dish it's unique flavor. 4 cups of shredded cheese sounded like too much and instead put just enough to cover the meat mixture. Family L-O-V-E-D this dish and will definitely make this again!!

Great recipe.  Fast and easy!  I did make a few changes ~ I used homemade taco seasoning (from this site) instead of the chili powder and used black beans (drained and rinsed) instead of the ranch-style beans.  I accidentally grabbed a large can of tomato sauce out of the pantry instead of diced tomatoes so I also added a can of Rotel to give the dish tomato texture.  I also added 1/2 cup sour cream and used shredded colby/monterey jack cheese (not 4 cups ~ about 2 cups) instead of cheddar cheese.  My husband said several times during dinner, "this is really good."  Will definitely make this again!

Very good - even my 4 yr.old and 2 yr. old ate this up - especially with extra chips on the side. I did add a can of green chilies and if it would be for only me I would have added sliced black olives. Did do the taco seasoning in the ground beef and onion too. Most excellent with extra salsa, sour cream and chips

This was actually pretty good... its kind of heavy though, so maybe save it for a friday or saturday night when you can vegetate afterwards... :-) 

after reading a bunch of reviews, i decided to add a can of corn, taco seasoning with the meat, and serve with sour cream on top... also, i couldnt find the ranch style beans, so i used refried beans, and i used ground turkey for my meat... 

Next time i have a party i'll probably serve this with some chips and maybe some jalepenos and black olives... good stuff

This is one of our favorite new recipe finds!! Every time we have company now, I make this...and people eat it up! 

The only changes I make is that I use Chili-O seasoning instead of straight chili powder...and I use closer to 3 tablespoons than 2...

I also cover the casserole for the first 10 minutes, so the top of it doesn't get as crusty.

Other than that, it's an absolute keeper!!

This is a keeper!  We all loved it.

Being from the Midwest, I had never heard of ranch style beans before and had a little trouble finding them.  However, one of the larger supermarkets in my area stocked ConAgra brand Ranch Syle beans in several varieties.  I used the Original Texas Beans. If you are able to find them, I highly recommend you use them since they give the casserole its flavor.  The only modification I made to this recipe was to add chopped onions and roasted garlic to the ground beef as I was frying it.  Thanks, Beverly for a great recipe!

This was really easy and yummy.  Like the other reviewers suggested, I only used two cups of cheese and put half on each layer of the meat mixture.  That was PLENTY of cheese!  I served mine topped with sour cream.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I live in Alabama & we have Ranch Style beans here (lucky for me).  I only used 2 cups of cheese which was really plenty & cutting down from 4 cups saved over 800 calories.  Next time I will try spicing it up a bit more (maybe some jalapenos & a bit of taco seasoning).  Recipe was very easy to make.  Thank you for sharing.

I modified by adding cumin and coriander and a little salsa, I used diced tomatoes with mild green chilis, used a mixuture of tostitoes and doritoes instead of tortilla.  I used montery and mexcian cheese mixed. I used black beans because I have no clue what ranch beans.  I piled this on some lettuce and served w/ fresh chopped tomatoes and red pepper + some sour cream.

I've made this recipe for years. I prefer using chips instead of the tortillas. I also use Rotel instead of plain tomatoes and omit the chili powder. It's great with a can of corn and some sliced black olives thrown it, too.

This was so delicious! I thought it would taste good, but it just had this incredible flavor that I didn't expect. A new one for my recipe box for sure.  I used a full package of taco seasoning, and diced tomatoes with green chilis already added. I couldn't find anything called ranch beans, so used black beans instead. Also, topped with sour cream. Thank you so much for this one!

This was a great recipe! I also used 1/2 pkg of taco seasoning. Maybe next time no tomatoes though...wasn't a big fan. My husband, a pretty picky eater actually liked it and went for seconds!! We put some sour cream on top and it was great. Will make it again :o)

This was good. I used diced tomatoes with jap peppers and added some other spices to give it a little more flavor. I also used soy cheese and extra lean beef to make it a bit healthier. I'll make this again.

I was hesitant about the mushroom soup, but it worked well for holding the tomatoes&meat together, and tasted great with all the other seasonings. If you didn't know the recipe, you would not think this dish had mushroom soup in it from the taste of it.This was easy and tasted good. Next time around, I will look for ways to reduce salt (prepared beans and soup, plus tomatoes add up to a lot of salt) -- but this is a great recipe for tweaking. I used turkey instead of beef and it tasted great.The casserole looked good and held together when served.
I did what others mentioned  and added some cheese between layers. 2.5 cups of cheese was plenty for us, but if you love melted cheese then the 4 cups would be for you.
Somehouw, I ended up with a layer of tortillas on top -- rather than meat mixture-- and it worked fine with cheese atop that. Not messy when served.

This is great comfort food, or Midwestern potluck fare. So easy to make and you can customize to your liking.

Update: made it with leftover thxgiving turkey and it was fantastic. Really nice way to liven up the holiday.

One of my fave recipes! To make this way better---- here is what I do diff.  Cook the meat with a packet of taco seasoning like you would do for tacos. Simmer the taco meat with chili or ranch beans with a can of rotel 25 mins.or longer.. if using lean meat. Then add the mushroom soup to the mixture last. Mix in a few Crushed lime chips too many will make it too dry I like alot though!, then spread mixture in a casserole dish & put cubed Velveeta where you want it.. & push them down with a fork. until under the mixture. Bake Covered with foil. 30 mins till Bubbly... then add the crushed corn chips stick bake in uncovered & toast a few mins. Then i add a sprinkle of cheddar over that to melt. These changes make it way better.

This is the best recipe I have ever used from this site.  Don't feel that you must use all of the suggested changes.  I used the chili powder (not taco powder) and I did not reduce the amount of cheese, and it was great.  I did use flour tortillas, and refried beans instead of ranch beans.  Unlike lasagna, this cuts into nice solid pieces, without the ingredients running all over the place.  It's just a fantastic recipe.

I cooked this Friday and it was great. Everyone loved it. I did tweak the recipe a little. Instead of the corn chips, I used Nacho Cheese Doritos and I did use some taco seasoning. It was Great!!!!!!

I made this recipe this evening and it was really good! I followed it pretty much as is, except that I added black olives and green onions. I also put cheese between each layer and not just on the top. I also thought it needed salt and pepper, but that moght have just been for,our tastes.  My boyfriend and I loved it and I will definitely be making it again!

Yummy and easy. Substituted the Cream of Mushroom soup with refried beans, diced tomatoes with Rotel tomatoes and corn tortillas with tortilla chips. I added all the liquid from the Ranch Style beans and the Rotel for moistness.Will definitely make this again!!

Really Yummy and EASY!!  I did as other reviewers recommended; sauteed 1 onion with meat, added 1/2 pckt taco seasoning, sprinkled chili powder to taste, added one can diced chilis, put a small layer of meat on bottom of pan first, added cheese to both layers, not just top.  Use the ranch style beans(I used the version with jalapenos), it adds an umph I don't think would be there with other beans!  I used ground turkey, but it'd also be good with vegetarian meat crumbles or a sauteed veggie mixture.  Like most casseroles, leftovers are better, once it really sets.  If making for a party, make the day before and heat up in the oven beforehand.

This was okay.  The chips are all mushy.  I think it would be better to make the sauce, sprinkle with some cheese and then break up some nacho chips on the top as you serve it.  Don't think I will make this one again.

Surprisingly delicious!! The kids (2 & 3yr) went crazy for it. I double the amount to make extra to freeze. I used what I had on hand which was taco seasoning, cream of chicken soup, black beans and tomato puree. I only used 2 cups of cheese. It was bubbly and yummy. The only thing I will do differently is to heat the tortillas to soften them and add a double layer of them. I may also try flour tortillas.

Really yummy!  I followed the directions almost exactly.  I did layer the cheese on top of the meat on the first layer.  I also did not use 4 cups.  I used and entire package of the shredded Mexican cheese which I think equates to only 2 cups.  Perfect recipe for 2 people and have leftovers for the week!

delious-absolutely satisfied my mexican food craving. made this for a friend last night but with some adjustments.i used Quorn (soya) mince to lower the fat and we prefer that to meat, used half fat cheese too. i chopped some onions and garlic, browned those off first then added the quorn mince, chooped red and green pepper. i added some left over fajita seasoning, ketchup and sweet chillie sauce (about a tablesppon) as it was tasting bland and lacking that Mexican flavour. tasted great after and before serving, i crumbled some lightly salted nachos on top-yum

This is really good.  Next time I will try it with sweet corn and olives.  Not a big fan of tomatoes so will probably add a smaller can.  All it's missing is sour cream!

Made this recipe for a large group (doubled recipe) and added in per other reviews: taco seasoning, Rotel tomatoes and chiles, can of green chiles, refried beans, frozen bi-color corn. Also put cheese on top of meat at each layer and ended with additional layer of tortilla shells topped with salsa and cheese to finish it off. Super yummy! Got rave reviews at the potluck!

My family really liked this! They even had suggestions to try 'next time'!  It's an easy recipe to adapt to your likings!  Plus, my hubby and I love Mexican! You can easily use any leftover rice or beans on hand.  Thanks for the initial idea!

I used cream of chicken soup--didn't want mushrooms in a Mexican dish.  I tore the tortillas into strips as I was layering them--helps with serving later and not having alot in one bite.  I sprinkled sliced black olives on top BEFORE baking.      We ate with tortilla chips for some 'crunch'--would be good with corn chips, too.  I will add green chilis and whatever salsa I have next time, for some more spiciness.  I used some leftover refried beans and a can of red beans--but will try black beans next time.  This will easily be a common recipe in my house!

My guy loved this and I thought it was good as well.  We were snowed in so I used what we had.   Browned ground beef with the Taco Seasoning I recipe off All Recipes, subsituted Rotel tomatoes  and added a can of olives. We used flour tortillas and as recommended by prior reviewers put some of the mixture on the bottom of the pan.  If we had used regular diced tomatoes and you like some heat, I'd suggest adding jalapenos.

We loved this recipe. I changed the ranch beans to chili beans and added a can of black beans too with a green pepper chopped up. Used rotell instead of regular tomatoes and topped it off before cooking w/ green onions cheese and black olives.

Love this recipe! I added onions and two diced jalapenos (with seeds) to the mixture while it was cooking in the pan with the meat to give it more flavor. I also didn't drain the tomatoes before putting them in the mixture in order to keep the moisture. I put cheese on top of the first layer of tortilla. Served it with sour cream on the side. It turned out good, but needed more flavor. I think I'll add more chili powder and maybe some other spices next time. It's definitely on the top of my list!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight. I used diced tomatoes,  and added a small can of mild chilis, and cooked the beef with some diced onions and Lawry's seasoned salt and ground pepper. My boyfriend is Mexican and he LOVES it. Went back for a third helping!

This was a hit at my house. Quick and delicious. But I did modify a couple things. I did not use the condensed soup. Just did not seem to go with the other ingredients. I also added jalapenos. Was just spicy enough. We love Mexican food. Will be making this dish again,very soon. Thank you.

Ay yay yay!! Made it for a party and it was the first dish to disappear!  Everyone's been asking for the recipe. I, like many of the other's before me, ad libbed this recipe. I really don't think you can botch this one up because you can use optional items. I used the 1/2 pkg taco seasoning, flour tortilla shells, small can greeen chilies and 4 oz of sour cream. I added a little of the juices for moisture and started the layering with the meat sauce first and went up from there. I put mine in the crock pot and cooked it slow for about 3 hours, and it was a delicious Mexican dish.

I really liked this - leftovers were even better than the first go round.  I made a few substitutions based on other reviews - kidney beans instead of ranch and taco seasoning instead of plain chili powder.  Also used some Mexican blend cheese I had on hand instead of cheddar.  A quick, easy and different way to use ground beef; I will be making this again.

This was GREAT!! My hubby said "you can make this anytime"..and proceeded eat leftovers for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I used kidney beans (2 cans)..added some sour cream and didnt use the 4 cups of cheese the recipe called for (that seemed like a LOT of cheese)...even with the 2 or so cups I used, this was still mega cheesey!

My kids loved this!  Only thing I changed was I added a layer of cheese between the two layers rather than just on the top.  Will definately make again, very kid friendly.

I liked it, but my picky eaters were not big on it.  If I took out the beans, I probably would of gotten it all eaten though.

This needed a lot more spice to it.  Just having the chili power didn't do it although I did add a little cumin and a small can of green chilies.  The recipe sounded great and it was good, but I was disappointed.  Put some more spice into it.

Me and my husband LOVED this. I used black beans because I don't know what ranch beans are. Instead of chili powder, I used a half hot and spicy and half regular powder packets for tacos. I also threw in one or two spoons of salsa and a spoon of sour cream. This is delicious and even better left over, although between the two of us, it never lasts more than two days in the refrigerator! A regular in my home now! p.s. If you make it ahead of time and put it in the fridge, the corn tortillas aren't so chewy and we liked it better that way as well. Love that it puts together so fast.

I added green chilis, taco seasoning, and 1/2 can of corn, and no chili powder. Brings back all the right memories. When I was a teenager playing soccer, my mom would have this ready after practice-- I swear I could eat half a pan! Different from Mom's, but still GREAT!

I love this recipie.  It pleased my picky husband who hates onions.   I did make a few changes to the recipie, but i plan on cooking it the next time I have company.  I used a can of rotel and a can of diced green chilies instead of peeled and dices tomatoes.  I also put in black beans instead of ranch style beans and added taco seasoning and other seasonings.  REALLY GOOD!

This is sooo good and leftovers are even better! I made this in the morning for Sunday supper. Nice to make ahead and pop in the oven when ready. I added a pack of taco seasoning and garlic. I took the advise of many others and put a thin layer of meat mixture on the bottom. I used a can of chili beans and layered the cheese. I put a layer of salsa on top then a layer of cheese sprinkled with chili powder. We loved this and will make this again when my Boyfriends kids are with us. They will love this and will help to make it!

Used other reviews for option's. Sauteed onions with the half package taco seasoning while browning beef. Used one teaspoon chili powder. After layering and prior too putting final cheese, sprinkled a very lite amount of chili powder,just to add a little more pizzaz. Prepared rest of recipe as written. WOW family loved it. A keeper and will make it during winter. Thanks for this recipe.

As written needs a little spicing up.  I added taco seasoning, garlic powder, minced onions and a chopped jalapeno to the beef mixture.  Served with sour cream and salsa on top.

I changed it to suit my tastes, no soup, and next time I'm using more tomatoes....it needs a little more liquid. But a great idea and perfect foundation to build your own.

YUM!! this is really good for a last minute dish. I only had refried black beans and flour tortillas so I used them..also, added a can of Ro-Tel tomatoes along with the regular tomatoes. Every thing else as listed...Add a dollop of sour cream to your serving and it's heavenly! This is a keeper!!

This was so easy and delicious! I did add garlic and cumin along with the chili powder, and sauted some mushrooms and a red bell pepper to add some fresh veggies to this.  I sauted the veggies seperately and added in with the meat when I added the beans, tomoatoes, and cream of mushroom soup.  Thanks for a fast and easy dinner!  Oh, I also substituted ground turkey for the beef and it was great!

This is very easy and pretty good for a quick weeknight dinner.  I use refried beans instead of ranch style (not quite sure what those are).  I also used a packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder and a can of Rotel.

This is a great casserole.  My mother always made this for us when we were kids.  My adjustments are:  Rotel (diced tomatoes & green chillies) instead of plain canned tomatoes, Ranch Style beans WITH jalepenos, cream of chicken in stead of cream of mushroom, 1 pkg taco seasoning instead of the chili powder, and after the meat is browned, instead of simmering the meat & seasoning with water, I used the drained juices from the Rotel.  My boyfriend is a VERY picky eater & this is his favorite.  I personally like to add onion to the meat, but he doesn't eat onions.  If you don't mind the calories, this casserole can't be beat!

The only reason why I give it four stars because I added taco seasoning and a variety of beans. IT WAS AMAZING! I think just leaving it how it was would make it fall short.

I've made this recipe twice now & it has been a hit each time. The refried beans  give it a good texture. Like other reviewers, I added taco seasoning & extra cheese. I've also used pre-made taco meat (from the deli section at the grocery store) and that good & easy too. It was even better warmed up the next day.

Sauteed an onion before browning beef.  Added packet of taco seasoning to meat.  Used can of tomatoes w/ green chiles instead of straight tomatoes.  Didn't have tortillas, but did have some yellow cornbread on hand. Began w/ layer of meat in 13x9, crumbled cornbread and spread over meat mixture, then 2nd layer of meat and shredded cheese.  Savory Tex-Mex taste.

Good, will make again. Used refried beans. Added about 1/2 T more chili powder and small can green chiles. Didn't have corn tortillas, used whole grain instead. Next time, going to try using tortilla chips. Put half the cheese on top of the first layer of meat. Added a few drops of hot sauce (Chalulu's).

Not fancy but good.  I changed it up just a bit. I used flour tortillas and added refried beans to the layers.  I layered the dish as such:  tortillas, beans, meat mix, cheese, repeat layers.  I would suggest putting a thin layer of meat mixture on bottom of pan to keep the tortillas from sticking.  My son, who is extremely picky, thought this dish looked awful but I made him try one small bite.  Before I knew it, he was asking for seconds!

I love this recipe. It is so easy and delicious. I never get tired of eating it. And usually I have all the ingredients on hand. Although my husband is kind of wimpy when it comes to spicy stuff so I add just a little less chili powder. LOVE IT

This was an quick & easy recipe.  Some ppl used "Ranch Style" beans but I used the "Ranch Style Pinto Beans" & I added a little bit more chilli powder but I added it to the meat before adding the rest of the ingredients.  It was a BIG hit with my 3 sons & my husband! OH! the first time I made it I put a bottom layer of corn tortillas but they stuck to the pan. So this time I started the first layer of the meat mixture than the tortillas.

This was absolutely the fastest and best casserole-everyone loved it.  I did tweak it though and used flour tortillas instead of corn, omitted the chili powder, cooked the beef with diced onion and diced green pepper and used 1 can diced tomatoes with green pepper,celery & onion and used 1/2 packet of HOT taco seasoning.  Otherwise did everything else according to recipe.  Definately a keeper at my house and so easy to make.  Thanks Beverly for this great recipe!

So very easy and quick to do this one and only a handful of ingredients. DH enjoyed this one. He even had seconds. I used a can of rotel tomatoes/chiles instead of the other tomatoes. My can of mushroom soup had roasted garlic in it, but it didn't affect the flavor once it was finished, I couldn't even tell. I did season the meat as it cooked with onion powder, comino, and salt. I used flour tortillas, cut them to fit. I used American cheese slices for the top b/c I had them on hand and didn't have Cheddar. Nothing fancy, but filling for sure and the family likes it.

This was a hit with my family but I didn't like the thought of cream of mushroom soup so I mixed in some leftover homemade refried beans, salsa and sour cream to make the filling.  In my opinion, the corn tortillas are a MUST but I will have to modify it next time because the tortillas turned to mush during baking.  Maybe next time I will put down two layers of tortillas to keep the integrity of the tortilla.  I loved the flavor...just needed some more texture.  Definitely worth making again.

Made once as written and once w/some changes.  Liked the revised one better: Flour tortillas instead of corn, half cheddar/half Monteray Jack (all cheddar was greasy), and I put half the cheese on top of the first layer of meat mixture instead of putting all of it on top.  Also used about 1/2 cup extra cheese.  Delicious.

I have to rate this recipe twice since I used two recipe's from this site to make one casserole.  I can't speak for the one here on it's own, but I can tell you, it's great for adding in what you like and experiment. I started with 1lb. ground beef and 1lb. ground turkey browned with garlic and onion.  I then added taco seasoning, two cans of cream of mushroom soup, a couple of heaping spoonfulls of cream cheese, a can of Rotel tomatoes and a can of ranch style beans.  Then, I layered flour tortillas, the meat mixture with sour cream on top and lots of shredded sharp cheddar and colby jack cheeses and repeated on another layer.  I ended with cheese and baked to a golden brown.  I made homemade guacamole and served the casserole with that and chips on the side so you could dip those in with the guac or not but I didn't want the chips to get soggy baking them.  This was a huge hit with my 8yr old son, husband and even myself!
I hope you all will try your own versions and see what a masterpiece you can make!

My husband and I really liked it, and it was soooo simple to make.  I used healthly choice cream of mushroom soup and 2% chedder (and only 2 cups) to lighten it up a bit.  I found that the 2 cups of cheese was more than enough (atleast for my hubby and I).  He told me to put this on the monthly rotation.  Can't beat a meal that takes less than 15 min. to prepare!!!  I made spanish rice II with this.

This was really good, however after reading some of the reviews I decided to add hot taco seasoning which made it really flavorful.  Also I used pinto beans. This was a really easy and tastey meal to make!

LOVE this recipe. My DH often works late on Sat evenings, so I can prepare this and we can just eat it after cocktails. I use a 14 oz can of hot tomatoes and green chiles and I divide the cheese and use half on the first layer. The guys will eat over half a pan of this at one sitting. Soooo easy to make, great taste. A keeper!

We liked this one.  "Ranch Style" is a brand of beans - Pintos with spices, etc.  2 cups of cheese is plenty, but add one in the first layer then the 2nd on top.

I love anything Mexican so I thorougly enjoyed this, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. This was VERY simple to assemble the night before.  I had my kids take it out of the fridge to warm up, husband popped it in the oven, and I went to the gym. I followed other's tips and cut the cheese in half for health reasons - it was plenty cheesey without the extra 2 cups.

I made this today for lunch and I gotta say: you know you have a winner when my extremely picky husband tells me to make this again. Just for that it deserves 5 stars! I picked this one because I already had everything in the pantry. It was so simple too! I am going to give this recipe to my two friends that can barely boil water it's that simple!

This was pretty good.  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and put in about 1/2 packet taco seasoning.  I also added some frozen corn to the meat/bean mixture.  I put it in two 8x8 pans and froze one of them for later.  The fresh one was definitely better, but the one that had been frozen was still pretty good.  My boyfriend loved this recipe, so even though it isn't my favorite, it's easy and I'm sure I'll make it again.

Great dinner, but I had to spice it up a little by using salsa instead of tomatoes, taco seasoning instead of chili powder and crumbled tortilla chips on top underneath the cheese. I also used flour tortilla as my family isn't too keen on corn.  Also only got 8 servings with this recipe as written.  Will definately make again and can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Wow!  This was great!  If I could give it 6 stars I would. I wish there had been leftovers so I could eat it again tonight.  Don't know what ranch style beans are so I used some black beans I had leftover in the refrigerator.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn. I also used a mexican blend of shredded cheese instead of just cheddar and put cheese in between the layers.  I'm definitely making this again.  My husband ate his with green salsa and loved it.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I followed several suggestions of others, including mixing taco seasoning, onions & green peppers in with ground beef and cooking together.  I also spooned a thin layer of the meat mixture in the casserole dish before putting in the first layer of flour tortillas (not corn).  This recipe's concept also works well if you have a leftover 7-layer mexican dip appetizer -- just dump it in with the ground beef, and you're set!

Great recipe and I even messed it up.  I used cream of chicken since that is all I had on hand.  I was afraid it would taste funny, but to my suprise it was great.  I also used Mexican Rotel in place of tomatoes and flour tortillas instead of corn.  Super easy Super Good!

This is awesome!!!! My husband adored it. I added onion and green bell pepper (sauteed), cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and used chili beans instead of ranch-style beans, as well as layering the cheese with each layer. We are definitely keeping this one!

My husband & I loved this recipe!  He even went back for seconds which he doesn't do very often with my cooking!  I also thought it was a little bland with just the chile powder, so i took another reviewer's suggestion and added half a bag of taco seasoning. Great recipe, thanks for posting it.

Very Yummy! My husband and two kids (2 & 1/2 yrs. and 15 mos.) loved it.  Husband added a couple of drops of hot sauce to heat it up.  Instead of making 9 x 13 I made two separate 8 x 8 dinners; ate one and froze the other for another time. This was great served with a spinach salad with oranges on top.  A great family dish that the kids will eat!

This can be as good as you make it. Top it with some sour cream and fresh cilantro. Yum! But you really need to use corn tortillas to approach a more authentic Mexican flavor. Save the flour tortillas for burritos and quesadillas.

Used white corn tortillas, taco seasoning instead of chili powder and used 2 lbs of hamburger because we had a potluck to go to. Put some salsa on the top layer then added the cheese. Will definitely make again.

1 Tlbs chili powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 can of rotel tomatoes and 1/2 lbs 90/10 ground beef. Everything remained the same.

Used chili beans because we don't have ranch beans here and used Rotella tomatos and chilies instead of the canned tomatoes because we like things spicey. Everyone (all adults) liked it.

This is delicious. I made a few changes after reading reviews. I sautéed an onion with the ground beef. I used Cream of Celery soup instead of Cream of Mushroom. I omitted chili powder & put 1/2 pk taco seasoning. I added one can white shoepeg corn & 1/2 c. sour cream. I spread a little of the meat mixture in pan before laying the first layer of (flour, not corn) tortillas. I put half the cheese, then meat mixture, rest of tortillas and rest of cheese. I used almost all of the 4 c. cheese called for — be sure to tuck in the top tortilla edges down so they don’t dry out in the oven; the plentiful cheese makes it easy to seal them in. I think this is enough of a meal without chips, salsa or salad! We did put a little taco sauce on our servings. I think this will freeze in squares very well. My husband loves this; said it tastes like food from his favorite restaurant in Choluteca, Honduras (“The Burrito Place”).

I have made this many times but first time making it for my husband and sister who is very picky. They loved it! I used ground turkey, black beans, taco seasoning and added a can of drained whole kernel corn along with the other items.  Don’t drain the tomatoes and it won’t be dry. Enjoy!

I WILL make this again! I did as others suggested. I cooked a med onion with the beef. Drained and I added a full pack of Taco Seasoning.  I shredded one 8oz Sharp Cheddar and 1 8oz Monterey Jack cheese. I did use the  Ranch Style Beans (that I had never heard of before) and I used Ro-Tel Mexican style diced tomatoes (with Lime and Cilantro). BTW I hate cilantro and this was not overpowering at all. I also added a small can of Green Chillies.  I put some of the meat mixture on the bottom and layered the cheese throughout  the layers. Each layer took 6 corn tortillas.  The leftovers the next day were wonderful.

I would definitely NOT make this again.  Meh.  I used the refried beans suggested by many of the reviewers, and it looked like a brown mess when I put everything in the pan.  I made some guacamole along with this-that was the only way it had some flavor.

The flavor of this is amazing, but it lacks a little in texture. With the soft tortillas, it felt like a mushy pile of slop, lol. My boyfriend made tacos out of his and said it was really good that way! It does reheat very well. The next night I put mine on top of a bed of lettuce...yum! Will probably make again but will substitute crushed tortilla chips on the top instead of the tortillas!

I made as written and it turned out great. The only change I would make is to add a little heat to it.
Would definitely make again.

This was easy and really good! I didn’t have ranch style beans, so I used black beans. I’ll be making it again.

very good! I followed the directions but I used a can of diced tomatoes and chilis and taco seasoning instead of chili seasoning. I lined the 13x9 dish as directed and wrapped the second layer of corn tortillas on the outside of the bottom layer to make like an open ended burrito.

With reviewers' advice, I made these changes on my first attempt.  Made 2 smaller casseroles and froze one.  Substituted cream of chicken soup and kidney beans.  A little salsa on the bottom.  Added sauteed onion, garlic, and bell pepper.  Added corn, olives, can of chopped chilis.   Did not use chili powder.  Husband loved it!  Me - not so much.  4 stars because I didn't follow recipe exactly and could have added something to spice it up.

the messier a meal is, the better right?  My 4 and 6 year old loved this!  I made it semi as written...just used what I had in pantry.  I had a pound of ground beef that I had already browned, so I needed to do something with it- so this was the lucky recipe.  

Layered bottom of casserole dish with tortilla chips.  With my already cooked ground beef, I added a 1/2 pack taco seasoning (white chicken chili mix) can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of rote (untrained), a can of pinto beans (untrained) and a can of corn.  Heated all together and began my layering.  I covered the top of the casserole with cheddar and mozerella cheese and baked for 20 minutes.  

Once cooled I sprinkled tortilla chips and added a little more cheese (to hide the beans for my kids).  Garnished with sour cream and salsa.  Quick, easy and delicious.  The only thing I would do different-not add so much rotel or taco seasoning ..a little spicy My little girl asked if I will make this again-so definetly a keeper!  Thank You!!

My whole family of 4 loved this dish! The only change I made was that I added 1.5 lbs of ground beef, not the 1 lb as recommended. I would make this again. My guys ate all but a tiny 2x3 piece!! I thought there would be leftovers! Not with this recipe.

I made this dish last night for my family -  to include a picky husband and 12-year-old daughter . My 7 year old son & I are way easy to please when we are hungry!   We had leftovers tonight and now, the entree is completely gone! 

I was  searching for an easy and quick dish because I was very tired after work but the family had to eat.  I am so happy I found this dish. I will keep it in my weekly rotation. The family not only loved it, they kept saying that this was the very best (which is rare!)  I always read reviewer comments, thank you  for taking the time to write about what you did to your dish, you really matter/people  like me depend on your comments,  and decided to use half a package of taco seasoning,  saute an onion & a little garlic (that you buy in a jar, not fresh) in extra light olive oil prior to adding the ground beef,  season the beef with a little season salt, cumin, and black pepper &  add a few dashes of chili powder,  substituted the diced tomatoes with Rotel (using the same measurements, you will trash some of the Rotel in the second can  because you need two cans to make the correct measurements).   I must say that if I had not added the extra seasonings &  substituted the Rotel, I don't believe that this dish would not have tasted so good, hence the negative ratings.  Other than that, I used all of the other ingredients including the corn tortillas &  ranch style beans  which were excellent!

I, too, was skeptical of adding the can of cream of mush

I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/4 package of taco seasoning.  I sprinkled cheese over both layers.  I, also, use 2 lbs of hamburger meat.  Delicious!  The family loves it!

cream of mushroom just didn't go well so I substituted with refried beans with a little beef broth for creamy consistency and instead of ranch style beans I added corn and half a can of black beans. I served with regular taco fixings. delicious

This was a big hit in our house.  I used regular low-sodium black beans because that's what I had, and those were great in the dish.  I also added about a half of tablespoon of cumin to add some more flavor.  Plus, when my hubby had cooked the ground turkey (used instead of beef for lower-fat), he had added some taco seasoning.  Super easy to make though.  And the kids raved about it.  We'll be making this one again.  Thanks!

I added a can of olives chopped in 1/4 and 1/2 of an onion to the meat mixture then baked it. Then I served cold sour cream as a topping. My family LOVED it and finished off the casserole dish in nothing flat.

I made this tonight with a few adaptations based on personal preference (we like things spicy!) AND what I had on hand.. I had to sub refried beans for the ranch beans and I kept them separate from the meat mixture. I sautéed half a small onion, diced, with the ground beef and added a packet of low-sodium taco seasoning along with the tomatoes and soup. Tasted it, then added about a cup of medium salsa, a tsp of chile powder, half-tsp of cumin. Then poured a little meat sauce in the bottom of my casserole dish, layered corn tortillas, spread the refried beans over the tortillas, added a bit of shredded cheese, another layer of tortillas & poured all the remaining meat sauce over. Topped it with more shredded cheese & baked as directed. I served it with fresh diced jalapeño, green onion, cilantro & sour cream. Yum! It was a hit!! Thanks for this recipe. I will make it again, soon.

Great dish. Instead of chili powder I used a taco seasoning packet and for tomatoes I used a can of rotel to spice it up. I also added a can of drained corn to get some more veggies in.

It was little too soupy/runny for my taste, I'll try it again, but maybe use 1/2 can of soup and drain the liquids from the tomato and bean cans before putting into the mix.  Good flavor though.

This is wonderful exactly AS IS - but  you can substitute what you have on hand too- just DONT leave out the mushroom soup or ranch style beans !!! I've used flour tortillas in a pinch (double layers), added corn, substituted prepared chili for the meat layer, GREAT recipe

I liked the basic idea but it definitely needed to be kicked up with more spicy Mexican flavors, which was easy to do. I browned the meat with onions and garlic, then added about a tablespoon of cumin with the chili powder, and used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies, and 2 cups of a bag of pre-shredded blended Mexican cheeses (4 cups is way too much fat!). I also used easy homemade refried beans and handmade corn tortillas from a local shop. I realize the last part isn't feasible for everyone, but they are sooooo much better than corporate-made discs called tortillas.

This is a definite keeper at our house. I used refried beans, and cut the cheese in half, and it was wonderful. Not the healthiest meal on our faves list, but we'll indulge ourselves periodically on this one.

I added Corn and used two 10oz cans of Rotel original diced tomatoes along with olives. Wife and I liked it. Wife said to use Pam on top of the corn tortillas to moisten them as this cook they were a little dry. I'm still happy with it.

I loved this. It needs a boost in flavor though, so be liberal and experiment, say, red pepper, oregano, salt, pepper, etc. Absolutely stick with corn tortillas, not flour. I put out chopped onion on the table to add after it was served, which was a great addition. Also, sour cream of course. Next time I think I may put some ranch powder in the dish.

I substituted items to make the recipe more low fat.  I used low fat cheese, low fat cream of mushroom, and turkey ground meat.  I did make the recommended sides of salad and chips and salsa and everything was a blast.  Glad I doubled the recipe because I think with two teenage boys, it won't last long.  Mmmmmm.

Wow I made this last night and was the perfect meal for a rainy evening. The only thing I tweaked was I used ranch style beans with jalapeños and I purchased extra lean ground beef.  I loved it and person I shared this meal with did as well.  It was easy prep and i put in refrigerator and popped that sucka in for 30 minutes in oven. Very yummy.

This recipe is great with velvet-a hot cheese, also use Ro-tel to spice it up. Change it up to your taste  and what people like other than that it great. My family has been making this for many years and it is yummy. Put it with a salad it is a great meal.

I made this tonight. Everyone liked it. I couldn't find Ranch Beans so I used a Texas blend sold by Bush beans. I did use half the package of taco seasoning like others suggested and added 1/2 cup sour cream to the mixture. Also, I put a light layer of the mixture on bottom of the pan which keeps the tortillas soft. I will be making it again, my husband likes spicy meals and thought it was bland but once he added some hot sauce he liked it. The rest of us at it as is and liked it.

I wasn't crazy about this dish.  I followed it exactly - almost.  I only used 1 T of chili powder, because I can't have dishes that are very hot.  I would try making it again and using taco powder or adding cumin.  My husband liked it but wasn't crazy about it, either.  It was easy to make and didn't take long.

Love this thing. I did a few variations though to add some more spice. Browned the ground beef with chopped red onions, used a can and a half of Rotel instead of regular tomatoes, and used Ranch style beans with jalapenos. Also brushed the tortillas with vegetable oil so they crisp up a bit in the oven. I've dubbed this a Mexican lasagna

Really simple and tasty.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added some salsa on top before baking.  Served it with green onion, sour cream, diced avocado and a touch of habanero sauce.

This is such a great and easy casserole. I did make a multiple changes after making it the first time. I didn't see the point to adding the chips to the dish itself. When I did that the first time the chips in the dish came out dry and were bendy but tough. The second and most recent time I made it I added no chips. Those will be served on the side. I also used rotel instead of just diced tomatoes. I used black beans AND refried beans instead of ranch style beans which I could not find in stores. I also added fried corn and a 1.5oz packet of taco seasoning. This is also good with black olives on top of the cheese.

Made this tonight. Used cheddar cheese soup instead of Cream of mushroom and added a small can of green chilies. My teenagers loved it and said "mom, this is a make again". I also served mine with bite size tortilla chips.

This was a very tasty recipe. I did add a small can of diced chilis and some red pepper flakes to heat it up a bit. First bite the hubby took, I heard 'WOW, this is good!'. Will be making this again in the near future.

I used Rotel instead of tomatoes, I topped it with roasted red peppers and sprinkled some green onions on top after it came out of the oven. Good but I don't know where they get 12 servings out of it, they must eat like birds. It was more like 4 servings and that kicks up the nutrition quite a bit.

I will make this casserole again, it was good, not excellent.  I too added cumin, I/4 tsp., 1/2 c sour cream, 1 c corn and split it into two casserole dishes since there are just two of us.  Served it with lettuce and tomatoes,additional sour cream.  black olives would be great as well.  Someone wrote that this casserole is dr, I don't know how, we found it very moist.

Awesome Sauce! I couldn't find Ranch beans so I used re-fried beans. And I also added taco seasoning instead of chili powder. Other than those two things, I followed the recipe. It was great! I loved it, dad loved it and so did the kinds. I also added shredded cheese to the middle layer and lettuce and sour cream to the top of the finished products. Great easy weeknight meal. THANKS

Gave it 4 stars because I did a lot of tweaking as others suggested.  Added onions to beef, taco seasoning and 2 tsp of chili, a bit of sour cream and a can of green chilis to mix.  I used refried beans because my grandson is not crazy about beans. Started layer with meat then tortillas then cheese.  Did that twice and topped with cheese mixed with crushed tacos.  Was tasty and not dry at all.

I kind of cheated but glad I did. Made it so good I think. I used refried bean instead of ranch, added two dollops of sour cream, my favorite salsa instead of tomatoes, and cooked the meat in McCormick taco seasoning, sprinkled with green onions when on plate. My husband and son both had seconds. Definitely cooking this again!

I couldn't find corn tortillas at my grocery store, so I used crunchy corn tostadas and those worked really well! I also sliced 3 jalapenos and put them in with the meat mix. This gave it a good kick; but even without the peppers this recipe has a lot of flavor. Highly recommended!

I'm going to make this a gain!  Fantastic.  I did add 2 sereno peppers which I chopped up and cooked in the hamburger before adding the other ingredients.  I really like how this turned out.

Like other reviewers I added 1/2 envelope of taco seasoning and reduced chili powder to 1 T. I personally do not eat mushrooms, so I substituted the canned soup with @ 1 c. sour cream. We topped with shredded iceberg lettuce, salsa, guacamole, and my son even crushed up some Doritos and loved it. Very good and will make again.

This was a great recipe, I made modifications to it. I added olives, green chilies, and corn, carrots, peas, and green beans (mixed veggies) combination.  Kids loved it, we loved it, it was a huge hit in my house!!

This was super easy and I really liked it a lot!!! I did do some extra things based on other reviews. I did use a packet of taco seasoning while the meat was browning and added half a chopped onion. I skipped the chili powder and used a can of chili beans, along with a can of the diced tomatoes with green chilies. Soooooo good!!!

Made this for a family gathering at the beach.  I added green chilies and used some taco seasoning as several other reviewers recommended. I also increased the meat to one and a half pounds.  Everyone really enjoyed this.  Recipe as written: 4 stars.  Delicious. Thanks for posting!

A little leary about this one only cause I had leftovers to use up, and was afraid my family wouldnt enjoy this one....BUT....they loved it. I prepared the night before and popped it in the oven the next day. I used leftover Mexican shredded pork that I had in the freezer and defrosted. I had a pack of corn tortillas that I was gonna toss, used a can of vegetarian beans since I had no ranch style beans, omitted the cream o' soup and added fire roasted tomatoes and lots of shredded cheddar. My kids inhaled this! I did add the extra spices and also threw in some ground cumin. Easy and yummy. Thanks!

This is an awesome,inexpensive recipe that feeds a large family.I live in Northwestern,Pa. where ranch style beans are hard to find so I used chili beans instead.The filling also makes a great burrito filling when used with rice.I make it at least once a month.

My family loved it alot.  My dad even ate it before I put it in the oven and loved it.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used sour cream, and it still turned out good.  I also used refried beans because I didn't have any ranch-style beans, and used flour tortillas after reading the reviews.  I added seasonings like tumeric and the chili powder called for in the recipe since I didn't have any taco seasoning.  All in all, it was delicious, and will make it again using cream of mushroom soup and taco seasoning.  It's definitely a keeper.

Made several changes per suggestions - added 1 packet taco seasoning, used Rotel instead of tomatoes, garlic powder and a sprinkle of red pepper. Will add diced jalapenos next time for a litte more kick. Overall good starter recipe.

Awesome recipe! My hubby loves Mexican, but a lot of other dishes are more time consuming. This was easy and delicious. Made a few changes, but my rating is based on what I imagine the original recipe would be like, too. I used refried black beans, added some cilantro and corn and reduced the cheese by about 1 cup to make it a bit healthier.

This was really good but think I will have to double the recipe next time it didn't really seem to make enough for a 9x13 pan.

Took some of the recommendations of others into account & it turned out great!  I added taco seasoning to the ground turkey (we don't eat beef) mixture.  I also used tomatoes with green chilies to give it more spice.  I used a mexican blend shredded cheese & kidney beans instead of ranch beans because I couldn't find them.  Once it was done cooking I topped each serving with lettuce, tomato, black olives, sour cream & salsa.  It was excellent.

Super recipe! With our Southern Ontario Canada, EH -  hot weather, I cooked it on indirect heat on the BBQ. Also, for 2 of us, made it in an 8" oven proof glass casserole dish using refried beans (pinto).

Delicious but the recipe above is bland. I added Rotel instead of plain tomatoes, Jalapeno beans instead of "ranch" beans, Taco seasoning (bought as a packet at any grocery store) to the beef, and splashed some cholula over it before I put it in the oven. I also added more cheese than the recipe called for too. It was spicy and amazing!

The recipe is ok. I made a few modifications to make it more flavorful. First I used two 10oz cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chillis. I used williams Taco season with the ground beef and I cut about half a yellow onion and added it to the ground beef. I also put cheese on both the layers and jalepenos. I used a mexican blend cheese with a cheddar cheese. I also used corn tortillas instead of flour. I served it with sour cream and hot salsa. My husband liked it but it's not one of my favorites.

This is an extremely bland casserole.  It needs something to jazz it up, but I don't cook very much so I'm not sure what to suggest.  Even though it was too bland for me, I think this would be a great casserole for kids.  I remember when my son was very young, he didn't like anything spicey.  I think he would have liked this.

My very picky boyfriend LOVED this and even got seconds! I did things a little different by getting ideas from the other reviews. I added corn, mushrooms, bell peppers, and used refried beans. I also used both flour tortillas and some tostado chips. I love this because you can have fun with it and make it your own.

This has become a family favorite! I did however make a few changes, instead of tomatoes I used a jar of Pace’s chunky salsa, I also added Low fat Sour Cream and used Kidney beans instead of ranch style. It is like on giant burrito in a pan. This has made its way into the rotation! Oh, I also used taco seasoning in the hamburger.

Loved it!  I used nacho tortilla chips instead of tortillas and added a layer of sour cream and black olives on the first layer of meat. The Nacho chips added a crunchy/chewy factor. A huge hit with my college kids and friends. Says a lot because they work at mexican restaurants.

I didn't have the tomatoes in the cupboard so I substituted a can of Rotel tomatoes.  Added a little kick to the recipe.  I also didn't have any corn tortillas but AI did have a package of tostada shells.  They added a little salt but not too much.  My family really liked this and I'm sure I will make again.

Oh my this is a keeper!  MDH said it was THE BEST recipe I have made from allrecipes.com and I have made quite a few.  I did as the other suggested and added 1/2 packet of Taco flavoring and used refried beans.  I add Mexican white cheese and salsa on the side.  YUMMY!  I can't wait to make it again.

I made this last night. It was great. The only problem I had was the tortillas stuck to the bottom of my pan. Next time, I'm going to try using corn tostados instead. My kids were annoyed at having problems cutting through the tortillas, but loved it. I topped it with fresh tomatos, sour cream, and guacamole. Very tasty & wonderful recipe!

Delicious with only 2 minor alterations! I didn't have ranch beans, so I used pinto beans instead. I also used a package of taco seasoning instead of chili powder! I made it for my college class and there were NO leftovers!

I made this for myself while my wife was out for the weekend - it was excellent! I added a tsp on Cumin for extra punch. I used the corn tortillas and it gave it a real authentic mexican taste. Also, I didn't know what 'ranch style' beans were, and so I just used your average bean-in-tomato-sauce can - it was tasty!!!

This casserole was quite good. Based on others' reviews, I did make a couple of changes. First, I browned the ground beef, and added a whole packet of taco seasoning (+ 2/3 cup water, just as I would if I were making tacos). Second, I did put a thin layer of the meat mixture in the bottom of my pan, as recommended. Besides that, I followed the recipe to a T. Very good!

Overall it's a great recipe. I, too, used taco seasoning instead of the chili powder, but I think I'll add both next time because I thought it could use more of a bite. I also substituted a can of corn for the beans, since I hate beans. It turned out fine.

i was looking for a recipe to use some chili from the freezer and this fit the bill. i didnt have any cream of mushroom soup so i made a quick bechamel sauce to sub. it tasted a lot better than it looked but i would suggest adding another layer of tortillas. mine was a bit "wet" and it wasnt from my chili or sauce because they were both pretty thick

My husband described this dish to our two young children as lasagne with mexican ingredients instead of italian ones!  We loved it!  I was hoping to have leftovers for a couple of days, but it was so delicious it didn't last that long.  This recipe is going to be made at our house again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very delicious! My husband was asking for a good burrito recipe, and this fit the bill.  I generally double the meat(because I feed 8 people) and add one can of soup and 1/2- 1 cup of sour cream.  I use refried beans and one can of drained green chiles and also use taco seasoning because I generally have that on hand.  I followed some of the other reviews and layer the shells, meat and cheese like I am making a lasagna.  Definately a great base recipe and superb with some tweaking! Great served with sour cream and salsa

My family LOVED it! I made just a few adjustments such as adding 4 oz. of sour cream & 1 cup of the cheese in to the mixture and used only 2 cups on top.  Also substituted 14 oz can of tomatoes for 1 can of Rotel and added approx. 1/4 c. water. Added sliced jalapeno's and chopped onions on top layer of cheese.

I just want to say that I LOVE YOU for submitting this recipe. My picky mexican husband loved it. He gave it 8 stars out of ten. So I guess that would translate to 4 out of 5 that they use to rate on here. I think the only reason he didn't give it a 10 is because he is a tomato snob. He only likes them in certain things. So next time I will just chop them up finer and I think all will be well. The only changes I made was to salt the burger when I was cooking, I sauteed some onions and added them in last and I used black beans for that mexican flavor. Not really sure what Ranch beans are... I will DEFINITELY make this alot and MANY MANY thanks for something so quick and fuss-free to make - I have 2 small kids. You SO ROCK!

Really good flavor. I did add 1/2 packet of taco seasoning instead of chili powder, and added red pepper flakes and Louisiana hot sauce to the meat. We like things spicy. Also, I used a can of rotel, and did top off each layer with cheese. I didn't use 4 cups of cheese more like 2. I think this would be good with flour tortillas, as well as corn. Was a real simple easy meal to make.

I like the creaminess of this dish.  I had to use refried beans since I ran out of black beans, and I added taco seasoning to flavor the meat.  Oh yeah, I also added corn since any Mexican dish would not be complete without it.  Very, very good.

It was very tasty with a couple modifications: corn layers in and 1pkg taco seasoning instead of chili powder.  Also, I don't measure cheese, just put on what looks good.  My husband loved it too.

This was super easy and tasted good. I threw in some homemade stewed tomatoes (from this site) I had in place of the canned, and also threw in some left over shredded pork to use it up in addition to the ground beef. I will totally make this again and would have given a 4 1/2 if I could have. The only reason for not going 5 was that it didn't blow us away, but was definitely a solid recipe. I did use the ranch beans, but may try black beans or refried beans the next time to see if that makes a difference in the 4 to 5 rating.

Just made this again without realizing it! Was good, and again would give it a 4.5 stars if I could. This time I used pinto beans because that is what I had on hand. Also used Red Gold's "diced tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice" thinking it would add a little something to it. I made this this time because I didn't have enough enchilada sauce  to make enchiladas and was looking for something similar. I did also add the enchilada sauce I had (one small can mild and one small can hot) to this as well. I like my enchiladas saucy and cheesy (used 4 C. cheese) and made in two pans. I always make a smaller pan of vegetarian enchiladas for my daughter who doesn't eat meat.

This was awesome - and believe me, with the soup involved, I was a bit skeptical. I did make a few changes:  1.Ground turkey with taco seasoning instead of ground beef and chili powder 2. Fat free refried beans instead of ranch beans 3. Smeared mild salsa on the top of each layer 4. Did half in normal cheddar, the other half got diced green chiles and pepperjack cheese 5. topped the entire thing with sliced black olives.  This was VERY delicious, my two young children (2 and 5 years) LOVED it, and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for the great idea!

Fabulous casserole!  Everyone loves this one, even the kids.  Only changes is that I seasoned the ground meat with salt, pepper, ground cumin and taco seasoning.  I add a can of diced green chilies and used pinto beans (as I didn't have Ranch Style beans on hand).  Turned out perfect!  This is one of our favorite mexican casserole recipes - a definite keeper!!

My family really likes this, but I didn't follow the recipe very well - mostly because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  Added a diced onion and fresh minced garlic to the hamburger as it browned.  Omitted soup, but added diced green chilies to the bean mixture.  Used flour tortillas as first layer, then 1/2 the meat/bean mixture, then dotted with sour cream, then covered with cheese.  Repeated layers one more time.  For the topping crunched some tortilla chips and mixed with cheese and covered the top.  Baked as directed.  It did come out a little on the mushy side, but I think that is because I used the flour tortillas.  I agree with the previous reviewer who thought corn tortillas would hold up a little better.  Another idea would be to bake corn bread over the top.  Overall a pretty good recipe that my family loves which makes this a winner for us.

My first recipe attempt from this website - this was easy - and GOOD.  I followed others suggestions and used refried beans - and flour soft tacos.  Next time I'll use the corn soft tacos.  1/2 the chilli powder is fine!!!!

This has become one of my our staple meals!! To make it healthier I use ground turkey and low fat cream of celery soup. I also use about 1.5 cups of cheese. I put half a cup on the first layer and then top it off with a cup of cheese! This is a great fast and healthy meal!!

It was awesome but I did change it up a  bit.  I added 1 pkg of taco seasoning mix and 1 diced onion.  Also on the ranch style beans I used the ones with jalapeno in them.  Everyone loved it, will definitely make again.

I read the reviews and added my own Taco Seasoning (don't like the msg in store-bought), onion (sauteed with the ground beef), pickled Thai peppers and pickled jalapenos for more spice, leftover corn I had in the fridge, and I had to use chili beans, but it was still good. Didn't really like how wet the tortillas were, next time will try it with corn tortillas.

I used a fajita seasoning on the meat mixture and Rotel.  I didn't have Ranch beans so subbed black beans.  A great recipe to modify to your own taste.  Awesome!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I follow it almost completely with the exception that I add 1/2 a package of fajita seasoning while I'm browning the ground beef.  I also make ahead of time and let it cool or better yet, put it in the fridge.  This way it is easier to cut and comes out more like a lasagne. I serve with a bit of sour cream.  This is one of my weekly staples!

Substituted corn for the beans (for personal taste because we just don't care for beans) also substituted cream of chicken soup.  And I accidentally forgot the tomatoes, but will add next time.  Overall a nice, tasty dish!

I made a few changes as well, added onions with the ground beef, used sour cream instead of the soup, used flour tortillas and less cheese.  Great base recipe.  I was kind of leary but it had such great reviews. I still thought it was kind of missing something, maybe a bit more spice?  I'll definitely keep making until I hit it!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and so good!!  I used flour tortillas and chili beans because I couldn't find ranch.  I used less cheese than called for just to lower the calories.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This was pretty darn good, I made a few changes because of what I had on hand. Used pinto beans and added sliced peppers and black olives to the top before baking. I also added taco seasoning to the meat as others suggested for more flavors. This is a handy recipe because it is easy and quick.

This was quick and tasty. I made sure to brown the meat with garlic salt and cumin and I also added about a cup of frozen corn to the mixture. I made this in a round baking dish because it fits the flour tortillas I use perfectly. So good topped with a dollop of sour cream. Thanks for the recipe!

If you are looking for an EASY, comfort food type mexican casserole, this is terrific.  It is tasty, effectively increased and a crowd pleaser.  I have only used ground turkey which seems to work out great.  Also, I use taco seasoning (Taco Seasoning I- allrecipes) made from homemade chili powder instead of just straight chili powder.  The better quality chili powder, the better casserole.  I also use 98% fat free cream of mushroom which works great.  This is the only recipe I use cream of mushroom soup in.  I also use canned black beans (rinsed and drained) instead of ranch style.

Everyone loved it. I did everything in the recipe except added sourcream instead of cream of mushroom. I used fresh green peppers, red peppers, tomatoes,and onions. Added jalepenos between the layers and a little bit of salso in the mix. I also softened my corn tortillas in oil before layering. Doesn't make them soggy, made it just right! Thanks

This was pretty good, but not great.  I think the Ranch style beans and the chili powder had similar flavors, so next time I think I will try cumin instead of chili powder.  But the addition of beans are a nice change from some of the other mexican casseroles.

I only gave this 4 stars because as a casserole it was decent.  The thing I did not like about it was that the corn tortillas just turned into one big mush. I could not find the right kind of beans so I used refried beans which work really well in this.  The chili powder really didn't season it strongly enough with all those ingredients so next time I will season with a taco mix envelope instead.  I served leftovers (after removing all the gloppy tortillas on the bottom) as a dip and served tortilla chips on the side and it got 5 stars all around.

This was yummy!  I used turkey instead of beef and added a little cumin with the chili powder.  The corn tortillas gave it a good flavor as well.  A little on the dry side, but no big deal.  I think I might only bake for twenty minutes next time.

I've made it as is or tweaked it and it turned out great. The best & healthiest version adds a can of drained corn, uses 1 cup of sharp cheese & subs fat free sour cream for the soup and ground turkey for the beef.

Awesome dish! I made this for a banquet. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. I did modify  
a little. I used Ranch Style Beans with Jalepenos (can find at Schnucks or Kroger) Substituted  
the tomatoes with 1 can of Original Rotel. Omitted the chili powder. Added Taco Bell Taco Seasoning with Chipotle and onions to ground beef. My husband and son ask for this on a regular basis.

I loved this recipe but I knew I would want it hotter.  I added mexican rotel instead of diced tomatoes, a can of green chilies, and the Lipton Taco rice someone else suggested and it turned out to be perfect.  It was quick and easy and I will definatly be cooking more often!

This is a very versatile recipe that could be used as a cassarole, dip or filling.  I did use 1/2 package of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and that worked out well.  It wasn't the best recipe that I've tried but it wasn't the worst either.

This was okay, kind of bland...I'll likely try another recipe next time.  I took the recommendations of several other reviewers and put a thin layer of meat on the bottom of the pan and reduced the cheese to approximately two cups and put the cheese between the layers.  I also added chopped olives to each layer and put crushed tortilla chips on top.  I added garlic and chopped onion to the meat, reduced the chili powder and put in half a packet of burrito seasonings.

Delicious!  My husband doesn't like Mexican casseroles because they're so "heavy", but he thought this one was great!  I used Jalapinto beans, Mexican tomatoes & a bit of sour cream & it had enough bite that I didn't need to add any other flavoring.

This dish was outstanding.  My wife and daughter loved it.  The only thing I did different was to smear refried beans across the tortillas and I also added 1/4 tsp cummin, and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper.  Great recipe.

Husband liked it.
I used refried beans. Since we didnt have those beans here. and used flour instead of corn tortilla's. 
Too me it just tasted like I had bought frozen burritoes, it did make ALOT however.

So incredibly good! I used Nacho Doritos in this recipe, and they added a lot of really great flavour and crunch. I did add a few extra spices, including half a package of taco seasoning, which only added to the flavour. This is a very filling meal, I made one pan and there was enough leftovers the next day for another full meal! I'll definitely be makeing it again!

I used ground Turkey & didn't have ranch beans so I added Ortega taco spices to the meat & a can of Black beans.  This is a keeper!  Like other reviewers, I also used only 2 cups of cheese, we have a lactose intoloerant toddler... it's hard to get around even just 2 cups of it!  Anyway, it was VERY filling, satisfying & delish!  Everyone gobbled it up & it's going to stay in my recipe box & utilized monthly!!!

5 stars for the easy preparation and public opinion. I used pork n' beans, rotel tomatoes, and a packet of taco seasoning. I also layered the cheese as others suggested. It was easy and tasty. definately a good one for carry-in dinners and such. Thanks so much for sharing:).

This is so good and so easy!!! It really should be called "enchillada casserole" though. I did as others did and tweaked it a bit but not by much. I added garlic powder and a little more taco seasoning. I also put in a can of Rotel (tomatoes and green chillies) and layered with cheese. I also topped with green onions. Thanks for the recipe! I will definetly make this again and again!!!

Just okay- certainly not something I am adding to my collection of favorites. Flavor was common and texture was rather dog-food like.

This was ok- I wasn't wowed.  It tasted like a burrito, which I don't like. My husband loved it on the other hand.  It was very simple to make and not time consuming.  I probably would make it again.

My family loved this recipe, my picky son gobbled it up.  The comments were that it tasted a lot like enchiladas.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and the flavor was wonderful.  The only thing I would change is that 4 cups of shredded cheese are not necessary, I used half of that on top of the casserole.

My four year old had seconds and asked if I would make it every night!  I'm SHOCKED!!!  I added a package of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder, and, as suggested, added about a 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also don't know what those beans are that the OP was referring to, so I used a can of refried beans.  Thought that would work better with kids, too.   Will make this again!

This was very good and so easy to make.
I used what I had in my cabinet which was Mexican Style Stewed Tomatoes.  After baking, I topped it with sliced black olives and chopped green chilies. DELICIOUS!

This was really good.  I added some taco seasoning.  This doesn't need 4 cups of cheese. I think I only used about 2 1/2 to 3 cups and that was enough.  It only gets three stars because it make a lot and as leftovers it's too dry.

This was really easy and got a thumbs up from the husband. I would make it again.  It also reheated very well too, which is always a plus!
