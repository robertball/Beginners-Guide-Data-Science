This is not your average cream cheese spread; this is something special indeed! I used slightly less then 1/4 cup of each herb and an extra garlic clove, and it was perfect.  I tasted it before adding the lemon juice and I have to say that the lemon really brightened the flavor.  I used kalamata olives and was glad that I didn’t use canned black olives. This spread will become one of our staples when we have an all appetizer gathering.  Finding this recipe felt a little like winning the lottery!  Thanks!

OMG! I made this for my boyfriends Art Gallery reception and people were begging me for this recipe! Very tasty...The only thing I changed was I used lite Cream cheese and I rosted some garlic cloves threw those in rather then minced garlic.
Thank you for an awesome recipe.

I doubled this recipe for a New Year's party. Using 4 Tbsp. of lemon juice was a big mistake! Too lemon-y. Ugh. But okay on a Wheat Thin. I can't comment on the original recipe, but I will NOT be using that much juice again (only 1 Tbsp. for the normal serving size). Other than that, everyone seemed to enjoy the cheese ball. I would make this again. I also think it's easy to adjust by adding some different herbs. Overall, it's a keeper.

This is really good-let this sit in the fridge a while before serving so the flavors can blend properly.

Great flsvour.... I used 1 large clove of garlic and 1 tsp lemon & dill seasoning and being the winter time I used all dry ingredients 1 tsp of each and it was absolutely wonderful. I will definately make this again and in the summer I will try fresh herbs... thanks for the good recipe.

Good recipe but a little too lemony.  I will start with 1T next time and add a little more if necessary.  I used dry herbs, so a little over 1T of each.  I left out the olives as well, and it was good.

This dip is so fresh and herbtastic! Everyone at the party loved this dip, I only changed the green onions to chives, and used no mustard, and was delicious! I wanted to take a pic, but it was gone before I had the chance. I served with sesame breadsticks. Delicious!

We loved this (and so did our friends) using herbs from our garden.  I did use 12 oz. cream cheese to cut the strength of the herbs and left out the black olives for my husband.  Next time I will try using half the lemon juice, but we LOVED this.  Thanks for a way to use more of my herbs!

Very strong flavor, which for me was excellent but might be too much for others.  Most people at our party really liked this, definitely more women than men though.  I thought it was delicious.

My work LOVED this recipe, but I did use more cream cheese than the recipe called for. It was just too much herb and not enough cream cheese.

We enjoyed this but the garlic taste lingered a bit too much which surprised me because I love garlic.  I think I will try the suggestion to roast the garlic next time.

For the reviewer who couldn't mold it, I usually put plastic wrap on the inside of my mold, then line the inside of the mold with cheesecloth and then just pack it in with a spatula to the top and fold the plastic wrap over the top and refrigerate. Once it is refrigerated for a few hours,the cream cheese should harden and mold. Try it.

Everyone loved this fresh take on a cheeseball.  I served it w/ large Wheat Thins and used less dill and more worchestershire.  About half was eaten at my Christmas party, so I remolded it *blush* and served it again at my family get together a few days later.  It was even better the 2nd time.

Everyone loved this fresh take on a cheeseball.  I served it w/ large Wheat Thins and used less dill and more worchestershire.  About half was eaten at my Christmas party, so I remolded it *blush* and served it again at my family get together a few days later.  It was even better the 2nd time.

'Serious Herb' is right! It had great flavor, however next time I will use a tad bit less of each herb and probably roast the garlic first. There's nothing like raw garlic breath :(
Also used kalmata olives, yum!

YUMMY! This is one of those recipes that you keep going back for more. I used minced garlic from the jar. Thank you!

This spread is DELICIOUS!!!  I made this for a church gathering and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  This spread is extremely easy to make and is just so refreshing with all the fresh herbs and lemon juice.  I will definitely keep this one on hand for many future uses.

Fabulous.  I leave out the olives and dill.  Almost everyone loves this.  The only ones that I came across that don't care for this is those that prefer the package mixes.  Great recipe.
