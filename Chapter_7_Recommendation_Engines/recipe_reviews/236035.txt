This was very good... the chicken seasoning was stellar, the yogurt sauce quite good and the peppers and onions gave a nice crunch. Make sure you use lots of the sauce.. the pita bread tends to be dry

My husband just put in an order for this for every day of the week. I had to leave out the cardamon, because I didn’t have any, marinated the chicken for a few hours in the rub and I added some raw tomatoes at the end. Delicious!!

I used the spice mixture to marinate some precooked chicken meatballs. I cut the meatballs in half and coated all sides with the marinade, let them marinate for 2 hours and then sautèed them in the marinade with a little more olive oil added. We stuffed the meatballs into pitas with tzatziki sauce which I had made the day before. Delicious! My husband raved about these sandwiches. I'll definitely use this recipe again, next time as written.

This went over very well in our house.  I was fun to make on the grill and very well liked.  Also I like to show my family the world via the dinner plate.

Good as written but used twice as much of the seasoning to coat both sides of 6 halved chicken breasts chicken well.  Use sauce liberally, it's delicious and the recipe makes plenty.

It was ok.  Maybe too much cardamom because it had a medicinal taste.

Very tasty.  The recipe looks daunting due to all of the spices, but it comes together quickly.  It's a good substitute for the street food, but it was missing something - maybe just the atmosphere?
