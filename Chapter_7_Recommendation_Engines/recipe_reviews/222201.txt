I made this soup for lunch today and to be honest all I could taste was tomato sauce and fish. Having said that, I also think It's a great base to build with and make your own.

We tried this today.... I agree that this is a basic fish stock but  had to add salt and pepper for our taste as I did not see it in the recipe.  Also added lemon grass and celery and a can of chopped tomato.   For the fish, we use our frozen yellow tail, the fish  that we caught last summer.      It turned out great!

Very good and healthy, perhaps with a little less wine,   We liked it very much.    Only change was less wine.

Very good. I used Tilapia and 3 cloves of garlic instead of two.  I also added 2 T of chopped green pepper and 1/2 chopped tomato. I would add more veggies next time like corn, carrots, and celery.
