This was GRRREAT! My husband loved it I even thought it was pretty good. I loved the crust it was Awesome! I did make a few small adjustment I used 2 regular sized boxes of bananna creme pudding and 1 box of french vanilla. I also used light whipped topping and reduced fat milk. Next time I''d like to try  it with sugar free pudding to cut some of the calories . I also wanna try it with chocolate pudding.

This was a wonderful, portable desert.  I forgot to buy cool whip, so I had to substitute with a pint of heavy cream.  I whipped it up with 2 Tablespoons of powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract.  I also used 2 regular boxes banana and 1 french vanilla as suggested in one of the other reviews.  It looked, smelled and tasted great.

This is great!  I made it for a potluck, and made one small change- I layered the crust mixture/pudding/bananas parfait style in a great big glass bowl- beautiful, and super good!

I made this for company and got rave reviews. Here are a couple of changes I made: Use Brown sugar instead of white in the crust. I used the pudding recipe from Banana Pudding IV, it was richer and creamier because of the cream cheese and condensed milk in it. The coconut crust makes for a nice surprise in this pudding...I will definitely make it again.

This was a nice change from the old Nilla wafers and banana pudding mixture. We really liked the texture of the "crumblys". However, like other reviewers mentioned, it did NOT take 45 minutes to cook the crust...it definitely would have burned to a crisp!

I have made this four times already!  My family loves, loves, loves, it!  My husband says it is the only pudding dessert that he really likes.  The crunchy crust and topping is what makes this so special and it is so easy to make.  Making another pan today.  Thanks for a great recipe, VJANE!

A complete success!  It gave the traditional old banana pudding just the right kick it needed.  Very tropical tasting!

The toasted coconut mix was phenomenal.  I will try this "crust" with my baked banana pudding recipe instead of vanilla wafers.  Thanks for this amazing recipe.

This coconut crust is a delicious twist from the usual vanilla wafers.  For ease and speed, I combined cold butter, flour and sugar in the food processor and processed until blended.  I then added the coconut with my fingers to make the crumbly crust.  Should you do this, please be sure not to add the coconut in with the flour mixture and process in the food processor.  Not only is this an easy recipe and a visually appealing dessert, but tastes great.  I wouldnâ€™t hesitate to serve to company.

Very good banana pudding recipe with the coconut. I actually lightened it by using fat free milk with pudding, light butter and fat free cool whip. Kids ate it up. Came together pretty easy just took a little time to cook the coconut crust.

This was yummy! It definitely didn't take 45 min to brown the coconut mixture. It would have burned if left in that long. I wonder how to turn the coconut mixture into a regular pie crust? I thought about trying it but decided to stay with the recipe.

I made this with the first four ingredients, the "Extra Special" part and it really was!  I made the Banana Pudding IV from this site for the pudding part.  I don't make pudding often but whatever flavor I'll make in the future, adding the first four ingredients this way will be part of it.  I did stir in part of it so that the crunchiness will be throughout.  Everyone just raved about this one!  Thanks for sharing.

This banana pudding is a nice change from the traditional vanilla wafers.  I love the incorporation of coconut and crunchy topping.  The next time around I will also double the banana pudding amounts, as suggested in another review/rating. Great recipe!

Oh, this was fabulous!  I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, instead.  I used unsweetened coconut for the topping and threw the pan in the oven along with a pumpkin pie I was baking at 350.  It took about 20 minutes to brown, stirring every 5 minutes.  I used Sugar-free White Chocolate pudding because it was all I had on hand, and 4 bananas because they NEEDED to be used up.  I love the topping.  I think this could easily be turned into a pie by using a graham cracker crust, then layering the pudding, bananas, and Cool Whip, then sprinkle with the topping.  Delish!

This is delicious! Everyone needs to try it. Next time I will prepare it without bananas and just slice them and put them on top of individual servings since it is a large amount of dessert and the bananas will start to brown after a few hours.

I cut the recipe in half. I used vanilla pudding. The crust/topping was great! My husband liked it! My 2 year old loved it, but my other two kids wouldn't try it. It reminded  me of a coconut cream pie. Yum!

Loved this recipe!  My husband would have eaten the whole dish if I let him - no way that was going to happen!  I halved the recipe since there is only two of us otherwise I followed it exactly.  This is definitely a keeper and will serve to company in individual parfait bowls.  Thanks for the recipe.
