I took a lot of liberties with this recipe, all of which turned out great.  I added 1 cup of uncooked long grain rice and 1.5 cups water to the bottom of the casserole dish.  I used turkey-smoked sausage to lower the fat content.  I omitted the peas and mushrooms and sliced up two small zucchini instead.  I used frozen corn instead of canned.  And I used a teaspoon of Italian seasoning instead of the bay leaf and thyme.  It was GREAT and the whole family loved it.  Very hearty!

Despite the rave reviews, my family did NOT like this casserole. It promised more than it delivered. The peas and corn were unnecessary and added nothing; the flavors were obscured by the red pepper flakes. I won't make this again.

I'm giving this 5 because I loved it so much and it was so simple. I also took many liberties with this recipe, but since I followed the main idea of this recipe it deserves the credit. I cooked some chopped bacon in the bottom of a large pot, then cooked 1/4 of a med white onion, chopped (replaced shallot, bc I had the onion on hand already and wanted to use up the last of it) the garlic, and some diced raw carrots I had. I cut my sausage into quarter circles about 1/2" thick and put those in the pot to brown. I added a can of diced tomatoes, some leftover spaghetti sauce (maybe about 1/3 c.), and whatever frozen veggies I could dig out of my freezer. Peas, corn, green beas, broccoli, cauliflower, and spinach. I thawed and strained the spinach most of the way. I like the taste of spinach so I did leave it somewhat moist and it added a nice flavor. I added the green onions last, and then seasoned with a large bay leaf, italian seasoning, sea salt, and pepper. I simmered everything for about 10 or 15 minutes, until all the veggies were warmed through and some of the liquid had cooked off. I decided to not do this in the oven because I didn't want to risk overcooking the vegetables. I liked the addition of the spinach and would recommend it. Served over white rice. Wouldn't have thought to make a goulash like this. Very tasty.

This is one of the worst things I've ever made.  Thank goodness I had enough sense to cut back on the red pepper, but even so, it was almost too hot to eat.  The thyme flavor is much too strong, and overall there is nothing good about this dish, not even the pieces of smoked sausage I picked out of it in desperation.   What a waste.

I was wondering what was missing in this recipe until I read the other reviews of where rice was added. Also, how can you have a casserole without cheese? This reminds me more of soup.

Spicy Sausage Casserole Haiku: "K, on what planet, would kids love to eat this dish? Too much crushed pepper!" I actually reduced the red pepper and still this was fiery, so alas, the kid (as well as the adults) did NOT love this. Also, I'm at a loss as to why this went into the oven and was referred to as a casserole. Simmering in the skillet was ... well, the same thing that came out of another dish to wash that was in the oven. Besides using less red pepper, I also only had 8 oz. of smoked sausage so I subbed the other half w/ sliced squash. I also used fresh mushrooms and thyme, so I lightly-sauteed the mushrooms w/ the onion, garlic and squash. The only positive qualities of this meal were that it was colorful and the smoked sausage was tasty. I wouldn't even know where to start w/ revamping the leftovers so I'm sad to say that they'll be tossed.

Very good. Added instant brown rice to bottom of casserole pan with some water before putting in everything else. Used fresh mushrooms, deleted the peas.  Everyone liked it, will make again.

I almost didn't take a chance making this recipe because of the huge swings between "loved it" and "never again". Thankfully the positive reviews, added to the relatively inexpensive ingredients and modest prep time, were convincing enough for me to risk it.

Other than frozen peas, I had everything. The peas weren't noticeably missed and even though peas are well liked in this house I don't know that I'd include them. Using one less ingredient, cutting a little time and cost too, is considered a win.

With the peas omitted the corn is still a starch, but we like rice, so I took the suggestion of adding a cup of rice but used 1.5 cups of beef bullion. Although the original recipe doesn't call specifically for salt, I found I needed a little more. I waited until right before transferring everything to the baking dish and salted to taste, (a tsp. m/l).

This recipe is very good. It's exceptional as far as ease, affordability, and hearty taste. Along with a green vegetable or simple salad it's a winner in this house.

I really like this recipe and it is a staple in our house. I never add the mushrooms because neither my husband or son would eat it if I did but I really think the would add a lot. I follow the recipe pretty closely however, I have made substitutions based on what I have in the house using onions (red, yellow and vidalia) instead of the shallot.  Beans instead of the peas. I've used all sorts of sausages too. Keilbasas and brats, spicy italian sausages and smoked sausages.

Looks more like a stew than a casserole but nonetheless is very delicious.  I added 3 bay leaves instead of 1 for more flavor.  Very tasty!!!

A delicious and healthy dish.  A warning dish for winter. 
 Like other  reviewers, I  followed the basics of the recipe with a variety of substitutions. I skipped the mushrooms and put cubed zucchini  and chopped spinach instead.  As we enjoy well spiced dishes, I also started with a whole chopped onion and added garlic and chopped green chili. 
The result was delicious.  Both my husband and I  enjoyed the dish with hot corn bread on the side.

I have an idea. If you make a recipe follow it. THEN make adjustments later! Different foods react differently together and can completely change the flavor. Almost every review I see is a perversion of the original. If you're not going to follow the recipes, why are you here? I've experimented on many after making the original. Once you change ingredients, it doesn't qualify as the same dish anymore! I know I'm wasting my time. I'm sure most of you find Olive Garden to be great Italian food. Or, Red Lobster to be great seafood. I digress, try the original recipe first. If you don't like it, then create your version. You aren't giving yourself the chance to broaden your horizons!

LOVE this!!!!
At first, when I saw the recipe, I thought it would be blah. Man was I wrong! I love spicy so this was right in my wheel house. I made it 3 different ways. 1. exactly as written with rice on the side, 2. I followed another reviewers advice and added the rice to the bottom of the baking dish, and 3. Added quinoa to the bottom instead of rice. I also forgot the peas TWICE but they weren't really needed. Mushrooms and peppers though, a definite must (I used orange and yellow). I also added fennel to one and it added a nice touch. I can't believe this got bad reviews. I might use egg noodles or some other pasta next time. There will be a next time. Thanks Mardi

Hello from Spain. In order to use smoked sausage, I would have to drive to a Dutch spermarket (some distance off), so I used a mixture of the local sausages. The spiciness of the pepper flakes does somewhat overshadow all the other ingredients. It looked good, tasted fiery and there was more than tenough for the two of us.
Would I cook it again...possibly ? However,  less spicy, I would think.

I cooked this all together in a cast iron skillet.  I cooked the sausage first (I had 3 brats), then added two sliced carrots, 2 slices of onion (chopped), a can of chopped stewed tomatoes, 1/2 c of frozen corn and peas and 1/2 can green beans.  There wasn't much liquid so I added about 1 c water so that it could simmer together and cook the carrots and onion.  I added about 1/2 t each salt, pepper, parsley, red pepper flakes and a dash of oregano and two green onions.  I threw in about 1 c of leftover spaghetti sauce that I had leftover like Aly suggested.  It simmered for about 20 minutes and then sered it over rice.  Very tasty.

This was ok, but I want to try to tweak it a bit.  I used too much pepper.  I want to try to use beef broth and worcestershire instead.

This was not a very good recipe.  I tried adding some rice to cook along with it, but it just didn't turn out.  My family did not like this, and I won't be making it again.

I made this recipe last night, but did serve it over brown rice and omitted the thyme and basil leaf and subbed with Italian seasoning.  My husband thought it was good.
