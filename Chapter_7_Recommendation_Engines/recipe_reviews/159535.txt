This is a really fun recipe to put together.  I used left over lamb from a roast instead of ground lamb.  I also misread the ingredients and used ricotta cheese, instead of "ricotta salata" with which I'm not familiar.  I made it in a casserole dish instead of a 9x13 - I think with the amount of vegetables it would have been really hard to make 2 layers in such a big pan.  The spaghetti squash makes a wonderful substitue for pasta in what would have been a lasagna type dish.  Very flavorful and we will definately make again!

My family LOVED this recipe, had seconds and even wanted to take the leftovers to school/work for lunch!! I didn't have the right cheese so I added feta and homemade salsa with the tomato sauce...yum! A winner of a recipe!

Very good! I was looking for something different to do with my spaghetti squash and I am glad I found this recipe. I used lean ground beef instead of lamb because that was what I had at home. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and loved it!
