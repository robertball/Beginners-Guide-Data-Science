Against my better judgement after reading the reviews, I decided to try these anyway.  I'd give them zero stars if I could.  I had to salvage these - they were so dry!  I started with more lemon juice and they still didn't taste right.  Then I added red wine vinegar which helped a bit.  I then added granulated garlic and then dill weed and they finally tasted a *bit* good.  I will not make these again.  The sour cream is just too bland for deviled eggs, in my opinion.

The lemon is way too overpowering, I should have read the last review. Plus, I don't know how much I liked lemon and curry mixed together. It lack a rich creaminess too. I found by replacing the sour cream with mayo and eliminating the lemon all together you got some really yummy curry deviled eggs and those hit the spot.

I made these last night to serve today.  But I don't think I'm going to!  I decreased the lemon juice a bit in the first place but even this morning all you can taste is the lemon. Last night I could even detect a bit of the curry flavour but this morning - nothing - just lemon - no egg taste, no curry taste... I liked the idea of the sour creme instead of mayo and it did make the filling light - too light as there was very little body. How to rescue this dish? I don't know. I will watch with interest other reviewers comments.  Hopefully someone will like it and/or make some suggestions.  sorry

Sorry but these eggs were bad, no one ate them, you just cannot replace good old-fashioned mayo with sour cream in a deviled egg dish, very bland.

I realized at the last minute I didn't have curry powder. paprika or worchestershire sauce so I substitued miracle whip and they were great.
