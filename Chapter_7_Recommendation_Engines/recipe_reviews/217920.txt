FANTASTIC!!  At first, I was a little hesitant to try this, one doesn't usually associate tuna and pizza, but it was absolutely delicious.  The only change I made was to add two cans of tuna rather than one.  I would highly recommend this!

YUMMY! I love this recipe. I made a few changes after reading the reviews. Instead of cream cheese I used chipotle' ranch, sauteed red onion green & red peppers, and added cheddar cheese. Also, I used artisan crust

Very good!  We were looking for something different so gave this a try.  We made 2 smaller 7 inch pizzas, one that was the same basic recipe just with less cream cheese and one that had about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard mixed in with the cream cheese and then when it was done baking spread 1 -2 tablespoons of Mayo and sliced tomatoes on top.  Both were very good.  I highly recommend trying this.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Much like the true tuna pizza I had in Europe.  I only added two things: some sliced black olives and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning, just to give it a tad bit more flavor.  I also used tuna in water, not in oil, as I didn't want an overly greasy pizza.

Stumbled upon this recipe as I was looking for a different lunch idea with tuna. This fit the bill and was so yummy! I used this as an idea and used what we like and had on hand. Made my own crust, put tuna mixed with mayo, mustard and spices, then pickles and hot pepper rings. Topped with cheddar mozzarella mixture and baked. Deeeeelicios! Thanks for the idea, I never would have thought of it.

With such rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this one. I used a thinner wheat crust and 1 1/2 cans of tuna. I really like tuna, so there was no reason to hold back. This was the only way in which I did not follow the recipe. Unfortunately, my husband and I did not like this pizza. It just needed something more....flavorful (veggies, herbs?). I also thought the cream cheese was very overpowering. Maybe the suggestion to use 1/2 a package of cream cheese was a good one. I will not be making this one again. Sorry.

The taste of this pizza took me to trouter space, It was REALLY good, but it cod do better. I hope you all have a sea-riously good day. It was really hard to find the right fish for this pizza, but in the end i chose nemo. Maybe adding squid to the recipe would make it ink-credible. Let minnow when you update this recipe.

I never would have thought to use cream cheese for pizza sauce! This pizza was delicious and I usually don't like cream cheese, but the reviews convinced me to give it a try. I made a great tweak: I added minced garlic and onion powder to the cream cheese and let it sit for a few hours in the fridge before making the pizza. It was like having a white garlic sauce pizza, so yummy! We also ended up using a tad shy of two cans of tuna, too.

I was very skeptical of this recipe but since i liked all the ingredients it calls for i figured i'd try it.  it was delicious! i read some of the other reviews and used 2 cans of tuna.  To make it a little healthier i used a whole wheat crust, reduced fat cream cheese, and reduced fat mozzarella cheese. I most definitely encourage any tuna fans out there to try this!

Yum!!! Different and really good!  We used two cans per recommendations and that is a must.  I tossed the water packed tuna in a little olive oil and oregano, used reduced fat cream cheese and added capers to my husband's side.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for dinner tonight, and it is yummy, but I think I may just keep it in my Lenten dinner file. I made it on some naan bread I'd purchased, used one can of water packed tuna per pizza, and caramelized half a large red onion and one small white one (my husband won't go near a raw onion to save his life), and it was good. I had a pizza similar to this in Paris, and it is an acquired taste, but it's worth trying. My husband said he thought it tasted like a tuna melt, so maybe when I make this again, I'll add some finely diced tomatoes before the mozzarella. I have one pizza left, maybe I'll sprinkle some on that before I serve it. Good recipe, but it might be improved by some tinkering according to personal taste.

This is way better then it sounds. I added 2 cans of tuna as per the reviews. Next time, I'll change it up a bit. Not too shabby for a midweek dinner quick dinner.

I really wanted to like this recipe but I didn't.  I LOVED IT!!!  I made it as a personal pizza to try it first.  I actually made it for breakfast, don't judge, and it was great.  :)  I made a large one for lunch and topped it was a little parm.  Everyone enjoyed it and there were no leftovers.

It was not bad at all! Or maybe I was just too hungry ;) No, really, its pretty good, although I would prefer Shredder cheese instead of Mozzarella as it was a bit bland for me. Maybe that's the reason I also added some more red pepper after baking. 

Did I say I used wheat pizza crust? :) Well I just like it and it was still good and healthier :D

Next time I know how to make it better. YUMMM!!!

You really DO have to try this. I used the new Pillsbury Artisan Pizza Crust with whole wheat. It is an excellent crust for this pizza. Make sure to use thinly sliced onion on top of the cream cheese and use 2 cans of tuna. Then put chopped tomoato over the tuna and top it with 2 cups of pizza cheese. No need to precook the crust. Our kids like to put red pepper flakes on top before they chow it down.

OMG!!!  Who would have thought a tuna pizza could taste this good.  Its basically like having tuna on a giant cracker with cheese and your favorite toppings.  I didnt have cream cheese so I used sharp cheddar instead.  I also brushed the pizza dough with a mixture of melted butter and olive oil.  It made the crust supper crispy.  I will be making this again soon.

Great pizza!  Followed the recipe but used a homemade pizza crust.  I don't know what size a 14 oz. packaged pre-baked crust is but my pizza dough made about a 14" diameter crust.   Did not bake crust first just topped with specified ingredients and baked according to recipe.  Turned out perfect!  Will be making this recipe again and again and again.  Thanks Angie

Very good and easy! I only used 1/2 pkg of cream cheese (4 oz) and used 2 cans of tuna. Only other ingredient used (besides crust) was shredded cheddar cheese as that's what I had on hand. My 12 yr old son was scared to try it but he agreed it was pretty good.

Great Pizza!  I also only used a little bit of cream cheese and added green peppers to the mix.  I also love tuna with Kraft Light Asian Toasted Sesame Dressing.  I used that as a dipping sauce, although I may just drizzle it over the pizza next time.

I used Publix bakery pizza dough, letting it rest for an hour and then putting on an oiled cookie sheet, flouring and rolling out. I prebaked crust for 5 minutes. I only used half of the cream cheese. Baking the full 20 minutes.  Delicious!

We loved this recipe.  Because we try to eat very healthfully, I instead used a premade cauliflower pizza crust and Greek Yogurt Cream Cheese (higher in protein; lower in fat, but still  tastes great).  The crust was just large enough for the two of us (3 slices each), so used 1 can of the white albacore tuna packed in water, and that was perfect.   In addition to the sliced red onion, I added capers, red and green bell peppers and fresh sliced mushrooms. The capers added a nice zip to the overall flavor.  Living here in New Mexico, I'm going to try adding green chiles next time.   The frozen cauliflower pizza crust direction said to not thaw before cooking, and so I didn't.  The result was a flat-out delicious, healthful pizza that both my husband and I loved. And, no cauliflower taste to ruin it.  We will definitely be adding this to our monthly list of Gotta-haves!

My first thought was "eeeww," but then I realized that this is pretty much just a giant tuna melt and decided to give it a try. Expanding on the tuna melt theme,I used 2 cans of well-drained oil-packed tuna (water packed tuna isn't any healthier, since you're pressing out all the liquids anyway, and it's the mercury that will do you in, not the fat), added about 1/3 cup each of chopped onion and chopped celery, and baked about 5 minutes longer than the recipe states and it turned out quite tasty!

Not to keen on tuna so it was with hesitation that I made this pizza. I followed the instructions and everyone loved it. What a great find and easy to make :)

Hubby & I had a lot of tuna just sitting in the pantry for months. We wanted to get rid of some of it so we found this recipe. I wasn't sure if this was going to be good or not but it was delicious!! I made my own pizza crust using the Quick & easy pizza crust recipe from this website. I used mayonnaise instead of cream cheese (I'm not a fan of cream cheese), added Roma tomato slices, spinach leafs, baby portobello mushroom slices, some garlic & onion power, red pepper flakes, & used two cans of tuna. Will make again!

I made this recipe, but I had to make some changes because i didn't have some of the ingredients. Instead of pizza dough I used shortcrust dough. The only cheese I had in the house was feta cheese,  so I crushed some with a fork and sprinkled it on top, insead of mozzarella. LOVED IT! I'm gonna try it again, this and variations of it.

We first made this a few years ago. Since then, it has been a staple in my meal planning. My husband also loves it!

I never thought to put tuna on pizza, but it added a new flavor that was just amazing.  I changed the recipe up a little since I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I grated some creamy swiss cheese over the tuna, then added some olives along with the onions and mozzarella cheese.  I used a Boboli brand pizza crust and it turned out wonderful.

Surprisingly delicious! I made my own whole wheat pizza dough and used mayonnaise instead of the cream cheese.  Loved it and will make it again!
