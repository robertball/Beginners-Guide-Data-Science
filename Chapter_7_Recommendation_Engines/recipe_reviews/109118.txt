Great low calorie dessert. I took the previous reviewers advice and used 3 large frozen bananas (When I freeze bananas, I usually freeze three in a freezer bag at a time.) but instead of greek yogurt, I used FF plain yogurt and added just a little vanilla flavoring. I happened to be out of lemons or lemon juice at the moment but I did have an orange, so I used a little fresh orange juice and a little orange zest. I followed the directions as to how to prepare it only at the second freezing time, I poured the liquid into Snack Cup containers I'd cleaned and saved and stuck them into the freezer for an hour, then stuck the popsicle sticks into them and let them freeze the rest of the way. Great way for me to portion control and very low in calories and sugar plus it's a way to use up the bananas that ripen too quickly that I just stick in bags in the freezer.

Based on the other reviewers' experiences of this freezing solid, I set out with the expectation of making popsicles. I guess I had a happy accident because I was able to enjoy this in ice cream form within 5 minutes. I used ripe bananas that I had frozen previously, Oikos Greek yogurt with honey on the bottom (I left out additional honey), 1 TBSP lemonade instead of lemon juice thinking it would be too sour. I mashed it all up with a potato masher because I didn't want to bother with more dishes. Minutes later it looked too good to put away in the freezer. Very tasty and amazingly fast to pull together. I had a cup of "ice cream" right then and there and put the rest in ice cube trays with toothpicks for popsicles later. I will be making it again this way!

this sounded so good.  i wanted to love this recipe.  first i must say that i have never made ice cream or frozen yogurt of any kind before.  that said, this recipe as is was waaaay too sour.  i had to add quite a bit more honey and then it was still sour but had a very strong banana taste.  i happened to have a little bit of ricotta cheese in the fridge and some almonds so i blended them in.  at that point (and a few splenda packets) the flavor was better, but when this froze it turned into a solid block.  since i've never made this before i'll give it 3 stars to be fair.  but really, i would never make this recipe again.

Yum!  Don't be afraid to adjust this if you find it too sour.  Greek yogurt is very similar in consistency and taste to sour cream, so if you are expecting this to takste like a sweet yogurt dish, you might be disappointed.  It will also depend on the sweetness of your bananas as well.  I tasted it after blending, then added a tad more honey to make it a bit sweeter.  I also tossed in a splash of amaretto to hopefully address the hardness of the dessert.  We'll see if that works, but after freezing it for 20 min in my ice cream maker, I found this stuff to be delicious, and the consistency of soft serve ice cream!  Thanks for the recipe!

I added 1 oz of Brandy to keep it from freezing so hard. I also doubled the honey and added about 1/3c. of pure maple syrup along with about 1/2 c. chopped salted almonds. Not a low calorie dessert but low fat. I left out the lemon juice.

A great healthy alternative but was a little bland when made just as the recipe calls for.

These taste great and are an excellent alternative to birthday cake at a preschool (they discourage sugary cakes and sweets). My mixture was a little thin and I was having trouble keeping the popsicle sticks vertical. So, I set my 3 oz. dixie cups in muffin tins and covered everything with plastic wrap, taping the corners down so it would be taut. Then I cut slits in the wrap and slid the sticks down into the cups (see photo). Worked like a charm.  For the adults, I slipped a Nilla Wafer down into the mixture...a couple of calories well spent.

This is a great way to use up older bananas without making a cake. I just blend all the ingredients together, pop it into the freezer for an hour then use an ice cream maker to turn it into frozen yoghurt. Works beautifully.

I loved this, a great use for soft bananas, I had five bananas and a half cup of sunflower seeds.  Yum!
