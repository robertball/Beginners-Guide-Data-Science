My husband, also, called this a do-again.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins--the color contrast was very pretty and the lime and cranberry flavors are good together.  Loved how easy and pretty this is!

Wow, this salad is fantastic!  It's light and tangy and very flavorful. My entire family loved it and my husband declared that it's a "do again" meal.  I imagine that it is also good if you chill the chicken for a summertime salad.  Thanks Deb for sharing a great recipe.

VERY GOOD! I substituted sliced almonds for walnuts because of personal taste and they worked great. I will definitely be making this often.

Light, refreshing, tasty and good for you. This is a wonderful summer eve's salad. The only additions I made were 2cups romaine lettuce, 1/2 cup celery, and 1/2 cup purple onion. Thanks for a great recipe,Deb.

This salad was wonderful! With such simple ingredients, I was shocked at how good it tasted! The lime was not overpowering, but gave the salad such a wonderful flavor! The only change I made was to use dried cranberries instead of golden raisins. I don't care for them, so I don't ever have any around! I highly recommend this recipe; it is one of the best salads I've ever had!

This was great.  I didn't have any limeade concentrate but will try it next time. I toasted the walnuts and sprinkled everything with fresh cilantro.  Will definately make again - and often!

This recipe was pretty good, but it had A LOT of lime in it.  Next time I think I'll cut down on the amount of lime juice called for in the recipe.  Otherwise, it was light and tangy, and nice for a summer dinner.

Not bad, but not great. This was more of a light wedding shower type salad. The husband was not impressed. :(

Great lime flavor!  Not too overpowering but just right.  The chicken was really moist and tender.  Made a few minor tweaks-  grilled the chicken, used dried cranberries instead of raisins (what I had on hand), and thew in some strawberries.  Refreshing, light, and just a really good salad.

I loved the lime flavored chicken.  I would definitely recommend using the limeade.  It makes a delicious glaze on the chicken.  I left out the raisens and used glazed walnuts and it was fantastic.

I served this for lunch with a group of ladies who really liked it.  Instead of dividing the salad among four plates, I arranged it on a large platter for everyone to serve themselves, which made a really pretty presentation.

great salad.  thanks!  I didn't have golden raisins but used craisins.  I used baby spinach instead because I had it on hand. YUMMY salad!  I used another dressing for a lime strawberry salad that was poppy seed but I added strawberries to the dressing as well.  Basically I took ingredients I had on hand and made this recipe work in conjunction with another one.  Worked perfectly.. I am not very creative so I need these recipes to help me get started.  Thanks again!

This recipe was a wonderful jumping off point for a super, tasty change of pace!  My husband (picky eater!) ate every bite!  To cut down on time and on the ingredients I didn't have, I made some alterations:  no zest, no lettuce, no walnuts; substituted 1/2 t dijonnaise for mustard, only used 1/2 lb chicken, 1/4 c pine nuts added, 1 celery heart trimmed and chopped coarsely, 1/2 c dried cranberries, 1/4 c raisins, plus a few cranks of sea salt.  The dressing was prepared and all ingredients were tossed into a large glass bowl and the dressing poured over top.  Tossed salad a few times and served.  Took about 20 minutes.  Took my husband and I about 7 minutes to devour the whole thing!  He even ate the celery!  (Hates celery ;)  )    Mmmm!!!  Many Thanks to Deb Mitchell for this!  jkp

This was good - very tangy.  I didn't include the raisins, instead I used cranberries.  A unique chicken salad.

Great!  I didn't use the frozen limeade, and it wasn't even missed.  I cut the oil down to 1 Tbl, and added 1/4 tsp. salt with the pepper.  I used regular raisins; also, I toasted the walnuts first.  Thanks for the recipe!
