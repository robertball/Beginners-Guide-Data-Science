made this for Halloween this yr. when the neighbors come over & got rave reviews!  I used an entire can of pumpkin & double the pumpkin pie spice.  Even my husband said it was delicious & stopped home at lunch time asking for leftovers.

I'll admit, I was pretty skeptical of this recipe. Like so many people, I associate pumpkin with sweet desserts. Though in the back of my mind, I am fully aware that it is used in many savory recipes, I've never really gone there - until now. This was delicious. The pumpkin flavor is not overwhelming, but it's there, in the background, along with the pumpkin pie spice.  The only change I made was out of necessity - I didn't have quite enough tomato juice, so I used a little tomato sauce and water to round it out. I'll definitely be making this one again!

This was good, but not great.  A little plain for my taste.

I decided to choose this recipe over the other pumpkin chili recipes because it wasn't swimming in sugar. It was very similar to 2 others who each had 130+ ratings. 
I will be taking this to a potluck luncheon and won't label it "pumpkin" chili in case that seems to scare anyone off. HOWEVER,  I will be willing to share this recipe with everyone and will decorate around the crockpot with pumpkins.
The only modification I did was that I doubled the chili powder and am providing hot sauce and crackers on the side. I cannot wait to hear the reviews. I'm up against some gumbo. THROW DOWN and I'm gonna win!
This is an easy recipe, inexpensive and great for topping baked potatoes. To save money, make your own pumpkin pie spice. Check this website for the ingredients. :)
UPDATE: The chili pot was cleaned out! Many compliments. It's a keeper. :)

I fixed it as suggested and then decided to follow 'silverlies' changes. I really enjoyed the pumpkin taste so I wanted to make it more prominent. I'm looking forward to serving it to my Friday Philosophy Group soon.

This wasn't really to my liking. With the small amount of chili pepper, it was not as spicy as I like my chili to be. I sort of expected that and didn't increase it this time around to see how the flavors melded without it. Since the pumpkin flavor was not really noticeable, I think additional spice would have been a nice addition. I was hoping that the pumpkin pie spice would bring out more of the pumpkin flavor somehow, but it tasted more like chili without the usual spiciness. Still very flavorful. I omitted the sweetener; it is such a small amount...not sure if it would have made a big difference. This recipe would be good for those who want a chili that isn't super spicy.

My large family and the guests we had for dinner LOVED this chili and so did I.   It was a nice twist to a family favorite.  One of the guests said it was the best chili he ever had.

I've made this several times for potluck dinners and everyone always loves this chili!!  I substitute kidney beans for mixed bean medley because I don't like a ton of kidney beans and then I also get chickpeas, which I love.

Made for a Halloween party, and everyone loved it!  It was yummy - even to those who didn't think it sounded appetizing at first.

Delicious! I doubled the amount of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice (made my own) and result was a slightly sweet chili that's amazing over whole wheat elbow macaroni. I halved the recipe and came out with way more than 4 servings.

I generally make this with turkey and it's great! i will be trying quinoa instead next time I make it but I expect it will be excellent again.

This was so delicious. I have horrible reflux and this was mild enough that it did not hurt me. I used Sugar instead of Splenda, upped the pumpkin pie spice to taste and added a little brown sugar. It was a little blan before the additions. I served it with jiffy pumpkin corn bread! Yum! Definitely a keeper. Even my 4 year old and 10 month old ate it.

Made this for Halloween brunch, everyone who tried it liked even the host's picky bf.  I used the full can of pumpkin like some of the reviewers, and I never measure spices so I know I used more than the recipe calls for but I tend to like a lot of seasoning in my chili.
