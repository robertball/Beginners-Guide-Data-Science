This is excellent, just a few suggestions.
Add extra egg so the mixture will hold better after cooking and sprinkle the top with another 1/3 cup crumbled blue cheese.
thanks for a different meatloaf recipe.

We really enjoyed having this for dinner. Even my 2 year old ate this which usually if he sees any green vegetables he won't even try it. It had a lot of flavor and moist. I had a clove of roasted garlic that I had roasted and used that. It is nice to have a meat loaf recipe with a different flair. Plus I had all the ingredients already!

Very good. I added more blue cheese, because I wanted to taste it. Will make again.

There is a similar recipe to this on AR but it calls for the meatloaf to be baked in muffin tins and doesn't have the mushrooms.  I've made that one several times and am a fan.  I did have some mushrooms to use up so thought I would try this.  I halved the recipe as I only had 3/4 pound of ground beef to use.  This meatloaf is much more tender than the other.  I don't think there is enough blue cheese in it to really be able to taste it.  I glaze all my meatloaves with a combination of ketchup, brown sugar and Worcestershire.  Overall we enjoyed the meatloaf and will make it again.  Thanks!

Made this tonight.  Some changes of course.  I halved this recipe and used 12 oz. of ground turkey.  However, I kept the vegetable quantities the same as original so needed just a bit of extra bread crumb ( I used panko.)  Loved the texture and flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Also, served with homemade ratatouille made with all fresh farmers market veg.  Yum.

Very easy to make, and it tasted excellent. I would try to add another egg as suggested by DaCook to make it hold better. Will make again, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

An interesting twist on Meatloaf.  The blue cheese taste was not "blue cheesy".  It gave it a creamy, moist recipe.  It took a long time for this to cook.  Much longer than the recommended time.  And the recipe doesn't state whether it should be covered or uncovered.  Now that I know, I can plan my meal better.  But the taste was really good and really worth it!  Will make it again.

Followed the directions and this turned out great. Used a 90% lean and the only variation was extra cheese using a 50-50 split of bleu cheese and gorgonzola. Passing this on to friends.

This was a winner!  I upped the blue cheese to 1/2 cup and added a 1/4 parmesan, a tablespoon of mayo, and cooked it in four oval baking/serving dishes instead of a loaf pan.

Delicious! What a great addition to meatloaf: blue cheese, mushrooms and spinach! I did make some changes. I used two pounds of ground turkey, 3 eggs, subbed garlic and herb seasoning instead of onions and garlic and other seasonings, added extra blue cheese crumbles, and swapped blue cheese dressing for the milk for extra blue cheese flavor. I skipped the Worcester sauce since I didn't have any, and used Italian bread crumbs, for even MORE flavor. My house smells great!

This recipe deserves top marks in our book.  After following the instructions, it turned out moist and tasty.  This is not normal for meatloaf.

Thank you for creating this gem.  It will no only be made again, but will be recommended to others.  This comes from a Southern US  person who doesn't like meatloaf and a British bloke who never had such a concoction before.

Very nice and different from the normal meatloaf.  I kept to the recipe.  I loved the unique flavor.  I myself would cut back just a dash on the cayenne but my daughter said no it was just right.  We did both agree that we would add just a bit more blue cheese next time though.

I thought it was great! Only wished the top was a little more crusty.
