Wonderful recipe. My reasoning for the 4 star is the capers & dill.I made the recipe two ways. One without capers & dill. The one without the capers & dill seemed to be the favorite of the room. Most felt those ingredients actually overpowered the flavor. I will try again with a less amount of dill. I don't get the capers.
