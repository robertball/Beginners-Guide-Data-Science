It was delicious! Pre cooked some wild/basmati rice with veggie stock. For the fish topping used cherry tomatoes sautéed with onion and garlic.

Quite nice! used brown rice which I had already cooked for the bed as I wasn't sure if the minute rice would just soak up all the tasty sauce.

Tried this for the first time. I was a bit concerned there may not have been enough liquid for the rice and vegies, the texture and doneness was just fine. I did everything according the directions and the ingredients and my family absolutely loved it. Definitely will be making this one again.

I tried this and my family simple loved it. Instead of white wine i used sherry wine. I also used parboiled rice boiled 5 mins in chicken broth then I mixed in pan. It was simple delicious!!!

I used “Steamables” frozen brown rice and cooked in the microwave for 3 minutes as directed before adding to the dish since so many other reviewers suggested cooking it first and we used tilapia rather than sole. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was very flavorful and filling. The Roma tomatoes added great flavor. Overall, a very easy and tasty dish for dinner.

I tried this about a year ago, following the recipe exactly...even using Uncle Ben’s rice as suggested by the accompanying ad. The rice that was under the fish was still crunchy , as if it didn’t get any liquid into it to rehydrate. I made it again last week, but this time I poured the rice into the heated liquid and mixed it well before adding to the roasting pan. I also used Minute Rice this time. The result was so much better! Will definitely be making again using the second technique!

This was really yummy and I'm not much of a fish eater. Since I didn't have minute rice,  I cooked pretty much everything  but the fish and tomatoes in a saucepan first. I used 1 lb of pollack for the fish.  The tomatoes on top were a nice touch.  The spices and the tomatoes did a good job of disguising the fishy flavor and texture that I am not used to eating.  I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely loved the rice and veggie flavor, the fish was mediocre, a little bland. It was good for how easy it was

This was excellent. I didn't have any tomatoes so I didn't use that. I used Uncle Ben's Spanish rice since I had some that was open. I halved the recipe since there were only two of us. I forgot to halve the sauce except for the butter, I did manage to halve that and I am glad I did. It would have been way too much. When I cooked the dish I only used half of the sauce. I also cooked the rice ahead and cooked the onions, garlic and peppers for five minutes before adding to the rice. I cooked the rest of the sauce to reduce it and topped my fish with it. So yummy! I will definitely make this again. Great recipe.

This was quite nice.  I will make it again but..... it does need a bit more flavour I thought.  It's a good recipe though.  Also, I used normal rice and just added more liquid and let it cook longer.

Great easy fish recipe; I made it with pre-cooked brown rice and it turned out a little soupy.  Will by trying it with a little less broth tonight to account for the rice already being cooked.

This was okay, but rather bland.  I followed other reviewers advice and cooked my rice pilaf almost all the way through before cooking in the oven.

Everything turned out fine except for the rice!  Pay attention to the reviews that said that used cooked rice - that's absolutely essential!  Instant rice (I used Uncle Ben's) just doesn't have enough time or liquid to cook properly!  Also, the 15 minutes of prep time is ridiculous - give yourself at least 1/2 hour to prep the veggies.

Well, in short, Yum! Well, my husband didn't like it (but he says he doesn't like fish!) I was anxious to try this, as it had no bad reviews or change suggestions. Well, someone mentioned cooking the rice ahead (which I did). I made a few substitutions, but purely out of necessity. I couldn't get sole, so used orange roughy. I used cooking sherry- no white wine. Oh, and I accidentally got green pepper. I don't know if red bell was called for because of color or taste, but it was still good- and colorful! I was surprised that the tomato was not merely decorative, but added a nice flavor. Once again, it made a nice, colorful presentation. I also loved having the side dish built in! The butter sauce may have 'slid' off- I sprinkled a little garlic powder on my serving after cooking. Ok, one more little thing: I like my veggies crisp, but it would have been nice if the bell pepper had been just a little softer. In summary, a great dish!!
