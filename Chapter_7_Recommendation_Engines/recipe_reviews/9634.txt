It was too soft for what the amount of ingredients called for and even though I left it in the fridge overnight, it was almost just right but when using cookie cutters, the dough stuck to everything, no matter how much flour I used.  This is definitely not for cookie cutters.  Even after moulding it in circles, the kids ate only one and didn't like it.

My cookies came out great.  I haven't made cookies in over a decade and this is a simple basic cookie recipe.  I added a pinch of salt and a couple of drops of almond extract to my eggs and my recipe was scaled down to 12 servings instead of 48.  The dough is very soft so I molded mine by hand and put pineapple jam in the center.  They were very yummy shortbread cookies with jam.

I did as one of the reviews said and used some flavor & no seed but chopped pecans. 
I would recommend this Recipe.
