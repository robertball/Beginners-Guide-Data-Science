I had some leftover prosciutto from another recipe and found this, and it was perfect. Loved the flavor.

This dish was FANTASTIC! My first experience cooking with prosciutto and even the picky hubby LOVED IT! I would suggest cutting the amount of peas down to half a cup unless you REALLLY LOVE peas, and adding a clove or two of fresh chopped garlic. Sprinkled feta cheese on top and used cherry tomatoes, halved. WILL DEFINITELY make this again! Remember, prosciutto is salty so this dish requires no additional salt added.

Great base for a recipe.  I too used olive oil instead of butter.  I also added yellow squash since we've had a bumper crop for our garden.  Quick and easy-tastes terrific!

While this had a very nice smokey flavor, we felt it could have done with some sauce, perhaps a mild alfredo. This definitely has enormous potential. Thanks!

Great recipe! We loved the flavor and simplicity of this. Tastes like it took longer to prepare than it did. Followed the recipe exactly.

I was a bit disappointed with the flavor or this dish.  It just seemed that there wasn't one.  It was easy and quick to prepare.

This was very, very good. The only thing I changed, is I used capers in place of peas. I'm just not a big "pea" person, yet I love capers. It turned out great -- the dish was a hit with the whole family, and I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. I think it would be great with capers instead of the peas.

This was really good.   I gave it 4 stars because I switched it up a bit.   I used olive oil instead of butter, added chopped red peppers, green onions and mushrooms.   I did take out the peas because I don't like them.  Added Parmesan cheese after blending the pasta and sauce together.  Very yummy!  Would highly recommend for a quick meal. All added ingrediates could be purchased pre-chopped to make it even faster.

My husband and I loved this!  I substituted chicken broth for the white wine since he doesn't usually like wine based sauces and I also used capicolla ham instead of prosciutto.  Added a little minced garlic and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. The broth and kick of the capicolla made the taste perfect.  Served with garlic bread.  Quick and easy, this recipe is a keeper!

I added a cup of evaporated milk, and grated Parmesan on top. Yummy! I will definitely make it again!

Very nice dish to enjoy.

However I used a sauvignon blanc for the recipe and felt the proportion was too much - the pot definitely smelled like alcohol. So maybe either create a white wine reduction or just use less than recipe calls for.

Also, the prosciutto was overpowered by everything else in the recipe. Perhaps a good idea would be to top the pasta with small, thin slices instead of saut√©ing it with the butter and onions.
