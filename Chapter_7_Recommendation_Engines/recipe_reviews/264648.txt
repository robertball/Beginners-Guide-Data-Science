My son loves this recipe!  And an easy week night meal.  I make the marinade in the morning and marinate meat all day.

Made as written and I really liked these. To me though they had more of an Asian flair rather than Mexican. I will say they were a lot more tender than the other recipes I made and they all marinated for the exact same amount of time. I made this for a friends Mexican celebration. They liked them but also preferred one of the other recipes I made that used sazon and beer in the marinade. Overall I was pleased with this and will make it again.
