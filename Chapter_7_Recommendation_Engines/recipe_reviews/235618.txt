This is not your typical cranberry sauce - it was easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I brought the cranberry sauce to a Thanksgiving Dinner and everyone loved it; even someone who doesn't usually like cranberry sauce at all.  I won't wait till Thanksgiving to make this again.

Brought this to family Thanksgiving dinner and it was a fantastic!  Next time i might try with pecans instead of walnuts just for kicks.  Also great just with vanilla ice cream or a slice of apple pie or cheesecake.

we're happy we stumbled upon this but had to make some changes due to what we had on hand and personal preference.. we used closer to 1/4 and 1/8 cup of maple syrup (grade a) and 1/2 cup of fresh orange juice.. left out the sugar as it was sweet enough for us.. but we don't care for overly sweet foods.. we followed everything else to a T.. bf says this reminds him of Honey Baked's cranberry walnut chutney and it's just as good.. we tried some on a chip with  lactose free cream cheese and it was awesome.. ty for the recipe

Thank you Chef John, this was well accepted in my home. I normally make the basic one on the site with just oj and sugar. I liked the texture of the added walnuts. I followed the recipe, but subbed a sweet red Reisling for the port wine as it was what I had. I accidentally forgot the orange zest and it was still fine. I wasn't sure how I would like the ginger, so I just did about 1/2 tsp of ginger paste from a tube. I also didn't bother with the toasting of the walnuts. It is very rare that un-shelled nuts don't come already slightly roasted today. I look forward to seeing how well the leftovers hold up. Interesting recipe on basic cranberry sauce.

Yes, and it is fantastic!  As a non-cook, I found the recipe easy to follow and it didn't call for too many ingredients.  Bravo!

Delicious, easy, and the fresh smells carried throughout the house. The fresh ginger and orange zest added great flavor and smell. The only modifications I made were about half the sugar because I did not have fresh squeezed o.j. and I used a red blend instead of port wine. The walnuts were great but my family doesn't love them as much as I do so next year I will had a half cup and chop them finer.

My husband's reaction, "It tastes like Christmas!" That pretty much sums it up.  It's sweet and crunchy and wonderful.  But if I make it again, I'll cut the ginger to a tsp. and leave out the grated orange peel or just add a dash, those flavors overpowered the others and it tasted a lot like orange marmalade. I will make it again with those changes.

We made this for our family Thanksgiving last Saturday. I had my husband make it and it was a big hit. Not sure if it would really gel correctly if the sugar or maple syrup were reduced.  It as a health conscious person I would like to try that.

Tips: use a lower heat to keep from burning the nuts.  Grinding fresh Ginger produces fibers.  Use the oranges you zest for the juice.  This recipe made an excellent cranberry sauce!

delicious flavor, can't stop eating it! May cut back a little on the amount of walnuts next time. Also, didn't use quite as much maple syrup as the recipe calls for and it's still plenty sweet for my dh, who can't handle things too tart. Love how easy it is to make and keep. Can't wait to share with the whole crew on Thanksgiving!

I did not have fresh nutmeg so used dried nutmeg. I did pick the cranberries from the bog near my house.  The maple syrup I made last year. So good.

WOW. Not a fan of sweet cranberry sauce. This was a perfect combination of sweet and tart. The little zing of ginger was a nice surprise.  Made a cheesecake for Thanksgiving just to try this as a topping. Double WOW

I made this for thanksgiving and it was good.  I'm not sure I like having nuts in my cranberry sauce, so I most likely will eliminate that ingredient in the future.
