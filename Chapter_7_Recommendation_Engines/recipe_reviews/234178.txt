What makes this Asiago Dip? It has no Asiago cheese? Is there a printing mistake? I rated it a one because the title doesn't fit the ingredients. I really am looking for an Asiago Cheese Bread Bowl Dip.

The cooking time seems way off to me.  Ninety minutes to 2 hours at a 350 oven just seems way too long.

The dip does not need to be "cooked" since all the ingredients are safe to eat without raising to a specific temperature, but you are heating the dip through.  I would say it takes a minimum of 1 hr to get it luke warm in the center, I go closer to 90 minutes to get it heated evenly. I would cover it with aluminum foil until the last 20 minutes to keep it from browning too much on the top.
