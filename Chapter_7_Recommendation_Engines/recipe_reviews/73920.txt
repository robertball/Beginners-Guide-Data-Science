This is a nice recipe, however, by adding some chopped fresh basil or coriander/cilantro..it becomes outstanding. Green peppers tend to have a stronger flavour, so try substituting red peppers, or better yet..roasted peppers!! Bottled Italian dressing is usually salty, pungent and generally nasty. Suggest that a  vinaigrette such as Dijon, Lemon or Balsamic be used as a better tasting and wonderful alternative. Throwing in some chopped sun dried tomatoes is also a nice addition. Pasta salad is so versatile that it lends itself to a variety of additions.

The quality of the outcome of this recipe depends SO MUCH on the dressing used....I used a Garlic Herb Italian Vinegrette, and it was great!!  Also subbed canned asparagus for the fresh(none to be found at the market),, a roasted red pepper for the green(more mellow taste), regular hothouse tomato instead of cherry(ditto on the lack thereof), frozen broccoli florets(added to pasta water), added a few secret spices of my own, and used asiago cheese(more mellow flavor, and not EIGHT DOLLARS A POUND!).  After sampling, sold for $25 at our Kiwanas auction.  Definately a keeper with tweaking!

This was wonderful!  I used a box of whole wheat rotini pasta by Muellers.  I also used Good Seasons natural italian salad dressing.

This has been a staple at our weekend parties. Our friends love it. I skip the meat and broccoli and add artichokes. I add different veggies depending on what is available to cut up. Delish!

I used spiral whole wheat pasta and only used 1/2 of what it called for. I think five minutes for the asparagus may have been a minute or so too long. I steamed some frozen chopped broccoli and added to the noodle mixture. I doubled the amount of meat, using heavily seasoned (garlic powder, basil, paprika, and 1/2 a chopped onion) ground chicken breast. I used garbonzo beans, no olives, and a roasted red bell pepper. I didn't have any tomatoes. I used a little parm and shredded low fat monterey jack. For the dressing, I cut it in half and did a 1/4 cup honey mustard and 1/4 light zesty Italian dressing. I chilled it and when we got home from a late evening in church, we had a wonderful dinner!

This was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a can of whole olives and cut them in half. I may have added a bit more asparagus than called for and I threw the asparagus and broccoli in with the noodles when there was 4 minutes left instead of 5.

I think the wonderful thing about this recipe is how quick and easy it is, not to mention cheap.  I ALL of the ingredients for under 10 dollars.  Also it makes a very large amount.  I think it is best kept simple, and is still delicious.

Excellent salad!  For a little more kick, I added a teaspoon of Italian spaghetti spice mix and a few cloves of garlic.  It was very well received by my family!

I didn't add chicken and I forgot to cook the veggies.  Even so, it was very good.  My husband also loved it and he isn't even very big on veggies.  I will definitely make this again and again.

This made a great summer meal - using up some leftover chicken.  I didn't add the feta cheese (UGH) or the kidney beans which I didn't have.  I'll make it again.  The recipe said it fed 24 people.  I don't see how that is possible.  We all ate more than our share!

I've made this dish a dozen times, and always love it.  I find I have to add the broccoli and asparagus a little earlier than they recommend.  Recently instead of store-bought dressing I've used the Italian Dressing Mix recipe from this site, and it's a definite improvement.  I like to keep the salt content in that dressing low, but I compensate for that here by just adding extra feta.  Makes a large quantity and goes a long way!

We really enjoy this dish.  Made as is or altered depending on what is in the frig.
