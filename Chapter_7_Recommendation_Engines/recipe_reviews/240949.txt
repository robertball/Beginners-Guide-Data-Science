I am the author of this recipe. FYI, I usually use a little more than one can of pie filling, so I suggest buying two cans. My husband likes it with blueberries and I like strawberries, so often I make half with blueberries and half with strawberries. Also, make sure the crust is cooled completely, otherwise the filling will kind of "melt". There weren't any recipes anything like this on the site when I first submitted it, I see a couple now. Funny thing is, I submitted it in 2008 (yes, 2008!) and it JUST got published now in January 2015. So technically, mine was first, lol ;) Hope you enjoy!

Very good! As suggested by others used 3/4 stick of butter and pulsed 4 cups of pretzels in the blender for the crust. Used 1/2 cup powdered sugar instead of a cup and an 8 oz. lite whip cream. Used almost 2 cans of cherry pie filling. Tastes even better the next day!

I love this recipe! It's super easy and I use gluten free pretzels which are surprisingly good (i eat every thing but i make it GF for family members) I also use fresh strawberries and blue berries on top instead of the pie filling. Oh and I also make it in cupcake form so much less mess when eating especially if you're making it for an event!

I grew up eating this! Pot lucks, family gatherings, holidays, you name it! Some always made at least one of these! Love them! So easy and yummy! Sweet and salty together, it dont get no better! Glad I found this, a little different than what I recall Mom making it but  pretty much the same! Thanks for posting it!

DELICIOUS and EASY!! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. The whipped cream mixture is sinfully good. The ONLY thing I would maybe do a LITTLE differently would be to make the pretzel layer a bit thicker, but other than that, it's FANTASTIC! Thank you!

I sprinkled some crushed pretzels on top, otherwise I changed nothing! This is the exact recipe I was taught in high school home ec. class back in 1964, and it is perfect! Thank you!

Even though I added extra butter, this crust was still very crumbly. A very sweet dessert.

Was great. The salt and sweet combo had people coming back for thirds! Will definitely use the pretzel crust idea with other desserts

I paired this up with the stuffed pork tenderloin recipe and it was also a hit. It was a small dinner party and needed something sweet but easy to make. The only change I will make in the future is use ginger snap cookies instead of the pretzels as the crust since it was for a Christmas Dinner Party. Again there was some leftover and my guest took home the desert since it was so good.

I agree whole heartedly on adding a second can. I also upscale the crust 50% (my fav part). Thank you for the easy to follow instructions. Great post.

update: We ate a piece and this is a keeper for sure.  Love the pretzel saltiness with the sweet. I  used less powdered sugar and only had an 8 oz container of cool whip. Like others I used more cherries, about 1 3/4 can.
