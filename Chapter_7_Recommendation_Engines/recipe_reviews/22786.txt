I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes until it flaked, instead of microwaving it.  Easy and tasty.

I made this as directed, except I made it on a George Foreman grill, and instead of using butter, I used butter flavored cooking spray. Delicious! and very heart healthy!!

I love Haddock because it tastes so much like cod, but I would never put a good piece of fish into the microwave. Instead, we placed the fish in foil, added the seasonings, including onion/garlic powder and lemon pepper. I cut back on the butter and then placed the fish on the grill. With all the food there was at our Fathers Day party, this was the first to go. Thanks for a good start.

This is one of our favorite ways to do Haddock. But Do Not microwave the fish.!! Much better on a foil lined cookie sheet, or 13 x 9 dish in a 350 degree oven for 25 - 30 minutes till fish flakes easily with a fork. I always serve this with macaroni & cheese. Every one in our house likes this recipe from the 2 yr old & up. You can also use this recipe on the grill.  Put your fish in tightly wrapped foil and grill.

I can't believe how many of you didn't take advantage of cooking this in the microwave!  I will say that I probably wouldn't have cooked it this way if I didn't have a turntable.  It really helps in cooking the fish evenly.  I used white swai, a spice called, "lemon butter w/ dill" (I got at a spice shop) sprinkled on both sides along w/ a little parm just on top.  Then I used three thinly sliced pats of butter evenly spaced on each fillet.  Total would be abt. 3 Tbsp.  (So 1/2 c. of butter is w-a-y too much!)  Cover w/ a plastic cover like you use when microwaving liquids and microwaved for 3 min.  Then gently turn over and put the outside edge of the fish inward, keeping the thickest part on the end of the dish and cook another 3 min.  Depending on the thickness of your fillets, you might need another couple of min. but that's all!  It was flaky and juicy and so flavorful!  Plus, it didn't heat up my kitchen while it's 90 outside!

The fish was very tasty.  the lemon-buttery taste is great.  I baked it at 375 for about 15 minutes instead of putting it in the microwave.    The reason I gave it 4 stars and not five is due to the fact that it is messy to serve.  This type of fish just tends to fall apart very easily.  Next time i'm going to try this sauce on salmon.

This was so easy and delicious.  I didn't have any lemon pepper but it didn't matter.  Also, I used fresh cut dill. I did what one of the reviewers suggested and baked it in the oven.

I've always loved and relied upon a similar version of this for a quick and delicious fish dinner (cod, or any mild, white flaky fish can also be used).  However, I love a golden brown color so I always give it a a shake of paprika and bake quickly on high heat, about 15-18 minutes at 400 degrees. The lemon pepper seasoning on fish was something new for me and it was interesting to try.  It was okay, but for me a little overpowering.  I'll stick with the lemon juice, dill, garlic or California garlic salt, paprika, and salt and pepper.  This recipe has great potential but unfortunately gets only three stars from me for the microwaving and the lemon pepper, neither of which are positive contributions.

Sorry but in my opinion this was a waste of nice, fresh haddock fillets.  Neither one of us like this.  It was dry and bland and will not make again.  In my opinion the only way to cook fresh haddock fillets is dipped in egg and flour and pan fried til golden, now that's good.

The microwaving of the fish did not bring in the flavours of the condiments, I have tried marinating the fish over night but microwaving just makes the fish soggy!

This has the most delicious, delicate texture and taste. I used about 2 tablespoons of fresh baby dill, 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon thyme (from my garden), coarsely chopped. Poured a tiny bit of the butter in the baking pan, the swai (Asian catfish) fillets in the butter. I then brushed the remaining butter over the fillets. The chopped herbs are sprinkled on, followed by freshly ground peppercorns (thus lemon-pepper), then I sprinkle just a little fresh lemon juice (1 tsp per fillet) on. Bake at 350 for 25 minutes and it will melt in your mouth. I served it with baked potatoes with fresh chives from my garden and sour cream, and a big green salad. To die for - and the kind of meal you pay a lot of money for at a fancy gourmet restaurant!

Delicious!  However, I, too, baked it in the oven on 350 for 25 minutes.  I am not a big fish eater, and I will definitely make this again.  My husband loves it!!  Thanks so much!

I MAKE THIS WITHOUT THE LEMON PEPPER, ADD PAPRIKA, PARSLEY, BUTTER AND LEMON JUICE. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE "POORMAN'S LOBSTER". MAKE SURE YOU COVER THE DISH "TIGHT" WITH SARAN WRAP, AND WE COOK OURS FOR ABOUT 10 MINS, 15 IF A BIT FROZEN YET IN THE MIDDLE. OURS ALWAYS TURNS OUT FLAKY, IF YOU BAKE IT THE FISH IS OFTEN TOUGH. THIS IS SOFT AND DELICIOUS. HADDOCK IS BETTER THAN COD FOR THIS RECIPE. NO OTHER WAY TO MAKE THIS FISH!

Very good! I used much less butter otherwise followed the recipe. Used Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper seasoning, I love that stuff. Baked at 350 for about 20-25 min instead of microwaved.

I tried this recipe last night and it was delightful. I did cut back on the butter a bit and added some stock as it cooked in the oven for 15 minutes. I served it with some wild rice and steamed vegetables.

This is the first recipe I've tried on here and bravo!  The only thing, I did not microwave this dish (surprise, surprise)--I made individual little packets using parchment paper on a baking dish.  I also used butter and olive oil instead of straight butter.  It came out heavenly and smelled so good when opening the packets!  My four year old loved it.  Good with steamed asparagus and baby peeled new potatoes.

We used fresh walleye and grilled in tin foil verses microwaving. I also added some fresh thyme and used half the butter. Very classic taste, an easy dish that you can modify in so many ways.

Just bleh- not much taste. I know plenty of four-ingredient recipes that beat this recipe hands-down. Don't bother with it.

This was sooo good!  Although I did bake it at 400 degrees and I added some Rtiz Crackers on top of it... YUM!

This recipe saved my skin for supper tonight!  Defrosted the fish under cold water for 10 minutes, and followed the recipe as written.  Not fancy, but it was quick and tasty enough for a weekday meal.

It was good not great. I made it on my George Foreman. I like my fish baked in the oven better.

Made this tonight in the microwave (I have a fish sensor cook icon on mine.)  It turned out great!  I prepared Monkfish and Swai using Molly Mc Butter and the remainder of the ingredients listed.  It was very moist and both fishes were done at the same time.  Great time saving recipe, thanks! Simple, easy and tasty!

Tried this recipe last night. Both my wife and I, found it to be really good. I used Cod fillets. Next time going to try Haddock. Hard to get any simpler on cooking directions.

I tend to agree that fish is best breaded and fried, but with diabetes and high cholesterol that isn't usually an option.  I read the reviews, paid attention, and put this in the oven at 375 for 15-20 minutes.  Picky Husband had a second helping.  My only complaint, too much butter. Next time I will use less.
