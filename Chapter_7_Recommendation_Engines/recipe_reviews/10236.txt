Grew up eating these cookies from our local chain of bakeries. Only difference from the ones I had was the frosting was piped on in a big chocolate kiss shape. To get that takes testing with the amount of powdered sugar and add a good bit of cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey. It should be the consistancy of decorator frosting.

These came out great!  I added a bit of vanilla to the frosting and added a little more powdered sugar to make it thick enough to pipe the "kiss" shape on top.  Awesome!!

Thank you! This is the recipe my mother had in her recipe box, but it was lost several years ago, and I miss making these. They will be on the menu for Christmas this year!
