Amazing! They took a while to make, but they were well worth it. I think I will try dipping the cake balls in the melted chocolate 2 or 3 times, instead of only once. Hopefully that will make the outer shell thicker and crunchier.

This was a wonderful way to use up the cake that I baked but wasn't pretty enough to just frost and serve.  It also makes it way too easy to eat more than one!

LOVED this recipe!!! Me and my girlfriends (and of course our pug) decided to add a kiss of peppermint. To do this we replaced half the vanilla extract in both the batter and the frosting with pure peppermint extract. Tastes like wintery heaven! Ooh la LA!

These are sinfully delicious!  Follow the recipe exactly, no revisions are necessary.  My daughter and I used wooden kabob skewers then slipped the decorative paper straw over the skewer for a more decorated finish. We melted the chocolate in a double boiler to keep it thin while we worked.  Once the cake pop was dipped and decorated we poked the stick through the top of a shoe box for perfect drying before storing in the freezer.

The process was time-consuming but this was an excellent recipe. It was my first time making cake pops, but they turned out to be a hit!

I tried these because my darling daughter wanted some expensive ones from your fancy coffee house. No way! How could anyone go wrong with triple chocolate pops? These took close to a day to make, with the baking of the cake, the frosting, the mixing, the freezing, the rolling, and dipping. I use a #20 ball scooper, and did some with the chocolate dip, and others with pink dip [Wilton's candy tablets], and we had pops until the cows came home. These were chocolatey and fudgy, an instant success in this household. I think kids can be involved in helping with the scooping and rolling, and also the dipping and decorating part. It could be a cake pop party! The waiting part..?? Not so much, LOL!

Really good and really rich.  I also added peppermint for half of the vanilla and it was just the right amount of extra flavor.

This is a great recipe I made these with a couple of friends and they are absolutely delicious. This recipe does have a lot of steps but it is overall very easy to make. I defiantly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves chocolate and cake. The cake recipe is also very very good and moist, I will make this cake and buttercream recipe my new recipe. I can't wait to make these again
