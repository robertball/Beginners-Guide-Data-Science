The recipe sounded yummy, but after reading the other reviews, I decided to do something about the loss of cheese.  I wrapped the shrimp, cheese & bacon in Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry and made little bundles.  I brushed the bundles with an egg wash and baked at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes.  Yum!

Excellent concept.  I went a bit further with it though.  I bought a ring of pre-cooked shrimp - plucked the tails and marinated them for an afternoon in 1tbs olive oil, 1tsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp old bay seasoning and 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic.  Then I wrapped them and the cheese in bacon, sprinkled with parmesan/romano cheese blend and wrapped in a puff pastry square... oh my.... are they EVER GOOD!  Thanks much for the ideas!

I read all the other ratings and seen ppl were saying the cheese was comming out. So this is what I did.  I used pre peeled and devained shrimp.  I butterflied it the opposite way.  Cut down the underside rather than the back side like your sapposed to.  The side opposite of where it was devained.  This way there was very little cheese comming out and you could still taste it.  I also broiled them in the oven untill the bacon was crispy.  I made these on Valentines Day for my b/f and we LOVED them!

I have been making this tasty little app for awhile. Butterflying the shrimp is not necessary. I also use pepper jack cheese which adds just a little kick. While I dont think there is much you can do with the cheese melting out a little, Ive noticed that if you use the half of bacon that isn't so "lacy" it works better. Also if you broil this treat for about 5-7 minutes instead of baking, the bacon crips up quite nicely. It is very delicious and guests go nuts for them!

This got 5 stars from me for its ability to be quick, easy and elegant all at the same time. I had asaigo cheese insted of the jack. I sprinkled with paprika and  froze the little tid bits before cooking it helped the shrimp to not over cook befor the bacon browned.
I served scattered over a large cesar salad on a beautful clear glass tray. What a dinner. Thanks for the inspiration.

Excellent! My only problem was keeping the cheese in the wrap. It melted out into the pan.

I love this recipe.  Freezing the cheese pieces helps cut down on the melt.  As mentioned before, partially pre-cooking the bacon is helpful.  So, with frozen cheese and pre-cooked bacon, it takes less cooking time and you'll have less cheese melt.

I've had this many times while working at the Fisherman's Wharf in galveston.  The trick about the cheese is to freeze it after slicing and before cooking.  With the cheese frozen, it wll delay the melting long enough to let the shrimp and bacon to cook without loosing all the cheese in the oven.  also try deep frying it, just make sure the cheese is frozen solid and the bacon is wrapped tightly.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  My children even loved it!The cheese coming out into the pan wasn't a big deal.  It stayed connected to the pieces so I just scooted the extra cheese over with the spatula and when I took the off the pan I scooped all of the cheese off with them.  My husband marinated the shrimp all day in one of his special marinades then I served them over a salad of spinach, cauliflower, carrot and tomato.  My kids wanted ranch dressing, but I used roasted red pepper italian MMMMM!!!!

I took the suggestion of wrapping the morsels in fillo dough and they were great.  I used smaller shrimp, a small hunk of monterrey jack cheese and a small piece of cooked bacon.  I used 2-3 sheets of fillo, squares cut to about 5".  These were baked at about 375 degrees for 10 minutes.  They were delicious.  That's just enough time for the shrimp to cook.  They were tasty!  Took a bit of time to wrap them, but it was worth it!

Totally ran out of time making these yummy creations, so had to throw shrimp on broiler pan, layer on the cheese and bacon and broil as someone earlier had recommended.  The bacon flavor on the shrimp was so good my girls didn't even complain that the shrimp weren't crusty!  Success!  I threw it all on top of some buttered spaghetti and viola, dinner in a pinch.  Thanks!

As written, I think the recipe is good but needs a little more kick.  I basted a tangy barbecue sauce over some of the shrim before cooking, and that really made a difference.  The pepper jack recommended might help too.

I followed the review of another member and did everything as stated in the recipe except before baking I wrapped each shrimp in an individual puff pastry square, wrapped it up and brushed with egg wash.  I cooked these @ 375 for 20 minutes.  The bacon was a little soggy for my liking because I wrapped it up and it couldn't crisp but still my husband and I both enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing.

Love this recipe, but I alter it a little to make it quick because often I cook this just for myself.  I saute the shrimp with some Mrs. Dash and lemon.  Then I grate the peper jack over the top.  I then crumble already cooked bacon over the top.  This way saves so much time.

My husband said these were the best things he's ever eaten!  Made for New Year's Eve.  Followed suggestions from reviewers--Precooked bacon, froze cheese pieces, broiled 5-7 minutes.  My shrimp was labeled Med/Larg. I think truly Large shrimp would work easier, I had to cut my cheese pieces in half to get them to fit.  Oh, and I used marbled colby/jack cheese

My bf's father made these and added a sliver of jalapeno with the cheese. Use thin bacon so that it gets crispy and the shrimp does not get overcooked. He grilled the shrimp kisses and absolutely delicious!!

Very good, i had had this before, and did not see how they kept the cheese in the bacon....after playing with the food for a little while, i precooked the bacon until slightly brown, but still rubbery, and left the bacon slice whole.  I put a slice of pepper jack slightly thinner than the bacon directly on the bacon, then placed chopped jalapenos on chesse, and wrapped shrimp fully with the bacon slice.  the extra wrapping kept the cheese in better.

Wow, are these great!  I knew that the cheese melting everywhere would be an issue, so I just wrapped my shrimp in bacon and baked as specified.  Then, layed the cheese (pepper jack) on top and broiled til melted.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks!

Great appetizer!! The whole crowd (even the kids) loved this dish. I used precooked shrimp and I precooked the bacon. I used pepper jack cheese--they were perfect. With everything precooked, I just basically warmed them in the oven and the cheese did not run out too much.

Yes, the cheese melted out a little like others have said, but these were super tastey! I made them for Valentine's day and my valentine loved them. They only took a minute or two to whip up, which was awesome as well.

Mediocre at best, I was expecting it to be more tasty, yes the cheese did melt out, the bacon cooked well, the shrimp maybe a tad underdone, but yes well worth the try, quick prep and cook time

I made this last night for a special Valentine's Day treat. It was good but really needs tweeked. I precooked the bacon part way in the microwave or it would not have been cooked enough in the oven. I sprinkled wrapped shrimp with fresh lime,terriyaki sauce and garlic. The cheese melted out and will try a hard cheese next time maybe. The cheese may not work at all. I made cocktail sauce for dipping. My sweetie love it! I worked in a top seafood resturant for 18 years and saw seafood cooked in many ways so this shrimp really caught my eye! It was good but really only can rate it a four because of all the additions I had to make and the melting cheese. It is worth a try!

Other than the cheese melting out, this was wonderful.

I was reminded by this recipe why I only eat shrimp fried..but it sounded good. Maybe it was just me being picky

I microwaveed the bacon for a minute so that it would crisp up nicely in the oven. Also, I used peel-and-eat shrimp as that's all I could get from the store. This was good, but I would like to experiment with different cheeses. I think a mild blue cheese would work well. Thanks!

Quick and easy recipe.  Great for a meal or an appetizer.  Make sure you use thinner bacon for it to get cooked thoroughly without overcooking the shrimp.  Also, the cheese melted out, and the bacon was about the only thing you could taste.  Not my favorite, but was well worth the try.

Pretty good but I had some smaller shrimp on hand and i tried over and over and could not get a large enough slit even on the insides to fit a small slice of cheese in so i ended up just setting the slice on top of side of shrimp, wrapping tightly w/ the bacon and securing w/ a toothpick..pretty tasty!

These were tasty little appetizers! The prep was a bit messy and yes, the cheese does come out a bit. I cooked the bacon a little bit in the microwave first, and next time I think I'll take suggestion to broil instead of bake. I like the bacon to be crispy, too. Great recipe! Thank you for sharing.

I altered this one a bit. I found it very difficult to place the cheese in the shrimp and hold the bacon to secure with a toothpick. I left out the cheese and it is spectacular! Simple and delicous. My guests all loved them. I will be keeping this one for future use~

Taste was good, but it's hard to go wrong with shrimp and bacon for taste.  It was a lot of work to get it, and they seemed to need to be eaten quickly.

I wish I would have read the reviews before tackling these but I did not. I thought real hard about partially cooking the bacon prior to wrapping around the shrimp and I wish I would have. My shrimp got overcooked while waiting for the bacon to get as dark as we like it. I too had problem with the cheese oozing out but in all honesty I couldn't really taste it in the end (even used pepper jack). Although I think recipe needs some tweaking, I will still make it again.
