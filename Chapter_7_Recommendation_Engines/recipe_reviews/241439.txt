Made this as the recipe stated and it was interesting. I love asian inspired flavors, but this was just OK. I added more soy sauce, garlic, onion, ginger, and red pepper to enhance the flavor. I will probably look for a different recipe.

I made this as directed, with no tweaking, and it was not to my or my husband's liking.  It tasted too much like barbecue sauce.   The soy sauce and peanut butter give it an Asian flavor,  but not enough to make it taste like stir fry sauce.  Won't be making it again.

Delicious and simple recipe! So much better than many of the bottled sauces from the store. Used in my beef and veggie (kale, sweet pepper, green onions, zucchini) stir fry with no changes to the recipe.

It was pretty good  - Iâ€™d use a less Smokey bbq sauce next time but it was all I had when I made this.

Delicious. Easy to put together and absolutely scrummy. Used it on a chicken and veg stir fry, and because of the nutty flavor, added some cashews and it was an absolute hit with the fam. This will now be my go-to stir fry sauce. Thanks, Amanda!

This tasted very good, received compliments on the meal!  If you use a smokey or hickory flavoured BBQ sauce it would be overwhelming.
I used Diana Sauce - Honey Garlic flavour with about 1/2 tbsp brown sugar and also added some pepper and it turned out great, would def. make again.

I always hate giving less than rave reviews, but this isn't a sauce I'm likely to make again.  My husband found it edible, but declared, "This isn't the best."  My son wouldn't eat it, and he loves the ingredients.  Maybe it was my choice in BBQ sauce.  Even after doctoring it up, it was "okay" at best.

This was fantastically simple and great. I ended up using Ketchup instead of barbecue sauce and added a dash of white vinegar and Worcestershire auce. Thank you for the recipe!

This is very good. I used a little less reduced sodium soya sauce cause I didn't want it to be too salty. Easy recipe

This was ridiculously delicious. I was very skeptical about making this after reading the ingredients, but I'm so glad I did. Only thing I added was about a quarter cup of mirin Japanese sauce. The stir fry lasted all of maybe 15 minutes lol

This is delicious and so easy. I added a drizzle of honey to sauce and stirred into my chicken and veggies. Served over rice.  We love it.

This took my veggie stir fry and rice to a whole different level!  Very good sauce and I had everything on hand. I will use it again. I did microwave method and it worked fine. I added it after I had done my vegetables in a pan. Served over rice.
