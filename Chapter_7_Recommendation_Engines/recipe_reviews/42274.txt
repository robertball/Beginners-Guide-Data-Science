This was an excellent twist on regular tuna sandwitches! I did how ever change things slightly...I added 2 tabl. relish, and I skipped out on the sugar, salt and onion. Also to add more, you could put chopped dried cranberries! This is a dish I will make on a regular basis Thanks for this recipe!!!!!

I can't believe this would get anything lower than a 5, but that's just my opinion!  

I LOVE this stuff!  I have a hard time not eating the whole batch in one sitting. :)  And I feel good about what I'm eating!

I don't change a thing.  This recipe is perfect!

This is absolutely perfect!! It's recipe is versatile too if not all the ingredients happen to be in your cupboard! It's even good for feeding little mouths who seem to complain about everything...I haven't had one complaint yet! In fact, it's a recipe that is requested often!!

I thought this sounded wonderful but decided I am not a big fan of apples in my tuna.  I ended up picking them all out which was not easy.  Thanks for letting me try.

OMG this was so good.  We have been looking for a tuna sandwich with a twist and this is it!  Loved it.  Was out of sugar and sweet relish so used dill relish instead.  Can't wait to try it as it's written....thank you!

Great tuna option! I left out the onion and I was pretty happy with it. Will try this again.

There was way too much apple and celery in this. Next time I'll add another can of tuna, and double the rest of the ingredients, or cut down on the apple and celery. I will leave out the sugar and salt next time, too. I do plan to give this another try, though.

Very quick, tasty, and easy! Also uses inexpensive ingredients, which is a huge bonus for me. I made a few substitutions based on personal preference and what I had on hand - I used Granny smith apples (loved the tart flavor), omitted the onion, and used regular dill relish. Very good as a sandwich or whole what crackers. Next time I may add dried cranberries.

I heard someone say they put apples in their tuna salad so I looked for a recipe for it. This is very good. I just ate it in a lettuce wrap. It was so good for lunch we made it for dinner and again the next day. Best way to eat tuna for sure. Oh also added some lemon juice.

I am still unsure if I like this recipie or not... I gave it 4 stars because everyone I served it to just loved it. The walnuts are a bit strange tasting to me..but the apples are nice.

I really liked the apple idea so I used chopped apple, diced celery, applesauce instead of pickle relish, a dash of onion powder instead of chopped onion. My kids loved it and asked for more.

Okay.  I just loved this! Every once in a while I crave tuna sandwiches and this recipe with the chopped apple and the nuts was exactly what I needed.  I used slivered almonds instead of the walnuts and it was fantastic.

This was excellant! I didn't have the relish. I added real bacon bits and omited the salt. Used reg. mayo too. My husband doesn't like onions so left them out. Even with these few changes it was still incredible! It would be great using chicken too!! I hate it when people alter a recipe so much that it's not the original recipe, but I worked with what I had and this one is so forgiving. Will be making this ALOT!!! Thanks for sharing!!

This is great stuff! I love the crunch of the celery and the nuts. I used regular mayo and pecans instead of walnuts. Had it on rye bread, which is a really good combo.

I did not follow this recipe to a "T" and that is the only reason it only got 4 stars.  This recipe idea is SUPERB!  I was extremely skeptical about apples (esp. a sweet, red one) in with my tuna and mayo and all that, but it TOTALLY works!  I was even careful not to let the hubby know there was apple in there because he is a fussy eater of anything new and unusual, but he never said a word and he ate every bite!  I omitted a lot of ingredients only bc I was working with on-hand stuff.  I basically mixed the tuna with dill relish, dill, mayo, a tad of mustard and the chopped apple and celery but boy oh boy it was TASTY!  I also served it on sliced croissants and a slice of provolone cheese.  A+!

I was a bit hesitant about apple-tuna combination at first. Nevertheless, I proceeded to prepare this as I had some Granny Smith leftovers in the fridge last night.   Used regular Mayo as it was what I had and also added some freshly-cracked black pepper as well as chopped dill in addition of what was called for. The taste turns out to be surprisingly unique with a new twist than those usual tuna salads!   However, hubby doesn't like it so much but commended about the unique taste though... So, a 4-star for you!

I love this recipe.  I didn't really change a thing and it's perfect.  Because I am trying to reduce sodium, I do a very scant 1/4 tsp of salt...I could leave it out completely and I don't think it would be missed at all (if you are reducing sodium and used to lower salt flavor, the relish probably adds enough.)  I serve it in whole wheat tortillas just because that is our preference around here over bread.  The recipe is awesome!  THANKS!!

I just made this today for my first time and wish I'd started on it sooner! It's perfect for making a batch or two of the filling & having it for lunch for a few days! It has so many wonderful tastes and a great crunch to it, so it's much better than your standard tuna sandwich recipe. I made it with cashews instead of walnuts, since that was all I had, and it was still awesome and too easy. LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Not one of my favorite recipies.  I was not really crazy about the combination of apple with tuna.  Would probably be better with the apple left out but then it is pretty much just Tuna salad.
