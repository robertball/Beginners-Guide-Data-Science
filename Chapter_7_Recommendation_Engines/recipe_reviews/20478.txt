Thank you Janis and Papa John!  We enjoyed this a few weeks ago, and I must admit...it's better than the recipe my mother gave me years ago.  It was a really nice change for us and we enjoyed the flavor a lot.  This is worth making, without a doubt!  Thanks again!

Made as written except that I left out the cloves. This reminded me of what I consider Kansas City style BBQ sauce. Not quite but similar. Overall I thought it was a good sauce but I thought it could have used some vinegar to balance out the sweetness. The bacon was a nice addition and this is one I'd make again with some minor tweaks to suit our tastes.
