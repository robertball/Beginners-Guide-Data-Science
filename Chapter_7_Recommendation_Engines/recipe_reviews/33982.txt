I drink this a lot. In a bar it is most commonly refered to as a Malibu and Pineapple. It's nothing new, but I am sure more people will know about it now and order it!

One of my favorite standby's.  Great on a summer day.  Occasionally, I add a splash of Amaretto which give it an excellent taste and ups the alcohol content!

My favorite drink. I had it once at a party and I was hooked. I never knew it had a name besides Malibu & Pineapple tho! The cherry, if left in the bottle of the glass, soaks up some of the alcohol and when u eat it, it gives a real kick. Also something to try, add a slice of pear. It sounds weird, but it gives the pear flavor AND that kick of soaked up alcohol.

There are only two ingredients but the cocktail is so delicious. I used grenadine syrup instead of maraschino cherry.

I have made this drink also adding orange juice and 7-up.  You can never go wrong with anything that has coconut rum in it.  Enjoy it with your girlfriends!  I do!

My favorite drink to order in a bar.  For a stronger drink, I'll make it with 3/4 coconut rum and 1/4 pineapple juice.

This is my "go-to" girly drink when I either have no other ingrediends or get sick of the same 'ol thing - who knew it even had a name! Depending on my mood or occasion I'll add a splash of vodka & use a pine/orange blend if I have it. My bro-in-law insists on a splash of grenadine but I think it's sweet enough as is & very refreshing!

Love this drink but am not fussy on ice cubes in my drinks so I added a scoop of vanilla ice cream blended all together in my blender and voila I call it "the strip and go naked" for reasons we will not discuss

Love this drink, I was first introduced to it while I was in Belize for my honeymoon, down there they call it the Panty Rippa.  Since we have been back I have made it a little more pretty by adding a touch of grenadine, makes it looks like a sunset, and tastes delicious.

I forgot how much I love these!  Even my husband has been asking for this tooty-fruity drink.  I must admit, however, that I add more rum than pineapple juice and a splash of Collins Cherry Cocktail Syrup!  Thanks for the reminder!

Smooooooth and easy. Easy to make and easy to drink. Perfect blend of flavors. This drink is not too strong making it nice if you want a drink without getting looped.

We add splash of cranberry juice or grenadine and call it a Malibu Barbie. One of my faves! Always a fun time when we make these.

I had these in Belize at a bar called IguanaRana, and it was called a "Panty Ripper!"  After just one, I wanted to stay there all day and party!  But I don't like maraschino cherries, so I leave them out.

There are houses in Jamaica that sell this on the route from airport to resort.  No ice, but hey, your on your way to a beach vacation, so who cares!  It's the BEST!!  I drank so many of these one NY's Eve, I ended up in the hospital with esophegial spasm's - thought I HAD to be having a heart attack, it hurt so bad!

Since I really wanted to try this & was out of pineapple juice, I made it with OJ.  It was very yummy! Next time will make it with pineapple juice & when we go out, I'll have a new drink to order!

I love Malibu Pineapples. My husband likes to top it off with a splash of cranberry juice.

It's even better when you add a little grenadine... it sinks to the bottom and adds a beautiful layer.

This is my favorite way to drink Malibu. Sometimes I add a splash for orange juice too for a little extra flavor.

This is so much like a Bahama Mama.  The only difference is we use a blended tropical juice and grenadine.  LOVE IT !!

Great drink! I like cocktails a little more on the tart side so I added more juice. I also added a splash of orange liqueur. Loved it!
