Our family loves this so much! We prefer cinnamon over nutmeg but that's just our choice! Fantastic warm with ice cream, room temp, cold or any way you can think of. Just make this everyone!

Tasted Great but made a few changes! I used 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the bisquick batter. It turned out great!

My Grandmother would make this quite often when I was younger, she would always use. Bisquick Mix only, and Land O Lakes Butter, Hoods Milk and all the other recepie items.  She had nine children so before my mother gave birth to me she had been using this product, for dumplings,biscuts,and cobblers.

So, as I got older I was raised on these cobblers, and of course Sara Lee Popovers, but, Strawberry, Peach, Blueberry and apple cobbler was the thing to eat on a seriously cold New England day, topped with homemade whipped cream, and Vanilla Ice Cream.  Never forget the strong Swedish Coffee or Tea.
Memories of foodsno one will forget.

A very simple recipe to make with ingredients already in the pantry.  I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  Tasted good, although the bottom was a bit soggy.  However, topped with vanilla ice cream, I didn't even notice.  Will definitely make again.

Yum I have never made peach cobbler before but this was really easy. I followed the advice from some of the other reviewers and I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Baked it for 55 minutes. This was delicious and I will definitely be making it again.

It bakes soggy on the inside.  If I leave it in longer, it burns on the top.  And there is way too much sugar.

This is quick and easy.  Very delicious.  I used Betty Crocker  Gluten Free bisquick.   I added cinnamon and vanilla and a dash of nutmeg.   
I will make this again.

If you don't like nutmeg, cut it by half and use that half as cinnamon. Put a couple drops of vanilla in and use 1 cup of cane sugar. Cane sugar is sweet, but not as sweet as regular white sugar. Make sure you drain the peaches thoroughly or it will turn out soggy.

I also put organic vanilla in with the peaches. I made this for Thanksgiving and It was very good. I doubled everything in the recipe to have plenty. Turned out perfect. The key to baking it is to first put it on the bottom rack towards the burners for about 30 minutes. Then put it on the top rack for about 20-25 minutes until it's a golden brown color or light brown.

Great EASY cobbler!! I don't really bake much,  so everyone thought I bought the peach cobbler from the store.   It was a great hit!  I also liked the substituting of cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  It was just right!

I doubled the recipe and used 8 cups fresh peaches. Although, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups it was still extremely sweet and the nutmeg a little too strong. Will make it again and cut the sugar and butter in half and reduce the nutmeg. Overall, very easy to make and definitely worth trying again. (55 minutes was perfect.)

Used fresh peaches. Added 1tsp of "Fresh Fruit"to keep from browning. Cut sugar to 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Guests loved it! I also liked that there were no dishes to clean up afterwards.

In the past I have always made peach cobbler with Bisquick, but with a shortcake-type dropped biscuit topping over hot fruit.  I like the change in how this one is made.  It seems richer with the slight mix of peaches and dough.  I think nutmeg is classic for peach desserts, so always use that rather than cinnamon, but each to his own.  I live in Colorado and in the summer we have the most fabulous peaches that grow in the Palisade area of our state.  They are so sweet that I only add 1/2cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice.

Speedy prep. is what I'm all about. I suggest 1tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg for the perfect balance. Vanilla is not needed in the cobbler. I'll be serving it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I actually wanted peach cobbler and peach crisp so I combined the 2.. I layered My Pan with my peaches then I poured over my Bisquick mix and on top of my mix I put my crumble.. I'm giving it a five because I tweaked it and it was the bomb diggity..

This is a quick and delicious dish to make.  I was lucky I got one piece as the guys ate it up!  I also looked at other people's suggestions.  I used the cinnamon and vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of each as I didn't have nutmeg.  Very good!

My husband really liked this.  It was easy to make.  I used 4 cups of sliced fresh peaches and should have used more since they were sliced thin.  I used 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also only used 7 ounces of milk in hopes of getting a crunchy crust but that didn't work.

I made a trial cobbler to see if I want to make it again for our daughter's birthday dinner on Sunday.  We all tried it and loved it.  I used frozen peaches instead of canned,  added cinnamon, and decreased the sugar by maybe 1/8 cup.  When I make it again, I will add even more cinnamon.

I found this an awesome and extremely easy recipe. I did add a dash of cinnamon to the peaches and sugar. It complimented the nutmeg mixed with the Bisquick. Getting ready to make this again.

Very good and easy. I used half the sugar with fresh peaches. Next time I will use slightly less milk and slightly less butter to make it less soggy.

I AM making it again right now. I doubled it into a 9x12 glass pan, but instead of doubling the sugar to 2 cups, I'm only going to use a half cup. I used about 1 1/4 sugar the first time and it was way too sweet. Maybe if they were fresh peaches, but not canned peaches. Even with that, it was so good.Everyone loved it!

I love this cobbler!! It's absolutely delicious!! Now, I substitute  the nutmeg with cinnamon. I use a little less than a half a cup of brown sugar and the rest white, instead of all white sugar. And just a tad of lemon juice with the peaches. It's amazing!!

Used it for black berry instead of peach, so didn't add any nutmeg and added a splash of milk to more effectively mix the sugar and berries.  Very easy to make and came out great

I added more cinnamon and just a pinch of nutmeg  (our families preference). I also used 3/4 cup of whole milk and 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  The results are SUPERB! :)

Made this a few nights ago, and it's wonderful.  Remember when my grandma made it and we still love it.  I made it with fresh peaches, no nutmeg.  This is a keeper and so quick and easy to make.

I followed this recipe exactly except I used ground cinnamon in place of nutmeg. I also used a round pan. It was very simple to make and tasted delicious! I would prefer more peaches next time, but that can be adjusted. Overall, very good. Will make again!

I cut sugar to a generous 1/4 cup of sugar and about 2&1/2 cups sliced fresh peaches.  Very good!

I read the reviews... adding cinnamon and vanilla extract were good suggestions...I used fresh, ripe peaches in place of canned.   I yet I can not give higher rating because I disliked the spongy - soggy 'crust'.  It was edible, the peaches yummy.

I was really looking forward to a good peach cobbler.  I didn't get one!
If I try this again, I'll sure make some changes!  It was WAY too sweet.  I like sweet, but this was way overboard.  The cake part  of it wasn't good either.

I  was skeptical...nutmeg? Drained canned peaches? Bisquick? But I was tired of chocolate and needed something for my card ladies, so I made a double recipe the same day as cards. It had just cooled for a few hours....suspense as a brave friend served herself a piece and topped it with whipped cream. She was delighted! Even the nutmeg cautious enjoyed a piece! Glad I made it! Served fresh was great, but after a day, liquid from peaches made for soggy cake-so only 4stars. Advise eating same day!

This was really great. I did cook the peaches with sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Once they were at a nice boil, I drained the syrup mixture and just used the peaches. Added nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla to the Bisquick and milk. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream. Huge hit. Lots of great flavour. Will make again! Thank you!

Made as directed, it seemed too light on the peaches. I used 3- 15 oz cans of peaches (45 oz as opposed to 29) and the same amount of Bisquik. Instead of putting nutmeg in the Bisquik, I added it to the peaches. It worked out just fine.

When I saw this recipe, I didn't think it would work because of the high liquid to solids ratio; but I went ahead, using mostly cinnamon with a dash of nutmeg and melting butter for the oil component. It took an hour to bake and is delicious. I used an abundance of fresh peaches, didn't measure; just sliced away. This recipe is husband-approved.

I thought the equal parts milk and bisquick might make this a bit runny, so I cut the milk to just over 1/2c. Also reduced the sugar to 1/2 c and used fresh, ripe peaches. Still not the caky, flaky cobbler I'd prefer.

This was absolutely amazing!  I used fresh, ripe peaches so was able to cut the sugar by more than half.  I also added some vanilla (3/4 tsp) and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  I also tossed a small amount of light brown sugar in with the peaches.  This is one of the tastiest cobblers I've ever had!

I used about 6 fresh, very ripe peaches. I used half nutmeg, half cinnamon and added a splash of vanilla extract.  This is delicious! I just tried some with a dollop of whipped cream on top and yes, it's good! And it's simple to make...

I make this for a client that is diabetic, so I make a couple minor changes and it is still delicious!
I used 1/2 cup brown splenda with the drained canned lite syrup peaches. This is the first time I added sweetener. Did not have nutmeg, so none used. Served with reddi-whip. Always a big hit!

There is nothing better than warm peach cobbler with ice cream. This is such a simple recipe and I love simple.  I did use brown sugar (1/2 c) because I didn't have enough regular sugar on hand.  I cant compare it to using white sugar, but it turned out great.

The batter did not cook all the way through. I think that the ratio of dry to wet ingredients is incorrect. I kept in oven for 70 minutes and still too soft in the center. Taste was good but the final result was not worth the effort.

Too much butter, too much milk. It never set up and was like a pudding. The flavor was good but waaaay too thin.
