Thanks for the recipe Keka.  I have to say I did enjoy the way all the flavors married together; however, next time I will make a feel changes.  First, instead of slicing the onions I would opt for diced.  Just my own preference but if you have picky kids sliced may be the way to go so as to pick them out. Also, for me 2 onions was way too much and I even doubled the recipe.  Next time I will use half and onion or a whole onion if I double the recipe again.  As for the soy sauce I found that 2tbsp suited my taste more which after doubling the entire recipe came to 4tbsp.  Although, I have to note that I didn't add any extra salt or pepper.  Last change I made was to leave out the cilantro.  I am sure it would have been just as good with since I do love cilantro.  Only thing is I am the only one who likes it in the family so just as well to leave it out.  All in all this was a good twist on shrimp fried rice and I will make again.

I used leftover brown rice, 4 green Thai peppers, part red onion and part scallion, added in some diced red bell for color, about a t of garlic, and doubled the soy.  Probably doubled the cilantro too but didn't really measure that. Had good heat which was nice with the fruit.  Would make again.

First, for us, there are W-A-A-A-Y too many onions in this, I'd use only one moving forward, and my onions were not large.  Also, in case you don't catch it, step #1 should be "Pour in the eggs…" not "Pour in the onions…"  Followed the recipe to the letter except using cashews instead of walnuts (sorry, I just couldn't see walnuts in this dish).   Made a lot, this is 2 VERY generous servings (in this house, would be 3). This was O.K., but it's doubtful I'll make again.

I didn't have any peppers and I think it needs it.  It's good but needs a little more flavor.  I will make it again.

Had most of the ingredients at home and wanted to use up frozen shrimp. This recipe is really easy and I already have variations I want to try (i.e. snap peas & chicken additions). The dish is satisfying as the main meal and the flavors are balanced.. The ginger and green pepper give it a good kick while the pineapple balances the spice with it's juicy sweet flavor. Would definitely make this dish again!

I made it with only two peppers but still too spicy for us who don't handle heat too well .  Loved the rest which I made as written.  Only wish is that I owned a wok.
