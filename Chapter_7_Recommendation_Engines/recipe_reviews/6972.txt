I like this recipe, but I have made a few changes.  I use 1/2 cup of honey instead of the 1/4 cup of sugar, I love honey sweetened bread.  I also add 2 eggs.  I think they help the texture of the bread, this means you need some additional flour and it will make 3 smaller loaves or two larger ones.  And, I knead the bread for 10 minutes in my mixer before I let it rise.

I'm always looking for recipes to use up buttermilk left from making butter. This turned out excellent! I used butter instead of margarine and being a lazy cook, I dumped all the ingredients into my mixer bowl and used the dough hooks for 8 minutes. Let it rise and made hamburger buns out of it. Let the formed buns rise for another 30 minutes, popped them in the oven for 12 minutes or so and YUM!! They rose nice and tall with a soft texture and were delicious. Thanks for the recipe, it'll be one of my keepers.

This bread was good but a little dry. I halved it and used my bread machine. Next time, I will make as directed to see if it is not as dry.

I cut this recipe in half and used my Kitchen Aid to make this dough. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warm water and sugar for ten minutes until it looked creamy, then added the "soured" milk (I didn't want to take the chance that vinegar soured milk might kill my yeast--I used lemon juice to make sour milk this time.), the melted butter, salt and AP flour. (I omitted the baking soda purely by accident, I just happened to overlook it when I was making the bread.)  This recipe needed no extra flour to get it into a ball. I kneaded it with my dough hook for about five minutes. I let this rise in a greased bowl on a warm heating pad until it doubled, then formed the dough into balls and plopped them into greased muffin tins. I then covered it with saran wrap and let them rise in the pan on the warm heating pad. I got nine biggish rolls out of a halved recipe. Very good bread/roll recipe--soft and really airy. It's going to sound weird but it reminds me of italian bread only without the hard crust on the outside, if that makes sense. NOTE: I noticed the difference from using soured milk instead of buttermilk, I will use the real deal next time.

Did not proof the yeast.  Just tossed everything in the bread machine (halved the recipe).  The smell while it was baking was devine and it was gobbled up for a late night snack by the kids.  Thanks

A keeper recipe for a classic bread.  I halved the recipe and used my bread machine.  We loved it.  I've found that doughs (such as this recipe) with higher moisture content, bake up in the bread machine, with a denser texture, as opposed to a fluffy/spongy consistency---more like old fashioned home made bread.  Will try a slice tomorrow for breakfast, as toast to accompany a mug of rich hot chocolate.

Thanks Esther.

This bread is so delicious! I used salted butter, not margarine for this recipe. I warmed the butter and buttermilk together and added it to the yeast that was proofing in the warm water. Instead of white sugar, I used a 1/2 cup of pure honey. I let it sit a few minutes more while I mixed the dry ingredients together. I used about 1 1/2 tsp of salt since there was already salted butter. Once I mixed everything together by hand, it took the bread an hour to rise up. I halved the dough into 2 loaves. I placed them each into two greased (buttered) loaf pans. It rose again about half hour later. I then brushed the top of the bread with, "Honey Butter," from this website. The smell of the bread baking was so heavenly! They both baked right up in the pans with a nice golden brown color on top. The top of the bread is crusty and has a nice sweet crispness to it. I thought the buttermilk might leave that bit of "sour tang" in the bread but it did not. Instead I could smell and taste the buttermilk as well as the honey...Mmmm. The bread is just so moist and sweet especially when eaten warm. The inside texture is so soft I could eat it plain with no butter. My family requested that I make a honey butter to spread all over their bread. It was worth making this bread. This exceeded my expectations and we all loved it! I served this with, "Hearty Chicken Vegetable Soup I," from this site.

Great recipe!  I've made several times and turned out wonderful every time.  I used my mixer with the dough hook and then kneaded by hand for a few minutes.  The bread has a wonderful texture and taste!

This turned out so well.  I was a little concerned while mixing in the flour that it might end up on the dry side but it was perfect.  I used just under 5 cups of flour total and thought the dough seemed a little dry but after working with it and letting it rise, it baked up beautifully.  Perfect to slice and toast!  Add your flour gradually as it states.  You might not need to add it all.

It was okay.  Even when freshly baked, the buttermilk "tang" was not pronounced and lessened, quickly, over time; a couple days after baking it was just a too sweetish white bread.  

Watch for over-proofing as with two packs of yeast and a quarter cup of sugar, there'll be a lot (!!!!) of CO2 released.  The both rises happen very quickly.

Additionally, this is a very dense bread; toast is about what it's good for.

I used my dough cycle to prepare this, then baked in the oven.  I was happy with the results.  The kids and husband all snacked on fresh bread, and I made grilled cheese sandwhiches.  The following morning it toasted up so nicely, and I have found (upon snacking this afternoon) that the flavor is even better a day later.

Wow. Yum. Fantastic.  It rose like crazy in the bowl, but not as much in the pans. It never even got close to an inch over the pan (and hot humid Houston provides perfect bread rising condition). I finally gave up after almost an hour and half second rise. But it was still delicious and fluffy!

I can't tell you how much my family loves this bread. the entire family watches the oven door until it comes out...the only way to let this bread cool completly, is to make it when the house is empty. Even then I've never had the bread last more than 1 day. Great recipe, thank you

Very tasty bread.  I just threw all the ingredients into  the good old bread machine.  Only change I made was butter instead of margarine, and bread machine yeast.  Turned out very delicious.  I'll make his bread again and again.  Thank you so much!

awesome recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was so curious to try buttermilk in the bread recipe, and somehow came across this one.
I used real butter and low fat buttermilk, making 8 rolls and 1 loaf.  The taste and the texture are unbeatable.   Thank you so much.

P.S. I'm a soapmaker, so I used my digital scale to weigh the bread flour. I use 770 grams :-)

I had some buttermilk that needed to be used and was just about out of bread, so I decided to give this a try.  The dough came together beautifully with only about 4-1/2 cups flour and was so easy to work with.  It was moist, flavorful, and perfect white bread.  Thanks Esther, definitely will be making this one again.

This is my go to recipe. I use butter instead of margarine, but other than that, we love this recipe. I have never had any problem with it being dry. I made it for a church potluck and got MANY complements on it. I love the aroma of it baking and it just is a very easy and comforting recipe. Yum!
I also use this for cinnamon raisin bread. When mixing add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 c raisins (more or less to your liking). Before placing in the well greased pans roll out to get any air bubbles out and butter (you don't have to) then mix 3 -4 T sugar with 1 t cinnamon) sprinkle liberally. Place in pan let raise. Bake as usual. I have made this without the vanilla and it's okay, the vanilla just gives it a nice flavor.

WOW! Great flavor, rich texture, and a soft, fine crumb - almost cakelike.  I increased the salt to 2 and 1/4 teaspoons and  had to add more flour as the dough was really sticky. Used a Kitchen aide mixer. Total prep time was more like 4 1/2 hours, for the dough took over 2 hours to double in volume. I only allowed a 30 minute second rise. Came out great.

I have been using this recipe for about 11 years! Love it! I warm the buttermilk and melt the butter and throw it all into my bread machine to do the kneading by setting it on the dough cycle. After it's done I bring it out and split it into two loaves and place them in oiled bread pans then let them rise. I cook them together in the oven but have found I have to drop the temperature a bit so the outside doesn't get too cooked. Everyone in my family loves this recipe! I suppose I'll keep using it for another 20 years! ??

Pretty good bread.  I used regular, all purpose flour and it worked just fine.  It was a bit too sweet from me, so I'll use half the sugar next time, but I'm used to sourdough bread, so it is probably fine for the rest.  Also, I'll let the bread rise a second time in the pans as to get fuller loafs.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very easy to make and tasted great fresh out of the oven with butter and homemade blackberry jam!  Tried it this morning for toast--excellent recipe.  Thanks!

This is a good recipe as far as I could tell.  I made it with a cold so I couldn't taste it too well but the texture and color were perfect.  My whole family really liked it, the first loaf was gone before it had a chance to cool.

I made 2/3 of the recipe using 1 cup of buttermilk and OF COURSE butter instead of margarine,  and made my first loaf of bread with my Kitchen Aid.  Other than that I made it exactly as specified, but in one 5" x 9" loaf pan. It was all textbook; the flour quantity incorporated perfectly into a perfect elastic dough.  I did spread a little melted butter over the top before baking.  I think my oven runs a little warm and it seemed done after a little over 2o minutes.  I turned off the oven and left it a little longer, and it came out perfectly.  It was wonderful, like the fresh baked farmhouse style bread you used to be able to find in some restaurants.  That's not easy to find around Los Angeles anymore.  I hate to say perfect again, but I was thrilled with the way it turned out.

A very good basic bread for daily use.  I used butter instead of margarine. When I make it again I will add an egg for richness like another reviewer suggested.  I used two 9" loaf pans and it rose and filled them just fine.

You should have a warning on this bread!  I just took it out of the oven and it was gone in 30 minutes.  I have to make more so we have something for sandwiches tomorrow.  The texture was amazing, the taste was incredible and the crust was spectacular.  This is my new recipe and I am throwing all of the others out.  Thank you for posting this delectable treat!  It was a smash hit!

I had buttermilk I wanted to use up and found this recipe. The bread had a nice "buttery" taste and a really soft texture. The recipe did not say how long it would take to rise. It was about an hour in the bowl and an hour and a half once in the pan. I ate some hot out of the oven. But, if you want to slice it for sandwiches it slices up nicely the next day. Thanks for the bread this week.

Got a new Kitchen Aid for Christmas and had to try out the dough hook. I just pulled the loaves out of the oven and ate a piece. Absolutely PERFECT. Super light and fluffy. Melts in my mouth. I will be making more of this recipe this coming year.

Very good recipe. I did do a couple subsitutions, they were: I used honey instead of sugar,and butter instead of marg. I also cut the recipe in half and used the dough cycle and made rolls baked in the oven. Everyone loved them, I actually ran out rolls and my guests asked for more. This is a keeper.

The taste and texture of this bread was very good, and it rose beautifully, but it fell flat when I put it in the oven.  I brushed the top with egg wash so I guess that could have been the problem, but I've never had that happen before.  I'll give it another try the next time I have buttermilk to use up.

This bread is fantastic!
The only thing I did different is use butter, because I never use margarine.  We loved this bread, it stays moist and delicious for days and does make great toast as one reviewer mentioned.  This has become one of my favorite bread recipes.  Thank you Esther!

This is a great buttermilk bread recipe. I made it in my bread machine with only minor changes in preparation. 
  I melted the margarine and let it cool, heated the buttermilk and let it cool and then put all the liquids into the bread machine. Then I added all the other dry ingredients (except yeast) sifted together. I did substitute sea salt for the regular salt and my yeast didn't have a weight listed so I used 1 3/4 tsp. I added yeast last, in an indentation in the other dry ingredients, and cooked it as a 2 lb. white loaf with medium crust.
  My children (aged 5 & 7) said that I made "the best bread ever". Their mother loves it too and will be making it frequently.

This is a terrific recipe: simple and easy to revise, if desired. It consistently produces delicious, nutritious loaves of bread.

I use 2 Tbpns and 2 tspns of honey instead of the 1/4 cup sugar, unsalted butter instead of margarine, and brush the fully baked loaves with butter to soften the crusts. 

For some reason, I'm never able to keep two loaves in my apartment for long...

This buttermilk bread is as good as any bakery bread! It is fluffy, pillowy and yummy! I halved the recipe and added 1/2 cup of old fashioned rolled oats, simply because I love oatmeal. Even with the addition of the whole grain oats, the dough quickly doubled in volume on both rises, which made it much easier and faster to make. Because it is so easy to make and it is delicious, I will be making it again, particularly, that my son and I both love buttermilk breads! :-)

WOW, this is delicious.  I mixed the dough in my bread machine, and it looked dry after the first heavy mixing.  I added a half a cup of milk, and it turned into the most amazing looking dough after that!  It rose perfect, smelled delicious.  When the dough cycle on the machine was finished, I removed the dough and shaped it into 2 loaves rather than put it in pans.  I let it rise again, gave the tops a few slashes with a knife, and baked it for a half an hour.  It rose more while it baked, and the bread turned out beautiful.  I brushed butter on the top of the loaves when it was done so the crust wouldn't be hard, let it cool a bit, and tried it.  Oh, my.  Such flavor!  This bread is perfect yeasty goodness, dense and moist and satisfying.  My husband and I had slices toasted today with breakfast, and I just can't get over how perfect of a bread this is.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing it.

Really tasty buttermilk bread. I used butter instead of margarine because pigs won't eat it and neither will I!  :)  I believe this recipe would also make terrific dinner rolls and I will try that with the second loaf next time.  And there WILL be a next time! Thanks Ester for a delicious bread recipe!!

I cut the recipe in half and make it in my bread machine. I also usually do 2 cups of white bread flour and the rest in whole wheat bread flour, but it's fantastic either way. My go-to recipe!

This bread was DELICIOUS!  I followed the recipe as written, and was totally satisfied!!!  I needed to use up some buttermilk, and ended up making a whole second batch to share with my neighbors.  I did shorten the cooking time by about 5 minutes, but my oven is a little testy!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This bread turned out wonderfully.  I opted to use all buttermilk so used two cups buttermilk instead of 1/2 cup water, so the bread has a bit of a milky taste.  It rises well (I didn't use bread flour--just AP flour) and turns out a very soft, basic loaf.  I made one loaf and 12 rolls--very delicious.   Bf hasn't tried these yet, but I'm sure he'll love them as they turned out very soft, and he prefers softer, white breads.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first bread to make with my new Bosch mixer. It turned out perfect! The texture is amazing and taste so good. The cruse is beautiful, firm yet soft. This is a keeper.

Amazing recipe! It was perfectly moist and fluffy. I stored it in a zipper bag and it was just as good the next few days with butter and for sandwiches. Will be making this again.

I cut the recipe in half and made a single loaf of this in my bread machine on the basic 3 hour cycle....absolutely fabulous. I did add one egg to the recipe and it was wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.

This bread was very moist.  I actually substituted the bread flour for 1 c. of whole white wheat flour, 1 1/2 c. of brown rice flour and the rest unbleached flour.  My family loves it!  My kids want toast all of the time.  I will be making this again.  I forgot to put in the 2nd package of yeast and it still turned out great!

Simply divine. I was in the mood for a slightly sweeter bread, so I added 3T honey, increased the baking soda to 1T, and reduced cooking time to 28 min (though still had to cover the bread with foil -- started browning way early). Very tasty -- going back for my second piece!

Absolutely fabulous flavor and texture.  I used powdered buttermilk in lieu of liquid.  I halved the recipe, used fast rising yeast and baked in my Zoji machine using the quick bake option.  This recipe is a KEEPER!

I scaled the recipe in half down to 12 servings and let my bread machine do all the work.  I started with the basic cycle and set it to 1.5 pound with light crust.  This is an amazing bread recipe.  I can clearly taste the butter and the buttermilk adds such tenderness to the final product.  Definitely a keeper!

Awesome!  I had a bunch of buttermilk to use and I found this recipe. We love homemade bread so this was great. I switched sugar for honey and added 1/2c oat bran and switched out 2 cups flour for white whole wheat flour.  The bread rises nice and high. I made mine in to hamburger/sandwich rolls and knots. Today I will make a loaf and more rolls since I still have a bunch of buttermilk to use. Definately a keeper!

This recipe makes a wonderfully, moist and great tasting bread. I did replace 2 cups of bread flour with 2 cups of whole wheat flour. My 5-year old grandson must have eaten 5 or 6 slices! Then the next time I saw him he asked if I had brought more bread with me! Now look what I started! Thanks ERBK!

This delicious recipe has the flavor of a buttermilk biscuit, thanks to the addition of baking soda.    I made a few changes, but it still turned out wonderful.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used reduced-fat sour cream instead.  I also used 1/2 white whole wheat flour.  These changes probably added some density to the bread, but still turned out delicious.

This bread is really good! I used it the first time I baked bread and it turned out wonderful. I just stuck the yeast in with the dry ingredients and made sure my liquids were warm when I combined the two. I only used 4 cups of flour but it seemed to be enough.

Beautiful bread!  It had great color, texture and flavor.  The dough was a little hard and took some time to rise, (about 1.5 hrs each time) so I think I'll add less flour next time.  It rised again while baking in the oven so I had nice tall loaves.  I ran a stick of butter over the top of the loaves when they came out of the pans while they were hot, and cut off a couple of slices right away...the flavor was devine!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I think it is my new favorite bread.

Excellent!  And very easy to make!  I let my KitchenAid mixer do all the mixing and kneading for me.  Also, I ran out of butter, so I used canola oil instead, and it still came out rich and flavorful.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will be making many, many more times!!!

Excellent sandwich bread. I use SAF red label instant yeast and don't proof the yeast but mix it directly with the flour. You have to heat the liquid a bit warmer(120-130) but it is a time saver. I also bake mine at 350 and start watching it after 25 minutes. I like a lightly browned crust. I use powdered buttermilk which is great because you can have it on hand all the time. All in all this is a wonderful recipe. Simple and tasty.

This bread was fabulous. I have been making bread for a while now and I love to try new recipes. Even though I did not have buttermilk, I substituted it with 1 1/2 cups of milk with 1 1/2 tablespoons of vinegar (let stand for 5 minutes). I was very pleased with the outcome. It was moist and hearty. My family devoured it in less than two days. I was also able to enjoy a slice for toast and it was tasty. I will definitely be making this again and again! Thank you Esther.

This bread is delicious! The buttermilk adds a tang to it. It’s easy to make. I got too tired to bake it the night I made it, so I let it rise in the fridge for the first rise. I baked it he next day and it turned out great. I also halved it because I don’t need two loaves. It freezes and thaws well. I definitely plan on making it again!

Really good. Halved the recipe and made in my Zojirushi. Bread collapsed even though I used the quick bread option. Still good crumb and flavor. Next time I'll try and not proof the yeast first or I'll lame the top before it bakes.

This is a good, fine textured bread.  It makes good sandwiches, plain or toasted. I did change it a bit - used unsalted butter in place of margarine. I didn't have bread flour on hand, so used the all-purpose white. Kneading  for about 8 minutes in the mixer was sufficient. Will likely make it again.

This bread was very tasty.  But a little heavy for my liking.  I am going to make it again but increase the yeast to see if I can lighten it up.

Wonderful! Amazing taste, texture, taste, crust,taste, appearance, and taste. I've enjoyed commercial Buttermilk bread for many years, but after this, it will only be a feeble substitute - turned to out of desperate circumstances like a malfunctioning oven, extended travel, or broken arms!

This recipe is delicious!! I added 2 eggs and used real butter, and the flavor is phenomenal!! It was a bit dense because I used AP flour, but I will try again with bread flour.

This recipe is fabulous but I changed it a little:  I used 2 1/2 C bread flour and 1/4 c white wheat flour.  I also used butter instead of margarine and honey in place of the white sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of diastolic malt powder.  The flavor was exceptional and the bread was moist and lighter texture than whole wheat breads I have had before.  It is so easy to make, I make it often!

This was wonderful.  Husband was still looking for it a few days after we had completed the second loaf.  I used All Purpose flour instead of Bread flour, Fat Free Buttermilk, and unsalted butter.  I made more about 15 minutes ago and it's on it's first rise.  Can't wait till dinner tonight.

It is a wonderful recipe! Soft and tender crumb-perfect for hamburger buns as well as dinner rolls and warm loaves from the oven. This is now my "go-to" recipe for homemade sandwich rolls. Stays soft-my son says he asks for hamburgers just to have me make these. The rolls in the picture just came out of the oven, then were brushed with honey butter-yum!

This is, without a doubt, the best bread I have ever tasted!  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  I didn't change a thing except I kneaded the bread on an oiled surface instead of floured.  It came out moist and delicious.  Will definitely be making this again.

This made really good toast for breakfast, but we are hooked on Grandma VanDoren's white bread to have with meals.

This bread turned out perfectly, very yummy, would be great with BLTs and made wonderful toast. Not a crumb left!

This bread has a beautiful texture and flavour.  It keeps well for many days.  It also makes the best grilled cheese on toast when it's a few days old.  I will continue to make this regularly.  My husband loved it too.

This easy recipe gives you two wonderful loaves. They were a hit at the church soup suppers!

I love this bread! It is light with a subtle buttermilk flavor. I halved the recipe and then split the dough to make two small bagettes. I brushed butter over them before baking for 30 minutes. The crust came out flaky and totally yummy. Esther, you are a genius! Thanks!
