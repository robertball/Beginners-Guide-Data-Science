This is a PERFECT recipe.  Don't be confused by the instructions to knead the batter.  I think the author just means to mix the berries and nuts well.  Instead, I dropped rounded spoonfuls on a baking sheet and baked at 375 for 20 minutes as instructed.  These scones couldn't have been any better from a New York City bakery!  I've made three batches of this recipe in one week and everyone who has tried one has raved (and everyone thinks they must be so hard to make!  I've got them fooled!)   I use the Crasins found next to raisins and leave out the sugar and orange.  For variation, I've substituted chocolate chips and walnuts.  DELICIOUS and PERFECT every time!!!

I substituted 1/2 cup plain yogurt for the half and half cream so they were not a liquidy as some people may have found. I also  added white chocolate to the center. My roomates can't wat until I make them again!

I hate to give a bad rating for this recipe because it looks so yummy and has potential, but it was an absolute disaster!  The recipe calls for way too much cream and not enough flour.  My "dough" was the consistency of muffin batter and I followed the recipe exactly.  Kneeding it was out of the question.

This was so good.  I used dried cranberries instead of fresh, delicious.  I also used sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  Instead of half and half, I used one cup of vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup of skim milk.  I dropped tablespoonfuls and it made 15.  They baked in 17 minutes.  They were fast and easy.  I can't wait to try it again.

As other people mentioned, I had to add some extra flour because the dough was too sticky. I also used dried cranberries (5 ounce bag) as fresh ones were out of season. I added a little water to the dried cranberries so that the sugar would stick. The scones turned out better than I thought they would as I was scraping the still sticky dough off my counter. My brother, who is quite stingy with compliments, said "they were good," which is top rating coming from him. Thanks for the recipe.

We're big scones fans around here and these were excellent. I did add a touch more flour, though scones make a sticky dough. I also drizzled an orange glaze over them when slightly cooled to make them like the ones we get at Starbucks! Very good.

Made these for Thanksgiving.  The dough was extremely sticky, however with additional flour it was just fine.  I omitted the nuts and used craisins instead of fresh cranberries.  A real hit.  My Mom was disappointed that she didn't have one to take home.

VERY delicious and they come out looking and tasting like I hoped!  And fun to make!  I took another reviewers advice and used a small containor of plain yogurt and it was great.  Dough will be sticky, so have extra flour on the side for your board, hands and utensils!

I never made scones before, but I found the dough to be a bit fussy.  I had to add more flour to make it a workable dough to roll.  I rolled it into a 10 inch circle and cut it into 12 wedges with a pizza cutter.  I added cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  The scones had nice texture and flavor.

Made these scones for Thanksgiving and was thankful that I did.  Thye were wonderful.  I did not knead by hand as they were kind of sticky I just mixed in the bowl until they were combined but not over worked.  I did not add extra flour as I  did not want them to be to tough.  This recipe is perfect and you get a nice fluffy scone that is not as dense and others I have tried.  For the others that complained that this dough was to sticky you dont want a heavy scone and this is not heavy and yes it does spread when you bake it.  if you use two cookie sheets and place the dough on it and shape it with your spatula they do turn out perfect.  The only change I made was to use lemon zest as I did not have any oranges.  I have tried other recipes that use lemon with cranberries instead of orange and it is a nice surprise when you bite into it and get the refreshing lemon burst.  Loved these so much I am making another batch right now.  This will be the only scone recipe I will use.  Despite a few of the low ratings this really is the best scone recipe.  The only thing I can say is that they bake much better in a gas oven than electric.  I have used both and they seem to spread more in an electric oven.

Only, the dough IS too sticky to think about kneading.

These scones are really good.  I needed to add about 1/2c more flour, and I substituted dried cranberries for the fresh, and they were exceptionally good.  Oh my!

I made these twice over the last week because my grandmother and I liked them so well.  Only problem is the sticky dough...whoever thought that it was possible to knead this was insane!  Second time I made them, I just poured out the dough into two circles on the cookie sheet and just cut them into wedges after they were baked.  I'll try adding more flour next time.

I love this recipe. Made the scones for Mother's Day brunch and they were a big hit! No leftovers. I took the advice of previous reviews: dropped dough by the spoonful on cookie sheet, brushed with egg wash and sprinkled sugar on top of scones and substitued orange craisins. Great flavor and beautiful scones.

The recipe needs a bit more flour than is recommended.  I had to add about 1/2 cup.  The results were great, however!

Tried this recipe yesterday, and I'm making another batch today!  They are really delicious.  Yes, the dough is a bit sticky, but the finished product is slightly moist, not like some scones that are almost too dry to swallow.  I avoided actually adding more flour to the mixture, but I did dip my fingers in flour before trying to pat each half of the dough into a flat circle.  That seemed to work fine as far as making the dough a little easier to work with.

These were a very bad thing for my family to have discovered. They are not overly sweet, which I love, and they are addictive. The only change I made to this was to dribble on a little orange glaze over the top of the warm scones, and I think it really finished them off nicely. They remind me of Christmastime. And it helps that my kids eat the heck out of them!

i had to substitute cherries for cranberries because in the winter my grocery store has very limited fruit supply. 
also, i had to add flour because when i added the cream and egg it didn't quite make a 'dough'

I have no idea how these taste, as they are still in the oven.  I wish I had read these reviews first; I usually do that. The dough was wayyyyy too sticky.  So I figured I'd do drop scones instead of rolling them out. I have made scones that way before.  Well, these are in the oven and are all spread out.  I'm sure these need at least 1/4 to 1/4 cup more of flour.  What a waste of good ingredients.

I was a little worried making this, I've never made scones before.  They remind me of tea biscuits.  The dough is VERY sticky.  When I separated the dough and cut them in to wedges, I used flour dusted wax paper to set the dough on and extra flour as needed.  You're triangle wedges will not be the exact same size but don't try to get them perfect.  I found that when I put them on the cookie sheet I was worried by their appearance, but as they came out of the oven they looked good.  In the end the taste made up for the trouble.  I wouldn't make these everyday but they are a great treat throughout the holiday season.  My rating is a 4.5 for taste and a 3.5 to a 4 for ease. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe!! I used the new orange flavored crasins and they gave it a great flavor and I omitted the sugar as they were already sweetened. My husband who hates scones said that he liked these because they were not as dry and crumbly as others he has had.

A lovely, soft scone.  The batter was definitely softer than "kneadable", so I just dropped it in mounds onto the baking sheet and flattened them a bit.  The flavor is great- the citrus really compliments the cranberries.

The recipe doesn't really say when to add the fruit/nuts, so I did it after the wet ingredients and kneeded it in.  Turned out really well!

Nice scones, but they are more like muffins than scones to me.  I've made a lot of scones, and the batter tends to be very sticky, but this, as a few other reviewers mentioned, was more like muffin batter.  Not to be derailed, I added some more flour and plopped the circle of dough batter onto a plastic, oven safe mat, then used a pizza cutter to make lines before going in the oven.  They turn out soft and a little moist, unlike scones.  They taste really good, though, and I'm sure would make great muffins or round scones.  Since I really wanted the traditional shape of scones, I just went with it.  If you want more traditional scones flavor, I'd use probably at least half the liquid at least initially and then go from there.  The cranberries, while great with the tartness, probably also adds to the wet factor, so you could try dried cranberries and eliminate the white sugar as well instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

Tried this out a while ago. Used rasins instead of cranberries and it turned out great! It's so easy to do too. For more color though, I brushed the top of each scone with eggwash (eggyolk+milk) so that they come out Golden Brown after baking. Received great reviews from my family. Enjoy!

I substituted fresh blueberries halved for the cranberries and omitted the walnuts.  Once everything was combined the "dough" had the consistency of a muffin batter and was incredibly sticky. It was impossible to knead or roll out. I added about 1/2 cup of flour as suggested by other users but the consistency still wasn't thick enough. In total I probably added 1.5 cups of flour just to make the batter workable. While they look great, they came out quite bland in the flavor department. I doubt I'll try this recipe again.

I followed the recipe (almost) exactly, adding a bit more fresh cranberries (half of a small bag) and a bit more chopped walnuts (about 3/4 cup).  The dough was sticky, but not so much that it couldn't be folded over on itself in a light kneading on a board with about 1 tsp. of flour.  I topped the scones with coarse sugar before baking rather than make a frosting to drizzle on. I highly recommend this recipe.  The additional cranberries and walnuts ensure some in every bite.  Delicious and beautiful!

These are great!  I followed the original recipe and the dough was PERFECT!  Not too sticky or too dry.  The taste is out of this world and I am going to try the orange glaze on a few to see how that is.  They are just fine without though. Can't wait to try the recipe with different extras as suggested in other reviews.  This a real keeper ....soooo easy!

A word of warning to viewers... don't substitute orange extract for the orange zest.  I was out of oranges so I decided to use orange extract.  The alcohol reacted with something in the recipe and the dough turned a bluish-green color.  The scones tasted ok, but they were so hideous colored that I had to throw them out.

These were very delicious. I used an ice cream scoop to portion out the dough instead of forming it into circles and cutting it. I ended up with 8 scones this way and plan to use a smaller scoop next time and shorten the baking time.

This is by far, my favorite scone recipe!!  I think the key to this recipe is letting the dough rest in the refrigerator for 1/2-1 hr.  This made my scones really light and fluffy!  As most have done, I've tweaked the recipe according to my own taste.  This includes just 3/4 cups of craisins (fresh cranberries are hard to find year round, and 1 cup of craisins was just a little much for me), and a little over 1/4 cup of brown sugar (for the scones to be a little more sweet).  The stickiness of the dough doesn't bother me b/c I end up not having to kneed it.  Instead, I slowly pour in the cream and egg mixture while using a spatula to mix everything in until it's moist/sticky.  I usually end up not using all of the cream/egg mix, and use the rest as a glaze for the scones.  Then I top off the glaze w/ a sprinkle of sugar. =) Compared to other scone recipes that I've seen, this is a really healthy alternative.

This was my first time ever making scones.  I appreciated the ease of the recipe and the simplicity of the incredients (everything almost always in my pantry).  The only change I made was using dried cranberries as that is what I had on hand.  The only thing preventing me from giving this recipe five stars is the fact that the dough was extremely sticky and difficult to handle and I had to flour both my hands and the board more than "lightly" in order to make the rounds and cut them into wedges.  That done, they baked up perfectly:  Not at all dry/crumbly and were very flavorful.  My sister and I enjoyed them with our after-dinner coffee.  Will definitely be making these again in the near future.  Thanks, Cristina Gomez, for this wonderful scone recipe.

Just baked these today! I used frozen cranberries and substituted plain yogurt for the cream. I ended up needing to add an entire extra cup of flour because following the recipe exactly gave me soupy "dough." I also made a tasty glaze for them using powdered sugar and orange juice squeezed from the orange used for zest. Tasty!

Delicious! Worked out great, the first batch was gone right out of the oven, so I had to make a second batch on the same day. Used dried cranberries and omitted the white sugar, and mixed 1 3/4 c white flour with 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for a healthier alternative.

Made these with my 3-yr-old twins who love to "make-a make-a" anything with me.  They were very easy to make, exceptionally fragrant, moist and flavorful.  I made two batches and they kept well in a zip-top bag for 2 days, after which everybody asked me to make more.  One batch I made with the fresh cranberries as the recipe called, and one with cranberry raisins.  Both were excellent.

I made the recipe as is except for the walnuts.  The dough is indeed too sticky, and I was scrupulous about keeping the butter cold, cut in like a good pastry, and not over-handling the dough.  I would definitely reduce the half and half from 3/4 of a cup to 1/2 cup, but add about one more tablespoon of butter to make up for the fat loss.  The flavor was good - just the dough was not very workable, and the texture was too soft for scones.

The scones were actually quite tasty. I substituted slivered almonds for the walnuts. But, the batter was really wet (noted by some others), and the scones ended up almost having the consistency of bread rather than the satisfying denseness of a scone.

This is a great base recipe. I made a few changes which is the only reason I have it a 3. 
Instead of nutmeg I used cinnamon, instead of cream I used a 1/2 cup of far free Greek yogurt. I did not add the nuts. I also cut the orange after zesting and used half of the juice. I just dropped spoonfuls onto the cookie sheet instead of shaping and cutting it. Amazing!!!

They taste really good, but they were a mess before they baked.  They were way too sticky, so I added flour so I could handle them and get them onto the baking sheet.

These were fabulous!  I used half cream/half milk because I didn't have any half-and-half, left the cranberries whole, and used ground pecans instead of walnuts.  After baking, I used some of the juice from the orange I zested and combined it with a cup of powdered sugar to brush onto the warm scones.  Perfect cold weather breakfast treat!

Used craisins so did eliminated step with sugar and orange. Used Splenda brown sugar blend - otherwise followed recipe exactly. Looking forward to trying with other additions (e.g. chocolate chunks, raisins, etc).

Very easy to make and tastes wonderful. Scones are a bit sticky from my experiences, so that wasn't a surprise to me. My entire family loved it and it's a way for me o use cranberries.

I made a couple of adjustments to the recipe.  I only used one-half cup of 1/2 and 1/2 which was plently of liquid.  I did still need to add a bit more flour when I kneaded the dough.  I dusted the top of the scones with bakers' sugar before baking.  I brought them for a "food day" at work.  They were very well received.

Wow, these were really good! My family loved them and they don't normally like scones. I didn't have half and half so I used a half cup of milk instead. The batter was still very moist so I added an extra 1/4 c of flour to coat it. Also didn't use the nuts or orange zest. These were really moist, which I liked. Next time I think I will try blueberries instead.

Great recipe! My mom is a big scone fan so I whipped these up for Mother's Day morning w/ some butter and preserves. She loved them! I didn't have fresh cranberries on hand so I used dried cranberries, and I also did not have any half & half so I used about 1/2 c plain yogurt & some nonfat milk. I decided to spoon the batter into heart-shaped muffin tins and they turned out super  cute. I lightly patted the dough into the tins w/ a bit of water on my fingertips, it helped keep the dough from sticking on my hands. Definitely a keeper recipe I will be making again, maybe next time w/ chocolate chips!

This is so good!  I didn't have half and half so I substituted 1/3 heavy cream and 2/3 buttermilk and it was perfect.  I had to bake them a little longer (10 minutes) but I think that's because I used a stone instead of a sheet pan. Anyway, the texture was perfect. The dough was a little sticky, but I added 1/4 cup more flour and it made it more manageable (but still sticky enough!). YUM.

I made these for Christmas morning and my parents loved them! The were fluffy and tender. In place of the half and half I used 1/2 cup of lowfat plain yogurt and 1/4 cup 2% milk.. I thought this gave a good consistency - the dough was a bit wet but it formed into circles easily enough. Also, I made 8 larger scones instead of twelve, partly because I did not realize quite how much they would rise and expand when baked. I would definitely recommend using a large cookie sheet and leaving ample room in between the scones. Parchment paper made for easy cleanup. Overall, a delicious recipe.

These are delicious! They turned out just as I had hoped - not too sweet, not too heavy, and with a great balance of orange and cranberry. I enjoy having one large scone for breakfast so after dividing the dough into half I cut only four wedges, not six. I also sprinkled a touch of cane sugar on the top of each and baked them for 18 minutes. They came out perfect! Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe for a Christmas Breakfast. They turned out really well. I didn't use half-and-half because I didn't have any on hand, so I used about a half cup of 2% milk. I used dried cranberries instead of real ones because the flavor isn't as bitter and is more sweet. I didn't have to mix them with water as one person did, since the sugar seemed to stick pretty well. I skipped out on the walnuts. Overall it is really good recipe and most everyone liked them.

I made these for breakfast Christmas morning.  These were great!  I left out the walnuts due to nut allergies in my family.  I also skipped the kneading and dropped the dough onto a parchment covered cookie sheet by spoon.  I made 20 small scones.

Amazing recipe! I used orange flavored Craisins and help back 1/4 cup of the half and half. They were easy to shape and the finished consistency was perfect. My friends loved them so much that I gave all but one away. Delicious! Thanks!

First time making or eating scones.... I  read all the reviews and made a few adjustments. I used raisins and cinnamon, instead of cranberries and nutmeg,  and evaporated milk instead of half and half since that is what I had on hand;  otherwise I followed the ingredients. I stirred the ingredients together rather than trying to knead it. After mixing the egg/milk mixture in with the dry ingredients, I allowed it to rest for about 5 minutes or so. The mixture was sticky, more like a thick batter than a bread dough, but rather than add additional flour to be able to roll, I just used a serving spoon and spooned portions onto the baking pan. The end result was nicely browned on the outside and tender inside. With butter and jam, my family gave them 2 thumbs up! I will be making them again.  Thanks!

This is delicious-just took my first batch of these out of the oven. They are tender, moist and oh so lovely. I made a few tweaks only because it's what I had on hand.
I used fresh cranberries, which I chopped coarsely in the food processor with the walnuts and then set aside and dusted the berry/nut mix with 1/4 c white sugar. I omitted the nutmeg, but I placed the  other dry ingredients in the order given, into the work bowl of the processor and pulsed a few times. I added the butter cubes and pulsed a few more times, till it resembled corn meal. I used 1/2 c vanilla Greek yogurt in place of the half and half, and and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and beat it with the egg before adding to the work bowl. Pulsed a few times. Turned out on a floured board and kneaded maybe 5 times, shaped and cut as directed. Baked on a buttered and floured baking sheet as instructed. I will be making these again.

Loved this recipe! Lost of folks said it needed a dash more flour so I did that, but then I needed to add a bit more cream to even it out, so all in all, leave it alone I think. Also, I used blueberries and had to kind of make them cookie shaped, but with an orange glaze this was lovely. Thank you for a great recipe and I hope to see more from you!

Delicious!  For half the dough I added semi sweet chocolate chips.  Both were good but liked it best without the chips. My parents loved them!

As a previous reviewer suggested, I substituted 1/2 cup yogurt and a splash of heavy cream and milk for the half and half.  I also substituted a couple splashes of almond extract (approx. 1t) for the orange rind and nuts.  Delicious!

Loved these..and i am a scone snob..very light and soft.  Not crusty hard and dry like some scones.  I added white chocolate chips and used whipping cream.  Then I drizzled orange glaze on top while warm.  Also just dropped by spoon onto baking sheet..turned out perfect and very tasty.

This was pretty good. They had a strange texture, maybe because I didn't add enough extra flour and the dough was moist. They tasted good, just didn't look the best.

I love the flavor of this scone.  I did have to make a few adjustments when I made them.  I too found the batter a bit sticky and hard to work with even on a floured surface.  I used a cast iron scone pan which makes 8 scones and the batter did fill all 8 molds.  I simply spooned portions of the sticky dough in the pan and baked them.  It took mine about double the time to bake.  It was worth the wait.  They were simply deeeeeeeelicious.  Gave some to a few co-workers.  So nice and moist and such yummy flavor.  I topped them with a bright orange flavored powdered sugar glaze.  For sure will make these again.

I made these fantastic scones twice in a week. The first time I prepared the recipe as stated although I did not knead the dough.  I used a tablespoon to drop them onto a cookie sheet.  The second group were even more delicious!  I used a little white sugar to roll each scone and I replaced the walnuts with pecans.  Outrageously delicious!

good flavor and easy to make, i'll probably add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour next time so they don't flatten out so much.

After reading the comments, I used only 1/2 cup of cream. NO KNEADING for scones, and I have the KAF mini scone pan that I use for brownies as well. Love the crispy edges.

Flavors are there, but I couldn't grade the texture because I kept having to add more flour - maybe 3/4 c more - and the dough became gluey.  Way off on the liquid to dry ratio.

I did this recipe as directed. Yes, the scones were very wet with the batter, so instead of adding so much flour, I simply split the recipe in half, dusted them with flour, then put each into a sprayed glass bread pan. No rolling, no fuss, and easy to cut into triangles after they cooled. Now I need a glaze recipe of some sort.

I made this recipe after reading the reviews, so I added an extra 1/2 stick of butter and half cup of flour, also substituted frozen blueberries for cranberries. They were still too sticky to knead, so I just formed the dough into 2 circles on a cookie sheet and cut into triangles. Absolutely not a scone, but a tasty cross between a muffin and a cake. We liked them as they were tasty, but the texture was simply not sconelike at all. I'm still looking for a wonderful scone recipe.

These taste fantastic!! I ended up making them with yogurt (vanilla) instead of the half and half. The flavor was great. The dough was a little loose so I worked it a little too much...next time I'll know

I took these to a pre-Christmas celebration and I got rave reviews ("best scones I've ever tasted" from my mom!).  For those that complain the batter is to runny, make sure to beat your cream and egg for awhile, do not just mix it.  I had no problem kneading the dough or shaping it to cut perfect looking scones.  I used craisins and toped with Orange Glaze 1 from this site.  Wonderful!

I loved these. I made them essentially the way the recipe called for, but I added a few drops of lemon extract and orange glaze. I counter acted the stickiness others reported by rounding the flour measurements. My king never had scones before. He ate them all in one sitting.

I've never had sconed before, so I didn't really know what to expect, but I think they turned out well. The orange zest is really important, and I topped with 'Simple Orange Glaze' from this site, which gave them the extra sweetness I was looking for.

VERY GOOD as the recipe is. I made two circles over a baking sheet, mark the sections with a knife and put them in the oven. At 3/4 baking time cut wedges all the way through and brushed tops with 2 tablespoons of the cream/egg mix. I happen to have some bittersweet ganache leftover, took scones out of the oven and just for fun drizzle half with the chocolate... My family and I found that this little addition improves and enhance the flavors to make them EXCELLENT!!!

These were such a delicious treat.  We threw in craisins because I didn't have enough cranberries and they were just as yummy, a bit sweeter.  I used a basic sugar glaze recipe and did some zigzags to make them look pretty and a bit sweeter, cause I have a sweet tooth.  Everyone loved them, and they looked expensive like they came right out of Starbucks.

These scones are DELICIOUS.  I may have changed the recipe enough that I can't give an honest rating/review, but I still highly recommend it. I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg, dried cranberries instead of fresh, and I omitted the nuts. I didn't have an orange or half-and-half on hand, and ended up using orange yogurt and a splash of milk (until the texture was dough-like) in place of them.  I also baked them as drop scones rather than fighting the dough into shape.  My husband and I both love them and will likely be making another batch soon!

These are good scones, but I'll make a few modifications next time around.  As with other reviewers, the dough ended up WAY too sticky.  I ended up using much more flour just to handle it.  I may try the yogurt suggestion next time.  The taste though is very good, and they ended up nice and moist with a nice burst of that tart/sweet cranberry in there.  Thanks!

I added more flour, just as others have mentioned. I also doubled the amount of cranberries called for and tripled the orange zest. I didn't include the nuts. I was worried that I had overdone it, but they actually came out really well. I don't like it when scones are too thick, so I was happy with this recipe.

Great recipe but I did make some changes.
I used heavy cream (only because I had some that needed using up)
I used white chocolate chips instead of walnuts.
Do not overmix or knead the dough.
I simply grabbed a blob (2 tablespoons or more) and plopped them onto a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
Yummy

These were better than I was expecting... I was thinking way to much sugar and liquid; but wanted to give it a try anyway.  I only needed 1/4 c more flour to get the dough to a good scone consistency.  I did brush a little half and half on the top to help w/ the browning.  To get the proper thickness I was only able to pat out into  one 8" round and cut out 8 scones.  Not sure I will make again, I don't feel the brown sugar added enough "umph" to make it worth changing from my normal cranberry scone recipe.

Delicious scones! Like others have said, just skip the kneading and plop 9-12 spoonfuls of dough on the baking sheet. I served these with strawberry jam and mock Devonshire cream -- everyone had seconds!

I've made this recipe several times, and it always draws rave comments.  The only alteration I'd recommend is to use a little more flour, maybe 1/4 cup.  Also, I prefer more traditionally shaped scones, so I shape them into balls on the cookie sheet.  Enjoy!

We liked these scones but as others have mentioned, the dough is too sticky as written. The dough could not be "formed" into circles for cutting...ended up having to blop the dough on the sheet pan and cook as blobs. They tasted great but looked like drop biscuits. Will be incorporating more flour next time so the dough can be handled properly.

Great recipe for scones! I followed the recipe as is until I realized my cranberries were bad so I substituted Craisins. I also didn’t have half and half but I did have heavy cream. After mixing, my dough was too dry so I cut the orange in half and squeezed the juice of half the orange into the batter. Just before placing the scones in the oven, I sprinkled them with some turbano sugar. I used the juice from the other half of the orange, mixed it with some powdered sugar and made a glaze which I drizzled over the finished scones. They tasted AMAZING! I have now made this recipe three times in the same manner. I varied the shape each time (triangles, biscuits circles, and ice cream scoop balls) watching the baking time for doneness.

I’ve made many different types of scones. My favorite is cranberry orange. I chose this one because it didn’t have a long list of ingredients that wouldn’t have made that much difference anyway. The only thing I changed was I added 2 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2 cups and 1/4 cup Splenda instead of white sugar.  The 1/2 extra cup of flour made for a better dough. The Splenda instead of sugar cut down the calories, if only a small amount.  They were absolutely delicious!

The batter was too moist to knead so I just used a large scoop. 
 They came out wonderful (and moist!)  I also made a glaze with the juice from the zested orange.

Absolutely loved these! I totally missed the part where I was supposed to chop the cranberries and instead left them whole. Still amazing! Also I didn’t have half and half so I used whipping cream. They had to bake a little longer but they were fantastic! Made them yesterday and they’re almost all gone!

These turned out great. I’d made scones once before but they came out dry but this recipe works. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used lime zest instead of lemon, didn’t have cream so added quarter cup butter to 3/4 cup milk, I used honey and added some chopped pecans. Delightful!

No changes -- maybe I should have added 1/2 cup flour as many others did.  The batter/dough looked fine in the bowl but as soon as I put it on the baking sheet it started spreading out.  These ended up looking like large flat-ish crosses between a cookie and cake.  The taste is OK, but it's not something I'll make again.

Delightful way to use up the cranberries I found in the freezer.  I didn't change anything and they were wonderful.  Next tine I might add almond extract as suggested and maybe more orange flavor - but they were wonderful as is.

i made a triple batch but the batter was very runny. i ended up adding 2 more cups flour, 1T baking powder, 1/4 t cinnamon a nd 1/4 t salt to the triple batch . it thickened it up and they came out delicious.  i wish i new how to make the sugary crunchy top  for scones like you get in the bakery, i prefer that over the frosting.

This was the second time I made this recipe. I love scones, especially when they have a little crunch. I doubled up on the butter and cooked them just a tad longer then 20 min. They are just absolutely delicious!

Delicious!  I did not change the recipe at all.  I did, however, make a little frosting using my leftover orange for the juice in the powdered sugar.

After reading the reviews I also substituted 1/2 cup yogurt for 1/2 cup of the half and half.  My yogurt was plain nonfat and the dough was a little dryer than other bakers described.  But the result was very tasty.  If I make them again I will use the full fat yogurt to compare the difference.  I do like to lower the fat and sugar when possible.

Made it as described. Per the other reviews the batter was sticky but that did not bother me.  Scones were more moist and light than I thought they would be. Very tasty and not too sweet. I also added dried cranberries and a little orange extract as I did not have any oranges. I added a sweet, smile orange glaze to half of them. I would put marmalade on the others.  Would also make smaller ones next time as these are sizable if you make just 6. A keeper for those who love scones. Recipe was straightforward.

I doubled the butter, cut down the cream to 1/2 c and things turned out fine- I saw that some people had issues with the “batter”.. so I added cream a little at a time starting with 1/4 cup. For the folks who had trouble with it being too watery check your liquids twice- also I did use a very large egg. I like my scones moist so I added the extra butter - I also like a bit of egg wash and sugar sprinkled on top. They’re great!

Reading the reviews, I decided to make a half batch. I used 1/4 cup of half and half for the half batch.  They turned out great, I baked exactly 18 minutes on convection setting. Great recipe provided you cut down the moisture.

I made this and thought it came together perfectly.  The only alteration I made was to use whipping cream, because that is what I had on hand.  I also used maple syrup instead of granulated sugar.  Because I didn't have an orange I used a lemon.  I mixed it all together with my hands and put it on baking paper, shaped it and baked it for 25 minutes.  I didn't find it as sticky as others were commenting on.

There is a problem with this recipe.  If I use the ingredients as listed, the batter is very thin and goopy, just like others have described.  I used the yogurt as some suggested, but the batter was still far too thin to roll out.  So bakers have to choose if they want to use  the ingredients as written and then drop the scones on a baking sheet with a spoon, or if they want add LOTS  of  extra flour and perhaps cut back on the amount of liquid, so that they end up with a firm enough dough to roll out and cut into circles, as the recipe instructs.  I went with the second option.  The results taste okay, but are a bit chewy. The next time I want to use up left-over  cranberries, I'll look for a different recipe.

I have made these twice in the last couple of weeks and will be making another batch tomorrow. The dough is very sticky and since making the first batch I have purchased a dough scraper. Using a spatula I turn the batter out onto my flour covered granite countertop and sprinkle flour on top and keep lifting and turning the dough. I forms a nice 6" circle that I cut into 6 wedges and lift with the dough scraper and set individual wedges on my baking pan. ( I bought my metal scraper at Bed Bath and Beyond and I love it!) Thank you for this recipe, I follow it exactly other than a little more flour while kneading.

I have a favorite local coffee shop that sells scone mix..but it was closed when I needed it, so I tried this recipe with a couple variations... I used frozen raspberries, white chocolate chips and skipped the nutmeg and orange zest. I sprinkled white sugar on the tops and baked about 17 minutes in convection oven.  They turned out great...and were so much more affordable.  I'm hanging on to this recipe.

This recipe needs more flour.   After mixing all of it the dough was so sticky. I had to keep kneading and coating it with flour. Once it became semi manageable I used a bakers spatula coated again with flour to flatten a circle to cut into segments.   They turned out delicious.  Just the next time I’ll add a half cup more flour.

Great recipe. I used pearl sugar on the top (before baking) and also I made a light drizzle for the top using powdered sugar, milk and a dash of orange flavoring. I will sell these in a coffee shop so I made the recipe into 6 instead of 12.

Loved this! I didn't have half and half, so I substituted whipping cream and a little milk. At the last minute, I tossed in about a tablespoon of fresh orange juice, too. They are amazing! I'm going to try with blueberries and lemon next time!

I decided to try scones today. So easy and these are really good! Per the reviews, I substituted 1/2 c of regular yogurt for the half and half and I put pecans instead of walnuts. I will definitely make these again.

These are hands down the best scones. Tender, moist, sweet and tart.  I did not knead the dough, just folded in the flour in the bowl. I omitted the walnuts (not nut funs here) and added a spoonful of homemade cranberry sauce to the center of each scone before baking. My husband says they are the best scones I've ever made.

I don't like to rate things that I change, but perhaps this will be helpful.  I used sour cream, rather than cream, and the dough turned out just right.  I also used a food processor, rather than doing by hand.  For scones, use a light touch!  Nothing more than a few pulses.  Also let the scones rest 10 minutes, prior to baking. These taste so fresh and zesty, they are wonderful!  I add a glaze of confectioners sugar, butter, orange juice and zest mixed together, after they cool.

Not a good scone recipe
This dough was way too wet and very hard to work with. The pic has a yummy looking glaze on the scones but there is no recipe for it. I made My glaze with powdered sugar, orange juice and orange zest. 
I will be looking for a new recipe.

These were the first scones I had ever made and they were delicious.  I've made them several times; always at Christmas.  They were a real hit when I hosted a table at an Advent Tea.  The only thing I change is to substitute pecans for walnuts, as I always have a big supply in the freezer.  Don't be put off by the fact that they are not easily kneaded -- like, not at all for me.  I just schmoosh it all into a circle and cut into wedges and manage to transfer them to a parchment lined baking sheet.  Yes, the dough is really sticky, but you will develop your technique after a couple of bakings.  You'll love these!

The recipe as written is useless. I had to add about 1 cup flour to mke it hold shape. With 50% more flour, all the other ingredients were out of proportion. I kneaded in more sugar, nutmeg and cranberries and they were still bad. There are better recipes on this site- use them

The only change I made was using 1/2 cup cream, based on other reviews that the dough was too runny. The dough worked great for me and I sprinkled a little sugar on the top to sweeten them up for my kids before I baked. (the glaze recipe should be included here too). This recipe will be a regular!

would defintley make again- would use less cranberries though, or at least make sure the cranberries are ripe enough too because i used a cup of fresh cranberries and it was really sour, but still pleasant.

After reading the reviews, I doubled the butter (to 8 TBS) and cut the  milk/cream down to 1/2 cup. Texture was still a little soft, but the outside was nicely crusty and the flavor was wonderful. A real hit with everyone.

I made these a second time and found that if you add all the milk egg  mixture the dough will be runny and if you drop by tablespoons you will have a drop scone. For a traditional scone only add the amount of mixture needed to bring dough together. If you use a lower fat dairy product it will bake out as cookies. They are very tasty, soft and flaat.

The only problem I had, was that the dough was too wet to separate and make circles.  I even tried adding a little more flour.  So I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop dough onto cookie sheet.

Taste was good, BUT dough consistency was way off. Even with an added 1/2 c. of flour, dough was still far too sticky to think about shaping. Rather than continuing to add flour, I finally scooped them out like really wet drop biscuits. . . I think I'd start with half the liquid called for and add from there as needed. (And, yes, I AM an experienced cook.) :-) I have noticed that many of the other 5-star rated scones on this site call for an egg wash--not for the egg to be incorporated into the dough. Doing that would also decrease the liquid a good bit and would probably mean that you did not need to add a lot of extra flour. . . Just an idea--haven't tried it that way. Again, they tasted good!

I have made this recipe several times  just as stated and other times with lemon peel instead of orange. Less is more when it comes to handling the dough. As my mom always said " if you want good scones...get them into the oven quick".                    Thank you for a delicious recipe!!

These are amazing. However, I did make a few changes.  I added 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of coconut flour.  I also soaked my cranberries in 1/4 of orange juice along with the recommended sugar.  Last sub is a 1/2 cup of homemade plain kefir instead of the cream. Adding an orange glaze for the top is delish.

This was literally exactly what I was looking for!!  They came out perfect!  I've already printed out the recipe.  Thanks!  On the second batch I made I also added the juice of a lemon and added lemon zest rather than orange.  Its pretty good as well, but the original recipe is better.  Ty!

I cut in the butter into the dry ingredients, in a  large bowl , dug a hole in the flour and added the eggs and cream. I used heavy whipping cream. I rolled the fruit in the sugar. Mixed slightly, then take it to the bench and pastry cloth, work with gloves on to keep it easy to clean your hands. I used course sugar on top. Roll out cut into triangle  shape and rework till finished. My wife said not sweet enough, but a scone isn't sweet it should have a good fruit flavor. I think this gets a 5-star from me.

Instead of half and half which I did not have I used sour cream mixed with soy milk.  We replaced egg by the soy pulp (residue from soy milk making). 
Easy to follow recipe and very tasty (not too sweet either)

I did not make the disk.  I just dropped spoonfuls of the dough.
I did 15 min at 375.
Really flavorful.
I made an icing with more orange peel, some lemon and orange juice and powdered sugar.   Added the final touch

This recipe sounded good so I tried it. I didn't have half and half so substituted evaporated milk. Also substituted pecans for walnuts. Had to add a little extra flour when ready to kneed and shape. I live at a mile high so might have been a factor. These turned out to be the best scones I have ever made.  Husband loved them. They were not dried out at all. Yummy!

I made this recipe substituting the cranberries with Crasins and I used vanilla yogurt in place of milk.  The texture was perfect, crunchy and the the combination of all the flavors in these scones was delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.

These scones turned out as flat as pancakes, even after I added flour, kneaded them, and attempted to cut them into triangles. They oozed all over the cookie sheet. The flavor was great. Perhaps changing the heavy cream to buttermilk will fix these sad scones. I will not be making them again.

My husband and I thought that this cranberry orange walnut scone recipe is excelllent. I substituted whole wheat flour for half of the all purpose flour. I also reduced the amount of half and half cream to half a cup in an attempt to correct the problem that some reviewers faced regarding the stickiness of the dough. Half a cup of cream gave me the perfect consistency to form the dough into balls, flattening them into 6-inch discs and cutting them into wedges. I will definitely continue to make these, particularly, if I want to impress guests and family with delicious breakfast or brunch!

I loved this.  I used a 6 oz carton of plain yogurt.  I had to add a little milk.  I also grated my cold butter - made it a breeze to cut in.  I did not knead.  I put teaspoons of the batter into the mini cupcake pans.  they turned out so cute.  and my hubby loved them.  He usually does not like stuff like this.  I took the other half of the batter and dropped by large teaspoons on a parchment covered cookie sheet and cooked them.  Yummy..

I doubled this recipe according to calculations. The "dough" was so sticky, I could not handle it. I added up to an extra cup of flour and it still looked like muffin batter. So I had to make muffins.
Very disappointed as I was making this for someone from England and I wanted to surprise her with authentic scones.

just tried this recipe; great as is! Haven't a clue how others are getting muffin batter from this unless perhaps they didn't properly chill butter. Was a typical wet scone dough. One must keep flour to the side of pastry board when kneeding dough and be sure to have hands floured as well but don't actually add extra flour to the recipe or your scones will be tough & dry. Thanks this is a keeper ;)

Absolutely delicious! As a treat, I made this for my "border-line" diabetic husband.  I eliminated sugars and zest;  I used 1/2 cup no fat plain yogurt with 1/2 cup dried mixed fruit and 1/2 cup walnuts. He loved the scones, saying it took him back to tea time on our cruises!

Omitted orange zest and nuts... not bad. not fantastic. might be better with omitted items. Would make again but change a few. liquids ARE off... I think you are supposed to add until a dough forms and not add all. added more flour until I reached a bread like consistency and turned out great.

After reading the reviews on this recipe, I reduced the half and half to 1/2 cup and used dried cranberries.  The dough was a bit sticky, but didn't take too much to hand pat out into the 6 inch circles with a floured board after coating them witha bit of flour.  The end result was awesome!!

Made ½ batch with frozen cranberries.  Wonderful!  The 2 of us ate it all in one sitting. I had white sugar throughout, omitted the nutmeg and orange zest, and used a combination of whipping cream and sour cream for the ½ & ½. Next time I'd like to try it with either less sugar &/or more cranberries, and perhaps some oats. Dough was very sticky but I took handfuls, flattened into rounds and patted flour onto both sides before placing onto baking sheet.  Delicate & tasty scones!

Excellent!!! This will be used many more times!! Easy to make. I substituted cinnamon for nutmeg & left out the nuts (finicky husband!) I also squeezed the juice from the orange & added that as part of the ¾ cup half & half. Mine seemed more like a muffing top then scones, maybe cause mine were WAY to sticky to knead. So I just uses about a ¼ cup scoop. Baked them on parchment paper for 18 mins.

Nice flavor...had to add extra flour because the dough was very sticky.  I ended up dropping them by large spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet because the dough was much too wet to roll or form into circles.

I am one of the worse cooks/bakers out there.  I made this recipe because I love scones.  Next time, I will not add the nutmeg as it was too spicy for me. Otherwise, I added a little more cinnamon and wow! What a hit.  I took the batter out of the mixer and placed on a floured counter - pat it down to about 1in.  Took a round biscuit cutter and made these to look like a restaurant.  The flavor was perfect - great with coffee!

Very good, light scones.  I substituted half o fthe white flour for wheat, and used 3/4 c. heavy cream, plus a little whole milk since it was too dry with the cream, and sprinkled some sugar on top before baking.  I prefer fresh cranberries in bread and dried in scones for the sweetness, so I will likely go back to my old recipe, but this one's in the file.

Rave reviews from all -- these rocked.  Definitely making them again.  (It WAS weird to "knead" the dough when it was so sticky -- don't worry about adding a little more flour, but also they're fine all sticky like that.)

These tasted good but they turned out pretty ugly.  The dough was way to wet to roll out, flatten or cut.  I ended up baking them in globs and they flattened out and looked like big cookies.  Also I didn't have quite enough crasins so I threw in 1/2 cup or so of frozen bluberries.

Very good!  I've made a lot of scones, and these are some of the best.  I didn't have half-n-half, so substituted milk with a little heavy cream, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written.  I made these 3 days ago, and they are still soft and moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good; I served them at a group function and they were quickly gobbled up. I added 1/4 c. extra flour based on reviewer suggestions, but this did make the dough thick/dry enough that I had to knead a couple of times to thoroughly mix ingredients. I used dried cranberries too and substituted white chocolate chips for the walnuts. I plan to make another batch this week and I'm thinking of adding a little glaze on the top to make them more dessert-y. :)

This was my first attempt at making scones and it seemed to turn out pretty good. The scones were well liked by everyone...including the one baking them. Didn't make any changes to the recipe. A good recipe for the cranberry season.

Good.  I think I like my scones a bit simpler, though.
