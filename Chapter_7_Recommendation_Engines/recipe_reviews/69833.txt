Okay, so I am a czech cook.  This is a traditional czech meal; however, do NOT use a traditional Czech beer in this or the sauce will come out bitter tasting.  There is no need for the onions, just keep adding water and keep the sauce from drying out and burning.  The sauce from the pork is rich enough without onions. I cook this meal at least every few weeks, thought I would try this version....not so great compared to other czech ways (season the pork with salt/pepper/garlic POWDEr/caraway..add water and roast slowly for 300-325 for 4-6 hours until tender!  Drain sauce and thicken if desired (some don't even thicken so the dumplings soak up the juice from the sauce!)

I'm a huge fan of roast pork, and this is really, really good.  I followed the recipe as it was.  The technique of roasting it covered, then turning, scoring the fat and roasting UNCOVERED  (which I wish the recipe would more specifically state in step 4.  Good cooks can take a lot of knowledge for granted) works perfectly, and the crispy squares of fat were scrumptious.  You crockpot cookers will miss out on that. One thing though.  Check periodically that the bottom doesn't burn, and add some water. If you have a decent meat thermometer, I don't see how anyone can go wrong here.

10 stars! I didn't have any beer (for once) so I used beef broth instead. I would recommend cutting back on the salt, if using beef broth, because the gravy was really salty. But DELICIOUS! The pork was so juicy and tender! I halved the recipe, but used a 3 lb roast. I am so happy with the way it turned out. The rub was absolutely incredible with the pork. I made Fabulous Fried Cabbage to go with it. Simply awesome! I've had this recipe in my box for quite some time, but never got around to making it until now. Thank you so much for the recipe, Sonya!

Delicious recipe!  I made it for a Sunday dinner for company tonight and it was DIVINE!  Only thing I did differently was add a whole can of beer, added carrots and two stalks of celery to the base with the onions, and in the last hour of cooking with the lid off, I added large cubed, seasoned potatoes to roast with the rest of the goodies (tossed them in olive oile and them gave them a shake of herbs de provaunce and seasoned salt).  I didn't think I'd care much for the carroway seeds, but they blended in nicely with the mustard and spices. Thanks so much for the recipe! Practically a one pot meal!  I fried up some fresh cabbage and we were set. This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is an outstanding recipe!
I chose to make it in my Nesco 6 quart roasting oven. Because of this the cooking time changed a little. 

I started it at around 250 degrees. 
Flipped it over after the hour, then turned the heat up to 350. After about an hour I started checking it with the meat thermometer. Within an hour it was around 155. We weren't ready to eat yet, so I turned the temp down to 200 and let it go for another 20 minutes. When I checked it again the temp was around 175. I then pulled the roast out an let it sit while I made the gravy according to the directions. 

My husband said this was the best pork roast he's ever had. 
I only used 2 medium sized onions

This was great! I put it in my crock-pot for the whole day and it was perfect. I skimped a bit on the caraway, as I'm not the biggest caraway fan, but could've used it all (crock-potting can sometimes cause herbs and spices to lose potency). For the gravy, I removed some pan drippings into a saucepan and added the cornstarch to some cold beef broth before mixing in. I didn't need the butter.

Oh my gosh does this meal top the list!!!!
I am czech and always enjoyed when my mom would make pork roast and dumplings. Everything about this meal is comfort food. Would you happen to have the recipe for the dumplings. I've tried myself from semi-translated czech cookbooks with little luck.

This was delicious!  I had about a 2 1/2 lb roast, so I cut the 'rub' ingredients in half.  I cooked this roast at 325 for about 3 1/2 - 4 hours, I added more beer about halfway through as the first bit that I put in had cooked off.  In the end, after removing the pork, I added 1/4 cup of white wine along with nearly 1 cup of water  to the onions and little bit of liquid in the pan.  when it was boiling, I made a 'beurre meunier" with the cornstarch/butter and stirred that into the sauce.  The end result was really flavorful, delicious, fall off the bone pork that even my kids liked.

My husband is a true meat-and-potatoes man who HATES to try anything new.  So when I want to serve something different, I never tell him what it is or what ingredients are in it.

Last night I prepared the Czech roast pork along with fried cabbage (a vegetable he NEVER eats unless it comes with corned beef!) and added two cans of unsalted baby potatoes to the roast during the last hour of baking.  (I first coated them with olive oil, dill weed, garlic powder and a little paprika to add some color.)

He LOVED IT!! (even when he learned about the caraway seeds, the beer and the other unusual ingredients!)  I think this dish has finally convinced him that "maybe" he should be less inflexible where new foods are concerned.

Thank you for a great receipe that I WILL be making again over the holidays.

I never have beer in the house so I used ginger ale! The rub was especially wonderful. The meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor. I needed no added butter to make the gravy, in fact I skimmed most of the fat off before using a bit of water to mix with the cornstarch. Just excellent!!!

Loved this recipe. I used a 2 pound sirloin pork roast, since that's what I already had at home. I used a whole bottle of Harvest Moon beer & added carrots to the pot. I used Gouldens mustard. This was moist & delicious. I was very pleased with how the flavors blended.  We spooned some of the juices over the meat rather than making gravy. The carrots & onions, after simmering in beer were really good too. Served it with cabbage & noodles & fresh baked rye bread.

Very close...as a Slovak cook having grown up with traditional czech/slovak dishes, I was happy to come across this recipe. Like the Czech Cook, I also omit the beer (just use water or it will be bitter), and mustard usually, although cooking pork with mustard is good for tenderizing and adds nice flavor...good for a change. One thing, you CANNOT omit the caraway...it is what makes this dish!! Or the garlic! Also adding other vegetables and different spices will change it completely.

This was easy and so good.  I roasted it on 350 convection and it was a bit overdone 2 hrs after turning it over--next time I'll watch it a little more closely.  This is really good with homemade applesauce, braised cabbage, and pierogis.

Once again, thank you Sonya!  This was delicious with your dumpling and sauerkraut recipe (Knedliky).  I am rating it a four only because my hubby and son are not used to European cooking and found the 2 tablespoons of caraway seeds too much for them (much to my dismay) but they loved the onion based gravy otherwise.  Thanks for restoring some of my heritage!

I grew up on this stuff and it's definitely my comfort food. I make it with lean country style pork ribs that I cut in chunks and put tn in 1 layer in a roasting pan. Then I mix it with salt, pepper, garlic paste, chopped onions and sprinkle with caraway seeds and add little bit of water. then I roast it on 350 with a lid and turn the meat to get some color. Serve it with boiled or mashed potatoes and czech or german style pickles. It's very easy and tasty.

This is a good basic roast recipe bc the meat was perfectly tender. However, I gave it a 3 b/c of two things: 1) You may not be a huge fan of the caraway seeds. Although it was fairly tasty and different -- its more of a one-time dish, as is. Next time I will replace the caraway seeds with a differenct herb or spice.  Even if you like caraway seeds, I would highly recommend using less of them bc/ they were overpowering and the seeds kept getting stuck in my teeth; 2) The recipe did not render sufficient "gravy" . The gravy was delicious and I would have loved more of it!  Note: I added potatoes and carrots to the pan after the one hour mark. They were delicious and this turned it into essentially a one-pot meal. 
Bottom line: I would keep it as a great standard roast recipe which you could personalize by replacing the caraway seeds with your favorite herb.

Nice cold weather meal. It's a nice alternative to the usual way I cook pork roast. The leftover gravy made a great additive to a chicken dish I made the next day.

I have made some wonderful dishes from this site.I have not had a better response than with this recipe. The only thing I changed was to add sauerkraut to the roast during the last hour.I also rinsed the sauerkraut to remove some of the tartness which reminded me of the sauerkraut that I fell in love with while stationed in Germany. I agree this is a traditional European old country style dish. Thank you Sonya. I am ready for more. Chef Roy.

I gave this 4 stars because I am not a cooker of roasts.  The flavor from the recipe was WONDERFUL (rather porketta-ey), the cooking (up to me) was not so good. My tweeks in the recipe included using grainy mustard and beef stock instead of beer (only had a lite beer on hand) and attempting to cook it low and slow.

This dish is now my "signature dish" to cook for family get togethers. Simple, delicious, and fun. My mom has called me multiple times for this recipe.  I have cooked this for first dates and it is always a hit. This is the recipe that made me a believer in this website.

I just tried this in the crock pot.  It was very tasty, moist.  I think the next time I make it I will either do the oven method or brown the meat a little before hand.
For sides I did Sauerkraut with shredded apple, two whole cloves and about 1/4 cup white wine and Spaetzle.

4 1/2 stars. I added (drained) jarred sauerkraut around the roast. Mmmm and served with store bought pierogis. Yum.
14 March 2011 I heated up the left overs of this roast tonight. I can't remember for the life of me why I hadn't given it the full 5 stars. This is going to be my go-to European-style pork roast from now on!

This was wonderful, though I made a few adjustments as well.  First I reduced the reip to 4 servings and went with the directions from there.  I needed to increase the beer to 1/2 cup just to cover the onions.   The recipe wasn' clear to me about removing the foil; so i left it off then decided after one hour to cover again because it was looking dry.  Near the end, it still looked dryer than I thought it should be (out of beer) so I soaked it with a little Bourbon:)    OMG the taste was out of this world!  I don't know exactly what the secret was but my guess was keeping it moist with whatever looked/smelled like it would fit! I will make this again for special company!

Yum! This was delicious. My mother-in-law is Czech, so I thought it would be fun to make something Czech for dinner. I did halve the caraway seeds, and used chicken broth instead of beer. The house smelled wonderful while this was roasting, and the gravy was awesome. I served this with Grated Potato Dumplings (unfortunately those were not well received), and green beans. We can't wait for it to cool down so I can make this again.

We used to live in the Czech Republic, so I was glad to find a recipe for this roast pork.  My husband walked in the door and said, Something smells like Prague!  This was fabulous.  My whole family enjoyed the meal - even my picky eaters.  I did halve the caraway seeds and I'm glad I did.

My dog Maggie loved it too!  Only half of my family got to try this delicious roast before our dog stole it and devoured it.  But I will definitely make it again...and put the dog in her crate.

Thought this recipe was simple and tasty.  The only thing is that my roast was still not as tender as it should be.  I think I will take the suggestion of cooking it at a lower temperature for a longer time.

I made this for Christmas Eve.  My grandpa was Czech and his roast pork, cabbage and dumplings was a family favorite.  This was my first time doing a roast pork and this recipe was pretty simple.  It tasted very similar to Grandpa's roast pork and was very moist and flavorful.

Followed the recipe exactly. Was unable to 'slice' the pork - kind of 'fell apart' as I tried to slice. Maybe my knife blade wasn't sharp enough. The sauce definitely made this a 5* - absolutely fabulous taste to the gravy. The pork wasn't bad either - might add more caraway next time - could barely taste it.

This pork was delicious, came out as moist as can be and had great flavor! I accidentally over peppered the meat, used 2 tablespoons instead of 2 teaspoons, but I had split it between white pepper and mixed up pepper, so it didn't overpower and actually added a nice spicy note, will definitely make this again. I used Saffron flavored Goya seasoning instead of salt and it was superb!

This was fabulous! I forgot the veg oil, but it didn't affect the flavor...just made the paste a little thicker (used stone ground brown mustard). :) I used a 6.5lb boston butt roast, two onions instead of three, and omitted the beer. I did add a few cups of water to the roasting pan--enough to reach about 1/4 way up the side of the roast.  I also nixed the butter and cornstarch in favor of a little Wondra flour/water slurry for the gravy.  The spices were perfect, and adding water to the pan beforehand made gravy a cinch--it needed no extra salt or stock, just a little thickener. The onions added so much flavor. Perfect!! (I did strain the solids and fat out of the drippings before reducing for gravy). Since my meat was bigger, it took about 4 hours to cook. But it was delicious, and I will most certainly make this again!

Made this tonight and it was a HUGE hit with family and guests.  Followed the recipe pretty closely, but added a little more garlic seasoning and onion powder to the paste.  I used a picnic shoulder.  Gravy-hating hubby LOVED the gravy, especially since I added all the onion chunks to it.

This was ok, but there are better pork recipes out there. My husband thought this tasted like rye bread and he found that disquieting. He seems to be the only person who thinks that though. The gravy was really awesome though. I shook some of the drippings in a jar with the cornstarch before adding to the the rest of the gravy to prevent chunks.

This recipe surprised me by how well it turned out. The meat was very moist, tender and flavorful (even though it did look rather gnarly coming out of the oven). My gravy was sweeter that I expected. Was that from the beer? The caraway seeds? It was also slightly bitter, but not in a bad way. I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. My husband and daughter raved. (I only used 1 T of caraway, subbed olive oil for veg oil, and added the whole beer to the pan.) The house smelled great while it was cooking!

This was an awesome dish:)  Even my husband was happy with it and he is not a big pork person.  I made the recipe as is so could rate it based on the recipe.  It was yum, but for my husbands personal prefrence we will use 1 tbsp of the caraway seed next time :)

Wonderful recipe, even without the caraway seeds and sauerkraut that I didn't have on hand. I did mine in the crockpot with great results.  Will try again now that I have all of the ingredients.

This has become my favorite recipe for Roast Pork. The combination of flavors perfectly compliments the pork! Thanks for this recipe. I cannot imagine anyone not liking it, unless they were brought up on "Hamburger Helper". I did however make one substitution. My Mom who is in her late eighties does not like knedliky. So I substitute Potato Dumplings. I personally like both!

The first time I made this I didn't have caraway so I used paprika.  I also placed it in my crock pot for about 5 hours on high.  It kept all the liquid in so I strained the liquid, thickened it as per the recipe directions, and then added the onions back in.  Yum!

The second time I made it I followed the directions exactly (in the oven, open roasting pan) and while the taste was good, the juices/beer evaporated and all I was left with in the pan was roasted onions.  No liquid.  

I think I prefer the crock pot method b/c it allowed for a wicked yummy gravy.  

Both times I made it, there was not a speck of pork left.  Great recipe!

This was very, very good!.
I was afraid at the amount of caraway this recipe has and I feared that my husband would reject it, but, it came out just great and he loved it.
Somehow, the caraway brings out the pork flavor and it helps to make a wonderful gravy.
And the aroma while cooking it?  Divine!, I kept looking at the oven and saying "oh just get cooked, already!".

Eating this was truly an experience!  Very easy to make, and got rave reviews from husband.  I used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder and a Labatt Blue Pilsner which I proceeded to have with dinner.

Very easy to fix, I had a very lean cut of pork, so not much drippings.  My girlfriend is from Prague, and she was blown out that I fixed this along with the dumplings and moravian style kraut!

Good stuff!  Great flavor, I didn't find the caraway to be overwhelming at all.  I didn't have time to let the paste sit on the roast for 30 minutes, but am looking forward to making this again and doing so.  Served with mashed potatoes, sourkraut and green peas.  Everyone in the family ate their supper!

Sautéed onions, green pepper and sauerkraut till all somewhat brown. Then I put them under and around the roast in the drippings  about an hour before the roast was done. No gravy but the tastiest sauerkraut ever!

Excellent recipe.  Reduced caraway seed to 1 Tbsp., used Budsweiser Beer, only had 1 large onion. Amazing when scoring the pork when turning over as instructed - it separated into beautiful diamond squares that ultimately seared to crunchy yummies (chicharrones).  Served with the recipe for Czech Cabbage Dish by dlynn11.  Will definitely keep in the repertoire.

Wow, I don't know which was better, the roast or the gravy.  The roast was tender and flavorful.  The gravy was rich and also flavorful even though we forgot the butter.  We used only one onion and left out the caraway as no one in our family enjoys that flavor.  We were looking for something different and found a real keeper.

My family really enjoyed this. I used a 4 pound roast and reduced the time a little, it came out really tender and yummy. I cut the caraway in half as well because I thought 2 tbs would be to overpowering, I think the one tbs was perfect. Thanks!

Excellent recipe followed exactly as written.  The meat was great, gravy was great and the onions are incredible.  Served this with dumplings and sauerkraut.  I used Sam Adams Boston Lager as the beer and I can't get over the flavor that those onions had.  We served them as a side to go with the meat, dumplings and sauerkraut.

Roast was very good. I used Shiner Bock beer and added a little bit more when I turned the roast over. The rub was very good and the roast turned out tender and moist. The sauce was great as well!

this was soo delicious. i omitted the onions and just added ground onion the the spice rub and well as mustard seed instead of prepared mustard. i had a 71/2 pounder, so i cooked it for an hour upside down( covered) at 350F then flipped it over, scored it and put it back in the oven at 350F (uncovered)  again this time for five hours occasionally basting the roast in with the drippings in the pan. when the juices start getting too low, just add more water. i cook pork about 40 minutes for every pound. it was so tender it just fell apart if you pulled on it, no knives needed here!

Very tasty!  I come from a Czech family and can remember the smell from the oven growing up on Sunday's.  I used Stella Artois for the beer and followed all directions.  This may turn into our normal Sunday dinner meal!  The gravy tastes good on the pork as well as mashed potatoes.  Yummy!!

Amazing!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  This Irish wife was finally able to cook something for her Slovak husband to remind him of his childhood - and he was RAVING!  I made it with the Fabulous Fried Cabbage and LOVED THAT as well.  This will be a new staple - especially when entertaining.

Love it--easy and tasty. I loved all the caraway seeds, buy my husband found them excessive. I may cut them down a little next time. Subbed olive oil for veg; used sirloin pork roast. Made the gravy too--excellent. Thanks for the recipe.

Thank you for such a wonderful meal. My entire familt devoured it, even my picky 5-year-old. I used the beer I had in the fridge at the time and what a wonderful flavor. I have been so sick of the same old foods I have been cooking for years, I am very glad I have stepped outside the box.

Great recipe! I'm really into trying new flavors and the caraway seed was one I haven't worked with much yet. Very yummy indeed!! My only gripe would be with the salt involved in the rub. It was way too salty!! I'd reduce it from 1Tblsp to as little as 1 Tsp.

This came out better than I expected.  The only change I'd suggest is to scrape the paste off of the roast before slicing.  The taste of the paste is a bit overpowering if there is a lot of it remaining on the outside slices.

Very tasty and juicy!  Fell right apart.  I made it with Knedliky - Czech Dumpling with Sauerkraut (Zeli) (that was fabulous, too!).  Thanks for sharing and will make again!

This pork roast recipe is really really good. I don't change a thing but may add more beer if it cooks off. The pork is fork tender and the gravy is so good. I've used this recipe 4 or 5 times a year for the last 5 years so thought I'd finally add a comment.

I made this for my husband who is Czech and he absolutely loved it!  He said it was just like tradicní (traditional) Czech roast pork.  I'm jewish so I don't eat pork so I can't say what it tasted like.  But my fella raved about it for ages and has asked me to make it again so that is a very good sign!

Great recipe!  I did omit the beer, because I didn't have any in the house.  Substituted a like amount of white wine, which seeemd to work just fine.  Thanks!

This was a great recipe. I cooked it for 40 minutes in a pressure cooker, though, using the same amount of beer. The meat came out really soft. My husband is from Slovakia and he just loved this dish with Knedla and zeli. This will be our regular from now on.

I was really looking forward to making this roast after reading the great reviews.  Sadly, this did not go over well at my dinner table.  I think it was just too different for my meat and potatoes family.

As I noticed with previous reviews, this seems to be appreciated by those who grew up with this kind of food...was a bit too ethnic for me. After smelling it cooking all day, I wasn't ready to eat it.

The roast was very tasty! I didn’t have caraway so used fennel. Because some reviewers found the taste of the spice too strong and it was first time making it, I used half the amount of fennel.  I added onions and in the last hour of cooking also added carrots. The carrots were outstanding.  I learned I have to pay better attention during the cooking time. A lot of fat was rendered off the roast and I didn’t realize I’d let the liquid cook off.  The resulting sauce was not as good as what other reviewers experienced. I tweaked it by adding apple sauce. I will definitely make this again.   I served with red cabbage and apple from this site and spatzle also from this site. Uli’s red cabbage dish was great! My spatzle unfortunately was a disaster

I've made this for years, using a center-cut pork loin roast, bone-in ( for best flavor).  My parents, full-blooded Bohemians who even spoke their "secret" language!  I grew up on this food, along with knedliky...i.e. bread dumplings (my favorite) & zeli ( sauerkraut) Bohemian style).  The dumplings were easy:  2-3 cups flour, 2  cups milk, 2 eggs, 1 tsp. salt...mixed well (becomes very sticky). Shape with well-floured hands into a football-shaped dumpling, insert browned bread cubes so they are all inside (prevent getting soggy). boil in big pot (covered) 15 minutes, scrape from bottem of pot at the start so they float,  (NO PEEKING!). then uncover, turn dumpings, boil another 5 minutes. Remove w/slotted spoon, slice to allow steam to escape. Do not stack as this will cause them to get soggy.  Can also be cubed & browned in butter to add to scrambled eggs for breakfast. Zeli: simmer canned sauerkraut in water for 30 minutes, drain well; add mixture of vinegar &brown sugar (to taste) & chopped onions browned in butter.  A true Bohemian meal!!

OMG this is so good! This is my 2nd time making it. The first time I followed the recipe for the pork, but didn't make the sauce as written as we were trying to cut down on fats. That time I did find it a bit bitter tasting. This time was Amazing! I made two alterations 1) used ginger ale instead if beer (this eliminated the bitter taste) and 2) I realized I had only 1 TBLspoon of  Carroway, so I substituted fennel seed for the remaining TBLspoon. I made the sauce as written and gave the roast the full 30 min resting time (waiting is hard for me).  It was AMAZING! The pork was juicy and flavourful and the sauce was divine. Thank you for sharing this recipe! It will be my go to from now on.

This immediately became a family favorite. The first time I made it I did not have caraway seeds, I substituted cumin and it was fantastic. The second time I made it properly with the caraway seeds, it was really good. However everyone preferred it with the cumin so I now make it with cumin all the time. I’ve used numerous types of beer, the winner is Guinness Draught Stout.

I have made this 3 times, and each time I get rave reviews.  I agree, it's very different.  I use Alaskan Amber for the beer which is a slightly sweet beer.  I drain the drippings so there are no seeds or onion, and use a little cornstarch with chicken broth  to thicken.  Due to the cut of pork I used, I had to cook the meat longer so it was tender.  I have also done this in a crock pot! I love this recipe, it has such a wonderful flavor.

No, beer; used a little vinegar to deglaze the pan after browning the pork and onions. Added white wine at the end along with the cornstarch/water slurry and cooked down. Absolutely delicious.

Subbed cumin for caraway seed (none on hand) and my roast cooked faster. I took it out @ 155*F and let it rest while I made the gravy. I would cut back on the salt a bit though. Served with German Spaetzle and beer.  Hubby forgot to bring sauerkraut home. Delicious meal.

I omitted the caraway and didn't make the sauce at the end. I found it had reached 145F an hour before the prescribed time. I think the recipe was fine but my roast was the wrong cut perhaps.

I am first generation Slovak. My mom was an excellent cook. But I will have to say this was the best recipe for roasted pork I had a 4.3 lb roast. I followed the recipe for the paste. It was very good but I think I would use a mixture of garlic powder with fresh minced. Maybe even put sliced garlic in the flesh.  I roasted fat side down for the hour. Then flipped, scored uncovered for another. At which time I tempt. It was at 160. Rested for 20. And it was juicey and tender. I combined a jared pork gravy with some of the drippings. I've used Chateau bread dumplings as they are easy and very good. I'm so going to use and maybe tween again.

Out of laziness, I've decided to make this in the crock pot. Would not do it again that way!  Nothing to do with the flavor and texture I loved when I enjoyed this dish in Prague.
The  flavors (particularly caraway) concentrated too much and the end result was too salty. But I am pretty sure the recipe is not to blame. I will definitely try again, in the oven, as it was supposed to be made in the first place.

I prepared this today for a special dinner and followed the recipe to a "T".  It was delicious, my guests, husband and I loved it and I wouldn't change a thing!   When I read many of the reviews and saw that they went back 8+ years, I knew it had to be good and it was !   I plan to make this for Easter dinner this year instead of HAM AGAIN.

I loved the recipe but tweaked it I don't care for caraway seed and didn't have any garlic so I used 2T rosemary and 1T minced ginger. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I put in carrots and potatoes when the roast was about done. It was great will definitely make again.

This was my first pork roast since my husband is the pork roast King...but after using this recipe, there's a new pork roast sheriff in town. I cooked it in the slow cooker for about 11 hours on low overnight. I only had 1 onion, so I threw in some carrots and bell peppers. Used a little beef stock instead of beer. I turned it over to score the fat and finished it off in the oven for about an hour. It was amazing and the gravy from the drippings was fantastic! Smothered some cabbage Southern style as a side. This recipe will definitely go on the menu rotation!

Amazing!  My whole family had 2nds.  Simple ingredients, but packs a powerful punch of flavor!  I roasted baby potatoes with carrots and Turnips and made my Polish Grandmothers dumplings to serve with this.  Definitely am going to add this to our goto recipe collection!

Allow more cooking time next time.  Watch for boil-over of juices into oven.  Excellent flavor.  Perhaps increase mustard a bit in rub.  Gravy got rave reviews also.  Definitely a keeper.

This was SOOOO good! I left out the caraway seeds because I don't like them, and I only had a 3lb roast, but I followed the directions otherwise. It was tender, delicious and very flavorful. This is going into my permanent collection.

I was skeptical of using caraway seeds, but oh so glad I did. The only change I made was I used just water instead of beer, and just sprinkled dehydrated onions over it, as I was out of onions. It was delicious.

This was delicious and the gravy was great!I didn't add the caraway seeds because I cannot eat them.  I would definitely make this again.  One thing I will say, is that there was not a lot of gravy, so I am thinking about doubling the beer to make more gravy.

I've been making this roast for a few years now and could have sworn I'd reviewed it long ago.  Best pork ever!  I make it for people every chance I get!!!  Makes for a nice dinner even though it seems to most to be a cheap cut of meat.  Love it.  Don't change a thing.  Perfect as is!

Ok.  One thing to change, if so inclined.  I have better luck with the gravy when I do half a cup of milk instead of butter.  Whisk in cornstarch.  Add slowly to the drippings.  When I do butter and cornstarch separately, it's been hit or miss whether I end up with lumpy gravy.  I do the same technique every time and sometimes it just doesn't work out for me.  Can't fail with the milk/cornstarch mixture so I just go with that these days.

The only change I made to this recipe was a little less salt in the paste, based on the feedback from other cooks. Used 2t instead of 1T. The roast was a big hit and everyone cleaned their plates. Even the pathetic begging dogs got a taste. I will make this again, for certain.

The mustard, garlic and caraway made a great wet rub that gave the meat a wonderful flavor. The gravy from the pan drippings was wonderful. I served the roast with english peas and baked sweet potatoes.

This recipe is wonderful.  I made it yesterday because my son and grandson were coming for dinner and they like roast pork. Bottom line?  There was about enough left for 2 skimpy pork sandwiches.

Wonderful flavor and dark gravy that was a delight on garlic mashed potatoes.  We also had baked squash and cottage cheese/pineapple salad.

I tried to follow the directions as closely as possible but had to substitute cardamom for caraway.  A site I read said that cardamom was stronger than caraway so use half the amount, which I did.  I love the flavor of cardamom so next time I'll use the full measurement.  I always have cardamom on hand because I make jul brod for Christmas.  They also suggested dill seed as a sub.

Time got away from me so I had to roast it at 375F. and an hour shorter time.  I ended up putting all the beer plus a little water in the  pan to keep it from drying out (thus, the dark brown gravy)and it was all just wonderful.  Thanks to whoever submitted this recipe because it's a keeper!

Love love love...used anise seed instead of caraway seed as they are both from the parsley family with  strong licorice flavor,  Shocktop beer ( belgian white wheat with citrus undertones), fresh garlic and a Boston butt cut.  Cooked overnight in the crockpot and the meat just fell apart. The smell was absolutely incredible. This is on my special occasion list now.

Having heritage in Eastern Europe (Poland) I found this recipe and just had to try it.  Made it for a family dinner and my sisters and my husband (who is English/Irish) loved it.  This is the 3rd time I have made it and decided I really should give a rating to give credit to the contributor.  I made it following the recipe but since a number of family has problems with salt intake, I cut the salt to 1 tsp and the pepper to 1 tsp.  It was great and I have received so many complements that I must give credit to the cook!  Thank you for posting.

This is a terrific recipe. The only thing that I did differently was to double up on the beer required. Friends raved about this - it will definitely become one of my regular meals.

Fabulous!  I was afraid that the caraway would be too much; however, the mustard, onions and beer melded wonderfully with the flavour of the caraway and the meat.  Served for family dinner and all loved it!  Meat was very tender, sauce was delicious!  Will definitely make again.  The recipe needs NO changes or additions at all.  Hard to improve on perfection.

The first time I made this, I was really goofed.  I used the ingredients for a five pound roast on a roast half the size...and I added a whole bottle of beer.  I wasn't certain about the mustard so I used powdered.  It was great.  It was the best pork roast I have ever eaten.  I am Croatian.  I have eaten my share of pork roasts!  It was the foundation to build on.  Thank you for that.  I am making the roast now only I am using the proper amounts.  It can only be delicious.
