Great recipe.  I wish I read reviews first because I think it would of been better if I added in lemon rind.  I wanted more of a lemon taste but it was still delicious.  I did use two regular eggs and baked mine with a tray of hot hot water on the shelf below it in the oven. Mine baked in 45 min. No cracks and it looked beautiful topped with dollops of cool whip and fresh lemon slices.  Will make again.

I have made this cheesecake four times since finding the recipe last month, and am constantly getting asked for the recipe - a guy at work paid me $10 to make him one!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and a pinch of salt, plus the zest from the lemon.  I use 1 package fat-free cream cheese, and 1 low-fat, then garnish the top with cool-whip dollops and fresh lemon slices.

Unbelievable!  This cheesecake is SO good.  It reminds me of the lemon cheesecake I used to always get at The Cheesecake Factory until the discontinued it.  I made only minor changes to the recipe: I added the zest of one lemon,  used crushed Nilla Wafers for the crust instead of graham crackers because I prefer the flavor, and I used two eggs instead of the egg substitute.  I baked it using the water bath technique described in one of the allrecipes.com articles.  This is phenomenal cheesecake.  I can't wait to make it again.  You really can't go wrong with this. Thank you!

This recipe turned out great, with my own modifications. I made the graham cracker crust from scratch and I added 1 tsp. lemon zest to it. I also substituted the egg substitute for 2 eggs. It kind of takes away from being low fat, but it tastes better. The cheesecake turned out excellent on its own, but it did need something. So I made a lemon-blackberry sauce. Here is the recipe: 2 C. blackberries, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 C sugar, 1/4 C water, 1 tbsp. lemon juice. Combine all ingredients, while the sauce is cooking smash the balckberries with a masher. Bring the sauce to a boil and simmer on low 10 minutes. Strain the berry sauce over a bowl. The sauce in the bowl will be seedless and very yummy over the cheesecake. I made 4 of them over the Easter holiday and they were a big hit.

Very tasty and easy.  I made it for Easter.  I used 2 eggs instead of egg sub., and custard style lemon yogurt.  It turned out great.

Absolutly wonderful! I made a few revisions as did others, I couldn't find lemon yogurt so I used plain yogurt and added extra lemon zest, I also used two whole eggs. I used a homemade graham crust in a springform pan which I sprayed with PAM before adding the batter to prevent it from sticking to the sides and cracking in the middle along with the use of a water bath. I was surprised my cake baked perfectly in only 30 minutes! Will defenitly make this time and time again. I finished it with a thin layer of Cool Whip and lemon zest curls.

Wonderful!  I used 2 eggs in lieu of egg substitute.  Also baked it in ramekins (crustless) in a water bath following the "all recipes" hints for cheesecakes (water bath, jiggle test, texture photo etc). Prior to serving, topped it with Blackberry preserves and fresh blackberries and served for brunch dessert.  Will make again. Super easy and tasty.

If you are really into cheescake, and not the Jello kind, then this one won't do it for you.  It's not very rich and you can easily tell that it's trying to be low fat.  I also added extra lemon zest to give it more flavor, and it was still kind of flavorless.  It's okay if you're not expecting much, but I don't do ho-hum desserts.

Excellent with modifications. I made a crust out of graham crackers and butter, adding in about a tsp of lemon zest. I used low fat Yoplait lemon yogurt -- it's only 6 oz. so I added about 2 oz. of lemon curd. Also, added about a TBS of lemon zest to the pie itself to make it really lemony. I used regular cream cheese which made it very creamy and two regular eggs. Needs the sour cream topping as suggested by another reviewr.    Really good and lemony.  A water bath is recommended below the pie to avoid cracking. I've had requests to make this again and will update!

My family loved this recipe.  It's really easy and, if you want to change the flavor, you can use different flavored fat free yogurts.  I've tried strawberry and vanilla, and they were both great.

Excellent, creamy cheesecake.  The lemon flavor is perfect!  Just to enhance the lemon flavor and add some color, I topped this with a lemon curd drizzle.  This is a nice fresh summertime dessert.

I didn't necessarily want a low-fat lemon cheesecake, but rather a recipee to work with.  Based on reviews I came up with this:
CRUST: 8 graham crackers, 1 tblspn melted butter, 2-3 tblspn white sugar (taste for desired sweetness).  Lightly spray spring pan w/butter flavored Pam, add crust mixture and toast in oven just until light brown, 3-5 min.  (NOTE: Don't use any other flavor pam as it will absorb into the crumbs and give it an odd flavor).  
FILLING:  I used regular cream cheese, 2 eggs instead of substitue, 1 tspn vanilla, dbl REAL lemon juice, 2-3 tablspn lemon zest, 1 greek oiks lemon meringue container.  I think greek yogurt compliments the cream cheese texture better.  Have cream cheese at room temp or throw in microwave 40 seconds. 
1. cream the cream cheese and sugar. 
2. Blend in yogurt, lemon juice/zest and 1 tspn vanilla extract 
3. Blend eggs, one at a time, just until incorporated. 
4. Blend in flour.
5. Pour into pie crust and tap pan on counter to losen any air bubbles.
BAKING: Bake with water bath method (wrap bottom of spring pan with foil - I double it.  Place in center of pan with about 1/2 inch to inch of water).  I think this way is best, as when I put the pan of water a rack under the pie it seems to crack. I use a knife for doneness as a topping goes on this anyway.  
FINISHING: Sour Cream topping:  1/2 cup sour cream, 1-2 tspn sugar, real lemon juice, lemon zest.  Taste as you go for desired sweetness/touch of lemon flavor.

Great recipe and nice and easy! Used 2 eggs rather than the substitute and also the zest of one lemon. Added a bit of vanilla extract as suggested by another review and it was excellent! Made it twice in one week and received awesome reviews!

It was so awesome and really easy. The only thing I did different was using regular eggs. I whipped two of them and mixed them with the rest of the ingredients.

this was a great cheesecake. I used Splenda instead of the sugar, and you couldn't even tell the difference, but definately healthier for you.

With all the modifications everyone suggested, this dessert turned out great and was the talk of our family barbeque on the 4th of July.  It was delicious and I will make this over and over again.

This was amazing!!! I couldn't find lemon yogurt, so I used plain and added an extra 3 tbsp of lemon juice and the zest from one lemon. I topped it with the blackberry lemon glaze, to which I added 3 tbsp of lemon juice (we like things very lemony) This was the perfect summer cheesecake. I will definitely be making it again. With the yogurt it's not as heavy, so you don't feel as bad eating it. LOL

I used this recipe to make mini-cheesecakes and they came out really well, with a few changes, as other reviewers have said.  I added the zest of one lemon, used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute, and cooked it with a pan of hot water underneath.  For mini-cheesecakes, reduce baking time to 25-30 minutes.  Made 12 minis using Keebler's pre-made mini graham cracker crusts.

This was really easy to make. This cheesecake did not disappoint me in my love for lemon. I added the zest of one medium lemon (1tsp to the crust mix and 2tsp into the cheesecake mix). And for the crust, I used crushed Biscoff cookies instead of graham crackers. Amazingly delicious. I brought this to Easter dinner and everyone loved it, and they were shocked when I told them it's made with low-fat cream cheese and nonfat yogurt. It's 5 stars, with these modifications.

I make this yummy cheesecake regularly and I always add the zest of 2 lemons along with 3 TBS of lemon juice. I only use 6 oz of lemon yogurt, since I have only found it sold in that amount. It seems to need less than 50 minutes in my oven. My family enjoys the cake without any topping. It has nice, light, texture which we prefer over a more dense, rich cheesecake. It's not overly sweet, either. It is one of our favorite desserts!

Wow!  This cheesecake is awesome!!  My neighbor just gave me a bag of fresh lemons from his tree so this recipe was perfect timing!  I made the graham cracker crust from this website (Graham Cracker Crust I).  I didn't have any lemon yogurt so I used vanilla yogurt instead plus the 2 1/2 tbs of lemon juice (like the recipe states) and a zest of one lemon like some reviewers suggested, I skipped the flour completely and I used 2 eggs in place of egg substitute. I also made strawberry sauce for it.  And WOW it was just perfect!!

I made this recipe and definitely will again.  I found the lemon flavor a little too light for my tastes so I added a thin layer of lemon pie filling on the top.  It also made it look a little prettier.

WOW!  Not only was this a snap to put together it tastes so sinful!  It is so rich and flavorful.  I used 2 eggs and only 6 oz of yogurt (Kroger brand is 6 oz) and it was fabulous!  I am going to try different flavor yogurts next time.  Defininatly a repeater!

I halved the recipe because I only had 1 package of cream cheese. I used a premade shortbread crust as my son does not like graham cracker crusts. I used 1 large egg for the egg substitute, kept the flour amount the same, added some vanilla and lemon zest. The cheesecake baked in 30 minutes, I served with blueberry sauce, really fresh and tasty, I could have eaten the whole thing by myself :)

Very good recipe! 
The original recipe used the white sugar, egg sub. and the nonfat lemon yogurt. 
But my cheesecake still came out very nice while I used brown sugar, 2 eggs, and the plain yogurt for substitution!

AMAZING is the word for this cheesecake! Every time I make it I get raves about it. This is going into the "family favorites cookbook". Oh, and I use 2 eggs instead of egg substitute.

This makes an excellent cheesecake. I didn't follow the recipe exactly...I used 2 eggs rather than egg substitute, since I prefer using real eggs. Also, I added some lemon rind. Except for those two changes, I followed the recipe exactly and the result was a gorgeous cheesecake. The texture was nice and creamy without feeling heavy. It was nicely semi sweet, leaving flavour room for a topping of one's choice. We used a strawberry topping but most fruit could be used with this cheesecake recipe since lemon goes with almost anything.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for this recipe.

First - let me say this was my first attempt at cheesecake.  The recipe was simple to follow and I had no trouble with the cooking method.  The cake was good; however....it was a little to rich for a cheesecake for me.  It was also not a caky substance...it was more similar to a no bake cheesecake you can buy at the store.  All in all - I will keep searching for a recipe I like -

This cheesecake was a bit lighter than I was expecting and the consistency didn't come out quite right because I beat the egg whites separately before folding into the remaining batter. Wouldn't recommend doing that; will try again as the recipe says. Served with a blackberry topping per another cook's recommendation, which was a great idea and finished the cake nicely!

Light, airy texture, but really just a run-of-the-mill cheesecake.  I added extra lemon oil b/c I didn't have lemon zest, and also used 2 eggs instead of egg substitute.  It was good, but I'll probably stick with my tried and true recipe, and just add lemon to that one.

I read the reviews before I started so switched to vanilla wafer crust and added zest to the filling.  I used the moist oven tip but still got a slight crack.  Done in 45 minutes

Thanks for sharing this nice and refreshing recipe with us. I made it multiple times by now and started getting creative as well by substituting the egg substitute with woodruff flavored gelatine powder and mixed raspberries into the cream cheese. The lemon juice adds a nice tart flavor to it. 
Today I had no berries and just sprinkled it with shredded dark chocolate. No matter what- this is a wonderful recipe. Thank you again for sharing

Very easy, and very delicious! Like other reviewers, I used 2 whole eggs rather than egg substitute and added some lemon zest to enhance the lemony goodness. I also topped with sour cream sweetened with a little sugar and added vanilla. It was a huge hit!

Yum! This cheesecake is very refreshing! I will be making this again soon. 

I did make a few changes.. here goes:
I used plain Greek yogurt (nonfat), instead of lemon yogurt
I added the zest of 1 lemon
I added an  extra drop (or two)  lemon juice ; ) 
I used 2 eggs, instead of egg substitute

I baked the cheesecake at 300 for 45 min, turned the oven off, and kept the oven closed for another 60min.  

After it was baked, I topped the cheesecake with a strawberry & brandied apricot jam. The flavors paired very well together!
(I also made the crust myself using some thin cookies I had in my pantry) 



My cheesecake had no cracks . Plus, both flavor and texture were perfect.

This recipe with is better with a few changes. I wanted to cook it in my Instant Pot, so I exchanged the pie crust with 3/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs to which I added 2Tbs melted butter and 1Tbs sugar. Mix that and put it in the bottom of a greased 6" springform pan. The ingredients to change are to replace the egg substitute with 2 large eggs plus one yolk, and substitute  the lemon yogurt with 1/4 cup heavy cream.  Also, 1/2 tsp of lemon zest adds significantly to the taste. The eggs and cream cheese should be room temperature. Mix all ingredients in a food processor. The eggs should be added last, one at a time, and beat in a very short time. Pour the filling over the graham crackers, cover the pan with a paper towel and secure with foil, or cover it with a silicon pot cover. Set pressure for 40 minutes with NPR.  Viola!

Ran out of lemon juice and actually added some Crystal Light Lemonade powder to the batter.  Came out great.  Lol.  It did crack in the oven. Will probably use a water bath next time and lower the temp a little.

This didn't turn out so well for me because I couldn't find any nonfat lemon yogurt so I substituted Greek lemon yogurt and it had a different taste and texture which of course affected the cheesecake. I think next time I might just use vanilla yogurt since there is lemon juice and it would still have that lemon flavor.

It was ok just not enough lemon flavor for me. I did add lemon rind also and still it just wasn't that strong bold lemon flavor I was looking for. So the next time I made it I added a lemon pie filling on top and a meringue on top of that to make it a lemon meringue cheesecake. It was absolutely  delicious. Everyone compared it to the cheesecake  factory's.

I didn't actually eat this, I don't like lemon, but I made it for someone who does and they absolutely loved it.  I made as written except I added lemon rind.  I was really happy the way this turned out.  I wanted to do the water bath thing that I read about from other reviews, but I didn't, and it didn't seem to matter, it cooked just fine.

I made this as a gluten & diabetic friendly dessert for a party. It was good, but the flavor was really subtle (I tried orange/ginger flavored yogurt, next I'll try grapefruit for more zing). My family has asked me to bring it to the next party, so I'd say it was a hit. 
 
I revised the recipe a little bit: 
3 (6 oz) containers of siggi’s icelandic yogurt 
3 (2 oz) packages of light cream cheese 
couple packs of truvia

minus 1 star for the puzzling omission of lemon zest & including lemon yogurt & eggbeaters in the ingredients.
i used plain greek yogurt & 2 real eggs ; zested 2 lemons (add some pith also to heighten the lemon taste) & fresh lemon juice .
made some raspberry compote & voila, my bf's favorite kind of dessert was born!
easy & very tasty & inexpensive

A nice, easy cheesecake recipe - I especially like the light texture.  I didn't have lemon yoghurt, so added more lemon juice & about a tsp zest, plus two eggs, rather than egg replacement.  It was really tangy & lemony!  I would double the quantity for a homemade crust in a 9" pan for a higher cheesecake.  Thanks for posting :)

I took another suggestion and put a layer of lemon pie filling on the top. It was really good. Great recipe and so easy to make!
