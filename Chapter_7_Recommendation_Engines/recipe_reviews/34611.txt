I really liked the fresh flavor of the cabbage, apple and vinagrette.  However, after adding the blue cheese, it was inedible.  I love blue cheese, but these flavors were not compatible.  I wasted an big bowl of salad by including the cheese.  I won't make this as written again.  Maybe shredded cheddar cheese would be good, but I recommend leaving it out completely.

I love blue cheese - I love cabbage - I love apple, I love radishes.....The oil and vinegar ratio is way off - and with no sugar - well - let's just say that we won't make this again. Love the name of the recipe though.

I made this salad over the 4th of july weekend and after reading the other reviews I also left out the blue cheese.  Instead I added walnuts and used apple cidar vinegar, mixed in a few tablespoons of honey and whisked in the olive oil.  My guests loved how refreshing and tasty it was.

I tried the salad without the cheese as previous rater suggested.  Way too much bite from the vinegar!  Feta helped balance the bite.  I added honey to the rest of the salad (without cheese)and liked it best that way.  I really like the cabbage/radish/apple combo and will work on a variation of the vinegarette dressing.  Nice change from coleslaw.
