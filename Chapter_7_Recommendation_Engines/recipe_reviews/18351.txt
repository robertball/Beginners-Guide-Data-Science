This was wonderfully quick and easy to make - the only changes I made were that I shredded the zucchini, used canned petite diced tomatoes and added a tablespoon of fresh grated parmesan along with the basil. Will definitely make again!

This was a great recipe especially because it's so open ended to put what you want in it.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but I did add about twice the garlic, about a cup of mushrooms, a half cup of onion, a bit of crushed redpepper and two small chicken breasts very finely chopped.  It turned out amazing and very filling.  I could see the original recipe being a bit light for a main course but if you add the veggies you want it's very filling and even more healthy!

This was wonderful!  It is now my most favorite pasta dish.  I changed a couple of things:
I used 4 Roma tomato's.  I also used Bow Tie pasta as the veggie's blend much better with Bow Tie's than with small Angel Hair.  But I LOVED it so much I made it twice in two days!!!!  EXCELLENT!

Excellent and easy dish -- I recommended this dish to alot of friends that are on fat-reduced diets. Very tasty, excellent with whole-wheat spaghetti noodles as well. I replaced the mozzarella cheese with parmesan, and fresh basil with dried, and it was still great!

My husband was skeptical on this one as he likes sauce on pasta but he actually had seconds and remarked that it was pretty good.  I only used 1 zucchinni as he is not fond of it and instead of mozzarella I used shredded romano cheese.  Excellent recipe....don't be stingy on the garlic, it seasons the vegetables nicely.

Extremely simple and flexible. I've made this a number of times with whatever veggies I have on hand. The last time I made it was the first time I actually had fresh basil on hand (I'd been using dried before)--it made a huge difference and I don't think I'll be going back to dried.

This dish was excellent.  I used fresh zucchini from our garden, and also used seasoned salt as suggested by another reviewer.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes w/seasonings.  It was so good.  Even my three kids ate this right up.  Will try with the fresh tomatoes next time and throw in some other fresh veggies too!  Great dinner!

Super easy and versatile.  I upped the garlic, added onion, a splash of balsamic vinegar and Shiraz.  Used parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella for more of a kick.

Some recipes surprise you by bringing flavors out of the individual components that you didnt expect.  I guess thats what I was hoping for when I made this, but to no avail.  This recipe produces exactly what you think it will.  A bland pasta with zucchini and tomatoes with a bit of cheese on top.  The components dont mismatch or take away from each other, but they do not bring anything exiting out of eachother either.  A bit of salt, a pinch of sugar for the tomatoes, and a dash of balsamic on top of it all made this somewhat serviceable as a mid week meal for myself and the wife, but Ill never make it again.

I like this recipe and my husband (who usually lives only on meat) really liked it too. The only change I made was using feta cheese instead of mozzarella. Everything else was perfect the way the recipe had it.

Quick, easy, delicious and healthy.  I doubled the garlic (and glad I did) and used a parm/romano/asiago blend because that's what I had on hand.  Next time I think I'll add some pine nuts.  Great recipe for using all that zucchini and tomato from the garden.  Make sure you use fresh basil because it makes the difference.

Love this dish!  I live alone, but I still love great food.  This is delicious, easy, healthy, and inexpensive.  Angel's Pasta and a nice glass of wine is something I deserve at the end of the day.  Definitely will repeat....often!

As written, I rate it a 4.  With my tweaks, it's a 5.  I think it needs more garlic and pasta or less zucchini and tomatoes to make it a pasta entree and not a vegetable entree with a little pasta in it.  I also added a small cubed chicken breast which made it a whole meal in itself for us.

A very good recipe to get started.

This was okay. I thought it was too bland. My kids wouldn't eat it and their father said "it's alright." It just needed more flavor. Based on some other reviews, I used extra garlic and added onions to it as well. Since it's January, I used the recommended fire roasted tomatoes, which were good, but it still needed something. I did like the fresh basil, though. Unfortunately, I'm removing this one from the recipe box.

Zucchinis are popping up everywhere in my garden, and this recipe is perfect to use some of them up.  Very quick, easy and delicious.  Will be making this regularly.  Thanks for posting.

Yum!  I added some mushrooms I had on hand.  Used a little (appx 1/4 c) of the pasta water to make the topping a little more saucy.

This was REALLY good.  I made it as a side dish.  TH eonly changes were I used grape tomatoes (about a half a container) and then a can of diced tomatoes with juices.  I also added a sprinkle of dried basil in addition to the fresh.  At the end I sprinkled a few tablespoons of fresh romano that I had on hand.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Superb!!

Quick, easy, and delicious!  Made this for my Italian boyfriend and we both loved it.  I used fresh-grated parmesan instead of mozzarella, because it's what we had; I think I'll keep doing it that way.

Nice, light, fresh. If you don't like vegetarian food, you'll probably find it bland - but very nice if you're in the mood for something simple and fresh.

It was a little bland.  I did a few steps different for better flavor.  I added mushrooms.  I kept the tomatoes as slices and added a little (about 1/2 cup) of pureed tomatoes to the mixture.

My husband and I both liked this and it was a good way to use up some veggies from our garden.  I thought there were too many noodles and not enough veggies, however.  In the future, I will add more zucchini and tomatoes.

I added red pepper flakes for an added zing. Cutting the zucchini circles in half was better for bite-sized eating. I added 5 tomatoes instead of 3...I like tomatoes...but they didn't overpower. No fresh basil so I added dried to zucchini mixure on the stove. Husband liked it so I will definitely do again!

Oh so bland! Sorry but this was virtually tasteless! Made exactly as directed tonight and the best thing was the zucchini so we ate that all up.  Will not be repeating.

The zucchini, tomatoes and garlic sauteed together is really tasty.  This is an easy recipe worth trying.

Although I added extra garlic, an extra tomato, and sprinkled parmesan cheese and salt on top, it still needs more flavor.  I'll keep this recipe but next time, add even more garlic, tomatoes, and other vegetables.

I really enjoyed how this one came out; a great basic recipe you can play with. I used 3 zucc's, 3 onions, 5 cloves of garlic, one of each red, green, and yellow peppers, and just a little white wine to create a touch more sauce. It came out very light, flavorful, and I saved some of the veggie topping to add over more pasta later. Yum yum!

Yum! This is sooo easy & quick. A recipe gets extra from me for being easy, quick AND tasty. It's a very simple, but very good pasta dish. I used fresh angel hair (as opposed to the dried kind), fresh grape tomatoes, and only one zucchini (for me, that was enough). I skipped the mozzarella in favor of shaved parm. Will make again, thanks!

I loved this recipe. I followed it exact but added 1 zucchini instead of 2, it was definitely enough. This dish was a little plain for my husbands taste, he dumped marinara all over it and loved it :)

This recipe was okay as written. It is definitely a good base recipe. I tasted it after the only change I made was to add onions and for my taste it was falling short of what it really could be. We don't eat cheese so, I added some red pepper flakes and topped it with a squeeze of lemon, capers and crumbled garlic toast on top. That took it from okay to oh my!

This was a good side dish. (I served it with basil chicken breast.) I will make it again but next time I will add onions and maybe some snow peas... just to give it a bit more. It would be good by itself as a light lunch too. 
Update: had to change this to four stars... as leftovers the second day, this tastes much better.

Very good, very easy.
I used bowtie pasta, easier to eat with the veggies.  I chunked up the zucchini, added onions, and a little red pepper, and a little balsamic.  Overall, very simple, very quick, yummy.

Absolutely delicious!!  My whole family loved this recipe.  We used veggies in season to change it and the flavors with the garlic are terrific.  Will be making often as a side dish.

We made this dish last night, and it was great! We used whole wheat pasta, and I left off the mozzarella, and it was perfect. I probably put the tomatoes and basil in a little early. I'll definitely be making this again.

I wasn't sure about this at first but from the first bite I was in Heaven. I used regular spagetti noodles. I added onion and red bell peppers and I also used dried basil, because it was all I had. This is a great recipe. I will put some twists on it the next time I make it. Thanks Denyse.

This was just OK.  As others stated, it was a little too bland. I used eggplant instead of zucchini because that is what I had on hand.  Not sure how to make this better without completely changing the recipe.

This a a great jump off recipe....to get the best results from all your efforts, use fresh EVERYTHING! basil, garlic, roma tomatoes and freshly grated cheeses.... go to the Cheese shop in your store...use somedry the rest (simply place on a clean plate for a few hours to a day....pack into sterile jars....) or use a dehydrator...a great investment....the whole concept of most vegetarian fare is the freshest most wholesome ingredients will yield the freshest, most nutritious meal.Buy ORGANIC whenever possible and make a double recipe, freeze and enjoy!

We couldn't get over how good this was for being so easy!  I followed others' suggestions and used canned tomatoes (drained) and then half a jar of marinara sauce I had in the fridge.  Even my non-vegetarian husband liked this for a main dish!

I followed the recipe, except used one 14.5 oz can of drained, diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes.  It was great! I'd say it feeds 4 rather than 6. We tried one serving with parmesan cheese, but it didn't taste as "fresh" as with the mozzarella.

This is one of my favorite quick and easy TNT recipes.  I started making it one day when there was "nothing good to eat" and everyone loved it.  I also add in sauteed onions and change out parmesean cheese for the mozzarella.  Yummo!

Loved it!!  I used canned tomatoes and dried basil because that is what I had available.  I also used shredded parmesan.  I wasn't sure if it would have enough flavor, but it had plenty. Hubby usually doesn't like meals like this, but he liked it too.  It's a very economical and healthy meal.

Good, easy, fast...healthy recipe!!  I used all organic along with doubling the garlic and adding 1/2 good olive oil.   It could have used more basil but I love basil and garlic.  It wil be nice to mix up and add additional veges.  This is a keeper!!!!

We made this in Foods class, and it was delicious!  I went home and made it again, my family loved it!  Great recipe, especially with home-grown zucchini!

I found this recipe to be quick and tasty. I'd never been a big fan of zucchini, but I like the way it tastes mixed with the garlic and tomatoes.

This was very nice. I'll give it 5 stars for ease of preparation, healthfulness, and attractiveness. I like veggies, but don't have fresh ones all that often, so this recipe was a nice improvement on plain old spaghetti. I received 3 lovely tomatoes from the garden of a friend-of-a-friend, and this recipe was just the ticket. I made it exactly as written, and the results reminded me of how nice fresh basil is to have in a dish. One minor note: sometimes dishes taste just as good the next day, or even better (e.g., chili), but I ate this whole thing over two days, and it was definitely not as good when the leftovers were reheated on the second day. But eaten right after it was cooked, it was wonderful.

I'm currently doing the slim fast diet and this was a welcome 200 calorie lunch in place of a shake.  Light but filling, good flavor.  This will become a regular for me. Thanks for sharing!

I did not care for this recipe. The zucchini was undercooked; 2 minutes is way not long enough. And 12 leaves of basil is far more than I care to eat. This pasta suffers also from a lack of any kind of seasoning. I knew before it finished cooking that it needed some serious tweaking.

In my opinion, this was bland. It needs something - maybe some chicken broth (or vegetable broth if you're trying to keep it vegetarian friendly) for a sauce? Thanks for the idea though!

I changed the recipe a bit, but the results were awesome! I added an onion, a green pepper, and about 1/4 lb of asparagus.  I used 12oz of whole wheat noodles and doubled the garlic.  I know it says 8oz of pasta will serve four... but my boyfriend, his roommate and I demolished it.

I added shrimp to make it a bit heartier as well as some chopped onion and a dash of hot pepper flakes. I omitted the cheese since I didn't think it went with the shrimp

I made this for dinner tonight, wow, it was really good. I increased the pasta and added extra veggies because I wanted leftovers. I used about 1 1/2 cup small pasta shells (what I had on hand). I included one yellow crookneck squash, a little bit of zucchini I had left over, 1/2 an onion, 3 small fresh tomatoes (all diced), some frozen asparagus spears cut into thirds, and 4 big cloves of garlic minced. I sauteed the onion first, then put in the tomatoes so they would cook down some. Then the garlic and the other veggies slowly, waiting a minute or two before adding more. Then a tsp of salt, some fresh ground pepper. I then tasted it and thought it needed just a touch more flavor so I followed another reviewer's advice and added in maybe 3 tblsp italian dressing. Just enough to really kick up the flavor but you can't tell there's italian dressing in it. After stirring in the pasta and the fresh basil, I served it topped with fresh parm/reg cheese. My husband really loved it and I can tell its going to be even better tomorrow.  I will definitely make this again, next time I will make even more in my big skillet because DH is eating it up!

This needs salt and freshly ground pepper, and make sure to use plenty of garlic.  I also like it with chopped onion and use a combination of mozzarella and parmesan.  My family prefers a combination of canned diced tomatoes and fresh so that there's a bit of juice to help keep the pasta moist.  Fresh basil is a must.  Using 1 summer squash and 1 zucchini adds color.  Good recipe!

We LOVED this (with changes)!! Even my 6 & 1 yr olds loved it! This is what I did: I heated up about 2-3 Tbs of butter and about a Tbs of Olive Oil, sauteed maybe 1/3 of an onion and a tsp and a half of jarred garlic. Then threw in one sliced zucchini for a few minutes. Salt & pepper to taste. Then threw in 2/3 of a sliced red pepper and a small bit of yellow pepper (just used what all I had on hand), cooked for a minute or two. Threw in about 1/3 of an 8 oz. package of sliced mushrooms, shredded 2/3 of another zucchini into it (per other reviews), and poured in a can of Italian Styled stewed tomatoes (undrained). I had leftover rotisserie chicken on hand, so I shredded that into it as well.  I then sprinkled a bunch of dried basil into it, maybe 1-2 Tbs or so, then threw in a pile of angel hair spaghetti. I was careful not to put too much pasta in, based on the other reviews. I served it up with shredded mozzarella cheese on top. It was yummy!!!  I'm sorry to those of you who hate reviewers who change the recipe, but I think that is what this site is for, to find recipes that fit your own taste and this meal definitely did that!!  I love the idea that I could throw in what I want and it will still taste great! I plan to make this in bulk next time so I can freeze a bunch of it for another meal.

Great way to mix up typical pasta and sauce.  I did change it up based on what i had.  I used wild rice instead of pasta because i had it left over from earlier in the week.  Otherwise, i kept things the same.  I do plan on making this again with pasta like its supposed to be made!

This is an awesome recipe, I loved it - thanks!  My sister is a vegan and I find it super-hard to cook for her, but I made this for her and left out the mozzarella and it was just as tasty (although I do use it when I make it for myself).  Thanks again, great recipe!

Very hard to get down, unfortunately.  I give it 2 stars though because I may try it again with 3 times as much garlic or something.  Definitely needs something else for some flavor.

We really liked this recipe.  I doubled the recipe, using 5 large roma tomatoes, three small zucchini, and added sliced mushrooms as others suggested.  I would have liked a few more veggies for more nutrients, but still really enjoyed.  I think adding sliced Vidalia onions to the saute would be great!

A good veggie pasta dish. I did substitute the fresh tomatoes with canned diced tomatoes. And I only had dried basil. We have had it 3 weeks straight. This one is a keeper!

I made this yesterday with my friends as a test for my boyfriend's surprise party.  It turned out amazing!  We used half a bag of spaghetti (because that was all we had in stock) and added a bunch of other stuff: 1 box mushrooms, 1 red pepper and put int a full 3 zucchinis (it really depends on size).  My friends thought it was a bit watery so they added two tsp of premade tomato sauce, though I think letting it simmer would've sufficed.  Overall really good, and the sauce was enough to cover all that pasta...yum!

I thought this was really good.  I made a couple of tweaks... I also added some red pepper flakes with the garlic, and then added mushrooms with the zucchini.  Instead of mozzarella cheese, I topped with parmesan.  This is a very colorful dish and tastes great!

Loved this very simple dish.  The only thing I changed was I put a little parmesan in it before serving.  A perfect summer meal, can't wait to make this again.

This was good.  A nice way to use up vegies in the garden.  I agree with the reviewer who said it needed more vegies.  Next time i will add more garlic and maybe some mushrooms.  Thanks!

This was good, but I did the following to make it a little more interesting: 1) added artichoke hearts into the sautee 2) used capers in the final mix 3) threw in cajun seasonings just for kicks. Otherwise it needed a bit of salt and pepper. Overall, this is a great "base" recipe that you can play around with and add things you really like. Will make this again--probably with different ingredients each time!

My family really enjoyed this dish!  I added
1 tsp seasoned salt to the zuccini as I was browning it.  The seasoned salt definitely added flavour to the vegetables/sauce, and I will add it again the next time I make this pasta.  I also added 1/3 Cup Feta Cheese, which made the pasta taste that much better!  I will be making this dish for a long time to come...Yummy!

Loved this! This is a great quick and very tasty recipe. I added "Basil Shrimp" found on this site at the last minute. It can't get much quicker for a fantastic dish.

I was hoping for more, but this definitely lacked flavor.   I would suggest adding tomato paste and white wine to add some much needed flavor.

My husband loved this!  Lots of flavor for few calories.  I added Morningstar's Vegetarian Chick'n Strips and that made it a heartier meal.  We also added chunked mozzarella instead of shredded, as our fresh mozzarella was too soft to shred well!  Excellent recipe though, I will make this again.

This is so good and even better the next day. I made this for my lunch, but tasted a little when it was done to make sure I liked it and it was good, but when I warmed it up for lunch it smelled good and the flavors really came together. I did add some red pepper flakes after it warmed up. Great will make this often.

Although tempted to add some kind of sauce we left the recipe as written and were both very happy with the final taste and texture of the dish. I did add some yellow squash to go with the zucchini because that's what I had on hand. It was very nice-light yet satisfying. Also nice with a sprinkle of parm cheese.

Not bad, not great as it is. I think it needs extra flavor-- Next time I will add a lot more garlic as suggested by others. I added mushrooms to the mix and some chopped onion as well.

Great recipe!  I used a can of tomatoes as I didn't have any fresh, and used Nature's Seasonings as my salt and pepper.  I served it over gnocchi, and put it under the broiler for a few seconds to melt the cheese.  Soooo good!

The pasta was a bit dry.  I also thought there was not enough veggies for the amount of pasta, but with a little tweaking this could be really good.  So, as written and followed a little boring and dry.  Update: So, I halved the amount of pasta and used a can of diced tomatoes.  It was obviously less dry and still tasty.

It's only 4-stars if you use dried basil (I've made it both ways).  My husband loves it even when I only use dried basil, but I find it a little bland then.  It's delicious and healthy and a regular at my house now.

This turned out great.  After reading some of the reviews below, I decided to use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh (seemed like the people who used canned were happy with their decision).  Fresh basil is key, don't use dried.  Other than that, i would describe this as a simple & healthy, but tasty dish.  I served it up with home-made bread and a salad.

So easy, and SOOOOOO yummy. We have added italian sausage, chicken, mushrooms, asparagus.... whatever we have on hand. There are so many ways to change it up, but keep it easy and good. I also use canned diced tomatoes. Thank you for this great recipe!

This was a fabulous recipe for a light, summertime pasta dish using fresh zucchini, roma tomatoes, grated parm cheese. I had added a Italian seasoned chicken breast on top.

I used the base recipe and added ingredients from the suggestions ... I used whole wheat pasta and added cut chicken breast ... loved the flavor from the mexican style canned tomotoes using more than what was noted to give more sauce ... made a great one course dinner with salad .. will make it again and again I am sure!!

Bland. Veggies were buried in the angel hair. Needs more veggies, maybe onion to boost flavor. Recommend different noodles.

This is a quick, easy, and light pasta dish.  I tried this one night because we'd all had a big lunch and just wanted something light.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh - it was easier and gave it a bit more flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly but I felt my dish came out very bland.  Also the mozz cheese bunched up so I had random gooey gobs of cheese on top of the dish instead of an even spread.  I will try this again and add some more spices, and also use grated Parmesean cheese instead.

This was GREAT !  Easy to make. I used zucchini, basil, and Roma tomatoes from my garden. I shredded the zucchini to "hide" it and the kids even gobbled it up !  I've made this twice in a week. My husband wants the leftovers for work, but so far there haven't been any !

I loved this meal and I am NOT a vegetarian! I added one small eggplant (peeled and diced) and used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes. I also halved the recommended amount of pasta so it would have a higher proportion of veggies. With these changes it made two hearty servings. Fresh basil is an absolute MUST!!!

Good basic recipe, but it doesn't knock your socks off.  It definitely needs more seasoning, more garlic and maybe some onion.  I will also smaller dice the zucchini and tomatoes next time rather than chopping them.  I added 1/2 lb. medium shrimp, peeled and deveined, after I sauteed the zucchini.  Stir-fried the shrimp for about 3 min. and then added the tomatoes.  I used tomatoes on the vine this time, but will try roma tomatoes next time.  Fewer seeds.  I also used fresh shredded parmesan rather than mozzarella.  That added good flavor.  Pretty good recipe!

This was really good.  I had a large zucchini, so I diced it, added more garlic and used canned diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and oregano.  I also added romano and parmesan to the mozzarella.  I will take others advice and use bowtie pasta next time as well.  The big chucks of veggies need big pasta!  Thanks for submitting this - flavor was yummy!

This is an easy way to make pasta.  One of my favorite recipes.  Its also cheap to make and relatively healthy.  I usually stick straight with the recipe.

I wasn't blown away by this dish, it was okay at best.  I would recommend using spiral or bow tie noodles instead of spaghetti, I would also recommend using at least twice as many vegis, and mixing them up...just tomatoes and zucchini didn't seem to go very well, and the zucchini seemed to abundant and over powering, at least for myself. I think if i ever make this again i would substitute a can of diced tomatoes without added salt, I think this will add a little more liquid to the pasta versus just chopped tomatoes.

We changed this just a little, my husband isn't a fresh tomato fan, I used roasted red pepper, YUM!!!! When it was done we sprinkled parmesan on the mozzarella, the kids like "sprinkle cheese" This is a good fast one on my son's baseball nights.

I liked this recipe, and I'll make it again.  I added asparagus and mushrooms like others suggested, and it was great.  Also, don't make this dish as a dinner.  The recipe (as it is written) is much too light, and is better as a side dish.

My boys loved this. I did throw in some cooked cubed chicken and onion.I also changed the type of cheese. This recipe is very workable to whatever you have on hand or just to suit your taste. Just added this to my shopping list again, this one is  a keeper. Thank you !

Infinitely better than topping pasta with sauce...But still, I, who usually love squash, was offput by its overpresence in this dish.  Follow the advice of a few other reviewers and double the veggies.  Also, be sure to add water as necessary so the sauce doesn't dry out.  It wasn't too bad, just not something I'd make again (and I did and do recommend experimenting with adding different vegetables).

This was a great dinner. A good base recipe that you can play around with so to get the taste you are looking for. We added a few extra spices and some extra garlic because it needed an extra kick! After each person had their plate made, I then added the cheese and popped it in the microwave for about 20 seconds to melt the cheese. We will definately have it again!

Very good! Instead of tomatoes (personally don't like them)I mixed in asparagus. The asparagus was a very yummy taste and made it a little lighter. The whole family liked this dish and it gives you a nice light fill.

This was delicious!  I tried it with a can of pre-seasoned tomatoes instead of fresh ingredients, and tasted delicious.  It was very quick and easy to make.  Heated up left overs the next day, and still was full of flavor.

We really enjoyed this.  My DH loves things that are on the blander side so he thought it was awesome.  I think next time I might add some crushed red pepper to perk it up.  I used the roasted garlic angel hair pasta and that gave it a zip I think would have been missing otherwise.

Thumbs up and very easy and quick for a summer meal.

This was really good.  I also sauteed fresh mushrooms along with the zucchini.  I didn't mix up with the pasta, next time I will.   My husband really enjoyed too.  Six year old just had ordinary tomato sauce with his.

I made this for my New Years Eve party because I had 2 vegetarians coming.  Everyone loved it.  I added artichoke hearts and a little italian dressing when I cooked the vegetables.  I also added feta cheese at the end.  I will definately make this again!

This was the first time I ever had zucchini.  I didn't really care for it.  The recipe was still good.  It needed a little something though.  My mother suggested adding parsley (mainly 'cause she just came home from a mennonite with a HUGE bag of it, hehe)  It worked.  I'll definitely make this again.
