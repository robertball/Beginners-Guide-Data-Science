I used honey mustard and sliced brie cheese (shredded cheese is too messy when I make melts). Tastes like a fancy cafe sandwich!

I actually combined this recipe with another on here, the Pear and Brie Quesadilla.  I used a tortilla, spread honey mustard then laid down some ham slices, brie slices and pear slices and then pan seared each side.  It was very flavorful and delicious.  I would use this again in a heartbeat.

Made these for heavy appetizers for New Year's Eve party yesterday and they were a hit. I used provolone slices instead of the mozzarella as I thought the mozzarella wouldn't have enough flavor to work with the pear.  I made most with honey mustard and some with spicy brown.

This is great.  Variations on this like sliced apple w/ smoked gouda are fantastic.  Also, try mixing adobo sauce with mayo and omit the mustard for a completely different flavor sensation.

This is delicious!  The combination of the ham, mustard and pears gives it a very flavorful and fresh taste!  It is a quick and easy, but very appealing, alternative to just a "ham sandwich".   My husband loved it!

Excellent sandwich.  Did not have a Panini machine....found my George Foreman to be an excellent substitute .  My frying pan also does just as good, without the stripes.

I was looking for recipes using pears because I had a lot given to me. I used tortillas and made quesadillas. I used swiss cheese because I didn't have mozza. I also used honey mustard. I am eating this now and it is really good.I made this a second time with cheddar and mozza cheese and omitted the mustard. Even better then the first one.

Noy bad, I skipped the pepper since I really don't like pepper.  I'm also not a big fan of pears, but it really works in this.  I did use shredded mozarella since that is what I had, but I think next time I may try sliced apple and sliced swiss.

I was concerned that regular yellow mustard would overpower the delicate flavor of the pear, so I used Dijon which was the perfect choice for us.  Personal taste preference, but in the future, I will use swiss cheese instead of mozzarella which I thought was lost (flavor-wise) in this sandwich.  Swiss and ham are always great partners.  The sweetness of the pear marries well with the ham and cheese.  Enjoyed it, good sandwich.

Really good and easy (of course, it's a sandwich).  I liked it better with a nice sharp cheddar, which I had to use when my mozzarella went bad.  But I'm all about intense flavors.

GREAT easy panini.  The spicy mustard gave it a nice kick, and the pear a good sweetness.  Will be using this recipe often for lunch!

I decided to try this after seeing it under the reviews and I had for the most part the necessary ingredients. I used lite wheat bread and dijon mustard, but I only had 1 slice of ham for each which I folded. I also used peeled thin sliced apple, about 1/4-1/3 of an apple, for the pear. I was confused to why the recipe used lite margarine, but called for 1/2 cup of mozzarella on each sandwich. Either way it was good, but the shredded cheese made a mad mess trying to flip it. I would consider this sandwich again, but maybe with sliced cheese. ty

This was delicious - loved the combination of flavors.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used 1 slice of swiss cheese per sandwich rather than the mozzarella.  Will definitely make again and again!

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this refreshing take on the same ol' ham and cheese sandwich. He was definitely skeptical at first, but the interesting mix of flavors turned him into a believer. Try to be adventurous and give it a chance! :)

I used provolone instead of mozzarella and a President's Choice "Sweet with Heat" mustard I picked up at Superstore.  These were DELICIOUS! on my panini griller using ciabatta rolls.  On my repeat list.  Thanks for posting.

I used leftover honey ham and skipped the mustard.  The pear added a wonderful taste to this easy to make sandwich. We enjoyed this with some homemade tomato soup.  Thanks for sharing, AnPan.

This was excellent as written.  I've also made it using a nice, soft sourdough, Havarti cheese and Honey Crisp or Granny Smith apples with similarly excellent results.  Be sure to use a good quality ham.

I used less amount of ham by mistake and it was still good for me. Also I didn have mozzarella cheese so I substitute it for provolone cheese. Will make it again

I couldn't make enough of them, My Grandsons ate 2  1/2 each I couldn't believe how they loved it.    I will be making it again and with the Grandsons again.  Thanks for such a good winner.

This was good and definitely different from the usual ham and cheese. I used ciabatta bread and it was crunchy and fantastic. Thanks!

I used my George Foreman grill to make these. The sandwich was very good. Thanks for the recipe.
