This is a FUN recipe!  I have made it as a cake and as cupcakes.  For the cake version, I agree that you should make it in layers, rather than putting all the filling into the center.  As cupcakes, I used a pastry bag with a large tip, inserted it into the top of each cupcake and filled until I saw the top of the cupcake rise.  I dipped the top of each cupcake into the glaze and let set before adding the white swirl.  I got 21 cupcakes, filling each 3/4 full and cooking for 18 minutes.  These are better made the day before.  Also, you really need to whip the filling mixture to incorporate all the ingredients well.

The flavor of this cake was very good, but I guess I'm not a bit "Ding Dong" fan....I thought there was too much cream filling in one place.  I made this again but as a 3-layer torte with half the cream between each layer and covered with the chocolate glaze.  As a torte -- it was one of the BEST cakes I've ever made.  The comments were "which bakery did you get this from?" -- I love refrigerated chocolate cake and this one is AWESOME!

Loved it! Made it twice in one week! Just a few helpful hints that I feel were left out of the recipe. 1st, the recipe doesn't clarify which kind of choc. chips. Don't use milk chocolate, use semi-sweet. the milk chocolate never really dried they just stayed shiney, sticky and were too sweet. 2nd in the instructions where it says to whip the white center for four minutes, I think it should be more like 8-10, that's how long it took for mine to get really fluffy.

Well, I made this cake just yesterday. I just couldn't do the cutting and scooping out the cake. So I spooned the filling into a decorator's bag and pipped the filling into the cake. I made several holes on top of the cake (I had flipped the cake upside down on a cake plate). Please use the tip that is the most narrow, as you do not want big holes at the top of the cake. I must of had about 25 small holes from the nozzle of the bag, placing just enough filling, making the cake rise a tad. I was able to use all the filling into the cake. I then went and let the cake set while I did the frosting. 
For the frosting, I put more of the chocolate chips in then what I orginally posted the recipe at, most likely about 1/2 cup more.

This cake is a must for the frig it seems to be more abundance with flavor when it sets for about 2-3 hours.

I hope this helps someone. 
Try using cupcakes! and dip them in the frosting, let cool on tray. WOWZA
Enjoy everyone~~ Cheryl @ the three dog kitchen

This cake was a delicious one in deed.  However i have to agree that having all the cream in the centre is a little too much.  As stated in some reviews that it was not as dry as the real ding dong.  It is because you didn't bake it long enough.  Made two batches and one was left in the oven for 15mins longer than the other and this is where i found one was dryier than the other.  Also i think next time i make this i think i will make it into a jelly roll that you can get from the stores and it tastes like the ding dongs too.  over all i think it is best when the cake sits in the refidgerator for at least 12 hours before you eat it.  Way better when you wait for it.  Thanks for the recipe...it is a definate keeper!!!

Holy Moly is this good! I made this 3 times in 10 days as everyone loved it!!! It's definitely the new favorite in our home. I used 2 9-inch pans instead of a 10 inch--that way I wouldn't have to scoop out the inside. I think it would be great using 3 pans...made like a torte. A couple of things I've learned...make sure you take the top layer off of the cooked milk/flour combo. It doesn't fully beat into the filing mixture otherwise. Also, I put this immediately into the fridge once I've filed it and it sets quite a bit while the topping is made.

I plan to make chocolate cookies, fill them with the filing, and covered them with the chocolate. I think those will be fabulous too!!  Oh yeah, it melts quickly in the heat, so if it's hot where you are, don't take it out until you serve it.

Great cake!!!

This recipe was SO good!!!  I tested it out on fiance and kids first, then took it to work after receiving their 5 star rating. The girls at work went crazy!!  All are begging for the recipe!!  I did not hollow out the cake - instead I did as someone had recommended and made two 9 inch layer cakes and then split them in half to make a torte-like layer cake. It was so pretty and delicious. People are even wanting to PAY me to make this cake for birthdays!!!  Can you believe it!!  Thanks again for this great recipe...it was fun to construct and tasted fantastic!!

Wow, this was such a great idea!  I made mine into cupcakes and used a pastry bag to fill them for a birthday party, and people were begging for the recipe.  I would recommend that you not skip steps and try to use a pre-made filling like cool-whip or whatever.  The filling is really nice because it is a cooked frosting essentially, so it is not terribly sweet and definitely not grainy, so you don't get a cavity per bite!!  Just be sure to get the milk and flour thick like paste before taking it off the heat.  I thought everything tasted fine with the shortening, but I will try to experiment with replacing it for health reasons.  Finally, I also added the hostess cupcake swirl on the tops, since I made cupcakes.  They turned out really cute.  To make the swirl, I mixed a couple tablespoons of butter with about a half cup of powdered sugar, and a dash of vanilla and milk (I really hate store-bought frosting, and that is so easy anyway).  To pipe it, I just put it in a plastic baggie and snipped the corner off.  Also, I thought they tasted better after they sat overnight, since the flavors melded together more.  Overall, excellent idea, will do again.  So little effort for such a great result!!

Great recipe. Didn't change anything.....but I made mini cupcakes. Got 36 mini's out of this recipe. For those who plan to make this, cupcakes are best the day after. If you taste test right away it won't be as good. At least wait til they chill in the fridge. I piped frosting in the middle....used a number 3 wilton tip, pushed 1/2 inch down, piped til the cupcake plumped up. Super yummy!

This recipe is awesome! I followed the recipe exactly except I made cupcakes (filled them about 3/4 full baked at 350 for 18-20 minutes as another user suggested). They turned out great! They key to the whole recipe is letting the cakes get cold! They were so good the next morning!!

Overall, this cake pleased the crowd.  The frosting was yummy and super simple.  I'll use it again and again.  The filling was just ...there.  Not bad and yet there was no sweetness to it.  It was the right texture.  I might try another ding dong filling recipe.  I found one that has the filling made with powdered sugar, cream cheese, and cool whip.  Not sure if it would give an authentic ding dong taste, though.

This does taste just like a ho-ho or a ding dong!  Easy recipe to make...I just cooked my cake batter in two 8-inch round cake pans, then split each in half to make a four layer cake.  I put the cream mixture between the layers, then drizzled the chocolate topping over the top and sides.  DELISH!  Next time I'll try doing the filled cupcakes.  My only complaint about this recipe is that I ate wayyyyy to much of it-not the best for my waistline!

This cake was so good!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I wasn't sure about the glaze, I thought it might be too much chocolate with the chocolate chips, but it was awesome!  Everyone thought it was a scratch cake and they loved it!  It was so moist and the filling is so good!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very rich cake! Just like the title says - it's a giant Ding Dong. I used a Culinique pan, and it turned out perfectly. Everyone was impressed with the looks, and the taste. My husband thought it was really good when he warmed his piece in the microwave for a few seconds.

okay I'm trying to make the filling but no matter how long I beat it the sugar is still grainy. Maybe next time add the sugar in with the milk/flour mixture. ETA: I had to heat this up a little to get the sugar crystals to melt, I didn'twant grainy filling.

Very good and fun to make.  Since other's mentioned the cake being a little moist, I left it in a little longer.  I made cupcakes for DH's work (easier to serve) so I chose to go with the Hostess cupcake look.  The only change I made was to use milk chocolate for the topping glaze, note that I did increase the amount of chocolate.  To get the filling into the center I used a decorater's bag and the long narrow tip.  I used the ready made can of decorater icing for the swirls.

What a fun recipe! Instead of using a 10" springform, I used 2 9" round cake pans. I made the "lid" by making a very thin layer in one of the cake pans, and put the rest of the batter in the other for the main part. This was a little easier than cutting a slice off the top. Also, I used a butter-flavor crisco stick for the shortening in the filling, and that has a yellow color so my filling was not the bright-white I wanted, but it still tasted fine and was not too noticeable. I put the cake in the freezer for 10 minutes after frosting to give the glaze a shiny, hard texture like a real ding-dong. I wish I could make a Giant Twinkie as well as we so much enjoyed the massive sugar freak-out from this delicious cake.

This tastes like a real Ding Dong!  Some things that help: Use 1 and 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips for the frosting.  Also, if the white filling is runny, put it in the fridge for 10 minutes, then try beating it again.  It will thicken up.  I used butter in place of the shortening.  I also made this a 3-layer cake with the cream filling in between the layers.

I've made this cake for several different functions and it's always very impressive. I can't stand the flavor of shortening so I substitute unsalted butter for the filling and frosting. This will be a keeper for a long time, thanks Cheryl!!

There was definitely too much cream filling. I only used half of it and the icing had a really strong chocolate taste to it. My girls loved it but my husband and I thought it was OK. It seemed like a lot of trouble to make and I don't think I would make it again.

I've made this twice, as cupcakes! (think Hostess cupcakes), once with chocolate cake mix, and once with red velvet. Delicious! For the filling, when you let the milk and flour mixture cool, put a piece of plastic wrap on top to keep it from forming a skin. Once cool, simply remove and add to the sugar/butter/shortening mixture. For cupcakes, it only needs about 1/2 the amount, so maybe make 2/3 just in case! The chocolate topping is perfect for cupcakes too, simply dunk the tops of them in the warmed frosting. The chocolate frosting will set up and not be sticky. I then used more of the filling to add the little curlicue touches on top. Serve at room temperature!

This was great!!!  My daughter picked it out for her birthday cake.I read other reviews and took the advice  to make it in layers. So I did 2 nine inch round cake pans then cut them in half and layered it with the filling. I made it the day before and let it sit in the fridge over night.. Everyone gobbled it up.. Tasted WAY better than a store bought ding dong.

I don't like to waste food so I made cupcakes instead of a big cake. Excellent! The filling is fantastic, and the glaze is very good. I made the glaze in the microwave, just heated all ingredients for one minute and stirred until smooth. Perfect!

This was just great.  Delicious to eat, great conversation piece, too!   I made in two 9 inch circle layer pans and spread the filling between.  Stored in fridge overnite.  Will make again and again (for a crowd).

Yep! Tasted like a Ding Dong. My 7 year old and I did a mommy and me day and made this. She was tickled pink. It is one of those things you should make at least once. I, myself, thought the cake part was really moist and good and will make that part again as a cake by itself.

I made this for a group and got many, many compliments on it!  I used an 8-inch springform pan and baked it about 50 minutes.  I used all of my filling--I definitely didn't have too much like others.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the topping, but I think it was a little bitter, milk chocolate chips would have been better.  Beware: this is time consuming, but it is yummy!

Great birthday cake! I baked in two 9 inch cake pans, cut each in half making a four layer cake. It was the perfect amount of filling. The only thing I would do differently is place the cake on a cooling rack  with a plate underneath then pour the ganache over the top. This way the chocolate won't flood the sides of the cake plate which made a mess. If I had done that, the overall presentation would have been as perfect as the taste. A keeper!

THIS IS SOO GOOD!  It is really chocolaty!  Also, what i recommend is that you make the cake, let it sit overnight with the filling in the refrigerator, then in the morning, fluff up the filling and make the glaze, then serve right away. YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Guys, I feel I can follow a recipe and do a pretty good job... but I did not care for this recipe, the filling just did not cut it, it tasted so bad to me I could not even put it in.  Just frosted the cake.... the cake was OK, but not as good as I thought it would be!

I made these as cupcakes and got rave reviews-everybody loved them! My only critique is that I think the top glaze would be better with milk chocolate chips-the semi-sweet seemed a tad too bitter compared to the cake and filling.   This is definitely a new staple in my kitchen!

OK, I LOVE to bake cakes.  This cake is my new favorite, by far!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but I made it as a layer cake with the filling in b/w the layers as other reviewers have suggested. Perfect!  In fact, this cake is so delicious, I cannot keep out of it. It's absolutely sinful for anyone trying to fight their chocolate cravings!!!

My family loved this.  It is VERY rich.  I couln't even eat a whole piece.  I did do what others suggested and used 2 9 inch pans and it worked well.  I did not heat the chocolate on the stove.  I melted it in the microwave on 30 second intervals with stirring in between.  Once it really was almost melted I did 15 sec. intervals so I wouldn't burn the chocolate.  It turned out fabulous and was much faster and easier.  I then poured it on the top and let it drip down the sides and manuvered it around with a small spatuala.  Great recipie!

I have made this cake 4 times in the last couple of months for special occasions and it is now a FAVORITE among family/friends! I found that to keep the cake from drying out, make sure you cover the whole cake with the icing. I also whipped the filling longer than noted which produced a smooth filling vs. tasting the sugar granules. I also drizzled white powdered sugar frosting over the top for a special touch. I'm not sure what the fuss is from other reviewers regarding the difficulty or "takes too long"...I found it was a breeze! While you are baking the cake, mix your filing. It's EASY! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Cheryl! It is a HIT!

What a cool cake!  It takes a while to make, but it's not hard at all.  Everyone absolutely loved it!  Oh, and do make sure to beat the filling to death.  Otherwise, the sugar doesn't dissolve properly and it's not fuffy enough.

I sent this cake to work with my husband and it was gone by 10:00 a.m.  It tasted EXACTLY like a Ding Dong.  I couldn't believe it.  The glaze was perfect and shiny just like it should be.  I did make this in three layers, though, and put the filling in between the two middle layers.  Thank you for the awesome recipe.

Very good! Do wait to eat until it is well chilled though cause the filling tastes better that way. I used 2 round cake pans for the cake,and just barely cut the top of the layer that I used beneath. No sense wasting all that good cake!

Everyone loved this cake!  Very simple.  I cheated and used store-bought frosting (took off the foil seal, heated it in the microwave and just poured it on) to save time.  It was a little too sweet for my liking and it didn't make a nice "shell" like the real Ding Dongs, so I will follow the recipe next time.  This recipe made a lot of the cream filling, so I only used about half of it.

Our most favorite ever. I layer the cake so the cream is more even throughout the cake. I also use butter in the chocolate icing.  I've done it with and without the pudding with no major changes. LOVE IT

This recipe is to die for!  I made cupcakes.  You can use butter/margarine instead of shortening in all parts of this recipe.  The filling is pretty gross when you first make it -- you MUST let the filled cake/cupcakes sit in the fridge at least overnight.  Then, you will be pleasantly surprised.  The graininess disappears and the flavor is great. Everyone who tried mine are begging for more!

Used two brownie mixes instead of cake mixes and tiered them with the white frosting.  Used confectioner's sugar in the frosting instead of granulated. Also used a ganache recipe that was half cream and half chips. No water in the ganache. Very good as described.

My kids loved this cake both the big kids and the little kids, their exact praise was "Mom this cake is the Bomb". A little bit time consuming but well worth the effort. This will be the requested cake for birthday's I'm sure.

I made the cupcakes per other reviewers directions and they were the hit of the party.  A little extra work in making the cream filling but well worth it for the results.  I'm not a cake/cupcake lover but I loved these.

I've made this recipe several times for family, friends, and church cake auctions.  It really is amazing how it tastes like a real ding dong cupcake.  The filling is awesome.  A tried and true favorite!

I've made this recipe twice with great results.  The filling really does taste like that of a ding dong.  And the glaze works great.  I doubled it to make sure it went on smoothly.  Had leftovers, but that's fine.  One day I'll do cupcakes, too.

This was wonderful, but the filling is much easier if you just mix a small container of cool whip and 8 oz of softened cream cheese with vanilla using a hand mixer.  I also used butter instead of shortening in the glaze.  Made this for my fiance's 9 year old son.  Everyone loved it, from babe to grandparents.

This is such a cool cake!  I made it several years ago before people were posting pictures.  Mine turned out beautifully and I got some really nice pictures, I need to find them.  I followed the directions exactly and it wasn't difficult.  Even cutting the top off the cake wasn't hard.  Just use thread!  I do remember thinking that next time I make it I might add some Cool Whip to the filling to make it a little creamier, but it really turned out well regardless.

This was good.  Everyone liked it a lot, although I do recommend that you make it into a layer cake rather than cramming all the filling in one spot.  The filling is quite sweet and is overwhelming on its own.

I have made this cake three times now and it has been a great success each time. I don't scoop out the middle of the cake and it turns out just fine.  This cake is a winner with kids and adults.

I made this cake for my daughters 10th birthday party.  I made it the day before and refrigerated until cake time - I think that helped meld the flavors.  It was a winner all the way around!

This is the best cake i have ever made.  I am the betty crocker at my job and do all the birthday cakes.  Everyone always requests this cake.  It is so moist.  I have even added about a cup of peanut butter to the filling, big hit.  I don't cut the center and put filling in, I pipe it in all over the cake top and bottom.

Our Worship Pastor loves ding dongs, so I thought I'd make him a ding dong cake.  I found this recipe and boy was it a hit.  I've since made 3 and am always asked when I'm making it again.  It was simple to make.

I made this for my daughter's first birthday.  She and everyone else loved it.  Next time I am not going to bother hollowing out the cake and instead I will sandwich the filling between the two layers.  This cake is definitely worth the effort!

I'm a hero now to my husband and visiting nieces! This cake truly does taste just like the old Ding Dongs that we all know and love. This was easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. I'll definitely be making this one again and would suggest it to anyone looking for a simple cake that will wow your loved ones.

I made this cake for my sons' high school football banquet. I was looking for something to appeal to teenagers and adults alike. What a hit!! Everyone loved it, and I did too, it tastes just like the snack cake.  I do have a couple of suggestions, Nestle has a new product which is white and semisweet chocolate swirled chips.  This worked great to cut down on the strong taste of the chocolate. Also, take the discarded cake, put it in a container, take the extra filling, spread on top, and drizzle two spoonfuls of chocolate topping on top.  I took it to work ( they don't care if it's pretty, as long as it's chocolate) Voila!! No waste. Have fun!!

This cake is perfect.  My family thought it was histarical!!  I almost messed it up by not beating the filling for 4 minutes.  It is a must to beat the filling long enough.

For my daughter's birthday, we try to pick a recipe with high chocolate potential. This was this year's winner! We loved it. I did try piping in the cream instead of cutting off the top and pulling out some of the cake. It worked well, but I think the cream would be more evenly distributed if I had cut off the top. This cake was delicious and fun.

I was so excited when I found this recipe.  My sister and I are huge fans of the little snack cake, that we thought we were in heaven after finding this recipe.  While the cake was good and moist, it really didn't taste anything like the Ding Dongs we know.  I think that if the filling was tweaked somehow to get that marshmallow-y, extra creamy and fluffy texture, it would have warranted a better review.  Not a bad cake overall, but nothing too exciting.  I would have given it four stars, but this cake took so much effort to put together.  Don't think I'll be making this one again.  Good to try at least once if you have the time and the drive.

This cake is delicious!  I made it for Father's Day.  It looked great and tasted even better!  I think you could use a 9" spring form pan and adjust the baking times (I had trouble finding a 10" pan except at expensive cooking stores!)  The filling could be used for other cakes too.  Thanks, Cheryl!

MAJOUR WOW FACTOR!!!I LOVE this cake!!!!! Its so easy to make and tastes FANTASTIC! I have made it for a few birthday partys and mothers day occasions and it always gets rave reviews! My only suggestion is to do what another user suggested and skim off the top layer of the milk mixture after its cooled. 10 out of 10!

Wow!!  So great!  I made cupcakes (24) baked for 18 mins @ 350.  Didn't change the recipe at all.  The filling was great.  I arranged the cupcakes on a platter and wrote HAPPY B-DAY along with my daughter's name with letter on each cupcake.  The party is tonight, I made them yesterday and cut into one today to see how the filling looked as I'd never piped filling into a cupcake before.  It was great.  Even though I'm on a mission to lose weight before our vacation next week, I had to have a bite and had to really restrain myself from eating the entire cupcake.    Can't wait to make them again and allow myself to eat a whole one!   Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this cake thinking it would be very rich and heavy. To my surprise, I was totally wrong! Everyone really enjoyed it and asked when I was going to make another. Only thing, I took some advice, made just a round cake and cut the layers in half and used the filling between the layers. I had to guess if the pudding needed to be made before added to cake mix, and if the white sugar was granulated sugar or confectionary sugar. But I guessed right and it turner out fantastic, thank you for this great recipe! I also used this filling recipe for cupcakes, they turned out great! Thanks!

This cake is AWESOME and soo much fun to make! I made this as a three layer cake with the filling between the layers and poured the icing over the top and let it drizzle down the sides. My kids and even my husband who never eats cake loved it. Definately one for the permanent recipe collection.

I made this as cupcakes and was able to get a total of 24.  I whipped the filling for about 8 minutes after adding the flour mixture and it was not grainy. (I think others didn't whip it long enough.) I had a lot of filling left over but think this is because I made the cupcakes instead of a cake so I piped some of the filling onto the tops of the cupcakes. I used milk chocolate chips and didn't have any problem with the chocolate drying as others have stated. All in all they were very good and surprisingly easy to make. Yummy!

This was a fun cake to prepare, my mom and I worked on it together for a family dinner.  Everyone liked it (but they still prefer the chocolate cake/frosting reciped on the Hershey's cocoa container!).  We did not want to use the shortening, so just substituted butter.  We halved the cream filling based on other reviews and it was plenty.  We were a bit leary of the milk and flour rue that starts the cream filling, but it ended up quite tasty.  We also halved the chocolate glaze, did not use the shortening, and it was plenty.  We were glad we tried it - give it a go.

I found this recipe to be very bland, but that is probably because I used the Hershey Special Dark Chocolate chips.  I did not use the shortening in the frosting either (the thought of all that shortening made me ill) so I used butter instead.  The filling was grainy and bland - This is not a keeper for me.

This is so good. I made the cup cakes and it was a big hit with eveyone. The chocolate frosting is the best frosting ever. Followed the recipe exactly and used the dip method to frost them. I'd make them again.

This was a BIG hit w/ everyone I shared it with!!  I rated it 4 stars because it is reeeeeally hard to spread warm icing along the sides of this cake...I mean, HELLO?!?!  How can you spread RUNNY icing?!  I think the directions should've been different for this part.  But other than that, it is FABULOUS!!  :)
You won't be disappointed you tried it!

This recipe seemed like a lot of work to me, and I was totally exhausted by the time I had finished making it. I used skim milk and a vegetable oil butter- substitute for the cream filling (all we have in the house), and it came out tasting like a vanilla pudding. I tossed some of the filling, however next time I will use it all and split the cake into three layers instead of two. My family loved the result, but I wasn't that crazy about it until it had stayed in the refrigerator overnight. What a difference in the taste of the filling! While it had been so-so right after making, it was fantastic the next day. Will definitely be making again, but will make the filling in advance.

WOW!!  I made this cake today and served it to company.  The whole cake was wiped out in one sitting.  The recipe was clear and easy to follow.  I will definitely mark this as a favorite.

This gets 5 stars because my boys ate it completely, not just the icing on the top, but licked their plates clean. Also, it gets 5 stars because it really, truly tastes like a giant hostess cupcake. Only complaint is that with the shortening in the chocolate topping it made it taste strange, I may use butter in the chocolate next time.

This was a great cake, everyone loved it, I did make some alterations.  I felt uneasy about the shortening and vegetable oil so I used margarine and canola oil in their place.  As for the filling I went along with someone’s advice to use whipped topping (fat free) and cream cheese (fat free) with some vanilla instead of what the recipe calls for.  A great cake!!!! Highly recommend you make it.

This was really very good... and it tasted even better 2 days after I made it.

The filling could be improved, I could taste the shortening, but that lessened the longer it sat in the fridge. Next time I'll try it with fresh whipped cream as the filling.

Make this cake, you won't be sorry!

This is absolutely the best recipe.  Good by Hostess.  I made mine as cup cakes instead of the cake and they turned out perfectly.  Identicle to the Hostess cupcake, but way better.  The cake is so moist the filling so fluffy and the icing just wonderful.  Very easy to make for any level of baker.

This cake is delicious!  The only change I made was using 1/2 cup of softened butter in the batter instead of shortening, because I don't like the taste of shortening. I scooped out a shallow moat and filled with the cream filling and it was just the right amount. I refrigerated overnight and I think that is a must. For the white piping, I used 1/2 cup confect. sugar, 2 tbsp melted butter, 1 tbsp milk and 1/4 tsp of vanilla and put in plastic bag and cut the corner.

Quite yummy, and not difficult to make in the least.  A little more time consuming than what is typically required.  I didn't have my usual kitchen equipment on hand, so I baked it in a 9x13 pan and then cut it in half, and scooped out the middle.  Be sure to leave a border/perimeter of cake around the edges.  I also used almond extract, which I would decrease in amount if I make this again.  Overall, very tasty- the cream infuses tastiness in the rest of the cake.

Well received, everyone loved it, although I felt I "cheated" by not making it from scratch! I gave it 4 stars because the filling was good, but fresh whipped cream is soooo much better.  Overall a very good recipe and everyone raved. For those who think it took too long... try a scratch cake with buttercream and fondant sometime,  or better yet, just stick with the bakery!!

I am not a huge chocolate lover so I used a white cake and vanilla pudding. It turned out wonderful. For the filling I used butter flavored shortening. It turned out super. The filling is great as a cake frosting. It isn't too sweet and it spreads easily.

Very good! I used a bundt pan & used 1/2 the filling as reviews suggested, but my husband said next time to make full amount. I'll use 1/2 the glaze though because it made to much. I used mostly white chocolate chips so the glaze wasn't bitter as some suggested it was, this worked well.

First off - I am NOT much of a baker but with the help of Allrecipes and the great videos I made this cake and it turned out GREAT!  Okay, I did run out of vanilla so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of maple extract and it was still delish!!    I made it four layers (although a little lopsided) but my husband is ready for another one!!  This will be my go-to cake for company!

I made it exactly as the directions suggested, and it came out perfectly.  

Also, the weight of the delicious white center squeezes the bottom of the cake, so be sure to leave enough cake at the bottom to support the filling.

Great recipe-I made exactly as written except baked the cake in 2 9” pans for 28 minutes. I whipped the filling for about 10 minutes while I was making the glaze. I maybe could have had a little more glaze since it was hard to cover the sides-might make a little bit more next time. Everyone loved it.

Not being a huge fan of ding dongs, I didn't expect much but made it for a friend for her birthday. It was outstanding! More moist than a ding dong. Will make it again I'm sure.

Loved it!  Made it in two 9" cake pans and then split them in half, put the filling between the layers and added about 1/2 C sugar to the filling.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and can't wait to make it for my sister!

The cake is delicious and very easy to make (although I had to increase the cook time by 5 minutes).  I did not use the filling recipe since it seemed a bit time-consuming, but instead whipped up heavy cream, added 1-2 tablespoons of sugar and 1/8-1/4 tsp raspberry extract.  I used the whipped cream as the filling.  I then melted dark chocolate in the microwave and poured it over the cake, spreading onto sides allowing it to harden in the refrigerator.  I reserved some of the whipped cream and piped several dollops on the top of the cake and placed a fresh raspberry in each dollop - very pretty.  Everyone went wild for it.

for 3 years, this has been the choice Birthday cake. I do the cream part between the layers fairly thick. saving some for writing on the top. the ganache is fun to make. this was the first time to make panache for me. I had to make this as close to sugar free as possible...it was really good too.

Even though I couldn't make my cake look as pretty as the pictures submitted by others it was a very good cake. This cake is a new favorite of our family. I wanted to edit my review. I have made this a few times and it's a cake my youngest request for his birthday yearly now. I now add just a little almond flavoring to the filling.

I made this for my son's second birthday. I used a 6 inch cake pan for his own little personal cake and still had enough batter to make a dozen cupcakes. I did what another reviewer suggested and just stuck an icing tip through the top of the cake and filled sections with icing as well as the cupcakes. Everyone loved them. Great recipe.

Delicious and a lot of fun to make.  I should have hollowed out a little bit of the upper half and not so much of the bottom, but thats just for aesthetics.  I didnt like the outter crust, but maybe if I'd have used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet it would have been better.  Ill try next time!

Even though my cake looked like a hot mess (I didn't let it cool long enough before cutting and frosting) it was SO delicious! Our friends agreed that it tasted even better than the little Hostess cakes! Awesome recipe!

This cake was fantastic. Refridgerating it overnight is key to its success. My boss was thrilled that it tasted just like his favorite snack cake. I did, however, add just a tsp of coconut extract to the filling to give it a little more oomph.  This it a keeper recipe. Kudos to the contributor!

This was the best cake I've ever made! I was so nervous that this might not come out because I've always bought cakes for birthdays....never wanted to take a  chance of it not turning out right! But I saw this recipe and decided to take a chance! I followed another reviewer's advice about making more layers.  I made three 9 inch layers and a bunch of mini cupcakes using mini muffin pans. Had to double the cake ingredients though. I am SO glad I did.  I think just putting all that cream filling in the center of two layers, would have been way too much. The cake is super moist and flavorful, the filling is to DIE for, and the glaze that goes on top dries fast and is easy to work with!  Makes you look like a professional!  Thank you so much for posting this great recipe!  I know I'm going to be making this a lot!

This was so incredbily yummy!  I made it for my husband for Valentines Day and he was so excited about it. 

I ended up baking the cake in two round pans, then slicing the rounds.  I stacked the cake with 3 layers of filling.  

I must say I was trying to get the hang of icing the sides of the cake and was a little too slow, so the icing didn't have the nice "glaze" look I would have liked.  However it would have if I would have been quicker instead of worrying so much!  ha ha 

I made the cake the night before so it had some time in the fridge, and the flavor was fabulous.  

My husband loved it and so did I.  I will definitely make it again.

This combo is good, but not the best I ever had so I only gave 4 stars. I will definitely use the glaze with other recipes. The cake/filling was good but I didn't think the filling and cake were the best compliments to each other. I made this into cupcakes and had alot of fun doing so! A real crowd pleaser~

I used to be able to get Ding Dongs where I used to live.  They do not sell them in VA.  My best friend's birthday was right after she moved here and she loves Ding Dongs.  It sounded a lot more difficult then it was and it was just like the real thing but larger!

Love it!  I was not very good at the glaze topping.  So I put the topping on the best I could, refrigerated the cake then put a second batch of the glaze over the cake to be sure to cover the sides completely. Very rich & very good!

While the cake itself *tasted* good, it wasnt at all the consistency of a Ding-Dong (I had a package of them opened to do a side-by-side comparison). The resulting cake was too moist and dense (likely due to the pudding & eggs) while a real Ding-Dong is more dry & crumbly, with a slight bittersweet choco taste. I didnt proceed with the filling as I didnt want to waste it on a cake that wasnt just right. Im now deliberately looking for recipes where reviewers say the result was too dry or crumbly. The quest continues! (although "Dark Chocolate Cake 1" and "Brownstone Front Chocolate Cake" have both been given "dry" or "too crumbly" reviews.)

I have made this terrific cake 3 times since coming upon this recipe.  My husband can eat half of it at once!!  It's also good made with other types of chips for the top (peanut butter or white chocolate for example).

I made this for a coworkers birthday party.  It looked and tasted like a Ding Dong.  It was time consumming but a lot of fun.

Wow!  This is incredible.  A huge hit with our youth group. Tastes just like the real thing.  Quite sweet, though.  So...beware.  Yummy!

Great deep chocolate taste.  When I filled the cake, I folded in some fresh raspberries, and mounded some on top of the cake before the chocolate set.  It added a light and fresh taste.  All 5 kids and husband loved it.  Thanks!!

I thought the cake was very original but we could taste the shortening.  I think if I make it again I'll try to substitue the shortening with something else.

Good cake, but too much chocolate coating. Will use half the amount next time. Made it way too sweet. Kids loved it, of course!

Great Cake.  Everybody loved it.  Good enough to make a hit at the big family Christmas reunion of the best cooks in the world.
