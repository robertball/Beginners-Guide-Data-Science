Very, very good. The brown butter flavor compliments the sweet potato and adds richness to the dish. Not too sweet. I'd make or eat these in a heartbeat. Such a good idea for Friendsgiving or Thanksgiving.

Great method. I used the browned butter, it was great. I also used cinnamon, nutmeg, white sugar, and brown sugar.

Didn't use cream cheese, cayenne, or black pepper.

I read several reviews.  I used half the cream cheese called for which was plenty.  When I baked the potatoes in the oven they got so soft that once I combined everything it was like sweet potato mush (whipped potatoes).  The taste was there but not a big fan of the texture.  Wished it had more of a chunky texture.  In the future, I might cook one or two more al dente, use 2 to mix with the butter and cream cheese mixture and then roughly cut cubes of the 2 al dente potatoes and fold them in.  I think a sprinkle of cinnamon in this would have been a nice touch as well.

I don't know how to rate this fairly. On taste alone, it's a five star recipe. These were so, so freaking good. But such a pain to make! Sweet potato skins just don't want to stay together once you scoop them out, so you wind up either with a pile of filling on a flat skin "plate", or you have to leave so much sweet potato in the skin that it's hardly worth it. I guess this is why you don't see twice baked sweet potatoes as much as you do regular potatoes. The filling was amazing though, so I might keep this recipe and just turn it into a delicious mashed sweet potato dish instead.

I made a modified version of this dish for thanksgiving and it was a big hit!  I decided to make it sweet instead of savory. I used 3 tsp of sweet salted butter, about 1/3 cup of brown sugar and about a tsp of cinnamon instead of the other ingredients. I also "baked" them in the microwave instead of the oven for the first part of the recipe. I did use the oven for the second baking with the marshmallows. It was like individual baked candied yams without all of the extra calories and juice.  Everyone loved them!  I will definitely make this again!

These potatoes are amazing! I never thought of putting cream cheese in sweet potatoes and was stunned at how well it turned out. I know I ate mine and part of my fh's ! I can't wait to take these to my thanksgiving get together.

Made this for thanksgiving, everyone loved it ! I didn't make individual potatoes with the skins, I just dumped the mashed sweet potatoes in my corningware and sprinkles marshmallows on top - heated in toaster oven right before serving, wow ! The marshmallows toasted to perfection. Some of my bigger potatoes didn't soften enough in the oven beforehand, so I cut out the harder parts and tossed them ... And also cut down the cream cheese because of it. I also added a few more sprinkles of cayenne, and it got rave reviews ! Can't quite taste it at first, but gives a hint of heat when you swallow. Definitely making again, and so easy for a weeknight dinner, too !

Really good, making it for the 3rd time this weekend.  Put it back in the shells the first time.  Just added the ingredients to a casserole the second time and skipped adding it back in the shells.  And skipped the olive oil and salt step to bake.  Didn't need it in my humble opinion:)  A new family tradition recipe!

Very tasty. I added a little bit of brown sugar to the recipe and also sprinkled some on top before baking and it turned out great.

Turned out awesome. Seemed easier to gut when they were closer to the hotter side. I added about a half of a cup of brown sugar and it made the taste so great and similar to a regular stake house prepared sugared sweet potato!

These were awesome! A new family favorite. The only thing i'd do different in the future is not stuff the potatoes but I can be lazy like that :P Well, that and the sweet potato skins can be thin. I look forward to making this again and again!

Because the sweet potato skins became too flimsy and peeled off I baked these a second time if muffin tins. I also cooked these ahead of the meal and then baked them the second time right before serving since I needed the oven at a different temperature for the main course. This worked just fine and I halved the recipe with and without cream cheese. These were delicious both ways in my opinion! Great recipe!

Baking for 60 min was too long. It was hard to scoop out  the potato bc they were so soft and the skins collapsed. And the cream cheese adds a weird flavor and I only added half of what was called for! I love trying new flavors and recipes but this one just didn’t work for me (or my family).

This recipe was dynamite. Everyone loved it. I added sugar and cinnamon like others had suggested, but it's possible it didn't need it. I also recommend adding a fair bit of cayenne because a "pinch" is not really discernable in this recipe. SUPER GOOD.
