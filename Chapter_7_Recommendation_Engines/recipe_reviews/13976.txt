ok so i wanted to make a pumpkin pie for me and my boyfriend but i didnt have any evaporated milk on hand (just about every pumpkin pie recipe calls for this). so i decided to look up a non dairy recipe and i got this pumpkin tart recipe. well i didnt really feel like making any special crust and i didnt have pecans on hand either so i just made a regular pie crust. i also did not have arrow root, which i replaced with cornstarch, and i did not have soy milk either so i used skim. this is just a basic pie for the most part, but it turned out beautiful! and smells soooo good. eventually i would like to follow the recipe exactly, though i will definetly not add so much ginger, as that is a little over board.

This was incredible! I replaced all the spices called for with 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice plus 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon on top of that. The pie firmed up beautifully (unlike a lot of other vegan recipes I've tried) and the crust was rich and delicious. I'm not even vegan but I'll be making this pie from now on!

I have made this the last two years during the holidays and it is good.  I add extra pecans for the decorative topings and substitute a nut milk (I like almond or hazelnut) for the soy milk.  I usually just use ground pumpkin pie spice instead of the spice combo listed.  I have found that this pie is best when the filling is blended extra long in the food processor and stored in the fridge overnight before serving.  Making it the same day seems to result in a less flavorful pie with a gloppier consistancy.

I liked it, though it was not too sweet, except for the fact that it was too ginger-y.  Next time I will make it with a more traditional spice combination.

Arrowroot powder is really great! Thanks for enlightening me. I did change this recipe a lot, I did a graham cracker crust because I'm just a fool for the graham. I used pumpkin pie spice and some dried crushed ginger instead of fresh. I liked the idea of having a gingery pie, but I do think a tablespoon would be too much. I used 'silk' soy creamer instead of regular soy milk, and I think it greatly enhanced the recipe, the pie was not runny at all. Another thing that made my pie perfectly thick, was that I used half the amount of maple syrup, purely because I ran out at 1/4 cup, I thought I had enough! But I really think it was good that that happened. I don't have a huge sweet tooth anyways. But all in all, I couldn't have made the filling any good without this. Try it with the creamer if you aren't worried about fat content,  it's great!

I just want to say THANK YOU for this recipe!!!!!!!!!! This is my first vegan thanksgiving and my mother-in-law asked me to make pumpkin pie. I was a little worried as I am the ONLY meatless eater in a huge family..This pie was a HIT and was so easy to make. I will make this every year and share it with as many people as I can, especially those who think pumpkin pie has to have cream in it!!

My favorite part about this tart is the hearty, healthy crust.  I wanted something south-beach friendly, so no white flour or sugar, and this fit the bill.  I replaced the maple syrup with agave nectar (which is low-glycemic) and replaced the spices with 2t pumpkin pie spice.  It was not very sweet, though, much less sweet than pumpkin pie usually is.  I fixed that by  eating it with ff cool whip on top.  I may add 1/2c splenda to the filling next time.  Also, I did not have any problems with the consistency, the texture turned out great.

I made this last year to take to a vegan Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit!  I will be making it again this year for my family's traditional Thanksgiving dinner.

We have experimented with egg-free pumpkin pie recipes for years -- this is the best one yet!  Substituted rice milk for soy, changed the spices to match the recipe from the festal pumpkin pie can that we used to make.  Thought it could be a little sweeter, so may add 1/4 c. brown sugar to the filling next time.    Served it to a non-vegan family and it was well received!

Easy, light tasting, not too sweet, healthy, fast. I've made this twice now and have decided that it's my 'go to' pumpkin pie recipe from now on. No reason to make any other.

This pie was great!  I think those who thought it was too gingery must have used ground instead of fresh ginger.

I wanted to try this recipe mainly because the crust sounded really good to me.  And in fact it was amazing (even though I had to replace the pecans with pine-nuts as that was all I had).  I couldn't stop eating it.  However I found the filling to be a little - I never thought I'd say this - too pumpkiny.  The texture was really just like mashed pumpkin.  But maybe that's because I used fresh pumpkin and didn't blend it well enough.  I also only used half the amount of maple syrup and even though I thought the result was sweet enough, that surely also contributed to the overly-pumpkin flavour.  So I may try again without these changes.

This smells great, and tastes good too. The filling is perfect, and I love the pecans and maple syrup in the crust but felt the crust was missing a little something... bit blah. However my husband thought it was perfect. Only change I made was I used ground ginger instead of fresh and changed the amount to compensate for the sub. Perfect for my lactose intolerant kid, thank you.

I thought the pie was really firm and the crust is EXCELLENT!!!  I thought the ginger was a little bit much. I am going to make it again with less ginger next time.

I altered the recipe slightly, and it still turned out wonderfully. I made this with a fresh pumpkin, added no ginger because the other comments said it was a bit overpowering and used vanilla soymilk. Also, I added into the crust some granola and ground flaxseed. Instead of using cinnamon I used the pumpkin pie seasoning, which spiced it just fine. The only thing that made the recipe a bit difficult was finding the arrowroot powder and it is expensive. Overall, a crowd pleaser… especially the crust.

Delicious! I didn't have oats, so I used all w.w. pastry flour. The middle was a bit too gooey for my taste. The outer inch was the perfect consistency. Next time I think I'll cook it at 350, and cook it until there's about a quarter-size underdone center, like I do for regular pies. I also subbed 1 tsp. ground ginger for fresh. I prefer the BH&G pumpkin pie spices - 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Very glad to have a tofu-free vegan recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Really liked this.  Not too sweet but can be sweetened to individual taste with more syrup.  Loved the crust!  I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin, less powdered ginger and corn starch instead of arrowroot. Yummy

This was a great pumpkin pie for vegans and non-vegans alike.  I only added half the fresh ginger based on the reviews but I should have added it all. Maybe those who thought it was too much were using ground ginger instead of fresh. Other than the ginger I followed the directions exactly and had no problems with it setting.

Thanks for this amazing recipe!  I made two versions of this for Thanksgiving this year, one as is and the other with some minor adjustments.  The pie that I made following the recipe was way too gingery, so much so that it overpowered the pumpkin flavor.  The crust didn't hold together too well either.  To fix these issues I adjusted the overall ratio of salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger to follow a typical pumpkin pie (so 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1 tsp salt).  This fix the seasoning balance for the second pie.  To keep the crust together, I adjusted the ratio of flour to oats to be 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of oats.  The second pie was much better than the first and was a big hit with my vegan and non-vegan friends.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe for future holiday dinners!

Way too much ginger in this recipe. Nobody would eat it and had to throw it away. Also didn't set up all the way. Was sorta goopy eventhough I cooked it longer than it said. Should have stuck with regular pumpkin pie.

We made this for a vegan Thanksgiving dinner, and it was great.  I had no problems with taste or consistency.  I thought the amount of ginger was fine.  The flavor of the spices may come through more than with traditional pumpkin pie, because it's not as creamy without the evaporated milk.  We made it the morning of Thanksgiving and put it in the fridge until dinner time.  Everyone loved it!

Holy moly this is good! I used 1/3 c pecans in the crust and didn't bother to put any on top. My picky kid who loves pumpkin pie gave me a huge thumbs up - had no idea that it was secretly healthier than the average pie.

"Death by Ginger", the crust was awesome, but... I followed the recipe on the dot, but in the end my pretty looking pie was inedible. I would make this again, but omitting the fresh ginger and using 2T of pumpkin pie spice instead. It did set up nicely, but did not live up to the hype.
