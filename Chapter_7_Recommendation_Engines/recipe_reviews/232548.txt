Having lived in PA all my life the only ingredient in this recipe that belongs in PA Dutch Chicken Corn Soup is the corn. Maybe you should leave this soup to people that know how to make it the right way.

Excellent soup. I like it more soupy so the only thing I did different was boiled the chicken carcus  in just enough water to cover it and used the 2 cups of liquid from that and added an extra 4 cups of water and extra soup Base to achieve desired taste.
