I make these cupcakes in the mini cupcake trays with a little bit of orange zest added to the batter and mini chocolate chips added to the top after the cups are filled.  They turn out to be a rich bite size dessert.  I usually don't bake them for more than 13 minutes and they don't tend to dry out.

Thanks for this recipe...the orange flavour was very subtle even though I added some orange zest like another reviewer had suggested. Perhaps an orange flavoured frosting will be a complimentary addition next time I make them.

Didn't make with choc chips as I didn't have any on hand.  Great for a quick dessert as you'll have most items on hand (or at least I did).  Great for those who don't like an overwhelming sweet taste.  Good...but missing something to make them great/ 5 stars.

I actually thought these were kind of gross.  I'm not sure why mine seemed to turn out so much differently than the other reviewers because this has been rated pretty favorably.  I followed the recipe exactly and they cooked for just the right amount of time...but the flavor was just not what I was expecting from a chocolate cupcake.

OK for a snack, though I don't think I'd serve it as a dessert to guests. The recipe calculates out to 3 WW points per cupcake. Next time I will try substituting some oat bran for some of the white flour to increase the fiber.

Even with a light orange glaze (orange juice and icing sugar) I was disappointed in the lack of orange flavour, but these cupcakes were so moist and tasty, I would definitely make them again (perhaps with more OJ for more flavour)

We really enjoyed this recipe, although they were quite dry, more like chocolate cookies.  A good, healthy vegan recipe. Next time I will substitute for the moisture.

Healthy but not enough chocolate flavor. The citrus was nice though.

They taste better after they've been refrigerated for a few hours.  The chocolate chips help add flavor to the cupcakes.

These were pretty good!  I would say the consistency is like a lighter version of a brownie... not really moist enough for a cupcake... but still tasty!  Next time I will definitely add more chocolate chips.

These cupcakes were a bit dissapointing. Instead of being moist, mine came out fairly dry, and the chocolate flavor didn't pop. In the end, they were bland. I served them with a choclate frosting, but a citrus frosting might have complimented them more. Still, they were healthy, so I can't complain.
