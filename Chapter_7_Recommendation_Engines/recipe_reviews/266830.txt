SO good! I'm definitely going to make this again since everyone LOVED it!  First off, I just sauteed everything in the pressure cooker on SAUTE mode, instead of dirtying a separate skillet on the stove. I recommend adding salt to taste, in the finished product, as it was missing a little something. But once it's all put together in a taco, topped with pickled onions, cilantro and some queso fresco, the flavors just compliment each other so well!  I also recommend reserving the water that you soak the chilies in, in case you need it. Once in the blender, I found the mixture a little thick, and thought it might cause issues in the InstantPot, so I added a couple tablespoons of the water to give it a slightly thinner consistency.  I suspect the meat would be done in much less time, but I opted to follow the 60 minutes in the directions. The fat in the meat was perfectly rendered and delicious!

I am a newbie to IP cooking, but I have been getting fantastic results!  This recipe is one of the best things I have made !  I'm  not a very good photographer but just know the taste is totally there!
I took the advice from France C. and saved the water from the chilies because it was needed to get the consistency I was looking for.
I used corn tortillas, shredded the meat, added pickled onions, and chopped cilantro.  Delicious!
Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good! I used the saut√© function instead of using a separate skillet. I also used one whole roast,then shredded it and cooked for 10 more minutes. Delicious. Simple to make tacos with complex flavor.

This recipe was very good and easy. I didn't seer the meat and it turned out just fine. I did add a packet of taco seasoning to give it a more flavor.
