Surprisingly tasty! I do think salt is necessary here, regardless of feta. I add a pinch to the onion/zucchini mixture while sauteeing which really helped bring out the flavors of the vegetables. Very easy to make and a healthy, filling breakfast - or in my case, dinner! I sprinkled a bit of extra feta over top before serving. I did need to adjust the salt a bit at the end with a couple twists of my sea salt grinder. The dill really makes the dish, and I imagine using fresh dill would be even tastier.
