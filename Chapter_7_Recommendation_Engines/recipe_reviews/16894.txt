Trick to this soup is using uncle Ben's original 23 herbs and spices Wild Rice WITH the spice packet.  You don't need salt if you use this.

Excellent and easy. A very thick and hearty soup. Great with homemade bread.
I used a box of Uncle Bens Wild Rice and found that at the end I had to add one more can of chicken broth. It soaked up all the moisture. No problem,it was a quick fix and it solved the problem.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it's quite easy to make. The only change I made, based on other reviews, was to a tbsp of chicken bouillon soup base. It added a bit more flavor and salt. I also included quite a bit of salt. It's very hearty, almost a stew so I may add more chicken stock/milk next time. Will definitely make again.

Loved this soup. Kept it in a crock pot 1/2 day while my friends and I baked cookies. We all had coffee cups of wild rice soup throughout the day.

I mixed up dough in my bread machine and served this delicious recipe in homemade breadbowls. It was the perfect meal for a cold night. I doubled the recipe and my husband ate it for nearly every meal for three days. He then complained I had not made more. The only downside was that it required quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavor. Even so, definitely a keeper!

I made this for my church group of 25 women last week.  They're still raving about it and all want the recipe.  I told them where to find it.

This was great.  I used shallots in place of the onion and I think next time I will leave out the celery (personal preference).  Used half of a rotissere chicken and uncle ben's wild rice mix.  You can get everything else together while the rice is cooking.  Very quick and delicious, everyone at dinner loved it. Thanks.

Reminds me of "Tastefully Simple's Creamy Wild Rice Soup"! I wanted to make it just a tad healthier so I made a couple adjustments. I used half brown rice and half wild rice and cooked them in broth. I added extra celery (diced) and added cooked carrots. Left out the butter and used 1 T. Olive Oil, worked great. This was one of the few recipes I found that called for milk instead of cream, but it was plenty creamy and thick. I used 2% but next time I'll try skim for even less fat.

This was delicious and tasted very much like the wild rice soup you get in restaurants (I hate the canned versions). I added some carrots and 1 tbsp of chicken bouillon for some extra goodness. It was a bit thick and started off a little bland, so in accordance to the other reviews, I'll be adding more milk and salt the next time I make it. It's very easy to make even for a novice mac-and-cheese cook like me!

I was not impressed with the flavor.  Even after added carrots, parsley, sage, and LOTS of salt, it was nothing special.

This soup was really good.  I used a package of of Zatarian's new orleans style long grain & wild rice.  It seemed to give it more flavor. I also added 2 chicken bullion cubes. I will make this again & again!!

We really liked this soup after we added some additional spices (curry, dry mustard and parsley) to boost the flavor. This is perfect for a cold winter’s eve when you need some comfort food.

This soup is really yummy.  The perfect soup for a cool autumn day!  I made some slight modifications: Shredded rotisserie chicken; regular, long grain rice and made my own seasoning- onion powder, garlic salt, lemon-pepper seasoning, dried parsley and dried basil; and sauteed garlic and onions.  I'll definately be making this recipe again during the cold days coming up!

Good hearty soup on a cold day. Did like others and used the Uncle Bens with 23 herbs and spices. Used about 2/3 of the rice after it cooked. Added some carrots I had left over and a chicken bouillon cube as others had suggested and it seemed to work out. The first bowl added some pepper the second a few drops of Chalula hot sauce, very good. A nice crusty bread made it a real meal.

This really had no taste to it at all.  It's only semi-creamy and I don't understand the point of the rice if all you will do is pour the liquid over it!

I was skeptical while making this b/c it didn't look impressive - but it tastes so wonderful. If you use quick cooking wild rice, be sure to add extra stock to the final soup b/c the rice absorbs so much liquid. Fantastic with salad and buttered bread.

Simply wonderful. Made it the first time as writing. Second time I didn't have celery so I added carrots and a bit of curry. Delicious as well. I have officially become a Chef John Groupie. Always wonderful recipes

Excellent! This is very creamy and hearty. I used an extra tablespoon of flour to thicken it up. I might try adding carrots next time. Definitely a keeper!

The only problem I have after making this is that my tongue is now burned! :) Delicious and easy to make. I have three boys 8 an under so after adding the milk and broth, before it was too hot, I blended it all together.  It still thickened just fine and my boys didn't have to frown at chuncks of clery and onions. Two of the three boys loved it and want me to make it again. This will definitely go into the cold weather rotation, next time I will add some homemade rolls and it will be perfected.

Very easy and delicious soup. Perfect for cold days. Our son lives out of state and requests this recipe upon his arrival.

Great soup and very easy to make. I picked up a roaster chicken from the store and it was super easy to throw together. My husband loved it too. Will definitely be making it again.

Great, easy recipe! I doubled the recipe and added a little bit of white cooking wine (had to use it up!), chopped carrots, and some garlic powder for flavor. This will be a go to recipe in my house!

I have searched for a recipe that tasted like a wild rice soup we had in Michigan several years ago.  This is close, if not even better, and so easy to prepare.  Will definitely make it often.

I made this soup tonight and was not very pleased with the results.  I followed the directions and the soup turned out VERY thick and it tasted like chicken and rice in gravy.  I ended up adding some shredded cheese and sauted garlic to it to try and help it out but it only helped a little.  Quite dissapointing.

This recipe is delicious!  Followed instructions.  My left over buffalo chicken breast gave it a nice subtle 'kick' in the soup.

This soup was fabulous!  I doubled the reciped because I had some leftover mesquite, rotisserie chicken that I cubed and that seemed to really add to the flavor.  I also added mushrooms and slivered carrots.  A delicious, hearty soup that's a meal in itself.  I served it with warm, homemade bread.  My daughter wants to eat it for every meal.

This was really good, and I like that it uses milk instead of cream.  I will definitely make this again.  One change I will make personally is that I added carrots and they took forever to get soft in the creamy broth and actually never did get as soft as I wanted before I gave up, so next time I will cook them at least part-way through in a separate pan before adding them to the soup.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I like my soup a little thinner so I added more milk.  Definitely a keeper especially since it is so easy to make and tastes great!

We're from Central Minnesota where Wild Rice Soup is a staple. This soup was much too bland for us. It definitely lacks flavor/seasoning. In the end, we doubled the seasonings and added garlic. It was closer, but still wasn't like home.  We'll try it again but will add 50% more wild rice and do some research on seasonings.

I added about 1/2 cup half and half and no flour. I like my soup creamy. It definitely lacked in seasoning. I added sage, parsley, and herbed poultry.

This recipe is a good starting point.  It lacks flavor and does not make a lot.  Cream or half and half would have been better than milk. I used poultry seasoning and garlic to add flavor.  This soups needs lots of salt and pepper too.

Because we recently moved, I couldn't find my recipe for my wild rice soup so I made this yesterday.  It is very good but based on the recipe I usually make, was not as big of a hit with my family.  I think it would be better with a little tweeking, I would add bacon (fried) and also substitute the milk with either whole milk or half and half to make it a little more creamy.  The way I look at it is, if you are going to make something that isn't necessarily all that healthy anyway, you may as well make it taste really good.

Outstanding!  I used 2 cans Kirkland premium chicken and added 1 c. diced carrots.  I used whole milk.  It was more like a casserole than a soup but it was fabulous.

This turned out really good. I doubled the recipe and added a carrot. I also tossed in some leftover rice pilaf I had in the frig. I did have to add some additional broth and milk because it turned out a bit thick. I also used the Uncle Bens rice with seasoning like suggested.
