LOVED the quick prep of this recipe.  I halved the meat(only) and put whole fresh green beans where the other four breasts would have been.  Doubled the stuffing (on top) and added some basil (made presentation nicer with the green flecks and added a little more flavor). LOVED IT. The whole meal in ONE DISH! Mine took longer than recipe stated (to get chicken to done temperature-65 minutes). I will try baking at 375 degrees next time-seems to me it would be quicker and just as good.  I used a white Merlot wine. My family thought the wine was a little too strong-I will use (just a little)less next time or maybe a different kind. Also, this would be great for company-as you don't have to "babysit" it. There WILL be a next time for this one... Thanks, Darlene.

I've been making this dish for years, and making it exactly as written.  I made it last night for the first time in a while, and I'd forgotten how good it is.  The stuffing mix on top is simply to give the top of the dish some crunch, not to be considered as a side helping of stuffing.  I've always found there to be plenty of sauce.  Easy to prepare, and good enough for company.

This was actually very good for such a quick meal!!  Seasoned the meat before doing anything.  I used four cans of cream of chicken for more sauce but used 3/4 cups of white wine.  Also used 3 boxes of Stouffers Savory Herb dressing which I prepared before adding to the pan.  Doubled the cheese as well.  Covered the pan with foil while baking.  Can uncover for last 10-15 mins if you want dressing crispier.  Excellent taste for such little preparation!!!

This is sooooo delicious!  I have made it twice now.  The second time I did not have all the right ingredients so I substituted the white wine with chicken broth and I used mozzarella and cut up some fresh parmesan, and It was still unbelievable! I also drizzled the butter on top of the stuffing too.  This dish is so amazing and after a long day of work, itâ€™s so easy to make.

This is one of my go to quick fall comfort meals. This can be adapted to the crockpot. I layer sliced onions in the bottom of the crockpot and lay the chicken over the top. I wait to sprinkle the stuffing mix and butter over the top until an hour before serving. I use Healthy Choice soup and a whole box of Stove Top instead of just a cup. We like this paired with hot fluffy whole wheat biscuits and roasted broccoli.

I'm cooking this as I type and it smells great.  I just wanted to say that I wish people wouldn't knock down the stars on a recipe (for instance, see review on July 1 by bpmj) when they didn't make the recipe.  I really depend on the star ratings and it's frustrating when somebody essentially makes a different dish and then leaves less than 5 stars.  I've wanted to say this so many times while reading reviews on this site. I just do not understand why so many people do this. If you didn't make the recipe shown here, why review it at all? What's the point? You changed it completely, then weren't wild about YOUR dish and then leave a less than great review? Why?  The next Day: My review - as we've now eaten the meal - it was wonderful! The wine added such a lovely taste when you were expecting more plain crunch from the stuffing.This is absolutely on my "do it again" list! My husband also loved it and wanted to know I'd really start one of those weekly menus where every one knows Sunday is Roast Beef night and Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti night. That's not happening. We ate this with plain old Pennsylvania Noodles, corn on the cob and some sliced up thin patty pan & sliced round zucchini squash that had been marinated a short time (1/2 hour maybe)and then cooked along in a pan along side the chicken. Everything was so good! I should have taken a photo but we were starving. Thank you Darlene!!

I use 1/2 cup milk instead of wine in this recipe because I don't like the flavor of white wine. I also use a whole box of cornbread stuffing instead of just one cup. It's definitely easy, great comfort food.

This was very good.  I would line the pan with stuffing, though, as the sauce was really soupy and didn't thicken up much.  The stuffing would really soak that up and it would be delicious!

Yummy recipe and goes very fast. Cooked chicken a little bit beforehand and cut baking time in half. Will try it with some bacon bits next time. Everyone loved it. Thanks!

I made this the other night and it was wonderful. I use half the amount of chicken breasts and season them a bit first and didn't change the amount of sauce. I used cream of mushroom soup instead. I doubled the bread crumbs putting half on the bottom to form a layer before adding chicken to soak up some of the sauce along with some fresh mushrooms. The sauce mixture was 1 can of soup, a little mayo, 1/4 c. white wine, threw a little shedded cheddar on top in the last 5 minutes of cooking.

I love this recipe. So glad I found it.  My mom gave it to me over a decade ago and it disappeared a while ago. It's the perfect dinner when you have people over but don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen.  I usually make some changes.  I triple the sauce, add tarragon to make it more savory, use a whole bag of stuffing (when using an 11x13 pan) and drizzle the butter over the top of the stuffing before baking.

I've been making this dish for several years and was surprised to see I'd never reviewed it as it is one of may favorite "go to" recipes.  This is easy as the chicken requires no browning prior to baking.  I usually avoid recipes that include canned cream soups, but I'll make an exceptio for this one.  Between the stuffing mix and wine, the canned soup taste really disappears.  I would not hesitate to serve this to company.

WOW, super easy and delicious! My husband loved this. I followed recipe as directed and it came out great. If you want less crispy stuffing - spoon some of the sauce over the chicken when it first comes out of the over. By the time you have everything else on the plate it has softened.

My entire family loved this.  Very easy to make, but tastes like I really fussed.  I doubled the amount of sauce so there would be enough to spoon over rice.  I put this together the night before, then refrigerated it. I will definitely made this recipe again!

This came out perfectly!  SO is an *extremely* picky eater and he loved it...so this one is definitely going in my repertoire.  The stuffing topping is really tasty with the swiss cheese and makes the texture nice and crunchy.  I made it with only 3 chicken breasts and there was just enough sauce to cover the bottom of the pan.  We agreed that next time it might be good to start off as the recipe instructs but then flip the meat halfway through and cover the other side with cheese and stuffing as well.  If you put the sauce under the chicken, it's the perfect dish for picky eaters who don't like "saucy" foods...and yet the chicken comes out incredibly moist and tender.

This has a really good flavor!  I used chicken broth instead of white wine and I also only used 4 breasts.  My only complaint is that the cheese seems to just melt into the sauce and you dont really know its there.

YUMM!  We all loved this dish!  Big hit.  I didn't have any stuffing mix, so I used bread crumbs and it worked fine.  Served with noodles and the sauce was a nice compliment.  Very good dish, thanks for posting.

My kids all love chicken casseroles that have cream of chicken soup as one of the ingredients so I decided to give this a try.  I think you could easily use bread crumbs or cracker crumbs in place of the stuffing and get good results.

I made it with 3 chicken breast and followed the rest of the instructions exact. I served it with rice and loved the sauce.  Next time I will try seasoning the chicken first.

I have made this twice in one week to rave reviews from the family and no leftovers. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used shredded mozzarella cheese instead of swiss (that is what I had on hand). The second time, I baked it at 425 for 45 to 50 minutes since my oven took forever to cook it at 350. Additionally, I used the amount of topping the recipe calls for for 8 pieces of chicken on 6 chicken breasts...it was perfect. Thank you for the recipe!! It is delicious, easy and looks so fancy. I agree that it is company worthy.

I would definitely recommend softening the croutons/stuffing cubes in milk or water beforehand. I lined the bottom of the pan with the dry stuffing (plus sauteed celery and onions for flavor), placed the chicken breasts on the stuffing, added the cheese and soup mixture, and then topped with additional stuffing. The only complaint that I had was that any sauce that would have been created for the chicken was absorbed by the stuffing underneath, which created a wonderful flavor for the stuffing, but left the chicken a little more bland than I would have liked.

This chicken bake is delicious and very easy to make.  I doubled the stuffing and it was perfect.  This is a wonderful recipe to make at the end of a busy day.  I will gladly make this one again.

I made this EXACTLY as it states, and it was amazing!!  I used white cooking wine, and it didn't specify what style bread crumbs so I used the stove top box version.  This is one of the best, easy recipes on this site.  Thank you Mrs. Darlene Roberts!

So, so good.  I added some chopped onion & seasoning.  I also stirred the top around toward the end of cooking to moisten the stuffing a bit. My picky eaters are already begging me to fix it again.

Fantastic recipe but I did do a couple of things to make it my own. I partially sauteed the chicken breasts in a bit of olive oil and seasoned them with salt and pepper. I also diced an onion and some celery which I also soften in the frying pan with a bit of olive oil. I added the onion and celery mixture to my sauce in the bowl. I didn't use swiss due to the fact I am the only one that likes it, instead I used a shredded italian cheese blend. To my sauce I also added some savory which really made it yummy. I made stuffing for a side dish and had some green beans. Talk about comfort food, this is it!!!

Tip: melt the butter in a large measuring cup or bowl, add the stuffing, and mix to coat.  THEN put that stuff all over on top.  It fries up real nice!  I usually melt a whole stick and a lot more stuffing.

Great recipe!  My husband & 5yr.old daughter LOVED this dish...the only change I made was use provolone (because that's what I had on hand..and it was delish), but look forward to making it with swiss cheese as written.  Thanks for posting this great, quick and easy recipe.

Family Loved it!  Even a lower fat verstion- I used homemade no salt chicken stock instead of cream soup can for lower salt/fat option, increased the wine a bit and used 4 slices munster cheese (didn't have swiss in the house) and low salt stuffing.  Every bit was gone from my picky eaters.  Perfect!

A comforting and tasty dish. I found it a bit salty, but that may be my fault for using *gasp* cooking wine ;-) I think next time I'll add toasted slivered almonds...

MMMM..very tasty.  I made a few changes though.  I didn't have swiss cheese so I sprinkled a layer of shredded chedder and mozza on the chicken breasts, then combined 1 can of soup, 1 cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup of sherry because I didn't want to open a new bottle of wine and then I omitted the butter.  The stuffing crust was a nice touch to this recipe.  I served it with broad egg noodles. My boys raved about it!

I actually got this same recipe from my girlfriend, Debbie, a few years ago. In my home we call this dish "Debbie's Chicken". This is so easy and yummy. It's really good served over steamed rice.

I has some chicken breasts that I needed to use up so I found this recipe and decided to try it.  I sure am glad I did.  The dh loved the crunch of the stuffing mix and asked to have this recipe again.  I did not have swiss cheese so I use provolone, I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup and added garlic powder to the chicken.  This dish was so fast and easy to make.  Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe because it is so easy and kid-friendly.  I usually add some garlic powder, black pepper and parsley to the soup mix.  I also vary the cheese based on whatever I have on hand.

delicious, easy, and I normally keep the ingredients on hand. Although I did have to substitute cream of mushroom for the cream of chicken and some other cheeses for  the swiss, it still came out very well received by my family. I will use it again.

Lacked flavor...was another canned soup chicken recipe with flare (swiss cheese). I was so excited to make this but I didn't care for it and when my husband who eats everything said it was "alright" I knew we wouldn't be making it again. Followed recipe exactly but doubled swiss . Preparation was simple so thats a bonus. The chicken was very moist and tender...just perfect! This recipe needs something. ???? Thanks for submitting..I may play around with this a bit. Baked at 375 for 1 hr...covered with foil minus last 15 min...chicken really is so juicy.

Totally awesome :) But I did use Cream of Broccoli soup because thats what I had. Other than that change, everything else was the same. Smelled amazing, tasted better!! I served it with mashed potatos, which was perfect to mix with the rest of the sauce-y goodness.. My never impressed Boyfriend actually said, "Wow, this is good!!" Which is better than his usual, "Its fine.."

This is an excellant dish.. I had to give it only 4 stars because I changed and added to the ingredients... After spraying my dish with Pam, I lightly sprinkled some herb seasoned stuffing on in the dish, then I sprinkled each chicken piece with McCormick Montreal Chicken Seasoning and black pepper, then wrapped each piece of chicken in one slice of cheese... I doubled the sauce (cream of chicken and I used milk instead of wine), I then poured the sauce over the chicken, sprinkled the chicken with a generous amount of herb seasoned stuffing and then poured the butter over the chicken... I doubled the amount of butter.. I baked at 400 for 1 hr then covered and cooked another 15 minutes....

Easy, impressive, and delicious!  The crispy topping is great!  Any type of cheese works well.  I'd recommend sprinkling a bit of black pepper on the breasts before adding the cheese, but no need to season with salt-- the cheese and stuffing are already salty.  Some sliced mushrooms would be good on these breasts, too!  Great with broccoli.

Thanks for sharing this great, easy recipe Darlene.  It was a breeze and very tasty.  I made it as written but added a little poultry seasoning as others had suggested.  I didn't have any problems with it being too salty and like Mallinda said it is company worthy.  :)

I just made this and it's awesome!  I used a whole box of stuffing and added 1/2c water and 1/2c milk to make enough sauce. I read previous reviews about the chicken possibly being bland so I seasoned with poultry seasoning and browned each side of the chicken breast on high heat. I didn't have any Swiss cheese on hand but I did have Colby Jack. It's really yummy and super easy.

This recipe was pretty good, but not great. I did modify it a bit. I used 4 chicken breasts and cut them into bite sized pieces. I used 6 pieces of swiss cheese instead of 8. I used pinot grigio for the white wine, which was quite good. On top I put an entire box of reduced sodium stove top stuffing. I drizzled about 1/2 cup melted butter on top of the whole thing--including the stuffing. Without the butter on the stuffing, it would have been too crunchy. I baked the whole thing for about 40 min. My husband, dad and 2 yr old son liked it, but it isn't a favorite dish.

I really like this recipe my mother taught me how to make it about 8-10 years ago.  It is a fast and easy recipe that everyone that eats it loves.  Sometimes I will leave out the wine.  Or you can mix the cheeses up a little.

This had a really good flavor, the sauce was excellent. I made it in the afternoon and let sit in the fridge for a few hours. I did not see adding butter on top of the sauce, so I omitted that step. Served over egg noodles. This recipe makes alot, so will be eating for lunch the next few days. Definatly will make this again.

I truly enjoyed this recipe, my wife was not as fond of it as I. This was my second time trying the recipe. This time I did not have any stuffing mix, so I used Italian Bread Crumbs. I also added some poultry seasoning before the bread crumbs and butter. I really like the tangy taste.I will try again for sure. Thanks for the recipe.

I made some changes to this recipe. I don't care for the way the swiss cheese tastes with the soup. So I subed it with provalone.  Also, I used cream of mushroom soup.  Instead of stuffing, I used cornflakes (crushed) and added it to the melted butter.  It was great!

Too bland.  Doubled sauce and put half of stuffing on bottom....stuffing turned out fine.  I will make again, but will probably marinate the chicken first and maybe add some black pepper and basil to sauce.

A+ for ease of preparation!  Truly 10 minutes!  I used only 2 chicken breasts and substituted garlic cheddar cheese on one.  Also used a box of Stove Top stuffing and put 3/4 of it on the bottom of dish as suggested by other reviewers.  I also used Sherry instead of white wine.  The chicken was very tender and the flavor was good, but there was not enough sauce (not sure how this would work for 8 breasts!).  I may try again using less stuffing and serving over rice.

Hubby loved this: "It's a keeper", he says. A nice, chicken dish. Ironically, because I used low fat soup and cheese, a little skim milk would have helped to sauce it a bit more. (I too, put the stuffing on the bottom of the pan.)

Super easy to make and pretty tasty.  This is a great mid week recipe for evenigs when you can't devote a lot of time to meal preperation.  I used low sodium/low fat cream of chicken and mushroom soup and added a bag of mixed frozen vegetables in an attempt to make the dish healthier.  I always keep the ingrediants for this dish on hand....just in case!

This chicken recipe is the best! My whole family, including the kids, loved it! I used chicken broth instead of white wine, and I doubled the stuffing.
I recommend this recipe to everyone! It is so delicious.

I will definitely make this dish again-probably on a fairly regular basis.

This is an excellent recipe!  I used half of the chicken and ended up with a nice amount of sauce left over.  My husband, not a big chicken fan, says this is one of the best chicken dishes he has tried.  I heartily recommend it!!

It's only two people in my family so I use half of the amount of chicken and cheese. I use the same amount of everything else. I don't put the stuffing cubes on top. I make a a box of stuffing as a side dish and it's  really good.

YUM! One of my family's favorites! I don't change a thing except I make more sauce! At 1st I was a bit hesitant about the swiss. I'm not a big fan so I did experiment as others did but in my opinion it never seems to come out as good. The flavor of the swiss is meant to blend with the wine so just give it a shot before you change it :) Make sure you buy the crushed stuffing. I bought the cubed once & ruined it. It doesn't soak up the sauce/butter like it should. It was dry and rock hard.  I use a package of swiss slices (most brands are 7-8oz packages) 2 cans cream of chicken, 1/2 cup white wine, 1 1/4 cup herb-flavored crushed stuffing mix with about 6 tbsp melted butter. We love to pour the sauce/stuffing mixture over our side of mashed potatoes :) You could play with it to your liking just don't over do the stuffing as it will dry it out. In closing my last tip is for people like me who cook with wine but don't care to drink it. When I first started making this recipe I would just buy a single bottle of chardonnay without much thought. The recipe calls for very little so the remainder of the bottle just went to waste. At one point a light bulb went off & I thought to buy a Sutter Home 4 pack (chardonnay) for close to the same price! It works out perfect! There is little waste (remember I double the sauce) & 3 more small unopened bottles for the future! :) Hope my suggestions were useful! Enjoy!

This was a very good recipe. Only changes I made was mixing the dressing and the butter together before placing on top of the chicken. I also placed some sliced onion on the bottom of the casserole dish before adding the chicken. I may bake it just a tad longer next time too. Thanks for sharing

I make a variation of this recipe that is exactly the same except it uses Mushroom Soup instead of Cream of Chicken.  We call it Drunken Chicken.  It tastes heavenly and is begged for by family and friends!  Another thing I have done with this is to mix up a box of Stove Top Chicken flavor stuffing with hot water and the butter the Stove Top calls for and put this on top instead of the herb stuffing and butter.  Either way this is fantastic!

This was great!! I did make some changes though.  I used shredded mozzarella and added another can of cream of chicken on top the last 20 minutes to bake the stuff on top.  Next I'll probably add another cup or two of stuffing.

This goes together quickly, and my whole family eats it up. I never seem to have seasoned croutons or stuffing mix around when I make this, so I usually just crush up some ritz crackers - no need to salt the chicken then as the salt from the cheese and crackers is more than enough. The topping is tasty, the cream sauce has a little zing from the cayenne.  I love it.  I never add mustard seed as the kids don't like, but it is still delish!

Great recipie. I ran out of Swiss cheese slices so I used pepper jack- it gave an extra kick. The wine  makes chicken very tender. I mixed the melted butter with the stuffing before placing it on the chicken. I had no left overs everyone loved it

Absolutely delicious. My husband is not a fan of chicken, but he loved this. I doubled the sauce, and it was a huge hit.

This recipe was so easy and my husband claims he could eat it every week. I use low sodium stuffing mix (about 10 oz.) and it still tastes delicious!

Love this recipe.  My grandmother showed me how to make it.  Her recipe called for dry cooking sherry instead of white wine if you don't keep alcohol.  I don't drink white wine, so I buy one or two of these cheap little mini bottles (like they have on the airplane) and it is just the right amount.  Have also made it the day after New Year's with some leftover champagne which was my favorite!  I usually serve it with long grain wild rice.

Very good but a little salty.  I might try a different stuffing and a low sodium soup in the future.  I seasoned each side of the chicken with poultry seasoning as suggested.  I also threw on a slice of ham on top of each breast to make it more like a mock cordon bleu.I also prepared the stuffing with FF chicken broth (and used extra stuffing) to make it a lower calorie meal.  All in all, very gratifying to throw something together this quickly and have it turn out so well.  Thanks!

Easy and delicious.  The sugestions about using more stuffing mix sounds like a good idea as there is a large amount of sauce.

This was nice and quick, the chicken turned out very moist and had a nice flavor.  Next time I think I'll add some garlic and onions to spice it up a little because it was slightly bland for my taste.  I'll definitely make it again, though.

This is quick, easy and tastes very good.  To make it a little 'lighter', I used fat-free cheese slices, smart balance instead of butter and the low sodium soup.  I also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I was impressed with the simplicity and really like the stuffing, although I put it in a ziploc and rolled over it to break up some of the larger pieces.

We really liked this. I used shredded swiss and mixed it with the soup and wine. I also used half a box of stove top stuffing for the topping. Will make again.

This was a good meal, although mine came out a little too salty.  I used chicken broth instead of the white wine as some suggested and substitued provolone cheese.  Not sure which piece (soup, stuffing, chicken broth?) made it too salty.  Next time I will try white wine or maybe just milk.  But all in all a good one, and super easy!

Pretty Good.  The chicken was tasty but the stuffing part was not tasty.  I followed others suggestion of putting some stuffing on the bottom, but it turned out to be a mushy mess.

Even my picky husband claimed this was a "good dinner" BUT I think changing the Swiss cheese to a Habanero Cheddar did the trick in spicing it up. Also used chicken brother instead of the wine and cornbread stuffing mix for the bread crumbs. I would definitely fix again this way. (Note: I reduced recipe down to serve 2)

Very good recipe.. although it seemed like something was missing..  maybe it's because I'm not too fond of swiss cheese, not sure.  Also in response to a review below, this recipe can be easily prepared in 10 minutes, it took me 12 min (I actually timed it after reading that review).  I'm not as experienced of a cook, so I'm sure somebody who's been cooking for a while can do it in no time.

I was expecting more of a fluffy stuffing rather than crunch bread topping.  I put 3/4ths of the stuffing on the bottom of the pan, but even then it didn't get really fluffy, I think next time I might cook the stuffing first and then put it in the pan.  As for how fast it is too put together, I thought one woman was exagerating when she said she came home at 5:00 and it was in the oven by 5:10.  Just so you all know, she wasn't.

Easy to make and tastes great. I didn't have any wine on hand, so I used chicken broth instead. After my husband ate his plate full, he said you definitely have to make this again! Next time I make this I will try using wine.

Excellent flavor..I opted to use mozzorella and crushed croutons and bone-in chicken breasts. Sprinkled with a bit of garlic salt and parsley. I forgot the butter..didn't make a difference..still was very good..

We've called this recipe "Swiss Chicken" for several years.  It's wonderful for fancy dinner parties or for a quick fix!  I especially like the flavor combination when served with asparagus and with lightly steamed, slivered carrots.

This was AWESOME!!!! I didn't know what to make for dinner and I had all the ingredients (except I had cream of mushroom garlic soup), I noticed how easy it looked and I figured I would try it , well my husband is not a big gravy fan and he was licking the pan it was so good!! Thanks for a great dinner I will definetly be making this again!!!
