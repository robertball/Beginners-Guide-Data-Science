My children didn't even know what meatloaf was, as I had never made it before.  My childhood memories of meatloaf did not provide any encouragement for me to make that dish for my family.  

When I ran across this recipe, it was so highly rated that I decided to try it out.  My family loved it!  I have made it many times since.  I even made it for a friend's family when she was convalescing after surgery.  Her son said, "This is better than your meatloaf, Mom!"  :)  She requested the recipe and now makes it for her family.  

I used to use the slices of bread but I really like using dry bread crumbs better (about 1 cup).  I don't end up with any visible chunks of bread in the loaf.

Very moist and tasty! A few substitutes: I used 1 small can tomato sauce in the meat mixture in place of lemon juice and ketchup mixture; eliminated beef bouillon granules and added salt, pepper and garlic powder; and used 2 slices of bread instead of 3. I've also made this dish just using ketchup as glaze and it comes out great! I baked potatoes at the same time; total cooking time was closer to 1 1/2 hrs. My husband and grown children love this meat loaf! Grandkids don't like the onions; onions should be chopped fine or they don't cook through. This dish also cooks best with very lean beef, under 7% to 15% fat. Serve with corn and a simple tossed salad for a great, easy meal.

As much as I love my mom, her meatloaf recipe wasn't the best.  I've been looking for one to replace it,and this is the one!  The best part about this recipe is the glaze/sauce.  I doctored the actual meat loaf up a little bit with some minced garlic and finely chopped green peppers and onion, some seasoning (garlic salt, onion powder, etc), some steak sauce, etc...  I also used bread crumbs instead of the cubed bread.  It came out perfect anyway-very moist and flavorful.  Double the amount of sauce so you will have some extra.  I served the leftover on a couple of little toasted French rolls with melted Provolone and extra sauce as a meatloaf sandwich.  Great recipe-thanks!

My Mother's recipe is close; we use vinegar instead of lemon juice.  Use 1/2c italian bread crumbs/or 3/4c oatmeal instead of bread. Everyone that has ever eaten it says Eureka!! when they taste the meat and the sauce together.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with everyone.  Finally, they've discovered our secrets.

I have yet to find a meatloaf that I REALLY love until this one!!  The glaze is wonderful and adds a great flavor to the meatloaf.  I did use 3/4c breadcrumbs rather than the bread slices. I have just found in the past that bread slices sometimes makes the meatloaf soggy.  If you're looking for a fabulous meatloaf - this one is a definate keeper!!!

This recipe turned out really well.  It was very moist and had a nice, tangy sauce that was similar to Boston Market's.  
I made the meatloaf (my first ever) according to directions except for the following things:  I added about 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix and used 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of bread cubes.  I also followed others' suggestions of using only 2 TBSP. of brown sugar for the sauce.  It was still plenty sweet - we wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter.  
Will make again.

Better than my mom's!!! Just like others, I used 1 c. bread crumbs instead of the bread. I chose to omit the onions from the meat mixture, and add 1/2 tsp. onion salt, to save my 6 yr. old from picking through it. I also added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 2 cloves of garlic to the meat. I doubled the sauce recipe, adding more sauce to the meat and used a mixture of half lemon juice and half apple cider vinegar. Then, the BEST part, was choosing to add potatoes and large onions around the meat. I sliced 3 large potatoes, and half an onion and mixed them with olive oil, salt, pepper and a little of the sauce mixture. Rather than waiting until the end to add the sauce, I put it on at the beginning. I cooked everything for around 1 hr. 15 min at 375. It was delicious. Everyone had seconds and my son said they were the best potatoes he had ever eaten. I was sure to pick out the large onions for him, then, everyone was happy! This is my NEW meatloaf recipe!

I just love the recipe.  I make it all the time.  I was low on ketchup, so I added some chili sauce (Heinz makes it) and some barbecue sauce in the fridge.  I also substituted lemonade for the lemon juice.  Still tasted great.  You can pretty much add anything you want and this will still come out great.  It's the sauce you put on afterwards that really makes it.  And I always end up adding some breadcrumbs because it's still too moist with just the 3 slices of bread.

This is a very nice recipe...not my favorite but if you're looking for a nice change I suggest you try it. I did not change a thing and for the most part it was really good. I'm not a lemon fan. For the thoses for change more than one thing in a recipe then complain about it...it's not fair to rate a recipe that YOU have altered!!! If you have a recipe that you feel is better I suggest you submit it.

This was good! I loved all the flavors. The only problem for me was that it wasn't cooked through after the hour and ten minutes. I think next time I will cook for an hour and twenty, and then another ten after the glaze. The glaze is great though!!

YUMMY! Was looking for a tasty new meatloaf recipe! Found one!! Only changes I made were to use maple syrup instead of sugar in the sauce, add fresh garlic, a little extra onion, and some of the catsup mixture directly in the meat. I also used oats instead of bread crumbs. Results..... AWESOME!!! Whole family ate it up... even the baby! Thank you!!!

Very good, i never add lemon juice and just use salt and pepper not bouillon granules. I sometimes grind the bread a little in my food processor-for more uniformity- and if you have onion haters in your house try using dry minced onion they will never know its there!

This is the ONE!  I've been looking for five years for a perfect meatloaf.  The sounds that came from my husband told me I have found it!  Thank you to the cook that submitted this one:) I loved it too and I'm not that keen on meatloaf.

This is the one and only meatloaf recipe for me!  I used to make it often, but my now husband said he didn't like meatloaf, so I haven't made it since we've been together.  Well, I finally made it without telling him.  He gave me a hard time for making it, but he ate it and the leftovers (and he's not a left over eater).  Success! :)

I've never made meatloaf quite as good as this one, it tasted real good. I followed the recipe exactly except I added about half of a medium onion (about 1/2 cup) instead of a 1/4 cup, and I think this recipe leaves room for extra ingredients to be added of your preference!

Family favorite, I cut off 10 minutes of cooking time.  10 years ago I made a meatloaf so bad that my husband was sick for 3 days and wouldn't even talk about meatloaf for years after...  I made this a few months ago and he requests it all the time now, the kids love it too!

I like this version of meatloaf, and my whole family like it too. The meatloaf came out very tender and juicy every time I made. The flavor is strong enough the mix up the just beef taste.

My family loved this meatloaf!  I did make changes, some were made because of necessity (that's all I had), others were made because I wanted to.  I doubled the glaze & used 3 lbs of ground beef/ground pork mix.  To it I added 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs & parmesan cheese.  Sauteed the onions in a little butter to soften them.  Added 2 eggs & some minced ginger, too.  This gave me enough mixture to make 2 loaves.  I don't like cooking meatloaf in a loaf pan, so I cut out some parchment paper the size of the meatloaf & cooked the loaves on a rack atop a cookie sheet.  Yummy!!!

Best meatloaf I have made in years! Everyone loved the flavor! My husband and my seven year old especially liked it. I loved it! Will make regularly. (Substituted some onion powder for chopped; subbed some worcestershire for beef broth; added some garlic powder. Flavor was like a unique bbq sauce almost. The sauce would be great on grilled ribs!

This is an excellent meatloaf recipe. Up until finding this one, i used an old standby recipe that was handed down to me from my mom. I only tried this because of all the rave reviews it got, and it definately is a keeper!! My husband liked this one better than my old recipe. I did make a few changes only because I did not have a few ingredients on hand... Instead of chopped onion and the bouillon granules, i used a packet of Lipton Onion soup, which I think added great flavor. I also used a cup of italian breadcrumbs instead of the cut up bread slices, but next time i will substitute oatmeal becuase i like the texture oatmeal gives meatloaf over the breadcrumbs. The sauce is rather sweet, but that is just the way we like it at our house!! Thanks for a great recipe! Two thumbs up!

I loved this!!  It was a little sweeter than what I'm used to (I've never used brown sugar before), and I've always used bread crumbs and a ton of spices.  So this was a nice change!

This was an awesome dish, for a novice meatloaf maker.  I doubled the sauce, and I still wish I had tripled it actually!  I also used a cup of breadcrumbs instead of the bread.  Totally delicious!

This is awesome! I didn't have beef buillon cubes so I used the Lipton beefy onion packet. And topped it with brown gravy instead of the rest of the ketchup mixture. Only becausey my husband loves brown gravy. The best! Must try!!

According to my friends, this tastes better than the brown sugar meatloaf recipe.  I added dry onion soup mix & lots of ground pepper.  It's so basic, so simply, yet so yummy.  I think the ground ginger in the meatloaf was just too different for our tastes.

If I could give this 100 stars I would!  Fantastic, anyone looking for your go to meatloaf recipe, this is it.  No leftovers, which is a shame because I wanted to take a meatloaf sandwich for lunch tomorrow.  Next time I'll double it :) Thanks so much for posting this one.

My husband and I loved it!! We made double "sauce", because my husband loves tons of sauce on his meatloaf. I used 1/2cup brown sugar and 2x the rest of the ingedients. I didn't have beef bullion, but it was still great. I did add a little salt and pepper.

Great recipe.  Cut up some garlic and bellpepper with the onion.  Also used Italian bread crumbs instead of bread.  Unless it's sweet potatoes or sweet and sour chicken, I'm not too big on eating sweet tasting foods so I omitted the brown sugar and lemon juice.  Added a little A1 steak sauce to the ketchup and ground mustard and it turned out superb.  Will try the original recipe just to see how it is but I gotta be in tha mood for that sweet taste.

Very good! I have to say, though, that I was SHOCKED when adding in the nutritional info for the WeightWatchers PointsPlus program. It came out to 16 points per serving, or 96 points for the entire loaf! For meatloaf!! I just knew there was no way that could be true. So I looked up the ingredients I used (Hunt's all natural ketchup, 93/7 ground beef, etc.). I used 2 pieces of bread this time instead of 3. The points came out to 52 for the whole recipe, or just under 9 points per serving...almost half what AllRecipes said. I wonder if they're basing it off the fattiest ground beef? Anyway, just a little tip for anyone counting points! The recipe is great...this was our third time making it!

This has been my go-to recipe for meatloaf since I discovered it last summer. It's now one of the most requested dishes for my meat'n'potatoes lovin' family!  It is a staple in our menus and will continue to be so! The sauce is absolutely amazing, sweet and tangy! YUM!

Excelent recipe, the meat loaf itself reminds me of my moms that I have missed for years. Of course she used just ketchup on hers so the sauce included in this recipe is a welcome addition. Like others I doubled the sauce and added 1/4c chopped green pepper (like mom use to). I also made it an 8x8 glass dish. Thank you sooo much.

I liked this recipe first because it was different than any I had ever made. Secondly, I had all the ingredients. I could taste the lemon juice but I thought it added the zing that most meatloaf does not have. I did not change anything and I agree with others, DOUBLE the sauce because you will want more! Thanks for the sharing the recipe.

I made this twice and both times it came out pretty good.  Next time I'm going to try it with turkey instead of beef and see how that works.  (I'm cutting red meat out of my diet.)

Very Good.  I substituted 1/2 c. bread crumb to each lb. of meat instead of bread slices.  I eliminated boulion cube and just used salt, pepper, garlic powder.  I added two minced cloves of garlic, 1/2 c. minced pepper and onion. I also threw in a half can of tomato soup just for moisten sake. The glaze was a little on the sweet side, but I'm a sucker for sweet.  Turned out just how I remember my mom's!! Thanks!!!

I have been making this recipe for a year now and I'm finally going to review it.  First let me tell you the changes I made.  I double the sauce, and add just a little bit extra than called for into the mixture, and put the rest on top when it is time to do so.  I also end up cooking this for about 10 min longer, as my meat is still sometimes pink.  This is BY FAR the best meatloaf recipe I have come across.  My family just raves and raves about it!  The glaze on it gives it the perfect flavor when having cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day.  Just add a bit of ketchup!  Thanks so much for the perfect meatloaf recipe.  I really don't want to try anything else, this one is it for me!

I just fed my family this recipe along with Slow Cooker MAshed Potatoes from this site.  At first, I didn't like the sauce.  Once paired with the potatoes, it was great!  My husband ate half of my plate before he left for work!  I followd the suggestions of a few and used 2 TBSP of brown sugar, added 1/2 pkg onion soup mix, and 1 cup of bread crumbs.  I doubled the onion, and the sauce.  I added half of the sauce to the meatloaf which made it a really moist; just right!  If you dont like sweet sauce, reduce to only 1 TBSP brown sugar.

I had never eaten or made meatloaf before - and this was absolutely delicious.  I doubled the sauce, and heated up the extra in a saucepan to pour over the sliced meatloaf.  I will probably triple the sauce next time. I also used 1 cup breadcrumbs instead of the bread.  This is definitely one of my favorite recipes.  Try it!

Yum!  I don't like meatloaf, but I loved this one.  I combined all suggestions.... put 1 piece of bread and 3/4 cup italian bread crumbs.  I'm Italian so everything gets garlic added....about 2 cloves crushed.  I used 3 tablespoons worcestershire sauce instead of bouillon.  I also doubled the sauce for extra....an absolute must!  The only change I would make is to add some real onion.  I added the lipton soup trying to get mostly the flakes so the mix wouldn't make it too salty, but it wasn't enough onion flavor for us.  Next time I'll add 1-2 tablespoonse of chopped onion with the onion soup mix.  Thanks for a great recipe and all suggesions!!!

the only ingredients I added was some garlic-2 cloves, tbl spoon of hot spice, and a squirt of BBQ sauce. It,s become a weekly expected meal.  I've also experimented with combo's of beef and pork ,veal, deer and moose meat! Still comes out quick and easy!!!!!!

This was a delicious meatloaf.  Everyone, including all four kids, loved it.  I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing, Delia!

Delicious! I added a crushed clove of garlic and used vinegar instead of lemon juice (didn't have any).

I would give this a 6 if I could. I love it. I made revisions after reading other reviews: I used breadcrumbs and some Ritz crackers instead of bread, added lots of onion and spiced the meat up abit with garlic, pepper, onion powder. I made extra sauce like other suggested and used it all up. I even made it another time with ground turkey, it was good but I still like the beef better. There is no way not to like this one.

To sweet for my taste but everyone else enjoyed it, so I would say it was a hit. I of course had to take to topping off for myself...still I will make again since everyone else enjoyed it...

I'm not a huge fan of meatloaf but my husband loves it.  I tried this recipe bc of all the great reviews and I found it to be pretty good.  I didn't really care for the sweetness of the glaze but my husband really like it. If I make this again I will probably leave out the brown sugar.

This was simple and delicious.  I made as directed except forgot to put lemon juice in the meat mixture. OK, I was in a hurry and misread the recipe.  I would make this again just the same way as hubby and even my onion-hating son loved it.  A hint to make nice firm meatloaf:  once you have put the mixture in the loaf pan, pat it down, then drop it hard on the counter a few times.  Of course, it has to be metal pan.

Really good! I used Italian Bread crumbs (3/4c.) instead of bread. We ate all but a slice, my husband loved it. Serves well with smashed potatoes and corn. Will make it again. Thanks.

This is a keeper in my house. I have tired it with lemon juice and w/out. It seems a little watered down with the lemon juice so I have cut it down to just 1tble spoon. I love it both ways. My kids it and my husband asked for it all the time..

I used my own recipe for the meatloaf, but used the glaze for the top.  I used about half to  cover the top and allowed it to bake for the entire time.  I then used the additional amount right at the end and broiled it on low for a few minuets to get a good gooey glaze on the top.  VERY YUMMY!!

This is awesome. No one eats meatloaf in my house. So I decided to make this with a side of creamy mash potatoes 2 also from this website. Everyone raved. I loved the glaze.

YUM YUM YUM. Yum. I made this at a friend's house and forgot to grab the beef bouillon, so instead I used 1 1/2 tsp each soy sauce and Worstershire sauce. I also used about 1 tbsp. regular prepared mustard instead of the mustard powder. This is the best.. the best! The coating on the outside didn't really get as sticky as I normally like, so next time I'll probably cook it for 15-20 minutes instead of the recommended 10 minutes. This is definitely a keeper!

I have already reviewed this but felt the need to do it again because I did some things different (even though the first time "as is" was 5 stars as well).

This time I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I doubled the ketchup mixture, used a little extra onion, and used a chicken bouillon cube instead of beef.  I used my mini food processor to chop the onions and bread.  Not only did we all love it, but my 2 year old who is very picky ate more then I did!  Also, my husband, who always complains about the onions, thought this was perfect.  I believe that because I used the food processor the onion was chopped much better then I would do myself and therefore cooked better.  Anyway, this recipe is a definite winner all the way around!

My family loves this recipe! My boys(1,3,4) always ask for more. As usual I did change the recipe slightly. I doubled the sauce and added 1T of vinegar. I used 3/4 cup of oats instead of bread. I precooked the onions and omitted the bouillon since they all have MSG in them.Instead I used 1 tsp. curry powder and 1 tsp. ground meat spices (salt, ginger powder, pepper, nutmeg, marjoram, cardamom, chili powder).

This meatloaf is a huge hit!! I did make a few changes. I used 1/4 cup of ketchup, 1/2 cup of Gates BBQ sauce, substituted a mix of worchestire sauce and balsamic vinegar for the lemon juice and used a dry onion soup mix instead of chopped onions. I also toasted the slices of bread before crumbling them into the mix. This is now everyone's new favorite. I made it a second time for a big family gathering and everyone wanted the recipe. My aunt has already made it twice! Thank you for helping me find a way to make meatloaf spectacular!

This was really good.  I only gave it a 4 star for the following reasons.  First, I added salt, pepper and garlic (I've never heard of a meatloaf without salt & Pepper) and a little extra bouillon.  If I hadn't I think it would have been very bland.  Second, I would change the glaze slightly.  It was really really sweet.  I think I will cut the sugar down (maybe in half) next time.  I will also put the glaze on at the beginning and let it carmelize and get thick and goey.  10 minutes wasn't enough time for the glaze to do more than get hot (barely).  I personally like my glaze to become "baked on".  Over all, it was a great meatloaf.  It held together better than any other meatloaf I have ever made which means it made a wonderful next day meatloaf sandwich!

My boyfriend wanted meatloaf last week and his method is to usually stick some meat on a pan and let it go.  I offered to try my hand at it and chose this recipe.  And what a delite it was!  Very delicious and a definite addition to my recipe collection!  Thank you for sharing.

The sweet/tangy sauce makes this meatloaf great. I wanted to use up some bacon so I fried it, chopped it up and added to the hamburger before baking the loaf. Next time I make this I, too, will double the sauce as another reviewer suggested. Thanks for sharing, Delia.

This is not the type of meatloaf I grew up on so I typically don't make one's like this but my husband was having a craving for a recipe like his mom used to make and I decided to try this one out (I used white vinegar instead of the lemon juice like my mom used to do). Well he said it matched his moms if not better and asked if I could make it more ofter- I will, I enjoyed it too!

I tried this for supper last week, and my family really loved it.  I cook for my parents; my mother is quite picky, and she had a second helping.  It's great!

This meatloaf was really very good!  I didn't put it in a loaf pan and I didn't use bread slices.  I used bread crumbs and shaped it in order to put it on a rack to drain fat.  I'm not sure that I would call the taste sweet-and- sour-like, I would call it sweet and tangy.  Overall, the best meatloaf recipe I've tried!

This is a very moist, tasty meatloaf.  My husband says he could sit down and eat a big bowl of the glaze.  Fortunately, he's not doing the cooking.

My family and I like this recipe very much.  I have made a few adjustments but nothing major.  I use half cup of panko bread crumbs instead of slices of bread.  I also add about 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I use 1.5 tsp of "Better Than Bouillon" beef base instead of granules.  Line the bottom of a loaf pan with 2 slices of bread to soak up excess grease.

Awesome is all I can say!  I followed the recipe with the exception that I used 1 pound mild italian sausage and 1 pound ground turkey.  I also used 1 cup italian bread crumbs instead of bread and no onion added.  This was amazing! Remember to double the sauce so you can dip it!  My husband raved about it and took all the left overs to work and ate them all!!  Definitely a repeat for my house!

This was wonderful! My picky 3.5 yr old LOVED this and requested (with 3 reminders) to have the "extra" in his lunchbox the next day.

A couple revisions: Used vinegar instead of lemon juice, approximately 1 cup dry breadcrumbs instead of the bread slices, and ommitted the onion.  

I baked the loaf in 4 mini pans to cut the bake time and also so I could easily freeze the extra for a quick meal another time... unfortunately there were no leftovers to freeze!!

This meatloaf was very good.  I am always looking for different way to make it.  The meatloaf and sauce was full of flavor.  I think next time I will double to sauce to have some additional sauce to place on the sliced meatloaf.  Only changes I made swere to use 1 cup Italian Panko Breadcrumbs, used a whole onion chopped  and I used one beef homestyle stock serving in place of the granules.

I am 36 years old and my mother is the best southern cook in the world (ministers wife). However, I did not like her meatloaf!! This is my 1st time EVER making meatloaf and I must say "awesome". I added some homemade tomato sauce to the glaze.....

I made this for my family again the other night and they finished it off so fast, even my 4 year old boy.  When I commented on it, my husband said of course they loved it, it's like candy and meat all at once.  It went over well in my house full of boys.

This didn't taste like a meatloaf to us...it tasted more like a hamburger. We are used to more flavor in our meatloaf. The glaze was tasty but otherwise, I will not make this recipe again.

Great recipe! This was my first time cooking a meatloaf and it was wonderful...The only thing I would change would be thld be to cut back on the brown sugar...The glae is a little too sweet for my taste, I add pickled jalepenos to the sauce, my famliy loves  spicy food! This one will be going in our recipe book!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. My son who is the most pickiest eater ever likes it. I have made it twice in one week because it is that good! I have even passed on the recipe to family and friends. The only thing I changed was the bread slices. I used a half cup of bread crumbs instead because I'm kinda lazy. lol  Thanks so much for a home cooked meal that my kids will finally eat!

WOW really good! I followed others advice, used 3/4 cup bread crumbs rather than slices, onion rather than onion powder, a dash of hot sauce in the glaze, and I didn't have any mustard on hand but it didn't matter, SO GOOD! Really, I never liked meatloaf as a kid. This was great, my fiancee and I will definitely make this again. :D

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe, the family loves it! I did have to substitute vinegar for the lemon juice because I had none, but it still turned out wonderful. Didn't change anything else.

The glaze is excellent. I always make mini meatloaves in a muffin pan. Then they have nice browned edges. We ate this with Tater tot casserole II from this site.

So good!  Just the right combination of ingredients and the glaze was just perfect.  The only thing I did different was to serve it with a sauce made of tomato soup, 2 tablespoons of the drippings, and ¼ cup of water.  You just heat it through and serve it on top of the meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  It is an old family tradition I can’t do without.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was EXCELLENT meatloaf...a keeper for sure.  I did not add bullion (didn't have) and I used bread crumbs...mixed everthing else first and then added enough bread crumbs for proper wetness.  I also added green & orange peppers...just about 1/3 of each.  Really good.    Note:  I purchased one of the perforated meatloaf pans (mine was Wilton from Walmart but I'm sure other brands have similar) and I can not believe the difference it makes in meatloaves.  Seperates the grease so your loaf is not swimming/cooking in grease.  Worth the $8. I also doubled the sauce 'cause we like things saucy 'round here (the meatloaf too!) :-)

This was the absolute BEST meatloaf I've ever had.  I increased the quantities to feed about 8 of us, and it was gone quickly.  Everyone had seconds, and thirds...I can't wait to make it again.

I love this recipe.  This was my first recipe for meatloaf and I don't think I'll change it.  Like some other reviewers, I season the meat, double the sauce and leave everything else the same.

I have prepared this recipe twice.  Both times, my meatloaf turned out very moist.  The sauce for the top is absolutely wonderful (it makes the dish).  But, the meat itself has not been too flavorful.  Next time, I might try doubling the sauce mixture and adding more sauce to the meatloaf.  I also think I will add some more spices to the meat.  Overall, we really enjoy this dinner (including our one year old!)

I tryed this recipe on my second go round with Meatloaf. Let me tell you round two was much better than round one. My boyfriend is the most picky eater I have ever been around. Worse than my 4 year old. . . He ate this and commented that it was better than his moms! That is huge, everything I make gets compared to his moms, and it never measures up untill now !! Thanks

The plainest meatloaf I've ever had.  There was no taste to the loaf.  If the it wasn't for the glaze I would have thrown away.

This meatloaf was excellent. I used ground turkey instead of beef and it tasted delicious.   Also, I used breadcrumbs instead of pieces of bread.

My husband says this is the best meatloaf recipe I've ever made, so it is the only one I use now.  I didn't divide the lemon juice (same as ericak, misread the recipe first time), so I put it all in the sauce mix.  I also cheat by using a package of onion soup mix instead of chopped onion and beef granules (saves on time and prep), and I substitute 1/3 cup dried bread crumbs for the slices of bread (I don't like the occasional lump of bread that inevitably ends up in the loaf).  The glaze is nice and tangy/sweet.  Highly recommend trying it!!

When I first found this recipe, I was really excited because it appeared to mimic the recipe my mom used when I was growing up. However, I was a little disappointed when it finally came time to eat. The meat itself was kind of on the dry side and the glaze was just a bit too sweet and simultaneously tangy for my palate. Maybe I overcooked it? It's a possibility, so I can't fault the recipe for that. But I probably won't make this again, sorry. :(

I really like this a lot. It's the only meatloaf my boyfriend will eat! I substituted the onion with onion powder (I love onions, my boyfriend does *not*) and added garlic powder and a little salsa.

My husband loved it! He said it was the best meatloaf he has ever eaten.  I replaced the onion w/Lipton Onion Soup, replaced the bread chunks w/ 3/4 cup bread crumbs, doubled the sauce & it was absolutely wonderful.  Will use this recipe every time.

Hands down the best meatloaf I've ever tasted....yes, even better than others I've tried on this site. The secret is the glaze, it's really really good! This will replace the other meatloaf recipes in my file. Thanks so much for sharing. Now that it's gotten cold outside, we will be making this quite a bit!

Excellent! I made some small changes- used cider vinegar instead of lemon juice and worcestershire sauce instead of the beef bullion, added salt, pepper and garlic. Here's a hint - double the sauce and save some to pour on top of the individual slices.

Very good recipe. I was looking for something different for my meatloaf and decided to try this one. I am glad that I did. Used bread crumbs and oatmeal instead of the bread, onion soup mix instead of the bouillon and prepared mustard instead of the powder. Turned out delicious. Thanks for sharing.

I made this meatloaf tonight for (3) people; two of which do not really care for meatloaf.  The only changes I made were I added one package of Lipton Onion soup mix instead of the onions and a tad of milk as the mixture looked dry before cooking (it was super moist after cooking).  The preparation took me a lot longer than the estimated 10 minutes stated; my brown sugar was hard as a brick & I squeezed my own lemon juice rather than use the nasty stuff in the squeeze bottle.  I'm giving 5 stars as 2 of us gave a 5 & one a 4.  Maybe we are pigs, but the recipe stated 6 servings and there is only about one serving left after 3 people eating.  If I had more than 4 people I would make another loaf.  BEST MEATLOAF WE EVER HAD!!!!!!

This recipe is great! The only thing I would suggest is to double the sauce and add more than 1/3 of the original sauce to the meat mixture before cooking. The texture was great and an hour and 10 minutes was a perfect cooking time!

WOW! I can't believe I made something that tastes so good! This is the BEST! I made a few modifications as others suggested by sauteeing onions, using 1 C. bread crumbs instead of bread chunks, reduced brown sugar to 3Tbsp, and added about 1Tbsp steak sauce and I couldn't have asked for anything better! Served with sweet corn and sourdough baguette. I was so proud of myself, but should probably give Delia some credit!

Excellent meatloaf!  I thought the recipe sounded a bit bland so I added some garlic, parsey and more onion.  I also added more crackers and egg.  I forgot to add salt and pepper and I was surprised to find out that it doesn't really need it.  Putting the glaze in the mixture really does the trick!  This is a keeper.

This recipe is very good. I added one sweet onion - diced and some diced portabella mushrooms as well as a couple of diced chillies. The flavor and texture are wonderful. I served the meatloaf with mashed potatos and mushroom gravy!!! We will be making this again and again.

This recipe was great!  The sauce on top was delicious!  However, next time I will add a little steak sauce in the meat loaf to zip it up a little.  My whole family enjoyed this! Will add to my recipe file.

Great recipe!  After reading other reviews, I used only 2 tbps of brown sugar.  I also used bread crumbs instead of bread.  I made extra sauce to pour over.  This will replace my old recipe.  Thanks!

This was moist and delicious.  I cut down on the brown sugar to 2 tablespoons and added 1 clove of garlic minced.  I will make this again.

The meal was a hit! I made a few minor changes and would make one major change next time... I pre-sautéed the onions with a little salt and pepper. I added about 1/4 cup of chopped celery and 1/4 cup of grated carrot. The meat loaf was wonderful. The glaze was a bit much, so next time I will make less of the ketchup sauce- just the amount to go in the loaf... To finish off the look I drained the loaf and then inverted it in a 9x13 pan to finish it off for 10 min. (next time I will top with tomatoes (Dan Quale was correct) and maybe just a touch of cheese)... then out of the dish, on to the serving platter and it was beautiful.  Try it once and you will be sold too.

The glaze was really good, but the meatloaf itself was a little dry, maybe because I used 80/20 ground beef.

I sauted the onion and garlic. I added carrots shopped very fine to the onion and garlic. Instead of ketchup I used a little bit of tomato sauce. I also put in some parmesan chese came out great. Got the kids to eat carrots without knowing it.

It was OK.  I made it as described but I would need to double it in order to fit the loaf pan.  It just wasn't "awesome" or "great"...but it was decent enough to say We Liked It.

Great. Even better when it's baked in a small cast iron skillet. Use 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb spicy or italian sausage.

This was excellent, I however was trying a lighter version, so I used ground turkey instead of beef, I also used light brown sugar. I did not have the lemon so as someone else suggested I replaced the lemon with white vinegar. I also used italian bread crumbs about 1/2-3/4 cup. I managed to bring the calories per serving down to 360 with the ground turkey, next time, because there will be a next time, I will use ground turkey breast and that will bring the calories down to 300 per serving. This recipe is a keeper. oh on a side note I did not have the bouillon granules so I took 2 cubes and used my cheese grater to grind them up, I think it was more than the amount called for but it was wonderful !

I never really liked meatloaf but my husband wanted it so I went ahead and tried it. He said it was the best ever! Even better than his mom's! Even I like it! The things I did differently: I didn't add lemon juice, I used oats (about a cup) instead of bread crumbs or pieces of bread, reduced the brown sugar to 1/4, placed two pieces of bread on the bottom to soak up the excess fat, used regular mustard not mustard powder, used onion powder instead of onion and added garlic powder as well. Hope this helps!!!

i have never made meatloaf on my own before. this recipe was very easy and delicious. i did forget to add the mustard powder to the sauce but it was still good. i might use a little less sugar next time only becaause it was just a little too sweet for my taste. it was moist and tender and had great flavor. I did add some Nature's Seasons seasoning to it though for extra flavor. Will definitely make again!!

These meatballs were awesome. I used the same sauce I use on my meatloaf, a mixture of brown sugar, ketchup and mustard powder.  Bought French bread and made meatball sandwiches.

My kids don't usually eat meatloaf but this one was an exception!  I used 1 cup of Italian breadcrumbs instead of bread slices and did not cook it in a meatloaf pan.  Instead, I shaped the meat into a loaf and used a 11x9 pan to bake it on.

This meatloaf is by far the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. I do not and never have liked any meatloaf I've ever tried, but I figured I would give this recipe a try since my husband loves meatloaf. I'm so glad I did because this is definitely going to be a weekly recipe in this house! Thanks All Recipes!

I didn't care for the sweetness of it. If you like sweet meats then this is for you. My picky son, who usually likes my meatloaf didn't like this. I thought I would try something new. Now I will just stick to my recipe.

I have not made meatloaf in years because I absolutely hate it! I made this in a mini muffin pan for 3 year olds and they loved it! I tried it and actually loved it too! The only thing I did different was I used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs, 1 lb. of meat and left everything else the same.

A really good recipe for meatloaf.  I added a little extra ketchup to the meat mixture and the glaze for more tomato flavor.

My boyfriend loved this meatloaf! I only used 1 1/2 pounds of the ground beef and mixed in 1/3 cup of the ketchup mixture into the meatloaf (I misread the recipe). This mixup made the meatloaf soooo moist and delicious! I don't cook often but will be making this recipe twice in one week with pressure from my boyfriend. Thanks!!!

I thought it was great!  VERY moist. I was afraid it would be a little too sweet for my husband but he said he actually liked the sauce.  Still, maybe a little less brown sugar next time.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was perfect.  Will make again.

Great simple recipe! I used packaged bread crumbs and skipped the bouillon, lemon juice and mustard powder my first time out because I didn't have any on hand.

Simply THE BEST meatloaf ever!  It is so moist and full of flavor.  I have to make double the sauce recipe because we always want extra to pour over the slices of meatloaf.  Meatloaf is a special dinner now!

This recipe is great! I loved it and it came out perfect. The only thing I did different was using 1 cup of Italian style bread crumbs and a dash of oregano.

OMG!!!!, the glaze is absolutely the best; and it's "multi-functional." I used the glaze with burgers on onion rolls or in lieu of cocktail sauce for shrimp; either way, it was amazing! Thanks for the recipe.

I could not make meatloaf until this recipe came along. I was even able to impress my mother in law. Great recipe. I did substitute for ground turkey and whole wheat bread instead, every one still loved it!

I've never met a meatloaf that I liked.  Until now.  This is awesome.  I used breadcrumbs and I put slices of bread on the bottom of the pan, as others suggested, to absorb the fat - worked great!  Also, I doubled the sauce (good plan there) and added a dash of hot sauce to it. This is definitely a keeper!

I agree with other comments and use 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of the bread. I also double the ketchup mixture part of this recipe - My husband loves the extra sauce on top! Thanks for the only meatloaf recipe I'll ever need!

this was really good. I didnt have much ketchup so I used tomato paste mixed with a bit of water. I took the advice of someone else and molded a loaf in cake pan, this allowed for the grease to poured off. Family of 7 loved it

Even the grandchildren that don't like meatloaf love this!! I left out the mustard (didn't have at the time) and added 1 pkg brown gravy mix.  Would give additional stars if they were available.

This was a big hit with hubby and our friends.  I used bread crumbs and added garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. We like onion a lot, so I used more of that. I also made more of the ketchup topping.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This was very good... a little different from your normal meatloaf.  My husband gave it 4 stars... I'd give it 5.  I think it might've tasted better to let it sit a little longer than I did.  The only difference I did was use almost a cup of crushed saltines instead of the bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this for around a year-once I found this recipe I stopped trying any other meatloafs.  It's so delicious!  My husband, children, and friends who have eaten it all love it.  I double the sauce so that we have plenty to slather on top, and sometimes use a mixture of ground beef and ground turkey.  I use regular mustard instead of the powder, breadcrumbs instead of bread, and leave out the beef bullion.  I also usually double the recipe (and then quadruple the glaze) so that I can put some in the freezer.  It freezes well, just put some plastic wrap over the meatloaf, not just foil or the sauce eats through the foil.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was really good, very moist. I followed other reviews and used bread crumbs instead of cubed bread, used vinegar in place of lemon as I had none on hand and spelnda brown sugar instead of regular. Next time I make this I will add less sugar, a little to sweet for us.

This meatloaf is just like my mom used to make - but better! My husband requests this meatloaf every time I do a meal plan for the upcoming weeks. I use one cup of seasoned dry bread crumbs in place of the bread. Delicious!

Great recipe.  I follow this recipe and occassionally add chopped green peppers and mushrooms for our personal tastes.  If you want a walking heart attack, when the hour of cooking is up, cut the center of the meat loaf out like a subway sandwich(kind of a wedge shape) and fill the opening with shredded cheddar cheese and Real bacon bits.  Place the center of meat back in place, add remaining ketchup glaze and bake until cheese is melted.  The center will naturally fall back in place when the cheese melts, so dont force it.  The only thing that would make this more coronary inducing would be to just deep fry it.  Enjoy.

Made this last night for company and it went over well. I didn't add the beef boullion but did use 1/2 lamb - great flavor. The glaze is really good. Would like to find out how to make more of a crust around the loaf like the meatloaf at one of our favorite restaurants. Would make again!

Oh goodness this was amazing! I followed the recipe as written EXCEPT I used some tips from other reviewers such as adding 1/2 package of onion soup mix to the beef and using about 32 Ritz crackers (one roll in a box) instead of bread or bread crumbs. Sooo GOOD! My fiance loved it as well as several people I let try it at work the next day. I used to think meatloaf was weird and gross, but not anymore!

Wow. This was amazing. I added grated carrots as well as grating the onion. I would follow what other reviews have said and heavily flavor the meat with additional spices (garlic powder, salt pepper, maybe some red chili flakes). The sauce itself was  a but sweet, but overall amazing. I was out of mustard powder so I added whole grain mustard. I also added garlic powder, sage, salt and pepper. I would definitely make this again!

This meatloaf recipe is awesome. It's moist and offers a real contrast in flavors--with the combination of the meat and the tang of the sauce. The sauce is especially good. I recommend increasing the sauce by 50% for dipping or adding to the sides of the meatloaf.  At the hour mark--when adding the sauce--I removed the meatloaf from the 5X9 pan into a casserole dish, for appearances sake. I wish I had made enough sauce to cover the sides and ends of the meatloaf. It's the tang of the sauce that makes this recipe.  My wife and son--both somewhat picky eaters--ate this and commented about how good it was.  This is a keeper!  Thanks, Delia.

I made this last night for my fiance and he's a chef...... we loved it. He said it was the best meatloaf he has ever had, and he is honest too!!! I did spice it up a bit... i added a little bit of tomato sauce in the meatloaf and garlic, basil, and more onion. Wonderful recipe.... will definatly make again! Thanks for posting this! 

Oh and for the people who found this recipe dry/bland, use a fattier meat, add a small can of tomato sauce to the loaf. wonderful recipe..... it didnt fall apart and i didnt even have a loaf pan lol, it was moist, and tons of flavor.

I worried about this recipe, considering so many people had so many mixed reviews. I read that it was not flavorful, it was dry, it was mushy, it was too sweet... etc. I am glad I stuck with my gut instinct and made the recipe anyway. 

Everyone in the family, including the 18 month old, loved this meatloaf. It was moist, it was deliciously flavorful and the glaze was deliciously sweet and tangy. I'm not even a real meatload person and I loved it. 

I doubled the recipe so I could have left-overs for the next week but they only stayed in there for 3 days since my husband and son kept bugging me about when they could have more meatloaf!! I will definitely make this recipe again - on a regular basis.

Made mini meatloaves.  Yummy!  Used bread crumbs, added chopped celery, and some BBQ sauce, and doubled the ketchup mix like others said.  Made 12 muffin tin meatloaves.  The kids loved it!

This was great.  I made a few great changes:  I fried some bacon, chopped it up and added it to the loaf.  I used half a cup more onion AND I sauteed and browned the onions in the bacon grease before adding it to the meatloaf.  I cooked it for 10 minutes less time.  Very moist and flavorful.  It's even good the next day in a sandwich.

I left out the egg, used less onion, and doubled the boulion and sauce. I run a high-school cooking club and tried this out. This was the first time everybody wanted the recipe. It goes great with pie!

Great recipe! Super easy & everyone loved it! I did make a few changes... I added 2 packages of Lipton's Onion Soup Mix (1 package for every pound of meat), only used 2 TB spoons of brown sugar, & used approx 20 crushed saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs.  This is the first time that I have ever made meatloaf & the only complaint was that there were no leftovers!

Our family really enjoyed this meatloaf. I didn't have enough ketchup so I used heinz 57 steak sauce to make up the 1/2 cup and it was great. I will do that again. The glaze is a bit sweet so be forewarned. All in all, I will make this again.

I used 1 lb hamburger & 1 lb spicy sausage - my husband loved the flavor. Also added more of the sauce to the meat mixture than the recipe called for. Placed some bacon on the top to give even more flavor.

Dear lord, this was amazing!  The best recipe off this site yet.  My husband hates meatloaf (and beef) so I used ground turkey and doubled the sauce.  We couldn't shovel it in fast enough!  Yum yum yum yum.

Made this with ground turkey & it was absolutely fabulous! This will be the ONLY way I make meatloaf from now on! I took everyone's advice and doubled the sauce & I am happy I did. Made meatloaf paninis the next day & they were to die for!!

I have made this recipe many times and every time it's just heavenly.  I usually make 2 or 3 times more sauce, because we can't get enough of it...it's too good to be just a glaze.  Everyone in my entire family loves it...even the ones who can't stand your usual meatloaf.

This was a very good tasting meatloaf however, it did not stay together when sliced.  I am not sure if it was too moist or whether another egg would help.  I would appreciate any comments.  Maybe I did something wrong.  The recipe I used previously cut into nice slices which was nice for sandwiches the next day but I did like the taste of this meatloaf.  Thanks :)

I had tried making a meatloaf before and it all fell apart.  Found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Turned out fabulous, my husband and all of his guy friends that was over loved it! No left over to spare! I had even double the recipe to feed 6 hungry men. It was yummy.

Thanks Delia for a wonderful recipe for meatloaf.  I did make a few changes.  I used a pound of ground meat and a pound of ground pork.  That made for a wonderful combination.  I think next time I will use 1/3 pork, 1/3 ground meat and 1/3 ground veal per suggestions from other suggestions on this site.  The changes are as follows:  Italian bread crumbs instead of bread; 2 eggs instead of one; worcestershire sauce instead of beef bouillon granules; Jack Daniels mustard instead of mustard powder.  I put the mustard in the meatloaf as well as the topping for the meatloaf; I used Lipton onion soup mix along with the chopped onions for more flavor; added parsley, Italian seasonings, oregano, basil to spice it up a little.  I did double the sauce because it was nice to be able to heat it up and put on the leftover meatloaf.

Not that this recipe needs another rating but it was awesome. I did the same as other reviewers and changed the bread for 3/4 cup Italian breadcrumbs, onion soup mix for the onion and real mustard instead of powder. Thanks for sharing!

This is so delicious! I wish I could give it 6 stars. Even if you do not usually like meatloaf, do try this recipe. I could not get over how good it was. Juicy, flavorful, and the sauce is so good, you'll want to put it on your cereal. I did use breadcrumbs instead of bread, but otherwise - this is a perfect meatloaf recipe.

Tried this exactly as written first, although the lemon juice and beef bouillon scared me a bit. I did double the sauce and was glad I did.  Was very good!  Update:  I can't tell you how many times I've made this and I ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.  It is the ONLY meatloaf I make now!  I do cut down on the sugar a bit but it is good as written.

Very good and very moist. Not a big fan of bread pieces in meatloaf so I used breadcrumbs instead and it worked wonderfully.

This meatloaf recipe is fantastic. I only changed it slightly. I used one piece of bread and 3/4 of a cup of seasoned bread crumbs. I upped the eggs to 2 and I didn't have boullion so, I used about 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. I let it cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes and I put it under the broiler for about 7 minutes. I also took the advice of others and made extra glaze. I'm glad I did. The glaze is one of the best parts. Thanks, Delia.

This meatloaf is outstanding.  Absolutely delicious.  Like many people, I had to make changes to the recipe based on what was in my cupboard.  I only had 1 lb. of ground beef, so I "stretched" it by adding half of a grated carrot and some chopped green pepper.  Because I didn't have enough beef, I also used only 2 slices of bread and 3 T of lemon juice.  I didn't have boullion granules, so I ground up two boullion cubes instead.  And despite all those changes, this is the best meatloaf I've ever had, and I can't wait to make it again.

This was very good and easy to make.  My husband had thirds!  My three year old enjoyed it as well.  I added some fresh garlic and a Lipton's Onion Soup packet to the meat mixture and voila!  Our new favorite meatloaf recipe!

I told my BF (who can cook darn well) I would make dinner tonight instead of him and started looking for a comfort food I could easily make.  This one was perfect.  The only changes I made were to use Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of diced onions, added Basil and doubled the sauce.  Sliced and placed in the middle of a ring of creamy mashed potatos, garnished with spring veggies and I think he's in love. ^^

This is the first time in my life that I have ever enjoyed meatloaf.  It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  It was very moist and sweet.  Great flavor!  I also doubled the sauce.

Wonderful meatloaf and the sauce is just so tastey. I made extra the next day to pour over the leftovers. I would make this for company!

My family rarely eats meatloaf but they loved this dish. I didn't have any mustard powder so I used a tablespoon of regular deli mustard instead. My picky 3 year old loved this dish the best and she even asked for seconds. It's a family favorite and I highly recommend it.

Fantastic. Best meat loaf I ever had. I did add some parsley to the meat and added a table spoon of BBQ to the Ketchup mix. Kick up a notch as he said. I could have done without the brown sugar but my wife loved it.

I thought it was absolutely delicious and my husband said he'd pass on it next time.  I loved everything about it except that next time I may cut back a little on the brown sugar.  I'm going to make a loaf for myself and vacuum pack it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried many different meatloaves, and most are too dry, or not enough flavor. But this recipe was delicious. It was perfect, my family or I did'nt have to add any ketchup or anything to it. It was a perfect flavor. And my 4 and 5 year old kids actually ate it. I did'nt have any mustard powder so I replaced it with mustard, and I did'nt have any onions. But everything else was ny the book. Thanks for a great meatloaf dinner. I will definetely be cooking it again.

Good but not our favorite from this site.  Served with mashed potatoes and garlic green beans from this site.  I did really like the glaze on top.  Just a note....1/15/06-did not really care for as leftovers which is unusual since I love meatloaf sandwiches.

Personaly, I thought it was darn good but my wife, who is a pickey eater, didn't care for it that much. She said it was good, but I can tell she likes hers better.  Anyway, I made it with only one change. I added some french onions. I would make again for myself but not for my wife...

This meatloaf was great and easy to do. I substituted ground beef, pork and veal, instead of just the beef. I believe it added flavor.

Excellent!! I have been reluctant to make meatloaf (my childhood was haunted by my mums meatloaf - a large dry over cooked mass) but this was great.  Rather than adding any of the glaze into the meatloaf itself (for fear of it turning out like my mum's) I added a third of a cup of b-b-q sauce, next time I will just make more glaze, as it was with all the glaze as a glaze it had run down the sides and gone tacky, it was fantastic!  Delia you have changed my mind about meatloaf, adn my husband thanks you.
p.s. the 2 year old loved it = a very happy mummy.

I've made this many times and have now perfected it with a few improvements. Cut the lemon juice by half, add 1 1/2 tsp. worcesteshire sauce, 1 extra egg, & 1/4 t. pepper to the meat mixture. Add 1/3 c. barbeque sauce and a dash of tabasco to the glaze mixture.

This recipe seems very basic, but is full of flavor.  I've tried many meatloaf recipes in my life and as easy as this recipe was to put together, I consider it to be a favorite.  My kids, who don't normally like meatloaf at all, cleaned their plates.  I did make some changes.  I increased the beef boullion cubes to 3, and I added 1/2 of a Lipton's Onion Soup mix, added 1/4 c. diced red bellpepper and put the sauce on the meat at the start of cooking.

Try this one, you shouldn't be disappointed.

This is an excellent meatloaf. I just made it last night, and accidentally ended up putting the whole sauce mixture into the beef mix. The end result made it a tad crumbly, but it was still tasty as ever. I also added a little bit of pepper to the mix, and I'm sure that green peppers would be good in there too. I have served this with both garlic mashed potatoes, and then last night with peppered green beans. This was a very easy, quick dinner!

I'm not a huge meatloaf fan but this was fantastic. I took someone's advice and made more sauce.  I also used bread crumbs instead of bread and cut down on the brown sugar.  I added garlic and green pepper.  Delicious!

I made this last night and it is very good for a change! My husband and 3 year old gobbled it up. I wanted to use bread crumbs, but didn't have any on hand, so I just used 4 pieces of bread. I did not have beef boullion, so I opened a pack of Lipton onion & garlic. I did not use the whole pack, just kinda eyed what I thought looked right. Instead of using a loaf pan, I shaped it into a loaf and put in a baking dish. I did put the topping on and in the loaf mixture, and then made another batch of the topping to put on in the last 10 minutes. I will make it again.

Meatloaf is either GREAT or AWFUL! Unfortunately most recipes are awful. This one is FANTASTIC! My husband wasn't all that excited about me making meatloaf, but he loved this. The glaze is to die for! I did triple the sauce in order to have extra for dipping. I used 1 cup bread crumbs instead of bread for ease. I did cut the brown sugar down to 3 Tablespoons (not tripling). I added 2 cloves of garlic and salt and pepper. I will make this often. My husband even ate leftovers the next day and he never does that.

This recipe was good but not as good as I had expected it. Changes Made was 1 package of onion gravy mix instead of the beef bouillon granules and onions. Maybe that is why it was not as good as I expected. I thought the meat was a little bland(not beefy enough) and the topping was a bit to sweet.

IMO, if there ever was a "perfect" meatloaf, this is it! We loved it. My husband had 3rds! I used 1/4 cup brown sugar packed and it had just the right amount of sweetness. I served it with mashed potatoes (from scratch) and a plate of fresh raw veggies. This will be a repeat, for sure!

Great tasting meatloaf with few ingredients.  I might add a little green pepper next time.  My husband says he still likes "my" meatloaf but I like this recipe better, especially the sauce.

This was a pretty good meatloaf. My parents both liked it, especially my father.  Personally, I thought it was just a touch too sweet. I probably won't make it again since I have my own way of making meatloaf that I like better, but I'm glad I tried this one and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have his or her own recipe yet. Or, if you have made meatloaf before but want to try something new, definitely give this one a whirl.

This is an excellent meatloaf. I used one pound ground beef and one pound
ground turkey. Next time I'll follow the recipe and use all beef.  I think the texture 
was a bit soft with the turkey.  The only other change I made was that I added a 
generous amount of finely chopped garlic which I'll continue to do. Also, I did
double the amount of glaze.  Thanks Delia for sharing your delicious recipe.

WOW! This recipe was great!  I did add a little fresh garlic to the meat and made one and a half times the sweet and sour mixture.  It was the best meatloaf I've ever had.  My husband couldn't get enough of it.  Quick to prepare and tastes great.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

The glaze was good.  I have to make some extra for the meatloaf.  The meatloaf itself did not maintain its shape well.  I had too much (or too little) ingredients?

This is the BEST meat loaf I have ever had.  I LOVE it!!!  My two year old even ate it. I used to hate meat loaf so it's saying something that I like this.  It was also easy to make.

I have made this recipe for about a year and after looking for new ones and trying different ones, I keep coming back for this one!  It is moist, tangy and delicious (I make extra sauce so there is plenty for potatoes) and my picky 3 year-old gobbles it up!

Yummy-yum-yum.  My family loved this recipe.  My husband said, "You ARE keeping this recipe, right???".  My 13 year old daughter really liked it also.  It was easy to make and very moist.  I made the recipe as is.  I will make this meatloaf again...and again.....and again......

The glaze for this meatloaf is wonderful and I've used it about 4 times. However I now use it with my old recipe for the actual meatloaf itself -which is basically 1 1/2 lb ground beef to 1/2 lb ground pork, dry onion soup mix, chopped onions and garlic, an egg and a couple slice of fresh bread or 1/2 c. of Minute rice.

Good base recipe for a moist meatloaf but quite bland however.  Needs one or several of the following added for some zip - garlic, steak spice, worchesterchire sauce, hot sauce, salt, pepper. Same recipe as glazed meatloaf II.

I am a 23-year-old who just started cooking "homemade" meals instead of "college-dorm" meals.  I made this meatloaf for three guests, and it came out delicious!  It was relatively quick and easy.  Even I was surprised that I can make such a great dish!  I added red bell peppers, and it added a nice kick.

Great! Didn't have all the ingredients so I used 3/4 Gr Beef and 1/2 Gr Pork, used about 1-2 Tbsp of regular mustard (Heinz Dark)and about (more or less) 1/4 C of Beef Au Jus Gravy (from the jar prepared)and a little shake of Thyme. Was really good, I didn't have time for the glaze, I have made a meatloaf glaze already so I know how good this glaze would be. This is a winner for me. Thanks

This was very tasty.  A nice sweet meatloaf with a touch of tang. Even my daughter who hates meatloaf enjoyed this. I did add some finely chopped celery and green peppers to my meatloaf mix and made a brown gravy to go on top. Yum

The taste was good, especially after I added half a package of onion soup mix but I wasn't happy with the consistency. I want a meatloaf that doesn't fall apart when I try to cut it or take it out of the pan.

This is really good with ground pork. Add a pkg. of Lipton onion soup mix and occasionally use Lime juice if I am out of Lemon. I add a few more slices of bread too.

Im going to assume since I barely had a slice that this meatloaf was delicious, I know the sauce was very savory but I was only able to fork a corner of the meatloaf since I usually eat what I cook the following day, but when I woke up the next morning I only saw an empty pan with a little residue leftover from the sauce, which looked like it had been sopped with a slice of the last of what I assume was my glazed meatloaf.  I going to assume that it was a hit...next time im tripling this recipe!!

This recipe has been made NUMEROUS times in our home. My husband asks for it constantly, and isn't a lover of meatloaf. It's DELICIOUS! I've changed a few things after reading some comments, and have never made it the exact same as the recipe. I got rid of the bouillon/lemon juice in the meat itself and added 1 can of tomato sauce/garlic salt/ground mustard/brown sugar. Make extra Sauce for the top (this never makes enough). It's delectable!

Excellent!  I had 3# of meat so increased proportions.  Made fresh bread crumbs from some stale kaiser rolls so I winged it there.  Doubled sauce but only used 1 1/2 tsp dry mustard.  We loved it.

Great recipe! The hubby said it was the best one I have made!  Here are a few alterations I made:  Used 1 cup low sodium ritz crackers crushed, equal parts yellow mustard instead of mustard powder...first time around it did not use brown sugar by accident. Was great without it!

This is my family's favorite meatloaf recipe.  I got it from ARecipe's site several years ago and it's become a classic in the family.  If I don't have an onion or bread available, I use a heavy 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs - and I often use a pkg of onion soup mix if there isn't a onion to be found.   I always double the recipe and freeze a loaf - and I never forget to make extra sauce. Excellent, Excellent!

Great meatloaf, I cook for 50 minutes then add the ketchup mixture on top for 10 more minutes instead of the 1hr 10 minutes so it doesn't dry out it was great the second time I did it with less time

Wonderful! This was my first time making meatloaf so I was a little nervous. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! Very moist, flavorful and didn't flake apart like other meatloaf I've had. Sorry Mom, but I would have to say that "MY" meatloaf is now better than yours! Can't wait to make this again!

I'd never made meatloaf before because it wasn't a favorite growing up, but the glaze really improves the dish. The lemon juice took it to another level, really brightening the taste. We also liked the bread bits instead of crumbs because it was moister. Next time I'll make more glaze and put more into the meat mixture because the meat part was a little bland.

Really good...for meatloaf :) the glaze makes ALL the difference for us. My son will even eat this.  Followed the recipe exactly. Do make extra glaze for dipping. 

Thanks for sharing.

I grew up LOVING meatloaf and my Dad was great at just winging it and always making a delicious one. I tried this recipe last week and absolutely loved it! The only thing I didn't add was the beef boullion, instead I put in a bit of worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and onion powder.  The glaze is perfect! It wasn't dry as some meatloaf tends to be.  It is so simple to make, I will definitely be doing it often.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe! :)

This is the absolute best meatloaf we have ever, ever had - and I mean exactly as is, no tweaks. My daughter, 3 years old and no interest in dinner, actually sat herself down and ate with us after one attempted run-by bite from the table. The husband Facebooked about it. Ha! Going permanently in our recipe box, and we decided we can't wait two weeks, it is going on the menu in place of something next week. There were no leftovers.

I volunteer at a local hospice cooking once a week for the residents. I made this meatloaf today with twice baked potatoes and a banana cream pie. My mother never made a glaze on meatloaf but I know most people find it essential so I made this. It is really, really good! The glaze really makes it delicious. One resident doesn't like onions so I used onion powder and garlic powder. I omitted the bouillon granules but added some Worcestershire sauce and some pepper. It is very good and I will be making it again and again for my family. I know my little girls will like it. Thank you, Delia. Well done!

This recipe is great. I am not a fan of meatloaf, but when I tried this it was a hit. My Husband loved it! I substitute bread crumbs for the bread cubes. Mushy bread is not a good thing in my house. I also make double the ketchup sauce because a little extra is good to have when reheating the next day.

Good Recipe. I use half ketchup and half bbq sauce for a yummy sticky glaze. If you use honey bbq or bbq with brown sugar you can cut the brown sugar in the recipe to maybe only 1 tbspn if not out completely.

This was a very good meatloaf.  Used bread crumbs instead of bread as per reviews.  Also added 1/2 cup finely chopped green pepper and 1/2 pkt brown gravy mix instead of beef boullion granules.  Will definitely make again.

This was great meatloaf. I've never been a fan of meatloaf (I'm thinking because my Mom's never tasted this good =) but my husband wanted some so I decided to try this. I followed the recipe, except changing the brown sugar to only 2 tbsp as others noted. And, I mixed 1 lb beef w/ 1 lb ground turkey. It turned out fantastic. My husband said it's a definite "redo."  My only comment is that I thought it could use some more spices - but my husband is begging me not to mess with a good recipe.

This meatloaf was indeed very moist, almost to the point of being "meat-mush".  I followed exact recipe, hate when people change things then make a bad review.  Found glaze much too sweet.  Perhaps I should have added more acid, vinegar or more lemon than recipe called for.  Not my favorite, both my husband and my daughter agreed.  Won't be making this again.

Yummy, I'm sitting at my computer eating this meat loaf right this very second.  I used Japanese breadcrumbs instead of bread, and used a cup of frozen chef's blend that I ran through the food processor instead of just plain onion.  I also used a can of tomato past for the meat loaf but I used ketchup for the glaze.    Also put in some Ms. Dash, Paprika, and Garlic Powder.  Loving it.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe.  The tangy glaze is wonderful and the meat ends up more tender than normal.  The recipe is great as is, but we like it even better using meatloaf mix instead of ground beef.

This was ok, nothing that made me skirt fly up. Next time I think I will subsitute crackers over bread crumbs....the texture was too....fluffy? and the flavor was a little bland.

I have made this quite a few times.  I double the sauce and I use bread crumbs... but it comes out moist and delicious.  I also started making them in muffin pans as mini meatloafs for the kids and they still come out perrfect!  Great recipe!!

I think this is the best meatloaf I've ever made.  This will be my "standard" for meatloaf in the future.

This recipe is supper yummy!  It is also great with ground turkey breast.  When I am in a pinch, I replace the bouillon and onion with powdered onion soup mix.

I joined allrecipes.com just to rate this awesome meatloaf! My husband has never liked meatloaf and he LOVED this!! Thank you for the wonderful and easy recipe..... I doubled the sauce and used bread crumbs instead of bread and it was great!

Really good but a bit blander than I like. The 2nd time around I swapped out the bread for 1c seasoned bread crumbs, swapped the egg for cheese and chive egg substitute, swapped 1/2 of the ground beef for ground turkey (to make it a bit healthier) and added a dash of garlic powder. The glaze should be doubled but is absolutely scrumptious!  Give this a try -- it is tasty!!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Everything about this meatloaf is good.  Very moist and flavorful, not too sweet.  When it comes to meatloaf Hubby says "This is number 1!"

This is a great meatloaf! I used 93/7 lean ground beef and formed the loaf using a loaf pan but turned it out on a cooling grid placed in a baking sheet so while the meatloaf baked, excess fat drained off.  It was great!  The sweet glaze was really tasty but I do think I will cut back on the brown sugar in it next time.  Oh, and I used beef base in place of bouillon because I do not like the ingredients in bouillon.  Definitely a keeper!  :)

I loved this recipe.  I did some slight modifications which brought it to a strong 5 star recipe.  I did not have any lemon juice, so I sprinkled some dry lemon zest seasoning in the mix, added mustard instead of mustard powder, finely chopped 1/2 green and 1/2 orange bell pepper to add veggies, and doubled the sauce amount inside and out.  Very very delicious!!  Will use this recipe every time.

Meat was very moist but did not have much flavor.  Sauce was tasty.  Husband liked it more than I did which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3.  Not sure if I will make again.

Pretty good!  Followed others' advice and only added barely 2 tbsp. brown sugar to the glaze mix, then kicked it up with some oregano and basil and a dash of chili powder.  To the meatloaf mixture I added a dash of A-1 sauce, some garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper, and used italian breadcrumbs instead of the bread.  Using about 1 cup and a couple of tbsp. of breadcrumbs produced a pretty good consistency in the meatloaf.  Also, 1 hour and ten minutes cooking time like the recipe calls for was just fine.  Pretty tasty!

I really liked this, but instead of using pieces of bread I used bread crumbs instead and substituted the last ingredient with garlic powder and spices. It came out wonderful.

I enjoyed the topping on this meatloaf, usually I just use ketchup, so a nice change.  I add tomato soup to my meatloaf, but never thought to add a boulion cube! Very good...

THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST MEATLOAF RECIPE!!

I have never found a meat loaf recipe that I liked before.  I've tried everyone's "special" recipe and still never found one liked.  

I had two helpings the first night and even ate the left overs the next day!

This was pretty good meatloaf. We didnt have any lemon juice, so after reading reviews, I used vinegar instead. We also had no onions, so I used minced onion instead. Only thing I would do next time, is save the sauce you put on top, would have loved to have more of it!

This is a great recipe to use as a guideline.  I love the tangy/sweet sauce and like that it uses bread, not packaged breadcrumbs (which I never buy).  I don't use the bouillon granules.  Sometimes I add either green pepper or scallions.  One thing I always do is use 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound sausage, which really gives the meatloaf a fantastic flavor and texture.  If you're a fan of rosemary, the addition of this herb really brings the recipe to entirely different level.  My boyfriend and I love it!

My husband LOVED this. I replaced the mustard powder with a tablespoon of wholegrain mustard and cut the sugar down to a quarter of a cup. I also replaced the bread with cornflakes crumbs and included one large grated carrot and some chopped spinach. I actually found this dish moist and delicious even though I'm not usually a meatloaf fan.

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written except took 3 slices of bread out from the freezer, toasted them, then ran them through the food processor to make homemade breadcrumbs. I did add some garlic powder and still thought it was a bit bland. The glaze was perfect and the meatloaf was not soggy at all. I will make this again with the addition of more garlic powder and a bit of worcestershire. Thanks for a good base meatloaf recipe.

This was great meatloaf! I like that in using beef bouillon you are reducing the sodium by a TON compared to using Lipton onion soup mix (like I usually do). The only thing I would do different is make more sauce for dipping because it's so good!

wowwww!!! what a wonderful taste blend. My boyfriend is the hardest person to satify. He stills thinks no cooking is better than is mothers (like all guys) and I have made this twice and he LOVES this and he request this meat-loaf. The meat is juicy and the SAUCE IS TO DIE FOR. i reduced the amount of sugar just a bit, but other than that this is the best meatloaf ever.

The first time I made this meatloaf, it disappeared almost immediately -- AND THERE WERE ONLY 3 OF US.  I did make some changes.  I substitute 1 cup of italian breadcrumbs, add 1-2 fresh garlic cloves, and add about 1/4 - 1/3 of a cup of Worcestershire Sauce. SO DELICIOUS!!!! I serve it with a side of peas.

My children did not like the sweetness of the brown sugar (and they love sugar).  So I rate this 3 stars b/c the children would not eat it. I'm not a fan of meatloaf.  Was easy to prepare.

This is a very good meatloaf that I will be making again.  I prefer the stuffed meatloaf recipe from this site, but this is something a little different because of the sweetness from the topping.  My husband really liked it and we will be making this one again.

My picky husband even loved this! I used turkey meat and cooked it on a cookie sheet like I read in one review, which worked very well. The meat needed a little more seasoning, so I'll take the advice of other reviews next time and use the onion soup mix. Great recipe!

This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever made. The flavor was excellent and my husband who rarely likes meatloaf loved it.  I made a little extra glaze because he likes a lot.  Overall this was simple and delicious.

This was such a easy and inexpensive recipe.  Both my son and boyfriend loved it! Like the other reviews recommended, I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of bread slices.  I will definately make this again soon.

I LOVED this meatloaf. I really am not a big fan of meatloaf, but my husband liked his moms recipe, so I figured I'd try this one out because of the rave reviews.

Im so glad I did! He said it was better then hers!

I ended up doubling it and making 2 loafs to feed my husbands family as well. They all loved it! I served it with the corn cassarole recipe I found on here, yum!

 Things I changed: I took another readers advice and used a tube of crushed Ritz, and couldnt find boullion granules, so didnt put that in. We dont like onions, so I just put half a packet of onion soup mix in (thanks to those who recommended that!). But even that made it a little 'onioney' to me, but no one else. :shrug:
I also only had lime juice on hand, so used that instead of lemon, didn't notice a difference. 

The top glaze is what MAKES this meatloaf, but if you aren't into sweets you might want to reduce the sugar, my husband scraped a lot of it off on his second piece, lol. I cooked it for nearly the 10 mins, then turned the broiler on high for the last few mins to get it a little carmeley, but watch it close!!

Hope this was helpful!

I made this meatloaf for supper and it was delicious.  I did add a little extra ketchup to the sauce mix to make it a little saucier, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  YUM!  It is great with Home-Style Scalloped Potatoes which can also be found on this site.

Excellent recipe. I made meatloaf once in the past. It turned out to be hard and dry. I thought I would never be able to make a good meatloaf... until I came across this recipe. I followed the recipe except that I don't have gound mustard on hand so I used good old yellow mustard instead. The meatloaf was moist and tasty. The glaze was so delicious. My family absolutely love this dish. And I am really surprised how easy it is to make. I will definately make it again and again.

Best. Meatloaf. Ever.  This was delicious.  Like others, I used a cup of breadcrumbs because I didn't fancy having big pieces of bread in there.  Also, I had way too much glaze left over to up on top of it, so next time I will put 2/3 in the mix, and only leave 1/3 to glaze with.  Both of my kids asked for seconds (which rarely happens!)

We used ground turkey and chicken bouillon, and tossed in some chopped green pepper. It turned out really well! A good, stand-by, traditional recipe!

My ten year old asked me what meatloaf was so I decided on this recipe...I never enjoyed it as a kid.  This recipe was good and I would do it again.  I didn't have any form of lemon....so I used vinegar..didn't have powdered mustard so I used real mustard....doubled the sauce recipe as suggested and used breadcrumbs rather than bread.  Really enjoyed the sweet and sour of the sauce.

I never thought that meatloaf using such simple ingredients could taste sooo good. I added salt and pepper and garlic salt, and formed it into a loaf on a cookie sheet( like bobby flay says to do) instead of a baking dish, I don't like when the juices collect in the dish. It tastes like I'm eating a good burger using regular instead of toasted bread is the key in my opinion. Thank You sooo much for sharing this recipe!

I had never made meatloaf before this...actually, I had never eaten meat loaf before this!  It's one of those meals that gets a bad reputation, but when my husband requested it, I decided on this recipe.  I was actually pretty impressed with the taste!  It was easy as can be to throw together, all I added extra was a little milk.  The leftovers seemed a little dry, so extra sauce might be nice there.  Will definitely make again!

this is a good, simple recipe. in my opinion, you really must flavor the meat more than listed. i added salt, pepper, garlic, some A1. i thought there was plenty of sauce. my five-year-old, traditionally one of the most picky of pre-schoolers, ate a whole piece without being nagged at all. ***** i had to go back and give 5 stars instead of 4. i've made this several times now, and although i still think the meat needs to be seasoned more first, my son and husband love it and eat it all almost the first night -- few leftovers. it has become a family staple. you can't beat that.

This recipe was awesome. Due to some early childhood experiences (soggy meatloaf I was made to eat... ick) I have never liked meatloaf. However, I went to my inlaws and my MIL made one that was great. SO I thought I would try my hand at it. I did everything the recipe called for and added basil, oregano, 2 cloves garlic, and Lowry's season salt to the meat. THIS RECIPE WAS KILLER. I made it in the Pampered Chef mini loaf pan so instead of one large loaf we had 4 smaller. My hubby ate one by himself! We can eat the rest tomorrow night or freeze it. Thank you so much this is a treasure!

Excellent flavour and easy to make.  Four stars instead of five only because I had trouble with the time (meat not fully cooked in time recommended), although that most likely was my fault.  Great recipe!

This was wonderful.  I halved the recipe as I was only using 1lb of ground beef, I also wanted to make additional sauce as other reviewers suggested but of course I used the last drop of ketchup! I also had to use a boullion cube disovled in about 1/4 cup water.  The meatloaf itself came out very very moist and flavorful.  It had a nice flavor, with not a single ingredient that stuck out...they all flowed well together.  My b/f also enjoyed it.  The sauce was very tastey and had I had the ketchup I would have made more.  I do suggest to make a little extra sauce.  I will be making this again.

I've only had meatloaf twice, and the first time I had it I fell in love with it. After trying this recipe, I wondered why people like it so much. It was very dry and hardy, and it was only good if I put lots of extra ketchup on it. Then again, this might be what meatloaf really tastes like.

I haven't made meatloaf in a long time (just re-learning to cook) but my husband said he really enjoyed it, especially the 2nd and 3rd day.  He said the glaze was too much (I made a double batch as suggested), next time I will make it without the glaze.

I did change a few things in this recipe.  I used bread crumbs instead of the pieces of bread.  I added garlic and shredded carrots to the meatloaf.  Very yummy.

This recipe was SOOOO good!  I've never made meatloaf before because my husband hates it.  I decided to give this one a shot.  I used bread crumbs instead of the bread pieces, and the 2 lbs. of ground beef fit perfectly into a 12-cup muffin tin!  My husband had 3 "mini loaves" for dinner!  He LOVES it and so does my daughter, so isn't a big meat eater!  The ketchup topping makes this recipe so great, so I agree with the other reviewers who made extra.  It's delicious!!

I've been trying to make a better meatloaf for a couple of years now. I finally found a recipe that my family loves! We loved this recipe. It was moist, full of taste and so easy that even I got it right! I would definitely follow some of the other suggestions and use bread crumbs instead. I also made a little extra sauce to pour over the meatloaf since I used more in the actual loaf when baking. I loved it, thank you!

I had left over hamburger meat already seasoned with steak seasoning, salt, pepper, onions, garlic, worsteshire and italian seasoning.  All I did was add some of the ketchup sauce and I used 1 cup of oatmeal instead of the bread.  The meatloaf was absolutely to die for!

YUM YUM YUM!  That is all I can say.  I love to cook, but for some reason I've never really made a good meat loaf.  So based on the reviews, I decided to try my hand at this one. I made meatloaf muffins at the last minute instead of the loaf because I don't have a loaf pan (couldn't believe it!  Ha ha)  I made 12 muffins and baked them for 30 min, then added the sauce and baked them additional 10 min.  I doubled the sauce recipe based on other peoples reviews, and maybe it was because I made muffins, but I had a ton left over.  So I won't double again, but you better believe I'll be making this recipe a bunch in the futre!  My seven yr old daughter ate THREE of the muffins!  Thanks for sharing!  This is at the top of the rotation.

I only gave this 3 stars because the flavor of the meat was good, but the glaze was very sweet. Too sweet for meat loaf.

A very good basic meatloaf. My only problem was the glaze. Too sweet and tangy, but not in a good way. It overpowered the meatloaf. Most people raved about the glaze, so I kinda wondered about that. I have come to the conclusion that it's a midwestern thing.

I really liked the seasoning with this recipe. I flatened the meat out before baking and rolled Mozzerella cheese and garlic powder into the middle of the meatloaf. Making it a stuffed meatloaf..

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband said he liked another recipe a that I've made a little better, but he still said it was really good.  I think the sauce made this recipe.  I used bread crumbs as others have said they used, but I didn't have a full cup so I used a few crackers to make up for what I was missing.  I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added more onions than called for.  If I make this again I think I will add even more onions to it though.  Overall, I think this was great!

I use a half recipe for this and pat it into a loaf shape and bake it in a casserole dish.  Making a half recipe is just right for our family for one meal with no leftovers.  I still bake at 350 for an hour (probably overkill, but I'm paranoid about undercooked meat).  It isn't dry at all and worked well.

I've also made these quicker if I'm short on time by raising the oven temp to 400, dividing the meat into a muffin tin and baking for 25-30 minutes.

This was very good.  The glaze was delicious.  I used finely ground saltine cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs a
mixture of 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground turkey.  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

After seeing so many great reviews, I figured I couldn't go wrong with this - and I was right. I used 1.5 lb of ground chicken and one cup of breadcrumbs instead of the bread slices. The whole family loved it.

A regular family favorite, I make mini-meatloaves and cook them in a muffin tin at 375 for 30 minutes or so, the kids love having their own individual meatloaf and is ready by the time your mashed potatoes are done.

I was not up for doing anything complicated, and this recipe fit the bill. VERY simple, very tasty, and I'm sure it's going to make great sandwiches. The only changes I made were for what I had on hand: whole wheat bread for the bread, and mustard instead of mustard powder. The glaze was really tasty, and the bread kept the meatloaf very moist.

ETA:  Made this again, and I can't rave enough - makes FABULOUS cold sandwiches the next day.

I grew up hating meatloaf but my boyfriend loves  it so I set out to find a recipe that we would both like.  This one is perfect.  Great taste, very moist and easy.  I also added in some peppers and mushrooms.

fabulous, i love meatloaf and this was delicious, everyone enjoyed it. I used seven grain bread and an extra half an egg with some ritz crackers(about 10). The glaze is amazing and my son wanted to put it on his potatoes as well.

My husband would never eat meatloaf before I made him this recipe.  Now he asks for it regularly.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than to eliminate the onions.  I would highly recommend this recipe!

I originallly rated this in 2006, and it has been the only meatloaf I've made since trying this. One thing I'd like to note, is that if you are using anything lower in fat than 85/15 (ie: 93, 95, etc.) it's important to drastically reduce the cooking time. I've recently started using 93% due to a good deal on it, and I've reduced the cooking time to 40 mins. Just a thought....

I liked your idea for glaze. It was a tad bit too sweet for me, but my husband and our guests did like it that sweet. I think next time I'll put in a little less sugar. Thank you for a great recipe, we give it 5 stars!

This recipe tastes ok, but definitely not the greatest.  I'm not the greatest at thinking up recipes, but something is really wrong with this one.  I've tried this recipe three times, and everytime everyone who ate it got some killer heartburn!  I'm moving on.  I love meatloaf, but this recipe just isn't the one.

Excellent meatloaf! It was a lot sweeter than I'm used to. So, I may slightly reduce the brownsugar next time, but overall very tasty. I also added diced green peppers and Italian seasoning for added flavor

I like tangy foods so I like this recipe but the other people that ate it thought that the sweet and sour flavor was to strong.  They also thought that the lemon juice was a bit much.  Per other reviews I used about 1 cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of broken up bread.  I substituted one packet of onion soup for the chopped onion and beef bouillon.  I doubled the sauce but did not double the amount of lemon juice added to the meat (added 3 tablespoons to meat).  I only added about 1/3 cup of sauce to the meat.  Also added cubes of cheese before cooking.

I made this twice. The first time I made it exactly as called.. give or take. I found the sauce a bit ketchupy and the meatloaf a little bland. The second time I made it, I didn't add the beef boullion and instead I used a package of (I think it was) Clubhouse Meatloaf Seasoning. It really spiced up the meatloaf itself. I will definitely make it again, but use the pre-packaged seasoning.

Used half turkey and half beef, bread crumbs instead of bread, and dijon mustard instead of powdered. Moist and delicious. Double the sauce!

Delicious!  I HATED meatloaf as a kid but was feeling like I should give it another shot and I'm so glad I did - a definite winner.  The only changes I made was using 3/4 cup italian flavored bread crumbs instead of the 3 slices bread, and eliminated the onions.  I also put all the lemon juice in the sauce by accident, but it still turned out great and I may do it that way again next time!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful recipe. This will be my meatloaf for the forseeable future! I did what another reviewer did and used one slice of bread and 3/4 c breadcrumbs. The glaze is delicious and I will use it on other ground turkey or beef recipes. YUM!

This was surprising good.  BUT as usual, I  didn't think there were enough spices in the meatloaf portion of the recipe, so I vamped it up a bit with some chopped garlic, onion powder, basil, & oregeno.  Besides that, the main part of the recipe, THE GLAZE, was what made it.  Tasted great, didn't burn or get too "sticky sweet"....well done!

I made this meatloaf last night for the first time. I followed the recipe exactly and I dare to say that this was the best meatloaf I have ever tasted!
It had a delicious sweet/sour taste and unlike other meatloaves I have tried, it did NOT need loads of ketchup after cooking. Not bland at all. Just plain yummy! It is a keeper! Thanks Delia!

YUM!!!  This is so good!  I only changed a couple of things: I substituted Lipton Onion Soup Mix for the chopped onion and doubled the quantity of the glaze.  I will definitely make again and again!

Very very good.  I added two cups of corn flakes instead of the bread and it turn out great.  I would make this change if you have corn flakes around the house.  I also topped with a bit of pepper.

We like the Remple Family Meatloaf, but never seem to have Ritz crackers that go in it so I tried this one. 
I really liked this and so did my husband. It was a very firm meatloaf and didn't fall apart when I placed a piece on a plate. My mother's always fell apart and she never seemed to use a glaze so this is way better than hers. We liked the glaze...not too sweet...just right.
Will make again!

This is wonderful. I usually mix a double batch, freeze one loaf for baking later. It turns out great each time.

The directions were easy to follow and the family loved it. It was the first time my son at my meatloaf without ketcup. This was a high honor. I family doesn't like a lot of onions so I think I will replace the onions with a little garlic and pepper next time to add some seasoning. The glaze can't be improved. It was the best part!

This was delicious!  The only things I did different were I added some Tony Chachere's seasoning and pepper.  I think next time I'll add a little garlic powder, too.  And I put more onion in than called for because I like the taste.  I didn't have enough lemon for the meatloaf mixture, so I used rice vinegar.  It's all I had at the time.  It still turned out very good.  I didn't think it had too much brown sugar.  You may want to make sure you use the light brown sugar, though, if you don't want it to come out too sweet.  You may even be able to use a combo of meats, like 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground pork or veal.  It thought about trying that out somtime.  I was worried that my picky husband would not like it because it's so different from the norm, but he LOVED it!  We will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

The glaze really makes this meatloaf, I doubled the glaze recipe as well.  I thought the meatloaf itself was a bit bland and was missing something.

OMG this is good!  Would probably be better if I had had all the ingredients listed, I substituted...Dijon mustard for powdered mustard,  apple cidar for lemon juice and onion soup mix for beef broth granules.  Next trip to the grocery store will replenish my pantry, and I'll make this meatloaf again.

This meatloaf was tasty.  The glaze is super sweet and I substituted Splenda brown sugar (2 TBSP) instead of regular brown sugar.  Also, I used a 95/5 lean hamburger meat... Very little fat to drain.  Reduced cooking time to 40 mins.  Would definately make again.

Very good flavor and texture. Juicy and delicious. I substituted the mustard powder for a tablespoon of actual mustard, 2 eggs, and equal parts bell pepper and onion and used 3lbs of hamburger. I baked an extra 20 minutes. Turned out great!

This was truly fantastic. I made a large amount and froze one portion to keep for dinner on another night. Then I just made some more of the glaze and I had another meatloaf dinner ready. Don't be shy when adding the glaze at the end. This is what gives it such a nice flavour. Thank you for another wonderful meal idea.

I am not a meat eater, but my husband is. I have been trying different meatloaves and he hasn't been thrilled. This one he said is a keeper. He prefers simple foods and I am guessing that is why he likes this one. It has no unusual ingredients. The only thing I changed, was to use 3/4 cup seasoned breadcrumbs in place of the bread.  My husband says thanks for a great recipe.

This was by far the best meatloaf I've had. I doubled up on the glaze as a few reviewers suggested. The only thing with doubling it was that it ended up a bit too sweet. Next time I will double the glaze but maybe only use 3/4 cup brown sugar rather than doubling it completely.

I was very disappointed in this meatloaf after reading about how great it was and making it last night for dinner.  It was soggy and that grossed me out, which made me lose my appetite.  The bread pieces is what I think made the meatloaf so soggy (and believe me, there is a difference between moist and yummy, and soggy and gross).  I wonder if I had substituted crushed crackers instead or just left that part out altogether if it would've turned out better.  It would've been good, had it not been so squishy and soggy.

My kids always want my husband to make meatloaf, because they don't like mine.   I made this recipe the other day, and I was then overwhelmed with GREATNESS!  I only made a half batch (cooked it about 25 minutes with a meat thermometer to 160*) then added the same amount of sauce and cooked it 10 minutes more.  THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE! THANKS!

I made this using 1 lb ground turkey, and 1 lb ground beef (lean).  I used bread crumbs (no sliced bread) and no bouillon granules....I  used spices. I DID however make the glaze...it was awesome and enjoyed by the whole family.  A nice twist on meatloaf.  I'll probably make it this way from now on.  :)

Very tasty, indeed!  I didn't have any bouillon, so I added some worcestershire sauce and Italian bread crumbs in place of sliced bread.     The glaze is the best.

YUMMY!!  My entire family liked it (even my 5 yr old that doesn't like hamburger).  The only thing I changed in the recipe was substituting honey (1/4 cup) for the brown sugar.

Easy and tasty meatloaf.  I used a packet of onion soup mix, so didn't add the bouillion granules.  Still, it was too salty, so next time I'll just use half a packet.  Didn't add lemon juice either.  And for leaner meatloaf, I used 99% fat free ground turkey breast and it was very very good.  I only used 1.1 lbs of ground turkey, but left the other measurements alone, and it turned out fine.  I used a hearty nut and seed hearty bread for the crumbs, and the texture was very nice.  Easy, tasty, and pretty healthy.

Yum!  I have just found this site and this was the first thing I made off it.  I have been trying to teach my four year old that there is more to life than meatballs (those are my favourite, Mom!) and this fit the bill perfectly.

OK... I have to hand it to you. This was AWESOME!!! I was NEVER a big fan of meatloaf. I used to hate it everytime my mother made it, because it was always so heavy. But now that I have a little one of my own and my husband is from Poland, I had to get creative. By accident I added curry powder instead of mustard powder and wow... it was good. Will definitely make this for years to come. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious meatloaf, but the lemon flavour was a bit overpowering.  Would make again, but reduce the amount of lemon juice.

My family loved it...a first.  I had to use 1.25lbs of ground turkey and a lime marinade instead of the lemon juice, also I didn't use the onion...we were out.  It was still quite good and very easy.

Easy to prepare and can be made in a pinch with ingredients I usually have on hand --(once I didn't have lemon juice and substituted vinegar to get the sweet-n-sour effect). Always get compliments on this one.

Very moist and tasty, now our family favorite.  Added a bit of worcestershire and milk.  Don't forget to drain the fat before adding the sauce.

Yummy!!! I made extra sauce on the side and used ground turkey instead. It made a large loaf and between the two of us, there was only a third of it left. Thank you Delia!!

This meatloaf is SO good!  I couldn't stop eating it, and even found my sister-in-law picking crumbs out of the loaf pan.  I made it exactly as the recipe, except I doubled it. Will make again and again.

This was pretty good.  I did some crazy stuff with it.  I had two pieces of leftover fried chicken that I deboned and ground, skin/crust went in food processor as well.  It tasted just fine, but at no point tasted "chickeny".  Ground up onion, celery, garlic as well and threw in. (Would've used bell pepper, if I'd had any.) I layed a bottom layer of meatloaf, then topped w/ slices baby bella mushrooms, then topped those with an ever so generous layer of parmesan from the can.  Then I layed the next and last layer of meatloaf.  Yum.  Best meatloaf recipe I've tried yet.  I didn't care for a whole lot for extra sauce.  The amount that baked on top was plentiful.  Try making dimples with your fingertips in the meat, and the sause will stick better.  I also used broiler to get sticky gooey effect on top at the end.

This meatloaf is of the better I've tried. It took more like 30 minutes to prepare and found the sauce too runny to stay cooked on top. It only served 4 people and was delicious.

My husband loves meatloaf. I never made it b/c I have always hated the stuff. That is, until now! This is a GREAT recipe!  I have made it several times and it just keeps getting better. I used quick cook oats instead of bread pieces. This time I didn't have mustard powder so used regular prepared mustard and it still tasted great. Thannks for a wonderful recipe.

Just like Mom used to make! Since there were only two of us, I scaled the servings to 3, which was perfect for the 1 lb. of beef I had on hand. I baked 30 min. before glazing and baking an add'l 10 min., but next time I will follow the advice of glazing much earlier to bake it on. Used slightly less sugar per reviews, and was overall pretty darned please. Thanks!

I was a little nervous because I had never heard of making meatloaf with brown sugar, but I am pretty new to cooking.  Anyway, I made it and I thought it came out pretty good.  I didn’t have any beef bouillon granules so that’s the only thing I left out.  I was anxious to hear my boyfriend’s response because he doesn’t really like sweet things, but he liked this.  I will keep this recipe along with my traditional recipe.

This was truly a disappointment. I read all the reviews so I thought I'd try it, as I was looking for a different recipe from my own. My kids wouldn't eat it and they love meatloaf. Apparently they only like mine! LOL. My opinion is it was way too sweet. Will not be making it again, kids said.."stick with your recipe Mom!" :-)

Great recipe! I've never made a meatloaf that actually stayed sliced when I served it onto the plates. This meatloaf was super moist and tasty even though I used ground turkey which can come out very dry. The last 1-2 minutes, I put the meatloaf under the broiler to make the topping really bubbly and sticky. It looked like candy apple glaze! I usually dip my meatloaf in ketchup, but this glaze was so sweet and delicious, I didn't have to use the ketchup. I did add some granulated garlic and fresh ground pepper to the meat mix and some whole grain mustard instead of the mustard powder since I didn't have any. The only change I would make is maybe a little less brown sugar. Excellent comfort food.

Over time, I've tried many meatloaf recipes from this site.  The glaze and texture, especially the glaze, sets this one apart.  This one is the keeper.  Today, I added chopped green pepper (to use it up), added a little minced garlic and black pepper.  It's always great whether you tweak it or not.  Just a note to the reviewer whose brown sugar was hard as a rock ... buy it in the plastic bag or store it in an airtight container.  Rocks no more!

This was a great recipe, I loved the taste of the lemon in the ketchup.  Whenever I try a new recipe, I ask my husband, keep or throw away.  He said to keep this one, but a little less onions.

This is very good meatloaf. I will definitely continue to make it, although it won't displace my original one. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is that the meat would have been a bit bland if I had not added to it. I used 2 cloves minced garlic, 1/2 tsp. dried marjoram, 3/4 tsp. dried basil, and I doubled the boullion.

This is an excellent meatloaf. I used ground chuck, which made the loaf too crumbly. Next time I will either use an 80% ground beef or add some ground pork. I too cut back on the brown sugar.

This was a delicious recipe!!!!! My husband had seconds as did I.  I put in 3 tsp of brown sugar instead of the full amount.  I used a full onion and also used a bit more ketchup than was called for.  My husband loves ketchup, though.  This was even tasty reheated the next day.  Definitely 5 stars.

Didn't like this at all. I will stick to my old recipe that everyone loves. This was dry, tasteless and the only one who ate it was my husband because he is on the low-carb diet and was very hungry!

Totally great recipe! We all had seconds (That's 6 people!). Reading that some people found the meat part bland, I sprinkled in some of my favourite spices: Dill, Oregano, Basil, and a touch of Mint. Taking more advice from reviews, I only added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Next time I'll make more of the topping to have as a dipping sauce. I will definetly make this again!

The ketchup mixture was great!! I just think that it had too much sugar, so I added Garlic-Salt Powder and added mushrooms.

This meatloaf was delicious.My husband who has an aversion to meatloaf loved it. I made a few changes based on the comments of others: Substituted 1C bread crumbs for bread,used 2tsp.of bouillon granules instead of 1, added 1/2tsp.salt,1/4tsp.pepper, doubled the sauce. Very flavorful.Thanks Delia for sharing this great recipe!

I found the meatloaf itself to be a bit bland but the glaze was great.  I will continue my search for the perfect meatloaf, but I will keep the glaze.

This was AWESOME.  My husband loves his mother's recipie, but after tasting this he said to forget Mom's recipie.  I used 1 cup bread crumbs instead of bread slices.  I wonder how this glaze would be on pork chops or chicken....Great recipie!!!

This was a really nice meatloaf recipe, and the glaze really augmented it. My husband and I enjoyed it tremendously. I'd recommend it to anyone -- in fact, I already have. The only thing was that it looked like the beef part might be a little bland, so I added 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/6 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 Lawry's Seasoning Salt (basically whatever looks good in the cupboard). Thanks for posting this recipe.

I have never liked meatloaf but now I do.  I love this recipe!  I have made it twice and will keep making it.  I substituted the onion with a 1/2 packet of onion soup mix and used 1/4C brown sugar in the sauce.  It turned out wonderful.

This was an easy, tasty, and truly gratifying meatloaf.  Not greasy or dry...  Served with mashed potatoes and fresh corn, it made the perfect "comfort food".  My family really enjoyed it, and even though I had planned on leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches the next day, there was nothing left to wrap up!  Great recipe!

This recipe is easy to make and according to my father, quite tasty.  He asks that I make more every couple weeks.  I double the sauce, bake it, let it cool and then slice it into individual servings and freeze it. By doing this he can have his favorite meatloaf anytime he chooses.

Made this recipe as written. It turned out yummy. It was moist & held together just fine. I did have to cook it a bit longer than stated in the recipe. I used 3 slices of dried out Italian bread. I wanted to use dry bread crumbs, but the ones who wrote in saying they did that, did not provide any measurment. This is a nice meatloaf, nothing fancy but a real keeper!

I really enjoyed this.  I would use the glaze mixture again on other things as well. Simple, but good ratio of sweet to tangy.  Usually I have to keep tasting and correcting, but not with this. A no-brainer.

Didn't think lemon would taste so good!  I would double the yummy glaze next time!  Use lean beef or use a fat draining pan.  My husband usually prefers the other meatloaf recipe with ritz crackers and sausage, but since this one I can whip up with stuff I always have on hand, I find it easier to put on the menu.

This was excellent. The sauce was so good. Next time I will use dry bread crumbs to make it less mushy. I have added this to my permanent recipe collection.




































This was excellent. It had wonderful flavour.  The sauce was terrific. Next time I think I will use dried bread crumbs, the meatloaf was a little too much on the moist side.

My boyfriend, who isn't fond of meatloaf liked this pretty well. My son loved it, said it was the best meatloaf I had ever made. I liked it, however, I did think the meatloaf itself needed a little more kick. It was just a tad bland for my taste. The glaze was wonderful! I will try this again.

I've made this twice now and the family loves it.  Great tasting glaze, and it made the house smell really good while it was cooking in the oven.   My youngest says this is better than my normal recipe for meatloaf, so guess what?  This is the meatloaf that will be served in this household from now on!

I thought my meatloaf was good until I tried this one. The only thing I added was some chopped bell pepper. I will be using this recipe from now on.

I picked this recipe because it does not use milk. We don't drink milk. so we never have any in the house to cook with.

This is an easy recipe that turns out great......I used some old beef bouillon. Next time will use fresh....Anyway...this turned out great as is.  For the bread crumbs, I toasted two end crusts and one piece, then used some kitchen shears to cut into small chunks.

This recipe is easy to customize...enjoy, I did...and yes. I will make it again.

We love meatloaf so I am always looking for new recipes to try. This is the first one I have made that called for lemon juice. Adds just a subtle taste of lemon, overall flavor was great. This is a very good meatloaf.

This recipe is a great base to start off with. I hide a bunch of veggies in this meatloaf and my kids are none the wiser. Finely chopped (in the processor) fresh tomatoes, red and green bell peppers, onions, lots of garlic, and even kale! I didn't have any lemon for the glaze so I used apple cider vinegar instead. Great taste. I did not mix any of the ketchup concoction into the meatloaf, but did add some Worcestershire and smoked paprika. Used breadcrumbs instead of bread pieces, and doubled the eggs.  Now that I know my kids are a fan and they're eating lots of vegetables, I'll be making this meatloaf again and again!

I was hesitant about using lemon juice, but it added a really nice pop of acid that the glaze needed.  My family enjoyed this.

Good basic recipe.  The second time, we added sautéed mushrooms along with the onions, then cut the brown sugar to about half.

I omitted the lemon juice; Used 1 tsp. prepared mustard in place of dried mustard. Used bread crumbs (approx  2/3 cup) + a little water in place of bread. Also used 2 eggs and 1 1/2 lbs ground beef. Spread sauce on last 15 min.
So,  beat eggs in large bowl then mix in all other ingredients; bread crumbs, water, onion, beef bouillon salt (1/2 tsp.), parsley, brown sugar, ketchup, mustard then add ground beef . Mix ground beef w/ bread crumb mixture. Was Yummy!

Reminded me of a meatloaf I enjoyed many years ago. Nice and firm with lots of flavor. Used 93% fat free meat so very little fat to pour off and yet it was nice an moist.

This was a great recipe! The brown sugar made it sweet, which we liked. The only problem was it was a bit difficult to cut into slices, as it was somewhat crumbly. Maybe an extra egg would help!

I follow the recipe exactly as written. Sometimes will add some shredded carrots to the mixture before cooking. My family and I love this! My step daughter, who hated meatloaf before this and would never, ever eat it, now begs me to make it.

I made this as directed. The meat was super dry and not a great texture. I thought the egg would help but it didn't. The flavor of the sauce was great though.

Really enjoyed this meatloaf. It was too sweet so next time I'll cut back on the sugar! Used Bread Crumb Italian Seasoning and Worchester Sauce in place of bread and bouilon grandules

It was one of the best meatloaf recipes I’ve used. I will make it again. The leftovers were even better, since I browned the slices on both sides.

This came out good. I used about 3/4 cup bread crumbs instead of bread. I also used Worcestershire sauce instead of beef granules. I decreased the brown sugar a little too.

My family raved about the meatloaf! They even wanted more of the glaze topping to add to their servings. Unfortunately I used all of it on the meatloaf per the recipe. Next time I'll make extra glaze topping, heat it up and have it available to serve =D

This was super easy to make and was really good too!  I think next time though I would add Worcestershire into the "sauce" and use more of the sauce in the hamburger mixture for more flavour.

I used  80/20 hamburger meat.  (Less grease!)   Total amount I used was a pkg. of 2.33 pounds.  Not enough extra to worry about.     I added approx. 1 T. garlic powder to beef mixture.  Husband loved it at first bite.  Said it was very good.  Upon eating his 2nd slice, he said he couldn't believe he actually likes this meatloaf better than a steak.  Wow!  Yes, it's going in my recipes to make again!!

Made the recipe exact without any changes. Two of us loved it (the zing from the lemon in the loaf) - the last preferred a traditional ground beef/pork mix for the meat. Would definitely make again, loved the zing and acidity. Very tasty.

Rating just the glaze - very nice!  I used it on my regular go-to savory meatloaf recipe, and it was a really nice touch on top of that.  I always make two meatloaves at once (one to freeze), and doubling the glaze recipe made way too much for two loaves.  Next time I might just try it with 3/4 c. of ketchup instead of a full cup to cover two meatloaves.

Nice start but I know I'd tweek it a bit to my liking. Remembering my mom's and thinking the meat needs more flavoring it it. Also used very lean beef and think that made it a bit drier, not so much to my liking.

This is the best meatloaf I've ever made for the family. I didn't have lemon juice, so just substituted half the amount of juice called for with vinegar.

The recipe is so easy to follow. I've added shredded swiss cheese into the mixture. Next time I will fry the onion first as it tasted a bit intense now. My husband had two and half servings! Super winter dinner!

I added salt and pepper, parmesan, bread crumbs instead of bread and sautéed 2 garlic cloves plus the onion before mixing it in. 

I also took previous advice and used a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar instead and it worked out really well.

Great idea for weeknights!!!

This is probably my favourite recipe for meatloaf ever! The only thing I will change next time is to exclude the glaze over the top - just a bit too sweet for my taste.

A great meatloaf, packed with flavour!
Instead of bread or crackers, I use Japanese Panko Breadcrumbs. I also used prepared mustard (Hot English) as I didn't have mustard powder. I also added a good pinch or two of freshly ground black pepper.
I am working my way through the meatloaf recipes, not all though, only the ones that appeal to me. This is No. 2, and the best so far!

Any recipe for meatloaf that needs ketchup can't be good. It is better to add seasoning like bell peppers, unions ,garlic sauteed in olive oil and herbs like maybe Herbs de Provence. Then make a proper gravy, maybe with a wine reduction.

Granddaughter requested meatloaf for our weekly Sunday dinner so I decided to try it. Was very simple and really tasty  and the whole family loved it.  I actually had to make 3 loaves to feed 10 adults and 7 kids.  We had 1 small piece left over.  I made exactly as stated it, except I used panko bread crumb (about 1 1/2 cups) and still came out perfect. Will be making again for sure.

I did make a few changes. I took skygirls advice and added the tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and sauteing the onions with garlic prior to combining all ingredients. In addition I added a 1lb of plain ground pork. It was yummy yummy for your tummy. Oh! and the kids liked it too (13 and 15)

It's a quick, easy, delicious recipe that everyone in my family enjoys. I've made it several times and it's just as good as the first time I made it. The only thing I do different is instead of bread I use crackers.

I was looking for the glaze my grandmother put on her meatloaf... This comes closest to it. It's fabulous! I don't like lemon juice so I just substituted balsamic vinegar instead. We use ground venison for meatloaf and burgers and this glaze is especially good with it! Also I didn't have dry mustard (hate when I open the cabinet and it's all gone!) so I just squirted in a dollop of spicy brown mustard. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe- even with my little tweaks it still tastes just like my Grandma Bessie's, and she was an amazing cook. Now I can have her meatloaf along with the wonderful memories!

Best meatloaf recipe ever.  I excluded the bouillon, but simply because I didn't have it.  I will try the recipe with it next time.  I added half a package of french onion soup mix.

Great recipe. Ive made it a few times. And the only change i Made was substituting onion soup mix in place of onion. I liked it better as the onions don't seem to cook thru and the soup also adds a nice flavor.  Next time I think I'll add small can of tomato sauce and omit the lemon juice and maybe up the amount of mustard. But for the most part I'll prob use this recipe (with soup mix) cause its so good.

First time making meatloaf. I omitted the lemon juice and bouillon granules and added 1/2 cup of green peppers. I'd omit the onions and green peppers when I try this again, though ~ too crunchy. Sauce on top was fantastic! Served with peas and carrots and mashed potatoes.

Used the glaze on the 'Mixture for Meatballs, Meatloaf or Burgers' recipe and it was wonderful!!  Will try this entire recipe next time.  07/26/13 - Tried this recipe in its entirety.  It's delicious but I prefer to use this glaze on top of the "Mixture for Meatballs, etc" recipe.

Loved it!!  Like some of the other reviewers, I used uncooked oats and apple cider vinegar instead of bread and lemon juice but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My family raved about it!  There wasn't a morsel left!!  Thanks for an awesome meatloaf recipe Delia!!  I will make this again and again!

With a little modifications, this meatloaf was outstanding.  Instead of using mustard and lemon juice, I used yellow mustard.  I also added a secret ingredient.  I will make it again for sure!

I have made this recipe twice and both times my husband and kids have LOVED IT. My only suggestion is to make more glaze as it can be thin if you are making two loaves. I also added several pinches of garlic to the sauce. My sides were the garlic potatoes and the spinach and cranberry salad also found at allrecipes.com!

I have been making meatloaf for years, and looked online today for something a little different.  This was a big hit.  The brown sugar added the perfect sweetness to the meatloaf and my husband is looking forward to meatloaf sandwiches for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks for a wonderful dinner!

Never liked meatloaf, nor cooked it before. My husband and parents said it was the best meatloaf they have ever eaten and my mom demanded the recipe! I used the veal, pork, beef mix, omitted bullion and brown sugar. Outstanding recipe!

Absolute best meatloaf I have ever made/had! My children even ate it and had seconds. I will have to make a bigger batch next time so I can have my favorite next day meatloaf sandwich ( I only used a lb of meat).

First time making meatloaf! I'm eating it right now and it's super good, nice and moist, and the sauce on top is excellent. The only change I made was I didn't have any mustard powder so I used spicy brown mustard instead. And I used a food processor to get the bread into really little crumbs. Delicious!

Awesome!  This comes from a family who are very picky meatloaf eaters. Trying to please everybody its difficult. My daughter, who hates anything with bbq sauce or ketchup, loved it. The glaze is a hit. I used the bread crumbs instead of the bread. It was most and juicy. As for the leftovers?  Leftovers, there are no leftovers! Thank you for this recipe.

This was very good. Husband said the glaze was a little sweet but it was still very good. Not dry at all. I did use breadcrumbs instead of the pieces of bread, as some others had suggested. Will save this recipe and make again, maybe using a little less brown sugar next time. May also add some mushrooms to the mix next time!

The flavor of the glaze with the meat was great, unfortunately it doesn't really tranfer to the rest of the loaf.

I love this recipe the way it is. I have made it several times with ground turkey, ground beef, and ground chicken. I love them all with this recipe.

Oh, man.
This is the first meatloaf I've attempted. I was looking for a recipe that would forego the "cakeyness" of other meatloafs. So following the advice of several others, I used: 
1 cup of oats in place of the bread.
The oats allow the ingredients to adhere to actually make a loaf without gluten and thus without that spongy texture that I hate.

I also lined the loaf pan with sliced potatoes (bottom and sides with very thin slices on top of the meat and covered with a layer of sharp cheddar) and used:
2 tablespoons of finely diced shallots instead of onions.

I also added: 
a few dashes of Worcestershire.

The sauce is just beautiful, especially with a bit of apple cider vinegar.

Next time I'm going to put an extra layer of sliced potatoes on the bottom (the potatoes underneath the meat soaked up the excess moisture from the loaf, making a sort of mashed potato crust). It was a happy accident that I intend to expand upon. :)

Huge hit with the family - even those who weren't wild about meat loaf.  It is definitely the glaze.

This recipe is delicious and the glaze was amazing. I used Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of bread cubes. I added Onion Powder instead of onions, and I used 97% lean turkey meat instead of beef. Substituted chicken bouillon for beef because that was what I had on hand. I added some minced garlic and served with scalloped potatoes. Yum!

Best meatloaf ever.  Made exactly to recipe except that I cut the recipe in half because I had only one pound of meat.  And instead of using 1.5 slices of bread I used two  It was excellent.  Tore the bread up in little pieces which I have never done in a meatloaf before and we loved it!

Very tasty, especially the glaze. Only thing I did differently was sauté the onion in butter first. Stole that idea from the Barefoot Contessa. I would definitely make this again. My pickey husband even liked it.

This was my first attempt at meatloaf. I used a couple packets of Sazon complete seasonings in place of the beef bouillon and took another reviewers suggestion of adding some minced garlic. I'm Cuban so almost everything gets garlic! I also used the full 3 pieces of bread but tore them into tiny pieces. I don't measure things so my amounts may have been slightly different, but it tastes great! Wasn't sure about using mustard powder as I don't like mustard and had never used it as a powder, but the flavor is great and not like mustard you buy for deli sandwiches.  I will make this again!

This is the only recipe my mom used while I was growing up. The only difference is she doubled the glaze and used half in the meat and reserved the rest to use ontop. It makes a huge difference and makes the meatloaf very moist.

This is a great starter recipe for someone who is new to or has never had a meatloaf they enjoyed.  I would definitely recommend this as a jumping off point for people.  This recipe is fairly similar to the one I currently use.  I usually don't measure when I make meatloaf, but I followed this recipe exactly to see if I liked the product better.  I liked the addition of the lemon in the glaze as it adds a nice dimension to the flavor.  However, I felt it was too overpowering to have the lemon in the meatloaf as well.  It detracted too much from the savory flavors of the meatloaf and is primarily responsible for my 3-star rating.  In addition, some of the proportions were off (for our tastes), leaving the meatloaf less firm and flavorful than when more onion and breadcrumbs and (non-lemon) glaze are used in the meat.  I will go back to my favorite meatloaf recipe, but I WILL begin adding lemon juice to my glaze.  This recipe is definitely worth a try, as I said, it is a great jumping off point.  I think as people tweak it to their tastes, each person will find THEIR 5-star version of meatloaf.

I actually used this recipe for the glaze.  I had bought a pound and a half of prepared uncooked meatloaf at Draegers.  It didn't look like enough for our family so I added very lean ground beef to it, two pieces of bread torn with crust removed, one egg, and salt and pepper and a bit of catsup.  I did use the glaze from this recipe subsituting cider vinegar for the lemon juice.  Cooked the meatload in a mound on a foil covered baking sheet surrounded by potatoes.  Roasted for a bit over an hour.  Then transfered the potatoes to a bowl and moved the meatloaf to a cassarole where I glazed with sauce.  I was afraid that the sauce would just slide off the meat so I wanted to "catch it" in the cassarole. Didn't need to do that since it did stay put on the meat.  Did bake more like 20 minutes more to get it a bit darker brown which we like.

I like this recipe because its quick and I have all the ingredients on hand.   I've made this twice now.  The first time I made it with bread crumbs and extra glaze - it was very good, but not great.  The second time, I reduced the sugar and left out the mustard powder as I didn't have any on hand (didn't notice it missing).    This is not the best meatloaf I've ever had, but it is a good recipe and I will make it again because its different from the kind of meatloaf I usually make.

It was sweet(not what I like in meatloaf) and the bread was cooked in clumps(even thought I cut into tiny peices.  If you like sweet main dishes, this one is for you

This is by far the best meatloaf I've ever had!  Only change is that I use 1 c. bread crumbs in place of the bread.  Just as good with ground turkey!

This recipe was really only ok. I followed exactly with only one exception: I used 1 C bread crumbs instead of the bread slices. The ketchup mix for the sauce was way too sweet for a meatloaf, in my opinion. My husband and I could barely stomach it. I may re-try this recipe with half the brown sugar called for and tomato paste or a can of tomato sauce instead of ketchup. There's quite enough sugar as it is in 1/2 C of ketchup that you don't need so much sugar.

Great.  Made recipe with slight modifications to rave reviews. I omitted the egg due to allergies, used Italian bread crumbs and pork/beef mixture. Served with a side of garlic cheese mashed potatoes.

My  husband, kids and a visiting kid all ate this up.  My only changes were tomato paste instead of ketchup, no lemon juice (because I didnt have any), and bread crumbs instead of bread.  The tomato/brown sugar combo was a nice sweet/savory combination.  I will definitely make again. Thanks

This was great!  The only changes I made were to add a little Montreal Steak Seasoning to the mixture and I used oatmeal instead of the bread because we were out of bread. Fed my family of five and they all gave it rave reviews.  Will definitely be making again.

Very yummy, moist meatloaf with just enough sweetness.  Always a hit in my house, especially if I use ground beef with at least 85/15 fat content.  Perfect for the colder months!

I did mostly what others suggested: cut-back on the brown sugar, doubled the glaze, and added some garlic powder and s&p to the meat mix to spice it up.  Only used 1 slice of bread and used a 3/4 cup mix of regular and italian bread crumbs.  Delicious.

I have never cared for meatloaf so this is rated by my husband and 16 year old son.  They both really liked it and gave it 4 stars.  They would like me to make it again and both will be having meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.

All I have to say is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!
I didn't use bouillion, I used A1 instead. I only used 2 tbl brown sugar.  I didn't use bread or bread crumbs, I used the garlic and herb Toppers crackers, ground them up pretty good.  Awesome choice!  My husband thought it was the best ever, my 4 year even thought it was awesome!!

My husband totally loved this recipe...he is a fan of the classic meatloaf, and we were not disappointed with this recipe.  I think the only changes I made was a couple of dashes or Worcestershire sauce and minced garlic.  It was perfect with some good old fashion mashed potatoes.

Delicious - my kids inhaled it.  I did add a dose of worcestershire sauce (a must for meatloaf) to the meat, and only had a 1.75 lb beef package that I baked in a small loaf pan (3"x8"??).  The glaze is addicting, definitely double it next time.

this was okay; I had to change onions to onion powder b/c my husband doesn't like pieces of onions in his food.  But I did everything else.  I thought it tasted somewhat bland compared to how I usually make it which has alot of other seasonings for flavor.

After reading all of the reviews, I was expecting a lot more out of the sauce. It was too sweet for my tastes. The meatloaf was great, though. Next time I think I will cut out the brown sugar for a more savory/less sweet overall flavor. I also used ground bison instead of beef, since that is what I had. It turned out really well.

Loaf came out moist and overall it was good. For me I didn't care for the mustard though but everyone else liked it.
I'm giving this recipe one more try. I like to use half ground chuck or sirloin and half hamburger that way not too much oil comes out of the loaf.

Yummy Meatloaf- my kids love this recipe. I have made it 3 times, and my husband is still surprised when he likes it, because he has never liked meatloaf. I use venison instead of ground beef- works great!

LOVE this recipe! I added my own twist & used suggestions from previous posters . .(2lbs of 80% ground beef) fine chopped the onion, 1 1/8 cup bread crumbs in place of sliced bread, Vinegar in place of Lemon juice, dashed with lil’ garlic, parsley, & Worcestershire sauce.  Made green beans and roasted red potatoes as side dish. My husband can be picky-even with meatloaf- he LOVED it/suggested it would be a GREAT addition to our dinner “rotation”.  Thanks for the new favorite. Veronica

It wasn't bad, but neither superb. I lowered the recipe amount, using allrecipes.com serving calculator, and then followed the recipe to a T. Really sweet, kind of dry, and lacked salt. If I make this again, I'll lower the sugar quantity, increase the salt, and cook it for less time.

I did the same as some others suggested and lowered the brown sugar to 2T and used 1C bread crumbs instead. This was an amazing recipe. If my family would let me I would make it every day. It is even great as leftovers and my family does not like leftovers! You have to try this one!

The glaze was not too sweet and very tasty.  The meat itself was dry.  I used 80/20 hamburger meat.  All in all it was good but not EXACTLY what I was looking for in a meatloaf recipe.  My boyfriend said it was better than his mom's so I guess that's good. ;-)

I don't think this came out quite as good as the Brown Sugar Meatloaf on this site. It still came out well, but seemed a bit soggy in the end. Maybe it needs time to set up afterwards or more bread? As a side note, I did use three slices of multigrain bread that had nuts in there, which seemed to add an interesting texture/appeal to it. I would try this again, just use more bread or bread crumbs next time.

I have made this several times, the only thing I do different is use bread crumbs instead of slices of bread.  It is a family favorite.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  I really used it as a jump off and added a few extras to the meat (fresh minced garlic and pepper) and to the glaze (a dab of BBQ sauce and used mustard ) and it was a success!  My boyfriend, who warned me before dinner that he isn't a Meatloaf kinda guy, asked for seconds and was looking forward to leftovers the next day!  Easy to make, very tasty and lots of room to make it your own.

This is the best meatloaf. I didn't have any beef granules on hand so I used onion soup mix instead and I loved it-so did my husband. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very tasty.  I only used one pound of beef, and less lemon juice than the recipe required.  I also topped my individual, hand-formed loaves with bacon.  I adjusted the other ingredients as needed, except for the egg.  I used pretzel flips instead of bread.

Same as Glazed Meatloaf II...except for how the ingredients are listed.  Lemon juice:  one-fourth cup, divided, or 1T and 3T.  I've tried II and thought I would now try this one....oh, well.

Great! My family doesn't eat meatloaf too often but I know my dad loved it. I made him this recipe and he thought it was great.  He especially liked that the recipe called for broken up slices of bread rather than pre-made breadcrumbs. I'll definitely make this again.

I normally give any recipe a 5 if I follow the recipe and it comes out good.  After reading the raves I thought I was in for a surprise.  This meatloaf was average.  Tasted like something I have had before.  Maybe seasoning the meat more couldnt hurt.

I really likes this and I have never really liked meatloaf! I only had one ound of meat and I forgot to halve the rest of the ingredients, so the texture was a little weird for me but, I could tell that it would be great if I made it correctly. I did take some suggestions from others like, bread crumbs instewad of bread cubes and I also put some more seasoning in the meat. I mad it into 4 individual loaves for a shorter baking time and when I put the glaze on I turned the broiler on for about 5 minutes to get the glaze all carmelized...yummy!

Very Good recipe. I did double the sauce as others had recommended. I used a small can of tomato sauce plus ketchup for the top. My wife enjoyed this recipe very much as did I. It is sweet, but in this recipe that is okay.

Excellent, moist meatloaf.  I added a package of dry onion soup mix, used bread crumbs, added lots of ketchup when mixing meatloaf.  I then scooped a large "bowl" in the middle of the loaf and filled with shredded cheddar cheese, molded it back into a loaf and it made a suprise filling inside.  Family loved it!

I've been using this recipe for years, sometimes exactly and sometimes I change it up a bit. One son likes it sweet one doesn't like it as sweet. I always double or triple this recipe (to keep everyone happy), it freezes well. To make it not so sweet I cut back on brown sugar and add 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper or cajun spices and have also added a layer in the middle of cheese.

The glaze is way too sweet, although it might work nice with babyback ribs. I found the meat to be a bit bland with little texture, even after adding an extra ingredient of fresh chopped garlic. It wasn't horrible, but is wasn't good either. I'm actually shock that it got the ratings that it did. Maybe the expectations of meatloaf are set too low?

This was a good meatloaf.  The glaze was tasty -- but a bit too sweet.
I used breadcrumbs instead of bread (because I was out).
It was good.  I just have another recipe that used BBQ sauce that I think we prefer.

I modified the recipe out of necessity:  I decided to make meatloaf at the last minute and didn't have mustard powder, so I used same amount of Coarse Ground mustard (has mustard seeds in it).  I also didn't have beef boullion granules, so had to 'break up' a boullion cube instead.  I did go ahead and double the sauce as others suggested. THIS SAUCE IS AWESOME!!! I don't care for meatloaf particularly, but my husband loves it.  The sauce made me actually decide I would have to make meatloaf more often.

The meatloaf was great.  My husband and I enjoyed it, and I'm not usually a meatloaf lover.  However, I did find the cooking time to be a bit off.  After an hour and ten minutes, the center was not done.  It took about an hour and forty minutes to cook all the way through.

Texture and consistency were fine but was just a little too sweet for our taste.  Next time will make just the same only decreasing the amount of brown sugar a bit.

This recipe is fantastic! I had not made meatloaf in over 2 years, so I decided to try a new recipe when I tried this one. I did modify it slightly, I added a package of onion soup mix, and used cubed wheat bread. My husband and I enjoyed it very much and so did our 3 kids. It has great flavor and was very juicy too.

The sauce is absolutely the best! Overall though I felt the meatloaf needed more seasoning. Not sure what exactly but will definitely make again and experiment to find some spices to fit our tastebuds. Thank you for a wonderful sauce and the opportunity to make a good meatloaf even better.

This meatloaf is the BEST!  I double the glaze so there is more to put on top -- and I use dry bread crumbs.  My family hated meatloaf until I found this recipe.

I would have never thought I would LOVE meatloaf.  This is definitely a delicious recipe.  Our family has it about every two weeks.  I have tweaked the recipe.  Instead of using ground beef only, I use a mixture of ground pork and beef.  I've used Italian bread crumbs before and it comes out very nice as well.

This is an excellent recipe! It is similar to a ham loaf recipe that I use occasionally. I did make a couple changes however.  I used 1lb of beef and 1lb of Bob Evan's sausage. I also used a 1/2 of a sleeve of club crackers in place of the bread. This turned out very well. My husband was particularly pleased!

I changed the recipe a bit. It came out fabulous.  I used 1 Tbsp of lemon juice for the glaze and none for the meat. I put in one whole onion (chopped), 1 clove garlic (minced), 1/2 cup fresh parsley (chopped), 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp pepper.  I omitted the bouillon granules.  My husband and I loved this recipe. I was surprised that my husband did because I used the 1/3 cup brown sugar, and he would usually complain if I add anything sweet to meat dishes.  There were no complaints tonight; only praise.  :-)

It's the first time I ever made meatloaf and it was pretty good!  I didn't use alot of brown sugar because all the reviews here said it was way too sweet. I didn't use mustard or the granules because I didn't have any.  Instead of bread, I used half a package of stove top stuffing, which was suggested to me by a friend.  I should have made extra glaze though because it really makes it taste extra special!

Moist, flavorful and delicious! I made it for 8 and had plenty. I also doubled the sauce recipe, and thought I may have overwhelmed it a bit -- but really still loved the flavor. Another family favorite. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great meatloaf.  I always double the sauce, but don't put any in the meat.  I need the extra because I make mine mini loafs and like the sauce extra thick on top.

This meatloaf was to die for! My boyfriend and 2 year old ate until the plate was clean! I made a few changes as I did not have all of the ingredients. For the sauce I used a tsp of regular French's mustard instead of dry, I only had dark brown sugar so I used that, I added Mrs. Dash and Italian Herb Seasoning since I did not have the beef bouillon, and I used season bread crumbs instead of fresh bread. I also added a couple of tsp of minced garlic. I used only 1lb of beef so I cut everything in half. I ended up having to make another serving of sauce to cover the meat so next time  I just won't cut that in half. GREAT recipe... will definitely make again and often.

Very good meatloaf recipe. I added some parsley and garlic to the mixture, and added some more breadcrumbs (I had cornbread lying around) to the mixture...I only had one pound of lean meat so I cooked it for about 35 minutes, and then added the glaze (I did double the recipe as some suggested...I like it because I like the sweet with the savory) and baked for another 10..it was excellent. I think this is going to taste even better as leftover meatloaf sandwhiches. My husband also really enjoyed it...so its a keeper.

This is a good meatloaf.  A couple of points... you should pack the meat into the pan firmly so that it stays together when you slice it.  Also, I find the sauce to be much too sweet (though it suits my wife's sweet tooth fine).  Next time I will reduce the brown sugar by half.

I thought the meatloaf was dry and probably didn't need to be cooked as long as it did but perhaps it's because I used lean mince which cooks quicker. I liked the ketchup used but I didn't taste it in the meatloaf, only as the glaze which disappointed me.  I served this with mashed potatoes and a salad and made it the all American dish. I would make this again but I'd cook it for only 40 minutes rather than the full hour and I'd use more ketchup in the recipe to make it more moist.

This recipe was simpley the most delicious meat loaf I have ever had.  It was gobbled up in its entirety quickly by my dinner party.  I have already given out several copies of this recipe.  I absolutely recommend doubling the sauce. It makes all the difference.  The meat loaf was very tender and moist.  Enjoy!

Believe it or not; I served this to guests.  After poring over all the fancy dishes, I thought that "plain old meatloaf" might be a treat.  And it was a hit!  They raved over it and talked about how long it had been since they'd had meatloaf and that they would have to have it more often.

This meatloaf was very good and definitely hit the spot. I took others' suggestions and made twice as much sauce. I couldn't imagine using half the sauce. Very good comfort food!

I followed this recipe to the letter except I used 1 pound of ground Bison instead of the ground beef. My husband is a heart patient and the bison is lower in fat and colesterol.  I was worried about using lemon juice in the meat loaf.  Not to worry.  WOW!  There was no fat to drain off.  It held together when cut, but was still moist, had a great flavor, and....My husband LOVED it!  I used wheat bread toasted in the toaster oven then crumbled it really fine.  Even though I used only 1 pound of bison I still used the same ingredients as used in the recipe for 2 pounds of lean ground beef.  Perfect meat loaf!  I can't wait to have my family over to try it with beef. The only thing wrong with the glaze is that there just wasn't enough of it.  I will double or triple next time.  What a change from the old meat loaf of my youth that was packed with tomatoe sauce and bell peppers! UGH!  Thanks Delia, for this wonderful recipe.

This was SO yummy!  My fiance loved it too.  The only thing I changed was that I doubled the glaze, and only used two tablespoons of lemon juice, so it wasn't too tangy. Will definitely be making again!

Used mostly ground turkey and then some lean ground beef. I did use the beef granules and a tsp of minced garlic. Also used 1 cup crushed cornbread stuffing instead of the torn bread. My loaf was a bit dry but I cook it on a cookie sheet rather than in a loaf pan. Will reduce cooking time slightly next time but also add a bit more of that yummy glaze to the meat. All eaters at the table loved it. Meatloaf sandwiches for tonight!

If you like sweet meatloaf, you'll enjoy this!  Delicious.  I was intrigued by the lemon juice in this recipe, which prompted me to try it.   Comes together easily, with ingredients I often have on hand. A wonderful comfort meatloaf that I'll be sure to make again.

I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who wants to prepare a "no frills" but great tasting meatloaf!  I mostly followed the recipe as written, except I reduced the lemon juice added to the meat mixture to 2 tablespoons, and I used the onions, but chopped them finely.  I found that it held together nicely when sliced, and my husband, who usually dislikes meatloaf, ate 2 helpings.  (Kids loved it, too, but insisted that I make extra sauce next time to dip it in.)

This has become a regular in our monthly dinner rotation.  My husband LOVES this recipe.  The only thing that I do different than the recipe is I do not divide the lemon juice.  I guess I mis-read the recipe the first time, then the second time I realized my mistake and did it as recipe stated and didn't like it quite as well, so I just put all the lemon juice in the glaze mixture.

I've made this recipe several times now. It's the only meatloaf recipe I make and my family loves it. I use whatever bread I have on hand...broken up into very tiny pieces. I've never added the sauce in the meatloaf, except for putting it on the top. I also double the recipe so we have plenty to dip into. My son even loves the sauce on his mashed potatoes. This is a creative and much tastier way to make meatloaf. It's a family favorite for us!

Last night I made this recipe for the second time.  The first time I felt there wasn't enough glaze to meat ratio since the meatloaf was so thick; this time I doubled the glaze and split the meat into two loaves.  It was perfect!  The slices were thinner, but still enough for 3-4 servings per loaf (I always serve it with a starch and a veggie so it goes further) and there was plenty of glaze, which is the best part.  Very easy recipe, and it tasted the same as the really complicated recipe I have with about a million ingredients.

I'm giving it 3 stars because it was edible.  The pieces of bread almost looked like fat, and made it extremely unattractive.  It shrank up, and I used a lean meat.  It was very dense, I threw half of it away, and I love next day meat loaf sandwiches, usually.  The glaze was really good, on a different meatloaf maybe.  Will not make again.

Very moist! Used leftover french bread from previous dinner and like some other reviews, added half a packet of dry onion soup mix. Husband really liked it - said that we could stop searching for a meatloaf recipe.

This is amazing meatloaf. It is definitely a new twist on an old favorite! I think the brown sugar really makes this into a completely new kind of meatloaf.

We absolutely love this meatloaf-I serve it to my family, parents, grandparents-you name it!  Everyone loves it.  The only changes I do is make extra glaze, add extra onions, and sometimes add green pepper.

The sauce is tangy, but good with the meat.  I'll do this one again.

I found this a little too bland for our taste.  I might try again with some extra spices and such in the loaf.

This is a great meatloaf.  I did use a prepared old-fashioned mustard, other than that I followed the recipe and we loved it.

Very good! I sprinkled cheese ontop of the glaze and returned it to the oven for just long enough to melt. My husband had thirds!

This was SUPER delicious!  The men I cooked for aren't huge meatloaf fans, but they ate all of the meatloaf I made last night.  The only thing I might change is doubling the recipes!

So better than most restaurant meatloaves!  I almost always order this when i see it on the menu too often to be disaapointed because it arrrives dry, bland.  But this recipe results in a very moist (90% lean gr beef), tasty meatloaf.  Definitely, the key, however, is the glaze.  I followed previous advice by doubling the sauce because really, it's the sauce that makes it so delicicious!

We enjoyed the glaze and the slight punch it gave the meat by mixing it in, but the actual meatloaf left alot of be desired in this meatloaf loving house. Perhaps its because i used wheatbread?  Who knows.  I'm going to adapt another recipe using that delicious glaze

This was really very good. The topping is similar to other recipes, but I had never considered adding some to the meat itself, as this one does. The meat was tasty and held together.

This was one of the best meatloaf that I have ever tasted!! Never thought about butting a glaze on top. I always had it w/ a side of ketchup. Not this time!  It was a really easy to make. I added 2 slices of bread cause I didn't have that much meat. But I would defiantly make this again!!

I give this a 3 meaning we "liked it", but didn't find it to be something to add to the regular meal rotation.  I have to admit, I found out *after* making and serving it that hubby isn't a meatloaf kind of guy (!) so that may have an effect on my opinion.  I made it exactly as the recipe directed, and it was flavorful and had decent texture.  The glaze was a bit too ketchupy for my taste, though.

Doubled the sauce as suggested, and am glad I did. Tasted excellent and was a big hit for dinner. Next time (and there WILL be one), I might add another piece of bread or maybe another egg. Was just a smidge too crumbly for my liking. Other than that it was perfect.

This is the first time that I ever write a food review/rating.  I found this recipe while looking for something different to cook for my boyfriend, his teenage son and my daughter.  Everyone loved it.  Hardly had any leftovers...maybe next time I'll have to double it!!!! Excellent taste and EASY!!!!

Wow!  This was delicious!  Even my three young children gobbled this up!  With two adults and three young children we ate the whole pan!  I put the bread slices in the food processor since I didn't want any bread chunks and I just used regular mustard since I didn't have the powder.  We will definitly have this again!

Great basic recipe. I've never made meatloaf before and wanted a recipe that was simple and quick.

I did make some substitutions/additions based on the recommendations here and what I had in stock. Instead of chopped onions I used a package of onion soup, and added crushed garlic. I didn't have any bread that I thought would work well, so I used some broken up multigrain crackers I had. I added some black pepper too. Apart from that I followed the instructions given.

It turned out great! It got the hubby seal of approval (and he's had a lot of meat loaf in the past - said it was one of the best he'd had). I'll definitely make it again.

Delia, you're right because this was certainly succulent, not to mention absolutely delicious. Yes, it needed more glaze, which I did triple and used bread crumbs instead of broken pieces of bread, but other than adding some garlic and onion powders, it was perfect! Can't wait to have a slice for lunch tomorrow. Thanks so much!

I now have a meatloaf recipe.  I have been searching for years.  This was so good!!!!  Everyone liked it.  The only thing I did differently was fry up some bacon and onion and then I added a packet of beefy onion soup mix.  I also doubled the sauce recipe as suggested by others.  Hubby even likes it cold.

This was like eating a giant sweet and sour meatball.  I was surprised at how much we enjoyed it.  I followed some of the suggestions and used onion soup mix and also doubled the sauce.  Next time I think I will just use a singe batch of the sauce.  My husband liked this much better than our regular meatloaf (sorry mom).

I made this for dinner last night and ate it again for breakfast today. Fligner's in Lorain, OH has a meatloaf mix of hamburger/veal/pork that was excellent! It was a little sweet so I might use less brown sugar. I used bread and a handful of crushed club crakers. This will be a regular meal for my family.

I am not usually a meatloaf fan, but I am very impressed.  The glaze added a lot of flavor.  I will make this dish again.

I really love this recipe, and have made it several times.  I do substitute onion powder in place of the chopped onion.  I just sprinkle lightly on top of the meat mixture before mixing.  Also, I did not have beef granules, so I substitutes 1 beef cube (melted in a tbsp of hot water).  This works well also.

Although this isn't your traditional meatloaf, it's great. Makes a normally plain meatloaf very flavorful. I served this with garlic mashed potatos. I Will definately make this again.

The first time I have made or eaten meatloaf!  Great basic recipe, I only had 1lb beef so added 2 grated carrots and, as the family don't like ketchup (!) I used sieved tomato passata. Although the whole dish was a little sweet to our taste, the meatloaf was really moist and tasty.  Empty plates , all round!

This is the best meatloaf recipe ever. I used to hate meatloaf unitl I made this. I did make a lot of changes- I only used the ketchup, brown sugar, egg, and bread crumbs. I elimated everything else because I was making it for my children. But it was still awsome. It doesn't last very long in my house- my kids gobble it up.

My kids absolutely loved it and ate it all. It was a little too sweet for my taste.

I will definitely be making it again since the family liked it so much.

I gave this a 3 only because my meatloaf was a little tough. I've never been able to master a meatloaf so it could be something I did to make it that way. It was flavorful and not too sweet but a little tough when all was said and done.

Good warm or cold for sandwiches.  I used only 2 slices of bread, sauteed the onions first and added 1/2 - 1 t. chopped garlic.  After 40 min. of baking, I put the glaze on and baked for another 20 minutes.  This one is a keeper.

I was a bit skeptical on this one but wanting to try something different and after reading the reviews I had to try this recipe. It was "great"!! For me I loved the glaze which I will double the next time but I added more onion and chopped bellpepper but it was very flavorful and moist and delicious.

This was by far the best meatloaf I've ever had. I used the Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of chopped onion. Be careful with the lemon juice, I added the first Tbspn, but forgot to add the rest and the meatloaf was already in the oven, but I poured it over the top and then poked holes in the meatloaf with a round spoon handle so the lemon juice could soak in. 
I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh peas, definitely a winner with my family! Thanks for sharing!

This was a great tasting, easy to make recipe. Only things I changed were substituting ground beef with beef/veal/pork combo  package, and 1 piece of bread with equivelant of seasoned bread crumbs. Big hit with the family as there were no leftovers to try to make sandwiches the next day.

This was very good.  My daughter usually doesn't eat meatloaf so it was surprising when she totaly cleaned her plate!  I didn't have an onion so I used Lipton Onion Soup Mix instead and it was great!  I also double on the sauce.

9/2019 - made again, had brown sugar but no ground mustard to substituted squeeze mustard.  All in all it was fine but 2 pounds for our family of 5 was way too much!  After two rounds of leftovers, we were tired of this.  4/6/2006 - Not my favorite meatloaf recipe but my family LOVED it - there wasn't a morsel left!  Very easy - made it the night before so all I had to do was bake.  Substituted artificial sugar since I didn't have brown sugar.  Would double the glaze recipe since I didn't really  have enough to cover top of meatloaf.  Taste was great and very moist!

Best Meatloaf Ever! I don't usually like meatloaf but I even loved it! Hubby ate seconds which never happens! I made it with mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and green beans. Best meal we have had in a long time and we will def make it again and again!

Bread is a nice touch instead of breadcrumbs. Moist and flavorful. Glaze is tangy and robust. Overall good recipe.

My husband and I both enjoyed it.  It was a bit sweeter than I'm normal.  I added some other spices (oregano, parsely, etc.) to avoid the blandness others experienced.  I think we'll make it again and alternate it with our normal meatloaf.

The meatloaf itself was good but the sauce was, well, yucky.  My honey thought so as well.  I'd make it without the 'glaze' if I did it again.

I don't eat meat, but I made this for my husband and son and they both loved it. I used whole wheat bread and lime juice instead of lemon juice as I had no lemon juice. Will definately make this again for the boys.

This recipe was pretty good.  It was very moist which is a hard feat sometimes with meatloaf.  The meatloaf, complete with glaze, tasted a bit like a McDonald's hamburger which is really good for the kids as they may like it that much more.  I probably won't make it again for my husband but will definately make it for a kids night dinner.

Very delicious.  I didn't have beef bullion so I used beef flavored soup mix from a pkg of raman noodle.  I also used regular brown mustard (1 tbsp) instead of 1 tsp of dry mustard. This is a must repeat for our family!

This was the first time I have ever made meatloaf and this was an easy and delicious recipe.  The only changes I made were: fresh garlic for the mustard powder, less bread and no beef bouillon.

Absolutely a keeper. Easy, lip smacking delicious, flavorsome, juicy, clean finish may be because of the addition of lemon juice. Passing this one on to friends.

Dry - glaze was very good.  Kind of bland even though I added some rubbed sage.  I prefer my turkey meatloaf which is very moist and delicious.

My husband says this is the best meatloaf he's ever had.  I used turkey instead of beef and vinegar instead of lemon juice, and it turned out great.  Makes great sandwiches, too, as we discovered this afternoon.  The glaze is nice and tangy.

Fabulous recipe! I am not a huge fan of meatloaf, at least I WASN'T, until I made this! My family loves this recipe. Thank you for sharing it.

Fantastic!  I absolutely loved the brown sugar and ketchup glaze.  I've never enjoyed meatloaf more.  I wil definately make this again... my boyfriend liked it so much, he made sandwiches out of the leftovers.

This was good, a little different taste to it with the lemon added, but I think I like my mom's old fashioned meatloaf a little better.

Excellent meatloaf. Easy to make. I have been searching for a meatloaf recipe which would be easy to make and taste delicious and this one fits the bill on both counts. I love the sauce. I did change the recipe to a light turkey rather than beef. I thought it was delicious with the turkey.

My children enjoyed making and eating this meatloaf (don't let the little ones mix the meat, just the other stuff).  For fun we made them in cupcake tins (cook for 45 minutes) and added a little bulk sausage (jimmy dean).  I didn't have beef bouillon so I seasoned the meat really well and added worcestershire sauce and everyone loved it.

This recipe was just okay for me. I have had better. Although the sauce was great, there wasn't enough. My family kept adding more ketchup after it was on their plate.

This was probably the best meatloaf I ever made.  It was moist and delicious!  My family loved it and wanted me to put it in my recipe box so I wouldn't forget.  I did double the sauce as others suggested.  Thanks Delia!

Since meatloaf is one of my husband's favorite meal, I was a little hesitant about making it for his picky tastebuds.  It turned out a success, despite not having beef bouillon on hand.
Will make again!

This meatloaf is delicious.  I will definately make this recipe again.  I added a little bit of barbecue sauce to it, and the meatloaf came out wonderful.

This was great! I left out the bouillon (didn't have it on hand) and upped the lemon juice. Perfect. No one asked for ketchup - the true test!

I thought this was interesting and the taste was good but I don't think it is something I would choose to make again.  I am a traditionalist when it comes to meatloaf, I guess.

Meatloaf was very good.  My husband enjoyed it a little more than I.  The glaze is what makes this different from most meatloaf recipes.  I did not double the glaze which was a mistake. It was so good I think next time I will.  I did however substitute the 2 pounds of ground beef to 1 lb. grd. beef and 1 lb. grd. pork which makes any meatloaf tastier.

This meatloaf was great.  I did not have any beef bouillon; I used McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning instead.  I also microwaved it first and then baked it in the over for 12 min. after putting on the ketchup mixture on top.

This recipe is just amazing!  I tried it exactly as shown and was astonished at how good it was.  Next time I will add some cracked black pepper and perhaps some chipotle to kick it up.  I served it with lyonnaise potatoes and baby carrots in a buttery brown sugar sauce.  Great meal!

This was good, but I jazzed it up by adding chopped jalepenos and used crackers instead of bread. But the glaze and adding beef boullion as the recipe suggests really makes the meatloaf great!

This meatloaf was only okay - but I did change some things.  First, I cut the amount of beef in half as I was only cooking for two people, but I made the full amount of glaze (and a good thing I did too).  Instead of adding chopped onion, I used a package of Lipton onion soup mix.  I also did not add sliced bread (broken up), I used bread crumbs and I didn't realize that I was out of eggs, so I didn't add one of those either.  I thought the loaf sounded a bit bland, so I added about 1 tbsp of worcesteshire sauce and 2 tbsp of soya sauce.  Althought the sauce was good (on top of the loaf), we didn't find that it added much flavour to the meat itself.  There are other meatloaf recipes on this site that are much better than this one I'm afraid (ie Brown Sugar Meatloaf).

I really am not a fan of meat loaf but this is a favorite in our house!  My 2 year old loves the sweet glaze and my husband loves it the next day in a meatloaf sandwich.  I use 25 saltine crackers instead of the bread.  Freezes beautifully!  I just mix up and put in pan, then thaw and bake as directed.  Super easy meal!

The best meatloaf I ever had.  I had to give it an extra 10 minutes to cook thru. However, I followed the recipe to the letter and got a wonderful meal.  Served with twice baked potatoes w/ side of gravy. Also calico corn.

A very moist and flavorful meatloaf. I added some pepper but no salt because the beef bouillon is salty enough. Pretty good but everyone at our house was unanimous in preferring my regular meatloaf recipe. Really nice for a change though. Thanks Delia!

This was pretty yummy. My meatloaf recipes always come out different and kinda bland and disappointing. The glaze really made this stand out. My husband is'nt a big fan of meatloaf but this recipe made him go "mmm" a lot at dinner.I cut this down to 3 servings and put it in bell peppers. There almost was'nt enough glaze, will make more next time. I also cut back on the sugar, it probably would have been too sweet with the amount called for. Thanks for sharing!

This was superb!  I normally don't eat red meat, but my husband asked for it, so I made it.  I decided to try it and thought it tasted great.  My husband had seconds and has already planned for meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.  Very simple to make, but after letting glaze cook for 10 minutes I broiled on low for just a minute or so because the 10 minutes didn't seem long enough.  Thanks for the recipe Delia.

This was the best meatloaf that I've had & actually made.  The glaze is what made it a hit for me.  I substituted the beef bouillon cubes with 1 package of meatloaf seasoning, and I added chopped green peppers.

This was pretty good, It was moist and tasty.  I forgot to put the bouillon, and it seemed fine without it.  I put the glaze on from the beginning of cooking, I like it to really be cooked on.  It was great that way.

Didn't seem to have lemon juice, so I omitted it.  Also added some Parmasean cheese to the meat mixture.  Was great! No leftovers!  The mustard powder really made a difference in my opinion.

WOW- this is good stuff. I have almost givin up on making meatloaf. Then i tried this. I only used 1 lb. ground beef. But i added all the lemon juice. It was very very moist. Next time i will half the lemon. But it was still the best meatloaf i ever had. I cant imagine how good it wouldve been had i only added half the lemon.My 5yr old complained until she tried it, she finished all of it. I added minced garlic and salt n peppper. I will be making this again very soon!! Thank you, Thank you!!!

This meatloaf was GREAT!!  It was moist and the glaze is very tasty.  This is definitely a keeper!!  The only adjustment I made was substituting 1 cup of plain bread crumbs for the slices of bread.  Also, the next time I make it, I will probably double the glaze so that there is extra for dipping. Yummy!!!

This meatloaf with its fantastic glaze is addicting. I added a small amount of chopped green pepper. I also bordered with some sautéed mushrooms after baking was completed. I also used the ground pork and beef mix made for meatloaf. I accompanied mash potatoes, green beans with almonds and a spinach/argula salad with vinegrette dressing. Great meal!

I do not care for beef at all but I keep it on the menu to appease the rest of my family.  I have to say, this meatloaf actually made me ENJOY eating it!  It had wonderful flavor.  Next time I think I will double the glaze mixture because I liked it so much!

I like the glaze but the meatloaf itself lacked something.  I think I'll try adding worcestershire sauce and some onion soup mix next time.  My family seemed to like it well enough and I'll make it again, but not without experimenting.

The glaze/sauce gives this meatloaf flavor.  I added various spices, another egg and used bread crumbs.  I'd like to find a meatloaf recipe that has lots of flavor in the meat portion of it so I'll be trying other recipes.  But this one is a very good basic one.
