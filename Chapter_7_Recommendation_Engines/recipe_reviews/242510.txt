This was fun.  I left out the breadcrumbs and the cheeses (personal preference). I used brown rice and red quinoa and avocado oil. This tasted really good and I will be making variations of this again. Something wasn't right for me with the dressing...i will play around with it to make it my own.
Thanks for the recipe.

Adding the rice , apples and cheese really makes this hearty. I didn't have hemp or flax seeds, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. I'd make this again, next time I have leftover wild rice.
