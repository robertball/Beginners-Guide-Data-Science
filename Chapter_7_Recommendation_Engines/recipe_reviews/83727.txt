So easy and so good.  The only thing I did different was used real onion halved and sliced thin instead of the onion powder.

I would this a 10 if I could. This was the best I have ever had. I made it with hope that it would be similar to the Clearmans Northwoods recipe. It was even better.  I will make this over and over, I just finished a batch last night and I am ready to make more.

This is my favorite red cabbage recipe.  I make it pretty much as is, I guess a bit on the oil and vinegar, and I use Lawry's Seasoning Salt for the salt. It is sooo good. I end up eating half of it out of the bowl before it even gets served for a meal.

I substituted all of the salt and seasoned salt with garlic salt and reduced the oil to about 1/4 cup and up the vinegar to 1 cup to make it lighter and it was delicious!!  This really is something that only improves as it sits in the refrigerator.  It is a great thing to make on Sunday and eat with your lunchs all week long.  This is something that really fills me up, and tastes indulgent.  Sprinkled with the tiniest bit of gorgonzola cheese this becomes a decadent treat!!

Pretty good.  I used balsamic vinegar instead of the wine vinegar and added a little garlic powder.  Nice and simple taste.

Simple and delicious. I cut it in half, diced a small onion and added 1/4 cup of crumbled blue cheese. Thanks.

This is a very good recipe! The only thing that I changed was to add more salt, pepper and vinegar, given that I didn't think that there was enough of those ingredients. It also got better as it sat in the fridge and melded flavors :)

I can't believe that such a simple recipe produces such a tasty side dish. This is a great way to use up extra cabbage, it's a very summery recipe. No cooking so perfect for hot weather. At first I though it would need something like carrots or broccoli but it is perfect EXACTLY as written.

Easy and it tastes great. I used a real onion thinly sliced as some of the other reviewers did. I didn't have seasoned salt but did have celery salt which worked fine. I added an extra glug of red wine vinegar for some more tart zip. I will make this again.

It was a tasty easy salad to make. I added some thinly sliced onions, and I made it also with some shredded carrots for colour and variety. I used balsamic but the colour doesn't look as nice as when using a clear vinegar.

There is this famous steak house that serves a red cabbage salad I was craving, so I decided to try this recipe out. Although it's not exactly the same, it was still quite good.

I made this as a side dish on St. Patrick's Day for my family. They thought it was good (of course my kid's weren't interested not for young people) anyways it was good something different and not just the same ole cooked red cabbage with apples kind of recipe. May possibly make this in the future with some changes.

This was fabulous, even though I made some minor alterations. 1.  I used only 1/4 cup oil, as others mentioned.   2.  I didn't have any seasoned salt, and I don't like to add a lot of salt to my food, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon basil and 1/4 teaspoon celery seed instead. 3.  We like onions, so as others mentioned I added about 1/4 of an onion, sliced thin on the mandolin along with the cabbage.  Next time I'll add a full half.  Even so, the taste was awesome, starting immediately after making it (not even waiting 8 hours), then multiple times over the next week.  Will DEFINITELY make again!

Very nice taste. I love a lot of sauce/marinade in my coleslaw, so I tripled the sauce. I also chopped up a medium sized sweet onion instead of using the onion powder and I omitted the seasoned salt as I didn't have any.  Any time I went into the fridge, I took the slaw out and stirred it around to coat all of the cabbage.  This is such a refreshing change from your normal coleslaw. This is a keeper!

Totally delicious. It gets even better the longer it sits. Skip the onion powder and add a thinly sliced onion instead. So yummy!

I bought a bag of shredded red cabbage on sale at the store so this is the recipe I decided to use with it. I halved the recipe.  I enjoyed the flavor but next time I would add a little less oil. I would prefer a little bit stronger taste of vinegar and spices and a less oily texture. My husband added more black pepper to his. Overall, a good recipe though. Thanks!

This is a GREAT recipe! If you increase the sugar amount to 3 tablespoons and grate (not dice) 1/2 of a large sweet onion instead of onion powder it will be EXACTLY like the salad at the restaurant I go to to get this. As others have noted - this is definitely a make ahead dish. A whole day or two is not too long!

I made it as written the first time and the vinegar was just way too much for my family.  The vinegar seemed to get stronger as each day passed - and I love red wine vinegar, just not here.  The next time I made it I cut back the vinegar a great deal, and made other adjustments as suggested by others reducing the oil as well and adding carrots. Lovely colors but the family still gives it a thumbs down.

After a trip to Europe where I ate a lot of red cabbage, I searched for red cabbage recipes and found this one. I've made this recipe twice and followed the recipe as written both times for the most part--didn't have any onion powder but didn't miss it. Like one of the reviewers said, the longer it sits, the better it gets! Also, if you aren't going to eat all of it at once, I think it's a good idea to reserve the liquid after you drain it and let the cabbage that's leftover sit in it until you're ready to serve it again. Thanks so much for a recipe that was exactly what I was looking for!

EXACTLY what I was looking for! Sweet, tangy, spicy YUM!
I used balsamic vinegar as well as Grapeseed oil.  I omitted the extra salt and added a teaspoon of lemon pepper instead.  I will make this over and over and over...

When i took my Grandma to Clearmans  Northwoods Inn i was a vegetarian, so i ate side dishes. I loved there red cabbage salad. Our newspaper had a column where you could request recipes. A reader sent in this recipe, the only thing i did different was reduce the sugar. A reviewer mentioned using thinly sliced onions so i tried it and will make it this way from now on, so thanks.

Awesome and so easy.  There is NO such thing as too much vinegar but I did reduce the oil.  I also prefer stronger flavours so added some balsamic to the red wine vinegar.  As other reviewers have said, I am having difficulty staying away from it and may have to make more for dinner.  Perfect right away and probably awesome after more time.  My suggestion, make some to put in the fridge and keep some out for yourself. :)

I made this tonight and it was really great. I added some grated carrots, celery and green onions to the salad and it was very flavourful. The only change I would make next time would be to add a little less oil.

Yummy, but I would say it's most flavorful when it's fresh, not after sitting in the refrigerator. My second crew of tastees felt like it got too mushy sitting in the fridge. I added shredded carrots as well. it's so colorful!

This was an easy recipe and gave a great change of pace for our salad/vegetable offerings around here.  I didn't have any regular seasoned salt but had the spicy hot blend.  It gave it a nice **KICK** and loved it!

Very good! As other reviewers suggested, I used real onion instead of powdered. Also threw in some raisins and sprinkled walnuts on top before serving.

This was so flavorful and now a favorite.  I made a few modifications, used balsamic and added slivers of onion and fennel since I had it on hand.  Thanks!!

Who knew that something so simple would be so delicious?!  This is addictive!  Like someone else suggested, I added thinly sliced onions and it turned out real tasty.

Made it for the first time exactly as is - just let it sit for one day, THEN decide if you want to add anything else - it is perfect. The second time just for creativity's sake,  I added 2 shredded carrots and white onions for colour and just a splash of balsamic vinegar so it didnt overwhelm the taste. THANK YOu - great healthy recipe.

Made as indicated with exception of red wine vinegar (didn't have), used rice wine seasoning instead and got nervous. Also didn't shred, rather roughly chopped. Turned out very well! Was not overwhelmed by the flavor, thus the 4 stars, but it definitely gets better the longer it sits. Also, grabbed for these leftovers in place of less-healthy snack at nighttime and it really hit the spot!

I made this recipe exactly as stated.  I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and drained the liquid before serving it.  No one (out of 8 people) could eat it.  I tried to think of a way to "salvage" it by adding something or using it somehow in another recipe, but could not.  I had to throw it all out.  I was disappointed (and surprised) since I normally enjoy recipes with such high ratings.

This was excellent! It sounds really simple, but the flavor will really surprise you. I made it as written, except I added a little garlic powder to the dressing. I also added a few thinly sliced carrots, dried cranberries, and some feta cheese because it was in danger of spoiling soon. Even without these additions, the salad would be perfect. However, it's also easily adaptable to whatever you have on hand.

I've been looking for some time for a recipe like this one, which is in a vinagrette and is not sweet like the more popular recipe. I had something like it when I was a kid and my grandparents took me to a restaurant that served this. It made an impression! And this is exactly how I remember it. Thank you!

Simple and really tasty.  I found myself addicted to it the first day and couldn't stop eating it, but I admit that the recipe yields so much that I was sick of it the next day.  Next time I'll cut it in half :)

I followed the recipe exactly.  I was looking for a new way to add more vegetable to my family's diet. I wasn't really crazy about this.  Pretty, but very strong vinegar taste.Might be better if the dressing were cut in half. Might be better served with Kielbasa or the like.

Excellent!  I love putting red cabbage in my salad, but never thought to make it the main ingredient!  Everyone loved it.  Instead of using all the ingredients for the dressing, I just used an envelop of Good Seasons and used extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar.  The best, thanks for the idea!!

I've bought this salad at a popular steakhouse for many years...
I now prepare it at home following this recipe.
I use a little less vinegar,diced onions and a splash more of canola oil.
you may have to "tweek" a bit until it works for you,don't give up on it if your first batch is not perfect...

I like some of the other reviewers added bleu cheese and then sprinkled on some chopped hazlenuts for extra crunch.  It was amazing!  Served it with baked beans and bbq chicken with fried okra.  Would definitely make it again!

It turned out really good! I made small changes. I used half of the sugar, less of the oil, added dijon mustad to the dressing and used thin sliced onions instead of powder. Delish!

I love this recipe. Just add garlic and you get the Italian version. I skipped the seasoned salt, just did not think it needed it. I followed the entire recipe backwards, worked out well. ;-)

I just made this--not sure how its supposed to taste.  Didnt have canola oil so I used virgin oil. Cant find seasoning salt here (Mexico) so I used a tad of Tajin (which has a tiny bit of lime flavor).  Guess I'll know how it is in 8 hours!!!  I cut the recipe in half.  We love cabbage so I'm sure it'll be great!

All I tasted was vinegar and seasoned salt (not a good combo). Giving it 2 stars instead of 1 to allow for the possibility of user error.  :)

loved it!!!! I replaced sugar with honey and I did not put any onion powder in it. Next time I will try and put slices of onion.

I like it a lot but it's missing something.  Can't put my finger on it. Started out without the onion powder but really improved the flavor once I added it. It's a good side dish when you want something different.

Very good recipe for red cabbage. I used half the amount of oil though.

Not what I was expecting. The cabbage was too crunchy after letting it sit all night and the seasoning was a little too strong for us.

I love this salad. I have made it for several years now. I will say, I prefer the salad on day 2 or day 3. I never feel like it is quite ready after just 24 hours of marinating.

I decided to add a little more sweetness with a few cranberries, I could have also used a few raisins.   I happened to have a pomegranate so I threw some of the pomegranate seeds in for some varied texture and a burst of flavor.

Absolutely delicious. I substituted the Canola oil for Sesame Seed Oil and I used 4 tablespoons of sugar instead of one.

I'll give it a three for possible 'operator error,' but I followed the recipe and didn't find it very good.   The seasoning salt dominates.  Will try to salvage it by eating on sandwiches. I'll stick with the Mayo Free Cabbage Salad recipe from this site from now on!

As others suggested I only used 1/4 c oil.

I didn't have red wine vinegar so used balsamic. Didn't have onion powder so used 1/4 onion. Had no seasoned salts so omitted that.
 So much better the next day and subsequent days. 

Next time will try with some garlic power and see how it tastes. 
Could add carrots too.

This is definitely flavorful, but I found it a little too sharp (maybe it was my vinegar?). I added some more sugar to temper that. I also cut the oil in half - no need for so much.

Very good, fresh flavor! I served with brats.  I changed the basic recipe slightly.  I added about 1/2 cup chopped onion rather than the onion powder; instead of regular salt, I used 1/2 seasoned salt and 1/2 garlic salt; added white pepper to give it some zing; and used Truvia blend (1/2 sugar, 1/2 stevia) to reduce calories a bit.  I reserved half of the slaw and added chopped apple and golden raisins to serve the next day with pork roast (different guests!) and it was very good, too.  I will be making this again.

I did not add sugar or onion power since I hate onions and it is imperative to finely shred or use a mandolin on the cabbage.

Very good and kept in the fridge for 5 days and was even better.  I did use olive oil not canola and also balsamic vinegar.  It was the best.

This is a great dressing. I left out the sugar because I like cabbage salad to be tart. I used green cabbage and carrots.

The comment that it gets better after it sits longer is definitely true I think. Wasn't real wild about it after 24 hours in fridge but liked it better after 48 hours in fridge. I good addition to my collection of coleslaw recipes.

Very easy and tasty. Just didnt give it 5 stars because it isnt very pretty for a salad as it is only red cabbage... so not for a party but good for every day.
