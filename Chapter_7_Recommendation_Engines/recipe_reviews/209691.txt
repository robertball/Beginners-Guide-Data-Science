This is soooo good! So simple to prepare, yet it looks and tastes like it took a lot of time and effort. I did reduce the seasoned salt to 1/2 teapoon because of a lot of reviews that said it was salty and I think it was perfect. Also, I didn't bother to pre cook the bacon out of laziness, lol, but it cooked up fine in the oven. Other than that I kept everything the same. I will definately be using this recipe again.....and again-YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was easy to make and was a huge hit at Christmas eve, 18 folks enjoyed and could not believe the flavor. Instead of browning the meat in frying pan, used my panini press and seared, placed on cookie sheet and baked for 40 min. the best!

This is delicious! It makes a good presentation, as it looks like filet mignon, yet much cheaper. I cooked until brown in the skillet, then finished in the oven. Cooking the pork in the bacon drippings keeps it tender and very tasty. My husband commented that it was the best pork he has ever eaten!!

This pork was so tender it was like eating a filet.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  I only browned mine for 2 minutes on medium high and then put in the oven for 17 minutes.  The were perfect.  Not exactly a healthy choice, but a tasty one!

Great recipe, followed recipe until they were to go in the skillet. I brushed them with an olive oil and butter mixture and placed them on the highest shelf in my gas barbecue for about 30 min or until my meter read an internal meat temp of 145. ChuckT

Wow!  Made it yesterday and will put this on my rotation.  The only thing that I modified was just using regular salt as opposed to seasoned salt.  The pork can out juicy and nicely seasoned.  Since I like my pork still a little pink I cooked for 17 minutes after having cooked the medallions for four minutes per side as per the recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!  My family loved it!

For those of you who dont know,,pork tenderloin IS the filet of the pork..this is why it is so tender..When i cook pork, i like the typical pork seasoning, rosemary and thyme along with salt and pepper and garlic or garlic powder

My husband said these were good enough to serve in a resturant. They were really good. I did omit the seasoned salt since the bacon has so much in it to begin with. I dont think the seasoned salt was necessary. Very Good Recipe. Thanks

The recipe as written is good.  Omited the butter & seared the pork in the bacon dripping's.  One thing to remember,  if you use a marinated loin DON'T USE ANY SALT !!  I didn't read the other review's and used a pepper and garlic marinated loin....it was sooooo salty!  Will know better the next time,  and there will be a next time !

If I could give this 10 stars I would. I've made this recipe twice and I think it's one of my favorites on this site. I usually double it though, so we can have leftovers. It's even more amazing the day after. I wrapped the tenderloin with the bacon, sliced it, then sprinkled with the spices. I didn't cook the bacon before hand, just used it straight out of the package. I brown them on both sides (about 3 minutes), then put it on a baking sheet. I poured the bacon fat and butter remnants over the pork, then bake it for about 20 minutes. Yum!!!! I served this with the kicked up mac & cheese, also on this site. They were both a huge hit!

Great recipe for pork tenderloin! Next time I will not use the full amount of butter and olive oil as written because it was dripping with a butter/oil/fat mixture. I will also try different types of bacon (i.e. hickory maple, smoked, etc.) to see if it gives it that extra flavor kick.

Good but not great.  I did everything as directed but the meat took too long to cook.  The taste was just okay.  Probably won't make again just because there are so many better things to find on Allrecipes.com

OMG, these are amazing.  Seriously.  The one suggestion I have is to flip them halfway through the time in the oven...10 minutes on one side, 10 on the other.  If you like bacon, make these!!

This is crazy delicious!! and so easy! I made it pretty much as written, except I did end up running out of the spice mixture, so some of them had garlic salt and italian seasoning mix on them. I also used a smoked sea salt in the seasoning mix. Seriously, so easy. the most work is put into cooking the bacon in the beginning. I am excited to use this recipe with beef tenderloin as well!

LOVED IT!
Added a little onion powder to the mixture and instead of using the  butter mixture to brown them I used the bacon grease (it was right there and ready to go). My husband said I out did myself on this one!:)

As an add on: I made a Blue Cheese Chive Butter to go on top! YUMMY!!

Very easy to make and delicious. I usually don't like pork because it comes out too dry, but this was moist and flavorful. My whole family loved it and asked me to make it again.

Oustanding!  I made the decision not to precook the bacon before wrapping it around the pork to save some time.  I also left out the butter when browning in the skillet.  I didn't have an oven safe skillet so I transfered the medallions into a baking dish.  Baked them for about 20 minutes and then threw them under the broiler for a couple minutes to crisp up the bacon.  These were very tender and so flavorful!  A gourmet dish without a lot of work!

Fantastic recipe, my family just loved these.  Not sure whether there really was any need to pre cook the bacon, next time I think I will just wrap it straight around the pork with out this step.  Also they were just a little salty, again I think in future I will either reduce the salt or leave it out completely.  I found that 2 minutes on each side was enough to brown the bacon wrapped pork before putting in the oven.  For the oven I increased the cook time to 25 minutes, these were cooked to perfection.  So tasty for such a simple recipe.

Seriously a little pork on pork action? HOW can you go wrong? I made this for my family for valentines day. I changed the preparation a tad. Wrapped the pork with bacon and secured it with a toothpick, then dust it with the seasoning mixture. Sear pork on both sides in a hot pan till browned on both sides(about 4 mins. each side). Place each piece on a baking sheet aknd cook in the preheated oven for about 25 mins. till cooked through.

Absolutely as good as others reviewers stated. I reduced the salt to half as recommended. I've never ventured outside of doing pork tenderloin in a slow cooker before. This is a keeper. My preschooler and toddler both asked for more "chicken" till it was all gone.

declicious, but probably not worth the time and trouble to make, on a regular basis. Took more than an hour of work, and I'd rather spend my time on desserts!
Update Dec 2016: again, delicious, but just not worth the time and effort this recipe takes.

Very good!  I didn't have garlic powder, so I crushed some garlic instead.  I also didn't use the seasoned salt (bacon is salty enough).

Very good!  We all loved it.  My daughter snatched the last little bit before the rest of us could get to it.  We eliminated the basil and added sage, just because that's what we like on pork.  Served with fried rice.  Will definitely be making this again!

Hands down the best pork tenderloin I have ever prepared.  Only changes I made were adding some coarse seat salt to herbs and I pan seared the bacon wrapped & herbed pork in bacon grease on both sides and then transferred to oven to bake.  Melt in my mouth delicious and 5 stars from my boyfriend.  This is a winner all around.

I make this recipe to the "T" except I use Pork Ribeye steaks and this is the best recipe I have ever made! Better than a filet mignon...It is going to be Christmas dinner this year! Thanks for sharing!

My family loved this meal! I did not precook the bacon. When the pork was almost cooked, I laid the pork so the bacon was up and broiled on high, rotating often until the bacon was nice and crisp. Only took 3-4 minutes. I will make this often!

WOW these were amazing!  Super easy and fancy enough to serve at a party but also quick enough to serve during the week.  I used a nice thick Amish bacon and was amazed how good it was.  Keeper for sure!

Made this for my mom's birthday. Used all ingredients in instructions the only change that I did was I grilled the pork.  It was fantastic.  Got rave reviews. Excellent

Very good, but I will cut back on the seasoning next time as it was a little salty for me.  But it was certainly easy to prepare and yet elegant enough for a special meal.   We used Jamaican bacon, and I imagine maple bacon would be fantastic too.  DH requested au gratin potatoes, but that seemed to heavy as a side.  Might go with a light rice dish next time.  And there will be a next time!

Another family favourite!  I prepared the medallions/bacon, assembling with toothpicks, in the morning and seasoned both sides of the medallions.  I added the bacon grease to the medallions and refrigerated until I needed them.  Prepared exactly as instructed by searing in butter and olive oil (and added some of the bacon grease) for 4 minutes each side.  Then baked in the oven until the medallions were no longer pink.  Took longer than the estimated time, only because my medallions were thicker than the suggested size.  Fantastic flavour!!!!

This was really good. The meat was amazingly tender. I read the reviews first and changed a few things just to my taste but I will definitely make this again. I also made this in a cast iron pan so that I could just transfer the whole thing to the oven. I also cooked it in the bacon drippings and used thyme and rosemary but that is just a taste thing.  It was very quick and easy.

Was expecting more based on the reviews.  I found it to be a lot of work for the end result.  Tasty enough, but not a major thrill.

These were delish! Made them for Christmas and everyone loved them. I don't have a cast iron skillet so I seared them in a pan, then put them in a glass baking dish with a little chiken broth and butter to bake in the oven. I cooked them a bit longer to get them to well done-170 degrees.

This is great! I followed this recipe as written although I did cook the bacon just a few minutes before wrapping it around the medallions. The meat was so full of flavor and moist. I am not a big pork eater but this has convinced me that it can be wonderful if prepared properly.

Fantastic! I did, however, change things up just a bit. I omitted the salt and also the butter and just cooked the medallions in the bacon fat and about 1 tbsp of olive oil. I also substituted rosemary and thyme for the basil and oregano and used about 1 tbsp of each. Will for sure make again! Maybe next time I will serve with a side of Bearnaise!

My prep time was 20 minutes, but well worth it.  The only changes to the recipe was flipping the medallions, in the oven pan, about half-way through the oven process or eight minutes left in the process, in line-item 4 of the directions, and used pre-cooked thick sliced smokey bacon (12 per roast).  Also, I would recommend changing the serving quantity to 6, just to serve three people, with three medallions each, and some left-over or lunch, the next day.  I would also recommend, as side dishes: baked sliced apples, a side dish of mixed veggies or warm pasta salad, with veggies.  Outside of a great meal, clean-up was a snap!

YUM!  This definatley pleased the hubby!  However, I made the following alterations: 1lb Pork Tenderloin, OMMITTED Garlic Powder, 1/2t Seasoning Salt, 1/2t Basil, 1/2t Oregano, 1/4C Grated Parmesean.  Cooked bacon according to directions.  OMITTED the butter & oil and just used the reserved bacon drippings.  I coated the bacon wrapped tenderlions as instructed, quick pan fried them in the reserved bacon drippings.  I DID NOT have a cast iron skillet so what I did was place the quick fried tenderloins on a wire rack ontop of a baking sheet.  Popped that in the oven for about 15-20 minutes and the wire rack allowed for any excess grease to drip down and off onto the baking sheet.  Very good recipe!  Will definatley be adding this to the menu rotation :o)

My family couldn't stop raving about how good this recipe is! They hardly say that about anything I make them. I guess this one's a keeper. 

My only change to the recipe is to pour a little bit of white wine in the skillet to deglaze it before baking.

This was ok, little too salty for us but that might be because I browned the medallions in the bacon drippings instead of oil/butter like the recipe directed.   I found myself craving the maple flavor others mentioned in their reviews, so I will try that next time.  The salt issue was likely my own doing, however, I only used half of the directed seasoned salt amount, so I don't know...

Just made this last night. Cooked perfectly, and I like parts of the recipe but my husband and I found the flavors too strong. My husband also mentioned he would like some kind of cream sauce or a marinade to go with the recipe- just a thought for anyone interested. Overall I will not be making this recipe again, but it did give me the inspiration for my own rendition. I hope my comments help!

I made this for my family and they loved it.  One tip I could offer is to use the extra thick bacon.  The normal stuff is harder to work with.  I cooked the medallions for about 3m/side on #4 setting, put them in the oven for 12mins and they came out amazing.

I was not very fond of this recipe.  I think that the cook time is too long and you probably should use fresh herbs and garlic instead of dried.  I followed this recipe exactly as written.  If I ever try it again, I will use fresh ingredients and decrease the cooking time in the oven.  Heck, I might not even put it in the oven...just finish cooking right on top of the stove!

good, I'd make it again. I brushed it with dijon mustard on top and bottom so garlic powder, basil, oregano, thyme, some breadcrumbs, and pinch of salt would stay put. 4 minutes in each side on the stove is way too long it burns. And mine were very thick and got a little overcooked in the oven, I'd say probably 19 or so minutes, maybe more oil/chicken broth/ or white whine next time!

One of the best pork recipes I've found.  These turned out tender and very flavorful.  I left out the salt because my tenderloin was already marinated, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Used an iron skillet.  I will be making these again and again!  Thank you for sharing.

Really good.  I did use sage and Rosemary as another reviewer suggested.  I think my tenderloin was too big, had to cut each piece in half and they were still large and super thick.  Had to cook twice the amount of time to get to 145 degrees.  Very good recipe though!

Really tasty pork!  I would make this for company. I tried to make it without par-cooking the bacon, and only the top edges crisped up. Next time I'll follow directions without taking a shortcut.

We all enjoyed this, but next time, I will not bother pre-cooking the bacon as it was too difficult to work with. I didn't have oregano & basil on hand, but Italian seasoning did the trick. 4 minutes per side was too long for the browning - next time I'll do 2 minutes per side and see what happens!  Love the idea though - thanks for sharing!

This recipe is so good and is simple to prepare.  Not to mention, only one dirty pan!  It looks and tastes like a much more complicated dish.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this as directed. It did have a decent flavor but, in my opinion, was too greasy. Pork tenderloin is a delicious cut of juicy, lean meat. It just seems a shame to bury its flavor in a recipe like this.

Very easy to put together though I didn't wrap the whole thing in bacon first. I tried but wasn't looking very pretty so I just sliced the tenderloin in even slices and then wrapped. I was lucky that my bacon was the exact length I needed to go around each medallion. I liked the seasonings, I like the cooking method (though I overcooked the tenderloin a bit). I served this over mash potatoes and gravy with a side of asparagus.

This was great. I kept the bacon grease and browned the pork in that, it was a little low so I added butter. I added bread cumbs to the seasoning. I covered the pork in Dijon mustard then rolled it in the bread cumbs seasoning mix, added bacon and in the pan, then into the oven. It is a keeper!! Nothing could be better mustard bacon and pork!!

Thank you Eve for this wonderful recipe.  I didn't find Old Bay seasoning so I made my own with garlic, Italian seasoning, red pepper, and chopped onion.  It turned out wonderfully.  Also I used Maple flavored bacon.  OMG such a great flavor combination.  Thank you again for this recipe.  Will be using it again.

Made these for a dinner party, they were a big hit & so easy! Everyone wanted the recipe. Pre-cooking the bacon was unnecessary and if it gets too crispy its hard to work with. I will skip that step next time.

This was an easy and tasty recipe.  I skipped the pre-browning the bacon step, and while it wasn't raw, it wasn't overly crispy either.  Regardless, my pork turned out nice and moist!

I'm giving this a five star rating!  I loved it, my kids loved it (wonders will never cease!) and my husband raved about it!!  Finally, a pork dish my kids don't freak out about.  It was easy and very tasty.  I transferred it to a casserole because my skillet can't go in the oven.  I also didn't use the butter/olive oil to brown the medallions, I just used the bacon fat.  Excellent!  Thank you so much for recipe :-)

This recipe is excellent. I did change it up a bit.  I eliminated the seasoned salt and used Penzeys Greek seasoning along with McCormicks mexican oregano, garlic powder, and dried basil. I also cooked the pork in the bacon grease. My husband said it was good enough to serve in a 5 star restaurant. I plan on serving it at my next dinner party.

This was very tasty, but the next time I make it, I'm going to cut the pork into tenderloins before wraping the bacon around them, and you need about 4 tooth picks evenly spaced around the tenderloins, just break the picks in half, so you don't have to use more. Good recipe.

This was very easy and so delicious.  The pork came out perfectly, nice and moist and not overcooked.  I loved the rub and will be using it on other pork cuts.  Looking forward to making this for some family that is coming next week.

Fantastic!  Made exactly as is, and then drizzled with a balasmic reduction.  Served over a simple risotto with roasted asparagus.  My husband said it was a home run, and I've now finally learned a way to cook pork that he will eat!  10 stars all the way!

I seasoned the pork all over before wrapping in bacon.  Added evoo  to the skillet and then seared the thick cut peppercorn bacon all the way around finishing with the  cut ends.  After resting the medallions were perfectly done.

Delicious!  I followed the instructions exactly as written except I used all olive oil and no butter.  Would definitely make this again.  Even my husband said that although he doesn't usually like straight pork tenderloin, this was really good!  Even our 4-year-old daughter ate it!

I followed the recipe exactly, so I'm pretty sure my one complaint is really my fault. The bacon just didn't seem to "fit." I used a smoked maple bacon, and I found it to be too sweet. It made the whole taste of the pork seem off. It also did not quite crisp up enough for my liking. I think I will cook longer in the pan next time. I cooked for about 5-6 minutes longer than suggested, and they were still super tender!

These were great and looked very fancy!  I had never hadnled a pork tenderloin before and it was too big with both parts to be circled by one piece of bacon.  Once I could see that there were really two parts, one piece was good.  The herb crust went really well and cooked up nicely.  From the picture I had assumed that flour would be the base but there was plenty and the dried oregano and basil make a nice color complement.  I served it with parmesan risoto and a green salad and it was a big hit.  I would definately make it again now that I'm a little more comfortable with the cut of meat.  Tip - don't be afraid to use lots of toothpicks!

I made this for a small family gathering...WHAT A HIT!!!  I did what others suggested and completely omitted the salt.  The bacon has enough salt for this recipe.  I thought it might be easier to cut the porkinto mediallons first and then wrap, but that turned out to be a messy undertaking.  Next time I will wrap the whole pork first and then cut.  I served with mashed sweet potatotes and green beans sauted with garlic in a small amount of the bacon grease and garlic bread.  The reactions to this meal made me feel like a rock star!!!

Quite tasty although next time I'll cook by the temperature and not the cook time - mine were overcooked.  but still a great dish and would be great company food.  WE served with asparagus and yukon golds (baked in the microwave).  Next time we'll use less seasoning salt as it was salty with the bacon.

I have cooked many recipes from this site.....this is probably one of the BEST so far!!!!  Super simple and elegant enough for company.  The pork was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  I followed the recipe as printed and can't wait to serve it again.  Hubby LOVED it!

i only gave 4 stars because it was way too salty for me but it was very juicy and tender.  will definitely cook again, just maybe half the season salt next time.

Made this last night for dinner, was so good and fast to make. I made just as written, after reading the reviews and making it myself, I would brown in the bacon drippings and then bake pork in a different baking dish and also would add less salt. It was so tendor and the favors were just great

Made this for Christmas Eve family gathering. Not one piece leftover. My picky teenager who won't touch pork chops loved this and asked if we could make it again.

This is fantastic.  It is so flavorful. I wondered about 1T garlic powder, but it was perfect. As others suggested, I used half the amount of seasoned salt and I wouldn’t have wanted more. I had thick sliced bacon and there were 10 pieces, so I had 10 medallions.  It got done faster as a result.  About 10 min in oven and it was at 145 F. The rest of dinner was not ready so I turned the oven off and had the door ajar for ten minutes and it was just right. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe was awesome, I fried the medallions in a mixture of the bacon grease and butter and double wrapped them in bacon for a less healthy but tastier option.

Excellent recipe. We did not want to light the oven so after the initial 5-minute cooking time to brown each side, we lowered the temperature on the stove top and finished the cooking there. It worked fine.

I would make again only with adjustments to time and temp. After browning in a med. skillet, 17 minutes in a 400º oven is much too much time. First batch came out at 178º!  Tried it again at 350º for 12 minutes...perfect!

We just tried this and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars  is that it would have been way too salty if I'd followed the recipe exactly. Other then that thumbs up all the way around the table even the 9 year old!

Delicious base recipe! I order bacon wrapped pork fillets in bulk from Zaycon Foods. Overnight marination, since we like center flavor. Instead of cooking the bacon separately, I cooked the bacon on the fillet, using tongs to turn. Cooked in a casserole dish with the butter/olive/bacon mixture for 15 minutes. Juicy and apparently delicious since it's gone and I didn't get any....

This was easy, fabulous and so delicious! My boyfriend and I loved it, and I will be making this again. No changes needed to the recipe. Perhaps the people who said it took longer to cook cut their medallions thicker? I cut mine as wide as the bacon slices, and they cooked perfectly in about 17-18 minutes. The only issue I had was that I needed to make another batch of the herb mix because I ran out and had to remake mid-dipping.

This was very good. Would be a 5 star recipe without all of the salt. Next time I will cut back on the seasoned salt and add some Cajun seasoning for a little kick.

I brushed the meat with butter/oil, sprinkled on the spices then seared it on a panini maker and baked it in a 400 oven, covered, until 135 degrees. Be sure to cook the bacon before putting it on the meat---it does not look cooked otherwise.

Loved this recipe. I bought a single tenderloin (some stores only sell 'em 2 per pack).  Seven pieces of bacon precisely wrapped the tenderloin.  I'll have to practice to get the bacon perfectly pre-cooked as different thicknesses & different cooking methods play a role.  (I microwaved the bacon for 1 min.)  I thought the seasoning was fine (not too much salt as other reviewers stated), although admittedly I palm-measured.  Per instructions I cooked in a skillet 4 min per side, but then instead of the oven I used indirect heat on the grill for about 15 minutes.  I hope I remember this recipe next time I'm hosting guests -- it's pretty, easy, delicious, and convenient to time with side dishes.

Delicious, easy five star recipe.  I wrapped uncooked, low sodium bacon around the tenderloin. I omitted the seasoned salt and doubled the rest of the spices, dipped the medallions in the spices and browned in a cast iron skillet without the butter for 4 minutes on each side. I placed the skillet in the oven and baked for 25 minutes, turning after 12 minutes.  We enjoyed this recipe - it is a keeper for me and I will be making again!  Thanks for sharing your recipe Eve Marie!

We thought this was delicious.  I followed the recipe with a couple minor changes.  I subbed thyme for the oregano-personal preference, used pre-cooked bacon since I had it on hand and it simplified the process. I cooked the medallions to completion on the stove top rather than using the oven.  They looked, smelled and tasted great, very tender and moist.  I served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli.  DH and our 3 teens all really liked it and I will make again.

Excellent!  I had not seasoned salt on hand so used Zatarain's Creole Seasoning instead.  This got a "do-again" rating from my wife!

Great recipe!  Elegant presentation and not very time consuming.  It was a little salty.  Next time I'll omit the seasoning salt.

Who needs filet mignon when you have this recipe, the pork melts in your mouth!  I used EVOO in place of the butter.

My store only had marinated pork loin, so I too skipped the added salt.  Even so, between the marinaded loin and the bacon, it was very salty.  What's a cook to do, eh?  The seasoning dip didn't add much in the way of flavor, and the butter/oil/bacon drippings made it a tad greasy.  I may try this again one day, but only with a plain pork loin, and a bit of tweaking on my part.

This was simple, elegant, AND delicious. Easy too. I recommend cooking the bacon down almost to where you'd eat it for breakfast since it doesn't cook much further in the oven.

Just awesome. What else can I say? I actually didn't cook the bacon first..but I did everything else except for the all purpose seasoning~~ I used slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning instead...and I sprinkles extra basil and oregano when they seemed to disappear from the bowl to dip the rest of the medallions into. SO YUMMY!!!! I used the thick cut bacon.

This was SUPER-easy and Super-delicious! My tenderloin was 2.36 lbs., and I did need a double batch of the seasoning...also, I was out of EVOO (gasp!) so I used 3 tlbs. butter/1tblsp. veg. oil. I WILL make this again-thank you!

Having made this recipe 10x or more, I will say it's always a croud pleaser.  SO easy to prep ahead of time, is good served hot/room temperature/cold, etc.     Half the time I don't pre-cook the bacon and whereas it's "fine", I *SO* prefer it when I do.  That makes it nice though because it means either way it's going to turn out well.   Obviously it can be seasoned any way you like but I do like this combo, with the use of 50% less sodium seasoned salt.  Anyhow, simple prep, simple items, great outcome.

Family loved this recipe.  Cooked the medallions in the bacon fat and a dash of olive oil, eliminating the butter.  After three minutes on each side I baked for the suggested 20 minutes. Yummy

This is a restaurant quality entree.  I substituted fresh garlic-2 or three cloves, fresh basil-1 Tablespoon, fresh oregano-1 Tablepoon, sea salt-1 teaspoon, and fresh ground pepper-1/2 teaspoon. Add all of the seasonings to a mortar and pestle (I use a pilon) and grind to a paste. then proceed as the recipe states.  Serve with mashed sweet potatoes, fresh cranberry relish, and a green salad for a quick and easy meal.

This sounds wonderful and I can't wait to try it.  However, I'm going to use our gas grill instead of the oven.  I think that will make them even better and I won't have to use the oven and heat up the house.

This was delicious! I followed the directions exactly. I did end up setting it under the broiler for several minutes. I will brown longer in the pan next time I make this. My kids and husband loved it. The pork was so tender and flavorful! Served with Greek spaghetti II from this site and green beans. It was an awesome dinner! Thanks for sharing! This will become a regular in my house.

Perfect!  I don't really like pork tenderloin but this was awesome.  Tender and has so much flavor.  I will make it this way only.

This is one great little recipe! I will reduce the seasoned salt by half next time, but this was delicious and very tender.  My only change was reducing the oven  temperature to 350 due to other things I had in the oven.  The timing was still spot on.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Thanks for the recipe! My husband loved this and he is not easy to please. I cooked the pork in the bacon grease instead of the butter and oil and also just used Montreal Steak seasoning instead of what the recipe called for. Yummy!

Will definitely make again!  There was a sale on some garlic & peppercorn marinated pork so we gave that a shot.  The pepper flavor was kind of overwhelming, but the pork was really tender and juicy.

Made this with pre-cut Pork Medallions (boneless loin chops). As a result, the bacon strips were wider than the pork. Also, the bacon strips were not long enough to wrap all the way around the loin chops. But that is not why I'm giving only a 3-star rating.

We found the seasoning to be overpowering. My wife scraped most of it off her serving while I tried to eat mine as prepared. As a result, she enjoyed hers more than I did.

We won't be making this again.

Easy and delicious! Followed everything in recipe except I cut pork tenderloin into 8 even slices and then wrapped bacon around slices. Worked out fine for me. I liked it with mashed potatoes on the side.

Really enjoyed this. We used a smaller portion of meat, and thick, center cut bacon, which wasn't long enough to wrap all the way around. Two pieces together worked. For the "seasoned salt" we used Cavender's All Purpose Greek seasoning which worked great. 
We found that 2 minutes per side for browning was enough, and wish we had cooked it about 15 minutes instead of 17. It wasn't dry, but more done (at about 160) than necessary.
Definitely a keeper!

Love that this does not require marinating ahead of time like most pork tenderloin recipes do!  I used rosemary & thyme instead of basil and oregano, but followed the rest as written.  My 7 year old son loved it!

I skipped the seasoned salt as my mother is on a low sodium diet, but they still turned out pretty good. I had smaller pork medallions, I think, so mine over cooked a little bit. I will definitely try them again though.

Yummy!!  I’ve cooked it three times now. 1st time I cooked the bacon like the recipe, but it fell apart when I tried to wrap.  Next two times, didn’t pre-cook bacon and it turned out just as yummy.  I must be cutting it thin, because they were pretty much done in the oven in 5 min!  It’s on my menu plan!

We loved this recipe .  The only change I'll make next time is to  check for doneness after 10 minutes in the oven.  After 15 minutes  mine was cooked more than we like it, which is with some pink in the middle.  By slightly precooking the bacon first, then cooking it again on the meat in the same cast iron skillet, it becomes possible for the bacon to become nice and crispy in the oven while not having to overcook the tenderloin.

This was excellent!  I cooked the bacon slightly in the microwave which next time I don’t think is necessary. I seared the meat in an iron skillet and finished it in the oven for 20 minutes. Served it with Brussels sprouts and fresh tomatoes. Yum!

The recipe is too salty.  I would only add 1/4 tsp seasoned salt, or  Johnny's Pork and Chicken Seasoning.  I used Italian Seasoning instead of just the basil and oregano.

I am sure I will make it again with changes, because at it's heart it is a wonderful dish!

This was by far my favorite recipe I made! I also used the bacon dripping to sear my pork medallions and used different seasoning. I'm not much on the dried herbs. I used some sear -n- crust I got from HEB. Man it was great!

The whole family enjoyed it.  Very simple and quick but elegant and sophisticated.  (Makes this dad look like a great cook). I will cut the salt in half and try to vary  the spices soon.

We loved this!  Made according to the recipe, except that I omitted the salt had a whole pork loin instead of the just the tenderloin.  This produces a larger cut more the size of a boneless pork chop instead of the medallions.  That being said it takes two slices of bacon to wrap completely.  I precooked the bacon  which also causes some shrinkage.   The applewood flavored bacon is delicious with this.  It was a huge hit and I will be making it again.

This turned out well, but I reduced seasoning to 1 tsp each of oregano, basil, and garlic powder only. Bacon is salty enough for dish. I would also reduce cooking time next time as it was cooked a bit much for us. I would sear for 2min each side, then 12 min in oven at 400. as you are only cooking a medallion, the times listed seemed to dry out and over cook the pork.

Delicious! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and did not pre-cook the bacon. I also omitted salt - no flavor lost at all! I seared for four minutes on each side and then transferred to a baking sheet and drizzled with the pan drippings. Baked for 17 minutes to get to 145 degrees and removed immediately. I would rate it 5 stars if there was a juice or sauce instead of pan drippings. Tip - make sure you leave toothpicks clearly visible so they will be easier to remove before serving.

It was OK.  Its a pain to toothpick the bacon to the sides. It does not really add much flavor to the chop but does go well with it.

Very good and tender!  The whole family enjoyed them.  I think next time I will just leave them simmer on the stove top covered to complete cooking.  No need to move to the oven really.  Just like pan cooked pork chops only better.  The bacon can be a challenge to keep on the medallion though.  I would recommend a thinner cut of tenderloin for this recipe.

I made this recipe the other night for guests. It was a mixed bag as far as peoples rating that evening.  My husband doesn't like seasonings so he was not thrilled, but I loved it.  There were two guests who ate unseasoned meat and the rest of us liked the seasoned meat.  I will make it again and season some and leave some unseasoned.

Good recipe and very simple. Only change i made was to reduce oven time. Pork tenderloin cooked at 400 for 17 to 20 minutes will yield shoe leather. I cooked them for 7 minutes. Long enough to finish the bacon and cook the pork to an internal temp of 120 degrees. Perfect!

Very easy to do and quite flavorful.  Not a huge bacon fan but with the different seasonings took a shot.  Very tender and juicy.  Reccommend a high temperature to sear the outside prior to placing in oven, seals the juices in better.

This recipe is a keeper. The reason for my 4 star rating is the proportions and rations. 1/2 Lb of pork per person is a bit excessive. If you need to reduce the recipe for 2, then, you will have to make couple of adjustments. For  1 lb. tenderloin you will likely need more than 4 bacon strips to wrap it. I had to use the 8 that the recipe called for. Second, you will have to add a bit more of each of the seasonings provided that you will have 8 slices. As for everything else, just follow the instructions or don't do the pre-cooking of the bacon and pre-searing of the medallions.  If you go the route without pre-cooking, you will save yourself from the extra oil and will end up with a moister medallion good for the time the tenderloin spends in the oven. As an overall, my actual modification was adding pepper to this recipe. It was delicious! I made a bit of fettuccine and prepared them with the Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site. Perfect combination of restaurant quality dinner at home! Will make it again!

This turned out very flavorful. I used pork loin instead of tenderloin because I'm not a fan of tender loin (beef or pork). Because of the bacon I used only a light sprinkling of salt and browned the meat in a butter/bacon fat mixture instead of olive oil. It looked fancy but didn't take long to make. We'll have this again.

I made it by the recipe.  The tenderloin was a bit bigger around and took about 1 1/2 slices of bacon to reach around it.  It was a bit more involved, but actually quite easy.  I will be making this again soon.  My only recommendation is perhaps wrapping and slicing the tenderloin before it has completely thawed just to ease the slicing.  Also, slice it the width of the bacon as anything thicker will take longer to cook.  Fantastic dish, perfect for company and those times when you just want to treat your family to something a bit more special.

I have made this many times, you can use any combo of spices. I slice my pork loin first then wrap with bacon(I do not cook bacon before wrapping). I put them on the grill and they always turn out great.

Made these and used the Venison with Blackberry wine sauce recipe on this site as well. Super great combo together! Served with a potato or root veggie toasted is just a perfect cool weather dish. Had this at a very fancy resort last week in an artist’s colony in the California Desert. Came home craving it. Thanks to two wonderful people submitting similar recipes I’m enjoying it again this week!

Excellent flavour but should have cooked bacon more prior to wrapping - did not brown at all with oven cook  time.
Eager to try again on BBQ and crispier bacon.

What a delishous way to prepare pork tenderloin! How can you go wrong anyway when you add bacon? It's a very easy and tasty dish to prepare. My family wants me to make it again so you know it's a keeper here at my place. Thank you for the recipe Eve  Marie!

Delicious, easy, and fancy for company.  I bought the bacon wrapped pork medallions all ready to go.  I used McCormick Gill Mates Smokehouse Maple seasoning along with some Brown Sugar Bourbon.  Both are favorites of ours.  I browned them in the skillet before baking.  The bacon was crisp without putting it under the broiler at the end.  I will keep this recipe as a favorite.

Thumbs up.  I used a pre-marinated pork tenderloin so did not use the recommended seasonings; did sprinkle some Italian seasoning, but that was it.  Pork is considered safer these days, to eat a little on the rare side, so I would  definitely reduce cooking time next time, as it wa a little tough.  I browned the pork in the bacon juice as others have done, and thought this was a great recommendation (eliminate extra steps when u can).  Not sure I have it up to par to serve for company, but am going to give it another go - good stuff!

The pork was tender and juicy and the flavor was amazing. My family raved about how good it was.  The only thing I changed as to sear the meat in the bacon grease instead of butter. I will be making this again!

Really liked the recipe, flavour is great. I would cut the baking time way down on my next try. 
I pan seared them and then baked at the recommended temp for 14 min. At that point the internal temp was 150° F and rising. 
Found them still moist but on the dry side and tougher as well.

Pretty good!  I honestly would of liked this better if it was grilled.  I felt with pan searing/baking that it needed a sauce to go with it.  So I think I will use the concept of this recipe next time and make it with a sauce to glaze over top.  Maybe either a cream style, wine reduction, or a plum sauce like one of my favorite restaurants serves.  I did think like many others have said, that the seasoning salt needs reduced.  It was a little on the salty side.  I didn't have a tenderloin, so just used a regular loin and cut the medallions into 2 in. thick slices.  They took at the most 13-15 min. in the oven to get done and not over cooked at 400 degrees.  Overall I loved the concept, it just needed a little more flavor for my likeing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the third time I have made this receipe, and we LOVE it, actually gets better each time I make it.  Cheated and bought bacon wrapped pork sirloin from the butcher.  Otherwise I followed the receipe exactly and checked the temp.of the pork half way through cooking (around 8 minutes) .  Next time I will I pull out of the oven when the pork temp reaches around 140 degrees to allow for resting time.  Excellent seasonings, I also pour the pan drippings over the pork when I put the filets into the oven and turn half way through cooking time, on non-stick foil on a baking sheet. Served with easy rice pilaf (from this site) and fresh broccoli with creamy cheese sauce.  Yummy....yummy...yummy

Oh my!  There were NO leftovers!  I too did not cook the bacon first, and after browning them in the skillet, I transferred them to a baking sheet and spooned the drippings on them and popped them in the oven!  This will definitely be in my dinner rotation!  My two teenagers are thrilled!

made this tonight - very tasty - used thick cut bacon, which imparted a wonderful smoky flavour to the luscious tenderloin. Seasoning complents the meat perfectly without over powering.
Teamed it with an arugula salad with balsamic vinaigrette and steamed new potatoes - will def make this again!!!

This was awesome!

I grilled the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin for about three minutes for each side instead of four.  Everything else, I followed from the recipe.  The seasonings were perfect.

I served them with garlic mashed potatoes and honey-glazed carrots and snow peas.  It was an amazing dinner.

I thought these were great.  I did double the seasonings because I wanted a good coating on them.   I followed the recipe to the point of placing the skillet in the oven.   I did not have a skillet to go into the oven safely, so at that point I brushed olive oil onto the bottom of a glass casserole dish,  stuck that in the oven for a few minutes to get it hot, and then put the medallions in there.  My only criticism is that I thought the cooking time was off just a little.  I cooked it for a total of 15 minutes  ( I turned them halfway through), which I thought would be about right and even with that my internal temp was up a good bit more than the recommended.   I was afraid they would be dry, but they were still moist and really good.  My husband loved them.

I used boneless pork chops because that's what I had and I also switched the basil with sage, again because that's just what I had handy. Served with wild rice and sautéed spinach and my five year old twins loved it ;)

I made this for my family on a chilly Minnesota October night, and everyone absolutely loved it. I cooked the bacon in the pan, drained the grease, and put the pork into the pan. Seared each side of the pork for 5 minutes and put the pan directly into the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. It turned out perfectly juicy and delicious. I used applewood smoked bacon and it gave the pork just the slightest bit of sweetness. My 6 year old thought it was delicious. Will definitely be putting into my rotation of recipes.

This was good and easy easier than I thought it would be, however I found the cook times to be very off. I used thick cut bacon, which should have made my medallions thicker than the recipe (almost two inches thick). Still, I only started them in the pan two minutes each and they only spent 12 minutes in the oven before I pulled them out at 150°.  I'd warn to be careful and definetely check with a thermometer. Also, for four medallions, I had to use more seasoning than the recipe called for, but that may be personal taste as I like strong flavors.  Added thyme and a dash of red pepper.

This is absolutely delicious! Since I already had a bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, I skipped cooking the bacon & followed everything else. However, the tenderloin had to be cooked for 25 minutes @ 400 degrees -because the meat was still really pink inside. Otherwise, this was a delicious well-seasoned tenderloin!

I made it exactly as written and it was delicious!  My husband walked in the door and commented on how great dinner smelled (thank you, bacon!).  When it came time to eat, even my kids loved it!  This is the best pork tenderloin I have ever made.  Very moist and flavorful.

Great recipe, great flavor.  The reason for the 4 star rating is that it was salty.  I would recommend cutting back on the salt (you can add more later if need be).  It came out very tender and juicy with a wonderful flavor.  I will make it again with my one small change.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with all of us!  Give it a try, it is worth it.

This is a favorite for my family!  So full of flavor.  I use regular salt and cut the amount in half.  I also omit the butter and oil and sear the pork in the bacon grease.  So yummy!

Delish!  I baked mine a touch longer, 30 minutes, but they still turned out moist and delicious!  I would agree, turning them half-way through is a suggestion I would add. My spouse said they looked like they could be served in a restaurant.

This recipe was super easy and fast.  I left work at 5, ran to the store, threw everything together and had dinner on the table by 6:30.   I did use half the seasoning salt and substituted italian seasoning for the basil and oregano to save time.  I used my dutch oven to cook the bacon and brown the medallions, I then put the lid on the dutch oven and threw it in the oven for 20 minutes.  The house smelled amazing and the medallions were moist and full of flavor!  I need more recipes like this!!

The recipe as written is very good.  The seasoning mixture added extra flavoring--next time I will add dried thyme and rosemary, dried or finely minced fresh, since these spices are also naturally good with pork.
As some other reviewers suggested, I will also brown in the bacon drippings and continue cooking them in the same skillet till done rather than place them into the oven.  Why add extra ingredients when you don't have to OR heat up another appliance (especially in the summer) when one is sufficient!?  
In order to make sure the bacon would not be partially raw in places, I cooked the strips about a minute longer and then used 2 strips per pork round rather than one, since at that point, one strip would not have been long enough.
I will be making these again with the above changes noted.

Don't add salt! Also, you can skip browning bacon & just put pan under broiler after cooking. Otherwise, adhered to recipe. Result: absolutely delicious!

Just made this for the first time, awesome dish and my whole family loved it. The only thing I did differently was use chopped fresh basil instead of dried, but I let the basil sit in the spices for about 30 mins before I used it, in order to draw out some of the moisture.  Also for sides I made sautéed mushrooms and zucchini, seasoned with lemon pepper seasoning and some fresh garlic. As well as fresh fruit for another side. I meant to take a picture but I was so hungry that I forgot to.

Had it tonight for dinner. Easy to make. My husband LOVED it and doesn't care for pork (unless it's bbq). I thought it was a bit salty. 3 year old ate her medallion before touching anything else. Used thick cut maple bacon. We were trying to figure out sides. I served with cinnamon apples and green beans. Will definitely add to the rotation. Thank you!

Prepared according to recipe and couldn't have been happier with the pork. Even the time was perfect. I pulled the medallions out of the oven and an instant read thermometer read 147*....perfect BUT...after removing the medallions to a warm platter I returned the pan to  high heat and added 6 thinly sliced cloves of garlic and 1/2 stick of butter. Allow garlic to just begin to sauté and add 1 cup chardonnay, 1/3 cup lemon juice and a generous grind of black pepper.
Reduce by 1/3, and stir in 1/2 cup Romano or parmesan cheese and serve over 1LB. linguini in a large bowl with a little more cheese on top.

I always make this recipe and everyone loves it! Restaurant quality they say.  Tonight I added the bacon grease plus the left over butter and oil to the baking dish while it was baking and it made it really moist and juicy. The best one I've made so far. Thanks for this delicious idea!

This was wonderful. I didn't read the instructions well at first so I wrapped the bacon around the pork loin before realizing I was supposed to cook it first. To adjust I browned the medallions only 1-2 minutes per side then into the oven! Worked great. Came out moist and tender. Since I like things with a bit of zing I also added onion powder and smoked paprika to the spice mix. Definitely 5 stars.

Amazing, no changes to this recipe needed. I didn't have seasoning salt so found a recipe and made it myself first as I did not want to alter the recipe. Recommend this recipe!

Tasty!  Very flavourful and easy to make with ingredients I always have around the house.  Everyone in the family loved it.
Be sure not to make the bacon too crispy.  I had a couple pieces like that and they were (obviously) much more difficult to wrap around the tenderloin.
I made it as directed.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe except added a bit more of all the seasonings while browning and also browned them right in the bacon grease instead of adding butter. Next time I think I would not pre-cook the bacon as someone else suggested and just let it bake in the oven. My family loved it! Definitely a keeper!

This was amazing! I used a turkey breast tenderloin, because I had one in my freezer, and it turned out GREAT! Served with mashed potatoes and gravy. Kids loved it, and the hubby went back for seconds. So yummy! Will definitely make again!

I am not overly fond of pork chops or pork loin but I really liked this.  My husband loved it - therefore I am giving it 5 stars.  I omitted the seasoned salt as many recommended, but did add some onion powder.  I used Garlic infused Olive Oil with half the amount of butter called out. I used Ghee (clarified butter) which has such a wonderful taste.  I also added some sun-dried tomatoes and sliced half an avocado and cooked with with the pork in the oven.  Served with with Asparagus and fresh sliced tomatoes completed this delicious meal.

Taste very good, but they were a little over cooked. Maybe the pork I used was cut thinner, I used pork chops I had in freezer instead of a buying a whole tenderloin. I'll try them again, but next time I'm using a thicker cut or reducing the time in the oven.

This recipe was to DIE FOR!  I absolutely LOVED it and so did the BF!  I used pork short boneless ribs and bent them into a circle.  Then I wrapped each piece with 2 pieces of bacon.  My stove is a little on the hotter side so I only needed to cook the each piece for about 3 mins on each side.  I needed 15 mins in the oven but like I said before my stove is on the hotter side.  Served with cauliflower and a nice salad.  Yummy!  Will def make again!

This sounded good, and the reviewers raved. It was very, very good. I would serve this to company. It's easy, tasty and makes a good presentation. Unfortunately, I overcooked the bacon, so it didn't wrap around the tenderloins as well as it should have, but this one is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Great recioe. Made per this recipe but adjusted the herbs. Usec thick sliced bacon because that is  what I had, but will use regular next time. Made for a small dinner party and everyone really liked it.

Way too salty. I had to reduce my cook time to 2min on each side in the frying pan because the butter and grease started to burn. It was tender but next time i will cut season salt out because i feel the bacon adds enough salt itself.

Delicious combination of spices and bacon make this dish delish! The pork was very tender as well. I followed the recipe except for the substitution of minced garlic for the garlic powder. Great with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus.

This recipe is awesome!!  Thank you so much for posting it.  I cut the season salt down to 1/2 tsp because of the other posts.  It was wonderful.

Didn't read reviews before trying this and agreed that the salt could easily be cut in half. Wouldn't mind cutting a tad out of the garlic as well. But those are small changes to an otherwise great recipe!

I'm not a fan of oregano, so I only used 1/2 tsp, and I used 1/2 tsp of the seasoned salt.  I added some adobo seasoning, maybe 1/2 tsp.  I think I'll skip the oregano completely next time.  It just seemed out of place to me with the meat.  I also had a big problem with securing the bacon with toothpicks, but that could have been because I was trying to wrap the strip of bacon around two smaller tenderloins.  The bacon was long enough to go all the way around, but it was just too loose.  I think next time I'll use string to secure it.  Otherwise, it was easy and different from my typical roasting or grilling.

This was very easy to make and probably the best thing I have made from this site.  My kids loved it and so did I!! I did make a few modifications based on previous reviews.  But I found it fairly easy to make and tasty. Definately a keeper!!

Fantastic, I suggest not cooking the bacon before hand. I've made both ways though, just that bacon is easier to work with and not dry.

This was so simple and yummy!  The only thing next time I'm thinking of adding some sort of a dipping sauce (only because pork can be dry).  Served with oven roasted red potatoes (covered with olive oil and seasoning salt), corn and pumpkin spice cake.  Hubby said I out did myself.

I made this on a school night for the family.  I followed this recipe exactly using thick sliced bacon by Smithfield.  I'll make it again with a few variations.  The tenderloin will be marinated in Italian dressing and I'll omit the salt.  This will ensure flavor throughout the pork.  Also, I'll put this on the grill.  Overall it was delicious and the kids loved having bacon.

This recipe has become a staple in my house. Everyone loves it! Whenever I ask my husband what he feels like eating during the week this is what he asks for. I pair it with Green Bean Casserole and it is wonderful! I've seen someone say this takes more than an hour, I can do it from start to finish in 45 minutes and I think it is worth it. We NEVER have any to throw away at the end of the week!

Wow!  Great recipe and easily adapts to your favorite herb blend or rub.  I didn't read the recipe carefully enough and cut my tenderloin into one inch medalions before wrapping with bacon.  In hind sight, that might be easier than wrapping it whole.  I also cooked these on the grill over medium/high heat.  Have tried pre-cooking the bacon as well as just wrapping it raw.  On the grill, the bacon crisps up nicely, so I don't bother with pre-cooking any more.  Makes this a really quick, easy meal!  I love finding awesome basic recipes that are so easily tweaked to taste.  Great job, Eve!

Fabulous recipe... so flavorful with minimal ingredients and prep/cook time.  Pork dries out so easily but this was moist and delicious.  I doubled the spices and that was just about enough for 2 lbs of tenderloin.  You may want to taste the spice rub and adjust for salt depending on how salty you want it.  I may try with thick cut, lower sodium bacon next time around.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!  Served with roasted potato, carrot, brussel sprouts and mushrooms.

I just made this for dinner and had to come back on here just to say how DELICIOUS it was! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! The only difference was I took mine out earlier from the oven because they "looked" ready and I was right. So check the internal temp about 10 minutes in to the oven time. Thanks!

Excellent!  Loved by all.  Next time I am going to lighten up on seaonings sticking to the herbs only with a touch of pepper ... bacon adds enough salt. But overall this was a fantastic dinner.  Great way to prepare a great piece of meat.

It was good but came out a bit greasy and didn't seem worth the hassle. Would probably cook it up again if I wanted to go the extra mile for guests.

These are fabulous. I used dried basil from my basil plant, and also added a bit of onion powder to dry ingredients. I also substitute adobo for the seasoning salt because that's what I keep in my house, and I use about 3/4 teaspoon of it. I just fry them in the bacon grease and bake them on 375 degrees for a half hour or so. I also use a bit more oregano than what's called for. I've made these several times, they are part of our rotation, and my husband loves them. If you're worried about the salt, don't use as much.

Took others suggestion & grilled. Excellent!!!!  Don't forget to brown pork with the spices before grilling.

Delicious! I did not need to oven roast. I cooked a smaller portion of pork for me and my husband and the pan searing ended up cooking it all the way through.

This is a keeper...even the kids love.  Made at the last minute with center cut pork loin I thawed out from the freezer and WITHOUT the bacon because I had none, and it was still very good.

Very good!  I'm going to try to do it a little different to get rid of some of the fat in the oven but my husband really liked it and he is really picky!!!!  I'm wondering about doing this on the grill - we are going to try that also.

great recipe! I did make some adjustments since I was unable to find a pork loin that wasn't marinated in something. So like reviews prior I did not use any additional salt and it was still a little salty so next time I will have to find a plain pork tenderloin. I also added whole garlic cloves to the skillet before I put it in the oven. I used an applewood smoked bacon that inhanced the flavors. Another thing I will change next time is the seasonings don't mix well the garlic powder seems to settle on the bottom of the bowl so the first couple have a lot of basil and oregano on them, so I will coat them in garlic first and then mix the basil and oregano and coat seperately.

My husband and I loved this!  It was a little salty, but otherwise very easy and flavorful.  I did not put all seasons on a few because my girls cringe at the "green" stuff, and they liked theirs too. I am thrilled to have a new recipe for pork, and as several have suggested, this is good enough for company!

Excellent recipe!  Everyone loved it but to give it five stars here's my suggestion.  I wouldn't dredge the medallions in anything.  Because you are frying them in bacon drippings and butter, you already have enough salt!  The next time I prepare this dish I will simpily fry the medallions and grill them with indirect heat and hickory smoking chips.  I will baste the medallions at that time with wonderful garlic basting oil that contains herbs.  That way I get the wonderful garlic and herb flavor without the excessive salt.  Grilling the medallions is so much more flavorable than oven roasting them.

Middle of the road on this one. I did use thick cut pork chops and used half the seasoned salt. The meat was dry, (still) too salty, and too much garlic (and I love garlic)burbed it all night long! A basic recipe to play around with, but I wouldn't make this again with the suggested spices. I didn't think the bacon added anything to the flavor. (Husbands thoughts were the same.)

My local grocery store had pork tenderloin on sale this week so I bought some and made this recipe. My hubby and I thought the meat was tender and tasty-a little different buy still tasty- but my teenage boys didn't care for it. If I make this again, I think I'll grill it instead.

I served this dish to company tonight, and it received raved reviews!  I think I might try to cut the filets a little thicker next time.  I didn't have an oven-safe skillet, so I just transferred them to a baking dish before putting them in the oven for 15 minutes.  The first five filets got nearly all the basil/oregano, and less garlic/seasoned salt, so I might try something different next time.  YES, there WILL be a next time!  Served with baked potatoes and french-cut green beans...  Fantastic!

My husband and I enjoyed this meal a lot! I played around with some of the spices/seasonings and it was still great. The bacon really adds a lot of flavor to this dish and I am sure it would be great with any style of bacon you have. Great for a quick and easy meal. We will be eating it again and again!

Good flavor, easy recipe. But the cooking time is too long! I only cooked it for 15 minutes in the oven and it was still dry. Also - you can cut down on the butter and oil (prob a T of each would be good) because there was a little too much.

We really like this recipe!  Simple and easy to make, but moist and tasty.  We make this and do a cheese paste with veggie side dish.  That way you can dip the pork in.

This was so good! I made it with Pork Chops instead of the tenderloin and followed the recipe the same and it was great!

Fantastic recipe!!!  The only variation that I made was to add 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1 teaspoon of sage to the seasonings.  My boys absolutely devoured it!  It was so easy to prepare - we will definitely be adding this to our "keeper" recipe folder. :)
