These were not bad but they didn't taste like the regular oatmeal cookie either.  I could tell that it had less sugar.  I often use reduced fat ingredients in many recipes but when it comes to cookies, I prefer to use the standard recipe.  I will probably stick with the original recipe instead of making this one.

Cookies did not spread out at all.  If you want flatter cookies, you may want to press them down a little with the bottom of a glass before baking.  The addition of cloves really did give the cookies a nice spicy flavor.  I also added a cup of chopped pecans.  Not overly sweet, so even makes a nice grab and go breakfast, with yogurt or milk.

I made a healthier change: replace 1/2 cup butter with 1/4 cup grape seed oil. So one stick of butter and 1/4 grape seed oil. Polyunsaturated fats can have a beneficial effect on your health when consumed in moderation and when used to replace saturated fats (butter).  Polyunsaturated fats can help reduce the cholesterol levels in your blood and lower your risk of heart disease. Also, I substituted the white sugar with 2 tablespoons of Stevia baking blend. They came out delicious! Crunchy on outside, chewy on inside.

These were a big hit at work and at home!  They did not rise or change shape really so they didn't look "pretty" but they're going strong and kept well in tins and in the cookie jar. I added 1/2 cup walnuts and used half golden raisins and half regular raisins.  I was generous with the spices too, adding extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice in addition to the ground cloves.

More of a breakfast cookie than a "cookie" cookie, but pretty good.  To make it healthier I used 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 butter.  I also subbed palm sugar and honey in place of the brown and white sugars.   Turned out quite good

This recipe is perfect if you want soft and flavorful cookies. The addition of whole wheat flour, less sugar, and no trans fats adds to my excitement of this recipe. My small 'grand'people are coming this week and I know it will be difficult to limit the number of cookies they will eat. They're gonna love them. Thanks for the recipe.

These are really good.  The only thing I did differently is add in addition to the raisins, 1/3 of a cup of white chocolate.  Very Very Good.
