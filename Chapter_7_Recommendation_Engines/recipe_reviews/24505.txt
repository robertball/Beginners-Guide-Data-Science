I really liked this recipe. I added mushrooms to it as we like them in everything. I did not feel this is a quick recipe. There are several steps--cooking rice, preparing the sauce which has a lot of ingredients and then the actual stir frying. It was delicious though and I am sure to make it again!

This was super yummy. I did change it a bit though.  First, I used canola oil instead of the butter with the sesame oil to fry the rice, and I used no fat in the sauce.  Along with the snow peas, I added diced green and red pepper, purple onion, mushrooms and bok choy.  I also added some low sodium tamari sauce while I was frying the rice...I couldn't help myself.  Because I wasn't sure how my shrimp-loving toddler would like the sauce, I left it off completely and served it on the side.  The sauce was super delicious but was almost bitter.  I ended up adding a good teaspoon more honey.  Next time I'll use freshly squeezed orange juice rather than the pasturized stuff to cut down on the tang.  A great addition to our clean-out-the-veggie-bin Friday night stir fry.  Thank you!

This was so tasty and very refreshing.  I substituted some crunchy sugar snap peas for the corn which was a great addition.  Thanks!

These shrimp were delicious!  I was very pleased with the flavor and the ease of preparation. The time it took to prepare was well worth the effort.  I will make these again soon.  I did not care for the rice.  I make my fried rice from brown rice that I make the day before. I put a little peanut oil in the frying pan and quickly cook the cold brown rice with a little green onion.  I then scramble 2 eggs off the side of the pan and incorporate this in the rice dish.  You can add cooked peas, or almonds, etc. . .

This is a very good recipe, but next time we will serve it over steamed rice instead of frying the rice. It didn't seem to be enough to serve four people. The sauce is delicious!

This is a great recipe, with a yummy flavor and lots of room to fiddle with ingredients. It's not the usual fried rice flavor, which in my book is a plus. I used 1/2 cup of broccoli florets instead of the peas & corn. If you can get one person to make the sauce while another gets the rice going & does everything else, it goes super fast, too!

We were disappointed... it was quite different than expected, took a while and made many dishes for a bland meal.

This recipe was fairly good.  A little bland for our tastes, so I added a some salt and cayenne pepper.  That helped.

I was so excited to try this because of all the great reviews. I made everything exactly as the recipe states. It was ver disappointing. The sauce never thickened in the sauce pan. The rice was mushy after having been cooked, then fried, then steamed w/ the shrimp and o.j. mixture spooned over it. What a mess. I did add some diced red bell pepper and that tasted great especially in combination with the corn. Well, that's about it. I don't even know if I can fix this one to try again next time -- would be too much work.

This is a great recipe -- I like it a little sweeter so I add 1 Tablespoon of honey rather than 2 tsp. It's great the day of, only so-so as leftovers.

This recipe was rather disappointing...I squeezed fresh orange juice in my juicer and followed the recipe pretty much to a tee, although I marinated the shrimp in the sauce for a few hours.  The sauce just seemed very bland to me, not much flavor.  It was edible, but I had to add mucho salt and pepper :-/  Maybe a dash of soy would spruce things up.  I probably won't attempt this again though...Sorry...

This was good and different, but I don't think it was worth all the time it took to prepare it. I prefer the more traditional taste of fried rice.

Very good.  I only follow the recipe for the sauce, and threw in whatever veggies I have on hand.  I also usually add peppers to this one to heat it up a bit.

This tasted pretty good, but the rice does not taste like traditional fried rice.  It also takes some preparation to pull this meal together, so it's not quick and easy, but tasty enough.

After reading all the reviews I used most of the ingredients but differently.  I started with the butter and sesame oil, added sliced carrot, sliced celery, chopped red peppers, onion and garlic.  I poured about 1/4 cup of fresh OJ into the pan and allowed it to reduce by about half, then added the rice and shrimp, lime juice, and fresh ginger and baby peas. A few quick turns in the pan and it was ready.

I was hopeful, but I agree with the reviewers who said the recipe had no taste. It was edible, but we thought it was missing something and would not make it again.

Made this for me and my boyfriend as we wanted to try something new. I made some alterations; used raw shrimps and seasoned those with ginger and some Jamaican fish seasoning. I used sweet peas instead of snow peas and doubled the amount honey. Also fried up the rice with some escallion. Was perfect!

It was an OK recipe, but it ended up very bland. I added a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables and more soy sauce than the recipe called for. I also put about a tablespoon of honey in it to give it more of a distinct flavor. I will probably not use this recipe again.
