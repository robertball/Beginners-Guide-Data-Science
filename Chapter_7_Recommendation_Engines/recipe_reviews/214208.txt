Disclaimer: I used this recipe as a basic guide, tweaking it to my tastes (which I feel is what we should all do with any recipe), using the "a little of this and a little of that" approach.  For example, I didn't have any hamburger buns laying around, nor was I about to buy any specifically for this recipe.  But I did have some odds and ends laying around that substituted quite nicely – some partially smooshed bakery garlilc croutons and about half a dozen lonely crostini hanging out in the freezer.  In other words, any type of bread you have around works out fine.  For a more complex flavor I used poultry seasoning instead of rubbed sage; enough to my satisfaction – again, I didn’t measure.  For richness and added moistness I added a little melted butter to the stuffing and didn’t use quite as much celery and onion as the recipe directed – again, I added it “to taste,” to what seemed right for me.  I topped the stuffed chops with bacon and, because my chops were quite large (thanks, Hubs…) they needed about 45 minutes in the oven.  Upon serving,  I finished them off with a quick gravy made of melted butter, cornstarch, chicken broth and a dash each of Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce for color.  So…   use this great reference recipe confidently, working with it to your own tastes and you’ll be very pleased.

Wish that I'd trusted my instinct to lightly saute the onions and celery in a little butter before mixing them together with the rest of the stuffing ingredients.  And I think that Naples also had a great idea with her bacon topping.  Should've done that too.  The veggies were a bit too crunchy and the flavor a bit bland. As is, this will probably not be a keeper for me.

Good stuff and they look super pretty on the plate. I did use stuffing that I had prepared earlier but I make mine pretty much the same as directed  with the addition of carrots for some color and I do saute my veggies just a bit to ensure they are not crunchy. We loved these chops and they turned out so nice for my first time make a stuffed pork chop. Thanks for the tasty submission.

This is a good recipe.  Like with any cook you make your own changes, to your liking.  Like it say's in the recipe...to your liking.  There were only two things I did different,  I did not stuff the pork chops and I add butter to the celery onion mixture and saute it. (Well I guess that was three.)  I placed the seasoned chops in dish, put stuffing over chops, poured (eyeballed) chicken broth over stuffing...covered with foil, baked 40 minutes, uncovered and baked another 15, adding broth if neccesary.  YUMMY!

I used 1/2 a loaf of white bread that I made the day before. The flavors were good and the house smelled like memories.  A quick and simple way to make flavorful and moist pork chops

I modified this recipe by using a different bread, 4 slices of Angelic Bakery 7 grain sprouted, and added some sliced apples. Highly recommend this recipe because the stuffing is the best I've ever had and it cooked perfectly.
