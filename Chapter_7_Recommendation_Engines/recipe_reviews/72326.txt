Easy and very very tasty.  I used straight up coconut milk and green curry paste and there was more than enough liquid to keep the fish moist in the oven and on our plates.

Excellent recipe! Be careful not to overdo the curry, needs just the right amount to not overpower the flavor of the fish. Meal turn out great, went well with brown rice.

Very easy recipe but too sweet for my taste.  I may try it with regular coconut milk.

Well, I kinda messed up when I went to buy ingredients for this... I ended up making it with red and green bell pepper, regular yellow onion, and I forgot the leek altogether. I also couldn't find green curry sauce, so I used Green Curry Paste made by 'Thai Kitchen.' This turned out way too spicy for my taste, but it had a pretty authentic Thai flavor to it, and Husband really enjoyed it. Thanks!

This turned out excellent. One comment mentioned using Trader Joe's green curry sauce and that is what I chose. I also used coconut milk. I used the whole 14 oz can because I didn't want it left over. I got extra sauce but it is so good I am sure I can find something else to put it on.

Best ever fish dish!  I didn't add the coconut cream though.  I would leave it out - 'course, we like it spicy...

I made this quite a bit different, but quick and easy.  I used frozen shrimp instead of cod and just warmed them in hot water.  I put all other ingredients into the coconut milk and let it simmer for about 5 minutes.  Pour sauce over rice and shrimp, and wah lah. 

Edit:  I did not have a leek, so I left it out.

Very tasty. but rather watery with Coconut Milk.  I used Thai green curry paste instead of sauce, but found that it was not a spicy as I wished.  Next time I will add curry power to the liquid mix. Cooking time was right on.  The photo matched my concoction.

I truly can handle heat but this was spicy! Regardless, I truly loved this. I used red curry paste so it could be why it was so spicy! My husband claims it as his favorite dish I've made him! Flavors were truly wonderful.
