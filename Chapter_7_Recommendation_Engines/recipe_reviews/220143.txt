This is a good recipe to start off on as it is easy to do, and VERY forgiving. I feel like you could add whatever you wanted to this and it would still be just as good my husband and his grandfather liked it! I also liked it. I used sharp cheddar and it’s honestly the best stir fry I’ve had in a minute.
